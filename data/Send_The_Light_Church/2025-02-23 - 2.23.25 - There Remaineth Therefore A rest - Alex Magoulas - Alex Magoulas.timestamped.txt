[32:57] place
[32:58] um I believe that you're you're really
[33:01] not going to hear from a man
[33:04] today you're going to hear from
[33:08] God but God has to use a man to speak to
[33:11] us and that's the way he chose I mean he
[33:13] can speak to our heart but he
[33:17] chose the Bible says the foolishness of
[33:21] preaching and if we could just get
[33:24] everything out of the way except God is
[33:27] right here speaking to to this
[33:29] morning and that we take it home with us
[33:33] it's not really what we can learn today
[33:36] it's not like sitting in a front of a
[33:38] television
[33:39] learning it's what we can receive into
[33:41] our heart and take that home and apply
[33:44] it in our personal lives that's what
[33:46] will make us grow in
[33:48] Christ and um we just love brother Alex
[33:52] love his ministry we love him here we
[33:54] love his family God bless his family

[34:01] distances and go to different places
[34:04] and and so God bless and reward you as
[34:07] well amen is our prayer we're going to
[34:09] have our brother come as let's sing only
[34:11] believe as our brother comes to give us
[34:13] the wonderful Words of Life
[34:15] today
[34:18] only
[34:20] believe
[34:22] only
[34:25] believe all things are
[34:37] possible
[34:39] ho
[34:41] believe all things are
[34:46] possible
[34:48] only Lord I believe oh Lord I
[34:54] believe Lord I believe
[34:59] all things are
[35:02] possible Lord I
[35:06] believe Lord I
[35:09] believe Lord I
[35:13] believe all things are
[35:17] possible Lord I
[35:21] believe amen we're so thankful for that
[35:24] today we are saved by grace through
[35:26] faith and that's not even of ourselves
[35:29] it's the gift of God so we believe today
[35:32] because he gave us something to believe
[35:34] Amen in an age where there's all kinds
[35:36] of people with influences and things and
[35:39] they can give you ideas about things
[35:40] that you should believe in that we have
[35:42] something steadfast and sure so I just
[35:45] have you be seated for just a moment um
[35:47] you know I was thinking about it this
[35:49] feels a little strange and I'm like why
[35:52] does this feel so strange and it dawned
[35:54] on me this is my first time speaking in
[35:57] the US since I got back from Egypt so
[36:00] I'm like oh yeah it's there's there's
[36:01] carpet and things on the floor that's
[36:03] why it's nice so I just thought I'd take
[36:06] a few moments that's all right and just
[36:08] uh appreciate I know that prayers were
[36:09] made for me and stuff in Egypt um I went
[36:12] with brother Jason Demars got back just
[36:14] a little over just a little under two
[36:16] weeks ago now so I know he made a full
[36:19] report at his church it's online if
[36:21] people want to see it but I'll just say
[36:22] a couple things in passing real quick we
[36:24] had a real blessed time um I got to the
[36:28] airport in Egypt we landed about 5
[36:30] minutes before I got off the plane I set
[36:32] my phone down to fill out the Customs
[36:34] card and I left my plane on the phone so
[36:37] I was told I was told you know good luck
[36:39] with that getting that back because you
[36:41] know somebody will find it but they
[36:43] won't turn it in so I prayed about and
[36:45] said well Lord if you want me to be here
[36:47] just uh you just give me my phone back
[36:48] and I got back the next night I went to
[36:50] the airport they found it and gave it
[36:51] back so that's uh that's already
[36:53] impressive with it's impressive with
[36:56] Airlines it's really impressive in a
[36:58] place like Egypt I guess so but I was
[37:00] really grateful for that um I think
[37:02] brother Jason said he's been working
[37:04] there with brother there's a brother
[37:05] there by the name of Mall in Cairo he's
[37:07] got a message church as far as I know
[37:10] it's the only Message Church in Egypt so
[37:12] he's been working with him for about
[37:14] four years and um I'll just real briefly
[37:17] say this with the with the culture and
[37:19] the different things there it's very
[37:21] difficult to find a lot of open doors to
[37:23] preach and to work but uh we met a
[37:26] another Pastor there it's actually a
[37:28] group of Pentecostal churches I think
[37:29] it's about 60 of them and they recently
[37:31] broke off of the denomination they were
[37:33] from because they differed with their uh
[37:36] denominations Doctrine about evidence of
[37:37] the Holy Ghost being speaking in tongues
[37:39] so they're already kind of they kind of
[37:41] broke off from that a little bit we went
[37:43] and we we ministered particularly on the
[37:45] idea of water baptism in Jesus Christ's
[37:48] name was one of the things we talked
[37:49] about we had prayer for the sick and we
[37:50] have different testimonies different
[37:52] people were healed as well and uh the
[37:54] biggest thing that was a real blessing
[37:57] to us is we preach at a different church
[38:00] every night we were there and the last
[38:02] night that we were preaching in the area
[38:04] that we went to that Pastor that we had
[38:06] visited he kind of introduced us to the
[38:07] different churches he said uh he said I
[38:09] received this message that you guys are
[38:10] preach about water baptism in Jesus name
[38:12] so he wants brother Jason or whoever
[38:15] wants somebody to come back and he wants
[38:16] to get re-baptized wants this whole
[38:18] church to get re-baptized and he wants
[38:19] to hear more about the message so it's
[38:21] just a real big breakthrough I
[38:22] appreciate your prayers I believe God's
[38:24] looking to do something amen he said
[38:26] he'd have a king uh people out of every
[38:28] Kindred and tongue and nation and so I
[38:31] believe there's people in Egypt that are
[38:33] there and they're the Lord's children so
[38:35] just appreciate your prayers and like I
[38:37] said we have many different testimonies
[38:39] there was a few different things in
[38:40] particular people we had prayer for with
[38:43] uh there was one woman had uh it was
[38:45] kind of funny we were doing a prayer
[38:46] line one night and she was kind of just
[38:48] kind of helping people come up and stuff
[38:50] and I stopped I said well sister what
[38:51] are you here for she's like oh I'm just
[38:52] helping people I said what do you have
[38:54] going on she had osteoporosis or
[38:56] something her knees been back D for
[38:57] years and so we we had prayer for her
[38:59] and she started danc around her knees
[39:01] got healed right there in the service so
[39:03] just different things like that God is
[39:04] God is the same amen now listen he's not
[39:06] just the god of Egypt amen he's he's our
[39:09] God today amen he's greater than the
[39:11] gods of Egypt he's greater than anything
[39:13] else so he's greater than sickness and
[39:15] so I appreciate your prayers because our
[39:17] God answers prayers I believe he's got a
[39:19] purpose in I believe if the Lord would
[39:20] carry there's a work in Egypt and I'm
[39:23] just I was just uh I was happy just to
[39:25] be a witness of it so thank you so much
[39:27] for that I appreciate that God
[39:30] orchestrates things a certain way yes
[39:33] you know we can we can rest when we
[39:35] understand that God has a plan and he
[39:37] orchestr orchestrates things a certain
[39:39] way if we'll let him do it the way he
[39:42] wants you know brother Bruce was just
[39:43] singing this morning about leaning on
[39:45] the Everlasting Arms and take your
[39:46] burden to the Lord leave it there and I
[39:48] appreciate that because I didn't tell
[39:49] him to sing those songs but somebody did
[39:51] am amen I believe it ties into what
[39:53] we're looking at today and uh I just
[39:55] want to talk about that this idea
[39:57] resting because brother Brandon makes a
[39:59] statement he says the entire Christian
[40:01] experience is based upon rest so I want
[40:04] us to really take that to heart today
[40:06] and would you just stand with me for a
[40:08] moment once more let's let's have a word
[40:10] of prayer
[40:11] because I think our P the pastor here
[40:14] said it right you know you don't want to
[40:16] hear from me and I have nothing to give
[40:17] you anyway but we're going to trust that
[40:20] according to God's plan he wants to
[40:22] speak we're going to trust him to speak
[40:24] to us let's just pray father we we thank
[40:26] you today you you are a God that answers
[40:29] prayer but more than that Lord You're
[40:31] the god that knows what we need not just
[40:34] what we want Lord there's many times we
[40:36] desired things in our lives and we
[40:38] prayed for them and you gave us
[40:40] something better than what we prayed for
[40:42] you knew better Lord you've been a
[40:43] gentle Shepherd to us and you've helped
[40:46] us along life's way and Lord the
[40:48] troubles that we deal with and the
[40:49] struggles we face so often Lord we find
[40:52] it's the situations that we have created
[40:55] for ourselves when our hearts were drawn
[40:58] astray and we went Wayward from you but
[40:59] today Lord as we've gathered here in
[41:02] this place no matter what the struggle
[41:03] is or the cause we know that you are
[41:06] faithful you're are a everpresent help
[41:08] in the time of need and you are a refuge
[41:11] to your people and so we come here today
[41:13] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[41:15] we ask for you to come and to speak not
[41:18] just what we want to hear Lord we we
[41:20] have a whole world full of people
[41:22] that'll tell us what we want to hear but
[41:23] tell us that which we need to hear that
[41:25] which is needful for our overcoming for
[41:27] the edification of your people may you
[41:30] come and speak Words of Life the words
[41:33] that would glorify you and give praise
[41:35] and honor and glory to you may you come
[41:38] and do the things which only you can do
[41:40] father may you cause a rest for the
[41:41] people may it be a satisfying portion to
[41:45] them and father we commit these things
[41:46] into your hands we thank you now for it
[41:48] all ask you bless the reading of the
[41:49] word and the ministering thereof in
[41:51] Jesus Christ's name amen if you turn
[41:54] with me this morning in your bibles if
[41:55] you have it the book of Hebrews
[41:58] the fourth
[42:00] chapter and uh this book of Hebrews it's
[42:03] a book of contrast it contrasts the law
[42:06] and the figures in the law with Jesus
[42:08] Christ in the New Testament and at the
[42:10] end of the third chapter he's talking
[42:11] about the provocation where the children
[42:13] of Israel they tempted God in the
[42:15] wilderness they refused to listen to God
[42:17] and I think it's a really good lesson
[42:19] for us because you know God by his grace
[42:21] he brought them out of Egypt he sent
[42:23] them a prophet he fed them by grace and
[42:25] then they said well we want to do
[42:26] something something we want a law we
[42:28] want to we want to have so they got a
[42:30] law and like a day later they broke it I
[42:33] mean just immediately human
[42:35] instrumentality and human effort it
[42:37] provoked God it frustrated God and it
[42:40] was no end of trouble for them
[42:42] themselves and so Paul makes this
[42:44] conclusion here in Hebrews chapter 4
[42:46] speaking about this he says let us
[42:48] therefore fear lest a promise being left
[42:51] of us of entering into his rest any of
[42:54] you should seem to come short of it so
[42:57] we've been promised rest let's be let's
[42:59] be concerned now that we don't come
[43:01] short of what he's promising is what
[43:02] he's saying for unto us was the Gospel
[43:05] preached as well as unto them but the
[43:08] word preached did not profit them now
[43:10] they heard the same gospel but it didn't
[43:12] help them why not being mixed with faith
[43:16] in them that heard it for we which have
[43:19] believed do enter into rest so we've got
[43:22] it amen if you believe a excuse me we do
[43:26] enter into rest as he said as I have
[43:28] sworn in my wrath if they shall enter
[43:30] into my rest although the works were
[43:32] finished from the foundation of the
[43:34] world so he's speaking about different
[43:35] rests here and just to unpack this a
[43:37] little bit there there was a rest that
[43:39] God had at the beginning of creation and
[43:41] then he swore to them they won't enter
[43:43] into rest so there was another rest to
[43:45] come is what he's saying it's a
[43:46] different kind of rest so he's he's
[43:48] showing you it's a different kind of
[43:49] rest for he spake in a certain place on
[43:51] the seventh day on this wise and God did
[43:54] rest the seventh day from all his works
[43:56] and in this place again so this is a
[43:58] different rest if they shall enter into
[44:00] my rest seeing therefore it remaineth
[44:03] that some must enter in so other words
[44:06] there somebody has to enter into this
[44:07] rest and they to whom it was first
[44:09] preached entered not because of unbelief
[44:12] so there's a rest that's remaining
[44:14] somewhere and these people didn't get it
[44:16] amen it's not the rest that God had in
[44:17] the beginning verse 7even again he
[44:19] limith a certain day saying in David
[44:22] today after so long a time as it is said
[44:25] today if you will hear his voice Harden
[44:28] not your hearts for if Jesus now this
[44:30] talking about Joshua it's the same name
[44:32] in the Old Testament for Joshua talking
[44:34] about the Exodus had given them rest
[44:37] then would he not afterward have spoken
[44:39] of another day so this is the conclusion
[44:41] there was a rest at the beginning there
[44:43] was a rest coming to the promised land
[44:45] but God said that they won't enter into
[44:47] the rest that I prepared so therefore
[44:50] verse n there remaineth therefore in
[44:52] conclusion there remaineth therefore a
[44:54] rest to the people of God for he that
[44:57] has entered into his rest he also has
[45:01] ceased from his own works as God did
[45:04] from his let us labor now this is this
[45:07] seems paradoxical here let us labor
[45:10] therefore to enter into that rest lest
[45:14] any man fall after the same example of
[45:16] unbelief I just want to read a couple
[45:17] more verses here notice for the word of
[45:19] God is quick and powerful and sharper
[45:21] than any two-edged sword piercing even
[45:24] to the dividing a su of Soul and Spirit
[45:27] of the joints and Marrow and is a
[45:28] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[45:31] the heart neither is there any creature
[45:33] that is not manifest in his sight but
[45:35] all things are naked and open unto the
[45:37] eyes of him with whom we have to do so
[45:40] these last two verses are warning us
[45:42] listen God knows whether you're arrested
[45:44] or not amen there's no point in trying
[45:46] to fool God and there's really no point
[45:48] in trying to fool yourselves that's what
[45:50] most people do well I'm okay I'm where I
[45:52] need to be I'm fine but they're not fine
[45:55] and we see this in the scripture so we
[45:57] have a warning today to make sure we've
[45:59] entered into this rest and so I just may
[46:01] the Lord bless the reading it was word
[46:02] you may be seated this morning here so
[46:06] as we just talked about a moment ago
[46:07] when we look in the original account of
[46:10] Creation The Book of Genesis we find as
[46:12] it mentions here in Hebrews that God
[46:14] rested on the seventh day from all his
[46:16] works and he blessed the day he the
[46:18] scripture says he blessed it thank you
[46:20] so much he bless this seventh day this
[46:22] this day of rest and so I want you to
[46:24] consider this I don't believe that God
[46:26] rested because he was weary or because
[46:29] he was tired he's like man that was
[46:31] really tough I need to take a break but
[46:33] God doesn't rest because he's tired or
[46:34] weary but he Caps or completes his work
[46:37] by rest so rest shows that the work is
[46:40] finished amen it's a it's a
[46:42] signification that he's satisfied with
[46:45] his work amen so so to the Christian as
[46:48] God has done by the work of the new
[46:51] creation us he causes us to enter into a
[46:54] completeness in rest amen so when we're
[46:56] resting in the Lord we're putting
[46:58] confidence in a finished work amen now
[47:02] God is doing things in our lives but the
[47:04] work that's necessary for us to be saved
[47:07] that's already done amen he cried out
[47:09] when he died at the cross it is finished
[47:11] amen and so everything that we need
[47:13] today everything that we're looking for
[47:15] that we're depending upon we're resting
[47:17] on the idea or the not just an idea but
[47:20] the it's a finished work amen so God
[47:24] rested and Jesus he's uh he's called the
[47:26] lord of the the Sabbath in the gospels
[47:27] how many knows this amen he's the lord
[47:29] of the Sabbath and he makes it very
[47:30] clear because the Jews accuse him of
[47:33] violating the Sabbath because one day he
[47:35] sees a woman sick and it's the Sabbath
[47:37] day and he heals this woman they said ah
[47:39] look at this he broke the Sabbath God
[47:42] ordained this rest and here he is
[47:44] violating it but he says listen if you
[47:46] had an ox in a ditch on the Sabbath day
[47:49] you'd go fetch it out and this is a
[47:52] daughter of Abraham in other words she's
[47:54] worth more than the ox if it was an ox
[47:57] you'd care about the ox but she's been
[47:59] sick for days maybe for years and you
[48:02] get all up in arms because well you're
[48:04] violating this rest and what's ironic
[48:06] he's the lord of the
[48:08] Sabbath they're upset because he's
[48:10] violating the Sabbath and they accuse
[48:13] him of breaking the law they accuse him
[48:14] of violating the Sabbath and he makes
[48:16] this point listen men was not made for
[48:19] the Sabbath the Sabbath was made for the
[48:22] man amen God didn't make a bunch of men
[48:26] and make children so he could make his
[48:28] words and his law ah see people I got
[48:30] somebody to observe it amen he didn't
[48:32] make all these things because he wanted
[48:33] to promote the observance he made the
[48:35] observance for you amen he didn't make
[48:38] you so you could glorify the idea of
[48:40] rest he made rest so you would have it
[48:43] to glorify him amen and this is what
[48:46] religion does we always promote the form
[48:48] or the fashion or the the the doctrine
[48:51] of it over what the the purpose was amen
[48:53] Jesus he suffered and died and he rose
[48:56] again not for a bunch of words on a page
[48:59] not just for a Creed Dogma but for
[49:01] people for his children he did it for us
[49:05] and he gives his word he sent his word
[49:08] and he healed us and he delivered us
[49:10] from our own
[49:13] destructions we were the ones that were
[49:15] bound we were the ones that fell but he
[49:17] sent himself he came and redeemed
[49:21] man and so men they took the Sabbath
[49:23] just like they did in the law and they
[49:25] they made it about uh trying to to
[49:28] fulfill their purpose or their law well
[49:30] we're we're Pharisees we're not
[49:32] Sadducees our denomination and our teach
[49:35] and our our church and our teachings and
[49:36] this and they made it about what they
[49:38] wanted it to be not what the purpose of
[49:41] God was behind it amen so listen I hope
[49:44] you caught that God made the Sabbath for
[49:45] you amen we we're looking for a Rapture
[49:48] well listen he didn't make a bunch of
[49:50] people to stick him in a Rapture he so
[49:52] he could have a Rapture he made a
[49:54] Rapture for you he made a rap Rapture
[49:57] for me he made a resurrection for us
[49:59] amen it was purpose for his children
[50:02] amen there's a future home for you the
[50:05] listen the home is not a home because
[50:07] it's got gold streets or Mansions or big
[50:10] fields it's the people that live there
[50:13] it's without the people it's just a
[50:15] house you're what makes it a future home
[50:18] the character of God's children is what
[50:21] makes you the place he wants to
[50:23] live amen so he didn't make all these
[50:26] things and as an afterthought hey I'll
[50:29] put some children in to Adorn these
[50:31] things amen you were the thought you
[50:34] were the one in his mind his people his
[50:36] children you were the thing you were the
[50:38] focus amen and he made all these things
[50:40] every Mountain he ever made every every
[50:42] ocean all the things he's ever made he
[50:44] made it because he wanted a place to
[50:46] dwell with his
[50:48] people amen so you are the the
[50:53] motivation amen you're the motivation
[50:56] behind all the things that he said and
[50:58] did amen so they debate with him on the
[51:00] Sabbath and they missed the whole point
[51:02] amen listen the Sabbath is supposed to
[51:04] be ARR and here's this daughter of
[51:06] Abraham listen she's a child of God and
[51:09] you'll take care of the ox but not her
[51:12] there's something wrong with your
[51:13] thinking exactly that's not how God
[51:15] feels about it amen he made this rest to
[51:18] help her and you want to leave her where
[51:19] she's at well that's religion amen amen
[51:23] well we'll tell you how we want you to
[51:25] live and we'll tell you how we want you
[51:26] to be but we want we don't care about
[51:29] where you're
[51:30] at amen see they weren't looking at
[51:32] where she was at they were just looking
[51:34] at their law or their idea amen you know
[51:37] years ago the first time I ever went on
[51:39] a mission trip I went to Uganda I don't
[51:40] know if I've ever told this story or not
[51:41] this is clear back in uh 2011 boy I feel
[51:44] old all of a sudden amen clear back in
[51:47] 2011 I was in Uganda and you know it's
[51:50] funny I was going to preach at church it
[51:51] was a brush Arbor and uh we had to stop
[51:54] midday because the place wasn't ready
[51:56] and we just sitting in this guy's house
[51:58] and uh I look out in the street and
[52:00] there's there's this man out there in
[52:01] Uganda he's sweeping the street which is
[52:03] really remarkable to me because the
[52:05] street is made of dirt amen so he's just
[52:08] sweeping this dirt road I don't know
[52:10] moving some of the trash from one spot
[52:11] to another because they just throw the
[52:12] trash everywhere so he's moving this
[52:15] trash around here and I'm I'm wearing a
[52:17] suit and a tie and stuff in the middle
[52:19] of the day in in Uganda it's like at the
[52:21] equator I'm over there in May I stood
[52:24] out like a sore thumb I'm white I'm
[52:26] sweat I'm wearing a suit so this guy I
[52:28] happen to see him and he he walks up to
[52:30] me and it's kind of funny he starts to
[52:32] discussion with me about religion he's
[52:34] like well you must be a preacher I said
[52:36] what gave it away you know here I'm pack
[52:39] I probably have my Bible and everything
[52:41] you know how it is but but uh he starts
[52:43] talking to me and he says well I want to
[52:44] ask you a question he says what day do
[52:46] you worship God on I said that's easy
[52:47] all of
[52:49] them no no that's not what I meant he
[52:52] said what day do you do you go to church
[52:54] and things I said well we we typically
[52:56] go to church on Sunday he's like well
[52:57] you know the Sabbath is actually on
[52:59] Saturday and I said well actually it's
[53:01] Friday evening the Saturday afternoon if
[53:03] you want to get real he Seventh Day
[53:04] Adventist is what he is and so they they
[53:06] they focus they they they go to seed on
[53:09] and say do you have to come together and
[53:11] worship God on Saturday which really
[53:13] according to the Orthodox Jewish
[53:15] religion it would actually be Friday
[53:16] evening to Saturday afternoon because
[53:18] evening and day is a day but anyway
[53:19] that's where they're at and so he he
[53:21] wanted to contend with me over this idea
[53:24] of what day I go to church because
[53:26] that's a big deal to him amen and like I
[53:30] said I thought my answer is good well I
[53:32] worship him every day I just happen to
[53:33] get together on certain days all is amen
[53:36] and so he goes on and on with me for a
[53:38] while and finally he's talking about how
[53:41] well you you know it's it's the law and
[53:42] you have to keep the law to be righteous
[53:44] and I said well that's interesting
[53:45] because Abraham was found righteous
[53:47] because he believed God Abraham believed
[53:50] God and it was imputed unto him for
[53:52] righteousness and I said that was 400
[53:55] years before Moses came gave the
[53:56] commandment and now this is I'm not
[53:58] trying to make fun of the guy but this
[53:59] is what he said he said No No Moses was
[54:01] born before Abraham and I and now if you
[54:04] read the Bible you know that's not true
[54:05] you know Abraham was Moses's great great
[54:08] great great whatever grandfather so I
[54:10] looked at him I said sir I figured out
[54:11] what the problem is here you just don't
[54:13] know what the Bible
[54:15] says and this crowd had started gathered
[54:18] in the v like like 20 people standing
[54:19] around us and I said that now I'm not
[54:21] trying to sign whatever but he can't
[54:23] really blush but like he got real
[54:25] embarrassed and so he's like well I'll
[54:27] have to talk to you about this later I
[54:28] don't know how he was going to do this
[54:29] if I was going to come back to but the
[54:31] but my point is he he wanted to argue
[54:33] with me on this point because he was
[54:34] taught this by his church you must
[54:36] Worship On this day you have to do this
[54:38] and they've made that their their
[54:40] preeminent thing amen and you see how
[54:43] religion will take even a thing that God
[54:45] took for rest and it'll turn it into
[54:48] works even the things that God ordained
[54:50] to be ar rest for us religion and the
[54:53] devil will make it works for you amen
[54:56] people look at this message they look at
[54:58] the Bible and say well that's just a
[54:59] bunch of dos and don'ts and it's a bunch
[55:01] of work man this Bible has made my life
[55:04] so much better obedience to the word of
[55:07] God it's not a burden to me that's what
[55:09] the priest did in the Book of Malachi oh
[55:11] it's such a chore it's such a it's such
[55:13] a burden to serve God that's because
[55:15] you're doing it
[55:17] wrong it wasn't meant to be a burden you
[55:20] made it
[55:21] one Jesus said my yoke is easy and my
[55:25] burden is light and I submit to you
[55:27] today if you find it's too heavy maybe
[55:29] it's because you're packing it around
[55:31] the wrong
[55:33] way well praise the Lord and I'm getting
[55:35] Ahad of myself every little bit but
[55:36] that's the truth amen it's like you take
[55:39] you know when your kids are little or
[55:40] you take somebody at work maybe it's
[55:41] their first time and they're picking
[55:43] something up and you know you're an
[55:44] adult you could do it but you're
[55:45] watching them and you watch them
[55:47] struggle to do something it's like
[55:48] listen you're doing that the wrong way
[55:51] there's a lot easier way to do that if
[55:53] you just listen to me I'm not saying
[55:55] this to be your boss
[55:56] I'm not saying this sounds smarter than
[55:58] you there's just a lot better way to do
[56:00] it God's like listen I'm not trying to
[56:02] be mean there's just a better way to do
[56:05] it than you're doing it amen we carry
[56:08] around burdens we carry around besetting
[56:10] sins we struggle we restle and then we
[56:12] wonder why we're tired all the time it's
[56:14] because you're packing it around the
[56:16] wrong way you're carrying things you
[56:19] weren't meant to carry amen amen you're
[56:22] not yolked to the you're yolked to your
[56:24] burdens you're yolked to your besetting
[56:25] sins y woke up with
[56:27] Jesus amen cuz he already bore it at
[56:31] Calvary well praise the
[56:33] Lord so here's Joshua he tells the
[56:36] children of Israel Moses give us a place
[56:38] he give us this Promised Land we're
[56:40] going to go in here we're going to take
[56:41] this land and because of their unbelief
[56:43] under Moses they didn't enter in and
[56:45] they finally get there with Joshua and
[56:46] they enter in but yet there's we know
[56:49] that wasn't the rest that God is
[56:50] speaking about because David is as Paul
[56:53] points out David hundreds of years later
[56:55] is speaking about rest that is still to
[56:59] come so whatever they had in the
[57:01] promised land when they finally came in
[57:02] that's not the rest that God was looking
[57:04] at the ultimate thing he's looking at
[57:06] because he's prophesying of something
[57:07] greater and we see this in Isaiah chap
[57:09] 28: 11 and 12 12 the Bible says this for
[57:13] with stammering lips and another tongue
[57:15] will I speak unto this people saying
[57:17] this is the rest wherein I will cause my
[57:19] people to rest this is the refreshing
[57:21] and yet they would not hear it now we
[57:24] understand this as a prophetic scripture
[57:26] and it speaks about the day of Pentecost
[57:28] and the holy ghost coming on the day of
[57:29] Pentecost but I want you to understand
[57:30] it's also prophetic in the Old Testament
[57:33] because what happened is the the leaders
[57:35] of Ephraim they made Leagues with the
[57:36] Assyrians and the leaders of Judah they
[57:38] made Leagues with the Egyptians they're
[57:40] making treaties in other words you've
[57:41] got these God this God ordained nation
[57:45] and they've split up over religion and
[57:47] now that they've split up over religion
[57:48] they're making treaties for their
[57:50] protection with the Nations around them
[57:52] that God said he hated
[57:54] them so what does it speaking about it's
[57:56] speaking about the idea that God does
[57:59] not respect us trusting in our own
[58:02] strength trusting in the strength of the
[58:04] world he said I'm I've given you a word
[58:06] I'm going to send you something but
[58:08] because you won't receive it that's why
[58:11] it's not a rest for you and he did the
[58:14] same thing on the day of Pentecost amen
[58:16] they come and they're speaking with
[58:17] other tongues and these people hear it
[58:19] in their own language God is sending
[58:21] them a rest because that's what the Holy
[58:23] Ghost is that's our rest amen but the
[58:26] people the leaders who was it that took
[58:29] Peter and John who was it that rejected
[58:30] the gospel in Jerusalem it's the
[58:32] leaders they said we don't want this
[58:35] we've got our own thing we've got our
[58:36] own program oh
[58:39] my it's a warning to
[58:42] us when we trust in our own Merit when
[58:45] we try to run to the world for our
[58:46] solution now and and I want to be
[58:48] careful about that listen I'm not saying
[58:50] today not to go to talk to somebody or
[58:52] get help from a doctor but you can't
[58:53] your confidence is not there your
[58:56] confidence is in God Amen and anytime we
[58:59] put our confidence in a man or the
[59:01] things of the world or ourselves listen
[59:04] I'm talking about us ourselves well I've
[59:06] got an
[59:07] idea right I've got a plan right brother
[59:11] John you you get this probably not just
[59:12] you but you get this listen somebody
[59:14] comes to you and they're like ah man
[59:17] we're dealing with this certain
[59:18] situation and we we're just we're not
[59:20] sure what we should do I've got this
[59:22] idea I think I should do this and you
[59:23] sit there and say well you know brother
[59:25] or sister the scripture says this this
[59:27] is what the Bible says about your
[59:29] situation it's like well I know it says
[59:30] that but okay as soon as they're like
[59:33] well yeah but I don't know why you came
[59:36] to me I don't know why you're asking
[59:39] you're clearly not concerned about what
[59:41] God thinks about it you were just hoping
[59:43] that God shared your opinion I love it
[59:46] well you know we'll go pray about it
[59:48] what's there to pray about God give you
[59:50] an answer don't make prayer a refuge for
[59:53] your unbelief cuz you don't want to
[59:56] obey well I'm I'm praise the Lord
[59:59] somebody I'm talking to somebody now how
[1:00:01] many times Well Lord what am I supposed
[1:00:03] to do here and he sitting there going I
[1:00:05] done told you what to do you just don't
[1:00:08] want to listen and now you're struggling
[1:00:11] and now you're fussen and not why can't
[1:00:13] I overcome cuz you didn't
[1:00:18] listen oh now I'm really off the rails
[1:00:21] amen I gotta find a way to bring this
[1:00:23] back amen we why why why am I
[1:00:28] struggling cuz you're not listening cuz
[1:00:31] you're doing it wrong amen because
[1:00:33] you're trusting in yourself because
[1:00:36] you're trusting in manmade ability and
[1:00:40] that will always fail the bed is shorter
[1:00:43] than a man can lay on it the Blanket's
[1:00:45] shorter than a man can stretch you can't
[1:00:47] do it it won't work you can't make it
[1:00:50] something it's
[1:00:52] not we realize according to Galatians
[1:00:55] the thirr chapter
[1:00:56] that The Blessing of Abraham this is the
[1:00:58] thing Abraham was he he was he was
[1:01:00] prophesied that in you all nations will
[1:01:03] be blessed what is The Blessing of
[1:01:05] Abraham the holy ghost coming back on
[1:01:07] the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost
[1:01:09] returning upon the Believers amen
[1:01:11] because why does the Holy Ghost come the
[1:01:14] book of 1 Corinthians the 2 chapter
[1:01:16] tells you why that you would know the
[1:01:19] things which are freely given unto you
[1:01:22] in other words you've got what you need
[1:01:24] if you listen
[1:01:26] if you'll pay attention if you'll take
[1:01:28] it and receive it and act on it and Obey
[1:01:31] it you have what you need that's why he
[1:01:34] gives the Holy Ghost so you would not be
[1:01:37] ignorant so you would know so if you're
[1:01:40] ignorant it's because you're not
[1:01:41] listening it's because you're not paying
[1:01:43] attention if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:01:45] listen the John says this way you have
[1:01:47] an unction and you know all things I
[1:01:50] people call me a note all for years the
[1:01:53] Bible says I am but I don't know here
[1:01:57] you don't know it here it's it's here
[1:01:59] and when you're not listening amen
[1:02:01] praise the Lord now I haven't looked at
[1:02:03] this a whole lot but it's like they want
[1:02:04] to get these AI chips and put them in
[1:02:06] your head and you can you can Google
[1:02:07] anything now amen well listen God's been
[1:02:10] doing that for 2,000 years you need to
[1:02:12] know something there's an unction in you
[1:02:14] if you'll listen if you'll take his
[1:02:16] counsel if you'll consult the word it's
[1:02:19] there praise the Lord they that are LED
[1:02:21] of the spirit they're the sons of God
[1:02:23] there there is leadership for the church
[1:02:26] today Hallelujah there is leadership for
[1:02:28] the sons of God today and the daughters
[1:02:30] of God today if they'll listen listen
[1:02:33] the problem in the Old Testament the
[1:02:34] problem in the New Testament was never a
[1:02:36] lack of God
[1:02:39] speaking it was never oh I should have
[1:02:41] sent a prophet I should have sent the
[1:02:43] word no he said listen morning by
[1:02:45] morning I spoke to you I sent you
[1:02:48] prophets I sent the word the problem is
[1:02:50] never God not speaking the problem is us
[1:02:53] not
[1:02:54] listening so we struggle
[1:02:58] we
[1:02:59] worry we wear ourselves
[1:03:01] out we run from our trouble and we find
[1:03:04] that we tire out a long time before our
[1:03:06] troubles through we get tired then
[1:03:10] finally if we're if we're lucky if we're
[1:03:13] blessed finally we say Lord I just I
[1:03:17] can't handle this and he's sitting there
[1:03:20] I
[1:03:22] know I tried to tell you that months ago
[1:03:24] am I tried tell you that years ago you
[1:03:26] didn't listen I know you can't handle it
[1:03:29] that's why I had to handle it if you
[1:03:32] could handle it you wouldn't have needed
[1:03:37] me the Holy Ghost comes and what happens
[1:03:40] according to the book of Ephesians the
[1:03:41] first chapter you're sealed what's that
[1:03:43] mean you're sealed you're not sealed to
[1:03:45] the next church service you're not
[1:03:46] sealed to the next sensation or the next
[1:03:49] election or the next Revival you're
[1:03:51] sealed under the day of redemption
[1:03:53] because the Holy Ghost is a seal that
[1:03:56] your faith has been accepted you know
[1:03:58] what that means the box car is
[1:04:00] shut you're not putting anything in
[1:04:02] there and nothing's getting out you
[1:04:04] might as well sit down and enjoy the
[1:04:07] ride cuz you're locked in
[1:04:11] baby that's my Homer
[1:04:13] longor baby you're sealed to the
[1:04:17] destination amen Abraham believed God it
[1:04:20] was impeded him for righteousness and
[1:04:22] then afterwards the Covenant of
[1:04:23] circumcision comes amen so so see you
[1:04:26] don't do a certain thing per se but you
[1:04:29] believed and because you believe after
[1:04:32] you believe you're sealed what the Holy
[1:04:35] Spirit have promised amen it's God that
[1:04:37] works in you amen both to Will and to do
[1:04:41] his good pleasure amen see you say well
[1:04:43] I don't have I don't I don't have this
[1:04:45] whatever it's in you if you'll submit to
[1:04:49] it it's a promise it's not a reward amen
[1:04:53] see this is the problem we we try to
[1:04:55] make it a reward and then we get
[1:04:56] frustrated we don't get a reward it's
[1:04:57] not supposed to a reward is I did this
[1:05:00] so God owes me that guess what God don't
[1:05:04] owe you and I
[1:05:06] anything and he's never going to owe us
[1:05:09] anything and when we act like he's going
[1:05:12] to owe us something what we've actually
[1:05:14] done what we've actually done is we've
[1:05:16] insulted or we've Paul would say this
[1:05:19] way in Galatians do we frustrate the
[1:05:20] grace of
[1:05:22] God you imagine God's like hey I did
[1:05:25] this thing for here you go well I'm
[1:05:26] going to do it well I already did it not
[1:05:29] only can you not do it better than me
[1:05:31] you can't do it at
[1:05:32] all you can't save yourself imagine as a
[1:05:36] now we got some parents here amen well I
[1:05:39] did this certain thing with my kids like
[1:05:40] well I'm it's
[1:05:43] frustrating like listen you no hopefully
[1:05:45] you don't do that that's terrible but
[1:05:47] it's FR it frustrates the grace of God
[1:05:50] if righteousness came by the law then
[1:05:53] Jesus died in vain amen listen if there
[1:05:56] is any way for you and I to change our
[1:05:58] station by oursel any way at all even
[1:06:01] for one person then Jesus died in vain
[1:06:04] true amen so it cannot be a
[1:06:08] reward now there are rewards in the
[1:06:10] Bible I'm talking about salvation I'm
[1:06:11] talking about Redemption amen Redemptive
[1:06:13] work cannot be a reward it is only a
[1:06:16] promise to us amen notice the Bible
[1:06:19] because I said this a moment ago it's
[1:06:20] it's God in you now he wills and he does
[1:06:24] his work in you amen it wasn't even your
[1:06:26] willingness it's you submitted it to him
[1:06:29] that's why the scripture says that if
[1:06:31] you've entered into this rest you've
[1:06:33] ceased from your own works it didn't say
[1:06:35] you ceased from Works catch that now
[1:06:38] you've just ceased from your own works
[1:06:41] it's not you amen it's like Paul Paul
[1:06:44] speaks about this he talks about the the
[1:06:46] other Apostles and their labors in the
[1:06:48] gospel he said I labored more abundantly
[1:06:50] than them all amen but yet not me it
[1:06:53] wasn't me the man it was the grace of
[1:06:55] God upon me the grace of God made him
[1:06:58] who he was the grace of God empowered
[1:07:00] him to do this
[1:07:02] amen you know uh let me say it this way
[1:07:05] you you've not ceased from works you
[1:07:06] ceased from your own works that's where
[1:07:08] we struggle our works stop doing what
[1:07:11] you want amen you know I've said this
[1:07:13] for years I always tell people you know
[1:07:15] what let God use you you should let God
[1:07:17] use you that to let means to allow amen
[1:07:19] there's a difference between letting God
[1:07:20] using you and telling God to use
[1:07:22] you amen I've seen this amen well God I
[1:07:26] want you to use me in this ministry God
[1:07:27] I want you to use me in this this God so
[1:07:29] the problem is now you're telling God
[1:07:31] how he has to use you and then when he
[1:07:33] doesn't use you that way or he uses
[1:07:35] somebody else that way now we get
[1:07:37] frustrated well God why do and it causes
[1:07:39] jealousy it causes confusion it causes
[1:07:41] frustration it's it's a whole another
[1:07:43] thing God use me however you want amen
[1:07:47] Lord I will allow myself to be an
[1:07:49] instrument of your righteousness in
[1:07:50] whatever way if you want to do this if
[1:07:52] you want it's up to God because as soon
[1:07:55] as we start telling God how we want him
[1:07:57] to do it amen now that's our works yes
[1:08:00] and we can come back and say look what
[1:08:01] I've done for the Lord I did this and I
[1:08:04] did that and I'm not like so and so I
[1:08:07] don't do this and I do do that I'm
[1:08:09] better than them I'm glad I'm not like
[1:08:11] him oh it's all about your works
[1:08:16] now so we either stumble and fall into
[1:08:19] sin by besetting sin we get puffed up in
[1:08:21] our fleshly minds and we think we're
[1:08:24] more than we really are
[1:08:26] and either way you're in
[1:08:30] trouble you've ceased from your own
[1:08:33] works it's his work we're not saved by
[1:08:36] our works but we are his workmanship
[1:08:38] created unto good works the Bible says
[1:08:40] in Ephesians 2 amen it's Christ in you
[1:08:44] that's why it's resting notice it's not
[1:08:48] sleeping that's what some people do they
[1:08:50] sleep it's not sleeping as the world
[1:08:52] sleeps but it's resting in other words
[1:08:55] rest is an Act of
[1:08:57] Faith it's so counterintuitive to our
[1:08:59] our human thinking that's the point amen
[1:09:02] our human thinking says well if it works
[1:09:04] seven days a week I'll get more done if
[1:09:06] it works six days a week but God says no
[1:09:08] if you'll trust me with that seventh day
[1:09:10] I'll accomplish more in your life then
[1:09:12] you could do in a whole lifetime of your
[1:09:14] own work look it takes a conscious
[1:09:17] effort for us to take our hands off of
[1:09:18] something
[1:09:19] yes that's that's counterintuitive to
[1:09:22] our thinking listen I need to do this if
[1:09:25] I don't do this it won't get done so
[1:09:27] that's a problem you're doing
[1:09:29] itach it I think it was Martin Luther he
[1:09:32] got up and he would pray for an hour in
[1:09:34] the day at the beginning of the day and
[1:09:35] if he had a lot of some some guy came to
[1:09:38] one time because he he said he had he
[1:09:39] had so much to do to this day said I
[1:09:41] have to pray even more and the guy was
[1:09:43] confused says well if you have so much
[1:09:44] more to do why you why are you taking
[1:09:46] more time to pray he said that's why
[1:09:49] amen amen listen if I if I trust it to
[1:09:51] God it'll get done right the first
[1:09:54] time you ever sit there well glory to
[1:09:57] God this is preached about anybody in
[1:09:59] here you ever sit there and you wrestle
[1:10:01] with something you beat your head
[1:10:03] against the wall and you worry and you
[1:10:04] struggle man this is not working out and
[1:10:07] you get done and you finally give up and
[1:10:09] you pray about it and then it works out
[1:10:10] fine five minutes later and you sit
[1:10:13] there and you think to yourself man why
[1:10:17] didn't I pray about that in the first
[1:10:19] place and then we go right out the door
[1:10:23] and do the same thing all over again
[1:10:26] we should have learned our
[1:10:28] lesson praise the Lord I don't I don't
[1:10:30] think Einstein actually said this but
[1:10:32] they commonly attribute this idea that
[1:10:34] if you do the same thing over and over
[1:10:35] again expecting a different result it's
[1:10:37] Insanity anden we forget that we just
[1:10:40] got done praying about that thing that
[1:10:41] worried us for months and we got an
[1:10:43] answer to prayer we walk
[1:10:45] out well glory to
[1:10:48] God see we're not
[1:10:50] resting we're not trusting to God's
[1:10:52] hands but I got to get more done stop
[1:10:55] trying to get it done let God do what he
[1:10:58] wants to
[1:10:59] do Oh
[1:11:02] Glory listen the Jews they asked Jesus
[1:11:04] in they asked him in the gospels because
[1:11:06] they seen him doing all these Mighty
[1:11:08] Works what must we do to do the works of
[1:11:11] God we want to do all these Works what
[1:11:14] must we do Jesus said here's the
[1:11:17] work not works it's just one here's the
[1:11:21] work that you believe on him who the
[1:11:25] father has sent if you just believe God
[1:11:29] will take care of the rest if you just
[1:11:31] submit and obey God is able to furnish
[1:11:34] what you need
[1:11:37] amen amen so we have to labor a
[1:11:42] struggle you have to struggle to rest
[1:11:45] yeah now the older you get you kind of
[1:11:47] understand a little bit man this BET's
[1:11:48] not you know it's not it's not a you
[1:11:50] have to get yourself in a position where
[1:11:52] you're not
[1:11:54] struggling amen amen see we're
[1:11:57] struggling and then we get tired because
[1:12:00] we're not resting
[1:12:01] amen praise the Lord you have to believe
[1:12:05] now see this is the thing believe this
[1:12:08] my English lesson for the day talking to
[1:12:10] my daughter about this she's writing a
[1:12:12] letter believe is a verb it's an action
[1:12:15] word it's something you do faith is a
[1:12:18] noun it's a subject you can have faith
[1:12:22] but if you don't mix the faith if you
[1:12:24] don't mix it in with what you're hearing
[1:12:26] you're not believing it's not doing you
[1:12:28] any good amen your faith without works
[1:12:30] is dead it's not saying you have to do
[1:12:32] Works to be saved he's saying save
[1:12:35] people act out what they believe
[1:12:38] Hallelujah David said I believe
[1:12:40] therefore I've spoke and Paul said we
[1:12:42] also believe that's why we speak my
[1:12:45] works are not saving me my Works come
[1:12:47] out of a life that has been redeemed
[1:12:50] Hallelujah in other words if you're
[1:12:52] believing for something you Orient your
[1:12:54] work words and your actions around that
[1:12:57] you act in a way that that is congruent
[1:13:00] or that lines up with what you're
[1:13:01] believing amen so listen if you're sick
[1:13:04] you say I believe I'm well you act well
[1:13:06] amen praise God he's healing it's not a
[1:13:09] lie it's not a lie it's notop faking it
[1:13:11] till you make it oh praise the Lord I
[1:13:13] hear this a lot well you got to fake it
[1:13:15] till you make it I don't believe in
[1:13:16] faking it till you make it God doesn't
[1:13:17] fake it what I do believe this is what I
[1:13:19] do believe though Abraham called things
[1:13:22] that were not as though they were and
[1:13:25] then they were that's not the same
[1:13:27] because he had a basis for saying it
[1:13:29] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:13:32] for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:13:35] because he had Faith from a God that
[1:13:37] cannot lie he acted in a certain way
[1:13:39] when he knew he was going to have a
[1:13:40] child he's had he had Sarah start making
[1:13:43] booties and get a crib and get the get
[1:13:45] the plans together we're going to have a
[1:13:48] child thank you Lord I heard this years
[1:13:50] ago I was I talking about my first
[1:13:52] mission trip here a few minutes ago
[1:13:54] first time I was getting ready to go
[1:13:55] somewhere I remember I was praying about
[1:13:57] it I was sitting in a church one day and
[1:13:59] this guy was talking about if you have
[1:14:00] faith you act on it he said if you were
[1:14:03] if God had told you you were going to
[1:14:04] preach in different places around the
[1:14:06] world he said I first thing I do is go
[1:14:07] buy a passport I thought I didn't buy a
[1:14:09] passport no wonder I'm sitting here so I
[1:14:12] went bought a passport i' gone a month
[1:14:14] later you act in a way that lines up
[1:14:18] with what you're confessing and if you
[1:14:20] trusted God with a certain thing then
[1:14:22] you're resting because you're letting
[1:14:24] him do it yes listen as soon as you
[1:14:26] start to take a hold of it as soon as
[1:14:28] you start to do your own thing you've
[1:14:30] you've acted outside of a
[1:14:32] manner that believes
[1:14:36] amen so for the believer there they've
[1:14:38] entered into rest in other words you're
[1:14:40] no longer concerned about the outcome
[1:14:43] amen because the outcome is settled all
[1:14:44] the other stuff might go one way or the
[1:14:46] other but the outcome is settled amen
[1:14:49] you as a Believer if you're sealed by
[1:14:52] the Holy Ghost your destination that was
[1:14:53] predetermined it's settled now you might
[1:14:56] go through some things on the way true I
[1:15:00] can guarantee you you're going to go
[1:15:01] through some things on the way there's
[1:15:03] probably things you'll go through on the
[1:15:04] way that you didn't plan for and you're
[1:15:06] sitting there going well if I had known
[1:15:08] that's why God didn't tell you
[1:15:10] maybe but he did tell you what the
[1:15:12] destination is and no matter what you're
[1:15:15] going through this part is secure praise
[1:15:18] God it's settled you don't have to worry
[1:15:21] about that if God's given you the
[1:15:22] witness of it amen the Bible says in
[1:15:25] Hebrews 10 he's quoting the the Old
[1:15:26] Testament Paul says this is the Covenant
[1:15:28] that I will make with them after those
[1:15:29] days sayith the Lord I will put my law
[1:15:31] into their hearts and their minds will I
[1:15:34] write them now notice he puts the law in
[1:15:37] your heart he places it there but he's
[1:15:38] going to write it into your mind that's
[1:15:40] why Romans uh the 12th chapter says you
[1:15:42] have to be renewed amen because this
[1:15:44] thing didn't get redeemed overnight
[1:15:46] that's right this thing wants to the
[1:15:48] carnal mind enmity with God right so you
[1:15:50] know what you have to do you need to
[1:15:52] renew the Mind amen stop thinking about
[1:15:54] the way you think about it amen think
[1:15:57] about the way God says it amen your
[1:16:00] thinking must line up with the word of
[1:16:01] God that's the only way your actions
[1:16:03] will line up with the word of God
[1:16:05] amen amen so he's going to write it in
[1:16:09] your mind and I love this he says you're
[1:16:10] and there sins and iniquities will I
[1:16:14] remember no more well praise the Lord I
[1:16:16] tell you what if if you don't don't got
[1:16:18] any other good news today that's some
[1:16:21] pretty good news listen if I put my law
[1:16:23] in your heart if put my spirit in there
[1:16:26] your sins and your iniquities I will
[1:16:29] remember them no more you might remember
[1:16:32] them every day your life you might
[1:16:34] struggle with it you might you might
[1:16:36] contend with it it might cause you to
[1:16:37] lose sleep but in the mind of God I
[1:16:40] don't remember anymore he forgot it
[1:16:43] you'll go back to God 10 years from now
[1:16:45] oh Lord please forgive me this thing
[1:16:46] that I asked forgiveness for before and
[1:16:48] he'll say I don't know what you're
[1:16:49] talking about I forgot it I don't
[1:16:52] remember it I'm not struggling with it
[1:16:54] so
[1:16:56] you see God's not concerned about your
[1:16:59] destination it's
[1:17:02] settled now Paul takes this and he draws
[1:17:05] a conclusion from this amen he draws a
[1:17:10] conclusion from this the next verse now
[1:17:12] where remission of these is there is no
[1:17:15] more offering for
[1:17:18] sin like what do you mean in other words
[1:17:21] he's not keeping a record of your faults
[1:17:24] listen if you under if you are in
[1:17:27] Covenant with God if you're sealed by
[1:17:29] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've
[1:17:31] been Sanctified through the blood of
[1:17:32] Jesus Christ then he's no longer keeping
[1:17:34] a record of your faults amen he doesn't
[1:17:37] get a new record and start over and have
[1:17:40] to fix it every time amen he he no
[1:17:43] longer imputes it to you amen that's why
[1:17:45] David says blessed is the man think
[1:17:48] about now I didn't put this in my notes
[1:17:49] so I'm doing this top of my head here
[1:17:50] but think about David David he commits
[1:17:53] the probably one of the worst sins his
[1:17:55] life with Bas Sheba he he's going to
[1:17:57] lose this child he's done all this stuff
[1:17:59] and when he gets caught the Prophet The
[1:18:01] Prophet Nathan comes to him and calls
[1:18:02] him out for his sin his adultery and
[1:18:04] having this man murdered he he knows he
[1:18:07] deserves to die he spoke it by his own
[1:18:10] mouth right listen I deserve to die for
[1:18:14] this but what does the prophet Nathan
[1:18:16] say God has already oh
[1:18:19] my even when he didn't want to admit it
[1:18:22] and then he gets caught he's like I
[1:18:23] deserve to die for this I was wrong God
[1:18:26] has already caused this
[1:18:29] sin to pass think about in in the worst
[1:18:32] situation of his life he gets a
[1:18:33] revelation God never even imputed it to
[1:18:35] me I'll I'll reap the consequences of my
[1:18:38] actions I'm gonna I'm G to have trouble
[1:18:41] in my house but as far as the sin issues
[1:18:43] concerned it's already it didn't even
[1:18:45] come to
[1:18:47] David oh help me out somebody listen
[1:18:50] it's no longer even imputed to you
[1:18:53] that's why Paul makes his point if
[1:18:55] there's remission there's no more
[1:18:56] offering that's not that's not this idea
[1:18:59] that you can't be saved the idea is
[1:19:01] there's no offering for you anymore
[1:19:03] because there's no sin to make an
[1:19:04] offering by one sacrifice he has already
[1:19:08] perfected you
[1:19:10] forever you say where you going with
[1:19:12] this the grace of God is so great listen
[1:19:14] because I I dealt with this when I first
[1:19:16] come to the Lord I knew this guy you
[1:19:18] know if you do this thing wrong you know
[1:19:21] you you have a wrong thought you're
[1:19:22] driving down the road you have this
[1:19:23] wrong thought all you get in a car you
[1:19:25] die now you're going to go to hell
[1:19:26] because that thing was unconfessed in
[1:19:28] your life man they don't even come near
[1:19:29] you as a
[1:19:30] Believer you see what I'm saying it's
[1:19:32] not I got to hurry if you have to make
[1:19:35] it right oh praise the Lord I'm trying
[1:19:37] to think this is this is such a great
[1:19:39] thing I hope you catch this amen it's
[1:19:41] not oh I sinned today so I need to hurry
[1:19:43] up and go get forgiveness and give an
[1:19:45] offering and get on the blood again
[1:19:47] before before I I'm I die in sin that's
[1:19:50] not what's up you're already forgiven
[1:19:52] right if you're in Christ you're saying
[1:19:54] brother
[1:19:55] are you saying we shouldn't ask God for
[1:19:56] forgiveness no what I'm saying is you
[1:19:58] shouldn't ask God for forgiveness for
[1:19:59] righteousness
[1:20:02] sake say what do you mean by that listen
[1:20:04] you didn't become unrighteous and need
[1:20:06] to fix that you say you're sorry it's
[1:20:08] like your kids you say you're sorry
[1:20:11] because you're
[1:20:13] sorry if you have to tell your kids to
[1:20:15] say sorry and they get to a certain age
[1:20:18] it doesn't really have the same meaning
[1:20:19] anymore it's like listen I I ask God to
[1:20:22] forgive me because I want the right kind
[1:20:24] of fellowship with God Amen I'm not
[1:20:26] asking him to forgive me for my sins
[1:20:29] because I don't have any
[1:20:31] anymore I oh say brother brother you're
[1:20:36] going to encourage sin in the church by
[1:20:37] doing this well that's funny because you
[1:20:38] know what it did it did the opposite
[1:20:40] with David when David realized his sins
[1:20:42] were remitted he blessed the Lord and
[1:20:44] build him a house he didn't go out and
[1:20:47] say well I guess I'll go get another
[1:20:48] I'll go steal another man's wife and
[1:20:50] I'll do this it it caused the
[1:20:52] opposite the grace of God Drew up the
[1:20:55] goodness of God led him to repentance
[1:20:58] and we're say Don't Preach Grace that
[1:20:59] way you'll enable people to sin listen
[1:21:01] if they want to sin they're going to
[1:21:03] find a way to do it anyway amen what I'm
[1:21:05] telling you is there's liberty for the
[1:21:07] believer I'm not worried about my
[1:21:10] position with God if I'm in Christ it's
[1:21:14] settled amen you make a mistake you have
[1:21:16] a mishap that doesn't change your
[1:21:18] relationship with God
[1:21:20] anymore it's settled
[1:21:22] amen so yeah I think mistakes we all
[1:21:25] make mistakes what I'm telling you is
[1:21:27] it's not imputed to me is sin because I
[1:21:30] have an
[1:21:32] advocate amen there's no offering for it
[1:21:35] well God otherwise he'd have to go slay
[1:21:39] Christ again it's should like the Old
[1:21:41] Testament you have to go get a new
[1:21:42] offering every time no it was settled
[1:21:44] that day at Calvary amen everything
[1:21:46] everything listen every sin you ever
[1:21:48] committed was after he died amen that
[1:21:51] was already settled before you were born
[1:21:52] amen so he can't go so it's not like
[1:21:54] future sins are going to change that
[1:21:58] because all your sins were future sins
[1:22:00] from the day of Calvary so it's not like
[1:22:03] you just knew about the ones that you
[1:22:05] knew
[1:22:07] about praise the
[1:22:11] Lord now your your enemy he's an
[1:22:16] accuser the accuser of the Brethren and
[1:22:19] that's his job amen he'll go and say
[1:22:22] well you did this and you did that that
[1:22:24] and you did this and you did that you
[1:22:26] know what you do you look him say I
[1:22:28] didn't do
[1:22:31] anything I've ceased from my own Works
[1:22:33] listen I know I hope this is okay listen
[1:22:36] Paul says the same thing in Romans 7 he
[1:22:39] says when I want to do good evils
[1:22:40] present the things I would do I don't
[1:22:42] the things I don't want to do I do he
[1:22:45] said therefore there's a law in my
[1:22:46] members the law of my mind wants to
[1:22:48] serve God hopefully that's is that is
[1:22:50] that us today hopefully that's where
[1:22:52] you're at but the law sin and death is
[1:22:55] in my members and it struggles against
[1:22:58] it therefore if I
[1:23:00] sin it's no longer me oh my is Paul
[1:23:05] justifying himself no God Justified him
[1:23:08] it's no longer me it's sin in my members
[1:23:11] in other words can I can I let me spell
[1:23:12] this out that's not the real
[1:23:15] me I'm not getting rid of your
[1:23:17] accountability what I'm saying is but
[1:23:19] that's not who you
[1:23:20] are you're not the hypocrite when you're
[1:23:22] in church repent for what you did you're
[1:23:25] the hypocrite when you did the thing
[1:23:27] amen you're not you're not a wicked
[1:23:29] person trying to get right you're a
[1:23:31] righteous person the devil's trying to
[1:23:33] make Wicked amen listen your
[1:23:36] righteousness is settled in Christ we
[1:23:40] listen he who knew no sin became our sin
[1:23:44] that we might be made the righteousness
[1:23:47] of God in him so you're not just
[1:23:50] righteous as a Believer you are the
[1:23:52] righteousness of God am now tell me when
[1:23:56] the righteousness of God has ever failed
[1:23:58] tell me when the righteousness of God
[1:24:00] has ever been besed or depleted it can't
[1:24:03] it won't amen see if you're in Christ
[1:24:07] that's why it's settled it's a fixed
[1:24:09] position it's like the Northern Star all
[1:24:11] these other things might move around but
[1:24:12] this is fixed this is always in the same
[1:24:14] spot and your position in Christ does
[1:24:16] not change because you had a good day
[1:24:18] today or a bad
[1:24:20] day because you did the right thing or
[1:24:22] whatever it's fixed in Christ amen it's
[1:24:27] settled notice Hebrews we're in the same
[1:24:30] chapter verse 19 having therefore
[1:24:32] Brethren
[1:24:33] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[1:24:36] the blood of Jesus by a New and Living
[1:24:39] Way which he has consecrated for us who
[1:24:43] you do it for us through the veil that
[1:24:45] is to say his flesh having a high priest
[1:24:48] over the house of
[1:24:50] God let us draw near with a True Heart
[1:24:56] see it's no longer the double-minded
[1:24:58] Wishy Wash well it shouldn't be anyway
[1:25:01] the the the scoundrel I'm a sinner but I
[1:25:03] need help from God no that got settled
[1:25:06] amen we're talking about the guy that's
[1:25:07] in Christ let's draw near with a True
[1:25:10] Heart in full
[1:25:13] Assurance thank you in full Assurance of
[1:25:16] Faith having our hearts sprinkled from
[1:25:19] an evil conscience our bodies washed
[1:25:21] with pure water let us hold fast
[1:25:25] the profession of our faith without
[1:25:27] wavering in other words your confession
[1:25:29] your profession doesn't change based on
[1:25:31] the condition you hold fast notice why
[1:25:35] for you are Faith No for he is
[1:25:40] faithful why is it constant it's not
[1:25:42] because of your faithfulness because he
[1:25:46] yes is faithful that promised
[1:25:49] amen why are people filled with
[1:25:51] uncertainty and worry why why are the
[1:25:53] people so tossed out when they're
[1:25:55] supposed to hold fast without wavering
[1:25:58] amen see this is my point this why I lay
[1:26:01] all this out the intellectual mind it
[1:26:03] still is wrestling with the sin question
[1:26:06] and it will wrestle with it every day
[1:26:08] that you're life if you were hoping for
[1:26:09] an end to that good
[1:26:11] luck because the Bible does not spell it
[1:26:14] anywhere that one day your intellectual
[1:26:16] mind will resolve hey I'm sinless
[1:26:19] because listen all the evidence around
[1:26:21] you all the evidence in the mirror
[1:26:23] speaks to the contrary your five sses
[1:26:26] will never declare you righteous in the
[1:26:29] sight of God unless you're deluded I
[1:26:31] mean I know some people think they're
[1:26:32] that righteous they think they're God's
[1:26:33] Gift of the world Amen that's because
[1:26:35] they're deceived but the intellectual
[1:26:37] mind if you understand the scripture and
[1:26:39] you know what sin is in the Bible tells
[1:26:40] you what it is the intellectual mind
[1:26:42] will never look at the circumstances
[1:26:44] around you say hey I'm righteous there's
[1:26:46] no evidence to speak to it amen that's
[1:26:50] what Paul's talking about there's
[1:26:51] there's nothing there that lines up with
[1:26:53] it you're sent Es are still trying to
[1:26:55] decide am I righteous or am I
[1:26:58] unrighteous and it assimilates it
[1:27:00] assimilates new information all the time
[1:27:02] it's comparing itself to others
[1:27:04] comparing itself to all these things
[1:27:06] amen but the spiritual mind notice the
[1:27:09] carnal mind it's
[1:27:11] death but the spiritual mind is life and
[1:27:14] peace it's not just life it's life and
[1:27:16] peace other words that settles it amen
[1:27:18] the spiritual mind it's been purged of
[1:27:21] the conscience of sins it has no
[1:27:23] remembrance of these things things and
[1:27:24] that's why a Christian can't sin because
[1:27:27] the only sin is
[1:27:28] unbelief amen all the other things are
[1:27:31] just attributes of sin they're
[1:27:32] attributes of your unbelief but you
[1:27:34] believe now Believers have this really
[1:27:37] neat ability Believers
[1:27:40] believe they don't
[1:27:42] unbelieve you're not a drunk silver man
[1:27:44] or a black white dog you're a Believer
[1:27:46] Believers believe so no matter what
[1:27:49] mistakes you make no matter what happens
[1:27:51] in your life but I'm a Believer
[1:27:54] my profession I'm holding fast to it
[1:27:58] because he's faithful even when I'm
[1:28:02] not
[1:28:04] amen you can't commit sins you might
[1:28:08] make mistakes but you can't commit sins
[1:28:10] because you've ceased from your Works
[1:28:12] you're not doing anything anyway some of
[1:28:16] us never did but that's a whole another
[1:28:18] Point not not con not condoning laziness
[1:28:22] now but they no longer affect your
[1:28:24] righteous standing this is what I want
[1:28:26] you to catch this say Christianity was
[1:28:27] never meant to be hard it was meant to
[1:28:29] be
[1:28:34] impossible amen it was never meant to be
[1:28:36] hard it was just meant to be impossible
[1:28:38] you say what do you mean well Jesus own
[1:28:40] disciples he's going through these
[1:28:42] situations with the righteous he goes
[1:28:44] through marriage he's finally talks
[1:28:45] about marriage and divorce and you know
[1:28:46] if you divorce Remar this that goes
[1:28:49] through all this with the disciples and
[1:28:50] finally they just throw their hands up
[1:28:51] in you you ever been there well Lord if
[1:28:55] if this is the case who can be saved man
[1:28:58] if it's that tough nobody who can be
[1:29:01] saved that's the
[1:29:03] point that's the
[1:29:05] point yes yes now you get it well if
[1:29:09] this is the case man they thought Jesus
[1:29:12] was going to make it easy for him and he
[1:29:13] comes down he magnifies the law well man
[1:29:15] if you hate your brother without a cause
[1:29:17] you might as well murdered him you even
[1:29:19] look at a woman the wrong way you might
[1:29:20] as well commit adultery well well if
[1:29:24] that's the case who can be
[1:29:26] [Music]
[1:29:28] saved yeah with men this is impossible
[1:29:32] thank you that's that's what I'm looking
[1:29:34] for acknowledge that with you it's
[1:29:37] impossible there is zero possibility of
[1:29:40] your
[1:29:41] success it's not hard it's
[1:29:44] impossible with men it is impossible
[1:29:48] but With God all things are
[1:29:52] possible see we're not not alone if God
[1:29:55] is for us who can be against
[1:29:59] us see the the the what makes the
[1:30:01] difference is who's helping you
[1:30:03] out am man you've not just got a
[1:30:06] billionaire or a good consultant you've
[1:30:08] got the judge of all Heaven and
[1:30:12] Earth he doesn't just do things that are
[1:30:14] impossible he specializes in things that
[1:30:17] are impossible he literally does things
[1:30:19] that are impossible just to do them
[1:30:24] like was there really no other
[1:30:26] route from Egypt to the promised land we
[1:30:31] could go through this
[1:30:32] sea why would we go this way oh you're
[1:30:35] fixing to find out see I'm going to do
[1:30:37] this killing two birds with one stone
[1:30:40] thing not only am I going to make you a
[1:30:42] shortcut the enemy that has tormented
[1:30:45] you and kept you in bondage for 40 years
[1:30:48] I'm going to wipe him out in a day and
[1:30:50] you're never going to see him again
[1:30:52] you'll never deal with it again am God
[1:30:55] takes him pot we're like why would he do
[1:30:56] it that way because he's God and because
[1:30:59] he
[1:31:01] can you know it's like I was talking my
[1:31:03] wife about this a while back you know
[1:31:04] sometimes you pray about something Lord
[1:31:05] what should I do should I do this should
[1:31:07] I do that you know you're looking for
[1:31:09] direction sometimes God's like listen
[1:31:12] just be still just wait
[1:31:16] rest well why shouldn't I do something
[1:31:18] now maybe the solution to your situation
[1:31:23] doesn't exist yet
[1:31:25] yet praise the Lord maybe he's waiting
[1:31:29] to make one listen there was no route
[1:31:33] through the Red Sea but God made one at
[1:31:36] the right time he can make a way where
[1:31:38] there is no
[1:31:39] way you say well we go this way because
[1:31:42] it's the best way I don't even see a way
[1:31:44] that's the point we're not walking by
[1:31:47] sight right oh my my
[1:31:52] am so
[1:31:54] Christ makes it
[1:31:57] easy amen God takes the
[1:32:00] impossible and makes it
[1:32:04] easy listen only Christ can live the
[1:32:07] Christian
[1:32:08] life so the solution is to get Christ in
[1:32:10] your life if Christ is in your heart
[1:32:13] then it's
[1:32:14] easy this message it's not a burden to
[1:32:17] me I don't wake up and look at the Bible
[1:32:20] and
[1:32:21] say I got to pray again
[1:32:24] every day that's such a chore see our
[1:32:28] attitude shows what's what our hearts
[1:32:31] really looking
[1:32:33] at see men make it hard God didn't make
[1:32:37] it hard God made it impossible but then
[1:32:39] he made it
[1:32:40] easy men make it hard with their Creeds
[1:32:42] and their dogmas and their own ideas
[1:32:45] remember Peter he comes they have a
[1:32:47] counsil there uh I think it was in
[1:32:49] Antioch but they come after Peter
[1:32:51] preaches the house of Cornelius
[1:32:54] I it was Jerusalem but he comes and he
[1:32:56] begins to speak about this and and Peter
[1:32:58] makes this point why are we going to
[1:32:59] tempt God by putting a yoke upon the
[1:33:02] neck of these disciples which neither
[1:33:04] our fathers nor we are able to bear in
[1:33:07] other words why are we going to give the
[1:33:08] Gentiles a bunch of
[1:33:09] rules that we can't
[1:33:12] keep notice that's what the Pharisees
[1:33:15] that's what the Jews did we're going to
[1:33:17] put yolks on you and we carry on this
[1:33:19] heavy oh it's so heavy well that's not
[1:33:21] the Yoke Jesus gave they carrying
[1:33:23] somebody else's yoke
[1:33:27] amen oh it's so heavy I can't carry it
[1:33:30] picking up the wrong
[1:33:31] thing why would we now if we're not
[1:33:34] careful we can be that guy too well
[1:33:36] listen you need to live the way I want
[1:33:37] you to live man you don't have to do the
[1:33:39] thing I want amen but you do have to do
[1:33:41] what God wants amen listen if God wants
[1:33:45] it for you it's better for
[1:33:48] you listen now there's nothing in here
[1:33:50] that God compels you to do that's going
[1:33:52] to make your life wor it might seem
[1:33:54] worse it might seem rougher at first but
[1:33:58] I guarantee you like that Red Sea it's
[1:34:00] going to work out better if you just do
[1:34:02] what he said in the first place all
[1:34:04] things work together for
[1:34:06] good to them that love God to them who
[1:34:08] are they called according to his purpose
[1:34:10] amen didn't say it was always going to
[1:34:12] be easy amen didn't promise it ever be
[1:34:15] totally didn't promise you a life absent
[1:34:17] of struggles they promise it be for your
[1:34:19] good
[1:34:20] Amen brother B says this this is in 1956
[1:34:23] the interiew Veil he says he says this
[1:34:25] is what I find about most Christians I
[1:34:26] hate to say it's true but it's true the
[1:34:28] most people that can profess
[1:34:30] Christianity they seem to have a such a
[1:34:31] hard time struggling to hold on I
[1:34:34] believe it's because of a lack of
[1:34:36] correct teaching of the
[1:34:38] Bible see it's your understanding is the
[1:34:40] issue it's not that it is hard you just
[1:34:43] think it's hard because you're taught
[1:34:44] it's hard not saying you but we teach
[1:34:47] ourselves that sometimes honestly we
[1:34:49] we're raised a certain way we look at a
[1:34:51] certain thing you know we get Catholic
[1:34:53] well I need to I need to bear this
[1:34:54] burden I need to suffer this to show God
[1:34:56] I'm Ser you know what if you want to
[1:34:57] show God you're serious about him
[1:34:59] believe his
[1:35:00] word it's believe his word that's simple
[1:35:03] you know you know how you tell your kids
[1:35:05] that you take them seriously you spend
[1:35:06] time with them yes you want I mean you
[1:35:08] want you want God to know that you man I
[1:35:11] I'm I'm taking this seriously spend time
[1:35:14] with
[1:35:16] him I believe it's because of a lack of
[1:35:18] correct teaching of the Bible there is
[1:35:20] no such thing as holding on see your
[1:35:22] premise is wrong I just can't hold on I
[1:35:25] know there's no such thing that's why it
[1:35:28] doesn't
[1:35:29] work he done the holding on yes got get
[1:35:35] a witness in here
[1:35:37] today it wasn't
[1:35:39] you it wasn't your fortitude and your
[1:35:43] spiritual might he held you when you had
[1:35:46] no strength to hold nothing you couldn't
[1:35:49] even hold your head up amen he didn't
[1:35:52] let you go he done the holding on thank
[1:35:56] you Jesus the whole Christian principle
[1:35:58] is based upon rest come unto me all ye
[1:36:02] that labor and are heavy laden I will
[1:36:06] give you rest don't have to worry and
[1:36:08] struggle you're just resting that's all
[1:36:11] given rest you enter into
[1:36:13] peace because the whole thing's finished
[1:36:16] them who he has called he is Justified
[1:36:19] those who he is Justified he's already
[1:36:20] glorified he says scripture quoting
[1:36:22] notice it's nothing that you could do
[1:36:25] amen or what you can do it's what God
[1:36:28] has done for you in Christ you could not
[1:36:31] come to somebody say well I I just quit
[1:36:34] this and I went to seeking God no man
[1:36:36] sought God right man don't seek it's not
[1:36:40] that he can't he just well I mean he
[1:36:42] can't also but he don't in other words
[1:36:44] it's never happened don't look through
[1:36:47] here don't look through the scripture
[1:36:49] don't look through the internet trying
[1:36:50] to find an example oh I found a guy that
[1:36:53] sought first no you
[1:36:55] didn't men don't seek God there's not
[1:36:58] one of us in here and I'll I'll raise my
[1:37:00] hand I was not looking for God I was
[1:37:04] running wanting nothing to do with
[1:37:07] him and if it was any other way it's
[1:37:09] your
[1:37:10] work it was your will
[1:37:14] I men don't see like sheep don't go
[1:37:17] after the shepherd the shepherd has to
[1:37:20] go after them first amen they're not
[1:37:24] tame from the get-go you have to teach
[1:37:26] him
[1:37:28] obedience and no man man don't seek God
[1:37:31] God seeks man the very beginning I love
[1:37:33] it the very beginning of the Garden of
[1:37:35] Eden proved it aam Adam ought Adam ought
[1:37:39] to have been running through the garden
[1:37:41] hollowing father father where are you
[1:37:43] but it was
[1:37:47] God was God going through the
[1:37:49] garden Adam Adam where are
[1:37:55] thou we make God do all the work then we
[1:37:58] want to take the
[1:38:01] credit here he is father or Adam Adam or
[1:38:05] Adam hiding that's the nature of man see
[1:38:08] that's where we're get in trouble I know
[1:38:10] the Bible says this but I'm gonna do my
[1:38:11] own thing I'm gon I'll just hide it hey
[1:38:16] Adam that's the if you got to hide it
[1:38:18] then you probably got some trouble going
[1:38:21] on Jesus said no man come to me except
[1:38:23] the father draws them for brother Ram
[1:38:24] says this again why are people so tossed
[1:38:26] about the Christian faith is based
[1:38:28] solidly upon rest that's right a
[1:38:30] Christian is not tossed about now this
[1:38:33] is the
[1:38:34] ideal I'm not saying this to condemn you
[1:38:36] if you feel tossed about amen I I hope
[1:38:38] you catch this this is what you're
[1:38:40] supposed to look like this is not a hey
[1:38:42] if you're not doing this I'm condemning
[1:38:43] you this is a hey you can have this amen
[1:38:47] this is for you if you will receive it a
[1:38:49] Christian is not tossed about a
[1:38:51] Christian doesn't run from place to C
[1:38:53] place a Christian doesn't fuss and fum
[1:38:55] and worry about
[1:39:00] things that's me what can
[1:39:07] be he says a Christian rests it's all
[1:39:10] over it's all finished for the believer
[1:39:12] at Calvary that's right sickness may
[1:39:16] come and disappointments but the
[1:39:19] Christian is at rest knowing this that
[1:39:22] God is a able to keep that which he has
[1:39:26] performed knowing that no matter what
[1:39:28] the thing is and how it looks there is
[1:39:30] neither sickness sorrow death neither
[1:39:33] starvation or anything that can separate
[1:39:36] us from the love of God that is in Jesus
[1:39:40] Christ amen see brother talks about the
[1:39:43] borderline Believers see that's the
[1:39:44] problem with the Border believer they
[1:39:46] they've got just enough religion to make
[1:39:47] them
[1:39:49] miserable they have just enough to make
[1:39:51] them miserable I know the Bible commands
[1:39:53] this and I to do it and I guess I'll do
[1:39:56] it see you're just at the borderline go
[1:39:59] labor to get into the rest get to this
[1:40:02] place where it's like ah listen Oh Glory
[1:40:04] to God
[1:40:06] Amen in a place where it's
[1:40:09] settled listen it's easy to be settled
[1:40:11] when we're sitting here at
[1:40:13] church temperatures the right
[1:40:15] temperature and we've got the fluffy
[1:40:17] seats and got carpet heyen well you walk
[1:40:21] out of here 10 minutes later and you get
[1:40:22] a phone call oh man my life's in
[1:40:24] shambles man rest it just a minute now
[1:40:28] amen just take it
[1:40:30] easy we take mole Hills and turn them
[1:40:33] into mountains then we wonder why do I
[1:40:36] struggle so much CU you made it that way
[1:40:39] I'm not saying that there's no one here
[1:40:41] today with real struggles I'm telling
[1:40:43] you whatever your struggle is whether
[1:40:44] it's large or small it's all the same to
[1:40:47] God if he can do impossible things he
[1:40:50] can do hard things he can do harder
[1:40:52] things it's all the same if you'll just
[1:40:54] trust God with it
[1:40:57] amen hope somebody gets this today
[1:41:00] listen God God doesn't just love you he
[1:41:03] likes you there's a
[1:41:07] thought he's interested in
[1:41:10] you he's interested in spending time
[1:41:12] listen he's more interested in us than
[1:41:15] most of us act in
[1:41:18] him we do things and if we get time help
[1:41:22] me Lord if we get time we'll get around
[1:41:25] to be an interested in him and he's
[1:41:27] literally done all these things and he's
[1:41:29] just waiting for our
[1:41:31] attention he's got nothing better going
[1:41:34] on
[1:41:36] today than to spend time with us think
[1:41:40] about this he can make anything he can
[1:41:42] do anything and this is number one on
[1:41:44] his list amen amen top priority
[1:41:49] hallelujah boy that ought to make you
[1:41:50] feel good about yourself amen
[1:41:54] listen if you look at your past and your
[1:41:55] history and your inability that will
[1:41:56] make you feel good but if you look at
[1:41:59] what God did for you ought don't make
[1:42:00] you feel 10 foot
[1:42:03] tall I don't have in front of me but
[1:42:05] Charles Spurgeon said something that's
[1:42:06] all right I'm qu quote Charles Spurgeon
[1:42:07] but it's perfect thanks brother got my
[1:42:11] endorsement I forget how he said exactly
[1:42:13] but he makes the point that when I look
[1:42:15] at myself and I look at Humanity It
[1:42:17] seems impossible to me that somebody
[1:42:18] could be saved but when I look at Christ
[1:42:20] and what he's done it seems impossible
[1:42:22] to me that everybody could be
[1:42:23] lost it's all what you're looking at I'm
[1:42:27] not saying that your sin and your
[1:42:28] struggles and your problems don't mean
[1:42:30] nothing what I'm saying is when you look
[1:42:32] at what God has done it's so much
[1:42:34] greater it's so much greater if you
[1:42:37] realize what it is when you look at God
[1:42:38] has done our day what he's declared
[1:42:41] through this message it's so much
[1:42:43] greater amen it eclipses
[1:42:46] it I interested in us behold the Bible
[1:42:52] says what manner of love the father has
[1:42:54] for us that means you can see it
[1:42:57] behold what manner of love the father
[1:43:00] has for us that we should be called the
[1:43:03] sons of God Amen listen it's his good
[1:43:06] pleasure to give us the kingdom Jesus
[1:43:09] endured the cross for the
[1:43:11] joy that was set before him many knows
[1:43:14] the story of of Boaz and Ruth in the
[1:43:16] Book of Ruth Ruth she comes she's you
[1:43:20] know her husband's dead no's like what
[1:43:22] are we going to do we need food she goes
[1:43:24] to the field of Boaz he's a near Kinsman
[1:43:26] and we all know that probably most of us
[1:43:27] know the story but Boaz decides to buy
[1:43:30] this
[1:43:30] field he knows if he buys his field
[1:43:34] he'll get a field but he doesn't buy the
[1:43:35] field because he wants the field he buys
[1:43:36] the field because he wants a wife amen
[1:43:39] God so loved the world he it's not
[1:43:41] because he needs
[1:43:42] mountains like I said at the beginning
[1:43:44] it's not because he needs an ocean it's
[1:43:46] not because he needs waterfront property
[1:43:48] he can make that he buys the field cuz
[1:43:52] he wants the treasure in the field he
[1:43:55] wants you and I he wants a wife he wants
[1:43:58] a a Ruth that's why Boaz buys the field
[1:44:01] that's why God redeems the Earth he can
[1:44:03] make another Earth but he wants the
[1:44:05] people in
[1:44:07] it he wants a bride amen so he goes down
[1:44:10] there to redeem this Ruth she's laid his
[1:44:12] feet and brother B I don't have time to
[1:44:13] unpack all this but you know goes
[1:44:15] through Ruth's four the four stages she
[1:44:18] she's there she decides she serves and
[1:44:20] then finally she rests and then she's
[1:44:22] rewarded it because brother bam talks
[1:44:24] about Boaz he says Boaz goes down what
[1:44:26] did he do he goes down to the gate he
[1:44:27] took the elders went before the gate
[1:44:29] took his shoe off let it be known today
[1:44:33] that I redeem Naomi and all of her
[1:44:35] inheritance he said he got the moabit
[1:44:37] which is Ruth with it when Jesus come
[1:44:40] what did he come to redeem Israel what
[1:44:42] did he do in taking Israel he got the
[1:44:44] Gentile bride see when he took Israel he
[1:44:47] went to his own he had to what was the
[1:44:50] first thing he had to do redeem his own
[1:44:52] and the Gentile church is just a a
[1:44:54] sister to that woman an Israelite Church
[1:44:56] certainly he had to redeem Israel to get
[1:44:59] to
[1:45:00] this and he had to redeem Naomi talking
[1:45:03] about Boaz to get to Ruth his bride now
[1:45:05] what did he do I love this he said
[1:45:07] before he could take her whooo he says
[1:45:09] Glory got a little
[1:45:11] religious he goes to the farm I guess he
[1:45:13] painted it all up he put new rugs on the
[1:45:15] floor he might have built a new house he
[1:45:17] got everything ready and he returned
[1:45:19] back with a corage for the wedding so he
[1:45:21] goes to the elders he does work he buys
[1:45:23] his stuff he fixes doing all this stuff
[1:45:25] what was Ruth
[1:45:27] doing not one
[1:45:33] thing seems a little unfair
[1:45:36] actually not
[1:45:39] one
[1:45:41] resting
[1:45:43] waiting no more
[1:45:46] toils no more
[1:45:49] frustration listen when people are
[1:45:51] tossed about and worried we look at
[1:45:53] politics we look at the world day people
[1:45:54] get all worried about it listen I'm I'm
[1:45:57] happy to stay in boaz's field I don't
[1:46:00] have to go look around from field to
[1:46:01] field I don't have to find some other
[1:46:03] Gleaners the Angels they left enough for
[1:46:05] me just just rest just take it easy I
[1:46:09] love the words of Naomi just rest he
[1:46:11] will not rest till he has finished the
[1:46:13] work till he is
[1:46:15] done I'm I you know it's like I said
[1:46:18] earlier don't
[1:46:20] make don't make prayer refuge for your
[1:46:22] unbel see see this is the problem God's
[1:46:23] our refuge so we we wait till trouble
[1:46:26] comes I better go to prayer maybe if you
[1:46:30] were there in the first
[1:46:33] place maybe if you were praying and rest
[1:46:35] trusted to God you wouldn't have to
[1:46:37] worry about it when it happens amen I
[1:46:41] love this brother I've preached this a
[1:46:43] while and then I heard a brother at our
[1:46:44] church brother Carrie pay talk about
[1:46:45] this I like how he said it you know in
[1:46:47] 1st Samuel 30 David he gets back uh and
[1:46:51] he gets raided he goes back from clag he
[1:46:53] goes there and the the Philistines that
[1:46:55] come they they took their wives they
[1:46:56] took their stuff at Camp they took all
[1:46:58] this stuff and everybody was discouraged
[1:47:00] every even David's trusted men they
[1:47:03] wanted to kill David they wanted to
[1:47:05] Stone him and the Bible says David
[1:47:06] encouraged himself in the Lord amen and
[1:47:10] then he goes and seeks God I love that
[1:47:12] he didn't go to God and say man what am
[1:47:14] I going to do I just uh I love this he
[1:47:18] encouraged himself
[1:47:19] first God's been faithful to me just
[1:47:23] like he did with Saul listen God helped
[1:47:26] me slay a bear he helped me slay a lion
[1:47:29] he helped me slay Giants I've killed
[1:47:32] 10,000
[1:47:33] men by the help of God and he walks into
[1:47:36] prayer God you've been faithful amen God
[1:47:39] I know you've been with me you're a God
[1:47:41] that keeps his promises he didn't go in

[1:47:46] goes in there with a True Heart in full
[1:47:49] Assurance drawn close go God you're the
[1:47:53] same God you said I'd be a king you said
[1:47:57] I'd rain one day and these enemies have
[1:47:59] come God I know you're with me God I'm
[1:48:02] not going to let this discouragement
[1:48:03] keep me down you've been faithful and
[1:48:06] God says go pursue take back what the
[1:48:09] enemy stole from you and he goes down
[1:48:12] there and he takes back his wives he
[1:48:14] takes back his stoil his spoil he takes
[1:48:16] what the enemy took from him and then he
[1:48:18] takes even more he comes out better off
[1:48:22] that he was before the trial
[1:48:25] come oh my amen don't just go and say
[1:48:31] well prayer is my refuge don't just make
[1:48:34] it your last line of defense make it the
[1:48:37] first place you

[1:56:25] be a real settled to be a real faithful
[1:56:28] Christian may we not just be the person
[1:56:30] that looks at others and envies their
[1:56:32] Christian Life and
[1:56:33] testimony that looks at others and says
[1:56:36] what a what a stability they have Lord
[1:56:38] may be a reality I pray for each one of
[1:56:40] us today lord lord it's it's attainable
[1:56:44] it's possible because you made it
[1:56:47] possible to our human ability and our
[1:56:49] eyes it is impossible
[1:56:52] it is Out Of Reach to us but Lord you
[1:56:56] come down your Prophet said there was a
[1:56:59] a great CM between us we've seen it in
[1:57:01] Luke 16 between Abraham and the man that
[1:57:04] was in hell but Lord you not just
[1:57:06] bridged it but you moved it aside you've
[1:57:09] you've broken down the middle wall of
[1:57:11] partition between Jew and Gentile
[1:57:14] between the things that separated us
[1:57:16] you've given us access to the holy place
[1:57:19] we have access today through a high
[1:57:22] priest of our profession Jesus Christ we
[1:57:24] thank you Lord Jesus that we can pray
[1:57:27] and we have an advocacy we have an ear
[1:57:30] with God that our prayers they don't
[1:57:32] just go up into the air
[1:57:34] unheard but your reality and you answer
[1:57:36] prayer and you do
[1:57:39] things that are impossible for us Lord
[1:57:43] we praise and worship and thank you
[1:57:44] today not just for what you've done but
[1:57:47] because of who you are and what it means
[1:57:49] to us to behold and to see
[1:57:52] the love that you have for us that we
[1:57:55] should be called your
[1:57:57] children Lord I can look back in my life
[1:57:59] no doubt many of us can and see where we
[1:58:03] could have been see where we were going
[1:58:06] and to think that you not only spared us
[1:58:09] but you've invited us into your kingdom
[1:58:11] as
[1:58:12] children Lord my
[1:58:14] mind I I can't even grasp that Lord I I
[1:58:18] take it by Faith In My Heart Lord
[1:58:21] there's just it's so beyond beyond our
[1:58:22] own conceptions and our human thinking
[1:58:26] Lord I
[1:58:27] pray may not one of us take that for
[1:58:30] granted
[1:58:31] today it's so easy to gloss over it's so
[1:58:33] easy to overlook we're we're in an age
[1:58:35] of gross Darkness there's trouble on
