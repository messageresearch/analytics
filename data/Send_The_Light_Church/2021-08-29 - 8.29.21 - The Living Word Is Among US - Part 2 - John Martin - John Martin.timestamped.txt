[35:23] who were going to be put to death the
[35:24] next day
[35:26] and it started out by saying confirmed
[35:28] and said
[35:29] well
[35:30] um
[35:32] we had a couple emails come in that uh
[35:36] said that it was a hulk so we sent it
[35:38] back to him and asked him to check it
[35:40] out we
[35:41] hadn't heard back from him but i like
[35:43] how one person had put at the center the
[35:45] email says it's always in order to be
[35:47] praying for our missionaries
[35:50] uh they're out on the front line winning
[35:52] souls and brother adam says it's always
[35:54] the work of the lord and many many many
[35:56] many missionaries have been put to death
[36:00] but
[36:01] we're sorry for uh getting anything
[36:04] across that wasn't totally 100 accurate
[36:06] wasn't our intention but i think you
[36:08] know part of us wants to send any kind
[36:11] of requests like that
[36:13] uh maybe through to brother marty he's
[36:15] uh he can figure
[36:17] i get to finding out brother mike just
[36:19] to see how accurate these are
[36:23] but it's not our intention to do that we
[36:25] were just passing along the information
[36:27] of a brother that
[36:28] has been doing a great work for the lord
[36:32] and uh
[36:33] we have some pictures we want to show
[36:34] you but uh
[36:37] some souls that have been
[36:38] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[36:41] christ our brother continues to work
[36:43] hard for the lord

[37:18] the lord has blessed us with 124 new
[37:21] souls who love the lord and
[37:23] this message of the hour amen
[37:27] i thought that was worth a praise report
[37:30] amen we're grateful to the lord
[37:34] amen
[37:35] is that all of them okay
[37:37] praise the lord we don't know these
[37:39] sisters these but these brothers but
[37:43] uh praise god we're going to meet them
[37:45] one day it's our family
[37:47] look at that isn't that
[37:48] beautiful just one of them is worth ten
[37:51] thousand worlds
[37:52] it's amazing how god can look
[37:55] to the inside of a man and see such
[37:57] value
[37:58] amen
[38:00] we're grateful for our brother for the
[38:02] work that he's doing and for all god's
[38:04] missionaries
[38:05] we've heard a good report from brother
[38:07] rowell that he's doing better amen
[38:11] we want to continue to pray for him and
[38:13] if anybody feels led to help
[38:15] in the support for the medical
[38:18] uh there's a need there as as you are
[38:21] well aware
[38:22] amen that's been written all right let's
[38:24] stand together one other thing i do
[38:26] would like to say about the telegram the
[38:28] telegram was set up not as any kind of
[38:31] social media
[38:35] i i
[38:37] i don't think we're going to go wrong by
[38:39] not
[38:41] by leaving it just for the information
[38:43] that's being given across
[38:45] we all have something to say
[38:47] about everything that's being said
[38:49] whether it's a prayer request hey i want
[38:50] that person to know i'm praying if it's
[38:53] a testimony we want to say you know
[38:54] praise the lord and i'm as guilty as
[38:56] anybody else here
[38:59] but what happens is i think it begins to
[39:01] get stretched and stretched and
[39:02] stretched and then
[39:04] boom something is said that you know
[39:06] just wasn't appropriate
[39:08] and the way i like to try to do it is
[39:11] when i
[39:12] hear something whether it's a prayer
[39:13] request or a testimony i'll send
[39:15] something directly to that person
[39:18] that's good and it it lets them know
[39:20] where you stand you're you're you're
[39:22] praying for them and that's i think
[39:24] that's that's an order
[39:26] but i'd like to try to keep
[39:28] keep it away from the the just the
[39:31] social media thing where everybody's
[39:33] just talking is
[39:35] uh uh uh
[39:36] about it and and again opening the door
[39:39] for something maybe that wasn't quite as
[39:41] edifying is everybody with me on that
[39:43] have you have you witnessed that and
[39:45] seen that i'm not the only one that
[39:47] would be feeling this well hope but
[39:50] i'm thankful for communication i'm
[39:52] thankful for the testimonies and the
[39:54] prayer they let me know i need to get
[39:55] praying right away
[39:57] or to rejoice
[39:59] um
[40:00] and and i'd like to
[40:02] us to to respect that i believe
[40:05] keep it as
[40:06] holy and pure as possible amen
[40:10] amen
[40:12] well
[40:13] turn with me if you would to the book of
[40:15] philippians
[40:16] and
[40:17] we're going to
[40:20] be speaking on part two of the living
[40:22] word is among us
[40:25] and
[40:26] we had part one before brother aaron was
[40:28] there
[40:29] and he preached two amazing services
[40:33] the first one
[40:35] no filter
[40:37] and i believe the lord was speaking to
[40:38] us just to be real
[40:40] be genuine be who you are
[40:42] don't don't don't need to to try to put
[40:45] on anything
[40:46] and then the second message invert
[40:48] always in very so a little
[40:51] sign that we had in our office
[40:53] about always inverting
[40:56] look at things differently
[40:58] if you always think the way you've
[41:00] always thought you're always going to
[41:01] get the same result
[41:04] the bible says be not conform to this
[41:07] world be not conformed to the way that
[41:08] the devil wants us to think but be
[41:10] transformed
[41:12] by the way
[41:13] by renewing your mind by a different way
[41:15] of thinking and that's what our brother
[41:17] brought out i should say that's what the
[41:18] lord brought out to our brother amen
[41:22] and uh
[41:24] i i believe it was just like the icing
[41:26] in the middle of a double stuffed oreo
[41:30] and we're gonna we had part one
[41:33] of the living word is among us and now
[41:35] we're gonna have part two the living
[41:36] words and i believe he the lord just
[41:39] inserted that
[41:40] there
[41:42] the word is with us and i believe god
[41:44] wants us to grow in confidence
[41:48] and just
[41:49] be ourselves
[41:51] and let the word change us because if we
[41:54] just hear a good word and we feel good
[41:57] about it but we don't begin to apply
[41:59] these things in our lives we will never
[42:01] change so we got that hard part to do
[42:04] and that's allow the word to change us
[42:06] amen let's before we begin reading here
[42:08] in verse 1 of uh philippians chapter one
[42:11] let's look to the author
[42:13] our heavenly father
[42:15] lord redeemer today great privilege to
[42:17] be in the kingdom of god
[42:19] we thank you for the day that you
[42:21] you turned our lives around you washed
[42:23] us of our sins
[42:25] you took away our past but today lord
[42:28] we know that we've come short of your
[42:30] glory
[42:32] lord we ask if there be any unbelief
[42:34] amongst us
[42:35] any wrong anything that's displeasing
[42:38] we just ask that you forgive us at this
[42:40] time
[42:41] that you cover us with your blood
[42:44] lord we want to be
[42:46] showered with your holy spirit today
[42:50] bless each and every heart prepare us
[42:52] for this word lord we're not worthy to
[42:54] look upon it
[42:57] for it is a holy word and we're not holy
[42:59] our eyes
[43:00] are not right
[43:03] lord but you can make them right
[43:07] lord you can make a heart right we want
[43:09] to be more like you lord we know that
[43:12] you've called us to this
[43:14] we pray father that you'd give us the
[43:16] revelation of the very intent of you
[43:18] bringing this message to us
[43:20] lord and help us
[43:22] lord that we might have more confidence
[43:24] in you today in this hour that we're
[43:26] living
[43:27] we commit this service and every need
[43:29] now into your hands pray that you'd be
[43:31] with those that are not here those that
[43:32] are live streaming
[43:34] lord we pray a special blessing on our
[43:37] sister kathleen and
[43:39] our sister donna
[43:41] lord those uh
[43:43] lord who are struggling or remember
[43:45] brother roger
[43:47] lord we just pray that you strengthen
[43:49] your bride
[43:51] we love you we thank you for this now
[43:53] for we ask it all in jesus christ's name
[43:55] amen amen philippians chapter one
[43:59] starting with verse number one paul and
[44:01] timotheus the servants of jesus christ
[44:03] to all the saints in jesus christ which
[44:06] are at philippi now i want us all to
[44:08] believe that we're in philippi today
[44:11] with the bishops and the deacons grace
[44:13] be unto you in peace from god our father
[44:16] and from the lord jesus christ
[44:18] i thank my god upon every remembrance of
[44:21] you always in every prayer of mine for
[44:24] you all making requests with joy for
[44:27] your fellowship in the gospel from the
[44:30] first day
[44:31] until now
[44:33] being confident of this very thing that
[44:36] he which had begun a good work in you
[44:38] will perform it until the day of jesus
[44:40] christ amen god bless you may be seated
[44:44] until
[44:46] the return
[44:49] of jesus christ to take us home
[44:51] the holy ghost is going to execute the
[44:54] work that he started in us
[44:58] we know we've begun a good work in us
[45:00] we all can testify of that but too many
[45:02] people
[45:03] are only satisfied with the forgiveness
[45:05] that they've gotten
[45:07] and not concerned about coming to the
[45:09] statue of a perfect man right
[45:12] it's not as big as concern as the
[45:15] initial i i want my sins washed away
[45:18] too many people have lost the interest
[45:20] in god's intentions of why he even
[45:22] started the work in us
[45:24] he wants to finish it amen
[45:28] ephesians chapter 5 verse 26 says that
[45:30] he might sanctify
[45:33] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[45:36] water
[45:37] by the word
[45:39] see the word is living enough to wash us
[45:43] it's alive enough to sanctify us to get
[45:47] us ready to be his wife
[45:50] verse 27 that he might present it to
[45:52] himself a glorious church not having
[45:56] spot or wrinkle or any such thing that
[45:59] it should be holy and without blemish
[46:03] now this is the finished work
[46:09] and we're still here we're still hearing
[46:11] the word
[46:12] so the word is still doing the work
[46:15] now if it was just as simple as well i
[46:17] pray that god would forgive me
[46:19] and it should be done then there would
[46:21] be no need to come and hear the word
[46:23] there'd be no purpose in the word
[46:25] there'd be no purpose in the word
[46:27] washing us
[46:28] but there is a great purpose in the word
[46:31] we have to become one with the word
[46:34] we need to remain confident that the
[46:36] living word is among us every time we
[46:39] set foot in this room
[46:43] it's just not uh some man trying to
[46:46] teach about god it's a living word
[46:49] we heard that we heard that through
[46:51] brother brother aaron the word that that
[46:53] came forth
[46:55] that was the living word and now we got
[46:57] to take that living word and we've got
[46:59] to apply it to our personal lives
[47:01] because
[47:02] the word spoken to us it may help us to
[47:06] tell us something about our past so
[47:08] maybe we might understand it
[47:10] when the word is being preached
[47:12] and the word may tell us about something
[47:15] about our future right
[47:17] but the word is to help us presently
[47:21] and it's us it's about us entering into
[47:24] it
[47:25] and recognizing it amen
[47:28] if there's ever been an hour that our
[47:30] confidence is being tried it's the hour
[47:32] that we're living in today
[47:34] the world is being shaken a great snare
[47:37] the bible says in the last days jesus
[47:39] said men's hearts would be failing for
[47:41] fear right spiritually it is the darkest
[47:44] hour that we've ever been in the most
[47:47] wicked hour the most deceitful hour
[47:51] and satan knows he has but a short time
[47:53] so he's just like ramping it up
[47:56] he's ramping it up
[47:59] the church is being shaken
[48:03] right along with heaven and
[48:04] earth but to the elect
[48:08] they stay humble
[48:11] they remain
[48:13] fortified prayed up building themselves
[48:17] up in the most holy faith because this
[48:20] is what we need to overcome
[48:23] continuing in the things which they have
[48:25] heard
[48:27] and learned and has been assured of of
[48:29] knowing
[48:30] whom thou has learned them the bride
[48:33] knows that her husband is the one that's
[48:35] bringing the word to her
[48:37] she knows where the word's coming from
[48:40] and she has a revelation that the living
[48:42] word is amongst
[48:45] her
[48:46] why were the disciples so bothered
[48:48] because the living word was leaving them
[48:51] right right
[48:53] but he's promised
[48:55] i'm gonna i'm gonna come unto you i'm
[48:57] gonna be with you in the form of the
[48:58] holy spirit
[49:01] and we need to believe the word is
[49:03] amongst us that when we hear the word we
[49:06] become one with that word and we'll have
[49:08] faith for whatever it is that's going on
[49:09] in our life because we have to overcome
[49:13] now no matter how much bad news is
[49:15] floating around the bride is remaining
[49:18] confident
[49:20] that the living word is going to see her
[49:22] through to the rapture
[49:23] she is remaining rapture ready
[49:27] she's remaining rapture ready i'd love
[49:29] to preach a message on that sometime
[49:32] when we come to church we must have a
[49:34] greater expectation
[49:36] not just a slight expectation but we
[49:39] must build this
[49:42] i mean
[49:43] a brother ron he'd get up and he'd say
[49:45] you know i'm i'm getting excited about
[49:47] the new church
[49:49] kind of ramp it up for the new church
[49:51] when we enter in it's like it's like an
[49:53] expectation
[49:55] and if we believe the rapture is right
[49:57] around the corner
[49:58] and we believe that we're ready there
[50:00] should be an expectation
[50:03] david said one thing i've desired that
[50:05] why i seek after that may dwell in the
[50:08] house of the lord all the days of my
[50:09] life he knew god would be there he
[50:12] promised to be there
[50:14] and we need to come with a greater
[50:16] expectation that it's him not man
[50:18] talking about god
[50:24] i know the enemy would like to present
[50:26] his way of looking at church
[50:29] but we must recognize god in the word
[50:34] come on somebody's
[50:36] i need some i don't need some amen but i
[50:39] need you to believe this
[50:41] we must recognize christ is speaking to
[50:44] us personally amen we must understand
[50:46] what it is that he wants us to do with
[50:48] what he's speaking he needs to be more
[50:51] real to us
[50:54] i'm sure it in our lives are
[50:56] personalized we wish that we would
[50:58] recognize god a little bit more amen
[51:00] amen
[51:01] and i think we need to just give him
[51:03] that reverence and respect in his house
[51:05] i made a statement recently in a message
[51:08] planting your potatoes
[51:10] god is alive
[51:12] and our relationship with christ needs
[51:13] to be pulsating with instructions from
[51:15] jesus
[51:18] we need to be hearing what it is that
[51:20] he's speaking amen
[51:23] you know brother brahman says uh we can
[51:24] make him an iron boy i just want jesus
[51:27] for that
[51:28] what about coming to church i need to
[51:29] know what you want me to do lord
[51:32] amen
[51:33] in other words your relationship needs
[51:35] to be hearing from god it's got to start
[51:38] from hearing from god and finally we
[51:41] must follow through with obedience to
[51:43] the living word amen keep it living
[51:46] inside don't let there become some sort
[51:49] of disconnect from what god said and you
[51:51] not following through
[51:53] then it becomes
[51:56] the vein
[51:58] our faith becomes vain
[52:00] our going to church becomes vain
[52:02] it is our responsibility
[52:05] now one of the things that can really
[52:07] shape believers is when they witness
[52:09] somebody else missing the mark
[52:12] it can really rattle someone it can even
[52:15] deflate them
[52:17] can even lose confidence in the lord not
[52:21] knowing what to believe
[52:25] i thought they were elect
[52:27] i thought they were closer to god than
[52:29] that
[52:31] we spend too much time judging in our
[52:33] thoughts who's elect and who's on that
[52:38] just because someone is elect it doesn't
[52:40] mean they're not going to fail
[52:45] they're not going to let you down it
[52:46] doesn't mean they're not going to make
[52:48] some major blunders
[52:50] doesn't mean they're not going to get
[52:52] out of line what it does mean is that
[52:54] they're going to hear the messenger say
[52:56] get back in line when they hear what god
[53:00] says they're going to do it that's what
[53:01] it means
[53:03] there's the difference
[53:05] you don't take it lightly
[53:09] now
[53:10] if i am going to view you today
[53:13] by whether you're alive
[53:16] or you're
[53:19] sleeping
[53:22] now we got this message the living word
[53:24] is amongst us
[53:25] how about having a living bride
[53:27] amongst us
[53:29] let's get let's get into the word
[53:34] i don't think we realize
[53:35] we don't
[53:37] we put too much confidence in a man
[53:41] too much confidence in other people and
[53:43] really not enough confidence in god
[53:46] right i'm not talking about in the
[53:47] ministry because this
[53:51] this ministry is of god
[53:53] amen
[53:55] it is a living word
[53:57] amen
[53:59] and you may
[54:01] question it you may doubt it
[54:04] you may think you have to dissect it and
[54:07] you may not even think it's for you but
[54:08] i guarantee this
[54:10] god is in his word giving it to his
[54:13] bride
[54:14] that is for sure any everything else
[54:18] i could question
[54:23] but either god's in it or he's not
[54:25] because if you have to sit here and
[54:27] dissect everything we need to get into
[54:29] the spirit
[54:30] of what's really supposed to be going on
[54:32] in the message
[54:40] it seems like
[54:42] people want you
[54:44] to put confidence in them when you're
[54:46] talking to them
[54:47] right
[54:48] it almost seems like they're they're
[54:50] looking for you to put confidence in
[54:53] them and really we should be putting
[54:55] confidence in the word
[54:57] in the message of the hour and what god
[54:59] is speaking
[55:00] and amplifying that
[55:04] it's better to trust the lord than put
[55:05] confidence in man
[55:07] that's what the bible says so despite
[55:09] what our brother and sister does or
[55:11] doesn't do god wants our confidence to
[55:13] be in christ amen
[55:15] no matter what happens
[55:19] to be assured that the living word is
[55:22] always among us regardless of what
[55:25] happens
[55:26] now we're told by paul
[55:28] that we should follow him
[55:30] as he followed christ
[55:33] but amen
[55:34] don't always want to be following
[55:37] a human being
[55:41] we don't want
[55:43] to follow
[55:44] brother clifford's example when he was
[55:47] walking on the road to emmaus saying
[55:50] but we trusted
[55:52] i had this experience with christ before
[55:56] but now i'm not trusting
[55:59] we must hold the beginning of our
[56:02] confidence steadfast to the end
[56:05] amen the living word is amongst us he's
[56:08] not going to leave us
[56:12] god will never let you down
[56:14] man will no doubt about it
[56:17] but god doesn't
[56:19] we must learn this every one of us here
[56:22] every man is prone to lies
[56:25] pride
[56:26] arrogancy
[56:28] fail failures shortcomings
[56:32] you will see them and satan will make
[56:34] sure to it that you see them
[56:37] but god wants you to remain confident in
[56:39] him amen amen
[56:41] not
[56:42] man
[56:44] put your trust in the lord
[56:48] if god ever shows you something about
[56:49] somebody just pray for them
[56:54] i'll say i'm going to go a step further
[56:55] if satan ever shows you something about
[56:57] somebody pray for them
[56:59] let god know where you stand
[57:02] don't you ever listen to the devil and
[57:04] say oh yeah i knew it i knew it all
[57:06] along
[57:08] right now don't become a judge of
[57:10] thoughts god has not made us
[57:13] to be naked of a negative bride
[57:17] a positive bride
[57:19] to move forward
[57:21] when jesus said lo
[57:23] i
[57:24] am with you always to the end of the
[57:26] world
[57:28] we need to believe it
[57:30] that is with us
[57:31] to the end
[57:33] not until
[57:36] i did trust i don't want that testimony
[57:39] i want the testimony of my trust
[57:41] it doesn't matter if i failed it doesn't
[57:43] matter who fails what matters is i trust
[57:46] the living word is amongst us
[57:50] i believe he's here
[57:52] not in some dead formality either
[57:56] but a living word
[57:59] now the holy ghost
[58:00] is the living word
[58:02] amen think about that
[58:04] the holy ghost is the living word
[58:07] that's why it's important to get
[58:08] connected with the living word and not
[58:11] just a dead letter not just some words
[58:13] written
[58:14] in here
[58:15] it needs to become real to us
[58:19] now he's here to continue the work he
[58:21] started
[58:22] inside of us
[58:24] and we need to remain
[58:26] confident or convinced of this very
[58:28] thing that he which had begun a good
[58:32] uh a good work
[58:34] will execute it
[58:36] or fulfill the work that he started
[58:39] until the day of jesus christ
[58:42] he's just continuing that's what our
[58:44] excitement should be when we come to
[58:46] church that god is going to work in us
[58:51] god's intentions are to build our
[58:53] character
[58:55] it's the only thing that we can take
[58:57] with us to heaven our intentions might
[58:59] be to build a great
[59:03] to empire some life to build
[59:06] uh something that we want down here
[59:09] but god's intentions is to build our
[59:11] character
[59:14] now since character is not a gift
[59:17] but it's a victory
[59:18] decisions need to be made by you
[59:23] when you're in the middle of your trials
[59:26] amen that's why it's important when we
[59:28] come here that we hear personally from
[59:30] god we ought to walk out of here every
[59:32] one of us and say this is what god spoke
[59:34] to me
[59:35] i don't know what he spoke to you but
[59:36] this is what god spoke to me
[59:39] and if we're not there we need to be
[59:41] praying constantly god i want to hear
[59:42] from you i want to hear from you or
[59:44] coming to churches in vain
[59:46] amen
[59:49] it's made to be a living word
[59:52] philippians chapter 2 verse 12.
[59:54] so god
[59:56] speaking the word speaking to us on the
[59:59] inside you know when god speaks to my
[1:00:01] heart
[1:00:02] no one else in the world no one else in
[1:00:05] the world
[1:00:06] or in the room may even catch it
[1:00:09] that's how personal it is
[1:00:12] god don't want to blabber everything
[1:00:14] right that he's doing with you right
[1:00:16] it's personal that's what makes it so
[1:00:18] beautiful amen
[1:00:20] philippians chapter 2 verse 12 wherefore
[1:00:22] my beloved as you've always obeyed not
[1:00:25] my presence only
[1:00:26] but now much more in my absence work out
[1:00:29] your own salvation with fear and
[1:00:31] trembling
[1:00:32] for it is god which worketh in you
[1:00:36] in you
[1:00:40] both
[1:00:41] to execute his will
[1:00:43] to will and to do of his good pleasure
[1:00:49] that's what he's interested in amen
[1:00:52] he's interested in you doing what he
[1:00:54] wants you to do
[1:00:56] so when you come to church and you're
[1:00:58] hearing the word being preached and it
[1:01:00] may not feel always uh you know good
[1:01:05] do all things without murmuring
[1:01:08] and
[1:01:08] disputings don't just say well i guess i
[1:01:11] gotta do it
[1:01:15] i'll do it but you know my heart's not
[1:01:17] in it
[1:01:23] do it without murmuring do it without
[1:01:25] disputings why that ye may be blameless
[1:01:29] it's okay
[1:01:31] when god tells you to stop doing this or
[1:01:33] start doing this it's okay there's
[1:01:35] nothing wrong with it you still will be
[1:01:37] blameless if you do what he says but if
[1:01:40] you stop to murmur you stop to complain
[1:01:43] you are not blameless
[1:01:46] amen that's right
[1:01:48] that ye may be blameless and
[1:01:50] harmless
[1:01:52] like you're not afraid that that person
[1:01:55] can hurt you
[1:01:57] blameless and harmless the sons of god
[1:01:59] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[1:02:03] and perverse nation or we got one of
[1:02:06] those don't we among whom you shine as
[1:02:09] lights in the world
[1:02:11] holding forth the word of life that i
[1:02:14] may rejoice in the day of christ that i
[1:02:17] have not run in vain neither labored in
[1:02:20] vain it's the end result that god is
[1:02:22] looking at
[1:02:24] he sees this as the finished result
[1:02:27] he tells us
[1:02:29] i'm going to give you an expected end
[1:02:32] what we need to do is just do our part
[1:02:34] in the middle
[1:02:35] do as he tells us to do
[1:02:38] so when we come to church
[1:02:40] we come to hear from god and when we
[1:02:42] hear from god our faith grows right
[1:02:46] but we need to hear god speak to us
[1:02:48] personally
[1:02:50] that's the only way we're going to get
[1:02:51] faith
[1:02:52] if we just hear outwardly and we say
[1:02:54] yeah i agree with it
[1:02:57] no faith is going to come from that
[1:03:00] we've got to desperately get in tune
[1:03:02] with him
[1:03:03] so like the two men that came out of
[1:03:05] them
[1:03:06] a message that brother branham was
[1:03:07] preaching
[1:03:08] and one come out and he said
[1:03:11] that preacher called me a a chicken
[1:03:15] or a buzzard
[1:03:17] maybe both i don't know
[1:03:20] and the other one is are you serious he
[1:03:22] called me an eagle
[1:03:24] same message right
[1:03:27] just where the heart is at
[1:03:29] where's that what are you going to
[1:03:30] believe
[1:03:31] you've got to believe your bride
[1:03:34] and the real evidence is you take the
[1:03:36] word and you do it you follow it you
[1:03:38] live it you come back to church and
[1:03:40] instead of talking about everything else
[1:03:42] you talk about what god did for you in
[1:03:44] your home the things that are changing
[1:03:46] in your life that you're becoming more
[1:03:48] in his image that's what the word is for
[1:03:50] that's what church is about
[1:03:56] faith cometh by hearing
[1:04:00] and hearing by the word of god
[1:04:02] it's god speaking to us personally and
[1:04:05] not collectively right
[1:04:08] not collectively he just he's not going
[1:04:09] to give us a revelation collectively
[1:04:11] brother branson says god deals with the
[1:04:13] gentiles as individuals
[1:04:16] so we we sit in church we hear all the
[1:04:18] same word but everybody obviously
[1:04:20] everybody's heart is not in the same
[1:04:22] spot
[1:04:24] and the best thing we could do is get
[1:04:26] good ground
[1:04:28] just get good ground that the word fall
[1:04:30] on good ground amen
[1:04:33] this is important brother brahm said god
[1:04:35] is not obligated to give you anything
[1:04:37] more if you haven't walked in the light
[1:04:39] that he's already given you i want you
[1:04:41] to think about this statement for a
[1:04:42] moment why would god withhold back
[1:04:44] giving you some more light
[1:04:47] when he wants you to walk in the light
[1:04:49] when he wants you to to walk in the
[1:04:51] fullness like why would he says you know
[1:04:53] i'm not going to give him anything more
[1:04:56] can you imagine giving your child
[1:05:00] the
[1:05:00] the job of taking out the garbage
[1:05:03] don't want to do it but you're going to
[1:05:05] hand the keys to your car
[1:05:10] so
[1:05:11] we can see
[1:05:12] god
[1:05:15] isn't just going to keep giving us new
[1:05:17] information just because we come to
[1:05:19] church well he may give us new
[1:05:20] information but he's not going to give
[1:05:22] us
[1:05:22] more revelation
[1:05:26] we've got to walk in the light
[1:05:29] as he is in the light
[1:05:31] and then we have fellowship
[1:05:33] with the lord amen
[1:05:36] god wants to see us love him first with
[1:05:39] the first light that he gave us if you
[1:05:41] love me keep my commandments
[1:05:43] so when he gives us something to do
[1:05:45] we've got to start expressing our love
[1:05:47] to god
[1:05:48] in the message the way to have
[1:05:50] fellowship brother graham says the only
[1:05:51] way he can have faith is to have love
[1:05:53] first he love produces faith
[1:05:57] so it's really important when we come to
[1:05:58] church that we're coming with love
[1:06:01] we all come to church we want faith we
[1:06:03] want the word to give us faith we want
[1:06:04] to we want to build ourselves from that
[1:06:06] faith we wanted that preaching to give
[1:06:08] us faith but you know what we need to
[1:06:10] have love for that word we need to have
[1:06:13] love for that word in order for it to
[1:06:15] produce faith amen
[1:06:22] i want you to ask yourself the question
[1:06:24] when you come to church
[1:06:26] are you coming
[1:06:28] why are you coming
[1:06:31] are you coming with the fear of the lord
[1:06:33] are you coming to please the lord that
[1:06:35] you just you want to hear from him what
[1:06:37] he wants you to do and that you are
[1:06:39] really dedicated to go out and doing it
[1:06:41] no matter what he says
[1:06:46] are you coming to work out your
[1:06:47] salvation or do you have it sold up in a
[1:06:50] bag
[1:06:52] are you coming with fear and trembling i
[1:06:54] could be wrong about things
[1:06:57] see i i don't think we could come humble
[1:07:00] enough to church
[1:07:02] i don't think we could come broken
[1:07:04] enough
[1:07:06] we all want to come
[1:07:08] and we want god to bless us we want him
[1:07:09] to encourage us and strengthen us lift
[1:07:12] us up
[1:07:13] but too often our spirits are proud
[1:07:17] and how can god deal with that
[1:07:19] right amen
[1:07:20] unwilling to humble ourselves
[1:07:24] so how can we expect faith to get a hold
[1:07:26] and grow in our lives when that love
[1:07:28] isn't there
[1:07:30] so we've got to to be willing to let go
[1:07:33] of that old nature that's kind of been
[1:07:35] standing in the way of of of the love
[1:07:38] relationship
[1:07:39] because it it's it's not about
[1:07:42] it's not about getting information to
[1:07:43] make a rapture
[1:07:47] it's about a love relationship this
[1:07:49] whole thing everything from the moment
[1:07:51] that god taught you what he had in mind
[1:07:53] was a love relationship
[1:07:57] when we get to heaven
[1:07:58] you know a lot of times
[1:08:00] people especially now in this age
[1:08:03] people look at relationships
[1:08:06] so much different than god does
[1:08:10] in other words you you you live together
[1:08:13] and you just you you take advantage of
[1:08:15] the other person whatever you get out of
[1:08:16] them
[1:08:17] right that's it
[1:08:19] and people are satisfied going through
[1:08:20] life like that
[1:08:22] it's the truth
[1:08:24] but god
[1:08:25] is not interested in that
[1:08:27] he wants her heart
[1:08:31] and so it's part of the relationship
[1:08:32] from the time that he calls you to the
[1:08:34] time that we go on the rapture it's all
[1:08:36] going to be about relationship right
[1:08:38] that's true
[1:08:40] so everything that you hear god's going
[1:08:42] to be streaming at your heart yeah you
[1:08:43] may not feel like doing it may be hard
[1:08:45] for your flesh but it's the living word
[1:08:48] is amongst us and he's calling us up
[1:08:50] higher to do that because if you follow
[1:08:52] that god may bless you with just
[1:08:54] something greater
[1:08:55] amen
[1:08:57] and
[1:08:58] we just never know what god will do amen
[1:09:02] but the scripture says i dwell in the
[1:09:03] high and holy place with him also that
[1:09:05] is of a contrite humble spirit to revive
[1:09:08] the spirit of the humble truth to revive
[1:09:10] the heart of the contrite ones so he
[1:09:12] doesn't dwell with the needy
[1:09:16] that's not what the scripture says
[1:09:18] we all got needs
[1:09:20] the whole world's got needs
[1:09:22] but he dwells with the humble
[1:09:25] and that's what we need to become
[1:09:27] we need just to knock that spirit of
[1:09:29] pride off of us say get it behind get
[1:09:32] off me satan get behind me saying get
[1:09:34] out of my thought get out of my mind
[1:09:36] amen amen and just submit yourself
[1:09:39] humbly to the word of god god will bless
[1:09:41] you for that
[1:09:44] always
[1:09:45] put
[1:09:46] your love for god first when you enter
[1:09:49] the doors
[1:09:50] put your love for god first
[1:09:53] prove the sincerity of your love for god
[1:09:56] by laying aside everything
[1:09:59] until you get perfect love amen i'm sure
[1:10:02] there's things in my life that i got
[1:10:04] last sight
[1:10:05] is there things
[1:10:07] in your life that you need light aside
[1:10:08] okay
[1:10:09] it's hard to lay those things aside
[1:10:11] that's why they're still there
[1:10:14] so what we need to do is be executing
[1:10:17] lord i need your help
[1:10:19] actually executing the humility that god
[1:10:22] wants to see in this he said i dwell
[1:10:24] with the humble with the broken with the
[1:10:26] contrite
[1:10:29] the whole world
[1:10:31] is broken they're just getting harder
[1:10:33] and harder
[1:10:35] but they're not humble in this house
[1:10:36] before the lord that's the difference
[1:10:39] the same son that made pharaoh hard as a
[1:10:42] rock humbled moses
[1:10:47] it may take 40 years
[1:10:51] you might have to
[1:10:52] work with somebody with a hot tempered
[1:10:55] yeah
[1:10:55] notice i didn't say you know husband or
[1:10:58] wife
[1:11:01] but reality god is working
[1:11:04] on our character
[1:11:05] amen we must remain confident despite
[1:11:08] whatever the lord says to us in church
[1:11:11] remain
[1:11:12] confident the living word is amongst us
[1:11:14] and now sometimes we can get so much in
[1:11:16] the flesh that oh i don't like what's
[1:11:18] being said
[1:11:21] or we might just do a cold formal amen
[1:11:26] either way our hearts not in it
[1:11:29] and our heart needs to get into it
[1:11:31] because this whole thing is between you
[1:11:33] and god any between you and the church
[1:11:36] between you and john martin
[1:11:39] it's between you and god
[1:11:42] most of the time i'll be honest with you
[1:11:43] i have no idea what god's doing
[1:11:46] brother john i don't think i want to
[1:11:48] stand and listen to you as a pastor tell
[1:11:51] me you don't know what's going on
[1:11:53] well i'm sorry i'm not building the
[1:11:55] church
[1:11:57] god don't have to answer to me
[1:12:01] the more we get
[1:12:07] the more we come to
[1:12:09] the conclusion
[1:12:10] i'm just going to do what he tells me to
[1:12:12] do
[1:12:13] and not try to figure things out
[1:12:15] the better this train is going to get
[1:12:16] down the track
[1:12:19] the faster we're going to get to the
[1:12:21] statue of a perfect man
[1:12:24] we must remain confident for it is god
[1:12:27] which worketh in you both to will and to
[1:12:29] do of his good pleasure so do everything
[1:12:31] that he tells you to do without
[1:12:33] murmurings without disputing we ought to
[1:12:36] be rejoicing in the fact that the living
[1:12:38] word is amongst us
[1:12:39] it's okay that he he brought something
[1:12:42] up to my heart and i'll be honest with
[1:12:43] you i never ever ever ever ever ever
[1:12:45] ever
[1:12:46] for a billion years would never want to
[1:12:48] know anything
[1:12:50] that god brings up to another human
[1:12:52] being
[1:12:53] in my life i never want to be aware of
[1:12:55] it
[1:12:56] i don't
[1:12:59] now
[1:12:59] if god uses us that's fine
[1:13:02] but i don't know about it it's
[1:13:04] it's an individual affair good or bad
[1:13:08] it's individual it's between god and you
[1:13:11] hebrews chapter 13 verse 5 says hebrews
[1:13:15] chapter 13 verse 5 let your conversation
[1:13:18] be without
[1:13:20] i
[1:13:21] want
[1:13:25] and be content
[1:13:28] with such things as you
[1:13:30] have
[1:13:32] if you're content with what you have
[1:13:36] it's easy for you to obey
[1:13:40] it's easy to lay aside everything and
[1:13:42] get perfect love
[1:13:44] there's too much i'm not content
[1:13:47] it's true
[1:13:48] that's why you got so many people going
[1:13:50] from church to church
[1:13:53] trying this one trying that one
[1:13:56] there's just no confidence
[1:13:59] that god is with them despite
[1:14:01] imperfections
[1:14:03] in a church
[1:14:05] it's true
[1:14:06] well i don't agree with this i don't
[1:14:07] agree with that i don't think there's a
[1:14:09] church in the world that's as perfect as
[1:14:10] you think it ought to be
[1:14:14] but when you can anchor that your will
[1:14:17] god told you to be
[1:14:19] when you can bloom where you're planted
[1:14:21] right
[1:14:26] god may be using you there for just one
[1:14:27] soul
[1:14:32] be content with such things as you have
[1:14:33] for he hath said i will never leave thee
[1:14:38] nor forsake thee
[1:14:40] so it doesn't matter what you're going
[1:14:42] through so we may boldly say the lord is
[1:14:45] my helper i will not fear what man shall
[1:14:49] do unto me i'm not afraid of some human
[1:14:52] being failing right in front of me
[1:14:55] that's not going to affect me
[1:14:58] i'm not going to be moved
[1:15:01] it's better to have confidence in the
[1:15:02] lord
[1:15:04] it's better to trust the lord and put
[1:15:05] your confidence in man
[1:15:08] i will boldly say the living word is
[1:15:12] amongst us
[1:15:14] we need to boldly say i'm going to meet
[1:15:16] god when i come to church
[1:15:19] that i believe the living wordism i can
[1:15:23] boldly say that isn't not john martin
[1:15:26] can you boldly say that
[1:15:31] can you boldly say uh that wasn't aaron
[1:15:34] preaching that was
[1:15:36] god when you're listening to those tapes
[1:15:39] can you boldly say that is not brother
[1:15:41] branham that's god
[1:15:43] that's god in a man called william
[1:15:45] branham
[1:15:46] but the voice it's the voice of god it's
[1:15:48] the spirit whatever words
[1:15:52] that god uses
[1:15:54] whatever instrument god uses
[1:15:57] is god still speaking
[1:16:01] you need to have confidence in that god
[1:16:03] don't want you
[1:16:08] to be thinking it's a man ever
[1:16:11] why that he's got to lower himself
[1:16:14] to share his glory with man
[1:16:16] god's not going to do that
[1:16:18] if this whole thing is god
[1:16:20] it's god in you it's god and your
[1:16:22] brothers god and your sister
[1:16:24] it's god in you
[1:16:27] i will remain confident of this very
[1:16:31] thing that he which had begun a good
[1:16:33] work in me
[1:16:35] will execute it until the day of jesus
[1:16:37] christ verse seven so remember them
[1:16:40] which have the rule over you who have
[1:16:42] spoken unto you the word of god whose
[1:16:45] faith
[1:16:46] follow
[1:16:47] consider the end of their conversation
[1:16:51] so do you see the life of christ on
[1:16:52] display in somebody's life
[1:16:55] because this is what's matter it doesn't
[1:16:57] matter
[1:16:58] how many
[1:16:59] it doesn't matter can i pick on you for
[1:17:01] just a second it doesn't matter if
[1:17:03] brother mark says jesus christ is with
[1:17:05] me
[1:17:07] consider the end of brother mark
[1:17:10] conversation yes
[1:17:12] consider the life that he's living
[1:17:16] because
[1:17:17] hebrews 13 8 says that jesus christ is
[1:17:20] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:17:25] the word is the same
[1:17:27] so if an angel
[1:17:28] or a minister or anybody come preaching
[1:17:31] any other gospel than what's already
[1:17:33] been preached let him be accursed
[1:17:37] now i've heard from two different
[1:17:39] sources here just here of late how much
[1:17:43] of a wrong spirit
[1:17:45] there has been in this message
[1:17:49] maybe saying the same words
[1:17:52] but with the different agendas
[1:17:54] and to me
[1:17:56] when i first heard the prophet
[1:17:58] there was a spirit that came with that
[1:18:00] word
[1:18:03] a spirit
[1:18:04] and we need the spirit of this message
[1:18:08] amen
[1:18:10] not just the words or what we think is
[1:18:12] the revelation but the true revelation
[1:18:15] is going to be manifested in the spirit
[1:18:17] in which it was brought
[1:18:19] amen
[1:18:20] god is the same amen
[1:18:23] and we need to be performing the same
[1:18:26] devotion to god the same word same
[1:18:28] laying down your life one for another
[1:18:30] amen do whatever you got to do whatever
[1:18:33] whatever god tells you to do you just do
[1:18:35] it
[1:18:37] amen
[1:18:39] this is important
[1:18:41] as we are becoming more bold to believe
[1:18:44] and to say that the living word is among
[1:18:46] us
[1:18:47] we must also bear in mind that our
[1:18:49] brothers and our sisters are still human
[1:18:55] they're
[1:18:56] they're still building their
[1:18:57] relationship with the lord
[1:18:59] right
[1:19:00] so they're going to make mistakes
[1:19:01] they're going to fall they're going to
[1:19:03] that doesn't mean that the living war is
[1:19:05] not amongst us because we see it so
[1:19:08] maintain the balance and i think that's
[1:19:11] what jesus was trying to tell us he says
[1:19:13] you know why are you so worried about
[1:19:14] your brother's fault when you've got a
[1:19:16] like a much huger problem in your life
[1:19:19] much huger
[1:19:21] take care of your problem and then
[1:19:23] you'll know how to take care of it it
[1:19:25] doesn't mean you know what that really
[1:19:26] means when you take care of your problem
[1:19:28] you will be so gracious in helping your
[1:19:31] brother you will know how to wash their
[1:19:33] feet it doesn't mean you'll know how to
[1:19:35] poke them in the eye and prove that
[1:19:37] they're so wrong
[1:19:39] but you'll be able to live that that
[1:19:41] life of of christ
[1:19:44] with the spirit of meekness
[1:19:49] so don't be moved don't be bothered when
[1:19:51] you see your sister or your brother
[1:19:53] falter in the days to come
[1:19:55] don't be moved remain confident god's
[1:19:57] still with us doesn't mean well that
[1:20:00] happened behind the pulpit it doesn't
[1:20:01] matter
[1:20:02] it doesn't matter
[1:20:04] you know the flesh can get in there
[1:20:06] anytime
[1:20:13] that's why we need to pray for the
[1:20:14] ministry amen amen we need we need to
[1:20:17] pray a hedge of protection around this
[1:20:20] this this this is the heart of why we
[1:20:23] come
[1:20:25] you know we're
[1:20:27] this it's really not the man right
[1:20:29] because god's got a five-fold ministry
[1:20:32] but it's really
[1:20:34] this god using the vessels of the
[1:20:36] fivefold ministry to bring us the word
[1:20:40] amen so we need to continue praying one
[1:20:43] for another
[1:20:45] we're always prone to fail one another
[1:20:49] but the living word will never fail us
[1:20:52] we can have confidence in god's word
[1:20:54] it's not about me it's not even about
[1:20:57] having to prove that god is with me
[1:21:01] it's not about having to prove anybody
[1:21:03] anything
[1:21:05] it's about you believing that god is
[1:21:06] with you
[1:21:08] right in church
[1:21:10] that the living word is among us
[1:21:14] and that it is going to speak to us what
[1:21:16] it wants it may not be what we want to
[1:21:18] hear how many times let me ask you a
[1:21:20] question
[1:21:21] you that come to church and you just
[1:21:23] really really want to hear god talk to
[1:21:25] you about something
[1:21:30] how many times did you ever sit down
[1:21:32] with your child to correct them about
[1:21:34] something and your child stood up and
[1:21:35] said this is not what i want you to talk
[1:21:37] to me about
[1:21:38] right
[1:21:41] it doesn't matter what you'd want me to
[1:21:43] talk to you about i'm talking to you
[1:21:45] about what i see
[1:21:47] [Music]
[1:21:48] and god is allowed to come here and be
[1:21:50] god
[1:21:52] he's the potter
[1:21:53] we're the clay
[1:21:54] so we got to get our eyes off of well
[1:21:57] this is john this is god this is jud
[1:22:03] have confidence in god
[1:22:06] it's about your maturity and believing
[1:22:08] in god joshua and caleb remained
[1:22:11] confident that the living word was among
[1:22:13] them
[1:22:15] through 45 years of a church that was so
[1:22:17] messed up
[1:22:19] that the majority of the people were
[1:22:22] make believers
[1:22:24] they believe god part way
[1:22:26] can you imagine being a church for 45
[1:22:28] years
[1:22:32] with
[1:22:33] people who would not take god all the
[1:22:35] way
[1:22:36] but they remain confident that god was
[1:22:39] with them
[1:22:40] despite
[1:22:41] where everybody else was
[1:22:43] the children of israel were led by god a
[1:22:46] pillar of fire by night and a cloud by
[1:22:49] day the bible says the pillar went
[1:22:51] before them and behind them in other
[1:22:53] words the word was all around them
[1:22:57] they the the living word was among them
[1:23:02] they were eating
[1:23:03] the living manna daily they were
[1:23:06] drinking from the spiritual living rock
[1:23:09] of christ that followed them the bible
[1:23:11] says
[1:23:12] the bible tells us that when the
[1:23:14] children of israel came out of egypt
[1:23:16] they came out of egypt as a mixed group
[1:23:21] some were unbelievers
[1:23:23] a whole lot of them were borderline
[1:23:25] believers
[1:23:26] and a few of them
[1:23:28] were full gospel full-time continue in
[1:23:31] the word all the way believers
[1:23:35] that's the mixed group
[1:23:39] now
[1:23:40] when joshua and caleb got up there and
[1:23:42] they said we're more than able to take
[1:23:44] the land
[1:23:46] it was spoken to everybody
[1:23:48] but it was only received
[1:23:52] by those who believed it
[1:23:54] think about that
[1:23:58] despite the living word was among them
[1:24:02] they were not in one mind and one accord
[1:24:06] they were they were mixed up about the
[1:24:08] situation
[1:24:10] the bible says god said i heard the cry
[1:24:13] on my people and i have come down to
[1:24:15] deliver them now this is why they were
[1:24:17] still in egypt
[1:24:19] now god remained faithful despite of
[1:24:21] their unfaithfulness
[1:24:23] and we learned in jude chapter one verse
[1:24:25] five i will therefore put you in
[1:24:27] remembrance though you once learned this
[1:24:29] how that the lord having saved the
[1:24:30] people of the land of egypt afterwards
[1:24:32] he destroyed them that believed not
[1:24:36] now these were the unbelievers and the
[1:24:38] borderline believers
[1:24:41] now the thing about a borderline
[1:24:42] believer they believe all the way up to
[1:24:45] the receiving of the holy ghost
[1:24:48] if i could say it like this all the way
[1:24:50] up to the complete nature change
[1:24:53] amen
[1:24:55] because justification is a part of the
[1:24:57] holy ghost soul is sanctification but
[1:25:00] the believer goes all the way to a
[1:25:02] nature change
[1:25:03] amen
[1:25:06] i'll say send the light we must continue
[1:25:10] in this word until our nature is
[1:25:13] completely changed
[1:25:15] hunger to hear what god wants you to do
[1:25:17] because it's your obedience that's going
[1:25:20] to bring the nature change
[1:25:23] draw nigh to god he draws nigh to you
[1:25:28] you
[1:25:29] obedient to this one little thing that
[1:25:30] really doesn't have anything to do what
[1:25:32] you think is really important
[1:25:34] has everything to do with god blessing
[1:25:37] you with a nature change
[1:25:41] life was too hard for the international
[1:25:43] borderline believers
[1:25:46] that what
[1:25:47] most people
[1:25:49] would think
[1:25:52] most people would think it's just
[1:25:55] uh too hard
[1:25:57] to go on
[1:25:59] to the promise that god had had brought
[1:26:01] him to now see see when god called him
[1:26:04] out of egypt god called them to a
[1:26:07] promised land
[1:26:09] i will give you a land but it's you know
[1:26:11] they came out that's all they really
[1:26:12] wanted
[1:26:13] they just wanted satan off their back
[1:26:16] honestly
[1:26:17] but they weren't interested and go all
[1:26:19] the way to christ
[1:26:21] and this i just say this as a church we
[1:26:24] need to be interested in what god has
[1:26:25] for us
[1:26:27] he wants our nature change we have a
[1:26:29] chance every single day to live for him
[1:26:32] just a little closer a little bit more
[1:26:34] of a change i don't know what it is that
[1:26:36] god wants you to do
[1:26:38] i am not your conscience
[1:26:42] you don't know what god wants me to do
[1:26:44] you're not my conscience
[1:26:47] but god speaks to you and you know what
[1:26:50] god wants you to do
[1:26:52] and that's what we want to focus on
[1:26:55] what happens to a lot of people when
[1:26:56] they
[1:26:58] face their trials
[1:27:00] they get all caught up in the flesh
[1:27:05] they begin to
[1:27:07] murmur
[1:27:09] complain
[1:27:11] i'll tell you what they did they
[1:27:12] murmured against moses turn with me to
[1:27:14] exodus chapter 17.
[1:27:19] exodus chapter 17.
[1:27:26] so we
[1:27:29] this word is to help us that's why this
[1:27:32] word is here
[1:27:36] now all the congregation starting with
[1:27:37] verse 1 exodus chapter 17 all the
[1:27:40] congregation of the children of israel
[1:27:42] journeyed from the wilderness of sin
[1:27:46] after their journeys according to the
[1:27:48] commandment of the lord
[1:27:50] and they pitched in
[1:27:52] referendum
[1:27:53] and there was no water for the people to
[1:27:56] drink you ever come to church and you
[1:27:58] just like well it just doesn't seem the
[1:27:59] spirit doesn't seem to be moving
[1:28:03] wherefore the people did chide with the
[1:28:06] leadership
[1:28:07] and said give us water that we may drink
[1:28:11] and moses said unto them why tie ye with
[1:28:14] me
[1:28:16] wherefore do you tempt the lord
[1:28:19] and the people thirsted there for water
[1:28:23] and the people murmured against moses
[1:28:25] and said wherefore is it that thou has
[1:28:28] brought us up out of egypt to kill us
[1:28:30] and our children and our cattle with
[1:28:32] thirst
[1:28:33] and moses cried unto the lord and said
[1:28:36] what shall i do unto this people
[1:28:39] they be almost
[1:28:40] ready to stone me
[1:28:43] he was a man that helped him there was
[1:28:45] nothing he was the meekest man in the
[1:28:47] whole earth
[1:28:49] wouldn't do anything to hurt anybody
[1:28:52] and and they wanted to stone him
[1:28:55] and the lord said unto moses
[1:28:57] go on before the people and take with
[1:29:00] thee of the elders of israel and thy rod
[1:29:02] wherewith
[1:29:03] thou smoldest the river and take in thy
[1:29:06] hand and go behold i will stand before
[1:29:08] thee there upon the rock of orb and
[1:29:12] thou shall smite the rock and there
[1:29:14] shall come water out of it that the
[1:29:16] people may drink and the moses did so on
[1:29:19] the side of the
[1:29:20] elders of israel and he called the name
[1:29:22] of that place messe
[1:29:25] and miraba
[1:29:27] because of the chiding of the children
[1:29:29] of israel and because they tempted the
[1:29:31] lord now look at this saying is
[1:29:34] the lord among us
[1:29:36] or not
[1:29:37] what happens when we come to church and
[1:29:39] because we don't
[1:29:41] feel
[1:29:43] the spirit
[1:29:44] we don't
[1:29:46] see things moving the way we like we
[1:29:48] don't
[1:29:49] we begin to is the lord among us
[1:29:53] do you see how easy it is
[1:29:56] to get in the same place as these
[1:29:59] children were
[1:30:02] that's why we need to be
[1:30:05] so
[1:30:07] focused i can't wait to get to the house
[1:30:10] of the lord because i know when i get
[1:30:13] there
[1:30:13] the lord will be among us he promised to
[1:30:17] be where two or three are gathered
[1:30:18] together in his name
[1:30:21] nothing about feelings nothing about
[1:30:23] emotions not about how good your day was
[1:30:25] how bad your week was nothing matters it
[1:30:28] only matters i'm going to meet the lord
[1:30:30] it's just me and the lord
[1:30:34] that's why you know too much talking
[1:30:36] about this that or the other gets you
[1:30:38] off track
[1:30:40] you know the devil would do anything to
[1:30:42] distract you from the word
[1:30:49] lord help us never to question
[1:30:51] amen we we as a church we need to stop
[1:30:54] doubting
[1:30:56] stop questioning
[1:30:59] remain confident that the living word is
[1:31:02] among us
[1:31:04] he's going to finish the work that he
[1:31:06] started joshua and canada remain
[1:31:07] confident of this very thing
[1:31:09] that he which brought them out of egypt
[1:31:12] was going to take them into the promised
[1:31:14] land
[1:31:16] and we have to remain confident that he
[1:31:18] brought us out of the world and he's
[1:31:20] going to bring us to a complete nature
[1:31:21] change that i will be able to go through
[1:31:23] that child and i will be able to
[1:31:25] manifest christ
[1:31:26] in that trial amen
[1:31:28] now give an excuse not saying it's for
[1:31:30] another day not saying it can't happen
[1:31:33] but believe because there's spirits that
[1:31:35] want to tell you that you'll never live
[1:31:37] it right
[1:31:41] amen
[1:31:44] that's from the pit of hell
[1:31:47] that is strictly from the pit of hell
[1:31:50] you've got to believe
[1:31:54] that's why jesus said if thou can't
[1:31:56] believe all things are possible i'll
[1:31:58] tell you in this hour the bible tells us
[1:32:00] that we should be coming to church all
[1:32:02] the more
[1:32:03] as we see the day approaching
[1:32:06] all the more we should be injured all
[1:32:08] the more we should be telling other
[1:32:10] people come and hear the truth
[1:32:13] amen
[1:32:14] well they're going to turn me down it
[1:32:15] doesn't matter amen what matters is what
[1:32:18] we're doing
[1:32:19] an expression back to god and offering
[1:32:22] to god
[1:32:24] it's not just about your worship here
[1:32:26] it's about your worship out here
[1:32:28] amen numbers chapter 14 verse 22 because
[1:32:31] all those men there was something
[1:32:34] different
[1:32:35] about
[1:32:37] joshua and caleb
[1:32:40] because all those men which had seen my
[1:32:42] glory and my miracles which i did in
[1:32:44] egypt and in the wilderness and have
[1:32:47] tempted me now these ten times and have
[1:32:49] not hearkened to my voice now notice
[1:32:53] they seen the miracles in egypt
[1:32:56] they seen the miracles in church
[1:33:00] but because they didn't hearken to the
[1:33:02] voice
[1:33:06] surely they shall not see the land which
[1:33:08] i swear unto their fathers
[1:33:10] neither shall any of them that provoke
[1:33:12] me
[1:33:13] see it
[1:33:15] but my servant caleb
[1:33:17] because
[1:33:18] he had another spirit with him what kind
[1:33:22] of spirit was it
[1:33:24] had followed me
[1:33:26] fully
[1:33:28] him well i bring him to the land where
[1:33:31] unto he went and his seed shall possess
[1:33:35] it now that is a spiritual seed
[1:33:39] so the the message here is god wants us
[1:33:43] to follow him fully
[1:33:46] amen so just because we don't we're not
[1:33:49] excited about the word that's being
[1:33:50] preached hey this is the word that we
[1:33:53] need to follow fully
[1:33:56] you got
[1:33:58] we can't have all double stuff orioles
[1:34:02] you know
[1:34:04] but no nevertheless we must hearken to
[1:34:08] the word we must follow the word we must
[1:34:11] obey the word we don't want to be a
[1:34:12] three-quarter believer
[1:34:14] why be a three-quarter believer and say
[1:34:16] well you know look at that he's only a
[1:34:19] half believer
[1:34:22] fully believe
[1:34:24] fully believe
[1:34:26] challenge yourself do you fully believe
[1:34:30] what does god want you to do just just
[1:34:32] follow it
[1:34:33] don't step away don't not think about it
[1:34:35] don't let it go just lord show me that
[1:34:38] one part i love you that much lord your
[1:34:41] faith will grow
[1:34:44] we need men today to stand up
[1:34:48] we need men to stand up
[1:34:50] and say i'm a believer and i'm following
[1:34:52] this word fully i'm giving everything i
[1:34:54] got that's what we need we need men and
[1:34:57] we need women to stand up and say i'm
[1:35:00] going to believe the word more today
[1:35:01] than i did yesterday because i heard
[1:35:04] more of the word today
[1:35:06] not just be satisfied with church
[1:35:07] attendance and going home and think well
[1:35:10] i did my duty today god is not happy
[1:35:12] with that that's not the relationship
[1:35:14] he's going to have with his bride his
[1:35:16] bride will be building character
[1:35:19] god is among us
[1:35:21] amen my sheep hear my voice and they
[1:35:23] follow me
[1:35:27] first corinthians chapter 10 verse 1
[1:35:30] moreover brother and i would not that ye
[1:35:32] should be ignorant how that all our
[1:35:34] fathers were under the cloud and all
[1:35:35] passed under the sea we're all baptized
[1:35:37] with mo unto moses and in the cloud
[1:35:41] and in the sea and did all eat the same
[1:35:44] spiritual meat all
[1:35:45] drank the same spiritual drink for they
[1:35:47] drink of the spiritual rock that
[1:35:49] followed them and that rock was christ
[1:35:51] but with many of them god was not well
[1:35:53] pleased for they were overthrown in the
[1:35:54] wilderness now i just wonder how many of
[1:35:58] this is the bible says many of them god
[1:36:00] was not well pleased does that mean god
[1:36:03] came down to every one of them
[1:36:04] individually and said listen john martin
[1:36:08] listen
[1:36:09] bob smith
[1:36:10] listen ted armstrong
[1:36:13] i'm not pleased with you is that what
[1:36:15] that scripture means
[1:36:18] no
[1:36:19] it means moses gave the word
[1:36:22] but they didn't believe it
[1:36:24] we can't expect god to come to us
[1:36:26] individually all the time and say this
[1:36:30] about the situation
[1:36:32] the word this
[1:36:34] we're taught by the prophet that this is
[1:36:36] the judgment seat of christ
[1:36:38] and that the word comes forth
[1:36:41] and the word is there to get us ready
[1:36:47] i that's what here's what's so beautiful
[1:36:48] i never ever ever ever ever ever ever
[1:36:52] want to know what god speaks to anybody
[1:36:54] it's just none of my business
[1:36:58] i do not like going up to and telling
[1:37:01] somebody
[1:37:05] i mean you have to you have to if god
[1:37:07] tells you
[1:37:09] but it just seems that people are so
[1:37:11] caught up sometimes in the devil
[1:37:14] they can't listen to
[1:37:20] but let's
[1:37:23] let's look at why these things are
[1:37:25] written and did all drink the same
[1:37:27] spiritual drink
[1:37:29] and did all all that and for they drank
[1:37:31] that spiritual rock that followed them
[1:37:33] that rock was christ for with many of
[1:37:34] them god was not
[1:37:35] well pleased for they were overthrown in
[1:37:37] the wilderness now these things were our
[1:37:39] examples
[1:37:41] to the intent that we should not desire
[1:37:43] the wrong things
[1:37:45] as they also did
[1:37:48] now
[1:37:52] i want us to ask the questions are we
[1:37:54] being overthrown
[1:37:56] in life
[1:37:58] are our trials taking us away from god
[1:38:01] or are they drawn us near god
[1:38:05] have we considered
[1:38:07] going backwards
[1:38:09] have we began to want the wrong things
[1:38:12] have we murmured against leadership
[1:38:17] these are these are good questions amen
[1:38:23] are we questioning
[1:38:24] whether the word the living word is
[1:38:26] among us are we questioning it
[1:38:30] i don't want a question
[1:38:33] i want to doubt my doubts
[1:38:37] i don't want to doubt the lord
[1:38:39] we have a rock
[1:38:41] in this weird land
[1:38:42] we don't want to stumble at the word
[1:38:45] we need to humble ourself under the
[1:38:47] mighty hand of god and get into that
[1:38:49] rock hide in that rock stand upon that
[1:38:52] rock because the living word is among us
[1:38:56] turn with me if you would to first peter
[1:38:58] chapter 2.
[1:39:03] just as christ was hid in the simplicity
[1:39:06] back then
[1:39:07] and they didn't recognize
[1:39:09] christ
[1:39:11] christ is among us he's hiding in the
[1:39:13] simplicity of the word
[1:39:15] that's how powerful the word is
[1:39:17] and i how many times you've heard me say
[1:39:20] i wish there was just a curtain here you
[1:39:21] couldn't see my face you wouldn't get
[1:39:23] distracted that you would just hear the
[1:39:26] word
[1:39:28] first peter chapter 2 verse 5 says he
[1:39:30] also has lively stones are built up a
[1:39:34] spiritual house a holy priesthood to
[1:39:36] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[1:39:40] to god by jesus christ
[1:39:43] the more you're built up
[1:39:46] the more you ought to be offering up
[1:39:48] spiritual sacrifices
[1:39:51] if you come in the church and just say i
[1:39:53] don't feel like it
[1:39:56] what kind of sacrifice are you going to
[1:39:58] offer god
[1:40:00] you've got to come i want to give god my
[1:40:01] very best
[1:40:03] i don't care how i feel
[1:40:05] i just want to give him my very best he
[1:40:08] deserves the very best
[1:40:10] wherefore also it is contained in the
[1:40:13] scriptures behold a lie in zion a chief
[1:40:16] cornerstone he's elect he's precious and
[1:40:19] he that believeth on him shall not be
[1:40:22] confounded
[1:40:24] now unto you therefore which believe the
[1:40:26] word
[1:40:28] that believe the word he is precious
[1:40:31] but unto them that be disobedient to the
[1:40:34] word
[1:40:35] the stone which the builders disallowed
[1:40:38] the same is made the head of the corner
[1:40:41] and look it's being defined as a stone
[1:40:44] of stumbling
[1:40:46] a rock of offense even to them that
[1:40:49] stumble at the word
[1:40:51] being disobedient
[1:40:53] where unto also they were appointed oh
[1:40:55] my my
[1:40:57] you know i remember going in school
[1:41:00] slightly i remember it's not that great
[1:41:02] but when i was very little
[1:41:05] going into like kindergarten in first
[1:41:08] grade
[1:41:10] and coming to this building that i never
[1:41:12] been before
[1:41:13] and seeing all these signs and all these
[1:41:15] kids in these classrooms and names on
[1:41:18] the outside i just didn't know where to
[1:41:20] go i felt so scared and like out of
[1:41:23] place
[1:41:26] i was wondering where i was being
[1:41:28] appointed to
[1:41:31] i don't want to be appointed
[1:41:34] to be disobedient
[1:41:36] i want to be appointed to be obedient to
[1:41:39] the word of god
[1:41:42] the same word that builds up the
[1:41:44] believer to the statue of a perfect man
[1:41:47] stumbles the borderline believer
[1:41:51] he gets offended at growing up in the
[1:41:53] word
[1:41:54] he doesn't want to follow the harder way
[1:41:57] he chooses the path of self-will
[1:42:00] the same word that builds the confidence
[1:42:02] in the believer becomes a rock of
[1:42:04] offense to the borderline believer
[1:42:08] say to the bride here remain confident
[1:42:11] saints the living word is among us
[1:42:14] he may be hiding in simplicity
[1:42:17] in this word but he's here among us
[1:42:21] but ye are a chosen generation a royal
[1:42:25] priesthood
[1:42:26] a holy nation a peculiar people that you
[1:42:29] should show forth the praises of him
[1:42:31] that caught you out of darkness into his
[1:42:33] marvelous light
[1:42:35] every time god speaks to us
[1:42:38] he's speaking to him of his marvelous
[1:42:40] light
[1:42:41] he wants us to walk in it we ought to be
[1:42:43] praising god for it not getting offended
[1:42:46] he's calling us higher
[1:42:49] his word is ministering to us in
[1:42:52] entrance how to get into the rapture
[1:42:54] amen
[1:42:56] wow
[1:43:00] we think well this doesn't this this
[1:43:01] message isn't on the rapture
[1:43:04] this doesn't seem to be giving me faith
[1:43:05] for the rapture
[1:43:08] it's ministering an entrance
[1:43:12] into your promise today
[1:43:15] the same word
[1:43:16] that ministered in entrance
[1:43:18] in the promised land for joshua and
[1:43:21] caleb became a stumbling stone for the
[1:43:24] borderline believer
[1:43:28] remember the word did not profit them
[1:43:30] because it wasn't mixed with faith when
[1:43:32] they heard it
[1:43:35] god used the ministry of the children of
[1:43:37] israel
[1:43:39] for an entrance into the promised land
[1:43:41] but what happened
[1:43:42] they stumbled at the steps to get in
[1:43:45] i want you to catch this
[1:43:47] they stumbled at the steps to get in
[1:43:50] they did not want to walk up those seven
[1:43:52] steps of perfection right
[1:43:55] they weren't interested in becoming
[1:43:58] to the statue of a perfect man they were
[1:44:00] just completely satisfied with being
[1:44:02] saved
[1:44:04] that they were out of egypt that
[1:44:05] everything was okay
[1:44:08] now their focus was on other things
[1:44:12] but
[1:44:12] i say don't stumble at the word that god
[1:44:16] is giving us
[1:44:19] those are the steps to enter into that
[1:44:21] entrance
[1:44:25] the living word is among us turn with me
[1:44:27] if you would to second peter chapter one
[1:44:30] verse 10.

[1:44:33] want you to i those of you that say but
[1:44:35] this is a long service i want i want to
[1:44:36] say something i want you to be happy
[1:44:38] right now because i am passing up so
[1:44:40] many notes

[1:44:46] the rather brethren give diligence to
[1:44:48] make your calling
[1:44:50] an election a sure thing
[1:44:53] for if you do these things you shall
[1:44:55] never fall
[1:44:56] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[1:44:59] unto you
[1:45:01] abundantly think about that abundantly
[1:45:04] into everlasting to the everlasting
[1:45:06] kingdom of our lord and savior jesus
[1:45:09] christ
[1:45:10] the living word is among us it's
[1:45:13] ministering to us in entrance to enter
[1:45:16] into the image of christ amen to being
[1:45:19] able to live the life that that's what
[1:45:21] it's about
[1:45:23] it's not about saying
[1:45:24] we're in the message we've got a great
[1:45:26] church it's not about that it's about
[1:45:29] coming in and being able to live the
[1:45:31] life in front of your brother living for
[1:45:33] yourself live in front of your neighbor
[1:45:35] live in front of your family live the
[1:45:37] life of christ that's what he's calling

[1:45:47] church with what else am i missing lord
[1:45:51] until you got everybody in the world
[1:45:53] telling you
[1:45:55] have you seen john martin i don't see
[1:45:57] him
[1:45:58] have you seen mark i don't see him all i
[1:46:00] see is christ
[1:46:01] until everybody
[1:46:03] just sees jesus in you
[1:46:07] i'm sure there's more for us to have
[1:46:09] amen
[1:46:11] remain confident
[1:46:13] of this very thing
[1:46:15] that he which have become a good working
[1:46:16] he's going to fish it don't stop
[1:46:19] don't get lazy
[1:46:21] don't say it's not a big deal if i don't
[1:46:23] come not a big deal if i don't receive
[1:46:27] have the fear of the lord
[1:46:29] leave church with something that you
[1:46:32] didn't have
[1:46:33] don't put it on the ministry don't put
[1:46:36] it on the songs don't put it on the
[1:46:38] music don't put it on your feelings
[1:46:42] put it on your face put it on your face
[1:46:46] let your faith take you there
[1:46:50] i believe god is here regardless of what
[1:46:52] my feelings may say about the situation
[1:46:58] first john chapter 3 verse 1 behold
[1:47:00] what manner of love the father bestowed
[1:47:02] upon us
[1:47:03] that we should be called the sons of god
[1:47:05] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:47:07] because it knew him not
[1:47:09] so there's no surprise there
[1:47:12] beloved
[1:47:13] now are we the sons of god
[1:47:15] and it does not at this point yet appear
[1:47:18] what we shall be but we know
[1:47:21] we do know that when he appears we're
[1:47:23] going to be like him
[1:47:26] we're going to be able to see him
[1:47:27] correctly
[1:47:28] you know the life that we are living
[1:47:31] basically
[1:47:32] is the revelation that we have of god
[1:47:36] i want you to think about that
[1:47:38] the life that we're living today
[1:47:42] is the revelation that we have of god
[1:47:46] now what i'm doing
[1:47:48] is i'm calling
[1:47:50] to get you to live higher
[1:47:56] how many people have you heard this is
[1:47:58] going to happen this is going to happen
[1:47:59] this is going to happen i
[1:48:02] if i could go back whether they were in
[1:48:03] the message or not in the message i had
[1:48:05] so many people tell me
[1:48:06] they were going to go on a rapture
[1:48:08] and they're not even living anymore
[1:48:11] but you know they could be the ones
[1:48:13] caught up you know first
[1:48:15] they're part of the rapture i suppose
[1:48:18] but you understand what i'm saying
[1:48:21] it's not go by what we know
[1:48:25] let's go by what we're living
[1:48:27] what we had victory with this past week
[1:48:30] let that be our our our our testimony
[1:48:33] build off of that
[1:48:34] and stay away from what we know
[1:48:37] just get away from it
[1:48:39] get about what we're living
[1:48:41] are we laying down our life for somebody
[1:48:43] are we testifying are we are we
[1:48:45] witnessing to some soul that don't know
[1:48:48] christ are we trying to bring them in
[1:48:50] are we laying our life down for the
[1:48:51] brethren
[1:48:53] are we coming to church believing that
[1:48:55] the living word is among us are we just
[1:48:57] coming to church because it's church
[1:49:00] hoping to get something out of it
[1:49:02] lord help us amen every man that has
[1:49:05] this hope in him purifies himself even
[1:49:08] as he is pure
[1:49:11] amen there's the process right there
[1:49:12] romans chapter 8 we have to hurry
[1:49:18] verse 18 for i reckon that the
[1:49:20] sufferings of this present time
[1:49:24] your suffering that you're going through
[1:49:26] is not
[1:49:27] worthy
[1:49:28] to be compared
[1:49:30] with what's going to be manifest in your
[1:49:32] life
[1:49:35] just focus
[1:49:37] on christ in you the hope of glory
[1:49:42] if you can believe
[1:49:43] christ is here when we come to church
[1:49:46] you'll have a lot more faith going
[1:49:49] through the trials in your home
[1:49:51] that christ is with you there
[1:49:54] is this a short little testimony
[1:49:57] uh but
[1:49:58] brother marty had
[1:50:00] uh
[1:50:02] sent us a little
[1:50:04] uh

[1:50:07] situation about sister kathleen and how

[1:51:28] hebrews chapter 3 verse 14 for we are
[1:51:30] made partakers of christ if we hold the
[1:51:34] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[1:51:37] unto the end
[1:51:38] being confident of this one thing
[1:51:42] he would started this in you years ago
[1:51:45] he's going to be
[1:51:47] working with you on a regular basis
[1:51:49] until it's finished
[1:51:52] so we we got the beginning when he
[1:51:53] called us we got the end
[1:51:55] but can we see him in the middle
[1:51:58] amen god is among us
[1:52:01] amen praise the lord
[1:52:03] so many scriptures
[1:52:06] so many incidences
[1:52:08] in the bible where
[1:52:12] people had showed
[1:52:14] confidence if you just read the book of
[1:52:17] hebrews chapter 11 you'll see many many
[1:52:19] examples of faith
[1:52:22] and i just wanted i just
[1:52:24] if i could just be like
[1:52:26] a little bit
[1:52:27] in god's economy just you know two words
[1:52:29] you know john martin barely made it or
[1:52:32] something
[1:52:33] i'll be happy
[1:52:37] but there won't be anybody that makes it
[1:52:40] that doesn't remain confident that's how
[1:52:42] important the message is remain
[1:52:44] confident it can't be just words but in
[1:52:46] your heart when
[1:52:47] when you're being tested
[1:52:49] just come to the forefront i believe i'm
[1:52:51] gonna pray this prayer of faith if it
[1:52:53] don't work
[1:52:55] keep praying keep believing
[1:52:58] don't allow the devil to minister and
[1:52:59] say well it didn't happen that just
[1:53:01] doesn't mean anything brother brandon
[1:53:03] said if he prayed for a thousand people
[1:53:04] nothing happened he'd go on praying for
[1:53:06] the next one believing you have to
[1:53:08] remain confident
[1:53:10] we don't have to explain everything
[1:53:13] we just have to believe the word
[1:53:16] amen let's
[1:53:17] go to our lord in prayer
[1:53:20] maybe there'll be someone here today
[1:53:21] that say brother john would you
[1:53:24] add me
[1:53:25] to the prayer
[1:53:26] today i want to build my confidence i
[1:53:29] want to remain confident
[1:53:31] i see things have slipped a little bit
[1:53:33] maybe maybe there's someone that
[1:53:37] uh you've allowed
[1:53:39] something to come
[1:53:40] in your life
[1:53:42] and
[1:53:43] maybe someone
[1:53:44] stumbled stumbled fell and and and it's
[1:53:48] it's really bothered you
[1:53:50] amen god sees your your heart god sees
[1:53:54] amen

[1:54:20] their midst lord we pray that you would
