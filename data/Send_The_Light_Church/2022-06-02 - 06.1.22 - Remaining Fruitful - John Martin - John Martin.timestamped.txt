[34:18] church spiritually

[34:23] ever
[34:24] ever complete so
[34:26] um
[34:27] god bless you turn with me if you would
[34:29] to the book of luke chapter eight
[34:33] last wednesday we
[34:35] ministered on remaining
[34:37] uh faithful
[34:40] and um today we want to
[34:43] administer on remaining fruitful
[34:50] before we begin reading here
[34:53] in luke chapter 8 if we could
[34:56] um just all of us look to the the author
[34:59] and prayer or
[35:01] our great
[35:02] father in heaven
[35:05] we're
[35:07] solely depending upon you lord to come
[35:11] and break the bread of life to us
[35:13] tonight
[35:15] lord we know that
[35:18] we all have different
[35:20] uh needs and
[35:21] desires and
[35:23] things that we'd even like to hear from
[35:25] you
[35:27] about
[35:29] but lord we just want to place
[35:32] our heart
[35:34] and this time into your
[35:36] into your hands lord that you would
[35:38] speak whatever you would desire to speak
[35:42] and lord
[35:43] we're incapable
[35:45] of receiving
[35:47] spiritual revelation just from our own
[35:49] abilities and understanding so we pray
[35:52] that you would just take
[35:54] our minds
[35:56] and let the thoughts that are in
[35:59] our minds be your thoughts today
[36:02] and
[36:04] may
[36:05] uh our understanding
[36:08] be set aside and may revelation come and
[36:11] take its place and let us be able to
[36:14] receive
[36:15] lord the very message that you have for
[36:17] us today for i believe lord it is
[36:21] important for us lord as you laid it on
[36:23] our heart
[36:25] we pray that we could receive it lord
[36:28] bless your people now as we commit the
[36:31] service in your hands and pray that you
[36:33] bless
[36:34] all the reading of your word
[36:36] now in jesus precious name we pray
[36:38] amen
[36:40] amen luke chapter eight starting with
[36:42] verse number four it's the parable of
[36:45] the sower and when much people were
[36:48] gathered together
[36:49] and were come to him out of every city
[36:52] he spake by a parable as went out
[36:56] to sow his seed and as he sowed some
[36:59] fell by the wayside and it was trodden
[37:02] down the files of the air devoured it so
[37:04] it's useless
[37:06] and some fell upon a rock and as soon as
[37:09] it was sprung up
[37:12] it withered away because
[37:14] it lacked moisture
[37:17] that we have i don't know if you have
[37:19] areas in your yard but we have some
[37:22] areas where we don't got a lot of
[37:24] topsoil
[37:26] and if it don't rain all the time it
[37:27] don't stay green
[37:29] and it just turns yellow and sometimes
[37:31] can wither away and the only thing
[37:32] that's left is weeds
[37:35] and so
[37:36] we don't want to have a heart
[37:38] that's shallow it needs to be very deep
[37:42] amen
[37:43] and some fell among thorns and the
[37:46] thorns sprang up and
[37:48] with it and look
[37:51] choked it
[37:52] and others found good ground spraying up
[37:54] and bear fruit a hundred fold and when
[37:57] he had said these things he cried he
[37:59] that have an ear let him hear
[38:03] so he cried it must have been an
[38:05] important
[38:06] thing he
[38:08] he wanted it so bad that he cried
[38:12] and his disciples asked him saying what
[38:14] might this parable be and he said
[38:17] unto you it is given to know the
[38:19] mysteries of the kingdom of god but to
[38:21] others
[38:22] in parables
[38:24] that seeing they might not see and
[38:26] hearing they might not understand
[38:29] now the parable is this the seed is the
[38:32] word of god which we're hearing today
[38:33] amen
[38:35] and those by the wayside are they that
[38:38] hear
[38:39] then cometh the devil and taketh away
[38:42] the word out of their hearts
[38:45] lest they should believe and be saved
[38:49] they on the rock are they
[38:52] with when they hear receive the word
[38:55] with joy
[38:58] and these have no root
[39:01] which for a while they believe
[39:04] and in time of temptation
[39:07] trials they fall away
[39:12] and
[39:12] they which fell among thorns are they
[39:16] which
[39:17] when they had heard they have heard they
[39:20] go forth
[39:22] and
[39:23] are choked
[39:25] with the cares
[39:26] and the riches
[39:28] and the pleasures of this life
[39:31] and bring no fruit
[39:35] to perfection now
[39:37] name of our message remaining fruitful
[39:40] but what but that on the good ground are
[39:43] they
[39:45] which
[39:46] in an honest
[39:47] and good heart
[39:49] having heard the word
[39:52] they don't just say amen but they keep
[39:55] it
[39:57] and bring for fruit
[39:59] with patience god bless you you may be
[40:01] seated
[40:07] we've all been fruitful at one time or
[40:09] another
[40:10] we've all got testimonies of people
[40:13] seeing our lives and being
[40:15] and being um
[40:17] challenged and and being
[40:20] encouraged and
[40:22] and feeling like i can go forward
[40:24] because of you
[40:26] and we could say it's because
[40:28] of christ's inner life being fruitful
[40:31] that these things have transpired but
[40:35] it doesn't mean that not at any time
[40:37] that the cares of life or the or riches
[40:40] or pleasures or
[40:41] or trials or things could come into our
[40:44] life and we can literally become
[40:46] spiritually
[40:48] unfruitful
[40:52] and
[40:53] of course the devil just wants us to
[40:56] keep looking back at our past
[40:58] as if that makes a difference
[41:01] about our present
[41:04] but
[41:05] the lord as we're going to go through
[41:07] some lots of scriptures we're going to
[41:09] see that god wants us to remain fruitful
[41:12] not just to look to our past but to
[41:15] challenge our presence
[41:19] matthew chapter 7 verse 5
[41:26] beware of false prophets which come to
[41:29] you in sheep's clothing
[41:31] but inwardly
[41:33] they're raving wolves
[41:36] now that i looked up that raving wolves
[41:39] and it means aggressively greedy
[41:43] the practice of obtaining something
[41:45] through force or
[41:47] threats
[41:50] so
[41:51] their prophets
[41:54] and they look and appear like a prophet
[41:57] outwardly
[41:59] but inwardly their motive
[42:02] is different
[42:06] and and and
[42:07] and and real true sheep
[42:12] live for others
[42:14] eternal life is living for others it's
[42:16] not about for self
[42:19] it's about for others
[42:21] so we're just not talking about false
[42:22] prophets all of us could be false
[42:24] prophets they don't prophet is just
[42:25] somebody that wants to share with
[42:28] about christ
[42:31] all kinds of prophets
[42:34] people that claim christ are supposed to
[42:36] be living for others
[42:39] people who claim christ but have an
[42:41] aggressive greedy agenda
[42:44] and practice obtaining things through
[42:46] force or even threats
[42:48] it's a false advertisement of the gospel
[42:52] and he went on to say in verse 16 that
[42:54] you're going to know them by their
[42:57] fruits
[42:59] tie their fruits
[43:01] and so then he says
[43:03] do men gather grapes of thorns or figs
[43:07] of thistles
[43:10] grapes do not come
[43:12] upon thorn bushes
[43:16] nor do figs come from thistles
[43:20] so there's something wrong with the
[43:21] fruit if you
[43:23] get pricked
[43:26] right i know when
[43:28] i buy grapes and it it just on a vine
[43:31] and you don't ever have to worry about
[43:32] getting you know some sort of prong
[43:35] a poult when you go to you don't even
[43:37] have to look at him you just put your
[43:38] hand there and you pull it off and you
[43:40] eat it
[43:41] but if if when
[43:45] someone is sharing
[43:47] christ with you
[43:49] this is what you need to do
[43:51] and this is what you're doing wrong or
[43:53] this is what christ wants us to do you
[43:55] know proclaiming
[43:58] christ from them but at the same time
[44:02] you're getting poked
[44:04] you're getting pricked
[44:08] something's wrong with that fruit
[44:10] because jesus is saying you don't you
[44:12] don't pull grapes off those uh thorns
[44:15] you just don't do it
[44:18] something's wrong with the fruit if it
[44:20] comes with an aggressive greedy agenda
[44:23] something's wrong with it
[44:26] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[44:29] good fruit
[44:31] but a crop tree bringing forth evil
[44:33] fruit now here's the thing we're a human
[44:35] being with faults and failures
[44:38] we have good days we have bad days
[44:42] we we try to be sweet as ever
[44:45] and we fly off the handle
[44:47] but let me just say
[44:49] the scripture gives us no excuse to do
[44:52] that in fact it's just the opposite
[44:56] we're not allowed to do that
[44:58] so we are being called to get serious
[45:02] about it a good tree verse 18 cannot
[45:06] bring forth evil fruit neither can a
[45:08] corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
[45:12] every tree that bringeth not forth good
[45:14] fruit is hewed down and cast into the
[45:16] fire
[45:18] wherefore by their fruits again you
[45:20] shall know them
[45:22] by their fruits he says this two times
[45:26] the fruits that jesus is referring to is
[45:28] not the truth
[45:31] it's not the word of god it's not the
[45:33] words that you say
[45:36] it's the spirit that is it's mixed with
[45:39] amen
[45:41] it's a mixed tree remember
[45:44] it's a tree of
[45:45] the knowledge of good and evil
[45:49] so it has the the the ability like uh
[45:52] satan came to jesus and he said he said
[45:55] uh uh
[45:58] you can command these these stones to be
[46:01] made bread and you can cast yourself off
[46:03] and the bible says the angels will come
[46:05] down and catch you before you you dash a
[46:07] foot
[46:08] so it knows the word but the spirit is
[46:11] not right
[46:14] and that's the fruit that we need to
[46:16] look at
[46:17] with others amen
[46:20] james chapter 3 verse 8 says but the
[46:23] tongue can no man tame it is unruly evil
[46:25] it's full of deadly poison
[46:28] therewith bless we god
[46:31] even the father
[46:33] and therewith curse we
[46:35] men
[46:37] which are made after the simplitude of
[46:39] god
[46:41] out of the same mouth
[46:44] precedes blessings
[46:47] and cursings
[46:50] my brethren
[46:51] these things ought not to be
[46:54] see there's no excuse he doesn't give a
[46:57] reason that it's okay
[47:00] and then he goes and he asks these
[47:01] questions does a fountain send forth at
[47:04] the same place sweet water and bitter
[47:06] water
[47:08] has anybody ever came over your house
[47:09] and said is this city water is this uh
[47:13] well water yeah right
[47:16] and no
[47:17] it's like
[47:18] it is what it is
[47:20] and when you go to the faucet you can
[47:22] expect the same thing the next time
[47:24] it ain't going to change
[47:26] and so the question comes out
[47:28] does it the same place sweet water and
[47:30] bitter water come on no
[47:32] then we're not allowed to use our mouth
[47:34] for the devil or let me just say for
[47:36] ourselves
[47:39] to judge somebody to to to to get upset
[47:42] and
[47:43] and at the same time
[47:45] praise god
[47:48] can the fig tree my brethren bear allah
[47:50] berries
[47:52] neither a vine figs
[47:55] so can no fountain both yield salt water
[47:58] and fresh water
[48:01] you see these scriptures are causing us
[48:03] we got to try harder we got to make a
[48:05] better decision not just say it doesn't
[48:07] matter and i'll just you know god
[48:09] forgive me there we can't have that type
[48:11] of attitude though the word needs to
[48:14] bring forth fruit and the fruit needs to
[48:16] remain we got to have the word fall see
[48:19] that that honest heart that that good
[48:21] ground
[48:22] they they laughed and they actually
[48:24] started doing what the word said amen
[48:30] so we hear the word and when we say amen
[48:34] to it we're really saying so be it i'm
[48:36] going to start doing this thing
[48:38] i'm going to i'm not just saying i'm not
[48:40] believe it but i believe it to the point
[48:42] that i'm going to start trying to do
[48:43] with all my heart because i know it's
[48:45] the will of god for my life
[48:48] james is demanding a separation from
[48:51] possessing a mixed fruit tree
[48:54] these things ought not to be
[48:57] i believe god wants us to remain
[48:59] faithful don't you first john chapter
[49:02] one verse five first john chapter one
[49:04] verse five
[49:05] then
[49:06] okay this then is the message which we
[49:09] heard of him and declare unto you that
[49:11] god is light and in him is no darkness
[49:14] at all
[49:18] if we say we have fellowship with jesus
[49:21] and then walk in darkness
[49:23] we lie and do not the truth now
[49:27] here's here's the thing
[49:29] we look at others who don't do what we
[49:31] think we they sh that what we think they
[49:34] should be doing
[49:35] and we say they're walking in darkness
[49:38] right
[49:39] because we become
[49:44] we become the standard
[49:46] of who's walking in the light and who's
[49:48] walking in darkness
[49:51] but reality there's no darkness in god
[49:54] at all
[49:56] so with that being said we're all in
[49:58] trouble
[50:00] right he that says that he doesn't have
[50:02] no sin he's a liar
[50:05] but again we have a scriptures that's
[50:07] pointing us that we need to be walking
[50:10] in all the word amen
[50:13] if we say we have fellowship with him
[50:14] and walk in darkness we lie and do not
[50:16] the truth but if we walk in the light
[50:19] as he is in the light
[50:21] we have fellowship with one another and
[50:23] the blood of jesus christ the son
[50:25] cleanses us from all sin so we come to
[50:27] church to find out where we're at where
[50:29] god and it's the light of the word that
[50:31] comes to us and if we can receive that
[50:34] into our heart
[50:36] we can't look at the word i've heard
[50:38] that a thousand times
[50:44] how many want to manifest more christ in
[50:46] your life
[50:48] brother branham said in the message god
[50:49] who is rich in mercy he says and we was
[50:53] speaking the other night and how the
[50:55] seed must die
[50:57] and everything around the germ of life
[50:59] must
[51:00] not only die
[51:03] but rot
[51:04] everything around
[51:07] the germ of life must not only die
[51:11] but rot
[51:12] so
[51:13] now who does the rotting
[51:19] who does the dying who does the rotting
[51:21] who does that part
[51:25] thank you
[51:26] you know we need that more often so we
[51:28] can continue on we don't have to wait
[51:30] that's the only part we play because we
[51:33] can't make the term of life do anything
[51:37] it takes the holy ghost to brood over
[51:39] that and to start bringing forth its
[51:41] life
[51:43] but if we don't die
[51:45] i'm sorry that life is not going to come
[51:47] forth
[51:49] if if that's what if you believe the
[51:51] prophet you have to believe what he's
[51:53] saying
[51:54] he said and everything around that germ
[51:56] of life must not only die but rod if it
[51:59] doesn't rot it cannot live
[52:02] and rot is he defines it completely done
[52:06] away with it's finished
[52:10] wow
[52:11] we have a job to do every day
[52:15] and until we get to the place
[52:17] that our own ideas and our own thinking
[52:20] is completely gone excuse me
[52:23] and it's rotten away from us then the
[52:25] germ of life can begin to live
[52:29] isn't that a beautiful quote now we're
[52:30] just quoting how we can simply manifest
[52:33] more of christ in our life
[52:35] there's what we can do
[52:38] in the message
[52:39] is this the sign of the answer brother
[52:42] branham says i can't go on like this
[52:44] you've got to get desperate amen you've
[52:46] got to get to the place where you want
[52:48] to know what the will of god is
[52:51] and how can you know
[52:53] uh how can you do the will of god if you
[52:56] don't know the will of god
[53:00] so we got to get desperate we want to
[53:02] manifest more of christ we got to okay
[53:04] lord i got to start rottening out i'm
[53:06] going to start doing it i'm going to
[53:07] start praying about it i'm going to ask
[53:09] you to show me it's got to be real
[53:12] it's like god sent the prophet turn with
[53:14] me if you would isaiah chapter five
[53:17] isaiah chapter five verse number one
[53:26] now will i sing to my well beloved a
[53:29] song of my beloved touching his vineyard
[53:34] my well beloved have a vineyard
[53:37] now notice it's in a very fruitful
[53:40] hill we ought to have great expectations
[53:43] here
[53:44] and he fenced it and gathered out the
[53:46] stones thereof
[53:47] what we usually do i i was driving by
[53:50] today and i seen this big field on this
[53:53] side
[53:54] of the e-way on that side
[53:56] of 23 and it was just lined with stones
[54:00] that used to be in the fields and back
[54:02] in the day the farmers took them and
[54:04] they they made a hedgerow of them and
[54:06] planted it with choice vine and built a
[54:10] tower in the midst of it i'm sure that
[54:12] was for the water just just to go out to
[54:15] hit all the
[54:16] the
[54:17] the um the good vines and then the myths
[54:20] also made a wine press so here's the
[54:22] expectation
[54:25] there's gonna we're gonna get grapes and
[54:27] we're gonna make wine from this
[54:29] therein and he looked at it it should
[54:31] bring forth grapes
[54:33] and it brought forth wild
[54:36] grapes
[54:40] it's awful quiet
[54:43] in here
[54:47] and now all inhabitants of jerusalem and
[54:49] men are judah judge i pray you betwixt
[54:52] me and my vineyard what could i have
[54:55] done more to my vineyard than i have not
[54:58] done in it
[55:02] he did everything possible he put it in
[55:05] the in a in a very fruitful hill the
[55:08] ground was good and fertile
[55:10] he fenced it so no animals could get in
[55:13] he took all the stones out he planted
[55:15] the absolute best vines that he could
[55:18] put in
[55:19] he put a tower to water it perfectly he
[55:21] haven't even had an expectation to make
[55:23] a press that when these grapes come
[55:25] forth he's going to have good wine
[55:28] so he looked
[55:31] that
[55:31] grape should come forth because that's
[55:33] what he planted and wild grapes came
[55:38] that's poison berries by the way
[55:44] and now go to i tell you
[55:46] what i will do to my vineyard
[55:49] i will take away the hedge thereof and
[55:52] it shall be eaten up and break down the
[55:55] wall thereof and it shall be trouted
[55:58] down and i will lay it to waste
[56:00] it shall not be pruned nor digged and
[56:03] there shall come upon
[56:06] those shall come up briars and thorns
[56:08] and i will also command the clouds that
[56:10] they rain no rain upon it
[56:14] wow
[56:15] i think god was upset
[56:19] because he did everything in order to
[56:22] bring forth proper
[56:24] grapes
[56:26] and of course we know what wild is
[56:29] wild
[56:31] is the nature that we were born with
[56:35] it's a beastly nature that wants to do
[56:38] its own will
[56:40] and god didn't plant us to do our own
[56:43] will he planted us to do his will
[56:48] briars
[56:49] are a tangled mass of prickly plants
[56:55] and the job of the thorns are to choke
[56:57] out the good vines
[56:59] remember we read that in the parable
[57:03] some of the seed fell among thorns and
[57:05] grew up and choked up the plants so
[57:08] you know it isn't
[57:10] a lot of times when we're listening to
[57:11] the tapes or we're listening to a
[57:12] message or we're reading our bible or we
[57:14] come to church it isn't that the word
[57:17] isn't the pure word
[57:21] but it's the condition of our heart we
[57:23] are allowing certain things certain
[57:26] desires
[57:28] inside
[57:30] of us and they literally choke out the
[57:33] word from coming to manifestation
[57:36] and it will every time we don't think it
[57:37] makes a difference that we can
[57:39] simultaneously put in there but but god
[57:42] is not going to share his glory with the
[57:43] devil
[57:44] not going to allow him to be in there if
[57:46] that's what we're going to choose then
[57:48] that's what he's going to say
[57:52] he wants to be lord of everything amen
[57:58] the word seed could only come forth and
[58:01] remain
[58:03] in the good soil or the good heart where
[58:06] it would produced a crop 100 fold 64 34
[58:10] where it was sown
[58:14] how important is it is for us to have
[58:17] a good heart
[58:19] a heart to take the word and and take it
[58:23] home with us
[58:25] for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is
[58:27] the house of israel and the men are jew
[58:29] judah his pleasant plant and he looked
[58:32] for judgment but behold oppression for
[58:35] righteousness
[58:36] but behold a cry
[58:42] let's look at another a parable in the
[58:44] in the new testament it's a parable of
[58:46] the householder demanding fruit from his
[58:49] vineyard very similar to this
[58:52] now we are the spiritual house of israel
[58:56] and god demands fruit
[58:58] to be in our life and to remain in our
[59:01] life
[59:02] and if he doesn't get it
[59:05] similar things happen but in a spiritual
[59:07] realm
[59:09] he just lets it go to waste
[59:12] and hebrews chapter 3 verse 6 says but
[59:14] christ as a son over his own house whose
[59:16] house we are if
[59:19] we hold the hope fast the confidence in
[59:22] the rejoicing of the hope firm to the
[59:24] end
[59:25] now remember i remember when i first
[59:27] came to the lord i was i was
[59:30] the happiest man on the planet
[59:33] that's right we all remember that
[59:37] nobody felt like we felt because our
[59:39] sins were taken away
[59:41] and we knew we were going to heaven and
[59:42] we were told about a rapture and we're
[59:44] going to grow in christ our lives are
[59:46] going to become beautiful and then what
[59:48] happened we lost that confidence
[59:51] somewhere down the line
[59:53] come on where is the amens
[59:57] and then we got to go back and we got to
[59:59] try to cultivate it
[1:00:02] but we can't stop
[1:00:05] we cannot stop we got to keep going to
[1:00:07] the end yes sir amen matthew chapter 21
[1:00:10] verse 33
[1:00:12] matthew 21 verse 33 here another parable
[1:00:15] there was a certain householder which
[1:00:17] planted a vineyard and hedged it round
[1:00:19] about and digged a wine pressed in it
[1:00:20] and built a tower and let it out to the
[1:00:22] husbandmen and went into a far country
[1:00:25] and when the time of the fruit drew near
[1:00:28] he sent his servants to the husbandmen
[1:00:29] that they might receive the fruits of it
[1:00:32] and the husbandmen took his servants and
[1:00:34] beat one and killed the other
[1:00:38] and stoned another
[1:00:41] again he sent other servants more than
[1:00:43] the first and they did unto them
[1:00:45] likewise
[1:00:47] but last of all he sent unto them his
[1:00:50] sons saying they will
[1:00:52] reverence my son
[1:00:54] but when the husband saw the sun they
[1:00:56] said unto themselves this is there
[1:00:59] come let us kill him and and let us
[1:01:02] seize on his inheritance
[1:01:05] and they caught him and they cast him
[1:01:07] out of the vineyard and slew him
[1:01:10] now when the lord thereof the of the
[1:01:12] vineyard cometh what will he do unto
[1:01:16] those husbandmen
[1:01:18] now
[1:01:19] we
[1:01:20] are the husbandmen
[1:01:26] we
[1:01:28] have a choice
[1:01:31] to let god's
[1:01:33] life
[1:01:35] the fruit of his spirit be in our life
[1:01:39] or we can choose
[1:01:41] not to want him not to have to do his
[1:01:43] will
[1:01:44] and do our own will seize our own life
[1:01:47] he that seeks to save his life shall
[1:01:49] lose it and he that is willing to lose
[1:01:51] his life for
[1:01:54] for our heavenly father shall save his
[1:01:56] life
[1:01:57] so he's asking the question what will he
[1:02:00] do unto these husband men amen
[1:02:02] they say unto him he will miserably
[1:02:05] destroy those wicked men and will let
[1:02:08] out his vineyard unto other husbandmen
[1:02:10] which shall render him the fruits in
[1:02:13] their season so see he's god is
[1:02:15] expecting to get fruits
[1:02:18] that's all there is to it if you don't
[1:02:20] get them there's there's trouble
[1:02:25] now
[1:02:27] jesus saith unto them did you did you
[1:02:29] never read in the scriptures the stone
[1:02:31] which the builders rejected the same as
[1:02:32] become the head of the corner
[1:02:34] this is the lord's doing and is
[1:02:36] marvelous in our eyes
[1:02:40] therefore i say unto you the kingdom of
[1:02:42] god shall be taken away from you and
[1:02:43] given to a nation bringing forth the
[1:02:45] fruits thereof so
[1:02:47] we understand that
[1:02:49] the kingdom was taken away from israel
[1:02:52] and it was given to the gentiles
[1:02:55] they rejected the head cornerstone
[1:02:58] which he became the corner of our lives
[1:03:01] the capstone oh i didn't i don't have it
[1:03:03] we all know about the pyramid right
[1:03:06] and the top is is is perfect love it's
[1:03:09] christ the capstone
[1:03:12] but this is also for
[1:03:14] us right
[1:03:17] because if if
[1:03:20] we reject
[1:03:21] the headstone of christ's will for our
[1:03:24] personal lives
[1:03:25] he's just gonna he's gonna
[1:03:28] give it to somebody else
[1:03:31] it's to whomsoever will
[1:03:34] he deals with gentiles as individuals
[1:03:38] and he ends up saying this statement and
[1:03:42] whosoever shall fall on this stone shall
[1:03:45] be broken
[1:03:47] but whosoever shall
[1:03:49] shall
[1:03:51] whosoever it shall fall it will grind
[1:03:53] him to powder
[1:03:57] so imagine there's this heavy stone and
[1:04:00] you're up north and you're looking at
[1:04:03] the
[1:04:04] beautiful scenery and there's this rock
[1:04:06] and you're up on the hill
[1:04:08] and this rock is huge i mean it is a
[1:04:10] huge one and you fell on the thing
[1:04:14] and you would hurt yourself could
[1:04:16] break an arm a leg an ankle
[1:04:20] it would hurt
[1:04:21] but imagine if that same stone was above
[1:04:24] you
[1:04:26] and it fell on you
[1:04:28] you would have more than a broken arm
[1:04:30] a broken ankle
[1:04:32] and this is the thing we've we've got to
[1:04:35] fall on the word of god we've just got
[1:04:37] to give our will to god just it's going
[1:04:40] to hurt it
[1:04:42] it'll break us but a humble and contrite
[1:04:44] spirit we've got to have that humble
[1:04:46] ourselves to become a humble and
[1:04:48] contrite spirit and be broken
[1:04:51] it's much better than that god coming at
[1:04:53] the end and we have no chance
[1:04:57] i have no chance at all
[1:05:00] every single person is going to have
[1:05:03] contact
[1:05:04] with the head of the cornerstone
[1:05:09] will either humble ourselves
[1:05:12] or it's going to fall upon us
[1:05:16] god is wanting
[1:05:18] us to bring forth a fruit
[1:05:20] that will remain
[1:05:24] and it's not just talking about the
[1:05:26] truth but it's the spirit that we pack
[1:05:29] with us all day long that we need to be
[1:05:32] watching
[1:05:34] because it's by their fruits you shall
[1:05:36] know them
[1:05:38] it's not what we know
[1:05:40] it's not what christ has done in our
[1:05:42] lives
[1:05:44] it's not what
[1:05:46] we can
[1:05:50] share
[1:05:54] it's the spirit that we have it's the
[1:05:56] motive that we have it's are we really
[1:05:59] laying our down our life for a person
[1:06:01] are we just trying to tell them what
[1:06:02] they need to do
[1:06:08] i want to get a little bit into what
[1:06:10] this fruit is more john chapter 13 verse
[1:06:13] 34
[1:06:15] john chapter 13 verse 34 a new
[1:06:17] commandment i give unto you
[1:06:20] that you love one another
[1:06:22] as i have loved you
[1:06:24] that ye also love one another
[1:06:30] so if i got this water
[1:06:34] and i come over here and i say gabe
[1:06:37] i want to give you this water
[1:06:40] and i want you to give
[1:06:42] this water onto someone like i have
[1:06:44] given it unto you
[1:06:47] what are you going to do
[1:06:50] i want you to give
[1:06:52] that water to someone as i have given
[1:06:55] water unto you
[1:06:58] you give it to somebody
[1:07:01] all right
[1:07:02] now
[1:07:03] that is what jesus meant when he said
[1:07:06] that you love one another as i have
[1:07:09] loved you
[1:07:11] now we all can brag about how much jesus
[1:07:13] loved us
[1:07:15] he's done so much for us he forgives us
[1:07:18] every day when we get on our knees to
[1:07:20] say god i'm sorry for my sins today and
[1:07:22] you know what it is the love of god that
[1:07:24] forgives us
[1:07:27] and now he turns around to his disciples
[1:07:29] and he says
[1:07:30] i wa i'm giving you a new commandment
[1:07:34] and you've got to love others the same
[1:07:35] way i'm loving you
[1:07:38] not almost not if it works out for your
[1:07:40] convenience but this is a commandment
[1:07:44] focus on it it's a commandment
[1:07:51] and then he says in verse 35 by this
[1:07:54] shall all men know
[1:07:57] that you're my disciple
[1:08:00] if ye have loved one
[1:08:02] for another
[1:08:04] now brother branham in the unpardonable
[1:08:07] sin is re he refers to this scripture
[1:08:10] as that is where there is divine perfect
[1:08:15] love of god resting in the heart
[1:08:19] so catch this it takes the divine love
[1:08:22] of god to love someone anyone the exact
[1:08:26] same way that god has loved you because
[1:08:28] god has loved you with an unconditional
[1:08:31] divine love
[1:08:34] from the heart of god to you
[1:08:36] and now he says you take that same love
[1:08:39] and you love somebody else with it don't
[1:08:41] try to deal with your own love it's a
[1:08:43] respect to persons it'll come short and
[1:08:45] you've got to love with his love
[1:08:50] now jesus said in matthew that you shall
[1:08:52] know them by your fruits
[1:08:54] he says here in john by this shall all
[1:08:56] men know you're my disciples
[1:09:00] if you have love one for another so this
[1:09:03] must be a fruit
[1:09:07] more than just
[1:09:13] an episode
[1:09:18] if it's just an episode then you're
[1:09:19] going to have the mixed tree again
[1:09:22] but
[1:09:24] it
[1:09:25] this that jesus is referring to
[1:09:27] it's a fruit
[1:09:29] if we have love one for another
[1:09:33] love is the first fruit of the spirit
[1:09:36] that's talked about galatians
[1:09:39] but i'll say this is more than a fruit
[1:09:43] it's the nature of god
[1:09:46] it's divine love
[1:09:49] and it is the commandment that jesus
[1:09:51] gave us that we love one another as
[1:09:53] jesus has loved us that he also love one
[1:09:57] another and i'll say so little emphasis
[1:10:00] is put on this commandment
[1:10:05] we're sure to knock on the door when we
[1:10:07] need god's love
[1:10:10] when's the last time you knocked on the
[1:10:12] door and said lord i don't even want to
[1:10:14] face anybody without your love today
[1:10:20] i don't want to fake it
[1:10:21] right
[1:10:23] i don't want to be a storefront i don't
[1:10:25] want to run i don't want to hide
[1:10:27] i just want to be so full of the love of
[1:10:29] god
[1:10:30] so little is emphasized to this
[1:10:32] commandment
[1:10:34] we will fight and argue proving we are
[1:10:37] god's
[1:10:39] we will quote the word we will quote the
[1:10:40] message we'll even judge others using
[1:10:43] the word
[1:10:47] but we won't put us under the burden
[1:10:51] of loving the unlovable
[1:10:55] of loving unconditionally of giving
[1:10:57] ourselves regardless if we get slapped
[1:11:00] hit
[1:11:01] we have to prove that we're right we're
[1:11:02] not going to stand there i'm no weaker
[1:11:05] christian i'm not going to let somebody
[1:11:06] do that to me then what are you if you
[1:11:08] won't
[1:11:11] only a christian can take it only the
[1:11:13] divine love of god can stand there and
[1:11:16] have a spirit on his side and thorns on
[1:11:19] his head and whipped and talked about
[1:11:21] and still love them
[1:11:24] you can't do that right amen
[1:11:26] i can't do that you don't want my love
[1:11:29] right
[1:11:30] you want the love of god amen amen and
[1:11:33] you need the love of god
[1:11:35] without i mean how many times you just
[1:11:36] oh i can't love it i can't that the
[1:11:38] person's doing this and
[1:11:40] what are you speaking of you're speaking
[1:11:42] of you're identifying the condition of
[1:11:45] your love
[1:11:48] with with all your problems
[1:11:51] and everybody can have the same
[1:11:52] testimony
[1:11:54] but when you get filled
[1:11:56] talk about having the holy ghost
[1:11:58] when we get filled with the love of god
[1:12:02] there is no problem because there's no
[1:12:04] problem with god
[1:12:07] we're going to amen about my problem are
[1:12:09] we going to talk about how great god is
[1:12:12] amen
[1:12:14] brother man says and everything around
[1:12:16] that germ of life must not only die but
[1:12:19] it'll rot if it doesn't rot it cannot
[1:12:22] live and rod is completely done away
[1:12:24] with it it's finished and until we get
[1:12:27] to the place
[1:12:28] that our own ideas and our own thinking
[1:12:31] is completely gone and rotten away from
[1:12:33] us then that germ of life can begin to
[1:12:36] live
[1:12:38] i'll just say whatever you're struggling
[1:12:40] with
[1:12:41] it's because something's standing in the
[1:12:43] way of that germ of life
[1:12:45] coming to life coming to manifestation
[1:12:51] and he says you've got to get desperate
[1:12:54] get desperate
[1:12:57] john chapter 15 verse number one
[1:13:02] jesus said i am the true vine
[1:13:06] and my father
[1:13:07] is the husbandman
[1:13:09] every branch in me that beareth not
[1:13:12] fruit
[1:13:13] is taken away
[1:13:15] and every branch that beareth fruit he
[1:13:18] purges it that it may bring forth
[1:13:21] more fruit
[1:13:24] now i know
[1:13:26] those everybody that's ever worked with
[1:13:28] me
[1:13:30] knows
[1:13:32] have thought
[1:13:34] that
[1:13:37] isn't it good enough
[1:13:40] come on can you say amen
[1:13:43] it's the truth
[1:13:46] and sometimes we've heard preaching
[1:13:50] i say is it is it that's enough can we
[1:13:53] have something different
[1:13:56] but the very nature of god does not want
[1:13:58] you to remain as fruitful as you are
[1:14:03] can you say amen
[1:14:05] i'm not taking away your fruit god's not
[1:14:07] taking away your fruit
[1:14:09] but what he wants is more fruit
[1:14:11] we're talking about the way that god his
[1:14:13] thoughts are higher than our thoughts
[1:14:15] his ways are higher than our ways and we
[1:14:17] need to we need to we need the mind of
[1:14:19] christ it's okay if if god sends a trial
[1:14:24] our way to make us be more fruitful
[1:14:29] i'm okay with it
[1:14:31] i'm okay with it
[1:14:32] if there's one way we're going to reach
[1:14:34] perfection it's god's way
[1:14:37] it ain't going to be me trying to defend
[1:14:39] myself and saying god i don't i don't
[1:14:41] think i need to go through the church i
[1:14:42] don't think this is fair i think i've
[1:14:44] done more than everybody else who cares
[1:14:47] who cares if you did more than everybody
[1:14:49] else god's still calling you a lot
[1:14:51] higher than everybody else
[1:14:54] he's calling us to places we can't even
[1:14:56] see we can't father we haven't
[1:14:58] experienced yet so we need to believe
[1:15:00] for it
[1:15:01] he knows what he's doing
[1:15:04] now you're clean through the word which
[1:15:05] i have spoken unto you
[1:15:09] hmm that's why you take it and live it
[1:15:12] that's it
[1:15:13] abide in me and i in you
[1:15:17] that's the word as the branch cannot
[1:15:19] bear fruit of itself except it abide in
[1:15:21] the vine no more can you except you
[1:15:23] abide in me how many times have we tried
[1:15:26] to love somebody when we weren't
[1:15:27] connected to jesus
[1:15:32] how many times we just want to throw in
[1:15:33] the towel
[1:15:36] we have the answer right here we just
[1:15:38] need to humble ourselves and get more
[1:15:40] connected to the lord
[1:15:42] i am the vine ye are the branches he
[1:15:45] that abideth in me and i in him the same
[1:15:47] bringeth forth
[1:15:48] much
[1:15:50] fruit
[1:15:52] much fruit he promised to do extremely
[1:15:54] above all that we would ask or even
[1:15:56] thank
[1:15:58] much fruit
[1:16:00] and let's just get right down to it
[1:16:03] for without me you can do nothing
[1:16:05] just get it out of your head
[1:16:08] he's getting us to rely on him which we
[1:16:11] should amen
[1:16:13] if a man abide not in me
[1:16:16] in other words he's just
[1:16:19] coming to come
[1:16:21] just just wants to be forgiven of his
[1:16:23] sins and that's it
[1:16:25] no abiding no relationship no working on
[1:16:28] it no growing no fruit no much more no
[1:16:32] don't like the pruning
[1:16:36] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[1:16:38] forth as a branch
[1:16:40] and is withered
[1:16:43] and
[1:16:44] you know what that withered means right
[1:16:46] you just don't got joy
[1:16:49] you just don't got that
[1:16:51] love and peace and long suffering and
[1:16:53] gentleness and meekness you're just all
[1:16:56] dried up
[1:17:00] and men gather them and cast them into
[1:17:02] the fire and they are burned
[1:17:04] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:17:08] you
[1:17:09] not
[1:17:10] you
[1:17:10] speaking his word
[1:17:12] but his word abiding in you that's
[1:17:16] totally different
[1:17:18] you can be so out of the spirit and just
[1:17:20] use the word use the word but god ain't
[1:17:22] looking for that he's looking for us to
[1:17:23] take the word that we hear today take it
[1:17:26] home and apply it put it in our lives
[1:17:28] that's the word abiding in you
[1:17:31] if you abide in me in my words abiding
[1:17:33] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[1:17:35] be done unto you
[1:17:39] god has reserved
[1:17:41] something special for the relationship
[1:17:45] for for an intimate relationship
[1:17:49] herein is my father glorified
[1:17:52] that you bear
[1:17:54] much
[1:17:54] fruit
[1:17:56] oh my you want to glorify i came to
[1:17:59] glorify his name
[1:18:01] we can sing it
[1:18:03] we can enjoy the praises of it
[1:18:06] or we can bear much fruit
[1:18:10] so shall ye be my disciples
[1:18:13] as the father have loved me so i have
[1:18:15] loved you
[1:18:17] continue in my love if you keep my
[1:18:19] commandments you shall abide in my love
[1:18:21] even as i have kept my father's
[1:18:22] commandments and abide in his love
[1:18:25] these things have i spoken unto you that
[1:18:27] my joy might remain
[1:18:29] in you
[1:18:31] and that your joy might be
[1:18:33] full
[1:18:36] notice closely
[1:18:37] if we don't keep his commandments
[1:18:40] we will not remain in the vine of his
[1:18:43] love
[1:18:44] we have to be interested in keeping the
[1:18:46] commandments i don't know you know so
[1:18:48] many people talk about the love of god
[1:18:49] the love of god love and they're not
[1:18:50] even
[1:18:51] they don't pay any attention to the
[1:18:52] commandments
[1:18:54] and that it's just so contrary to what
[1:18:56] jesus is teaching here
[1:18:59] if we don't keep the commandments we're
[1:19:01] not going to remain in the vine of his
[1:19:03] love
[1:19:05] and if we don't remain in the vine of
[1:19:06] his love his joy won't remain with us
[1:19:12] if we don't keep
[1:19:14] the first fruit
[1:19:17] love
[1:19:17] then we don't get the second fruit joy
[1:19:22] now i'm just speaking the truth
[1:19:25] because
[1:19:26] we want his fruit to remain
[1:19:29] when you can love the unlovable that is
[1:19:31] not you that's christ in you that's the
[1:19:33] fruit of the holy ghost
[1:19:35] when you got joy unspeakable full of
[1:19:38] glory that's not you happy
[1:19:41] that's christ in you when the bottoms
[1:19:44] falling out
[1:19:45] when you got the peace of god that
[1:19:47] passeth all understanding it will keep
[1:19:49] you amen because it is the peace of god
[1:19:54] he is our peace
[1:20:01] this is my commandment that you love one
[1:20:04] another
[1:20:05] as i have loved
[1:20:08] you
[1:20:09] here it is again we're hearing the same
[1:20:11] thing again
[1:20:15] do you love me do you love me
[1:20:20] it's a good question
[1:20:22] do you love me
[1:20:24] the way that christ has loved you
[1:20:32] do you love the person you're sitting
[1:20:34] next to
[1:20:36] the person across the aisle across the
[1:20:40] the person that's not here do you love
[1:20:42] them the way that christ loves you
[1:20:46] why we need to put an emphasis to this
[1:20:49] i'm telling you this is where christ is
[1:20:52] taking us
[1:20:53] before the rapture this is where he's
[1:20:55] taking us if we don't get there we're
[1:20:58] not going
[1:21:02] greater love have no man than this
[1:21:05] that a man lay down his life
[1:21:08] for his friends
[1:21:11] how many times did brother branham get
[1:21:13] up behind the pulpit and he'd say good
[1:21:15] morning friends
[1:21:16] everyone was his friend
[1:21:18] jesus called judas his friend
[1:21:21] i mean to have the
[1:21:23] the the love of god so full in your
[1:21:26] heart that you just love everyone
[1:21:31] and there's no greater love than this
[1:21:33] than a man lay down his life for his
[1:21:36] friends
[1:21:41] they would come to brother brand they'd
[1:21:42] say oh brother man i love you but he
[1:21:44] knew they didn't
[1:21:46] they were just words
[1:21:48] but he still loved them
[1:21:51] because it was no longer brother branham
[1:21:54] amen he was the first fruit it was
[1:21:55] christ in him
[1:21:58] and i'll tell you you can have it i can
[1:22:00] have it we can have it but we've got to
[1:22:02] believe that this is what we must do it
[1:22:05] can't be an option for us it's not an
[1:22:07] option for the bride it will be for the
[1:22:09] nominal church but it won't be for the
[1:22:11] bride
[1:22:13] ye are my friends if you do whatsoever i
[1:22:17] command you
[1:22:20] oh now
[1:22:22] now
[1:22:24] now we have this stipulation
[1:22:27] jesus will be afraid to everybody
[1:22:30] but we can't be his friend until we
[1:22:32] keep
[1:22:33] his commandment think about that
[1:22:38] we have a part to play
[1:22:40] henceforth i call you not servants for
[1:22:42] the servant knoweth not what is lord
[1:22:44] doeth but i have called you friends for
[1:22:46] all things that i have heard of my
[1:22:47] father i have made known unto you aren't
[1:22:49] you glad that we have a ministry that
[1:22:52] just says it like it is
[1:22:54] not holding back not afraid that not
[1:22:56] going to be liked better not say this
[1:22:58] but you can hear the full word of god
[1:23:01] amen
[1:23:02] i'm so glad that god sent a prophet that
[1:23:04] would not hold back at all
[1:23:06] we can have confidence
[1:23:10] you have not chosen me
[1:23:13] jesus said here but i have chosen you
[1:23:17] i've chosen you and i've ordained you
[1:23:20] that you should go
[1:23:22] and bring forth
[1:23:24] fruit
[1:23:27] and that your fruit
[1:23:28] should remain
[1:23:31] if it don't remain it don't do any good
[1:23:35] it don't matter about the past
[1:23:39] you don't ever see paul bragging about
[1:23:41] his past
[1:23:46] no
[1:23:47] don't you think he says you know what
[1:23:49] i'm pressing towards the mark
[1:23:51] i've got something in front of me
[1:23:53] i got a prize for the high calling
[1:23:56] i'm pressing towards that
[1:24:03] there's a fruit
[1:24:04] that we ought to be bearing
[1:24:07] today
[1:24:12] and you know you don't need to be in
[1:24:13] church to bear it
[1:24:16] you'd be right you're home
[1:24:19] when somebody yells at you
[1:24:21] are they called for the 13th time and
[1:24:23] they want to put new windows in your
[1:24:24] house
[1:24:26] whatever it is
[1:24:28] or you ordered
[1:24:30] a pizza a certain way
[1:24:34] and they brought something totally
[1:24:36] different and you can't eat it
[1:24:38] that's the time to shine
[1:24:41] right don't let it get under your skin
[1:24:43] and boil up and the old man come out
[1:24:48] the new man christ in you
[1:24:50] he needs to just
[1:24:54] be manifested
[1:24:55] see to me trials can be looked at two
[1:24:57] ways one
[1:24:59] i don't want it in my life get rid of
[1:25:00] them shouldn't happen to me why me again
[1:25:02] oh my oh me
[1:25:03] and the other way is i have a chance to
[1:25:06] shine for jesus
[1:25:09] it's just how you want to look at it
[1:25:11] it's your attitude
[1:25:13] it makes a difference
[1:25:15] but either way
[1:25:16] we've been called and ordained not to be
[1:25:18] a church pew sitter
[1:25:22] but that we should go out
[1:25:25] bear fruit
[1:25:27] much fruit amen and that it keeps going
[1:25:30] it remains that every time god looks he
[1:25:33] sees the fruit amen
[1:25:35] everybody you're talking to every
[1:25:36] situation you're bearing fruit
[1:25:40] that whatsoever ye shall ask of the
[1:25:42] father in my name he may give it to you
[1:25:46] notice how these are always connected to
[1:25:48] the commandments
[1:25:50] that we need to do something if we're
[1:25:52] feeling we're just going to be able to
[1:25:53] have liberty to use the name of jesus
[1:25:57] right
[1:25:58] come on it's about a relationship
[1:26:03] i mean if
[1:26:04] my wife she just i saw her step in the
[1:26:07] back so
[1:26:08] if she every time she seen me she says
[1:26:10] give me money give me money but she
[1:26:12] won't even give me a hug
[1:26:17] one make me a baloney sandwich
[1:26:19] i think that would just be unfair
[1:26:22] you know to use me i don't think jesus
[1:26:24] wants to be used
[1:26:26] he's interested in a relationship
[1:26:29] these things i command you that you love
[1:26:32] one another so here it is the theme of
[1:26:36] what we just read in the last 17 verses
[1:26:38] is love
[1:26:39] yes that's the fruit that he's looking
[1:26:41] for are you with me
[1:26:45] brother brandon says this in the message
[1:26:46] beyond the curtain of time he said he he
[1:26:49] said then a voice spoke to me so this is
[1:26:52] a voice
[1:26:54] this is what you preached
[1:26:57] that the holy ghost is
[1:27:00] this is perfect love
[1:27:03] nothing can enter here without it
[1:27:07] so when you're listening to the tapes
[1:27:10] the messages
[1:27:13] the holy ghost is preaching you know
[1:27:15] what you're hearing
[1:27:17] you're hearing perfect love
[1:27:21] because that's what the voice said amen
[1:27:24] this is what you preached is the holy
[1:27:26] ghost this is perfect love
[1:27:30] when you're hearing these commandments
[1:27:32] this is god's perfect love
[1:27:36] speaking to us
[1:27:38] through the prophet
[1:27:41] this is the working of the holy spirit
[1:27:43] it isn't some feeling is it some emotion
[1:27:46] it isn't some uh
[1:27:48] god used me no no it's a perfect love
[1:27:51] manifested at all times
[1:27:58] nothing can enter
[1:28:01] here
[1:28:02] without it so brother band didn't say
[1:28:04] that
[1:28:05] the voice spoke that right
[1:28:09] so all sudden we got a gatekeeper
[1:28:12] and the gatekeeper saying
[1:28:14] yeah i'm glad you've been repented glad
[1:28:17] you got baptized glad you at the church
[1:28:19] glad you paid your tithes but i'm
[1:28:20] telling you nothing but perfect love is
[1:28:22] coming in amen
[1:28:27] i think we should be interested
[1:28:30] in
[1:28:30] in this fruit
[1:28:32] remaining in our life
[1:28:37] then you voice still speaking then you
[1:28:40] will present us to him
[1:28:42] and all together we will go back
[1:28:45] to earth to live forever
[1:28:47] i asked do i have to go back to earth
[1:28:50] now
[1:28:52] face they answered they answered yes
[1:28:55] but keep pressing on
[1:28:58] this is really important
[1:29:01] keep pressing on
[1:29:04] god as long as we're here and god hasn't
[1:29:06] taken us
[1:29:07] god's heart for you you don't need to
[1:29:09] ask them god wants you to be pressing in
[1:29:11] towards the mark towards the image of
[1:29:13] christ towards perfect love that's what
[1:29:15] he wants you to be doing
[1:29:17] and not in your spare time because we
[1:29:19] don't got much time
[1:29:21] and i'll tell you i don't care if my
[1:29:24] loved ones don't go with me
[1:29:27] we still gotta go
[1:29:30] [Applause]
[1:29:33] i'm not talking about salvation i'm
[1:29:34] talking about a rapture
[1:29:39] suddenly i was back on the bed again
[1:29:43] now look listen to the heart of the
[1:29:45] prophet
[1:29:47] i said oh god help me
[1:29:50] never let me compromise with the word
[1:29:53] don't let me just ignore it and go home
[1:29:58] let me stay straight on the word
[1:30:00] i don't care what anybody else does
[1:30:05] i'm so glad he said that i don't care
[1:30:07] what anybody else does lord let me
[1:30:10] press on to that beautiful joyful place
[1:30:15] he didn't leave the podium
[1:30:18] yes i'm going i'm there i witnessed it
[1:30:22] i'm lord i've done
[1:30:24] no
[1:30:24] his heart was lord let me keep pressing
[1:30:28] let me keep pressing
[1:30:31] what is that's the spirit that we're
[1:30:33] talking about
[1:30:35] because that's the spirit that came from
[1:30:37] heaven and told him
[1:30:39] no you can't stay here right now you got
[1:30:41] to go back but you keep pressing
[1:30:45] but you know what keeps us from pressing
[1:30:48] cares of life
[1:30:52] pleasures riches goals
[1:30:55] what we can have down here what we're
[1:30:57] trying to attain what we're trying to
[1:30:59] achieve what we're
[1:31:02] what about
[1:31:04] the voice from heaven
[1:31:07] calling us
[1:31:08] to a perfect love
[1:31:12] i'd rather i don't care
[1:31:15] what anybody else does
[1:31:17] lord
[1:31:18] i'm going to keep pressing
[1:31:22] don't wait
[1:31:23] for the church
[1:31:28] don't wait to
[1:31:29] everybody's feeling good
[1:31:32] don't wait to the atmosphere
[1:31:34] to say oh yeah that that's a good one
[1:31:38] be what christ wants you to be amen
[1:31:41] the holy ghost in you can do that
[1:31:45] and if it's lacking then just
[1:31:46] be where i'm at press in
[1:31:49] press in for more
[1:31:52] all right brother man says i am more
[1:31:54] convinced than ever in my life that it
[1:31:56] will take perfect love to enter in that
[1:31:59] place
[1:32:00] there was no jealousy no tiredness no
[1:32:02] sickness no old age
[1:32:04] no death only supreme beauty and joy
[1:32:09] whatever you do lay aside everything
[1:32:12] else until you get perfect love and
[1:32:13] we've read this quote many times
[1:32:16] get to where you can love every body
[1:32:19] even your enemy
[1:32:21] now i love this
[1:32:22] no matter if the planes are rocking
[1:32:25] the lightnings are flashing
[1:32:27] or the guns of the enemy are upon you
[1:32:31] he said these things do not matter
[1:32:34] he said get perfect love
[1:32:37] those are just distractions the world is
[1:32:40] just distracting you the news is just
[1:32:42] distracting you the devil is just
[1:32:44] distracting you get perfect love
[1:32:48] whatever you do get perfect love
[1:32:51] we could say like peter
[1:32:53] said giving all diligence
[1:32:56] add to your faith virtue
[1:32:59] we're talk we're talking
[1:33:02] these virtues
[1:33:06] they're they're demonstrated they're
[1:33:10] manifested by the spirit that we live
[1:33:14] give all diligence
[1:33:16] in others whatever you do lay aside
[1:33:18] everything give diligence all diligence
[1:33:21] add to your faith virtue knowledge
[1:33:23] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:33:26] kindness and then what the capstone
[1:33:29] of your building of your life charity
[1:33:34] now that word
[1:33:35] diligence it means speed
[1:33:38] eagerness
[1:33:40] busy
[1:33:41] earnest care forward haste
[1:33:44] i want to say have you dispatched
[1:33:46] yourself for charity
[1:33:48] that's what it means
[1:33:53] is it your calling or is it just
[1:33:56] on your bucket list
[1:33:59] is it just something you you know or is
[1:34:01] it really important to you
[1:34:05] ii peter 1 verse 8 says and if these
[1:34:07] things be in you and abound they make
[1:34:10] you that you should neither be barren or
[1:34:12] nor
[1:34:13] unfruitful
[1:34:16] in the knowledge of our lord jesus
[1:34:18] christ
[1:34:22] this knowledge is not intellectual
[1:34:24] information of truth
[1:34:27] this
[1:34:28] fruitfulness in this knowledge is the
[1:34:31] recognition of full discernment the full
[1:34:34] manifestation of christ in your life
[1:34:36] that you can put on charity
[1:34:41] you can manifest the life
[1:34:44] and i'll tell you i wouldn't worry about
[1:34:46] preaching honestly
[1:34:50] it didn't cross my my mind for many
[1:34:53] years brother johnson about preaching
[1:34:55] many years just never did
[1:34:57] but i'll tell what was on my mind all
[1:34:58] the time
[1:34:59] was manifesting christ
[1:35:03] that's what's important
[1:35:05] because our life
[1:35:07] speaks very loud to people
[1:35:10] so we need to get to the place
[1:35:13] can i have a few extra minutes
[1:35:16] all right what about the rest of you
[1:35:18] i want to talk to you after service
[1:35:22] what good would it do a person to have
[1:35:25] all the knowledge of these virtues
[1:35:28] but wouldn't be able to manifest them
[1:35:32] it would be like someone that was given
[1:35:34] a million dollar account in their life
[1:35:37] but they went through their whole life
[1:35:39] and they were never able to touch it or
[1:35:41] use it
[1:35:42] it would be fruitless
[1:35:45] they would die
[1:35:46] a million dollar account
[1:35:48] go on to his air
[1:35:50] that's what the knowledge
[1:35:52] of these
[1:35:54] intellectual knowledge of these virtues
[1:35:56] would do to somebody who could never
[1:35:58] manifest it when they need them
[1:36:02] it like does no good
[1:36:04] i'll say it would be off the tree of
[1:36:06] knowledge of good and evil see
[1:36:10] the devil knows and he believes but he
[1:36:13] does not live
[1:36:14] right amen
[1:36:16] said in the message israel and the
[1:36:17] church he said and where there's tongues
[1:36:20] it'll cease and where there's knowledge
[1:36:21] it will vanish away but when perfect
[1:36:23] love has come into the human heart all
[1:36:25] demons in hell will never be able to
[1:36:27] upset it
[1:36:31] so i'll tell you i'll stick with that
[1:36:33] quote before
[1:36:35] i'm gonna
[1:36:36] let some
[1:36:37] devil tell me it's okay to get upset and
[1:36:39] angry all the time
[1:36:42] perfect love in the human heart all
[1:36:45] demons in hell will never be able to
[1:36:47] upset it
[1:36:50] i want that don't you
[1:36:52] i want more of that
[1:36:54] brother man said in the message the
[1:36:56] inside man he said it will take perfect
[1:36:58] love to bring us into perfect harmony
[1:37:01] with god think about that statement
[1:37:06] our love don't do it
[1:37:08] our love is selfish i remember when i
[1:37:11] first made my deal with god
[1:37:15] i told him i
[1:37:17] would serve him
[1:37:18] if he would give me cheryl
[1:37:20] it was a deal
[1:37:24] see
[1:37:25] starting out i had restrictions
[1:37:29] but i'll tell you what i was not in
[1:37:31] perfect harmony with god
[1:37:34] it wasn't until i said lord
[1:37:38] i do not want anything above you i do
[1:37:41] not care what your will turns out to be
[1:37:44] i want you i want you in my life come
[1:37:46] into my life lord i will serve you no
[1:37:48] matter what and when i came into perfect
[1:37:51] harmony amen
[1:37:53] it was because i had the right love for
[1:37:55] god
[1:37:56] not a selfish love not a greedy love not
[1:37:59] a false prophet love
[1:38:04] god wants us to remain fruitful
[1:38:08] let's get all of our past achievements
[1:38:11] out of the way
[1:38:13] and start pressing to something you
[1:38:14] don't have
[1:38:16] the high calling i'll say it's perfect
[1:38:18] love
[1:38:20] it's the full manifestation of christ in
[1:38:22] you
[1:38:24] it's the capstone
[1:38:26] the very thing that a lot of church
[1:38:28] members just kick it's not a big deal as
[1:38:30] long as i go to church that's all that
[1:38:32] matters
[1:38:33] you know god he wants to be our head
[1:38:36] he wants to come in just set over here
[1:38:39] and tell us what to do
[1:38:41] i want to encourage you to lay aside
[1:38:43] everything in your in your life
[1:38:46] i know it's hard to do you got a lot
[1:38:48] going you're trying to build your future
[1:38:51] that's right
[1:38:53] and i like how the brother man says he
[1:38:54] said just lay aside everything until
[1:38:58] if you got it
[1:39:00] and your
[1:39:01] and you if you don't got it he'll show
[1:39:03] you
[1:39:04] just wait till the test comes
[1:39:08] when you're unwilling to lay something
[1:39:10] aside
[1:39:12] and go help somebody
[1:39:15] when you're busy
[1:39:18] i'll show you
[1:39:20] we want to lay everything aside till we
[1:39:22] don't have any ill
[1:39:25] towards anybody
[1:39:28] no negative feelings no divisions no no
[1:39:31] respect to persons
[1:39:34] until you're not bothered by people
[1:39:39] we want to get to that place
[1:39:41] no matter what they do no matter what
[1:39:43] the government does no matter what the
[1:39:44] schools do
[1:39:46] no matter what happens
[1:39:49] brother branson says no matter if the
[1:39:50] planes are rocking the lights flashing
[1:39:52] the guns of the enemy or upon you these
[1:39:54] things have
[1:39:56] do
[1:39:57] do not matter
[1:39:58] get perfect love
[1:40:01] now i see so many people get wrapped up
[1:40:04] in this world
[1:40:05] the wrong of this world what's not right
[1:40:08] and what should be happening
[1:40:13] i mean 30 years ago i knew it was wrong
[1:40:15] to blow up an abortion clinic
[1:40:18] but it's gotten so far beyond that now
[1:40:21] so far beyond that
[1:40:24] but
[1:40:25] they put little emphasis on going after
[1:40:28] what god requires to make it in
[1:40:32] it's as if somehow god is just going to
[1:40:35] give it to them no matter what
[1:40:38] but if that's true why would we have a
[1:40:40] prophet in this age
[1:40:42] tell us
[1:40:43] to go do what we need to do
[1:40:47] i think i'd rather believe the prophet
[1:40:49] than what the devil tells me
[1:40:58] get to the place where you can love
[1:41:00] everyone i'm closing
[1:41:02] get to the place where you can love
[1:41:03] everyone
[1:41:05] the same way that christ loves you
[1:41:08] we can all identify how much christ
[1:41:10] loves us
[1:41:11] because we talk about all the times he's
[1:41:13] forgiven us all the times he's bailed
[1:41:15] out all the times he's met our needs
[1:41:17] all the time
[1:41:19] but
[1:41:20] can we love others that way
[1:41:24] so let's get to that place let's start
[1:41:26] let's start putting some time to that
[1:41:28] now what i'm asking you for i'm not
[1:41:30] asking you for for something that we
[1:41:31] want to look at tonight and then forget
[1:41:33] about it and go home
[1:41:36] i'd rather skip tonight go home and live
[1:41:38] the rest of your life be thinking about
[1:41:39] it
[1:41:41] because this is an important important
[1:41:44] subject there's no greater love that we
[1:41:47] could have that we could live out that
[1:41:49] we could manifest than actually taking
[1:41:51] your life
[1:41:54] and given it to help somebody
[1:42:00] every day we have a chance to do that
[1:42:02] i know we got to work i got to work
[1:42:05] sometimes you have to get things in
[1:42:06] order
[1:42:11] but we have a whole life to lay down for
[1:42:13] others
[1:42:15] i told my wife the other day
[1:42:17] i says i enjoy
[1:42:19] living
[1:42:20] for my wife
[1:42:22] i literally enjoy it and it didn't
[1:42:24] matter what she'd asked me to do
[1:42:27] it just it just wouldn't matter
[1:42:30] and
[1:42:31] she's
[1:42:34] she
[1:42:36] doesn't ask ridiculous things and
[1:42:38] doesn't have to be perfect
[1:42:40] there's just a lot of things it's just a
[1:42:42] lot of things
[1:42:44] but i enjoy it
[1:42:46] i thoroughly enjoy it we as the bride
[1:42:48] should thoroughly enjoy
[1:42:51] living for god
[1:42:53] amen the best way we can do it is love
[1:42:55] his people live for live for one another
[1:42:57] amen
[1:43:00] you have not chosen me but stand
[1:43:02] together but i have chosen you
[1:43:04] and ordained you that you should go
[1:43:06] and bring forth fruit
[1:43:08] and that your fruit should remain
[1:43:11] that whatsoever you ask in the father's
[1:43:13] name he will give it to you these things
[1:43:15] i command you that you love
[1:43:18] one another i believe the fruit he's
[1:43:20] looking for is love one for another
[1:43:24] it's the capstone
[1:43:27] amen
[1:43:29] this thing that little course he's all i
[1:43:31] need
[1:43:36] just make love to him
[1:43:38] he's all
[1:43:41] i need
