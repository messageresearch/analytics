[31:34] &gt;&gt; The world is full of colleges
[31:37] wanting to know something.
[31:41] And it's interesting. I mean, watch the
[31:43] Marvel Channel, the Discovery Channel.
[31:47] It's a beautiful thing to learn, but
[31:50] there's nothing more important than than
[31:53] knowing more of the Lord.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; And uh we can only know him by him
[31:59] speaking it to us.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Right? If I speak it, if a man speaks
[32:04] it, or we read it,
[32:07] we'll miss out. And that's why we're
[32:10] desperate to hear the voice of God this
[32:12] morning.
[32:14] That the reality of God speaking to us
[32:16] as individuals. This is why we've come.
[32:18] If this does not happen, I would have to
[32:22] say that our gathering would be in vain.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we are our dependency is on the
[32:29] Lord that he will be here to speak to us

[32:38] you and just good to be back together.

[32:43] scriptures today. The first scripture is
[32:46] going to be Isaiah chapter 30
[32:49] and the second is going to be 3R John
[32:51] chapter 1.
[32:54] 3R John chapter 1. And we want to
[32:57] entitle the message today the voice of
[33:00] our spiritual DNA.
[33:03] The voice of our spiritual DNA.
[33:08] Amen.
[33:10] When you've got to the scripture, say,
[33:13] "Amen."
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's look to the author
[33:18] before we read. Our heavenly father,

[33:24] and the finisher of our faith. We know,
[33:28] Lord, we're somewhere here in the middle
[33:30] of our walk with you. But we know that
[33:33] there is an end to our faith. And it's
[33:36] an expected end, an end of peace, an
[33:39] end. Lord, when we look there in
[33:42] Revelations 19 and verse 7, we we see
[33:47] that there
[33:49] the wife, your wife have made herself
[33:52] ready at the end. And Lord, that's our
[33:55] our our yearning and our desire is to be
[33:59] ready for the rapture. for you said
[34:02] there in Matthew 24, be ready for I come
[34:05] in an hour you know not. Lord, we want
[34:08] to be ready. Our our lambs trimmed and
[34:10] clear and our and and just full of the
[34:13] Holy Ghost this morning, full of your
[34:15] love. Lord, may you come now in the
[34:18] breaking of the bread of life. May this
[34:21] message, Lord, uh be uh received in the
[34:26] simplicity in which it was intended to
[34:28] be. God will give you the praise for all
[34:31] these things. For we humbly pray now in
[34:34] Jesus Christ's precious name. Amen.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah chapter 30 and verse 21
[34:41] says, "And thine ears shall hear a word
[34:46] behind thee, saying, this is the way.
[34:50] Walk ye in it when you turn to the right
[34:53] hand and when you turn to the left."
[34:57] Amen. And then third John chapter 1,
[35:03] this is the way. Walk ye in it. Amen.
[35:07] That's the voice that uh we're hearing
[35:10] behind us. Amen. And then 3R John
[35:14] chapter 1 verse4 says, I have no greater
[35:18] joy than to hear that my children walk
[35:21] in truth.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[35:28] We all have DNA.
[35:32] Actually, all living organisms have DNA.
[35:36] It serves as a complete instruction
[35:40] manual to build another you.
[35:44] That's why they can go back now and from
[35:48] 50 years later get the DNA out of
[35:52] somebody's body and be able to tell who
[35:55] who it is or tie it to a
[35:58] a a crime
[36:00] because inside that is really who you
[36:04] are.
[36:06] Just they can tell by that that one it's
[36:09] a complex molecule that blueprints
[36:11] exactly who you are.
[36:14] And a specific segment of each DNA is
[36:18] called a gene which contains the
[36:21] instructions of making you there. It's
[36:24] the the the vehicle that tells uh parts
[36:29] of your body what to be the the proteins
[36:32] or how your liver or what's going to
[36:34] happen. So that that that that segment
[36:37] of the gene I that segment of the DNA
[36:40] called the gene, it contains the
[36:43] instructions.
[36:45] Now we've all heard of having certain
[36:47] genetics that are passed on by our
[36:49] parents. Physical traits that appear
[36:52] like hair color or the the shape of your
[36:55] your nose or the freckles. But they're
[36:59] also traits that are not seen. traits
[37:02] like diabetes or or heart problems. And
[37:06] you've often heard uh
[37:09] somebody say that um they've got this in
[37:13] their life because their parents had it.
[37:18] And uh there are also other traits like
[37:21] mental and behavior traits that can also
[37:24] be passed on through the genes of your
[37:27] parents into you.
[37:29] Now, we've all have certain genes inside
[37:32] of us that are hereditary. Now, there
[37:34] are two different types of genes. One's
[37:36] hereditary and one is is not hereditary.
[37:38] And those are ones that can actually
[37:40] evolve in in your in your life after
[37:43] you're born. But these ones that are
[37:44] hereditary, they are passed down from
[37:46] generation onto generation.
[37:50] And and I mean, I'm talking about 10
[37:52] generations. I mean, we've got stuff
[37:54] inside of us that go back, let's see,
[37:56] hundred, let's see, what would that be?
[37:59] Uh, how many generations? I mean, that's
[38:02] thousands of years. That's a long time
[38:03] ago. I mean, we got stuff in us that
[38:08] when we were over on the other side of
[38:10] the planet, our our relatives were on
[38:12] the other side of the planet, we
[38:13] literally got their genes from a long
[38:15] time ago.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; And um, how many times have you ever
[38:18] heard your children say to you, "Thanks,
[38:22] mom. Thanks, Dad. Now I got this because
[38:24] of you.
[38:27] It's just hereditary. You You can't
[38:29] choose. It's just part of it.
[38:34] Now, Leviticus 17:1 says, "For the life
[38:40] of the flesh
[38:42] is in the blood,
[38:45] and I have given it to you upon the
[38:47] altar to make an atonement for your
[38:49] souls. For it is the blood that maketh
[38:52] an atonement for your soul. So inside
[38:56] our natural uh body is the blood. And
[38:59] brother Brandon has taught us that the
[39:02] life is in the blood. That's where um
[39:05] you you you your you can learn about
[39:09] your genetics and learn about your DNA.
[39:15] And the scripture makes it clear that
[39:17] the life of the flesh is in the blood.
[39:20] It's not in the muscle. It is not in the
[39:23] organ. It's in the blood. The blood is
[39:25] what transfers the oxygen, the the the
[39:29] the minerals, the proteins, the
[39:31] nutrients that is needed to get to all
[39:34] the organs so we can function. It also
[39:36] has that part where it takes away the
[39:38] the the bad stuff and it it separates
[39:42] and that is how we function. Now we are
[39:45] going somewhere with us. Amen. This
[39:48] morning, Exodus 12:12 says, "For I will
[39:52] pass through the land of Egypt this
[39:53] night.
[39:55] And I will smite all the firstborn in
[39:59] the land of Egypt, both man and beast,
[40:01] and against all the gods of Egypt, I
[40:03] will execute judgment. I am the Lord."
[40:06] Now, the firstborn here represents all
[40:09] those who do not receive the second
[40:12] birth. Can you say amen? Or or the
[40:15] second nature
[40:18] &gt;&gt; or the or the DNA. The DNA has to be
[40:22] changed. That's what that's that's
[40:24] really what it's all about. When you're
[40:26] born again, you no longer have the DNA
[40:29] of Satan that we were born with. We have
[40:31] the DNA of God.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; And verse 13, and the blood shall be to
[40:38] you for a token upon your houses wherein
[40:42] you are. And when I see the blood, I'll
[40:45] pass over you. When I see that life now,
[40:48] back then, the Old Testament was all
[40:50] natural. The the the wars were natural.
[40:53] Um everything was natural.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; In the New Testament is spiritual
[40:58] warfare. In the New Testament, it's the
[41:01] life that's in the blood.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; It's not the literal uh bloody life, but
[41:05] it's the spirit that's in that blood.
[41:09] So when I see the blow pass over you and
[41:12] the plague shall not be unto you to
[41:14] destroy you when I smite the land of
[41:17] Egypt. So God is going to smite this
[41:19] earth. He's going to burn it with fire.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; And this day shall be unto you for a
[41:27] memorial. Now catch this. I want you to
[41:29] see the DNA here. And ye shall keep it
[41:31] as a feast to the Lord throughout your
[41:34] generations. You shall keep it a feast
[41:37] by an ordinance forever.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Now God is the same yesterday, today,
[41:43] and forever. His DNA is the same
[41:46] yesterday. And it is passed on from
[41:48] generation unto generation.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; And this life that's in the blood, if
[41:54] it's applied to us today, it will be the
[41:57] same as the blood that was applied on
[41:58] the day of Pentecost. Amen.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; The feast of the blood being applied.
[42:04] The feast. It shall be unto you a feast.
[42:07] I'll call it the feast of the blood
[42:10] being applied. If we don't apply the
[42:12] blood, it don't do us any good.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; The DNA has to be changed.
[42:20] Well, Jesus died for the whole world,
[42:21] but is the whole world going to be
[42:23] saved?
[42:25] &gt;&gt; And it's not saying I believe that Jesus
[42:27] died
[42:30] is believing
[42:32] what Jesus died for.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; It's not the knowledge. See, the Satan
[42:39] has the knowledge
[42:42] that Jesus died on the cross.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; They know it. I mean, the devils believe
[42:47] and they tremble. But the belief is the
[42:52] plan of God is for us to accept the life
[42:55] that came through that blood so our DNA
[42:58] can be changed into God's DNA. Our
[43:01] nature can be changed.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; So it does no good to say I believe and
[43:09] not receive the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; We are not saved by a personal belief.
[43:20] We are saved by the blood of Jesus
[43:22] Christ. And I'm not speaking the
[43:24] natural. I'm speaking of the spiritual.
[43:27] Now, the natural had to be paid. Calvary
[43:30] had to happen.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; But we have to receive now the life
[43:40] &gt;&gt; is is It it and that's what I love about
[43:44] the word of God.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; It helps us to see clearly than what man
[43:49] thinks it is. Can you say amen?
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So for the life of the flesh is in
[43:58] the blood. Now Jesus speaking here in
[44:02] Matthew 28 of of Matthew 26:28. He says,
[44:06] "For this is my blood of the new
[44:10] testament which is shed for many for the
[44:13] remission of sins."
[44:20] But now in order to receive the
[44:22] remission of sins, the blood has to be
[44:24] applied. And if the blood is applied,
[44:26] the DNA of our nature will be changed.
[44:29] That's what I'm saying. How many people
[44:30] do we know that say they're born again
[44:32] and they do the very same things they
[44:34] did when they were in the world?
[44:36] like nothing has changed.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Like where is that in the gospel?
[44:41] &gt;&gt; But there's churches that that will
[44:43] accept that because
[44:45] because they want you as a member. I
[44:48] mean I don't I don't really know. Maybe
[44:50] because they just don't have an
[44:51] understanding. They just think it's an
[44:52] intellectual belief that you make it.
[44:56] But God is really interested in seeing
[44:58] us walk into the in the truth. Right.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; He he wants to see our lives changed.
[45:05] and to become more like him.
[45:08] So the feast of the blood being applied
[45:10] is what changes the DNA into Christ. So
[45:15] we're really have the same nature as
[45:17] God. In 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse
[45:20] 16,
[45:22] we're going to touch on this verse and
[45:24] then come back to it. But wherefore
[45:26] henceforth know we no man after the
[45:28] flesh. Yay, though we have known Christ
[45:30] after the flesh, yet now henceforth know
[45:33] we him no more. So it's no more about
[45:37] physically knowing God. That means us
[45:40] intellectually figuring out what the
[45:42] Bible says.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; It's no longer the natural blood or the
[45:48] natural DNA,
[45:51] but it's the life of the blood or the
[45:53] spiritual DNA.
[45:58] Brother Brandham said on the wings of a
[45:59] snow white dove. He says I believe the
[46:02] blood is regeneration.
[46:06] That is what regenerates our life is the
[46:10] life that was in the blood of Christ,
[46:12] the Holy Ghost, the life of God. Now
[46:15] that word regeneration means spiritual
[46:19] rebirth,
[46:21] spiritual renovation.
[46:24] Uh so you know a lot of people want to
[46:26] reform themselves. They want to go to
[46:28] church and they want to just, you know,
[46:29] try to be a better person, try to, you
[46:33] know, get some better habits, be more
[46:35] polite, not yell at the wife or not yell
[46:37] at the husband or be nice to the
[46:39] neighbor and and and try to develop a
[46:42] better sense of being a better person.
[46:45] But that is not spiritual rebirth.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; That that it's it's a reformation of the
[46:51] old nature. It's like going to AA
[46:53] meetings. I talked to somebody and he
[46:55] he's he's still going to a a meetings
[46:58] and he's pretty proud uh uh of of how
[47:02] long um he's been able to go and you
[47:05] know many people they go to those those
[47:07] meetings and they're good for a little
[47:10] bit and then they they revert back
[47:12] because the nature never got changed
[47:15] &gt;&gt; and and we as Christians we understand
[47:18] that we need the life of God inside of
[47:20] us. Brother Brandham says you you can't
[47:22] live it. You are not meant to live the
[47:24] word. Only God can live the word in you.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Which makes us either a part of God or
[47:29] are not a part of God. All they that
[47:31] were ordained to eternal life, they
[47:33] received the word of God.
[47:36] Matthew 19:25, for when his disciples
[47:39] heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,
[47:41] and they said, "Who can be saved? If
[47:45] it's so hard to be saved, who then can
[47:47] be saved?"
[47:49] But Jesus beheld them and said unto
[47:50] them, "With men, this is impossible.
[47:53] You can't you could build a a tower of
[47:55] Babel, but it's impossible.
[47:58] But with God, all things are possible."
[48:02] &gt;&gt; And then answered Peter and said unto
[48:04] him, "Behold, we have forsaken all and
[48:07] follow thee. What is there left for us
[48:09] to do?"
[48:11] How many feels that you have forsaken
[48:13] all?
[48:19] I mean, Peter said he forsook all. I I
[48:22] think it's a I think it's a good uh it's
[48:26] a good thing to to take a stand and say,
[48:28] "I have forsaken all
[48:31] &gt;&gt; because if if we don't get to that
[48:32] place, we got to get to that place
[48:34] before we get to where Jesus told Peter
[48:37] he needs to go."
[48:39] And Jesus said unto them, "Verily, I say
[48:41] unto you that ye which have followed me
[48:44] in the regeneration."
[48:46] Now, that's a spiritual rebirth.
[48:49] Because that hadn't happened yet, right?
[48:51] At that point, it hadn't happened yet.
[48:56] When the son of man shall sit in the
[48:58] throne of his glory,
[49:00] if I could say it like like this, when
[49:02] he sits in your heart, sits in the
[49:05] throne room of and and receives glory
[49:07] for the life that you're living, ye
[49:10] shall also sit upon the 12 thrones
[49:14] judging the uh the 12 tribes of Israel.
[49:17] Of course, we know that's down the road,
[49:20] that part.
[49:22] Now look at what it takes to follow
[49:24] Jesus into the spiritual rebirth. Verse
[49:26] 29. And everyone that have forsaken
[49:29] houses, brethren, sisters, or fathers,
[49:33] or mothers, or wife, or children, or
[49:36] lands for my name's sake shall receive a
[49:40] hundfold and shall inher inherit eternal
[49:43] life. See, it's a little bit more than
[49:45] just saying, I believe Jesus died for
[49:47] me.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; It's a little bit more than that. And
[49:50] that's why Jesus encourages,
[49:53] if I could use that word, search the
[49:56] scriptures,
[49:57] &gt;&gt; for in them you think you have eternal
[49:59] life, but they are they which testify of
[50:01] me. They tell us how to believe. The
[50:04] scriptures tell us how to believe
[50:05] correctly.
[50:08] So we we don't want to know Christ in
[50:11] the flesh, but in the spirit.
[50:15] 1 Corinthians 12:13 tells us, "For by
[50:18] one spirit are we all baptized into one
[50:21] body."
[50:23] One spirit, one DNA
[50:26] baptizes us into the body. It's not
[50:29] something that, you know, some churches
[50:31] say, "Well, we don't really know how to
[50:32] do that." So, if you would just please
[50:34] come and put your name on the book,
[50:36] we'll just say that you're in.
[50:39] or since I don't know how to manif.
[50:49] But in reality,
[50:52] it's by the Holy Ghost birthing the DNA
[50:56] inside of you that you become part of
[50:58] God's family. And nothing short of that
[51:01] will work.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Church attendance won't work. Money
[51:04] won't work.
[51:06] By one spirit are we all baptized into
[51:10] the body. Whether you be Jew or Greek or
[51:13] Jew, I'm sorry, Jews or Gentiles,
[51:15] whether we be bond or free. It doesn't
[51:17] matter who you are. And have all and
[51:21] been all made to drink into one spirit.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Drink into one spirit. Oh, I wish we had
[51:30] more time to take our time, but I just
[51:33] need you to stay with me. The feast of
[51:36] the blood being applied is what changes
[51:38] the DNA.
[51:40] Jesus said in John 6:56, "He that eateth
[51:44] my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood
[51:47] dwelleth in me, and I in him."
[51:57] &gt;&gt; We got to drink the Holy Ghost.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; We've got to eat the word. Now, what
[52:01] that really means to eat the word is
[52:03] when you when you actually hear the word
[52:06] that you leave church and you say, "I'm
[52:09] going to live that word."
[52:13] It isn't saying, "By
[52:17] I've already heard this before.
[52:20] I I already know that. I intellectually
[52:22] believe it's true." You've got to leave
[52:25] with the DNA
[52:28] of becoming that word. Amen.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; What good will it do to sit in a church
[52:33] all your life, hear the absolute truth,
[52:36] &gt;&gt; and it never change you?
[52:38] &gt;&gt; I think about this little hole in a wall
[52:40] here, and I know it's a beautiful place.
[52:42] It's a beautiful country. I love the
[52:45] church. But I'm saying in the midst of
[52:48] this whole city,
[52:52] nobody knows the truth is here.
[52:59] It is the only thing that can set us
[53:01] free from the old DNA.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; The wrong nature is the nature of God by
[53:07] one spirit. And he says, "He that eats
[53:09] my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood, he
[53:10] dwells in me and I dwell in him."
[53:13] There's a union there. There's a oneness
[53:15] there. And as the living father hath
[53:17] sent me, and I live by the Father, so he
[53:21] that eateth me, even he shall live by
[53:25] me.
[53:27] We no longer do what we want to do.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; We no longer just come to church and and
[53:33] and play part like play church.
[53:37] If I could say it like that. We don't
[53:38] play church. We become the church.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; We become the church of the living God.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; We're living by the spiritual DNA of
[53:47] Jesus.
[53:49] When we eat the word and we we drink the
[53:52] blood, we receive the Holy Ghost inside
[53:55] of us, we receive the DNA of God, the
[53:59] spiritual DNA.
[54:01] Verse 58, this is that bread. This is
[54:05] that bread that came down from heaven,
[54:07] not as your fathers did eat mana and are
[54:10] dead. In other words, it was a natural
[54:14] it was a natural miracle that part they
[54:16] partook of. But they still died from it.
[54:20] They still died. But he that eateth of
[54:23] this bread, he shall live forever
[54:25] because God DNA, he can't die.
[54:29] He can't die.
[54:32] That's why he's the same yesterday,
[54:33] today, and forever.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; And that's why when we receive the Holy
[54:37] Ghost, we'll do the works of Christ.
[54:39] We'll we'll we'll have the same. We'll
[54:41] live for others. It'll be just like
[54:44] Christ.
[54:47] Now remember, for the life of the flesh
[54:49] is in the blood.
[54:51] The blood transfers the oxygen and the
[54:54] nutrients. The Holy Ghost is what gives
[54:57] life to the word of God inside of us.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; The last thing we'd want to Oh my my.
[55:04] The letter killth,
[55:07] but it's the spirit that gives life.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "My words are spirit. The
[55:12] words that I speak, they are spirit and
[55:14] they are life."
[55:16] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is what brings life to
[55:19] the word.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; So that's why our dependency is that the
[55:23] Holy Ghost would come and anoint our
[55:25] minds and anoint our hearts and anoint
[55:28] our vessels to receive the word that's
[55:30] being preached from the pulpit. What
[55:32] good does it do to sit here, hear the
[55:34] word of God, and our lives not be
[55:36] changed?
[55:38] &gt;&gt; We've got to have God personally speak
[55:40] to us. It ain't good enough to have God
[55:42] behind this pulpit. You got to have God
[55:44] in that seat right with you just as
[55:46] much.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; When we care enough to hear God speak to
[55:54] us personally, it will bring the life of
[55:57] the word inside of us.
[56:00] It would change us from glory onto
[56:02] glory. It would change our spiritual DNA
[56:05] from being selfish
[56:07] to selfless.
[56:11] From living for ourselves when we go out
[56:13] of here to actually think about
[56:14] somebody.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:21] 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 15-18.
[56:27] This is what happens when we receive
[56:31] the living word of God. He
[56:34] and that he died for all
[56:38] that they which live should not
[56:41] henceforth live unto themselves,
[56:45] but unto him which died for them and
[56:48] rose again. So this is just just take
[56:49] this one verse. Think about this. In the
[56:52] course of your day yesterday,
[56:55] how much time did you spend
[56:58] living for Jesus?
[57:03] I'm just This is just the word. This
[57:05] isn't John Martin's idea. This is just
[57:08] what the word says. Wherefore henceforth
[57:12] know we know man after the flesh. A
[57:14] though we have known Christ after the
[57:16] flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no
[57:18] more. Therefore, if we know Christ in
[57:22] the spirit,
[57:24] if we if if any man be in Christ,
[57:27] right, you eat the word, you drink the
[57:30] blood,
[57:32] he is a new creature. It's a new DNA.
[57:35] Old things are passed away and behold,
[57:38] all things become new.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; And all things are of God.
[57:43] A new creature means new DNA.
[57:47] Brother Ram said like this, if the
[57:49] spirit of Beethoven was in you, you
[57:51] would learn, you would play music just
[57:53] like Beethoven.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; And if the spirit of Christ is in you,
[57:58] you'll have the same DNA. You'll do the
[58:00] same works. You'll love others the way
[58:02] he did.
[58:07] Romans 8:11 says, "But if
[58:10] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[58:14] from the dead dwell in you, he that
[58:17] raised Christ from the dead shall also
[58:21] quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit
[58:23] that dwells in you." See, we have to
[58:26] receive the spirit inside of us.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Now, that ain't going to happen unless
[58:31] we hunger. God, fill me with the Holy
[58:34] Ghost. God, I need the Holy Ghost.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Now, the devil wants you to think that
[58:41] you have enough
[58:45] because if he can convince you that you
[58:47] have enough, there's no need to
[58:49] entertain a thought about coming to the
[58:51] altar.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; There's no need to get serious at home
[58:56] and seek more of the Holy Ghost.
[59:00] But all I got to do is look at my life
[59:04] and realize that I need more to be
[59:06] quickened inside of me. Which means I
[59:09] need more Holy Ghost. I need more of the
[59:12] DNA. You know, you got a lot of you got
[59:15] a lot of different genes. I mean, you've
[59:18] got you got
[59:21] at at least 19,000 genes.
[59:25] I mean there's a lot of stuff happening
[59:27] in our bodies.
[59:29] Man shall not live by bread alone, but
[59:31] by every word that proceedth out of the
[59:33] mouth of God.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; As you receive the word,
[59:37] you become the word.
[59:41] Now if you just receive the knowledge of
[59:43] the word, what happens? The Bible says
[59:45] you get puffed up, right? Knowledge
[59:47] puffth up. But when you receive the
[59:50] spirit of the word, that's charity.
[59:53] That's what edifies those that are
[59:55] around you.
[59:57] Quicken means to be made alive. New DNA
[1:00:00] from God's Holy Spirit. 2 Corinthians
[1:00:03] 3:17. Now the Lord is that spirit. And
[1:00:06] where the spirit of the Lord is, there
[1:00:09] is liberty.
[1:00:12] How many want God to have liberty in
[1:00:14] your life?
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; That means you got to give up your will.
[1:00:19] You got to say you got to spend more
[1:00:21] time with him. Amen.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Spend time with him in prayer. And
[1:00:27] but we all with an open face beholding
[1:00:30] as in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[1:00:34] changed into the same image of God from
[1:00:39] glory unto glory even by what? The
[1:00:42] spirit of the Lord. This is why if we
[1:00:45] come to church and we're not all here,
[1:00:47] you know what I mean? No, no, I don't
[1:00:49] want to get down on anybody that's
[1:00:50] tired, but I'm just I'm just going to be
[1:00:53] honest with you. If you don't enter into
[1:00:55] the spirit of the word, how are you
[1:00:57] going to be changed
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; there? There needs to be a in order for
[1:01:02] this to happen, there needs to be
[1:01:04] something that happened yesterday to
[1:01:06] prepare for today.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; I want to be changed. If we're not
[1:01:12] changed, all we're going to do is
[1:01:14] satisfy our carnal conscience and feel
[1:01:16] like, well, I came to church. I did my
[1:01:17] job.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; But we'll never become like him. We'll
[1:01:21] never be changed. We'll never get the
[1:01:23] same DNA. The DNA comes from the Holy
[1:01:26] Ghost. It doesn't come from currently
[1:01:28] understanding the Bible.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Now, God is changing his bride into the
[1:01:33] same image of himself.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; She is receiving the same DNA
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; because it's passed on from generation
[1:01:42] to generation.
[1:01:45] It's not by power. It's not by my but
[1:01:47] it's by my spirit sayaeth the Lord. God
[1:01:51] is changing your spiritual DNA as you
[1:01:54] receive the word. Now what I mean by
[1:01:56] that receiving the word is that this
[1:01:59] word becomes so much more important to
[1:02:01] you.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Because anybody can say amen to the
[1:02:05] word.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; But the amen that we're looking for is
[1:02:09] what the amen really means. What does
[1:02:11] amen really mean? So be it.
[1:02:15] Be it Mary said, "Be it unto me
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; according to thy word." That's what we
[1:02:20] got to say. How many Marys are there
[1:02:22] here?
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Right? Because everybody wasn't chosen.
[1:02:29] Many are called.
[1:02:31] You are chosen.
[1:02:35] The blood of God speaks today.
[1:02:39] The blood of God speaks today. When Abel
[1:02:42] was killed by his brother, the Bible
[1:02:45] says that Abel's blood cried out to God.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; And Hebrews 12:24 says that the blood of
[1:02:53] Christ speaketh better things than the
[1:02:56] blood of Abel.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "For this is my blood of
[1:03:00] the new testament, and it's speaking
[1:03:03] better things." Amen. Brother said in
[1:03:06] the message, the token, he said, "The
[1:03:08] blood is speaking.
[1:03:10] The blood has got a voice
[1:03:13] and the voice of the blood is the word.
[1:03:17] Hallelujah.
[1:03:18] That's what makes it whether it's right
[1:03:21] or wrong. The word is identified by the
[1:03:24] voice of the blood.
[1:03:26] The voice of the blood is the Holy
[1:03:29] Ghost.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; And that is what brings life. He says
[1:03:34] and it brings life to the word and it
[1:03:36] quickens it.
[1:03:38] That's why we we should be more
[1:03:40] desperate about getting into the
[1:03:42] presence of God
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; more than anything when we come to
[1:03:45] church.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Not just being here on time,
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; but getting into the presence of God so
[1:03:51] that when the word is being preached,
[1:03:54] something happens on the inside of you.
[1:03:57] Something quickens.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; I mean, we've all been drunk before,
[1:04:02] haven't we?
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; All been high or drunk at one time in
[1:04:06] life.
[1:04:07] never. Well, God bless you. That never
[1:04:10] happened to you.
[1:04:12] But when it happens, let me just say
[1:04:14] this. You're dizzy.
[1:04:17] You're not all there.
[1:04:21] You're in another realm.
[1:04:26] And when the Holy Ghost touches you,
[1:04:30] well, you've ever felt the anointing of
[1:04:31] God come down upon you,
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; you're in another realm. something
[1:04:37] happens. Everything is shut out. You're
[1:04:39] shut in with God in a secret place,
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; beholding
[1:04:46] his glory.
[1:04:48] So when we sit here and we hear the word
[1:04:50] of God speaking, we must believe it is
[1:04:52] God that is speaking to us personally.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; And what's he speaking about?
[1:04:59] About your nature change.
[1:05:02] Now, we all want God to fix our homes,
[1:05:04] and to fix our everything else,
[1:05:09] fix our bank account,
[1:05:11] fix our goals, fix our plans, fix, fix,
[1:05:15] fix, fix, fix.
[1:05:18] But God's here primarily for one reason.
[1:05:20] Now, he's a good God. He'll heal, you
[1:05:22] know, do whatever because he's good.
[1:05:25] He's so good, he does it to his enemies.
[1:05:28] But I'm telling you, God's purpose is to
[1:05:31] get us ready to get to the other side.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; That can't happen unless our nature gets
[1:05:36] changed.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; So God is speaking to us about changing
[1:05:40] our nature.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; So if we get in tune with that, we'll
[1:05:44] probably hear more his voice.
[1:05:48] So remember that God is wanting to
[1:05:50] change our nature into what? His nature.
[1:05:53] He wants to get the DNA inside of us.
[1:05:56] Now that happens as we believe the word
[1:05:58] from our heart like I want that Lord. I
[1:06:01] want that for my I choose that for my
[1:06:03] life.
[1:06:04] He's wanting to change your spiritual
[1:06:07] DNA. He's wanting to give you his DNA.
[1:06:10] He wants to give you like a blood
[1:06:11] transfusion,
[1:06:13] the building blocks or the blueprint to
[1:06:15] become just like Jesus.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; I can see why Jesus said, "The truth
[1:06:22] shall set you free."
[1:06:25] The truth is what sets us free. 1 John
[1:06:28] chapter 3 verse 1.
[1:06:31] First John chapter 3 verse one says,
[1:06:33] "Behold what manner of love the father
[1:06:38] has bestowed upon you and I that we
[1:06:41] should be that we should have the same
[1:06:44] DNA as God." Right? It's passed on to
[1:06:48] the sons of God. Therefore, the world
[1:06:52] doesn't know us because it didn't know
[1:06:54] him.
[1:06:56] Behold, now are we the sons of God. The
[1:07:00] DNA is inside of us, and it does not yet
[1:07:03] appear what we shall be. But because we
[1:07:06] know we got the same DNA, we shall be
[1:07:09] like him, for we shall see him like he
[1:07:11] is.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; And every man that has this hope, what
[1:07:15] is he doing? He's coming to church. He's
[1:07:18] hearing the word and he's purifying
[1:07:20] himself even as he is pure.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; So when we hear God's blood speaking,
[1:07:27] which is the word of God, we must
[1:07:29] believe it is God speaking to us
[1:07:31] personally about a nature change. That's
[1:07:35] why you when you leave church, you want
[1:07:37] to be able to say, "God spoke to me.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; God spoke.
[1:07:42] I heard God speak to me person. I do
[1:07:45] like I I don't know what God is saying
[1:07:48] to sister Linda or brother James or
[1:07:50] brother Orlando. I don't know. I don't
[1:07:52] know. That's God's business.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; But I do know what he spoke to me.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; That's what's important.
[1:08:01] It's coming in contact with God
[1:08:05] because if he doesn't speak to you,
[1:08:07] you're alone.
[1:08:09] Oh, what a thought. If God doesn't speak
[1:08:12] to you, you're alone.
[1:08:15] I'd rather have God rebuke me. At least
[1:08:17] he's speaking to me.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; At least I know there's that
[1:08:21] relationship there.
[1:08:26] And because you believe your spiritual
[1:08:28] gene contains the very instructions
[1:08:32] of what to do with the word when you
[1:08:33] hear it, you obey the word of God and
[1:08:37] then you become the living manifestation
[1:08:40] of the word of God. Amen.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; You put your foot Everything if you look
[1:08:44] in the Old Testament everything's put
[1:08:46] your foot forward,
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; right? Put your foot in the water
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; and it'll it'll it'll move. Go just take
[1:08:53] that step towards Goliath. Just walk in
[1:08:56] faith believing God will meet you there.
[1:08:59] Draw nigh to God. He'll draw nigh to
[1:09:01] you. So when you you hear the word of
[1:09:03] God and and the word of God tells you
[1:09:05] to, you know, to be more faithful, you
[1:09:07] just by faith say, "I'm going to be more
[1:09:09] faithful." and you will become more
[1:09:11] faithful. But you got to believe it. And
[1:09:13] the gene of God believes the word of
[1:09:15] God.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; The gene of God believes the word of
[1:09:19] God.
[1:09:22] That's why that little chicken in the
[1:09:24] bar in that barn, he couldn't
[1:09:28] he couldn't just he couldn't stay in
[1:09:30] that condition.
[1:09:32] He couldn't just peck around the rest of
[1:09:34] his life
[1:09:37] acting like these low-life chickens.
[1:09:40] [Laughter]
[1:09:42] God had put something in him. It's about
[1:09:45] to fly.
[1:09:48] And there's We're eagles.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; We are eagles.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; That means we're supposed to fly above
[1:09:55] the things of this world. It's not going
[1:09:57] to keep us down. Our DNA is it flies. Is
[1:10:00] it is it is it like the chickens that
[1:10:01] stay in the ground?
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Got a different DNA.
[1:10:07] You start to look more like Christ the
[1:10:09] word and you act more like Christ the
[1:10:12] word. Your priorities begin to change.
[1:10:17] Your spiritual habits begin to change.
[1:10:20] Church is no longer church, but you
[1:10:23] actually hunger to hear the voice of God
[1:10:25] speaking to you. When you come to
[1:10:26] church,
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; you begin to turn the cheek. go the
[1:10:30] second mile and start living for others.
[1:10:33] In other words, you begin looking more
[1:10:35] like Jesus Christ himself.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; How many times, and we've all had this
[1:10:40] experience, how many times have you um
[1:10:46] you were introduced to somebody
[1:10:49] and they said, "Um, oh, are you are you
[1:10:53] a Christian?
[1:11:00] [Applause]
[1:11:02] But you look at some people's life, they
[1:11:04] say they're a Christian, and you what?
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Because they're not looking like a
[1:11:11] Christian.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; But
[1:11:17] there's no doubt
[1:11:19] at one time James was a a little baby
[1:11:23] boy
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; and he looked so cute.
[1:11:31] What? What? He He's cuter. That's what
[1:11:34] happened.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; But he grew up to manifest the genes
[1:11:42] that is inside of him.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; That's naturally.
[1:11:48] Now, spiritually, every one of our genes
[1:11:51] that we were born with were from the pit
[1:11:54] of hell.
[1:11:55] We're all liars. Didn't care about
[1:11:58] anything except oursel. M Mr. and Mrs.
[1:12:01] Proud being introduced to Mr. and Mrs.
[1:12:05] Prrowder.
[1:12:07] Keep up with the Joneses.
[1:12:10] But now we receive the gene of God.
[1:12:14] And now we begin to look more like
[1:12:16] Jesus.
[1:12:18] We become sweeter,
[1:12:21] more full of the love of God.
[1:12:24] We're no longer manipulating others to
[1:12:26] love us,
[1:12:27] to do things for us.
[1:12:30] We actually laid down our lives for
[1:12:31] others. We show them with our life how
[1:12:35] to live the life of Christ. You know, we
[1:12:38] sometimes we got too much religion.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Too much religion where we use the word
[1:12:46] to manipulate other people in the
[1:12:47] church.
[1:12:50] That is not what Christ did.
[1:12:54] So when we hear God's blood speaking to
[1:12:57] us, which is the word, we mix it with
[1:13:00] faith. Just you hear the word of God,
[1:13:02] don't say, "Wow, that's how am I going
[1:13:05] to be able to how do I receive that? I
[1:13:07] need something supernatural happening."
[1:13:08] No, you don't. Brother Brand said in the
[1:13:11] message the Tolken, and by the way, that
[1:13:14] hissup was just common weeds.
[1:13:18] Hissup means your faith.
[1:13:20] Somebody tries to have supernatural
[1:13:22] faith. That's the reason you miss your
[1:13:24] healing.
[1:13:32] Faith is just a is just a common thing.
[1:13:37] You got faith to come to church. You got
[1:13:40] faith to walk out there. You got faith
[1:13:42] to start your car. You got faith to eat
[1:13:45] your dinner.
[1:13:47] That's the way it is. It's common faith.
[1:13:49] Now you apply the blood
[1:13:52] with was I'm sorry and you and to apply
[1:13:55] the blood was applied with hissup which
[1:13:59] is just common weeds that grow
[1:14:00] everywhere in Palestine
[1:14:02] showing that faith that the faith that
[1:14:06] the blood is to be applied is not some
[1:14:09] super thing that you have all kinds of
[1:14:12] doctors of degrees to do it. It's just
[1:14:16] common everyday faith to believe in God,
[1:14:19] apply the blood by faith with the
[1:14:22] hissup. So I'll just say this.
[1:14:25] Even though you may seem simple and you
[1:14:28] know you're not much of feel like you're
[1:14:30] much of anything in church, you come
[1:14:32] into church with a different attitude.
[1:14:34] You come into church just believing that
[1:14:36] you're here for God.
[1:14:39] Just you and God. Just over in the
[1:14:42] corner. Nobody sees you. Nobody knows
[1:14:44] what's happening, but it's you and God.
[1:14:46] And I'm telling you, you believe the
[1:14:48] word as if God's speaking to you, and
[1:14:49] something is going to happen in your
[1:14:51] life, cuz God cannot lie.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4:2 says, "For unto us was the
[1:14:57] gospel preached as well as unto them.
[1:14:59] But the word preached did not profit
[1:15:02] them, not being mixed with faith in them
[1:15:07] that heard." So we can come to church,
[1:15:09] hear the word, and not take faith to
[1:15:11] believe this is for my life.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; I mean, do you ever hear hear this voice
[1:15:16] that says, "Oh, that that was for so and
[1:15:18] so."
[1:15:20] We all heard that voice. Oh, I wish so
[1:15:22] and so was here for that.
[1:15:25] Um, I understand that the word is
[1:15:27] probably for others, too. But we just
[1:15:31] need to have the attitude that I need
[1:15:34] the word for me, you know, to rake rake
[1:15:36] it in.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Romans 10 verse1 15 says, "At is
[1:15:41] written, how beautiful
[1:15:43] are the feet
[1:15:46] of them that preach the gospel of peace
[1:15:48] and bring glad tidings of good things."
[1:15:51] I want you to catch this. God has given
[1:15:53] us a five-fold ministry to bring us the
[1:15:57] voice of the blood.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:00] And how beautiful it is when they come
[1:16:04] and they give us the voice of God's
[1:16:07] blood.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; But they have not all obeyed the gospel.
[1:16:12] For Isaiah saith, Isaiah saith, Lord,
[1:16:15] who has believed our report? So then
[1:16:19] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[1:16:22] the word of God. Now this is why I just
[1:16:24] want to get this to say this. This is
[1:16:26] not brother John up here speaking.
[1:16:30] As sure as anything
[1:16:32] you one day you'll know that to be the
[1:16:36] truth.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; It is God that's trying to get to his
[1:16:42] people.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; But you have to believe the report.
[1:16:50] So Hebrews chapter 12 says I'm going to
[1:16:54] start verse 23. We're going to have to
[1:16:56] hurry cuz I still got quite a bit here.
[1:16:58] To the general assembly and the church
[1:17:00] of the firstborn. Now, this doesn't mean
[1:17:02] of those that were, you know, with the
[1:17:04] first birth. This really means of those
[1:17:08] that were uh born of of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:13] He's the firstborn among many brethren.
[1:17:15] Amen. So the general assembly and the
[1:17:17] church of the firstborn which are
[1:17:18] written in heaven and to the judge of to
[1:17:20] the god uh to the god and to God the
[1:17:25] judge of all and to the spirits of just
[1:17:27] men made perfect. If I slow down I'll
[1:17:29] get done faster. And to Jesus the
[1:17:31] mediator of the new covenant and to the
[1:17:35] blood of sprinkling that speaketh better
[1:17:37] things than that of Abel. See that you
[1:17:40] refuse not him that speaketh. So now
[1:17:42] God's speaking to us. For if they escape
[1:17:45] not, who refused him that speaketh on
[1:17:48] earth, much more shall not we escape, if
[1:17:52] we turn away from him that speaketh from
[1:17:56] heaven.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; God is speaking from heaven. This
[1:18:01] morning,
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; whose voice then shook the earth, but
[1:18:05] now he had promised, saying, yet once
[1:18:07] more I shake not the uh earth only, but
[1:18:10] also heaven. And this word yet once more
[1:18:12] signifying the removing of those things
[1:18:14] that are shaken as of the things that
[1:18:18] are made. In other words, anything
[1:18:20] that's man-made
[1:18:22] that those things which cannot be shaken
[1:18:24] may remain. And that is the revelation
[1:18:26] of Jesus Christ. That and we've got to
[1:18:28] receive the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:18:31] It cannot be shaken. Heaven and earth
[1:18:33] are going to pass away, but the word of
[1:18:34] God is not going to pass away.
[1:18:37] Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[1:18:40] cannot be rem cannot be moved, let us
[1:18:42] have grace whereby we may serve God
[1:18:44] acceptably with reverence and godly for
[1:18:47] for our God is a consuming fire. Now
[1:18:50] turn with me if you would to Matthew
[1:18:51] chapter 16. I want to get in to this
[1:18:54] because it it we're the kingdom of God
[1:18:58] is God revealing himself to you. It's
[1:19:01] who God is. Now here in Matthew chapter
[1:19:04] 16, Jesus is showing an interest in what
[1:19:08] people think about him.
[1:19:11] You know, people could talk for hours.
[1:19:14] What do you think about God?
[1:19:18] But
[1:19:20] and it's okay to know about God as long
[1:19:22] as you don't submit to God,
[1:19:24] right?
[1:19:27] But
[1:19:29] people who have that that attitude are
[1:19:32] going to miss who God is because he
[1:19:34] actually hid it from the wise and
[1:19:35] prudent. Right? So here it is. Matthew
[1:19:38] 16:13. When Jesus came into the coast of
[1:19:41] Cesaria Philippi, he asked his disciples
[1:19:43] saying, "Who do men say that I am?"
[1:19:50] And he gives them a little the son of
[1:19:52] man.
[1:19:54] But who do people say that I am? And
[1:19:57] some say that John the Baptist, Elias,
[1:19:58] and others, Jeremiah from one of the
[1:20:00] prophets. So, we got a lot of different
[1:20:02] denominations out there, a lot of
[1:20:04] different churches, independent
[1:20:05] churches, a lot of different people. We
[1:20:06] got people who stay home. They won't go
[1:20:08] to church. They don't feel they need to.
[1:20:10] They can know God on their own.
[1:20:13] Got a lot of different views out there.
[1:20:18] And Jesus has an interest of what people
[1:20:20] think about him, but he's more
[1:20:21] interested in what you think about him.
[1:20:24] personally.
[1:20:26] And he saith unto them, but whom say you
[1:20:30] that I am.
[1:20:32] And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou
[1:20:34] art the Christ, the Son of the living
[1:20:37] God."
[1:20:38] And what was beautiful about this, I I
[1:20:41] would imagine that all anybody could and
[1:20:42] their brother could have quoted that,
[1:20:45] but what was different about being able
[1:20:48] to quote that or know that is how Jesus
[1:20:54] spoke here and he said, "Blessed art
[1:20:55] thou, Simon Bjonah, for flesh and blood
[1:20:58] did not tell you this, but my father
[1:21:02] which is in heaven."
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Now, if the father could speak to Peter,
[1:21:10] the father who is in heaven, speak to
[1:21:12] Peter on earth, the father, the holy
[1:21:14] ghost can speak to us here in church.
[1:21:23] And blessed are they that hunger and
[1:21:25] thirst after it because I believe those
[1:21:28] are the ones that are going to hear the
[1:21:30] voice of God.
[1:21:34] You know, think about this. The people
[1:21:36] who who refuse to sit in a church,
[1:21:40] people who refuse to open their Bible,
[1:21:43] the only gospel they may have ever heard
[1:21:46] is is the life that was lived in front
[1:21:48] of them, they are still going to be
[1:21:50] judged and go to hell.
[1:21:53] Think about that.
[1:21:56] Because they heard the voice of God
[1:21:58] speak to them, everybody's going to get
[1:22:00] a chance.
[1:22:02] So just because they stay out of church
[1:22:04] or stay out of the reading the word or
[1:22:05] stay out of the message, it doesn't mean
[1:22:07] they're exempt from the punishment of
[1:22:09] it.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; I mean, this is a serious thing. We've
[1:22:13] all been created by God Almighty.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; We We are his subjects. We are his
[1:22:20] creation.
[1:22:22] And he is due our respect.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:29] And Simon Peter answered, "Thou the
[1:22:30] Christ, the living God, for flesh and
[1:22:33] blood have not revealed this." Jesus
[1:22:34] said, "But my father which is in heaven,
[1:22:36] and thou art Peter, and upon this rock,
[1:22:39] I will build my church, and the gates of
[1:22:42] hell shall not prevail against it."
[1:22:45] Unless God builds the house, they that
[1:22:49] labor labor in vain. Amen.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; So, we go home and we read the books. We
[1:22:54] read the Bible, but we don't hunger for
[1:22:56] God to speak it to us.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Our labor is in vain.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; How many people do we know know the
[1:23:05] Bible, quote the Bible all the time, but
[1:23:06] they don't live it?
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; You talk about dangerous.
[1:23:11] I mean, that is the devil in flesh.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; That is the devil in flesh. He knows the
[1:23:18] word, but he doesn't live it.
[1:23:22] That's why the it be that's why the
[1:23:24] Bible says it been better for them not
[1:23:25] to known the way of the Lord than to
[1:23:27] know and turn it down.
[1:23:30] So Peter goes to church and he's not
[1:23:32] listening
[1:23:34] uh to the man Jesus
[1:23:36] as far as the natural flesh and blood,
[1:23:40] but he's listening to the voice of the
[1:23:42] blood
[1:23:44] in which is unveiling who Christ is
[1:23:47] personally to him.
[1:23:49] So already didn't matter what other
[1:23:51] people thought he's Jeremiah, Laz, or
[1:23:53] one of the prophets. It doesn't matter.
[1:23:54] It's like why do why do you even want to
[1:23:56] talk about it? What's really important
[1:23:58] is what God has spoken to you
[1:24:00] personally. I mean, if you literally go
[1:24:02] home and you write down on a piece of
[1:24:04] paper, who is God to you?
[1:24:08] I think it's a good thing to do. Who is
[1:24:10] God to you?
[1:24:13] It becomes important then going to
[1:24:15] church. It go it's important praying.
[1:24:17] It's important uh living for others.
[1:24:19] When you know who Jesus is, the word of
[1:24:22] God becomes important. So, it's no
[1:24:25] different for us when we hear the word
[1:24:26] of God being preached. Are we hearing
[1:24:29] personally from God or are we hearing
[1:24:31] the voice of the blood of Calvary
[1:24:35] speaking?
[1:24:37] It can't be just man's words. It can't
[1:24:40] be just uh the preaching of the word. It
[1:24:43] has to be God to you personally. So, as
[1:24:46] God is revealing himself to you, he's
[1:24:49] also revealing who you are.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Why? because you're the same gene as
[1:24:55] God.
[1:24:57] That's why to know who God is clearly,
[1:25:00] that God is someone that demands
[1:25:02] respect.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Then your life becomes lined up with the
[1:25:09] word.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; You're Miss Jesus. You're Mrs. Jesus.
[1:25:13] I'm sorry.
[1:25:15] You You are of his same DNA. You have
[1:25:19] the same spiritual genes. For it is God
[1:25:22] which workketh in you both to will and
[1:25:24] to do of his good pleasure.
[1:25:27] You are being changed as you receive the
[1:25:29] word of life. You're a doer of the word
[1:25:32] and not just a hearer. You know, you can
[1:25:34] get in a habit of coming to church and
[1:25:36] just hearing and leaving away. Not
[1:25:39] changed.
[1:25:41] I mean changed to be more like Jesus.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; We literally are changed to become more
[1:25:47] like the enemy.
[1:25:50] Right? Because brother Bam says, "You
[1:25:52] never leave church the same way you came
[1:25:54] in.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; You're either closer to God or further
[1:25:57] away. We just don't always know it." God
[1:26:00] reveals to the church not only who
[1:26:02] Christ is, but he's revealing who his
[1:26:05] bride is. That's why there's such a
[1:26:07] hunger to know
[1:26:10] the voice of God being spoken to us
[1:26:12] personally. Because think about it, what
[1:26:14] if you're the only person in the church
[1:26:15] that's going to make the rapture?
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Think about that.
[1:26:21] this word becomes important to you.
[1:26:25] The voice of God being spoken to it,
[1:26:27] it's it's it's important to you.
[1:26:30] That last verse, verse 19, and I will
[1:26:32] give unto thee the keys of the kingdom.
[1:26:35] He's telling Peter,
[1:26:37] the keys of heaven. And uh and
[1:26:40] whatsoever you bind on earth shall be
[1:26:42] bound in heaven. Whatsoever you shall
[1:26:43] loose on earth shall be loosed in
[1:26:45] heaven. God has given us the keys to the
[1:26:47] kingdom of heaven. Did you know that? He
[1:26:50] has given you the word of God.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; He has given you the word of God to
[1:26:54] speak over your life.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Whatever you say, it's going to happen.
[1:26:59] Whatever you bind, it's going to be
[1:27:00] bound. Whatever you lose, it's going to
[1:27:02] be You want some habit loosed out of
[1:27:04] your life, then speak it. God has given
[1:27:06] you the keys. Yeah.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; When the ears of your heart hear the
[1:27:15] voice of God's blood speaking to you
[1:27:17] personally, this is the way walking in
[1:27:19] it. This is God unveiling your new
[1:27:24] spiritual DNA.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; It's exciting.
[1:27:29] It's exciting that I can become like
[1:27:32] Jesus.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; It's time to walk in it.
[1:27:37] When you turn from the right, you turn
[1:27:39] to the left, you're going to hear a
[1:27:40] voice.
[1:27:42] That's God leading you. Stay with the
[1:27:44] word.
[1:27:46] Stay with the word. Don't make it just,
[1:27:49] you know, your church services. Stay
[1:27:52] with the word. That's why John could
[1:27:54] say, "I have no greater joy than to hear
[1:27:58] that my children are walking in truth."
[1:28:01] Oh, to be like Jesus.
[1:28:04] I don't have time to read all this, but
[1:28:06] I'm going to do my best. Romans chapter
[1:28:09] 8. This is the DNA of God. Romans
[1:28:13] chapter 8, verse 29. Brother Mark had uh
[1:28:16] read some of these scriptures, but I
[1:28:17] want to read it a little bit in the
[1:28:19] light of our new DNA.
[1:28:24] And if I could just get one amen, I'll
[1:28:26] continue. If not, then I'm gonna take my
[1:28:28] time and you're gonna stay here longer
[1:28:29] than you really want to. No.
[1:28:33] Romans 8 28 8:29 starting for whom he
[1:28:38] did forno he also did predestinate to be
[1:28:41] conformed into the same image or the
[1:28:44] same DNA of his son that he might be the
[1:28:48] firstborn among many brethren. There it
[1:28:50] is generation after generation after
[1:28:52] generation after generation being passed
[1:28:55] on. Moreover, whom he did predestined,
[1:28:58] he also called them he justified. whom
[1:29:00] we justified, he glorified. What shall
[1:29:03] we say to these things? If God be for
[1:29:05] us, who can be against us? He that
[1:29:08] spared not his own son, but delivered
[1:29:10] him up for us all. How shall uh he not
[1:29:12] with him also freely give us all things?
[1:29:15] There it is. He has given us all things
[1:29:19] that pertain to to life and godliness.
[1:29:22] Peter says, "Who shall lay anything to
[1:29:25] the charge of God's elect?" It is God
[1:29:28] that justifies us.
[1:29:32] Who is he that condemnth? Who is he that
[1:29:35] condemnth? It is Christ that died rather
[1:29:37] is risen again. Who is even at the right
[1:29:39] hand of God who maketh intercession for
[1:29:41] us. So Christ has taken care of every
[1:29:44] possible problem that we could have in
[1:29:45] our life.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Every single problem he has taken care
[1:29:49] of. But what we have to do is enter into
[1:29:52] a faith to believe that
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; and to start confessing it and start
[1:29:57] walking it. You know what the problem
[1:29:59] is, James? You know what the problem is
[1:30:01] with a lot of people? They hear the word
[1:30:03] of God
[1:30:05] and they agree with the word of God, but
[1:30:09] they don't keep it in their memory.
[1:30:11] They forget about it
[1:30:14] and then they they don't get stronger.
[1:30:18] And the Bible says, uh, let's pull this
[1:30:21] up. 1 Corinthians 15 real quick. 1
[1:30:23] Corinthians 15, verse 1. Let's put that
[1:30:26] and see what that says. It's important
[1:30:29] that you remember the word of God.
[1:30:33] Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you
[1:30:35] the gospel which I preached unto you,
[1:30:36] which also you are saved, and wherein ye
[1:30:39] stand. Verse two,
[1:30:44] by which also you are saved, if you keep
[1:30:46] in memory what I preached unto you,
[1:30:48] unless you have believed in vain. So God
[1:30:51] gives us the word. We're more than
[1:30:55] overcomers.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; So when the devil comes and he gives
[1:30:58] this thought, I can't do this, I can't
[1:31:00] live this, I can't overcome, I can't
[1:31:02] stop lying, I can't, you just put that
[1:31:05] aside. I am God's DNA. I'm a part of God
[1:31:10] and I'm keeping it in my memory.
[1:31:14] All right. Verse 35 of Romans chapter 8.
[1:31:18] Verse 35. Now remember, we're talking
[1:31:21] about God's DNA, the firstborn among
[1:31:23] many brethren. Who shall separate us
[1:31:26] from the love of Christ? Why is this so
[1:31:29] important? Because God is love.
[1:31:33] God is love. So the DNA of God is love.
[1:31:38] Who shall separate us from the love of
[1:31:40] Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or
[1:31:42] persecution or famine or nakedness,
[1:31:44] peril, or sword? All as it is written,
[1:31:47] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[1:31:49] long. We are counted as sheep uh for the
[1:31:51] slaughter. We we we we just, you know,
[1:31:53] trials are going to be in our life.
[1:31:55] There's nothing we can do about it.
[1:31:57] But in all these things, we're more than
[1:31:59] conquerors through Christ that loved us.
[1:32:04] Now look at the confession here. For I
[1:32:06] am persuaded that neither death, life,
[1:32:09] angels, principalities, powers, nor
[1:32:11] things present, nor things to come, nor
[1:32:13] height, nor depth, nor any other
[1:32:14] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:32:16] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:32:18] Jesus our Lord. Now, why is that?
[1:32:21] Because you have the same love of God
[1:32:25] inside of your genes, your spiritual
[1:32:27] genes. How can you be separated from the
[1:32:29] love of God when it's inside of you?
[1:32:34] That's why the prophet could say nothing
[1:32:36] will enter in there except perfect love.
[1:32:40] Those are sons and daughters of God in
[1:32:43] heaven.
[1:32:44] They got the same DNA. They got a new
[1:32:47] birth. They weren't a bunch of um uh uh
[1:32:52] mate believers that went to church that
[1:32:54] said they're born again and they didn't
[1:32:56] take time to check their nature to see
[1:32:58] if it was changing to be more like
[1:33:00] Jesus.
[1:33:03] I'm not trying to be strong and hard
[1:33:05] here, but you know, there's a devil out
[1:33:07] there that wants to trick a lot of
[1:33:08] people.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; And I'm really mad at him. I'm not mad
[1:33:12] at any any human. No, no, you're my
[1:33:17] friends.
[1:33:19] Amen. First, okay, one last set of
[1:33:21] scriptures if I could. It's going to be
[1:33:22] first John chapter 4
[1:33:25] speaking on this love
[1:33:29] of God. God is love. The gene of God.
[1:33:33] That would be a good message right
[1:33:34] there. The gene of God's love. Amen.
[1:33:39] First John chapter 4:7. Beloved, let us
[1:33:42] love one another.
[1:33:44] For love is of God. And everyone that is
[1:33:47] born of God.
[1:33:50] Uh and everyone that loveth, he's
[1:33:53] actually born of God.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; And he knows God. So if in your heart
[1:33:57] you're feeling this I love I love
[1:34:00] everybody.
[1:34:02] I just want to lay down my life. I want
[1:34:05] to get Christ to I want to be willing to
[1:34:08] suffer to help somebody.
[1:34:11] This is the manifestation that you
[1:34:14] actually know God
[1:34:16] because God is love and he that loveth
[1:34:19] he knows God. That's what the scripture
[1:34:21] is telling us here.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Why? because it's the same DNA that God
[1:34:26] has. It's inside of you. That's why
[1:34:28] Jesus could say, "Make sure that you
[1:34:30] love one another as I have loved you."
[1:34:32] In other words, I've loved you
[1:34:33] unconditionally.
[1:34:36] It doesn't mean you have to hang out
[1:34:39] be and partake of their nonsense,
[1:34:44] but it does mean that you're willing to
[1:34:48] turn the cheek, go the second mile.
[1:34:52] You you you'll take the word of God and
[1:34:54] you'll live the word of God.
[1:34:57] Oh, I just love the word. Verse eight,
[1:35:00] he that loveth not,
[1:35:03] he doesn't know God.
[1:35:06] Think about that. He that loveth not
[1:35:09] knoweth not God, for God is love.
[1:35:15] It's not the same DNA if you're not
[1:35:18] loving.
[1:35:20] If you're having a hard time loving,
[1:35:22] I'll say you you need to get to the
[1:35:24] altar. You need to get serious with God.
[1:35:27] You need to call on God. You need to get
[1:35:29] a dose of the Holy Ghost because there's
[1:35:31] nothing else that's going to change you.
[1:35:34] I can't change you. I could live my, you
[1:35:36] know, God could take me and make your
[1:35:38] personal servant the rest of your life
[1:35:40] and that would never change you.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; You got to get God on the inside of you.
[1:35:47] That's right.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; We might have the knowledge of God, but
[1:35:51] it's not the same DNA if we are not
[1:35:55] loving like God loves. Verse nine, in
[1:35:59] this was manifested the love of God
[1:36:02] towards us.
[1:36:04] So God manifested his love towards us
[1:36:06] because that God sent his only begotten
[1:36:08] son into the world that we might live
[1:36:12] through him.
[1:36:14] Calvary made it possible for his DNA to
[1:36:16] come back upon us right through a blood
[1:36:19] transfusion. And that happens as the
[1:36:22] word is being preached to you. You say,
[1:36:24] "Yes, Lord. I'll do it."
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, spiritual DNA comes
[1:36:28] right inside your being. I mean, think
[1:36:31] about it. I there was a time that I
[1:36:33] literally smoked.
[1:36:36] I smoked
[1:36:39] different stuff.
[1:36:43] But I got a blood transfusion.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; And it changed my DNA.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; I don't have any more desire for it
[1:36:52] anymore.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; I used to drink. I haven't drank since
[1:36:55] then. I haven't smoked since then.
[1:37:00] And the same thing can happen. You can
[1:37:02] love everybody. You just got to receive
[1:37:04] the DNA of God.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; We are changed from glory unto glor. You
[1:37:09] know, you you can you can take your time
[1:37:10] and grow.
[1:37:14] You get serious and grow fast.
[1:37:18] I I I'll say we're running out of time
[1:37:20] to get ready.
[1:37:22] God is not stopping for anybody.
[1:37:25] He's moving forward. Verse 10. Here in
[1:37:28] his love, here in is love. Not that we
[1:37:31] loved God. No, but that he loved us and
[1:37:36] he sent his son to be the propitiation
[1:37:38] for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved
[1:37:42] us and we got the same gene as God, then
[1:37:47] we also ought to love one another.
[1:37:52] Have you ever sat around and wondered
[1:37:56] waiting for somebody who claims to be a
[1:37:59] Christian to come and love you?
[1:38:09] We need to love one another as Christ
[1:38:12] has loved us.
[1:38:14] I believe there's I honestly believe
[1:38:16] there's nothing to make God more happier
[1:38:20] because I believe this is walking in the
[1:38:21] truth. Let me just say this. When we can
[1:38:25] love one another the way that God loves
[1:38:27] us.
[1:38:29] I believe this is the truth he wants us
[1:38:30] to walk in.
[1:38:34] Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought to
[1:38:37] also love one another. No man has seen
[1:38:40] God at this time. So it's not knowing
[1:38:42] God after the flesh, right? If we love
[1:38:46] one another, God dwelleth in us and his
[1:38:49] love is perfected in us.
[1:38:55] Oh, that's beautiful. It's not a
[1:38:59] physical relationship.
[1:39:02] It's you receive in the spirit of
[1:39:04] Christ, the spirit of the word into your
[1:39:06] heart and you literally just go and you
[1:39:09] love one another. You want to share
[1:39:11] Christ with others. You want to bring
[1:39:13] others to the truth. You want to you
[1:39:15] want to spend time working with the
[1:39:18] kingdom of God rather than your own
[1:39:20] kingdom.
[1:39:23] And hereby know we that we dwelleth in
[1:39:26] him and he in us because he have given
[1:39:28] us his spirit. And we have seen and do
[1:39:31] testify that the father sent the son to
[1:39:33] be the savior of the world. said,
[1:39:35] "Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is
[1:39:37] the son of God, God dwelleth in him, and
[1:39:39] he it and he in God." Now, think about
[1:39:42] this. You confess with your life, right?
[1:39:44] Not your mouth. Your life has got to
[1:39:47] confess it. You love one another as
[1:39:49] Christ has loved you. And we have known
[1:39:51] and believe that the love that God have
[1:39:53] sent us, God is love. And he that
[1:39:55] dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and
[1:39:57] God in him, and here in is our love,
[1:39:59] it's made perfect that we may have
[1:40:02] boldness in the day of judgment. Because
[1:40:04] as he is, so are we in the world. So
[1:40:08] it does not yet appear. But we know that
[1:40:10] when he shall appear, we shall be like
[1:40:12] him, for we shall see him as he is. So
[1:40:16] we have the gene of God. Even though
[1:40:18] we're having a hard time and we're
[1:40:20] struggling, let's say we're struggling,
[1:40:22] really loving. All you got to do is give
[1:40:25] your heart on the altar.
[1:40:28] Get serious about God. Change my heart,
[1:40:31] oh God. God
[1:40:35] make it ever true.
[1:40:40] That's all we need. God cannot,
[1:40:44] you know, put a a headlock on you on
[1:40:48] your on your will.
[1:40:50] You either going to want to be like him
[1:40:53] more than you want to be like you are.
[1:40:57] And
[1:40:59] and when you just say, "Lord, help me. I
[1:41:01] surrender all. God will bless you. All
[1:41:04] right. Verse 18. Are we in verse 18?
[1:41:08] There is no fear in love, but perfect
[1:41:11] love casteth out fear because fear of
[1:41:13] torment. And he that fearth is not made
[1:41:15] perfect. We love him because he first
[1:41:17] loved us. If any man say, "I love God,
[1:41:20] he hates his brother." What's the DNA
[1:41:23] say? The DNA test says he's a liar. For
[1:41:28] he that loveth not his brother whom may
[1:41:29] have seen, how can he love God who may
[1:41:31] not seen? And this commandment have we
[1:41:33] of him that he who loveth God loveth his
[1:41:37] brother also. Amen. Let's stand
[1:41:39] together. The voice of our spiritual
[1:41:42] DNA.
[1:41:49] I want to be like Jesus.
[1:41:55] to be like Jesus.
[1:42:00] Let's sing. Without him, I could do
[1:42:02] nothing.
[1:42:09] If you love the word, make love to the
[1:42:11] word.
[1:42:14] Without him,
[1:42:17] I could do nothing.
[1:42:22] [Music]
[1:42:23] Without him,
[1:42:25] I'd surely fail.
[1:42:31] Without him, I would be drifting
[1:42:38] like a ship
[1:42:40] without
[1:42:42] a sail.
[1:42:45] [Music]
[1:42:46] Jesus.
[1:42:50] Oh Jesus,
[1:42:53] do you know him today? Please don't turn
[1:42:58] him away.
[1:43:01] Jesus.
[1:43:04] Oh Jesus.
[1:43:08] Without him how lost I would be.
[1:43:14] [Music]
[1:43:16] Without him, I would be dying.
[1:43:24] Without him, I'd be enslaved.
[1:43:32] Without him, life would be hopeless.
[1:43:38] But with Jesus, thank God, I'm saved.
[1:43:46] Jesus.
[1:43:49] Oh Jesus.
[1:43:51] Think about it. Do you know him today?
[1:43:56] Please don't turn him away.
[1:44:00] Jesus.
[1:44:03] Oh Jesus.
[1:44:07] Without him how lost I would be.
[1:44:14] It is no secret. It is no secret.
[1:44:23] It's the same DNA. Amen.
[1:44:26] It is no secret
[1:44:32] what God can do.
[1:44:37] What he's done for others,
[1:44:41] he'll do for you. Lord, I want that.
[1:44:46] With arms wide open,
[1:44:49] [Music]
[1:44:51] he'll pardon you.
[1:44:56] It is no secret
[1:45:01] what God can do.
[1:45:06] It is no secret
[1:45:10] what God can do.
[1:45:15] What he's done for others,
[1:45:20] he'll do for you.
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:25] With arms wide open,
[1:45:28] [Applause]
[1:45:29] he'll pardon you.
[1:45:34] It is no secret
[1:45:39] what God can do. Let's believe it now.
[1:45:44] It is no secret
[1:45:48] what God can do.
[1:45:53] What he's done for others,
[1:45:58] he'll do for you.
[1:46:02] With arms wide open,
[1:46:07] he'll pardon you.
[1:46:12] It is no secret
[1:46:16] what God can do.
[1:46:22] Amen. continue to play that if you
[1:46:24] would. It is no secret
[1:46:28] what God can do.
[1:46:32] I believe that all of us here
[1:46:36] want God to do something for us.
[1:46:41] And what we want him to do for us, he's
[1:46:44] already done for somebody else.
[1:46:47] It is no secret.
[1:46:50] He has that DNA. He wants to give it to
[1:46:53] you.
[1:46:55] He wants you to be just like him.
[1:46:59] With every head bowed, every eye closed.
[1:47:02] Maybe there'd be someone here today
[1:47:04] says, "Brother John, I'm serious with
[1:47:06] the word that's been preached today. It
[1:47:08] has pricricked my heart, and I want to
[1:47:11] be more like him." Brother John, would
[1:47:13] you pray for me that I'll become just
[1:47:15] like Jesus?
[1:47:17] Amen. God sees your hand. He sees the
[1:47:20] sincerity of your heart.
[1:47:23] Now, I'm just going to ask you today to
[1:47:26] believe. To believe with all that's
[1:47:29] within you. Believe.
[1:47:32] Brother Brandham said, "It's just a
[1:47:35] simple faith.
[1:47:37] It's you walking out and not forgetting
[1:47:40] that you raised your hand today and that
[1:47:43] you're going to leave here determined to
[1:47:46] manifest Christ." because I believe what
[1:47:47] that's what this message was all about
[1:47:49] this morning.
[1:47:52] And if you can just believe it, all
[1:47:54] things are possible.
[1:47:57] Amen. Our heavenly father,
[1:48:01] thank you for your DNA today.
[1:48:05] Thank you that you want to give us the
[1:48:07] Holy Ghost more than we want it.
[1:48:10] Thank you that you want to reveal your
[1:48:12] word to us, Lord, just as humble babes
[1:48:18] that desire the sincere milk of the
[1:48:20] word.
[1:48:23] God, we want to become the word. We want
[1:48:26] to become like you. We want to be
[1:48:28] overcomers.
[1:48:30] We want to shine in this dark world. We
[1:48:33] want to be delivered from the things
[1:48:35] that we need deliverance from.
[1:48:38] We want about to look in the mirror and
[1:48:39] see Jesus.
[1:48:42] We want about to look in the mirror and
[1:48:44] say, "One day,
[1:48:46] I'm going to be just like you, Jesus.
[1:48:50] I'm going to walk. I'm going to talk."
[1:48:53] And Lord,
[1:48:55] we all want to take time right now to
[1:48:57] thank you for the things that you have
[1:48:58] delivered us from.
[1:49:01] Thank you for delivering us from
[1:49:02] smoking, from drinking, from cussing,
[1:49:05] from swearing. Thank you for delivering
[1:49:08] us from anger, from those terrible
[1:49:10] habits, Lord, the terrible habit of
[1:49:13] hating our brothers and our sisters.
[1:49:16] Lord, thank you for the mighty
[1:49:17] deliverance. Thank you for bringing us
[1:49:19] out of Egypt. Thank you for bringing us
[1:49:21] through the Red Sea.
[1:49:24] Thank you, Lord, for forgiving us for
[1:49:26] murmuring or complaining.
[1:49:29] Lord, thank you. Thank you with all of
[1:49:32] our heart. And now, Lord, we're looking
[1:49:35] onto you. Not just the author, but the
[1:49:38] finisher of our faith.
[1:49:40] Lord, you had joy set before you endured
[1:49:43] the cross.
[1:49:45] And now, Lord, we have that same joy in
[1:49:50] our heart
[1:49:51] to be like you.
[1:49:56] That one day we're going to wake up.
[1:49:59] And Job said, "I'll not be satisfied to
[1:50:01] awake in your likeness." Job's our
[1:50:04] brother, Lord, and we want to awake in
[1:50:07] your likeness because we got the same
[1:50:09] DNA.
[1:50:10] We know we're in this past house, but
[1:50:12] there's a power of the Holy Spirit that
[1:50:15] can change our lives, Lord. And that's
[1:50:17] what we're believing on today. We're
[1:50:19] believing for more of you, Lord Jesus.
[1:50:22] God, may you fill us with more of your
[1:50:24] Holy Spirit today. Fill us to
[1:50:26] overflowing,
[1:50:28] Lord. Fill us till we, Lord, till we
[1:50:33] our cup runth over. We're acting like
[1:50:36] you. We're thinking like you. We're
[1:50:37] loving one another. Grant it, Lord.
[1:50:40] Receive receive our prayer. Receive our
[1:50:44] our hearts, Lord, as we lay ourselves on
[1:50:47] the altar today with this prayer. We
[1:50:50] trust you. Give you the glory and honor
[1:50:53] for it. As we commit our lives into your
[1:50:55] hands now for more of you, we pray these
[1:50:58] things in Jesus Christ's precious name.
[1:51:02] Amen. And amen. Just sing it now. More
[1:51:06] more of him.
[1:51:08] Of you.
[1:51:12] Oh, more of you.
[1:51:17] I've had it all. But what I need is just
[1:51:23] more of you.
[1:51:27] Of things I've had my fill.
[1:51:32] And yet I hunger still
[1:51:38] empty and bare. Lord hear our prayer for
