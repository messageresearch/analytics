[44:59] is liberty

[45:22] interpretation to
[45:24] the song that he sang
[45:26] bible said when somebody speaks in
[45:28] tongues there has to be somebody to
[45:29] interpret
[45:31] so i am very grateful to the lord today
[45:34] i'm going to be the interpreter
[45:35] of the
[45:36] speaking in tongues
[45:39] well that song that she just sang
[45:42] says that
[45:43] all things will pass away kingdoms will
[45:46] pass away
[45:48] but the word of god will abide forever
[45:52] and for that matter he is god amen
[45:56] he doesn't change
[45:58] so we bow down and we worship him
[46:01] that is all the interpretation
[46:04] let's give club to the lord jesus christ
[46:06] amen
[46:09] hallelujah yeah indeed everything is
[46:11] passing away whether we like it or not
[46:14] everything nations kingdoms are rising
[46:16] and breaking what is nebuchadnezzar
[46:18] kingdom today
[46:20] where is alexander the greatest kingdom
[46:23] where is the medications
[46:26] and even the kingdom that is governing
[46:28] the world now is passing away gradually
[46:31] by the word of god
[46:34] and for that matter the people of god we
[46:36] will abide forever
[46:38] amen so we don't have any cause but to
[46:40] praise and to magnify him always
[46:43] hallelujah well before we go into the
[46:46] word of god then there are some
[46:49] a few missionary reports i want to give
[46:52] to you

[46:55] as the
[46:57] captain of the ship

[47:08] seer of the ship
[47:10] hallelujah we've been able by god's
[47:12] grace
[47:13] continue to go on mission trip locally
[47:18] and this uh in fact forgot the previous
[47:21] previous pictures are supposed to have
[47:24] brought them but i forgot them as it was
[47:26] um oversight so the these are the
[47:29] current one that we've been this is a
[47:32] church
[47:33] about two and a half hours from where i
[47:35] live
[47:36] and they have benefited from the bible
[47:39] amen uh fortunately i'll go back to that
[47:42] side fortunately when i went there there
[47:45] were some new people in the church for
[47:47] the first time
[47:49] and when they heard the word of god they
[47:50] were really touched and this woman is
[47:53] one of them
[47:54] and she immediately asked for the bible
[47:57] hallelujah and so
[48:00] yeah that is that is the pastor standing
[48:02] by there
[48:03] amen
[48:05] we can go to the second one
[48:08] yeah this church have previously
[48:10] received
[48:12] the supply but then new people came
[48:15] again and they have to get it so that
[48:18] place too is about
[48:20] almost three hours from where i live
[48:23] yeah
[48:24] yeah they are also pressing on
[48:27] let's go to the nest
[48:30] now this
[48:32] it's a church
[48:34] um
[48:36] remember he gave send me some money for
[48:39] that church
[48:40] they bought a land
[48:42] and it was not enough for the church
[48:45] so they were looking for a place close
[48:49] to them it belongs to someone but they
[48:51] were able to negotiate
[48:53] and the owner sold the land to them and
[48:55] they didn't have money so i remember i
[48:57] called you and
[48:59] swiftly you send money to help them and
[49:01] so there's the land that they have
[49:03] purchased
[49:04] yeah so now they have
[49:07] i mean a little vast land that they can
[49:09] put their building and they can get some
[49:11] place to do other things
[49:14] yeah that is a pastor
[49:17] over there and i think you know this man
[49:22] yeah that's the pastor over there and uh
[49:24] this was
[49:25] one of my deacon in the church that i do
[49:28] travel with
[49:29] he is no more addicting because he has
[49:31] resigned anyway
[49:32] so that is the pastor and this is the
[49:34] structure that you have started
[49:37] so we are praying to the lord jesus
[49:39] christ that gradually
[49:41] but the last time he told me that they
[49:43] have already moved because they've been
[49:44] able to roof it and they have started
[49:47] worshiping over there
[49:49] amen yeah
[49:50] yeah that is the structure so these are
[49:52] the structures they have roof we have
[49:54] removed the structure and i think they
[49:56] have cemented the ground
[49:58] so they they just worship under the
[50:01] sheep like that yeah
[50:03] okay
[50:04] and this is another these new people
[50:07] that came to my church and they need the
[50:10] bible to i give to them yeah

[52:50] when after i gave the bible out
[52:52] then there was one sister who came

[53:45] for the bible and because of that these
[53:47] two these three also came around and i
[53:50] couldn't refuse them because i
[53:53] have already given to the the deacon's
[53:55] wife

[57:40] veterans like that
[57:43] god bless you brother samuel johnson

[57:50] here he was taking me to um
[57:54] rapport yeah and we passed by his church
[57:56] i didn't know
[57:57] i didn't know in fact the moment brad
[57:59] johnson had that i'm around he requested
[58:02] that i should preach
[58:03] and in fact i was i was taken aback
[58:05] because i was not i didn't know that i
[58:08] was going to be called upon to preach
[58:11] so i couldn't do that and i i apologize
[58:14] but he gave me the opportunity to read
[58:16] the church
[58:17] yeah yeah so i'm happy today john said
[58:21] that we have met again god bless you
[58:23] sister god bless you
[58:24] amen
[58:26] yeah so this morning
[58:28] we want to speak on creating by your
[58:30] word
[58:33] creating by your word
[58:35] um i would say the second part of last
[58:38] um
[58:39] wednesdays someone will preach here but
[58:41] those of you who were not in church
[58:43] and the title was
[58:45] look
[58:46] unto jesus but i'm not going to preach
[58:48] that and we just want to continue
[58:52] amen
[58:53] creating by your word and in fact i
[58:56] always say that when i am preaching to
[58:58] you you must also preach to me
[59:02] amen
[59:03] because i don't do the preaching alone
[59:05] i pray to you and you preach to me
[59:08] by you responding to amen where you need
[59:10] to respond to amen
[59:12] hallelujah
[59:13] creating by your word
[59:16] now the bible said
[59:18] west are spirits is that yes
[59:21] west are spirit
[59:23] and that is why christians you must
[59:25] always be careful what comes out from
[59:28] your mouth
[59:29] because it can be a case
[59:31] and it can be a blessing upon someone
[59:34] that is why we are always seasoned when
[59:36] we want to speak and we speak nothing
[59:39] but the glorious ways of the kingdom
[59:42] amen and amen
[59:44] so
[59:45] whatever you are whatever you do
[59:48] whatever
[59:49] you say make sure
[59:51] that it isn't amen amen hallelujah you
[59:56] know by god's word he created all things
[59:59] amen
[1:00:01] one day well sometimes the science
[1:00:03] scientists for that matter
[1:00:05] you see them writing so many things that
[1:00:08] the world has been existing 72 000
[1:00:10] million years and all that
[1:00:12] sometimes they say 80 million years
[1:00:15] but we have a prophet and we know
[1:00:18] what time he told us
[1:00:21] amen that this world has you know stood
[1:00:25] hallelujah so no scientist can confuse
[1:00:28] us
[1:00:32] but what i'm trying to say is that
[1:00:35] when we are talking about our god
[1:00:38] nobody can determine how many years
[1:00:41] he existed
[1:00:44] before one day he got up and said let
[1:00:46] there be
[1:00:48] and when he said let there be there was
[1:00:50] amen
[1:00:51] it was out of his word
[1:00:54] that created the heavens and the earth
[1:00:57] when he said let there be light the
[1:00:59] light came up
[1:01:01] and the bible said that he created man
[1:01:03] after all his creation
[1:01:06] man was the only creation that he
[1:01:09] created in his image
[1:01:12] the trees
[1:01:14] the fowls
[1:01:16] the beasts on the field
[1:01:17] none of them were in the likeness of god
[1:01:21] but man
[1:01:23] and so when god created man
[1:01:25] he gave him the ability of creation
[1:01:29] that adam could have created
[1:01:32] yes in fact the bible account says that
[1:01:35] all the creation was named by adam
[1:01:40] so you realize that he had the power
[1:01:43] to do everything
[1:01:45] that would be in line of god's word
[1:01:50] but
[1:01:51] something happened
[1:01:53] and that creative power left him right
[1:01:58] in fact the prophet said that adam could
[1:02:00] have told these three move
[1:02:03] i don't like where you are standing go
[1:02:05] and situate yourself here and the tree
[1:02:07] has to obey adam
[1:02:10] because of that creative power the lord
[1:02:12] put in him
[1:02:14] now but after
[1:02:16] sin came into the garden of eden
[1:02:19] man lost that ability
[1:02:22] adam loved that ability
[1:02:25] and he became so miserable
[1:02:29] and even the garden the precious
[1:02:31] gardener god made for him and his wife
[1:02:34] god sucked them from the garden
[1:02:38] and they started suffering they started
[1:02:40] working hard before they could find ends
[1:02:43] meet
[1:02:45] and i'm sure that adam didn't like that
[1:02:47] idea
[1:02:48] but there was nothing he could do about
[1:02:50] it
[1:02:52] now let me ask you a question before i
[1:02:54] continue
[1:02:56] everybody know in this world
[1:03:00] that
[1:03:00] america is the number one nation is that
[1:03:03] not it
[1:03:04] well there is there is i mean let's say
[1:03:06] freedom enjoyment
[1:03:08] and peace and all that
[1:03:12] that is why millions and millions and
[1:03:14] millions of people from other nations
[1:03:16] always want to come to america
[1:03:19] go on to the emergencies and you see how
[1:03:21] many
[1:03:22] applications for visas that are piled
[1:03:24] over there
[1:03:26] everybody wants to come to america
[1:03:27] because america is sweet we have ice
[1:03:30] cream here
[1:03:32] we have pizza here
[1:03:34] we have hamburger here yesterday brad
[1:03:36] jonas is a cheryl and sister i'm too
[1:03:38] curious to uh have i don't pronounce
[1:03:40] those uh that place well what's the name
[1:03:43] frank franken
[1:03:45] frankfurman
[1:03:48] we enjoy ourselves very well
[1:03:51] in a gentleman who i have never been to
[1:03:53] german before but of acting german fruit
[1:03:56] can you imagine that everything is okay
[1:03:59] here so everybody want to come here now
[1:04:01] let me ask a question will you be happy
[1:04:04] if they will tell you
[1:04:06] move from america
[1:04:08] and go and live in one of these poor
[1:04:11] nations will you be happy about that
[1:04:13] certainly not
[1:04:16] yes
[1:04:17] i am not sure you'll be happy
[1:04:19] and so that was the condition of adam
[1:04:22] after he was sat from the garden
[1:04:25] he became so miserable he was not happy
[1:04:28] he has lost his his joy he has lost his
[1:04:31] power he has lost his ability to create
[1:04:34] so he became so miserable
[1:04:37] and brother and sister do you know have
[1:04:39] you ever sat down to realize that as
[1:04:43] much as adam was so miserable in that
[1:04:45] condition god was also miserable
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:50] because
[1:04:52] god also lost his fellowship
[1:04:56] the bible said at the cool of the day he
[1:04:58] always descended into the garden and he
[1:05:00] have con fellowship with adam
[1:05:03] but when adam was sat from the garden
[1:05:06] that fellowship broke
[1:05:08] so adam was not happy god was also not
[1:05:10] happy
[1:05:13] god was miserable
[1:05:15] and god didn't want it that way
[1:05:17] so god found another way
[1:05:20] to restore that solution back
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:27] and one day there was a man called abram
[1:05:31] whom
[1:05:33] was in his father's home
[1:05:36] he only heard a voice
[1:05:38] abraham come from among your people
[1:05:42] and he did
[1:05:44] he did that by faith because he didn't
[1:05:46] know which
[1:05:47] god was speaking to him
[1:05:49] he only had a voice
[1:05:51] and by faith he followed the voice
[1:05:54] hallelujah
[1:05:56] and we know that when god called abraham
[1:06:00] he put in him faith
[1:06:04] and that was the faith that restored man
[1:06:07] back to that creative power
[1:06:11] hallelujah we can talk about enoch
[1:06:14] we can talk about noah
[1:06:17] hallelujah whom god used to build the
[1:06:20] ark
[1:06:22] okay cannot imagine that even human
[1:06:24] being refused to to lift him to the call
[1:06:29] but
[1:06:29] noah spoke to animals
[1:06:32] and they entered into the act for safety
[1:06:36] so now when god called the abram he said
[1:06:39] abram comes from among your people
[1:06:42] and he obeyed
[1:06:43] and you put in him faith
[1:06:47] and watch it this way
[1:06:49] that all that abraham
[1:06:52] went through
[1:06:53] was just a test
[1:06:55] but nothing none of these tests
[1:06:58] made him to fail
[1:07:01] i remember when he was living even
[1:07:04] though god didn't ask him to
[1:07:06] you know
[1:07:07] add a lot to it
[1:07:09] but he allowed lord to go with him
[1:07:12] anyhow
[1:07:13] and it came to a point
[1:07:15] when the uh cattles and their sheep and
[1:07:18] those things were being increased they
[1:07:21] became contention between adam servants
[1:07:23] and that of lots
[1:07:25] and
[1:07:26] i'm sorry i said adam i'm talking about
[1:07:28] abram
[1:07:29] and abraham call lord you say lord
[1:07:33] now
[1:07:34] our animals are increasing day by day
[1:07:37] and that is why our servants are you
[1:07:39] know at loggerheads now separate
[1:07:42] yourself from me
[1:07:44] look we have so many
[1:07:46] you know
[1:07:47] vegetations that if you go to the east
[1:07:49] i'll go to the west if you go to the
[1:07:51] north i'll go to the south pick choose
[1:07:54] lot didn't say that oh
[1:07:56] uncle you are the elder
[1:07:59] make your choice first
[1:08:01] he didn't do that
[1:08:03] well well i don't know about america but
[1:08:05] when you go come to ghana africa
[1:08:08] always elders first
[1:08:11] yes when you are eating
[1:08:14] with the elder
[1:08:15] and you go for fish
[1:08:17] they will knock you
[1:08:18] yes
[1:08:20] they will knock your head you don't
[1:08:22] respect
[1:08:24] the elder has to break the fish i give
[1:08:26] to you
[1:08:27] i don't know about that
[1:08:29] but lord
[1:08:32] the bible said that he looked where the
[1:08:33] vegetation was green
[1:08:35] and he picked that one he didn't
[1:08:37] consider his elderly uncle
[1:08:40] and
[1:08:42] abraham told you that where you are
[1:08:43] picked it there's danger there
[1:08:46] but he didn't listen
[1:08:48] steve naked
[1:08:50] hallelujah love did not lift him
[1:08:54] he picked that place anyhow
[1:08:57] and when he left there was a trouble
[1:08:59] there was trouble one day
[1:09:01] that there were some five
[1:09:03] kings
[1:09:06] who mounted up together and they
[1:09:08] attacked sodom and gomorrah
[1:09:10] they killed people and lord and his
[1:09:13] family were taken captive
[1:09:15] and the bible said that
[1:09:17] a man
[1:09:18] escaped and came to abram
[1:09:22] and told abram what has happened
[1:09:25] but now when abram had this information
[1:09:31] someone who said that well i told him
[1:09:33] not to go
[1:09:34] and he didn't mind me
[1:09:37] but abram didn't do that
[1:09:41] abraham didn't do that
[1:09:44] but the bible said that he organized the
[1:09:48] the men the men in his house they were
[1:09:50] about i think 2018.
[1:09:53] he trained him
[1:09:55] and he said whether you know how to walk
[1:09:57] or not we are going to war
[1:10:01] hallelujah
[1:10:03] and then he went with this
[1:10:05] 318 men
[1:10:07] the bible said that he pursued the five
[1:10:11] kings
[1:10:14] he them he conquered them
[1:10:18] and he rescued his lord nephew and his
[1:10:20] household
[1:10:22] what can do such a miracle it is by
[1:10:25] faith
[1:10:28] because there was no way that 318 men
[1:10:32] are going to fight five nations
[1:10:35] for them to conquer
[1:10:39] but he did it anyhow
[1:10:42] and he came with a lot
[1:10:44] they were rejoicing
[1:10:47] and the bible said that while they were
[1:10:49] coming on the way they met a man
[1:10:52] amen
[1:10:54] and the man's name was melchizedek
[1:10:59] was so happy
[1:11:00] that abram has won that battle
[1:11:04] in fact the prophet he pulled one of the
[1:11:07] bodies in heaven and he jumped inside
[1:11:09] and he came as a human to meet abram on
[1:11:12] the way
[1:11:14] because that was the only thing he could
[1:11:15] do
[1:11:17] mercy said that up to today
[1:11:20] philosophers intellectuals
[1:11:22] and what we call them um
[1:11:24] bible scholars theologians still don't
[1:11:27] know who merkel zedek was
[1:11:30] and they cannot know
[1:11:33] hallelujah
[1:11:34] they cannot know
[1:11:37] because mercy was not an ordinary person
[1:11:41] mexican was not an ordinary man
[1:11:44] the bible said that he has no father he
[1:11:46] has no mother
[1:11:48] he are not beginning of days or ending
[1:11:50] of days
[1:11:50] but the theologians don't know him
[1:11:52] but thank god when the seals were open
[1:11:55] we got to know that melchizedek is no
[1:11:57] one but god almighty
[1:12:01] he descended
[1:12:03] say abram
[1:12:04] oh my
[1:12:06] you are so wonderful
[1:12:08] this that you have done
[1:12:10] praise be the most high god in fact
[1:12:12] let's read it in genesis
[1:12:14] chapter 14.
[1:12:19] genesis chapter 14.
[1:12:22] and verse 18
[1:12:29] and mercy sadiq
[1:12:31] king of salem
[1:12:33] brought forth bread and wine and he was
[1:12:36] the priest of the most high god oh
[1:12:40] and he blessed him
[1:12:42] and said blessed be abram of the most
[1:12:46] high god possessor of heaven and earth
[1:12:50] blessed
[1:12:52] you see
[1:12:54] because abraham became an overcomer
[1:12:58] mexico gave him communion
[1:13:03] and when you are child of god when you
[1:13:06] overcome the sin of this world
[1:13:09] when you refute the sin of this world
[1:13:11] when you break the chains of this world
[1:13:13] you have the right to command with god
[1:13:17] that is the reason why we take the last
[1:13:19] supper and drink the wine
[1:13:22] because we are overcomers
[1:13:25] in fact beloved let me say tonight or
[1:13:28] this morning if you are not taking let
[1:13:31] it be that short that you are an
[1:13:33] overcomer
[1:13:36] break the chance of unbelief
[1:13:39] and dine with your master
[1:13:41] done with the lord because mercy said
[1:13:44] introduce it in the beginning
[1:13:46] and now after this
[1:13:49] then
[1:13:50] melchizedek
[1:13:51] being god
[1:13:53] formed another way and met abraham
[1:13:57] and gave him a promise
[1:13:59] because he knew that abraham
[1:14:02] was living without a child
[1:14:05] abraham
[1:14:07] was childish churchill's
[1:14:10] but
[1:14:11] in the mind of god
[1:14:14] there has to be a promise or there was a
[1:14:16] promise
[1:14:17] god knew that he was going to make a
[1:14:18] nation out of abraham
[1:14:21] and so the situation of abraham at that
[1:14:23] time did not confuse god
[1:14:26] but then god came down and gave him a
[1:14:28] promise that
[1:14:31] a year by this time
[1:14:33] according to the time of life
[1:14:36] you have a child
[1:14:38] by your wife sarah
[1:14:41] well when you read some place in the
[1:14:42] bible
[1:14:44] abraham laughed
[1:14:46] god didn't say anything
[1:14:48] but another time when he said the same
[1:14:50] thing and sarah laughed god questioned
[1:14:52] why did sarah laugh
[1:14:56] you see that different two different
[1:14:58] ways
[1:15:00] someone laughed god didn't say anything
[1:15:01] but under one last god question amen
[1:15:04] because the laughter of abraham was
[1:15:06] faith
[1:15:08] he knew that surely the lord would not
[1:15:10] stand by his word
[1:15:12] but the woman doubted with the god knew
[1:15:15] that the woman doubted
[1:15:17] that is why he questioned
[1:15:19] praise be the name of our god and when
[1:15:21] this thing was said
[1:15:23] from that day
[1:15:25] abraham became a changed man
[1:15:29] he knew
[1:15:30] that the wife was 19 years old
[1:15:34] how can it be possible
[1:15:36] but he accepted it anyhow
[1:15:39] and like the prophet dramatized this
[1:15:43] he said from that the first man came
[1:15:46] and abram asked sarah sarah
[1:15:49] how do you feel
[1:15:51] he said sarah said well
[1:15:52] the same old story
[1:15:54] and everyone said bless the lord
[1:15:57] there shall be a performance
[1:15:59] can you imagine abraham an old man who
[1:16:02] everybody knew
[1:16:04] who have gone on childless
[1:16:07] who enter into um shops
[1:16:10] well back home we call it madake i don't
[1:16:12] know how you call it in america here
[1:16:14] where they sell
[1:16:16] um children item you know
[1:16:18] those things yes abraham will enter and
[1:16:21] ask for
[1:16:22] baby food
[1:16:24] he will ask for baby diaper he will ask
[1:16:27] for baby towels and people look at this
[1:16:30] old man
[1:16:32] what are you grabbing this for
[1:16:35] he said yes my wife
[1:16:37] is expecting
[1:16:39] they will look at abraham and they will
[1:16:41] laugh because to them it will be
[1:16:43] impossible
[1:16:44] but abraham was turning upon the word of
[1:16:46] god amen
[1:16:49] abraham was allowing his word to create
[1:16:53] he said bless the lord it will be amen
[1:16:57] amen and amen no matter how the people
[1:17:00] in all disbelief no matter how they put
[1:17:03] doubt no matter how the people look on
[1:17:05] you let your word become the creative
[1:17:08] power
[1:17:11] oh hallelujah
[1:17:13] amen and amen and one day
[1:17:16] when abraham asked sarah
[1:17:19] sarah
[1:17:21] how do you feel today
[1:17:22] he said well today
[1:17:25] i felt something unusual
[1:17:27] the first time in my life
[1:17:29] something is moving within my my belly i
[1:17:32] don't know what it is
[1:17:35] then abraham held her hand
[1:17:38] he asked him to be a doctor
[1:17:40] and he felt his for her pause he said no
[1:17:44] the promise of god has made manifested
[1:17:46] amen there is something that has taken
[1:17:49] place in your womb
[1:17:51] that what promise of god that you are
[1:17:53] going to have the child it has begun
[1:17:55] amen oh hallelujah
[1:17:58] speak the word my brother my sister
[1:18:00] and there shall be a performance of your
[1:18:02] word amen
[1:18:04] amen
[1:18:06] and we all know that story
[1:18:08] that sarah gave birth to isaac and isaac
[1:18:12] became a blessing to all of us
[1:18:14] and now this melchizedek
[1:18:17] in the old testament
[1:18:19] when you come to this new testament he
[1:18:21] is the lord jesus christ
[1:18:24] in fact when you read about account in
[1:18:26] hebrews the way paul explained it you
[1:18:29] realize that with that term creative
[1:18:31] power he came on this earth
[1:18:33] even though people said that well
[1:18:36] the people look on him and they said
[1:18:37] well it's joseph's son
[1:18:40] it depends upon what you are looking for
[1:18:43] if you want to look on jesus
[1:18:46] and see joseph's son you will see him
[1:18:49] if you want to look on jesus and you you
[1:18:51] want to see a bell you see
[1:18:54] you want to see jesus you want to look
[1:18:56] on jesus
[1:18:57] for you to see an illegitimate child you
[1:19:00] will see him
[1:19:01] and if you want to look on jesus to see
[1:19:04] the almighty god you will see him it
[1:19:08] depends upon how you are looking for
[1:19:11] hallelujah
[1:19:13] but when paul anointed by the holy
[1:19:16] spirit
[1:19:17] yes when you look on jesus christ that
[1:19:19] day he saw that he was the mercy deck
[1:19:22] who met
[1:19:23] abraham on the way
[1:19:25] and he gave him communion
[1:19:27] with that creative power
[1:19:29] with that unfailing promise
[1:19:32] one day
[1:19:33] the bible said that he was
[1:19:35] walking
[1:19:36] with the disciples
[1:19:39] and they came to see a blind man the
[1:19:41] bible said that he was born blind
[1:19:44] and the disciples were the one who asked
[1:19:47] jesus christ a question
[1:19:49] it's a master
[1:19:51] who did sin
[1:19:53] in this man
[1:19:55] or his parents
[1:19:58] but listen to the answer that jesus gave
[1:20:01] he said
[1:20:03] this man was born blind not the sin
[1:20:06] of the parents
[1:20:08] or he himself
[1:20:10] but he was born blind that the glory of
[1:20:12] god might be made manifest
[1:20:16] hallelujah you see beloved
[1:20:18] that is why many many times we have to
[1:20:20] stop complaining
[1:20:24] because look
[1:20:25] what that will like it or not god knows
[1:20:28] the affairs that concern his children
[1:20:31] anything that will go through god is
[1:20:33] already aware of it
[1:20:36] it all is to his glory brother sister we
[1:20:38] have to understand that
[1:20:41] sometimes we may not like the situation
[1:20:44] sometimes we may cry on the situation
[1:20:46] sometimes we may rejoice on the
[1:20:48] situation but you know it is to the
[1:20:50] glory of our creator
[1:20:54] hallelujah amen
[1:20:55] he said not the man not the parents but
[1:20:58] the glory of god might be made manifest
[1:21:02] and the bible said that after he said
[1:21:04] that he spat on the on the ground
[1:21:08] and he used the spittle to form a clay
[1:21:11] and anoint the eye of the man
[1:21:13] oh hallelujah
[1:21:15] the prophet said that we consider
[1:21:17] existing elements
[1:21:19] and he said at home they put a potassium
[1:21:22] and something something something
[1:21:23] petroleum and cosmic light and all that
[1:21:26] they were all in us they are all in us
[1:21:28] in fact
[1:21:30] i don't know the type of clay god used
[1:21:32] in creating my nose
[1:21:34] i cannot determine the type of clay he
[1:21:36] used in making my ear
[1:21:38] i cannot determine what he used to make
[1:21:40] my leg or my belly
[1:21:43] which i stopped foot inside i don't know
[1:21:47] but i believe that that day
[1:21:50] when jesus met the blind man
[1:21:54] and he looked on the ground he realized
[1:21:56] that the type of clay that he used in
[1:21:58] making the eye of the man was there
[1:22:03] oh hallelujah
[1:22:05] and he spot on that and you use it and
[1:22:07] another i said go and watch yes
[1:22:10] the man went on watch
[1:22:13] and he saw
[1:22:14] [Music]
[1:22:16] the pharisees should have praised god
[1:22:18] for this
[1:22:20] but because of the way they are looking
[1:22:24] to jesus
[1:22:26] they doubted amen they refused to
[1:22:29] believe and they called this man
[1:22:32] they questioned the man
[1:22:35] the man said well
[1:22:37] after me i don't know him
[1:22:40] whatever you say
[1:22:42] the only thing i know
[1:22:44] once i was blind but now i can see
[1:22:50] hallelujah so who are those who are
[1:22:54] criticizing the message of this hour
[1:22:57] who are those who are condemning the
[1:23:00] message of this hour
[1:23:02] whether they condemn it or not one thing
[1:23:04] that i know was i was a sinner but now i
[1:23:08] am a believer
[1:23:09] [Applause]
[1:23:11] last wednesday i was telling you how we
[1:23:14] came into the message
[1:23:16] we were pentecostal believers
[1:23:19] need we need we knew nothing but about
[1:23:22] speaking in tongues
[1:23:24] but we couldn't live a christian life
[1:23:27] it was bunch of hypocrisy
[1:23:30] hallelujah
[1:23:31] but that day
[1:23:33] i said that day
[1:23:36] when the lord jesus met us
[1:23:39] in the face of this message
[1:23:41] oh brother sister something different
[1:23:44] happened to our experience
[1:23:47] we realize that not knowing we have not
[1:23:49] even started christianity yet
[1:23:52] so it was the opening of this message
[1:23:55] that put us into christianity
[1:23:58] so i don't care whoever will say this
[1:24:01] that is that once i was blind but now
[1:24:04] i can see
[1:24:09] hallelujah
[1:24:11] that day on the mountain
[1:24:14] after elijah have spoken about three
[1:24:16] years
[1:24:18] he said
[1:24:20] so long as i live as the prophet of god
[1:24:24] on this land
[1:24:26] there are not going to be any rain
[1:24:28] nor do
[1:24:29] that will fall
[1:24:32] until i call for it
[1:24:36] and the moment elijah said that god
[1:24:39] locked the heavens
[1:24:41] no rain
[1:24:43] do you know why he said that
[1:24:46] because he was on line of duty
[1:24:51] amen he was standing in the foot of
[1:24:53] jesus christ for that matter
[1:24:57] he locked the heavens
[1:24:59] so when they were suffering here and
[1:25:02] there oh brother
[1:25:04] even it affected elijah himself
[1:25:10] he locked the heavens
[1:25:12] and god said that go i'll let some bed
[1:25:15] feed you
[1:25:17] and god made beds to feed elijah
[1:25:22] and he came to a time
[1:25:25] the best could not bake the bread any
[1:25:27] longer
[1:25:30] they were shocked they had shortage of
[1:25:32] flour
[1:25:33] so elijah was going hungry
[1:25:36] can we imagine that then god told elijah
[1:25:39] rajon
[1:25:41] go to the widow
[1:25:44] the widow didn't have anything
[1:25:47] but god didn't care about that he said
[1:25:50] go to that widow
[1:25:52] you see god sometimes put us into a
[1:25:54] situation
[1:25:56] that in human thinking
[1:25:59] it will not be sensible
[1:26:02] but if you are a child of god
[1:26:05] and you have strengthened your years
[1:26:07] to follow the commandment of god you
[1:26:10] don't have to complain
[1:26:14] hallelujah
[1:26:16] it's unbelievable why should elijah go
[1:26:19] to the widow who didn't have anything
[1:26:22] and even he said i don't have anything
[1:26:24] to eat this thing that i'm breaking is i
[1:26:26] have what a muscle of
[1:26:29] uh what do we call it
[1:26:30] yes and i'm going to prepare it for
[1:26:32] myself and my son and we and we die
[1:26:35] because that was their last hope
[1:26:38] elijah said well go and do it but make
[1:26:40] sure you give to me first
[1:26:45] he was standing
[1:26:47] instead of god
[1:26:48] and everything that you do beloved make
[1:26:51] sure god is first
[1:26:55] the prophet said that don't never make
[1:26:57] god second in your life
[1:27:01] never make god second he said everything
[1:27:04] that you do make god first
[1:27:08] let god be first
[1:27:10] hallelujah
[1:27:12] and then a time came that elijah has to
[1:27:14] meet
[1:27:16] uh after ahab has come all the regions
[1:27:19] and have not found him like i said well
[1:27:21] today i'm going to show myself so he
[1:27:23] told obadiah go and tell you again
[1:27:25] today he will see me
[1:27:28] and then
[1:27:29] he told him
[1:27:31] today
[1:27:33] we will not stand upon double opinions
[1:27:37] if baal
[1:27:39] is god
[1:27:41] let us prove it
[1:27:43] if jehovah god is the god of the
[1:27:44] israelites let us prove it but this is
[1:27:46] how we are going to do it
[1:27:49] let all the bad prophets meet me on
[1:27:51] mount carmel
[1:27:53] and we are going to ask
[1:27:55] the god that will answer by fire to be
[1:27:59] the god of the israelites
[1:28:01] and they assembled all about prophets
[1:28:05] elijah said well
[1:28:07] take up your your sacrifice and do the
[1:28:10] sacrifice because you are many i'm alone
[1:28:13] and they prepare their sacrifice
[1:28:16] and uh you know this bad prophet started
[1:28:18] chanting they were calling on bar they
[1:28:21] called them back they called them back
[1:28:23] they called them ba ba was nowhere to to
[1:28:25] to come
[1:28:27] what
[1:28:28] they call and call and call and call and
[1:28:30] call
[1:28:32] then
[1:28:33] illegal started to mock them
[1:28:35] he said look
[1:28:36] call him call call call bow because
[1:28:40] perhaps
[1:28:41] he has gone to he has gone to little uh
[1:28:44] little caesar he's going to buy pizza
[1:28:47] so call call call call
[1:28:50] call call balwell
[1:28:52] they call and call uncle say oh no no
[1:28:54] wait wait wait wait maybe
[1:28:56] paul has gone to a dq he's going to get
[1:28:59] some ice cream so call call call call
[1:29:01] call
[1:29:02] and they called and called and called
[1:29:05] the bible said that then they started
[1:29:06] cutting themselves with knives
[1:29:10] you know why
[1:29:11] because sometimes they sacrifice human
[1:29:14] beings
[1:29:16] they knew they thought that baal needed
[1:29:19] blood of human that moment before he
[1:29:21] would respond
[1:29:22] they cut themselves with knife and still
[1:29:25] there was nowhere to be found
[1:29:27] hallelujah
[1:29:29] they didn't know
[1:29:31] that
[1:29:33] could under no circumstance come to that
[1:29:35] mountain
[1:29:38] listen
[1:29:39] not that they didn't know what they were
[1:29:41] doing
[1:29:42] they were always calling for baal and
[1:29:44] baal responded to them but that day bow
[1:29:47] did not respond their reason was that
[1:29:50] god was standing on the mountain
[1:29:54] hallelujah where elijah was standing god
[1:29:57] was standing
[1:29:58] today where you stand god also stand
[1:30:00] there as a child of god
[1:30:03] so bad didn't come
[1:30:07] then elijah said well
[1:30:09] in fact the bible said i went it was
[1:30:11] getting to the evening sacrifice time
[1:30:13] like i said oh wait it's okay
[1:30:17] now your bowel didn't answer you stay
[1:30:20] aside
[1:30:21] now step back
[1:30:24] and the bible says that
[1:30:27] elijah
[1:30:28] prepared the altar
[1:30:30] with 12 stones
[1:30:32] he built the altar
[1:30:34] and he killed the sacrifice
[1:30:37] and he requested for 12 barrels of water
[1:30:41] to wash the sacrifice
[1:30:44] and he said lord
[1:30:47] i've spoken this thing in your name
[1:30:51] let there be creation
[1:30:53] amen immediately fire come down from
[1:30:55] heaven
[1:30:59] burn all the sacrifice bend the stone
[1:31:01] and lick all the water around it
[1:31:04] and the people started praising god the
[1:31:07] bible said that they said oh god is god
[1:31:12] god is god
[1:31:14] and they worship the god
[1:31:16] of elijah
[1:31:20] now
[1:31:21] all the bad prophets
[1:31:23] were dumbfounded
[1:31:25] they didn't know what to do
[1:31:27] they wanted to escape
[1:31:29] elijah said no
[1:31:31] don't allow any of them to escape
[1:31:34] kill all of them
[1:31:36] and elijah kill all of them
[1:31:39] that is why today we kill every
[1:31:40] unbeliever in our life
[1:31:43] anything that rise against gods when we
[1:31:45] kill it
[1:31:46] hallelujah let your word kill everything
[1:31:49] that is contrary to the word of god
[1:31:52] oh praise be the name of our god
[1:31:55] by the word of elijah jezebel was killed
[1:31:59] amen
[1:32:00] yes sir
[1:32:02] by the word of elijah jezebel was killed
[1:32:05] today let your word also kill jezebel
[1:32:09] in your life
[1:32:11] let your word kill unbelief in your life
[1:32:14] let your word kill sickness in your life
[1:32:17] let your word create something amen that
[1:32:19] will be a blessing to you in your life
[1:32:23] amen amen
[1:32:28] one day
[1:32:30] when god has made pharaoh
[1:32:32] so stubborn
[1:32:35] and moses have rotted so many plagues
[1:32:38] in the land of egypt
[1:32:40] then we all know the final plague
[1:32:43] the death of the firstborns of the
[1:32:44] egyptians
[1:32:46] and that was so much for for pharaoh
[1:32:49] now pharaoh said well now get out from
[1:32:51] my land and go and worship your god
[1:32:55] i would say that they left
[1:32:58] but
[1:32:59] they came face to face
[1:33:01] with another obstacle
[1:33:03] and that was the red sea
[1:33:06] amen oh believe us
[1:33:09] once upon a time in our lives
[1:33:12] we also face situations like that
[1:33:15] sometimes you come and face an obstacle
[1:33:18] and you don't know what to do
[1:33:21] but it should not be
[1:33:23] believers of today
[1:33:25] we have so many examples in the bible
[1:33:28] that we look on
[1:33:31] to build our faith
[1:33:33] some of them didn't have anybody to look
[1:33:35] on
[1:33:36] but thank god we have so many
[1:33:41] they came facified with the red sea
[1:33:43] and the people of israel started crying
[1:33:46] against god and moses
[1:33:48] they have forgotten the salvation that
[1:33:51] god rotted in egypt for their sake
[1:33:54] the moment they felt that obstacle it it
[1:33:57] occurred to them that there was no god
[1:34:00] and that should not be any believer
[1:34:02] today anything that comes away don't
[1:34:06] never allow the devil to put that in
[1:34:07] your mind
[1:34:08] amen because it will defeat your faith
[1:34:13] why
[1:34:16] moses
[1:34:17] is it not this we told you
[1:34:20] that allow us to be servant for the
[1:34:22] egyptians
[1:34:24] moses
[1:34:26] are there no graves in egypt
[1:34:28] that you have brought us yet to die on
[1:34:30] the wilderness
[1:34:32] this were some of the questions the
[1:34:35] children of israel
[1:34:37] asked moses
[1:34:39] because they have came they have come
[1:34:41] first filled with the red sea they don't
[1:34:43] know how to cross
[1:34:44] and more so they have seen pharaoh and
[1:34:47] his soldiers coming chasing them
[1:34:50] oh brother
[1:34:53] when the situation is coming
[1:34:56] don't look to the situation
[1:34:58] but look to your god
[1:35:01] if you look to the situation you'll fail
[1:35:05] if you look to the situation you'll be
[1:35:07] discouraged
[1:35:08] if you look to the situation you'll be
[1:35:10] sad
[1:35:11] but don't look to the situation but look
[1:35:13] to the god that have called you
[1:35:17] and they wept and they cried and cried
[1:35:20] and cried until moses himself started
[1:35:23] crying
[1:35:27] oh
[1:35:30] moses
[1:35:32] but there and then
[1:35:34] the amazing god
[1:35:36] who always know
[1:35:38] how to deliver his people
[1:35:40] from trials and temptations
[1:35:43] the bible says that then when the
[1:35:46] soldiers of egyptians were getting close
[1:35:50] he placed the pillar of fire right
[1:35:53] between them
[1:35:55] the egyptian could not cross over to
[1:35:57] attack the israelites
[1:36:00] did they know that god was going to do
[1:36:02] that
[1:36:03] they did never know
[1:36:06] but god knew that he was going to do
[1:36:07] that
[1:36:09] that is why the troubles the problem
[1:36:12] that rise in your way
[1:36:14] don't never look to it
[1:36:16] but look beyond that
[1:36:18] that god is able
[1:36:20] and more than able to do exiting
[1:36:23] abundantly then what even we ask him for
[1:36:28] and moses himself started to cry oh god
[1:36:33] how am i going to do for these people to
[1:36:35] be saved how am i going to do for her to
[1:36:37] crawl the red sea
[1:36:40] let's read
[1:36:41] exodus chapter 14 quickly now
[1:36:47] exodus
[1:36:49] chapter 14.
[1:36:51] and verse 10
[1:36:58] and when pharaoh drew nine
[1:37:01] are you with me
[1:37:02] the children of israel lifted up their
[1:37:05] eyes
[1:37:06] and behold
[1:37:08] the egyptians marched after them
[1:37:10] and they were so afraid
[1:37:13] oh my
[1:37:15] for your sake
[1:37:16] for your sake israel for your sake
[1:37:19] god turned the rivers of egypt into
[1:37:21] blood
[1:37:22] they could not drink
[1:37:24] but down in goshen you were drinking
[1:37:26] fresh water
[1:37:28] for your sake
[1:37:30] god made frogs to come from nowhere
[1:37:33] to disturb the egyptians
[1:37:35] for your sake look or scheme destroy
[1:37:37] their plants
[1:37:39] for your sake egypt were into total
[1:37:41] darkness for three days and the bible
[1:37:43] said that you could even felt in the
[1:37:45] darkness amen
[1:37:47] for your sake
[1:37:48] fellows first born and the firstborn of
[1:37:51] all them
[1:37:52] died for your sake
[1:37:56] why then should you come and complain
[1:37:58] because you are facing red sea
[1:38:06] now and say
[1:38:08] when they saw the egyptian match after
[1:38:10] them
[1:38:10] and they were so afraid
[1:38:12] and the children of israel cried out
[1:38:15] unto the lord
[1:38:16] and they said unto moses
[1:38:19] because there were no graves in egypt
[1:38:22] had thou taken us away to die in the
[1:38:25] wilderness
[1:38:27] wherefore her thou dealt thus with us
[1:38:30] to carry us fought out of egypt they
[1:38:34] were even blaming moses now
[1:38:36] for coming out from bondage
[1:38:39] for coming out from slavery
[1:38:41] verse 12
[1:38:43] is not this the word that we did tell
[1:38:46] thee in egypt
[1:38:47] saying
[1:38:48] let us alone that we may serve the
[1:38:51] egyptians
[1:38:53] for it had been better for us to serve
[1:38:55] the egyptians than that we should die in
[1:38:57] the wilderness
[1:38:59] oh
[1:39:01] god have mercy
[1:39:03] verse 13 and muslims said unto the
[1:39:06] people
[1:39:07] fear yeah not
[1:39:09] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:39:12] lord which he will show to you today for
[1:39:16] the egyptians whom ye have seen today ye
[1:39:19] shall see them again no more forever
[1:39:23] verse 14
[1:39:24] the lord shall fight for you and you
[1:39:27] will hold your peace
[1:39:31] the troubles
[1:39:33] the problems
[1:39:34] it is god's own fight and not your fight
[1:39:38] the only thing is that stand still
[1:39:41] and see look to the salvation of our god
[1:39:45] amen
[1:39:47] verse 15
[1:39:48] and the lord said unto moses
[1:39:51] wherefore christ died unto me speak unto
[1:39:55] the children of israel that they go
[1:39:58] forward
[1:40:01] so it means moses himself was also
[1:40:03] crying
[1:40:06] in all the quote that he was telling
[1:40:08] them that go forward and we see the
[1:40:10] salvation of the lord he was crying
[1:40:13] and god said moses why are you crying
[1:40:17] amen
[1:40:19] tell your people to god forward
[1:40:23] go forward away
[1:40:25] in front of them was the red sea
[1:40:28] god where are they going
[1:40:32] are you thinking about it
[1:40:34] there is there is red sea
[1:40:37] and you say they should go forward where
[1:40:38] are they going to go
[1:40:40] but god said go forward
[1:40:43] he knew what he was talking about
[1:40:46] he said tell them to go forward
[1:40:50] and today we tell ourselves let's go
[1:40:52] forward
[1:40:53] irrespective of any challenges
[1:40:56] let's go forward
[1:40:58] amen
[1:40:59] amen
[1:41:02] for our god that we serve
[1:41:04] there is nothing
[1:41:06] that is impossible
[1:41:09] just speak the word
[1:41:11] he said tell them in other words speak
[1:41:13] tell them to go forward
[1:41:17] hallelujah
[1:41:21] amen
[1:41:25] but lift down up thy road and set out
[1:41:29] thy hand over the sea and divide it and
[1:41:32] the children of israel shall go on a dry
[1:41:35] ground through the midst of the sea
[1:41:39] hallelujah
[1:41:41] go forward
[1:41:43] and stretch forth your road on the sea
[1:41:45] amen
[1:41:46] and your the children of israel will go
[1:41:49] on a dry ground below that
[1:41:51] let us pause a little
[1:41:53] and let's ask ourselves question
[1:41:57] that god said
[1:41:58] they will go through the red sea
[1:42:01] on a dry ground
[1:42:03] how can that be possible
[1:42:08] the waters
[1:42:09] that has been
[1:42:11] over there since creation
[1:42:15] you and i cannot determine the volume of
[1:42:18] the mud
[1:42:22] even when it rains
[1:42:24] for just five minutes
[1:42:26] look the way the grounds become slippery
[1:42:32] and these waters has been there since
[1:42:34] creation
[1:42:37] we cannot determine the volume of the
[1:42:39] mind
[1:42:40] but god said don't walk on the great
[1:42:42] ground
[1:42:44] just speak to the word
[1:42:48] and when moses spoke the word
[1:42:51] and struck for the road and the sea it
[1:42:53] patted into two
[1:42:55] and israel walk on a dry ground oh
[1:42:59] hallelujah
[1:43:02] we are walking on dry grounds
[1:43:06] no matter what we are walking on dry
[1:43:08] grounds the lord have dried the muddy
[1:43:11] water for us
[1:43:13] and that's our victory because of our
[1:43:16] faith in him
[1:43:17] amen
[1:43:18] they walk on a dry ground
[1:43:22] now when they what they were crossing
[1:43:25] and the egyptian soldiers
[1:43:27] tried to follow them
[1:43:30] what happened
[1:43:32] you see their people did not reason
[1:43:35] for the sake of israel look at how god
[1:43:37] have turned egypt upside down
[1:43:40] and now
[1:43:42] today for the first time you have seen
[1:43:44] the arrested pattern
[1:43:46] and the people of god walking through it
[1:43:49] you're an unbeliever you want to walk
[1:43:51] through it also
[1:43:53] you don't value your life
[1:43:57] why does israel walk on a dry ground and
[1:43:59] cross
[1:44:01] when they wanted to pass through the
[1:44:03] river or the water any place that they
[1:44:05] step a turn into mud
[1:44:08] and they place egypt's step it turned
[1:44:10] into bad
[1:44:11] and the bible said that god came down
[1:44:13] and removed the arterial wheel
[1:44:16] and so they were going just like this
[1:44:18] and they were not able to catch the
[1:44:20] israelites
[1:44:21] and they cross over
[1:44:23] then god released the waters again and
[1:44:25] it swallowed all of them up
[1:44:27] that is the god that we are serving
[1:44:31] hallelujah
[1:44:33] that is the almighty god that we are
[1:44:35] serving no matter what we face no matter
[1:44:38] what comes our way we know that we are
[1:44:40] serving that yes god
[1:44:41] and he is able to turn the situation
[1:44:44] around
[1:44:45] for it to favor us
[1:44:49] amen
[1:44:51] oh brother sister will you speak the
[1:44:53] word this morning
[1:44:54] will you speak the word this morning
[1:44:57] like the last wednesday we were talking
[1:44:59] about the woman with the blood issue for
[1:45:01] 12 good years
[1:45:04] from one hospital to another the
[1:45:06] physicians could not solve a problem
[1:45:09] but one day
[1:45:11] when jesus and the disciples came around
[1:45:14] the woman allowed her word to make a
[1:45:17] creation of healing for her
[1:45:19] nobody advised her
[1:45:21] but she said
[1:45:22] if i could touch the hem of his garment
[1:45:27] i'll be made whole amen
[1:45:29] didn't advise the woman
[1:45:32] but john did not advise the woman
[1:45:34] but lamar did not advise the woman
[1:45:36] but the woman herself
[1:45:40] she made her own word
[1:45:43] to create healing
[1:45:46] amen
[1:45:48] and he indeed touched the hand of jesus
[1:45:53] and the baptism immediately
[1:45:55] she was made oh
[1:45:59] until
[1:46:00] the pull
[1:46:01] of that healing affected the strength of
[1:46:04] jesus christ
[1:46:07] he could not stand
[1:46:09] he said peter
[1:46:10] someone have touched me
[1:46:12] hey peter said oh master ah there are a
[1:46:14] lot of people who have touched you by
[1:46:16] the way and here why are you complaining
[1:46:20] he said peter i know
[1:46:22] many people have touched me
[1:46:24] but this touch that i am talking about
[1:46:28] is a different touch
[1:46:30] this is a touch of healing
[1:46:33] this is the touch of revelation because
[1:46:36] virtue has gone out of me
[1:46:38] right
[1:46:39] the woman could not hide
[1:46:42] and she owned herself up
[1:46:46] jesus christ look at the woman it's a
[1:46:47] woman
[1:46:49] your faith
[1:46:50] has made you free
[1:46:54] your faith
[1:46:55] not mindful by yours
[1:46:58] has made you free
[1:47:01] and the woman was indeed set free that
[1:47:04] day
[1:47:05] oh brother jesus said in matthew that
[1:47:08] if we can speak to the mountain
[1:47:12] and don't doubt
[1:47:14] the mountain will obey us
[1:47:17] hallelujah
[1:47:19] he says because of your unbelief for
[1:47:22] verily i say unto you if you have faith
[1:47:24] as the grain of mustard seed yes shall
[1:47:28] say unto this mountain remove hands to
[1:47:30] yonder please and it shall remove
[1:47:33] and nothing shall be impossible
[1:47:36] unto you
[1:47:40] sometimes
[1:47:43] we forget whom
[1:47:44] god has made us to be
[1:47:48] and sometimes we cherish our situation
[1:47:51] more than our faith
[1:47:54] we raise our situation more than our
[1:47:56] faith
[1:47:58] and that is what is setting us back
[1:48:02] but as people of god
[1:48:04] let us
[1:48:05] be aware
[1:48:08] that the power
[1:48:10] which
[1:48:10] is invested in the word of god
[1:48:14] will never lose
[1:48:17] that power
[1:48:19] as he gave to the early believers
[1:48:22] that power he gave to peter john andrew
[1:48:26] and the rest
[1:48:27] that power he gave to paul
[1:48:30] that power he gave to arenas that power
[1:48:34] he gave to martin that power he gave to
[1:48:37] columba that power he gave to uh martin
[1:48:39] luther that power he gave to john wesley
[1:48:42] that power he gave to william mariam
[1:48:44] abraham that power is given to you
[1:48:48] the same god
[1:48:50] hallelujah when the prophets are not
[1:48:52] here we still worship god
[1:48:57] hallelujah when they are not here the
[1:48:59] spirit of god is the guide
[1:49:03] when moses was taken away joshua didn't
[1:49:05] lead that move to the promised land he
[1:49:07] led them
[1:49:08] and the prophet said that today
[1:49:11] joshua is the holy spirit
[1:49:14] and the holy spirit is nothing but god
[1:49:19] so we are with god
[1:49:20] and god is with us
[1:49:22] he said that day you know that i am in
[1:49:25] the father the father in me are in you
[1:49:28] and you in me

[1:50:03] get in the game
[1:50:05] and at this time he has separated
[1:50:07] himself from the rest
[1:50:11] then he said

[1:50:16] say you can speak
[1:50:18] i know you like squirrel
[1:50:21] and you know scream was the favorite
[1:50:23] of the prophet
[1:50:25] if you are not tasted square before you
[1:50:27] do not understand
[1:50:29] the prophet but those of us who have got
[1:50:32] opportunity to taste squirrel will
[1:50:34] understand why the prophet said that it
[1:50:36] was his favorite because he's good
[1:50:40] very sweet
[1:50:42] hallelujah
[1:50:43] he said that the voice said that speak

[1:50:50] said initially
[1:50:53] he was he said god is at you
[1:50:57] there was no answer
[1:50:59] he waited for a while
[1:51:00] and the voice came again
[1:51:02] you can speak squirrel into existence
[1:51:07] the prophet said then he wiped his face
[1:51:11] to to i mean ascertain whether
[1:51:15] it was real
[1:51:17] not that he doubted no
[1:51:19] because he has been hearing the voice
[1:51:21] all along
[1:51:23] well god
[1:51:25] if that is you
[1:51:28] then
[1:51:29] i want one of the squirrels
[1:51:32] to come
[1:51:33] upon brother james head
[1:51:36] i am using that as just an example okay
[1:51:40] so the prophet wait yes
[1:51:43] said i want one
[1:51:46] on brother
[1:51:47] mark i'm sorry i said bro james bro mark

[1:54:01] one on brahma's head
[1:54:03] one umbrella james head and one umbrella
[1:54:06] roger's head the one that he saw over
[1:54:09] there he didn't request for it

[1:54:16] but if anyone that he requested
[1:54:19] they came exactly on the spot
[1:54:24] this word

[2:04:22] jesus christ was standing with them
[2:04:25] he said look on us
[2:04:27] silver we don't have amen

[2:05:19] when we are told that there was some
[2:05:22] wind that blew
[2:05:23] and rocks were cut in in pyramid shape
[2:05:27] what happened it was because two

[2:05:41] book of revelation chapter 10

[2:05:49] when the prophet saw some bears coming
[2:05:51] from the east
[2:05:53] or from the west
[2:05:56] he said in the beginning it was tiny
[2:05:57] tiny tiny beds
[2:05:59] that it tends to be like the size of uh
[2:06:01] of a doves
[2:06:03] that it turned also to be like jet

[2:06:26] which have been hidden from all this
[2:06:27] time is revealed go back and preach it
[2:06:33] and when they were going back
[2:06:36] there in the skies
[2:06:38] above all odds
[2:06:40] there was a cloud
[2:06:43] today people are doubting it
[2:06:45] but whether you doubt it or not
[2:06:48] whether you believe it or not
[2:06:50] there are people on this earth who have
[2:06:53] believed that one
[2:06:55] that it was nothing but the power of
[2:06:57] jesus christ
[2:06:59] looking down to his bride
[2:07:02] because two of many potents
[2:07:04] met
[2:07:06] today it is you
[2:07:09] and god
[2:07:11] something has to happen
[2:07:14] something has to happen amen
[2:07:17] one time the same prophet

[2:07:26] he did
[2:07:27] he did have been crippled all the years
[2:07:29] yes
[2:07:31] that does not mean that god didn't hear
[2:07:33] their prayers
[2:07:34] but i said that anything give god the
[2:07:37] glory
[2:07:38] before he has it for a purpose
[2:07:42] lord i've already spoken to the prophet
[2:07:43] says sir haiti
[2:07:45] just say the lord
[2:07:47] ask anything
[2:07:50] and if it doesn't fall on your lap
[2:07:52] don't believe me as a man of god
[2:07:57] and was going up and down
[2:07:59] the anointing was so much
[2:08:01] sister haiti was poor
[2:08:03] he could have asked anything
[2:08:05] he could have asked 100 million dollars
[2:08:08] he could have asked her mansions he
[2:08:10] could have asked even her sister indeed
[2:08:13] the was sitting in a wheelchair
[2:08:15] at the corner
[2:08:17] she could have asked for her healing
[2:08:20] but you know what while all this were

[2:15:06] we don't sleep here we come to preach
[2:15:07] the word
[2:15:10] amen
[2:15:11] i'm cutting from paradox he said
[2:15:13] whatever god did
[2:15:15] i don't know
[2:15:17] but the sun stood still
[2:15:20] on the moon and the moon over a jalon
[2:15:23] because a man
[2:15:26] a human being
[2:15:28] a human being was in the line of duty
[2:15:34] you remember that story
[2:15:37] the enemies
[2:15:39] were still coming
[2:15:42] and general joshua wanted to finish them
[2:15:47] and the son was going so fast
[2:15:50] and he wanted to finish them before
[2:15:54] the night falls
[2:15:56] so he spoke a word
[2:15:59] to god's creation
[2:16:02] because
[2:16:03] he was in line of duty
[2:16:06] he has also become omnipotent amen
[2:16:10] he said son stand still
[2:16:13] till i finish my enemies
[2:16:15] moon don't cross over
[2:16:20] and the bible said that there had never
[2:16:21] been a day like that
[2:16:24] that a man
[2:16:26] could interrupt god's creation like that
[2:16:30] and it was done
[2:16:32] and joshua destroyed his enemies
[2:16:35] by his word he created the situated
[2:16:38] atmosphere
[2:16:42] hallelujah
[2:16:45] he said
[2:16:46] in a line of duty
[2:16:48] he commanded the son to stand still
[2:16:51] and if we are christians we have to
[2:16:53] believe this to be the infallible word
[2:16:56] of god
[2:16:57] everywhere
[2:16:59] he stopped the world
[2:17:01] stop the sun
[2:17:02] whatever he did he stood still for 24
[2:17:06] hours
[2:17:07] i believe it
[2:17:09] that is the prophet saying that i
[2:17:11] believe it
[2:17:16] proving his word
[2:17:18] and as long as you are in a line of duty
[2:17:23] keeping god's word
[2:17:25] doing just what he told you to do
[2:17:29] martian by the orders of
[2:17:31] god
[2:17:33] you've got a right to say to that
[2:17:36] mountain be moved
[2:17:39] god keeps his word
[2:17:42] if you say to this mountain be moved and
[2:17:45] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[2:17:47] that that what you said will come to
[2:17:49] pass you can have that what you have
[2:17:51] said amen
[2:17:53] hallelujah
[2:17:57] he proved his word
[2:18:00] god always proved his word
[2:18:03] because
[2:18:04] he is not a man
[2:18:06] that should lie
[2:18:09] and amen
[2:18:11] now let me tell you this before we close
[2:18:13] do you remember the woman called jemima
[2:18:16] at memphis
[2:18:19] that their son took a bad company
[2:18:24] and he he he found himself in drugs and
[2:18:27] all that
[2:18:29] and destroyed the the organs in his in
[2:18:32] his you know within him and he was dying
[2:18:34] the doctors gave him up to die
[2:18:38] but a woman was a christian
[2:18:41] the woman went on her knees and prayed a
[2:18:44] prayer
[2:18:45] he said lord
[2:18:48] where is the elijah
[2:18:52] i want the elijah in my home
[2:18:56] lord
[2:18:58] bring me the elijah
[2:19:00] my son is dying
[2:19:03] i remember that there was an elijah in
[2:19:04] the bible
[2:19:06] who who brought back the dead child back
[2:19:08] to the to the mother
[2:19:12] after the woman prayed that prayer
[2:19:15] that night got the the doctors have
[2:19:17] rejected the guy to die
[2:19:20] he tried to try there was no hope
[2:19:23] he left the child in the room
[2:19:26] and he came out
[2:19:29] and stood outside
[2:19:31] put her hand on her fence like this
[2:19:33] at 2 30 a.m
[2:19:36] waiting
[2:19:37] to see the elijah coming
[2:19:40] where is elijah coming from he didn't
[2:19:42] think about that
[2:19:43] he only spoke it out
[2:19:46] and by that
[2:19:48] it created
[2:19:50] can you imagine that the prayer of this
[2:19:52] woman
[2:19:54] met an airplane developed a fault
[2:19:56] immediately
[2:19:59] a plane that the prophet was
[2:20:01] flying okay wait
[2:20:04] he developed fought and they have to
[2:20:06] land
[2:20:08] and when they landed
[2:20:12] as they were turning to the plane to fix
[2:20:14] the so-called fault the prophet wanted
[2:20:16] to post some letters somewhere
[2:20:19] he said the moment he moved
[2:20:21] then the voice came again he said don't
[2:20:23] go this way but go that way
[2:20:27] and he followed the voice
[2:20:30] and he said god is that you
[2:20:33] he said go ahead
[2:20:35] and the prophet went ahead continually
[2:20:38] continually continually
[2:20:41] and he kept he didn't know where he was
[2:20:42] going
[2:20:44] then all of a sudden
[2:20:47] he got to where this woman
[2:20:49] was standing
[2:20:52] the moment the woman saw him
[2:20:55] is are you the elijah
[2:20:59] and he called the the prophet person
[2:21:04] and the prophet said how did you get to
[2:21:06] know that um person
[2:21:09] he said
[2:21:10] well do you know the woman in the bible
[2:21:15] who had a son
[2:21:16] and a son died
[2:21:19] and he called for elijah
[2:21:20] to come and pray for the child to bring
[2:21:22] him back to life
[2:21:25] and he told the prophet that i am that
[2:21:27] woman amen
[2:21:31] my son have taken bad company
[2:21:33] amen and all his organs
[2:21:36] are gone he's dying he's in the room and
[2:21:39] i pray to the lord
[2:21:40] that you bring me the elijah to my home
[2:21:44] a word
[2:21:46] created can you imagine the faith that
[2:21:49] the woman used to do that prayer
[2:21:52] and a whole airplane
[2:21:54] with passengers in it have to land by
[2:21:57] force because the prophet of god was in
[2:21:59] it
[2:22:00] and god wants to send him to
[2:22:06] duty he said where is your son they say
[2:22:09] he's in the room
[2:22:11] the prophet entered into the room
[2:22:13] he said a woman was a poor woman
[2:22:15] the room was nothing to talk about but
[2:22:18] he said you saw an inscription
[2:22:22] god bless our home
[2:22:25] and he was very happy amen
[2:22:28] in fact when the prophet entered in
[2:22:30] there
[2:22:31] the boy was groaning
[2:22:34] the boy was in serious pain because
[2:22:37] time has left him
[2:22:39] life has left him he has reached the
[2:22:42] region of the lost right and he was
[2:22:45] groaning
[2:22:47] [Music]
[2:22:51] and the prophet said
[2:22:53] woman
[2:22:54] let us pray together
[2:22:57] and they prayed
[2:22:59] and the prophet had the power the woman
[2:23:01] used to pray
[2:23:03] oh
[2:23:06] then after the prophet said our lord if
[2:23:08] this is the reason why you brought me
[2:23:09] here
[2:23:10] i pray let this boy come back to life
[2:23:14] immediately
[2:23:16] the boy got up
[2:23:18] he said mama
[2:23:20] i can see light
[2:23:21] mama i can see light in the room mama i
[2:23:24] can see light in the room
[2:23:25] what happened
[2:23:27] he was in the region of the lost
[2:23:29] where there was nothing but darkness
[2:23:32] but god brought this boy back to life
[2:23:36] because of the weight of a woman
[2:23:40] he created the atmosphere

[2:26:12] please
[2:26:24] we have
[2:26:26] not just been
[2:26:27] encouraged
[2:26:30] but we
[2:26:34] have been challenged amen
[2:26:37] challenged to believe
[2:26:39] for our situations
[2:26:42] our personal situations
[2:26:44] to take this word the examples the
[2:26:47] things that were spoken the quotes
[2:26:53] and believe them for our
[2:26:55] personal situation because our personal
[2:26:58] situation isn't like what we heard
[2:27:04] but we can take
[2:27:05] those things
[2:27:07] that what god has done for others in the
[2:27:10] like manner
[2:27:12] if we can believe them personally
[2:27:15] for our personal situations
[2:27:19] we know god is the same yesterday
[2:27:20] forever
[2:27:21] he is not going to change
[2:27:25] we're the variable
[2:27:27] we're the very sometimes we listen to
[2:27:29] the devil to us sometimes we look at our
[2:27:31] situation too much sometimes we
[2:27:34] question is god really with us am i have
[2:27:36] i been too far away from the lord is he
[2:27:38] going to really really help me
[2:27:42] and i just say today don't let this word
[2:27:44] which we know is true
[2:27:46] there's no question in our mind that
[2:27:49] what we heard was the truth amen
[2:27:54] but what we're standing today is will we
[2:27:56] stand up
[2:27:59] and say i trust god for my situation
[2:28:02] amen
[2:28:03] will you will you stand
[2:28:06] upon god's word for your situation amen
[2:28:09] will you stand for
[2:28:11] god
[2:28:13] amen will you stand that
[2:28:15] that god will help you with your
[2:28:17] situation
[2:28:21] if you
[2:28:22] if you do
[2:28:23] believe then you can stand amen amen
[2:28:27] and if you don't believe you can keep
[2:28:29] sitting down
[2:28:32] you've got to stand on god's promise for
[2:28:35] your situation
[2:28:37] you've got to take a stand now like
[2:28:40] what our brother read about
[2:28:42] what the prophet said
[2:28:44] it's not going to be easy because you've
[2:28:47] got to tell the devil to get out
[2:28:50] amen there's a spiritual battle
[2:28:52] doubt in faith
[2:28:54] and it's okay to say you're in the
[2:28:56] battle because we are in the battle
[2:28:57] whether we feel it like it or not
[2:29:01] but i think what god wants to see in our
[2:29:03] lives because every one of us if we're
[2:29:05] not going through something
[2:29:07] real serious in our life
[2:29:10] we're praying for somebody that is we
[2:29:12] know somebody that is
[2:29:14] and then either either way
[2:29:17] god wants to use you your use your faith
[2:29:22] your words
[2:29:25] to claim god's promise
[2:29:30] it would just be it would be
[2:29:32] supernatural and very nice and very easy
[2:29:34] if god just came down right now with
[2:29:36] every one of our situations and said
[2:29:39] your name this is what's going on in
[2:29:41] your life and this is what i'm doing for
[2:29:42] you right today
[2:29:46] but god wants us to step out in faith
[2:29:48] and say god i heard your word i am your
[2:29:51] son i am your daughter i am a believer
[2:29:54] and i'm going to take a stand amen amen
[2:29:58] and it's through that that your faith
[2:30:01] will grow
[2:30:02] that's you saying boo to the devil and
[2:30:04] he gets smaller your situation becomes
[2:30:08] and before you know it you can just lay
[2:30:10] claim the way god wants you to lay claim
[2:30:15] and think of the times that
[2:30:17] the prophet
[2:30:18] god spoke to the prophet and he had to
[2:30:20] pinch himself was that him
[2:30:22] right
[2:30:23] it's okay that you know we heard the
[2:30:25] word we're not sure was that for me or
[2:30:27] was that for another brother or for a
[2:30:28] sister
[2:30:33] but you keep believing and that will
[2:30:35] become so personal that that was god
[2:30:37] speaking to me
[2:30:39] i went to church i don't know where
[2:30:40] everybody but god was speaking to me for
[2:30:43] my situation he wants you to leave here
[2:30:46] as if that word was just for you
[2:30:52] amen
[2:30:53] we need our musician
[2:30:56] the other musicians
