[34:00] prayer and have you be
[34:05] seated starting with verse number 20
[34:08] Jesus this is the last promise given in
[34:12] the
[34:13] Bible he which testifieth these things
[34:16] sayith surely I come quickly amen even
[34:20] so come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord
[34:24] Jesus Christ be with you all amen amen
[34:28] let's just look to God In Prayer
[34:30] Heavenly Father we want to thank you for
[34:32] the opportunity that we could come into
[34:34] this place that's being dedicated to the
[34:38] purpose that you might have the
[34:40] preeminence of speaking and ministering
[34:43] and and helping and meeting the needs of
[34:47] your
[34:47] bride Lord Jesus we just pray that you
[34:50] your presence would come in such a a a
[34:53] thorough way a a complete way that each
[34:56] and every one represented here today
[34:59] would feel that presence know that
[35:01] you're amongst us Lord and I pray that
[35:05] you would uh be so mindful as we know
[35:09] that you are but Lord let your people
[35:12] know that you you know the needs the
[35:15] desires the things upon their heart and
[35:18] Lord that you're here to do exceed above
[35:20] all that we would ask or even think of
[35:22] you to do bless each one now bless your
[35:25] word and give us the Revelation thereof
[35:28] and we'll give you the praise and honor
[35:29] for these things for we ask them in
[35:31] Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you
[35:34] you may be seated I wanted to read
[35:36] actually the last 16
[35:38] verses um of the bi of the Bible but I
[35:41] just didn't want to keep you standing
[35:43] that long so turn with me uh there the
[35:46] verse number six and and I want to
[35:49] entitle this message coming
[35:53] soon and starting with verse number six
[35:56] and one of the seven angels from Heaven
[35:58] said un to John these sayings are
[36:02] faithful and true and the Lord God of
[36:06] the Holy prophets sent his Angel to show
[36:09] unto his servants the
[36:12] things must uh which must shortly be
[36:17] done behold I come quickly blessed is he
[36:22] that keepeth the says of the prophecy of
[36:24] this
[36:25] book and I John saw saw these things and
[36:28] heard these things and when I heard them
[36:30] heard and seen I fell down to worship
[36:33] before uh before the feet of the Angel
[36:35] which showed me these
[36:37] things John Felt So Unworthy of this
[36:41] awesome presence from Heaven that he was
[36:42] feeling there was just nothing greater
[36:45] around him and it just overcame him to
[36:49] to want to fall down and worship it was
[36:51] just so real to
[36:53] him but praise God for the true angels
[36:57] of God
[36:58] which know that all glory belongs to
[37:00] Jesus
[37:03] Christ Jesus said for it is written thou
[37:05] shal Worship the Lord thy God and him
[37:07] alone
[37:09] amen then saith he unto me see thou do
[37:12] it not for I am thy fellow servant and
[37:15] of thy Brethren the prophets and of them
[37:18] which keep the sayings of this book
[37:20] worship God that's good advice for every
[37:24] one of us amen and he saith unto me seal
[37:27] not the Saints of the book in other
[37:29] words don't seal them we want them
[37:32] open seal not the says of the prophecy
[37:36] of this book for the time is at hand he
[37:39] that is unjust let him be unjust still
[37:41] and he that is filthy let him be filthy
[37:43] still and he that is righteous let him
[37:45] be righteous still he that is Holy let
[37:47] him be holy
[37:50] still now this is the angel that was
[37:55] speaking but the spirit of God God was
[37:58] so strong that actually God Jesus spoke
[38:03] these words and behold I come quickly
[38:07] and my reward is with me to give every
[38:09] man according as his work shall be I am
[38:13] the Alpha and the Omega the beginning
[38:15] and the end the first and the last and
[38:18] blessed are they that do his
[38:20] Commandments and that they may have
[38:23] right to the Tree of Life
[38:28] and may enter into the
[38:30] gates uh through the gates into the city
[38:33] for without our dogs Sorcerers hor
[38:35] mongers murderers
[38:37] adulterers idolators I'm sorry and
[38:39] whosoever loveth and maketh a
[38:41] lie I jesus sent my angel to testify to
[38:45] you these things in the churches I am
[38:48] the root The Offspring of David the
[38:50] bright and morning star and the spirit
[38:53] and the bride say come and let him that
[38:56] Hearth say come and let him that is a
[38:58] thirst come and whosoever will let him
[39:01] take of the Water of Life freely for I
[39:04] testify to every man that heareth the
[39:06] words of the prophecy of this book If
[39:08] any man shall add unto these
[39:14] things like adding our own
[39:17] ideas God shall add unto him the plagues
[39:20] that are written in this
[39:22] book and if any man shall take away from
[39:25] the words of the book of this prophecy
[39:28] in other words ignore certain
[39:32] scriptures God shall take away his part
[39:34] of the book of life and out of the holy
[39:36] city and from the things which are
[39:38] written in this book he which testifieth
[39:41] these things saith surely I come
[39:46] quickly these are the last words that
[39:50] Jesus wanted us to remember from
[39:54] him amen even so Lord Jesus and the
[39:59] grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
[40:01] you all we all want the grace of the
[40:04] Lord Jesus Christ to be with us amen I
[40:08] want to thank those of you who have
[40:13] wanted this day to come sooner and you
[40:15] had to patiently wait for our church to
[40:19] open we had a a sign out before the one
[40:22] that's out there I don't know how long
[40:25] it was that we had it but it was out
[40:27] there a while and it said coming soon
[40:30] now I would imagine that there were
[40:31] people that were going by that thought
[40:35] they would have been in the building by
[40:40] now I think most people thought we would
[40:43] actually be here before we
[40:46] did I want to ask the question today
[40:48] what did Jesus really mean when he said
[40:50] behold I come
[40:52] quickly when I was a teenager I was I
[40:55] was drawn to the Book of Revelations I I
[40:57] I read that book more than any other
[41:00] book in the Bible and I was just I was
[41:02] raised in
[41:04] a uh a a a a church and and they didn't
[41:08] really get into the the whole word and
[41:12] so I would read this book and I'll tell
[41:14] you this book used to scare me it really
[41:17] scared me if I could say it like this it
[41:20] it kind of put the fear of God in Me it
[41:24] helped me to think am I really ready to
[41:26] meet this God who's coming with such
[41:35] Vengeance I was in a helpless State I
[41:39] knew there was a Creator I
[41:42] prayed I could think he was a good God
[41:45] and that I was
[41:47] saved but I really didn't have that
[41:49] Blessed Assurance
[41:51] inside I would spend hours trying to
[41:54] make sense of the Book of Revelations
[41:58] and I I couldn't be sure what it all
[42:01] meant but I knew something inside of me
[42:04] just knew that it was
[42:06] true there was something inside
[42:09] that connected that the Bible was
[42:12] true I went to many churches and I Heard
[42:15] lots of men's
[42:17] ideas like John must have eaten some bad
[42:21] food before he went to bed that night
[42:23] before he when he wrote this or that he
[42:26] he had some bad dream and he was just
[42:29] expressing this bad
[42:32] dream but I want to share something with
[42:34] you today I actually found something
[42:36] that was missing in the
[42:40] Bible and that's your
[42:44] opinion your opinion my
[42:47] opinion our opinions don't mean anything
[42:49] to God and they shouldn't mean anything
[42:52] to one
[42:54] another If any man shall add unto the
[42:57] things these things God shall add unto
[43:00] him the plagues that are written in the
[43:02] book we certainly don't want to add our
[43:05] ideas even to our
[43:08] children we want to stay right with the
[43:10] words as if we don't know say I don't
[43:13] know and and we don't want to ignore
[43:17] some things that are scary or or that
[43:20] Jesus said that boy nobody preaches
[43:22] about that we don't want to ignore
[43:24] that because that's part of God's word
[43:29] right God never intended us to search
[43:33] out the truth by other men's opinions to
[43:37] know God through other men's opinions
[43:40] Jesus taught the people in John chapter
[43:42] 5 verse 39 search the scriptures for in
[43:46] them you think you have eternal life and
[43:49] they are they which testify of me the
[43:53] scriptures are the only thing that
[43:55] anyone has in this world to know
[43:58] what truth is and what God really
[44:01] is for
[44:04] example have you ever wondered and I'm
[44:07] sure you have have you ever wondered how
[44:10] is God really going to judge everybody
[44:12] what's he G to judge Everybody
[44:14] by if he judges the whole world by the
[44:18] Catholic church then all the Protestants
[44:20] are
[44:21] lost if he judges the the whole world by
[44:26] uh the protest the Catholic if he judges
[44:28] the whole world by the the methodists by
[44:31] the Lutheran by the Baptists by the
[44:36] Pentecostals and I'm sure we've all
[44:38] wondered what's God really how's he
[44:40] gonna judge us because we all got to
[44:41] face that day right the Bible says it's
[44:44] appointed unto men once to die and then
[44:46] the
[44:51] judgment is he going to put our Good
[44:53] Deeds on one side of the scale and our
[44:55] bad Deeds on the other side just kind of
[44:57] to balance it
[45:02] out is he going to choose the church
[45:04] with the most
[45:07] members how is he going to judge
[45:10] us well we could get our phone out and
[45:13] do a Google
[45:16] search or we could read about some
[45:19] famous author or or or or listen to some
[45:23] scholar and see what he
[45:25] said oh or we can take the words that
[45:29] Jesus said and search the
[45:32] scriptures they tell us John CH 12: 46
[45:37] John 12: 46 Jesus said I am come a light
[45:41] into the world and whosoever believeth
[45:44] on me should not abide in
[45:47] darkness and if any man hear my words
[45:49] and believe
[45:51] not I judge him
[45:54] not those are be comforting words
[45:57] if that was the end of the
[46:00] message Jesus for I came not to judge
[46:03] the world but to save the world that's
[46:06] the purpose of his first
[46:10] coming he that rejecteth me and
[46:13] receiveth not my words hath one that
[46:16] judgeth him the word that I have spoken
[46:21] the same shall judge him in the last
[46:25] day so even though God's not down here
[46:29] pointing fingers and judging people and
[46:31] and and and condemning people to hell
[46:34] that's not his motive his motive was to
[46:36] come and save us to provide a way for us
[46:38] to get there yet his word is true and
[46:41] one day we'll have to come to
[46:43] accountability with this word not a
[46:45] different word not with somebody's
[46:47] opinion about the word not not works not
[46:50] Deeds but exactly what the Bible
[46:55] says and so I say what any question you
[46:58] have about life the answer is in the
[47:02] word of
[47:04] God opinions carry very little
[47:07] weight certainly it would be foolish for
[47:09] a man to rest his soul on the opinion of
[47:13] another
[47:14] man Even his own opinion that's probably
[47:16] the most dangerous is our own
[47:18] opinion because we have so much
[47:20] confidence in our
[47:24] opinion the problem is even when we're
[47:27] wrong when we find out we're wrong about
[47:28] our opinion we still got the same amount
[47:30] of confidence in our opinions like we
[47:33] don't
[47:34] learn that our opinion is just an
[47:36] opinion like anybody else's
[47:40] opinion the only thing that really
[47:42] matters is God's word and it's more than
[47:45] just an
[47:46] opinion Jesus said three times in the
[47:49] Bible Heaven and Earth shall pass away
[47:51] but my words shall never pass
[47:55] away I think that was important for us
[47:59] to know that God's word is not just
[48:01] another opinion it's an
[48:04] absolute the Bible says my word shall
[48:06] not return unto me void but it shall
[48:09] accomplish that which I please have you
[48:11] ever met anybody that if they said
[48:14] something you couldn't count on
[48:17] it and some people more than
[48:21] others well you can count on God's word
[48:24] it is never ever ever never ever
[48:28] failed and it can't fail because God
[48:31] can't fail he is the only thing that's
[48:33] perfect that's why we all can be in one
[48:36] mind in one Accord and agreeing with our
[48:39] Lord Jesus
[48:42] Christ so what did Jesus mean when he
[48:45] said surely I come
[48:48] quickly just as this building wasn't
[48:51] ready to move
[48:53] in uh when before we did Jesus will not
[48:57] return until every member of the body is
[49:01] ready to go
[49:04] home this church building had to get
[49:08] things up to cold before we could move
[49:10] in and the Church of the Living God
[49:15] needs to get things up to God's Bible
[49:19] cold before it can go
[49:23] home and that's the absolute
[49:28] we uh had rules and regulations I just
[49:33] want to say God bless the Tyrone
[49:36] Township who can who's here from the
[49:39] Tyrone Township just stand for just a
[49:41] second just you two I just want to say
[49:44] God bless you and to all the group there
[49:47] that takes care of our little Township
[49:50] they it's it's almost a thankless job
[49:54] because they're constantly dealing with
[49:55] problems
[49:57] trying to keep people happy they have to
[49:59] stay with the rules and people don't
[50:01] like the rules and so we're very
[50:03] grateful for them and grateful that
[50:07] they've allowed us to have this little
[50:08] church
[50:09] here but when we had to bring things up
[50:13] to cold here and we we thought we were
[50:17] done and and we got an inspector to come
[50:20] out and give us an inspection and he
[50:23] said well this needs to be changed and
[50:26] this this needs to be changed and this
[50:27] isn't right and no matter how bad I
[50:31] wanted to move in I couldn't because it
[50:34] wasn't up the cold
[50:35] yet and I had to fix those
[50:38] things and no matter how bad we want to
[50:41] go to heaven no matter how bad we we
[50:43] think we're ready if this code book says
[50:45] there's something in our lives that
[50:47] needs to get in order we need to get it
[50:49] in
[50:50] order because we can't go home before
[50:55] them Jesus said in Matthew
[50:59] 22:44 therefore be ye also ready for in
[51:02] such an hour as you think not the son of
[51:05] man
[51:09] cometh he's not going
[51:14] to tell everybody ahead of time on the
[51:18] news Fox News
[51:20] CNN the newspapers the radio our our
[51:24] favorite musicians our our favorite
[51:27] movie stars our our neighbors our mom
[51:30] and
[51:33] dad
[51:35] no he gives man a
[51:38] chance speaks to their
[51:42] heart gives them a chance to get
[51:44] ready and it's at that point that we
[51:47] make a
[51:48] choice We Can Make A wise
[51:51] choice and get ready stay
[51:54] ready or we can take our own opinion
[51:56] over the word of
[51:59] God and say well I still got
[52:04] time I would imagine there are quite a
[52:07] few people began to lose interest about
[52:10] when we were going to open because they
[52:12] thought when you put a sign up opening
[52:14] soon it usually happens pretty
[52:20] quick maybe they were
[52:22] thinking well it's they're just they're
[52:26] taking so long it just lose
[52:28] interest like a lot of people wondering
[52:31] when Jesus is going to
[52:34] return or it didn't seem like very much
[52:37] progress was being done from the outside
[52:40] maybe some thought that they changed
[52:42] their mind something went
[52:44] wrong maybe some thought that they
[52:47] actually delayed their
[52:50] coming just like they thought about the
[52:53] return of
[52:54] Jesus second Peter chapter 3 vers vers
[52:57] one this Second Epistle beloved I write
[53:00] unto you in both which I stir up your
[53:03] pure Minds by way of
[53:05] remembrance that ye may be mindful of
[53:08] The Words which were
[53:10] spoken before by the holy prophets and
[53:14] of The Commandments of us the Apostles
[53:17] of our Lord and savior knowing this
[53:20] first that there shall come in the last
[53:22] days
[53:24] scoffers walking after their own
[53:27] desires and saying where is the promise
[53:31] of his
[53:33] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[53:36] all things continue as they were from
[53:39] the beginning of the creation and I just
[53:43] wonder how many people in this world
[53:45] have read in the Bible where Jesus said
[53:47] behold I come
[53:50] quickly and they thought everything has
[53:53] remained the same since he said those
[53:55] words
[54:00] where is
[54:01] he surely I come quickly where is he the
[54:05] sign has been out
[54:07] there it's exactly where God ordained it
[54:10] to
[54:11] be Jesus said in Matthew
[54:14] 24:36 but of that day and hour knoweth
[54:18] no man not even the angels in heaven but
[54:21] my father only no man knows just God
[54:28] can you imagine if he would have told
[54:30] the
[54:31] angels all the Angels when he was going
[54:33] to come at the be at the
[54:35] beginning before the before the before a
[54:38] third of the Angels
[54:40] fell what they would have done with that
[54:44] information there's a reason that God
[54:46] had held on to
[54:48] it and he don't need to tell me come on
[54:52] and he don't need to tell
[54:54] you but we do need to receive the
[54:56] message he's coming and be ready amen
[54:59] that's all that matters that our heart
[55:01] wants to be ready that we put forth
[55:02] effort we search the scriptures Lord
[55:04] what do I need to do to be ready because
[55:06] it's contained in the scriptures all
[55:08] that we need to do to be
[55:10] ready I don't want us I wouldn't want I
[55:13] don't advise anybody to listen to a
[55:17] man his opinion to tell you what you
[55:19] need to do to get ready don't do
[55:22] that that's just a man's opinion
[55:27] you make sure that what's being spoken
[55:30] to you is
[55:32] scriptural read it for yourself in the
[55:43] Bible I remember when I was young
[55:47] playing hide-and
[55:51] seek and those that had to whose turn it
[55:54] was to find those that were hiding
[55:58] they would say ready or not here I
[56:02] come but Jesus is coming ready or
[56:07] not he's coming for those who are
[56:10] ready that puts a responsibility on us
[56:13] you just can't be sitting out
[56:16] there everybody's trying to hide and
[56:19] you're just out there well
[56:20] whatever because soon as he comes out
[56:23] and says ready or not and he opens his
[56:24] eyes you're going to be there and you're
[56:25] going to get caught
[56:27] it's a responsibility of all of us to be
[56:32] ready Oh Brother John how do I know if
[56:35] I'm
[56:36] ready what do I do where do I go what do
[56:38] I say how can I be assured this is the
[56:42] only book you
[56:44] need you spend time
[56:47] praying say God help me to understand
[56:51] because this God he hid this from the
[56:54] wise and prudent
[56:57] right but he has such a heart for those
[56:59] that love him he reveals it to just
[57:04] babes so if your heart is Lord I just
[57:06] want to
[57:09] know I just want to be
[57:11] pleasing not some some
[57:20] news but I don't want to miss it
[57:25] Lord the Bible Code tells us that God
[57:28] cannot
[57:29] lie God doesn't speak things halfhazard
[57:32] or just to get a laugh out of
[57:35] somebody or just vainly say things if
[57:39] God has spoken something you can Bank on
[57:42] it it's absolutely 100% true God's word
[57:47] is
[57:49] infallible it's the only book The Only
[57:52] book that's infallible
[57:59] it's the only thing in this corrupted
[58:01] society that man can count
[58:04] on the world is full of Darkness
[58:07] today it's falling apart very
[58:10] fast they're always saying new and
[58:13] improved
[58:15] products even if they knew and improved
[58:18] it last year they knew improved it
[58:22] again they want they want you to buy it
[58:24] because it's new and improved
[58:28] now they're saying they they have a new
[58:30] and improved government that they want
[58:31] to give
[58:33] us look at the News That's presented to
[58:37] us whatever news that we heard last
[58:40] month they're giving us new news this
[58:44] month which contradicts the news that
[58:47] they had last month by the
[58:52] way yet every time they're presenting it
[58:54] they're presenting it in such a way that
[58:56] it's
[58:57] facts that they couldn't be
[59:01] wrong they're ignoring the fact that
[59:03] they're always changing the
[59:06] facts and we get so warped in our
[59:08] thinking to think this is the way life
[59:11] is and you can never
[59:13] know and so when you read the Bible you
[59:15] go to church or you're you're listening
[59:17] to some sermon you get the same thing
[59:19] well maybe this is or maybe this
[59:23] isn't when we're hearing the word of God
[59:26] it is absolutely the
[59:28] truth when you're hearing an opinion
[59:31] about the word then you got to back up
[59:33] then you got to
[59:36] watch but we should all have such a
[59:39] confidence in the word of God God wants
[59:41] us to believe in him to know that he's
[59:44] able to protect his own word so you
[59:47] could have a way to make
[59:49] it you shall know the truth Jesus said
[59:52] and the truth shall make you free
[59:59] you can't count on what the you hear in
[1:00:01] the world you can't count on what the
[1:00:04] government's doing more and more PE the
[1:00:07] world is doubting the
[1:00:11] government they're questioning the FBI
[1:00:13] the CIA the CDC the FDA or any of man's
[1:00:18] alphabets because it's all
[1:00:22] man-made we don't want what the world is
[1:00:25] profing assigned to
[1:00:28] us it just brings confusion
[1:00:32] depression it doesn't help us at all
[1:00:35] doesn't give us any comfort any
[1:00:37] confidence we need God's true prophecy
[1:00:41] right here this is what we need we need
[1:00:44] the good
[1:00:46] news it's God's c book and it's the
[1:00:49] only
[1:00:51] book that God will go
[1:00:54] by the only one that God goes by is his
[1:00:58] word every he said every man's a
[1:01:04] liar turn with me if you would to Second
[1:01:06] Peter chapter 1 verse 19 second Peter
[1:01:09] chapter 1 vers 19 we have also a more
[1:01:15] sure word of
[1:01:18] Prophecy where unto you do well that you
[1:01:22] take
[1:01:23] heat as unto a light that shineth in a
[1:01:28] dark place and when you walk into a room
[1:01:31] it's dark you go for that light switch
[1:01:35] why because you don't want to stumble
[1:01:37] you don't want to run into
[1:01:39] something and when that light comes on
[1:01:41] behold you can see but we have a a more
[1:01:45] sure word of Prophecy right here this is
[1:01:49] the light for our
[1:01:52] lives for whatever is going on in our
[1:01:54] personal lives this is the
[1:01:59] light and the more that we we put God
[1:02:03] first in our
[1:02:05] life who cares about what do you think I
[1:02:08] got going in my life and what do you
[1:02:09] think I should do and and what do you
[1:02:11] think it does not
[1:02:14] matter trust God that he will lead and
[1:02:17] guide you acknowledge the Lord in all
[1:02:19] the ways and he shall direct thy paths
[1:02:27] until the day Dawn and the day star
[1:02:30] arise in your hearts knowing this first
[1:02:36] first that no Prophecy of the scriptures
[1:02:40] is of any private interpretation or
[1:02:44] opinion it doesn't matter what I
[1:02:50] think and I'm glad it says knowing this
[1:02:53] first let's we got to have a good
[1:02:55] foundation
[1:02:57] right who would want to go to a church
[1:03:00] that says you don't have to do anything
[1:03:02] and you're going to
[1:03:04] heaven that church would be full
[1:03:07] people the the people who are not
[1:03:10] thinking straight that
[1:03:14] is no we need a
[1:03:18] foundation and the foundation is we have
[1:03:21] no business giving our own
[1:03:22] interpretation to the word of God
[1:03:27] no
[1:03:29] opinion scripture interprets
[1:03:32] scripture you ever been reading
[1:03:35] instructions on how to put something
[1:03:38] together and if you're like me most of
[1:03:40] the time you just want to show you can
[1:03:42] do it without the
[1:03:45] instructions well I put on many
[1:03:47] falsehoods in my life and I put one on
[1:03:49] the other
[1:03:51] day and I couldn't figure out what this
[1:03:54] thing goes to
[1:03:58] and I had to go back to the instructions
[1:04:01] what good would it do to call Jason
[1:04:03] who's never seen
[1:04:05] it or ask Mark who's never put one
[1:04:08] together or ask my
[1:04:13] wife it doesn't
[1:04:15] matter what I think the scripture
[1:04:19] says now I know it may sound like boy
[1:04:22] brother John why would I want to come
[1:04:24] here you're talking like that because
[1:04:26] what I'm trying to get you to do is
[1:04:28] understand that this church is not built
[1:04:30] on a
[1:04:33] man if they can't be backed up by the
[1:04:37] scriptures we don't want nothing to do
[1:04:39] with
[1:04:40] it we got to stay with the cold book The
[1:04:43] the instructions of how to build the
[1:04:46] Statue of a perfect
[1:04:48] man we got to build properly the the
[1:04:50] foundation here the knowing this
[1:04:54] first that we can't inject our
[1:04:57] ideas to what the board says for the
[1:05:00] prophecy came not in Old Time by the
[1:05:04] will of a
[1:05:06] man how many times you heard this in
[1:05:09] life oh man just wrote
[1:05:14] that for the prophecy came not in Old
[1:05:18] Time by the will of man but holy men of
[1:05:21] God spake as they were moved by the Holy
[1:05:26] Ghost moved how many want God to move
[1:05:29] you I want God to move in my life I want
[1:05:32] God to direct my life I want God to
[1:05:34] supply my needs I want God to move in my
[1:05:38] life if God's going to move in my life I
[1:05:41] got to get out of the way I got to die
[1:05:43] out to my thinking and and doing things
[1:05:45] what I think because God ain't going to
[1:05:48] share his glory with me that's right
[1:05:50] amen is that going to share his glory
[1:05:52] with any of us
[1:05:56] so the key to
[1:05:58] having the Holy Ghost move in US Direct
[1:06:02] our life is to Humble ourselves before
[1:06:05] him die out and say Lord open my eyes
[1:06:09] that I can see show me the way this book
[1:06:13] called the Bible is not
[1:06:18] outdated it is up to
[1:06:22] date his coming is not old news
[1:06:27] his coming is going to happen very
[1:06:30] soon surely I come
[1:06:33] quickly he's coming quickly the
[1:06:37] foundation of this church is the
[1:06:39] Bible from cover to
[1:06:43] cover not some opinion about the Bible
[1:06:47] but exactly the
[1:06:49] Bible the foundation of Our
[1:06:51] Lives ought to be the same
[1:06:56] from cover to cover and not our
[1:07:00] opinion it's so dangerous when we inject
[1:07:02] our
[1:07:04] opinion and I'll tell you how terrible
[1:07:07] our first nature is we're born always
[1:07:10] thinking we're
[1:07:13] right born from our
[1:07:16] parents and when our parents
[1:07:18] say don't do that that'll hurt
[1:07:22] you well our opinion is much better
[1:07:26] and much more
[1:07:29] accurate and if we want another cookie
[1:07:32] we know we're
[1:07:34] right and you know what we'll put our
[1:07:36] deceiving
[1:07:38] deceptive abilities to
[1:07:40] work and wait till Mom goes in the other
[1:07:43] room and then we'll get what we got to
[1:07:46] get because we think we're right
[1:07:56] if we could have no
[1:08:00] confidence in what we think about the
[1:08:03] word in our opinions and we could put
[1:08:07] all our confidence that God will show us
[1:08:10] clearly and plainly those things that we
[1:08:12] do not
[1:08:14] understand it would gain so much more in
[1:08:20] Christ now I'm not saying God has not
[1:08:23] revealed anything to us because he has
[1:08:27] the very purpose that you're here today
[1:08:28] is that you believe in
[1:08:32] God but there's so many things that have
[1:08:35] not yet been revealed to
[1:08:38] us and sometimes I know the tendency is
[1:08:42] when we only hear part of the story we
[1:08:44] want to interpret the rest of the
[1:08:47] part that's a dangerous
[1:08:49] thing what we need to do is continue to
[1:08:52] search the scriptures continue to pray
[1:08:54] continue to come to church continue to
[1:08:56] seek out the
[1:08:58] truth because Jesus said You shall
[1:09:01] search me you shall seek me and find me
[1:09:04] when you search for me with all of your
[1:09:06] heart he just looking for the
[1:09:09] heart he get your
[1:09:11] heart boy you got
[1:09:15] Jesus that's the mate right there it's
[1:09:18] your heart and his
[1:09:20] heart not long ago we just we preached
[1:09:23] on a God just wanted a family
[1:09:26] he wants a
[1:09:31] family this book is the only book that
[1:09:34] tells us who we are where we came from
[1:09:37] and where we're going it's the only book
[1:09:40] that tells us the hour We're living here
[1:09:42] in 2021 what's supposed to be
[1:09:45] happening this book called the Bible is
[1:09:49] God's good news to the
[1:09:52] world it shines a light no no matter
[1:09:55] what hour we're living in that's the
[1:09:57] beautiful thing whether it's through the
[1:09:58] Dark Ages whether it's in the 18th
[1:10:00] century the the 20th century now this
[1:10:04] book tells us where we're
[1:10:10] at Paul speaking prophetically to
[1:10:12] Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter 3 verse one
[1:10:16] about the the days that we're we're
[1:10:18] living in
[1:10:21] today said this know also that in the
[1:10:24] last last days how many thinks were in
[1:10:27] last days let me see your
[1:10:30] hands keep them up there keep them up
[1:10:32] there okay praise the Lord so we're all
[1:10:35] on the same page here we're in the last
[1:10:38] days he describes the last days as
[1:10:42] perilous
[1:10:43] times perilous
[1:10:47] times Paul doesn't describe anything
[1:10:51] about a fallen
[1:10:53] economy disasters
[1:10:56] global warming deadly strains of viruses
[1:10:59] or a new world
[1:11:01] order but yet he calls it perilous
[1:11:06] times he describes it as a Godless
[1:11:10] spiritual
[1:11:11] condition that's what he describes this
[1:11:13] verse two for men shall be
[1:11:16] lovers of their own
[1:11:20] selves
[1:11:21] Covetous
[1:11:23] bolsters proud
[1:11:26] blasphemies disobedient to parents
[1:11:28] unthankful you ever seen a time where
[1:11:30] people are so
[1:11:32] unthankful Unholy without natural
[1:11:34] affection truth Breakers false
[1:11:37] accusers man you can't turn on the news
[1:11:40] without hearing one station criticize
[1:11:43] another
[1:11:45] station incontinent fears despisers of
[1:11:49] those that are
[1:11:52] good boy there was such a hatred
[1:11:56] I don't want to get into you know you
[1:11:58] live in the world but you see this
[1:12:01] Spirit the spirit of this all around us
[1:12:03] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[1:12:06] pleasure more than lovers of God still
[1:12:09] love God I love pleasure
[1:12:12] more these are spiritual signs of his
[1:12:16] coming as it was in the days of Noah as
[1:12:20] it was in the days of lot we are in that
[1:12:22] hour
[1:12:25] this is the condition that the church
[1:12:27] world has gotten
[1:12:29] into they have kick God right out of the
[1:12:32] church he's no
[1:12:36] longer no longer welcomed in the church
[1:12:39] think about that how can a church kick
[1:12:42] out God when you kick the word out you
[1:12:46] kick God
[1:12:47] out but they think he's still there but
[1:12:50] he's not so what is he doing he's
[1:12:53] knocking on man's
[1:12:56] heart an individual Church Affair if I
[1:12:59] could say it like
[1:13:02] that and he wants to come in but you
[1:13:05] know what if Jesus comes in he's
[1:13:08] bringing his word with
[1:13:19] him they've kicked out God and they've
[1:13:22] replaced it with man's opinion
[1:13:26] they've replaced it with
[1:13:28] entertainment they've replaced it with
[1:13:30] just come to church and feel
[1:13:34] good what about what's on God's
[1:13:40] heart they've replaced the leadership of
[1:13:43] the Holy Ghost with the intellectualism
[1:13:46] of
[1:13:49] man having Church Without God being the
[1:13:53] head of the church
[1:13:58] he said surely I come
[1:14:01] quickly God is the head of his
[1:14:03] church and not
[1:14:05] man let's drop down to verse 13 but evil
[1:14:09] men in the last days and seducers
[1:14:12] they're going to wax worse and worse
[1:14:15] deceiving and being deceived now doesn't
[1:14:17] that the way that you feel in the in the
[1:14:19] world when you're listening to news
[1:14:21] right there nobody can trust anybody
[1:14:27] for the life of me I don't understand
[1:14:29] why we still watch the stuff why we're
[1:14:33] still listen toing it as if we're going
[1:14:35] to be able to make sense of
[1:14:38] it but it's not just happening in the
[1:14:40] world it's happening in the church world
[1:14:43] right The Same Spirit comes in because
[1:14:46] the devil what's the the goal of the
[1:14:49] devil to keep man from going to heaven
[1:14:52] that's it what's the what's the goal of
[1:14:55] God to to make a way that men would be
[1:14:59] saved just keeping it
[1:15:05] simple the devil's always
[1:15:08] telling man oh you don't have to follow
[1:15:11] all of God's word oh it's it's okay to
[1:15:15] partake of the tree of knowledge of
[1:15:17] goodness you're going to be just like
[1:15:18] God you're going to know
[1:15:23] everything but evil men and seduce
[1:15:25] yourself wax worse and worse deceiving
[1:15:26] and being deceived but continue in the
[1:15:29] things which thou has
[1:15:32] learned and has been assured of knowing
[1:15:36] of whom thou has learned them and that
[1:15:38] from a child thou has known the holy
[1:15:43] scriptures which are able to make thee
[1:15:46] wise unto salvation through faith in
[1:15:50] Jesus Christ we've got to believe in the
[1:15:52] scriptures that they are the absolute
[1:15:55] our
[1:15:56] Salvation all scripture all scripture is
[1:16:01] given by the inspiration of God and is
[1:16:05] profitable for Doctrine for Repro for
[1:16:08] correction for instruction in
[1:16:12] righteousness that the man of God may be
[1:16:14] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[1:16:18] good
[1:16:19] works amen did not Jesus say that he's
[1:16:22] coming quickly and his reward is with
[1:16:24] him to give every man according to his
[1:16:26] works well if we follow this word and
[1:16:29] our works become this word I believe you
[1:16:32] we have a great reward
[1:16:36] amen surely I come quickly God cannot
[1:16:40] lie he's coming
[1:16:42] soon when we leave today I want to
[1:16:45] encourage you to search the scriptures
[1:16:48] to continue to search the
[1:16:52] scriptures there's biblical signs
[1:16:56] all around us that we're living in the
[1:16:58] hour of his
[1:17:00] return 1 Thessalonians chapter 4:1
[1:17:04] 16 for the Lord himself shall descend
[1:17:07] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[1:17:09] of the Archangel with the Trump of God
[1:17:11] and the dead shall rise first the dead
[1:17:14] in Christ shall rise first then we which
[1:17:17] are alive and
[1:17:20] remain shall be caught up together with
[1:17:23] them in the clouds
[1:17:25] to meet the Lord in the air and so shall
[1:17:29] we ever be with the
[1:17:32] Lord I love these the scriptures here
[1:17:36] wherefore wherefore Comfort one another
[1:17:41] with these words
[1:17:43] amen surely I come quickly these words
[1:17:47] should bring a comfort to
[1:17:49] us the holy
[1:17:52] spirit is saying
[1:17:58] coming but who else is saying coming the
[1:18:03] bride something inside God's people
[1:18:06] wants Jesus to come I mean let's just
[1:18:08] face it we're a natural being and we're
[1:18:10] a spiritual
[1:18:12] being we're a spiritual being that lives
[1:18:14] in a body is it really the proper way of
[1:18:16] saying it part of us doesn't want Jesus
[1:18:20] to come right
[1:18:22] now because of XY
[1:18:30] but the spiritual part of us the part
[1:18:34] that's ready to meet Jesus that
[1:18:36] submitted their life completely to
[1:18:39] him wants Jesus to come
[1:18:42] quickly in fact they're sighing and
[1:18:44] crying for the Abominations that are
[1:18:46] done in the
[1:18:49] city you just can't watch anything on TV
[1:18:53] without seeing something
[1:18:57] terrible
[1:18:59] something
[1:19:02] perverted it's no longer I Love
[1:19:07] Lucy it's I love have a good
[1:19:11] one doesn't
[1:19:14] matter but the
[1:19:16] bride is wanting to
[1:19:21] celebrate that he's coming soon
[1:19:24] Revelations 19:7 we're closing here let
[1:19:27] us be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[1:19:31] him for the marriage of the Lamb has
[1:19:32] come and his wife have made herself
[1:19:36] ready there's a celebration amen it's
[1:19:40] it's a it's a spiritual or an invisible
[1:19:44] Union taking place with the bride of
[1:19:46] Christ and Jesus
[1:19:50] himself now we're going to meet
[1:19:53] corporately in the the Bible says but
[1:19:56] before that happens the spirit that's
[1:20:00] inside man and the spirit of God are
[1:20:05] meeting and the bride's character is
[1:20:08] becoming more like Jesus all the
[1:20:11] time we're just not looking for a day
[1:20:14] that's going to happen and hope we make
[1:20:15] the date but each day that bride is
[1:20:18] looking for an opportunity that they
[1:20:19] could display more of the character of
[1:20:21] Jesus Christ
[1:20:25] we don't just believe in a day that
[1:20:28] we'll be caught up together we believe
[1:20:30] in in what it takes to get ready for
[1:20:32] that
[1:20:38] day may the Lord Jesus bless you let's
[1:20:42] stand
[1:20:43] together he which testify these things
[1:20:46] surely I come quickly even so come Lord
[1:20:50] Jesus and he says the grace of the Lord
[1:20:53] Jesus Christ be be with you all how many
[1:20:57] desire the grace of our Lord Jesus
[1:20:59] Christ amen he's coming
[1:21:04] soon very
[1:21:07] soon don't let any other
[1:21:12] Spirit try to tell you that he's not or
[1:21:17] that you know more than what the word
[1:21:19] says the word is our absolute we may not
[1:21:23] be able to
[1:21:25] interpret it
[1:21:26] properly
[1:21:28] right because the word is of no private
[1:21:33] interpretation but the god interprets
[1:21:36] his word by bringing it to
[1:21:39] pass when he brings it to pass that is
[1:21:42] the perfect interpretation of the word
