[33:37] stand here today white as snow. Lord,
[33:41] for Lord, though our sins were as
[33:44] scarlet, Lord, you are the one that
[33:46] makes us clean and whole again. And
[33:48] Lord, by your grace, we all can stand
[33:51] here as people that have been washed by
[33:54] the precious blood of the lamb today.
[33:56] God, we thank you that that power is
[33:58] just as strong as the day that it was
[34:00] shed at Calvary. Lord, that we could
[34:02] bathe in it today and that we be washed
[34:04] in it today. We could stand here and
[34:07] just have faith in you, Lord. Oh God,
[34:10] come now. Just meet the needs in our
[34:12] midst. We worship you and we thank you
[34:14] for these things in Jesus name. Amen.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me if you would to the
[34:21] book of St. John chapter 15 and and also
[34:24] Philippians chapter 4.
[34:27] Last service we had three scripture
[34:29] readings. This service we have two. As
[34:32] you're turning, we just want to welcome
[34:35] Sister Cynthia Seraniano
[34:38] with us here today. Um what a blessing.
[34:42] We miss brother
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Roel.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Actually, I was you had sent a a clip to
[34:50] me. Um,
[34:53] and I was looking for it because I
[34:54] wanted to play play part of that here
[34:56] and for some reason it wasn't on my
[34:58] phone. So, um, I waited too long to
[35:01] look. But, um, how would you like to
[35:05] just say praise the Lord, sister?
[35:08] [Laughter]
[35:11] You can say more if you'd like. I should
[35:14] have like warned you I was going to call
[35:15] on you.
[35:18] It's a a great blessing to have you and
[35:20] a great honor to have you with us. Amen.
[35:24] And
[35:26] let's um
[35:28] just uh read two scriptures here. Um the
[35:33] first one is in um St. John chapter 15
[35:38] verse number five.
[35:43] Jesus speaking, saying, "I am the vine,
[35:46] ye are the branches.
[35:49] He that abideth in me and I in him, the
[35:51] same bringeth forth much fruit.
[35:55] For without me, you can do nothing."
[36:00] &gt;&gt; And then Philippians chapter
[36:04] 4 verse 19, no verse 13.
[36:09] Uh Paul reading to the Philippian
[36:11] church. I can do all things through
[36:14] Christ which strengthenth me.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just if we could um look to
[36:21] the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, we
[36:24] thank you for thy word. Thy words are
[36:27] spirit and they are life. And we've come
[36:30] to your house today to receive the
[36:34] living word into our lives, Lord, and to
[36:38] to be drawn closer to you and to to know
[36:43] you by experience a little bit more than
[36:46] when we came. Father, I pray that you
[36:50] would bless each one that has made it
[36:52] out to the service today. May your
[36:55] anointing continue to be with them, be
[36:57] upon them. Give them ears to hear. Lord,
[37:01] take this unworthy servant of yours,
[37:03] Lord, and bless these lips that they
[37:05] would speak the words of life to each of
[37:08] those ears. We pray that you'd be with
[37:11] those that are not able to be here
[37:13] today, but are uh afflicted by some way.
[37:18] Just ask that your Holy Spirit would
[37:20] supply the need that is needed for their
[37:23] bodies, Lord. and comfort them and help
[37:25] them. We commit the furtherance of this
[37:28] service and trust you for your
[37:30] anointing. Now we pray in Jesus Christ's
[37:32] name. Amen. And God bless you. May be
[37:36] seated. We want to entitle this uh needy
[37:40] people.
[37:43] We are needy people. We will always be
[37:46] needy people.
[37:49] And for a subject we want to talk about
[37:51] we were never made to make it on our
[37:54] own.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; God has so arranged things in life that
[38:00] we are totally helpless without God.
[38:04] The Bible even tells us that a man at
[38:06] his very best is all vanity.
[38:10] So from our birth
[38:12] uh we have become very dependent on
[38:14] someone. take our every one of us that
[38:17] when we were born
[38:20] uh we didn't we weren't born and then
[38:22] just you know
[38:24] get over I'm taking over this is what I
[38:26] want to eat and this is what I want to
[38:27] do and this is where we're going.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; We were helpless if it wasn't for mom or
[38:33] the the dad or the the hospital or
[38:35] wherever we were. Uh we would be dead.
[38:40] I mean we we we totally were dependent
[38:43] on somebody. And as we grew up, even
[38:46] though we were 6 months old and we were
[38:48] still dependent
[38:50] and uh as a child um we we grow, we
[38:55] still are dependent and uh we have this
[38:59] age of 18 that the the children are
[39:03] dependent upon the parents until that
[39:05] age and then they're that on their own.
[39:08] Um
[39:10] uh so we can see naturally that um we
[39:14] were born needing someone to help us
[39:18] naturally all through life. It wasn't
[39:20] for our parents uh we would have turned
[39:23] out terrible.
[39:25] Right? So
[39:27] our parents helped us and u most of of
[39:32] us here feel that our our parents could
[39:35] have did a better job.
[39:39] But that's that's just normal, right?
[39:41] Because and then we have children and
[39:44] then we look at how they turn out and we
[39:46] see, well, I thought I did better than
[39:48] my parents. And
[39:51] we're just very needy of the Lord. So it
[39:53] is spiritually.
[39:56] We we cannot make it on our own without
[40:00] God.
[40:02] And we were never made to make it uh on
[40:05] our own without God. We were born in
[40:07] sin, shapen in iniquity. And we just
[40:10] want to read a few verses here in Psalms
[40:12] 51:5. Behold, I was shapen in iniquity.
[40:16] I was shapen in it. And in sin did my
[40:20] mother conceive me. Behold, thou desires
[40:24] truth in the inward parts, and in the
[40:26] hidden parts. Thou shalt make me to know
[40:28] wisdom. Purge me with hissup,
[40:32] and I shall be clean. Wash me, and I
[40:36] shall be wider than snow. We were never
[40:40] made to make it on our own.
[40:44] Make me to hear joy and gladness that
[40:46] the bones which thou has broken may
[40:48] rejoice. Hide thy hide thy face from my
[40:51] sin and blot out my iniquities. Create
[40:54] in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a
[40:58] right spirit within me. If it wasn't for
[41:01] God, where would we be? We were never
[41:04] made to make it on our own. Cast me not
[41:08] away from thy presence, and take not thy
[41:10] holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the
[41:13] joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with
[41:16] thy free spirit. Then I shall teach
[41:19] transgressors thy ways and sinners shall
[41:22] be converted unto thee.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says that by nature we
[41:29] were the children of wrath even as
[41:31] others.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 5653:6
[41:35] says all we like sheep have gone astray.
[41:41] We have turned everyone to his own way.
[41:46] And the Lord laid upon Jesus the
[41:49] iniquity of us all.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; We We're like sheep that need a
[41:57] shepherd.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; And if God had not put in in in uh come
[42:05] looking for us, we would still be lost
[42:09] &gt;&gt; because there was nothing in us to go
[42:11] looking for God.
[42:15] Even though there was a seed inside of
[42:17] us, it couldn't sprout out until God
[42:21] overshadowed us
[42:23] &gt;&gt; and and let us know the ego scream.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; We're totally dependent on God.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Doing our own thing, as we learn, is
[42:37] iniquity.
[42:39] Brother Brandham said in the message
[42:40] power of transformation he said iniquity
[42:43] is something that you know that you
[42:45] ought to do and you won't do it.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; You know better but you won't do it.
[42:52] It's iniquity. See
[42:55] knowing what you ought to do and you
[42:58] refuse to do it. So if the Bible says
[43:01] forsake not the summoning of yourselves
[43:02] together and all the more you see the
[43:04] day approaching and you do forsake the
[43:07] assembling of yourselves together,
[43:10] you are walking in iniquity. Now the the
[43:13] Bible tells us plainly that if you're
[43:15] going to do that that God's not going to
[43:17] hear your prayer.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; How many people are doing what they want
[43:20] to do thinking that God's still with
[43:23] them.
[43:25] So, we we learned a little bit that uh
[43:28] iniquity could be not worshiping God in
[43:32] church.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; And uh we we learned that uh Satan has
[43:38] literally filled the sanctuaries with
[43:41] iniquity.
[43:43] you know, people would rather be um come
[43:46] to church and be entertained
[43:49] &gt;&gt; and and and have enjoyment
[43:52] &gt;&gt; uh than to follow what the scripture
[43:54] says.
[43:57] So,
[43:59] no matter
[44:02] uh where we're at,
[44:05] we need God. We need God to cleanse us
[44:09] of our iniquity, cleanse us of our
[44:11] transgressions on a regular basis. By
[44:13] the way,
[44:15] &gt;&gt; amen. On a regular basis.
[44:17] Now, we have power
[44:20] to be transformed by the renewing of our
[44:22] mind.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; We just take a different attitude.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; The right mental attitude will change a
[44:29] lot of situations.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says it'll bring every
[44:32] divine promise of God to pass. So if
[44:35] we're predestinated, then we need to
[44:38] turn around our thinking if it's going
[44:41] the wrong way. Right? Second Timothy
[44:44] chapter 2 verse 19 sells tells us, "Let
[44:46] everyone that nameth the name of Christ
[44:50] depart from iniquity." So depart from
[44:55] the attitude of even though I know I
[45:00] I should do this, I don't want to do it.
[45:03] to turn away from that and say if that
[45:05] that's what I should do, I'm going to do
[45:07] it.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; And we have that power to change our
[45:12] situations by just changing our
[45:14] attitude.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 53:5 says he was wounded for our
[45:20] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[45:22] iniquities.
[45:23] So our our transgressions are the
[45:26] crossing of God's rules. Just crossing
[45:28] the boundaries of what God said,
[45:30] crossing the word. Whereas iniquity is
[45:34] is is not doing the things that we know
[45:36] we should do. And and the Bible says
[45:38] that the way of a transgressor is hard.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; You take somebody that's just constantly
[45:42] just ignoring the word and crossing the
[45:45] word. They're they're if you look at
[45:46] their life, they got a hard life.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; But Calvary paid the price for all of
[45:54] our sins.
[45:59] Now it does. It does
[46:03] uh pay the price for our future sins if
[46:08] we walk in the light,
[46:11] &gt;&gt; right? Because in the past, remember
[46:13] when we came to Christ the first time,
[46:14] we didn't even know the light.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; So, it wasn't required for us to walk
[46:18] in,
[46:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[46:20] &gt;&gt; We just accepted the blood of Calvary.
[46:22] But once we come to Christ, we learn the
[46:25] ways of God. He expects us to walk in
[46:27] them. And he says if it if we don't,
[46:30] it'd be better if you didn't know it
[46:33] &gt;&gt; than to know it and to walk away from
[46:35] it.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; So we walk in the light as he is in the
[46:38] light. Then the blood of Jesus Christ
[46:40] cleanses us from all of our sins.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; So see, the blood of Calvary still
[46:44] cleanses us, but God requires more for
[46:47] us.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; But we were never made to make it on our
[46:51] own. In in uh Genesis 3:15, I'm just
[46:56] going to quote it. This is the first
[46:57] prophecy about um Calvary here. And I
[47:01] will put enmity between thee and the
[47:02] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[47:04] and shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[47:06] bruise his heel. The only purpose I'm
[47:08] trying to say is God even telling us
[47:10] right after the fall, look, I'm going to
[47:12] make a way for you. You're not you were
[47:15] never made to make it on your own.
[47:18] Ephesians 2:4 says, "But God, who is
[47:21] rich in mercy for his great love,
[47:23] wherewith he loved us, even when we were
[47:25] dead in sins, he's quickened us together
[47:28] with Christ. By grace you are saved and
[47:30] have raised us up uh together and made
[47:35] us to sit together in heavenly places in
[47:37] Christ Jesus." God, that the Holy Spirit
[47:40] has has brought us to the place that we
[47:44] are in our life today.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen to that? I
[47:48] believe that 1 Peter chapter 2 24 says,
[47:51] "Who his own self bear our sins in his
[47:56] own body on the tree, that we being dead
[47:59] to sin should live unto righteousness by
[48:03] whose stripes we were healed. For we
[48:06] were as sheep going astray, doing our
[48:09] own thing, but are now
[48:13] returned unto the shepherd and bishop of
[48:17] our souls.
[48:19] So now we're returned because God drew
[48:23] us to where we needed to be. With the
[48:25] help of the Lord, we've returned back to
[48:27] God.
[48:29] We were never made to make it on our
[48:31] own. I'm just going to say this, but at
[48:33] any time we can go astray.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; If we don't abide in Christ, we don't
[48:39] abide in the vine, we don't walk in the
[48:42] spirit, if we don't stay where we need
[48:44] to stay, then we get off of God's
[48:48] territory
[48:49] and uh we can go astray.
[48:55] And all you got to do is take a look at
[48:58] yourself at any time that you saw
[49:01] yourself backsliding. We can't blame
[49:04] that on God,
[49:06] right?
[49:07] Because God said, "I'll never leave you.
[49:09] I'll never forsake you."
[49:11] &gt;&gt; So, it had to be us.
[49:14] So I the this whole thing of this
[49:16] message is to try to get us to be more
[49:18] dependent on the Lord to look to the
[49:21] Lord to be more dependent instead of
[49:23] feeling we can make it on our own.
[49:25] Romans 3:10 says it is written there is
[49:28] none righteous know not one. There is
[49:29] none that understandeth. There is none
[49:31] that seeketh after God. So God shown us
[49:35] here what happens if we don't seek after
[49:37] God.
[49:39] They are all gone out of the way. They
[49:41] are allto together become unprofitable.
[49:44] There is none that doeth good. Know not
[49:46] one. God is the only thing that can keep
[49:49] our life straight.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; The only thing
[49:53] he sent the Holy Ghost to keep our life
[49:55] straight.
[49:58] We were never made to make it on our
[50:00] own. God does not want us to lean to our
[50:03] own understanding. That's right. our own
[50:08] wisdom, our own intellect, our own
[50:11] knowledge to make it through life. He
[50:14] doesn't want that. He wants us to look
[50:17] to him. Proverbs 3:1, "My son, forget
[50:20] not my law, but let thine heart keep my
[50:23] commandments for length of days and long
[50:25] life and peace shall they add to thee.
[50:27] Uh let not mercy and truth forsake thee.
[50:31] Bind them about thy neck. Write them
[50:32] upon the tables of thy soul. Shalt thou
[50:34] find favor and good understand the sight
[50:37] of God in men? Trust in the Lord
[50:41] with all thine heart,
[50:44] and lean not to thine own understanding.
[50:48] See, we were created not to make it on
[50:51] our own. The very our very beings, we we
[50:56] we've the quicker that we just get away
[50:58] from trying to handle everything oursel
[51:00] and look to the word. What does the word
[51:01] say? do what the word says. The quicker
[51:03] we can do that, the quicker we can get
[51:05] on solid ground.
[51:09] In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he
[51:12] shall direct thy paths.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Be not wise in thine own eyes. Fear the
[51:18] Lord and depart from evil.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; See, God's saying,
[51:25] don't be wise how you look at yourself
[51:28] that you can handle the situation. You
[51:30] were not created to make it on your own.
[51:32] You go out there, you're going to see
[51:33] you're going to fail.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 59:19.
[51:38] I like this. The Bible says, "When the
[51:41] enemy shall come in like a flood, the
[51:44] spirit of the Lord shall raise up a
[51:46] standard against him."
[51:49] &gt;&gt; That's letting us know that we were not
[51:51] made to make it on our own. that God has
[51:55] set
[51:57] something there to fight against the
[51:59] devil.
[52:01] And we all have the devil come and beat
[52:03] us up, try to take us down, try to slip
[52:06] us up, banana peels, however you want to
[52:08] say it.
[52:11] But we are promised that God
[52:14] has provided something that we're not on
[52:17] our own.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; We don't have to feel alone. We're not
[52:20] left on our own. that God is there to
[52:23] make a way of whatever our situation is.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; James 4:6, "But he giveth more grace,
[52:30] wherefore he saith, God resists the
[52:33] proud, but giveth grace to the humble."
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Submit yourselves therefore to God.
[52:41] Resist the devil and he will flee from
[52:43] you. There it is. We were not made to
[52:45] make it on our own. Submit yourself
[52:47] therefore to God
[52:50] and then you'll have the strength to
[52:52] resist the devil and the promise is
[52:55] he'll flee.
[52:57] I mean we have all experienced that we
[53:00] want the devil off our back.
[53:03] Here it is. Draw nigh to God and he will
[53:06] draw nigh to thee.
[53:09] Draw nigh to God and he'll draw nigh to
[53:12] thee. Cleanse your hands you sinners.
[53:15] Purify your hearts, ye double-minded. Be
[53:17] afflicted, mourn, weep, and let your
[53:18] laughter be turned to mourning, your joy
[53:20] to heaviness. Humble yourselves
[53:24] in the sight of the Lord,
[53:27] and he shall lift you up.
[53:30] God so arranged it that we cannot make
[53:33] it through life without him.
[53:37] Can't be successful. Not if you're a
[53:40] child of God. If you're in the world,
[53:42] you can prosper.
[53:44] You can prosper as a sinner, but when
[53:46] you belong to the Lord,
[53:49] if you're not where you need to be,
[53:52] God has so arranged it that he'll get
[53:54] you to look to him.
[53:58] Ezekiel chapter 36.
[54:02] Ezekiel chapter 36 26. God has promised
[54:07] us something so we don't have to make it
[54:10] on our own. He says, "A new heart also I
[54:12] give you. A new spirit will I put within
[54:14] you, and I will take away the stony
[54:17] heart out of your flesh, and I will give
[54:18] you a heart of flesh."
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; And I will put my spirit within you, and
[54:23] I will cause you to walk in my statutes,
[54:25] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[54:27] them, and you shall dwell in the land
[54:29] that I give your fathers, and you shall
[54:31] be my people, and I will be your God.
[54:33] See, we were never made to make it on
[54:36] our own. God has already said, "I am
[54:39] going to give you my spirit. You're
[54:42] going to live with my spirit. You're
[54:43] going to live with my heart. My spirit.
[54:46] My heart. A heart of flesh. One that is
[54:49] pliable, but one that is tender. One
[54:51] that is not stubborn, rebellious,
[54:54] disobedient, not caring about the the
[54:56] right things. I'm going to give you a
[54:58] heart that cares. I'm going to give you
[55:00] a spirit that that says, "I want to
[55:02] please you, Lord. I will I want to do
[55:04] your commandments, Lord. I don't want to
[55:06] be a transgressor. I I I I don't want
[55:09] iniquities.
[55:13] God promised us himself.
[55:16] When he promised us the Holy Ghost, he
[55:19] promised us himself. Think about that.
[55:20] The God of creation living inside you.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; No wonder, Brother Brandon said,
[55:25] "There's enough power inside you to go
[55:27] create a world, live on it." It's God.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; It's God. John 14:15 says, "If you love
[55:35] me, keep my commandments."
[55:41] We were never made, understand this, we
[55:45] were we were never created, we were
[55:47] never made to keep God's commandments by
[55:50] ourself.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; We need God inside of us. Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; And I will pray the father. Verse 16.
[56:04] And he shall give you another comforter
[56:07] that he may abide with you forever. We
[56:10] were not made to make it on our own. He
[56:13] promises another comforter.
[56:17] God has created us to walk in his
[56:20] spirit. Not our spirit, not our ways,
[56:24] but his spirit.
[56:27] And we're to have another comforter. Oh,
[56:29] you talk about being fearless.
[56:32] You talk about not worrying about
[56:34] anything.
[56:36] You talk about let the bombs let let
[56:38] anything happen that's going to happen.
[56:40] If you got the comforter, you're okay.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; St. John 14 verse 26. St. John 14:26.
[56:48] But the comforter, which is the Holy
[56:52] Ghost,
[56:55] it's the same thing. The comfort of the
[56:58] Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in
[57:00] my name. He's going to teach you all
[57:03] things and bring all things to
[57:05] remembrance whatsoever I've said unto
[57:07] you. So, we weren't made to figure
[57:10] everything out on our own.
[57:14] We're not to look to humans
[57:18] to teach us how to live for God because
[57:21] God sending himself to live inside of us
[57:26] to teach us all things.
[57:30] The Holy Ghost is our teacher.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; We were made to be taught by God all
[57:38] things.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this. We were made to be
[57:41] taught by God all things.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; So, no matter what it is that you're
[57:47] facing, God's got the answer.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; God's got the uh the the solution to the
[57:52] problem. God's got the victory. God's
[57:54] got the deliverance. God's got the help.
[57:57] God is our answer.
[58:03] No, not just some things, not just
[58:06] spiritual things, but I'm telling you,
[58:09] God can be your wisdom and how to handle
[58:12] natural things in life.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. Verse 27.
[58:18] Peace I leave with you, and peace I give
[58:20] unto you. Not as the world giveth, give
[58:22] I unto you. Let not your heart be
[58:24] troubled, neither let it be afraid. So
[58:26] God is through this comforter. There's
[58:29] going to be a peace because now we can
[58:32] rely on God. We don't have to rely on
[58:35] human beings. We can rely on God and
[58:38] he's our peace. Because on the world,
[58:40] you got to rely on somebody to get
[58:42] peace.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; You have to rely on another human being.
[58:46] Circumstances got to be right.
[58:47] Everything's got to be just perfectly in
[58:49] order.
[58:52] I'm not going to get thrown in the
[58:53] lion's den of the fiery furnace. There's
[58:55] no giant for me to face.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Okay, I got peace.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Nations are okay.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; But the peace that God gives you, things
[59:05] could be blown up in front of you, but
[59:06] something inside, whoa, there's a peace
[59:10] that passes understanding.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; We were never made to make peace on our
[59:15] own.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; God is our peace. He is the prince of
[59:20] peace.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he is our peace.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; He is our source of peace.
[59:31] I to give another scripture on God
[59:34] teaching us. It's in 1 John chapter 2
[59:37] 26.
[59:39] 1 John chapter 26. These things I write
[59:42] unto you concerning them that seduce
[59:45] you.
[59:47] Okay. These things I write unto you
[59:49] concerning them that seduce you.
[59:55] Now, who's that going to be?
[1:00:01] Somebody that seduces you is
[1:00:05] someone who is trying to outsmart,
[1:00:07] outwit,
[1:00:09] manipulate, control.
[1:00:13] But it starts in the spiritual realm as
[1:00:15] demons and demonic spirits, false
[1:00:17] anointings, principalities, rulers in in
[1:00:20] darkness, spirits that lie to us. They
[1:00:24] get inside of people. They lie. They
[1:00:26] become fake impos in impersonators and
[1:00:29] imposters
[1:00:32] and we don't know it because they're
[1:00:34] smiling.
[1:00:35] [Laughter]
[1:00:37] They're they're saying, "Boy, I like
[1:00:39] your tie.
[1:00:43] They're
[1:00:46] you don't always know them
[1:00:49] by what their words say, how they're
[1:00:50] dressed. They could be in sheep's
[1:00:52] clothing uh Jesus said,
[1:00:54] but inwardly
[1:00:56] they're a wolf.
[1:01:00] So these things I write unto you
[1:01:02] concerning them that seduce you,
[1:01:06] but the anointing which you have
[1:01:08] received of him abides in you.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; And you need not that any man teach you.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; So who cares about these seducers?
[1:01:21] But as the same anointing teaches you
[1:01:23] all things and is truth and is no lie
[1:01:30] and even as it have taught you, you
[1:01:32] shall abide in him. So our job is to
[1:01:37] abide in the Holy Ghost. Our job is to
[1:01:40] abide in the word. Our job is to abide
[1:01:44] in the love of God.
[1:01:46] We have a part to play in order for the
[1:01:49] teacher to teach us
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; because brother Brandon made it real
[1:01:52] clear that if we decide we're going to
[1:01:54] go do our shenanigans that the Holy
[1:01:57] Spirit was going to lift off of us and
[1:01:59] he's going to go sit there on a on a on
[1:02:01] a pole or a line and he's going to wait
[1:02:04] for us to get done acting so worldly.
[1:02:08] That's what he said.
[1:02:12] Now, that ain't God leaving us
[1:02:16] because he promised never to leave us.
[1:02:18] That's us leaving God. And God says,
[1:02:20] "Okay, you made a choice."
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; That's why we got to keep seeking more
[1:02:24] Holy Ghost until we get to the place
[1:02:26] that we become sealed with this Holy
[1:02:28] Ghost
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; until the day of redemption.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; And too many people just fall short in
[1:02:37] in in getting more and more of God.
[1:02:41] So you have a major part to play that
[1:02:45] God is going to be with you. We just
[1:02:47] can't do whatever we want and claim that
[1:02:49] he's not leaving us.
[1:02:52] We got to abide in the word
[1:02:55] continuously. Always checking up, always
[1:02:57] making sure. Brother Ram says, "Turn
[1:02:59] over every rock. Make sure. Make sure."
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Not assume. To assume is to venture
[1:03:04] without authority. And to to think that
[1:03:07] everything's okay without checking is a
[1:03:10] false sense of security. Now remember
[1:03:12] the the Pharisees, they were very
[1:03:15] selfrighteous.
[1:03:18] They were also hypocrites
[1:03:21] and they felt secure.
[1:03:24] They felt so secure they were able to
[1:03:26] come up to Jesus and say, "Who do you
[1:03:28] think you are?"
[1:03:31] They didn't even recognize the word of
[1:03:34] God.
[1:03:36] So, we just want to stay humble. God
[1:03:40] gives grace to the humble. John 15 26
[1:03:44] next chapter. But when we're still
[1:03:46] speaking of the Holy Ghost here, this
[1:03:49] we're never able to make it on our own.
[1:03:51] We weren't made that way. But when the
[1:03:52] comforter is come whom I will send unto
[1:03:56] you from my father, even the Spirit of
[1:03:59] truth which proceeds from the Father,
[1:04:02] he's going to testify of me.
[1:04:05] In other words, if the Holy Ghost is
[1:04:07] speaking through you,
[1:04:10] you're not going to be speaking about
[1:04:11] yourself.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be about you. It's
[1:04:16] going to be about God
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; because that's what Jesus said. And you
[1:04:22] also
[1:04:24] shall bear witness because you have been
[1:04:27] with me from the beginning. So something
[1:04:29] inside of us is going to also bear
[1:04:31] witness of it. All right. Next chapter
[1:04:34] 16. Chapter 16 of St. John verse 7.
[1:04:37] Nevertheless, I tell you, it is
[1:04:38] expedient for you that I go away. For if
[1:04:42] I go not away, the comforter will not
[1:04:45] come unto you. But if I depart, I will
[1:04:48] send him unto you.
[1:04:53] So we
[1:04:56] remember the disciples were so afraid
[1:04:58] that Jesus was leaving. Let not your
[1:04:59] heart be troubled.
[1:05:02] Everything's going to be okay. I'm not
[1:05:03] going to leave you by yourself because
[1:05:06] you were not made to make it on your
[1:05:09] own. That's what he's telling his
[1:05:11] disciples. He says, "But I'm going to
[1:05:14] send you another comforter,
[1:05:17] but it's going to be him in spirit
[1:05:18] form."
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; So, we got the same Jesus inside of us
[1:05:23] that walked the shores of Galilee.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. that that that that literally
[1:05:28] spoke the stars into existence.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; That's where he could say, "Where were
[1:05:33] you, Job?"
[1:05:35] When the stars shouted for joy,
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; we were with God.
[1:05:43] And when he is come, verse eight, and
[1:05:46] when he has come, when this comforter is
[1:05:48] going to come,
[1:05:51] he is going to reprove the world of
[1:05:55] three things.
[1:05:57] sin, righteousness, and judgment.
[1:06:00] So, this job of the comforter is to
[1:06:03] reprove you. I just want to get this
[1:06:06] story straight. This, if you look that
[1:06:07] word up, reprove, it means to conflute.
[1:06:12] Confute, which means to prove that
[1:06:15] you're absolutely
[1:06:18] wrong.
[1:06:21] The job of the comforter is to prove
[1:06:24] that you're absolutely wrong.
[1:06:26] to convict, convince, to tell a fault,
[1:06:29] to rebuke or reprove.
[1:06:32] That is going to be the job of the
[1:06:35] comforter.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:06:39] we think of comforting like
[1:06:43] it's going to be okay.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; I'm with you.
[1:06:48] But here's the thing. When you're born
[1:06:51] with an evil nature that's totally
[1:06:53] selfish
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; and the only thing you think about is
[1:06:57] what you want,
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; you need something to help you get away
[1:07:02] from that nature.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; From living for yourself to living for
[1:07:08] others.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; You need something to help you with
[1:07:11] that. And it can't be a person.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; God sends the Holy Ghost in your life.
[1:07:19] He sends something on the inside of you
[1:07:21] that says, "Whoa, that's not right."
[1:07:25] That tells you a fault. That convicts
[1:07:27] you. That reproves you. That that that
[1:07:30] says you're doing something that's
[1:07:32] absolutely not according to the
[1:07:33] scriptures.
[1:07:37] And we we testify of that as the
[1:07:40] comforter.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; That's someone that's telling us the
[1:07:46] right way to go.
[1:07:48] that's leading and guiding us into the
[1:07:50] all truth. Because as a unconverted
[1:07:53] person, we're in total sin.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; And it's not a matter of just, oh, I
[1:07:59] accept Jesus as my savior. Jesus wants
[1:08:02] to come inside of us by the form of the
[1:08:04] Holy Spirit. And we begin to talk like
[1:08:06] him, walk like him, act like him, start
[1:08:09] doing things that he wants us to do.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; And you know, our nature is to do what
[1:08:14] God wants, but it's also to do what we
[1:08:16] want. And there's struggle that's going
[1:08:19] on inside of us. And then we wonder why
[1:08:21] we're having some problems when we're
[1:08:23] trying to do good. And and but here's
[1:08:25] the thing, God wants to be Lord of
[1:08:28] everything,
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; right? He he he just doesn't want to be
[1:08:32] our savior, but he wants to be lord of
[1:08:34] everything. So it's crucial that we seek
[1:08:36] the Holy Ghost. Without the Holy Ghost,
[1:08:38] we're depending on what? We're depending
[1:08:41] on our own ability to be a good enough
[1:08:45] Christian. We're we're depending on uh
[1:08:48] what the what on two days a week coming
[1:08:50] to church and hearing the preacher what
[1:08:52] he's got to say. No, it ain't going to
[1:08:54] work to make a rapture. We need the Holy
[1:08:57] Ghost.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; And we and I'll say to everyone that's
[1:09:01] got the Holy Ghost, we need more Holy
[1:09:03] Ghost.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; We need more Holy Ghost.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; I don't think God would ever say to one
[1:09:09] human being in existence,
[1:09:12] you have enough.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; You have enough. I will say this when
[1:09:16] it's all over. We will hear the words
[1:09:18] well done.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; But what he told the prophet, you need
[1:09:23] to be more sincere.
[1:09:26] What? Four years before he passed away.
[1:09:28] You're you're you're just you're just
[1:09:31] you're just getting started. Press on.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; What what what Paul say? I I haven't
[1:09:38] attained. I'm still pressing towards the
[1:09:41] mark.
[1:09:43] So, I really feel that God is he's
[1:09:46] always pulling us closer to him and and
[1:09:49] I don't think we should be afraid of the
[1:09:52] comforter because he's going to reprove
[1:09:54] us. That's his job.
[1:09:58] No wonder the church world has to bring
[1:10:01] some sort of entertainment into the
[1:10:03] church
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; to make them feel good.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; No wonder our church here isn't fun for
[1:10:10] our flesh.
[1:10:11] We should better say amen to that.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; If the comforter shows up, there's going
[1:10:16] to be some proving that's going on
[1:10:18] inside of us.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; I remember, you know, there was a a
[1:10:23] woman that was caught in adultery.
[1:10:26] And the man was caught in adultery, too.
[1:10:28] But for some reason, they wanted to
[1:10:29] crucify the woman.
[1:10:33] And they brought the woman before the
[1:10:35] elders and before Jesus.
[1:10:39] And they were all
[1:10:43] expressing
[1:10:44] how she was a did something worthy of
[1:10:47] death according to the word of God.
[1:10:53] And they were pointing right in the
[1:10:55] word. This is what the Bible say. This
[1:10:56] is what the word says. This is what
[1:10:58] Moses says.
[1:11:00] And then they looked to Jesus and they
[1:11:02] said, "Jesus, what do you say?"
[1:11:07] And Jesus full of wisdom from above.
[1:11:11] Not worldly wisdom, but wisdom from
[1:11:13] above. He said, "Let him I I agree with
[1:11:17] the word that you're just saying." So
[1:11:19] let him that's without sin, let let him
[1:11:22] be the one that cast the first stone.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; And they all began to think, "Whoa,
[1:11:29] I wasn't caught in adultery, but I'm
[1:11:33] I'm guilty.
[1:11:35] I can't cast the stone.
[1:11:39] And the from the oldest person to the
[1:11:41] youngest, they began to drop their
[1:11:43] stones.
[1:11:46] And when they dropped their stones, they
[1:11:48] had nothing to accuse. So they walked
[1:11:50] away.
[1:11:53] And they all walked away. And Jesus was
[1:11:56] left with the woman.
[1:12:03] What made them walk away?
[1:12:09] The Holy Ghost came and reproved
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; the sin in their life without speak
[1:12:15] without even calling it out.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; That's the power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; It can speak right to our hearts without
[1:12:23] calling it out.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; I'm sure Jesus could have called out
[1:12:29] every one of their sins.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; What about this? What about this? What
[1:12:32] about this? What about this? But he
[1:12:34] didn't.
[1:12:36] That's not that's that's not how you do
[1:12:39] it.
[1:12:43] We love the comforter.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; We love him when he speaks to us. We if
[1:12:49] we if we do not have him on the inside
[1:12:52] directing our life, then it's us
[1:12:54] directing the ship, us directing the
[1:12:55] car, us directing the train. We're just
[1:12:58] not going to make it to our desired
[1:12:59] rapture.
[1:13:01] We need the word of God.
[1:13:04] It's why the prophet could say to us, we
[1:13:06] come to church to learn spiritually now
[1:13:09] where we're at with him.
[1:13:12] That's why we come to church to learn
[1:13:14] where we're at with him because the Holy
[1:13:16] Spirit will speak to our hearts. All
[1:13:19] right, let's continue on. Verse N, he's
[1:13:21] going to reprove the world, the worldly
[1:13:24] nature inside of us
[1:13:27] of sin because
[1:13:30] they notice they believe not on me. Did
[1:13:34] you know the spirits that Okay, I don't
[1:13:38] know when you all got converted. Just
[1:13:40] pick a day that you got converted.
[1:13:43] Until that day, did you know you there
[1:13:47] was demons living in you?
[1:13:50] demonic spirits
[1:13:54] and you know they didn't believe the
[1:13:56] word of God.
[1:13:58] I remember as a teenager
[1:14:00] uh drinking and smoking and doing the
[1:14:03] things I did and th those spirits that
[1:14:06] were in me, they did not believe in God.
[1:14:09] That's why I did them.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; You know, you're you're you're cursing,
[1:14:12] you're swearing, you're getting upset.
[1:14:14] All these things that you're doing,
[1:14:16] these are just spirits that don't
[1:14:17] believe in God.
[1:14:21] But when the Holy Ghost comes, don't do
[1:14:23] that.
[1:14:25] It reproves you. It says we don't do
[1:14:28] that.
[1:14:29] And then we put on the Lord Jesus
[1:14:32] Christ. We we start listening. We start
[1:14:34] yielding. We start becoming born again
[1:14:38] and we grow into the nature of God
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; through this simple transformed by the
[1:14:44] renewing of our mind as the scripture
[1:14:46] tells us.
[1:14:48] So the spirits that are all worldly
[1:14:51] spirits, they don't believe. But brother
[1:14:52] Brand said, "What sin is is unbelief
[1:14:56] of righteousness
[1:14:58] because I go to my father and you shall
[1:15:00] see me no more." In other words,
[1:15:05] Jesus in the flesh is not going to be
[1:15:07] here to point us. This is the righteous
[1:15:10] way
[1:15:12] with the Holy Spirit. Now we have the
[1:15:13] living word telling us how to treat our
[1:15:16] brother, how to treat our sister, how to
[1:15:18] act right,
[1:15:20] of judgment
[1:15:22] because the prince of this world is
[1:15:25] judged. When the Holy Ghost comes inside
[1:15:27] of you, you guarantee that devil's going
[1:15:30] to be judged.
[1:15:32] He's coming out. That's just all there
[1:15:34] is to it.
[1:15:36] Thank God for the comforter.
[1:15:40] And he says,"I have many things to say
[1:15:43] unto you." You know, you got a lot of
[1:15:45] stuff in your life, but you can't bear
[1:15:49] it now.
[1:15:51] How be it, when he, the Spirit of truth,
[1:15:54] has come.
[1:15:56] He's going to be doing these things.
[1:15:58] He's going to guide you into all these
[1:16:00] truths. For he shall not speak of
[1:16:03] himself again. For whatsoever he shall
[1:16:06] hear, that shall he speak, and he shall
[1:16:09] show you things to come. We were never
[1:16:11] ever made to make it on our own. Never.
[1:16:17] He shall glorify me, for he shall
[1:16:19] receive of of mine, and shall show it
[1:16:21] unto you. All things that the father
[1:16:24] have are mine. Therefore said I, that he
[1:16:26] shall take of mine and show it unto you.
[1:16:33] God didn't even want us to witness, be a
[1:16:36] witness for him without God inside of
[1:16:39] us. He didn't want us to do it on our
[1:16:41] own.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; I don't think God wants us to do
[1:16:44] anything on our own.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do in word or deed, do it
[1:16:48] all in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Luke 10:3
[1:16:53] Jesus said, "Go your ways. Behold, I
[1:16:56] send you forth as lambs among wolves.
[1:17:03] Just like God sent Paul to the Gentiles
[1:17:06] of whom he was going to deliver have to
[1:17:08] deliver him at one time, he sends them
[1:17:10] as lambs in the midst of wolves.
[1:17:14] Can you believe God would do that to us?
[1:17:21] It isn't that he has confidence in you.
[1:17:26] He's got confidence in himself, in you.
[1:17:29] He's going to deliver you.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; That's why we should never be afraid,
[1:17:35] don't take this the wrong way, of a
[1:17:38] fight,
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; of something getting out of order.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Because all we have to do,
[1:17:48] we were never made to make it on our
[1:17:50] own, to be alone, to feel alone. We got
[1:17:52] God on the inside of us. We can do all
[1:17:56] things through Christ who strengthen us.
[1:18:01] We're not afraid.
[1:18:05] God sends us forth as lambs among wolves
[1:18:09] in this world.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll never leave you. I'll
[1:18:15] never forsake you."
[1:18:18] Matthewapter 8:18 Jesus came and spake
[1:18:22] unto them, saying, "All power is given
[1:18:24] unto me in heaven and earth. Go ye
[1:18:26] therefore and teach all nations,
[1:18:28] baptizing them in the name of the Father
[1:18:30] and of the Son and the Holy Ghost,
[1:18:31] teaching them to observe all things
[1:18:33] whatsoever I command you. And lo, I'm
[1:18:35] with you always, even unto the end of
[1:18:36] the world." So he tells them to go and
[1:18:40] do his work,
[1:18:42] do teaching, do baptizing. In fact, tell
[1:18:46] him to do everything to observe all
[1:18:49] things whatsoever I command you.
[1:18:52] So now he wants us to spread everything,
[1:18:54] not just baptism,
[1:18:56] not just uh uh certain things, but
[1:19:01] really all things and to all nations
[1:19:04] that that that God is the same
[1:19:06] everywhere. He's the same yesterday,
[1:19:08] today, and forever.
[1:19:12] So he tells them to go do this. And then
[1:19:14] in Luke 24:46, and he said unto them,
[1:19:17] "Thus it is written, and thus it behold
[1:19:20] Christ to suffer, to rise from the dead
[1:19:22] the third day, and and that repentance
[1:19:24] and remission of sin should be preached
[1:19:26] in his name among all nations, beginning
[1:19:28] at Jerusalem. And you're witnesses of
[1:19:31] these things."
[1:19:33] And so, you know what I want you to do?
[1:19:34] I want you to go out there and do it.
[1:19:36] And behold, I send the comforter,
[1:19:40] the promise of my father upon you. But
[1:19:43] tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until
[1:19:50] you be endued with power from on high.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Well, that word is just as powerful
[1:19:56] today as it was the day it was spoken.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; We need to spend more time tearing and
[1:20:03] waiting until we're endued with power
[1:20:06] from on high.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Power to defeat the thoughts, the
[1:20:10] negative things that come to our mind.
[1:20:12] the the the the the things that the
[1:20:14] enemy tries to hold us down with. They
[1:20:17] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:20:19] their strength. They shall mount up with
[1:20:21] wings as eagles. They they shall not be
[1:20:23] weary and faint. They shall they walk.
[1:20:25] They they'll they'll be able to handle
[1:20:27] the task. You know what I'm saying?
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; That's what God has in store for those
[1:20:35] that are willing to tar and wait for his
[1:20:38] Holy Spirit. I'm not ever saying we
[1:20:42] don't have the Holy Spirit. I would
[1:20:44] never think those thoughts at all. What
[1:20:47] I am saying
[1:20:49] is that we need to make sure that we're
[1:20:53] staying filled up,
[1:20:56] that we're spending time with God,
[1:20:58] getting
[1:21:00] energized.
[1:21:03] You know, we can't come to church and
[1:21:05] expect
[1:21:08] everybody else to make us feel better at
[1:21:09] church.
[1:21:12] We are the church.
[1:21:15] And it's okay to come in once a year and
[1:21:18] be down in the dumps. I'll let you do it
[1:21:21] once a year. But I'm telling you, that
[1:21:25] is it. After that, you better be
[1:21:28] bringing something to the church
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; cuz we need you.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; We need you. We need every one of you
[1:21:36] putting forth your best to create an
[1:21:38] atmosphere where God just wants to come
[1:21:40] and fall amongst us. Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:21:46] Um
[1:21:49] and we're just going to do Luke 24.
[1:21:52] Uh oh, no, we did that. We're going to
[1:21:54] go to Acts chapter 1. I'm sorry. We're
[1:21:57] still doing this this theme here that
[1:22:00] that we weren't ever able to make it on
[1:22:03] our own. We weren't intended. God never
[1:22:05] wanted to leave us on our own. He always
[1:22:08] was intended for us to have the Holy
[1:22:10] Ghost. Acts 1:3. To whom also
[1:22:16] he showed himself alive. that Jesus
[1:22:18] showed himself alive after his passion
[1:22:21] by many infallible proofs, being seen of
[1:22:24] them 40 days, and speaking of things
[1:22:26] pertaining to the kingdom of God, and
[1:22:29] being assembled together with them, he
[1:22:32] commanded them that they should not
[1:22:34] depart from Jerusalem,
[1:22:37] but to wait for the promise of the
[1:22:39] Father, which saith he, you have heard
[1:22:42] of me. For John truly baptized with
[1:22:44] water, but you shall be baptized with
[1:22:46] the Holy Ghost not many days hence.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Don't depart
[1:22:53] from Jerusalem, but come.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Because these spirits that living inside
[1:22:59] that are doubting and questioning and
[1:23:01] going through all, you know, we just
[1:23:02] want to give up.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Wait a little bit longer. It'll happen
[1:23:07] the next service or No, today is the
[1:23:10] day.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. God is an I am God.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Verse eight, but you shall receive power
[1:23:20] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; And you shall be witnesses unto me both
[1:23:26] in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the
[1:23:28] uttermost parts of the earth. Notice,
[1:23:30] we're not to be a witness for God until
[1:23:33] we receive the power of God.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; That's why a lot of people
[1:23:41] turn people off.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; They have this intent. They want to do
[1:23:47] good. They want to bring Christ to
[1:23:48] somebody,
[1:23:50] but because they don't, you know, they
[1:23:52] get slapped on the face and they want to
[1:23:53] slap them in the face.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; They ask them to go a mile says, "I
[1:23:57] ain't doing that. I'm just going to tell
[1:23:58] you what you need to do." They just they
[1:24:00] don't have the power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:03] They still live for themselves. They
[1:24:05] don't want to live for anybody, right?
[1:24:10] Let's close with this. St. John chapter
[1:24:12] 15. What we started out with, St. John
[1:24:14] 15.
[1:24:16] We were never made to make it on our
[1:24:18] own. God sent the Holy Ghost for every
[1:24:23] possible thing so we could do whatever
[1:24:25] he's called us to do with the power of
[1:24:28] God inside of our life.
[1:24:31] John 15:1 says, 'I am the true vine,
[1:24:37] and my father is a husbandman. Every
[1:24:39] branch in me that beareth not fruit, he
[1:24:41] taketh away, and every branch that beare
[1:24:44] fruit, he purchase that that may bring
[1:24:46] forth more fruit. I thank God number
[1:24:48] one, he's interested
[1:24:52] in us bearing the fruit of the spirit,
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; which the first is love, right? By this
[1:25:00] shall all men know you're my disciples.
[1:25:02] Bear the fruit of God. And that if you
[1:25:07] you don't bear it, you make the choice.
[1:25:12] If you're not bearing fruit, here's the
[1:25:14] only reason you're not bearing fruit.
[1:25:15] Because the spirit is not alive in your
[1:25:17] life.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; God is not going to be alive in your
[1:25:20] life and not bear fruit.
[1:25:23] I it it's impossible because every
[1:25:26] spirit has a fruit.
[1:25:29] evil or good,
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; it's going to bear it.
[1:25:35] And if you do have his spirit and you
[1:25:38] are bearing fruit, he's not going to
[1:25:40] leave you in that condition.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Because we just heard when the spirit of
[1:25:45] truth is going to come, he's going to
[1:25:46] reprove you.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; In other words, he's going to do some
[1:25:48] pruning.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; He's going to do some purging. He's
[1:25:51] gonna He wants more
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; and he should be able to get it. He
[1:25:56] created us for his pleasure. Amen.
[1:26:00] Bible says, "Now you're clean through
[1:26:03] the word which I have spoken."
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; When you say amen to the word of God,
[1:26:08] you know what you're actually doing?
[1:26:10] You're being cleansed at that moment by
[1:26:12] the word.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; So be it in my life, Lord. A cleansing
[1:26:16] is happening spiritually.
[1:26:19] Abide
[1:26:20] in me
[1:26:23] and I in you.
[1:26:25] As the branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:26:26] itself, except it abide in the vine, no
[1:26:29] more can you except you abide in me. We
[1:26:33] were never made to make it on our own to
[1:26:36] bear fruit of God. We don't believe in
[1:26:38] putting peacock feathers in.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; We need the juice from the inside. We're
[1:26:43] not a form of godliness. We We got God
[1:26:46] on the inside. We should be able to to
[1:26:49] to stand tall and and live a life that's
[1:26:52] ex pleasing to to to those that are
[1:26:55] around that they can see Christ in us.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; I am the vine, you are the branches.
[1:27:02] He that abideth in me and I in him the
[1:27:04] same bringeth forth much fruit. For
[1:27:06] without me, he sends this message. For
[1:27:08] without me, remember you can do nothing.
[1:27:12] Don't get to a place in your Christian
[1:27:14] walk that you think you can make it on
[1:27:15] your own.
[1:27:19] If you abide in me and I in you say if
[1:27:23] you if you abide not in me if any man
[1:27:26] I'm sorry if a man abide not in me if I
[1:27:28] could just you know read the words I
[1:27:29] would be fine right if I think I know
[1:27:31] what I'm Lord help me if a man abide not
[1:27:34] in me is cast forth as a branch and is
[1:27:37] withered and men gather them and cast
[1:27:40] them into the fire and they are burned.
[1:27:44] So I'd rather fail and depend on the
[1:27:48] Lord,
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; be in him and fail
[1:27:53] than act feel I can make it on my own
[1:27:55] now. I don't need I don't need the the
[1:27:58] Holy Ghost
[1:28:00] because at the end I'm going to be
[1:28:02] burned. If you abide in me and my words
[1:28:06] abide in you, look at the look at this
[1:28:08] precious blessed promise. You shall ask
[1:28:10] what you will and it shall be done unto
[1:28:13] you.
[1:28:15] But it comes from a union, from being
[1:28:17] one with God,
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; from abiding in the word and the word
[1:28:21] living in you.
[1:28:26] Herein is my father glorified, that ye
[1:28:28] bear much fruit. So shall ye be my
[1:28:31] disciples. As the father have loved us,
[1:28:33] so have I loved you. Oh, sorry. As as
[1:28:36] the father have loved me, so have I
[1:28:37] loved you. Continue ye in my love. If ye
[1:28:42] keep my commandments, ye shall abide in
[1:28:44] my love, yet as I kept my father's
[1:28:46] commandments, and I abide in his love.
[1:28:49] These things have I spoken unto you,
[1:28:51] that my joy might remain in you, and
[1:28:54] that your joy might be full. We've all
[1:28:57] experienced the joy of the Lord.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; We all have.
[1:29:01] We've all experienced not having the joy
[1:29:03] of the Lord.
[1:29:07] And I believe
[1:29:09] that we can step out
[1:29:12] of walking with the Lord and trying to
[1:29:14] just do things on our own. And when that
[1:29:16] happens, we leave the abiding.
[1:29:20] We leave that.
[1:29:22] It's almost like this.
[1:29:25] We've all had children that we've w had
[1:29:27] had walking in our hand. We hold them in
[1:29:30] our hand when we're walking, right?
[1:29:32] Through a store, through an airport. you
[1:29:34] know, we don't want anybody to steal
[1:29:36] them
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; and
[1:29:40] or crossing, you know, we're going to
[1:29:42] cross the street. The last thing that we
[1:29:44] want is our child to say, "I got it
[1:29:47] handled. I'm going."
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; They But you see them do it.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Like, what's going on? What's going on
[1:29:56] is in their human mind, they think they
[1:29:59] can make it without help.
[1:30:02] But they don't real. I mean, I sat there
[1:30:04] at therapy in in the car and I was just
[1:30:07] waiting for my time to go in there and I
[1:30:09] saw this lady had a child and they were
[1:30:11] way over here on the sidewalk and and
[1:30:14] they were they were talking soon as just
[1:30:16] a one second that child went right
[1:30:18] towards the road like four times it
[1:30:20] happened.
[1:30:24] We as you know strong Christians
[1:30:28] can have that tendency.
[1:30:30] I can handle this when I'm
[1:30:36] We got to stay abiding. Get do things
[1:30:38] according to the word. Stay with the
[1:30:40] word. Keep keep the love of God in your
[1:30:44] heart. That's why the Bible says, "Speak
[1:30:45] the truth in love." When you're
[1:30:46] correcting, h have that love flowing.
[1:30:51] Abide in his love. The Bible says,
[1:30:54] "These things have I spoken unto you
[1:30:56] that your joy might remain with you.
[1:30:57] That your joy might be full might be
[1:31:00] full. This is my commandment that you
[1:31:02] love one another as I have loved you.
[1:31:04] Greater love have no man than this than
[1:31:06] a man lay down his life for his friends.
[1:31:08] And you are my friends if you do
[1:31:12] whatsoever I command you. That kind of
[1:31:14] sounds like a conditional friend,
[1:31:15] doesn't it?
[1:31:17] But it is.
[1:31:20] It is.
[1:31:24] It is. And he loves everybody, but not
[1:31:28] everybody's going in a rapture.
[1:31:30] Not everybody's going to heaven. It's
[1:31:33] those who who who
[1:31:37] allow the Holy Spirit to reprove the
[1:31:40] world out
[1:31:42] and for him to abide the word to abide
[1:31:45] when the word when you when you see
[1:31:47] something in the word of God just
[1:31:48] anything I don't care what it is if it's
[1:31:50] you know you shouldn't steal you say you
[1:31:53] know what I'm never going to steal my
[1:31:54] life. Did you know you got Jesus living
[1:31:56] inside you? You got part of Jesus. You
[1:32:00] got part of Jesus living inside of you.
[1:32:02] Not the fullness.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; But I'm saying this is how easy it is to
[1:32:08] get God abiding in you. Now, you can't
[1:32:11] just say,
[1:32:14] um, I I'm I'm not going to steal. I got
[1:32:18] Jesus. And then go lie constantly.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? When you're
[1:32:24] being told, don't lie.
[1:32:27] So when you hear don't lie, stop lying.
[1:32:32] And that's how Jesus is in you. Because
[1:32:36] if you're not stealing, but you're
[1:32:38] lying, I'm sorry. Jesus isn't in you.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; You know, so you just you got to
[1:32:43] understand. I'm just trying to encourage
[1:32:45] you that when you hear the word of God,
[1:32:46] you say, "Amen." You're accepting the
[1:32:49] living word of God. Let's stand
[1:32:50] together.
[1:32:54] We will always be a needy people.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; We were never made to make it on our
[1:33:00] own, nor will we ever make it on our
[1:33:02] own. We've got to build ourselves up in
[1:33:05] the most holy faith. Brother Brandham
[1:33:07] said that we're going to need a perfect
[1:33:09] love to produce a perfect faith to make
[1:33:11] a rapture.
[1:33:15] Jesus made it very clear for without him
[1:33:18] we can do nothing.
[1:33:20] Paul made it clear that we can do all
[1:33:22] things through Christ.
[1:33:25] Amen. I am so needy, Lord.
[1:33:33] I am so needy,
[1:33:37] Lord.
[1:33:40] So needy of you.
[1:33:45] I am so needy, Lord,
[1:33:50] to be more like you.
[1:33:56] She all my rights away
[1:34:01] in this world of sin.
[1:34:06] I am so needy, Lord,
[1:34:12] to be pure with him.
[1:34:17] I am so needy, Lord.
[1:34:22] So needy of you.
[1:34:28] I am so needy, Lord,
[1:34:32] to be more like you.
[1:34:38] tear all my rights away
[1:34:43] in this world of sin.
[1:34:48] I am so needy, Lord,
[1:34:53] to be pure within.
[1:34:58] Amen. As they continue to play that,
[1:35:01] let's bow our hearts for a word of
[1:35:03] prayer.
[1:35:05] Maybe you're here today
[1:35:10] and you're feeling,
[1:35:13] I know there's some things that are
[1:35:15] hanging on my life
[1:35:18] and I I need those things sheared away.
[1:35:23] You want to be remembered in prayer.
[1:35:25] Just lift your hand. I want to pray with
[1:35:27] you. Praise the Lord. God bless these
[1:35:30] hands.
[1:35:31] God bless these hands. God bless these
[1:35:34] hearts. Our heavenly father,
[1:35:38] Lord, you sent your word to heal the
[1:35:41] people.
[1:35:43] And we thank you, Lord, that
[1:35:47] your Holy Spirit has come today,
[1:35:50] Lord, to make love to your wife,
[1:35:54] to let her know
[1:35:58] that
[1:36:00] she is your bride.
[1:36:04] and that you showed your love by the
[1:36:08] washing your bride
[1:36:12] with with the word.
[1:36:14] You cleansed her. And today, Lord,
[1:36:18] they're they're hanging on to this word,
[1:36:21] Lord, and wanting every thing that's not
[1:36:24] of you, that's of this world, that's
[1:36:27] this wrong nature, Lord. the things they
[1:36:30] just want everything
[1:36:33] sheared away from their life. Lord, that
[1:36:35] they could just be pure Mrs. Jesus for
[1:36:39] you, Lord. I pray that you'd grant to
[1:36:42] each one their heart's desire.
[1:36:45] Lord, that you would bless them with
[1:36:46] such a a portion of your power today.
[1:36:50] Lord, let them leave here. May they may
[1:36:52] not feel it but may they just believe
[1:36:55] Lord that that power is inside of them
[1:36:59] because they have accepted Lord your
[1:37:01] word today which is power. Oh granted
[1:37:05] Lord Jesus we thank you for these
[1:37:07] things. We commit them into your hands
[1:37:10] for your honor, your glory. May you may
[1:37:14] you
[1:37:16] Lord may they be a witness for you
[1:37:18] wherever they go, whatever they do. May
[1:37:21] that power raise within them that
[1:37:23] whoever they talk to, whoever sees their
[1:37:27] life that they would see that there's
[1:37:29] the power of almighty God uh coming
[1:37:32] forth through their life and how they
[1:37:35] love and how they deal with things and
[1:37:37] how they handle things. Oh granite Lord
[1:37:40] we thank you for it now in Jesus
