title this little sermon is overcoming the giants in your land and the subject letting off the pressure when you get there say amen and we'll begin romans 8 35. amen so it says who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or prayer or sword as is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us from persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of christ which is in christ our lord christ jesus our lord so all these things sometimes can get into our life and tribulation and persecution and famine get in our life and kind of just bring us down but what the scripture's telling me here none of these things should move us we should be standing on what god has been speaking to us standing on his word because right here this is a promise right here because he died for you so you can become an overcomer not so you can just you know just stay in this little bubble and be scared of things but god is calling you to look at these things in his word and saying nade all these things we're more than conquerors through him that loved us so let's go to let's go to revelations chapter 3 verse 20. so it says behold i stand at the door and knock so this morning he's knocking at your heart he's wanting to to come in and sup with you to commune with you but the thing is you have to open that door he's not going to kick the door down he wants you to open that door he's a gentleman behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me verse 21 to him that overcometh while i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and have sat down with my father in his throne so jesus has overcome hath hell death in the grave and he's calling you to be an overcomer as well he says well i love this in 22. he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saying to the churches always i like to pray lord give us ears to hear give us eyes to see so uh so we're living in a day of pressure there's pressure all around us you have coveted politics around the world or just crazy people there's 54 different genders you can be all these crazy things that are happening there's pressures how can god using your kingdom if you're letting the pressures of this life capsize your ship there's financial issues all these things you fill in the blank of that that are going on in people's lives and the thing is who are you giving control of the steering wheel in your life are you trying to take control or is god you letting god take control of it and what is pressure i looked at what pressure is is the act of squeezing or crushing the state of being squeezed and crushed now satan he wants to just crush you and squeeze you with all these problems in his world he wants to make you think about this and that he wants you to worry he wants to do all these things just to distract you from god so so also also another definition that which afflicts the body or depresses the spirit he wants to depress your spirit he wants to put a spirit of oppression a spirit of depression into you because you look at a lot of communities there's a lot of oppression they're so used to living in that state that they think there's no way out and satan has got them thinking that so also it's any severe affliction distress calamity or grievance straits difficulties embarrassments or distress uh the occasion even like satan likes to make you feel embarrassed if you have something in your life a vice or a addiction he wants to feel embarrassed about he thinks that you he wants to make you think you can never overcome it but the thing is i'll tell you my brother and sister you can overcome he's called you to overcome everything so we speak of pressure of poverty or want the pressures of debts the pressure of taxes the pressure of affliction or sorrow read a little quote real quick that fits with this and we're living in a day of much pressure everywhere everybody is so tense and down the street with a hot rod they can't wait for the stoplight and you know and run you over they're not going anywhere not at all they're just as hard as they can race but just racing towards eternity is all i know and they have uh you have to watch this way get the watch that way and i said there's just two classes of people who live down here that's the quick and the dead and them that ain't quick die quick i might it's dangerous to be safe this day hurrying and racing everybody's in a hurry to get everywhere everybody is so you look the highway people are going 89 miles an hour and if you're not going that fast they're gonna try to run you over and and then you go over and they give you they yell at you so it's just a day we're living and everybody's just has so much pressure and so much built up and they don't know where to go and they got to realize there's a refuge they can go to is jesus christ so in this day there's so much pressure and the problem is we're trying to go a million miles an hour that's the problem right there we're trying to go faster than when god's moving so we're trying to do this and get into this and then we go here and then we go there the problem is we don't get steal before god that's the problem we have a little prayer say oh lord you know bless this time i thank you lord jesus and we're going with our day it's not just about checking the box not about checking the box what it's about just getting still with the lord and say lord i'm here to meet with you i want to get to know you in a special way and the thing is we have to not just read the word but live that word we're reading the spirit jesus has to bring his spirit and bring that word to life before you and that's the key right that we have to do on a daily basis and not just about reading it's like it's some encyclopedia or some some book of knowledge because now it's puff it's up right so you guys can be seated i'm sorry let you guys be seated forgive me guys so the problem is we make ourselves too busy for god we want to do we want to do we want to do the problem is we want to fit god into our schedule and the thing is he doesn't want to fit into our schedule he wants to be the center of your life and not just one day a week not just two days a week not just three days but seven days a week don't just wait to meet him at church but meet him every day in your homes in your cars at your job bring him with you everywhere you go that's what he wants to be anything don't just pencil him in every once in a while but make him a first thing i do in the morning get out of my bed and i get right in my knees because i know my evil wicked flesh doesn't want to serve them and if it does want to serve it wants to serve them in the the bare minimalist you know so the thing is the when the enemy what's the enemy's job is to overwhelm you to get you distracted off your off your path then once your enemy wants to get you distracted from the lord he wants you to take a substitute that's what he wants to do he wants us to have a religion was a covering and a lot of people he's fooled with that you know they just have a covering they don't have a the real life they that christ wants them to have they have a covering so let's go to luke 21 34. read over there so luke 21 34. so and take heed to yourselves let's say any times your hearts be overcharged with surfetting and drunkenness and the cares of this life and so the day so the day come upon you unawares for as a snare shall come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray always you know it says pray always doesn't say pray sometimes we pray fifty percent of time but pray always even paul said pray without ceasing uh that you may be accounted worthy to escape all things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man so i looked the word up surf editing i just was curious what it meant so it's the act of feeding to excess gluttony so you can be feeding on fear be feeding on too much politics just be feeding on too many woes in your life the thing is we're not here to look at the problems in our life but the god inside of you can handle all the problems that you're facing so so i like the word overcharged or because you know overcharge like if you overcharge a circuit the fuse is going to blow so if you're overcharged with fear and worry then you're going to blow because you're because you're not going to the right source you're not going to the refuge to the tower so so let's let's not get ourselves overcharged with pressure of this life anymore let us take a stand and say lord i'm not letting i'm not looking at the problems in my life but i'm looking to you who can help me through these problems in my life and the thing is and the reason why the world's in its condition it is today they're looking for relief they're looking for a cure all this stress and destruction in their life all this pressure suicide rates are going up depression is going up going to psychiatrists is more and all these other things and the thing is they're turning to the wrong things they're turning alcohol they're turning cigarettes they're turning pornography other drugs they're trying to make more money they're trying to fulfill that void with with men are trying to fill the void with more women and women with more men see they're trying to think that this temporal satisfaction is going to make them whole but what it is is just like putting a band-aid over your heart or you know you're getting shot and put abandoned over a gun wound a fatal gun was not going to help and the thing is we're not here to find something temporary we're here to find something that will have rest unto our souls people are looking for rest into their souls but they're looking to the wrong things until you meet and have a personal experience with jesus christ you will never be whole or complete you never will just because there's no substitute that's what satan's trying to get them to get is a substitute and the thing is they don't realize like i said before they're putting a patch on their heart just like when a kid was told to clean his room you know you put underneath the bed put in your closet and the thing is your room is still dirty but you just you know you're just putting it in a little spot and hiding it away so and the thing is you're going to have to clean the room eventually so let's go to psalm 62 8. we just want to just really point to the lord he's a refuge he's a tower he's a fortress praise the lord 62 verse 8 so it says trust in him at all times notice that trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us sila i'll read that one more time trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him we gotta think like this when jesus christ is on this earth he was tempted beyond all measure he knows he went through sickness he went through sadness he went through loss of somebody loss of a close friend so he knows exactly what you're feeling and he can relate to you he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities so don't ever think that god doesn't know what you're feeling because he was once in flesh it's like you and i and he he overcame everything for you so let's go to we'll go to psalms 119. psalms 119 verse 114. and that one says thou are my hiding place and my shield so he's your hiding place don't just wait until the time of trouble to go hide away with him but do it in the good times a lot of times as human beings you know we kind of put god off to the side when times are prospered times are good and then when times of you know trials and tribulations come we it takes us by surprise because we haven't been spending that in the spirit time with him and your walk is a daily walk like i said before it's not a you know just when times are bad walk but it's a it's a daily walk i remember this quote that a minister said he said his prayer your steering wheel or your spare tire you know because prayer should be leading your life it should be a steering wheel of your life a lot of people just wait you know use that spare tire for prayer you know when they need it but that's not how a walk is that's not a personal relationship so let's go back we'll go spend a little time in the book of psalms kyle i just love how david just really points to god being a refuge to being a tower a mighty fortress so go to 40 psalms 46 it's a few pages back and we'll read verses 1 through 7. so it says right right off the bat he says god is our refuge and strength is a very present help in trouble so he's your refuge he's your strength a very present of help and trouble therefore will we not fear though the earth be removed though the trials may come or the devil tries to capsize your ship says don't fear and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters therefore roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with swelling thereof sila though there was one more time though the waters therefore roar and be troubled though your family forsakes you though your friends forsake you don't let this may you don't let that take you off your course the walk is between you and jesus not between you your friend and jesus not you and your wife and jesus but it's a straight narrow for only you and him there is a river the stream's warfare shall make glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right and early the heathen rage the kings were moved he uttered his voice and the earth melted politics are going crazy democrats republicans i don't care who they are they're all going crazy this world is going crazy it's insane it's insanity the lord is the lord of hosts is with us remember that the lord is host is with us he's with each one of you he's not a respecter of persons the god of jacob is our refuge selah remember he's your refuge so let's go to psalms 91. praise god so we'll read uh verses 1 through 6 and then we'll jump to 14-16 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of almighty i pray that you're dwelling in the secret place of the most high i will say of the lord he is my what my refuge my fortress my god in him will i trust it doesn't say i'm i'm going to trust in the world i'm going to trust in a b and c but i'm going to trust in him surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the nonsense of the pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers under his wings thou shalt trust him his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flies by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wastes at that noon day verse 14 we're going to jump to because he had set his love upon me therefore i deliver him i will set him on high because he has known my name he's speaking to you because he has set his love upon me therefore i deliver him if you're looking for deliverance tonight set your love upon him so the scripture's telling us right there because he knoweth my name he shall call upon me and i will answer i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honor him that's a promise right there to each one of you he's going to do that with long life will i satisfy him and shoot him my salvation so the problem is in this world people are putting their faith in the wrong things they're building they're building a house on sinking sands and jesus told us in matthew 7 24 about to too end of it too a parable about building your house on a rock or a sand we're going to get into it a little bit right now actually so go to matthew 7 24 and read those three verses praise god so matthew 7 24 it says therefore it says whosoever heareth thee sayings of mine and do with them i will liken unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew so the trials came uh his family maybe forsaked him his friends maybe talked behind his back but it says and it beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock so your walk must be founded upon faith faith is your foundation if you don't have faith in your walk then you have no walk it's gonna fall every time everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and do with them not shall be likened until a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew the house may have stood for a little time but when the trial the enemy started coming and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it so i prayed tonight this morning that your that your walk is built upon a rock and once again like i said before they're looking for a substitute it will never get the job done they don't even realize that they don't even have the the revelation of the true revelation of john 3 16 through 21 because if they did it's not just i give my heart to you lord and i can do whatever i want but it's your life should prove john 3 16 through 21. and let's read that actually i just it's probably one of the most quoted scriptures and probably one of the most scriptures that is they don't know the revelation of it because the new revelation of it like i said they'll be living it so we'll start john 15 that's whosoever in him sorry that whosoever believeth in him should not perish notice it says should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life so he died for everyone in the world from adam on down to whoever is going to be born in the future he bore all their sins every every sin that you would commit he bore it for you because he loved you he knew the pain and agony it would take but he loved you so much he wanted to die for you to have a personal relationship with you he died for you that blood that was shed cleanses you of all sins and he did that so that the holy spirit could come back in and live in you so you can have an eternal fellowship with him so let's go to verse 17. for god sent sic god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but the world through him might be saved look at that might be saved he knew he knew that everybody wasn't going to accept him in that full walk but he still reached out that hand and gave them opportunity to accept him that's true love that's what true love is people have a definition what love is but true love is john 3 16. and you'll only know what true love is when god comes into your life and just shows you that love and you experience that love that's when you got to know what true love is because you know human love has its limits it has its flaws but god's love agape love like paul spoke in first corinthians 13. it's perfect it's perfect love so verse uh sorry verse 18. yet again he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he had not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god he's the way he's the life he's the truth you can't go any other way you can't so and this is condemnation that light is coming to the world and men love darkness rather than light so as our carnal nature we were born in darkness we love darkness we gravitated towards darkness that's what jesus said earlier in this chapter you must be born again your nature has to be changed you can't even see the kingdom of god until your nature has changed from the inside just like he spoke over and i believe ezekiel he wants to give you a new heart he wants to give you a new spirit a lot of people stop at that thinking that that's that's god's spirit inside him he says i want to give you a new heart a new spirit and then i'll put my spirit upon you and then you can do my commandments and my statues see his commandments aren't grievous but if you're not truly born again and filled with the holy spirit then they will be grievous because thing is it's not he wants to write the laws upon your heart he wants to in the old testament he they would circumcise was that was the type of the holy circumcised in the flesh but now he wants to circumcise your heart that's his desire and those laws and commandments and statutes you're going to do them naturally now but still you have to crucify your flesh daily you still have to do that just because you get the holy ghost doesn't mean everything's all hunky-dory you're stealing these carnal fleshly bodies either put it under subjection even in corinthians it talks about put every thought in the subject subjects of christ if you want the mind of christ this doesn't appear like some magic wand you have to fight for it you have to fight for that mind because satan's constantly trying to input thoughts in your mind ideas and you have to cast them out don't let them stay in there we'll finish this up for everyone that do with evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth the truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that are wrought in god so let me read a couple quotes uh there you are but we're going right on doing it why we're trying to find something to quiet quiet some anesthetic it seems like the world is in a break next speed i don't know what they mean but there's a christian anesthetic there is the opium that comes from a lily and the christian church has some opium and it's from the lily of the valley amen uh-huh sue's all the pains and it's all over then when you get this christian opium this new wine that they had in the day of pentecost that holy spirit it soothes the pain people so arrogant they're doing this and that they ought not to instead of trying to get rid of the cause they're just putting another cause with it it's like when you have a problem in your life and you have to solve it and the thing is when you we want to solve the problem you want to add more problems to it situation because you're just making the problem the situation works so instead of trying to get rid of the cause they're just putting another cause with it you can never find the cure and to get rid of the cause amen man is trying to find something to satisfy any thirst god see things people don't realize every human being this whole entire world god has put it a a thirst in them for god but it's up for them to choose whether they want to seek after god or things of the world everybody's thirsting for something and then we realize that god has placed that thirst inside of him but man is choosing to thirst after things of the world to try to satisfy that thirst inside of him and it's never ever going to get the job done see he was built that way but god built him that way so he thirst after him but he tries to satisfy and hush that holy call on him with things of the world and we have no right to do that now but people do wrong constantly instead of going to the place to get rid of the cause we try to hush it with anesthetics liquor and smoking and putting more to heaping up all the time making it worse and all this builds up the pressure it just makes it worse all the time so this world is just built upon pressure it's going to blow up one of these days the world built full of pressure and doctors don't know what to do about it the psychiatrist has got psychiatrists doctoring them that's right they don't have the answer but god does god has to answer all this people are thinking aau meetings are going to solve the problem you know and the thing is you got to put god in the forefront of that equation i'm not saying you can't go to counseling or this or that but if you think that the counseling is going to be your sole savior it's not you need more than that you got to have a personal experience with jesus christ and uh tonight this morning we'll just expose the enemy you know there's giants in our lives that we've been letting just stay in our lives of addiction fear complacency pride sickness pains grudges unbelief an up and down mind see the lord has not called you and i to coexist with the devil he hasn't the lord has not called us to coexist with those giants i think the problem is we just get too comfortable with with these vices addictions in our life and we kind of getting a thing of that we can't overcome it we may not say that outwardly but the thing is we just been living it we get used to living with it we're so used to it don't ever get used to living with the devil don't ever don't ever praise the lord that you've overcome things in your life i'm thankful for that but overcome these giants in your life right now because if that same god could deliver you from those things in the past he can deliver you from these things right now in your life so let's go to oh sorry let's go to romans chapter 5 chapter sorry let's go romans chapter 13 verse 11. i couldn't read my writing for a second so romans 13. we read that so the thing is so the thing is it's high time for you to overcome these things in your life that you've been living with it's high time to awake there's something in my life that i've been dealing with for a long time i i said like a week and a half ago or a week ago i'm overcoming this i don't care i don't care what it takes and the thing is when you're trying to overcome something you can't just expect the lord just to wave some magic wand you you play a part in it you got to show the lord that you really want deliverance you have to step foot on it you have to step out and say lord i'm if i have to stop this right now cold turkey i'm going to do it i remember in my life when i had addiction for 12 plus years and i literally just i remember one week it was like 2017 i just stopped it and i just every time i had a temptation or an urge i'll just pray to the lord every time and i remember one year in 2018 the next year i can't tell you the exact date but i remember that that addiction that i had i lost all desire to do it it just it just lifted away like the my shackle i was in chains of shackles and they just lifted off and i just felt free and tonight my brother and sister you can be free too i don't care what you're going through you can tell me every excuse in the book but you can overcome this thing that's in your life and you know what it is i don't know what it is but you do the lord knows what it is and he's come he wants to deliver you he wants you to overcome it doesn't want you just to stay in that situation amen amen praise god amen so we'll go to romans uh 13 and we'll reach out to verse 11. and that now knowing the time that now it's high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore what does it say cast off the works of darkness let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantedness not in strife and envy but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof i'll read it one more time but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof satan wants you to fulfill the lust of the flesh see the thing is sin feels good to the flesh it stimulates the flesh like wine and the thing is the more you can crucify your flesh daily hourly minutely secondly the more you can realize and see what god's perfect will is for your life let's go to revelations 3 20 again so it says behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and what's up with him and he with me to him that overcometh while i grant to sit with me in my throne it's calling us to overcome right here to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne the thing is you have to be submissive and surrender to god and the overcomer inside he's going to overcome help you overcome that problem but you have to show him that you mean business that you're serious he had he they have an ear he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit's saying to the churches and we turn to revelations 21 7. and we'll actually go verse 6 and he said unto me it is done i am the alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is the thirst of the fountain of water of life freely i pray that you're thirsty this morning for that water of life he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son noah says he that overcometh shall inherit all things so you're called to overcome the scriptures constantly telling us we're here to overcome satan is a defeated creature all his powers are stripped from him at calvary and he only has a he only has power if you give him power that's the thing if you let your vessel be willing to him and open him he's going to come in just like that parable jesus spoke of when that man was cast was cast all these demons out of him and his house was you know clean and garnished but he never got filled with the holy spirit and it was seven other worst spirits that came into him and his state was worse this time than it was from the last so my brother and sister let's get cleaned out clean these giants out your life you don't have to have a perverted mind you have to have a mind that's up and down you don't have to have fear doubts and all these things you can cast them out you can overcome these giants in your life like say we want to expose the enemy he hates to be exposed let's expose him he has no right to be in your life and to stay in your life so now i always love the story of david and goliath so when david met the giant in his life this is a giant his life see the armies of israel they were terrified of goliath he was probably 10 feet tall he was trained up from his youth probably very strong and very you know and very scary to look at but the thing is he was not see david wasn't trying to co-exist with the giant he knew that giant was defying the armies of the living god and he he told the giant like it was and let's read that story i always loved that story because they was just a man like you and me he was he wasn't some super being or this or that but he was a man like you flesh and blood just like you and i so first samuel 17 we'll read that little i love that little story it's not a story but it's it's true it's you can overcome just like he did so first samuel 17 and we'll start with verse 11. so it says when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistines they were dismayed and greatly afraid they were scared of this giant and go to verse 23 and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion the philistine of gath goliath by name are the armies of the philistines and spake according to the same words and david heard them and all the men in israel when they saw the man fled from him and were so afraid so fear was just in the midst of them they were just terrified they won other battles but they were kind of like the children of israel they thought they couldn't overcome these this giant in their life and the minimum israel said have you seen this man that has come up surely to defy israel as he come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in israel and david said to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the reproach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that should defy the army's living god say the same thing in the life of your giant who is this uncircumcised giant in my life that's trying to take my strength and my joy away and the people answering him after this man are saying so shall be done to the man that killeth him and we'll go to verse 33. and saul said to david thou are not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for the hour but a youth and he a man of war from his youth see man likes to look on the outward appearance of a man but it's the inward that really matters the inward man is what's going to help you overcome not that outward man because they said this bible said dave was ruddy i had a fair countenance he's probably like a little shrimp for all we know but you know but god doesn't care if you have big muscles or if you don't have big muscles he cares about the condition of your heart if you really love him that's what he cares about verse 35 verse 35 and i went out after him i'm sorry verse 34 and david said unto saul thy servant kept his father's sheep there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of his flock and i went out after him and smote him and delivered out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him thy servant slew both the lion and the bear see he was going back to his victories and saying that if the lord delivered me and helped me with this then i can overcome the same giant that's in my life right now so as i serve and slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine should be one of them saying he had he defiled the armies of the living god david said moreover the lord delivered me out of the paul of the lion and are the paul the bear and what he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine and saul said unto david go and the lord be with you go to verse 30 9 now and david gird his sword upon his armor and a say to go for he had not proved it and david said unto saul i cannot go with these for i have not proved them and david put them off he didn't want this ecclesiastical armor he didn't want that he knew what god has given him inside of him is all he needed and he took his staff and his hand and chose him five smooth stones notice jesus is five letters faith is five letters you gotta have faith in jesus to overcome and david knew he had faith in god to overcome so remember that same thing david is god is not respecter of persons you get the same faith like david did in god you can have the same faith and strength to overcome took his bag and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had even in a script and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the philistine and the philistine came and drew near unto david and the man bare the shield went before him and when philistine looked about and saw david he disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair countenance and the philistines said unto david am i a dog that cometh to me with staves and the philistine curse david by his gods and the philistines said to david come to me and i will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field then said david to the philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield i love this right here but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou has to follow come to a giant just like that i come in the name of lord jesus christ he's defeated you you're weak you're a defeated creature you'll no longer take a hold of my life anymore i refuse to coexist with you i refuse for you to be in my mind anymore i'm casting you out so he said i would verse 47 and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword not and not spear for the bow is the lord's and he will give you into our hands and it came to pass when the philistines arose and came and drew to meet david that david hastened and ran toward the army and he ran to meet the philistine and david put his hand in his bag and took them to a stone and slang it and smote the philistine in his forehead and the stones sunk into his fort and he fell upon his face to the earth verse 50. so david what prevailed over the philistine with a sling with a stone and when they smote and smote the philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of david therefore david ran and stood upon the philistine and took his sword and drew it out of the sheath and slew it and cut off his head there with and when the philistines saw their champion was dead they fled so we we defeat the enemy he's gonna fl he's gonna flee so like i said don't let the uncircumcised goliath run in your life don't let don't let him call the shots in your life jesus christ is calling you to overcome that giant not to live in fear with it you expose the devil you take a stand and say i'm not living this i'm not living this life anymore i refuse to be a victim no longer don't make yourself a victim a lot of people in this world like to play the victim role and that's why they never can ever grow out of it because they're constantly trying to uh portray the people that i'm a victim you know i'm a victim i'm a victim and that spirit will never help you get anywhere go revelations 12. praise god revelation is 12. we're at 12 11 we're going to go to and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb that's the only way you're going to overcome brother and sister is by his blood his blood that was shed on calvary they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and said i love his part and they love not their lives unto death a lot of people are loving their life so much and they want to put god in certain increments certain parts in their life but this is a sold out life because they literally if you look at the apostles they literally devoted their life to death for the cause of jesus christ they didn't care if they'd be thrown in prison even paul probably wrote most of his letters in prison being stoned being rejected didn't have a lot of friends but he didn't care if it was to win this one soul one soul was worth more than ten thousand worlds remember that if you all heaven rejoices for one sin center repentance amen so i just love that that's just i love that scripture so how can you obtain the mind of christ if you're letting the devil roam around your land the mind of christ is key something we want daily how can you know how to walk worthy humbly in in god's perfect will if you don't have the mind of christ the mind of christ is going to lead you to god's will it's going to help you be more aware see the problem is we have to be more aware and sensitive when the lord's moving the lord is constantly trying to talk to us but we're going a million miles an hour you know anything is get still before god that's the key right there get still and know that i am god that's what he said see we always get what we expect anything well then they usually get what you look for it's the mental attitude you have remember this and never forget it this is from 1950 expectation remember this and never forget it the right mental attitude towards any promise of god will bring it to pass the right mental attitude towards any promise of god it doesn't take gifts of healing to heal sick people any person in here has the right to meet satan anywhere if you're a christian and defeat him on any grounds that he can stand on remember that anybody in here you gotta have faith faith is so key the right attitude a lot of people don't have the right attitude that's why they don't receive from god have that right mental attitude is so key because the word goes into your head into your heart has to pass through there first and go into here so there's another quote from just letting off the pressure from 63. if they're born again they cannot impersonate because they are built for those things they're born regenerated remolded not just something that's patched up and shook on hands got emotion danced on a altar a few times and says i got it it's something that's been remolded regenerated we're called to be regenerated we're trying to get back into the image once we once were before the fall and become a new creature then it can stand the pressures of the persecutions and things that follow the spiritual life you've got to be made and built to stand in the pressure and the only thing that can do it that's when you come into god's molding house right you're in god's morning house right now that's right he wants to mold you he wants to shape you he wants to see more of his image in you he wants to be that masterpiece he wants to make that masterpiece and be torn down and rebuilt that's how you got to be torn down god wants to beat the world out of you and you become a new creature in christ all things become new i'm inside of a tower i don't have no desire to even look out he puts his hands to the plow and even turns back to look is not worthy of plowing what a place to come yes outside you die inside your safe just come in and let off the pressures there's been pressures in your life come into the molding house come into that refuge come into that tower encourages all of us and christ is our tower yes god's provided place of what safety joshua built these those houses in those cities of refuge and god built us a city of refuge that's in his son christ jesus the name of the lord is a mighty tower and the righteous run into it and are safe say it with me the name of the lord is a mighty tower and the righteous run into it and are safe now you say what if i get sick in here he bore our sickness in this tower amen that we're in he bore our sickness and his body we have well you say what if i get weary when you're in there all cares and things cast your cares upon him it's rolled on every wall all the way around every door cast your cares upon him because he cares for you trust in his promised word his words are written on your heart our table our hearts are the tables of his word like martha and mary and all along see there we have in common we have christ christ is our refuge amen amen amen that's the kind of land where he's so worried people don't get to know what to do they say well this is right is that right christ is right is this the way is that the way he said i am the way which is truth this or that jesus said i'm the truth the way the truth the life see we've quit worrying about that that way builds up pressure the trouble of it is today the people don't have time to get to get before god and get still they've got so many things to do they got to they belong to this they got to do this they got to have this they got to go up here you don't even have time right here the devil just took up all your time that's what he's trying to do he's trying to take up all your time he's trying to make you so busy that you just fit god in in certain places and the thing is you have to take a stand see satan isn't going to just move over because you're a christian he's not satan doesn't care he wants to see if you have the real the real goods that's what he's trying to see because he knows we don't have real goods so the thing is you don't have time to get still before god and get quiet do you ever just get go out in the morning after the night has passed early in the morning also it blossoms to get fragrance and did you ever go early for a morning to define the fragrance you find out that early morning when you get out the dew is hanging low the trees are budding the blossoms are coming the perfume go along the road and smell the honeysicles into the rose gardens early in the morning that's why it's been quiet nature has through the night it's got to go quiet got to be quiet and god bathed it with refreshing that's the way you need to do is get away and get quiet before god so he can bathe you with a refreshment from heaven amen get alone to yourself close the doors pull them together and say now lord here i am in your presence that's how that's how personal real has to be get alone get along in your prayer class get your knees and say lord i'm meeting with you i want to hear your voice speak back to me i'm not leaving my knees until i get more of your holy spirit i'm not leaving my knees until i've overcome this addiction that's how serious it has to be it's not just some some game but it's a series this is life or death you can't be an effective as god wants you in his kingdom if you have these things roaming around your life these things are hindrance they're roadblocks but a roadblock is a temporary thing don't let this become a wall take that roadblock out kick that roadblock out remember after all your nature and after all nature gets quiet and still then the dew begins to fall that refreshes and brings forth life we need more life jesus died for us that we have life life and life more abundantly that's what he died for and your nature yourself when you get quiet and still before god then the dew of heaven begins to fall and begins to refresh amen let's go to psalms 27. praise god psalms 27 uh we'll start with verse one and we'll end with verse five the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell that's what the enemy should get so in love with god so sold out that the enemy doesn't know what to do with you that's how it has to be that he doesn't even know he's scratching his head trying to come up with another plan though a host should have kept me a camp against me my heart shall not fear notice that all these excuses that this person could use but he's not he's saying all these things that come against me i'm still not going to fear i know god is my strength he's my life the war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing have i desired the lord that will i seek after you have to seek after this that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life you have to speak at that seek after that daily dwell on his don't just wait till church to dwell in his house but all the days of your life like i said at home on the way to church and away from church in work while you're doing your work all these things you can you can do all in that house all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and inquire in his temple right here from the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall we hide me he shall set me upon a rock amen amen let's go to psalms 28. let's pass it and we'll reverse one and seven unto thee will i cry oh lord my rock be not silent to me blessed thou be silent to me i become like them that go down to the pit i said david has desperation right there he wants to hear from the lord he's crying out to the lord he's not leaving his prayer closet until he hears from the lord amen we'll go to verse seven now if he knows david saying like saying this a lot the lord is my strength because he is lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him and i am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoice joseph and with the song will i praise him we'll go to verse 8 the lord is their strength and he is the saving strength of his anointing save thy people and bless thy inheritance feed them also and lift them up forever amen amen amen amen so we have a place so we have a place where we can rest and we'll read it in proverbs 18 10. 18 10 and says the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it in a safe when the world tries to capsize your ship the name of the lord is a strong tower and the righteous runs into it and is safe when the enemy is trying to throw every dart at you lift up that mighty shield of faith when your family forsakes you the name of the lord is a strong tower and the righteous runneth into it and is safe when the enemy is trying to get you frustrated and confused remember what it feels like when you're back against the wall and you're not alone remember you are not alone he said i'll be with you and in you and to the end of the world remember the name of the lord is a strong tower and the righteous run it into it and it's safe when the enemy when the enemy says you can't get the holy ghost remember the enemy is a liar stay on your knees in prayer and say lord i'm not leaving until i receive your holy ghost i'm not leaving until i meet every requirement to receive the holy ghost and if you already have the holy ghost get bored get your knees to get more holy ghost look in the book of acts the apostles got filled again with the holy ghost and he gave him boldness to go and speak that gospel that's what we need is boldness to go speak this gospel we don't need this we're not trying to make some mark convert or some brother roger convert we're trying to make a jesus christ convert you got to lead them to jesus christ he's the only way he's going to change their lives you can't change that person's life i can't change that person's life but jesus christ can if you lead him to the source to that fountain there is a fountain that's filled with blood so let's let's leave these these people to christ and it's up to them to make that decision i can't give anybody revelation you can't but the very god of heaven given revelation so you ask if you want to get a true convert you got to leave in jesus christ you have to you have to that's the only way so praise god so remember the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and are safe i like this song in the presence of jehovah we don't sing the uh the verses but this one is really just kind of hits home through his love the lord provided a place for us to rest a place to find the answers in the hour of distress now there's never any reason for you to give up in despair just slip away and breathe his name for he will surely meet you there i'll always love that if you have heartaches if you have pain you have suffering meet with him in that secret place prayer is so important in this day and age the enemy is constantly trying to get us to take any other substitute but prayer but we can get impr that's where your strength comes from it's a direct connection with the throne room between you and jesus bow at the master's feet he hears your every heart's cry he knows what you're going through but the thing is you have to submit to him if you look let's go a couple more scriptures i'm going to go to i'm sorry it's not on the notes but hey laura's pulling me to i'm not going to say sorry so let's go let's go to james 4. james 4 verse 6. he giveth more grace wherefore you saith god resisted the proud but give the grace unto the humble so pride likes to act like humility pride likes to lift itself up pride says i'm good at this you know i'm better than you it may not say those exact words but the way it conducts itself the way it lives it doesn't edify a person it actually pulls a person down so he said he give the grace unto the humble says submit yourselves therefore to god so if you want to overcome that john your life first you got to submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you because he knows that your strength can't defeat him but he knows that jesus christ strength will defeat him ten times out of ten not nine times but ten times out of ten verse uh so verse eight draw nigh to god and he will draw that's the key right there that's a formula you gotta draw now to god first then he'll draw an eye to you cleanse your hand this is the part you play cleanse your hands these centers and purify your hearts you double-minded a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways you can't waver to here way over there you gotta have a perfect balance stay right in the middle that straighten arrow is right down the middle says be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning in your joy to heaviness verse 10 right here so key humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up humble yourselves you play as you right there you play that part you got to humble yourself in the mighty hand of jesus christ let's go with the first peter i believe 3 15 i believe or sorry first peter five five through seven sorry first peter five five through nine will read so it says likewise younger submit yourself there yourself therefore unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be what clothed with humility for god resisted the proud and give the grace unto the humble once again he's saying the same same thing god resisted the proud and give the grace unto the humble so if you have a prideful spirit god can never get a hold of you he can never mold you he can never shape you the way he wants to you have to get rid of that pride first god even hates a proud look it says in the word in proverbs it says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god if you look this is pointing us to humble ourselves huma you can never be too humble in the sight of god humility if you win somebody over humility is the key you have to move out the way and let jesus speak through you so humber says therefore in the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your cares upon him for he careth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a royal lion says as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplishing your brother and that in the world but the god of all grace who hath called us unto what his eternal glory by christ jesus after you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you and then we'll close with matthew 11 28. praise god matthew 11 28 says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest if you're filled and cumbered with the lord with the cares of this life if you're feeling overwhelmed he says come unto me all ye that are labor and heavy laden he says i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me fry a meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls that's the key you want rest unto your souls i don't want rest unto my flesh but into my soul because if your soul is rested it doesn't matter what happens to your body it doesn't matter if you get sick on your death bed because you know where you're going because you need that rest inside otherwise other stuff's not going to matter your is going to get healed to get sick again but if you have rest into your soul it doesn't matter for my yoke is easy and my burden is like we can let's stand and invite the musicians praise god praise god we'll sing in the presence of jehovah in the presence of jehovah [Music] prince of peace [Music] in the press [Music] if we can borrow our heads as the musicians will play that song if you just pray that if you just know the lord just spoke to you tonight if there's giants in your life that you've not overcome just lift your hand before the lord and just say lord i i've been letting these giants just roam in my land for too long and i'm not i'm not doing this any longer i'm overcoming these giants because you've called me to overcome just make a solemn dedication from this day forward you're going to do everything you can just to to really show the lord that you mean business and that you want deliverance and you're no longer going to coexist with the devil but you're gonna overcome the enemy in his evil works because he's a defeated creature the lord spoke to you tonight just rededicate your life to him i many times i've did the same thing just rededicate my life to him i want a a more deeper and serious walk this new year that's coming i mean it's february you still got plenty enough time to be better than you were six months ago a year ago and lord as we turn up our heads lord father you've done so much for us lord you've been so good to us lord you just showed your love lord and it's just transformed us and changed us lord we know that we're when you first came lord into our lives we're different people lord but we don't want to just go back from five years ago but we want to have new victories we want to have serving the newness of the spirit lord and i pray these hands that were lifted lord i pray you just give them the overcoming power they need lord give them the strength to just overcome these giants and these addictions in their life lord and lord they know that you've called them to be an overcomers lord let that word does not be some knowledge but let it be a revelation that you've called us to be overcomers lord and lord it's the overcomer overcoming inside of us let us lord from this day forth not let the enemy no longer shackle us in the uh the chains of fear but lord you've taken these shackles off lord it's like when paul and silas were in prison they were praising you and singing lord and you just took those chains off and opened that jail door lord lord made us no longer be a victim of our minds lord but let us overcome lord and just fight for that mind of christ and always ask all these things in your precious holy name lord
