TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Holy Ghost baptizer and everybody ought to tell amen everybody ought to tell amen amen that should be the thing that we we tell all the more because we only got a little bit more time to tell am brother Johnson you could see his desire to just to be used by God to tell about Jesus and I think that is a Priceless desire to I if God carries I want to wear out for Jesus If he if Jesus carries I want to wear I want to be doing all that I can do for him because he's done everything for me amen amen well God bless you today and thank you for coming and I I almost wish we could just gravitate to here but we're we're good we're good uh uh talked to brother Ron Clayton today and he sends his greetings he can't wait to get back he says I've I am ready to come back uh he says he's been live streaming but it just nothing like being here he said uh talked to brother Jeff Snodgrass he also wanted to send his greetings and to thank you all for his prayers for his wife um as she's recovering she's doing well he also wanted to thank you for your support for the Bibles that are uh the need is met um for Mala there's a number of um a couple different number of pastors that had grouped together to get the money together in hisory Church uh that he just he just been blessed the needs have been met so uh he wanted to share his Thanksgiving to you for your support and he really feels when they get the Bibles there's going to a a Revival is going to strike out over there so he's got that that Vision um brother Jason dears who who you know we're uh supporting it left today for Israel in Egypt so let's remember his trip there that God would Prosper it amen well if you have your Bibles and You' like to turn with me today to uh Psalms 23 we just want to just take a look at the Psalms in a maybe a little different light than I've ever uh seen it before uh but Psalms 23 is actually the they say the most popular and Best Loved Psalms for funerals it adds uh strength and hope uh to the Souls that are left behind um I've often uh looked at this Psalms is not just for someone that dies naturally but when they die uh uh in to their flesh to their fleshly nature their fleshly will and tonight we want to just uh take another onion another peel off the onion as it were to this Revelation and and uh look at uh psalm 23 and dying out when we come to church and it just really shines a little bit of light that I hadn't quite seen before so let's let's keep that in mind as we read this and then have we'll have a word of prayer Psalms 23 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in Paths of righteousness for his name's sake and yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen want to entitle this God's meeting place let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for the faithful that have gathered out Lord this midweek service and going through uh some much difficulty uh many uh miles Lord just to be here in your house and father there are are uh many that are are sick at home Lord that can't be here today because of sickness and Lord you see that we're a very needy people we just ask that your presence would be with us and with each family in their homes and Lord that you would you would meet with them for you promis that if just two or three would be gathered together you would be you would meet right with them in that place Lord that meeting place under the shed blood of Calvary Lord we pray that you would give us something through these scriptures that might help us to to be closer to you when we do meet with you father when we come to church break the bread of life as only you can today and Lord we'll be careful to give you the praise for all these things for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you may be seated well as we know there's been a great falling away in this hour there's also been a great falling away from the church and after Co had hit uh more people stay away from church than ever before but God has minished the True Believer to endure to the end to be faithful to the end to hold our begin in confidence steadfast to the end Hebrews tells us 10: 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but to exhort one another to exhort one another that puts the responsibility in all of us amen and so much the more as you see the day approaching amen well we know the day is approaching amen I'll be before we can meet God we have learned through the message that God has some requirements we just can't approach god with some any old attitude and expect his grace that's right James 4:6 says wherefore he saith he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble amen so we've got to approach him uh humbly amen amen can you say amen and another thing that we want to think about is even though he is he has told us to cast our cares upon Him coming to church is not all about us in other words God has a will for our lives and we need to remember that when we come into God's house now Psalms 100 verse2 says serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know ye that the Lord he is God he it is that made us and we and and not we ourselves we are his people the Sheep of his pasture and look at this enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good as Mercy is Everlasting his truth endureth to all generations so we see here there is a a an entrance that needs to be made when we come into the presence of God uh we just can't come without this because this is a requirement we know the Old Testament they had to make sacrifices for their sins before they could before they could enter in further into the sanctuary is that a true statement amen and we know that Christ became our Eternal sacrifice so we do not offer those types of sacrifices now our sacrifice is now giving thanks to the one who made that Sacrifice by entering into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise Hebrews 13 F 15 says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for what such sacrifices God is well please I think sometimes we can come to church and we can forget about to praise Him forget to communicate to him the way that we should see it's not about just us coming to church for what we want it's about coming to church to give God what he's worthy amen amen verse 17 obey them which have the rule over you and submit yourselves uh for they watch for your souls as they must give an account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for it is unprofitable for you so coming to church without being prepared to offer your best sacrifice to God is being proud I hate to say it you may be tired you may feel like I just had a bad day you it does not matter God deserves to be praised that's it that's all there is to it there's there's nothing more to the situation it just doesn't matter God deserves to be praised no does not matter how we feel and if we come without that sacrifice and we come with that I say it's a proud Spirit we just don't recognize it God has every right to resist our request whatever reason we've come to church Jesus himself said the father is is searching for them that will worship Him in spirit and in truth so God is looking for that God is looking for that praise we got to be on the same page with God and give him that praise when we come in to meet with God Amen so now we've entered into church with this sobering humble Spirit we've come in with grateful Hearts we've come in with praise we've come in with Thanksgiving we come in with gladness I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord and and we have this reverence and this great resp respect for God's word and now we enter into the Psalms the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want amen this reverence this respect it's not about what I want it's about what he wants for me that's right Jesus said in John 10:14 I am the Good Shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine so there's there is some sort of connection there's a deep calling to the Deep we know the voice of God it's his word right and when the word is spoken to the Sheep they catch it so there's a communication going on John 10:7 then said Jesus unto them verily verily I say you I am the door of the sheep I am the door in other words if we want to meet with God we've got to come through Jesus Christ we've got to come through the word we've got to come through him it's not how we feel what we think we have no specialness with God we all come to the door amen all that ever came before me now this is think about this verse eight all that ever came before me they're thieves and robbers in other words they may say the Lord is my shepherd I want they don't they they they're not coming to church with the right motive I'm sorry you know we can come to church and said well he'll give me the desire of my heart and and we can lay this whole list but there's more to church than that that's all I'm saying there's more to church than that coming to commune with god with selfish reasons all that ever came before me in other words the people are coming before the Lord but they're coming with selfish reasons and we think it's it's okay I'm still coming to God he ought to be happy with me he's happy when we have this reverence and respect that the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want we can't deviate from that when we come into the house of the Lord he said I am the door and by me if any man will enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find green pasture but that's what we do when we come to to God's house to hear the word right is to feed on the word after Jesus foretold that he was going to suffer many things and be rejected he said to all the people in Luke 9 verse 23 If any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me in other words Jesus was teaching them right there cuz he is the shepherd he's the Good Shepherd he's the great shepherd He Is Our Shepherd he was teaching them not to want to deny yourself it's not about our will that the Bible teaches us we should say if it would be the will the Lord will do this and we'll do that now I'm just going to do this no if it would be the will of God because not everything that I thought was the will of God for me was the will of God in fact I found out it was wrong and it got me in trouble look what happened to uh Sarah and Abraham and Hagar thought it was the will of the Lord so it's a serious thing the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want now notice this verse two verse two he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me into Paths of righteousness for his name's sake It's All About Him leading me to the house of God Amen I'm so grateful that the Lord is the really the one that's in control of the Bride amen he maketh me to lie down in other words our flesh is flesh if our flesh had its way we wouldn't be here at church today it's a truth if we thought we could get away and and and being the bride and and and and and and and only have to go to church you know once or twice a year I believe that there would be a group now that would believe that and only do that not the Bride of course but you understand because we're all we're like a mix we're we're mixed but it's he that maketh us to lie down in Green Pastures he's the one that's leading us you know we we come into church and no matter how busy the day is we all sudden we just we just sit and we subject ourself to the word we just calm down it's him leading Us beside Still Waters we don't have to worry about somebody coming in here and and doing jumping jacks and you know making a a confusion in the church because God is leading us to a place of order amen and look at this verse three he restoreth my soul every time we come into the church we hear the word of God God's word is being preached to us our nature is being changed what is happening he's restoring it isn't just uh it isn't just well he saved my soul back at Calvary he saved my soul you know 10 years ago when I got baptized no that every time we are changed by uh from from one Glory unto another when the word is being preached if you really receive that word into your heart it will change your character amen it will change you and it will restore your soul to be just like the the the character of Jesus Christ he leadeth me in Paths of righteousness so we here we're going to hear the word of God if we believe the word of God that word that he's speaking to us is going to lead us in a path of righteous living when we leave here Psalms to me happens when we go to church I believe that now the purpose of meeting God hey I want us to think about our purpose and the purpose of meeting with God as the high priest as the priest would go further into the Tabernacle remember it was you had the outside Court the inner court or the holy place and then then you had the holiest of holies now as you enter deeper into the Tabernacle shall we say the holiest of holies it is a type of when we come in to here that we enter in deeper into the spirit of God we're no longer just sitting here in church you know brother BR talked about us being in a three- room house amen and and and he said that that that outside place where you're you're just eating uh that's just like coming to the church and you're hearing the word right but he says you want that communion to get real close you you go into the living room and you sit down and you converse with one another and you get to know one another more but he said there's no life there comes there life comes forth when you go into the bedroom and so as we come into the church we hear the word but we've got to enter deeper into the spirit of that word it's got to become personal to us or otherwise were missing the purpose of meeting with God so inside the holiest was the holiest of all was the Ark of the Covenant inside the ark was the very life of God that's where Aaron's bod uh Rod buted it was where the Mana was always fresh it never got mold and the Arc of the Covenant the the the testimony of God the word of God was inside of that and God placed a mercy seat on top of that Ark and and at uh above that or at each end of that he placed two cherubin on The Mercy Seat amen yes and he said in Exodus 25:22 and there I will meet with thee and I will commune with thee from Above The Mercy Seat from between the two cherubin which are upon the Ark of the Covenant now what's he going to commune about this is important of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel notice there's no communion going on about what they want nothing there the whole communion was what God was going to speak to them right this is an important important thing to understand when we come into church we don't reverence the word enough we don't reverence enough what God is speaking to us and I'm not saying pointing any fingers directly to you but there's a looseness of a spirit that would just have us to come into church and not reverence the word enough I say this is to me the this the reason that the serious believer comes to church because he wants to hear directly from God brother brandom said it like this we come to church to find out where we stand with God where we're at with God which is is lining up right here with these scriptures God wants to commune with us AB about his will for our personal lives he says I stand at the door and I knock If any man will hear hear his voice open the door he'll come in he'll commune there'll be that communing it's it happens here in the heart it don't happen in this building it happens in the heart the word affects the heart the what's happening inside it's bearing witness that this is the Holy Ghost this is God speaking to me if none go with me still I'll follow there's a realness that takes place sometimes our reasons for coming to church are not the same as God's in other words sometimes we act like God hasn't created us for his purpose we forget that so if I ask you the question why did the Lord lead you to this church I know sometimes I get in trouble for asking questions question sometimes but you know Jesus asked a lot of questions brother Brandon asked a lot of questions I like to ask questions to kind of provoke thoughts so you don't have to answer them but why did the Lord lead you to this church what was his purpose in doing that what you to think about that was it was it to straighten things out here was it to sit on the seat of the scornful and find fault was it just to be part of a community of Fellowship was it to have a place to feel better about yourself your choices or the lifestyle that you're that you want to live what was the reason the Lord LED you here why did the Lord lead you here why I believe it's because it's God's desire is to get us the truth the way that God works his desire his nature is literally to see all of us walking in more truth than we did yesterday that that this is a hard pill to swallow for some because we want to feel like we've achieved we're in we're there and it's not about being in or out it's about walking pleasing and we are missing part of God in our life in the aspect of walking just like he walked living just thinking like he thinks acting living for others there's we we we know that the God who created heaven lives inside of us we know that we're not missing that but we are missing being able to yield all of our life to God and the devil tells us on a regular basis that we live for God and and and we're always doing the best that we can when I know that I'm not doing the best I can so so now look it's not for me to tell you what you should be living more it's it's up to the job of the Holy Ghost to speak to our hearts and show us what we should be doing more I believe that God wants us to grow in the love of God to grow into the statue of a perfect man to keep adding the virtues of Christ to our character to keep moving on to Perfection as the ible says to walk in more truth today than we did yesterday as it were to walk in more truth than what we're presently walking and now this statement should challenge us John said in third John verse four he says I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children walk in truth and I know you know at any given time any of us could say well I'm walking in this truth but what about the other part of our life that has been refusing to do what God's been asking us to do what about that part God's concerned about that part we may not be thinking about that part that's why it gets so easy for us to come into to church sometimes why people come into church sometimes and they don't have that reverence and that respect for the word and they're going to miss out they're going to miss out on their soul being restored it really because it takes us uniting with the word yielding to the word dying to our to our fleshly will to see that character come to to manifestation God is on a mission to totally restore our soul he restoreth My Soul David said and I believe that is when our character is the character of Jesus Christ it you don't got to go through the course of a day to see well you know I kind of messed up there didn't brother bradam say we me we backslide 100 times a day all of us have no problem looking at where we could have done better right I mean just just being honest so we can see that there is a greater need for God's the preeminence of the Holy Ghost to be in our life and I believe this comes from when we receive the The Living Word Jesus said my words are spirit and they are life now we can hear the natural word we can agree with it we can read it we can memorize it but when that word becomes living now David said this statement he says I hide Thy word in my heart I hide it here in the heart so I may not sin against thee amen so you know that takes effort because the devil is trying to say oh you don't need that you're fine you're you're good but I know there's none good no not one Jesus said in John 8:31 he said to this he I'll just read it he said then Jesus then said Jesus to those which believed on him so he had a believing audience these were Believers that believed on him and he said if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed God is not a God to not give us more light he is not a God to do that his nature is to see us in His image he created man in His image he wants us to walk like he walks talk like he lay down our life like he laid down his life give give give and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free we don't got time but you know what these these these uh Pharisees were saying after this they said well we're already free you preach that to a message church and they say who are you I'm already free see that Spirit there's being honest yeah I'm free but yet I see that there's things what Paul say I I I I I go to do things that I don't want to do I want to do things but I I don't end up doing them there's there there's that battle so I think that in itself should should cause us to want to Hunger for More Of God in our lives and not just say well we're always going to be like that till the Rapture comes that's not a good attitude John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into what what's that word all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show thee show you things to come God leted us and guided us to to the to the message to the word to him how many times have we heard of people say yeah I I got baptized I I I gave my life to God and they're they're they're living in the world you know what I'm saying right but the very nature of God is to lead them into all truth he's thinking about it when they're not so the purpose that God has has done this led us to this plac is that that he could give us more light that we could walk in I believe that now the Bible says Jesus said he will show you things to come well what things what's he going to show us the most important thing I believe that he could show us is who we are the ministry the the Malachi for the message that was sent is to show the bride who she is I believe that brother bam said that God would raise up a minist the Ministries to to break things down and to to help them dig deeper so she could recognize because when she recognizes who she is then she's an invincible Army right so I believe that the things that God is trying to show us through the ministry is who we are to become who we are to become we're not there yet but and I'll tell you it's hid it's hid right because the flesh is looking for this great manifestation here and there and God said it will not be a public show it won't be it'll be hid it's going to be those who love the word who's willing to die out to the flesh to become the word 1 John 3:2 said beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is we're going to be like him I believe that's what he's trying to show us as he's opening the word this isn't just a bunch of instructions that the Bible says or the bunch of instructions that brother John wants us to do or the these ministers want us to do no this is what the bride is going to become now the foolish virgin says no way I ain't going to do that I don't have to do that are are you with me you see the two Spirits out there that are that are battling the word is showing who the bride is who she really is because remember there are many that claim brother bah told that story in the choosing of a bride where all these uh women uh thought that this Cowboy Rich Cowboy or whatever was going to marry them choose them they had this confidence yes he's going to choose me he's going to choose me but they didn't have the spirit they didn't have that humble spirit a and and and God chose that little woman just willing to take the back seat willing to keep working in the background she had character amen amen First Corinthians 2:9 I'm just going to read it you don't have to turn there you all know the scripture but as it is written ey have not seen ear is not heard neither have it entered into the heart of man the things which God had prepared for them that love him amen prise Lord look at this next verse but God have revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yeay the Deep things of God we come here God is trying to show us things that are to come in our lives the nature that we're going to have how we're going to be Overcomers amen praise God how we can not let the devil just h over us and and and and and Hold Us Down with depression and sickness and and all this stuff that he's made us more than conquerors he's showing us things to come this word is powerful amen Jesus said the spirit of truth will show us things to come and John said every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure Amen brother Braham said in the message the law having a shadow he said for God has made a sacrifice to perfect every believer that's in Jesus Christ God has made a sacrifice to perfect every believer that's in Jesus Christ Jesus is that sacrifice and every man that has this hope purifies himself he has a part to play and that's taking the word of God that we hear and obeying it right amen coming under subjection to it not well I don't know if I agree with it I don't I don't know if I see it that way I wasn't really really taught that way that just really doesn't fit into my schedule it can't do that the word is supreme over all of us right the word is the headship of all of us this church our ideas our opinions what we want what we don't want God is the head it's all there is to it the final say so for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son to the church can you say Amen all right we got to get you know we're we're missing some people here so that means we got to do double duty you know double duty with amens all right Ephesians 5:26 I hope they put this on the board Ephesians all right now look at this the word is in church for a reason he says that he might sanctify he he he gave his only begotten son to the church that he might sanctify and cleanse it I thought he did that at Calvary well the Bible says here with the washing of the Water by the word there's something that happens in church that's because of Calvary the Holy Ghost could come back upon the believer in the church right the word be becomes real to the believer can enter inside the Living Word enters inside of the believer cleanses him washes him purifies him fills him the word does a job when we come to church it's not there for knowledge we don't it's not about getting head knowledge it's not about learning another another mystery or something no it's about a cleansing that's taking place a washing so we need to feel that I need to be washed we need to know why we're here you know too often we get these hoty attitudes of just you know what I just don't feel good after that preaching do you what you're saying when you think those thoughts that he might present to himself a glorious church not having a spot not having a wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish I am not there I am not there I am not there I haven't been there but I'm pressing in that's all I know to do I don't know to do anything else Paul said who wrote 14 books that you and I preach out of that believe was still pressing towards a Mark that he hadn't attained to who am I to come into the church and feel like I'm there yes the Lord's my shepherd and here's the list of the things that I want from the Lord today what about the things the Lord wants us to do are you with me all right John 17:15 I pray Jesus praying here I pray not that thou should us take them out of the world but that thou should us keep them from the evil that's in the world verse 17 sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth we've got to look beyond what Christ did for us at Calvary and look to where Christ is at today did not brother Brandon say man has a a a paraphrasing a terrible habit he's always looking at what God did do or what God is going to do and is missing what God is trying to do right now and I understand we do not have the that that gift flowing that brother brandom had but you know what God's still here he's promised to be where just two would be gathered together in his name I want to just say this how could you think God's not here when you brought him with you God is here and he wants to accomplish his purpose and his will but we understand we've got to let this be the house that God made it for in the message hear ye him brother bam says now I want to ask you a question right here where we're at be honest don't you just feel kind of scoured out and made different he says do you he said raise your hand just feels like the Holy Spirit has just cleansed our hearts when the word just cleanses us from all we are this is the washing of the water of Separation by the word the word what washes us and cleanses us and then he quotes Jesus sanctify them Father through thy truth he said Thy word is truth is that right and we're washed of the Waters of separation from our sins by the word of God the word separates us and sets us in place he said how wonderful now I just want to just say this for a second okay we come to church we get in the prayer room and we say God would you be merciful to me and cleanse me of my sins cover me with your Holy Blood and make me ready to hear your word we do that and so we feel as prepared as we could be when we enter into the sanctuary and we come into the sanctuary and we're hearing the word and God speaks something and all a sudden your heart goes whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa because there's something there that God wants us to deal with you understand generally we can ask God to cleanse us and he will but if there's something God's wanting us to deal with it's because he wants our character to be like his and it's it's not just um to to confess that thing but to wash our life from it you understand to wa to separate there's a separation from that thing he said the Waters of Separation so it's a real meeting place that happens between us and God if I come over your house you come over my house we can just you know as it were shoot the breeze have fun talk about anything you want to talk about and we can laugh and we can have fun but when we come into God's house see this is where God has the preeminence in all of our hearts to speak his will to us Braham said in the message the Queen of Sheba he said after his finished word then he sent into the church first apostles prophets evangelist pastors and so forth in his church to perfect the church it's not to get what we want it's not to come to church with all different reasons it's for the purpose purpose he sent them for and I'm not trying to do away with casting our needs upon him I'm just trying to get the the priorities right the priority needs to be the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lay down in green presentant he leadth me besides Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in Paths of righteousness for his name's sake it's all about him getting me ready to be a bride without spot without wrinkle Psalms 34:1 says I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth and look at verse two my soul not my flesh not my carnal nature my soul shall make her boast in the Lord in other words our soul should be able to rejoice in the word even though our flesh is being corrected now look The Humble shall hear therefore and be glad well who won't be glad who won't be glad huh the proud those that those that aren't here with the right attitude with the right Spirit they're they're not going to be glad that they came amen oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together all right the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down and G pastures he leth me beside Still Water restoreth my soul he leadth me in Paths of righteousness for his name say verse four yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me God gives us his word as a staff to lean upon to help hold us up brother the Johnson was up here and he's leaning upon his staff it was given him support he lifted up in the air and said if I end up going somewhere I'm going to have to take this with me and the word of God is there so we can lean upon it amen it supports us when we're weak and we're feebleminded when we come to church he holds us up his he his his grace his word is has Grace in it when we haven't been able to pray through right he has Grace for us he has Mercy for us when we fallen short of his glory so his word is a staff that we can lean upon that Comforts us praise God but his word that comes forth over the pulpit is also a rod of correction we should have heard a lot more amens with that I I don't know what happened on that one but the the Bible said thy rod and thy staff they comfort me now we can't forget this I believe his Rod should comfort us I it's the one thing I just I just really I just love about brother vman's testimony and I don't mean to just bring him up but just just because he's made mention of it and he just feels so good when the word corrects his life it just it makes him feel closer to God that that God cares enough to to help them and uh the the word of God is a rod of Correction now we know there's going to be a great white Throne judgment right every knee is going to Bow every tongue's going to confess we're all going to the whole world's going to have to give an account to God one day and what are they going to give an account they're going to give an account whether they live their life for themsel or they live their life for God now I'm going to say the unwilling they will be there to give an account but for the genuine believer the bride of Christ does she stand there in the white Throne judgment no she's sitting with the judge and judging those who were unwilling and they're even going to be judging the Fallen Angels now the genuine bride she does go to the great Throne of judgment every time she comes to church 1 Peter 4:17 says for the time is come that judgment must begin where at the house of God Amen and if it first began at us who are willing to subject themselves to the word of God what shall the end of them that obey not the gospel and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and The Sinner appear so this this is a house of correction and to the believer they're grateful amen they've come because they want to be pleasing to God but you know the world churches have made Church something different than what it is now they want to be entertained they want to just feel good don't say anything that don't make them feel good I've heard that some preachers will not preach certain things because everybody will leave the church they're they're they want a meeting place but they're not meeting with God we we we learn in Revelations 13 they actually kick God out of the church they're having a meeting place without God they're just meeting with one another a a lodge a a a fellowship of men in other words they don't care about being pleasing to God they have need of enough the Bible says in need of nothing so when God corrects us and we take that correction willingly we say yes Lord you know what we're doing we're willingly walking through the valley of the shadow of death we're dying out to our will we're dying out to the flesh that wants to be having its own way and we have to be willing to walk that walk so when we walk through that Valley we're choosing to die out to our will when God gives us his word we're we're willingly we're choosing the harder way we're choosing to deny ourselves to pick up our cross to follow him we're choosing his word of above our flesh how beautiful it is when God looks down and he sees his children walking through the shadow of the Val the Valley of the shadow of death I believe it's pleasing to God our natural our fleshly nature is literally dying out before his eyes because we're resisting our will and we're surrendering our will to God's word I believe he's pleased with it we just have to keep willing to come to church and walk through that Valley of the shadow of death amen now look what he says here when we're hearing the word and we're the word is telling us to to to do his will to die out to our fleshly wanting to just use our time and consume it for ourself he says I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me we don't have to fear walking through this Valley just because it hurts us and we don't get to do what we want to do we don't get to make the plans we want and we don't it's okay it's okay he's with you I wouldn't trade that for anything I'd give everything up but I could not give up him couldn't give up this word the correction of God ought to comfort us I'm not going to fear what God wants me to do I believe the Bible says great peace have they that love thy law and nothing shall offend them they're so in love with the word so when we come to church God has prepared a message for us God has a table spread where the saints of God are fed come and dine the master cth amen it's a five course meal as it were I believe it has everything that God wants us to have amen now sometimes you know this little children when they're up at the table and it's time to eat um uh children that are immature they will say something like this oh do we have to eat that I wanted to I wanted this right are you with me we all seen it but not the adults the adults are correcting the children they're saying this is what we have to eat today let's be thankful for what we have and let's eat this are you with me but it ain't no different when we come to church you can tell often who are the immature ones who don't want to eat the word you can and then you can tell the mature ones the mature ones they're always saying thank you for the meal it's it's a blessing brother Johnson I wish I wish honestly if I could go back to the very beginning I as a young Christian I just wish I would have never ever left the service without saying thank you for the word I can't remember how much I did or how much I didn't I just know being on this side I just try to make it a real strong point that when my wife or an make dinner to to to to not just say thank thank you but to talk about this meal took so long to make to carry some dishes to the sink to really give some Thanksgiving for the all the time that it took to prepare it amen I believe God takes time to get us the food it ain't brother John it's God giving us the food we need to be more thankful amen thou preparest a table verse five before me in the presence of my enemies who is our enemy we just learned that last service well we've learned it many times but who's our greatest enemy in church ourselves and God has given us a five course meal right in the presence of our enemy our enemy don't want to hear this word our enemy don't want to die out our enemy don't want to be corrected our enemy you don't want to know what our enemy wants to hear you're the best thing that this world has ever seen you are such of a model [Laughter] Christian there there's there's you know what you weer just close the doors and go home you're so you're so sold up I don't know what we're doing here wasting our time we're so like Jesus you understand I'm saying our our flesh Who We Love sometimes is our enemy but God prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil and my cup runneth over what destroys our enemy it's when the Holy Ghost enters in when the Holy Ghost comes inside and takes the preeminence your flesh has no control at all that's the truth the more you get filled with God the more your cup runs so you're so filled that your cup runs over look your enemy can't do a thing brother Brandon said the devil can't do anything unless he's got a vessel to work through and if you're so full of God the devil can't do nothing amen I believe God wants to fill us with himself the fill our cup with the oil of Joy so full that it it runs over that it's bubbling it's bubbling but we've got to be willing to die out to our flesh in order for the Holy Ghost to come now we can have Services where God anointing can just go from one to the next on top and he'll Bless the people and that is wonderful but I am not talking about that I am talking about when you receive so much of God inside you're willing to keep these Commandments he comes inside and makes us a bold there that he'll stay with you in the days to come Isaiah 61:3 says to a appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be Trees of Righteousness planted planning of the Lord the planning of the Lord that he might be glorified in the them amen don't you believe that I believe that this is what God wants us to do he wants to turn things around in our lives amen surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever where does the goodness of God lead us to surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life where does the goodness of God lead us to the Bible says the goodness of God leads us to repentance I don't be zalias therefore repent find something to repent for find something God is in the restoration business and it all must be through free more agency remember brother bam said he said you can't wait till the doors are open that's right you can't wait I I think about the the sacrifices that are made to come to church and you know I believe God is well pleased with the sacrifice when we give our best to be in the house of the Lord I believe God is pleased with it amen now I have some quotes I'm really done with Psalms 23 praise the Lord I believe when you read 20 Psalms 23 I want you to think about what transpires when you come to church and I would like to I would like to read some quotes if I could just get a few a little bit of a time but but if I can I understand now when we come to church we feel we're in pretty decent shape when we come to church but here is what we got to remember there's usually things that we are not aware of brother BR said in the Harvest time he said what is the biggest lie that was ever told he said it's got 99% truth in it the True Vine and the false Vine but when it comes to the place when it's got about 99% truth and 1% lie that's the deceiving type that's the kind you got to watch is them kind and that's that's just what the devil's good at he told Eve everything truth but but one thing in the message Unity of God in the in the one church he said and so deceiving is the wrong thing now excuse me a lie if it's just right out a real lie then anybody can detect it but that lie that comes about 99% truth in it that's the one that's deceiving did you notice how the devil deceived Eve every everything he told her was exactly the truth but one thing said your eyes will be open you shall know right and wrong and so forth and you shall be as gods and because uh you don't know what's right from wrong now but you will see all those things were true but when she said the Lord said we would die he said surely you won't die see just so much truth in it and then just a little bit of a lie why am I saying these scriptures because because out there the devil is speaking to us all the time and you know what he's speaking 99% truth because he knows we know the truth right so he has to tell us mainly the truth in the message Oneness now remember the devil takes a whole lot of the word pretty near 99 and 9 % of it 99 hunds and 99% of that hund he'll make it just exactly but then he'll jump off of there and that's the one that causes death right there yes that breaks the chain right in the middle down you go every word what Jesus uh what did Jesus say man shall not live by bread alone but by every word not by a few of God's words shall you live that's right but by 99 and 99% of God's worth no but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God man shall live by that that's how important it is for us to want to come in and hear the rest of the word that the devil hasn't been telling us what shall I do what Jesus called Christ Eve had the word Satan is against the word and look almost 99 and 99 hundreds of it Satan admitted it was right so close the Bible said in the last days would deceive the very elect if it were possible see how it comes in how it's always been how it's been going out the same way United of unbelief in all the full word of God you got it that's what brought death is the uniting of unbelief with the word unbelief just a little bit part of it a little bit teeny bit one 100th of 1% but it must be 100% the word see we're here come because we want to see the devil exposed in our life all right brother Bram said in the message presuming he said I only got one more page on this so just so you know let's he said in the message presuming let's presume nothing stay with the word and God is obligated to make it he said that word is a seed and that word will bring forth everything it promised to bring forth it'll do it it'll take the world out of you he said it will sanctify you it'll make you live a different life it'll make you do things you thought you couldn't do because it's the word in you don't presume you have it watch your life I love this honestly I I could come up here and never say a word except just read brother brandom but listen to this don't presume you have it watch your life what great advice the prophet's telling us and measure up and see what your life is see the way you're living see if you're in the faith search it out and see if everything is going just right see if the world still got a love so much it'll call you away from the things is really of God to love the world if it is brother check up right stop right here Satan you take that dirty thing back I'll not rece receive it he said well over at soul and Soul's Church they can do that brother so and so lets his people brother Bram says I don't care what brother so and so does the word says not to do it that settles it that's right so let's not compare with anybody else brother Bram said in God's only place provided place of worship he said now bread is a type Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God not not just a word here and there denomination would be would have you to believe it but the word of God is perfect it's God himself in letter form called a seed and the right kind of un adulterated faith in the word will make will bring the Pro seed to its life so here we are we all come to church we all want that life inside of us what's needing is one thing that you believe it like you've never believed it before that you believe it's personally for you that you mix it with a personal faith God keeps his word brother BR says but if you're baptized into this big arcade then stay with it till God confirms the word in you sure he'll give it to you it's what you look at looking at the word the word will bring you peace wasn't that the first song or chorus that Brother Bruce saying the word will bring you peace amen the word will bring you Deliverance the word brings you exactly what you have need of God always keeps his word in the message the seed is not erir with the shock I only got two more he said the stalk Hagar two wives doubted the promise but watch but watch that brought forth but watch what that brought forth when Hagar the second wife of Abraham which was just absolutely a concubine wife but she brought forth a man but what kind of man was he question the Bible said he was a wild man he lived by his bow and no man would conquer him he was untameable unconvertible unregenerated he could not be tamed he was a wild man because he was contrary to God's word and anything that's contrary any preacher any lay member any church that's contrary to the word of God will bring forth a wild adulterous bunch of worldly Hollywood and cannot stay with an unadulterated word because it's not even included in the promise we got to stay with the word that's what the prophet's saying 100% last one message Shalom brother bam said oh yes let's stand together oh yes he permits crosses and I want you to I want you to listen very closely to this quote he permits crosses that's us baren across Crossroads Junctions he always does that in order to perfect us for his service I love this quote he permits those things to happen he says can't you you understand that he does that so he can perfect you for the calling he has called you for that's your growing pains he did he did Daniel that way you know so I just think about we go through test we go through trials things do not happen the right way in our life things go wrong things go sour things go belly up but we there's one group of people that he promised that these things would happen so you could fulfill your calling is't that beautiful how important it is to stay with the word stay with coming to church get a hold as many people as you can and tell them the hour is later than we think whatever we got to go through the hedges the byways whatever we got to do bring them in because they listen to the news they listen to the TV they got their friends and none of them are telling them 100% truth am none of them they need to hear all the truth because that's what we need in this hour is all the truth amen amen is that your desire amen let's let's bow before the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that you have given us the greatest thing that you could give us and that was your word you've never lied you've never failed you've never come short there'll be no man ever on the day of judgment we'll be able to say that you came short of your word even Thy word declares that Thy word will not return unto you void but it will accomplish what you sent it for and Lord we know that as we come to church Lord you we know that your word it's for the whole world to whomsoever will receive it but we know there's only one group that will receive it and Lord I pray that there would that those of us Lord that have made this their home church that believe this truth that you sent in this age Lord that not one of us would miss it Lord I pray Lord as the prophet made mention one time he said if you see me going down the Falls if you love me you'd hit me over the head and drag me out Lord wherever we're at with you whatever we get into in the days to come Lord let there not be one that would miss it Lord I pray God May whatever has to transpire in our lives to get 100% of this word inside of us Lord we don't want to just agree with this word we want to become this word because you said that we'll be just like you when you return we're holding on to that promise Lord fill us with that Living Word when your word is preached here by the different ministers Lord that come behind this Pulpit father may it find a dwelling place inside of us may it become real may it become living may it sanctify us may it wash the world from us may it separate us from everything that's not of you father build us up in the Most Holy Faith Lord help us to continue to grow that statue of a perfect man to become so full of you Lord that we can love our enemies Lord that we can stand the test that you put us through that we can Shine for You Lord in this hour certainly Lord there's still some seed out there because you haven't come yet Lord give us a burden for Souls a burden to to just continue to to reach out to others and not to to to to assume that the people that were around won't listen just help us to be faithful to give the word out Lord bless each and every member of this church Lord strengthen them in the power of your might may they fall all more in love with your word Lord more in love with you bind us together in Christian love may nothing separate us from you may may Lord you put such a love in our heart Lord that we just help one another Lord where there's needs oh God our dependency is upon the great Holy Spirit In Our Lives bless each and every member Lord no matter where they stand Lord bless them and help them Lord and use us to help one another father we commit our our souls to your hands for you restoreth our soul we commit this body into your hand Lord we commend ourselves into your hands for your safekeeping Lord be with those that are not here bless them in their homes right now Lord when they're watching they're praying with us right now Lord let them know Lord that you're hearing their prayers father that they are yours lord they're connected to you
