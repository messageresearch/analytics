TRANSCRIPT
========================================
him and show him that we have faith because we don't have to feel good to know he's amongst us amen amen we think it would be a wonderful thing an amazing thing if we were in heaven right now right it'd be like but heaven is here for if we'll just worship him and praise him in that way it's basic brother man says that realm that's just a little bit away from us right and as we worship him what we're doing is we're entering into that realm that's really what's happening so and it's up to us as individuals to enter into that amen well god bless you turn with me if you would or opening scripture in saint john chapter 3 verse 27 and i want to say is with brother brown's good to see brother bruce and his precious wife sister donna with us we got to see a few pictures it's you know what was really good is just to know that you were able to get away finally and enjoy a little bit of time because you've been you've still been like working after everything and and may it be well may it be the beginning of many amen um and i just want to let you know brother daniel darko called uh from ghana and wanted to send his greetings and want us to pray for him he's going to be doing a little outreach and wants to share some bibles so that's always good we told him we'd be praying for him amen amen and let's look to the lord in prayer before we read this verse our dear heavenly father we thank you lord as i believe brother bruce said pray that you've given us a desire to be here today to worship you to praise you to lift you up and lord we know that when we worship you and lift you up you just have a a way of lifting us up and bringing us above our situations lord we pray tonight that we could be lifted up into heavenly places with you and lord that we would be able to have a one-on-one contact everyone in this building everyone that might be uh on the live stream each one that perhaps would listen uh to the cd lord may it be one on one with each one today we're depending on you for that lord we ask that you would help us to get out of the way that you would have your way in our hearts today cleanse us all of our sins our iniquities lord as we enter into this place lord may you come and do the work that you desire to do in our lives make us more like you lord we pray that lord you take the words that are spoken today lord may they not be man's words may they not be received as man's words but lord may it be you speaking your word to our hearts we'll give be careful to give you the praise for this and continue to worship you now in spirit and truth for we ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen saint john chapter 3 just one verse there verse 27 and john answered and said a man can receive nothing except to be given from heaven amen god bless you may be seated we want to entitle this message walking by revelation exactly the men's meeting you would think that we just took a little bit off of the men's meeting but actually i don't know it just seems to be here of late but uh the men's meeting seems to be just preparing us for the service amen but john said a man can receive nothing except to be given him from heaven amen and that includes faith includes revelation which faith is a revelation brother bryan said and the voice of god spoken to us personally is a faith personal to us faith is a substance that comes from god it comes from heaven and if i could say it like this a man cannot receive faith unless it's given to him from heaven god used the substance of faith to frame the world that were that we live in god operates by faith every day when we're needing god help me with this situation it is faith that moves in our behalf amen without this real substance called faith we cannot please god these things were already in our notes before you brothers has quoted these scriptures romans chapter 1 verse 16 and just laying a quick foundation but paul was saying here about faith for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and then also to the greek salvation cannot come without faith without believing and then he says here in verse 17 for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith so faith isn't just something that we have with god in a religious way but it's something that we live by it's not something that we just have at the beginning when we make our initial commitment to god but it is something that we live with every day amen and what's so beautiful about this is that god can be here right today and speak to us too often we get caught up in what's being said as just information good information true information uh these are things that uh brother john has been studying and and we can benefit from these things and and be helped from these things but that is not what church is about that's not what the preaching of the gospel is about revelation doesn't come in that format later in the book of romans chapter 4 we find that faith counted david and abraham both justified amen in chapter 5 we understand that we're justified by faith and we have access thank you my brother i can see better now we have access into god's grace by faith we all want grace right but we need faith to enter into that and what verse i wanted to get to is in romans chapter 10 verse 17 faith cometh by hearing you can't just hear truth and expect to have faith i want you to think about that statement you can't just hear truth and expect to have faith it's the source that you're hearing it from that's important amen who's telling you about the truth it will determine whether you get faith or not faith cometh by hearing god's word not man speaking god's word that's why it's important that you get your eyes and your mind off of john martin or who's ever standing up here you've got to focus on the word on the word and how it and how it um how it's dealing with you because you know when when jesus was speaking they would want to catch jesus in something they were saying wrong you know they come to brother brennan's meetings they want to catch them in something that he's saying wrong their whole motive was off of hearing from god they had to prove something and even if we're trying to prove it ourself there's no uh he he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit or what god is speaking to the church not what man is saying and somehow it's the spirit of god no get man out of the way get him completely up the more you can get man out of the way the more you're going to hear from god personally god can use somebody like me if he can use a donkey he can use me not worthy that he would use it think about this if if god could uh use if god uses you right yeah well why couldn't he use me and it really it does not matter the vessel that stands here it's your faith in what word is being spoken to your heart it all has to do with your heart and the word that's being spoken that is the real focus and where the focus needs to be faith is important brother brother mike reminded us something that the prophet said in our men's meaning he said faith is the most important thing that we can pray for and i just wonder how often we're praying for it because he as long as we can figure it out and understand it i got it that's the same thing that we can learn in school or in college or at work but what source is it coming from well it's got to be coming from god because brother john's saying it no no no it's got to be spoken to you personally or you can't receive it learning of god has been in interest of mankind since god put him out of the garden and placed flaming swords to protect the way of life amen in other words you won't be able to find a way to god on your terms right right because that was the whole the whole thing was no we got to do something here because otherwise they're gonna they've already made a decision to choose evil and now they're gonna come and approach us we can't have that right we can't come on our terms to god amen god made a way for us to come properly amen and it was through his only begotten son jesus christ full of grace and full truth jesus said i am the way to god he said i am the truth of god he said i am the life of god my words are spirit in their life and no man cometh to the father but by me he is the way back to god man will have to come god's way or he won't come at all amen when jesus described this way of himself he said that the way isn't easy it's a hard way you have to give up your will to walk in this way one place jesus described the way is straight and narrow it was crowded with afflictions and troubles he said but it's the way that leads to life amen god provided a way for us his love was manifested at calvary and that veil was rent in two it's that separated man from god and the the bible says i believe it was peter says uh he broke the middle wall of partition between us and he reconciled man back to god amen god did this freely for us but we understand a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received as a pardon otherwise the whole world would be saved so this life that god has given this way that he has provided it's not given to us like a christmas gift or some born-again birthday gift the whole world would be saved at that point it's god's desire but we must have the desire as well amen so strong that we're willing to give up our will for god's will it's absolutely true all we have to do is believe but we must believe as the scriptures teach us to believe there's no private interpretations with the scriptures to fully receive what god has for us we must give up all of our will i just got a few scriptures for that luke 14 33 so likewise whosoever be of you that forsaketh not all that he have he cannot be my disciple now we're talking about that way that for god so love that he gave revelations chapter 12 verse 11 and they overcame them by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death we must learn to believe like the scriptures teach us to believe amen can't believe in some other fashion some other way the way to god is through jesus christ we know that and jesus said the way to god is to give up our lives and to become born again that is the way you can't approach god on your terms you can't just build your own tower of babel to god your own tower of confusion to god you'll get so tied up and confused in your mind that you'll never get to god we've defined the way now i want to define our approach to that way man has access to approach god now but only on god's terms people have tried so many different approaches to god through their knowledge intellect understanding their talent their ability their reputation their works burning candles much speaking prayers money you name it man has tried it yes but there is only one approach acceptable to god and that is a humble contrite approach oh yes you can come boldly before the throne because of calvary but it still must be a humble approach the boldness is the way has made not the spirit that you have james chapter 4 verse 6 but he giveth more grace oh my my did not brother ron quote this in the men's meme but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble amen submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he'll flee from you draw nigh to god and he'll draw nigh to you how do you do that you cleanse your hands you purify your hearts you afflict yourself you mourn you weep you let your laughter be turned to mourning your joy to heaviness that is humbling yourself in the sight of the lord what is the end result he lifts you up amen he lifts you up speak not evil one of another that's a that's another thing that goes against the grain of god he that speaketh evil of his brother judgeth his brother he did and and speaking evil of the law because the law says don't do that right and judge the law but if thou judge the law thou no more doer the law but a judge so where does that put you with god god's going to look over at you and say what i'm the one that made the law not you that's why you can never judge somebody in the presence of the lord we all can judge somebody and we've all judged somebody but you can't be in the presence of the lord and do it so if you find yourself doing it you're out of that dimension you're out of that presence you're out of walking in the spirit do you want to get somewhere with god humble yourself humble your approach and you'll find a way to having more of the lord now here's here's where we're at today we're all christians today we're all serving the lord we all got a revelation and we're all saved now that we got that out of the way how many wants more of the lord this is the same exact recipe for us the same exact recipe knowing god is completely reserved by god no man can have anything except it be received from heaven we cannot make it force it do it anything amen it's up to god's grace revelation is a grace faith is is grace to us it's up to god if he chooses to unveil himself to anybody amen in fact he decided long ago to build his church completely on the choice that he would make who would be in his church we should have had more hallelujahs when brother ron was leading the worship instead of sitting there and looking at brother ron wondering you know what kind of job he's doing let's just help him let's just create let's do our part to create the atmosphere and and when you think you've done enough then help the brother sister that's next to you but if we just all put in 100 god will honor the atmosphere matthew chapter 16 verse 13 very familiar scriptures here when jesus came to the coast of caesarea philippi asked his disciples saying who do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that our john the baptist elias jeremias or one of the prophets some today might say that jesus is a methodist he's a catholic he's a lutheran or others pentecostal or one of those religions out there that's right and we learn from this that there's a lot of different opinions that people have about who god is right amen amen and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am so the first question is what other people say now it's to you personally and if i can say this if this is an individual fair what did god speak to you at the service tonight not what did he say not the understanding or what you got out of it but what did he speak to you personally amen that's all that's important because if that don't happen we've missed it we've missed hearing what the spirit said to us because you're the church right you're the church amen so what did the spirit say to you amen well he didn't say anything to me right you sure you sure he's never failed that's right right that's right he's never come short that's right he that have ears it's my responsibility to get proper ears yes in fact he told the laodicean church that you need to get isaf and you need to you need to take care of yourself and do your part if you're going to see me in the church and what is he what is he dealing with their attitude it was all about attitude you know you say you you are in need of nothing and you can kick me out of the church you're the one that don't realize that you're you're blind jesus said to those pharisees because you say you see you're blind if you would say i can't see then i would give you sight it's all to do with attitude amen so to really receive revelation personally the thing you want to work on is your attitude and of course what does pride say pride says my attitude is fine my motives are right my my attitude is right and i'm basically in need of nothing sitting here amen it's an individual fair it doesn't matter the person's attitude sitting next to you what's important is what is your attitude amen so i believe he's asking us the same question tonight who do we say he is somebody brought up in our men's meeting brother ron it honestly brother ron but brother ron was not leading the men's meeting it was brother mark but we heard a lot from brother ron that was not in any negative way brother ron at all because everything that he had to say was perfectly in line with the message tonight amen but he made mention about the challenge of reading every verse in the bible and not seeing jesus in it he said it caused him to want to go back and read it until he found jesus in it and i believe that when we come to church and we're hearing the word spoken we need to see jesus speaking to us because we can get in the in the mindset or the attitude well i wish so and so was here i hope they caught this and before you know it the whole service is about just one thing i i i instead of that love letter that love relationship that lord you know exactly what i've been going through you know what i have need of amen it's like we should get rid of all pitchforks and have rakes amen verse 16 simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god remember peter once said thou alone has the words of eternal life when you're hearing the word are you are you agreeing that the word is true or are you saying that word is for me it's two different things yes it's two different things the debate is not going to be whether the word is right right that's not the debate but knowing that the word is right will never make us go out and live it we've got to hear from god personally speak to our heart amen verse 17 jesus answered and said on tim blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven now i want to to bring our attention to what's really more important is hearing the truth all that matters or is it more important who's speaking to you amen because you notice jesus didn't say you got it right that's all that matters you got it right no he brought attention to where the information came from so i say today um don't ever leave the church and say well brother john said unless it was wrong and then you can say that then i want you to say that but it's more important of knowing who you're hearing it from amen what what brother branham say just five minutes in his presence where he's speaking to us can do more than five years in a seminary hearing all about god hearing all about the truth amen it's about a personal relationship that's what this is about amen when god knocked on saul's heart he didn't get lazy and just go to church and hear what the disciples had to say about this new jesus he heard about right he went alone into the desert and he sought the voice of the lord personally [Music] and after three and a half years he came out and there was nothing that the disciples could add unto his ministry of what god had spoke to him personally that's the power of the voice of god spoken personally and he had so much faith in god amen galatians chapter 1 verse 15 but when it please god who separated me from my mother's room and called me into his grace called me by his grace to reveal his son notice in me the word is in me because when you get a revelation it becomes part of you it's what you eat amen you become what he speaks amen because he all that god has ever ever looked for is a desire in a man's heart why did he let lucifer go lucifer wasn't like that at the beginning he worshipped god right and he did it from his heart he really did and we don't know for how many millions of years he did that but he got to a place where he wanted to do his own thing and god let him do it just like god lets every human being do what he wants to do because that's a gentleman god wants a love relationship if somebody's going to approach him and have a relationship it's going to be on the basis of love and desire because that's what god has for us [Music] amen to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately immediately i didn't think about finding out what somebody else had to say about it i conferred not with flesh and blood neither when i went up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned into damascus then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and i bowled with him two weeks right but other but other of the apostles saw i save james the lord's brother so he didn't have really a whole lot of contact can you imagine if you had to hear from god without the preaching of the word peter did not go to a message church in his hour paul did not go to a message church in his hour that was in arabia he went to be alone with god yes in order for us to really hear from god without preaching we got to get serious now god does speak he spoke when we were all sinners we heard his voice but we get to a place where god expects us to humble ourself and spend time with him seeking his voice he wants that private time amen but he had so much confidence in verse 11 of that same chapter he says but i certify you brother that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for i neither received it of man just like peter didn't receive it of man who jesus was neither was i taught it this is important we come to church and we learn so much at church but we're being taught it by man too much too much relying on it amen we need to hear the truth there's no doubt about it but you need to take the truth home and go seek the lord about it and hear from god personally make sure it's him and be able to come back and and know that you heard from heaven now to do the thing correctly to do it correctly we need to come more prepared for the word the bible says be more ready to hear the word and if if we got a good grill right then we know we're here and we're going to hear from heaven because it it's just going to connect it's going to bear witness the holy ghost that lives inside of you is going to bear witness with the holy ghost says speaking amen because you're both god i'm scared of being taught by a man because you can begin to rely on the man and miss the revelation amen okay this word is not the word of man it's the word of god but it was spoken of holy men of old as they were moved on by the holy ghost amen now if we have that same spirit when we're reading it but just because i have the holy ghost it doesn't mean that the holy ghost is reading the word right now doesn't mean i'm in this spirit right now reading the word it is so easy to pick up the bible and read it and feel good it is so hard to get on your knees and humble yourself and say god help me in my condition i need to hear from you we want to hear from god when we open that bible and read it without any kind of change or preparation here and it's not good enough to say lord forgive me i'm sorry my sins speak to me now it's like to speak to me now that our my death how's that go those prayers it can become out of the heart that god is looking for let me just say it like that out of the heart that god is looking for he's looking for love taking your time and wanting to hear from him he was patient with us amen that is right why can't we be patient with him why can't we wait on the lord why can't we make sacrifices and and just get desperate to want to hear stay there until we hear from him amen revelation isn't going to come i want to ask you this question when's the last time you received a revelation i yes i want to challenge you but not in a mean way what revelation did you receive did you walk in it are you a part of it has it become a part of your life i mean it's not about being taught the bible it's about a relationship that you have with god and when he speaks to you and it becomes real to you you ought to be able to testify god spoke this i'm the church he spoke this to me and it become a part of my life is changing from faith unto faith amen the just shall live by faith amen i want you to go home and i want you to think about these things i want you to think about the faith that god has given you and you're walking in that faith too often we're using god as somebody to help us with our natural life completely off balance of what what faith is for we want to get out of here we want to become more in his image we want to be able to be an overcomer amen we need faith for that amen paul started out his walk correctly and that was by faith it was a foundation of faith he sought god he got faith and he believed in god faith isn't a religion he continued his walk every day by faith galatians chapter 2 verse 20. he said the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god and he ended his walk in faith second timothy chapter four verse seven second timothy chapter four verse seven i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith you can't lose it [Music] amen just get so involved in the world henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous shall give me at that day and not to me only but everyone that's here tonight that loves his appearing amen when's the last time you said lord i just want to see you all right you know what we probably all said i'm so sick of this world i'm so sick of what i'm going through i'm so sick of this i just want to get out of here i don't see any love and disappearing in that what i see is the frustration of what this world can do to a person amen but what god is wanting to see is that love affair the bride and the spirit they say come there's that longing for jesus can't wait till those doors are open so i can come in and worship the lord amen not sit there and just wait for something to be spoken to me to kind of help me make me feel better i mean i understand that we need that sometimes but if that becomes your attitude most of the time something is wrong with your walk something is missing in your watch because it's not lining up with i can't wait till the doors are open amen it's got to line up when god speaks to you personally it becomes your faith it becomes your substance it becomes your anchor when you hear the preaching of the word i want you to visualize it being more as it is god using just a vessel to speak to you it's just a vessel but visualize it's going to be god speaking to you sec first thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13. for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when ye receive the word of god which he heard of us ye received it not as the word of men right but as it is in truth the word of god which effectually worketh also in you that believe if you're just believing you're hearing the truth from a man you're probably going to walk out of here about the same as you came in even though brother ram says you never are the same when you walk out you're either closer to god which is you have more faith because you heard from god or you're further away which means you've got more knowledge you've got more knowledge you're just you're hearing from a man and it's it's taking you away from god yes it's going to come to a man we're not up here listening to some we're not a tape we're hearing god's using a vessel but you're a vessel too if god in the speaker and the god and the listener are connected there's something that god has for you amen amen he's not one to waste your time amen and he cares about you so much more than any human being can ever care about you amen and that's why your faith it rests in god in the word not a man amen this is not a school of learning this we don't come here some night class we're not here to learn about god we're here to meet god one-on-one when you go home you should better talk to the person next to you and say this is what god spoke to me yes this is what god spoke to me not this why would you get out of that service yeah right let you get out of the service we come to meet with him yes amen amen amen i'm telling you it's all about attitude change amen the more our attitude can become humble i need you lord god we'll hear god speak so much more amen this private communication between you and god is your lifeline to heaven god must be privately speaking to your heart or you are without god in the service right and we've all we've all experienced this we've sat in church we've heard the word and felt like nothing happened we've all sat in church felt the presence of the lord right and said god was there because we found his presence but how often can we testify god spoke to my heart i knew it was him and this is what he's called me to do and i'm going to do it amen because that's what the word is for right it's not about feelings whether we don't feel or we feel right it's about he my sheep feel my spirit my sheep hear my voice and they follow me we got to get excited about hearing his voice [Music] put more faith in god not the pastor amen it's just an office that god uses yes but it's just as human as you yeah it's just as human as you it has just as many thoughts as you yes it's true probably more hey our faith should not rely in man our faith needs to be in god amen god is not going to let anyone into his church without his say so now that's scary god is not going to give anybody a revelation without his say-so that's a better way to say it because we all are in his church but if you ask the question how come i haven't been getting revelation at church well he is the one that says whether you're going to get it or not and he'll give it if we meet his requirement we need to be humble we need to be contrite we need to be needy he's come to revive those that are broken needy of that relationship not just to the hardships that going on at work man we got a lot of them yeah we all got them we all got them and if it ain't work it's of something else but in the midst of all that we ought to be zooming in on a relationship with god to get to make a rapture and get out of here and that's what our focus needs to be verse 18 and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock of revelation i will build my church amen and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it we must be looking hungering thirsting desiring for god to come and speak to us because this is god's time of visitation and we don't want to miss it amen we don't want to just show up because this church because if we miss church and we feel bad what's the truth so if we show up then we want to deal with that but we still missed him he walked with those two disciples on the road to emmaus and they didn't even recognize him he could be right here in our midst standing on holy ground and we don't even know it yes amen and not because god's lacking amen god reserves who is going to show himself to who he's going to unveil himself to you know there's certain people in life that you cannot trust everybody should have said amen to that there's very few people in life that you can trust [Music] because you know they won't hurt you that's right amen well god knows whose motive is just for him and whose motive is a little bit mixed or mixed up amen and so god is waiting for our motives to be right amen our hearts to be right amen because i'll say this the whole heaven is full of so much joy peace and the unveiling of christ i think it'll take eternity and we still won't know all about god how can we come to church and not receive it has to be a loss now at the same time that god is wanting to speak to us he's wanting to keep his truth from the majority of people he's literally hiding himself i say this because the the majority of people go to hell it's the broad way it's awful quiet i don't got time to go into all this i'm not gonna have time to you need to say amen so i can keep going as jesus finishes his sermon where he's expressing the need that people need to repent more they need to be more zealous about repenting or else the day of judgment is going to be real bad for them he ends up praying in matthew chapter 11 verse 25 at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee oh father lord of heaven and of earth because thou has hid these things from a group of people they're wise and they're prudent yes and he's revealed them to another group of people who are like babes yes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight he holds the control of who he's going to unveil himself who's going to be in the church and who's not yes amen so we're not questioning whether we're in the church today but we need to understand how can i get more revelation what is what do i do what can i do to get more revelation is god hiding something from me is god keeping something from me i've been praying i've been seeking i've been asking is god hiding from me all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man but the father saved the son and to he to whomsoever the son will reveal him he's holding that today yes amen you know the bible says the rich have many friends excuse me for getting off the pulpit so much but i just want to get kind of close to you but i don't want to preach loud or anything you know the bible says the rich have many friends if there's somebody that's got something a lot of people like them it's just natural i can benefit from knowing this person i can climb up the corporate ladder quicker it's not what you know it's who you know jesus has what we have need of amen we don't need to impress one another all right thank you jesus it's not about what you think about me or what i think about you [Music] we're here because of god amen i want to get in contact with him and i need to hear from him amen that's why brother branham said we don't come here to fellowship with one another we come to fellowship with god we need just a word from him amen so i'm saying he has all the riches he has everything that we have need of right why wouldn't we want to just buddy up to him i mean john he kind of leaned on the bosom of jesus right he knew where the goods came from and he could whisper little things and find out the secrets that he would maybe not tell everybody because of that closeness right amen and i'll say the more you you notice john he didn't go like this over jesus what are these other disciples they're still no he humbled himself and got under his bosom and is close to his heart because he knew he'd have a better chance remember they didn't peter brother bruce you probably know this i'm sorry that wasn't it peter that came to john and asked john talk to jesus and see what he says about something wasn't that right because he couldn't do it himself but he knew john was close to him and what happens when there's a need you know who just to call jesus is here and he wants to speak to us amen but he's looking for us to get in personal contact with him amen and you can't do that outside of a humble and contrite spirit i don't matter what you know how much you know i don't care what's been revealed to you i don't care how long you've been serving the lord i don't care if you've been certain more longer than lucifer did because you can get to a place where your attitude isn't exactly where it needs to be [Music] and then you know what develops religion i'm in the message that's right i follow this right but what about the love of god where's that relationship to where all men see it isn't just a denomination it isn't just a message believer the true message will never become denominationalized but they will take this message and make a personal denomination out of it because they don't have a revelation of who the who brother branham was talking about [Music] it's like amen they've you know what it is they come to they come to the tapes they're listening to the tapes and they they want to be just like they want to be like brother brandon absolutely cowboy hats whatever it might be nowadays they're quoting the quotes oh yes quote the quotes it is true right it's like a belt buckle it can be you know what i'm saying if you quote the quote but you're not living the quote that's right and i understand that we can't live the whole message i understand that but it's not about quoting the prophet it's about becoming what that prophet quoted it's about living the word amen god is literally hiding himself from one group of people and revealing himself to another group amen and it all has to do with the condition of heart amen because remember the four conditions of the heart the word was still preached right yes yes it it hit yes but they they were all it affected each one differently amen so we want it to profit us right we want it to bring forth through whatever god speaks to us if god speaks to me john martin i want you to stop doing that i want the fruit of me stop doing that right i don't want just well i know not to do that there's no and have no fruit of it continue to do it you understand what i'm saying but a good ground will make me stop doing it that's why it's important that we hear from god personally right and there's a lot of things that we all need to stop doing amen god is working to hide himself from a wise and prudent a proud and arrogant from those who aren't zealous about repenting god gives a chance but people refuse to deal with the chance that god gives them but to the humble heart the babes who realize that they need to know god more he says in verse 28 the next verse come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest see that before this is a group of people who were just would not repent right who would not repent and he said it's going to be more tolerable for these that had already their judgment then for the new people were hearing the word and not repenting right a greater than solomon was amongst them so he says i'm going to reveal myself to babes now babe is you just i need you lord i'm coming to you because i know that no one else can help me [Music] i'm coming to church for one reason i need you lord nobody else can help me come unto me all you that labor and heavy laden i will give you rest take my yoke upon you learn of me learn of me do not learn what john martin says about jesus learn from jesus amen we've got to get our eyes off of flesh and get our eyes on jesus it's it's a catching away time we've made church too much about a denominational system in our mind of going to church and it's we've gotten out of the spirit amen end up coming to church not in the spirit struggling to get in the spirit when we're here and then finding ourselves content with the knowledge of truth and not even at least interested in where that truth came from who's whose voice that spoke to you when god speaks it it becomes a part of you you walk out you're thinking about it you want to do it you're you're activating it you think about the next day it becomes real i want to say today when's the last time you got a revelation we probably can all talk about the things that we've learned right oh man i i got a rev i didn't know that about the bible but what about god dealing with you and your relationship with him isn't that what this is for if it's not for that we all can go to a seminary and they teach a lot better than i can but what good would that do it wouldn't get us in a rapture because they don't deal with the relationship it deals with knowledge about god that's right and that just will puff you up because you'll know more than the next guy but love in the relationship that's what it defies yes amen let's stand together i want you to know there were four we were just beat the 50 mark on that one but we trust that there was enough there because my prayer was lord speak what you want and if we're provoked to get more serious about hearing his voice we spend more time seeking revelation then i've achieved my goal my desire we can't rely on church that's this is just the vehicle the tool that's god has provided for us and we can have confidence when we come we're not hearing some twisted up thing that you got to die aside to figure out what's word what's not but still we've got to hear him speak to us personally which has everything to do with the condition of our heart the attitude of our heart and where our expectation is when we come amen amen let's bow our heart pray with me dear father we want to thank you for the living word we want to thank you that you have a voice that we can hear you said my sheep hear my voice and they follow they follow me they follow the revelation they follow what's being spoken and lord i know it's a lot to ask but i believe it's your will that we spend time seeking you like like like paul sought you to hear your voice personally lord we weren't able to get to it but when we hear your voice oh your word says the righteous or as bold as a lion a revelation becomes unmovable and god we need that for our lives because the enemy is does a lot of stuff to us to try to get us off track amen so it truly is the most important thing that we can pray for i pray for every heart here lord and lord we're all different ages as it were in our relationship with you god i believe that you're able to break down to each of us wherever we're at or walk what you would have us to do to get to know you a little bit more calls us all to spend time praying lord and your word declares that you are a rewarder of them that diligently seek you what greater reward could we have than hearing you speak to us personally lord we want to become more like babes in the way that our attitudes need to be the lord we want to become more mature and obeying that word and walking faithfully to that word god give us that proper balance i humbly pray that you'd grant the desire of every heart here that's wanting to hear more from you personally lord bless each life at least each family each home lords help us to pray more in our homes god as we see this hour approaching lord all's we have is you you're the only thing in our lives that's we can counter it's true that's honest [Music] it's always a good report bless us lord as we're desiring to mature and get ready for this rapture god we want to hear from you more personally lord let there be some testimonies of you dealing with us in a personal way god i believe that would give us all of a greater faith what to be looking for change our our lives lord to be a little bit more like you amen we need you lord we need you we commit ourself your hands we trust lord that you bring to pass more revelation for us that we could keep walking day by day faith by faith personally spoken to us day by day god will be careful to give you the praise for all these things we're in debt to you form lord we ask it now in jesus christ's name amen amen thank you lord amen [Music] amen more of you i've had it all but what i need is just four of you of things i've had my fear and yet i hunger still lord hear our prayer for more of you more of you more of you i've had it all but what i need is just more of you of things i've had my fear and yet [Applause] [Music] amen let's let's close our eyes and just zoom in on him what i need is just more of you of things i've had my fear and [Music] lord hear my prayer for more of you amen amen that's in that little course i want to know you more amen i want to know you more deep within my soul i want to know you oh i want to know you to feel your heart and know your mind looking in your eyesters up within me cries that say i want to know you oh i want to know you more oh i want to know you more deep within my soul i want to know you oh i want to know you and i would give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection oh i want to know you more oh i want to know you more amen that was paul's testimony amen amen he was not afraid oh i wish i could did the whole sermon we would have been in acts he was not afraid of even losing his life because he would have got to know jesus in giving his life physically that's just awesome we have an opportunity to know god more than we've ever known him before amen and i want you to be taught that you don't need anybody standing here to do it what are you saying brother john what i'm saying is we want to start making this more personal amen in your home god can speak to you so real and so powerful without being in church when it happens more you'll actually be more excited about getting to church i think that's where that comes in you can't wait to get there yeah amen but if we're relying on church to do all the right pump us up make us feel good right before you know it we're gonna have to have some sort of entertainment here praise the lord brother run god bless you so good to see god dealing with us hallelujah amen praise the lord yes my sister go ahead i'm thinking about years back i was in the hospital and i remember i didn't have my bible with me and i was just so frustrated with that the lord spoke to me in my heart at that moment you are i am in you you know my word just stand on it take it take it to heart believe it and so even though it's in too much pain and frustration i just said okay lord i'm gonna sit up on the side of god thank you jesus for helping me sit on the back next thing lord help me take two steps thank you jesus you know and the more i get it the more i knew that within my soul jesus amen my faith just kept growing and growing up walking down the hall the walker it's wonderful that's beautiful man the bible does say that his word is in us amen we don't got to go to heaven to bring him down he it's nigh in our hearts amen yes sister yes you may be seated for just a second if you'd like um like last week one on the ground then like a couple days later i see this red stain on it how do i get this out what is it doing here i'm trying to move the lamp shade so i can figure out how to hide it it doesn't work so it's like all right i'm gonna get this light shade i'm gonna put the arsenal to it i'm gonna get this red stain out this is what i'm gonna do all right so i get all this stuff i mean i used everything on it nothing wrong this is amen wonderful praise god or whatever he does amen i love that i just i just want to give her uh or give a scripture for what our sister said says beloved now are we the sons of god right and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him and we shall see him as he is and every man that have this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure and i think we do that when we hear the word and god says this is what i want you to start working on real hard in your life because we we want things to be easy for us we we hear the word we get a revelation and it's always gone and sometimes god wants us to work at it yeah who oh yeah sure he did a good job and then i told her that she should give the testimony tonight and then when you and she decided but then when you said i want to hear more testimonies about what the went to laura she looked at me we didn't say anything but i said you should probably just give because you want to bless people that god is speaking and i need to help you with the absolutely stuff that's wrong in your heart in your life that's the whole reason you give you want one of bless people you want people need to know that god is real and that he is moving and speaking and changing that he has the power to do that just in the mundane thing of picking up a lampshade the beginning of what god wants he he'll use that to speak the same thing about this if god can do that in our home what all he'd be able to do in church you know what i'm saying and what makes church difficult is there's a lot of noises going on when you're just dealing with this landscape it's real quiet you know just you focus on the lord but when we come to church we got a lot of things going on a lot of a lot of people a lot of and you've got to stay real focused with you in the lord amen we're going to say something okay to thank the um of the world that's been coming across um you know when you were ministering the lord was just dealing with my heart about praise god living the life of christ and more with my life than my mouth beautiful when you read that quote about and i'll probably get wrong but that said live every day or preach a sermon every day and when necessary use words yeah you know that really spoke to my heart and i began to meditate upon the people that yielded to god when i came along and that helped me find christ and i began thinking about how just to show my gratitude i want to do that for somebody else amen praise god so i was meditating on that and tuesday came along and i woke up and of course you got a list of things to do and i just thought you know what there's always going to be a list of things to do in a world where you don't have a lot of choices i'm going to choose just not to do that right now that's good just spend some time with the lord so i went to the living room i called james out we just took a little bible study topic of a child hearing his mom's voice and once it gets older mom no longer needs to say her name when she leaves a message because that child knows that mom's voice and how we need to know jesus's voice and our heart like that not our mind not our understanding that connection is so clear he doesn't need to say it's him we know amen so after the bible study i going to do my dishes and that thought was just in my heart and my heart's desires i just want to get so close to him again amen it's beautiful connected so i put a sermon on and i was washing dishes and i'm listening to the song service that i just felt so overwhelmed by his presence and i'm i'm washing dishes and i'm like what am i going to do with this like who am going to tell like because there's nobody around and i'm just worshiping him and i'm almost feeling like i'm just going to come bust because i'm so thankful for his love and i said in my heart lord what did i do with this and my phone went off and it was this soul looking for help and prayer but in that moment i heard what you said in that sermon i talked about every time i talk to somebody i'm really dealing with their soul not whatever they're doing needing help with and they needed help but in that moment it was like the lord said you desire to help here's your door and so i began just giving the word to them and you know praying with them and helping them and of course trisha took over and i wanted to fix it you know i want to give him all of it real quick and the lord just spoke and said no no remember i am the one just put their hand in mind it's beautiful that's a beautiful testament i was so overwhelmed that i took all of that wanting to fix all of that energy and i just went tanner's seating for them and it fell in my heart lord i found one i found one of your sheeps they're over here here they are overwhelmed that like you just overwhelmed me [Music] and i sat in awe the very thing i was meditating and desiring to be god didn't honor my works of looking for somebody to talk to he didn't honor my thoughts or knowledge of how i was going to do it but just when i was focused on wanting to love him yes he brought the opportunity right for me it's beautiful beautiful i was just talking to anne i think it was yesterday about how we need to pray put our confidence in praying for the need because ian is she'll do anything anything for anybody she's just that way she's that way and she wants to do more when she's done doing she wants to do more and she has a burden for a number of people and i love that and wants to do more and sometimes we just we just gotta trust the lord just pray just pray that god would move in that behalf so i appreciate that that testimony and you you venturing off into trust more than hand doing it and brother i know brother ryan really appreciate this testimony no because he shared so many testimonies like this in our men's meeting about trying to do the testifying and not letting the testifier you know do it all and and staying out of it so it's just beautiful we're growing we're growing in the lord and that's what's important here and i i love it i love these testimonies and we just we just keep growing keep growing before you know it we're going to be ready amen sister kathleen but the scripture that keeps coming to me and it's just like like it's all over the place when god's trying to tell you something it won't just be one thing um that's good in the discouragement um the physical realm with the health issues that are going on in the world in my own things but in just everyday life and walking as a christian and how long lord you know am i am i really the person that's longing to see you and am i the person in my longing um yeah and amen that's the word that kept coming to me as you were satisfied is that word trust and whether it was our sister just having faith to get up out of this edge of the bed and start walking or sister just trusting that this is what god wanted me to do and get a lesson from god your own sermon or you trusting not to put myself in it just just do what god told me to do and testifying it's all god is teaching us and wants us all to trust in him yes sister hope i just want to say a little something changing um my daughter um told me uh yesterday she said mom she said what's going on with you what do you talk about that's [Laughter] you know we was great in tampa in the strip camp and i went to schools and all that the catholic powers i was seniors and uh my sister said i told my sister i said i'm thinking about getting baptized and she said what are you talking about and i said she said you were baptized he was born yeah and i said no i want to get back amen and she said oh what's come over you i mean really you know because i was i've always been confrontational where i want to argue i've always been like that so and um like one thing one door opens for me and then a door shuts it's like somebody says something you know like me and my brother got an argument you know um what are you teaching ramona about religion you're going to a different religion i said you know what if i'm happy if i feel good and the in this church is making me want to get up amen and come amen [Laughter] absolutely yeah we were so blessed the last time you testified we were all talking about it and even not just after service but i'm talking about days later people were bringing it up so we are praying for you and we're excited with what god's doing in your heart amen well let's stand together and be dismissed in the word of prayer that god give us a safe trip home and and continue to speak to us amen more and more amen amen couldn't ask our brother marty if he went close to service in prayer touching the hearts of each and every one here thank you very much be totally sincere in our efforts here lord jesus and not just to be going to church connecting with you lord amen
