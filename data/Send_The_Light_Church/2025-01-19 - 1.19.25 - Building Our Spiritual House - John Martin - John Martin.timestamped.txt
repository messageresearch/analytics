[37:49] rock and the rain descended and the
[37:52] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[37:54] upon that house and it fell not for it

[38:20] it came to pass when Jesus had ended

[38:27] taught them as one having Authority and
[38:29] not as the scribes amen God bless you
[38:33] you may be
[38:34] seated
[38:39] um well every one of us at one time or
[38:42] another has either owned a house lived
[38:47] in a house or visited a house and stayed
[38:50] there a
[38:51] while and there are a lot of uh
[38:53] components that go up to making a house
[38:56] and a lot of things that can go wrong
[38:58] even today we're still working on a a
[39:01] furnace that's been given us problems
[39:02] for a couple months I think and
[39:07] uh every house needs continual
[39:10] maintenance it's it's a lot to to build
[39:13] it up but then after it's built it needs
[39:15] it it needs
[39:16] maintenance every house must be built
[39:21] according to the colds of the state or
[39:23] the the county or or the city or the
[39:26] township this one we built it it had to
[39:28] be built uh according to the
[39:31] colds and you just can't build uh your
[39:34] house any way you want to just because
[39:36] it's your house you still have to work
[39:38] in accordance uh to the cods of that
[39:42] area so regular inspections are
[39:47] needed need to be performed and
[39:49] inspectors come in they want to make
[39:51] sure that it's done exactly to how it's
[39:54] written now the whole purpose of a house
[39:58] is to have a place to
[40:01] live a place of shelter a place to dwell
[40:04] a place that you can feel comfortable
[40:07] and relaxed from not just the elements
[40:10] that are uh in the world the the like
[40:13] the cold the temperature uh uh the wind
[40:15] and the snow and the rain and the storms
[40:18] but also a place that you can come in
[40:20] from A busy life from work from from
[40:23] problems and just kind of come in and
[40:25] have a place of com
[40:28] comfort and there are things that we
[40:30] need to do if we want God to uh continue
[40:33] to live inside of
[40:35] US 1 Corinthians 6:19 says what know ye
[40:39] not that your body is the Temple of the
[40:42] Holy Ghost which is in you and ye are of
[40:46] God and you are not your own so our
[40:51] bodies are a house for
[40:54] God and the Bible says you are bought
[40:57] with a price therefore glorify God in
[40:59] your body and in your spirit which are
[41:02] gods and 2 Corinthians 6:19 just trying
[41:05] to lay a foundation that our body is
[41:07] God's house and what agreement have the
[41:10] temple of God with Idols for you are the
[41:12] Temple of the Living God as God has said
[41:15] I will dwell in them I will dwell in
[41:18] them I will walk in them and I will be
[41:20] their God and they shall be my people
[41:22] wherefore come out from among them and
[41:25] be ye separate sayith the Lord and touch
[41:27] not the unclean and unclean thing and I
[41:29] will receive you so here it is that God
[41:32] wants to dwell in us but we have to come
[41:33] out of something well amen it it can't
[41:36] be where our body is at it has to be
[41:39] where our mind and our desires our
[41:42] spirit are in the wrong things they're
[41:45] in the things of the world and we have
[41:47] to come out of those things in order for
[41:49] God to live inside of us and will be a
[41:53] father unto you and you shall be my sons
[41:56] and daughters say sayeth the Lord
[41:59] Almighty now God has chosen us to dwell
[42:02] in yet he just doesn't automatically
[42:05] dwell in us just because we've been
[42:09] baptized this is just the
[42:12] beginning uh of a building
[42:14] process and there are a lot of things
[42:16] that can go wrong when you're
[42:20] building I I I I put a number of
[42:23] buildings up I did a number of
[42:25] Foundations I I had to redo
[42:30] stuff and there are a lot of things that
[42:33] that um if I could say it like this um
[42:37] that God needs to convince us
[42:40] of uh to to to
[42:44] to we we think we've got it we've done
[42:47] this this is all that's been needed but
[42:49] Jesus said in John 16:12 I have yet many
[42:52] things to say unto you but you cannot
[42:53] bear it now how be it when he the spirit
[42:56] of Truth has come will guide you into
[42:58] all truth and will show you how things
[43:00] need to
[43:03] be we need the comfort of the holy
[43:06] spirit in our
[43:08] heart in our mind and all around
[43:12] us through us in our minds our our
[43:15] thinking our emotions our we need the
[43:17] Holy Ghost to help Comfort us so we can
[43:22] change our
[43:24] lives because if we just sit and we hear
[43:26] a bunch of or dos and don'ts of what we
[43:28] have to do it is just we just don't want
[43:30] to do it amen because we can't take it
[43:33] we can't take the pain we don't enjoy it
[43:36] but we literally need to feel the
[43:38] presence of God the anesthetic to what
[43:40] it's okay to give up these things it's
[43:43] okay to come out of this it's okay to to
[43:46] start doing these things amen and that's
[43:49] the building of our spiritual
[43:51] House 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore If
[43:54] any man be in Christ he's a new creature
[43:56] old things are passed away behold All
[43:58] Things become new and all things are of
[44:00] God so I you talk about a
[44:04] change you're talk about a change I mean
[44:07] if you were right now in Hawaii it'd be
[44:10] a different it'd be a if we could just
[44:12] go like that be in Hawaii right now what
[44:14] a change of weather that would be
[44:18] am right or or if we could just be uh a
[44:21] pig just like that a
[44:24] pig that's a bad one maybe a bear maybe
[44:27] a
[44:29] bear I mean what a change that would be
[44:33] and there is such a change between being
[44:35] a regular human being and being a
[44:38] Christian am there's such a major change
[44:42] it's not uh it's not a human going to
[44:44] church and saying he's a Christian no
[44:47] being born again is your Nature has
[44:50] changed so when we make a decision to
[44:53] follow God repent and get baptized the
[44:55] construction begins
[44:57] our spiritual he starts and we Let Jesus
[45:00] begin to build our life the correct way
[45:04] because before Jesus we just did what we
[45:07] want and we didn't have our parents
[45:09] never told us now you make sure you do
[45:11] everything you want to
[45:13] do no a child from its youth wants to do
[45:16] everything it wants to do the parent has
[45:19] to say no no no we don't do that this is
[45:21] what we do amen
[45:25] right and so when God comes into our
[45:27] life we have to learn to yield our life
[45:29] to
[45:32] God his disciples were all tore up here
[45:35] in St John chapter 14 you like to turn
[45:38] or see it watch this up here because
[45:41] Jesus was leaving them soon and he said
[45:43] here in verse one of St John 14 let not
[45:46] your heart be troubled you believe in
[45:49] God believe also in me in my father's
[45:51] house are many mansions if it were not
[45:53] so I would have told you I go to prepare
[45:56] a place for you and if I go to prepare a
[45:58] place for you I will come again and
[46:00] receive you into myself that where I am
[46:02] there you may be also now Christ is
[46:06] preparing a place for
[46:08] us now that word preparing means
[46:11] providing or making ready and that's
[46:13] what Christ is doing he's providing a
[46:16] place for us and it's in his presence
[46:19] it's not a geographic
[46:25] location he's he's preparing a place in
[46:28] his presence for
[46:31] us it's not a geographic
[46:34] location God is already there in this
[46:37] place and he wants us to be there with
[46:40] him he said that where I am there you
[46:43] may be also so he's already there he's
[46:46] preparing it so we can be there with him
[46:49] amen now Christ is not looking to
[46:51] construct a natural building that's made
[46:54] with hands for us to live in God
[46:57] construction is an invisible building
[47:00] you cannot even see it with natural
[47:03] eyes second Corinthians 51 says for we
[47:06] know that if our Earthly House of this
[47:08] Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[47:10] building of God a house not made with
[47:13] hands Eternal in the
[47:17] heavens so we have a spiritual house
[47:21] that's being built right
[47:23] now Jesus said where that that that
[47:27] where I there where I am there you may
[47:29] be
[47:31] also so in order for us to be where
[47:34] Christ is at we must have the same
[47:36] character that Christ has in order for
[47:38] to be with him and this is probably the
[47:41] biggest thing that we could receive out
[47:43] of this Christ is not going to dwell
[47:47] with
[47:49] devils in fact he told us to come out to
[47:51] be
[47:52] separate so that means we just can't go
[47:55] there because our name is John Mark
[47:59] right you know and he likes gospel songs
[48:02] that doesn't put me in
[48:04] heaven he's there he's there and he's
[48:09] preparing a place that I can get
[48:11] there well he's not
[48:16] preparing his
[48:18] presence he's not preparing
[48:21] Heaven he's preparing us to get there
[48:27] and and and so the mansion that he's
[48:28] building is inside us and we've gone
[48:30] through this just a little bit but we
[48:31] want to bring out a a a point
[48:35] here to
[48:39] um God is the one that inhabits eternity
[48:42] he dwells in the high and holy place and
[48:44] just going to describe a couple things
[48:46] where of God's presence first Peter
[48:50] tells us that but he but as he is which
[48:54] have called you is Holy so be ye holy in
[48:56] all manner of conversation because he
[48:59] but because it is written be ye holy for
[49:02] I am Holy so when we think about where
[49:06] God is at there he wants us to be also
[49:09] he's in a holy place and he wants us to
[49:11] be holy are you with me Matthew 5 be ye
[49:15] therefore perfect even as your father
[49:17] which is in heaven is perfect so this
[49:19] place in heaven is a place of of
[49:23] perfectness and and God wants us to be
[49:26] there with him so he's preparing us to
[49:28] be there with him he's not going to
[49:30] change heaven for us he's not going to
[49:33] carve out a little place of heaven and
[49:35] say well you know what you don't have to
[49:37] be you can just be any way you want to
[49:39] and I'm going to put you over here that
[49:42] won't be like that because if that could
[49:45] be like that for one person I think the
[49:47] Devils could be
[49:51] there to be
[49:53] complete is to be complete in God's
[49:55] character
[49:58] and God's character is not only
[50:00] possessing perfect love but it's
[50:03] manifesting it's manifesting it even to
[50:06] our
[50:08] enemies remember brother Brandon says
[50:10] whatever you do get perfect
[50:13] love he said nothing else but perfect
[50:16] love will be there right so in order to
[50:19] be where Christ is at we must have the
[50:21] same love and the same character and
[50:24] he's calling us to press in to that
[50:26] place that's the that's the building
[50:28] that's the building process and if I
[50:32] go and prepare a place for you I will
[50:35] come again and receive you unto myself
[50:37] that where I am there you may be also
[50:40] God will not receive US unless we're
[50:42] prepared
[50:44] amen and God is preparing us how by his
[50:50] word Ephesians 5:26 says God sanctifies
[50:54] and cleanses the church with the the
[50:56] washing of the Water by the word that he
[50:59] might present to himself a glorious
[51:01] Church which he dwells in not having
[51:03] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[51:06] that we should be holy and without
[51:10] blemish see if we're not
[51:13] prepared we have no spiritual house
[51:18] right we just can't go on the basis that
[51:21] I've repented I got baptized and I
[51:23] accepted Jesus Christ as my savior
[51:26] this is such a false
[51:28] conception because if that's all that
[51:31] was needed that's all that needed to be
[51:32] written in the
[51:35] Bible he would never say search the
[51:38] scriptures he would say search that
[51:42] scripture so when we start we're just
[51:44] starting the building process but our
[51:46] whole character needs to become like his
[51:50] John 1717 Jesus speaking here he says
[51:52] sanctify them through thy truth Thy Word
[51:56] is truth so there's that process of
[51:59] coming out and sanctifying and cleansing
[52:01] we take baths we take showers we do that
[52:04] with the purpose of getting clean am and
[52:07] and and with God we we want God to
[52:10] cleanse our heart we want God to cleanse
[52:12] our life we want God to take out the
[52:15] wrong character we want to become more
[52:17] like Christ and if that desire is strong
[52:19] enough then you want to build your
[52:21] spiritual
[52:23] house you think about this
[52:27] every the Bible says that hell was
[52:29] created for the devil and his angels
[52:31] unfortunately all that believe them go
[52:33] there too but here's the thing there
[52:35] won't be one devil or one person in hell
[52:39] that at one point will not wish they
[52:41] were in
[52:45] heaven but there won't be one person in
[52:47] heaven that will regret being in
[52:55] heaven if we never get prepared we will
[52:58] never have our spiritual
[53:01] house the bride of Christ will take the
[53:04] word of God and will become the
[53:06] manifested word in this hour Revelations
[53:09] 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give
[53:11] honor to him for the marriage of the
[53:13] Lamb has come and his wife have made
[53:16] herself ready well what did she do she
[53:18] went to church she heard the word and
[53:21] she took the word and she said I'm going
[53:22] to start doing
[53:25] that and and if you miss that process in
[53:28] your life if you just come to church if
[53:32] you just listen if you just read but you
[53:34] do not take the word and you do not make
[53:36] it part of your life you will not be
[53:39] prepared you will not be ready
[53:43] amen now we are workers together with
[53:46] Christ 2 Corinthians 6 tells us this so
[53:49] when you read your Bible that is God's
[53:51] desire of us when we hear the five-fold
[53:54] ministry uh Ministry uh gospel preached
[53:58] to us that is God speaking to us when we
[54:01] pray when we listen to
[54:03] types something comes to our remembrance
[54:06] that's the Holy Ghost speaking to us you
[54:08] need to pay attention this you need to
[54:10] do this that is God speaking to us
[54:12] that's God doing his part but how do we
[54:14] work together with him we say Okay
[54:17] Lord I'll move those bricks I'll do that
[54:21] and that's you working together with
[54:22] Christ to build your
[54:24] house it isn't like I'm I'm I I I go to
[54:28] prepare a place for you and don't worry
[54:30] about anything I'll take care of it it
[54:33] ain't like that
[54:35] anymore you can just do what you want
[54:37] I'll take care of it all expenses
[54:42] paid no must Jesus bear the cross alone
[54:47] no there's a cross for me We Must Die
[54:49] daily let the and give God our will amen
[54:53] give God our will this is God working in
[54:57] you in your spiritual house we're
[55:01] workers together by obeying the word of
[55:03] God Philippians chapter 2
[55:06] vers2 I love this scripture because this
[55:09] really is the essence of the working of
[55:13] God building inside of us Philippians
[55:16] chap 2:12 wherefore my beloved as ye
[55:20] have always obeyed not in my presence
[55:24] only but now much more in my absence
[55:28] work out your own
[55:31] salvation with fear and
[55:34] trembling so it is God in
[55:39] you
[55:41] working God in you
[55:44] speaking and he says work out this
[55:48] salvation work out your
[55:51] own you know too often we're worried
[55:53] about somebody else's and we're not
[55:54] working on our own we need to work out
[55:57] our own salvation with fear and
[56:00] trembling in other words I could be
[56:01] wrong it may not pass cold I may not
[56:03] make it I I I may be just one thing thou
[56:07] lackest there needs to be some fear and
[56:10] trembling about
[56:11] building not just this casual in need of
[56:15] nothing lukewarm I'm G to make it
[56:18] because I feel
[56:20] good no for it is God which worketh in
[56:26] you I love that for it is God which
[56:30] worketh in you both to Will and to do of
[56:33] his good pleasure see I go to prepare a
[56:36] place for you that where I'm at you may
[56:38] be there also God is coming into our
[56:40] hearts not not just our physical heart
[56:43] now I'm talking about our spiritual
[56:46] heart
[56:47] amen I'm talking about where the desire
[56:50] of our character is at he's coming in
[56:52] there and he's working in you to change
[56:57] change to
[57:03] change
[57:08] change now here's the thing if we don't
[57:11] want to
[57:12] change then we don't want to be in God's
[57:16] presence you're not going to get in
[57:18] God's
[57:19] presence and feel like you don't have to
[57:22] change that is not the nature of God
[57:26] I do believe that God's blessings just
[57:28] come and they shower sometimes I do I do
[57:31] believe that the refreshing I
[57:35] do but I also believe that the character
[57:38] of God is not to leave us as children
[57:39] but to grow
[57:41] up and so there's change that's needed
[57:44] God don't need to change God don't need
[57:47] to change to fit the way we think things
[57:49] ought to be we're the ones that need the
[57:51] change I just love this for it is God
[57:54] which worketh in you both to Will to do
[57:56] of his good pleasure I'm so glad that
[57:59] God can speak to my
[58:01] heart do all things do all your working
[58:06] without murmurings and
[58:12] disputings oh whatever okay I
[58:18] will that don't look like a love affair
[58:21] that you want to be with
[58:24] Jesus that you may be blameless and
[58:27] harmless the sons of God without rebuke
[58:29] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[58:31] nation which whom you shine as lights in
[58:34] the world holding forth the word of life
[58:37] that I may rejoice in the day of Christ
[58:39] that I have not run in vain neither
[58:41] labored in vain I believe this with all
[58:44] my heart there'll be more people who
[58:46] miss it who started the race than those
[58:48] that started the race and
[58:51] finish because most people start the
[58:54] race and think all you got to do is this
[58:55] this and this and everything's
[58:59] okay you got to keep going you got to
[59:02] hold your confidence steadfast to the
[59:04] end you got to be I am
[59:07] determined the bride remember the Bride
[59:09] is a small
[59:11] group there there there there was a a a
[59:14] church in the
[59:16] church and that church in the church
[59:19] heard the voice that was in the
[59:22] voice so it's not for everybody but I'll
[59:25] say it like this for the bride they
[59:26] hunger for that voice they hunger for
[59:29] the Revelation they hunger to see the
[59:31] change they hunger to see Christ
[59:33] manifest in their life they will not be
[59:35] satisfied until they awake in his
[59:39] likeness now all we have to do is come
[59:41] to Christ that's all we have to
[59:43] do and when we come to him we have to do
[59:47] what he wants us to do amen John 14:2 in
[59:51] my father's house are many mansions if
[59:53] it were not so I would have told you I
[59:55] go to prepare a place for you and if I
[59:57] go to prepare a place for you I will
[59:59] come again and I will receive you unto
[1:00:01] myself that where I am you may be
[1:00:04] also so where is Christ if he's given us
[1:00:08] his word where is Christ Christ is in
[1:00:10] his word Christ is the
[1:00:12] word verse four and whether I go you
[1:00:15] know and the way you know and Thomas
[1:00:17] sayith Lord we know not whether thou
[1:00:20] goest and how can we know the way and
[1:00:23] Jesus saith unto him I I am am the way I
[1:00:27] am the truth I am the life and no man
[1:00:31] cometh to the father but by
[1:00:34] me if he had known me you should have
[1:00:36] known the my father also and from hence
[1:00:39] forth you know him and have seen him so
[1:00:43] the way to the father's house is through
[1:00:45] Christ and Christ alone and Christ is
[1:00:47] the word St John 1 verse one says in the
[1:00:50] beginning was the
[1:00:52] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:00:55] word was God this is why it's important
[1:00:58] to read the Bible right
[1:01:00] there because this is who God
[1:01:03] is we can't go to church and listen to
[1:01:07] Somebody speak behind the pulpit and say
[1:01:09] that's
[1:01:10] God because which church do we go
[1:01:14] to which
[1:01:17] God but this is
[1:01:20] God that's why it's important to come to
[1:01:23] church bring your Bible and make sure
[1:01:24] that brother John is reading out of the
[1:01:26] black out of the
[1:01:29] book I'm just trying to provoke you to
[1:01:32] get more serious with the word and not
[1:01:35] just have the comfort of coming to
[1:01:37] church and and hearing A good sermon a
[1:01:41] bad sermon however you want to say
[1:01:42] it's we must find Christ for
[1:01:45] oursel and Christ is in the word verse
[1:01:49] two the same was in the beginning with
[1:01:52] God and all things were made by him and
[1:01:56] without him not anything was not
[1:01:59] anything made that was made the word
[1:02:03] Christ made
[1:02:06] everything and the word verse 14 verse
[1:02:09] 14 the word was made
[1:02:12] flesh and it dwelt among us and we
[1:02:15] beheld his glory the glory as the only
[1:02:17] begotten of the father full of grace and
[1:02:19] full of
[1:02:21] Truth we cannot separate Jesus Christ
[1:02:24] from the word they are
[1:02:29] identical that same the Bible says he
[1:02:32] that rejecteth me and receiveth not my
[1:02:38] word have one that will judge him the
[1:02:42] word that I have spoken unto him shall
[1:02:43] judge him in the last day this very same
[1:02:46] word that people reject today is the
[1:02:49] very same word that they will meet on
[1:02:50] the day of judgment amen and this is the
[1:02:53] only thing right here is the only thing
[1:02:55] that can change my
[1:02:57] nature this word is the only thing that
[1:03:00] can change my nature when I read it and
[1:03:02] I say oh I am not doing that then
[1:03:04] conviction
[1:03:06] comes says oh Lord help me and that help
[1:03:10] me is what God is looking for amen
[1:03:13] that's what he's looking for the Lord
[1:03:15] help me if you if you come to church
[1:03:17] hear the word but you don't have Lord
[1:03:19] help me he can't prepare you we're be
[1:03:24] we're we're only only hearers of the
[1:03:25] word and not doers
[1:03:27] then Colossians 2:9 says for in him
[1:03:31] dwells all the fullness of the godhead
[1:03:33] body and ye are complete in him I love
[1:03:37] that you are
[1:03:39] complete right Jesus said be ye perfect
[1:03:42] that means complete you are complete in
[1:03:45] him which is the head of all
[1:03:47] principalities and Powers so the more
[1:03:49] you can get in him the better
[1:03:57] get in them all the
[1:03:58] way wherever you're at get in them
[1:04:02] more don't dabble in the question I'm in
[1:04:05] there far enough do not do that stay
[1:04:09] away from that Paul never had that
[1:04:12] mentality he didn't say I've apprehended
[1:04:15] I've attained I'm in there far enough no
[1:04:18] his attitude was I need more to know you
[1:04:22] more to have more of you oh I want to
[1:04:25] know in the power of your Resurrection
[1:04:27] in The Fellowship of your sufferings am
[1:04:29] there's got to be more I'm pressing
[1:04:31] towards
[1:04:33] it that's where we need to be with our
[1:04:35] desire the more that we desire that I'm
[1:04:39] not talking about knowing god knowledge
[1:04:41] I'm talking about knowing god by
[1:04:43] experience the more you're willing to
[1:04:47] change the more you touch the heart of
[1:04:50] God because see God is already there in
[1:04:53] you he's already
[1:04:56] working talking
[1:05:00] speaking but if we're doing things with
[1:05:02] murmuring and complaining or we're just
[1:05:05] kind of resisting just kind of putting
[1:05:07] off or just hoping that our conscience
[1:05:09] can be satisfied with just going to
[1:05:11] church and we're not really getting
[1:05:13] serious with God then we're not building
[1:05:16] our spiritual house and tell me when
[1:05:17] it's all over when life is all over
[1:05:20] where is your spiritual health going to
[1:05:22] be because if you're not building here
[1:05:25] it's not going to be there that's right
[1:05:28] that's how serious it needs to
[1:05:31] be Colossians 1:15 Jesus Christ is the
[1:05:35] image of the invisible God the firstborn
[1:05:37] of every
[1:05:39] creature Romans tells us the firstborn
[1:05:41] among many Brethren verse 16 for by him
[1:05:44] were all things created that are in
[1:05:46] heaven and that Earth visible and
[1:05:48] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[1:05:50] dominions principalities or Powers all
[1:05:52] things were created by Him and for him
[1:05:55] and he is before all things and by him
[1:05:58] all things consist and he is our
[1:06:01] head he is the head of the body the
[1:06:04] church the the word the word of God is
[1:06:07] our head Hallelujah the word of God is
[1:06:11] our head not our reasoning not our
[1:06:14] thinking not our
[1:06:15] emotions not what we want to do what we
[1:06:18] don't want to do what we pick and choose
[1:06:19] the word is the
[1:06:22] head the Capstone
[1:06:26] who is the beginning the first born from
[1:06:28] the dead that in all things he might
[1:06:30] have the
[1:06:33] preeminence for it pleased the father
[1:06:35] that in him should
[1:06:37] dwell should dwell should all fullness
[1:06:41] dwell I think that's what God wants with
[1:06:44] with us have you ever been in a
[1:06:48] um a a a fight with somebody I don't
[1:06:51] mean
[1:06:52] physically but to where you're having a
[1:06:55] battle
[1:06:59] about what you're going to
[1:07:02] do what you're going to
[1:07:04] eat where you're going to go has anybody
[1:07:08] ever been in that before I mean this is
[1:07:11] kind of a common thing
[1:07:15] right now at that time that you're in a
[1:07:19] battle and kids are like this with
[1:07:21] parents and parents are like this with
[1:07:24] kids both both parties is wanting the
[1:07:30] preeminence I I want my way I want my
[1:07:33] way you had your way last time I want my
[1:07:37] way God wants his way in her life and
[1:07:41] we've got to be real with God that we're
[1:07:44] the ones that fighting against
[1:07:47] him that we can we can say Amen to the
[1:07:50] word but we're not going to submit to
[1:07:52] the
[1:07:52] word right it's a in other words we we
[1:07:55] can agree with the word but that's not
[1:07:57] what the word amen means amen doesn't
[1:07:59] say I agree with it amen means so be it
[1:08:03] in me so be it let it happen in me and
[1:08:06] and and we've got to give God the
[1:08:08] preeminence that's why when we come to
[1:08:10] church we hear the word we need to enter
[1:08:11] into that word God let it be preeminent
[1:08:14] in my
[1:08:15] life I I don't don't mean it wrong but a
[1:08:18] song leader should not stand up here and
[1:08:20] say we need to praise the Lord there
[1:08:22] should be something inside of us
[1:08:24] praising the Lord
[1:08:28] give him the preeminence he inhabits the
[1:08:30] Praises of his
[1:08:34] people our opening scripture in Matthew
[1:08:37] 24 7:24 every building needs a proper
[1:08:42] Foundation therefore whosoever heareth
[1:08:44] these sayings of mine and doeth them I
[1:08:47] will liken him unto a wise man which
[1:08:51] built his house upon a
[1:08:53] rock and the Reigns you said descended
[1:08:55] the floods came and the winds blew and
[1:08:57] beat upon the house and it was and it
[1:08:59] fell
[1:09:00] not Why didn't it fall for it was
[1:09:02] founded upon a rock and everyone that
[1:09:07] heareth the Saints of mine and doeth
[1:09:08] them not shall be liken unto a foolish
[1:09:11] man which built his house upon the
[1:09:14] sand the rain descended the floods came
[1:09:17] the winds blew and beat upon the house
[1:09:19] and it fell and great great was the fall
[1:09:23] of it now here Jesus is identifying his
[1:09:27] words as being a solid rock Foundation
[1:09:29] to every man's life Jesus said Upon This
[1:09:33] Rock I'll build my church and the Gates
[1:09:34] of Hell shall not Prevail against it in
[1:09:38] other words the rains descended the
[1:09:39] floods came the winds blew and beat upon
[1:09:41] the
[1:09:44] house when it's built on the house when
[1:09:47] it's built upon Christ the word I don't
[1:09:49] care what trial goes on in your life it
[1:09:52] will stand
[1:09:56] because you made Christ your dwelling
[1:10:01] place now the story in the Bible about
[1:10:04] the Great Walls of of
[1:10:07] Jericho they fell we remember the
[1:10:11] story I mean this these walls were 13
[1:10:13] foot tall about and they were about six
[1:10:17] foot wide now that is a pretty strong
[1:10:20] wall right this is much thinner that's
[1:10:22] much thinner that's probably 8 in and
[1:10:25] that's concrete that you know you're not
[1:10:26] going to knock that down but these
[1:10:28] babies were 6 foot
[1:10:31] wide but they fell and they fell when
[1:10:35] the when the trials came because it was
[1:10:38] not built on the word of
[1:10:43] God I I can't believe I didn't hear one
[1:10:46] amen with that
[1:10:50] thing look if Jericho would have been
[1:10:53] standing on the word of God it'd be
[1:10:54] standing
[1:10:56] am so it it don't matter how great our
[1:10:59] life is how much money we got wherever
[1:11:01] we're standing if our life isn't built
[1:11:04] on Christ it's not going to
[1:11:07] stand so we need our foundation to be
[1:11:11] Christ the
[1:11:13] word we must make sure that we build
[1:11:16] upon we build our spiritual house upon
[1:11:19] God's word it's the only foundation
[1:11:22] Ephesians
[1:11:23] 2:20 we are built upon the foundation of
[1:11:28] the Apostles and Prophets Christ Jesus
[1:11:33] himself being the Chief Cornerstone
[1:11:36] that's why we can have confidence when
[1:11:38] we're reading the Bible here and the
[1:11:40] words are not written and
[1:11:42] read that they were written by the
[1:11:45] Apostles of God it's still the word of
[1:11:48] God I've heard some people say well I
[1:11:50] believe what Jesus said uh father son
[1:11:53] Holy Ghost over what Peter
[1:11:56] said because he said in the name of the
[1:11:58] Lord Jesus
[1:12:00] Christ that's just somebody that is
[1:12:02] caral has no spiritual understanding has
[1:12:05] not got the
[1:12:07] Revelation the word is not going to
[1:12:09] contradict
[1:12:11] itself I'd rather doubt myself than
[1:12:14] doubt the word because the word is
[1:12:18] perfect all right verse 21 in whom all
[1:12:22] the building fitly framed together
[1:12:26] groweth into a holy Temple in the Lord
[1:12:30] in whom you also are builded together
[1:12:33] for a habitation of God through the
[1:12:37] spirit notice through the spirit I just
[1:12:39] I just we just we ought to long for the
[1:12:41] Holy Spirit to cool over us woo over us
[1:12:44] and begin to to work in our heart and
[1:12:46] speak to us and say this is what I want
[1:12:48] you to do son this is what I want you to
[1:12:50] do daughter this is the next step in
[1:12:52] your life this is what I want you to
[1:12:53] take not sit there and wait I really
[1:12:55] want God to compliment me on how well
[1:12:57] I'm
[1:13:07] doing I think we need to as that song we
[1:13:11] sung when we first started humble
[1:13:14] yourself let him have his
[1:13:23] way God is
[1:13:27] serious about building you a
[1:13:32] place we have to be serious about
[1:13:36] working with him have a little bit more
[1:13:38] fear and
[1:13:39] trembling have a little bit I could be
[1:13:42] wrong maybe I missed something maybe do
[1:13:45] what the prophet said which is come to
[1:13:46] the house of the Lord with an attitude
[1:13:48] to find out where you're at with
[1:13:50] Christ because it's a working in the
[1:13:53] spirit realm it's not the natural ears
[1:13:56] and the natural mind and the
[1:13:58] understanding it's it's really seeing
[1:14:00] God that he's
[1:14:02] here 1 Corinthians chapter 3:9 says for
[1:14:06] we are laborers together with
[1:14:11] God ye are God's
[1:14:14] husbandry and ye are God's
[1:14:17] Building according to the grace of God
[1:14:20] given which is uh I'm sorry according to
[1:14:23] the grace of God which is given to me as
[1:14:27] a wise master builder in other words
[1:14:31] Paul made sure he made everything
[1:14:34] according to
[1:14:36] cold before he penned it he made sure
[1:14:40] the the Bible says that the the Bible
[1:14:42] was not written by men of old but they
[1:14:46] were holy men of old as they were moved
[1:14:49] upon by the Holy
[1:14:52] Ghost and he's a wise master Builder we
[1:14:55] have to be wise Master Builders we have
[1:14:57] to make sure that what we're doing is
[1:14:59] really a pleasing to the Lord you know
[1:15:00] one of the the hardest things I I I I
[1:15:03] think has has hurt so many uh Christians
[1:15:06] is they get used to their their their
[1:15:08] Church attendance as being the only
[1:15:10] thing that they need to do to please
[1:15:14] God in other words they're not even
[1:15:16] thinking about a building process there
[1:15:19] are people in this message who just feel
[1:15:22] that all they got to do is just be here
[1:15:23] and agree with what me with the preacher
[1:15:26] saying they're going to miss
[1:15:30] it according to the grace of God which
[1:15:33] is given unto me as a wise master
[1:15:36] builder I have laid the foundation and
[1:15:38] another build it thereon but let every
[1:15:41] man take heed now let him take heed how
[1:15:45] he builth there on thereup take
[1:15:50] heed no I got baptized I repented
[1:15:55] no every day you're
[1:15:57] building we're in a building process for
[1:16:00] other Foundation can no man lay than
[1:16:03] that which is laid which is Jesus Christ
[1:16:06] and the word is our foundation that's
[1:16:08] what he gave us and every decision for
[1:16:11] the rest of our life should be based
[1:16:13] upon the word of
[1:16:14] God that should be what's pumping in
[1:16:17] every decision not well this is church
[1:16:20] I'll leave church here and now I'm going
[1:16:21] to go and live my life and and do what I
[1:16:24] want to do and you know when uh when it
[1:16:25] comes Church T I'm G to come back to
[1:16:27] church and we're g to talk about the
[1:16:29] word h that means that that thinking is
[1:16:33] more like I got a natural mansion on the
[1:16:36] other side I got a natural
[1:16:42] Mansion we have a chance to be
[1:16:46] working with Christ on this
[1:16:50] project and all we have to do is Lord
[1:16:53] what what would you have me to do
[1:16:56] what you have me to do and it may seem
[1:16:58] so simple he may say something like this
[1:17:00] I want you to start praying 20 minutes
[1:17:03] every
[1:17:03] day it may be that
[1:17:09] simple whatever it
[1:17:12] is like Mary said whatever he say just
[1:17:14] do it just do
[1:17:17] it because it'll lead to the next thing
[1:17:20] then the next thing and then the next
[1:17:21] thing the Bible says Psalms 1119 th word
[1:17:25] is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto
[1:17:29] my path we need this word this is why we
[1:17:31] need to read it and and and think about
[1:17:34] it and say Lord help me to do
[1:17:38] it we must read our Bible every day as
[1:17:43] often as you can and just ask God in
[1:17:46] Simplicity God help me help me to build
[1:17:51] with you to to work with you you ever
[1:17:53] work with somebody they were just so
[1:17:56] stubborn oh I had I had somebody that
[1:17:59] worked with me they're so
[1:18:02] stubborn I would say guaranteed most
[1:18:05] people could not work with
[1:18:07] them but I was so much into being in
[1:18:10] unity that I did not care about having
[1:18:13] the
[1:18:14] preeminence it's a
[1:18:19] truth and you know what was happening
[1:18:21] then brother Marty is God was building
[1:18:23] my character that's what was
[1:18:26] happening it it didn't have anything to
[1:18:28] do with trusted tool it had to do with
[1:18:31] God wanting to have preeminence in me
[1:18:34] because when it's all said and done that
[1:18:35] thing's blowing up that thing's burning
[1:18:38] and no matter what's left over right
[1:18:41] it's still going but what's going to
[1:18:44] remain is our character that the most
[1:18:46] important thing is give God preeminence
[1:18:50] give God pre let the word be preeminent
[1:18:52] in your life second othy 3:5 we read
[1:18:56] these scriptures in our our men's
[1:18:58] meeting as well last
[1:18:59] Wednesday the holy scriptures that the
[1:19:02] holy scriptures are able to make us wise
[1:19:07] unto
[1:19:08] salvation through faith which is in
[1:19:11] Christ Jesus in other words when you
[1:19:12] believe that that scripture is truly for
[1:19:15] you
[1:19:16] personally all the scriptures all
[1:19:18] scripture is given by the inspiration of
[1:19:22] God man didn't have anything to do with
[1:19:24] it
[1:19:25] it was all
[1:19:28] God and it's profitable for our
[1:19:31] Doctrine for Repro for correction for
[1:19:35] instruction in
[1:19:36] righteousness that we the men of God may
[1:19:40] be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[1:19:44] good works right how
[1:19:47] beautiful now usually when we build a
[1:19:49] home we start from the ground and we
[1:19:53] work our way up
[1:19:58] we we don't we don't put the foundation
[1:20:01] in and say okay let's put the roof
[1:20:03] on right we we we start with the walls
[1:20:06] and we start at the bottom we we work
[1:20:07] our way up and sometimes it's a twostory
[1:20:10] and you got to go
[1:20:11] up and you go up as far as you're going
[1:20:14] to go and then you put a you put the cap
[1:20:16] on it the roof on
[1:20:19] it and and then you begin to cover the
[1:20:22] outside
[1:20:24] and then you you you put your inside
[1:20:26] walls
[1:20:27] in and then you got all your your
[1:20:29] electrical and you got your plumbing and
[1:20:31] you got your heating and you got your
[1:20:33] special hey can you bring me up some
[1:20:36] coffee you know your your little thing
[1:20:39] from one room to the Next Room whatever
[1:20:40] else called it your Cal
[1:20:44] intercom got your
[1:20:46] thermostat all that in the
[1:20:48] walls you got your shoot for the clothes
[1:20:51] to go
[1:20:52] down all that stuff has to be worked
[1:20:57] in and then you you begin to you put
[1:20:59] your drywall on and you you you you you
[1:21:02] paint it and you you get it looking like
[1:21:07] what a nice place to be because you
[1:21:09] certainly want want to live in a house
[1:21:10] without drywall looking at all that
[1:21:12] stuff not
[1:21:15] enjoyable so you got to understand that
[1:21:17] when God is working in your life no
[1:21:21] matter what you want him to work on he
[1:21:23] may be working on something underneath
[1:21:27] that and and brother BR said like this
[1:21:29] God is not obligated to give you
[1:21:31] anything more if you don't do what he's
[1:21:32] already said so it's important to pay
[1:21:36] attention that every word of God is
[1:21:38] important to God it ought to be
[1:21:40] important to
[1:21:42] us so a there's no different with our
[1:21:45] our our lives we're we have a spiritual
[1:21:48] house we're building but I'll say it
[1:21:50] like this what is our spiritual house
[1:21:52] just just trying to put it in a
[1:21:53] perspective right here so we can get an
[1:21:55] idea what is God's spiritual house or
[1:21:57] what is our spiritual house it is
[1:22:01] nothing but the character of Jesus
[1:22:05] Christ you can write that in you can
[1:22:07] take that you can meet yourself all the
[1:22:09] way to heaven on that your spiritual
[1:22:12] house is the character of Jesus Christ
[1:22:14] amen that is what we should be building
[1:22:16] in our life is the character of Christ
[1:22:19] the character of Christ is already there
[1:22:22] he is there he is character that's what
[1:22:24] he dwells
[1:22:27] in but he's trying to build it in US am
[1:22:31] he's trying to prepare it in
[1:22:34] us and if we don't let him have prence
[1:22:36] we'll never have the character you know
[1:22:38] we may have a bunch of stickers and a
[1:22:40] bunch of I I uh I I I've got church
[1:22:43] attendance I've got this I've got that I
[1:22:45] I've spoken tongues i' I've done many
[1:22:47] good works I've I've prophesied we can
[1:22:49] maybe have those things but if we do not
[1:22:51] have the character of Christ we really
[1:22:54] do not have a spiritual house to stand
[1:22:58] in because Jesus said I know you've done
[1:23:00] all those things but you know what
[1:23:02] depart from me right depart from me
[1:23:05] other words I did not prepare that what
[1:23:08] I prepared is
[1:23:10] character so we're workers together with
[1:23:14] Christ to build his character in us
[1:23:18] which means we got to get rid of our
[1:23:19] character all right I want to read these
[1:23:21] kind of quick because we got some stuff
[1:23:23] to move through that's why I'm moving
[1:23:24] kind of fast are you getting something
[1:23:26] out of this all right second Peter chap
[1:23:28] 1:3 talking about that starting at the
[1:23:31] bottom and working our way up according
[1:23:33] as his divine power has given unto us
[1:23:35] all things that pertaineth unto life and
[1:23:38] godliness through the knowledge of him
[1:23:40] that called us to glory and virtue
[1:23:42] whereby are giving unto us exceeding
[1:23:45] great and precious promises that by
[1:23:47] these you would be partakers of God's
[1:23:50] divine nature having escaped the
[1:23:53] corruption that is in in the world
[1:23:55] through lust so there it is come out of
[1:23:57] her my people be separate in your life
[1:23:59] you should be able to to to note that
[1:24:02] these are the evil things that I need to
[1:24:03] get away from right these are the evil
[1:24:07] things that are trying to attack me
[1:24:09] these are the evil things coming through
[1:24:10] the screen these are the evil things
[1:24:12] that are coming through our phones we
[1:24:14] are about to identify uh you know this
[1:24:17] this thing of of hatred this thing of uh
[1:24:20] I'm going to put my will first that's an
[1:24:22] evil thing right and we got to separate
[1:24:24] that and and know that we've got to come
[1:24:27] to Christ all right and besides this
[1:24:31] let's give all diligence we add to the
[1:24:35] foundation of our faith
[1:24:40] virtue right the first is Faith I
[1:24:42] believe that what the preacher said is
[1:24:44] right I believe what the word says I
[1:24:46] believe I believe that what I need to do
[1:24:48] is repent get baptized that's the
[1:24:50] beginning that's my foundation and now
[1:24:52] I'm going to start building my house
[1:24:55] so we from uh from virtue from faith we
[1:24:59] add virtue virtue knowledge knowledge
[1:25:02] Temperance Temperance patience patience
[1:25:04] godliness godliness brotherly kindness
[1:25:07] and I'm telling you that's a lot of
[1:25:10] stuff that's a lot of
[1:25:13] stuff I mean don't try to add brotherly
[1:25:16] kindness if you don't got any
[1:25:19] strength if you don't got any knowledge
[1:25:22] if you don't got patience and temperance
[1:25:25] because you need those things to build
[1:25:29] brotherly
[1:25:31] kindness and brotherly
[1:25:33] kindness charity we've talked about
[1:25:36] charity is the Capstone I'll say it like
[1:25:38] this charity is the Capstone to every
[1:25:42] believer's
[1:25:45] character it is the character of
[1:25:48] Christ for if these things be in you and
[1:25:51] abound they make you that you should
[1:25:53] nether be un fruitful neither be Barren
[1:25:57] or UNF nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:26:00] of our Lord Jesus Christ now you know
[1:26:02] want to know what knowledge of the Lord
[1:26:04] Jesus Christ is the knowledge of the
[1:26:07] Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:26:10] not I'm gonna pull out that
[1:26:13] scripture that's not the knowledge of
[1:26:15] Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus
[1:26:17] Christ is you got a a situation going on
[1:26:20] right here and God comes to the
[1:26:21] Forefront with what is need to meet that
[1:26:23] need
[1:26:25] that's where we should not be Barren and
[1:26:28] unfruitful we should have Christ alive
[1:26:30] in our life Christ moving in our life
[1:26:33] that's what Christ is Desiring to be
[1:26:35] preeminent so he can take care of
[1:26:38] things but he that lath these things is
[1:26:42] blind and cannot see a far off and has
[1:26:45] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:26:46] old sins wherefore the rather Brethren
[1:26:50] give some diligence to make your calling
[1:26:53] and ction
[1:26:57] sure for if you do these things you
[1:26:59] shall never fall you know most people
[1:27:01] don't even know what the word sure
[1:27:10] means hey would you would you like a
[1:27:12] coffee or pop or juice or milk or yeah
[1:27:15] sure sure
[1:27:17] sure sure is
[1:27:20] sure sure is this is a screen this is a
[1:27:24] picture this is wood that's sure sure is
[1:27:28] sure and we need to make sure our
[1:27:30] election is
[1:27:34] sure and we can't get that
[1:27:39] Assurance you know all you got to do is
[1:27:42] just look at where you're being drawn to
[1:27:45] the change that's happening we ought to
[1:27:46] be able to come to church and I don't
[1:27:48] care how long we've been going to church
[1:27:49] we ought to be coming to church and
[1:27:51] saying things are changing in my life
[1:27:56] that's how close things ought to be
[1:27:58] because God said he's not going to take
[1:28:00] you until you're most ready obviously we
[1:28:02] all here on the same bow we're not ready
[1:28:06] yet
[1:28:08] so I believe in testimonies we should be
[1:28:13] testifying for so in entrance shall be
[1:28:16] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[1:28:19] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and our
[1:28:20] Savior Jesus Christ now our spiritual
[1:28:24] house is God's own
[1:28:27] character God dwells in his own
[1:28:30] character so if you want God to dwell in
[1:28:32] you more then you get more of God's
[1:28:34] character he said he gives the Holy
[1:28:36] Ghost to them that obey him right the
[1:28:40] Holy Ghost says Amen to every word of
[1:28:41] God and and obviously there's not enough
[1:28:44] Holy Ghost to just we the holy ghost
[1:28:47] does not dwell in us to in a fullness
[1:28:49] measure that's why we sin we backslide
[1:28:52] we make mistakes I we we understand that
[1:28:56] but here's the thing God gives you just
[1:28:58] enough that he he wants you to walk in
[1:29:00] that light walk in the light as he is in
[1:29:02] the
[1:29:03] light and so he gives us more light to
[1:29:06] walk in and if we're obedient we walk in
[1:29:08] that light then you know what he does he
[1:29:10] gives himself more to you he fills you
[1:29:12] with more joy more peace more love more
[1:29:16] more more happiness more
[1:29:19] everything but trying to be a Christian
[1:29:23] and not not be
[1:29:26] committed is the most miserable
[1:29:29] life a person could
[1:29:32] live he'd rather he' be better off being
[1:29:36] out in the world having nothing to do
[1:29:38] with
[1:29:39] God and I and and that's that was the
[1:29:42] advice that Jesus gave I'd rather have
[1:29:43] you hey make a decision cold or hot but
[1:29:46] this
[1:29:49] lukewarm hypocrisy
[1:29:54] Jesus said by this shall all men know
[1:29:57] what's this by this
[1:30:00] characteristic by this characteristic
[1:30:03] shall all men know that you're my
[1:30:04] disciples when you have love one for
[1:30:08] another when you have the character to
[1:30:11] love the way that God loves not I mean
[1:30:14] look at one time we all loved our
[1:30:16] parents even if we don't like him
[1:30:20] now that sounded bad right there was a
[1:30:23] point in our life that we just didn't
[1:30:25] really care about our parents or we
[1:30:27] didn't agree with them or we yelled at
[1:30:30] them and got mad and whatever you
[1:30:32] understand what I'm
[1:30:35] saying but I forgive you it's okay let's
[1:30:37] go
[1:30:38] forward I'm not talking about that type
[1:30:41] of love I'm talking about the type of
[1:30:44] love that it doesn't matter what anybody
[1:30:46] does to
[1:30:49] you that you still love
[1:30:52] them now I'm not saying you won't go
[1:30:55] through a 60-second moment of
[1:30:57] battle I mean that's just human that's
[1:31:00] realistic but you don't Harbor things
[1:31:03] inside you don't keep things inside and
[1:31:06] then still say you got the love of God
[1:31:09] that that's not
[1:31:11] it God does not dwell in power
[1:31:16] alone he dwells in
[1:31:19] character Satan dwells in power alone
[1:31:24] but he
[1:31:25] manipulates and he controls others with
[1:31:28] his power but he has no character where
[1:31:32] Jesus comes to us we sit here we listen
[1:31:34] to a sermon he gives us his word and he
[1:31:37] gives us the
[1:31:39] choice the choice would you like to come
[1:31:43] closer to me or would you are you
[1:31:46] satisfied with where you're at that's
[1:31:49] character so he has power but he doesn't
[1:31:51] manipulate
[1:31:55] God dwells in character and if I could
[1:31:57] say
[1:31:58] this if I could say in this way the
[1:32:01] Capstone of God's character is divine
[1:32:08] love first John chapter
[1:32:11] 4:12 no man have seen God at any time
[1:32:16] can anybody say they've seen
[1:32:20] God let me read this again brother no
[1:32:22] man has seen God at any time
[1:32:26] no well we got to understand in the way
[1:32:29] that John wrote
[1:32:34] it because remember God's an invisible
[1:32:36] God but we do see him by Revelation amen
[1:32:40] if we love but but the point that he's
[1:32:42] trying to say is that no man has seen
[1:32:44] God right but if we love one another
[1:32:48] then God dwells in us and his love is
[1:32:51] perfected in us so we came can't prove
[1:32:54] it with these eyes but if he's loving
[1:32:57] through us if he's manifesting that love
[1:32:59] through us then it proves that we do see
[1:33:02] him hereby know we that we dwell in him
[1:33:07] talking about our spiritual house and he
[1:33:09] in us because he has given us of his
[1:33:15] Spirit verse 16 and we have known and
[1:33:19] believed the love that God have to us
[1:33:23] God is love
[1:33:24] God is love and he that dwelleth in love
[1:33:29] dwelleth in God and God in
[1:33:34] him so is the thing that we don't think
[1:33:38] that much of which is honestly being
[1:33:41] able to love those that we got a problem
[1:33:43] with that little thing that we don't put
[1:33:46] much attention to is really the proof of
[1:33:49] whether we're dwelling in Christ or
[1:33:52] not because
[1:33:54] we it is very we are born with the
[1:33:56] ability to have respected persons I go
[1:33:59] to Dad Dad give me this
[1:34:03] no Mom Mom can I have that thing that
[1:34:06] Dad wouldn't give
[1:34:09] me yes you know I love you son oh Mama
[1:34:12] you're the
[1:34:14] best we have no problem being respected
[1:34:17] persons with one
[1:34:20] another but to have no respect a person
[1:34:24] that means to love even your enemy the
[1:34:27] same can I can I do some quotes I'm done
[1:34:31] with the word but can I do some some
[1:34:34] quotes thank
[1:34:36] you if not I'm sorry I'm still going to
[1:34:39] do
[1:34:41] them this is the quotes I would say on
[1:34:44] the importance of God's character in our
[1:34:46] life brother BR said Thea Church agent
[1:34:48] says think it not strange concerning the
[1:34:50] fiery trials which are to try you that
[1:34:53] it was what Peter said it is strange
[1:34:56] that God wants us to develop a
[1:34:58] Christlike character that comes through
[1:35:02] suffering and we all have
[1:35:05] trials we are all tried and chastened as
[1:35:10] Sons not one but goes through that the
[1:35:14] church that is not suffering and is not
[1:35:16] being tried hasn't got it isn't of
[1:35:21] God and he quotes Hebrews while for whom
[1:35:24] the Lord loveth he
[1:35:26] chasteneth and scorches every son that
[1:35:28] and whom he receiveth but if he be
[1:35:31] without
[1:35:32] chastisement wherefore all are partakers
[1:35:35] then you are bastards and not
[1:35:39] Sons so we're not to think it's strange
[1:35:41] that we have trials trials is what opens
[1:35:44] the door for us to get
[1:35:46] character trials are not bad trials are
[1:35:50] saying this is God knocking on the door
[1:35:52] and saying I am here you have a chance
[1:35:55] to get more like me that's what a trial
[1:35:58] is and that's why we're to Rejoice count
[1:36:00] it all joy because we have now an
[1:36:03] opportunity to become like him because
[1:36:05] sitting in a chair at church and hearing
[1:36:08] the word of God does not bring
[1:36:12] character even if you get a
[1:36:15] revelation you still got to go out and
[1:36:17] be
[1:36:21] tried and th th Ty Church age brother B
[1:36:25] says in in fact patience is the outcome
[1:36:29] of
[1:36:31] faithfulness patience is the outcome of
[1:36:36] faithfulness I love
[1:36:38] that because we all want patience right
[1:36:42] but we don't want the trials I'll say it
[1:36:44] like this learn to be more
[1:36:46] faithful for it says in James 1:3 that
[1:36:49] the tri of your faith worketh
[1:36:51] patience there's absolutely no other way
[1:36:54] in which to gain patience it has to come
[1:36:57] by the trial of your faith amen
[1:36:59] tribulation Romans 5:3 tribulation
[1:37:01] worketh patience how highly God regards
[1:37:05] this outworking of our patience is seen
[1:37:09] in James 1:4 but let patience have her
[1:37:11] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[1:37:13] entire lacking nothing God's will for us
[1:37:16] is
[1:37:17] perfection and that Perfection is
[1:37:19] patience waiting on God and waiting on
[1:37:22] God and this is the process of character
[1:37:28] development how highly God
[1:37:31] commanded commanded these
[1:37:34] things the this is the process of God's
[1:37:38] character can I do a couple
[1:37:40] more but this is a go this is the gold
[1:37:43] of God 1 Peter 1:7 that the trial of
[1:37:46] your faith be much more precious than
[1:37:47] gold that perisheth the gold of God is a
[1:37:50] Christlike character produced in the
[1:37:53] fire furnace of Affliction that is the
[1:37:56] right kind of gold so we know in in in
[1:37:58] Revelations when he's talking to the Le
[1:38:00] oysan church and he says come buy of me
[1:38:02] gold he's really saying come buy of me
[1:38:05] the Christlike character that you need
[1:38:07] to go through your
[1:38:10] trial but what kind of gold does the
[1:38:13] church have today it has but the worldly
[1:38:16] gold that perisheth it's it is Rich it
[1:38:19] is
[1:38:19] complacent it is made an affluence the m
[1:38:23] Maj criteria of of of
[1:38:26] spirituality the evidence of God's
[1:38:28] blessing and the correctness of Doctrine
[1:38:31] is now based upon how rich folks are
[1:38:34] involved in it have you ever heard about
[1:38:36] politics in a
[1:38:37] church have you ever heard about a
[1:38:40] church um usually being run by the guy
[1:38:44] or the girl who has the most money come
[1:38:51] on that's what brother Bram is saying
[1:38:53] here here that's what he's saying here
[1:38:56] he says you better come before it's too
[1:38:58] late thus sayith the Lord and buy of me
[1:39:00] gold tried in the fire and then you will
[1:39:02] be truly Rich are we getting it listen
[1:39:05] to me
[1:39:06] naked we came into the world I said
[1:39:10] naked physically we came into the world
[1:39:12] but naked spiritually we will not leave
[1:39:15] it oh no we are going to take something
[1:39:18] with
[1:39:19] us what that something is all we can
[1:39:23] take with us nothing less and nothing
[1:39:24] more so we had better be real careful
[1:39:26] now to see what we're what what to see
[1:39:30] that we take something that will make us
[1:39:33] right before God so then what will we
[1:39:37] take with us we will take our character
[1:39:39] brother that is what we'll take with us
[1:39:42] now what kind of character will you take
[1:39:44] with you will it be like his who chose
[1:39:48] whose character was molded by suffering
[1:39:51] in the fiery furnace of Affliction or
[1:39:53] will be the softness of this character
[1:39:54] of leoan people he says it's up to each
[1:39:57] and every one of us for in that day
[1:39:59] every man will bear his own burden all
[1:40:03] right one more one
[1:40:05] more why does he stand by this the
[1:40:08] reason is Romans 81 1718 and if children
[1:40:12] then Heirs of God and Joint Heirs of
[1:40:15] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[1:40:18] that we may be glorified together for I
[1:40:21] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:40:22] present world are not worthy to be
[1:40:24] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:40:25] revealed in US unless we suffer with him
[1:40:27] we cannot reign with him you have to
[1:40:30] suffer to
[1:40:33] reain you might as would just sit here
[1:40:35] and say Lord I really want to be more
[1:40:38] like you I'm really willing to start
[1:40:40] doing more what you want me to do the
[1:40:43] reason for this is that character simply
[1:40:45] is never made without
[1:40:47] suffering character is a victory and not
[1:40:50] a gift a man without character can't
[1:40:53] Reign because power from character is
[1:40:56] satanic but Power with character is fit
[1:40:59] to rule and since he wants us to share
[1:41:01] his throne on the same basis that he
[1:41:03] overcame and sat down with his father on
[1:41:05] his father's Throne then we have to
[1:41:06] overcome to sit with
[1:41:07] him and the little suffering that we go
[1:41:10] through now is not worthy to be compared
[1:41:12] with the tremendous Glory that shall be
[1:41:13] revealed in us when he comes oh what a
[1:41:15] treasure is laid up for those who are
