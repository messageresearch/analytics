[21:28] save a wretch like
[21:33] me. I once was lost, but now I'm found.
[21:43] was blind, but now I
[21:49] see. It was grace that taught my heart
[21:56] to
[21:58] fear and grace my
[22:02] fears relieved.
[22:07] How
[22:09] preious did that
[22:13] grace appear.
[22:17] How I
[22:19] first
[22:22] believed when we been there
[22:29] 10,000
[22:31] years bright
[22:34] shineing as the sun.
[22:40] Leave no less days to sing God's
[22:47] praise than when we
[22:52] first
[22:55] beun.
[22:58] Amazing
[23:00] grace, how sweet the
[23:04] sound that saved a wretch like
[23:11] me. I once was lost, but now I'm found.
[23:21] was
[23:22] blind, but
[23:24] now I see.
[23:33] [Applause]
[23:46] I know in whom I believed. Amen. Amen.
[23:58] I know not why God's wondrous grace to
[24:04] me he hath made
[24:07] known, nor why unworthy Christ in love
[24:13] redeemed me for his own.
[24:18] But I know whom I have believed in and
[24:23] am
[24:24] persuaded that he is
[24:27] able to keep that which I've
[24:32] committed unto him against that day.
[24:38] I know not how this saving faith to me
[24:44] he did
[24:46] impart, nor how believing in his word
[24:52] brought peace within my heart.
[24:56] But I know whom I have believed in, and
[25:01] I'm
[25:02] persuaded that he is
[25:05] able to keep that which I've
[25:10] committed unto him against that day.
[25:15] I know not how the spirit moves,
[25:21] convincing men of
[25:24] sin,
[25:25] revealing Jesus through the word,
[25:30] creating faith in him.
[25:34] But I know whom I have believed in and
[25:39] am
[25:40] persuaded that he is
[25:42] able to keep that which I've
[25:47] committed unto him against that
[25:52] day. I know not what of good or ill may
[25:58] be reserved for me.
[26:02] of weary ways or golden days
[26:10] bey. But I know whom I have believed in
[26:16] and am
[26:17] persuaded that he is
[26:20] able to keep that which I've
[26:24] committed unto him against that day.
[26:30] I know not when my Lord may come at
[26:35] night or noon day
[26:38] fair, nor if I'll walk the veil with
[26:43] him, or meet him in the air.
[26:48] But I know whom I have believed in and
[26:53] am
[26:54] persuaded that he is
[26:57] able to keep that which I've
[27:01] committed unto him against that day.
[27:07] But I know whom I have believed in and
[27:11] am
[27:12] persuaded that he is
[27:15] able to keep that which I've
[27:20] committed unto him against that day.
[27:25] [Music]
[27:26] Amen. Amen. Let's all stand together.
[27:30] Amen. And ask brother Roger if he'll
[27:32] just pray over the offering.
[28:38] Amen. You may be seated. Amen.
[28:42] when I've gone the last mile of the way.
[28:43] Will you be glad for that, won't you?
[28:47] Amen. If I walk in the pathway of
[28:53] [Music]
[28:55] duty, if I work till the close of the
[29:03] day, I shall see the great king in his
[29:08] beauty.
[29:11] When I've gone the last mile of the
[29:17] way. When I've gone the last mile of the
[29:25] way. I will rest at the close of the
[29:32] day. And I know there are joys that
[29:37] await me.
[29:40] when I've gone the last mile of the
[29:45] [Music]
[29:47] way. If for Christ I proclaim the glad
[29:54] story. If I seek for his sheep gone
[30:01] arree, I am sure he will show me his
[30:06] glory.
[30:09] When I've gone the last mile of the
[30:15] way. When I've gone the last mile of the
[30:21] [Applause]
[30:23] way and will rest at the close of the
[30:30] day. And I know there are joys that
[30:35] await me.
[30:38] When I've gone the last mile of the
[30:43] [Applause]
[30:44] way. Here the dearest of ties we must
[30:51] sever. Tears of sorrow are seen every
[30:58] day. But no sickness, no sighing
[31:03] forever.
[31:07] When I've gone the last mile of the
[31:11] [Applause]
[31:13] way. When I've gone the last mile of the
[31:20] way. I will rest at the close of the
[31:27] day. And I know there are joys that
[31:32] await me.
[31:35] when I've gone the last mile of the
[31:41] way. And if here I have
[31:46] earnestly
[31:48] striven and have tried all his will to
[31:56] oy dwell in hands all the rapture of
[32:03] heaven when I've gone the last mile of
[32:07] the
[32:10] way. When I've gone the last mile of the
[32:17] way, I will rest at the close of the
[32:24] day. And I know there are joys that
[32:29] await
[32:31] me when I've gone the last mile of the
[32:38] way. Amen. Amen, brother John.
[32:45] How many's thankful that you're here
[32:46] today?
[32:48] You know, there are
[32:51] some that have
[32:53] left. They stop walking before the last
[32:57] mile of the
[32:59] way. And Satan has a
[33:03] temptation
[33:05] to to do that, right? The scripture
[33:09] tells us he delayeth his
[33:11] coming. But we are blessed here in our
[33:15] hearts to have a a desire to keep
[33:18] walking. To keep walking the last mile
[33:21] and the the last mile perhaps is the
[33:24] hardest.
[33:26] But we're on the correct path
[33:29] regardless of how we feel. Those of us
[33:31] that have come through a trial, which we
[33:33] all have, when we come through the
[33:34] trial, we're so glad that we didn't
[33:37] stop. Amen. We We got a blessing. We got
[33:40] a blessing coming. So, just keep keep on
[33:43] keeping on. That's why we're here today
[33:45] to get strength. Amen. From the Lord.
[33:47] And I believe our We're going to hear
[33:48] from God. We're going to be strengthened
[33:50] today through the word. That's right.
[33:52] And it's always a blessing having
[33:55] brother Alex with us and his family. God
[33:57] bless each of them. Let's stand together
[34:00] and sing. Only believe as our brother
[34:04] comes.
[34:08] Only
[34:11] believe.
[34:13] Only believe.
[34:19] [Music]
[34:30] Only
[34:32] believe all things are
[34:36] possible.
[34:38] Only Lord I believe. Lord I
[34:44] believe. Lord I
[34:48] believe. All things are
[34:52] possible. Lord, I
[34:56] believe. For I
[35:00] believe. Lord, I
[35:04] believe. All things are
[35:08] possible. Lord, I
[35:12] believe. Amen. We are so thankful for
[35:15] the grace of God in our lives to be
[35:18] believers today. Amen. We are saved not
[35:21] of ourselves but by faith through grace.
[35:24] Amen. It's not of ourselves. It's the
[35:27] gift of God. So we are just
[35:29] beneficiaries of his resurrection today.
[35:31] And it's good to be with fellow
[35:34] beneficiaries. Praise the Lord. Am I
[35:36] cutting out? Oh, there we go. Praise the
[35:38] Lord. Amen. If this goes out, I'm just
[35:40] going to yell really loud, which I kind
[35:43] of do anyway, I guess, but maybe even
[35:45] louder still. Um, God bless you. Good to
[35:48] be with you today. We certainly
[35:49] appreciate the grace of God, Bruce.
[35:52] Sure. Appreciate the song service. And
[35:55] uh do I need to switch here or
[35:56] something? I'm getting I'm getting looks
[35:58] get a home. I break things. So what?
[36:02] Hey, let's try this.
[36:05] Is this on? Okay. Oh, hey. Yeah. Is that
[36:09] autotune or something? Is that makes me
[36:11] sound really good. Praise the Lord.
[36:14] Sound like like a man. Um, it's really
[36:18] nice. Uh, no, we uh, you know, talking
[36:21] about the last mile away and stuff. You
[36:23] know, there's a there's a plan. The
[36:24] Bible talks about the book of Daniel
[36:26] that the the enemy, the beast, in this
[36:28] last hour, he has a plan to wear out the
[36:31] saints of the most high. And so, we're
[36:33] all dealing with weariness. Even in the
[36:35] natural people in America, they're more
[36:37] worked than they've been in generations.
[36:39] And and we all experience weariness. And
[36:42] for me, I also am tired this morning.
[36:44] you know, you you get to look at things
[36:46] in life. Um, I'm trying to think how to
[36:50] to to to lead into this. You can be
[36:52] seated for just a moment as I ramble.
[36:55] Um, you know, I I just like to say this.
[36:58] Let me start off by saying this. I
[36:59] appreciate the grace of God to be here.
[37:01] Obviously, I wouldn't be here if it
[37:03] wasn't for the Lord, but I also
[37:04] appreciate my wife and kids. They help
[37:06] make this possible. I probably uh it's
[37:09] probably fair to say I couldn't do what
[37:10] I do without them. Uh, I was at home
[37:13] this week and you know how it is. You
[37:15] have plans to do things as a minister.
[37:17] Brother John, you you have a a business.
[37:19] You understand especially you've got
[37:20] plans. You've got this time that you set
[37:23] aside for things and then things happen.
[37:25] Well, I had a thing happened to me this
[37:27] week. I I was trying to fix the drain
[37:32] for the washer in my house and it runs
[37:35] down this
[37:36] hole and the CPVC that's the hot and
[37:39] cold line for the shower are in the same
[37:42] wall. And so, unbeknownst to me, that
[37:44] wasn't very strong in the hot water
[37:46] line. And I'm just pushing the drain
[37:48] hose down there. And I have a wellspring
[37:51] of water gushing up not into everlasting
[37:54] life, but into my own frustration and
[37:57] into the crawl space under my house. So,
[37:59] we had the water off for a day, and I
[38:01] just had all kinds of stuff. I had to
[38:02] take Chuck to doctor's appointment. So,
[38:03] you things happen and you get weary. And
[38:06] so, you know, I this like this morning I
[38:09] heard this prayer request for this young
[38:11] man that passed away. You know,
[38:13] sometimes we get weary and we think
[38:14] about how hard life is, but you know,
[38:17] there's somebody else going through
[38:18] stuff and you know, I just as a
[38:21] minister, I never want to get up here
[38:23] and none of us do and and be so uh
[38:26] caught up in ourselves that forget
[38:28] there's people that are really
[38:28] suffering. So, you know, I just I thank
[38:31] God for his grace and his mercy that we
[38:32] could each be here today. Amen. And so I
[38:35] was, you know, I say this to make this
[38:37] point. So, you know, I was thinking, you
[38:40] know, back in the day, they didn't have
[38:41] indoor plumbing. So, that was one
[38:42] problem they didn't have. They had wells
[38:45] that they drew water out of. And so, my
[38:46] kids, actually, my girls yesterday were
[38:47] talking to me about this certain
[38:49] thought. And so, I'd like to take my my
[38:51] thought here so they they can take the
[38:53] blame or credit however they want to to
[38:55] view that for this. But, I sure
[38:57] appreciate that because I was looking at
[38:58] this anyway for today's thought. So um
[39:02] if you just stand with me again for a
[39:03] moment for a word of prayer and uh I
[39:06] make all this point to say all this that
[39:08] uh you know we have a lot to be thankful
[39:10] for and we'll read this here in just a
[39:12] moment but I would like to invite you to
[39:13] pray with me first and let's just pray.
[39:15] Father we are so thankful Lord though
[39:18] many of us no doubt today we're weary in
[39:20] body and Lord we've maybe been through
[39:22] things throughout the week but there's a
[39:25] place that we can draw strength from.
[39:27] When Abraham was wearied in his body and
[39:29] his age was setting in, but he staggered
[39:32] not at the promise, but he was strong in
[39:35] faith. Lord, your prophet talks about
[39:37] how he came up to the breast of one else
[39:39] shady eye and he drew strength from you.
[39:41] Lord, we just pray today that we would
[39:43] be able to draw a supernatural strength
[39:45] for everyone here. Whatever the need is,
[39:47] whatever we're going through, Lord,
[39:49] you've given us your word. You've given
[39:51] us your spirit, Lord. and you've also
[39:53] given us our church and our family and
[39:55] our friends that are assembled here
[39:56] today, Lord, that we are the hands and
[39:59] the feet and the mouth of Jesus Christ
[40:01] to one another. May you just help us
[40:03] each one to strengthen the other. You
[40:05] have testified that every joint supplies
[40:08] unto the nourishing of the body. So I
[40:10] pray that now as we come to the reading
[40:12] of the word, may you just take me, Lord,
[40:14] and use me for my part in this today.
[40:17] Lord, we are nothing without you, but
[40:19] with you we can do all things. So we
[40:21] just commit this time into your hands.
[40:22] Bless the reading of your word, the
[40:24] ministering thereof, and may all the
[40:26] things that are said and done before
[40:28] your praise and glory and honor. Lord,
[40:30] we have made many plans in our lives of
[40:33] what we would do and what we think
[40:35] should be done. But Lord, you direct a
[40:37] man's path. Lord, you place a design in
[40:39] his heart and we're just trusting you
[40:41] now in this in all things that we do.
[40:43] Lord, we thank you in Jesus Christ's
[40:45] name. Amen. If you have your Bibles this
[40:47] morning, we're looking at that book of
[40:48] Isaiah the 12th chapter.
[40:50] We're talking about wells of salvation.
[40:53] Of course, they had to go pull water up
[40:55] out of the well back in the day with a
[40:56] bucket or something like that. And I
[40:58] like this scripture here for my thought
[41:01] today because uh well, we'll just read
[41:02] the whole chapter. Hey, praise the Lord.
[41:05] Get a chapter in today if you haven't
[41:07] this week yet, which you should. Well,
[41:09] it's the beginning of the week. Hey, we
[41:10] can't fault you too much yet. Amen.
[41:12] Isaiah chapter 12 here says, "And in
[41:15] that day thou shalt say, Oh Lord, I will
[41:17] praise thee. Though thouast anger with
[41:19] me, thine anger is turned away, and thou
[41:22] comfortest me. Behold, God is my
[41:24] salvation, I will trust and not be
[41:28] afraid. For the Lord Jehovah is my
[41:30] strength and my song. He also is become
[41:33] my salvation. Notice this. Therefore,
[41:36] with joy, praise the Lord, with joy
[41:39] shall ye draw water out of the wells of
[41:44] salvation. Got one amen there. Praise
[41:46] the Lord. How many's come to draw with
[41:48] joy today from the wells of salvation?
[41:51] There we go. Praise the Lord. Hey,
[41:52] you'll all wake up. One of we'll all get
[41:54] there at some point today. Amen. I'm I'm
[41:57] waiting too. And in that day shall you
[42:00] say, "Praise the Lord." Call upon his
[42:02] name. Declare his doings among the
[42:04] people. Make mention that his name is is
[42:07] exalted. Sing unto the Lord, for he hath
[42:10] done excellent things. This is known in
[42:14] all the earth. How many here could
[42:15] declare he's done excellent things?
[42:17] Praise the Lord. Cry out and shout,
[42:19] "Thou inhabitant of Zion, for great is
[42:22] the Holy One of Israel in the midst of
[42:24] thee." Amen. May the Lord bless the
[42:26] reading of his word. You may be
[42:29] seated. I'll just for a backdrop here,
[42:32] uh I don't remember when it was probably
[42:35] some time ago. I preached a sermon here.
[42:37] I'm not preaching again today, but I
[42:39] preached a sermon here a while back
[42:40] about remove not the ancient landmark.
[42:42] And so we have different people that
[42:43] come and go. Does anybody remember me
[42:45] minister? Oh, praise the Lord. Hey,
[42:47] maybe I should preach it again. Maybe
[42:49] not everybody remembers it, but just
[42:51] slide that right in there. No, but the
[42:53] the premise of it is in Deuteronomy 19,
[42:56] the scripture talks about when they
[42:57] would come when the children of Israel,
[42:58] they're coming through the Exodus,
[43:00] they're coming back into the promised
[43:01] land. They're coming to this land and
[43:03] they're given a commandment there in in
[43:05] Deuteronomy the 19th chapter not to
[43:08] remove their neighbors landmark or the
[43:09] ancient landmark which their fathers
[43:11] have set. So the premise there when I
[43:13] preached on it is uh in the in the law
[43:16] there was a curse if you removed your
[43:17] neighbor's landmark because that was a
[43:19] promise to their family for that land
[43:22] and to their family after them and to
[43:24] their family after them. And that was
[43:25] the purpose of the landmark. And we in
[43:27] like manner we have scriptural promises
[43:29] exceeding great and precious promises.
[43:32] And we are commanded not to add to or to
[43:35] take away from this word because that's
[43:37] for us. It's for all that believe. It's
[43:38] for you, for your children, for those
[43:40] that are far off. Amen. So, that's the
[43:42] premise of kind of what we talked about
[43:44] there and uh the idea of the landmark.
[43:46] You're not to remove it. It's it's for a
[43:48] person. Amen. So, uh God has given us
[43:51] these promises and that's how we partake
[43:54] of our spiritual inheritance. Amen. So,
[43:57] this is why it's so important for God to
[43:58] send us a vindicated prophet. This is
[44:00] why it's so important for us to have a
[44:02] message. Amen. It was to restore things
[44:05] that were lost. Amen. So that that that
[44:07] that that implies or it doesn't just
[44:09] imply, but it implies that there was
[44:11] something that belonged to you,
[44:13] something that was for you and it was
[44:15] gone. And we know what it was. It was
[44:16] the traditions of men and dark
[44:18] denominations and and men's
[44:20] interpretations that veiled the word to
[44:23] the people. But we've had a a
[44:24] resurrection in this day. Amen. Like
[44:27] they had back there or the third day
[44:28] when Christ rose up. We've had a
[44:30] resurrection. Brother Bram said, it's
[44:31] the rising of the sun out of dark
[44:33] denominationalism and it's restored the
[44:35] word. has restored the hearts. Amen. Not
[44:38] just the word, but the hearts of the
[44:39] children to the faith of the apostolic
[44:42] fathers. Amen. So, we're we're a
[44:44] restored people today. Amen. You and I
[44:46] don't have to try to figure out as as uh
[44:49] you know, I showed the kids the other
[44:50] day. We're talking about geography and
[44:51] you can get you can get Google Earth now
[44:53] satellite images and and you can you've
[44:55] got so many tools today to digitally to
[44:59] look at what belongs or what a land mass
[45:01] is, where there's markers. But you and I
[45:03] today, we don't have to guess at the
[45:05] word of God. Amen. We don't need a
[45:07] certain pastor. We don't need a certain
[45:09] evangelist to get up. Well, I think it
[45:10] means this or I think it means that.
[45:12] We've had a prophet come and he's
[45:15] restored the word. He's showed the
[45:16] landmarks. It's all laid out before us
[45:18] today. So, there's the guesswork is
[45:20] gone. Amen. If you want to know what
[45:23] belongs to you, you can look in the
[45:24] Bible. You can look at the message. You
[45:26] can hear a prophet's words. And you know
[45:28] what belongs to you and I today. Amen.
[45:30] So when the enemy would come and say
[45:32] this doesn't belong to you or that
[45:34] doesn't mean what you think it means or
[45:36] that doesn't mean what it said it means
[45:38] something different today. You and I
[45:40] have an authority by a vindicated word
[45:43] by the prophet. Amen. We have we have an
[45:45] authority as the sons and daughters of
[45:47] God to say no this is what belongs to
[45:49] me. Amen. God said it. I believe it and
[45:52] that settles it. Praise the Lord. So,
[45:55] we're resting on this fact today that we
[45:58] are not just believing a different
[45:59] gospel, but it's actually what Paul
[46:01] preached. Amen. That's what we're
[46:02] resting on. We know that it's what the
[46:04] prophet Paul preached. It's the same
[46:06] thing that Brother Brandon preached and
[46:08] it's ours today. Amen. So, the the the
[46:10] entire premise is the immutability of
[46:13] God's counsel. Amen. It's the
[46:16] immutability of God's word. God doesn't
[46:18] change his mind about his word. Amen.
[46:21] And let me say this. If God doesn't
[46:22] change his mind, then you and I aren't
[46:24] going to change his mind by praying
[46:26] enough or fasting enough or trying to
[46:29] intellectually reason. Amen. Our desire
[46:31] as Christians. Praise the Lord. Our
[46:34] desire is not just to come get something
[46:36] from God to bend him to our will because
[46:39] that's what denomination does. That's
[46:41] what religion does. Amen. But we come to
[46:43] be shaped. We come that we might be
[46:45] transformed by the renewing of the mind
[46:48] that we might line up with this word.
[46:49] Amen. Praise the Lord. I I love how
[46:52] Brother Bram says it. He says, "I don't
[46:53] care if my trousers match my jacket or
[46:55] my shoes and my belt match, but I want
[46:57] my experience to match the word of God."
[47:00] Amen. Listen, if your experience doesn't
[47:02] match the word of God, all that other
[47:04] stuff doesn't matter. Now, I'm not
[47:06] saying, I'm not endorsing you coming
[47:07] here wearing your Hawaiian t-shirt and
[47:10] trying to look like a hippie or that's
[47:11] not what I'm getting at. Amen. But it's
[47:13] about prioritizing. Amen. First things
[47:15] first. The word must always come first.
[47:18] Amen. So, I say all this to make this
[47:20] point. We're looking at this scripture
[47:21] this morning and uh I I got my my girls
[47:24] are actually talking about this a little
[47:25] bit yesterday. You know, I got to
[47:26] looking at this a while back because I
[47:28] preached on it before in Deuteronomy the
[47:30] 19th chapter about not taking away the
[47:32] the landmark. And the scripture says
[47:33] there specifically remove not the
[47:35] ancient landmark that your fathers have
[47:38] set in the land. So he they're given
[47:39] this injunction or this commandment
[47:42] under the law not to remove landmarks
[47:44] when they come into the land. Amen.
[47:46] Which it's talking about landmarks
[47:48] they're going to place. It's also making
[47:50] the point that there's landmarks already
[47:52] there. Amen. There's already something
[47:54] there. And so I got to thinking about
[47:55] this. I'm like, well, I I you know, it's
[47:58] one of those things, you know, but you
[48:00] you know what I mean? You just you
[48:01] haven't sat down really considered it.
[48:03] So I got to thinking about that these
[48:05] Hebrew people, they've been in out of
[48:07] the land of Canaan for 400 years. Amen.
[48:09] Their their forefathers had been there.
[48:11] Amen. Who had been there? Abraham and
[48:14] Isaac and Jacob and Jacob's children.
[48:17] They'd all not here today to promote a
[48:19] new gospel. Amen. We're but we're it's a
[48:21] restored word. Amen. When we when we say
[48:24] we believe that the sick are healed. We
[48:26] believe the dead are raised. Amen. It's
[48:28] not like this is a new thing. Amen. They
[48:31] come to brother Brandon one day you be
[48:32] you part of that new religion. They get
[48:33] up and shout and they they carry on. No,
[48:35] that's the oldest kind we've got. Amen.
[48:38] This is not a new thing. This is not our
[48:39] invention. But God has been doing this
[48:42] for a long time. Listen, God I've said
[48:43] this before. God's an expert on healing
[48:46] the sick. He's been doing it for a long
[48:48] time. God's an expert on binding up the
[48:50] brokenhearted. He's been doing it a long
[48:52] time. Amen. Listen, God is in the
[48:56] business of doing impossible things.
[48:58] Amen. Can I say it this way? He does it
[49:00] on the daily. Amen. It's it's just part
[49:03] and parcel what he does. Praise the
[49:04] Lord. Amen. So these people, they've
[49:06] come into this land. Their their fathers
[49:09] have been here before. Amen. Right? So,
[49:12] they come in from Egypt and they they
[49:14] they come to this land. And so, you go
[49:16] back and I I begin to do this. You go
[49:18] back into the Genesis, the book of uh
[49:20] the 12th chapter in the book of Genesis
[49:22] when God first calls Abram to go to
[49:25] Canaan. He says, "I want you to go to
[49:26] Canaan and there I'm going to bless
[49:28] you." And the scripture says he took all
[49:30] of his substance that he'd gathered and
[49:32] he travels there. And now, the Bible is
[49:34] not specific. I don't know what the
[49:36] different histories say or whatever. The
[49:37] Bible's not specific about how much
[49:39] Abram has. When he leaves the land of uh
[49:42] cha the Chaldans or the Chaldanss and he
[49:44] goes to Canaan, but he takes all of his
[49:46] substance. He takes all of his stuff and
[49:48] he probably wasn't poor because he had
[49:50] servants. But whatever he had, he gets
[49:52] to Canaan. In one chapter later, we
[49:54] begin to read there in Genesis the 13th
[49:57] chapter, the second verse says that he
[49:59] was very rich and his substance was very
[50:02] great. Amen. So when Abraham goes into
[50:05] the promised land, God gives him land
[50:07] and he he begins to cultivate the land.
[50:10] And the Bible says this in Genesis the
[50:11] 21st chapter. It came to pass at the
[50:14] time that AMC and Pico, the chief
[50:16] captain of the host, they spake unto
[50:18] Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all
[50:20] that thou do doest. Amen. He says, "Now
[50:23] therefore swear unto me here by God,
[50:25] that thou will not deal falsely with me,
[50:27] nor with my son, nor with my son's son,
[50:29] but according to the kindness that I
[50:31] have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto
[50:33] me and to the land wherein thou hast
[50:35] sojourned." So, in other words, Aim has
[50:37] seen Abraham. And of course, we we know
[50:39] that uh a couple different times he's
[50:41] had dealings with Abraham and and his
[50:42] his wife. Amen. He goes to take his
[50:44] wife. How many knows the story there
[50:46] where where the king of bilik he wants
[50:48] to take Sarah as his wife and Abraham's
[50:50] like well listen she's he's he's fearful
[50:52] for his life and he says well listen uh
[50:54] you she's just my sister just just take
[50:56] her it's fine or whatever and God comes
[50:58] to Aim in the night and says now listen
[51:00] you're a dead man
[51:03] what are you talking about well that
[51:04] woman that you took that's a man's wife
[51:07] that's a prophet's wife I didn't know he
[51:10] said and God's like I know you didn't
[51:11] know in the innocency of your heart you
[51:13] did this is why I didn't kill you yet'
[51:14] Right. Amen. That's why I haven't killed
[51:17] you yet. He says, "But listen, you
[51:19] restore that man, his wife, and you have
[51:23] that man pray for you." Amen. And if
[51:26] you'll do that, I'll I'll spare your
[51:28] household. Because God shut up all the
[51:30] wombs of the Egyptians. Amen. Or the
[51:32] Yeah. the Egyptians. So God spares him.
[51:34] And Bill comes and he sees that God has
[51:36] blessed him wherever he goes. God's
[51:38] blessed him in whatever he does. So he
[51:40] says, "I want you to make a deal with me
[51:41] now. I want you to make this covenant
[51:43] with me that you're not going to deal
[51:44] falsely. So verse 24, Abraham said, I
[51:47] will swear. Verse 25, and Abraham
[51:49] reproved Aimc because of a well of
[51:51] water. Praise the Lord. Which Aim's
[51:54] servant had violently taken away? And
[51:55] Aim said, I want not who hath done this
[51:58] thing. So So let me let me unpack this
[52:00] for a second. Abraham's like, "Listen,
[52:02] uh, I'll I'll swear this thing, but
[52:03] listen, you you guys have taken one of
[52:06] my wells of water." Amen. I I'm the
[52:08] injured party here. this is why I'm
[52:10] concerned about you. You not not only
[52:12] were you after my wife, you've taken one
[52:13] of my wells of water. And and so Aim's
[52:16] like, "Well, I didn't know." That seems
[52:18] like a his his go-to excuse, I guess.
[52:20] Amen. But he says, "I want not who hath
[52:23] done this thing. Neither did thou tell
[52:25] me, neither yet heard I of it, but
[52:26] today." So notice this verse 27. Abraham
[52:29] took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto
[52:32] Aim, and both of them made a covenant.
[52:34] And Abraham sent seven u lambs of the
[52:36] flock by themselves. And Amcch said unto
[52:39] Abraham, "What mean these seven you
[52:41] lambs which thou hast set by
[52:43] themselves?" And he said, "For these
[52:44] seven you lambs thou shalt take of my
[52:46] hand that they may be a witness unto me
[52:49] that I have digged this well." Amen. So
[52:53] in other words, I dug this well and
[52:55] there's a dispute. Who who does this
[52:58] belong to? So I'm gonna even though I
[53:00] dug it, I'm gonna pay you this. It's
[53:02] kind of like getting a copyright. Amen.
[53:04] I'm gonna buy the rights to this. I want
[53:06] you to acknowledge that this is my well.
[53:09] So, I'm going to pay you and you're
[53:11] going to take these lambs. Not giving
[53:12] them much of a choice. You're going to
[53:14] take these and they're going to serve as
[53:16] a witness that I dug this well and it
[53:19] belongs to me. Amen. Amen. So, he does
[53:22] this and he says, "Wherefore the place
[53:24] is called Beersa or the oath of the
[53:26] seven or the oath of the sevenfold
[53:28] because there they both swear there they
[53:31] swear both of them. Thus they made a
[53:34] covenant at Beerseba." Then Aim rose up
[53:36] and Pico the chief captured the host and
[53:38] they returned into the land of the
[53:40] Philistines. Verse 33 at the end of the
[53:42] chapter and Abraham planted a grove in
[53:44] Beersa and called there on the name of
[53:47] the Lord the everlasting God. So what's
[53:50] interesting, I'm studying this and I'm
[53:51] reading this and I've got um I've got
[53:53] the Bible like on my like a digital one
[53:56] and there's a little footnote there in
[53:57] my Bible. I don't know if anybody else
[53:58] has it in theirs, but in my Bible
[54:00] there's a footnote there for the word
[54:01] grove. And the word in the Hebrew is not
[54:04] just a normal grove. Amen. But it's a
[54:06] certain kind of a tree. Amen. It's a
[54:08] tamaris tree. Anybody ever heard of the
[54:09] the tamaris tree before? Praise the
[54:12] Lord. Good. I can do my my biology
[54:14] lesson for the week. Amen. So, this
[54:17] tamaris tree, it's uh it's an
[54:20] interesting tree. There's a lot we could
[54:21] talk about here, but what there's
[54:23] several significant things. It's uh it's
[54:26] kind of a nuisance. Amen. Like
[54:29] Abraham. Amen. like us. Amen. Because
[54:33] you take this tamaris tree and when you
[54:35] put it with other trees, it competes
[54:37] with them. Amen. It'll choke out the
[54:40] life of other trees. So if you put a
[54:41] tamaris tree next to other kinds of
[54:43] trees, because of its root system,
[54:45] because it's aggressive, it will go down
[54:47] really deep and it won't allow other
[54:50] things to coexist with it. Amen. It's
[54:52] kind of like what God's doing with
[54:53] Abraham. It's kind of like what God's
[54:55] doing with God's people. He's going to
[54:56] put them in this land and they're going
[54:58] to possess the land. Amen. God doesn't
[55:00] just I knocked that off. Thank you so
[55:02] much. God doesn't just put them in the
[55:03] land for them to live there, but God
[55:05] puts them there to drive everything else
[55:07] out. Amen. So, he plants Abraham. He
[55:10] plants Abraham's seed in this land to to
[55:14] drive other things out. And so, what's
[55:16] significant about this tree, like I
[55:18] said, what makes it work so well is its
[55:19] roots. Amen. Because most trees, the
[55:21] roots, they go down maybe 10, 20 feet.
[55:23] They spread out. But this tamaris tree,
[55:25] it it it it it goes down some it can go
[55:29] down maybe a 100 feet sometimes. Amen.
[55:31] It goes down way further. Its roots go
[55:33] down deeper. Now, it's a fast growing
[55:35] tree, but depending on where the water
[55:38] table is and the water sources, it might
[55:41] not seem to grow fast. Praise the Lord.
[55:43] Amen. Hope you're all following me here.
[55:45] Amen. Sometimes the growth doesn't seem
[55:48] real significant to you and I because
[55:51] it's all underground where you can't see
[55:53] it. Amen. Sometimes in your own life,
[55:55] sometimes you look at a Christian in
[55:56] church, you say, "Well, bless God, I'm
[55:58] this and I'm that and I'm more spiritual
[56:00] than the next person." And they look at
[56:02] somebody's life and say, "Well, it
[56:03] doesn't look like they're growing very
[56:05] much." Well, they're growing. You just
[56:06] can't always see it. Amen. Because
[56:08] sometimes the real work's taking place
[56:10] underground where you can't see it. And
[56:12] sometimes this tree will grow inches in
[56:14] a year's time, but it's growing down.
[56:17] Amen. Because the way up with God is
[56:19] down. Amen. It's humility. This tree is
[56:21] not looking just to to be like the other
[56:23] trees, but it's going all the way down.
[56:26] Amen. Because listen, Abraham, he had
[56:28] dug a well there. Amen. This well was
[56:30] not just a it wasn't like he just found
[56:32] a puddle somewhere, but this well is
[56:34] somewhere down in the water table. Amen.
[56:37] Where he's digging at, there's water
[56:39] there that's going to be there for a
[56:41] long time. Amen. Amen. He's digging this
[56:44] well and he's not digging this well for
[56:46] himself. That's why he's making an oath.
[56:49] That's why he's making this covenant.
[56:51] This well is for my children. It's for
[56:53] my children's children. When they come
[56:55] back 400 years from now, when they come
[56:57] back 400 years into this land, that
[57:00] well's going to be there. It's still
[57:02] going to have water. It's not going to
[57:04] run out.
[57:06] And so these trees he's planting here,
[57:08] he knows that that water's not going to
[57:09] run out. So he plants a grove there and
[57:11] he plants it and says, "You know what? I
[57:13] know that it's going to be here when
[57:15] they come back because the water's not
[57:17] going to run out." Now listen, other
[57:19] people had lived in that region. And
[57:20] what's interesting about this tamaris
[57:22] tree in this region, this is an
[57:23] inhospitable region. Amen. It's not a
[57:26] good place to grow stuff. It's not a
[57:29] good place to live. Amen. For other
[57:32] people.
[57:34] But for Abraham, it's a good place.
[57:36] Amen. God puts this man Abraham right
[57:39] there in this place, this desert place,
[57:41] and he finds water where no one else
[57:44] finds water. And then they say, "Well,
[57:45] we want the water." Well, they didn't
[57:47] want it till the that Abraham found the
[57:49] water there. Amen. It's just like Lot.
[57:51] Lot and Abraham, they're in the promised
[57:53] land. And listen, Abraham lets Lot
[57:55] choose. He says, "Listen, you choose the
[57:58] the the place you want." And Lot looked
[58:00] towards Sodom. He looked towards sin. He
[58:04] looked towards debauchery. He looked
[58:06] towards Sodom and Gomorrah because it
[58:07] was well watered. It looked like a good
[58:09] place to live. Amen. We look at Satan's
[58:12] Eden and it looks like a good place to
[58:14] live in, but it's really just a good
[58:15] place to sit in. Amen. We've got more
[58:18] technology. We've got more hospitals.
[58:20] We've got more health care. We've got
[58:22] all kinds of things. But what does man
[58:24] look like today? His character is not
[58:26] any better. He's not any closer to God.
[58:29] He's further away of anything. Amen. And
[58:32] yet, here's Abraham. We're going to put
[58:34] Abraham in a place that no one else even
[58:36] wants to live there. But he's going to
[58:38] go to the most inhospitable places. He's
[58:40] going to be in the worst conditions.
[58:42] He's going to be in the most desert
[58:44] places. And there, God is going to cause
[58:46] him to flourish because God showed
[58:48] Abraham something that nobody else saw.
[58:50] There's water down there. There's life
[58:52] down there. And if you'll dig deep, if
[58:54] you'll grow down to this place, there's
[58:56] a source. It's beyond what other things
[58:58] are tapping into.
[59:01] What makes you different than the rest
[59:02] of the world? It's not that you were
[59:04] smarter. It's not your generics, but
[59:06] you're tapped into something. Amen.
[59:09] You're the v. He's the vine and you're
[59:11] the branches. You're drawing from his
[59:13] life. Amen. You're drawing from El
[59:15] Shadi. There's a strength. There's a
[59:17] power down there. There's water down
[59:19] there. Amen. Abraham had confidence when
[59:22] his children come back that that same
[59:24] God that showed him the water down
[59:26] there. The same water would be there for
[59:28] them.
[59:30] Praise the Lord.
[59:32] So we see this, we see this today. We
[59:35] see this in Israel. We see it in
[59:36] Palestine. how the people would go in
[59:38] there and through agriculture and
[59:40] irrigation and all these things, they
[59:41] would take a place that almost nobody
[59:43] wanted to live in. And now everybody
[59:45] wants it. Everybody wants to live there.
[59:47] They want to take it. And well, praise
[59:49] the Lord. Probably what would happen
[59:51] this now I'm going to rant here for a
[59:53] second. Probably what would happen if
[59:55] other people went in there, it wouldn't
[59:57] be that nice in 10 years. It wouldn't be
[59:59] that nice in 20 years. They didn't build
[1:00:01] it. They don't care about it. They're
[1:00:02] not going to take care of it. They're
[1:00:03] going to run it down. Amen. They're not
[1:00:06] the ones that that that have the the the
[1:00:08] that established it. Amen. So, it
[1:00:10] doesn't have the same significance to
[1:00:12] them. To them, it's just a resource for
[1:00:14] them to take and draw it dry. Amen. But
[1:00:17] for these people that build it, they're
[1:00:18] they're ordained to be there.
[1:00:22] Listen, if you work a job, you're in a
[1:00:23] certain church, whatever it is as a
[1:00:25] Christian, a certain family, we don't
[1:00:27] want to just be there draining people.
[1:00:29] We We're not the horse leech that's
[1:00:32] crying give. Well, praise the Lord. Here
[1:00:34] we go. Here we go. Listen, we're here
[1:00:37] for a purpose. And it's not just to take
[1:00:40] something all the time. We ought to have
[1:00:43] something to give out. Amen. We were
[1:00:45] promised if we would believe this word,
[1:00:48] if you would trust this Jesus Christ,
[1:00:50] you would have a wellspring inside of
[1:00:52] you, rising up into everlasting. There's
[1:00:55] power in the believer that was promised.
[1:00:57] Amen. And that power was promised for
[1:00:59] you to do something with it. Amen. Now,
[1:01:02] you're not just here to be a drain on
[1:01:04] the economy or breathe the air that we
[1:01:06] all got to share, but you've got
[1:01:08] something to contribute. Amen. Well,
[1:01:11] praise the Lord. Is that all right?
[1:01:12] Amen. Listen, it's not just the pastor.
[1:01:15] Each one of us has something to give.
[1:01:16] You say, "Well, I can't sing and I can't
[1:01:19] preach." Well, you can pray. You can
[1:01:21] thank somebody when they do something
[1:01:22] nice. You can be a witness to somebody.
[1:01:25] You can encourage somebody when they're
[1:01:26] down. Listen, there's gifts. You can
[1:01:28] pray for somebody when they're sick.
[1:01:30] Well, I hope the pastor prays for them.
[1:01:31] You pray for him.
[1:01:34] See, we're all make Well, here we here
[1:01:38] we are.
[1:01:40] Yeah. We want It's like our children. We
[1:01:42] want the pastor to teach them right. We
[1:01:44] want the Sunday school teacher, right?
[1:01:45] Want the school teachers school to teach
[1:01:47] them right. Whenever want the television
[1:01:49] to teach them, right? Want everybody to
[1:01:51] do our job for us. Well, I wish somebody
[1:01:54] would cultivate this. Listen, if God
[1:01:56] gave you that land, that's your job.
[1:02:00] You've got something to do. Amen. Quit
[1:02:03] waiting for somebody. Well, I wish
[1:02:05] Abraham would come along and get me a
[1:02:07] blessing. Go find your own blessing.
[1:02:10] Listen, it's there if you'll dig and
[1:02:12] find it. Abra, listen. Abraham's not
[1:02:14] poking holes in the ground, hoping to
[1:02:17] find something. He is led. He is
[1:02:20] ordained to this spot. I know God put me
[1:02:23] here, so there must be something here
[1:02:26] for me. And if God puts you somewhere,
[1:02:29] there's something there for you. You
[1:02:30] don't have to guess. You're not
[1:02:32] wondering. You've been ordained. You've
[1:02:34] been led to it.
[1:02:37] Hallelujah. Well, if you're led by God,
[1:02:41] Amen. Oh, I hope there's a blessing.
[1:02:44] Abraham's not hoping. He knows. Listen,
[1:02:47] he didn't bring himself to the promised
[1:02:49] land in the first place. He's 70 years.
[1:02:51] Listen, praise the Lord. I just turned
[1:02:53] 42 and I don't want to go nowhere. Amen.
[1:02:56] Praise. You know how it is. You get a
[1:02:59] little bit older. Well, you want to go
[1:03:00] do this? Nah, I'm good. I'm going to
[1:03:02] stay home. I'm going to And then, you
[1:03:05] know, whatever. But you know how it is.
[1:03:06] You just It's It's It's like in the
[1:03:08] Bible when David, he goes and he flees
[1:03:11] from Abselam and Joab defeats Abselam
[1:03:13] and he's coming back to the house of
[1:03:14] Barceli. They helped David. And so David
[1:03:17] goes up to Barzelius and he says, "Hey,
[1:03:20] you helped me out. You helped my house
[1:03:21] out in a time of trouble. Would you
[1:03:23] cross over Jordan with me? would you
[1:03:25] come back to Jerusalem? And Barzelia is
[1:03:27] like, "Why would you do this to me?"
[1:03:29] That's quite a thing to tell the king.
[1:03:31] He's like, "Listen, I'm 80 years old
[1:03:33] today. My food don't taste like it used
[1:03:35] to. My eyes don't work like it used to.
[1:03:37] I can't even tell good from evil. And
[1:03:39] you're going to make me go to the the
[1:03:40] the the capital. I don't want it. That's
[1:03:43] this is this how an old man is. I don't
[1:03:45] really want to go to have my son go
[1:03:47] instead." All right. David's like,
[1:03:48] "That's fine.
[1:03:50] Listen, I'm saying this for a reason.
[1:03:52] Abraham's not out here for fun. He knew
[1:03:56] he was led by God. And that's why he's
[1:04:00] digging. He's planting this grow.
[1:04:01] Listen, when he plants this grove, he's
[1:04:03] not just saying, "Well, it'll be nice to
[1:04:05] have a garden next year cuz likely he's
[1:04:08] not going to see it in its full
[1:04:10] strength." But he does it because he's
[1:04:12] believing in a promise. Amen. Listen,
[1:04:14] there's been praying moms in the church,
[1:04:16] praying moms in the message. They'll
[1:04:18] pray for their kids. And that mama might
[1:04:20] go by way of the grave. But she draws
[1:04:22] her last breath. She's trusting that God
[1:04:25] has heard her prayer, that God's going
[1:04:27] to answer. She might not be here to see
[1:04:29] it, but she's trusting one day on the
[1:04:32] other side there's going to be a reward
[1:04:34] because she held fast to her profession.
[1:04:39] Hallelujah. We get all shook up. Well,
[1:04:41] I'm praying. I didn't see nothing.
[1:04:42] Listen, you might not even be here, but
[1:04:44] if you believe God and you've oriented
[1:04:47] your life like Abraham around the
[1:04:49] promise of God, God will bring his word
[1:04:51] to pass. Now, it might not look like
[1:04:54] there's growth sometimes. You're praying
[1:04:57] for people don't like nothing's
[1:04:58] happening. God's just driving the roots
[1:05:00] down a little bit deeper. Amen. That's
[1:05:01] why God sends trials. That's why he
[1:05:03] sends problems. Amen. You be praying for
[1:05:06] somebody and it seems like they're going
[1:05:07] through the worst trial of their life.
[1:05:08] Why are they going through this all of a
[1:05:10] sudden? Cuz God knows how to get the
[1:05:12] root down where it needs to go.
[1:05:15] Amen. God knows how to shake a person.
[1:05:17] Amen. He knows when you're not close
[1:05:19] enough. So he'll send things. Yeah. You
[1:05:21] would think that's going to destroy that
[1:05:24] person. No, they might bend. Amen. They
[1:05:29] might
[1:05:30] shake. Brother man said he was up there
[1:05:32] in Canada one time. He's up in that
[1:05:33] woods and the wind started blowing and
[1:05:35] he said that big old tree there would
[1:05:37] just start to topple. It looked like it
[1:05:38] was going to blow over. He said it
[1:05:40] looked like the thing would blow over.
[1:05:42] You ever been there before yourself?
[1:05:44] Looked like it was just all over. Looked
[1:05:46] like it was going to fall over. He says,
[1:05:48] "But every time the wind blows, it rocks
[1:05:50] the tree. It loosens up the roots and
[1:05:52] they can just dig deeper and get a
[1:05:55] better hold." Listen, your trials can
[1:05:58] destroy you or they can draw you closer
[1:06:01] to God. Amen. Your trials can discourage
[1:06:04] you or they can strengthen and establish
[1:06:07] and settle you. It's all depend on what
[1:06:09] you're going to do with it. Amen. Am I
[1:06:10] going to fold or am I going to grow
[1:06:12] here? Amen. He said that's the way it is
[1:06:14] with mockery, laughing, making fun of a
[1:06:16] Christian. What it does persecution
[1:06:18] shakes the Christian, makes him pray
[1:06:20] more, dig down, get a better hold so he
[1:06:24] can stand the storm. Amen. Listen, it
[1:06:26] don't matter how tall your tree is if he
[1:06:28] can't stand the storm. Right. Right.
[1:06:31] We're not worried about verticality.
[1:06:32] We're worried about endurance. Amen. But
[1:06:35] does the root hold when the storm comes?
[1:06:39] Brother says, "Now, what if a man's
[1:06:41] planted by such a thing?" By the river,
[1:06:42] the springs, nine different springs
[1:06:44] feeding into him. He says, "What an
[1:06:46] establishment he has. A man that's
[1:06:47] planted by the rivers of water. One
[1:06:49] water, one spirit. There's gifts of
[1:06:51] healing, the same spirit, gifts of
[1:06:53] prophecy, the same spirit. All the same
[1:06:55] spirit, but many gifts. David saw him
[1:06:57] and he was planted by the tree. Now he
[1:07:00] could not die. Notice why. He had life
[1:07:03] in the roots.
[1:07:05] Listen, that tree is rooted right. You
[1:07:07] cut it down, it'll grow right back up.
[1:07:09] Amen. That's the resurrection.
[1:07:12] Amen. It's not your flesh. It's where
[1:07:14] you're planted. You're planted in
[1:07:16] Christ. That's why there's life for you.
[1:07:19] Amen.
[1:07:20] Praise the Lord. So Abraham, he he digs
[1:07:24] this in preparation. Amen.
[1:07:27] A preparation for a promise because he
[1:07:30] believed that his seed was going to
[1:07:31] inherit the land. He'd been told 400
[1:07:33] years they were going to sojourn. So he
[1:07:35] knows, guess what? At year 401, actually
[1:07:38] 441, but 400 or whatever, they're going
[1:07:41] to come back. And he had so much
[1:07:42] confidence that knowing he wouldn't be
[1:07:43] around for it, he plants this tree.
[1:07:45] Amen. So I make this statement and uh
[1:07:49] obviously like anything there's there's
[1:07:51] exceptions but prosperity is rarely
[1:07:53] found without
[1:07:55] preparation. Amen. Rarely does a person
[1:07:59] prosper when they haven't prepared for
[1:08:00] it. And you see that now Chuck's not
[1:08:04] here today. By the way, Chuck said to
[1:08:05] say hi. He misses you. Just took him to
[1:08:07] the doctor today. He's doing good. You
[1:08:09] know, they take him there and they ask
[1:08:11] him for his identification insurance.
[1:08:13] He's like, you know how it is, man. We
[1:08:15] just did this the last six times. So, he
[1:08:16] was upset. I was upset.
[1:08:19] But, but Chuck's always like, "You
[1:08:21] should preach about the lottery." I'm
[1:08:22] like, "Well, who why am I preaching
[1:08:24] about this? I'm hoping somebody wins and
[1:08:25] gives it to me." But
[1:08:27] so, so I told him the other day, I said,
[1:08:29] "I preached on this and I was talking
[1:08:30] about this the other day with somebody."
[1:08:32] You look at people that win the lottery.
[1:08:33] People in the United States uh uh and
[1:08:36] they they play the lottery and they win
[1:08:38] the lottery. And after five years, now
[1:08:41] think about this. After five years,
[1:08:42] almost a third of the people that have
[1:08:45] won the lottery, they're in bankruptcy.
[1:08:48] Think about that now. They've they've
[1:08:49] made at least a million dollars,
[1:08:51] probably multi-million dollars. And yet
[1:08:54] in five years time, all the money's
[1:08:57] gone. You know why? Now, that's compared
[1:08:59] to like 2% of the average household.
[1:09:02] Amen. Why is it you could give somebody
[1:09:04] a bunch of money and yet they're still
[1:09:07] broke after five years? Well, there's a
[1:09:09] really simple solution. They're not good
[1:09:12] with money.
[1:09:14] Amen. You can give them the blessing.
[1:09:16] You can give them the water and they
[1:09:18] just don't know what to do with it.
[1:09:19] Amen. All they do is they door dash
[1:09:22] more. Now it's on credit and now they've
[1:09:23] got credit cards for their credit cards.
[1:09:25] Amen. They've got big aspirations and
[1:09:28] little discipline. It's funny. I was
[1:09:30] talking about this a few weeks ago and
[1:09:31] because I mentioned that holding with
[1:09:32] Chuck. So I I brought it up and there's
[1:09:34] a guy I'd never seen him before in my
[1:09:36] life sitting at church somewhere. I talk
[1:09:37] about this thing with the lottery. He
[1:09:39] got walked out. I said, "Boy, I hope you
[1:09:40] don't win the lottery. I'm going to look
[1:09:43] stupid." People don't like to hear that.
[1:09:46] Well, you're bad with money. Well,
[1:09:48] listen. If you're a multi-millionaire
[1:09:50] and that money's thrown at you, why are
[1:09:52] they disproportionately bankrupt
[1:09:54] compared to the average person? Well,
[1:09:56] that's what it is. They weren't good
[1:09:58] with money before they won the lottery.
[1:10:02] Winning the lottery didn't make them
[1:10:03] more proficient with using money. No.
[1:10:06] Amen. You say, "Well, I wish I had all
[1:10:09] this money." What are you doing with
[1:10:10] what you have? That's it. Are you giving
[1:10:12] it to the Lord? Are you considering the
[1:10:14] Lord when you Hey, I'm here for you.
[1:10:18] We're here for the Lord. And if you're
[1:10:20] not faithful in a little bit,
[1:10:24] you're not gonna be faithful with a lot.
[1:10:26] The Bible says that. Jesus points that
[1:10:27] out. So, oh, if I had all this money, I
[1:10:29] would do Listen, what you're doing with
[1:10:31] it now is what you would do with it
[1:10:33] there. We see that with the widow woman.
[1:10:35] Her two, she's gotten almost nothing.
[1:10:38] And yet, everything she has, she gives
[1:10:42] unto the Lord. And Jesus points at that
[1:10:44] woman. Now, she's not a millionaire.
[1:10:46] She's not the biggest giver in church,
[1:10:47] but she's faithful with the little bit
[1:10:49] she's got. And Jesus points at that
[1:10:51] woman. That's the one that caused all
[1:10:54] them people that walked by that day. All
[1:10:56] them people that put the money in the
[1:10:57] box and blew the trumpet and let
[1:10:59] everybody know how good they were. Jesus
[1:11:01] points at that woman and says that woman
[1:11:04] right there, she gave more than the rest
[1:11:06] of them. Cuz they gave out of their
[1:11:09] abundance, but she gave all they had.
[1:11:13] No, I'm not getting ready to pass around
[1:11:15] the bucket and how you put your wallets.
[1:11:17] That's not what this is about. That's uh
[1:11:19] I think Billy Andrew did that one time.
[1:11:20] They had them all put their wallets in
[1:11:21] the alt. I'm like, "Praise God. I don't
[1:11:23] know if I'm that
[1:11:26] spiritual." What you're doing with what
[1:11:28] you got now is what you'll do with the
[1:11:31] blessing. So, if you prepare for your
[1:11:34] blessing, Amen. And that's where
[1:11:36] prosperity is found in how you prepare
[1:11:38] for it. Amen. If you were told like
[1:11:41] Abraham, you're going to have a child
[1:11:43] and in him I'm going to bless all
[1:11:44] nations. Guess what you do? You get a
[1:11:47] crib. You get some booties made. You get
[1:11:50] some baby clothes. You'd be going to
[1:11:51] garage sales. You'd be going to baby.
[1:11:53] You go wherever. Amen. You would be
[1:11:55] preparing for the blessing because you
[1:11:58] believe it's coming. Amen. So I I want
[1:12:00] to say this to you. Whatever you're
[1:12:01] believing for, Amen. If it's your
[1:12:03] family, your marriage, your church or
[1:12:05] job, whatever it is, Amen. If you're
[1:12:07] believing for a
[1:12:08] blessing, then prepare for the blessing
[1:12:11] that's coming in. Amen. Do what Abraham
[1:12:14] did. Amen. Prepare yourself for what's
[1:12:16] coming in. Don't sit there and be like,
[1:12:18] "Well, I finally got my blessing." Amen.
[1:12:20] And you did nothing to prepare for it.
[1:12:23] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. It's If
[1:12:26] it's incoming, get ready to receive it.
[1:12:29] Amen. Live ready to receive it. It's
[1:12:32] like the coming of the Lord. You don't
[1:12:33] get ready. Oh, he's coming now. Time to
[1:12:36] get ready. No, you live ready cuz you
[1:12:39] believe it's coming. It's not a matter
[1:12:41] of if. It's just a matter of when. So,
[1:12:44] you live that way cuz you know it's
[1:12:46] going to happen. Amen. And when it
[1:12:48] happens, you're ready to receive him.
[1:12:50] You're dressed in your fine linen. Your
[1:12:52] heart is right with God. You've made
[1:12:54] everything right with the Lord. Amen.
[1:12:56] You're ready for the coming of the Lord.
[1:12:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:02] Christians are making preparations.
[1:13:05] You might not be saying something here.
[1:13:06] Now, listen, different people make
[1:13:08] different kinds of preparations because
[1:13:10] they're expecting different things.
[1:13:12] There's a church in mid mid to southern
[1:13:14] Ohio. It's a bigger church. They're
[1:13:16] making preparations. You know what kind
[1:13:17] of preparations they're making? They're
[1:13:19] digging out bunkers. They're storing up
[1:13:20] canned food for seven years. They're
[1:13:22] getting ready for uh tribulation.
[1:13:24] They're getting ready for it. I'm
[1:13:26] thinking, well, that's if you believe
[1:13:27] what they believe, that's probably what
[1:13:28] you're going into.
[1:13:30] Makes sense. That's what they're looking
[1:13:32] for. So, they prepare for what they're
[1:13:34] looking for. Amen. But I'm not making
[1:13:37] those kind of preparations. Now, listen.
[1:13:38] I believe your power can go out. If you
[1:13:41] got a generator, you got some food at
[1:13:42] home, that's fine. But I'm not preparing
[1:13:44] to stay here for three and a half years
[1:13:46] of tribulation. Amen. I'm not stocking
[1:13:48] up ammunition to fight off the army of
[1:13:50] the Antichrist when it's all going to
[1:13:52] get wiped out here anyway. Amen. Listen,
[1:13:54] if you're going in a rapture and you're
[1:13:56] starting up stuff for a tribulation,
[1:13:58] you're only saving it for people that
[1:13:59] are going to be here when you're gone.
[1:14:04] Amen. Listen, Abraham's not planting the
[1:14:05] grove for the Philistines.
[1:14:09] He's planting it for his posterity. He
[1:14:11] said, "They're going to do what they
[1:14:12] want and God help them. But as for me
[1:14:15] and my house, we're going to be the
[1:14:18] blessed of the Lord. We're going to
[1:14:19] serve the Lord." So Abraham prepares his
[1:14:22] house, prepares his property this way.
[1:14:24] Amen. So that's what I'm getting at when
[1:14:26] they come back to this promised land.
[1:14:28] These are not just a bunch of
[1:14:30] imperialists that are looking to slay
[1:14:33] the natural inhabitants of the land.
[1:14:36] Amen. We try to make them sound like
[1:14:38] they're just these occupants and they've
[1:14:40] come to this land to occupy and they've
[1:14:42] just slaughtered all these people. But
[1:14:43] listen, they already owned much of that
[1:14:45] land and were driven out by the previous
[1:14:47] inhabitants. Amen.
[1:14:50] Well, glory to God. Hope that's okay.
[1:14:52] Amen. It's not just that they're there
[1:14:54] to beat them up and take stuff from
[1:14:55] them, but most of that should have been
[1:14:57] theirs in the first place. Amen. And we
[1:14:59] see this in all the different places.
[1:15:01] Now, you go back and I'm not going to go
[1:15:02] through it all for the sake of time. I
[1:15:04] didn't bring my PowerPoint with a map,
[1:15:06] but Abraham's dug wells. And Isaac, all
[1:15:08] these people, Jacob, they've got wells.
[1:15:10] They've got possessions everywhere.
[1:15:12] Amen. And
[1:15:14] constantly they're the ones under
[1:15:17] attack. Constantly they're the ones that
[1:15:20] are viewed as outside. They they now you
[1:15:22] say, "Well, listen, they're the ones
[1:15:23] that showed up afterwards, but they're
[1:15:24] going places nobody else wanted to go."
[1:15:27] And then when they're blessed now,
[1:15:29] everybody wants Listen, you weren't
[1:15:31] interested in this land till I found
[1:15:33] gold. You weren't interested in this
[1:15:35] church till you found, you know, Praise
[1:15:37] the Lord, somebody. People are always
[1:15:39] interested in something when there's
[1:15:41] something there for them all of a
[1:15:42] sudden. That's the truth. Well, let's
[1:15:45] use the lottery again. I don't know why
[1:15:47] I'm doing this. Let's say you did play
[1:15:50] the lottery just for this is
[1:15:52] theoretical. Amen. And you won the
[1:15:55] lottery. Listen, you would have
[1:15:57] relatives that you've never even heard
[1:16:01] of, showing up, coming out of the If you
[1:16:04] put in the paper, Amen. Hey, remember
[1:16:07] me? It's me,
[1:16:08] Howie. Who are you? Oh, yeah. I'm your
[1:16:11] second cousin's nephew's
[1:16:13] uncle. I don't even know. I can't even
[1:16:16] remember my first cousins most of the
[1:16:17] time. You would have neighbors, man.
[1:16:20] I've always liked you. Yeah,
[1:16:23] we've been good friends over these
[1:16:25] years. You spray painted my house the
[1:16:27] other day. What are you talking about?
[1:16:30] You buried a cat in my
[1:16:33] backyard. We're not friends, but now
[1:16:35] we're friends cuz I've got something you
[1:16:37] want.
[1:16:39] And that's what they did. They didn't
[1:16:40] like Abraham. But as soon as Abraham had
[1:16:42] stuff, oh Abraham, you've been This is
[1:16:45] why when he comes back from the
[1:16:46] slaughter of the kings, Sodom's like,
[1:16:48] listen, we'd love to give you something.
[1:16:50] And Abraham's like, "No, I don't want
[1:16:52] what you got." Because as soon as you
[1:16:53] give me something, you'll say, "Oh,
[1:16:55] yeah. Abraham's who he is today because
[1:16:58] of us." Well, glory to God. Oh, this
[1:17:00] ministry, this man who is who he is
[1:17:02] today, I we made him that way. And
[1:17:05] Abraham said, "Listen, if I take this
[1:17:07] offering from you, you'll say you made
[1:17:09] Abraham rich." Listen, I don't want you
[1:17:12] to get the glory for it, sodomites. I
[1:17:14] want God to get the glory for it. God
[1:17:16] did this. God give us the victory. God
[1:17:19] give us the promise. And I'm not looking
[1:17:22] to share his glory with anyone else.
[1:17:25] So I say this the these people, they
[1:17:27] show up and now that they want what he's
[1:17:30] got because all of a sudden, hey, we
[1:17:31] didn't know that was there. That's it's
[1:17:33] why I'm there and you're not. So these
[1:17:36] enemies, they come and they try to take
[1:17:38] all this. And we see this. You go to the
[1:17:39] 26th chapter of Genesis later in the
[1:17:42] life in Isaac's life. And we'll just
[1:17:43] start in verse six. It says Isaac dwelt
[1:17:45] in Ger and the men of the place asked
[1:17:47] him of his wife. So they do the same
[1:17:49] thing to him like they did Abraham and
[1:17:52] he of course has the same response. I
[1:17:54] guess the family spirit is strong here.
[1:17:58] And he said Isaac said she is my sister
[1:18:01] for he feared to say she is my wife lest
[1:18:03] he said he the men of that place should
[1:18:05] kill me for Rebecca because she was fair
[1:18:08] to look upon. And it came to pass when
[1:18:10] he had been there a long time that
[1:18:11] Aimilec, king of the Philistines, looked
[1:18:15] out of the window and saw, and behold,
[1:18:16] Isaac was sporting with Rebecca his
[1:18:20] wife. Now, I'm not here to preach
[1:18:21] courtship today, but apparently there's
[1:18:23] a certain way you treat your wife that
[1:18:25] you don't treat other
[1:18:26] women. And that's what it like sees
[1:18:28] here. Amen. And so, whatever they're
[1:18:31] doing, it's noteworthy enough that he
[1:18:33] observes. Verse 19 called Isaac said,
[1:18:36] "Behold of assurityity she is thy wife
[1:18:39] and how saidst thou she is my sister."
[1:18:41] He's probably thinking, "Man, I've dealt
[1:18:43] with this before." Probably why he was
[1:18:45] looking this time.
[1:18:47] Got to give a little credit here. He's
[1:18:49] probably looking for it like, "No, I've
[1:18:50] been here before. Let me just check this
[1:18:53] out." And so he says this. And Isaac
[1:18:57] said unto him, "Because I said, lest I
[1:18:59] die for her." And Abel said, "What is
[1:19:01] this thou hast done unto us? One of thy
[1:19:03] people might have li have lightly have
[1:19:06] lined with thy wife, and thou should
[1:19:08] shouldest have brought guiltiness upon
[1:19:10] us." And Aim charged all the people,
[1:19:12] saying, "He that toucheth this man or
[1:19:15] his wife shall surely be put to death."
[1:19:18] In other words, touch not the Lord or
[1:19:20] his anointed. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:24] Praise the Lord. So verse 12, then Isaac
[1:19:27] sowed in that land and received in the
[1:19:29] same year and hundfold. That's quite a
[1:19:31] prophet. And the Lord blessed him and
[1:19:33] the man waxed great and went forth and
[1:19:34] grew until he became very great. For he
[1:19:37] had possessions of flocks and
[1:19:39] possessions of herds and great store of
[1:19:41] servants. Notice this. And the
[1:19:43] Philistines envied
[1:19:45] him. They saw all the blessing in his
[1:19:48] life. They got a little jealous. Well,
[1:19:51] we want what he's got. He's got
[1:19:54] something. We don't have it. Well,
[1:19:55] praise the Lord. There it is. Amen. Now,
[1:19:58] I keep losing my place here. Uh, what am
[1:20:00] I on? Verse 14.
[1:20:02] Okay. It says this. And the Philistines
[1:20:05] envied them for all, notice this, for
[1:20:07] all the wells which his father's
[1:20:08] servants had digged in the days of
[1:20:10] Abraham his father. The Philistines had
[1:20:13] stopped them and filled them with earth.
[1:20:17] Interesting. Verse 16. And Abim said
[1:20:20] unto Isaac, "Go from us, for thou art
[1:20:22] much mightier than we." And Isaac
[1:20:23] departed thence, and pitched his tent in
[1:20:25] the valley of Guerrar, and dwelt there.
[1:20:26] And Isaac digged again, notice this,
[1:20:29] digged again the wells of water which
[1:20:31] they had digged in the days of Abraham
[1:20:34] his father. For the Philistines had
[1:20:36] stopped them after the death of Abraham.
[1:20:39] And he called their names, I love this,
[1:20:41] and he called their names after the
[1:20:43] names by which his father had called
[1:20:45] them. Amen. Listen, if it was good
[1:20:47] enough for daddy, it's good enough for
[1:20:49] me. It's good for Paul and Silas. If it
[1:20:52] was good in the fiery furnace, that's
[1:20:53] good enough for me. If daddy called it
[1:20:55] that, and it's daddy's, well, I'm going
[1:20:57] to call it the same thing. Amen. We
[1:21:00] don't need to rename it and rebrand it.
[1:21:02] We'll just call it what the Bible calls
[1:21:04] it. Amen. That's what we do. We've got
[1:21:06] this sort of thing today. We've got
[1:21:08] tolerance and we've got Let's just call
[1:21:10] what the Bible calls. Let's just call it
[1:21:12] sin. That's what the Bible called it.
[1:21:14] Amen. It's the sin of the enemy and the
[1:21:16] blessing of God. Let's just call a spade
[1:21:18] a spade. Praise the Lord. So he's like,
[1:21:20] "Listen, I'm just going to call what my
[1:21:22] my daddy called it." And Isaac's
[1:21:24] servants digged in the valley and there
[1:21:25] they found a well of springing water.
[1:21:27] And the herdsmen of Gerard did strive
[1:21:29] with Isaac's herdmen, saying, "The water
[1:21:31] is ours." And he called the name of the
[1:21:33] well Essic or striving because they
[1:21:35] struggle with him. And they dig another
[1:21:36] well and stroke for that also. And he
[1:21:38] called the name of it sitna. And he
[1:21:40] moved from fence and digged another
[1:21:41] well. And for that they strove not and
[1:21:43] he called the name of it Rahoboth. And
[1:21:46] he said for now the Lord hath made room
[1:21:48] for us and we shall be fruitful in the
[1:21:50] land. And he went up from then fence to
[1:21:52] Beersa. So notice where he goes. He goes
[1:21:54] back to this oath. This place where
[1:21:56] Abraham made his oath. And the Lord
[1:21:57] appeared unto him the same night and
[1:22:00] said, I am the God of Abraham thy
[1:22:02] father. Fear not, for I am with thee,
[1:22:05] and will bless thee and multiply thy
[1:22:08] seed for my servant Abraham's sake. and
[1:22:11] he builded an altar there and called
[1:22:13] upon the name of the Lord and pitched
[1:22:14] his tent there and there Isaac's
[1:22:16] servants digged a well. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:18] So when he goes back to the place his
[1:22:20] daddy was had been and he finds Beersa,
[1:22:23] God speaks to him. Amen. Amen. I love it
[1:22:26] because brother Bram says if if if you
[1:22:28] ever if you ever find that you're
[1:22:29] without God, listen, God never leaves
[1:22:31] us. He never forsakes us. Amen. If you
[1:22:34] can't find him, go back to where you
[1:22:36] left him at. Like that little soldier,
[1:22:38] he said, "Well, go back and find him
[1:22:40] where he left him at." And that soldier
[1:22:41] began to pray in the dying moments of
[1:22:43] his life. Said, "Now I lay me down to
[1:22:45] sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep."
[1:22:47] Left him when he was just a little boy.
[1:22:49] But when he went back to that place, he
[1:22:51] found that God was waiting for him
[1:22:53] there. And when Isaac goes back to this
[1:22:55] place that God and Abraham made a
[1:22:57] covenant with Aimc and he dug this and
[1:22:59] he had God as a witness there, God meets
[1:23:01] him and speaks to him. Amen. Notice
[1:23:03] verse 26. Then Aimilec went to him from
[1:23:06] Gerr. Now, Abib is the one that sent him
[1:23:08] out. He's like, "Go from us. You're
[1:23:11] mightier than us. We We don't need you
[1:23:13] around. It's trouble for us." Then Aib
[1:23:15] went to him from Gar and
[1:23:17] Authie captain of the army. And Isaac
[1:23:21] said unto them, "This is a good
[1:23:23] question. Wherefore come ye to me,
[1:23:25] seeing ye hate me, and have set me away
[1:23:28] from me?" In other words, you didn't
[1:23:29] want nothing to do with
[1:23:31] me. probably meant this in your own life
[1:23:33] somewhere with somebody didn't want
[1:23:35] nothing to do with me told me hit the
[1:23:38] road get lost so I went down here and
[1:23:41] now you're coming to me
[1:23:45] you're coming to
[1:23:47] me what are you coming to me for and
[1:23:50] they said we have certain we we saw
[1:23:52] certainly the Lord is with thee and we
[1:23:54] said let there be now an oath betw twix
[1:23:56] us even betw twix us and thee and let us
[1:23:58] make a covenant that thou will do us no
[1:24:00] hurt and we have not touch thee as we
[1:24:02] have done unto thee nothing but
[1:24:05] good sent thee away in peace. Thou art
[1:24:08] now the blessed Lord. He made them a
[1:24:10] feast. And they did eat and drink. And
[1:24:12] they rose up the times in the morning
[1:24:13] and swear one to another. And Isaac sent
[1:24:16] them away and they departed in peace.
[1:24:18] And it came to pass that day that
[1:24:19] Isaac's servants came and told him
[1:24:21] concerning the well which they had
[1:24:22] digged and said unto him, "We have found
[1:24:26] water." And they called it Sheba.
[1:24:28] Therefore, the name of the city is Beers
[1:24:30] Sheba unto this day. Amen. So, after all
[1:24:33] this, he redigs these walls. He finds
[1:24:35] the blessing. And now the enemy shows
[1:24:37] up. Oh, you dug up all the wells that we
[1:24:39] stopped up. Amen. Amen. Right. Well,
[1:24:43] praise the Lord. That's right. Amen.
[1:24:46] People they'll they'll they'll be in a
[1:24:48] certain situation in their life. They'll
[1:24:50] go through certain things and they'll
[1:24:52] cry. They'll look for help from the Lord
[1:24:54] and the Lord will help them. Amen. When
[1:24:56] nobody else could help them. And then
[1:24:57] when they get help, now the enemy shows
[1:25:00] up. Hey, I've got a blessing for you. If
[1:25:02] you just compromise on this a little
[1:25:04] bit, if you just change how you Yeah,
[1:25:06] that's what the enemy does. Amen. He
[1:25:07] comes to you when you got something he
[1:25:09] wants. You know why? Cuz he envys you.
[1:25:11] The Philistines envied Isaac. And
[1:25:14] listen, the enemy wants what's yours.
[1:25:15] Amen. You say, "What are you talking
[1:25:17] about?" Listen, Satan said in the
[1:25:18] beginning, he wanted a kingdom. He
[1:25:20] wanted to be like the sons of the most
[1:25:22] high. He wanted to have a kingdom. Amen.
[1:25:25] Everything that he wants, God has forbid
[1:25:27] him to have and he's given to you and
[1:25:29] us. He's given creative power to you and
[1:25:33] I. It's in our tongues. Amen. You have
[1:25:35] what the devil wants. He's envious. He
[1:25:38] can never have what you have, so he's
[1:25:40] out to destroy you. He's out to destroy
[1:25:43] me. He says, "I I can't get what I want,
[1:25:45] but if I can stop God's children,
[1:25:48] if I can inflict something on them, so
[1:25:50] he seeks to wear you out. He seeks to
[1:25:52] attack you." And listen, he's the kind
[1:25:54] of guy, Amen, he'll get you in trouble
[1:25:56] and then call the police on you. He's
[1:25:59] the kind of person he'll tell, hey, you
[1:26:00] know what? You can just do this a little
[1:26:02] bit. You can look this way. You can do
[1:26:04] this thing. And as soon as you take the
[1:26:06] bait, he's the one to get you in
[1:26:08] trouble. Amen.
[1:26:10] So, here's this man. They show up, well,
[1:26:11] listen, listen. We just want to make a
[1:26:13] deal with you. And Isaac realizes,
[1:26:15] listen, you ain't got nothing for me.
[1:26:18] So, let's make a deal. You don't come
[1:26:19] near me, I won't cut your head off.
[1:26:22] and they go their way and I'm going to
[1:26:23] go my way and I'm going to dig out the
[1:26:25] old well that my father had. Amen.
[1:26:27] Listen, we don't need a new Bible today.
[1:26:30] That's what the message has showed us.
[1:26:32] We don't need another revelation. We
[1:26:34] don't need a third uh covenant. We just
[1:26:37] need to believe the one that we've got.
[1:26:40] The one that was laid out on the day of
[1:26:42] Pentecost. The one that Jesus died and
[1:26:44] rose for. Amen. It's good enough. Amen.
[1:26:47] Just do what the old one says. Amen.
[1:26:49] We're so busy in 2025 trying to reinvent
[1:26:53] the wheel and find a new way to get
[1:26:55] closer to God. And we've got our ideas
[1:26:58] and we've got our doctrines. Let's just
[1:27:00] do what a prophet said. Let's just do
[1:27:02] what the Bible said. Amen. Well, praise
[1:27:05] the Lord. Listen, Jesus dealt with the
[1:27:07] the Pharisees over this very thing.
[1:27:09] Their traditions made the word of God of
[1:27:12] none effect. Amen. It's not that God's
[1:27:14] word doesn't work. It's not that God's
[1:27:16] not the same. their traditions made it
[1:27:19] not do anything for them. Amen. People
[1:27:22] say, "Well, I I've been praying. I want
[1:27:24] to hear from God." Amen. Well, are you
[1:27:26] listening?
[1:27:28] See, what we want is we want God to
[1:27:29] speak to us on our time. We're not going
[1:27:32] to make the preparation like Abraham.
[1:27:34] Amen. We're going to ask God to speak to
[1:27:36] us about a certain thing, and then we'll
[1:27:37] go be busy doing this, and we'll go do
[1:27:39] that, and we'll implement our own idea,
[1:27:41] and we'll throw our own ideas in here. I
[1:27:43] don't know why God's not speaking to me.
[1:27:45] Are you taking time to listen?
[1:27:51] Well, praise the Lord. Well, I I'm
[1:27:53] believing God for this certain blessing.
[1:27:56] Amen. But has your idea got in the way?
[1:28:00] You know, Brother Ram talks about this.
[1:28:01] I don't have in front of me, but it's in
[1:28:03] Christ the mystery of God revealed.
[1:28:05] Brother talking about the three-fold
[1:28:06] revelation that he had gotten pertaining
[1:28:09] to the seven seventh seal. He's talking
[1:28:10] about Christ, the mystery of God, how
[1:28:12] Christ would come to to redeem a bride
[1:28:14] and then receive a bride and then he's
[1:28:16] talking about these different things.
[1:28:18] And brother Brandham makes this
[1:28:19] statement and I love this because this
[1:28:20] is this is where we're at today. And he
[1:28:24] makes this statement. He says, "God is
[1:28:26] trying to give us this revelation, but
[1:28:29] we let so many things get in the way."
[1:28:34] Notice who's blocking the way up now.
[1:28:36] Right? We let family affair and social
[1:28:38] affair and jobs and church, we let
[1:28:41] things get in the way. Amen. Listen, we
[1:28:44] see what the Bible promises. Amen. And
[1:28:47] if we're believers, we believe it. Amen.
[1:28:49] So then if it's not coming to pass, I I
[1:28:51] I I encourage you to think about this
[1:28:53] for a second. Amen. Perhaps the
[1:28:55] problem's not God.
[1:28:58] The problem's not God. The problem's not
[1:29:00] the spirit of God. God's not changed.
[1:29:02] Listen, if you'll redig out the same
[1:29:05] well, the same waters that Abraham
[1:29:08] drank, they're still there. Amen. If you
[1:29:11] believe the same promises that that
[1:29:13] Peter and Paul believed, God's the same.
[1:29:16] The problem is something got in the way.
[1:29:18] The enemy puts things in the way. What
[1:29:21] you need to do is not dig a new well.
[1:29:23] What you need to do is not believe,
[1:29:25] well, you know what? We don't believe
[1:29:26] God does anymore and the days of
[1:29:28] miracles has passed. What you need to do
[1:29:29] is dig out the well.
[1:29:33] Dig out whatever is in the way of you
[1:29:35] and the blessing. Amen. Something got in
[1:29:38] the way. Get it out of there.
[1:29:41] Amen. Listen, our ideas, our traditions
[1:29:46] get in the way. Praise the Lord. Now, I
[1:29:47] got a an example that I want to use with
[1:29:50] this. Amen. Because when you look at the
[1:29:52] book of uh when we look in the book of
[1:29:53] Genesis and Abraham, he sends out
[1:29:56] Eleazar. Of course, brother Brandon's
[1:29:58] ministry is a type of the same thing.
[1:29:59] Amen. He sends out Eleazar to find a
[1:30:01] bride for Isaac. And you know where he
[1:30:04] finds her at? At a well. Finds her at a
[1:30:06] well. Amen. Eleazar approaches this town
[1:30:09] and he says, "Now listen, I'm going to
[1:30:11] pray. I'm going to trust this God of
[1:30:14] Abraham. I'm going to pray and if
[1:30:16] there's a woman there that's to be the
[1:30:18] wife of Isaac." Amen. When I get there,
[1:30:20] I'm going to pray and say, "Would you
[1:30:22] water my camels?"
[1:30:24] And when you water the camels, she'll
[1:30:26] say, "Yeah, I'll sorry, he'll ask water
[1:30:29] for himself." I I'll ask for water for
[1:30:32] myself. And she'll say, "Not only will I
[1:30:34] give you water, I'll get water for your
[1:30:35] camels." Amen. And I love to dramatize
[1:30:37] this because he shows up, he sees this
[1:30:39] woman, and says, "Hey, I'd like a
[1:30:41] drink." And she says, "I'll get water."
[1:30:43] Now, he doesn't have to uh do what some
[1:30:45] of us would do. Hey, I need water for my
[1:30:48] camels. Okay. Or for me. And okay. And
[1:30:50] he's like, "Oh, boy. You know, those uh
[1:30:53] those camels look pretty thirsty. It's a
[1:30:56] hot one today." Yeah. Yeah, it really
[1:30:58] is. Boy, I wish somebody
[1:31:00] would trying to make it come to pass. He
[1:31:04] doesn't try to make it happen. Well, you
[1:31:06] know, I want you to do, but he leaves it
[1:31:09] in the hands of God. He says, "Will you
[1:31:12] get me a drink?" And she says, "Not only
[1:31:13] will I get you a drink, I'll get it for
[1:31:15] your camels also." And by this he knew
[1:31:18] the Bible said that that was the one
[1:31:20] that God had ordained. Amen. Now listen,
[1:31:23] she Now why is that brother? Tells you
[1:31:25] why the angel the Lord went ahead and
[1:31:28] prepared her heart. Amen. She was
[1:31:31] predestinated to it. That's why she
[1:31:34] recognized it. Amen. But yet when we
[1:31:36] read in the book of John the 4th
[1:31:37] chapter, Jesus comes to another
[1:31:39] predestinated seed. She's at a well as
[1:31:42] well. And he asked the same question.
[1:31:44] Think about this now. He goes up there
[1:31:46] and says,"Woman, get me a drink." And
[1:31:49] what she should have said was the same
[1:31:51] thing. Yeah, I'll get you a drink. But
[1:31:53] she resists it. Now, think about this.
[1:31:55] She's predestinated just like Rebecca,
[1:31:57] right? She's a daughter of God. But
[1:31:59] what's different is her tradition.
[1:32:04] She says, "Sir, we don't have any
[1:32:06] dealings with the Jews." See, her
[1:32:07] religious idea got in the way.
[1:32:10] See, this is why sometimes a people a
[1:32:12] person you can tell them about the
[1:32:14] message. It's it's it's funny to me.
[1:32:17] It's somebody that witnesses to people.
[1:32:18] The the most unchurched people. Can I
[1:32:21] say it that way? The most unchurched
[1:32:23] people are the the the easiest to
[1:32:25] receive what you have to say. You talk
[1:32:26] about something like serpent seat. Oh,
[1:32:27] yeah. That totally makes sense. Yeah. It
[1:32:29] lines up with the Bible. When you take a
[1:32:30] person that's been in church for 40
[1:32:31] years and they're in doctrine to certain
[1:32:33] denomination and we were taught this way
[1:32:36] and this is how we always and you try to
[1:32:38] listen it's so much harder to unteach a
[1:32:40] person and sometimes you don't know that
[1:32:43] might be a seat of God but you can't
[1:32:45] tell because of all the traditional
[1:32:47] garbage in the way. And so God has to
[1:32:50] deconstruct all that. Amen. Listen with
[1:32:52] Rebecca there's there's nothing there.
[1:32:54] There's no presupposition. But this
[1:32:56] woman at the well, she's been taught we
[1:32:58] don't do such things in our church. We
[1:33:00] don't believe in the days of miracles
[1:33:01] and we don't believe in the super we
[1:33:02] don't believe in the supernatural like
[1:33:04] that. And God, we don't send we don't
[1:33:05] we're not looking for prophets. Amen.
[1:33:07] Now, listen. She's a
[1:33:08] Samaritan. And I uh I could take a whole
[1:33:11] another sermon and unpack this, and I'm
[1:33:12] not going to. But the Samaritans,
[1:33:15] they're they have a they call it a
[1:33:17] religious disputation, but it's really a
[1:33:19] political disputation. And that's all.
[1:33:21] It's just politics under the guise of
[1:33:23] religion. She's and she talks about
[1:33:25] listen our fathers say that we should
[1:33:28] worship on this mountain. Now this is
[1:33:29] the mountain where Jacob was at this is
[1:33:31] over. They took uh mount uh Garism there
[1:33:35] where Jacob had come and dug this well
[1:33:37] and they said well listen Jacob used to
[1:33:39] drink all this water. He used to drink
[1:33:41] from this well. So they took that and
[1:33:44] they took the promise and it's a it's a
[1:33:45] religious disputation because in the
[1:33:47] book of Deuteronomy Moses said that the
[1:33:49] place that the Lord your God shall put
[1:33:51] his name that's where you worship. Well,
[1:33:53] they took that scripture and they
[1:33:54] interpret said, well, that was the mount
[1:33:56] of blessing when Joshua come in the
[1:33:58] promised land, Mount Garism. So, the
[1:33:59] whole dispute is our fathers say to
[1:34:01] worship here and your fathers say to
[1:34:04] worship in Jerusalem and it's a
[1:34:05] religious dispute. It goes back to the
[1:34:07] time of Rahoboam after Solomon dies. The
[1:34:10] kingdom split. That's why you have Judah
[1:34:11] and the half the two half two and a half
[1:34:13] tribes. They split from Israel. And
[1:34:16] Israel, they go and build two golden
[1:34:18] calves. We've seen that before, too.
[1:34:20] Amen. They go build two golden calves
[1:34:22] and the kingdom of Israel they're going
[1:34:24] to worship here in Mount Garism. Amen.
[1:34:26] And they do now this this is what's
[1:34:28] amazing to me. The reason they do
[1:34:31] this is they recognize that the time of
[1:34:34] worship is coming and the people they
[1:34:36] want to go to Jerusalem to worship
[1:34:38] because that's where they're supposed to
[1:34:40] go. But they said we don't want the
[1:34:42] people to go there. They said lest their
[1:34:45] hearts turn back. Amen. Notice the enemy
[1:34:49] doesn't want your heart to turn back to
[1:34:51] the original faith. Amen. Because
[1:34:53] listen, Solomon's temple was vindicated
[1:34:57] by God. But they didn't want the people
[1:34:59] to turn their hearts back there. Even
[1:35:01] though Solomon had made a dedication and
[1:35:03] a promise there. So they offered a false
[1:35:06] worship to stop the hearts from being
[1:35:09] restored. Amen. And that's why the
[1:35:11] message today has been rejected in a
[1:35:13] country like this. They've been taught
[1:35:16] better. They know better. They've got
[1:35:18] scholars and understanding. And listen,
[1:35:20] they can give you a hundred reasons why
[1:35:22] God doesn't do today what he used to do.
[1:35:24] But listen, God not doing today what he
[1:35:27] used to do. That don't help me out when
[1:35:29] you need a drink. Amen. We've got all
[1:35:32] these excuses for why God doesn't do
[1:35:35] what he used to do. But a message has
[1:35:37] come and showed us he's the same
[1:35:39] yesterday, today, and forever. This is
[1:35:41] why brother Bram could testify that
[1:35:43] Jesus had more success in Jeffersonville
[1:35:47] than he did his own meetings. Why?
[1:35:48] Because God's the same.
[1:35:51] So this religious idea is trying to stop
[1:35:54] her. Amen. And she gets up there and
[1:35:58] says, "Uh, listen, we we re and this is
[1:36:00] the thing. Samaritans, they reject the
[1:36:02] idea of prophets outside of the Torah."
[1:36:04] Amen. Because if you believed Isaac and
[1:36:08] Jeremiah or is I'm sorry, Isaiah and
[1:36:10] Jeremiah. And if you believed all the
[1:36:12] prophets, you would believe that
[1:36:13] Jerusalem is the chosen place of
[1:36:15] worship. But they don't believe in all
[1:36:17] these prophets, but they they do believe
[1:36:18] in one prophet because they believe the
[1:36:20] words of Moses. And Moses said what? He
[1:36:22] said, "The Lord your God shall raise up
[1:36:25] a prophet singular liken unto me. Hear
[1:36:28] ye him." So they're not looking. They
[1:36:30] they disbelieve Isaiah and Ezekiel and
[1:36:32] Jeremiah and Daniel. But they do believe
[1:36:35] that there is a prophet coming. Amen.
[1:36:39] And they recognize that there was a
[1:36:41] prophet like unto Moses. And what I love
[1:36:43] about it is Moses did the same thing
[1:36:45] when he was exiled. Amen. When he was
[1:36:47] exiled from Egypt, what does he do? He
[1:36:50] goes down to uh the land of Midian. And
[1:36:52] when he's down there, praise the Lord.
[1:36:55] When he's down there, they're the
[1:36:56] daughters of Jethro. They're
[1:36:57] shepherdesses. And they're all there's
[1:36:59] seven of them, I believe. They're
[1:37:00] gathered at a well and they were going
[1:37:02] to drink from that well that their
[1:37:04] father had put there. But some other
[1:37:06] shepherds, can I say it this way? Some
[1:37:09] false pastors, they got in the way. And
[1:37:12] so, but when Moses shows up, what does
[1:37:14] he do? He drives them away. And then he
[1:37:18] says, "Listen, I will draw water for
[1:37:20] you." So, they actually get home earlier
[1:37:22] than normal. And Jethro says, "Well,
[1:37:24] listen. What are you doing home so
[1:37:25] early?" And they explain there was some
[1:37:27] shepherds there. They tried to keep us
[1:37:29] from drawing from the well. But this
[1:37:31] man, this prophet came and he drove away
[1:37:34] the false shepherds. And then he drew
[1:37:37] out for us. So this woman's talking to
[1:37:40] Jesus said, "Listen, I ain't got no
[1:37:42] dunes with you. The water's deep. Amen.
[1:37:44] I'm I'm not going to get it for you."
[1:37:45] And Jesus says, "If you knew who I was,
[1:37:48] if you knew the gift of God and who was
[1:37:51] speaking to you, you'd asked me like
[1:37:53] Moses, you'd asked me for a drink and
[1:37:56] I'd give you a drink. and you drink this
[1:37:58] water, you'd never thirst again. And so
[1:38:01] her mind gets to turn a little bit.
[1:38:02] Says, "Well, listen. How you going to
[1:38:04] draw all this water?" He says, "If you
[1:38:06] drink the water here at this well from
[1:38:07] Jacob, you drink from this old sistern.
[1:38:10] You drink from your religious idea,
[1:38:11] you'll get thirsty again." Amen. Coming
[1:38:13] into church thirsty, walking out
[1:38:15] thirsty, thirsty through the week,
[1:38:17] looking for God, can't get satisfied.
[1:38:19] Never. It's never good enough. He said,
[1:38:20] "But if you drink the water I'm offering
[1:38:22] you. If you drink this water, you'll
[1:38:25] never thirst again." She says, "Sir, I
[1:38:28] want to drink this water. Let me drink
[1:38:30] this water." She said, "All right, go
[1:38:31] get your husband." Well, that was a
[1:38:33] curveball, wasn't it? Amen. Well, she
[1:38:36] did like
[1:38:37] Abraham. She did like Isaac. Well, I
[1:38:41] don't have a husband. That's true.
[1:38:44] You've had five. See, she wasn't lying.
[1:38:47] She just kind of omitted the truth. I
[1:38:50] don't have
[1:38:52] one. Well, you had five and the one
[1:38:57] you're with now is not even your
[1:38:58] husband. And she makes this statement.
[1:39:00] Brother talks about this all through the
[1:39:01] message. We we we go over and over. She
[1:39:03] said, "Sir, I perceive you're a
[1:39:05] prophet." And what I want you to think
[1:39:06] about for a second, it's not just
[1:39:08] significant that she recognizes the
[1:39:10] prophetic gift. It's significant that
[1:39:12] she acknowledges it because they don't
[1:39:15] believe in such a thing.
[1:39:17] So when she says, "I perceive you're a
[1:39:19] prophet." She's literally saying, "You
[1:39:21] sound like the one that was to come
[1:39:24] after Moses. You sound like the
[1:39:26] fulfillment." Because you're doing the
[1:39:27] same thing Moses did at the well doing
[1:39:30] the same thing. Amen. He said, "I
[1:39:32] perceive you're a prophet. We know that
[1:39:34] when Messiah comes, he's going to do
[1:39:35] these things." He said, "Now your
[1:39:36] fathers say uh to worship in Jerusalem
[1:39:39] and ours say to worship." What's the
[1:39:41] right religious answer? You know what
[1:39:43] Jesus
[1:39:44] does? Listen, the right place to worship
[1:39:46] is not either here or
[1:39:49] Jerusalem. Amen. The time is coming and
[1:39:53] now is. Amen. And let me just say this
[1:39:55] this afternoon or this morning. It still
[1:39:57] is. The time is he's looking for a
[1:40:00] people to worship him in spirit and in
[1:40:03] truth. She says, "Are you greater than
[1:40:05] our father Jacob?" Guess what? He was.
[1:40:08] Amen. She was looking at Jacob's well
[1:40:11] and there was a greater than Jacob
[1:40:12] there. Amen. She could look at Jerusalem
[1:40:14] and say, "Are you greater than Solomon?"
[1:40:16] And there was a greater than Solomon
[1:40:17] that was there. He was the greatest one
[1:40:19] of them all. And she'd almost missed it.
[1:40:22] But when he says this, and she recogniz
[1:40:25] it. She says, "We know that when Messiah
[1:40:27] comes, right?" And they don't even
[1:40:29] believe that. Listen, that's a prophecy
[1:40:31] from Isaiah. They don't even believe it.
[1:40:33] So, in other words, now everything she's
[1:40:36] ever believed in the face of this
[1:40:39] vindicated word, in the face of this
[1:40:42] living water, she throws it all away and
[1:40:45] says, "I want this. I know that when
[1:40:47] this Messiah that they speak about when
[1:40:49] he comes, I know that Elijah is going to
[1:40:52] restore all things. I know God said he's
[1:40:54] going to do these things. When Messiah
[1:40:56] comes, he'll do this." And he says, "I
[1:40:58] am he to whom you speak." And she runs
[1:41:01] into the city.
[1:41:04] Amen. Amen. And says, "Come see a man
[1:41:08] who told me all I ever did. Is this not
[1:41:13] the Christ?" Listen, she's not preaching
[1:41:14] this to a bunch of friendly people.
[1:41:17] They're not looking for a Christ. It's
[1:41:19] like, "But isn't this what they said
[1:41:20] he'd do?" Amen. Is this not what the
[1:41:22] word said would come to pass? Listen,
[1:41:24] people can scoff at this message and say
[1:41:26] what they want about it. Is this not
[1:41:27] exactly what the Bible said would
[1:41:28] happen, though? Is it not Luke 17:30,
[1:41:31] Revelation 10? Is it not Malachi? It's
[1:41:33] the It's what it said. Yes. You, if you
[1:41:36] don't want to believe it, that's up to
[1:41:37] you. But it's exactly what the Bible
[1:41:38] said. Is this not what they said? What
[1:41:43] happened? Is this not a Messiah? Is this
[1:41:46] not the Christ?
[1:41:49] So, she's
[1:41:50] let you all preach to me for years, and
[1:41:54] yet you never showed up to the well for
[1:41:55] me. You all left.
[1:41:58] I think about this. I always get in
[1:42:00] trouble with this, so I'm gonna have to
[1:42:01] be careful because I don't get on dating
[1:42:03] sites. But you see these people, they
[1:42:05] they do all this online dating. It's the
[1:42:06] thing now. Probably for most of us,
[1:42:08] that's not a thing, but hopefully they
[1:42:11] do all this online dating and you know,
[1:42:13] these people that, you know, they on the
[1:42:16] internet you can be whoever you want.
[1:42:18] That's right.
[1:42:20] On the internet, you uh you know, you've
[1:42:22] got a six-pack and you make six figures.
[1:42:25] Oh, people they do this. Amen. And this
[1:42:28] woman, listen, for I don't know anything
[1:42:30] about what she looked like. She'd been
[1:42:32] married five times. So, she must have
[1:42:34] been sort of okay, I guess. I don't
[1:42:36] know. And I think about this. Amen.
[1:42:39] There was a guy somewhere in Israel that
[1:42:43] one day looked at this woman who'd been
[1:42:45] married four times and says, "You know
[1:42:46] what? It's going to be different this
[1:42:48] time." And it
[1:42:50] wasn't. If there's anybody here who's
[1:42:51] been married five times, I apologize.
[1:42:56] Somewhere there was a guy that had seen
[1:42:58] four failed marriages. I've seen f
[1:43:01] actually there was another guy after
[1:43:02] that. Listen, husband number one didn't
[1:43:04] change her. Amen. Listen, when she got
[1:43:07] divorced, she was the same person.
[1:43:09] Husband number two, number three, number
[1:43:10] four. Husband number five comes along,
[1:43:12] looks at this woman, sees she's been
[1:43:14] divorced four times, says, "Yeah, but
[1:43:15] you know what? It's going to be
[1:43:16] different this time." Guess what? It
[1:43:18] wasn't different. You know why? Cuz the
[1:43:20] man couldn't change her. She can't
[1:43:22] change her. Her dad's system couldn't
[1:43:24] change her. She'd been through five
[1:43:25] husbands. She was living with a man and
[1:43:27] none of the men can change her. But she
[1:43:29] didn't meet a man that well that could
[1:43:32] change everything about her life. Amen.
[1:43:33] She just didn't know what to look for.
[1:43:36] But he came looking for her. Amen.
[1:43:39] Something made a difference. Amen. She
[1:43:41] wasn't coming to draw with joy out of
[1:43:44] the wells of salvation, but there was a
[1:43:46] man there that day. There was a man that
[1:43:48] could turn on the light and he made the
[1:43:50] difference. says, "Don't draw that old
[1:43:52] stagnant water. There's nothing there
[1:43:53] for you."
[1:43:57] Why do we draw from the things that
[1:43:59] don't give us joy? Right.
[1:44:03] And then we wonder why we struggle, why
[1:44:07] we're depressed, why we're down, why why
[1:44:11] we don't see the will of God come to
[1:44:12] pass around. Quit drawing from the wrong
[1:44:14] water.
[1:44:16] Listen, if you drank the real water, you
[1:44:18] wouldn't thirst. You don't want Jacob's.
[1:44:21] Well, listen. That was good for Jacob's
[1:44:23] day. Brother Bam said that's good for
[1:44:24] his cattle. But that's not what we've
[1:44:26] got today. Listen, we need something
[1:44:28] greater. We need what she had that day.
[1:44:33] Amen.
[1:44:37] All this whole Let me let me say that. I
[1:44:39] want to drop this in here real quick,
[1:44:40] too, because I think this is
[1:44:42] important. The Samaritans and the Jews,
[1:44:45] they had this dispute and their dispute
[1:44:47] Jesus talks about it. They hindered
[1:44:49] people that would have entered in. It
[1:44:51] was a hindrance. Amen.
[1:44:53] I I for me today, I don't want to I'm
[1:44:56] not trying to keep anybody out of the
[1:44:57] kingdom. I want people in the kingdom.
[1:45:00] Amen. I hope you feel that way about it.
[1:45:02] Amen. I'm not worried about well, I
[1:45:04] don't want so and so in there. I want as
[1:45:06] listen, my father commanded me that he
[1:45:10] wants his house full. Do you believe
[1:45:12] that? And these religious
[1:45:15] people, they made it into a thing to
[1:45:18] control the people. Amen. That's what
[1:45:20] the Samaritan dispute was about. And the
[1:45:22] Jews, they disputed because it was
[1:45:23] control. Amen. Because the Old Testament
[1:45:25] idea was, listen, we're going to control
[1:45:27] who can worship God. That's what the
[1:45:29] Catholics do. Well, if you want to come
[1:45:30] to God, you got to come through us. And
[1:45:33] denominations do the same thing. If you
[1:45:34] want to come to God, you got to come
[1:45:36] through us. And they're controlling the
[1:45:38] place of worship. They're controlling
[1:45:40] access to God. Amen. But Jesus come and
[1:45:42] said, "Listen, God's looking for people
[1:45:44] to worship him in spirit and in truth."
[1:45:47] Amen. In other words, worship's not
[1:45:49] going to give you access to God anymore.
[1:45:51] God's going to give you access to true
[1:45:53] worship by his spirit. Amen. There's a
[1:45:56] place that you and I can come today. If
[1:45:58] we're in jail like Paul and Silas, if
[1:46:00] we're in the worst trial of our life, if
[1:46:02] we're in a hospital, we don't have to go
[1:46:04] find an intercessor. We don't have to
[1:46:06] look for some priest. We have the life
[1:46:08] inside of us today. We've got rivers of
[1:46:11] water coming out of us. Amen. Listen, if
[1:46:14] you've got rivers of water coming out of
[1:46:16] you today, then why would you go
[1:46:18] thirsty?
[1:46:24] Amen. Friends, it's the same thing as
[1:46:25] Isaac. The well's the same, the water's
[1:46:27] the same, God's the same, the promise is
[1:46:29] the same. Amen. But we let hurt, we let
[1:46:32] problems, we let things get in the way
[1:46:35] because the enemy wants to control your
[1:46:37] access to God. But God's, you know, I'll
[1:46:41] say it this way. God's giving you
[1:46:42] unlimited access. Amen. You don't need a
[1:46:44] Wi-Fi password. You don't need to get a
[1:46:46] special Listen, it's paid for. Amen. You
[1:46:49] have unlimited access to God today
[1:46:51] through his word if you'll just take him
[1:46:53] at his word and you'll believe it.
[1:46:57] Amen. It's in the presence of God.
[1:46:59] That's where her situation changed.
[1:47:02] Amen.
[1:47:04] Wasn't what she had been taught. It
[1:47:07] wasn't her
[1:47:08] ideas. In that presence, it dissolved
[1:47:11] every doubt, dissolved every tradition.
[1:47:13] It scattered every idea of her own.
[1:47:15] Amen. It changed her life. It turned her
[1:47:19] mess into a message. Amen.
[1:47:23] So for us today, I want to ask you for
[1:47:25] for each of us, when was the last time
[1:47:27] we really had an encounter with God like
[1:47:31] that? And and I'm not talking about come
[1:47:33] to church here and here in the pre.
[1:47:34] That's good. That's fine. You're
[1:47:35] supposed to do that. I'm glad you come
[1:47:36] today. Uh what I would do, what I'm
[1:47:39] doing wouldn't work out real well if
[1:47:40] nobody showed up.
[1:47:42] But I'm not just talking about come to
[1:47:44] church. Amen. Or even listen to tape.
[1:47:47] When was the last time you got down in
[1:47:50] your own closet?
[1:47:54] Help us out, Lord. Listen. Jesus said,
[1:47:56] "If you'll seek God in secret, your
[1:47:59] father will reward you openly." Amen.
[1:48:02] When was the last time you really got
[1:48:04] down and just drew from the presence of
[1:48:07] God? Listen, the presence of God is not
[1:48:09] just I felt him or I had it. It can be.
[1:48:12] But to know that sacred listen when
[1:48:14] Jacob come into that presence, that's
[1:48:16] why he built that well there. There was
[1:48:18] a ladder there. Jacob's ladder. Amen. It
[1:48:21] ascended and descended to heaven. Amen.
[1:48:23] And he woke up. He said, "I didn't even
[1:48:25] know God was in this place." This is the
[1:48:28] house of God.
[1:48:30] How many times do we come into church or
[1:48:32] we go through things in our own life and
[1:48:34] we fail to remember God's presence in
[1:48:37] our lives?
[1:48:39] Amen. Going down the road, how many
[1:48:42] times we're going down the road, maybe
[1:48:43] you're in the car by yourself or
[1:48:44] something and just pray in your car.
[1:48:48] Amen.
[1:48:50] You cultivate being in the presence of
[1:48:51] God. Like Abraham cultivated the land he
[1:48:54] was in. Amen.
[1:48:57] Well, I want to I want to I want to have
[1:48:59] a closer walk with God. Oh, you draw
[1:49:01] nigh unto God.
[1:49:05] I'm now I'm preaching myself, too. You
[1:49:07] don't all have to feel bad for just
[1:49:08] yourselves. Amen. I'll feel bad for me
[1:49:11] and you can feel bad for you.
[1:49:14] Amen. I We find
[1:49:16] ourselves cumbered and and drawn astray
[1:49:19] and things. That's because we're not
[1:49:21] putting the Lord first. Amen. Amen. If
[1:49:24] we would put the Lord first. Let me let
[1:49:26] me just say it this way. I believe that
[1:49:27] eternal life is living for others. Amen.
[1:49:29] Amen. I now this is not a hard and fast
[1:49:32] this I'm going to take my liberty here
[1:49:33] for a second. Amen.
[1:49:36] I apologize. I'm I'm just I feel like
[1:49:38] I'm all over the place.
[1:49:40] I find for me, and your mileage may
[1:49:44] vary, when you're busy helping other
[1:49:48] people with their struggles, your own
[1:49:51] struggles don't seem so bad. True.
[1:49:53] statement.
[1:49:55] Is that all right? I think most of the
[1:49:58] time that's the case. I'm not marginal
[1:50:00] marginalizing what you're going through
[1:50:01] or where you're at or whatever. Amen.
[1:50:03] But listen, if you seow life, you're
[1:50:06] going to reap life. Where you going to
[1:50:07] sew life at? In other people, amen.
[1:50:11] Listen, if I get sick, you know what I
[1:50:12] do? I start praying for people that are
[1:50:14] sick.
[1:50:15] Because you're sewing life. Amen. You
[1:50:18] remember things that maybe you and it's
[1:50:20] shaking the roots. It's causing you to
[1:50:23] be aware of things you weren't aware of.
[1:50:26] Amen. That trial can destroy you or it
[1:50:28] can bless you. Amen. Amen. And I find
[1:50:31] the more you busy yourself being
[1:50:34] Christlike and and putting other people
[1:50:37] Amen. not thinking for the things of
[1:50:39] yourselves but other people's things
[1:50:40] like the Bible said. If you'll do that,
[1:50:44] you'll you'll live closer to God. Amen.
[1:50:46] Most of the things that you struggle
[1:50:48] with, that bother you, that you carry
[1:50:50] around, that you pack around, that bo,
[1:50:52] they they they they seem lighter all of
[1:50:54] a sudden. I'm not promising you a life
[1:50:57] absent of burdens. But I am promising
[1:51:00] you that his yoke is light. Yes. Amen.
[1:51:03] If you'll yoke up with him, his yoke is
[1:51:06] easy and his burden is light. Amen.
[1:51:10] So, I want to encourage you today. Amen.
[1:51:12] God is the same. And the best thing you
[1:51:14] can do if you want to live closer to God
[1:51:17] is just start it's like uh you know it's
[1:51:20] like u years ago when I was working at a
[1:51:22] place you know I different people go
[1:51:25] through different things but you know I
[1:51:26] used to pray for the sick at work. Amen.
[1:51:28] I don't res I don't resign that for just
[1:51:30] something at church. Amen. Let me say
[1:51:33] that. Okay. Let me throw this out here
[1:51:34] real quick. I'm I'm I'm coming to a head
[1:51:36] here. Well, you you ever get on the
[1:51:38] phone with somebody and they're going
[1:51:40] through something and how many times
[1:51:42] you've been like, "Well, that sounds
[1:51:43] really bad. I'll pray for
[1:51:44] you." We You don't actually You hit the
[1:51:47] button now.
[1:51:48] Amen. Well, I I'll I'll pray for you.
[1:51:51] And you hang up the phone and you go get
[1:51:53] your Whopper and you get your Baja
[1:51:55] Blast. You go on with your life and you
[1:51:57] totally forget to pray for him half the
[1:51:59] time. Amen.
[1:52:01] All right. Well, I'm not a Catholic
[1:52:04] priest, but confession is good for the
[1:52:05] soul. Listen, I've done that before. I
[1:52:08] caught myself doing I I had somebody
[1:52:09] call me up, thank you so much for
[1:52:11] praying for me about that. And I
[1:52:12] thought, oh, dear Lord Jesus. I didn't
[1:52:14] even pray for it.
[1:52:17] Well, I'm glad you got an answer. And I
[1:52:19] felt bad. Well, and you should. You
[1:52:21] shame on you.
[1:52:24] You know what you do? Here's how I fix
[1:52:25] it. You know what you do when you're on
[1:52:26] the phone with them? Listen, I'm going
[1:52:27] through this. Let's pray right now.
[1:52:30] Let's pray together. Let's Let's talk to
[1:52:33] You know what? go do the thing that you
[1:52:36] should do. Amen. I know that sounds
[1:52:37] simple, but I'm I'm making this point
[1:52:39] for a reason. There's so many times we
[1:52:41] don't just pray right there. And if we
[1:52:43] would pray, the presence of God would
[1:52:44] come down. Amen. How many times it
[1:52:46] happens, you're just talking to some
[1:52:47] maybe out there in the vest of people
[1:52:49] after church or something and you and
[1:52:51] you you take a moment and you if you
[1:52:53] would just pray, God would just come
[1:52:55] down and move. Amen. Don't put on the
[1:52:57] pastor or the preacher. Amen. Take time
[1:52:59] to seek God. Seek him while he can be
[1:53:01] found. Amen. There's a blessing there
[1:53:04] that you're missing out on if you're not
[1:53:07] doing that. Amen. God bless you. Stand
[1:53:08] to your feet today with joy. Amen. Not
[1:53:12] with heaviness of heart, not as a
[1:53:14] burden. Listen, I I love getting to pray
[1:53:16] for people. Amen. Because I love seeing
[1:53:19] answers to prayer. How about you?
[1:53:22] Listen, if you're a Christian, you live
[1:53:23] for it. Amen. You live to see God's will
[1:53:25] come to pass in their lives. Amen.
[1:53:30] Jesus, you know, he goes and he prays
[1:53:34] for this woman. His disciples come
[1:53:35] afterwards, says, "Look, listen, you
[1:53:37] ain't you ain't got nothing to eat." He
[1:53:39] said, "My meat or my food is to do the
[1:53:42] will of him that sent me." Amen. That's
[1:53:45] what sustains the Christian.
[1:53:48] You could go through trials. You can go
[1:53:50] through problems, but you know you're
[1:53:51] where God ordained you to be. You know
[1:53:53] there's a promise there. You know that
[1:53:55] if you you will reap if you faint not.
[1:53:58] You will not faint. You'll reap if you
[1:54:00] labor. If you're not weary. Amen. If
[1:54:02] you'll hold fast. You believe that
[1:54:04] today? I don't know what each person
[1:54:06] here's going through today. But just for
[1:54:08] a moment, I want you to
[1:54:11] pray. And maybe for your situation,
[1:54:14] maybe maybe for the person next to you,
[1:54:15] maybe you know what they're going
[1:54:16] through that I don't. Amen. Maybe pray
[1:54:18] for that person. I want you just to pray
[1:54:20] each one for just a moment for your your
[1:54:22] need or for each other. Pray for the
[1:54:24] pastor. Pray for this church. Let's join
[1:54:26] together and believe that God would
[1:54:29] magnify his presence in a greater way.
[1:54:35] Father, we just
[1:54:36] pray for that, oh God, that you would
[1:54:40] move in a greater way. That your
[1:54:42] presence would be we would be more
[1:54:45] aware. Lord, you promised you'd never
[1:54:46] leave or forsake us, but we let things
[1:54:49] get in the way. Pray today, Lord. May
[1:54:52] every
[1:54:53] distraction, may may all the confusion,
[1:54:57] may all the things that we've placed in
[1:54:58] the way, may we just push it aside. May
[1:55:01] we just open up the well today. May we
[1:55:04] allow you to come and to flow freely in
[1:55:08] this
[1:55:08] place. Father, for the different needs
[1:55:11] that are presented here today, Lord, we
[1:55:13] know they're important to you. It was a
[1:55:15] you it you had a need to ghost by
[1:55:19] Samaria that day for one woman. I
[1:55:21] believe there was a need here today for
[1:55:23] the word of the Lord to to help a
[1:55:25] person. Lord, we're not all here by
[1:55:27] happens. We're not here just to fulfill
[1:55:29] a religious obligation like those men of
[1:55:32] old in Jerusalem or Samaria. But we
[1:55:35] we've
[1:55:36] tasted we've seen that the Lord is good.
[1:55:38] And we
[1:55:39] desire to behold your beauty, to see you
[1:55:42] magnify yourself in a greater way, to
[1:55:44] see answers to prayer. Lord, there might
[1:55:46] be some things we've prayed about for a
[1:55:48] long time. Oh, but God, I pray today
[1:55:51] that there'd be some people that could
[1:55:52] walk out with an assurance that you are
[1:55:55] faithful to answer prayer. You're
[1:55:57] faithful to keep your word. Lord,
[1:55:59] there's people here today like that
[1:56:01] woman. They need a change in their life.
[1:56:03] They've tried to change it. They've
[1:56:05] tried to fix it. They've struggled. and
[1:56:08] they found like that woman. There's no
[1:56:10] there's no
[1:56:11] change. There's no help for them in what
[1:56:14] they're doing, Lord. But if they could
[1:56:15] just see past this this earthly realm
[1:56:20] for just a moment, and get in contact
[1:56:23] with that great eternal power, I believe
[1:56:25] you're here today, Lord.
[1:56:28] I believe there's things that maybe have
[1:56:29] laid in our lives for a long time that
[1:56:31] you can change right here today in this
[1:56:33] service. And the only thing stopping it
[1:56:36] is us believing that you can't do
[1:56:38] it. I pray every doubt now would would
[1:56:41] just dissolve. It would disappear right
[1:56:43] now. Father, bless these people. Do
[1:56:45] things in their midst, Father, that you
[1:56:47] des that you desire to do. It's your
[1:56:49] good will. It's your good pleasure to
[1:56:51] give us the kingdom. I pray you just do
[1:56:53] it now. Lord, be glorified in our midst.
[1:56:56] I thank you, Lord, for this church. I
[1:56:57] thank you for these people. These are
[1:56:59] your children. You paid a price for
[1:57:01] them, and they're dear to you, Lord. And
[1:57:04] we believe that. We embrace that. We We
[1:57:06] believe that about each other today.
