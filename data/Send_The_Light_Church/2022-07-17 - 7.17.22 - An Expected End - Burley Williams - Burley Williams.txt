prayer once again thank you lord just for all the things that went into this building lord and still are going into this building lord i praise would give our offerings to you lord let us not just do

cheerful heart lord because this is your household we want to give back to your household because you've been so good to us as our brother said you provide every need lord and the money that you've

lord just have your way in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen thank you brother brother john i know his grace that i wake up and he gives us uh the day to enjoy in him amen amen i don't want to enjoy the day without him it can become a habit and then before you know it he's further away than where he really wants to be which is the center of our life well praise the lord that the doors are open we can meet together as brothers and sisters in christ to worship as a family and uh we we we wish the rest of the family was here today uh but we're grateful for our live stream for those who are able to live stream and uh we know that god is gonna bless us today because god has sent his servant with a word just for us in this season amen now we had it scheduled actually for last sunday but you know what it just wasn't the perfect time of the lord amen that makes today even more special because we have confidence that we are the perfect will of god being here hearing this word and i'm just excited for what the lord is going to bring us and let's just be in deep prayer for two things one is that god would bless our brother with the right things for us personally and then two that we would receive revelation of what's being said amen those two are the like the most important things for making this the type of service that god wants us to have i believe he's here you brought him here you could tell in your worship you could tell in your praise that he's here today and i'm expecting him to do great things amen amen uh brother burley comes from south carolina he's a veteran he's been uh been through many battles and uh he is he is a he's a mighty a valiant soldier in the kingdom there's no turning back he's pressing forward and he just loves the opportunity to help god's people so let's just get behind the word as our brother comes to ministers let's sing uh only believe only believe so good to see my wife here today make it amen [Music] all things are possible only believe [Music] all things are possible only believe [Music] lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe what do we do after we believe lord i receive lord i received all things art possible lord i received lord i received lord i received all things are possible lord i received jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible jesus is here jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible jesus [Music] amen and now brother burley's here amen amen praise the lord god should i see you when i saw brother the first time i saw him i couldn't believe how good he looked make yeah it's on here we need your help just a second this would be fine i reckon god bless you it certainly is good to be in the house of the lord it's been a long time since we've been up this way and uh thank you but we uh appreciate the opportunity tabernacle so tell them brother battle i can't remember the message uh i think it's uh what is the traction of the mountain you begin to talk about the each one on the radio hookup those involvement and those in a certain place they always say waiting on the coming of the little one amen so that's where we are in south carolina waiting on the covenant of the lord so we know god has a universal bride so we just thank god for his grace and mercy if you will let's turn into our bibles to romans chapter eight and uh we appreciate that john for allowing us to come romans chapter 8 we want to go to verse 35. and uh the scripture says who shall separate us from the love of christ tribulation or distress or persecution of famine our nakedness a pearl a sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter laying all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers no things present no things to come no height nor death no any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus so regardless of whatever we go through in daily life thrown down through the years whatever it is it's going to be in the scriptures right there amen amen paul named every one of them amen famine persecution distress pearl he named everything so whatever we go through you can find it right here in the scripture amen let us pray father we just want to thank you for the reading of your word we come before you in harmonies in our heart we ask you to pray to god jesus come and speak to the heart of your children we ask these things father in the name of jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated i also like to turn to the book of jeremiah chapter 29. and uh i think it's jeremiah 29 11. oh got the wrong yeah jeremiah 29 let's go to verse 11. for i know the thoughts that i think for toward you says the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end amen i would like to just uh take a subject from that verse of scripture to give you an unexpected end amen to give you and expect it amen amen i actually uh left my notes on that desk back but we'll just we okay to give you an expected end um the word expected uh is a real interesting word it's a word that means uh something to look forward to amen and it also means uh uh to uh regard the occurrence of something something other word you anticipating looking forward to so god telling the children of israel here that i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an unexpected end reading the scripture here uh about an expected end we got to look and build up on the situation that is taking place here to see why god is telling them this but we're going to go backwards for a moment and see how it comes up here in jeremiah 29 while the lord is saying this because right here in the scripture that we're reading this is a depressing time for the children of israel they're actually when god is using jeremiah through another servant to tell them this they're actually now there in babylon so that's what we want to uh just kind of build upon this so even though they're in such a depressing time god still to give them an expected end and i can be honest with you uh if you don't have no expectation in life you don't have an expectation in the things of god you will be a depressed person because so the things that is happening you see so many people falling away from the words of life it can get very discouraging and then if you yourself is not looking and having expectations you're going to be depressed and paul said i have no pleasure in people when they fall back paul didn't have no pleasure in those things me myself i hear these things all the time one thing you got to understand about the devil he makes sure negativity be displayed he makes sure negativity be heard and it's for the purpose to discourage the people that hear it but we're in the time brothers and sisters we got to understand prophecy a lot of negative things are happening gonna happen and gonna continue to happen but that has nothing to do with us the bible tells us we need to look up our redemption draw is not so when we're looking at the wrong things amen it'll pull your faith down it'll pull you down so we have to look at the right things because we got to understand the nature and the character of god let me tell you something friend god got no problem putting his children in prison god god don't have a problem having his children go to jail he got no problem putting them in fire he got no problem putting them in line and then that's that's the god we serve he got no problem doing it because the thing of it is he know that's a believer he know they're going to overcome they're going to come out of it can we say man because when god allowed daniel them to go into the lion then the the hebrew boy they go into a fire uh that god wasn't nervous god wasn't biting his fingernails wondering what they was going to do he wasn't wondering what was going to happen to job is joe going to overcome a matter of fact he was bragging on job amen he was telling satan when god told satan do you desire my servant job you got to understand the context of scripture actually what god was telling satan are you sure you want to mess with that one that's what god was telling because you remember god gave satan jokes credentials he said he switched evil he's a perfect ain't nobody like him so he was actually giving the devil a warning do you really want to mess with death you might want to go pick somebody maybe weak in faith but this one is not can we say praise the lord see you have to understand something brother and sisters uh god blacks on his bride god is not nervous wondering are you gonna fall or not that don't bother god because the prophet of god said god in this day and this time is to prove to the devil that the bride is not going to fall like eve have fallen so that is already a prophecy that's been spoken on the bride that she will not fall but people can look around and say but what is going on remember bride won't fall so it's people falling they're not bright come on see what the problem we got around the message you know people don't want to just tell it like it is but i'm just one of the preachers i just tell it like it is i don't worry about who get offended and so forth like that because the word is the word can we say praise the lord many people want to make excuses why people don't left the words of life i don't care what excuse that a person can try to bring me is just only one thing they were never born again because when you were born again you would never walk away from truth can we say ma'am and one thing i'm thankful brother sister i don't understand everything been preached i don't understand everything the prophet said but i believe it can be say amen i might can't explain it but i believe it can we say praise the lord amen that's why we say in this song only believe only believe we don't sing a song only understand only understand it's only believe only believe all things are possible because by us believing in having the right attitude god will give the revelation in the time and season that we need it do you believe that praise the lord let me tell you something brother sister i'm so confident of the things that god is doing today with the bride of jesus christ yeah we are human beings we go through things in life we go through ups and downs we go through trials but you got to realize something that's going to always be because we could never be perfected if we don't go through trial if we don't have trials can we say man trials is not designed to bring us down trials are designed to bring us up when we overcome those things can we say praise the lord now if you think about something you got to remember something brothers and sisters when the devil came to god uh i can't remember exactly the word the prophet used but it was more like uh it was i'm just kind of paraphrasing it was more like god and the devil matter of fact he called it make a deal it was a deal god and satan was making the deal the devil was trying to make a deal with god saying if you do this and do this i could cause joke to fall how job walking around on earth minding his business he don't have a clue god in the devil is talking about him he's just minding his business right but then when satan came you got to remember he asked the devil you know where you come from he said i come to and fro going up and down in the earth what we think the devil was doing walking around seeking who he can devour but the scripture says the devil does not amen uh you know the scripture in peter he only comes but to kill steal and destroy look at the scripture that's the only thing satan got in mind kill steal and destroy he ain't got nothing else in mind but dead because he knows his time is short man that's why the demons when they come up to jesus christ they said come in to torment us before the time and i like and i like how the prophet put it is you come to the uh term before the time because we know that day is coming they know it's an appointed time they are going to be tormented so they want to do all they can do now to try to take people to where they're going amen but you notice uh when when it comes to job and the lord having that conversation what's so interesting now you know the devil and we think we got trials whenever you think you're really going through something just go read the book of job the things that happened in job life it wasn't one once something happened this week and then five months past something that's happened no it all happened in one day back to back joel couldn't even couldn't even never come and tell him your children dead he didn't even get enough chance to even think what happened in this then i'll say another one called message after message after message but in all of that job did not blame god i get nervous when people blame god that that scares me because let me tell you something you can't blame god for nothing because god don't make mistakes everything he do is perfect everything he say is perfect god does not make mistakes we do can we say amen and it's a saying that i always use myself i never ask god why right right this me i never asked god why you doing this to me i don't do things like that whenever i go through something i ask the lord what are you trying to show me because evidently he's trying to show me something because sometimes people be asking why why why you get to a place you start doubting god can we say praise the lord now job i'm so thankful how that uh job remember the devil coming back and forth back and forth to job and then all of a sudden satan seemed that he couldn't shake him but he said but what would a man do for his own life skin for skin now he had to go attack joe's boy they were getting more and more intense couldn't get him through his wife couldn't get him through death of his children and so forth like that but now he said what would a man do for his own life but here's the thing brother and sister satan is so smart he told god i i can't do nothing to this man cause you got a hedge around him satan was so aware of that i cannot touch this man as long as that hedge is there that's why we know the devil can't do nothing to none of us unless god permits it but you got to remember something the devil still got to go he'll still try to go past permission because he's the devil god told him not to take joe's life but he still tried it can we say amen so but this is what i want you to catch god move the hedges say all right satan there he goes sometimes i think we overlook what's taking place in that situation the hedges the devil knew he couldn't go over them so god moved him when god moved him it gave satan the open season can we say man to do whatever he wanted to do to job but this is what you need to catch job still never cursed god when god satan knew those hedges was protection so when they was moved he went right in let me tell you something friends god has now in this day and time removed the hedges from the bride and i'm going to explain what i mean about that because as long as the hedges is there the devil couldn't get to him but job was able to whip the devil without god's help come on now i hope y'all catching what i'm saying when god moved the hedges the devil had could do whatever he wanted to do to job but it didn't make joke fall he joe literally whipped the devil without god's help can we say man and that ought to be the same thing see you and me our hedge is our comfort zones long is everything's going right the way we think it's supposed to be we feel so strong and so protected that we're just really just on our mountain high that's protect that's hedges when everything is going right can we say man but then when things start going wrong what's going on what's going on no i'm here to tell you we by the grace of god by knowing the word is in you knowing what to do with the world you still either with the devil even if you're not anointed you don't have to be anointed to whip the devil you just got to know what the word says to whip the devil can we say praise the lord like the prophet of god amen he said one time he dropped the children off at school amen and when he dropped them off the devil came right to his conscience the devil came to his conscience and said this jesus he's nobody no different than billy ground or r robinson he said he's like a man in their day he was a people began to know him he had some kind of great following he said this jesus is no different than oral robinson and then the prophet said you that is speaking to my conscience he said well who is it that the prophets talked about way back thousands and hundreds of years ago and it came to pass he began to just tell him the word who was it then he said now who he promised that he was going to give me the people of the holy ghost in this day and the prophet said and i got it he said and i got it and he said when he began to tell the devil those things he said then he left he wasn't anointed but he whipped the devil in a conscious battle and that's what so many people follow is the greatest battles fought in the mind they're falling in their mind amen he wasn't even anointed a conscience battle battle in the conscience and he said satan he said then he left amen that's why i make the statement that i made when you know what the word says whether you are anointed or not you can still whip the devil can we say amen go back to the message to be certain of god that's why when you're going through something in life he said the prophet will you don't turn over every stone in your life and god still don't move he said that's when you got to be certain of god and ain't got nothing to do with feelings emotion in sight it got nothing to do with that it got to do where is your faith in your faith in the promises of god what he had promised that he was going to do that's where our faith would be amen let me tell you if we was anointed every day if we felt god presence every day we would be a bunch of lazy christians you would be a bunch of we will because you'll be so used to it used to just relax and lay back god don't do it like that that's why sometimes you go you can go months you can go several months seven months feel no anointing huh but what keeps you going is faith because faith has no feelings or emotions what keeps you going i love the lord i know i love the lord i know he's with me because he said he would never leave me nor forsake me even though you might feel forsaken the devil tried to get you to think that but your faith in the word no god promised he would never leave you that's exactly right can we say praise the lord god is still here amen god is still doing the same thing that he already done but we get our eyes on the wrong things so many times amen i want you to do do me a favor let's turn back i want to show you something we're going to build up to jeremiah chapter 29. let's go to jeremiah chapter 21. i hope you ain't saying why this fella coming out pretty hard no i preach like this all the time i've been sending the lord 35 years and i love him and i got no desire to go back into the things of this world it ain't even there came and said praise the lord i was talking to a guy and uh he some guy had used profanity and i said brother i said listen friend i said i don't use that type of language i said it's been 30 over 30 something years for stuff like that come out of my mouth people get shocked at you what i don't believe based on what you believe it's what i believe it's not based on what somebody else believes about me or think about me is what i believe can we say man people don't people see you got sometimes people because they can't live a certain level in their life they they want to make you think you got to stay down and where they are no you don't have to i believe in a god that brings total deliverance can we say amen that's what i believe in but you go like the prophet said some people want to be halfway christians he's the god i don't want you to be a halfway christian but some people do but i i want to be a all the way christian can we say praise the lord let me tell you something friends the devil uh there's something very interesting i've just been reading and i have to keep going over it's a question announces how the prophet began to talk about how the devil tried to trap a person he said one thing about satan amen if he can plant something in your life if you ain't got the holy ghost but if he can plant something in your life that is wrong but then keep you in church keep you going to church but still with no holy ghost he said that's what the devil will try to hold you until you die because he said he know you're not born again he still got you but he'll still let you be religious until you die see a lot of things people don't understand about satan too now when it comes to somebody in this message i'm just gonna be flat honest with you when it comes to somebody in this message the devil is more interested than you backsliding then killing you yeah all right that's true well let me explain it to you satan they did why then all of the problems sampson called them samson calls them why did they just immediately kill them when they got him they could've but they just put his eyes out he wasn't more victory to them walking around defeated than them just killing them devil is the same way the devil get more glory out of a backslider than just killing somebody he would rather have somebody that don't left the words of life still walking around in a defeated life so he can punt his finger to make sport just like they did samson say look at them they was in the message so many years they failed so the message must be wrong the devil get more glory out of that can we say praise the lord i'm just trying to be honest with you friends all this negativity the devil got a bunch of trophies walking around amen they thought oh since i left this message and the bible don't come a new book to me i said that's a lie when you left this message the bible become veiled to you this message would open our eyes to the bible but the devil got people so deceived now my goodness but you know god's gonna have a bride yes sir it's going to be a rapture it's going to be a bride and it's going to be a very few are you with me amen praise the lord now jeremiah 21 let's go to verse 1. now i want to explain some things about god first of all we know is not going to compromise with his word for nobody amen it just it ain't going to happen he ain't going to change his word for nobody make no difference how much he loves us he ain't going to change his word amen but if you i want to show you god is so merciful that even when people fall but yet they steal his elect they're going to pay for what they've done but god is so merciful he's going to bring him back some kind of way but they got to go through things he will bring them back we know the pattern of scripture how that the children of israel natural journey is our spiritual journey that's why it's the types and shadows we always go back and we follow types and shadows to see how god done things then we have an understanding of what he's doing today and i'm so thankful like the prophet said if god saved one man one way the next man that come up on the same basis god have to do it again i'm thankful that he does that now the children of israel they constantly in the time of jeremiah jeremiah i know why they didn't like jeremiah because jeremiah always rebuked them but he couldn't he had no choice but to keep rebuking them how many of you know how old jeremiah was in jeremiah chapter one jeremiah was around when god called jeremiah if you do your research on chapter jeremiah chapter one jeremiah actually was the son was around the same time with josiah that was on the scene at the same time jeremiah josiah daniel and the hebrew boy when god dealt with them they was just children they were not old men daniel chapter one uh meshach wrapped in the bishop which is not their real name that's the name babylon gave them right daniel that was brother branham said in the message daniel 70 weeks he said they was around the age of 14. now you go back and read daniel chapter one it said uh the king asked for certain children of the children of israel that goes to show you they were just children a lot of time we read daniel we think that oh daniel oh no when you get up in daniel chapter 8 and chapter 9 daniel is an old man but in the beginning he was a child no more than 14 years old josiah he become a king eight years old his eyes become open when he was 26 years old all of these things god showing god was dealing with children it wasn't old he got them while they were young but as they grew up they gave they gained wisdom amen now jeremiah was just a child that's why he uh god would tell jeremiah don't be afraid of their faces because he was just a child timothy was a young man paul said don't let them despise your youth i try to preach these things and let young people go i got something for you you ain't got to be old waiting to get old to be used by god god can use you when you're young amen so jeremiah all he can do is rebuke because why the children of israel had went away from the word of god start serving other gods jeremiah had no choice but to rebuke them because that was god wanted to tell them amen are you with me now when god does something and don't spoke something prophesied something can't nothing change it they knew out of all of this uh preaching that jeremiah was doing they knew the king of babylon was coming amen but i want to read something to you let's go to jeremiah 21 and the word came unto jeremiah from the lord with king zedekiah sent unto him pastor the son of melchio and zephaniah the son of messiah the priest saying inquire pray thee of the lord for us see now they want jeremiah to pray for them he said for nebuchadnezzar king of babylon make his war against us it shall be that the lord would deal with us according to all his wonderful wondrous works that he may go up from us but now they wanted jeremiah to pray for them but they've been rejected in the word now they want mercy but they've been rejecting the word now watch this verse three then said jeremiah unto them dust shall you say to zedekiah thus says the lord god of israel behold i will turn my back the weapons of war that are in your hands wherewith you fight against the king of babylon against the child thens which besiege you without the walls and i will assemble them in the midst of this city now i know what god is telling them yo that nebuchadnezzar is coming but your weapons won't work against nebuchadnezzar because i'll make sure your weapons don't work praise the lord look out america bragging on that military right right i talked to a military guy one time he's uh the guy with the these apache helicopters and stuff and i talked to him i said i said i said who do we fear they said america we fear nobody they shared it with pride he said the only country that we might be a afraid of he said but not firepower he said manpower i said who is that he's in china he's because they got more and they armor than we do he said it'd be manpower and i was just sitting back to myself you just don't realize what's coming to america out of all her bragging she do on her weapons when god anoint russia to do what she's going to do it's going to be just like here in jeremiah time america weapons won't work when god anoints something to happen he's the one that stops it he's the one that starts it god is the one that does those things right because you got to remember they rejected the word of god god put it in nebuchadnezzar's heart to go down there and bring them captivity and the same thing going to happen today god's going to put it in russia hard to come over here and bomb america nobody can stop this it's gonna happen can we say amen remember russia putin them they just that symbol of a bear what does a bear do it hibernates but when it comes out of hibernation it devours and this barrier is coming out of hibernation starting to devour america gots it coming she got it coming and ain't nothing going to be able to stop her i don't care what kind of new weapons they get it does not matter the same thing happened to nebuchadnezzar the prophet said they built those big old walls then you could have chariot races go around and there was so much pride in their security but they didn't realize the needs of person went under the wall can we say man when god put something in somebody's heart it's going to take place let me tell you something friend sometimes god allow somebody to dislike you you could ask yourself i've never done unto this person why did they treat me like that why did they talk to me like that i don't understand what did i do you could even go try to talk to them please with you they still don't like you god allowed that to happen for a purpose and i guarantee you it is to get to you not them amen yes sir praise the lord it's exactly right remember in revelation he gonna put it in them hearts to hate the they'll agree with her a while but when god put it in the heart to hate them you can't change it exactly right said your weapons i would turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands in other words your weapons will not work when nebuchadnezzar come down there you think they now they told jeremiah to pray but look what jeremiah telling them they what they wanted to hear he said verse five listen what god telling israel and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm even in anger and in fear and in great wrath now jeremiah telling the children of israel that like whoo i don't know about you fred i don't want god fighting against me i don't want his wrath i want his mercy that's what i want his mercy amen now jeremiah telling them that they asked the brother for a prayer but they get a rebuke hey being a pastor that happens sometimes sometimes people say will you pray for me pastor i say what's the problem and then when they start telling me the problem i rebuke them because there's something that they don't done now you want me to pray for something you don't done that's why the bible say lay hands on the one suddenly because sometimes people want you to bless something that they doing wrong but they want you to pray and bless them right that's why i ask questions amen that's right i was in a situation when timing i was preaching overseas a lady come up to the altar and uh she said uh would you pray for me i said hmm what's the problem see i need you to pray for me and my friend it's okay what's the problem she said things just not right and i just need you to pray i said i felt funny i said uh what's wrong with her she oh it's him she asked her to get her to respond back she said him that's okay what's the what's the deal and then all of a sudden i just felt so funny and here i am this woman is standing in front of me we're standing in front of the pool pit and a pastor was behind the pulpit singing while we were having prayer and then all of a sudden she pointed at the pastor she said i hate him i said you hate who pastors that had his eyes closed and sang his heart out and didn't know he had a sheep he hated them i said sister you do need prayer i said you need a lot of prayer cause you got a problem then i found out later on oh i didn't pray for her friend because what it was god is god is good she was trying to get me to pray for her friend that is already married and them two trying to get married she was trying to get me to pray over an adulterous situation god is good so i pray for her soul not for her friend so i found out later i talked to the pastor i said i saw her he said what you mean she got a problem he's old brother she just mad at me she tried she said this man he's married and she's just trying to get me to marry them and i won't do it that's why she hated him the bible said lay hands on new ones suddenly that's why sometimes when people want you to pray for them you feel that little check it's best to ask questions because sometimes god can put you remember the prophet of god says this sometimes god can put something on somebody and because of you praying you can take it off of him he said then you'll have to answer for it that's right i just believe what he said can we say amen praise the lord so you pray for me i said what's the problem i want to see let's go into detail what we need to pray about what's going on let me tell you sometimes people are just like children adults you know when you got children in the home let's say you got three or five and uh when one of the children gets out of fellowship with mom and dad they don't done something wrong their conscience is guilty they know their conscience is guilty but then all of a sudden they want something from mom or dad that child will not approach mom and dad themselves they will find out which sibling still has a relationship ain't done nothing with mom and dad they'll go to the sibling and say would you go ask mom and dad can we go here and do this they'll take the child that got a fellowship with mom and dad and then they'll go ask him because they got no fellowship you got people just like that when they know they backslid and got no fellowship with god they'll look for somebody they know they can talk to god got fellowship with god they say will you pray for me because they got no relationship with them when we all ourselves personally ought to have a relationship with him we can go straight through the throne ourselves without condemnation that's the way it's supposed to be praise the lord amen man my daughter my younger one she used to give him she used to give her brothers away it's just the way she'll just say she just said daddy they told me to ask you somewhere praise the lord let's keep going verse six he said i will smite the inhabitants of the city man and beast they shall die of a great pestilence and after what says the lord i will deliver zedekiah king of judah and his servants and the people and such as are left in the city from the pestilence from the sword and from the famine into the hands of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and into the hand of their enemies and unto the hands of those that seek their life he shall smite them with the edge of the sword he shall not spare them neither have pity nor have mercy and in this people thus shall thou say thus says the lord listen what god is telling them behold i set before you the way of life and the way of death notice god telling them everything he's going to do to them but it's their fault because they kept rejecting the word but listen what he tells them what he's going to do listen now he says this verse 8 again say this to this people thus says the lord behold i set before you the way of life and the way of death now god gonna tell them how they can live or how they're gonna die right he says he that abideth in the city shall die by the sword by the famine and by the passionate but he that goeth out and falls to the child deadens that beseech you he shall live and his life shall be on him to him for a prayer so now god said if you want to live you got to be in the hands of the enemy but if you stay here you're going to die right i'm going to show you something sometimes god will leave you in a bad situation to keep you alive amen amen i just let the scripture prove some of you like oh no about that one well the bible's full of those i could name the new testament within the old testament the bible's full of god got ways to keep you humble he got ways of doing it sometimes you might be something in your life you just can't get out of it it could be simply because god keeping it there to keep you humble the same as he done paul paul you remember paul i prayed to god three times he would not remove this from me and then he said paul my grace is sufficient for you so other words god kept that thorn in paul flesh he sent us enemy from the devil to buffet me in my flesh god son of devil to keep bothering paul in his flesh for what purpose to keep paul humble so god can put you in bad situations leave you there to keep you humble you can pray all you want you to try to get out of it god said no until i get what i want out of you i will not release this problem can we say amen even paul even though god keeps him humble you keep reading paul's teachings paul knew amen at one time paul everything was going good paul even said himself though i desire to glory i won't be a fool otherwise paul says i'm feeling pretty good about myself i want to lift myself up a little bit he said i desired that but let me humble myself because i ain't going to be a fool oh i wish preachers in the message would catch that revelation they want to walk around some pride everybody love them want to tell them how good they preach walk around where their chest all stuck out that preacher's on his way down god's supposed to get the glory and you can't hide it i don't care who the preacher is you can't hide it when you got them prior spirits on you you cannot hide pride you know one thing people can't hide pride for me i'm gonna tell you why cause i used to have pride real bad oh i did i used to have it real bad that's why it's hard to hide it for me i can look at some most of the preachers i look at him sometimes i know what's gonna happen to you god gonna bring you down that servant of god cause he did it to me you gotta humble yourself god does some things to me did i like it no i sure didn't but i loved him i always one of my favorite saying people said how do you know god love you i said man the way he beats me you know i know he loved me he corrects me the things he do i said no he loves me because if he didn't love me he wouldn't even care to correct me that's right listen what he says verse 10 for i have set my face against the city for evil not for good says the lord it shall be given into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire and touching the house of the king of judah says hear you the word of the lord o house of david thus says the lord execute judgment in the morning deliver him that is fall out of the hand of the oppressor let my fury go out like fire and burn that nun can quench it because of the evil of your doings god said i'm doing this it's because of the evils of your doings this is why this is happening amen all of this is leading up to jeremiah chapter 29. i'm trying to show you i got i'm going to show you in a moment why god is turning for you could have an unexpected end so now let's just flip to that let's go back to jeremiah chapter 29. you remember jeremiah went through a lot one came down and told them we're not going to be in there in those 70 years we'll be down there so many years and then uh like how the prophet said jeremiah didn't even argue jeremiah just said amen because he knew what god told him was true i like that if you know what god tells you is true why argue with somebody i don't even argue about the message right i don't especially the ones that don't laugh it they want to well do they do that that's it what are you talking to me for oh i get some i get a i got a nasty email they want them to tell me what they name i get these little emails i don't even know how to get my email address they be texting emailing me you preaching this false william browning stuff and blah blah blah yadda i just text them back and uh i text them back and i emailed them back you know i just returned the email they said you need to repent of the thing that you're preaching i just said uh well all right i just got in i just took the scripture in the book of acts and when it says uh when gamalia said you may be refrained from touching these men he said if this is of god it'll come to knock he said but if it's of god you're gonna find yourself fighting against god so i i paste that scripture to them and i said won't you have a little bit of gamalia sense amen i said you ain't even got to mail your sense i said this message is not of god it will fall but it happened and it won't so they're fighting against god have a little camellia since and i told them i don't know who you are i don't care to know who you are i said but i ain't got no time for you going back and forth this message is real to me if it ain't real to you fine go right on and the question i asked them i said you don't left the message why you keep following my sermons you must like what i'm preaching come on won't you just go you're gonna go go i refuse to debate with somebody about the message i refuse it's different if they question me wanting to know something maybe confused i i'll sit and i'll go back and forth with them but once i see that little spirit they really just want to debate don't really want to learn nothing i have no time for it i just don't have no time for it i go right back what paul said if they want to be ignorant let them be ignorant and i'll move right apart move on praise the lord you know some of us become superheroes say oh maybe that pastor that it was on to hurt them i think i can help him let him come to me oh go right over here hero go right on the head and when you get there and try to be the hero then you're going to find out you play with fire you get burnt i don't try to be no superhero no praise the lord that's just i'm just as honest the person you probably ever with me that's why when people try to come to my church i let them come three times after that third time i said who you where you from who who you pastor where you come from oh why do you leave that church huh did you leave right are you in good standing no no bad blood huh i asked questions they'd be getting mad too that let me know they wrong when they get mad but i just came on i just wanted to come and hear the word of god and no no that's fine but i'm asking you some questions you ain't doing it wrong you've got no problem answering the question that's the fail that's the same way i feel about boys when they want like a man daughter if they want to like a man daughter they got no problem they may ask some questions right right if they got problem the man asking questions he's up to no good he need to go because one thing about christianity when you got nothing to hide you ain't got no problem nobody asking you questions they don't bother you say what do you want to know huh but now sometimes people get too personal to them nosy people you have to reboot those that's exactly right let me get back to this and in jeremiah chapter 29 you got to catch this now they are in babylon they've been carried away they are down there in babylon if i could paint a picture to you if you could just think about a sad moment that you don't had in your own life of depression distress don't just can't even find a way out if you can just think of that and magnify that a thousand times it'll put you here in babylon now they've been taking the tablet the temple has been burnt down they've been taken out of jerusalem they've been taken away from their homes now they in babylon think of the misery the everybody walking around now sad then you can hear some in the crowd jeremiah tried to warn us jeremiah tried to warn us but then some yeah yeah yeah we should have listened and the children mama daddy why are we here why are we here did the parents need to look at each other we should have listened to the prophet we should have listened to the prophet daniel right there in that group his family all of them now in babylon now the regrets listen to the prophet it's going to be the exact same thing today those that don't left this message if they don't no change in their life somewhere around when things start going next we should have listened to the prophet the biggest problem i find around the message myself is many don't have a revelation where the prophet is brother branham is not the message he's the messenger oh i know the quotes well the messenger and his message is one that's exactly right but the message is still christ christ is the message amen he's a messenger so what song you don't really got messed up uh i didn't come here to preach you brother branham i come to preach you what god gave him and i preached that that's what i preached because now let me tell you it's a shame son can tell you more about brother branham personal life what he liked didn't like where he went and then go they can tell you more about that than what he preached that's bad that is really really bad me knowing brother brandon's personal life is not going to get me to heaven but me knowing having a revelation why god sent him and the message god sent him that's going to get me there but it's so mixed up today and it don't got so bad to some places you go if you don't say the prophet say a thousand times you're really not preaching the message it should not be that way if we study this message you'll know if a preacher is preaching if you study this message what did he say the prophet said and the prophet didn't say you will know because you studied it yourself amen that's right can we say amen but it's so mixed up today to them become in many places idolatry they idolize the prophet i don't idolize brother branham i love brother branham i believe everything i enjoy i it's any personal thing i enjoy it all but i know where my balance is at i know what he preached i know god's son him but i do know this the prophet even told us now the bride has a ministry today and that does not mean we're going to say something different than what he said no we're going to say the exact same thing that's been said can we say praise the lord but it's so scooped up today but now we're in the age in a time of balancing and i'm not saying i'm gonna i'm the great hero to try to balance things that is not i'm not nowhere saying that but what i'm saying is i believe all mature ministries that god has in this message gonna catch that balance and that's what they're bringing to the congregation that's what i believe can we say amen praise the lord amen but he said i wish i just would listen to that prophet but look where it got you know when you really depressed distressed just to hear a little bit of good news excites you just a little bit so now they're in a situation and jeremiah is in jail and they in babylon but something efficient that happened let's go to verse 1. now these are the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem to the residue of the elders which was carried away captive and to the priests and to the prophets and to all the people who nebuchadnezzar had carried away captain from jerusalem to babylon now jeremiah is going to write a letter to send to them while they in babylon of course jeremiah couldn't take it he gonna give that letter to somebody to send it to him then he said after that jihad came the king and the queen and the eunuch and the princes of judah in jerusalem and the carpenters and the smith were departed from jerusalem now verse two it just threw it in there they're showing you who all else went on down to babylon but now it's gonna jump back to say amen i'm sorry verse 3. now if you i put it to you like the one thing the way the scripture is put verse 2 was thrown in there to show you how the rest of them went down but if you jump from one cha verse 1 to chapter 3 you'll catch the whole thing let's just go to verse 1 again now these are the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem or to the residue of the elders which was carried away captive to the priests to the prophets and to all the people whom nebuchadnezzar carried away captain from jerusalem to babylon now you read verse three by the hand of elisha so it's showing you who he gave the letter to the takedown to babylon the son of shaphan the sean of gemara the son of helicopter whom zelda king of judah sent unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar saying now verse 4 the people now and depressed distressed but now the word comes gather around jeremiah has sent us a letter could you just imagine the excitement don't happen now come on y'all jeremiah he he showed a letter this brother gonna read this letter what jeremiah said i told y'all we weren't gonna be there here long read it brother read it now they want to hear something good they ready to hear something good now oh we get ready i told you we're gonna y'all pack up it's time to go i told you god ain't gonna do us like this no way god's gonna all right brother read that letter read it they're excited but listen to the letter verse four thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel and to all that are carried away captive whom i caused to be carried away from jerusalem unto babylon now that i can see him yeah yeah come on come on come on verse 5. build your houses hey like re read it [Music] in captivity but go build a house that ain't good news that is not the news they wanted to hear that's the same thing like you and me sometimes god got you going through something it's certain news you want to hear and if it don't come the way you want it you don't want to hear it and we always want to hear something good i don't want no no i need to give some good but if god got something on your life or you don't cause god to bring something on your life you might want to get ready to hit rebuke because that's where it's going to be do y'all know why people sit in church tents let me tell you why sometimes people in in church tense let me tell you why you're doing that the reason why people do that when they tense in church the devil is battling them making them think he's talking to you about you he's playing this thing at you pastor i'm told in something that's what they yeah yeah yeah yeah they tense let me show you how to break that tension when you just can really realize wait a minute this brother don't know me i'm sure because i ain't even talked about john no more through text than a couple times on the phone just telling when i couldn't make it so when a person can really just accept wait a minute lord you talking to me yes you are then attention to leave then they bother to relax because they're no longer fighting they're receiving build you houses and dwell in them plant gardens and eat the fruit of them in captivity building the houses and planting gardens and fruit and fruits they get even more interesting verse six take your wives begat sons and daughters take wives for your sons give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that you may be increased there and not diminish they were so depressed they didn't even care for family relations but look what god is saying now i can take a sermon and preach on family affairs with that one scripture right there how do things happen through families and stuff i can take that one scripture right there by god's grace but look what god said god knew they were so depressed in this situation but he told them let the children marry but notice what he said so there'll be an increase there and not diminished the reason why god told him if you stop having relationships when the 70 years is old and you quit i ain't gonna have nobody to bring back to jerusalem so you gotta continue in captivity it gets even worse jeremiah they reading the letters of jeremiah they don't want to hear this listen what it says verse 7 seek the peace of the city whether i have caused you to be carried away kept it notice and pray unto the lord for it now god telling them to pray for babylon huh jeremiah you want me to pray for these people they got academy yep that's what jesus said bless them that curse you feed your enemy pray for them that's right for the usual it's the old testament it's all together it's working with our character you want me to pray for babylon pray for it amen sometimes you say do you pray for trump i have to scripture says it did you pray for obama yep i pray for scripture saying pray for your rule that's what you do what the scripture says you do whatever you want to do i pray for the man's soul i like when brother brandon pray for uh president uh is it the white one of them he prayed he wasn't kidding well it was another one he prayed for and i like how the prophet put it he said lord this one was a godly man he said but i pray for him to help him with his decision he's cause his decision affects us but what you got to understand about presidents they make no difference who gets in the office god knew who's going to be there before the foundation of the world and whoever he put there is to help fulfill prophecy [Music] oh down south boy i'll tell you know south is right it's pretty rough and south i couldn't write where the hard the heaviness of slavery was it's pretty rough still is oh yeah when obama come into office black people walking around with the chest stuck out huh but dude he was in office a little while you know that old crazy obama man look what he doing man look come on man i said well you just voted for him cause he was black you didn't study his life you didn't really study you just did it because he was black i said then you got what you voted for oh people don't like it did you get well the one thing you got to understand about politics they would tell you anything you want to hear to get you to vote for but once they get you vote for them they do whatever is in the agendas in their heart they just use you to get them in the office that's politics so who do you vote for none of them not a one of them they said what is your your your rights divorce that is my right that's one i don't even want i said i voted one time for jesus christ and i never lost because according to what the prophet of god said when they used a crooked machine to get candidates in an office you don't think they'll do the same thing today the machines is not the one that doing the voting anyway it's who god wants to put in the office he says in the book of daniel he can put up kings he set them down god does it all praise the lord yeah you come down south you want to hear some racism there's plenty of it down there still is you got just as much black people just as prejudiced white people it is bad oh yes it is in some areas it's pretty bad i was talking to a guy one time his prejudice i said why you don't like black peop i said uh i said i should hate you yeah but i don't i start trying to get along with you i said we didn't put you in change we didn't beat you we didn't sell you like cal i said you done all that to me and i'm trying to like you i said well i should hate you and he just said i never thought of that it's a spirit he said i never thought of that huh then i talked to the blacks people i said well that's a slavery ain't nothing new huh so yeah children is here with slaves that's it oh yeah ain't nothing what's up knew about that slave is all in the bible bro oh yeah it isn't oh ain't never thank you yeah i'm sure you did i said tell you something i said you didn't ask to come over here i didn't actually come over here but we're here i said everything is for a reason everything is for a purpose it's in god's hand amen because when you talk about a prophet first thing they say is he black so no he's a white prophet i said listen when it comes to the end of the day if he was the black prophet you still wouldn't believe because it's the word we believe not the skin amen it's the vessel that god wants to use for the word to come out of as you still wouldn't even believe you know you get all kind of questions now in young generation it's just distractions and uh uh i had one come at me said what color was jesus i knew it was coming i said well i said can you show me in the bible show me anywhere in the bible where god is interested for us to know what his color is listen give me one scripture that's you won't find nowhere in the bible he's interested for us to know what his color is he's interesting for us to know who he is i said he is the word i said but now if you really want to know what color god is i said whenever you run across a born-again believer whether it's spanish mexican italian african caucasian i said that's god's color that's because there's god dwelling in them if you want to know this colors praise the lord there's just so much nonsense you know it's all distractions they try to get you to lose your focus that's what all this stuff is but listen what he says verse eight god's just gonna just hammer it all he said but thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel let not your prophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you neither hearken to their dreams with you cause to be dreamed you see it was prophets down there that came to jerusalem god knew they were gonna still tell the people lives right it ain't gonna be no 70 years y'all just hold on a little bit longer maybe five years and four we'll be leaving out here trying to give people false hope but did you catch what he said don't even listen to the dreams you caused the dream you can get so depressed they have a dream of victory but that dream do not be of god but because you wanted it so bad the devil give you a dream that everything gonna be okay that's a dream you caused the dream that's what pressure depression can cause you to actually do but god has not given us a spirit of fear but all of this pressure could cause these reactions god knew that he knew that look how he deals with it verse 9 for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name i have not sent them said the lord verse 10. now really when you look at verse 10 you'll see why he told them not to listen to the prophecies prophets because they were going to try to let them know it ain't going to be no 70 years we're going to be out here before that because that's why i'm going to go back to it in verse 10 he said for thus saith the lord that after 70 years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good work toward you and causing you to return to this place notice now look what god is doing letting them know i'm not going to change my word you're going to be down in 70 years it just ain't going to happen you you brought this evil on yourself but notice he telling them stay there have children have families why now let's go to verse 11. for i know the thoughts that i have towards you says the lord thoughts of peace not an evil to give you an expected end the expected end is she telling them you got to keep moving on it's going to be hard you caused this but at least i want to let you know you're going to come out something that you can look forward to and i'm here to tell you out of all the things that are happening today this message is our expected end it let us know all this time is going to come people are going to fall away you're going to fall find liars you're going to find false prophets you know all of this got to happen around the message but god said i'm giving you an expected end there's going to be a rapture look up your redemption jaws now these things must be but you got to stay in your place and press on that's our in that's what god would tell us this morning you haven't i'm giving you an expected end yeah that's a lot of negative but don't look at it you got to press on don't know what time it is i do know what town i don't know what time it started what it was one more thing let me read something to you it comes from the message the ever present water from the rock i'm sure this is a familiar quote the prophet said when we die our souls would go under the altar of god where i was privileged to see a few mornings ago as you know in division where the bible speaks of our spirits will go to god who give it and our bodies shall return to the dust of the earth but someday when the scripture is fulfilled our spirits will be released from god we'll pick up the soul and the soul to the body and the power that will raise us up is right in us now we are now in heavenly places we are now in the power of the resurrection he said if there wasn't a law to that sons and daughters of god would create them a world out here go live a private life on it you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of god in you you've got power to do it god is omnipotent you just see what i mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence go live on it hallelujah there you are listen now that's what power is in the church now he said but it is controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of commandments it's a law of faith jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatever god will lead your soul to believe that is yours every place of the souls your feet can set upon by faith god gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you you see what i mean that power is controlled if you are a son of god you are a daughter of god that never leaves you it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there now notice he said the power is in you the a world a private i like how he said a private one and go live on it his body's controlled by a law so god is controlling that faith in us where we can go create that word because the time is not now so god that's all control that's what he said the faith whatever god will call you to believe but he said that power is actually in you i want to say something to you the power in you to create that world like the prophet said is in you but there's also a power in you to create the wrong world if you go to the message i want you to type in a quote i know johnny loves me just type that in i know johnny loves me it's a quote gonna come up and the court gonna come up of a little girl he gonna begin to talk about her he said that when she was a real young girl she had a heart condition he prayed for and god touched her but now she's older now he said now she got a different type of heart condition it was about a boy this girl got this boy left her and she and it was so devastating only thing she could say i know johnny loves me i know johnny loves me but this boy took off and went and married another girl and he said that he blamed it on his father that his father said but he told that girl he's just nonsense his dad is not saying he said the reason why that really that boy would never love you right he's cause if he'd love you right he wouldn't do such a thing as that but then he began to say he said what that girl did because of what happened she built the world around it she created a world a journey with another woman but she's still saying i know johnny loves me she created a world then he says as he began to talk to her he said some transaction happened between her and that boy only him and her would know god showed him i'm sure it was a vision he told him what it was but when he told her what they did he don't say what it was but when he told her it sparked her made her wake up because she know how could he have known that but he told her since you out of that world now he's i need you to look toward calvary so it took something supernatural to take place to say to her to make her break from that world now she could come out we create worlds and it'll take something supernatural god to strike us to get us to come out of them and there's all kind of worlds we create many times and we don't realize we did it let me name some of those worlds some worlds a woman can create against her husband and she could live in it and the husband don't have a clue because when you create worlds yourself you live in it all by yourself and far as you know everybody is wrong can't see what's going on in your life because it's your world like that little girl i know johnny loved it she couldn't see nothing else regardless you just couldn't see nothing else that was her world you could do the exact same thing so a lot of times people especially housewife can create a world especially always in the house seeing them walls and they can create a world then the devil can get them to create a world nobody appreciates me nobody know what i go on and what happened to me while i'm here in this house all they want to do is come home and eat and eat and do this and do this but they don't know what i go through daily they just don't know you keep thinking like that you begin to create a world amen amen that's right but then when that world is created then more things adds to that were unappreciated the devils start coming in they don't appreciate you look what you do look what you do and a lot of times the devil says look what you do and a lot of times you really i ain't trying to be funny everything you're doing is in zombie mode how many y'all know what zombie mode is i call it zombie mode you get around the hound you're moving function and just it's a zombie mode you don't create it that world and then when somebody try to talk to you while they talk to you you okay yes i'm fine because you don't got so satisfied in your little world you say you okay when you're not okay let me tell you something friends sometimes and there's gonna be a little strong statement but i'm just gonna have to be honest with you sometimes i think especially in marriage life if you ain't careful you can be telling lies when something is really really wrong with you your husband or your wife asks you are you okay and you say yes and you know you're not okay the best thing to say now if you're going through something but by faith you can see your way out of it it's all right to say i'm fine all is well it's okay but you know you just defeated you can't see no father then your hand and just tore up inside do not say you're okay don't don't do it just say no i'm not okay let's talk cause sometimes you say you okay i'm fine you sure yes okay are you ready do it look like something wrong with me i told you i'm fine okay then when you walk off the devil come back they didn't even keep talking to you to make sure you fine didn't get mad these are worlds you can create and you're mad because nobody want to come in your world because that's what you created that's why it's good to tell your wife i love you i appreciate you you might think i don't see what you do but i see what you do see when you're telling them that they don't create a world you're crushing it say i appreciate you especially so you know something you did the other week i forgot to tell you but i really appreciate you doing there they go oh you remember that they come out of that world oh how he is paying some attention then the devil goes what about that though yeah he ain't saying nothing about that and worlds a man can do the same thing come home all i do is work pay bills come in this house nobody appreciate me don't ask me how my day was nothing nothing they don't realize these lights are on water running they ain't even seeing none of that they don't know it you don't create it that world i'll show you how to break them worlds you say i thank god lord you were there to give me work and keep the lights on water i thank you for the work father lord i thank you amen because when pressure comes in the house everything comes out especially when it's financial children be taken about why are you in that shower so long you don't need all that water why you leave that light on see this expression pressure you ain't got to pay for it see you don't you don't got in that world now demorals we build them right and it's not good children be a world nobody i got no friends nobody don't want to be my friend well i'll be my own friend then i start getting into finding the wrong friends because they don't build that world i see it a lot on campgrounds youth camps warriors you see little groups of worlds all you got to do is account last five days just about two days you'll be able to see the worlds because whoever's supposed to be the superstar in the campground they'll all start wearing their hair the same huh cause they're looking up to somebody in the group they want to fit in with the group said they want to act like and just talk just like little worlds just walking around the campground i just shake my head sometimes it's called influence i didn't want to be like that one and you see so many young people and a lot of times those ones that walk around like that they're the worst ones they don't care nothing about god they're there for the wrong reasons how many girls numbers they can get or how many bars numbers they can talk to it's the wrong reason and then the other will be attracted to it it's warriors and we can create those things very very easily praise the lord my wife bless her heart i use a lot of examples with my wife me and my wife sometimes because sometimes when you do things like do people be sitting there getting mad at you they think you're pointing at them but i don't know nothing about y'all lives so i just use my me and my wife to try to break the ice you know my wife just recently bless her heart my daughter them told me they were gonna throw her a surprise birthday party she never had a birthday party she said daddy we want to give mom a birthday party and say you're going to play a key role in it so you're going to have to make sure you get her there it's okay this is this in three months in the making and uh say we're gonna have it at the fellowship hall at the church and you gotta somehow get her at the church i don't know how you're gonna do it that's all right i can do it that's okay so they told me that her birthday was in april so they told me that in february see i know my wife i told i said i see you know when your birthday come in april i don't make no plans with nobody i said cause i got something planned for us and uh you no sisters don't care who it is did you tell them no you i got something planned she said wow she ain't never done that so now she's like and it was funny some sisters had asked her about some she barely already got plans for us because i'm not that type of person i'm a bless her heart i'm a spur of a moment person i could just be riding down the road something popping my mind hey you want to go go cold she yep should take off and go brother why you didn't tell me i just thought of it that's just me that's burley williams i didn't know but a lot of times i thank god some things work out for me because sometimes i don't know one way or the other what god wants me to do i just don't know but i do know the scripture says the footsteps of the righteous is the order of the lord that's what i do know and i do believe when god leads everything works together i do believe that because like i had every intention being on here last sunday every intention and i'll give you a testimony about that later brother but i just knew i couldn't be something just ain't lining up i don't know what it is but i cannot go and then so i called but john so time go by and her birthday was uh on a saturday so again close to her birthday i noticed she was getting sad cause nobody said anything about birthday presents nothing so i told i said uh i see um i said i said uh i got us a room at this motel here we're gonna stay there a couple days she's oh okay okay and i said uh no before i say that when i had told her about it don't make no plan she she called her daughter she's a girl your daddy gonna take me out somewhere i know it's gonna be somewhat fancy to eat so i need to order a dress she said i need to start her mind she done created that world she already there so my daughter telling me that she daddy did what she said that's okay she don't know all of us just talking it's okay okay she said she did she did it she said that i was talking to mom she didn't burn him put a lot of thought in this he never talked like this to me before he got a lot of thoughts he has a lot of thought going into it so uh so there was a i think there was a thursday i wouldn't got a room me and her just bless her heart i was so wore out and tired i was just cause i was working i was just tired i go to room go to sleep but then i noticed she thought my spirit started going down i said you all right she's well i heard in from the kids nobody said nothing but what she didn't know my daughter that lived two hours away she used to drive down two hours to sneak up to the church and decorate the church and my wife didn't know it so i said oh yeah she said ain't nobody saying that all right so she was just miserable i mean she was depressed my wife was so depressed that nobody said happy birthday and we were sitting in that room i could feel it so i had to make it worse you know you got to play it all i said you know what me you should have just stayed at home i said cause i had to pay money for you to sit in here depressed we could have just did this at home that's what we could have done we could just did it at home she said okay burglar i'm not yes you are so i gotta you gotta plan it good and she said well i just said bernie nobody at least i'm with you and you got something planned for saturday so what do the kids do nothing not she said i'm okay i'm okay with that no you ain't so then saturday comes party time i said we ain't gonna be late now gotta be ready okay so i went to walmart and i bought some blindfolds i came into the room you know y'all might know you know do rash black people do rags it was black red i bought some dude rags and then when i when i bought them i opened them up now i'm bald-headed she said what are you doing with that i said these are not for me these are for you she said for me yep i said i got a blindfold i got a blindfold you keep the bird i promise i won't open my eyes no no no no no no so we're in the motel wrapping up blinding them can you see no i can't see bird so then we get in the car it's about a 20-minute drive to the church so we get in the car my wife is very smart i knew she was gonna try to calculate every turn i knew that so i circled around the motel a couple of times i just i just did all kinds of stuff just that threw a mine all off and we just driving are we there yet i said i said we getting close we getting close and then i get a text message we ain't ready yet you got to do something so i took a longer route then then i said man then all of a sudden i'm getting close to the church then i passed my son he ain't him there i'm like oh come on so then my daughter called me and said something wrong and then i said what she said what happened what happened i said i said she didn't want some money and i said lord cause we had to tell some only way i could justify my little fields i knew i was going to repent i said lord i'm trying to trick this woman that's the only thing i can think of is rahab she said she didn't know what the spies were but she knew exactly what they were i said so you have to forgive me this is all i can think of so she then we pulled up at the church you know we got gravely she heard the gravel come she said did this gravel i it's a long line people getting to this restaurant because she's thinking it's a big old fancy restaurant that's just a long line and we just in line we're gonna get there she said oh then they they reached up i pulled up got him again i said all right time to get out then when she got out she put her foot she said the grass burley i said yeah she said what motel got grass i said well we got a part you know we got to walk up to it i said you just let's listen this please just come on i said i got your hand i got your hand so i grabbed about a hand we walking up to the door then we open the door and full of people she walks in she just stands there it's all right and then i take that blindfold off and surprise you oh she could say she said all these people no she said all of these beautiful people and then she just thought walking like a zombie she went to the table she said bernie i feel so bad i said you should i said look how you acted look at all those things you said now you got to repent i said you got to repent for all that they've done all of this for you but you built that world you don't build that world that's not look what you've done we built worlds and they become real to us it ain't what you seems it seems sometimes that's all we need to stay in the world of faith trusting in the promise of god and just like the shooting night one when he told her she said when her husband remember that she went to her husband she said i need a chariot he said why there's neither new moon or a sabbath her son was dead but she said all as well look at the character of that woman her child was dead but she told her husband all as well there's no way in scripture recorded that he even knew his son was dead her character was he's at work he already got enough pressure i'll deal with it i'll deal with this situation when he came home her and the son eaten and she don't know her son he don't even know his son was dead but she noticed her character when she left her husband she told the driver drive don't you stop driving but she didn't express none of that character to her husband that's character that's why sometimes my wife deals with situations i don't even know about it because if i knew about it i probably got a kid come here but she'll deal with it sometimes right then later on she'll probably tell him it does such and such what she did i dealt with it all right it's okay okay that's what sometimes it takes it takes a little time to ask questions why do you do this why what happened what's going on instead of just jumping to conclusions because you can build a world and jump into a conclusion you can build a world of always assuming right then that'd be your world and it comes out wrong can we get a lot of hand god bless you [Applause] let us pray heavenly father we just thank you for your word this evening this morning father and i trust and pray i believe oh god it was received i only just preached father this i felt led and expect it in sometimes oh lord things can just seem to be so messed up and it's not sometimes we even build church worlds we feel like we're the only one the only church going through problems look at us we're isolated and what's going on here ain't nothing seem to be happening but then we build a world around that not realizing that we're here by your grace every church every assembly has a different anointing on it father but let us not fail to realize wherever you place us to be that's why we should put our heart we should put our energy there it's a shame father what internet has done oh god and internet churches those things are okay lord but when we can't appreciate what we have we can only just keep screaming and looking at this one this one got this one guy that grass always looked green on the other side but we got to recognize lord jesus where you put us where you placed us that's where the power is and effective effectiveness will be when we know our place and our position i pray for brother john it is similar here and we just thank you for your grace and mercy father and lord we just commit everything into your hands in the name of jesus christ we pray amen may the lord bless you bye john god bless thank you for taking your liberty amen how many appreciated that word amen praise the lord [Applause] somebody wants brother burly to come back amen maybe for a few services yeah maybe in the in the fall or the winter whatever he feels led to amen let's stand together you know we we heard like three sermons not so much the length but just the context and uh boy we all can relate to it uh there was someone before service i was talking to and after i got to talking to him they said well i got to get to my post of duty and i appreciate someone that knows their position we we are in a position that we know that we're going to go into a rapture we have an expected end amen and we've got to keep on keeping on until it happens no matter what happens to this person that group this family i mean we want the best for everybody but we know how hard it is just for us to stay on track we pray for one another but we should not get distracted just stay on track amen let's sing that song or that little course if that spirit that same spirit dwells we can think about this expected end as we as we sing this amen if that same spirit that raised christ from the [Music] if dead same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwells in you dwells in you it shall quicken [Music] dwells in you it shall quicken your mortal body if that spirit dwells in you if that same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwells in you dwells in [Music] it shall quicken your body [Music] [Music] dwells [Music] [Music] what will happen shall quicken [Music] if [Music] amen now how do i know if that's going to happen to me if the spirit's in me it's going to quicken my moral body i'm going to take a rapture how do i know that it's going to happen because you see it happening to your nature now because that's what he promised to do before the nate before the rapture and if you see your nature changing becoming more like christ then you can have confidence that he that had begun a good work he's going to finish it amen we've got the uh there's power in the blood let's say there's power in the blood our brother talked about there's enough power inside of us to go create a world of course we want to we want to create the right one we don't want to create the wrong one [Music] amen there's power in the blood power in the blood would you or evil of victory there's wonderful power in the there [Music] [Applause] is power [Music] oh would you be free from your passion and pride there's power in the blood power in the blood come for a cleansing to calvary's side there's wonderful power [Music] there is power [Music] would you be wider much wider than [Music] there's wonderful power in the blind [Music] oh [Music] for [Music] power jesus the blood powers [Music] is [Music] amen amen we've got the powers [Music] we've got the power [Music] in the name of the lord [Music] though satan rages we shall not be defeated [Music] in the name of the lord we've got the power in the name of jesus we've got the power [Music] in the name of the lord [Music] we shall not be defeated we've got the power [Music] do you believe it we've got the power in the name of the lord though satan rages [Music] the lord praise the lord don't you have more faith amen the word brought us more faith today amen you know our the lord has confidence in in the jobs of this at this age yes the jobs of this age that he can put them through he can allow the devil to have way with them but they're still going to have the same attitude that the first job had that should just give us confidence we should just not be bothered by what we're going through it's nothing to god it may be to us but it's nothing to god and god in you can do all things amen just take this word with you and yes cultivate think about it talk about it to one another share it and let it bring forth its intended purpose because i believe with all my heart god brought us this word so we could manifest it so we could become it so we could become more like the lord and not just to have another service but to become like jesus amen may the lord be with you and bless you let's continue to pray for one another amen i wish we had everybody here but everybody's not here but those that are here and there be some that'll be live streaming some more that will do the archives and some more that you won't talk to but it has been on my heart for about a week now this subject and uh and it is our sister kathleen ben burden for her amen and i want us to do a church fast for one week one week give your all to the lord for our sister she has been so faithful to this body to her position in this local body and the body well the body says when one suffers the whole body suffers and the body needs the body and functioning with the body now if we were all doctors that could actually do something to make a difference in her life we would do it but we're not doctors but we're the children of the living god and god hears your prayers and if we could just take time to fast and to pray for our sister now i'm not going to just call meals in days and a sign but what i would like is us just to be as serious as we could about this subject yes and whatever you can can do to to sacrifice to crucify the flesh and to spend time calling out to god for our sister because she needs the intervention of the holy ghost for her body will you do that with me yes just pray lord what would you have me to do if it's only a meal it's the only meal if it's a day if it's two days whatever it is just call out call upon god and i i want us to have what our brother read today and expect it and for our sister and may the lord be with us and grant healing for our sister oh i just i just prayed that her sister could be able to use her muscles enough to cough up the things that are that mucus and things that are staying in there just to be able to function normally we have the ability to cough up and and it it it becomes extremely difficult for our sister and uh she needs our prayers and her that fasting just i'm serious god i'm i'm serious i need i'm calling upon you if you're not used to it just just take a meal just take one meal and sacrifice one meal and and get along with god and call on the lord for situation amen god will see your heart he sees what's going on he'll he'll
