Lord I receive Lord I receive all things are possible Lord I receive amen let's look to him in just a word of prayer father we are here for the purpose of of truly receiving from you you we're not worthy to be in your house Lord we brought to you our heart a sacrifice of praise and offering as the word says well acceptable on your sight we pray that you'd receive our gifts tonight today this this day Lord and that Lord that we could leave here with something that we didn't have when we when we came we pray that you would open our heart and keep them open to your word help each of us Lord to receive the very word that you have for us we know Lord that every one of us has been a as a a word is been prepared for us and we pray that you'd give us a heart to to hear and to receive it and that we could walk away with joy with a burning in our heart that you talked with us along the way Lord we love you this morning we ask that Lord that you would cleanse us from anything that would just not be perfect in your sight and Lord May the Living Word of God now just come and saturate our being as we commit the service and ask your blessings and the reading of the word now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you turn with me if you would to the book of Hebrews chapter 10 and then also Psalms 44 Hebrews chapter 10 and Psalms 44 well this morning it was a little iffy whether we were going to have church and it seems like the last three services out of all the days are the days that we're having services isn't that something it's like the devil not really wanting us to have church but praise God that we're gathered together we get strength from one another strength from being in the house of the Lord and I really appreciated that worship service and just just being able to worship God amen amen this morning we want to en tile the message take your next step take your next step Hebrews chap 10:39 just going to read that verse but we are not of them who draw back onto predition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul amen that's and then Psalms 44 we're not of them that go backwards neither are we of them that stand still but we are of them that keep moving forward take the next step Psalms 44:18 says our heart is not turned back neither have our steps declined from the way amen God bless you you may be seated if the devil can ever get us to stop moving forward he's got a good chance to get us but if you're always moving forward in the things of God usually it's hard for the devil to get you and how the devil gets us he he it's hard for you know he's just not going to tell us um okay what I want you to do is I want you to go over and hate this person no he stops he says can you consider what they just said can you just consider what they just done and you you stop there and in reality God wants us to move forward and and love regardless of what is said and it'd be like that with anything before if to the person who never robbed a bank before uh I I'm sure he just didn't get the thought go rub the bank he got the thought to consider the idea never robbed a bank before he I's going to stop and consider this this could be easier than I thought and so we must continue to take our next step with the Lord and in order to do that we need to be thinking what does God want me to do next and to be looking for when the word is being ministered because I do believe that God has a step for us to be taken all of us it we're not on the same plane but we are on the same straight and narrow path walking towards heaven walking towards the statue of a perfect man and as clear as anything he has a step for every one of us and and and it's really up to to each of us as individuals to identify what that step is am amen so good to see brother Orlando here with us back in the house of the Lord God bless you my precious brother amen let's keep our brother and his family in prayer Paul said it like this in Philippians he says Brethren the one thing I do I forget those things which are behind me and I reach forth to those things which are before in other words that word reach forth means to stretch onself Forward Unto those things that are before not sitting here and saying well well you know let the word come to me no stretch forth I want what God has for me I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus now that word press towards it means to pursue to flee or to follow in order to catch it in other words it's going in front and you have to do something to catch it to catch the prize the prize of the High Calling God is not calling his bride to a a lukewarm leoa yeah you believe you you got baptized that's good enough you're in the message you're going to to Heaven that is not the calling he has called us to be just like him to to come to the Statue of a of a perfect man as we have here now Abraham is the father of our faith and he went through all the steps of faith and we see here that I believe that Abraham he he he walked these steps and he started out with faith this was the first step and you have to add to your faith virtue but did you know it takes Faith to add virtue it literally takes Faith to add knowledge to Virtue it takes Faith to add every one of these it takes Faith uh to to to add the love of God to your life but we'll see here the very Pentacle he started here and it was at the very end when he offered up his son Isaac he said now I know that you love me he he went through all these these these steps and I'll say it like this there's there's many steps in Romans 4:1 here it says that Faith was reckoned to Abraham before he even received the Seal of the Holy Spirit we know that brother brandham taught us this and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of Faith which he had yet been uncircumcised that he might be the father of us of all them that believe though they be not circumcised we're not Jews we're not in the faith yet the righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but ALS but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had yet uh which he had been yet uncircumcised so what's wonderful about this we know that the circumcision is the cutting away of the world out of our life the old nature just cut it out and away from it and God is saying that he he as God gave Faith a unto Abraham to to to be justified so they that believe just like Abraham believed we too can become justified in the sight of God with yet that yucky nature on us right before it's cut off we we've got to everything is by faith God built everything made everything created everything by faith and we become into His Image by that same faith and and we we as Paul said I live by the faith of the son of man we have to have that Faith inside amen now the first step that Abraham took was he he left behind everything to follow God he left his idols he left his career he left his family he left his friends to follow the word of God Amen and it's no different than the children of Israel when they left Egypt it's no different than when the disciples they left their own jobs they left everything to follow Christ and the first step in the Born Again process is justification by faith we repent from the selfish life that we were living that was really brought upon by a selfish nature amen so it takes time to understand that we we need to fully repent of that selfish nature a and to to to step away from that and we decided to forsake everything just to follow God which is the word of God and it was all by faith right because there was nothing there to prove anything to us we didn't get a picture of heaven or picture of God or a picture that were you know uh we didn't watch something see something that this is what was going to happen if you believe there was something in our heart that didn't didn't want to go to hell we wanted we wanted to know God we wanted to serve God there was there was something inside the it was the seed of God and it it it it it it responded back to God are you with me now there are a lot of steps that we take after that first step with Christ until we come to our last step through raptures door there's me there's many steps and it actually is quite easy to get out of step with God to start doing what we want to do instead of doing what God wants us to do and if we don't keep the old nature crucified then that old nature becomes the headship of another Direction and and the the enemies he always brings us back to that point well I repented I got baptized I I made that that commitment to God our thought goes back to there but it stops there and people seem to just uh a lot of believers seem to just kind of do what they want to do and that's why they can come to church they can hear the word of God they can be told by somebody this is what God wants them to do and it kind of goes in one ear and out the other so we see what's really going on at this point Proverbs 212 tells us for every way of a man is right in his own eyes every way but the Lord pth his heart so we need to make sure that we're we keep walking in the light of God's word as he speaks it to us our opening scripture but we are we are not of them that draw back unto predition that means ruin or loss we're not of them that that come to a ruin that come to a loss with our walk with Christ but we are of them that believe to the saving of the Soul not the saved of the Soul not past tense but to the saving we're in the I'm in the midst of being saved today amen that's where I'm at I'm pressing I'm I'm I'm pressing I'm not of that group that says I'm saved I'm not I'm not of that group I mean if you want to take that that thought process we were saved before the foundation of the world we were predestinated so if that's the case why do we even repent and get baptized right so there is a continuation until we come into His Image our heart is not our heart is not turned back neither have our steps declined this is really important it it takes some real soul searching for us to to take a look at how we are walking compared to how we were once walking at the closest time of our walk with God because it's easy for us to falter and to begin to kind of take over the Reigns and to uh put our thoughts into what we think we ought to be doing and in reality the word should be dictating to us what to do my sheep know my voice which is the word they follow me the word and it's not like well God didn't speak that to me personally it you you come to church to hear from God if you're not hearing from God then prepare your heart because God's speaking God speaking amen now you can't look back at the beginning of your faith and say that you were saved today that you're saved today because of that day you can't do that you can't look back at a past date and say I have salvation today because of something in the past unless your life is still holding the same beginning commitment that is the only way you can say it but it has to be doing that 2 Corinthians 6 tells us behold now is the acceptable time behold now is the day of salvation now not back then 1 Peter chapter 1:8 says God whom he have not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glor Glory receiving the end of your faith what is the end of your faith it is the Salvation of your souls it's not the beginning and this is this is why it's really important that we have a heart to hit the end to grow in Christ because you know the churches out there they teach well I repented I got baptized on this day this day I got saved and I know the day I know what happened I can remember how it happened and that is wonderful but you have got to maintain your growing in the other things that God is telling you in order for that to remain and so this this thing of you know maybe coming into church when you don't feel like it or you don't want to listen or you don't want to do the things that somebody's telling you you read the Bible you're praying you you you develop a habit of I'm serving God but I'm to serve God my way there's more than one way to serve God I'm going to tell you there's only one way to serve God and it's do what his word says that's it that's it there's that's only one way in fact when he told his disciples I'm leaving go preach the word make sure you teach them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you and low them with you to the end so we don't want to complicate it always remember God is looking for us to take the next step so we have to make sure that it's our desire to take the next step we have to be humble we have to remain humble and you will find that next step is really hidden in Simplicity you don't expect God to call you on the phone and say brother stand my son stand my brethren this is what I want you to do no his voice can come speaking in such a simple way but it's still him saying brother Stan or my son Stan either way it is but it's up to us to catch what that is am how many's enjoying the word all right well you can let me know you know as we're Hebrews chapter 3:12 I I believe that you you'll you'll you'll enjoy this Hebrews chap 3:12 take heed my brethren lest you lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the Living God we've talked about this before people want to serve a dead God here's the rules this is what I did but they're missing god with me today right a living God he says but exhort one another daily exhort try to encourage one another to serve God every day you ever try to tell somebody to you know this is what God want I think I believe this is what God is wanting us to do and they just say no I don't think so so we we we we we need to exhort one another daily while is called today lest any of you be hardened through I don't have to do it the deceitfulness of sin and here's the scripture for we are we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast un the end that word steadfast means firm steady stable and sure now that's the beginning kind that's what we had at the begin when we all repented got baptized we were sure of it I want to go to heaven the hard job is to maintain that firm to the end and you would you have be God will give you many steps to take and each one of those steps you have to believe for and stay steady stay sure Stay Stay rock solid as you walk to the top in your last test I think is going to be the greatest no brother brand he came back from the curtain time he says whatever you do get perfect love and that's what Abraham showed that he had at the end and I I don't think it's going to be given to us like Christmas has comeing we're all getting gifts Christmas is coming somebody's going to get a gift give a gift and when you get a gift it it you don't usually got I have to give something back how much I owe you for this one it's a gift it's given to you but God is not going to give anybody character he does not gift anybody with character and that's the only that's going to be on the other side it has to be overcomed it has you have to overcome to get the character am so that means you you you do have to take that step you do have to overcome you have to to be like Christ so you need to as you're going through these trials we're made partakers of Christ if we continue to hold the beginning of our convers steadfast until the end you can't just stop Midway and say I'm a Christian don't get caught in that light of the devil while it is said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation so it's easy to sit in church and hear the word that you need to do this and you you need to stop doing and that and we need to like grow up and we need to become more like Christ and after a while you know that word provocation means irritation it means annoyed we can literally become annoyed by the word or irritated by the word impatient it means it means slightly angry our hearts can become hardened because of the word now the word don't do it the word sets us free what does it is our attitude towards the word and that's why it says the Holy Ghost is speaking Harden not your heart in other words it's got to go through free more agency just say yes Lord I'll walk with you so our next step is to obey every word of God that he speaks to us don't get any I don't care attitude don't get any I'm just gonna ignore this or or don't get puffed up don't Harden your heart just because his voice which is the word irritates you just say Lord something must be wrong with my spirit if I feel this way and and I'm sorry and and I I pray that you just lift this for me and just start worshiping him love him say say Amen to the word even though your flesh don't want to do it don't wait till your flesh wants to do it to say Amen to the word don't do that your flesh is not gonna if your flesh wants to en enjoy saying Amen to the word I I think something's wrong I mean if you think about it isn't that what the Hypocrites do they enjoy that part so your flesh doesn't have to enjoy it but it has to surrender to the word amen it has to surrender so you know just tell the devil get behind me so be it Lord so be it holy ghost come in come in and take over I'm going to take this next step with you our next step is to obey whatever we hear the Lord speaking if it's in his word just follow okay Hebrews chapter 10: 36 says for you have need of patience Hebrews 10:36 for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise did not God put Abraham through a lot of patience God was saying to Abraham you have need of patience you have need of patience and after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise and after he received Isaac he still was in need amen he was still in need not so much of the of the patience anymore but he was in need of perfect love and God put him to that test and it took faith God if God is going to to kill Isaac God is more than able to raise him up it took Faith to get perfect love and and and look Saints this is not just coming to church and hearing A good sermon there God is really trying to send us a message to get ready he says for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not t now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him no pleasure in the person who stands still that's drawing back did you know standing still is drawing back from pressing towards the mark you stop pressing you're drawing back drawing back doesn't necessarily mean this so that's why we need to be always moving forward but we are not of them who draw back unto predition but of them that believe into the saving of the Soul amen Romans chapter 4 verse 13 I hope this is not too heavy for anybody no all right Romans chapter 4 verse 13 for the promise that he should be the heir Abraham should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of Faith so we receive all the nature that God is through faith by these precious promises that God has given us faith in believing that God wants me to be like him in his image to to have these virtues to be able to live this life it is by faith that we receive it for if they which are of the law be Hees faith is made void and the promise made of n effect because the law worketh wrath for where no laws there's no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all of us not to them only which is of the law but to them also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom we believed even God who quith the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were so we can say today you know what I just don't have the patience that I I that that God wants me to have but by faith I am going to have it amen it starts with that it starts with a confession you you got to confess it you got to say I believe it this is what I'm saying I often say this when when you meet the devil you need to tell them where you stand if you don't he'll just push his way into your life that's right and and you you I I heard that one woman say I may not be what I need to be but I I thank God that I'm not what I used to be and and and so but by faith we're going to get there amen by faith Faith we're going to get there so we need to be active like when the word is coming forth the word is being preached you're listening to a tape you're on your knees you're praying we've all experienced I experienced this you're praying and all of a sudden the scripture comes to you that is God speaking to you now I don't know what he's speaking to you when he says that scripture but he is speaking and you you receive that you say Amen I'm going to walk in it and this is I'm going to tell you what if somebody wanted to to be able to uh to to to learn how to work on cars and Brother Bruce says I'm going to show you how to take a carart and put it back together he's capable of doing it but you say nah I don't need I don't need or or you go there and you're just like hey what's this over here and you're not paying attention how are you going to grow to be a mechanic you you you've got to be hungry and show me show me that again why is this how does it what about this so when you come to church you got to get into the word because this word is for you it's for the seed right it's for the seed what verse are we on there all right as it is written verse 17 I've made the a father of many nations before whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and call those things which be not as though they were who against HED he believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be that's us and being not weak in this very important foundation not being weak in the foundation he considered not his own body now being dead when he was about a 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God Amen I am going to be like Jesus you know sometimes we walk around with such a sour testimony this going to I just can't believe this and it we don't even have to have a son when we're 90 or a 100 right we don't even have to do what he's going we just got one thing to overcome and that's the thought that's coming to our head it's all we got to do amen and we won't do it sometimes we get so lazy and well well you I'm just you know this it becomes a religion this is not a religion this is a living God he wants us to take the thoughts that come into our head and he wants us to be more than fully persuaded we're more than able to to to to trust God in this situation and give God glory not the devil and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to also perform so we need to maybe make this statement has God spoken to you that you're going to be like him has he spoken that to you it's a promise then you need to claim the promise you need to be fully persuaded of it you need to be reminded him of it Lord you heard my confession brother BR says God likes to be reminded of his promises so the the worst thing to do is to get that off your mind you know to come to church with everything else in your mind and to expect somehow the songs and have such a an encour or an entertaining message help us that that is not it it's a it's about a realness with God that you have before you come into the house of God that God can can get serious with you I mean it was a serious situation that didn't happen to anybody else there before Abraham that is right having to wait and turn them back young again this experience that Abraham he's the father of our faith right amen amen I want to read a a little uh a little story in the greatest battle ever fought my uh my daughter an had shared this with me and kind of is what kind of prompted the whole message today uh earlier this week brother bam speaking in the greatest batt over fall he says I went into a football stadium one time and was going to preach boy we think about going in a football stadium we're thinking about watching the football game he said I stopped at the door and I looked up and there it said it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog so that's what wins the battle see well look he says he said you say well look look at all those great churches that are against this this this message he says I don't care what size they are it's the fight that's in the dog that it counts it's the faith that's in the individual if you're a card get back to your little cuddle hole but brother if you're a soldier stand out there there's a battle on right and wrong is engaged and let's fight love that attitude late Peter cartright went into a city said Lord the Lord told me to come in here and and have a Revival and he ran an old stor room got in there and began to clean it up and the big bully of the town the the pistol hanging on his side walked down got got through the doors some of them said what's that guy doing there and he he they said he's a preacher he's going to have a meeting he said and the and the big bully said well guess I'll just have to go down there and throw him out on the street and run them out of town here that's all we don't want to have no meatings around this place isn't that something the devil doesn't want us to have God in our homes so he goes down there Stomps the door and Peter cartright and his his coat on and you know he was just washing the windows and the walls down a little bitty fella you know the old preacher laughed at him you know for eating chicken with his hands which is uh adequate uh today you know so he was just washing the windows and fixing around the big bully walked over pulled his coat back his pistol hanging on his side and said what are you doing Peter cartright said oh I'm just washing the windows and he just kept washing the windows you know he had a purpose he had a purpose to come to church he had a purpose in this next step that he was taking because God told him take this step go to this town and have a Revival and God told him to hold a Revival so he's just washing the windows on down and he went down and he said The Bu he said we don't allow revivals around here and he said oh but the Lord told me to hold a Revival see how you got to stand up against the devil he just kept on out at his work see the bully said well he said there's one thing you're G to have to understand he said I run this town around here did you ever have the devil come up to you when you're trying to do something for the Lord and he says that's exactly what that is and he says oh you do and he just kept on washing the windows you know and he said before you have a Revival you're going to have to whip me first Peter cartright said oh I do well I'll just do that next then that's just the next step I'm GNA take amen is that's the next step that's the next step because my purpose is to have a Revival God's called us to be in His Image God's called us to perfect love what's your next step what is God wanting because I am telling you the devil is standing in the way so you don't get into that image he wants you to act like a Christian have a form of godliness he wants you just to fake it he wants you to get distracted over here but I'm telling you God has called you here you have that purpose you need to you need to to take the next step that God's wanting you to take amen don't worry about doing it all don't worry about being a perfect Christian today right don't don't look at your life and say I'm so messed up I had so many things I don't know I can just take the next step focus on the one thing that God wants you to do he just took off his coat he walked over there and he reached by the collar and knocked him down on the floor jumped on the top of him and said I must fight if I should reain increase my courage Lord and He pounded the tower out of him he said you got enough he said yes he got up shook his hand he got saved that night in church amen there you are see it takes the word of God and cut your way through every doubt see sure that's it that's the next job let's get it done right the next thing I I'm do is is get away from my doubts cut them down that's my next job is get all my frustrations away if my senses tell me Well you feel bad the next thing to do is cut that away see that's right you say well they tell me that you know my my my conscience tells me brother Brandon that well you might as well cut that thing away you ain't going to get no further than that you just get the next job done take off your coat and Bear right into it just keep it on going one objective I'm going to win amen I can't lose I'm going to win amen you know Jesus said the kingdom of God suffer violent and the Violet take it by force they press their way into the kingdom You' got to take the next step and it's not going to going to be a comfortable one it's not going to be easy if you're going to get if you're going to do anything that's of any value you're going to have to work for it you're going to have to suffer for it you're going to have to give up the flesh for it often times what the Lord asks us to do is not always easy but we still need to walk in it God tells us to do something if we don't do it we're walking in Darkness at that moment I want you to think about that God tells you to do something and you say well I'll deal with that later like you don't get Ser you're actually at that moment you're walking in darkness walking in darkness is not just oh I'm GNA leave this I'm gonna go do this bad thing walking in darkness is not doing what the light told you to do that's the true definition there 1 John chapter 1 verse5 1 John 1:5 says then this is the message which we heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and we choose to walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light see the light as he is in the light then we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin the important importance that when you hear the word now here I'm just going to say this you ever walk into a room and you can't quite see something or you're walking on the street or you you're in a parking lot and there's certain areas that are dark and it and and and you you look forward to see coming into the light so you can see better because it's not quite light enough where you're at sometimes we're wanting there to be light so you can like get to your car I mean often times we didn't have our our our uh our lights on on the porch we come up to the house we're trying to unlock the door we can't even see our keys we have to pull the flashlight out turn the flashlight on or pull the phone out put the flashlight on to look at her key which one the key is and get it into the door you need the light to see what you're doing amen and the word is the light for our life amen and if you don't walk in that as he gives it to you you're still walking in darkness we need to walk in the light as God gives us the light so we have to keep putting one step in front of the other just one step at a time Thy word is a lamp unto my feet it is a light unto my path amen Abraham kept walking in the light he kept taking one step at a time he's the father of our faith and he kept the faith he kept the faith right to to the end he didn't stop it he kept it how many people we know that were at one time real good strong church goers and they've let off on the gas this serious business to me they're not Keeping the Faith they're not holding that beginning confidence steadfast to the end now you go ask them are you are you a Christian oh yeah I'm a Christian are you saved oh yeah I'm saved but you know according to the scriptures something's wrong amen and we we should never get comfortable with that now I'm not here to judge that that person is not going to make it but I'm telling you if they're going to make it they're going to have to repent and turn around that I know because if they can do that and get away with it why are we here preaching the word why are we here preaching to come into His Image Genesis chapter 22 verse 1 I want to try to go through the this real quick this is was the end here when God God came to the pentacle or or or or uh Abraham came to the pentacle of of of perfect love here and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham now put yourself in this position and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here am I and he said take now thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest and give thee get thee into the land of morah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and settled his ass and took the young men with him Isaac and his son and clav the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went into the place which God had told him now I want you to understand we don't know exactly all the verbiage that took place at that time but it just seems to me that uh Abraham obeyed and that's the kind of attitude that we need to have when we hear the word of God just just just obey it then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off and Abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the S and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and what come again to you I I could see why Abraham didn't mind I shouldn't say didn't mind but it kind of cuts what I'm saying didn't mind having to kill Isaac because he believed that God would raise him up again he had to because he was the promised son amen that's the way we need to believe if I go through this trial it doesn't matter what happens to me I know that all things are going to work together for the good I I've already been predestinated to make it into His Image so if he wants me to suffer a while and go through this and do that and lay down my life here and help this person so be it because I am going to be just like him amen kind of attitude we need to have and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they both and and they both of them they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto his unto Abraham his father and said father my father and he said here am I my son still a sobering moment right because he's in the flesh and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt offering now I want you to understand this Abraham had a revelation what was going to happen his son did not a lot of times when we're dealing with our children or those that are not were they I'm saying young in the Lord they don't have a revelation of the image that they're supposed to be in but we still need to speak with them of confidence that what you're telling them is the will of God brother Brandon said like this in the token you must believe that when you apply the token in your home to your children that it will make a difference believe that that's the faith that that Abraham had and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together how you know how we think about David and he spoke all those prophetic things that you know we don't even know he knew them all right my God my God why is Al for say he didn't maybe even know that God was going to say that and a lot of times God uses our mouth when we're talking to people he does and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of Heaven called him out of out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I have you ever said that in church when God called you here am I Lord here am I not only speak Lord but I will obey and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know the God know that knows everything he says for now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou has not withhold thy son thy only son from me and Abraham lifted his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a Thicket by the horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son now I know it wasn't that God does God knows what we're going to be thinking about he knows what we're thinking about right now amen he knows what we're going to be thinking about five minutes he knows everything but what he was really saying is here is the manif estation of the life that you need to be living I need you to I expect you to live this life not just say well yeah of course I believe that you can do it be willing to take the step by faith and do what God told you to do no matter how scary it seems because what you have a purpose Peter cartright had a purpose and you know what we all have a purpose amen and I I'll say it like this I say humbly respectfully I think the purpose is greater than what we all know because I don't it wasn't at the beginning of Abraham's calling that God told Abraham you know what I'm going to put you in such a position I'm going to make you kill your son after I promis it all that whole steps of his walk is where's my son I I I all I have is when is my my seat going to come and we're taught that he had to fight those thoughts and step out by faith and trust God and keep making the booties and all that stuff but he never told them about what was going to happen I'm telling you we got tests coming we got trials coming and we've got to learn to take one step at a time because if we don't take those Steps of Faith we'll never have faith for perfect love we'll never be able to have faith I am telling you the truth if we don't learn to be faithful with what we have we'll never about to do what God is calling us to do this thought process of well I'm I'm in the message I'm going to go on the Rapture I because I'm I'm no that it isn't like that you know many people that are that are they say that they're in this message that they're not going into Rapture a lot more than our Oh Brother John it's not believing the message intellectually that puts us into the puts us into the Rapture it's taking what the message taught us which is the voice of God about his word really to the bride that's what that is is taking that and applying the token to your home and living the word that puts you in preparation my let's Rejoice his wife have made herself ready for the Rapture that's how we make ourselves ready we don't make ourselves ready the way we want to make ourselves ready we don't add to what the chamberlains have already told us what we need just do do what the prophet said amen amen all right now the end of Abraham's Faith he started out with faith he ended in faith and like Paul told Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:6 for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand I have fought a good fight I have finished my course and look at these beautiful words I have kept the faith I have kept it Abraham kept it to the end where where are these brothers and sisters who are not putting their heart into the word henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give to me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing if people don't love going to church they prob probably are not going to love his appearing that's all he can say if a person is just going to act like they have faith but they're not walking in the light of the word then their faith is not the same Faith as the faith of Abraham it's not it's not the faith because we're you know Jude told us that we need to originally we need to contend for the original faith that was given to the Saints we need that faith that is is is lived James chapter 2:1 17 says even so faith if it have not works is dead being alone amen yeah man may say thou has faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my Works thou believest that there is one God thou doest well the Devils believe also and tremble so you're on the same level just to say I believe what what separates you and the devil is your obedience to the word that's what separates you but will thou know oh vain man that faith without works is dead was not Abraham Our Father justified by works now I know he said when he offered Isaac his son on the altar see thou how Faith wrought his works and by works his faith was made perfect or complete we have to complete the walk I have finished the course I've kept the faith I kept walking in more light all the time and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God oh what a privilege wasn't that brother braham's desire to have put on his tomb friend of God see ye see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by just saying I believe amen all right we kind of want to close on this because time is is we just want to close on these next four scripture readings all right Joshua chapter 1 this came to me in prayer this is one of the scriptures that just just popped out of nowhere in prayer about this message today so I just say this was not me I just I believe this was like an encouragement from the Lord to help us Joshua 1:2 says Moses my servant is dead and now therefore rise and go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given you as I said unto Moses so if you're going to put your foot somewhere you have to take the step amen and remember this was not them going into the mall with a $110,000 check and said buy all the things that you want right they literally had to fight for that step amen you want character you got to fight for it am you want to have you want to have any of these things you got to fight for it amen you want more love you got to fight for it you've got to be able to let somebody look you in the eye and be as bad as they want to be and be able in your heart to love them anyways amen and I just say like this God if I don't got it put me to the test because I I I I want it I want I want to be like him I want to be like him he's our husband why don't we want to be like our husband it's he won't gift it to us right so we have to take it we have to take it by force from the Wilderness look at he's saying how big it is from the Wilderness and this l on even to the Great River the river of fredes all the land of the Hittites the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not be any man able to stand before thee all the days of their life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee now I want to say this in this verse here instead of using the word man because it's a type and Shadow Old Testament it was a natural battle in the new New Testament it's all spiritual battle I'm just going to say it like this there shall not be any Spirit any demon that shall be able to stand before thee all the days of th life as God was with uh William brandom so shall I be with you right as as I was with Moses in the in the in the mount so I'll send you Elijah the prophet and I will not fail thee nor forsake thee wow I feel I can go through the fire if he's with me what I got the fear be strong be of good courage For unto this people shall thou divide for inheritance the land which I swear unto thee their fathers to give them now remember this he's speaking to those that are left over right because many died in the wilderness because of their unbelief so he's saying to them that are still here to this to these people will I divide the land remember Jesus praying for his disciples these are they that stayed with me to the end the other 70 left there is blessings coming to those who stay with the word to the very end amen all right verse seven only be thou strong and very courageous that thou May observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper whether soever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and thou shalt have good success notice in this battle he never tells them make sure you hold the your Shield like this and make sure you got the sword like this because the battle isn't ours the battle is the Lord's the Lord is the only one that can defeat the Devil I feel sorry for those who feel they have they have power over the devil you don't have power over the devil God has given you power through Jesus that's it and how many times have people wanted to use that power right I adure Thee in uh to in Jesus name according to what Paul preached how many how many people want they want to use that name but see it's the life behind the name that that's what really makes the demons tremble and we we got to start exercising what what is spoken here we need we need to observe what we're hearing when we come to church when we read when we do Bible studies when we're getting down under knes when God speaks to us just one thing hold on to it hold on to it be faithful to it and I'll say it like this be strong to hold on to it be of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever thou goest and Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying pass through the host and command the people saying prepare vitual for within three days he shall pass over this Jordan to go to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it wow you talk about an encouraging message they needed that for the battle that was in front of them amen Paul said follow me as I follow Christ amen I want to follow Christ do you want to follow Christ all right last scriptures right here 1 Peter chapter 2: 19 for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience towards God endure grief suffering wrongfully that shows you got patience right God is pleased with that for what glory is it when you be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently but if when you do well and you suffer for it you take it patiently this is what is really acceptable with God for even her to you were called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should what follow his steps his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but he committed himself to the father to him that judges righteously who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree well that that that just should make us feel indebted right right there and and Peter's saying that we being dead to sin we should live unto righteousness we should walk in the light we should take these steps we should follow Christ by whose steps by whose stripes we were healed for ye were as keep Gone Going astray that's who we were we were just doing our own thing but now today we have returned unto the shepherd and the bishop of our souls amen God bless you let's Stand Together We are returned to walking in the steps that God has given us to walk in I I want to admire I want to um not admonish sure I want to admonish you to walk in the steps that God has placed before us but I also I also want to uh give thanks for the example that you are in Walking in the light that God has given you everybody don't see it God sees it and I'll say it like this um I I don't know how many people were around when Abraham offered up Isaac I I don't think they got a football stadium to watch the thing but it it was it was Major with God to where we all glean from it so the light that you're walking in the light that you've been faithful to it it means a lot we don't want to underestimate the light that we're walking in we just want to be we just want to make sure that we continue walking in the next to take that next step remember as Paul said I press towards I press I reaching I'm running after what are we running at we're just not waiting for the the the end to come we're just not waiting for the next service we're just we're not there we're we're we're running towards the image of Christ we're running we're reaching and just just take the next step whatever it might be it might if you're not sure what that next step would be let that next step be just spend a little bit more time in prayer and it just seems that God begins to to speak to hearts in prayer amen let's let's just sing that little course have faith in God then we'll have a a word of of prayer amen have faith in God have faith in God have faith in God for the answer have faith in God have faith in God have faith in in God have faith in God for the answer have faith in God one more time have faith in God have faith in God [Music] have faith in God for the answer have faith in God Amen if we could just bow our our our hearts and maybe close our eyes I just want you to know my eyes are closed let everyone just close her eyes and bow before the Lord let this be the moment just between you and God just real intimate real private believe that we've heard God calling us to step up to step forward to press into start applying our life more towards the word of God to today you feel that God is is drawing you just respond back to him respond back to him say Lord I I I want to I want to be what you want me to be I want to make commitments to you today I want to follow through with commitments that I've made in the past I want to return back to the to you the bishop the the lover the author the very creator of my soul this is your your desire I want you just to hold that before the Lord as we go to pray believe with all your heart father our hearts are bowed before you in reverence and respect and appreciation to you in such an indebtedness Lord how can we forget the great sacrifice that you made at Calvary you coming from the Splendor of Heaven you came and became us that we might become you that we might go and return to you in heaven what a beautiful love story here Lord we're in the midst of that recognizing God that we have yet to walk in all these steps the steps of Our Father Abraham to follow your steps Lord to follow the steps that Paul told us that your word is written out in all these steps Lord we want to declare that our heart says yes we want to walk closer to you here our our longing our desire in this prayer and may Lord you help us to be sensitive to the step that you want us to take and Lord with our love we will apply Faith to walk in that step whatever it might be Lord as we're walking help us to continue to encourage others to exhort others while this day to continue walking with us Lord you told us today that are strong to Bear the infirmities the weak to keep pointing them to your word to say this is the way to walk ye in it Lord help us to take these steps help us to remember Lord these things that we heard today the courage that Peter cartrite had whatever hard the job may be that you've asked him just to continue walking to remember these words that Lord that Joshua spoke to the children of Israel the the same words that you speak to every one of us today Lord we love you we commit oursel to you and may you just bless each and every one of us Lord with just more of you that we may follow through and and be able to testify and rejoice of the growth that's happening to every one of our Lives May we not be shy about testifying to others what you're doing sometimes people don't want to hear Lord what they need to do but Lord we can certainly just open our mouth and tell them what you're doing in our life oh God help us to be bold to do that to wave that that Banner over that Banner of love oh God grant it we thank thee for these things Lord we love you we give you praise and honors we trust you in in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen
