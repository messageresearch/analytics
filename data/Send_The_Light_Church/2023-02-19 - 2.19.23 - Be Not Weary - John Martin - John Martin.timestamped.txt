[35:51] throughout this day the days to come in
[35:54] Jesus name we pray amen amen Galatians
[35:58] chapter 6 during verse number three
[36:03] um for if a man
[36:06] thinketh himself to be something when he
[36:09] is nothing
[36:10] he deceiveth himself so I I believe
[36:13] that's capable of doing
[36:15] but let every man prove his own work
[36:19] and then shall he have rejoicing in
[36:21] himself alone and not in another
[36:25] for every man shall bear his own burden
[36:29] let him that is taught in the word
[36:33] communicate unto him that teacheth in
[36:36] all good things
[36:38] be not deceived God is Not mocked for
[36:42] whatsoever a man soweth that shall he
[36:45] also reap
[36:47] for he that soweth to his flesh shall of
[36:50] the flesh reap corruption but he that
[36:53] soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit
[36:55] reap life Everlasting amen let us not be
[37:00] weary in well-doing
[37:02] for in due season we shall reap if we
[37:06] faint not
[37:07] and let's continue the same theme and we
[37:11] have there as we have therefore
[37:14] opportunity let us do good unto all men
[37:18] especially unto them who are of the
[37:21] household of faith amen God bless you
[37:25] may be seated we want to take our our
[37:27] text this morning from verse number nine
[37:30] and let us not be weary and well doing
[37:32] for in due season we shall reap if we
[37:35] faint not entitled this be not weary we
[37:39] certainly living in an hour where
[37:42] weariness is easy to come by
[37:45] just taking what these words mean in the
[37:49] Hebrew or I'm sorry in the in the Greek
[37:53] and let us not be weak in virtuous
[37:56] doings
[37:57] and virtuous doings
[38:00] for in the appointed time or the set
[38:02] time we shall Harvest if we relax not
[38:08] if we don't get comfortable if we don't
[38:11] allow laodicea to get a hold
[38:15] now we're going to be probably touching
[38:18] on a few different things
[38:21] and our goal is not necessarily to get
[38:24] every single thing but to get every
[38:27] single thing that God has for us
[38:31] and uh I want to start here by talking
[38:34] about uh sewing because we all sew right
[38:38] we're all sores
[38:41] and um usually when we think of sewing
[38:44] it's one time in the spring and that we
[38:46] harvest in the fall
[38:49] but when it comes to sowing to God I
[38:51] want us to think about commitment
[38:54] because commitment plays a big role in
[38:58] uh what we're really sowing when we sow
[39:02] our seed our seed ourselves our heart on
[39:06] to the Lord we either sow all of our
[39:09] heart all of our life or we sow a mixed
[39:13] seed
[39:14] in other words we we we go through the
[39:18] motions of giving our heart to God of
[39:21] repentance but
[39:23] we do not surrender everything we get
[39:28] tricked by the enemy and only time tells
[39:34] we really don't know how sincere or how
[39:36] real seeds are when they're sold or when
[39:39] people give their hearts to the Lord but
[39:42] as they mature they automatically
[39:46] um manifest what kind of sea they are
[39:48] for the law of God is that every seed
[39:51] will bring forth of its own kind amen
[39:54] amen we understand that God cannot be
[39:57] deceived we can't pull a fast one over
[39:59] on God
[40:01] but we can become deceived thinking that
[40:03] we gave all of our heart to God when
[40:05] reality we ended up sowing some of our
[40:08] seed sowing some of our heart to our
[40:10] flesh right
[40:12] and it's not as easy as just why
[40:15] repented I got baptized that we should
[40:17] be there no it is different because this
[40:20] is a serious thing with her heart
[40:22] because God is requiring that we love
[40:24] him with all of our might with all of
[40:26] our soul with all that's within us to to
[40:29] put him first to keep him first and and
[40:31] to make God the center of your life
[40:34] of course Satan's on the other hand he
[40:36] wants anything but that that's true
[40:39] so everything has a seed in it The Good
[40:43] the Bad and the Ugly everything's got a
[40:47] seed in it
[40:48] and when we came to Christ and gave him
[40:51] a heart and our life that was a seed
[40:54] whether we were completely sincere or a
[40:58] total hypocrite or somewhere in between
[41:01] it was a seed
[41:04] oh
[41:06] what was the seed that we planted we
[41:09] should all be able to look at our life
[41:10] and see what we planted right
[41:15] and all I'm doing is trying to provoke
[41:17] some thoughts at this time
[41:20] did we mean business with God
[41:25] was this life in death to us at the time
[41:28] that we did it
[41:29] did we surrender all of our life to him
[41:32] or was the seed mixed with some
[41:35] selfishness were we just trying to get
[41:38] eternal life and that was the main
[41:40] scenario
[41:41] but our life being lit for him wasn't in
[41:45] our thoughts as much as it should be
[41:49] we know that the pure word seed will
[41:52] manifest pure word
[41:54] if you sow word word is coming amen
[41:58] amen every seed brings forth of its own
[42:00] kind even the word of God it does not
[42:03] matter what we've done in the past it
[42:05] doesn't matter the horrible things that
[42:07] we've done or what we went through it
[42:10] doesn't matter if we have a terrible
[42:12] reputation from our past it doesn't
[42:15] matter if we sow our heart unto Christ
[42:18] it will come forth a child of God
[42:24] the only thing that matters is the
[42:26] condition of the heart not the past
[42:29] that's right
[42:31] so it's not about being good enough
[42:35] it's about being sincere enough true
[42:39] enough giving your heart to God Amen
[42:43] how sincere how pure and how in love you
[42:47] are with God and how much you want the
[42:49] truth these are the things that matters
[42:51] to God
[42:53] the word of God can only help us if the
[42:57] condition of our heart is right
[43:01] now
[43:03] this is you know you you plant a a
[43:07] tomato in the ground it'll come forth a
[43:09] tomato you plant a tomato in a pot it'll
[43:12] come forth a tomato if you plant it in a
[43:15] in a flower in a bed a raised bed it'll
[43:18] come forth to Tomato because it is a
[43:21] seed
[43:23] but when it comes to the word of God it
[43:27] just does not come forth wherever
[43:31] you have to have a right condition in
[43:34] your heart it has to go through three
[43:35] more agency so that's it's not good
[43:37] enough to be in a church that preaches
[43:39] the truth
[43:40] it's not good enough it won't get you
[43:43] there
[43:44] it only provides you an opportunity
[43:46] because without it it can't you've got
[43:49] it brother Brian says you've got to have
[43:50] a good betting ground if if if not then
[43:53] that means all the egos will stay in the
[43:56] barnyard right but when they hear the
[43:58] cry they come out they fly out when they
[44:01] hear that truth amen
[44:03] amen because God has something greater
[44:11] that's why the Bible tells us that we
[44:13] need to be more ready to hear the word
[44:14] of God
[44:16] emphasis needs to be put more on the
[44:18] condition of our heart and not how well
[44:21] the word is preached
[44:27] now Jesus taught us that the word
[44:30] has different effects on heart
[44:34] conditions
[44:36] and some of you know we preached on this
[44:38] before called heart conditions
[44:40] and one of the heart conditions that
[44:41] people come to church with is Wayside
[44:44] their heart just isn't there their mind
[44:46] isn't there their heart isn't there they
[44:48] just come and they sit down because it's
[44:50] Church
[44:52] and you you're not going to receive very
[44:54] much from the Lord in that condition
[44:57] uh in fact the devil can use that to
[45:00] really torment you honestly
[45:03] right the other heart condition that you
[45:06] can have and the word really not do you
[45:09] as much good as it should as a Stony
[45:11] heart
[45:12] and that heart
[45:14] has hard spots in it uh perhaps
[45:19] something you've got against somebody
[45:22] something that somebody's done to you
[45:24] maybe uh you've just been a little
[45:27] stubborn towards God you just a little
[45:29] bit rebellious not not yielding your
[45:32] life to God this creates a hardness in
[45:35] the heart
[45:36] of a Believer when he comes to church
[45:38] and he hears the word
[45:40] and it can keep him from the word making
[45:44] a complete effect
[45:47] Jesus said they that have a strongly
[45:50] heart they receive the word with joy
[45:53] as they still say Amen to the word but
[45:55] they don't have much root in themselves
[45:58] because they don't have much root in
[45:59] themselves they only last a while and
[46:02] they go back to the way they were
[46:06] and this is this it we we need to be
[46:09] thinking about the word having a
[46:12] permanent effect in our life and not a
[46:14] temporary effect
[46:16] he says for when tribulation or
[46:18] persecution arises because of the word
[46:21] by and by He Is offended
[46:25] all happens with the Stony heart
[46:28] now a thorny heart
[46:31] this is a a heart that is mixed with
[46:34] other things
[46:36] when they're hearing the preaching of
[46:38] the word
[46:39] in other words they come in they want to
[46:40] hear the word of God but there's already
[46:43] other things in their heart besides
[46:45] wanting to be here at church
[46:46] it isn't first in their hearts this
[46:49] isn't first in their life this is a very
[46:52] common one for the believer's battle
[46:55] they come to church to hear the word
[46:57] indeed but they're not really sold out
[47:01] to the word
[47:03] it's mixed
[47:05] Jesus said the cares of this world and
[47:09] the deceitfulness of riches choke out
[47:13] the word
[47:15] and they become unfruitful
[47:18] so see the word is okay
[47:22] and they even receive the word they even
[47:24] say Amen but there's other things that
[47:28] are in the person's heart in life
[47:30] outside of the church doors
[47:33] So eventually you know what happens when
[47:37] you have too many weeds in your garden
[47:42] it can really stunt the growth and choke
[47:46] out the good stuff that's why we weed
[47:48] our Gardens
[47:49] and we need to learn to weed out the
[47:51] things that Satan is constantly trying
[47:53] to throw in our life amen
[47:55] amen
[47:57] everyone gets caught up
[48:00] with the cares of this world
[48:03] and if Satan can't get you there he'll
[48:05] he'll try to deceive you with money or
[48:08] things just things that will choke out
[48:11] the word
[48:13] now the other heart condition is the
[48:16] only one that really brings forth the
[48:20] word that's being preached
[48:22] and it Remains the Bible says Jesus said
[48:25] it's a good heart condition
[48:28] it's the only condition that will
[48:30] manifest the word not just this week
[48:33] but this year
[48:35] next year it'll stay it'll remain that's
[48:39] what what it really means to grow is
[48:41] when that word remains with you
[48:45] and it takes it takes not just
[48:51] depending on God to preach the right
[48:55] word to us
[48:58] but the condition of our heart to
[49:00] receive it okay we need Revelation
[49:03] there's no doubt about it we need it but
[49:06] the thing is God is hid Revelation from
[49:09] the wise and prudent
[49:10] and he's chosen to review it to a
[49:14] certain group a certain group
[49:17] there he calls them babes
[49:20] we call them elect he calls them babes
[49:24] but it's a condition
[49:27] it's a humbleness a humble and contrite
[49:31] spirit I'll not despise we need to come
[49:33] into His presence like Esther not like
[49:36] vashti vashti thought she just deserved
[49:39] everything Esther realized she didn't
[49:42] deserve anything and yet he was trying
[49:45] to give her up to half the kingdom
[49:50] a sincere heart that is not mixed with
[49:53] other things a good heart where the love
[49:55] of God is so deep it's our only
[49:57] motivation for being here
[50:01] now Jesus warned us about the cares of
[50:04] the world sneaking in in Luke 21 there's
[50:07] a number of scriptures that are not
[50:08] going to come up on the board and I hope
[50:10] that's okay but just really one you know
[50:13] a lot of these scriptures and if you
[50:14] need them you can go back just just
[50:16] write write them down Jesus said and
[50:19] take heed to yourself lest that anytime
[50:21] your hearts be overcharged with
[50:22] surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares
[50:25] of this life and so that day come upon
[50:27] you unawares in other words we should
[50:30] realize what's going on in this world
[50:32] and it ain't stopping right that's true
[50:34] it's continuing to go down the tubes
[50:37] for as a snare shall come upon all them
[50:40] that dwell on the face of the whole
[50:42] earth that includes us
[50:44] amen watch ye therefore and pray always
[50:49] that's the only way you can be kind of
[50:51] worthy to escape all the things that
[50:53] shall come to pass and stand before the
[50:55] son of man amen how we need to be more
[50:58] prepared when we come into church to
[51:00] hear the word not just say well make it
[51:02] there for the preaching no get in that
[51:04] prayer closet don't assume your heart is
[51:07] good enough because you said a couple
[51:08] prayers get in there and spend some time
[51:10] with God
[51:13] we need to have some self-examination
[51:17] I think it would do our spiritual life a
[51:19] lot of good if we would just take the
[51:21] time and inspect the fruits of our life
[51:24] take a greater interest in making sure
[51:27] that we've got the same intentions today
[51:29] that we did when we first got baptized
[51:33] remember how sincere we were remember
[51:36] how we were just I just want to please
[51:38] you Lord I just want this thing to be
[51:40] right
[51:41] and and you had others that were
[51:43] speaking to you that were already
[51:45] Believers and they tried to encourage
[51:47] you making sure that uh your past was
[51:51] the past and that everything was under
[51:52] the blood and you you you wanted to be
[51:56] sure that you're going to March forward
[51:57] with the Lord remember that
[52:00] even
[52:01] we need to take a look and see if we're
[52:03] there today on a regular basis are we
[52:07] just as determined
[52:08] are we willing to give just as much are
[52:11] we willing to lay down our lives for him
[52:15] are we willing to stand the same track
[52:17] of love the same commitment
[52:20] as we were at the beginning
[52:22] or did we get off track somewhere
[52:26] are we just assuming everything's the
[52:28] same
[52:30] that's why Jesus said he that endureth
[52:32] to the end the same shall be saved amen
[52:35] sir
[52:36] that's why the Bible says where the tree
[52:39] the way the tree falleth that's the way
[52:41] it's going to lie that's right
[52:43] that's why the Bible says our Salvation
[52:45] is nearer than when we first believe
[52:47] that's why we need to continue to work
[52:49] out our salvation with fear and
[52:51] trembling it's not a done deal yet
[52:57] because he that soweth to the Flesh show
[52:59] of the flesh reap corruption
[53:02] but he that soweth to the spirit shall
[53:06] of the spirit reap life Everlasting
[53:10] amen you know Jesus said
[53:13] that the father seeketh such that will
[53:16] worship Him in spirit and Truth
[53:18] so there's certain worship that isn't
[53:21] really from the heart
[53:23] fact he said in vain do they do worship
[53:25] me
[53:26] they're they're their heart is far from
[53:28] me
[53:29] and so
[53:31] it is easy to say praise the Lord
[53:34] just like it's pretty easy to say sorry
[53:37] but it's much harder to be sorry
[53:41] and it's much harder to praise God from
[53:44] the heart
[53:48] if you can confidently say
[53:50] that you were 100 percent
[53:53] when you gave your heart to Christ
[53:57] and you can say that today I am in the
[53:59] same place I am 100
[54:03] committed to Christ I say then today
[54:06] Shake the Dust off your feet
[54:09] and move forward
[54:12] we've all allowed things to creep into
[54:15] our lives at times since our original
[54:18] commitment to the Lord
[54:20] we've all wanted
[54:22] to take a back seat in the church no
[54:26] offense to those of you that are in the
[54:28] back seat today
[54:29] but you know how it is the sign brother
[54:32] Marty and I used to see when we went to
[54:34] the other Church
[54:35] I come early if you want a c i see a
[54:39] back seat in church
[54:40] make sure you come early because for
[54:42] some reason more people want to sit in
[54:45] the back seat than they do the front
[54:46] seat
[54:47] but you understand what I'm saying
[54:49] nothing against all stain in the back
[54:51] seat but that Spirit of just I kind of
[54:53] want to sit in the back
[54:56] we all should better say Amen to that
[54:58] we've all allowed something to swallow
[55:01] our time up right amen we've all been
[55:04] consumed with our problems
[55:08] so much that we just don't hardly have
[55:10] time to help Jesus save Souls
[55:13] we've all felt like we've been so far
[55:16] from God that we felt backslidden that
[55:19] we didn't even want to go to church
[55:21] we didn't want to pray
[55:24] we didn't want to even talk to somebody
[55:27] we really didn't want to Humble
[55:29] ourselves to the word of God
[55:31] and we thought we were doing some great
[55:33] Deed by just making it to church
[55:36] come on
[55:40] we're humans with lots of flaws and
[55:43] they're not going away until we're out
[55:45] of here amen
[55:47] God knows we're frail
[55:49] God knows we have to deal with a lot of
[55:51] stuff in these bodies
[55:54] God knows that we get weary from all the
[55:57] junk that we have to deal with all the
[56:00] garbage that's in this world
[56:03] and God has a rest for the weary do you
[56:06] believe that
[56:08] a lot of people just want rest for their
[56:10] bodies and their situations but God has
[56:12] promised us a rest for our souls and
[56:15] we've read this scripture in Matthew 11
[56:16] 28 come unto me all ye that labor and
[56:19] heavy laden I will give you rest so
[56:22] where does our rest come from
[56:24] it comes from Christ
[56:27] right we got to come to him in other
[56:29] words we've got to not not just come to
[56:32] church but come to him at church
[56:36] take my yoke upon you and learn to me
[56:40] for a meek and lowly in heart ye shall
[56:42] find rest
[56:43] not for your
[56:45] your situations in the world
[56:47] rest for your souls
[56:50] for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[56:54] light
[56:55] now we understand that Jesus is really
[56:59] referring to those who are seeking God
[57:01] in these scriptures because if you go
[57:02] right before him he's talking about he
[57:04] hid it from the wise and prudent and and
[57:06] he's and he it's up to God to whom he
[57:09] reveals and people are seeking God
[57:11] that's why the Bible says many will seek
[57:15] and shall not be able to enter in
[57:18] many because they're they're not going
[57:20] to they're going to get weary they're
[57:22] going to quit
[57:25] they feel fatigued from the toil of
[57:28] laboring overburdened what do I got to
[57:31] do to get a hold of this God that
[57:33] everybody tells me so real
[57:36] and Jesus tells them
[57:39] to take his yoke
[57:40] which is the word how simple Amen to let
[57:45] the word become real to you only you can
[57:48] take this word and bind it upon your
[57:51] neck
[57:52] only you can say I I I humble myself I
[57:57] let this word be my headship amen
[58:01] amen only you can say I will make it
[58:04] real to me
[58:06] because if you don't do that you'll sit
[58:09] in church and you'll think who are you
[58:11] to tell me that
[58:14] you'll do one or the other
[58:16] either the word will be your head or it
[58:18] won't be
[58:23] it needs to be the center of our life
[58:27] I want to touch a little bit on becoming
[58:29] weary not from the world
[58:32] not from the hardships in the world but
[58:35] from doing good because that's what our
[58:37] scripture says
[58:39] amen
[58:40] should we go back and read that
[58:43] all right verse 9 and let us not be
[58:46] weary in well doing
[58:50] you can get weary from doing well
[58:54] God knows it can
[58:56] wear us down
[58:59] when you go the Second Mile all the time
[59:02] when you're turning your cheek over and
[59:04] over and over
[59:07] when you're helping those who love you
[59:11] less
[59:12] that's what hate means when they love
[59:15] you less
[59:16] when they have despitefully used you and
[59:18] they've spoken ill of you that it can
[59:21] become weary when you keep doing good
[59:25] when you keep doing virtuous things are
[59:29] you with me
[59:30] it could become very weary fighting the
[59:34] good fight of faith
[59:36] come weary resisting the devil on every
[59:39] hand
[59:41] when you're supposed to stay true to the
[59:44] word keep your flesh under subjection
[59:46] I'm telling you these are virtuous
[59:49] things these are doing good and it can
[59:52] become weary God knows that we get weary
[59:55] in well-doing
[59:57] trying to help people who really don't
[1:00:00] even care enough
[1:00:01] to help themselves
[1:00:04] trying to serve and serve and serve and
[1:00:08] serve feeling it isn't accomplishing
[1:00:11] what we thought it was going to copy is
[1:00:14] anybody here with me can anybody relate
[1:00:16] to what I'm saying
[1:00:18] God knows how weary it gets spending
[1:00:21] time with others laying your life down
[1:00:24] for others
[1:00:25] reaching out to save Souls
[1:00:29] helping to establish someone from from
[1:00:34] their old life to become more faithful
[1:00:36] to God more faithful to the word they
[1:00:39] become established as a Christian
[1:00:43] not based on some religion
[1:00:46] or some
[1:00:48] idea or some
[1:00:51] opinion but based on the word of God the
[1:00:54] one that
[1:00:56] Paul tells us how to be as a Christian
[1:00:59] as the prophet told us in this age how
[1:01:02] to be a Christian
[1:01:04] it's much different than our ideas it's
[1:01:07] much different than our feelings
[1:01:09] and become weary
[1:01:13] trying
[1:01:14] to maintain doing good things
[1:01:18] God knows and he's perfect he's provided
[1:01:21] I'll say it like this the Ferguson's
[1:01:24] family we heard the kids are taking
[1:01:26] prescriptions right when we get sick
[1:01:28] sometimes we want to take a prescription
[1:01:30] when it just we can't shake it off are
[1:01:32] you with me
[1:01:33] well there's certain things that you
[1:01:35] know we just can't shake off sometimes
[1:01:37] but God has provided a prescription for
[1:01:40] us praise God Amen we can find it in
[1:01:44] Isaiah chapter 40 verse 28.
[1:01:47] it's a prescription for all of us who
[1:01:50] get weary from doing good
[1:01:54] you can get weary from the world or you
[1:01:57] can get weary from doing good
[1:02:00] Isaiah chapter 40 verse 28 says has thou
[1:02:03] not known has thou not heard that the
[1:02:07] Everlasting God the Lord the Creator
[1:02:10] think about this of the Earth
[1:02:14] fainteth not neither is weary
[1:02:18] there's no searching for his
[1:02:21] understanding he is awesome
[1:02:24] and he giveth power
[1:02:28] to the faint
[1:02:29] and to them that have no might he
[1:02:32] increaseth strength he turns up the
[1:02:36] power amen he turns the throttle up even
[1:02:40] the you shall faint and be weary and the
[1:02:44] young men shall utterly fall but they
[1:02:47] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:02:50] their strength they shall Mount up with
[1:02:52] wings as eagles they shall run and not
[1:02:54] be weary and they shall walk and not
[1:02:57] faint
[1:02:58] thank you Lord
[1:03:00] now that word wait
[1:03:03] it really means to bind together
[1:03:09] as you Tarry
[1:03:11] upon the Lord
[1:03:14] as you spend time praying as you spend
[1:03:18] time waiting
[1:03:21] for God's presence to come
[1:03:25] it us it isn't until his presence comes
[1:03:29] inside of you that you get strength come
[1:03:33] on man amen when the Holy Spirit binds
[1:03:37] together with your heart
[1:03:41] that is when your strength increases
[1:03:45] but you gotta wait and I tell you when
[1:03:48] you're weary
[1:03:50] when you're weary from doing good and
[1:03:53] you just don't seem like you can do any
[1:03:56] more good it is really hard to keep
[1:03:59] waiting
[1:04:02] keep waiting when you're flying on all
[1:04:05] clouds on all cylinders and everything
[1:04:07] seems to be real good well it's not a
[1:04:09] problem to spend that hour in prayer but
[1:04:12] when you're doing down when you're down
[1:04:14] and you're discouraging you just can't
[1:04:16] seem to get anywhere that's the hardest
[1:04:19] time to keep waiting until the presence
[1:04:22] of God comes and binds with your heart
[1:04:24] and gives you the strength that you need
[1:04:27] hey
[1:04:29] but you got to wait until he comes
[1:04:34] until he binds together with you
[1:04:37] because just staying there and waiting
[1:04:41] there and praying there for 10 minutes
[1:04:44] or or whatever doesn't always get the
[1:04:47] job done I'll say most the time don't
[1:04:49] get the job done
[1:04:53] sometimes you just feel more
[1:04:57] worse
[1:04:58] did you ever pray and didn't feel the
[1:05:01] presence of God and you kind of get up
[1:05:02] and you feel worse
[1:05:04] because you know you didn't get into his
[1:05:07] presence you know you're getting up too
[1:05:10] quick you know you should be staying
[1:05:12] down there longer
[1:05:18] the more that you yield to his presence
[1:05:21] the more strength you will get
[1:05:24] the more you will increase in strength
[1:05:29] the stronger you'll be
[1:05:31] his strength is perfect
[1:05:35] in our weakness
[1:05:37] when we can just get so weak so needy
[1:05:42] that God I'm not going anywhere until
[1:05:44] you come well then he'll bind with you
[1:05:47] we've all felt the presence of God and
[1:05:50] when you get out of there
[1:05:52] you're like a royal lion
[1:05:56] you may go into that prayer room like a
[1:05:59] little kitty
[1:06:00] but you'll come out like a lion
[1:06:03] you'll run and not be weary
[1:06:07] you're not faint
[1:06:08] now I don't care if we're 14 or 95
[1:06:13] strength still will renew us
[1:06:16] he's all we need
[1:06:18] him he's all we need
[1:06:24] but it's not until his presence comes
[1:06:27] and binds with you
[1:06:29] it's got to bind with you because you
[1:06:31] know right now there is no problem with
[1:06:34] God's strength
[1:06:35] he doesn't lose strength here and there
[1:06:37] he doesn't go through trials and feel
[1:06:40] whipped out
[1:06:41] we do
[1:06:44] so but we've got to bind with that we've
[1:06:46] got to Humble ourselves and seek the
[1:06:48] Lord and spend time waiting on him we
[1:06:51] just can't go through the motions of our
[1:06:53] prayer and go through the motions of
[1:06:55] reading go through the emotions of
[1:06:56] listening to go through the motions of
[1:06:58] church we've got to get serious with God
[1:07:02] amen
[1:07:03] stay there long enough think too often
[1:07:06] we're not willing to wait on the Lord
[1:07:08] long enough
[1:07:11] this is not the time to be running on
[1:07:13] fumes right
[1:07:15] we've got to get to the filling station
[1:07:18] and get filled up
[1:07:20] remember what happened to the foolish
[1:07:21] virgins they did not take enough all
[1:07:25] with them
[1:07:26] and they just we ran out of fumes ran on
[1:07:28] fumes and just finally ran out
[1:07:31] now we've all experienced what happens
[1:07:33] when we get low of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:39] we start running out of strength to work
[1:07:41] for the Lord
[1:07:43] start making excuses
[1:07:45] we run out of joy to live for others
[1:07:49] we begin to relax spiritually but I say
[1:07:52] to the bride be not weary in well-doing
[1:07:55] because that's what the scripture has
[1:07:57] told us this morning and let us not be
[1:07:59] weary and well doing for in due season
[1:08:02] we shall reap if we faint not
[1:08:08] in other words there's a possibility
[1:08:11] to faint
[1:08:13] there's a possibility for us to get
[1:08:15] relaxed
[1:08:18] be not weary and well-doing it's no time
[1:08:21] to relax it's no time to allow a
[1:08:26] laodicea's spirit get upon us from doing
[1:08:28] virtuous things
[1:08:31] no time to let the bars down
[1:08:33] it's no time to allow yourself to remain
[1:08:36] in a weak state that you can't be your
[1:08:39] best for God he was his best for us we
[1:08:42] need to be our best for God Amen it's no
[1:08:45] time to be concerned
[1:08:47] about yourself
[1:08:50] sometimes we just get It's All About Us
[1:08:53] well when does that stop
[1:08:57] the eye is never satisfied with seeing
[1:08:59] the ear with hearing every the the flesh
[1:09:02] is always want more It's never enough we
[1:09:05] always got to take care of ourselves
[1:09:06] there's not enough money in the bank
[1:09:07] there's not enough houses and enough
[1:09:09] boats there's not enough lures there's
[1:09:10] not enough guns there's not enough
[1:09:11] there's not enough
[1:09:16] it's no time to only be it's no time to
[1:09:19] be flirting with the world Amen
[1:09:21] let us not be weak
[1:09:24] in virtuous doings for in the appointed
[1:09:27] time we shall reap if we don't take it
[1:09:30] easy
[1:09:32] God is promised
[1:09:34] us
[1:09:37] that if we keep doing virtuous things
[1:09:41] that we're gonna
[1:09:43] we're gonna reap all the things that
[1:09:46] we've sold for God
[1:09:48] think about that your seeds are
[1:09:51] spiritual seeds of course when you sow
[1:09:54] to the flesh it's it's a carnal seed
[1:09:57] right it's spiritual but it's carnal
[1:10:00] when I because the the Devil he's
[1:10:02] spiritual but he's carnal you know what
[1:10:05] I'm saying
[1:10:06] we got to keep on being faithful to the
[1:10:10] word of God we got to keep sincerely in
[1:10:13] love with God we can't let that slip
[1:10:15] away even though the devil keeps telling
[1:10:18] you it really doesn't matter
[1:10:21] you don't really have to be sincerely in
[1:10:23] love it doesn't really matter God knows
[1:10:27] we got to keep listening to the message
[1:10:29] tapes
[1:10:32] even though you don't have enough time
[1:10:36] you got to keep coming to church
[1:10:38] Faithfully
[1:10:39] even though things are trying to
[1:10:42] interfere
[1:10:43] we need to keep paying our tithes even
[1:10:46] though the money is tight
[1:10:50] you need to keep sharing Christ with
[1:10:52] unbelievers even though the majority of
[1:10:54] them are going to reject Christ and
[1:10:56] reject us
[1:10:59] let us not be weak in virtuous doings
[1:11:04] for in the set time we shall reap if we
[1:11:07] don't start relaxing you know it's so
[1:11:10] easy to let other things kind of creep
[1:11:13] in and as soon as they do we're going to
[1:11:16] miss out on the promises are you with me
[1:11:20] for you have
[1:11:24] those of us that have made God
[1:11:27] preeminent in our life and at the times
[1:11:29] we've all had God preeminental life and
[1:11:31] I trust today that every one of us God
[1:11:33] is preeminent in her life
[1:11:37] your heart will be full of joy
[1:11:40] it will be a joy to be his servant
[1:11:44] you will be a love slave to him you'll
[1:11:47] be a prisoner for Christ it'll be an
[1:11:49] honor to give up your will and your time
[1:11:52] for him
[1:11:54] sir
[1:11:56] but we must let his presence have
[1:11:58] preeminence inside of us
[1:12:00] keep sowing for Jesus the Harvest will
[1:12:02] come for he that soweth to his flesh
[1:12:05] shall of the flesh reap corruption but
[1:12:07] he that soweth to the spirit shall of
[1:12:09] the spirit reap everlasting life let us
[1:12:12] not be weary in well-doing for in due
[1:12:15] season we shall reap if we faint not and
[1:12:18] as we have therefore opportunity
[1:12:23] let us do good unto all men
[1:12:26] especially unto them who are of the
[1:12:30] household of faith
[1:12:34] most people who know me know what I
[1:12:37] think about opportunity
[1:12:41] a man that wasn't afraid to work
[1:12:43] a man that didn't give up
[1:12:45] a man that had a vision who believed he
[1:12:49] would reap in due season
[1:12:51] Thomas Edison he said opportunity is
[1:12:55] missed by most people because it is
[1:12:58] dressed in overhauls and it looks like
[1:13:02] work
[1:13:06] you know Satan wants to discourage us
[1:13:09] from doing good
[1:13:12] because it's dressed in overhauls it
[1:13:16] looks like work
[1:13:18] and you gotta just keep loving when
[1:13:20] nobody's loving you
[1:13:22] you got to keep giving when nobody's
[1:13:25] giving to you you've got to keep washing
[1:13:27] feet when nobody's washing your feet
[1:13:33] it has been often quoted that he he
[1:13:36] tried and failed like a thousand times
[1:13:40] before reaping success anybody heard
[1:13:43] that
[1:13:44] I read that he failed
[1:13:48] 2774 times according to his records
[1:13:51] before reaching a working design of the
[1:13:55] electric light bulb
[1:13:59] that's what we need to have as
[1:14:00] Christians now he's doing that for a
[1:14:03] natural life
[1:14:04] how much more ought we to do that for a
[1:14:06] spiritual light
[1:14:09] here's another man that had a whole list
[1:14:12] of failures
[1:14:14] it was
[1:14:16] Abraham Lincoln
[1:14:18] he lost
[1:14:20] his job in 1832.
[1:14:23] he was defeated for the state legis
[1:14:25] legister in the same year
[1:14:28] he failed in business the following year
[1:14:34] his sweetheart died two years later
[1:14:38] in 1835
[1:14:40] he had a nervous breakdown the following
[1:14:42] year
[1:14:45] he was defeated for speaker in 1838 he
[1:14:49] was defeated for nomination
[1:14:52] for the Congress in 1843.
[1:14:56] he lost the nomination in 1848 he was
[1:15:01] rejected for a land officer in 1849.
[1:15:06] he was defeated for the U.S Senate in
[1:15:09] 1854.
[1:15:11] he was defeated for a nomination for the
[1:15:14] Vice President in 1856 and again he was
[1:15:18] defeated for the U.S Senate in 1858.
[1:15:23] what
[1:15:25] I mean
[1:15:26] what a terrible record
[1:15:29] but he was elected
[1:15:31] painted
[1:15:33] but God has given us a clear message
[1:15:35] today
[1:15:36] let us not be weary and well doing for
[1:15:39] in due season we shall reap if we faint
[1:15:42] not
[1:15:44] and as we have therefore opportunity
[1:15:48] let us do good
[1:15:50] unto all men boy that's a that's I'll
[1:15:53] tell you you've got to be sold out when
[1:15:55] all men you're looking to do good amen
[1:15:59] especially
[1:16:00] unto them who are of the household of
[1:16:04] faith that's that's us amen
[1:16:07] I think some have become weary
[1:16:10] of doing good things for others
[1:16:13] I think so
[1:16:15] especially those of the household of
[1:16:17] faith
[1:16:19] don't get discouraged don't be weary
[1:16:23] God is always on time
[1:16:27] and he has an appointed time to bless
[1:16:30] you
[1:16:31] just don't start relaxing
[1:16:34] don't that is not the will of the Lord
[1:16:38] Abraham Lincoln was ordained by God to
[1:16:41] be president at the time that he was
[1:16:43] not before
[1:16:45] and not after
[1:16:48] you can't let your failures Define who
[1:16:51] you really are
[1:16:53] Abraham Lincoln did not tell you the
[1:16:55] bride won't amen amen
[1:16:59] what you were ordained to do for God and
[1:17:01] his kingdom
[1:17:04] you cannot let
[1:17:06] all the problems that are transpiring in
[1:17:09] your life stand in the way and Define
[1:17:11] you from what God has ordained you and
[1:17:15] called you to be
[1:17:17] when you think about our Father Abraham
[1:17:19] he was ordained by God to have a son
[1:17:24] in his old age and every year that went
[1:17:26] by
[1:17:27] kind of think about Abraham and Lincoln
[1:17:30] and type here it just got harder and
[1:17:33] harder to believe the promise can you
[1:17:35] imagine Abraham Lincoln ever thinking
[1:17:37] he'd be just
[1:17:39] there was just something inside of him
[1:17:41] that felt to be a leader
[1:17:44] but in his efforts he just kept being
[1:17:46] defeated
[1:17:48] it's just things kept happening
[1:17:50] and every year that went by and
[1:17:53] things went wrong
[1:17:55] something inside of him just kept moving
[1:17:58] forward
[1:17:59] and the same thing that happened to our
[1:18:01] father of Faith Abraham every year that
[1:18:04] kept what going by things got harder he
[1:18:08] kept getting older he kept looking for
[1:18:11] ways to see his promised come he tried
[1:18:14] natural hey what about my servant my
[1:18:16] home and what about uh Hagar and he he
[1:18:20] looking for these natural ways to bring
[1:18:22] about God's promise and it don't work
[1:18:24] friends
[1:18:25] try it
[1:18:27] all hope was against him
[1:18:30] all his ideas had failed
[1:18:33] but Abraham believed in hope the Bible
[1:18:36] says against hope amen imagine what
[1:18:39] would have happened if he would have
[1:18:40] gave up
[1:18:42] he would have just quit
[1:18:44] Stop Believing
[1:18:46] Romans tells us 419 and being not weak
[1:18:50] in faith he considered not his own body
[1:18:53] now dead
[1:18:55] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:18:57] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:18:59] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:19:03] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:19:07] giving glory to God and being fully
[1:19:10] persuaded that he that what he had
[1:19:13] promised he was able also to perform
[1:19:24] now this
[1:19:27] is what we must be
[1:19:29] Abraham was our father
[1:19:32] we are Sons and Daughters of Abraham the
[1:19:36] same seed of Faith
[1:19:38] written out of the natural seed
[1:19:41] we're on the spiritual seed and that
[1:19:44] seed is by faith
[1:19:47] we've got to keep pressing in we've got
[1:19:49] to keep fighting the good fight of Faith
[1:19:51] we've got to press towards the Mart for
[1:19:54] the high calling that this calling is
[1:19:56] only for the bride
[1:19:59] the High Calling is for the bride it
[1:20:02] isn't for everybody unfortunately
[1:20:06] many are called few are chosen
[1:20:09] nah it's not up to me
[1:20:12] or you
[1:20:14] to say who's in and who's out but I'm
[1:20:17] here to tell you only the bride will
[1:20:19] press towards that Mark
[1:20:21] everybody else is going to relax look at
[1:20:23] laodicea they are so relaxed
[1:20:26] they're so lukewarm
[1:20:30] all you got to do is come to church and
[1:20:32] say I've done my deed for the day it's
[1:20:34] good enough I'm in need of nothing
[1:20:43] the children of Israel got weary in the
[1:20:45] wilderness
[1:20:46] but not Joshua and Caleb
[1:20:49] they were persuaded to receive God's
[1:20:51] promise I trust this morning that you
[1:20:54] are determined
[1:20:56] to receive the promise
[1:20:57] [Music]
[1:20:58] now look I know
[1:21:01] that we've all been
[1:21:03] we've all failed the Lord
[1:21:05] we've all had bad attitudes
[1:21:08] we've all kind of
[1:21:10] declined into uh I don't feel like
[1:21:12] trying any harder than I'm doing I
[1:21:13] understand that
[1:21:16] but don't let that be your present state
[1:21:21] you're really
[1:21:23] if you do that you're really showing
[1:21:26] what you are
[1:21:27] right
[1:21:29] because this is the hour that we need to
[1:21:33] stand for Jesus amen amen we need to
[1:21:35] stand up for the word we need to stand
[1:21:37] up and tell the devil who we are where
[1:21:41] we're going who we belong to and that
[1:21:43] you got a revelation otherwise he's
[1:21:46] going to just pull you around
[1:21:49] drag you through the mud
[1:21:52] Hebrews chapter 10 verse 35. now this
[1:21:55] one I want you to read so it's going to
[1:21:57] go up on the board Hebrews 10 verse 35
[1:22:00] cast not away therefore your confidence
[1:22:05] which have great recompense of reward
[1:22:09] so what has reward your confidence
[1:22:16] that's why you got to maintain your
[1:22:18] confidence the confidence is what gives
[1:22:20] you the reward
[1:22:22] if you let your confidence slip
[1:22:27] if you stop getting excited
[1:22:32] you know David said one thing if I
[1:22:35] desired of the Lord and that will I seek
[1:22:37] after
[1:22:38] he had confidence that when he went to
[1:22:41] church he wasn't going to hear from some
[1:22:43] man
[1:22:44] he was going to hear from God almighty
[1:22:48] and God showed him a lot of things in
[1:22:50] church he talked about one time that his
[1:22:53] foot almost slipped because the people
[1:22:55] out in the world were actually
[1:22:57] prospering and he had to suffer and go
[1:23:00] through these things and then the Bible
[1:23:01] says he went to the house of the Lord
[1:23:03] the Lord showed him their end
[1:23:07] their end
[1:23:09] because if you sow to the flesh you'll
[1:23:12] reap
[1:23:13] to the flesh
[1:23:15] but if you sow to the spirit you'll reap
[1:23:18] life Everlasting and his words have life
[1:23:21] amen we all believe this word there's no
[1:23:24] doubt about it but what we're looking
[1:23:25] for is that life to come into us
[1:23:28] to breathe life into us so that we could
[1:23:31] actually have strength to go out there
[1:23:32] and tell the devil where to go amen go
[1:23:35] back from where he came
[1:23:38] man if we we've heard uh and seen people
[1:23:42] uh uh send the devil back to the pit of
[1:23:45] Hell
[1:23:46] I think that's a good place to send them
[1:23:51] the Bible says cast not a way therefore
[1:23:53] your confidence we're to have great
[1:23:54] record pencil reward for ye have need of
[1:23:57] patience
[1:24:00] that after you have done the will of God
[1:24:03] you might receive the promise
[1:24:07] for yet a little while and he shall come
[1:24:10] that will come and will not tarry now I
[1:24:14] can't say for you
[1:24:16] what is God's will for you I can't say
[1:24:19] that it's an individual affair
[1:24:23] we're all in different places God
[1:24:25] 's dealing with you about something he's
[1:24:28] not dealing with me
[1:24:30] and and if you don't feel God dealing
[1:24:32] with you you're in worse shape
[1:24:36] because God should always be dealing
[1:24:37] with us
[1:24:39] you don't want to get to the place where
[1:24:41] you don't feel the dealing of the Lord
[1:24:46] but whatever he's dealing with with you
[1:24:50] you want to keep doing his will
[1:24:54] you want to do it because that'll just
[1:24:57] lead you one step closer now I'm not
[1:24:59] saying he's not going to tell you to do
[1:25:00] something else because he may
[1:25:02] he may have you do a lot of things
[1:25:03] before the promise comes
[1:25:05] but you keep doing it
[1:25:08] don't be wary don't be
[1:25:12] relaxed about doing virtuous things
[1:25:14] about doing good things to others about
[1:25:17] pressing towards the Mark about reading
[1:25:20] your Bible about praying about listening
[1:25:22] to tapes about helping those of the
[1:25:25] household of faith
[1:25:30] I was out there I would have said Amen
[1:25:32] to that one
[1:25:33] [Laughter]
[1:25:37] but you already said that I I I say Amen
[1:25:40] again
[1:25:40] because you know the thing is it needs
[1:25:43] to become real to us we need to say Lord
[1:25:45] I'm committed to this what if this is
[1:25:47] the thing that God's asking you to do
[1:25:49] [Music]
[1:25:51] it you've got it's got to be so be it
[1:25:53] amen amen imagine what would happen if
[1:25:56] the woman with a blood issue for 12
[1:25:59] years would have stopped after five or
[1:26:00] six years right
[1:26:02] right
[1:26:04] said you know what I'm just done dealing
[1:26:06] with this thing I've lost all my money
[1:26:07] it's not working I guess this is just my
[1:26:10] lot life and I gotta deal with it
[1:26:14] she would have never touched the Hem of
[1:26:16] Jesus Amen
[1:26:19] amen what about blind buttermaus
[1:26:22] what if he didn't say have mercy on me
[1:26:25] what if he would have just came to
[1:26:27] church sat in the back and said I can't
[1:26:29] wait to search is over
[1:26:32] I mean we got to get serious with God
[1:26:34] Amen
[1:26:35] what about the thief on the cross
[1:26:38] what if he would have said Lord remember
[1:26:40] me
[1:26:42] what if he would have attitude well I
[1:26:45] guess I just there's no chance for me
[1:26:47] I'm dying
[1:26:51] what about the Seraph Phoenician woman
[1:26:54] what if she would have got defeated when
[1:26:57] God called her a dog
[1:27:02] I'm telling you
[1:27:03] your attitude means a lot to God
[1:27:06] amen when I read about Esther
[1:27:10] and end uh
[1:27:15] and who
[1:27:16] bashti yes thank you you're in the
[1:27:19] spirit with me help me out
[1:27:21] amen when I think about those two I
[1:27:24] think about their attitude that they had
[1:27:27] towards the king
[1:27:29] that's the thing that they were both
[1:27:31] married
[1:27:35] they both went to church
[1:27:37] they both were serving the same King
[1:27:42] but what was different was their
[1:27:44] attitudes
[1:27:46] it was no longer about who was elected
[1:27:49] and who wasn't sure we could talk about
[1:27:50] that
[1:27:52] but it was God rejecting a wrong
[1:27:55] attitude
[1:27:56] in taking on the attitude that stayed
[1:28:00] humble that stayed unworthy that stayed
[1:28:04] broken and needy that was the one that
[1:28:08] God chose I believe the the wise virgins
[1:28:12] are going to be just like that that's
[1:28:14] who he's choosing
[1:28:18] the right mental attitude towards any
[1:28:22] Divine promise of God will bring it to
[1:28:25] pass if you don't relax amen
[1:28:30] if you don't just
[1:28:33] keep quoting it
[1:28:35] keep quoting it keep reading it keep
[1:28:37] believing it keep sharing it make it so
[1:28:40] real testify I can see I can see I
[1:28:43] believe I've got the right attitude the
[1:28:46] promise is coming I will not be weary
[1:28:49] yes sir I will not be weary
[1:28:52] Luke chapter 14.
[1:28:57] now this is we've read this
[1:29:00] before we of course we've read a lot of
[1:29:02] the scriptures before
[1:29:04] and I think it it's okay to keep reading
[1:29:06] them don't you
[1:29:07] Matthew 14 verse 25.
[1:29:10] it says that Ayah you're right thank you
[1:29:12] thank you I need correction Luke 14
[1:29:14] verse 25
[1:29:16] and there went great multitudes with him
[1:29:19] and he turned and said unto them if any
[1:29:23] man come to me and hate not his father
[1:29:27] mother wife children brother sister Jay
[1:29:30] and his own life he cannot be my
[1:29:34] disciple so as we sit here
[1:29:37] and those of us that have a family
[1:29:40] member sitting next to you
[1:29:43] you've got to make a decision who's
[1:29:45] going to be first in your life
[1:29:49] are you going to listen to someone who's
[1:29:52] leading you away from putting Christ
[1:29:54] first
[1:29:58] are are you going to take a stand for
[1:30:00] the Lord
[1:30:02] because if you don't no matter how much
[1:30:04] you go to church no matter how much
[1:30:07] you're in the message
[1:30:09] the message isn't in you like it should
[1:30:11] be
[1:30:12] you've got to put God first because
[1:30:15] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:30:17] and forever
[1:30:19] and whosoever does not bear his cross
[1:30:23] and come after me cannot be his disciple
[1:30:26] and I want to talk you know what your
[1:30:28] cross is right your cross is not
[1:30:30] necessarily all the hardships that you
[1:30:32] got going on in life
[1:30:42] the cross
[1:30:45] is God's will amen amen and if God tells
[1:30:50] you to do good unto all men especially
[1:30:52] the household of faith then you can't be
[1:30:55] weary in picking up your cross
[1:30:58] and carrying your cross and washing your
[1:31:00] brother and sister's feet
[1:31:03] whatever God is calling you to do for
[1:31:06] his kingdom yes amen are you with me yes
[1:31:09] sir okay now
[1:31:11] he goes on
[1:31:13] to talk about
[1:31:16] walking with the Lord here in verse 28
[1:31:20] for which of you intend to build a tower
[1:31:23] and Sid is not down first and counteth
[1:31:28] the cost whether he has sufficient to
[1:31:30] finish it
[1:31:31] less hap live after you have laid the
[1:31:34] foundation and is not able to finish it
[1:31:38] all that behold it began to mock him
[1:31:41] saying this man began to build and was
[1:31:46] not able to finish
[1:31:50] in other words many people left
[1:31:53] and started following the Lord
[1:31:56] but through the process of time they
[1:31:58] realized that they didn't want to really
[1:32:01] continue to give up everything
[1:32:04] they stopped building
[1:32:07] and I tell you you can't be weary in
[1:32:09] well-doing God has called us to
[1:32:12] something special here
[1:32:13] special to be his bride the only group
[1:32:18] of people on the whole planet from every
[1:32:21] age to be the Bride of the creator of
[1:32:24] heavens and earth what a privilege what
[1:32:27] a calling is worth our whole life it's
[1:32:30] worth giving up everything and I'll tell
[1:32:33] you even though you gave up everything
[1:32:35] when you started give it up today give
[1:32:38] it up tomorrow give it up next week
[1:32:41] because Satan will continue to try to
[1:32:43] give you stuff to let creep into your
[1:32:45] life
[1:32:46] true
[1:32:48] we live in such a horrible hour
[1:32:53] there's no hope for the world
[1:32:55] brother Brandon said in the message
[1:32:56] birth pains he said
[1:32:59] one says I'm a Democrat
[1:33:02] the other I'm a publican
[1:33:05] the other I'm a Methodist
[1:33:07] I'm a Baptist
[1:33:09] he said why the whole thing is rotten to
[1:33:12] the Core
[1:33:14] there's got to be something give way
[1:33:18] she can't stand
[1:33:20] he says if you put a George Washington
[1:33:23] or an Abraham Lincoln in every County in
[1:33:28] this United States it still couldn't
[1:33:31] come back it's beyond Redemption
[1:33:37] so why do we want to put any time
[1:33:41] trying to redeem our nation to try to
[1:33:43] turn it around
[1:33:46] but we do have a part to play
[1:33:49] yes
[1:33:51] there are those we are we can redeem
[1:33:54] there are souls
[1:33:57] that we can affect yes we could put our
[1:34:00] time into something that's fruitless
[1:34:03] that is not going to amount to anything
[1:34:06] or we could put our time in to save one
[1:34:09] Soul which is worth ten thousand worlds
[1:34:12] now just as Abraham
[1:34:15] Lincoln
[1:34:17] was ordained to be a president
[1:34:21] you have been ordained to carry out
[1:34:23] God's will for a particular plan
[1:34:28] your job is not going to save a divided
[1:34:30] nation
[1:34:33] but your job is going to save a soul
[1:34:37] nobody can do your job
[1:34:40] nobody nobody could take your place
[1:34:44] you are involved with the people that
[1:34:48] you talk to
[1:34:49] and nobody else talks to them
[1:34:52] right so you have a foreign field to
[1:34:55] deal with you have a a a word to get to
[1:34:59] those people that nobody else in this
[1:35:00] church can get to
[1:35:03] and if you do not carry out
[1:35:05] your plan
[1:35:07] that God has for you
[1:35:09] amen
[1:35:10] I should say if you do not carry out the
[1:35:13] plan that God has for you
[1:35:16] you're not going to save that soul
[1:35:20] and I'll say the Bible says we'll give
[1:35:22] an account to God on that day
[1:35:25] now it don't matter about your plans
[1:35:27] right
[1:35:29] it only matters that you're doing the
[1:35:31] plan that God has for you
[1:35:33] so I I can have a thousand ideas of
[1:35:36] things I want to do I'm not short on
[1:35:38] ideas of what I want to do in life
[1:35:42] especially as you get older you want to
[1:35:44] do more before you die
[1:35:47] do you know none of it matters
[1:35:50] none of it matters
[1:35:53] well only thing that matters is did what
[1:35:56] did you do with what God gave you to do
[1:36:00] now we're living in perilous times but
[1:36:03] it's not the world perilous it's that
[1:36:06] inside the church there are believers
[1:36:10] who are heady high-minded
[1:36:14] Traders
[1:36:16] proud arrogant
[1:36:18] lovers of their own self we go to church
[1:36:22] this is perilous times
[1:36:26] and God is calling a bride out
[1:36:31] now remember he called the whole church
[1:36:34] out they all came out of Egypt but there
[1:36:37] were only two who said I'm going through
[1:36:40] I'll pay the price whatever others do
[1:36:43] and they had to stay in church for 45
[1:36:45] years and deal with murmuring
[1:36:48] complaining they didn't appreciate the
[1:36:51] ministry
[1:36:53] they kept blaming the ministry for their
[1:36:55] condition
[1:37:00] maybe better off if we weren't even here
[1:37:03] at this church at least other churches
[1:37:04] are happier they got better songs
[1:37:09] come on
[1:37:12] but you know Joshua and Caleb that they
[1:37:14] had their eyes
[1:37:16] on that promise
[1:37:18] if you keep your eyes on the promise
[1:37:22] you keep this word around your neck
[1:37:25] you keep this yoke you keep obeying it
[1:37:28] not just saying it's true but you wake
[1:37:31] up in the morning and you say God if
[1:37:33] there's something in here you want me to
[1:37:35] pay attention to today let me do it
[1:37:38] when this becomes real to you
[1:37:41] I say be not weary in well-doing for in
[1:37:44] due season you shall reap if you faint
[1:37:47] not this is no hour to be fainting
[1:37:51] God has equipped us with the Holy Ghost
[1:37:55] that's why he could say be of good cheer
[1:37:57] I've overcome the world
[1:37:59] because greater is he that's in you than
[1:38:01] he that's in the world we have something
[1:38:04] on our side
[1:38:06] he's given us power he's given us
[1:38:08] strength to keep doing good
[1:38:11] we don't have to make excuses anymore
[1:38:13] when I get time when I feel better
[1:38:16] no that's not for the elect
[1:38:18] the lacks moving forward amen
[1:38:21] amen as we can tell time has slipped
[1:38:25] away
[1:38:25] let's Stand Together
[1:38:29] I never know why I just you know
[1:38:31] continue to do the notes if I never get
[1:38:34] to read them at the service you know
[1:38:38] I guess they're just for me you know
[1:38:39] they're just for me
[1:38:41] amen
[1:38:43] praise the Lord be not weary and
[1:38:46] well-doing
[1:38:47] in doing
[1:38:48] virtuous things
[1:38:51] for in the time appointed we shall reap
[1:38:54] if we don't
[1:38:56] relax
[1:38:59] I'll pray this morning that you've been
[1:39:02] encouraged to press in
[1:39:06] I wish there was an easier way knowing
[1:39:09] my heart of giving
[1:39:12] trying to help others I would certainly
[1:39:14] point it out
[1:39:16] but
[1:39:18] we've got to press through
[1:39:21] we've got to press through and
[1:39:25] spend more time with the Lord if you're
[1:39:28] feeling weary spend more time with the
[1:39:31] Lord wait on him until his presence
[1:39:33] comes
[1:39:34] and then you'll have strength to keep
[1:39:37] marching forward for the Lord
