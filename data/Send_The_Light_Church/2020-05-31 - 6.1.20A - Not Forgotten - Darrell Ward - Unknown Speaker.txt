TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] see slowly [Music] a man that stayed together to be more like cheer all my rights away in this world of sin I am so needy Lord to be pure with him let's sing it one more time I am so needy lo so needy of you I am so needed or to be more like you share all my rights away in this world I am so need to be pure hey don't you feel that way and I'm so glad that we're humble enough to say I'm so needy of you Lord Jesus amen well before we see two let's just have a word of Prayer American SR our precious brother Mike if you just opened the service in prayer the deceit this morning amen amen amen god bless you may be seated and before we start we'd like to just go ahead and just just talk just a couple moments and just this is new for us and all of us have come in with such what's going to happen and and should I be doing this I do do a hog sort of shake hands and the first thing I want to say is if it's in your heart to love shake hands that's the main thing and you can express that in words but it for now as we're approaching the reopening of America it would be better to to just lean towards the safe side so I'll just say like this if you feel in your heart that you want to shake hands I mean I have a see everybody just start hugging and it may not be the wisest thing to do so I would say just be thinking about the other person before you go ahead and you do that do that so we took away the drinking fountain because we just don't want people touching things so we got ever there's water bottles you to get that water bottle that yours take it with you if you want to take - we're just trying to be as wise as we can we're constantly cleaning between every surface of the door handles everything it's really recommended not to be hugging everybody in congregating so it would be to me it's a privilege that we could gather together just hear the word but maybe the fellowship might be better outside and just a little bit more distance and just just trying to use wisdom God is in every one of you leading you and it also would be wise if maybe we could just keep the same seats for every service just for a little bit this is perfect for sister Lori she's over in the corner only people on that side of the source she's like happy camper right now so that worked out really good but this this front role is going to be open now so just all I can say is that that's all I know just just do your best to respect it with one another and use wisdom and and don't entertain any any thoughts of fear because that's exactly what the enemy is trying to bring upon this nation and we have to take a stand where we're trusting in God amen amen praise the Lord I'm excited that we're together all I'm I it was it just been such a blessing to get up and walk down the stairs and look down the hall and there's pulpits out there nothing's there and they iced excited I'm going to church and when I was talking to brother Darrell a week or two ago and we were trying to figure out what would be the best time because we actually had invited him for the following week but this just worked out the best for him and we're so grateful and happy to have him with us but I told it's our first time back and I says that people are gonna look at you like Moses and you're you're setting us free from Egypt and so we're just excited about the word that's going to come forth and the service this morning as I was driving to church I noticed how all the green is just popped out just so quickly in the last week and a half or so and you get the the right temperatures the Sun and the moisture and it just creates life it's how God is and I say this morning we have an opportunity to create the same atmosphere here that we could be blessed and that we could grow and just blossom so let's just put our heart into this worship and and invite the presence of God in such a way that he just wants to be among us amen amen let's saying I was I was glad when they said unto me

farthings is a half-ass in five birds sold for a half a cent and not one of them is forgotten before God even the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not therefore you are more value you are a more value than many sparrows think of that a sparrow just a little bird so insignificant in man's eyes than to excel five of them for a half a sin you won't in for many I'll give you ten for a pity five little birds sopra so insignificant in the eyes of man and yet Jesus but not one of them is forgotten which means neglected or uncared-for by God so no matter how insignificant we may seem to be

Jesus thing the bride says he may God bless you you made me see the name Amen aren't you glad that God cares little things you know brother madam tells the story of the King George I believe it was that was visited Canada and an actor that had a big parade for the key and then all the children out of school to go out and stand on the street to watch as the King comes riding by and his chariot and so when the when the parade was over they went back to the schoolroom they noticed that one of the little girls was missing there's so quickly the teacher being concerned she goes out frantically looking for the child up and down the streets and something find the little girl between a lamppost and the mailbox and she was down the second air as she was crying and something teacher runs up through sit honey are you okay we've been so worried about she said are you okay she said yes teacher I'm okay said if someone tried to hurt you no ma'am no one's trying to hurt me Cindy said why are you crying why are you sitting here why why did you come back with the other kids she said did you not see King George when he come back she said all yes ma'am I saw the king and she said well did you wave your flag that we gave you on your spill my waved it with everything that was within me the song that we practices the kingka brought back or yes ma'am I wave my flag and I saved my song and I saw the king she said well honey then why are you crying if you saw all these things what why are you here crises in teacher she said I'm so little she said I son to the top of my boys ha I waved my flag I yell when he went back she said but I was so little she said I saw King George that he couldn't see me the Prophet said that made me that made me true for King George but it ain't true for King Jesus amen no matter how little we are you seen system Amen aren't you grateful for them today amen amen what do we do he sees the very things the popular God says that's in her heart he sees the very thoughts that we have whatever we need no matter how little it is he sees it he remembers it is not forgotten Jeremiah to do says he says go cry into the ears of Jerusalem saying thus saith the Lord I remember thee the kindness of the youth the love of thine espousal when thou witnessed had to be in the wilderness in the land that was not so that's what I remembered you thoughts at the Lord how he may be you every little thing that you do every effort that you make every tear that you try every prayer that you pray God remembers a man you are not forgotten remember when Moses went up before the burning bush and you would stand before the Lord and he said why have you not heard the cries of your people why have you not seen them down there in bondage and God spoke to Moses and he said I have surely seen the affliction of my people I have heard their cries and I remember a promise I made to Abraham and I'll I'll come down okay God does care this morning he does through your prayer he does see yeah he does see with your heart hurts hey man God remembers you are not forgotten amen does God see the great big things that people do absolutely absolutely and sometimes we feel so insignificant that there's nothing that we can do people do great days off man I can't give that kind of a harbor and I I can't do that kind of thing and I can go in this mission field and we see people do great things you think what I can do nothing like it but you see does God see those pray big things absolutely and yet the smallest things that we do it gets God's attention hey man I was looking just before I came out the proposition it's the little things you pass over it'll bit a lot of times that means so much to God I think sometimes we just need to see not how big would you get even though the woman was standing at the door and said I hope she's here tonight when I went through said she was standing there with a little baby and it doctor cried and the mother said she wasn't a Christian but she didn't look the message to be interfered with so she took her baby and slipped out with it and when I went out the door she was standing there with her baby she sat off I would have loved to hurt the end of that message and something just said to me this is of God and I said lady are you a Christian she said no sir I hope to me sometime lovely look a little mother he said little baby in her arms that's it he's here don't put it off too long and then we bowed our heads together and prayed and I asked God to take her soul and at the end when I got through praying and she said amen she began to wipe the tears from her eyes he said why she so she can and she wanted the message though if she didn't get it we'll think about this if she didn't get the message because the baby was crying she didn't want to stop someone else from getting a Miss so she took the baby and went out even though she wanted to hear what was being said she took the baby went out so that somebody else could she wanted somebody else to get it and he said what did it do God care so he had her standing he had her standing right there just exactly at the place to receive it because he cares he knows how to work things just right oh I wonder sometimes are we gratefully but a selfish act got God's attention because he sees the little you think how insignificant is that then a woman would take your baby out and get godly move over to stand right there at the door with the Prophet went back to catch you because you're not for God the littlest things that we do God sees some 33:18 says this behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him above them that hope in his mercy that says I've seen because of happy I've seen because of free his eyes is all the sparrow and I know he watches me amen the Prophet said to the church age but he said write these things say to the faithful the true witness they said now I want to show you that fire on this fall of faithfulness hope you don't mind me reading this is just so good said you know how often we often talk about a great unchanging God whose word does not change and when we speak of him after that manner we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impersonal because we think of a God so big you mean when you think that God still billions upon trillions of stars out of his mouth creating the universe and yet the Bible says he knows every star by name I can't even get my kids name right star my name you think of how great he is and sometimes when we get that in imagination it becomes impersonal and that word impersonal means without feeling of worth or no connection are not connected as though he would be out of touch with us that he would be too busy to care for us after all the whole universe is it is saying so the property said God made the whole universe and all the laws that pertain to it and then stood that can became a great impersonal God it's as though God made a way of salvation for lost mankind and that link in the cross and with the depth of Christ was the towbar sins and his resurrection gave us an open door to him thank God just thought in his arms and stood back then he used all these compassion on the cross and there's none left for us all the other angels received it but now at the Laodicea age he's run out or he's lost interest Senate Majority and pray maternity believe it in a Great Creator who had the creating of lost personal interest in his creation they said now are saying that's how too many people are apt to think that's a way a lot of people in the street that because they try to solve the problem sort of the way because they think God don't care for them God's out of touch with him or they can't relate to a God that great and people get that thinking in their mind and I want you to know they're sporting if you're thinking God will love me and kind of care for me and he's not interested you don't care what I'm dealing with I want to say to you this morning that that you're thinking the prophet of God said that's rogue thinking you're thinking the devil stops you're letting the devil lied to you you're listening to your hear to be instead of your Creator put this on your decorator he'd never created you to forget you Oh [Music] coffee good hi he never created you to forget you oh that makes me feel warm all over God is good with the affairs of me and right now he is both creator and sustainer me love his brother as the standard someone who upholds or maintains his bride it's not us keeping ourselves it's a man to him it's him oh no to me is the creator of this bride and the sustainer of this bride for my and we're all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him on the understand that discordant you were created for him a man the only thing Jesus ever has the father door was your fellowship amen he's before all things behind by and by him all things consist he is the son of God by his own counsel he purposed the plan of salvation of his own elect which he for you the son died upon the cross to establish the means of salvation and the holy spirit carefully execute the will of the Father he is working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he is right in the midst of all of it he is in the midst of his church oh if I could only see God this morning just look around he's with us now he's just changed his mask a man God is in his people that's the supersize Amen God and man becoming one day a man the Great Creator the Savior's faithfully working among us the great Shepherd of the sheep his very existence us into this quote his very existence is for his own we can't even fathom that his very existence is for his own he loves them and cares for them because I is ever well that's true brother if all that's true then what about this virus what about the economy what about all these quarantines America says China started it china says America started it that's true yeah they say they'll go to the military took it over to China and infected the people Britain and the United States said nonsense you come out of your lab well I don't know who started it I wasn't there I don't know who started it but I'm so glad this morning and I know the one who can stop it in how many we get don't matter them started it I know who can stop at this point Amen I don't know about all this stuff that's happening but there's one thing I do know it's for our good if you believe the Bible that you have to admit that whatever is happening in the world right now is for the good of God's people you say how can you say that because the Bible says in Romans 8:28 and we know do we know we know that all things work together for good look on to them who are the called according to his purpose all things that's good a man happy it said come on somebody all things work to do we understand but many times we don't ask them to understand they just says can't you trust me how they are you kinda trust him for his who be did foreknow he also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn of my mini brother amen st. is great punch of the virus and yet God's got a greater counsel there's good things coming up people are playing for yes getting closer to God they're talking around the country brother Doug Baker didn't Tucson Arizona he was telling me that they're reaching more people but a nice treatment yeah than they would have ever reached otherwise people that would have never walked into the door of the church are listening on the Internet brother Jack ducked and applauded he told me he has baptized for people since the pandemic in Florida amen brother Lindsey McGrady over coke Alana was telling me that a man who lives across the street from his church but across the street never entered the door of the church but he got a call from him and said brother Lindsey I was listening to you on the internet and I'm repeated of my sins the toilet the church didn't attract his attention but when things got rough he found God of the inner brother window Martin down the poly Oklahoma was having drive-in Church and a woman never been the church there before he said every service they would have a disatrous people just see the congregation they pull in and stop instead of one that came to the service standing in her car with macular degeneration which is a condition where you go blind in your eyes said she was having a hard time seeing and her eyes were swollen than her and while sitting in her car listening something came over and instantly she was healed her pain was gone and she could see because she came to a drive-in service because they couldn't go inside and have church no matter how chaotic it may seem no matter how crazy it may get no matter how fearful they try to make it God has it all in control he hears both the creator and sustainer why should I worry why should I fear the very same Jesus is always so near he lives in my heart he hears my heart's cry and I can call his name till the storm passes by her lives are here in Christ I'm so glad that my daughter finds this morning he's thankful he's true to himself he will rise he's true to the word he will back it up his proof he will loose not us but he'll raised us up in the last day I'm glad that I'm resting in his faithfulness and purposes being confident this very thing that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it until that day he never brought us this far to leave us I think that that question so song he can for you through sunshine or shadow he cares for you he cares when the sun is shining he cares when the rain has fallen he cares when you're healthy he cares what you sick he cares he knows everything about us this morning you are not forgotten Amen hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the Lord it's above all principalities and powers you're making the lowest name that can make God give him the hospital could be getting there putting as low as they could get him in a sinner's grave but God raised it to the house he saw he ever looks little heaven his eyes on the sparrow I don't know he watches me he watches you he goes every thought that's in your mind he knows every action that you make he knows everything about you why would he do that somebody so insignificant great you know got the little things he does for so just to show us he's mindful was you know here a few weeks ago had a meteorite of celery and I've stayed up the two o'clock in the morning to see it because they said it was a good time to see that the sky was clear I said up there you can see up to 100 an hour I didn't see five in four hours they still willing to be buried 5 a.m. so I set my alarm clock I thought of the father you and I went out there and I was looking up into the heavens I mother saw one might be my imagination I don't know somebody dream the other night I come back and probably burning the brush pile just standing there what comes streaking across the sky just a beautiful sheet start just to let you know because for you nobody would touch you you talk about social distance it was more than 6 minutes nobody's been touching nothing to spines and the dirt and the filth of the street as long as you can be everybody was afraid to get around Matt back when he went into the village he had heel unclean unclean get away from me it was an outcast cast away from society cast away from the city cast away from the church cast away from this everything was against this one man because he was limpid go would mow need anything to do with you if they done anything for him at all that just beats my piece of Britain in the dirt they wouldn't even hand it to him as a human to human stood into the dirty he would get the bread out in the dirt because he was that would even get near you look Jesus cared for you he won't back down when did the Prophet said and he sat down he said I could just see ladies aren't authority but said I will be stopped clean but nothing else be cared when no one else cares for you he still cares with me one day he was so weary he could hardly go he said on the raucous party crowd with a headache and to come down the road a few in possession a little woman and her son was there dead and they were coming down the street and she was wailing it on Shauna why did you take my son what am I going to do who's gonna pay the bills who's gonna get the money I'm old I can't work on to old why did you take my livelihood why did you take everything that was so dear to me why did you take my only son when he was tired and he was weary of this it hurt but he cared for that poor little broken hearted woman and he walked over and he stopped the funeral procession and he touched the young man his son or us because they were why because he could [Music] get up on the rock with the headache it raised your son from the dead he understands we know by the life he lived he cares kenderson just cast you can stumble to meet your sorrow in tears would you lose your loved ones he cares he cares for the pig those who have died in Christ he cares for me no matter how little you are how insignificant you look how poor you are out in different or how many times you've tried and failed he still cares his love still sucks and our hearts door no matter how many times I got a call from a sister that was telling me she got away from the Lord and while at work she got a call she operated the VA hospital the calls come in and a vector called in to the hospital and she answered the call and she said the man on the other into her said ma'am the Lord spoke to me last night and told me when I called the person I speak to to give them this scripture she said years ago the Lord had given her a scripture and as soon as the man said the Lord told me to give you a scripture she said I knew what it was it was Isaiah 41:10 stand out not try it with me be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen the a I will help the end I will uphold thee with the right hand so there's not a one of them is neglect another one of them falls off the branch to the ground here but what God sees that he cares and yet we are more valuable than many sparrows the other morning I woke up with a demon headache I was so sick I couldn't even stay in bed my head was hurting so bad I cut up in a window stairs and open up my computer and I started studying and I got so sick he a little clammy sweating feeling that you get it yeah I don't think I'm gonna throw up I thought I just gotta lay down so I closed my computer and I laid out on the couch I said oh God have mercy upon me Lord in my head is hurting so bad then I'm queasy feeling I was laying out asking the Lord to help me I was so sick my hand was hurting so bad and I get a text from brother Robert Fisher over in Poland oh well across the ocean and this text it wasn't video maybe some of you saw the video of them brother over in Ireland who they recovered with the coma 19 virus yes and he was saying that period his sickness that one night it was the worst night he begin to realize I may actually die yeah the pressure to breathe he said it was so great and they begin to tell him we're gonna have to put you on a ventilator and he said I began to ask God to help me he said I was in isolation no family could get to me no pastor can no one can get to me and I was asking god help me God I beat him but he said the next morning I'm cleaner the person that comes in to clean the room he sent a cleaner coming to him but this cleaner was different he had never been there before and he begin to witness to me about how many lives he'd seen God touch in Nigeria because he had been a missionary and he said then he stood at the door because he couldn't get near me but he stood at the door said can I pray for you he said he asked God to spare my life said that night I begin to turn around I begin to get better he said I started craving my favorite potato chip it was a NATO prawn cocktail crisps all of those three times I see it was a NATO prawn cocktail crisps he said Oh God how I wish I had some of those he said God is it possible that you could get me some tato prawn cocktail crisps and a coke not $10,000,000 not a new card not a new house not a swimming pool in the backyard yeah like a potato cheese something so little something so he was significantly God is it possible that you could give me some of those crisp if the next morning the same cleaner shows up with the bank then he puts the bag on his table and when he leaves the room the Gotcha son in the bank and in the bag was two oranges a coke and a bag of dope from cocktail crisps that's for Fritos that's for Doritos he has potatoes tell you that's a brand name of the crisps but they make the other other companies make the prawn papi okay but he didn't ask for another company he asked for tato and the next morning this cleaner comes in with the bag you see friends you were God's hands you were God's eyes you are God's deliver a man even in his lowest moments could nobody can get to him this pastor didn't get there the encouraging is why I couldn't come and see him his friends his brothers and sisters whoever nobody could get in there to see and in his lowest moment fighting a battle for his life he's gone his God hears his prayer hands him a bag of potato chips because that's what his body was crazy Bob sparrows sold for a person yet not one of them is forgotten by God I just my and I begin to thank God for being mindful of that for men and while I was thanking God he just raised up said thank you I open up my computer just thank you we serve a God who created billions of stars and yet he knows every star by name I'm not so great and yet he cares for such the little things of our life he cares enough that at our lowest moment when no one can get to us he can send us a bag of potato chips because he cares you know I read one time with a little girl what did I speak for her birthday she said him on an iPhone and iPad she just wanted ice cream her mama did it with sheriff truck workers that in the South they traveled from farm to farm and when they stay would stay at this little Shanti's while they worked on the fields and so the family just moved from one bar to the different as they picked the crops as they become right so she's used to traveling being the oldest child but family her responsibility was watch the little ones what some know something you know what that's all about had the watch the little ones were mom and daddy worked I thought they said what do you won't be your birthday she said I just bought some homemade ice cream they said we will work in the fields there you take your little ones and when work is over we'll go into town we'll get some ice and honey we'll make you some ice cream for your birthday so all day long she waited excited a little eight-year-old girl for her birthday good evening time and she saw our parents come and she got out on the porch still excited but when they looked at her II she looked a deal both of them all of them realized they'd forgot her birthday she said I just started crying I run into the house I went into my bedroom I shut the door I fell out on the bed said I just begin to cry out to Jesus in Jesus all I wanted for my birthday was I said her daddy coming down the door Danny sorry just been a bad day we got so busy and things they can go round and this broken bat leave me alone you forgot my birthday she said while I was laying there feeling sorry for myself and crying out to Jesus she said I heard her noise a rumble over the house said my daddy come running it's a he ducked on the noise inside you've got to come out here and see this she said leave me alone she said but my daddy just busted open the door he came in and swept me off the bed said he took me out on the front porch and she said well I was laying in there in the bedroom crying asking Jesus for ice cream a storm came up and they begin to hell and it held enough ice on the ground for them to collect the ice off the ground and use that us to make homemade ice cream for a little girl's birthday because you were not forgot here's the Bible says can a woman forget herself a child that she should not have compassion on senator whoo yay they may forget yeah well I'm not forget the we're gonna talk about that young man denim it was died with social disease in his mom was praying said if I'd be like to shoot him i woman where's your Elisha and you know the story God sent the pump it down there said the boys laying out in that room said he was just loves it brother buddy said what's wrong with city he thinks he's out on the sea he thinks he's lost and she was just trying everyone smile he cried for mama since she's sitting there patting him on her foot nineteen year old boy something like a young man says what does mama baby wolf brother been fed I thought that's right no matter what they get into my having some disgrace they bring up on the family it's still Mama's baby he said I thought of a mother could love like that for her son kissed him on the forehead I thought of a mother can go like that what would the love of God do when this Bible says a mother may forget her suckling thing but I will never forget you Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me could a better forget her suck of the baby she made but I can never forget you here engraved at the palms of my hand so how could God ever forsake us or anything as long as he loves us my bad a man no matter what you've done no matter how far back you go no matter how much you've got into God still loves you get knocked down get up knock the dust off just keep [Music] God said I will never forget you Isaiah 4960 says this behold I have grave indeed upon the palms of my hands by walls are continually before me amen the walls of protection the walls of protection of prosperity the security of God's people God's telling him you're in minds you are in my hands you were continually do you know how the Shepherd tells his sheep from other sheep all sheep were branded and how the Shepherd tells his sheep from the other sheep is because they'll brand his sheep with a certain brand make a turkey track or triple diameter whatever it would be and they take those sheep and they Brandon with that mark and it's his mark and then when all the sheep were branded I'm told that the Shepherd holds out his hand and they take that same brand and brand the palm of his hand so he's marked with the same mark as sheep were marked with well hallelujah obviously glad were known as God's people not by the organization not nothing on the nation but not the mark of the holy spirit on their lives branded with the same venom someone said hey that's my sheep that's my sheep you can say they're mine you see the will come to me and no man is able to pluck them the other day during this quarantine been home a lot so I've been cleaning up some back fields that I've neglected you when you're only home two or three days a week things kind of get out of hand in the back field so I'll be spending a lot of time just cleaning up brush and burning brush piles and fixing my land up well I've been home really enjoyed being that time with my family so I bet their burden I was thinking about this about how that must have hurt to hold your hand can you first of all I don't think but have enough courage let somebody do that to me to hold up their hand there's a prime tweet about this long half of it was in the fire and the other half brother was out of the fire and with my bare hand I thought I'll just pick that up and pitch it into the fire well when I picked it up I didn't realize that all the speed and the juice that turned to steam that was burning in the fruit and come out the end of the branch and when I scream constantly constantly rubbing on it to see how it was doing I would set you know and in church from the preacher was preaching you're listening to the world and I would look at it just rub it our names are engraved in the palms of his hand you just constantly you see if they branded him over foot but they trouble me he says the prophet of God said they were riding out turning us they bark and without worry this Optimus head faces forever before him because every time he sees the scar oh oh oh brother girl been so sick he knows that I've been so weary he knows he never said he never said that we wouldn't have trouble he never said we wouldn't have he never said we wouldn't suffer hardships he never said we wouldn't have disappointments he never said we wouldn't bury her love he never said any of that he just said savings of time how there's only one set that's it morning my hardest times in my life there's only one set of footprints why would I needed you the most did you leave me he said I'm told I could never leave you the hardest times you will have that one set of footprints they're not yours they're mine it was during those times [Music] to give you whatever you need with this morning one of my favorite scriptures in the Bible will come to a close one of my favorite scriptures in the Bible is Jeremiah 29:11 I know the thoughts I think toward you says the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected into cut said I know exactly how it's going to end up for you not at all with Michael in you I know what I think about you first of all it's so wonderful to think that even the god of the creation would even think about me that would in itself you know it's just overwhelming to give you peace - I don't think evil thoughts I don't think of violence but I think of peace a couple years ago I was preaching the meat that was to Sedona
