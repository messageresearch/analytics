And he's always had a good testimony of the church here. He's always felt the love of God and the people. And uh we want to just pray for him that God would guide him. He's been listening to the message and I uh that is the best place to get established is in the word &gt;&gt; and let's just hold them up in prayer. We appreciate him uh digging into the message. &gt;&gt; That's that's about the best that we could give anybody, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Also want to make an announcement here. We're going to be having communion service two weeks from tonight. you put that down Wednesday, October 22nd. Maybe Brother Ron can make that announcement to the the services two weeks from tonight. It'll be uh posted on the board out there. Um and turn with me if you would to the book of Isaiah today. We're going to read out of the book of Isaiah, chapter 31. A lot of things in the book of Isaiah. I want to title the message today, Leaning on Jesus. &gt;&gt; Something uh we all could be doing a little bit more is leaning on Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. It's so good to see everyone have in their Bibles. Is beautiful. Isaiah chapter 31 and um how many's happy to be a Christian? &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to read the first verse and then we're going to have a word of prayer. Woe unto them that go down to Egypt for help, and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many, and in horsemen, because they are very strong, but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the Lord. Amen. Let's bow in a word of prayer. Our heavenly father, we thank you for the word of God. We know this is your word. This is not man's word that has thought of good things to say or that would be right or about you. But they are literally the word of God that's forever settled in heaven. This word is just as fresh as the day it was written and is just as meaningful today as ever. And Lord, we're asking for your anointing to come amongst us at this time and that you would anoint us all with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Anoint our lips, anoint our ears, anoint our hearts, and Lord, help us to receive the engrafted word that we might learn to lean upon you a little bit more. For we need you, heavenly father. We commit the service, ask your blessings now in the remainder in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. may be seated. But this is a a very it's a very strong statement. Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help. That word woe is a divine pro pronouncement of judgment and impending doom. So it isn't just, hey, you need to think it over. It is. You're in trouble if you go down to Egypt for help. Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help. God brought us all up out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Why would we want to go back there for help? God brought us out of the world. Their way of doing things, their way of handling matters, God brought us out of that. I remember being raised by my dad. He did the best he could. He was a a Catholic and he handled manners in the way that he thought they should be handled. And um no um condemning or anything like that. But when you meet the Lord and you meet the word of God, you have his way of doing things. And there is that tendency if you don't if you don't have a strong relationship with the Lord, you have a tendency of leaning back towards the things of the world. How to handle situations. &gt;&gt; So why would we consider looking to anything in this world for our help? Because we came out of the world. God called us out of the world. He says you're not of the world. and he prayed that he would that we would be kept from the world. I shared this little story in our men's meeting tonight. I've made mention it here from the pulpit when brother Brandham he lost his wife, he lost his daughter and it was the I would say probably the darkest hour because God was even teaching a lesson at that time. uh because God told him to do something and he wanted to do he he he he paid attention uh not to God's word if I could just say it like that and um he was just in the worst time of his life it seemed and someone asked him he said Billy in all this trouble did you keep your religion and he said no it kept me the anchor held. &gt;&gt; And so the question is, if what we believe in is so real, it ought to keep us in our trials. &gt;&gt; And if we're not being kept in our trials, we need to get rid of what we got and get what it takes to be held by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Because we shouldn't be, you know, going back out into other things than the word of God to try to find our help. In 1 Corinthians chapter 6, Paul addresses the church. And in the first seven verses of 1 Corinthians chapter 6, Paul asks nine questions. In in in the first seven verses, what was Paul doing? He was trying to get the church to look at their motive and how they were acting so carnal and how that their relationship with God was not even very strong. And so that's why he poses the questions to the church because he's trying to get them to think out of the box that they were in. See, they believed it was okay to go back down into Egypt to get help. Right? &gt;&gt; They didn't think it was necessary to really rely on God and his word and his way of doing things. They thought it would be better if they just handled things the way they did when they grew up, right? The way their mom and dad taught, the way they things happen in the home. So, they just decided to handle things in a very carnal sense. So, let's pick it up at 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse one. Dare any of you, dare any of you having a matter against another go to the law before the unjust and not before the saints? Here is Paul putting the church above the government in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there is no higher order than the word of God. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the courts say out there. There's no higher order than the word of God. Do you not know that the saint shall judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest of matters? Know ye not that we shall judge angels? That's a pretty high a pretty high judgment right there. How much more the things that pertain to this life? If then you have judgment of things pertaining to the slate, set them to be judged who are the least esteemed in the church. &gt;&gt; In other words, the very weakest ones among us ought to be able to judge things the correct way. &gt;&gt; That's what the scriptures saying. And we've we've just got some some things hanging out down here. So, I just say we got we got some growing up to do, right? We got some growing to do. And then he says, um, I speak to your shame. I'm saying this to your shame. Is it so that there is not a wise man among you, know not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? But brother go to the law with brother and that before the unbelievers going before unbelievers to judge two brothers. You know it just you know God's ways are not our ways. Now therefore there isn't there is utterly a fault among you because you go to the law with one another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why you do not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? Nay you do wrong and defraud and that your brethren it's like you know God's way is turn the cheek &gt;&gt; go the second mile uh except it take you know brother says it takes a bigger man to get underneath the little man you you you sometimes you you just have to humble yourself and and let the other person have his win &gt;&gt; right not go before you know somebody and try to prove who's right and wrong. You don't need the world to do that. And and so there's a carnality when you got to prove you're right. There's a real carnality in that. We don't go down into Egypt for help. We don't get advice from worldly people. We don't get our counsel from worldly people. &gt;&gt; We don't get help from the world. Our help cometh from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our counsel comes from the word of God. Our advice comes from the scriptures. Our help comes from believing the word of God is our road map in this life and in how to get to heaven in both our affairs of this world, our work, our our home issues. Our advice comes from the word of God and how to get to heaven. It's our road map. This Bible is our road map from here to heaven. 2 Timothy 3:16 says, "All scripture is given by the inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that we, the man of God, may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works." In other words, this Bible is not lacking one thing to get whatever our need would be in life. We have everything that we need. If there's a question, there's an answer in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not lacking a thing. God did not leave us lacking. Psalms 119:105 says, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path." We look to the word of God to give us light with our situation, to show us where to stand and how to how to be until God comes and takes care of things for us. Did you know God emphasizes the importance of his word 38 times in the book of Psalms 119? Not just this one verse, but 38 times he's emphasizing the importance is the word of God. The word of God. The word of God. And if we can just get that sunk into our minds, every time there's a problem, we go to the word of God and it becomes our lamp, our light. Too often, you know, we've learned to lean on our own ability, our own understanding, our own way of doing things. The And I'll say it like this. We're going down to Egypt for help. We're leaning. When you lean upon your yourself, you're going down to Egypt. And God brought us up out, right? We don't go down to Egypt for help. What we need is a revelation of where help comes from. We need a revelation of how to wait on the Lord in prayer until he does come. And and sometimes we may not have the exact answer what we need to do right away, but if we wait upon the Lord, we'll have strength &gt;&gt; to wait, right? To to to to trust in him. But here's the thing. God knows whether we trust him or not. &gt;&gt; And when we trust God, then God can come and do a wonderful thing in our life. But if we don't trust him, it's impossible. We can't even please God. &gt;&gt; Like you children know, you you children pay attention. I'm talking to you right now. You children know that when you have not done what you've been asked to do by your parents, the chances of you getting what you want is not very good. Your parents are going to come right back to you and say, "Did you do what I asked you to do?" Or, "Did you stop doing what I asked you to stop doing?" And when you can say, "Yes, I did." Well, then you got confidence. You can get that popsicle. You can go to Uncle Ray's or whatever it is. Some of you like Starbucks. I know that. &gt;&gt; And when all your ways please the Lord, he'll make even the enemies to be at peace with you. But when we're I don't know where God's at. I don't know why this is I just don't know what's happening. God is not going to move on our behalf with that. So God wants us to trust him. And the word of God is our absolute for every single problem in our life. So I want you to just think about your life and your problems and the things that are are concerning to you. The things that maybe you've even thought this nobody understands what I'm going through. Nobody cares. Nobody can see. But in reality, God knows all about it. He's so involved in what's going on in your life. You You may not know the voice. You may not know what what what he wants you to do, but I am telling you, God is so involved in your life, but it's he's using everything that happens in your life to build a relationship with you. And the word of God is our absolute for every single problem in our life. Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. God's word is the only thing that the believer uses to fix things. This is a strong statement, but we might as well just anchor it and say amen. Because if we learn to lean upon the word, then we don't care about people's advice. We don't look we don't look for other people. We don't try to get a third opinion, a fourth opinion, a fifth opinion. We don't need any more opinions. We got the word of God. It's the only thing we need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I don't care if we got financial, marital, physical, spiritual, mental, relationships, headships, responsibilities, jobs. I don't care what problem we have. The word of God has an answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you can't pick up this book and find out that it says trusted tool or um uh the the name of the company that any of us have ever worked at. Don't have GM in here, does it, Brother Marty? It don't have Ford. Don't have Pratt Miller. But our situations in those companies has every problem that we've had in there of every relationship or every job pro everything. This word has an answer for that. &gt;&gt; And if we can get that sunk into our hearts and minds, then when we got problems in the home, we won't try to have to, you know, work it out with our flesh. &gt;&gt; Just do what the word says. I I I mean, when look at the the tendency is when when your siblings are giving you some trouble and you spouses are giving one another trouble, the thing that you want to do is set things in order. Right? There's two ways to set things in order. There's the Egypt way and then there's the God's way. And the Egypt way is who do you think you're talking to? You are the one that started this. It's your fault. Don't be blaming me. And hears about it. She hears about it from her mom and dad the Egypt way. But God's way is a soft answer turns away wrath. Right? So we don't need to get somebody's opinion how to handle something. We just go to the word of God. The word of God says this is how you handle it. The problem is we think we in ourselves we so bad want our neighbor to stop doing that or we want our fellow employee or a family member to stop doing something and it may not happen. Did you know that &gt;&gt; it may not happen? As much as we want to change one another's character and makeup, it may never happen, but God can teach us how to deal with it &gt;&gt; and how to preserve us and how to keep us. And you know, literally, you could be in a home where you could grow into the statue of a perfect man and the person that you're married to is going down the tubes all at the same time. It's the truth. I mean, if Jesus said your own enemies be of your own household, I mean, I think he knows all about it. I'm just saying you don't have to have everything perfectly in order to do the right thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And to get problems worked out. But we just got to realize everybody's got a free more agency. And how many times have parents said this about your kids? We should all better raise our hand on this. Well, when you're 18 years old, you can do what you want to do. &gt;&gt; Until then, you're under my roof doing my thing. &gt;&gt; Why do we say that? Because you're under our free agency until then, right? You're paying the bills. But there comes a time that every person has to make their own decision. And this is the beauty of a parent that that a parent has a parent has to their to to their children are at that age where they want to lead to bring them up in the way they should go &gt;&gt; because after that you don't have that opportunity. &gt;&gt; It's gone. So it's a precious opportunity. Woe to them that go to Egypt for help and stand horses and trust in chariots because there's many and the horsemen because they are very strong. In other words, God doesn't want you to lean upon your arm of flesh. He doesn't want you to lean to your own understanding. He doesn't want you to trust in the worldly way of handling things. But look to the Lord and seek the Lord. Look, when there's a problem, it, you know, the scripture doesn't always come to us, you know, here's the answer. You know, it's not that easy. But, but what we do, what God wants us to do, he wants us to spend time praying and seeking the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's it. But we don't want to do that. We just want to fix it on our own. &gt;&gt; That to me is going down into Egypt for help. Don't stay on your horse of power. Don't trust in your chariot of safety. And don't rely on other people's opinions being real strong. So, you know, this is what five other people did in their home. Who cares? &gt;&gt; If the word of God says this, stay with it. &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa. In other words, God is strongly against it. divine divine pronouncement of judgment and impending doom. You know, God is a jealous God and he just doesn't want to share his glory with the devil. If he's not first and your only choice for help, then the the answer is uh a divine judgment. Think about it. God God just gonna bring judgment upon a home who doesn't put God first. And we can just we should all just say amen to that so we can go on to the next thing because we're gonna say quiet. I'm going to say it over and over and you're going to say, "What's happening by brother John?" Turn with me if you would to Deuteronomy chapter 5. God is a jealous God. He doesn't want you to go anywhere for help except him. It it brings up a jealousy in God when we go to anywhere else for help. Deuteronomy 5:6 says, "I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage." So going back, he sh brought him out. Doesn't want him to go back for help. Thou shalt have none other gods before me. Thou shalt not make any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth. Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them. For I am the Lord thy God. For I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generations of them that hate me. Now there you understand with God there is no Switzerland. &gt;&gt; There's no I don't hate but I don't love. There's no in between there. There's you're either hot or cold. &gt;&gt; If there if there's a lukewarm, God puts you in a state of cold hate. &gt;&gt; And so to to to hate God um is to not love the word. And to not love the word or look to the word for help, it means that you despise that. You're not careful enough to spend time in prayer seeking, desiring. Because look, we come we come to church to find out where we're at with God. But we also come to church to learn. and and God is is teaching us that he wants all of us here to rely on God more. &gt;&gt; And and he he's our creator. We should rely on him. &gt;&gt; But the thing is because we don't know him, how do we rely on him? So what we do is we spend time in prayer. We spend time reading the Bible. We spend time God, God, help me to rely on you a little bit more tomorrow. That's how you grow is by making this thing real in your life. &gt;&gt; You you just can't, you know, wake up with some sort of um, you know, feeling that, oh, I know God. No, it's it's a development. If any of you, any of you except brother Bman because he used to work at Trusted Tool and Anne, take those two people out and any of you come and you you fill out a an application, you start working at Trusted Tool. You just can't walk in there and say, "Well, I know Brother John. I know you know what he wants me to do." You don't even know how we do things there. I've never taught you how to we do things there. You don't know the right way or the wrong way of doing things. So, and you you you don't want to go back home or ask somebody off the street for help, right? You you want to get to the source. &gt;&gt; You you could ask somebody inside the shop, right? Like a five-fold ministry for the perfecting of the saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. for help. But but but you you you you don't just go back somewhere else, ask them their opinion about your situation. You don't need to do that. &gt;&gt; You got the word of God. You've been you've been introduced to the word. And if you don't know what to do, simply get on your knees and say, "God, I don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; I do that all the time. I don't know what to do. God, show me what to do." And so it is so bad that God is a jealous God and and if you make him jealous and you can do that by simply not trusting him that the scripture says that he's going to visit the iniquity for three or four generations. Think about that. We probably suffer a little bit from what happened in our past. &gt;&gt; You you understand what I'm saying? And we got to be careful about our behavior because it's going to affect our children. &gt;&gt; And this is just God's law. We don't have nothing to do with it. It's just the word of God. It's verse 10. And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments. &gt;&gt; Well, the commandment is that we trust in God and not go down to Egypt for help. And if we do that, he's going to show mercy. I love the word Psalms 37. Psalms 37. You know, I have a revelation that it doesn't matter if I got one page of note or 12. We never get done. It's just a solid revelation. God always works it out that way. Psalms 37 starting with verse number 23. The steps of a good man, they are ordered by the Lord and he delightth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down. For the Lord upholdeth him with his hand. And I've been young. Now I'm molded. And yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. So here David has this testimony. I was young in the Lord when he chose me and I'm old now and I can tell you that God takes care of his children. &gt;&gt; Now never doubt that. &gt;&gt; Never doubt it. just testify of it. This is God and he's faithful. He is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed. So what do we do? We depart from evil and do good and dwell ever more. So what is evil? Evil is simply leaning to your own understanding. That's how strong evil is. Evil is leaning to your own understanding. For the Lord loveth judgment, forsaketh not his saints. They are preserved forever, but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. God ordains our footsteps. All things work together for the good to them that love the Lord and are the called according to his purpose. So it doesn't matter if how bad a situation is, it doesn't alter the word of God. God's word still remains true. Uh we're going to get into this, but it's during our trials that we must learn to look to Jesus for help. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's the hardest time to do it. We're more tempted to lean to our own understanding during those times. But God uses our life's issues to draw us closer to him. Everything that's going on in life, you could write a list of everything that's going going on in your life. What's wrong, what you like to see changed, I don't care if it's job, finances, relationships, I don't care what it is, but God is definitely using that situation to draw you closer to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; God wants to use the life issues to build his character in our lives. The scripture says to build his house whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of hope firm to the end. As soon as we let go, then God says, "Okay, you called it." And and all I'm trying to do if I'm I'm not talking about making a mistake and falling. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking when you make a decision that I am just not going to trust God. I'm not going to hold the beginning confidence anymore. I'm just going to go do my own thing. God says, "If that's what you want, go ahead." You understand everybody that's going to hell is because they made a choice to go there. They made a choice not to make heaven their home. And he doesn't force anybody to heaven and hell. They're all choices. He's just the judgment of the choices they made. Because many will come to me in that days. Lord, what about this? And I want to do this and I should be going here and what about this and what about all this? And then God's got to show them their motives. And you know what I'm talking about. But I'll say this that God doesn't waste our test and our trials. He doesn't waste our persecutions and our rejections. He doesn't waste our sicknesses and our afflictions. God uses all of our life's issues to build our relationship with him. He doesn't waste one experience. I really want to emphasize this because God is more in your life than you realize. We think something's wrong when things are wrong. No, I believe that God is using that to to to help us. &gt;&gt; Now, if he puts Dennis through the same trial that he puts me or Brother Ron, the same trial, he may be dealing with different things in all three of our lives, but the same trial. So, the trial doesn't really say what's happening in your life, but it gets your attention to where you look to God and you lean on him for your situation. That's why we're told in the Bible, 1 Peter 4:12, I'll just quote it. Think it not strange concerning the fiery trials which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened unto you. In other words, God knows all about it. &gt;&gt; He's the one that allowed it. But rejoice. The Bible says, "In as much as you are partakers of Christ's suffering, that when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy." And James said in First James, verse two, First James, James chapter 1, you know what I mean? There's no First James. There's the one and only James. That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, in the Bible, there was James the lesser and James the greater. All right. James 1:2 says, "My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations. Knowing this that the trying of your faith it works patience." So, we see here that, you know, just with the just with the mere fact of trials, God doesn't waste our trials. Like when we go through a a hardship, the first thing that we want is that thing out of our life. Just resolve it. Get it done. What's the quickest way to fix this thing? I want it out. And God says, "That's not how I'm building my character in you." &gt;&gt; No, we're we're going to get deeper into this thing. We're going to pull out some things in your life that I don't want to see there, &gt;&gt; and I want to make you more like me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so now to get to this, the quicker we get serious with God, the quicker we can learn. But the more we keep diverting past kicking the bucket down the road, passing the buck, however you want to word it, then we don't grow up and we don't learn. And we still have That's why you've got people that are 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 years old that have never learned. Because you don't mature with age. &gt;&gt; You mature with having the right attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how you mature. That's how you grow up is by learning to have the right attitude about things. It's better to know. Did you know it's better to know why you're sick than to get healed? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon sent the message, be certain of God. Maybe that's the way it is with you tonight. You don't know just why you're sick. You don't you don't you don't know just why or what it's all about. But maybe it's a blessing in disguise. In other words, when we're sick, we just want to get healed. Rightly so. When we're hurting, we want the pain to leave. But I'm just saying God doesn't he doesn't um our trials are not separate from God. Our sicknesses are not separate from God. God's involved in all of it. &gt;&gt; And God is wanting to bless us in all of it. &gt;&gt; But we've got to have the right attitude in it. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of God will bring it to pass. But the wrong attitude, you're it's you're just going to get on the wrong side of God. So God doesn't waste our trials or test or anything that's happening in our life. Isn't that comfort to know that God is with us? &gt;&gt; It really is. He uses everything that is happening in our lives for something. And when we love him enough, I'll say according to fulfill his purpose in life, then we can have confidence that that trial is working out for our good. Our sickness is working out for our good. Somehow it's going to be a blessing. So, I can't stress enough that God is using our current life issues to build his character in us so we can have the character for him to dwell in. Because did you know our character is what his house is going to what what house he's going to live in is our character. &gt;&gt; And character is built in in the trials. &gt;&gt; We want to deal with the trials. And God says, "No, you need the trials or I'm not going to live in you." I I just I just love the word of God. Brother Bam said, "Character is the only thing that we're taking with us when we leave here." That's our house. That becomes his house. Our house becomes his house. Character, he said, character is molded in the fiery furnace of trials. So, when we're in the middle of a trial, there's something, if I could say it like this, um, I don't like to use the word magic, but something supernatural is happening in the middle of our trials. And that is the there's the switch is right there. Right there. It's ready to either give you character or you're going to fall back in fear. There's the switch right there. And you know who determines that switch is you. Because when the fire and you think about the the the three Hebrew children when they went into the furnace, there was a switch there. The switch is you don't have to go on that trial, but bow and they said, "No, no, we're going. We don't know what's going to happen when we walk into this trial. I don't know. But I know one thing. I'm not bound before any other image. I'm going to keep God first. &gt;&gt; And when they did, it was their faith that brought the fourth man &gt;&gt; in the furnace. Their faith where the other men, they burned to death. That threw him in. So just think about it. Your attitude about your trial is going to determine whether God meets you in the trial or not. &gt;&gt; Problems persist all around us. We're either going in a trial, coming out of a trial, or we're in a trial. Trials are always they're here to stay. I told my son that. I said, "Trials are here to stay. It doesn't matter what you do, what job you do, where you go, who you talk to, who your friends are, who you marry. It doesn't matter. Trials are here to stay. And the more children you have, the more trials you have." and and we're staring at blessed is he whose quiver is full, but we still got all these trials. Sometimes times are harder than others. Sometimes there's more trials than other times. But God wants us to look to him. That's the bottom line. Now, we know David, King David, he was a man after God's own heart. But I'll say it like this. He probably had more trials than most people. He was a king. He had more trials than most people. Yet, he was a man after God's own heart. So, think about it. He learned to lean upon God. He learned to look alone to God for help. So it wasn't because he had a few trials or he was a king because I think he went through more suffering than most people. All the psalms that he wrote just depicted on everything that he dealt with in his feelings and his emotions. Look at Psalms 27 verse1. David said, "The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid? So in other words, in this first verse, we see that David made a decision to look to the Lord for his help, for his light, for his salvation, for his strength. How many times do we wish we had more strength? I'll tell you, I get up in the morning and I walk from the bed to the bathroom and I think, I wish I had more strength. Like, maybe I should lay here a little bit. Maybe I should sleep a little bit longer before I get up. We all could use a little bit more strength. But our strength and help comes from God. When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though a host, not just uh my enemies, but if a whole host should encamp against me, my heart is not going to fear. Even if war would come up against me, the nation should come up and rise up against me. In this will I be confident. Confidence. And then he says one thing. This is the the one thing that I've desired of the Lord and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. &gt;&gt; Answers come from God. We have to do the seeking. We have to do the dwelling. We have to do the calling upon God, but we don't go back to Egypt to inquire. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We look to the word of God. We we we come with an expectation that God is going to lead me and help me. &gt;&gt; Just the one thing that he desired. That's why I'll tell you what, you can get rid of every book in the whole world, but don't get rid of the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's the thing that'll lead man. I'll tell you, if we got rid of all the other books and put the Bible back in the schools, we'd have better better kids. &gt;&gt; But then we'd have to get teachers that believed it &gt;&gt; and a school board that believed it. &gt;&gt; But it would help. Verse five. For in the time of trouble, God shall hide me in his pavilion. &gt;&gt; In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me, and he shall set me up upon a rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now shall my head be lifted up. Above my enemies, round about me. Therefore, I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy, and I will sing. Yay, I will sing praises unto the Lord. here, O Lord, when I cry with my voice. Have mercy also upon me and answer me. See, he's still looking for help. But he's he's coming to God. He knows where his help's coming from. When you said, Lord, seek ye my face. My heart said within me, your face, Lord, what I seek. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You don't got to tell me twice. Hide not thy face far from me. Put not thy servant away in anger. Thou has been my help. I love that. What a testimony. Thou has been my help. Leave me not, neither forsake me, oh God of my salvation. David did not go down to Egypt for help. &gt;&gt; He didn't he didn't look to other people for help. He looked to the Lord. &gt;&gt; What an example. What a mentor for all of us. And I like I said, he had more trials than we going through. When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up. I'm glad that God did not leave us without uh alone when not only our mother, our father, but our our friends. You know, sometimes I I I remember when I came to the Lord, you were alone. You had to make a decision. This is between you and God. &gt;&gt; The Lord will take you up. Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path because of my enemies. Deliver me not over unto the will of my enemies. for false witnesses are even risen up against me. And they breathe out such cruelty. I had fainted, would have fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. We're going to trust that the Lord's going to help us, right? &gt;&gt; That's why a lot of people are fainting. They're backsliding. They're going back in the world. They stop coming to church because they didn't stay with the Lord. They lean to their own understanding. Wait on the Lord. Be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart. Wait, I say on the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Psalms 121 uh is is part of uh the song of decrees and that's were 15 songs that they worshiped and sung as they walked up the hill to Jerusalem. And so this is one of them as they're walking up the hill to Jerusalem, the hills of Jerusalem. Psalms 121 verse1 says,"I will lift up my eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth." And I'll tell you, I think that's a good song to sing. And and and just just get your own melody to it, &gt;&gt; but sing it every day. And and before you know it, you inside of you, you'll be looking to the word of God more for your strength. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we got a revelation of where our source of help comes from, then we don't need to really look to anybody else anymore. We don't need to lean to the arm of flesh anymore. We don't need to lean to our own understanding anymore. There's a big difference between being carnal and spiritual. When you look to the Lord, that's spiritual. When you don't look to the Lord, that's carnal. I hate to say that's a pretty um down south uh uh definition of of being spiritual. Brother B says, "You want to be more spiritual? Read your Bible and pray. Look to the Lord." you you you you you don't want to look to the Lord, but you you want to, you know, get knowledge on your own. It's only going to puff you up. &gt;&gt; So, our help cometh from the Lord. Praise God. Proverbs chapter 3. We can't do us a message like this without getting into Proverbs 3. Proverbs 3 is about putting the word first in order for the word to actually guide us and bless us. Because in our trials, we want help. We want guidance. We want God to show us what to do. Well, to me, Proverbs 3 tells us to put the word of God first so that can happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if we don't put the word first in our human life, then the word won't be able to do its job. Remember, he gives grace to the humble. All right. Proverbs 3 verse one. My son, forget not my law, but let thy heart keep my commandments. So right there, verse one puts a the word of God needs to be first in your life. Verse two, for it will give you length of days, long life. It'll give you peace in your mind. They shall add to thee. So what is the keeping of the law and the commandments have anything to do with long life peace? Because God is in control. &gt;&gt; He's the one that says, "Demons, get out of there." &gt;&gt; He's the one that says, "Sickness, get out of there. Long life." God is in control. &gt;&gt; And the first thing we have to do and the only thing we have to do is put the word of God first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse three, let not mercy and truth forsake thee. bind them about thy neck and write them upon the tables of thy heart. So we just understand this. Everybody wants mercy in their life. There's never a time you say, "I don't want mercy." So this mercy that's supposed to be bound around your neck, it's not for you. It's for the other people you deal with. &gt;&gt; And so it is truth. You know, a lot of people try to go through life without the truth. In other words, they just truth is coming to church and truth is what they say and believe, but it may not have anything to do with the word of God. &gt;&gt; It it's it's their opinions. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. How many times did did my dad say, "I'm the boss." He'd be smoking a cigarette and say, "Don't don't smoke. Don't smoke when you get older." What What is that? It's you're forsaking the truth. And a lot of times people, they don't use the word. They don't bind that around their neck, but their opinion is what they got bound around their neck. &gt;&gt; And that becomes the truth. Write them upon the tables of thy heart. So shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man. God has a way of showing favor. Amen. Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding. That's the hardest thing to do in Egypt. That's all we did. That's all we did. That's all I knew to do. And and you think about it. A child when it's um born, it learns very easy how to manipulate mom and dad. And you know, a a child's favorite thing, brother Marty, is to go over grandma and grandpa's house because they're already schooled to spoil those kids more than mom and dad. I'm just saying a child has learned from an early age to lean to his own understanding. He knows how to accomplish things and to get what they want. And a lot of times we do that. We go back into Egypt. I know how to fix this problem in this home. But we need to stay with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Stay with the truth. Do things God's way, not the way that we think we need to do them because that's what gets all the trouble. This is a I'm going to tell you this word here that we're hearing. It's a beautiful word. &gt;&gt; It is a beautiful word. In all thy ways acknowledge God, and God shall direct your paths. Be not wise in your own eyes, but fear the Lord and depart from evil. And that's where I got that from. When you lean to your own understanding, you're wise in your own eyes. God caused that evil. And you got to depart from that way of thinking. But rather stay with the word, fear the Lord. It shall be health to thy navl, marorrow to thy bones. Honor the Lord. So this is all about putting the Lord first. Honor the Lord with thy substance, and the first fruit of all thine increase. So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy precious shall burst out with new wine. My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, neither be weary of his correction. For whom the Lord loveth, he correcteth. even as the father the son in whom he delightth. God has one thing in mind, building his home in us. &gt;&gt; So what is he going to do? He's going to be correcting us until we're out of here. &gt;&gt; It it doesn't stop when we're 60. I mean, that would be a great thing for the retirees, right? But in reality, we're we're here. We got to keep pressing on. Don't stop, you know. So, God is always going to be correcting us. Always. Always. That just shows that he loves us and that he's trying to build his house in us. God is on a mission to use every single thing that happens in our life to build his character in us so we can become more in of it in his image. Now when we begin to think like that, I believe we'll handle our trials the correct way. So that's why this is so important to learn to lean upon the Lord in our trials. Problems and trials are needed for our growth. Turn with me for our last scripture reading. It's going to be in Ephesians chapter 4. Ephesians chapter 4. And he gave some apostles, prophets, verse 11, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. Why did he give those to us? that we could be perfected and that there would be the the work of the ministry among us and that we would all be edified as a body of Christ. Now, that's why we have church right there. Now, here's the thing. I'm going to be honest with you. Church should not be separated from home. What we learn here is what we should take home. &gt;&gt; And then we have a better home and then we bring a have a better church. That's how it happens. It grows. How long do we do this? Till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the statue of the fullness of Christ. In other words, our trials are not going away. He's going to use everything that that that happening in our life for a growing process. So, think about what's going on in your life now that you're not happy. No matter what it is, God is staring at you and saying, "I'm trying to build my house in you. Find me here in this trial." &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, if you think about it, when things get real bad, you pray a little bit more. That's what God wants. &gt;&gt; Okay? Till we henceforth that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men cunning craftiness whereby the lay to deceive. So, if you think about um you know, we just um my son had found some um something that just I don't know, somehow it just got uh blown in on our property, but you know, you've seen trash just kind of come out of of a trash can and lay there on the side of the road and it you've seen trash or stuff just blow by the wind. Well, when you're not established in Christ, trials will just, you know, &gt;&gt; you're just here, there, and everywhere. &gt;&gt; It isn't that you don't got an opinion. You just don't got a solid foundation of what to do with with your situation. &gt;&gt; And the the five-fold ministry is to help us become strong, &gt;&gt; become uh our eyes are fixed on the word of God. David David said, "My eye, my heart is fixed." And um our our our eyes are like flint. We're just our we're just rock solid looking to the word for all of our problems. but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part that increasth of every of increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. That is, you know, that's got to be the one of the most complex verses in the Bible. There's so much there. Let me just say this. I've told you here that I have um a a a bad muscle or ligament or something here, and I don't know exactly what it is, but I know it's enough where I can't just, you know, do this with this arm. Now, that little muscle and tendon, a ligament, whatever is messed up there, it's keeping me from being able to function and help the rest of my my body to do what it needs to do. In other words, I can't rely on this arm to do as much work as this arm can do. So, I have to carry everything like this. The thing I'm trying to say to you is you all play a part. We all play a part in the body and your part is just as important because I can guarantee you all these muscles around here, they're like 20 times as strong and big as that one. But that one is it's holding up the whole boat. And we as a body of believers, we need to get stronger for the body, for the family, &gt;&gt; for Christ, &gt;&gt; so we can actually give to what's needed for the rest of the body because this is given it because this is in the situation that it is. I can't do what all that needs to be done. And so I got to take care of that problem. And that's what I'm doing. And it's hard work. I'm telling you, therapy three times a week and I'm barely getting anywhere. I think the I took a survey the last time I did it, it was at 38. The survey I did it before was maybe two weeks ago and it was at 36. And I'm I'm telling you, I'm growing slow and it's hard work, but I'm doing the right thing. &gt;&gt; And I believe it's going to get me where I got to get to because that's my confidence. And so we just need to to grow, continue to grow, grow in our personal lives so we can have a a stronger church. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I know time's up, but can you do one more quote? &gt;&gt; I just want to say this. Anytime that you take the ores out of the water, &gt;&gt; you're going backwards. Brother Ram said, &gt;&gt; "That's right. &gt;&gt; Not your desire to go back in the world." That's not what he's saying. He's saying if you're not willing to fight against the current that's trying to pull you into the world, then the the world is going to automatically pull you there. &gt;&gt; Just like when the on on the ground where you had um a heart that had the things of the world and the things of of the word of God, they were both in there. What happened? The world choked out the word. It it's just the only way that you win with the word is you become one with the word &gt;&gt; and then you're you're an overcomer. So you got to keep roaring oring against the current or else you're going to backslide. You just can't stop believing. Brother Bam said in the message the intervail, he says, "I'd like to see how many of those Nazarines that got sanctified one year and the next year was back sanctified again. I thought he kept it. I thought he c he couldn't go back. Oh, brother. Some men so narrow-minded you you put a pencil between their eyes, it had blind them. That's right. So narrowsighted. Sure. Salvation last as long as faith last. Now I know this really goes against once saved always saved. And I do believe you're sealed to the day of redemption. &gt;&gt; You don't get sealed. Your faith for salvation only lasts as long as you believe. That's why the Bible says today is the day of salvation. Not back then when you got saved, but every day you have to believe. &gt;&gt; And divine healing lasts as long as your faith lasts. Oh, I love that. &gt;&gt; You got to believe for divine healing every day. That's why brother Brandham taught like this. Keep testifying. Keep testifying. Keep believing. Keep holding to because that is what will bring it to pass. He says you that's got to experience 40 years ago. Forget you ever had that experience and go out here tonight and say I don't even believe it and I'm not God's servant no more. Watch how long your experience lasts. Certainly. So what brother Brandham is saying here is you got to maintain your testimony. &gt;&gt; He says when the unclean spirit's gone out of a man, he walks in dry places. He comes back with seven other spirits worse than he was. He enters in by force. Notice that he enters in by force. If the good man of the house ain't there to keep him out, get out of here. You're not allowed to do that. He says, you don't go by your feelings. I never was saved by my feelings. I wasn't saved because I felt good. I'm saved because I met God's promise. That's right. The devil can beat you around and stump on your feelings, but he can't take he can't speak on thus sayeth the Lord and condemn it. I've done what Jesus said. I'm saved tonight because I've met God's requirement. I'm healed tonight. So, I'll just say it like this. In the middle of your trials, have faith that God is with you and stand with a good attitude and God will see you through and teach you more and grow you more because now here's the thing. You're interested in getting rid of the trial. We're all interested in get rid of the trial. God is interested in building character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's two different scenarios going on. So the more you can get on the side with God, the more that you can grow in Christ. Amen. Let's stand together. God bless you. God bless you for your patience. I hope this was somewhat of a blessing or an encouragement to help you see that God is is with you. I believe he is. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that little chorus. He's all I need. He's [Music] all I need. He's all I need. Jesus is all I need. He's all I need. He's all I need. Jesus is all I need. He's all I need. He's all I need. Jesus is all I need. He's all I need. He's all I need. Jesus is all I need. One more time. He's all I need. He's all I need. Jesus is all I need. He's all I need. He's all I need. Jesus is all I need. It is no secret. Amen. It's no secret. [Music] What God can do. What he's done for others, he'll do for you. With arms wide open, he'll pardon you. It is no secret what God can do. It is no secret what God can do. What he's done for others, he'll do for you. With arms wide open, he'll pardon you. It is no secret what God can
