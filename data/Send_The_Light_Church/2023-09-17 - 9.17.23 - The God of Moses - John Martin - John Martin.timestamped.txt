[40:13] these things now in Jesus Christ's name
[40:15] amen
[40:17] amen the Book of Joshua starting with
[40:19] verse number one
[40:22] now after the death of Moses the servant
[40:25] of the Lord it came to pass that the
[40:27] Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun
[40:30] Moses's Minister saying so now this is
[40:34] the Lord speaking
[40:37] unto Joshua Moses my servant is dead
[40:41] now therefore rise and go over this
[40:43] Jordan thou and all this people unto the
[40:46] land which I do give to them even to the
[40:49] children of Israel
[40:51] and every place that the soul of your
[40:53] foot tread upon that I have given you as
[40:58] I said unto Moses
[41:01] this Lebanon given unto the even unto
[41:05] the Great River the river Euphrates all
[41:08] the land of the hit
[41:10] unto the great sea toward the going down
[41:12] of the sun shall be your Coast
[41:15] and there shall not be any man be able
[41:18] to stand before thee all the days of thy
[41:21] life
[41:21] as I was with Moses so I will be with
[41:27] thee
[41:28] I will not fail me
[41:31] for safety
[41:33] amen God bless you you may be seated
[41:37] we want to entitle this
[41:40] little service this morning
[41:42] the god of Moses
[41:45] the god of Moses and and as a subject
[41:50] as I was with Moses so I will be with
[41:53] thee
[41:54] amen now this is a precious precious
[41:57] promise
[41:59] how many has ever put yourself
[42:02] in this scripture
[42:05] when you read it that God was going to
[42:08] be with you as he was with Moses
[42:11] amen amen because I believe this is a
[42:15] promise
[42:17] for all of us
[42:19] and
[42:23] we need
[42:25] there's just certain times we just know
[42:27] that we we
[42:29] we need God with us because what we're
[42:32] facing and what we're dealing with it's
[42:34] not easy it's very fearful
[42:38] um
[42:39] and
[42:42] fear is a real thing
[42:44] and
[42:46] courage is not an absence of fear
[42:53] fear can be in the same room where
[42:55] there's faith
[42:59] and in fact the Bible says that he
[43:03] uh prepares a table for us in the
[43:06] presence of our enemies and we know our
[43:07] greatest enemy is ourselves so we're
[43:10] we're stuck with it we're we're dealing
[43:12] with someone who who caves in to
[43:16] lukewarmness and caves into fear and
[43:19] caves into worry and caves into what's
[43:21] going to happen but we serve almighty
[43:24] God today
[43:25] and greater is he that's in us than he
[43:28] that's in the world
[43:30] now when Moses died he needed a leader
[43:32] to take his people over to the promised
[43:35] land
[43:37] and God needed someone who was going to
[43:40] be steadfast with his word
[43:43] someone who wouldn't be shaken by trials
[43:46] the trials that they were going to face
[43:48] because they were going to face some
[43:50] heavy duty trials
[43:52] someone who had a life full of faith in
[43:56] other words when you go for a leader you
[43:59] go for someone who's been faithful
[44:03] when God's thinking about who's going to
[44:05] lead in the millennium
[44:07] he's looking for those who've been
[44:09] faithful in the little things that I'll
[44:12] make you ruler
[44:13] with many
[44:16] over many things so God wasn't uh gonna
[44:20] look for someone who was just up and
[44:24] down all the time
[44:25] God doesn't use flaky people
[44:28] it doesn't use unstable people he
[44:31] doesn't use lukewarm people God uses
[44:35] people who've made up their minds
[44:38] whose lives prove stability and
[44:41] faithfulness to the word of God not to a
[44:43] church not to a Creed but to the word of
[44:46] God
[44:49] you could tell that God was
[44:51] was with Joshua
[44:54] the same guy that was with Moses was now
[44:57] with Joshua and he said here in Joshua
[45:00] 24 I'm just going to read it we're not
[45:02] going to really be script going through
[45:04] a lot of scriptures today
[45:06] but we want to stay in this verse
[45:08] chapter if we could
[45:10] but he said now therefore fear the lord
[45:13] and serve him in sincerity and Truth
[45:15] Joshua is saying this to the people and
[45:18] put away the gods of your fathers
[45:21] which your father served on the other
[45:23] side of the flood and in Egypt and serve
[45:25] ye the Lord so God brought us out of the
[45:28] world
[45:29] not just to go to church but to serve
[45:33] him
[45:34] amen and if it seemed evil unto you to
[45:37] serve the Lord in other words if it's
[45:38] too much to ask to be faithful to uh all
[45:42] of his word then choose you this day
[45:44] whom you will serve
[45:46] whether the gods which your father
[45:48] served uh that were on the other side of
[45:51] the flood or the gods of the amorites in
[45:53] whose Lane you dwell but as for me
[45:56] and my house
[45:58] we will serve the Lord
[46:02] no you got Catholics serving the lord
[46:04] you got methodists
[46:07] you got Baptist you got a bunch of
[46:10] Independents you got all different
[46:12] people serving the lord the way they
[46:15] want to serve the Lord but I'm not
[46:17] talking about that neither was Joshua
[46:22] this is the only book that tells you how
[46:25] to serve the Lord
[46:29] you may about a line up with one two
[46:31] three or four but when when
[46:34] if it seemed evil
[46:38] to serve the whole book
[46:40] then you choose who you're going to
[46:42] serve but I'm telling you this Pulpit
[46:45] this gospel this message this church
[46:48] believes in serving the book from cover
[46:50] to cover we got church order that tells
[46:53] us how to act in church
[46:57] you look at it if you don't agree with
[46:58] it that's fine for you but have respect
[47:01] to the house of God have respect to this
[47:04] message have respect to this word
[47:06] [Applause]
[47:12] but as for me
[47:14] in my church we will serve the Lord
[47:18] as for me in my house we will serve the
[47:20] Lord as for me and my vessel as for me
[47:22] and my wife as for me and my children
[47:25] we will serve the Lord the way he wants
[47:28] it not the way I want to the way he
[47:30] wants it and I'll tell you the way he
[47:32] wants it hurts yes it's painful
[47:35] try to pick up a cross and follow it it
[47:37] ain't easy
[47:39] churches are full people who want to
[47:41] serve God their own way they're going to
[47:43] give what they want and not give what
[47:45] they don't want
[47:47] they don't want to serve them with
[47:49] suffering they want to serve them easily
[47:53] that's their choice
[47:56] we're choosing to follow the word
[48:00] now if God was going to be with Joshua
[48:02] just like he was with Moses let's just
[48:05] take a look at the life of Moses for
[48:07] just a second we know at his birth he
[48:09] was a proper child the Bible tells us in
[48:11] other words he was a predestinated seed
[48:14] of God that God was going to use and God
[48:17] was always with him had his hand on him
[48:20] all his life
[48:22] and and God allowed Moses to try to
[48:27] deliver
[48:27] uh his people or God's people uh in his
[48:32] own way
[48:34] and it just caused a big problem didn't
[48:37] it
[48:39] and I just wonder how many times we've
[48:42] tried we knew what the right thing was
[48:44] God had told us just like God had told
[48:46] Moses that he was going to be a
[48:48] deliverer of the people and he tried to
[48:50] go in there and handle the situation his
[48:53] way and it just caused such a fear when
[48:57] it failed
[48:59] and I just wondered today how many times
[49:01] we've tried to we knew it was right we
[49:05] try to handle a situation without the
[49:07] wisdom of God without the leadership of
[49:10] God and it turned into be a big mess
[49:18] I don't want to handle things like Peter
[49:20] did I go fishing
[49:24] no I I want the leadership of God in my
[49:27] life and I'll tell you this is the
[49:29] wonderful thing as I was with Moses so
[49:31] shall I be with you you can have
[49:33] confidence that the leadership of God is
[49:35] right there for you if you're willing to
[49:37] pay the price and get into the spirit
[49:39] because my God he is a spirit and they
[49:42] that worship Him must worship him in the
[49:44] spirit and the truth you know we get so
[49:47] carnal sometimes we want to pick up the
[49:48] newspaper we want to turn on our phone
[49:50] we want to look and just have something
[49:53] naturally come out to tell us what we
[49:55] need to do to help us with our situation
[49:57] but that ain't the god that that that
[49:59] Joshua and Moses was serving these men
[50:02] got on their knees and they spent time
[50:04] on their knees and they got a hold of
[50:06] the god that led their life
[50:09] we're trying to modernize God trying to
[50:12] make him something different than what
[50:13] he is he is the same yesterday today and
[50:16] forever
[50:17] we're changing but he ain't changing
[50:20] we can count on God
[50:25] sometimes you know we make the stupidest
[50:28] decisions
[50:31] like I'm too busy to pray
[50:35] I'm too busy to read too busy to go to
[50:37] church too busy to help build the
[50:39] kingdom of God to be too busy to live
[50:42] for others
[50:43] you know I have great intense
[50:45] I'm trying to achieve that I'm going to
[50:48] help my family's future
[50:54] too busy for God
[50:57] trying to build your family's future
[51:00] just think about that
[51:03] I'm gonna build my future outside of
[51:07] what God wants me to do
[51:12] you know it may not turn out good
[51:17] you gotta
[51:18] plan it right put God in the middle make
[51:22] sure it's his leadership and not you
[51:24] wanting to do something
[51:26] we need the leadership of God in every
[51:28] aspect of our life
[51:30] and so that just don't happen by coming
[51:33] to church you've got to develop it you
[51:35] got to take the word that you're hearing
[51:36] at church and get honest about applying
[51:39] it in your personal lives
[51:41] I'm going to do this I heard you speak
[51:43] and that was for me and I'm going to
[51:45] start doing it and this is how you
[51:48] develop a relationship with God
[51:51] you know we've gotten to the point where
[51:52] we think we're close to God because we
[51:55] feel good
[51:56] so if we come to church and we don't
[51:58] feel good our relationship didn't get
[52:00] developed
[52:05] it's not about how we feel it's about
[52:06] how we believe
[52:09] and we're Believers of the whole word
[52:13] no
[52:14] God allowed Moses to go through some
[52:16] strange things has he ever had you go
[52:19] through some strange things
[52:21] and these strange things sometimes it
[52:23] seems like a waste of time
[52:26] like he spent 40 years in the wilderness
[52:29] just like what
[52:33] wasn't helping the people
[52:35] they weren't getting any closer to the
[52:37] promised land
[52:39] and he was stuck out there all by
[52:41] himself
[52:42] seemed like a waste of time real strange
[52:46] but you know it was what he needed to be
[52:50] a better leader
[52:54] because he still had this um gonna do it
[52:58] and it took so much time to get rid of
[53:01] it it wasn't just coming to church one
[53:03] time in here and you know you need to
[53:05] get rid of your intellect
[53:08] no he had to go through a lot of Trials
[53:12] I don't think he was born the meekest
[53:14] man
[53:15] because meekness is character
[53:18] and it's not a gift I think he had to go
[53:20] through trials out there
[53:22] to become so humble that God could use
[53:26] him
[53:27] you know I believe God speaks to us all
[53:29] a lot
[53:31] but we don't we don't hear
[53:34] because we're so in our our our Humanity
[53:39] and I not that God can't speak to our
[53:42] carnality
[53:44] but there's he expects more imagine
[53:48] imagine
[53:50] you having a child
[53:52] or imagine anybody having a child and
[53:55] they never had an expectation for them
[53:57] to grow up will you just stay on that
[54:00] three-wheeler I don't care if you're 24
[54:03] years old or not just stay on that
[54:05] three-wheeler
[54:07] tricycle
[54:09] no one would do and if you saw anybody
[54:11] do that you'd look at them and you'd say
[54:12] that's strange
[54:15] God expects us to grow up
[54:19] so these strange things are
[54:22] are really not that strange
[54:25] no it's no different for Joshua he was
[54:27] in the wilderness for 40 years too
[54:31] you ever think about that
[54:34] for what reason
[54:36] I mean he wasn't being bad
[54:40] he was the one that said we're more than
[54:42] able to take the land
[54:48] he was a with 40 Years of a bunch of
[54:52] complainers
[54:55] going through things but you know I
[54:58] don't think any of that time was in vain
[55:01] for Joshua it was not in vain you know
[55:04] what was in vain for the complainers
[55:07] the murmurs that's what was in vain for
[55:11] but not for Joshua because all things
[55:13] work together for the good to them to
[55:16] love the Lord and who are called
[55:18] according to his purpose
[55:20] Joshua's being called
[55:23] if Joshua could be faithful for 40 years
[55:26] sitting in your church or a congregation
[55:28] for all murmurs and complainers God
[55:31] could trust them
[55:33] God could use them
[55:36] I love this word
[55:37] as I was with Moses so I will be with
[55:40] thee
[55:42] Peter said beloved think it not strange
[55:45] concerning the fiery trials which is to
[55:48] try you as though some strange thing has
[55:50] happened to you but rejoice in as much
[55:53] as you are partakers of Christ suffering
[55:55] that when his glory shall be revealed
[55:57] you may be glad with exceeding Joy
[56:03] I believe the god of Abraham Isaac Jacob
[56:06] Moses Joshua was building his character
[56:10] in them to hard trials
[56:13] I believe that
[56:15] so when we think as I was with Moses so
[56:17] shall I be with you don't think you're
[56:20] going to get a flowery bed of ease
[56:23] if you want God to be with you just like
[56:25] he was with Joshua you may have to go
[56:28] through a Wilderness experience
[56:30] it's okay
[56:32] God don't do anything in vain there's a
[56:34] purpose in it it's going to work out for
[56:37] your character
[56:40] to a Believer nothing happens by chance
[56:46] in the message things are that are to be
[56:48] brother Brian says you were all
[56:51] pre-planned by God
[56:55] nothing happens by chance with God
[56:59] he knows all about it it's all
[57:01] pre-planned it's planned for many
[57:04] generations back
[57:06] so that you could be here tonight
[57:10] I could say so you could be here this
[57:12] morning
[57:16] in a message this day this scripture is
[57:18] fulfilled brother Brian says and I
[57:20] thought God
[57:22] why did you do that
[57:26] why would there be such a thing now
[57:31] that's me feeling you know to see what
[57:34] it was all about because I think nothing
[57:38] happens by chance we all sit there and
[57:41] we we question why is this happening why
[57:43] is this going on but we got to conclude
[57:47] God's got it all worked out it's been
[57:50] pre-planned he knew it they think about
[57:53] this remember that when you first gave
[57:55] your heart to God and the the blood had
[57:58] just covered you and all your sins were
[58:01] gone and you was free as a bird you were
[58:03] happy you were actually happy
[58:05] remember how happy you were you're full
[58:07] of joy
[58:10] it wasn't like God couldn't see the
[58:12] trial that you were gonna it was gonna
[58:13] happen five years down the road
[58:16] he saw it he still set you free
[58:20] he still blessed you he's still got an
[58:23] expected end for you what happened
[58:25] between the beginning and end it really
[58:27] doesn't matter is what the end counts
[58:33] we've got to start trusting God more for
[58:35] our lives in our lives
[58:38] and if you don't want to do that I'll
[58:39] just say it like this you're serving the
[58:41] wrong God because there's only two
[58:44] now God proved the children of Israel
[58:46] just like he proved job
[58:48] right
[58:49] put them through those trials
[58:52] now job didn't murmur and complained but
[58:54] the children of Israel did see they just
[58:56] same trial same test one was faithful
[59:02] one was caught up in his own carnality
[59:06] one group
[59:07] God proved Joshua and Caleb just like he
[59:10] proved Moses
[59:12] and God is proving you
[59:16] just like he's
[59:17] just like he's proved everybody else
[59:19] every every man of God every Son of God
[59:21] must be when he first comes to God he
[59:23] must be proved and tried I mean if
[59:26] you're going to choose a deacon for a
[59:27] church Paul in the wisdom of God are
[59:30] telling Timothy or Titus one of them
[59:33] that that he must be proved first right
[59:37] you don't take a novice you don't take
[59:39] someone that you don't know if they're
[59:40] up and down you take someone who's been
[59:43] proved
[59:46] as I was with Moses so I will be with
[59:49] thee proving you proving your faith
[59:52] proving your trust proving Your Love
[59:54] proving that you'll be there no matter
[59:56] what
[59:56] [Music]
[1:00:00] did you ever consider just how many
[1:00:03] things Joshua and Caleb had to overcome
[1:00:06] during the 40 years in the wilderness
[1:00:10] The Message Church
[1:00:12] was filled with a mixed multitude the
[1:00:15] Bible says
[1:00:17] there were a lot of make-believers in
[1:00:19] the church let's just face it
[1:00:21] I don't know how you you look at one
[1:00:24] another in the church but you shouldn't
[1:00:25] be surprised at anything
[1:00:27] come on
[1:00:32] you know there were some just all acting
[1:00:34] spiritual but they couldn't overcome
[1:00:35] things in their personal life
[1:00:39] borderline believers
[1:00:41] having a form of godliness but no power
[1:00:44] to overcome
[1:00:47] there were make-believers unbelievers
[1:00:49] intellectual Believers there were
[1:00:51] complainers there were murmurs
[1:00:55] they were hearing Joshua and Caleb were
[1:00:57] hearing things like we should just stop
[1:00:59] going to church
[1:01:01] nothing's changing it's a waste of time
[1:01:04] we've been wandering out here for 40
[1:01:06] years
[1:01:08] well it might have been 20 and then 25
[1:01:10] and you know what I'm saying
[1:01:13] they had to hear this stuff all the time
[1:01:17] and when they went to church who do you
[1:01:19] think they were sitting next to
[1:01:25] you you think Joshua and Caleb were
[1:01:27] sitting next to somebody that was trying
[1:01:29] to tell them yeah we can make it be
[1:01:32] encouraged
[1:01:33] no
[1:01:34] they were sitting next to somebody see
[1:01:37] the way he's talking right now Moses
[1:01:39] can't even
[1:01:43] negativity all around them day in and
[1:01:46] day out
[1:01:49] as I was with Moses so shall I be with
[1:01:53] you
[1:01:57] well God gave Moses an opportunity hey
[1:02:01] let's just destroy these people get it
[1:02:03] over with and I'll make you
[1:02:06] we'll just get a new group to people
[1:02:07] together
[1:02:09] so grateful that Christ was in Moses
[1:02:17] as I was
[1:02:20] I was waning
[1:02:24] Joshua's a leader
[1:02:28] and he was faithful not just one week
[1:02:32] one month amen one year
[1:02:35] the man was faithful
[1:02:38] that's what I want to be
[1:02:40] I want to be a faithful servant of God
[1:02:45] I don't care if the only thing I got to
[1:02:47] take care of is one person I want to be
[1:02:49] a faithful servant of God
[1:02:52] not an up and down yo-yo and you Rubik's
[1:02:55] Cube you don't know how it's going to
[1:02:57] end up when it's all over some tangled
[1:02:59] up mess
[1:03:00] God is looking for believers that can
[1:03:03] stand the test
[1:03:06] there we had a lot of you know there was
[1:03:08] a lot of weird people in the message
[1:03:11] probably no different than today
[1:03:14] people with their own private
[1:03:16] interpretations of the word
[1:03:18] their own ideas
[1:03:20] well this is where Moses got off
[1:03:24] this is where Joshua was off
[1:03:26] come on
[1:03:28] we've all been tempted by the devil that
[1:03:31] really ain't what brother Brana meant
[1:03:35] come on
[1:03:37] oh that's not really what God meant when
[1:03:39] he said that
[1:03:44] I mean that's what the devil told Eve
[1:03:50] he took the same word and tried to get
[1:03:52] Jesus out of the content of the word of
[1:03:54] God using the word
[1:03:56] you think he's not going to come to you
[1:03:58] and try to get you off the word
[1:04:01] just a little bit and before you know
[1:04:03] you just missed church one time and it's
[1:04:05] a lot easier to miss it twice
[1:04:08] don't pay your ties one time you know
[1:04:11] it's a little easier to Let It Go and
[1:04:13] Let It Go that's the workings of the
[1:04:15] devil but you know what God I say I
[1:04:18] don't care what's happening in your life
[1:04:19] you today you and God are a majority and
[1:04:22] you can remain faithful in this mess
[1:04:26] I don't care about the politicians I
[1:04:29] don't care about the world I don't care
[1:04:30] what's happening anywhere
[1:04:32] it's you and God you and God that's all
[1:04:35] that matters when it's time for a
[1:04:37] Rapture it's just you and God it ain't
[1:04:39] you and your family you and your church
[1:04:40] you and your pastor you and your priest
[1:04:44] it ain't even you and your knowledge
[1:04:47] and even though what you know
[1:04:49] it's your relationship with God a matter
[1:04:52] on that morning
[1:04:55] and to me if you're wasting your time
[1:04:58] now developing the important catching
[1:05:02] away I don't think God is after that
[1:05:04] kind of wife
[1:05:06] come on now I don't think he's after a
[1:05:09] bride who wants to waste their life why
[1:05:12] they're living and then hope at the end
[1:05:14] well you know I'm the thief on the cross
[1:05:16] well you're the thief on the cross but
[1:05:18] you had 30 years to be living it
[1:05:21] all right man
[1:05:24] well God is looking for faithfulness
[1:05:26] today and I don't care if the Rapture
[1:05:28] ain't happening till tomorrow
[1:05:30] today is the day of salvation today is
[1:05:32] the day we serve them for me and my
[1:05:34] house I will serve the Lord
[1:05:40] and there were people in the in the
[1:05:42] church trying to manipulate
[1:05:46] how come there's no amens with that
[1:05:50] they were trying to persuade others to
[1:05:52] go back to Egypt
[1:05:54] hey let's go back
[1:05:56] it was easier
[1:05:58] why stay here when we can have it easier
[1:06:04] to me that's manipulation
[1:06:08] trying to manipulate others
[1:06:11] you know if you just stay with the word
[1:06:14] I love
[1:06:16] I really love the prophet of course we
[1:06:18] all love the prophet
[1:06:21] but he had such a love for the word
[1:06:24] because the word in God is the same amen
[1:06:28] amen and he said one time he said if if
[1:06:32] I didn't have faith to make some promise
[1:06:35] come to pass
[1:06:37] he said I would never stand in the way
[1:06:39] of somebody else
[1:06:41] who had Faith to make it come to pass
[1:06:44] the word is our absolute
[1:06:47] amen we stay with the word and we
[1:06:49] believe that word
[1:06:51] now Joshua and Caleb didn't allow the
[1:06:55] negativity of the church to stand in
[1:06:58] their way did you notice that for 40
[1:07:00] years they had to hear all this stuff
[1:07:03] but they had a different Spirit that's
[1:07:06] what made them different
[1:07:08] they didn't put headphones on they never
[1:07:10] said I'm not going to listen to that
[1:07:12] person I'm not going to do this I'm not
[1:07:14] no they didn't do that
[1:07:16] you know what they had they spent some
[1:07:18] time on their knees and got another
[1:07:20] spirit
[1:07:21] they got another spirit so when they're
[1:07:24] talking to the wrong Spirits they're not
[1:07:27] affected
[1:07:30] they're not bothered
[1:07:33] because the scripture tells me that
[1:07:35] greater is he that's in me
[1:07:38] then all the complainers
[1:07:41] then all the negativity
[1:07:44] now you might think by this sermon
[1:07:46] that I'm calling you murders and
[1:07:48] complainers but I'm really not
[1:07:51] but you know their Spirits out there
[1:07:54] and they kind of sneak in conversations
[1:07:59] but we're of another spirit
[1:08:01] another spirit
[1:08:05] well brother John I've been dealing with
[1:08:07] this thing for 13 years
[1:08:11] did you can you read in the Bible
[1:08:13] brother Mark where Joshua and Caleb said
[1:08:15] that
[1:08:17] they never said that at the end of it
[1:08:19] all they just said give me my mountain
[1:08:22] [Laughter]
[1:08:25] I I've stood at my poster Duty for 40
[1:08:28] years listening to that stuff but I
[1:08:31] believe in the promise of God
[1:08:38] they never wanted to leave
[1:08:42] the church
[1:08:44] they never said
[1:08:46] they never said brother Ron
[1:08:49] why don't you and me go over there and
[1:08:52] start another church because these
[1:08:54] people
[1:08:56] are murmurs and complainers
[1:08:59] they didn't have that spirit
[1:09:02] you want to know why because God is Not
[1:09:04] Afraid
[1:09:06] of anybody murmuring or complaining or
[1:09:10] problems
[1:09:11] he's still going to bring up a bride
[1:09:14] in the midst of this world that we're
[1:09:16] living in there is still going to be a
[1:09:19] Joshua and Caleb in this age that's
[1:09:21] going to live the life no matter what's
[1:09:23] happening at work no matter what's
[1:09:25] happening in the neighborhood no matter
[1:09:27] what's going on
[1:09:29] amen and that's really who he wants to
[1:09:32] be with somebody that can stand the test
[1:09:36] so I don't look at things as problems
[1:09:39] I look at things as opportunities to
[1:09:41] serve God in a greater way
[1:09:43] to give him praise when it's very hard
[1:09:46] to do when all around you you think
[1:09:49] about it Joshua and Caleb had another
[1:09:51] Spirit everybody was at home
[1:09:54] oh I got to get them going to church
[1:09:57] and then Joshua and Caleb were like I
[1:10:00] can't wait to get there I can't get I
[1:10:02] can't wait to praise the lord I can't
[1:10:04] wait to eat on the word of God I know
[1:10:06] it's something fresh for me
[1:10:08] there's the difference
[1:10:10] it's another spirit inside
[1:10:16] this scripture to me goes so well for
[1:10:18] Joshua and Caleb who had to suffer for
[1:10:20] 40 years and let us not be weary in
[1:10:23] well-doing
[1:10:24] for in due season we shall reap if we
[1:10:28] faint not
[1:10:30] and look at this next verse verse 10 as
[1:10:33] we have therefore opportunity let us do
[1:10:37] good unto all men
[1:10:40] especially unto them who are of the
[1:10:43] household of faith
[1:10:45] I'll tell you there's enough in this
[1:10:47] word to keep me busy
[1:10:51] to live the word is the hardest thing
[1:10:55] to quote it
[1:10:57] is
[1:10:58] probably the easiest
[1:11:00] honestly
[1:11:03] but to love it enough to live it
[1:11:06] is the hardest thing
[1:11:11] God help us
[1:11:14] now they knew they couldn't convert all
[1:11:16] these unbelievers
[1:11:18] right you can't convert
[1:11:21] a wrong seed
[1:11:24] you can't the law as every seed brings
[1:11:26] forth of its own kind
[1:11:29] so they didn't spend their time trying
[1:11:31] to convert the unbelieving seed
[1:11:34] but here's what's important for 40 years
[1:11:37] they remain faithful and I cannot stress
[1:11:39] this enough we give so many reasons why
[1:11:42] we're not going to try
[1:11:45] you know why we're just not going to put
[1:11:46] forth any effort why it just isn't why
[1:11:49] it's just a waste of time waste
[1:11:51] you know all you're doing is proving
[1:11:54] what seed you are
[1:11:57] you're proving what spirit
[1:11:59] is in you
[1:12:02] and I don't mean to make this strong but
[1:12:04] I want this message
[1:12:06] to wake up to Joshua and Caleb's here
[1:12:09] I do
[1:12:10] you know this layout to see in spirit is
[1:12:13] is really for the world it ain't for the
[1:12:15] church
[1:12:18] they were a witness to the generation
[1:12:21] they lived in
[1:12:23] they were a witness that God honors
[1:12:26] faith in his word you notice God didn't
[1:12:29] say you know what Joshua I don't like
[1:12:31] the way you talk I don't like the way
[1:12:34] you sing I don't like the way you dress
[1:12:36] I don't like the way that you
[1:12:39] smirk
[1:12:42] you know I'm going to go over here and
[1:12:44] get one of these murmurs and complainers
[1:12:46] they're more talented
[1:12:54] God loves faithfulness
[1:12:56] to the word of God
[1:12:58] that needs to become a priority in our
[1:13:00] life I'm saying this I don't know where
[1:13:04] you're at and I know we've got some
[1:13:05] faithful people in this church and I'll
[1:13:07] tell you
[1:13:08] I
[1:13:09] I bow with respect I honor with respect
[1:13:13] I
[1:13:15] I look to you as an example for me
[1:13:18] faithfulness
[1:13:19] is important
[1:13:21] it's in Well Done thou good and faithful
[1:13:26] servant that's what God is looking for
[1:13:28] because anybody can Sprint
[1:13:32] anybody can Sprint from here to the road
[1:13:36] we might have to
[1:13:38] push sister Johnson
[1:13:41] but anybody can Sprint from here to
[1:13:43] there
[1:13:44] but try running from here to Fenton
[1:13:49] you need longevity
[1:13:52] sir amen you need to learn to build up
[1:13:54] muscles and build up the lungs and and
[1:13:57] and work on it on a daily basis
[1:14:02] that's what God's looking for
[1:14:04] a faithful wife without spot without
[1:14:07] wrinkle that wouldn't surprise me if
[1:14:10] there's just going to only be a few
[1:14:11] people saved
[1:14:16] Jesus said it would just be a few
[1:14:19] do you know Paul said it
[1:14:21] Peter said it Jude said it
[1:14:25] brother by Adam said it'd be like one in
[1:14:26] a million
[1:14:27] he even brought up that it would just be
[1:14:30] like Joshua and Caleb
[1:14:32] out of the 1.8 million that came out
[1:14:38] hmm
[1:14:41] the Bible says when Once the
[1:14:44] long-suffering of God waited in the days
[1:14:46] of Noah while the ark Was preparing were
[1:14:50] in few
[1:14:51] that is eight Souls were saved by water
[1:14:58] eight Souls I like how he says Souls
[1:15:03] brother John it may be just me and my
[1:15:05] family going
[1:15:08] well
[1:15:09] it may be
[1:15:12] but it may not be
[1:15:15] it could
[1:15:17] but it has a lot less to do with our
[1:15:19] family and a lot more to do with his
[1:15:21] family
[1:15:24] I don't mean to be stepping in any shoes
[1:15:25] here
[1:15:27] but it's about his family that's who's
[1:15:29] going to heaven not my family
[1:15:32] his family
[1:15:36] when the family of Jesus went looking
[1:15:38] for Jesus
[1:15:39] they found him talking to the people
[1:15:42] and one said unto him Behold thy mother
[1:15:44] and thy brother and they stand without
[1:15:46] Desiring to speak with thee
[1:15:49] and he answered and said unto him that
[1:15:52] told him
[1:15:53] who is my mother
[1:15:56] and who is my brethren
[1:15:59] and he stretched forth
[1:16:01] his hand toward the his disciples
[1:16:04] and said behold
[1:16:07] my mother
[1:16:08] and behold my brother
[1:16:15] I love this verse for whosoever shall do
[1:16:19] the will of My Father which is in heaven
[1:16:21] the same as my brother and my sister and
[1:16:25] my mother
[1:16:26] so who's the real family that he's
[1:16:28] coming for
[1:16:30] sure we want our loved ones to make it
[1:16:32] sure we want our family to make it but
[1:16:35] I'm telling you we need to be focused on
[1:16:37] doing the word of God and if you want
[1:16:38] your family to make it you need to get
[1:16:40] them serious about the word of God
[1:16:45] well brother John I'm afraid to talk to
[1:16:47] them because they're just going to turn
[1:16:48] me down this is what I say to you take
[1:16:50] that time that you'd be talking to them
[1:16:52] get on on your knees in the prayer
[1:16:54] closet and call their name out to God
[1:16:57] and get serious about applying the token
[1:17:07] what's most important is that we need to
[1:17:09] get serious about doing the will of God
[1:17:11] personally no matter what is happening
[1:17:14] in our church in our family or in the
[1:17:17] world it's about us and God
[1:17:20] we need to make a decision for me
[1:17:24] I'm going to serve the Lord now of
[1:17:26] course we got family members that are up
[1:17:28] and down in and out
[1:17:30] they haven't made a decision
[1:17:35] the more that they can see a
[1:17:37] steadfastness in your life
[1:17:39] the more they can see faithfulness in
[1:17:41] you
[1:17:42] the more they can see the love of God in
[1:17:44] you
[1:17:45] the more they can see the word
[1:17:46] manifested in you the better chance they
[1:17:50] have
[1:17:55] how many love the word this morning
[1:17:58] as I was with Moses so I will be with
[1:18:01] thee
[1:18:04] Moses had a burning bush experience with
[1:18:07] God
[1:18:08] you know what it did it changed his life
[1:18:11] forever that one experience changed his
[1:18:14] life forever
[1:18:16] God is still looking to have that same
[1:18:18] experience with some of us
[1:18:22] we don't want to know God just from a a
[1:18:24] textbook just from being able to
[1:18:27] intellectually read the Bible and know
[1:18:29] what the words mean
[1:18:32] because we can know the word
[1:18:35] just like Lucifer knows the word
[1:18:38] and not follow it
[1:18:41] or pick and choose when he's going to
[1:18:43] make it look like he's following it
[1:18:46] come on it's true
[1:18:51] now the very first thing that
[1:18:53] that God demanded when
[1:18:57] Moses was having this experience
[1:19:00] how many remembers what God
[1:19:03] what God manifested what God was
[1:19:07] what God demanded from Moses
[1:19:10] when when the burning bush happened how
[1:19:12] many how many no
[1:19:14] thank you praise God praise God praise
[1:19:17] God he demanded reverence
[1:19:20] he demanded respect right off the bat
[1:19:24] don't come near this place
[1:19:26] take your shoes off
[1:19:29] you can't just approach me any way you
[1:19:31] want to
[1:19:33] that's what this experience does for the
[1:19:36] believer
[1:19:37] it it puts the boundaries of the
[1:19:40] relationship with God reverence and
[1:19:43] respect
[1:19:45] who does God dwell with
[1:19:53] yeah he dwells in the high and lofty
[1:19:55] place the holy place
[1:19:57] but he dwells with them that are humble
[1:19:59] and a contrite spirit
[1:20:02] not someone says I could just come into
[1:20:04] church any way I want to with any old
[1:20:06] attitude it doesn't really matter what's
[1:20:08] going on
[1:20:10] you can do that
[1:20:13] I could have meet God
[1:20:17] I don't respect that
[1:20:19] he'll never respect that can you imagine
[1:20:22] having that Pillar of Fire experience
[1:20:26] and right in the middle of that
[1:20:28] experience
[1:20:30] Moses says can you wait just a minute I
[1:20:33] have to go and check some I just have to
[1:20:44] you get in the presence of God you're
[1:20:45] just like
[1:20:47] sometimes you're just froze
[1:20:49] you can't move you don't want to move
[1:20:54] well brother John what if I have to you
[1:20:57] know what you need to think of these
[1:20:59] things before church you need to prepare
[1:21:02] because this the sanctuary is the place
[1:21:06] we meet God that's what it's for it's
[1:21:08] not a place of Fellowship not a place
[1:21:10] that we come and talk about God our
[1:21:12] feelings our emotions what we think our
[1:21:15] opinions it's a place that we reverence
[1:21:18] that we hear from God through whoever
[1:21:20] stands behind this pulpit
[1:21:27] we need
[1:21:28] to have more of the experience of the
[1:21:31] pillar fire
[1:21:35] we got too many just serving God in
[1:21:38] their own way
[1:21:43] you know God the Bible tells us that God
[1:21:45] resists the proud
[1:21:48] he just resists them
[1:21:50] the arrogant
[1:21:52] the I'm going to do it my way the Frank
[1:21:55] Sinatra way
[1:22:01] that's okay
[1:22:03] you don't have to do it God's way you
[1:22:07] don't
[1:22:08] you need to choose who you're going to
[1:22:10] serve
[1:22:12] but for me and my house we will serve
[1:22:15] the Lord
[1:22:18] we need to take what we hear in church
[1:22:21] go home
[1:22:22] and talk to our children about what was
[1:22:24] heard
[1:22:26] we need to talk to our wives our
[1:22:28] husbands
[1:22:30] and we need to start
[1:22:32] bringing more respect to the house of
[1:22:35] God
[1:22:36] look brother Branham says when they when
[1:22:38] people come into this your church come
[1:22:40] into the message they do not know this
[1:22:43] stuff
[1:22:44] they have to be taught
[1:22:47] and it's not fun it's not enjoyable it's
[1:22:49] it's not like
[1:22:52] you know going in and laughing and
[1:22:54] enjoying some
[1:22:56] thing like that
[1:22:58] but it's not about us and it's not about
[1:23:01] them
[1:23:02] it's about what God expects
[1:23:06] and and we need to teach this to one
[1:23:08] another
[1:23:10] and the quicker we learn I believe the
[1:23:13] more the quicker God will honor the
[1:23:15] atmosphere that we create
[1:23:18] well look we are only a combination of
[1:23:22] what happens in our home
[1:23:24] that's all we are
[1:23:26] how whatever life we're living out there
[1:23:28] that's what we are when we come here
[1:23:31] so if you're living a wholly consecrated
[1:23:33] life at home and you bring that here
[1:23:36] you're creating that atmosphere
[1:23:39] but you go home and you're you're
[1:23:41] swearing and you're yelling and you're
[1:23:43] you're fighting and you have this I
[1:23:45] don't care attitude and you you come
[1:23:48] here at the church
[1:23:51] you're bringing that with you
[1:23:53] well brother John I said I'm sorry but
[1:23:56] you're going right back home and doing
[1:23:57] it again and again and again
[1:24:00] we gotta turn
[1:24:03] make a turn
[1:24:05] brother John why are you preaching like
[1:24:06] this
[1:24:07] I don't know why I'm preaching like this
[1:24:09] I couldn't tell you it's not in my nose
[1:24:11] [Laughter]
[1:24:16] uh we do need to have reverence and
[1:24:19] respect we certainly do
[1:24:24] I think sometimes we come into church
[1:24:25] with a vasty spirit
[1:24:31] lacking reverence
[1:24:34] right in the middle of worship
[1:24:38] when God is being honored through praise
[1:24:40] right in the middle when God is speaking
[1:24:44] I just can't imagine Moses right in the
[1:24:47] middle of everything just saying wait a
[1:24:48] minute I gotta check on the flock
[1:24:53] I mean understand this is not a place
[1:24:56] that's a man-made Church where we're
[1:24:58] coming to hear Brother John do not come
[1:25:00] to hear Brother John do not come to a
[1:25:02] man-made church this building may be
[1:25:04] made by man and a man has to get up here
[1:25:06] but God is authoring what's going on
[1:25:09] and we've got to separate the two
[1:25:15] how else are we going to get anything
[1:25:17] from God if we're sitting here always in
[1:25:19] the natural
[1:25:28] if God is going to be like you like he
[1:25:30] was with Moses you have to have a face
[1:25:32] to face experience with God
[1:25:35] not just
[1:25:37] not just an experience
[1:25:40] that'll pour my spirit out on All Flesh
[1:25:42] not that experience
[1:25:44] I'm talking about experience that
[1:25:45] changes you
[1:25:48] right
[1:25:50] Moses when he went to try to do a right
[1:25:53] thing with his own efforts
[1:25:56] he fled for fear at his post to duty
[1:26:01] but when
[1:26:04] he had this experience with God
[1:26:08] he was now able to face pharaoh
[1:26:12] wasn't scared of death
[1:26:15] wasn't scared of the unknown the unknown
[1:26:17] he threw a state down his stick down I I
[1:26:21] don't know if he had any idea that The
[1:26:23] Magicians were going to do that either
[1:26:26] right but he wasn't scared
[1:26:32] because he had that constant
[1:26:34] communication with God after that after
[1:26:37] that that initial experience that that
[1:26:40] experience with the the burning bush he
[1:26:43] came back and he talked to God all the
[1:26:44] time
[1:26:46] that's what that experience does for you
[1:26:48] it develops a relationship that you have
[1:26:50] with God on a regular basis well brother
[1:26:52] John I just don't seem to have that okay
[1:26:54] we'll get serious about having it
[1:26:57] because if God is going to be with you
[1:26:58] like he was with with uh Joshua you have
[1:27:01] to have that experience because I don't
[1:27:03] care what's going on I don't care what
[1:27:05] problems there are in your personal life
[1:27:07] I don't care work I Don't Care Health I
[1:27:10] don't care church I don't care what's
[1:27:12] going on you got to stay in the test
[1:27:16] God Ain't Gonna Leave You I'll never
[1:27:18] leave you I'll never forsake you I
[1:27:20] though the whole world first leaves you
[1:27:22] I'll be with you even to the end that's
[1:27:25] good enough for me I'll tell you when
[1:27:27] they were uh when brother Branham uh
[1:27:30] when God revealed to brother Brandon
[1:27:31] they had a trap set for him and and uh
[1:27:34] you know he just
[1:27:36] was scared about going because the whole
[1:27:39] place was filled to people that were
[1:27:40] gonna come against his Doctrine to come
[1:27:42] against his belief and it was just him
[1:27:44] and he's not a fighter
[1:27:47] he didn't want to go he said I'll just
[1:27:49] you know what I just won't go
[1:27:51] and God said no you're going
[1:27:54] he said I'll be with you
[1:27:57] brother Brian said that's good enough
[1:27:58] for me
[1:28:00] I'll tell you when you meet the pillar
[1:28:02] of fire you're not afraid of anything
[1:28:05] you know the problem is we're not
[1:28:07] spending enough time in the prayer rooms
[1:28:08] preparing getting in the pillar of fire
[1:28:11] we go there do that do sometimes we do
[1:28:13] our routines
[1:28:14] then we come into Sanctuary we're
[1:28:16] wondering why it's so hard to believe
[1:28:17] the word why it's so hard to trust well
[1:28:19] it's so hard to believe in miracles why
[1:28:21] it's so hard to get the leadership of
[1:28:23] God in our life to face what we're going
[1:28:25] through because we're not facing it with
[1:28:27] faith
[1:28:28] we got to face it with we're more than
[1:28:30] able to land
[1:28:34] promised it
[1:28:37] my
[1:28:39] it's filled with swift transition today
[1:28:46] you meet that Pillar of Fire your
[1:28:48] attitude will change
[1:28:50] because your life changes you know what
[1:28:53] it does
[1:28:55] it removes all the bad habits
[1:29:00] and All Things become new
[1:29:03] you all sudden become faithful out of
[1:29:06] nowhere you're faithful
[1:29:08] in other words you know a lot of times
[1:29:11] we have to have a reason
[1:29:13] well I'm gonna
[1:29:16] all you need to know is God's will
[1:29:19] God's will
[1:29:21] be faithful to the word whatever the
[1:29:23] word tells you to do whatever you
[1:29:25] Whispers to your heart do it
[1:29:28] that was the best advice that Mary gave
[1:29:30] the disciples right whatever he say do
[1:29:32] it
[1:29:33] just do it and do it faithful because
[1:29:36] it's upon that decision that you make
[1:29:39] whether God's going to give you any more
[1:29:42] he ain't obligated to give you any more
[1:29:44] until you learn to do what he's told you
[1:29:46] to do
[1:29:48] stay with the word
[1:29:50] if you can't be faithful in a little
[1:29:51] don't tell me you can be faithful with
[1:29:53] so much more don't tell me that
[1:30:03] we need an experience that changes our
[1:30:06] life we've all had experiences but we
[1:30:08] need an experience that makes us new
[1:30:12] new now I had an experience and I was
[1:30:14] new for a while
[1:30:16] that don't count that's not the one I'm
[1:30:18] talking about
[1:30:21] a
[1:30:22] the experience that they had on the day
[1:30:23] of Pentecost half of them did not go
[1:30:27] back and say you know we don't want the
[1:30:29] Holy Ghost we're going to go back into
[1:30:30] the world
[1:30:34] when you're changed you're changed
[1:30:36] there's no turning back
[1:30:40] I understand slips and Falls I do
[1:30:44] and if anybody believes in them I
[1:30:45] believe in him because I have slept and
[1:30:47] I have fallen
[1:30:49] I don't believe in just taking a back
[1:30:53] seat for for who knows how long
[1:30:58] that is not the experience that I'm
[1:31:00] talking about
[1:31:02] The Experience I'm talking about is
[1:31:04] getting sealed with the Holy Ghost
[1:31:06] sealing out that devil
[1:31:08] sealing in God
[1:31:11] praise the Lord a new creature steadfast
[1:31:14] unmovable always abounding in the work
[1:31:17] of the Lord All Things become new
[1:31:19] presenting our bodies a Living Sacrifice
[1:31:22] unto God holy acceptable you know the
[1:31:25] Bible tells me that's reasonable it's a
[1:31:28] reasonable thing to do you think it's
[1:31:29] asking a lot well that's different
[1:31:31] because your gospel and this gospel is
[1:31:33] two different things
[1:31:36] God wants to bride that's all for him
[1:31:40] we don't want to be conformed to the
[1:31:41] world
[1:31:43] I want the mind of Christ we don't have
[1:31:45] to prove what is that good and
[1:31:47] acceptable and perfect will of God
[1:31:50] you know we just we just need to get
[1:31:51] desperate
[1:31:53] care enough
[1:31:55] you know I was talking to her brother
[1:31:56] yesterday
[1:32:00] if we can get so sick of our situation
[1:32:03] we're willing to do something about it
[1:32:06] but as long as we're pampering it that
[1:32:08] Spirit can stay around
[1:32:10] because he is offering more agency
[1:32:12] God moves through three more agency
[1:32:14] that's it
[1:32:16] if you will to will it's going
[1:32:20] but if you will for it to stay it's
[1:32:22] staying
[1:32:26] too many people are trying to overcome
[1:32:27] their problems with their personal
[1:32:31] ability
[1:32:35] and they'll just get all frustrated
[1:32:37] upset didn't work start blaming one
[1:32:39] another
[1:32:40] who's whose fault is it in the church
[1:32:44] who's the leader of this place
[1:32:47] um
[1:32:49] but you know what under the leadership
[1:32:51] of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:54] that Pillar of Fire
[1:32:57] I don't care if you're facing a lion's
[1:32:59] den
[1:32:59] I don't care if you're facing a fiery
[1:33:02] furnace
[1:33:04] you will stand faithful look at all
[1:33:06] those Martyrs who wouldn't recant and
[1:33:09] gave their life
[1:33:12] 68 million
[1:33:15] sometimes we can't even stand and love
[1:33:17] the person that's hating us
[1:33:20] what is going on
[1:33:23] we're just struggling on being sweet to
[1:33:25] somebody who's not being sweet to us
[1:33:30] that just gives you an opportunity
[1:33:34] to get perfect love
[1:33:37] and without it
[1:33:39] how can we be elected
[1:33:42] without it how can we be elected
[1:33:50] brother John you're really pouring it on
[1:33:52] heavy
[1:33:56] we don't got much time to
[1:33:58] around waiting for the coming of the
[1:34:00] Lord
[1:34:02] when I compare myself
[1:34:05] with this image
[1:34:09] whoa I'm way down here
[1:34:13] and
[1:34:15] I can't expect God just you know let me
[1:34:17] live to him 150.
[1:34:20] you know today's the day to get serious
[1:34:22] to become more like him
[1:34:25] to have a real relationship that when
[1:34:28] things are happening in our lives
[1:34:32] we know God is in it
[1:34:35] somehow he's in it
[1:34:37] I don't care if they slap you on the
[1:34:39] cheek turn the other
[1:34:42] I don't care if somebody asked you to do
[1:34:44] something
[1:34:45] go two miles I don't care if somebody
[1:34:49] uses you
[1:34:54] give without expecting in return
[1:34:57] we're talking about Christianity here
[1:35:00] now every this ain't for everybody
[1:35:03] but as I was with Moses so shall I be
[1:35:06] with you for me in my house I will serve
[1:35:09] the Lord I will do what Jesus told me to
[1:35:11] do
[1:35:12] it's a choice
[1:35:16] I want to stir your choices up
[1:35:19] I want to stir you up a little bit
[1:35:21] oh my my
[1:35:25] we didn't even get into the message
[1:35:26] today
[1:35:29] look we didn't have a lot of scriptures
[1:35:31] right
[1:35:34] and I didn't even get to the message
[1:35:42] it's happening all the time no matter
[1:35:44] how I prepare
[1:35:52] God said to Moses every place that the
[1:35:54] soul of your feet shall tread upon that
[1:35:57] have I given you as I said unto Moses
[1:36:01] this is the law of appropriation
[1:36:04] God gives but you got to take it
[1:36:07] God gives the lamb but you've got to
[1:36:09] take it God gives the Holy Ghost which
[1:36:10] you've got to tell God gives the
[1:36:12] promises but you got to take it God gets
[1:36:13] healing but you got to tell you God
[1:36:15] gives Joy but you got to God give us
[1:36:16] freeze but you got to take it because
[1:36:18] Satan is standing in the way
[1:36:21] so you got to take it
[1:36:23] amen now God paid the price for us
[1:36:28] the only thing we have to do is be
[1:36:30] strong enough to believe it
[1:36:33] strong enough to get the doubts out what
[1:36:35] doubts the doubts of God's integrity
[1:36:40] because that's what's happening when you
[1:36:42] doubt the word you're doubting God's
[1:36:43] integrity
[1:36:47] get him out God's true to his word
[1:36:50] I'm a liar you're a liar God's true
[1:36:54] it's okay if you call me liar I'm not
[1:36:55] going to get offended
[1:36:57] I'll just because it's the word
[1:37:01] but don't call this word a lie don't say
[1:37:03] God fails God ain't gonna come through
[1:37:06] you got to be strong enough to put your
[1:37:08] foot where you want it to be
[1:37:10] however you want the situation to be put
[1:37:13] your foot there and say it is mine it is
[1:37:16] mine this is mine
[1:37:21] talking about God giving
[1:37:24] God is not going to give you what you
[1:37:27] need to fight for
[1:37:30] but he died
[1:37:33] for you and me
[1:37:37] there's enough Grace in this world to
[1:37:39] save the whole world
[1:37:41] the sacrifice that at Calvary was was
[1:37:44] great enough to heal every brokenhearted
[1:37:46] to heal every sickness to deliver every
[1:37:48] captive
[1:37:49] to give peace to everybody there was
[1:37:52] nothing lacking at Calvary
[1:37:58] he can take away all depression
[1:38:01] but don't sit around in your unbelief
[1:38:03] and murmur like the children of Israel
[1:38:05] did
[1:38:07] you've got to fight for it you got to
[1:38:09] take the sword of God's word and stand
[1:38:12] on the Promises of God every place that
[1:38:14] the soul of your foot shall tread upon
[1:38:16] that have I given you in other words if
[1:38:19] you didn't put your foot there you know
[1:38:21] what I didn't give it to you
[1:38:25] peace is for the believer
[1:38:27] Joy is for the believer it is not for
[1:38:30] the unbeliever
[1:38:32] he has not given it if you don't put
[1:38:35] your foot there
[1:38:37] this is the law God gives but we got to
[1:38:40] take
[1:38:42] well we know the story about Grace
[1:38:45] remember the the one slave
[1:38:48] who was in prison and and
[1:38:51] Abraham Lincoln set a note saying that
[1:38:54] he's released
[1:38:57] and the man got the no in the prison
[1:39:00] and it said sign President Lincoln and
[1:39:03] he just oh that wasn't really present
[1:39:05] Lincoln
[1:39:06] and he didn't he didn't accept
[1:39:09] and then there was a big lawsuit and and
[1:39:11] the judge they declared that a man is
[1:39:15] not pardoned unless he receives the
[1:39:17] pardon
[1:39:19] and these promises are not for anybody
[1:39:22] but who's ever going to stand there and
[1:39:24] claim them for themselves you've got to
[1:39:27] put your your foot on that promise and
[1:39:29] say it is mine
[1:39:31] God wants there to be peace in my home
[1:39:34] peace in my marriage peace with my
[1:39:36] children's mind peace you got to stand
[1:39:39] there and claim it in the midst of them
[1:39:40] saying
[1:39:41] everything otherwise it's okay
[1:39:45] as I was with Moses as I was Joshua I'm
[1:39:48] going to be with you for 40 years of
[1:39:49] this stuff whatever it takes I'm going
[1:39:51] to stand faithful that's what God is
[1:39:54] looking for
[1:39:55] God gives we must take
[1:39:58] so just be honest with yourself have you
[1:40:00] had the right mental attitude
[1:40:03] have you been praying
[1:40:07] with desperation about your situation
[1:40:11] complaining with desperation
[1:40:14] is not the same thing as praying with
[1:40:17] desperation there are two different
[1:40:18] things
[1:40:20] so what sacrifices have you been doing
[1:40:24] to take that step what sacrifices are
[1:40:28] you waiting for somebody to say
[1:40:30] oh here it is
[1:40:32] here
[1:40:34] here
[1:40:35] are you waiting for someone to come up
[1:40:36] and say I'm sorry
[1:40:38] in order for you to love them
[1:40:41] in order for you to forgive them are you
[1:40:43] waiting for them to say I'm sorry
[1:40:46] is that no that ain't it
[1:40:49] you love them no matter what
[1:40:52] you put your foot there because it you
[1:40:55] know if everybody else in this church
[1:40:57] except you
[1:40:59] you make it
[1:41:02] why would you let somebody else
[1:41:03] influence you
[1:41:06] it's between you and God
[1:41:09] I want God to be with me like he was
[1:41:11] with Joshua like he was with Moses
[1:41:14] come on now
[1:41:18] it's a law
[1:41:23] that law was with Moses
[1:41:26] he had to go down into Egypt
[1:41:29] and and put his foot down
[1:41:31] say these people belong to God
[1:41:34] he had to take it because pharaoh
[1:41:38] wouldn't give it
[1:41:40] and that's how it is
[1:41:42] the devil ain't going to give you Joy he
[1:41:44] ain't going to give you peace he ain't
[1:41:46] going to give you love
[1:41:49] you got to take it because God gave it
[1:41:52] to you amen
[1:41:53] but you got to take it how do I do that
[1:41:56] brother John well spend some more time
[1:41:57] in prayer it's not an intellectual thing
[1:42:00] it's a reality where you get into the
[1:42:03] presence of God and you have such faith
[1:42:05] and boldness you can stand there and
[1:42:07] face that devil who's taunting you
[1:42:10] who's lying to you
[1:42:13] oh my okay I
[1:42:17] I at least let me read this real quick
[1:42:21] I want to finish this verse number six
[1:42:23] of Joshua chapter 1 verses 6 through 9.
[1:42:26] are you with me I'm going to start with
[1:42:29] verse 5. there shall not any man be able
[1:42:33] to stand before thee all the days of
[1:42:34] their life what a promise
[1:42:36] I love that
[1:42:39] as I was with Moses so I will be with
[1:42:41] thee and I will not fail thee nor
[1:42:43] forsake thee
[1:42:50] that's right brother Johnson if the
[1:42:52] whole world was in ashes
[1:42:55] and there were two standing you and God
[1:42:59] would you be afraid
[1:43:01] no
[1:43:03] so why do we have to be afraid today
[1:43:09] when we're standing alone
[1:43:12] I'll not leave you I'll not forsake you
[1:43:14] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[1:43:17] we've got to believe that today
[1:43:20] he said be strong and of a good courage
[1:43:25] you know there's bad courage too
[1:43:28] For unto these people shall thou divide
[1:43:31] for an inheritance the land which I
[1:43:33] swear unto their fathers to give them
[1:43:36] only be strong be very courageous
[1:43:41] I can
[1:43:44] why do I have to be strong Courageous
[1:43:45] about
[1:43:54] I got you a smile
[1:43:55] took a little bit but I got it
[1:43:58] I love this verse
[1:44:00] only be thou strong and very courageous
[1:44:02] that thou mayest observe to do all
[1:44:06] according to all the word of God
[1:44:11] what we have to be strong and courageous
[1:44:14] with is being faithful to the word
[1:44:18] that's where we need to be strong with
[1:44:20] when the devil says Ah it doesn't matter
[1:44:22] doesn't matter doesn't matter doesn't
[1:44:23] matter you call that out
[1:44:26] and say that's just a devil speaking to
[1:44:28] me
[1:44:29] I'm gonna be strong I'm going to be
[1:44:31] courageous and I'm going to be faithful
[1:44:33] to the word of God
[1:44:37] that's the courage we need
[1:44:41] that thou mayest observed to do
[1:44:43] according to all the law which Moses my
[1:44:46] servant commanded thee turn not from the
[1:44:48] from it to the right hand or to the left
[1:44:51] hand some excuses or some reasoning
[1:44:56] that thou mayest Prosper whether so ever
[1:44:58] thou goest
[1:45:00] and this book of the law shall not
[1:45:02] depart are they mouth but thou shall
[1:45:04] meditate it meditate therein day and
[1:45:08] night that thou mayest observe to do it
[1:45:12] to do according to all that is written
[1:45:14] therein
[1:45:16] for then you're going to make your way
[1:45:18] prosperous and then thou shall have good
[1:45:22] success
[1:45:23] have not only commanded thee be strong
[1:45:25] and be of good courage Be not Afraid
[1:45:27] neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[1:45:29] thy God is with thee whether so ever
[1:45:31] thou goth we got one thing to do one
[1:45:33] thing to focus on focus on learning to
[1:45:36] be more faithful to the word of God
[1:45:39] not pick out five things and say I'm
[1:45:41] faithful that is not faithful that's
[1:45:43] faithful to five things
[1:45:47] the word is all is written in there all
[1:45:51] so there's got to be something God's
[1:45:53] working on in your life
[1:45:54] if he's working on all these things on
[1:45:56] my life he's got to be working on
[1:45:58] something on your life
[1:46:01] I mean we all want to prosper
[1:46:04] we all want to have good success
[1:46:06] I want to have a good life whether so
[1:46:08] ever thou goest we want it
[1:46:11] the key is not striving to get rich
[1:46:14] striving to have good success striving
[1:46:16] to to make a better future
[1:46:19] it's about striving to be faithful to
[1:46:22] the little things that God has placed in
[1:46:24] your hands to be faithful with and when
[1:46:27] you're faithful with those things then
[1:46:29] God blesses your life why can't we get
[1:46:31] that revelation
[1:46:34] God would have us to prosper in all
[1:46:36] things and be in health
[1:46:39] God wants us successful
[1:46:43] but he don't want it above his word
[1:46:48] just like you don't put your foot there
[1:46:51] God ain't given it to you
[1:46:55] you're not going to be faithful to the
[1:46:56] word
[1:46:58] how can you expect God to give you the
[1:47:00] promise when you're not faithful to the
[1:47:03] word when somebody else gave their life
[1:47:05] to be faithful to the word
[1:47:07] come on they spent years look at brother
[1:47:10] Johnson spent years and years and years
[1:47:15] and then we're going to come in
[1:47:17] we're not going to be faithful but we're
[1:47:18] going to expect God to bless us this is
[1:47:20] no Prosperity message
[1:47:24] this is about learning how to obey all
[1:47:26] the word well brother John
[1:47:29] you know
[1:47:33] the word is the word that's it just
[1:47:35] preaching the word I'm not preaching my
[1:47:38] ideas
[1:47:39] God is calling us
[1:47:42] to be faithful Joshua was faithful he
[1:47:45] was faithful for 40 years
[1:47:48] Moses was faithful amongst all the
[1:47:50] murmuring complaining you be faithful
[1:47:53] and God will bless you
[1:47:56] be faithful and well brother John
[1:47:58] brother John brother John look I have no
[1:48:01] other gospel I have no other gospel I
[1:48:04] know no other scripture for you
[1:48:07] I I do know that
[1:48:10] hey
[1:48:12] there was a time that David
[1:48:15] was looking at the wicked how they
[1:48:16] prospered
[1:48:21] and he said man this is a waste of time
[1:48:24] I don't even know why I'm trying when I
[1:48:26] can just you know they're getting it
[1:48:29] without even trying
[1:48:32] and then he went to church one time
[1:48:37] and when he learned their end
[1:48:39] he said it wasn't worth it
[1:48:43] it's not worth getting Prosperity today
[1:48:45] and have a bad end
[1:48:48] you know if you're not the seed of God I
[1:48:50] can see God blessing you
[1:48:52] because prosperity
[1:48:54] has nothing to do whether you're in the
[1:48:55] will of God
[1:48:57] it is poor and struggling
[1:49:01] God didn't teach Lazarus how to be rich
[1:49:05] and he and he didn't and he didn't teach
[1:49:09] Abraham to give everything he had to lot
[1:49:13] you are what God makes you
[1:49:16] the thing is we have the key to the
[1:49:19] success in life to to peace to love to
[1:49:21] Joy to the things that God has for his
[1:49:24] children we have the key and it's hid
[1:49:27] it's hid in Simplicity it's hid in such
[1:49:32] a a way that President says
[1:49:35] the intellectual and the smart
[1:49:38] Overlook it
[1:49:40] it's faithfulness
[1:49:43] faithfulness to do all the word
[1:49:47] what a message
[1:49:49] I want I want that message in my heart I
[1:49:51] want to hide that message in my heart
[1:49:53] you know it's exciting for me to see
[1:49:55] what God has in store for me
[1:49:58] you know it may you know I may I may
[1:50:00] lose that that business
[1:50:02] you know like

[1:50:08] right the house could blow up
[1:50:11] we everybody could leave the church
[1:50:13] but you know I'm excited
[1:50:16] about what God has in store for me
[1:50:19] because the lord giveth and the lord
[1:50:21] taketh away
[1:50:23] blessed be the name so it's not about
[1:50:25] those things

[1:54:07] that Lord for me in my house we're going
[1:54:10] to be faithful you want to be remembered
