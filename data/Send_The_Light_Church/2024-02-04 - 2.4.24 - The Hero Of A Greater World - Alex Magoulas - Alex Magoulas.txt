preaching of the word amen how many's come expecting amen amen I've come expecting it's it's good to have brother Marty back amen praise the Lord that God's good watching over our brother and giving him a a wonderful wonderful time and that's just an answer to prayer amen it's good to have you back you're greatly missed amen and it's good to have brother Alex and his family with us am amen um it's been a little bit longer since we've had them but he's always been a blessing to to the church and to to me he's been an encouragement and we're just grateful for God's five-fold Ministry and that he's allowed him to be to come and and help us from time to time we just appreciate that let's be in prayer as our brother is is ministering he he just got back from Honduras and maybe he'll say a couple things about that that would be just wonderful but whatever God has placed on his heart let's just the let the hunger that's inside of us pull the word out amen and uh have a a good beding ground for us for when we leave here to be drawn closer to the Lord amen amen let's sing only believe as our brother comes only believe only believe [Music] only believe all things are possible only

Jesus is here Jesus is here all things are possible for Jesus is here Jesus is here Jesus is here and all things are possible Jesus is here amen do you believe that this morning man he said if even two or three of us would gather together in his name he would be in the midst of us and so I'm trusting for each of us that we brought our licks of fire here this morning and we have just come expecting to hear from him amen I believe that he not only can meet our expectations but he desires to exceed our expectations he can do a abundantly amen abundantly above anything we could ask or think and so we just we are such a blessed people amen uh God bless you good to be with you this morning I just uh invite you at this time maybe to Bow your heads with me for a word of prayer as we look to him Heavenly Father we are a blessed a privileged people as we've gathered together this morning assembled ourselves in the name above every other name the name above every trial and every circumstance which besets your people this morning your scripture declares that many are the afflictions of the righteous but you promised to deliver them out of them all we are thankful today that we are not alone Lord we are not alone in this place that we've gathered together with with brothers and sisters of like Precious faith and Lord besides that the angel of the Lord encampeth around about them that fear them and deliver them and we are believing today for great help and deliverance in the Time of Need For You are an everpresent help help in trouble Lord father you see the hour that we live in we live in perilous times Lord the scripture declares it but we know that when the enemy comes in like a flood the Lord you said you would raise up a standard we are trusting today Lord we know that greater is he that is in us than he that's in the world bless this time now we pray bless the reading of your word and the ministering thereof and May It Go for the edification of these your children may all the things that are said and done be to your praise and glory and honor for we ask it all now in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the church says amen if you have your Bibles this morning we're going to look into the book of Nehemiah the 4th chapter and while you're turning there just briefly just appreciate everybody as as brother John said we just got back from Honduras and I believe brother Johnson's been there in different ones before brother John has support him so they're they're doing well um things are moving on the Lord is blessed uh we had a youth camp there and we had uh several several probably a few dozen young people come to the Lord receive the Holy Ghost different things like that so just an exciting time it's a beautiful country and uh particularly this time of year where it's 80 degrees there as opposed to whatever it is here it was quite a change to come back you know usually I'm pretty all about you I want to get home and stuff but they have good burgers there they have really good beef there and it was warm and I'm like maybe I should just make the family come to me but we're back so we're happy to be with you actually we're just happy to be here so I do like the cold weather I like it a little less as I get older I don't like it quite as cold as I used to like it so but anyway you didn't come here to hear me ramble like I'm some old man I just I'm only 40 but uh appreciate everybody's prayers and and it's encouraging to see that God is fulfilling his word he said I'll have a bride out of every Kindred and tongue and Nation so continue if you pray for them please pray for the people of hondur or continue to pray for them and just so much more could be said but we had a real good time there I got a little sick there but I'm doing well today uh as far as that goes so we're just trust in the Lord with the service day Nehemiah the 4th chapter um so many different things I I want to get to this morning but I don't want to be all day about it but um um we're going to look in the book of Nehemiah here the fourth chapter I love the book of Nehemiah as you may have guessed that's probably why my firstborn son is named Nehemiah yes I'm looking at you so everybody look at him okay so well anyway he's going to get me for that later um no I love the story of Nehemiah if anybody's not familiar Nehemiah during the the time of the Captivity uh the people of course they gone to Babylon and then Babylon was destroyed by the mes and Persians and so Israel's out of their promised land and he gets uh Nehemiah hears that Jerusalem had been laid waste of course Ezra had just gone back and began to work on the Temple and so Nehemiah has this burden he goes before the the Lord and the King speaks to him and gives him permission to go back and rebuild Jerusalem rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and so uh like any great undertaking that God gives a man when Nehemiah goes back and he begins to do this he encounters some opposition and I would say today that if you have lived a life as a Christian at some point you've probably encountered some opposition somewhere if not it might be questionable whether you're on the right track so so we're going to read this here in Nehemiah the 4th chapter this morning and I know you're standing for just a little bit but don't worry as I always remind you I shall remain standing the entire time so you get no sympathy for me neiah chap 4 let's just read in verse 12 together and I'll have you be seated here after we get to verse uh 20 here Nehemiah chap 4:12 and it came to pass that when the Jews which dwelt by them came they said unto us 10 times from all places when she shall return unto us they will be upon us speaking about the enemy coming upon them the adversaries so Nehemiah has got an action plan I like this he's not just uh one of these empty worded politicians he's got a plan he says therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places I even set the people after their families with their swords their Spears and their bows and I looked and Rose up and said unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and God had brought their counsel to not that we returned all of us to the wall everyone into his work and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of my servants wrought in the work and the other half them held both the spears the Shields and the bows and the habens and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah they which build it on the wall and they that bear burdens with those that laid it everyone with one of his hands rought in the work and with the other hand held a weapon this is some real good Second Amendment preaching right here if you're not making it political just saying for the builders everyone had his sword gted by his side and so build it and he that sounded the trumpet was by me and I said unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people the work is great and large and we are separated upon the wall one far from another in what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet Resort ye thither unto us our God shall fight for us amen may the Lord bless the's word you may be seated this morning um I'd like to speak on a thought this morning the hero of a greater world Amen and uh it's interesting I was looking through the pictures I'd taken on this trip and so my my iPad I have these pictures for my missions trip Sav so I there's the story I tell and it's interesting I actually found the picture of it this I stayed at this hotel some years back I was in India and I stayed at a certain hotel and uh there was a brother with me his name was David he was from the church in chenai and he was my uh he was my interpreter so he was taking me about and stuff and so he comes one morning uh to get me from the hotel and he's taking me there's a plazy walk across to get to a restaurant across the way and so we're going through this Courtyard and there's the there's several different busts of famous individuals I guess they're famous or whatever in India I don't know most of them you know it was some British guy that colonized them and some Indian person I think it was mamag Gandhi and different ones stuff and so the reason I bring this up is I'm looking at all these different statues there just a row of different figures of their of their black like busts of these different figures and there's one that stood out in particular to me as an American they had one there of Abraham Lincoln and uh so I thought that was rather pecul you know cuz again you know what do the Indians have to do with Abraham uh Lincoln so um you know I started asking this guy said I'm just curious what's this doing here in the middle of India and he's like oh Abraham Lincoln he was a great man and he was a hero and he's just tell me all the things about the 16th president United States and when he was president and the Gettysburg address and all this stuff and it's fascinating to me because we live in a culture now where uh some people uh protested I guess or they you know whatever the like most most young people probably don't even know who Abraham Lincoln was or what he did but I think of that I think of that color man brother Bram talked about where he saw the Garment where Lincoln's blood was and it meant something to him when he looked at that bloodstained garment that this man he died for my freedom amen and so we think about this and so I'm like well what's that have to do with India it has nothing to do with India he says but what it represents to us is that he's a hero to us and I'm thinking I never knew the Indians thought Abraham Lincoln was a hero but here we are and so I think which is really interesting if you think about the fact that he's a Christian man you know and all these other things and they're predominantly Hindu I guess so his his heroism transcends even the religious or cultural boundaries that that we have in our country or that they have in their country amen so I got to thinking about this idea what what makes a man a hero what makes a woman a hero amen because they're founding fathers or whatever I mean you know I don't know how that works but it's it's it's one of our figures amen so uh it's interesting to me because uh you you think about what what makes somebody hero and we we typically think of a man's courage or his bravery you know that a hero's got to be brave and I believe that's certainly a part of it but we see all throughout history there's plenty of people they're Brave they're bold and they're foolish because of it they make all kinds of mistakes amen so a person can be brave and stupid they can be brave and die for the wrong thing amen so it's not just a matter of being brave there's plenty of people who have who because of vain Glory Glory they they're willing to die as fools and so you think about the idea well maybe it's somebody that's talented but there's many people that are talented in the world today Elvis Presley was talented amen but what did he use it for he didn't use it for the glory of God he used it for himself so there's many people that are talented maybe an inventor or whatever it is but they misuse their talents amen and the Bible even talks about people they bury their talent so it's more than just a talented person it's more than just a brave person it's more than just a famous person there's many people in the world today that they're they're famous apparently Abraham Lincoln is famous in in India I had no idea you know I mean so but there's plenty of people that are famous but they're not famous for a good thing amen and so this idea like the Indians especially in the orient and the Eastern culture to them a hero is somebody that changes the order of how things are done they they change the very way that the cosmos functions the the social Paradigm or whatever amen so I say all these things you know to me all these things are important but what makes a hero uh somebody of Distinction is that they have an uncommon virtue or moral fortitude amen they they have a strong moral conviction about something in so much that they endure exceptional Hazard or even give up their life because to them it's the right thing to do amen amen so it's not just something that endures danger but it's something that puts themselves In Harm's Way for someone else to do it amen you know we think about this modern an era of entertainment and you know we've got we've got this uh you know many people they redefine what a hero is amen do we have a hookup here I'm just going oh thank you sir praise the Lord you know you look at the idea of a hero we have superheroes nowadays and superheroes are actually less heroic than normal Heroes they say what do you mean well listen if you're bulletproof and you can fly and you can heat vision stuff and somebody comes up to you and they threaten to shoot somebody and you stand in the way that doesn't make you Brave that just makes you bulletproof amen that it doesn't take any listen if you're invulnerable it doesn't take any courage to put yourself In Harm's Way amen but listen when that gun can kill you just as much as the next person and you put yourself In Harm's Way that shows there's something different about you than everybody else amen Jesus said No Greater Love does a man have that he would lay down his life for his friends and that's what we're talking about today amen somebody that's want to lay themselves on the line where it might even cost their life it might cost them all kinds of things but the cause is so great the need is so great that it's worthwhile for them to do it when maybe nobody else wants to when maybe nobody else is willing when it's not the popular thing to do yet the lay their lives on the line amen and that's what makes it a real inspiration that's what makes it heroic amen because it's not just what they did it but we look at their lives and it inspires us there's something we say listen I want to be somebody like that amen and and here's the thing anybody can look at a hero and say I want to be like that but it's a different thing to be that in the midst of adversity amen anybody with any sort of sound mind would say oh yeah I wish I could do those things but what happens when the trouble actually comes that's what shows what kind of character we have amen so it what it represents to us is what makes it heroic it inspires us say man you take our country's flag the flag in this country well it used to mean something to some people it still does to some people and not so much to other people amen is that all right listen this this we think about the song The Star Spangled Banner when they saw that flag wave and it meant something to them in that battle amen we think about six Marines climbing up uima and raising the flag if we think about these things amen listen the flag it represents something that's what makes it significant amen and so there's this story I thought of because I talking about Abraham Lincoln I thought about this story during the Civil War I learned it when I was a kid and all these years later by the grace of God I get to use it and it's really safe cuz I'm here in the north amen I was talking about this one time down south well maybe they don't think he's so heroic here I don't know how that works but but there's a man during the Civil War his name was Thomas plunket has anybody ever heard of Thomas plunet all right man I got some got some backup today praise God so you know the story I might as well just skip on you can tell everybody else about it later no I'll go ahead and tell but Thomas plunket he' fought at the Battle of Gettysburg he was a Union soldier he fought a different few different places and what he famous for is during the Battle of Fredericksburg in Virginia uh he was they were there one day and his unit was under enemy fire and the there was one guy in the he was the standard Bearer he held up the flag that had the Union flag it showed what who they were identified with and so he seen his friends start taking fire and he became known as the hero of four words because he'd always say don't let it fall don't let it fall boys don't let it fall and he would encourage these guys and they start falling one would get shot and die and another one would run up and grab the the standard and they continued doing that till he was the last man that was around the flag and so this guy he goes and he grabs this Banner this endon and uh during the fight he loses both arms I don't even know how he holds it up without an arm I don't know if he's using his stump or what I don't know what the science is behind it but he ends up getting shot up kins explode around him and shrapnel and bullets he loses both arms but he stands and he holds up this flag amen cuz he's not willing to let it fall amen and finally some private shows up and they get reinforcements and they carry it forward for him and listen he went the rest of his life this is this is not 2024 where he can get Prosthetics he's got no arms he's shot up he's a veteran but he was a hero to the Union Army because he wouldn't let it fall no matter how heavy the fire got no matter how bad things seemed he wouldn't let that flag fall now listen that flag is just a piece of cloth like any other piece of cloth amen if brother John took my jacket right now and hung on a stick outside and starts shooting at it sister an gets a gun starts shooting at it say better go get your suit you know what I'm going to do I'm going to go to pennies and I'm going to buy another jacket cuz I'm not going to risk my life for a suit jacket it's just a piece of cloth amen but listen the flag it's just a piece of cloth naturally but that's not what makes it special what makes it special is what it represents the stripes on it represent the blood of soldiers who died for you and I to have Liberty it represents the thousands of men that carried it into battle so you and I today could sit here and have religious freedom and preach this message and have the Liberty to do it and believe the things that we believe amen we are here today because men suffered and died for our Liberty listen this Bible is here today because men like William tendle took their stand and suffered so we could have these things amen we' have entered into other men's labors and when we look at our Bible when we look at a flag we remember what it means to us that's what makes it special amen the jacket's not special the the the flag the cloth the material is not special it's what it represents listen you and I today our humanity is not special the devil today is not afraid of our Humanity it's the one we represent the one we represent is the one he's terrified of amen if you're coming in your own righteousness your own ability and you think you're going to outsmart the enemy if you think you're human ability will help you surmount every trial you're going to falter you're going to fail but if you remember who you're representing today Hallelujah see it represents something brother Ram says this these Warriors they take these young kids out just the cream of the crop because they don't know no better than discipline Army discipline they say stick your head up over the hill let somebody shoot it off die like a hero and they gladly do it yes run up there on one and get shot down the other and shot down and the nation forgets them unless their family well that's about the truth come back this here they come back he says you see what I mean many of the soldiers he but a man seldom will you ever find one that'll lay down his life for the cause of Christ amen he won't even crawl out up his shade tree and go to church won't even get out from behind the television long enough to attend a Wednesday night prayer meeting that's right a shame disgrace he says that's the reason Angels don't visit the churches that's the reason Angels don't visit homes we've got to get down to deep sincerity of this thing amen talking about sincerity brother bam I love the idea you know brother Bram liked the idea of heroism he liked a valent man a man with courage a man with a backbone he liked that sort of thing there's different examples he uses in the message and one of the big ones he uses we all know the story about the mother deer amen amen I was thinking about this that mother deer you know when when when Bert old snake guys out there he's got that call he's going to go shoot these little FS that Mama dear she she thinks her young one is in danger she knows that she's in danger looking for it but because she's a real mom amen and it's amazing to me because this is just a brute Beast brother Ram says I think about a mother possum and a mother deer a real mother amen Nature has that in a real mother and yet we've got a society today which teaches moms not to Value the children not to raise them up for the Lord to even to even murder them in the womb and yet these natural animals come me out somebody I know it's not popular but it's the truth anyway these natural animals have enough mom about them to not do that to their own young and we claim to be civilized and we claim to be ethical and we claim to be enlightened and the deer got more mom and the posum listen I'm not condemning the woman I'm condemning the spirit which tells a mom which tells a young lady it's okay to do that they're deceived by the devil not condemning the person hope you understand that today amen but our society Satan's Eden has made it since acceptable and they've offered their children to the fires of M just like they did in the Old Testament amen because it's inconvenient because it might cut into their social life right listen it's you're well this is a whole another ser enough listen that child is as much of a blessing as you'll confess that it is amen that child can be the worst thing in your life and it can be a monster and if you think that that's what you'll call it and then guess what it'll turn out to be well my child acts like a monster all the time well probably because you called them one listen our schools teach them they're animals and then we're surprised when they act like animals I know why they act like animals cuz you told them that's what they are right but if you confess that's a son that's a daughter of God that's my blessing that's my Heritage and you'll speak that over their life and you'll believe that and you'll treat them like that that's what you'll get beautiful that's how I believe it anyway amen oh I see it all the time I've seen it workplaces where they oh my little devil spawn I'm thinking well Thou Art not far from the truth amen oh it it astounds me especially as Believers my my wife and I we we try to be very careful or the entire time we've been parents sometimes our children do bad things that doesn't make them bad children that's not the same thing amen sometimes God's children make mistakes that doesn't make them not God's children it just means they did something wrong that's why there's a blood that's why there's forgiveness amen listen if my heavenly father can forgive me I ought to be able to forgive my own children amen you ought to be able to love your own children amen well praise the Lord anyway it's the truth anyhow amen you want to see positive things in their life listen you want to see positive things in your life speak positive things amen don't wave negativity wave positive things wave the word over him amen listen you start well I'm I'm way off the beat path now amen listen you're in the middle of a fight that's not when you drop the banner well I'm going to fly somebody else's colors that's when you hold it high I'm not backing down now because of a mishap because of this listen God's children all through the Bible had Maps but they didn't change who they were amen well glory to God Amen I love the story brother tells about Arnold Von Winkle we all know the story listen that guy when he was out there he was not a trained soldier he was a farmer he didn't know William Brandon was going to be speaking about him in the future had nothing to do with why he did it he did it because he believed that his sacrifice would make a way for Liberty and one man's sacrifice one man sacrifice it it made a difference for Switzerland to this day what that he was a trained or a great man it's what he did it's what he was one to give amen quotes Longfellow Henry Longworth wadworth Longfellow is the Psalm of Life Quotes it all the time in the message I love it it says in the world's broad field of battle in the bivaak of Life be not like dumb driven cattle be a hero in The Strife well he liked it amen amen be a hero in the strife and I got thinking about this listen there's no such thing as a hero in ease or in times of Peace amen there it's it's when extraordinary circumstances arise amen without chaos there's no such a thing as a hero amen they are like a flag or a banner amid the chaos amid the darkness amid adversity they stand out amen so it's not so much that strife and this this is how I feel about it it's not that Strife makes people's here makes people into Heroes it just reveals what was in them the whole time amen right listen if you don't have that character in you now you don't suddenly get it in the midst of adversity it amazes me people are like well listen if this happened to me you know I used the Second Amendment here a minute ago so I just use that you know anytime Congress passes one of these bills and they're going to take your guns or this that you know all the keyboard Warriors show up and they're going to stop it they're going to go to my front yard and you got you know they're going to have to pry them out of my cold dead hands you'd be the first people to give up right anybody can talk listen if if social media and the internet has taught us one thing anybody can say anything and 99% of the time they're not going to deliver amen but listen if you have the right character in you what that character is revealed in adversity it's revealed in Trials amen you don't get it there you had it in the first place and God allows Hallelujah why am I going through this why is God allow me to be in this situation to reveal something about you that nobody knew about you cuz God knows things about you you don't know about about you God sees things about your life that you don't see I don't see my listen Gideon didn't see himself as a mighty man of Valor that's why God sent a bunch of midianites his way why they coming here to show that Gideon is a mighty man of Valor the sword of the Lord and the sword of Gideon will defeat this Army though they be like grasshoppers very good why would God put me in the most desperately wicked evil deceiving age proof for you you are that's right listen he didn't do it to destroy you he did it to to show you off amen he did to exhibit the character of Christ in your life amen it's not for your harm it's for your good it's for his glory amen because anybody can talk oh yeah we listen you go to any nomenal you go to any nominal Evangelical Church what's the first thing in their statement of for faith we believe the Bible to be the inspired word of God It's the final Authority in all things to the church and then literally everything else is contrary to the Bible we believe in three gods and we believe in baptism and the titles that's just anybody can say oh yeah we believe in the Bible everybody that goes to church well not everybody most people that go to church oh yeah we believe the Bible but who's actually going to live it that's the difference God's not interested how well we argue it he's interested how well we live it in the midst of adversity listen it's easy to live a Christian Life in this church in front of everybody but when you go home when you get sick when you're at work when you encounter adversity what kind of Life do you live then that shows your character the Bible says if you faint in the day of adversity thy strength is small amen listen I used to work at a factory years ago and I had this job I'm chucking these aluminum rims on this conveyor for 12 hours some were 20 PBS and some were 50 lbs and you're doing that for hours on end you're going down you're going up man now listen I am not I'm not Mr Universe I just tell you right now that's not my scene man I'm not here all you doing all this I watch these young guys these 18-year- old football players 6 foot6 300 lb you know they're just strapped these men they'd come in there their first day on the job they're like yeah we'll show these old and they'd do that for about 3 hours they'd walk out of the plant I'm like man you lift weights all you pay money to lift weights and now you got a job and it's too hard cuz you don't you you see what I'm getting at man they look tough till they had to actually do some work all the muscles didn't hold up so well all of a sudden and yet I've got some guy next to me 55y old little Irish guy 5 foot5 little belly like this man he could out work all of them you're strength is not measured by how strong you are when everything's going well your strength is measured by what you've got when adversity comes the first time of trouble comes if the the big muscles don't do you no good then they're not worth nothing it might win you a competition or photo shoot but they won't overcome adversity I don't get any ideas now I'm not handing out autographs today I know you're all looking at this guy but I'm not I know you're not it's okay doesn't take much to discern it you're all laugh and I got it amen I love this be not dumb driven cattle he says don't be dumb driven cattle in other words most people when Trouble Comes their circumstances dictate their response yes they're driven like cattle and most people live in fear they're they're controlled by media they're controlled by fear they're controlled by narratives they're controlled by agendas they're driven all the time but listen we're not cattle that's right we're sheep you don't drive sheep you lead Sheep amen when Jesus come to Jerusalem he said I that he wanted to gather them amen he was moved with compassion because they were like sheep not having a Shepherd can I say it this way there's a group of people I believe there's a group of people on the Earth today still they're not looking to be driven about with the circumstances of this life but they're looking for the leadership of God they're looking for the moving of the Holy Ghost that's what they want to influence their decision that's what makes them act out amen amen we're not pushed along with the tides of fate and the tides of popular opinion and politics we're moved by the Holy Ghost we believe this Bible despite circumstances despite obstacles we've taken our stand amen hallelujah the Bible says this speaking of Jesus Isaiah chapter 11 in that day there should be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an end sin to the people what's an end sin it's a ban you lift it up and mean you lift it up and it gives them a direction Amen to it the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious Paul quotes it in Romans 15 there shall be a root of jessing and he that shall rise to Reign Over the Gentiles in him shall the Gentiles trust amen again Psalm 60 the Bible says in verse four thou has given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of thy truth so listen you've got a banner today amen you've got something to display the banner does you no good if you stick it under your bed let me ask somebody the banner does you no good as a soldier if you leave it in the barracks listen this Bible does you no good if you leave it on the page amen it's no good if you just stick it under your table or on top of the table when you're done and you just leave it there amen a banner to work an inant or a standard to work it has to be on display it does not function otherwise amen listen our lord Jesus he led captivity captive he's a great Captain Amen in him shall the Gentiles trust the Bible says if I be lifted up I will draw all men to me see we must lift up Jesus we can't lift up our idea or our church Identity or our argument and our fuss and our fighting we must lift up Jesus Christ that's the only listen you might draw a lot of people you might get a big crowd preaching other things but if you want to draw that rainbow trout if you want to draw the elect amen the ones that are not driven like cattle if you're looking to get the real sheep of God you must lift up the word you must lift up Jesus Christ that's the only thing that will draw them amen amen so for a Bandon to work it has to be it it it has to identify where you are it has to be visible it has to be lifted up amen the Bible calls God one of his Redemptive name Jehovah nii the Lord is our Banner amen or our refuge amen it's in the book of Exodus the 17th chapter you don't have to turn there but you're probably all familiar with the story the people of Israel they they're heading towards the promised land and I believe they run into the amalekites and so Moses sends Joshua down there to make war on him and and it's a curious story because you know he's down there fighting with him and stuff Joshua's down there fighting the enemy and Moses he stands up on this mountain side and he lifts up his hands over the people and as long as he's lifting up his hands over the people they had Victory but you know this guy's getting a little older this guy's not like the guy that come to the factory he's like me his arms get tired pretty quick and Moses after a while his arms start to get a little heavy and they come down and Aaron and her notice when his arms go down they start losing the battle so they get This brilliant idea let's set him down we ain't got a we don't have an easy boy but we got a rock we'll set him on this rock and we'll hold his arms up for him amen well praise the Lord that's the thing to do amen when you see somebody getting tired you see somebody getting worn out don't push him down lift him up you see your pastor man he looks tired this week well don't tell him he's tired he knows he's tired he don't even remind it he knows how much he worked this week lift him up in prayer say brother we're praying for you we're getting behind you amen we know if we can all stand behind what the Lord wants to do there's victory in that amen listen as long as he held those arms up and there they call him Jehovah ni the Lord is my banner see as long as you hold the Lord up there's Victory there amen you said well listen I'm not know this and I'm not that listen you don't have to be some super soldier or some superhero you have a banner the banner is what special brother bam says this he says notice it takes the weakest the rejected you say well that's me well praise God this quotes for you then practically every hero God ever had on the front lines was that type of person ah see you didn't disqualify yourselves you just signed up listen I'm too weak I'm not good hey you're the one he's going to use sorry sorry not sorry a person that was rejected Ed anybody here maybe you don't have I don't need to show hands you know who you are a person that was rejected a person that thought he was insufficient a person that had no ability at all well glory to God now he's talking to me too that person is just in good shape so God can start using him that's right when they feel like they can't they haven't got nothing that's when God can take a hold of them and do something with them but when we're thinking we're able to do it then God can't use us because we're wanting to do it ourselves so the other side we get these feelings we think that we are insufficient we don't want to do it but if we'll just listen to the call of God Amen what I want to encourage you with this morning if we just listen to the call of God that's the very thing that God wants to get us into that kind of shape so he can amen well listen I've had more trials I've had more problems last listen I am less confident in myself than I've ever been brother good I've got good news for you you're in good condition listen when you have nowhere to turn but God you're in a good spot cuz now you have to depend on God and so yourself like you've done for years of your life that's what most of us do well I'm going to depend on them 80% of the time that's not good enough amen listen 80% not you have to hold him up always amen we take Nehemiah I'm going to bring it back to Nehemiah and I think why' we even read about him this is why Nehemiah is a seemingly inconspicuous person he's not a king or a prince of the tribe of Judah or this or that he's a nobody to his Brethren well he had a pretty good job he's the king's cup bear it's pretty good till the king gets poisoned I guess other than that it's pretty good I mean he's trusted the king trust him you know but Nehemiah is not some stand out you know there wasn't a bunch of magazines he's the first draft pick and he's this and all nehemiah's going to change the scene he's nobody to nobody and he's just sitting there one day and his brother writes to him listen Jerusalem lies waste the people got nowhere to live but you know what there was something about Nehemiah I love it because he he feels this burden for the people he feels this need he does what any of us should have done in that situation he begins to pray amen Beautiful Lord I I can't leave it like this yeah I know the Situation's bad but Lord I I can't leave Lord there's got to be something that can be done Lord there's got to be someone there was someone he was he was volunteering himself at the very time didn't realize it amen this man Nehemiah we find out and you can go back and read through the whole book he's he's a remarkable man he's got Vision he's got ambition I he's pragmatic and methodical yet he's a man of great faith and hope in God and one of the things he was really good is he knew how to Rally the people to Hope in the midst of adversity yes amen I love it because like I said he he's not some great general or Veterans of battles or all these things but there's just something God gave him favor with the people when the enemy begins to come in like a flood then they're all saying listen there's no way we will not allow this city to be built we will not allow God to do this thing we will come out against against you 10 different ways it's not going to happen the people became afraid but it only takes one Arnold Von Winkle re amen only takes one Mama dear Hallelujah to change the situation amen it just takes one genuine person it just takes one person that cares enough I think one of the biggest things I know I preached about this a little bit last time I'm going to preach it again I think one of the biggest things that hinders us we just don't care enough we get indifferent because we lived in a different age and the love of man is wax cold because iniquity abounds and we see stuff going on says well that's just how it's going to be it doesn't always have to be that way listen I can't change the world then you can change it for one person you can make a difference amen how how much do we care about the situation and this one man Nehemiah listen they went through that City they saw the same thing he saw they saw the rubble they saw saw the destruction they heard the threats of the enemy and they're all afraid and they all want to give up but Nehemiah saw something different am amen listen he seen the same debris the same problems hearing the same threats but he prayed and he got before God and he said listen God gave me favor with the King God brought me you didn't call me here God brought me here some of you come here this morning because you were supposed to come here but some of you recognize today God called you to be in this place this morning because you were born for such a time as this you were called for such a time as this amen and you might recognize he was not there by accident he was there as part of the plan of God and he begin to remind the people he held up the testimony of what God had done in his life he says don't you be afraid of them remember the Lord amen that's what happens when we get in trials and we get concerned cuz we remember this thing and we remember the doctor's report and we remember what happened to this person and he says listen don't remember what the enemy said don't remember the negative circumstances remember the Lord you're remembering all the wrong things and forgetting the right thing remember the Lord oh my which is great can I get a witness oh come on somebody hold up your banner can I get a witness remember the hard which is great and you fight for your wives you fight for your brethren you fight for your sons you fight for your daughters you fight for your houses amen some of us fall at the first sign of trouble oh the devil's coming my way well he better strap himself in cuz he's got the fight of his life on his hands amen if he wants to listen if he wants to come to Spencer Drive in vanw Ohio there's a bunch of other houses he'd rather go to First amen he's going about he's like a roaring lion he's seeking whom he can devour cuz he can't get everybody there's somebody next to the shepherd there's somebody they're ready for battle there's somebody they've got their sword on oh he say that's somebody else it might as well be you it might as well be you why not you today he didn't say okay you certain people here you're all strong enough no every one of you put your sword on get back to work you get ready if he comes out you remember the Lord and you fight Hallelujah listen I see it all the time in churches we spend so much time fighting with each other when we should be fighting for each other maybe if we just start fighting for each other for once instead of fighting with each other we'd get somewhere listen that's what the enemy wanted to do he sent all these letters try to get him a fight with each other but Nehemiah said no you stand together and you fight for the Lord you remember who you're fighting for you're not just in the fight for yourself listen if you're sitting here today in this church you are not here for yourself only people are looking at your testimony people are dependent on you what's your next move what's your stand look like and what you hold up in your trials what you hold up in adversity is what they're going to see do you fold and run away like everybody else or do you stand there and say if I've got to I will die this day for the kingdom of God but the people will know if I die there's at least one person there's still a witness on the earth God Still's got one brother B said a token it's not of effective unless it's on display amen one of the things I see I don't want to go too far with this I guess but I'm here we're here now amen sometimes people they they wander away from the truth they wander away from the faith the family will fight them tooth and nail and I'm thinking if you fight for them as hard as you fought with them they'd have a place to come back to I'm not supposed to be the one keeping people out I'm trying to get them into the kingdom listen they've got enough obstacles trying to keep them out I don't want to be one of them my father he told me he wants his house full amen I don't care if they're the most backslid Heathen devil Pagan in the world if God's going to give them a shot then I want to help them I will fight for them I'll lay my life I've got to I'll be any sort of unpopular I'll be called any kind of a name cuz that one soul is worth 10,000 worlds to God I listen I get it sometimes those are the hardest ones to fight for why should I fight for a bunch of people they don't care about me and they're so ungrateful well that's what Jesus did for you that's why when you weren't grateful when you weren't thankful for it while we were yet sinners enemies of God in our own thinking amen he stood in the gap for us thank you Jesus listen the people listen these people of Israel when they come out of Egypt and they're in the wilderness man they drove Moses up the wall I can't imagine a church of two million people Feed Us Moses do this Moses do this that this and that shut up I ain't got no paid vacation time I ain't got no you know what I'm saying I mean they man just day after day well you're not the only holy man Moses and this and that Moses Humanity came out a few times in that but you know what he had a real opportunity one time God said you know I'm done with his people I'm going to wipe them out Moses I'll take you and I'll raise up and F family in your name I'm done with this people and this same Moses oh Hallelujah yes this same Moses brother was the spirit of Christ he rose up and he stood in the gap for these ungrateful unored unth thanful people and they drove him up the wall and here he is Lord you're going to wipe them out take my name out of your book that's the problem we get we we're trying in our Humanity people get close to us sometimes and we we let that dictate our response when we ought to let the love of God listen I ought to be able to love the drug addict in the streeten that's shot up IID be to love them as much as my own child talk about the love of God I'm not going to necess put them in college or anything like you know what I mean we get real hallelujah what what are we fighting for amen he stood in the gap for us listen the battle is greater than just you or I today amen we lose sight that it's a battle but I love it because Nehemiah says remember the Lord amen remember the real hero there's one real hero in this whole story we can talk about The Heroes of Faith we can preach a whole sermon about that but without Jesus Christ it's all meaningless amen he's the one real hero in this thing and listen he's not the hero of this world this world hates him he is listen they don't have parades in his honor every year in California amen they Mock and they make fun of and they they despise us amen he's not the hero of the world but the one to come the one he died and rose again to make for us amen men like William tle like I mentioned earlier they didn't die for the world they were living in but for the one they knew they would create by their sacrifice they would make a way for us to have a Bible they'd make a way for us to believe this today amen Jesus is not he's not he's not received in this world is a hero because his kingdom is not of this world but he is the hero of a greater the one we're going to amen listen that's something worth fighting for yes that's something worth living for that's worth dying for amen listen in this country we remember the Alim amen we remember these men like DAV COC they died the Alamo when Sam Houston goes down there to make war on Mexico We Remember the Alamo we remember Pearl Harbor we remember dece we remember all these things we remember September 11th we remember all these things they they created an image in our minds amen but let us today as Christians remember the Lord that's the one we're going to remember amen he is even now the captain of the host of the army of the Lord amen amen we've heard a message amen what is it brother Ram said it's a it's a trumpet to declare a scriptural War that's what the seals are about amen it's a trumpet amen and I love it because all these people they're all spread out so they there's some down in Honduras there's some in India there's some in this place there's some in in in in in you know African countries and some in Europe they're all over the place got nothing to do with one another amen but NE says when you hear the trumpet sound listen it's not going to give an uncertain sound the trumpet that's going to sound will prepare you for the day of battle when you hear the trumpet sound gather to this amen listen we've heard a trumpet it's more than just a geographical location I can go hundreds of miles out of this country and find people that believe the exact same message that you and I believe what is it the trumpet is sounded we're going to war and we're going to win amen gather at the trumpet don't gather at the uncertain sound gather at the revealed word gather at the message of the hour gather around this if you gather to this trumpet the Lord shall fight for us neemi have been talking a lot about how they're going to fight when you fight for your sons fight for your daughters but he reminds you listen you're not the only one fighting you gather around this message this trumpet Our God shall fight for us that's a real good deal right there cuz listen he don't lose battles he don't lose Wars amen if God's fighting for you you're in a pretty good listen if God be for us can be against us don't fear you've heard the trumpet sound it's Jehovah ni Our God shall fight for us amen listen let me just say say this you don't defeat Satan today by confessing the power of Satan I know some churches that are like that well the devil's so big and the devil's the devil's nothing to God it's not like they're close Rivals we act like oh he's so oh we're gonna listen he he doesn't even have the keys to his own house what are you and some people they get there and they testify well the double this and the double that and he's so big and he's so scary I couldn't fit him in my pocket if I wanted to he's so insignificant compared to God listen some people's Gods the size of of David and their Devils the Goliath and that's how they see it they're not seeing what's on the inside oh the devil's so big and the devil's well you need a different God then cuz your God you can't even fit him in the palm of your hand time to change Gods this God is not scared of the devil our God is Not aright AF frighted of the enemy amen he's not worrying about the devil's next move he's got him ready like a book he plays him like a fiddle he ain't nothing before the hand of [Applause] God well that's the truth amen I get so sick of it amen listen you don't defeat the Devil by confessing his power listen some people that sit there and they fuss with the devil Jesus never fussed with the devil he told him what to do amen help me out somebody some preacher they get to preach and we're going to Trash Talk the devil and this and that and we'll get all excited listen Jesus said don't Rejoice that the devils are subject to you rejoice cuz your names are in heaven Hallelujah let me just throw this in here too you know most people complain about the devil most the time it's their own making the problem they got well you know it's almost humorous you know you're going down the road and you're going 55 in that school zone where it's 25 you get pulled over and you're like man the devil that's stinking I think the problem is you were Speedy well I took six days off work this week and now I have no paycheck oh the devil's after my finances right I'm GNA blame the enemy well quit blaming the enemy that's not how you defeat him anyway you lift up God hey man we get in the first side of trouble we sit there we fuss and fight oh I'm in so much trouble listen I don't make a habit of having conversations with the Devil he's not that interesting to talk to everything he says is a lie anyway why would you talk to him amen well glory to God this is bad I was talking to brother Paul Fontaine the other day about this you know some preachers man they every time they get well the devil the other day was talking to me the devil this like man I wish they talk to Jesus as much as they talk to the devil I get concerned when the preacher spends more time talking to Satan than he does Jesus amen well glory to God that's free it's the truth amen listen I've heard a different voice I don't have to listen to the enemy I can tell him it is written and guess what you resist the devil he'll you don't have to Fluss and fight and argue you lift up the Lord oh listen you're going to die no the Bible says I shall not die but live to declare the works of the Lord amen the Bible says I've already passed from death into life even if I was to go in the ground today he can't touch one hair on my head amen praise the Lord listen our God is still Jehovah ni today amen amen you have to you have to lift him up amen if you hide him under a bush it doesn't work you got to lift it up amen When Trials come lift him up amen yeah I know that's what that person says but the Lord says amen he's still the same today you believe that listen I don't know anybody maybe I'm hi Jan I tell a story about you I don't know how many people know the story about Jana but my wife when she was she's getting ready to deliver Jana you know she uh they had uh they they'd broken her water they had induced my wife and the doctor I don't know he must have been one of the lower graduates of medical school he just kind of left my wife unattended and stuff and and he come back I think the nurse was the nurse checked on you and noticed that the baby was breached in other words the the uh the court had prolapsed is what it was the court had prolapsed in other words Janna's head had pinched off the umbilic according she' been without auction for for minutes and I'm in another room they told me to go out and wait while they're doing something and so I go back to the room and they will my wife out on this stretcher or on the bed or whatever I'm like I have no idea what's going on and here she had been without oxygen for 13 minutes already so they were taking to do an emergency csection so the nurse comes in and the nurse begins to tell me well listen your child already went without oxygen for 13 minutes after 15 minutes brain damage sets in so she's giving me this bad Di diagnosis and I just kind of okay well you know I didn't say anything at first and so she you know how it is well this guy must not be listening to me because he's not weeping in this and if you did that's fine but I'm just she so she decides to repeat it again she like sir I don't know if you heard me but uh you should probably be prepared your daughter's going to have brain damage and I looked right at that nurse and said well listen I'd have reason to worry if I weren't a Christian amen well you know what she didn't say anything else that was nice that ended discussion amen and as you can see my daughter's here today the Lord has preserved her and I'm saying this for a reason it's so easy when we get a negative report oh man that's so bad but you know what I did I said I'm going to lift up the Lord I'd have a reason to worry if I weren't a Christian because listen I'm a Christian and no matter what happens God is faithful but I'm just silly enough I'm just I'm just crazy enough to believe that despite your report despite Medical Science God's going to deliver her safely and she's here today amen amen and man I didn't have to yell at the nurse I didn't have to rebuke nothing I lifted up the Lord my God is more than able listen I listen I can't take credit for it it's him I lifted up it's not me I didn't do anything that none of you could do you're all capable of doing the same thing that's not for my glory I'm not the one that gets it it's the one you lift up I lifted him up and he showed up Hall praise the Lord listen I just I believe that about the message I believe that this message is this that great amen I believe you don't have to try to fix it or polish it up or make it look special or whatever it's already special because it's Jesus Christ that's like the story I talked about went the first time I went overseas to Uganda these this brother he he left the Pentecostal church had a church of 900 people and he left this cuz he heard the message he believed it and he was a bishop and everything else left the Pentecostal Church lost two two-thirds of his church and you know brother talks about a brush Harbor they're meeting under a brush Harbor they've got straw and sticks that's what they got they got a generator and one light bulb and let me tell you when you're preaching at night and I'm not trying to sound racist now but when you're preaching at night there in the African jungle it's hard to see people with one light bulb amen praise the Lord I'm just like where are they at I got a microphone and one light bulb and I'm preaching to these people they they said will you go preach for this brother I said i' love to stand with somebody that stands with the message cuz listen it would have been easy for him to follow the message when he had no following but he knew it would cost him it cost him 600 people it cost him a salary it cost him standing but he want to stand with the message because he believes it's true I want to stand with somebody like that amen listen if I feel that way about it how much more does God feel that way about it if you stand for him he will stand for you that's Jehovah ni amen let's stand for I went I preach and it's funny cuz these six Pentecostal ministers they show up they're walking through there in the mud it's like night time out they come up there and they're they're they're coming to see what happened to their their previous associate and they're laughing and making fun they see that he doesn't even have a church building and stuff and they're laughing at this Rabel and this message and stuff and uh so we begin to have the service and I begin to preach and it's funny because I remember just like I'm talking you now there was a woman she was laying here on a like a a like a bed or something and I just thought she was tired because you know they were supposed to start service at 3:00 and didn't start till 6:00 cuz that's how African time works at it's where I've gone and so we get done and uh they said we want you to pray for this woman up here I said oh I don't I'm sorry I didn't realize she had something wrong what's wrong with her so she's paralyzed on the whole right side of her body so I went with The Interpreter and I began to pray for her and I looked at The Interpreter said tell her to stand up in the name of Jesus Christ he looked at me like I was insane which is you know maybe a rational respon response but said no tell her to stand up and I took her by one hand and he took her by the other hand and she stood up and she walked through that meeting and so the people they start gathering around and there's a guy who comes up and this guy this remember he's blinding his right eye he wanted me to pray for his eye to be open and so I cover his good eye his left eye and I start praying for him and I'm not even done praying he says I can see the trees in the distance and I'm thinking I can't see the trees in the distance thank you Jesus and God opened this man's eyes and God be to do these different miracles in the meetings and this is why I say this these Pentecostal ministers you know how they are they went from laughing and making fun and going oh oh well well these are Miracles now we want to see this and they're on the edge of their seat and they're watching all this so they want to talk to me this is why I said they all wanted to talk to me afterwards so we go in this little Hut I guess or whatever like they're talking to me and they're just all of a sudden these guys they're laughing fun they're having a good time man that was great and this and that I said tell us how do you do these things I said well if you want to do these things do what your brother did preach the message beauti amen it's not me it's not even him it's the one we represent I'm not special amen but the one in me is and I'm not saying that for my sake the same one in you can do the same things it's all about who you lift up you can lift up anxiety you can lift up reservations and self-doubt and pity you can lift up circumstances or you can remember the Lord amen praise the Lord praise the Lord oh but brother I'm discouraged people don't like me well listen there's a couple people that don't like me either well people have hurt me I've been wounded listen if a man like Thomas punkin can hold up a United States flag without any arms who are you and I to say well I can't do it listen if you've got breath in your body you can hold up the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if that man with no arms can hold up an American flag we can hold up the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let me just say this too sometimes people go through trials and stuff like that and they're not the first ones dancing in church and they're not having a good time and some people sit there say well listen man if they if they had Faith like me listen just because the Soldier's wounded doesn't mean they're not a soldier still I mean listen if they showed up to the battle you ought to be so grateful somebody's holding up the flag listen you don't look at Thomas Punk that guy that was dumb that's what he gets for holding that flag up no he's a hero listen our natural country would honor a man like that how much more would Jesus Christ yeah they're hurt yeah they're would so help them out just because a soldier's hurt doesn't mean they're out of the fight that's right don't ever discount somebody because they're under fight fire amen listen some of you going through all kinds of Trials brother Marty you going through all kinds of things amen sister sh where' she go she disappeared going through all kinds of many of us have gone through all kinds of things but you know what we're here today and we're reporting for duty if you got hurt in the fight it doesn't make you less of a soldier there you are sis God bless you right back there the whole time I probably looked her six times list you don't get great victories without great battles amen we all want great testimonies well then you're going to have to go through some battles am but today I don't want to leave here without giving the enemy a black eye and reminding him you know what you've thrown all kinds of stuff at me you've thrown all kinds of stuff at these people here today but you know what they're still here cu no matter what you throw at them no weapon formed to against them shall prosper amen every tongue that shall rise up against them in judgment shall be condemned this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and the righteousnesses of him listen the devil has thrown every kind of thing he can at the Bride of Jesus Christ and we're still here and we're not here because we're such better soldiers than the next ones it's what we represent listen as long as a church as long as a family as long as an indiv idual will hold up the testimony of Jesus Christ they're Invincible as soon as we let the bars down as soon as we let things that's where we lost the battle it's not the enemy's fault right if our strength is small in the day of adversity amen I'm thankful today for people of intercession let's stand and pray for one another let's stand in the Gap like Moses did amen listen if it's Moses has turned to stand up and we support Moses if it's somebody else's turn we support him amen we let's hold up one another in prayer today let's hold up the different ones lost loved ones we ought to be praying for them not less but it's a much or more than we ever have before amen this is not the time oh listen they're so far gone what a great testimony it's going to be amen see it's not a big problem it's a greater testimony when God gets done it's all what you hold up amen would you join with me today as we stand to our feet let's just stand not just to your feet but stand as Witnesses of Jesus Christ amen maybe someone would defy gravity say you know what God has been faithful in my life I want you to let every you know John when he cried out everything in Heaven and Earth and beneath the Earth heard him I want everybody to know whose side I'm on I'm flying my colors today I'm representing today I'm standing with the Lord Jesus Christ I'm standing with this message no matter what comes I'm not backing down I'm doubling down I'm going to stand for this word he said if I'll stand for him before men he'll confess me before the father if we suffer with him we shall also reign with him you're discouraged today be encouraged lift up Jesus Christ over your discouragement you being discouraged does not make you less of a Christian this means you're fighting a different part of the battle than maybe somebody else you're just as valuable listen God's looking at your stand in the midst of discouragement that's right when it's not easy to praise him when it's not easy to stand for him you stand anyway that's when it means something not just to God but to everybody else that's looking fight for your sons fight for your daughters fight for your brethren fight for your houses amen amen God give us a backbone the size of a saw log today too many wishbones in the church today we need some more backbone amen we're standing today on the solid rock let's let's pray today Father we we are not a weakened people though we are the lowest and weakest of all yet in our weakness your strength is made perfect amen and it's not by our might or our power but by your spirit that today I believe as the as as we have heard declared unto us there's an invincible Army on the face of the Earth amen it is not the strength of our arms our own intelligence but the might of the same spirit that fell in the day of Pentecost that has preserved a church through Dark Ages and persecutions and false doctrines but Lord you never left your people you never forsook your people thank you Lord you've never lost the battle thank you Lord you never will Lord today I pray for each one may you may you Foster in us a greater care as we pray for one another as we pray for the Lost may we stand what it's unpopular may we stand for the right thing we're not here to stand against people today we understand the weapons of our Warfare they're not carnal but they are Mighty against principalities and powers and might and dominion and though our enemies they're married though they seem to be everywhere we understand that there are more for us than against us we're surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses by an innumerable company of angels the spirit of God the spirit of burning is in our midst today Lord I believe your faithful bring us through every trial through every circumstance there's a people here though they be in fiery trials yet the fiery trying of their faith the trying of their faith is it's worth more than gold tried in the fire lord it doesn't always feel like it that doesn't always seem like it but you've testified it and we believe it's true I pray you just bless this church bless each one if there be the different needs represented here today Lord may you just undertake for each individual may you be glorified in all that's said and done we thank you Lord may you renew our strength renew our Vigor for the battle And We Gather always around the revealed word and make it our standard make it our place of Refuge I pray we thank you for all these things in in Jesus name amen you know that
