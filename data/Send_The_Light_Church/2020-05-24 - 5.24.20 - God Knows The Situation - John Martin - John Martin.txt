there is just no end to that love it is it is boundless and he gave us he proved his love as he gave his life for the world that they might be saved and what a shame it would be to not give our life back to the Lord Jesus Christ after what he's done for us hey man we're gonna take our prayer request up before the Lord and as most of you a number of requests have been given into the what's happened I like using that that for a way of communication that we might be know how to pray one for another and be encouraged one of another sister Linda had a request to pray for John Larson he had a stroke and it was a possible heart attack hadn't heard but he was in the hospital and he's needing Hump healing and and comfort so let's remember to pray for John Larson amen and I believe his his wife was Carmen and at that time it couldn't go in and be there and in the room as you know with the cove in nineteen so let's pray for both John and Carmen Larson let's also remember to pray for sister hope that Linda's been helping amen and then brother Larry had put a request in a little bit ago on the whatsapp to please pray for God to make himself known in the hearts of my wife and my daughters in such a wonderful request i if you would just pray for all of our children who need to know the Lord in a way that he's life he's the only source of life and they need him there's no and let's just pray for one another's children and our loved ones amen brother Roger talked to him yesterday and he wanted us to remember once again his dad please don't stop praying for his dad his bedroom cancer but also feeling that this is the end maybe just battling giving up and just moving on with death and that such a horrible thing to - - to be battling in your mind so let's just pray that God reveals himself to him above everything that you'd have salvation and just know him as as the Lord and and as healer amen because God is he's he is a healer and he's still able he hasn't lost any powering then we as you know brother Ron clayton oneness - remember brother Bruce and prayer with the complications and we heard a good report from brother Bruce today that he's every day is just getting better and better he's he's up and about and able to do some driving just hard for him to to get up and Lord knows exactly the scent of the damage and what has transpired but we know God is he's a restorer a man and he's obviously working on brother Bruce real well let's continue to to pray for him as we give thanks to the Lord for what he's doing what he's done for brother Bruce men sister Kathleen had a number of requests and if we could remember to pray for her friend Joel palaces new grandson Roco I believe that's high pronounced and if it's not please forgive me sister Kathleen with gastric reflux problems causing breathing issues so let's remember that new grandson also for Cathy French with pancreatic cancer she's been in and out of the hospital a few times the last couple weeks let's just pray that God would intervene in their behalf she's been on the vent the ventilator and just needs a real miracle from the Lord if we could remember to pray for Karen in Brad Merrick they're Christians and they're asking for prayer there they're having a baby boy on June 17 if it would be that time and maybe it's it's set today to be that way but that baby has a serious heart defect and needs immediate surgery after the bird is going right in and have surgery so that is a real critical situation if we could remember Karen and Brad Merrick and their little baby and June 17th also Citra Kathleen's niece Colleen and her husband Dan are asking for prayer they're having a baby girl and it has possible heart problems as well and Colleen is a anxious and of course anyone would be battling that at this time let's pray for her that God would just give her peace and trust that God will work in His grace and her behalf and that God would just give her a safe delivery and the baby would be well and healthy and also they requested prayer to draw close to Jesus we could remember that request as well also we want to continue to pray for brother Marty's sister Kathleen's brother-in-law Andy for a full recovery from his lung problems that he's been suffering with and that Andy and marine would both receive salvation and and come to know Lord Jesus in the way that precious brother Marty and sister Kathleen know the Lord I mean God is able amen amen so let's just stand together and take these requests before the Lord let's remember to pray for all those battling in the Cova 19 pandemic let's pray for those that are in authority and just that for our nation that it would just recover and heal no these are a lot of requests but I believe our God is

our brother just brought those before the Lord and we appreciate that we never want to forget God's missionaries that are laboring for his eternal purpose amen we wanted to also announce that a week from today we're going to be gathering at the church and having our first service there since we've shut down and I think it was my wife that sent you this little little thing here it says Trump announced that the house of worship are essential calls on the governor to open them up and I just want to say amen to that I believe that the house of worship is essential amen and and I don't believe in tempting the Lord to believe in use and wisdom but you can take anything out of balance and too far because I don't know how many sick people that went to brother branham's meetings they didn't go anywhere else but they just if they could just meet and they would go across the country you know looking for healing so there's a there's truly a balance there and but let's be in in prayer bring your mask with you if you're gonna wear a mask you want to bring your mess with you into the service anyways but we'll try to have some there's we made mention just in case you wanted to have a mask but not everybody's going to be using a mask and we're gonna be having brother Roger help us in trying to keep things clean and through the services and seaton us and in good distances with with one another just the best we can and knowing that everybody's going to be able to gather together but I want to make it available for those that can and desire to so let's remember that so this will be really our last hour less service here I never thought about it like that I'm kind of going to miss it because you know if when they forget things you know when I get to church like I can just run upstairs and grab them and get back to church when I've forgotten things in the past I have to call back Holmen s shower and to bring him amen let's get ready to get into the wordless sing by his word will prevail and stand together amen praise the Lord his word ah preemie is word ah [Music] I his word [Music] over I his word overcome ah his love ah prepare here's [Music] uh-uh [Music] overcome ah his reign Griffen by his great yeah hi history her car how overcome ah is were my over amen amen let's enter into that word that we need that word to overcome amen that's what Jesus used on the devil Hey amen by his word we will prevail turn with me if you would to the book of Saint Matthew chapter 10 st. Matthew chapter 10 and a great quote today that we have a chance to gather together in the name of the Lord and just being gathered together in his name he promised to be there in the midst it's called church and we're all having church in our homes but it's by the one spirit that unites us together and that were able to have church in the spirit of God amen and the spirit of his love amen before we begin reading there let's just ask God's blessings on this part of the service how many father we thank you for your precious word today that we can have it as a sword to prevail and to overcome and to be victorious in a walk with you Lord know the enemy he's not going to just give up and lay down but we've got about to take the Word of God and claim your promises and resist the enemy no God we just pray at this time that you were to bless and anoint your word to our hearts and give us precious precious precious revelation of your word today Lord we're depending on that we're not leaning to our understanding Lord but we're leaning upon the revelation of God we're trusting you for it today as we commit this part of the service and ask your blessings on four heart and life in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen may Matthew chapter 10 verse number 29 through 31 just three verses there are not two sparrows sold for a farling and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear ye not therefore ye are more value than many sparrows amen god bless you may be seated god knows the situation knows the situation that we're living in knows what is trying to happen in our nation and we know the enemy is working in the minds of those that he can get in and use these situations for their gain causing confusion to help the world and i believe it would be the devil's job to try to get us distracted with those things see God knows the situation God knows your situation because you have a situation but God has the situation too and it would doesn't matter to the devil what our minds are preoccupied with in this world if the pandemic wasn't here it'd be something else and he's just trying to get us off of of what our mind should be on and which is the situation that's going on in heaven with God his purpose and what he wants us to be doing because whether it's a pandemic or we're just you know we're out enjoying life so good because we got to raise and the economy is really doing great it it what doesn't matter God is still moving forward with his purpose to get the rest of his family saved so we can get out of here and be together as a family so - God he still got one purpose amen now to the devil he just tried everything he an with every gun to get us so distracted but God knows the situation he knows all about it and we want to just maybe talk a little bit about trying to flatten the curve of fear as we're moving forward because as we gather together in churches and things open up I mean we've gonna be facing a lot of fear of who's you know is it possible that it's you know we could catch something and you know and we're and I'm sure we're gonna be dealing with this in the fall and the winter we just we just have to move forward with a greater faith amen and not have to have everything so perfect that we don't have to fear we have to face fear we have to look at it we have to say I'm a believer I'm trusting in the Lord and a moving forward now God knows every single thing he is omniscient he's he knows everything amen he is it means all-knowing God has complete infinite knowledge awareness and understanding he just he knows everything God is completely aware of each one of us and our situations he knows all about he knows what we're going through what we've been going through he keeps a running total of the hairs that are on her head I mean every time we call my or brush it we take a shower I mean hair leaves our body and so the number keeps decreasing but he knows the very numbers of our hair the hairs of our head they're very the Bible says Jesus said the very hairs of your head are all numbered think about that that's that's some amazing that God has that knowledge right there it is his fingertips at the end of each day he knows how many steps you've taken we've got little apps to kind of see how many steps we've taken we've got apps to see any calories we burn he knows how many calories we burn he knows how many calories we take in every day brother Branham said in the message things that are to be in December 5th 1965 he says everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you would be here the infinite God known and to be infinite he had to know every flea that ever would be in the earth and how many times it would bat its eye that's infinite see our little minds cannot fathom what infant means the infant God he known all thing therefore there's nothing out of cater all praise God you know what's in the world it sonicator right now to the nation it sonicator but with God in God's economy nothing is out of cater praise the Lord when God sent Moses with a stick into Egypt God already knew that his magicians Pharaoh's magicians were gonna play this trick and lay down their their their sticks and turn into snakes he already knew that it wasn't hid from him he knew exactly how many frogs were gonna be released how many fleas were how many lice and how many locusts is we're gonna he knew exactly the number of every one of them that released with those place he knew feral would harden his heart and not want to let the people go of course we know that that God hardened his heart but he just put it in it to be so gradient to what what didn't really belong to him amen and he didn't like the idea of just letting the people go things look like they're going haywire but there's really nothing out of cater God's got everything in control now God didn't tell mo everything that was gonna happen so he had a trust him to this time when things looked like they were getting out of control they weren't God knew about it and God had confidence in Moses that he could stand there and and and and be faithful trusting God and we got to do that same thing today the Bible declares that there's not one creature that is not manifest in the sight but all things are naked and open unto his eyes of him of whom we have to do and in fact Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 tells us for the Word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit under the joints and the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart God knows everything he knows all about your situation today yet with all the knowledge that we have of God Satan can make us to feel like we're separated from God at times many times in life we can feel no one understands what we're going through maybe nobody cares why me Lord how could you allow this to happen why do I have to suffer like this why do I have to go through this what's going on can't others see my situation it's amazing with all the the assurance that I know God he knows everything but in the midst of all that we can still question and allow the enemy to make us feel like something's out of cater but God knows your situation he knows all about it we just have to learn to cast our cares upon him amen he cares for us because our infinite God does know everything before it ever even happens he's the only one that can use what Satan is through at us and rearrange it in such a way that it works out for our good Satan I can mean it as harm people can mean it as harm but you know God just gets there and makes it work out for the good amen romans 8:28 we wanted to just kind of look at this a little bit this morning if it be okay with you and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are the called according to his purpose he is able to rearrange every situation in your life and make it work out for your good now only God can do that see when God created man in His image God had a purpose in his mind to express to himself to that man he created man in His image and he wanted man to be in his image but yet there were certain attributes as we know so he allowed that fall to take place so that God could express himself in family matters because God as I said is a family man and he wanted to express himself as a father to his sons and daughters to you and me he wanted to express himself as a husband to his wife you and me see what I'm saying he wanted that both of those expressions to be felt by us God wanted to express himself to let us know that he loves us he wants to cover us amen love covers a multitude of sin he wanted to express himself as a healer to us as a redeemer as a savior he wanted to express those things to us these great attributes so he created man in His image and he wants man to be in his image now and God has never strayed from his purpose yet to have his sons and daughters in that same image his wife in that same image you may have already been saved but there's other other things other attributes that God wants to express to you maybe to express his wisdom and you to express a greater faith in you did suppress his spirit to express his healing there's certain things that God wants to express in you because he wants you in His image amen but there's people that are outside of the realms of knowing God in the way that we know him and God wants to express himself in the way of salvation to them in them and it's part of his eternal purpose so God has never strayed normally ever stray from his eternal purpose that visions 3 expresses the desire that God has to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery is and in verse number 9 Ephesians chapter 3 the Bible says that it was hid from it was hid in God from the beginning of the world so God didn't really make this known at the beginning this this thought process of expressing all these attributes that he had in in man and and bringing man from Satan's Eden back into his image verse number 10 to the intent that now unto the powers and heavenly places this mystery might be made known by the church a man who's who's making it known by the church the manifold wisdom of God amen according to his to the eternal purpose not our purpose not what we got going not what we want to build but according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord amen is God God lost a third of the angels in heaven God wants to fill heaven up with his family he wants his sons his daughters he wants his wife there he wants only in heaven what belongs to him amen that all encouraged us this morning Ephesians chapter 1 verse 11 by God's infinite knowledge and endless wisdom we have been predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will nothing God is not going to sit back and let anybody control his will God is in control God is going to fulfill his will his word will not return void it will accomplish that which it was spoken for and that's why when God has spoke his word to you I'll think about all the things that God spoke to you we need to be confident this very thing that he would have begun a good work in you he will perform it unto the day of Jesus Christ and as long as we're growing in God's love loving him with all of our heart with all of our soul with all of our might with all of our mind with all that we have as long as we're working for God's eternal purpose and that is to get all his family together well we know we have a revelation we know it all things work together for the good to them that are called according to his purpose amen to them that love God amen to them who are the called according to his purpose I want to think about the scripture we can break it down into two ways that we've got to love God and we've got to be called according to his purpose or and what there's truth in it to look at it like that or we could look at it in the aspect of how what that love is being defined because you me remember brother answers we can love God every day and still miss it so it's a love that is it's an unconditional love and not a conditional love and that love has to be that we love God so much that we work we allow him to use us we're called to his eternal purpose amen and that's the deepness of that love and that's the same love that God have when he when he when he sent His only begotten Son to die on the cross for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son and and when that love when we love God back with that same love that he loves was I'm telling you were called to his eternal purpose nothing nothing's gonna separate us and everything's gonna work out for our good amendments right praise the Lord we should never be satisfied with just being called of God many are called few are chosen we've got to be called to his purpose not just a salvation but called to his purpose chosen according to his eternal purpose amen praise the Lord perceive we the love of God first John don't you don't to go there him you can first John chapter 3 verse 16 if you want to write down Percy V the love of God a God loved us he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the brother amen so if you want to perceive what kind of love we're talking about we're talking about that right there the love of God praise the Lord God is able to rearrange things to work out to our favor with that love where it benefits us spiritually may not benefit us physically we may not get what we want in fact we usually don't but I'm telling he's able to work everything out to our favor so we don't have anything to fear we need to flatten the curve flatten the the fear curve amen jesus said fear ye not therefore ye are more ye are of more value than many sparrows and God knows the sparrows that fall down which you know the only time we really think of of of a bird that falls or that dies is when we see a dead bird where we hit it with the car or it hits a window in our house and then it it dies and then we begin to think about the value of that life that burden but think about the billions and billions of birds that have died over the years the sparrows that have died and God knew every one of them we don't even think of it and if God could take if he knows that don't you think he knows your situation what you're going through what you're struggling with what you're bothered with what's let God work out everything you just focus on what you need to do which is love them with all your heart and be working according to his purpose and I'm telling you everything's gonna work out okay Luke chapter 12 verse 32 jesus said fear not little fly for it is the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom he's got his mind set on giving it to you amen oh boy you think about an inheritance he just just wanna holla get on he wants to share it remember at the very beginning he at the very beginning had these attributes he wanted to share them and then he is able to do it he's able to give you the kingdom he's able to bring you in his image amen we've been predestinated to it 2nd Corinthians chapter 9 verse 8 says and God is able to make all grace abound toward you that he always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work so God is able he holds the power to make grace abound unto you amen because he knows everything he knows how to take this situation and and these these things that are going on and and and and make grace abound in your life so there's nothing to fear nothing to fear fear is of the devil fear has torment and Satan enjoys tormenting our minds with so many unknowns what about this what about that well what's gonna happen if that happens what's gonna happen to us if if if this happens and what about this and what about that Satan loves tormenting our minds with the unknown he's always trying to get us to have to answer him well we don't have to answer them the bride don't have to answer the devil and the bride don't need to know what's going on to to be able to not fear to be able to trust in God she trusts in her Heavenly Father and then she trusts in her husband there's nothing to fear we don't got to know our future to be able to trust in God it's a total separation God will put us through the test he will put us through the fiery furnace he may put us in the lion's den he may put us in the in the dungeon like he did Joseph he may put us in the garden where we have to say not my will but thy will be done we're gonna go through things we just gotta trust him praise God praise the Lord Jesus Christ 2nd Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 very familiar scripture for God have not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and a sound mind there's two different spirits fears of the devil so anytime you begin you question because of fear what we should be doing is just resist that thing immediately don't try to answer it the devil is wanting you to answer it because number one you can't answer it God ain't gonna show you and tell you everything you're not some spiritual genius where you know everything God never won cheatin already never told Moses everything God want you to learn to trust him that's what he wants because when you do that you're expressing your love Amen you're expressing something to him that is very high very high that you're you trust him in the middle of the unknown because anybody can trust God when you know if I know that I'm never gonna run out of money I'm gonna have houses and boats and cars and many vacations and lots of money and if I wasn't being you'll need to trust but God has to put us through a bunch of stuff because the trial of our faith is much more precious than gold tried in the fire made much more precious than gold we need to allow God to have his way with us he knows what he's doing that faith needs to be built to a place where we can come to a rapture in faith amen and that perfect love will bring such a perfect faith per rapture a mint love's got to be first you love God with everything you've got amen God's children don't operate by fear they operate by love that cast out all fear they operate by the power of faith that cast out all doubts they operate by the a sound mind that the devil can't use their mind for a playground a soundman you're in control because god you're using yourself to God you receive Jesus said you'll receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you well the power is the Holy Ghost it's the it's the let this mind that was in Christ being you it's okay to suffer the mind of Christ says it's okay to suffer I'm okay with that hey many for God have not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind you know we have heard that God carries us through difficult times we've all heard about those one set of footprints that's walking through the sand and to the carnal mind we're going through a hard time and we feel that God's just left us like why'd you make me walk that that's when I needed you the most in and in you were you just let me alone you let me feel alone and we'll come to find out that wasn't his footprints those were Jesus's footprints Jesus was carrying him and then through the difficult times Jesus carries us through the difficult times and the rest of time he's holding on he's holding us we have nothing to fear Saints nothing to fear dogs jesus said in Saint John chapter 10 verse 28 and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand amen you're hid with Christ and then no man can pluck can seize can snatch can force you to be taken away out of the hand of Jesus Christ amen no man is able to pluck them out of my hand he says that personally you're in my hand no man can pluck you out there's some security right there look at verse 29 he's not talking about his hand in this one he says my father which gave them to me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand you talked about the grip hey man that's an iron grip it's like you're in Jesus's hand and then and the father's God you're just uh and that day you'll know that I mean I'm in you and you and me and the father and and you brought it together amen amen were protected amen were protected that's the thing that we got to understand were protected in the hand of Almighty God now that all flattened the curve of fear Satan can't get you because you're protected by the blood you're hiding in the blood the blood is covered you and Satan can't get to that blood cos if he got through that blood he'd be clean he can't go through there to get you it's the most powerful the most powerful thing that blood is what redeemed you that blood is what saved you that blood is what what he owes you amen God gave His life that we might be blessed with manifold blessings and loads us with benefits as as the Bible says amen Colossians 3 says your life is hid with Christ in God your life is hid with Christ in God amen Psalms 32 verse 7 thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shalt come pass me about with songs of deliverance amen thou art my hiding place your hid in the hand of God and then praise the Lord it's a secret place of the Most High that Satan can't get to it he can't get to it nothing can get to you when you're under the blood of the omniscient God the all-knowing he's protecting you from every thing he is the almighty infinite God now that all be flattening the curve just a little bit should be increasing your faith it should be increasing your courage it should be increasing your boldness it should be stabilizing your current situation because God will help you no matter what we don't need to look to others for help that kind of makes God jealous anyways he wants you to look to him amen Hebrews chapter 13 verse 5 let your conversation be without covetousness be without what let your life your behavior the words that you speak the life let it be without what and be content with such things as you have for he have said I will never leave you I will never forsake thee amen he is holding us in his hand he's not gonna leave it he's not gonna drop you and then he's not gonna leave you in that terrible situation the thing is he's faithful but as soon as you listen to the devil listen to what I'm gonna tell you as soon as you listen to the devil and you say yeah where is he at he must have left at that point your own confession your own confession because he acts upon the confession of your faith amen whatever you professed that's the way it is if you believe he's gone he can only act according to your faith just exactly maybe we could read that just pull that up for me and hebrews chapter 3 verse number 1 let's read that wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession what are you professing what's your profession let it be a positive one amen let it be a positive profession ah he said we should have boldness amen I will never leave thee I will never forsake thee Hebrews chapter 13 verse 6 so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me praise God for God has not given us the spirit of fear but power love and of a sound mind that we should have bonus the Lord is our helper there is no reason that we should be sad that her countenance should be fallen that we should be a talkerin under the spirit of what the devil is trying to do to this world trying to do to this nation amen we should be standing out like a sore thumb we're Christians God's got me in his hands I got bonus to say the Lord is my helper today I don't know where you stand but I'm standing with Jesus that's what we ought about to say when to everybody and everything everything that we come in contact I'll tell you if you want to give an answer to to The Devil's woes just tell them the Lord is my helper Amen I'm not going to fear what you or anybody does to me Amen when Jesus gave his trained disciples their final Commission in Matthew chapter 28 he said go and teach all nations in other words it's time to put into action what I've been training you with and now you think about a lot of times when we I you trained somebody you spend time with them and they go through something and they make mistakes and they want they want the glory for everything that you know God's doing it in their life and that's why when you you get a deacon you don't want some novice that's puffed up and just trying to look to get something out of it it's it's not us it's all about God and a lot of times you train somebody in you're training them they make a lot of mistakes and they fall well eventually they have to get to the place where you just let them go you let them go and this is exactly what Jesus was doing when he gave him the the Commission to go he out in verse number 20 he on Matthew chapter 28 verse 20 teaching them go and teach all nations teaching the nations to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and long with you always even to the end of the world wow talk about the protection he's with you to the end of the world God knows all of our situations but he's still with us to the end they had to carry out the Commission to the end and he said I'll be with you to the end why was that so important because as soon as you begin to teach all nations everything that God has spoken to you because that's what he told right here as soon as you begin to do that persecution arise and people are gonna make you feel so odd they're gonna push you away they're not gonna want to talk to you they're not nothing to do with you they're gonna say things behind your back they're gonna make you talk negative at work about you negative stuffs gonna happen persecutions gonna happen but you know what Jesus said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you to the end you keep preaching and then what I've told you in secret don't go preach it on the housetop let everybody know it ain't just for you friends you make everything so personal that as if it's just you and him what it's wonderful that he spoke it to you personally and there's certain things that only have to do with you I understand that but God isn't just interested in you he's not just interested in me I wake up every day knowing what uh how how low I am and how I'm just not capable of even functioning through the course of a day without the Lord Jesus Christ there's more to life than just us there's other brothers and sisters out there who we haven't even met and then and I want to spend eternity with them I know you do too we need to go out there and finish this race because he's called us to the Great Commission now the devil is continuously throwing fearful things in our faces and our minds to a lot of different avenues if it's not coming from one source it's coming from another source sometimes it seems like the is an army of devils and he's coming in like a flood but the Bible tells us that that God will raise up a standard he's just not gonna allow anything to happen to us amen that we can't bear he'll make a way for us amen I'm not saying he's not gonna let us fall because every parent has watched their children fall and there's nothing you can do about it because they're making choices and they have to make the wrong so they learned how to get back up and make the right choice that's Jimmy that's character it's part of life God allows us to follow praise Gandhi he gave us a remedy to get back up if a righteous man falls seven times seven times to get back up and then and if your brother Falls against you don't get the idea that all you need to do is forgive them seven times if you got the Spirit of God it'll be seven times seventy what do you mean brother John that's kind of hard yes it's hard even Peter said it's hard but here's the thing how many times do we sin against Jesus we think that part's okay God's gonna put us through the test just remember always remember what John Seddon for first John chapter four verse number four ye are of God little children and have overcome them the army of devils Amen them we say then that it was a boy it is it is it the Republicans as it's the Democrats is it is it is it who is them it seems like everywhere on the news everything that we're hearing everything worse is the devil trying to destroy everything ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world isn't it amazing how God can have you in the palm of his hand and he's also living inside of you he's inside he's outside he's leading by a pillar fire by a cloud by night a man or cloud by day praise the Lord I don't say everything's just perfect I know you're catching the spirit and that's the main thing Romans chapter 8 verse number 28 the one who tried to get through this because if I give time I want to go back to our opening scripture so lord help us Romans chapter 8 verse 28 wanna try to read this chapter here and and we know that all things work together for the good to them notice to them not just to you but to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose and what's his purpose his purpose is really being defined in verse 29 here and Foom for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son when God created man in His image that image was Jesus Christ and his purpose is to get us into that same image now it's not just us you're gonna see here that he might be the firstborn among many brethren now it's not right for me to only be thinking about myself and then brother brandon has made it real clear that i do not have the right to hear the gospel twice if somebody hasn't heard it once and i'm just think about what he's trying to express here because in this life it's all about you gather as much money as you can you gathering for retirement you're you're you you you you you're gathering to build your little our kingdom here but with God the way that you build your kingdom is you gather Jews you gather Jews and then you gather Jews for your crown because the Lord Jews you got the more you shine praise God it wasn't in my notes moreover whom he did predestinate them them I love that he also called and whom he called them he justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things of God before me no if God be for us for all his brethren if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his son but delivered him up for us ah yeah yeah that's right us not just me us all babies God we're family we're a family I've always loved a family something inside of me when I was in even in high school I just wanted a family there is this yearning and desire maybe it was cuz it was missing I don't know but I could certainly relate to her God wanted a family amen I just so much appreciate him this morning if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things amen and he's able to make all grace abound to us who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect again not one person but a bride amen it is God that justify it who is he that condemneth it really doesn't matter it really doesn't matter if they're just words right because the ultimate judge is God the ultimate judge is God and if you stand for him they'll stand for you if you take on his blood it doesn't matter what anybody's gonna say it is Christ that died gay Rather's risen again who's that even at the right hand of God who maketh intercession for us so he knows our situation he knows what we're going through he's interceding in our behalf amen who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation show distress persecution famine nakedness peril a sword who's gonna separate us Psalms 91 verse 14 and 15 just wanted to put this in here because he have set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him you want to be delivered from tribulation distress persecution famine peril sword from our situations set your love upon him just set your love upon mr. it's not simple I will set him on high because he have known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and not only that I will honor him praise God so don't let trouble bother you he's with you he's with you amen there are a couple of disciples that were walking on the road to demint Emmaus and you know the story after Jesus has suffered and died on the cross and when Jesus saw them he kind of came up to them and Luke chapter 24 verse 17 and he said what manner of communications RVs that you have one to another as you walk and our sadness I want you to think about this question what manner of communications are these that you have one with another as you walk in her said God is interested in her conversations he's interested on whether they're full of faith or they're sad and they answered in Luke chapter 24 verse 19 he said it was concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a mighty prophet I mean a prophet mighty in deed and the word and word before God and all the people so they began to talk about this man Jesus in verse 20 and now the chief priests and the rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified Him and Jesus let them go on talking he let him go on and on talking about all their walls and finally he had enough he had enough of what they were saying their negativity they're there they're there they're questioning if it bothered Jesus and he answered them in verse number 25 then he said unto them old fools and slow to heart to believe all that the prophets had spoken o not Christ to have suffered these things and generous glory that's the problem with most Christians they're slow to heart believing that they need to suffer they're looking for a gospel without suffering we're so to believe we have to suffer to bring about God's eternal purpose God Holanda suffering for no reason just as the only others my children see they suffer 19 and Friends you have to suffer to bring in the elective you have to suffer to get Jews in your crown you have to suffer somebody like laughing you at the face and calling you some lunatic or some high ball you have to stand there and suffer to love them to bring them in to be part of the family praise God God has an eternal purpose we need to love him so much that we fulfill the purpose to not be slow I hope you catch this a believer needs to be so in love with in God that no suffering can separate him I hope you catch what I'm saying don't miss it verse 36 as is written for thy sake we you and I are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all these things that we're going through all this suffering that we go through we are more than conquerors amen through him that loved us praise God so thankful that his love is not just on the outside but can't come on the inside and be our strong hiding place amen now why did it pleased the father to bruise Jesus because it was a part of God's eternal purpose amen What did he speak there in Genesis I know brother Ryan he said he likes to read Genesis it was really only a bruise on his heel it pleased God the Bible says it pleased the Lord to bruise him amen it was only a bruise on the heel amen because he came forth out of that tomb amen amen and the suffering that we go through Amen I believe is Romans 8 says that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in US and then we're not afraid of suffering amen we don't have to worry because God is in control amen God is in control verse 39 nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God today I'm sorry let me read verse 38 for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate all of us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord amen that's a great love that's a description of God's love receive II the love of God Christ lay down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the brother Psalms 119 verse 50 this is my comfort in my affliction for thy word have quickened me what do you need what do you need when you're going through your fliction you've got god's word it needs to be quickened to you when you realize that you're suffering according to the will of God happy is he I mean happy is he there's just a revelation there there's no murmuring and complaining you notice Jesus didn't murder and complaint they meant lord help us if the omniscient God who knows everything about your situation and you're protected in his hand and everything is working out for your good what is there to fear you know your value he gave himself for you that's pretty valuable focus on loving him according to his eternal purpose lay down your life constantly for the brother turn with me if you would tear opening scripture in Matthew chapter 10 I want to start about verse 16 I want to try to go through a few of these now I want you to think about Cain for a minute minute a minute Cain did not value the brother in fact he devalued the brother it was all about him how he could get ahead he did not esteem others he did not esteem his brother better than himself even though he did better he did not lay down his life for his brother rather he devalued him made little and killed his influence he had no use think about this Cain had no use for Abel in his family now I don't know where you're standing today but God is interested in his family and we need to make sure that we're understanding the scriptures to understand his eternal purpose that we need to value those that are out there esteem them as part of the family of God yes we don't know who's who and you're gonna be talking right to Devils you don't know you talk to people were rejecting Christ we don't know but we need to say to everybody and we need to get in those that are his amen let's start here verse 16 brother and behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves isn't that the truth right about now on this age be therefore wisest serpent now harmless as doves but beware of men for they will deliver you up to counsels and they so scourge you in their synagogues and he shall be brought before governors and kings for my name for my sake for a testimony against them and the Gentiles but when they deliver you up take no thought or what you shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak for it is not ye that speak but the Spirit of your father which speaketh in you you talking about being in the hand of God everything's gonna work out right you don't have to fright you don't have to fear God knows the situation before it happens and the father shall deliver up the brother to death and the father of the child and the children shall rise up against the parents and cause them to be put to death and he shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but the but he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved in other words don't stop preaching the word there don't stop but when they persecute you in this city flee into another for verily I'm saying to you you shall not have gone over the cities of Israel to the Son of man cometh the disciple is not above the master nor the servant above his Lord it is not it is enough for the disciple that he be as his Lord and the servant as I'm sorry the disciple be as his master and the servant as his Lord if they have called the master of the house Beelzebub how much more shall they call them of his household think about it you don't want to get persecuted how much more of the household of Jesus Christ amen I'll trust that you're of God's house today amen fear them not hallelujah fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be made known what I tell you in darkness that speak in the light hallelujah and what you hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetops in other words God's eternal purpose in all this is don't let suffering stand in the way of you preaching my word to the lost and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell are not two sparrows sold for a Farley and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your father knowing it but the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear ye not therefore ye are of more value than many of those sparrows that he knows that false whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will I confess before my father which is in heaven notice he knows what you're going through in the midst of this suffering he knows he knows all this / execution he knows when you're trying to reach out and love somebody to Christ but you know what if you confess Jesus Christ before men then Jesus will confess you before the Father which is in heaven but if you choose to deny me before men him will I also deny before my father which is in heaven we have a choice if the suffering is too much and you don't want to suffer think not that I come to send peace on the earth I came not to send peace but a sword a man a sword the Word of God is a sword a man it cuts and it divides and it gets right to the intent of somebody when you're talking to somebody don't be surprised God uses you to help that person to see what's happening for I am NOT come for I am come I'm sorry I'm come to set a man at variance with his father and the daughter against his mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be of his own household and he that loveth father more than father or mother or mother more than me is not worthy of me you're talking about love again remember all things work together for the good - then to love the Lord who are called them who are called according to his purpose well this is the purpose right here this is God's eternal purpose that were reading about he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me and he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that lose of his life for my sake shall find it see how of all these scriptures are coming together amen we've been studying so beautiful and that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a Prophet's reward and he that receiveth the righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple in other words don't try to get anything out of what you're doing for somebody don't try to get some sort of recognition give the coal a glass of cold water only in the name Lord I want to put that towards the end of this for the beginning okay that's all just God keeps track of everything amen verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward remember those Pharisees they wanted the reward of praise Amen everything that they they did they wanted recognition and praise and you know Jesus said hey if that's what you want that you got your reward but what you do for God you got to do it in secret in other words you here's how you do something for a secret it isn't that you're not in front of somebody doing it because people have to behold your good works but when you're doing it in front of others there is no thought about somebody seeing what you're doing that's how you do it in secret it's between you and God praise the Lord let's stand together God knows your situation he's able to make it work out for your good he's able to make all grace abound to you such love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons and daughters of the Living God let's take that love that God has loved us with and let's love him back with that same love let's not just love him with our love our human love let's let God's love dwell on is so richly so full that we love him back the same way if you want that love that love to love him back that same way to give of yourself to the Brethren like he gave himself for you just keep seeking that love you shall seek me and find me when you search for his heart spend time with the Lord spend time in prayer let it just be real between you and him that love will just grow growing in the love of God and before you know it you'll see your value and when you realize your value you'll let God just you you want God to use you just spread the love of God to someone that don't know him yet I don't honestly I don't know any greater honor there is no greater honor than to present Jesus Christ to someone who doesn't know the author of eternal life amen amen let's sing people need the Lord people need below he believed happy end of broken dream is the open door people need people me [Music] yummy show us four people need the low people me Oh at the end is the you people need people need when me Amen Lord lay some soul my heart no you can't save everybody but I believe God can use us to deal with the heart or two at the same time amen just ask him Lord lay some saw in my heart get my mind off of all this junk that's going on in the world let me focus on your purpose Lord Lord some soon my heart and love mad soul through me and may I ever do my part in that soul for me or lay some soon upon my heart and love Nets over me that's so worthy what you do your part a man of God does his lordly some slow upon my heart and love let soul through me Natsumi Amen bow your heart with me in a word of Prayer Amen with her eyes closed our heads now before the Lord just a real humble heart before the Lord this morning God is taking time out to visit us this morning and to express he is the almighty that knows everything about our situations all the things we've been going through he's also the keeper of our souls we're also protected no matter what we're going through and when our love reaches to the place that it's actually called according to his purpose we began to set our love upon the saving of souls helping people to come to know Christ in a greater measure tell you no no tribulation no persecution no problems in this life not even death itself would be able to separate us from God his love is so strong it held Jesus to that very purpose in the garden when he walked really when he carried his cross when he gave his very life for the purpose of the Father and the in the scheme of the big picture it was just a bruise on his heel not tell you in this scheme of life what does it matter all this stuff that we've been going through the problems the things that we've been dealing with the situation's I'm not talking about the the effect of the pandemic and how its killed people talking about what Satan's wanting to do with that situation cloud up our mind and cause us to get so confused God's purpose is still an eternal purpose it's just as important today as the day we got saved it'll be just as important is it and when the last one comes in people need the Lord God is looking for someone who stayed there long enough that God could lay a burden on their heart a burden for someone someone who's willing to go out preach it on the housetop whatever God puts in your ear that you'll share it with others whatever he is commanded you to teach it to all nations you're of more value than many sparrows and God has some other souls that are out there were ten thousand girls let God use you for his eternal purpose you may take comfort that all things will work together for the good in your life God's gonna see us through let's step out in faith and just take care of the things that God has called us to take care of and you'll take care of us we take care of what God's told us to do he'll take care of us Lord Jesus I'll pray for every
