[34:57] um
[34:58] as brother Ron had made mention a little
[35:01] filling station that we can come and
[35:03] just receive a little something from God
[35:05] that will help us and our journey
[35:08] amen we were talking a couple Services
[35:12] ago about the coming of the Lord and we
[35:15] needed to make ourselves ready bride has
[35:19] a promise in the Bible that she will
[35:21] make herself ready
[35:23] and she takes the word and applies it to
[35:27] her life and gets dressed in the the
[35:31] garments of the word if I could say it
[35:33] like that but it doesn't come easy she's
[35:37] going to have to cry out to God she's
[35:40] going to have to seek God because she's
[35:42] got two Powers well a power working
[35:45] against her she got the power of the
[35:47] enemy and the power of this old nature
[35:50] that's not wanting to cry out that's not
[35:53] wanting to reach forth and uh she's got
[35:56] to press through that until God comes
[36:01] um we want to talk about the bride's
[36:03] humility
[36:04] today and I believe we need that in
[36:09] order to be accepted by the groom amen
[36:12] amen so let's um we can turn to two
[36:16] scripture readings one's going to be in
[36:18] the Book of Revelations chapter 3
[36:22] and then one is going to be in first
[36:25] Peter chapter 5.
[36:28] amen God bless our visitor in the back
[36:32] and and
[36:34] um
[36:34] we pray that God will bless you amen
[36:39] amen let's look to the Lord in in a word
[36:43] of prayer before we begin to read his
[36:46] word Heavenly Father
[36:48] we come to you
[36:50] as humbly as we know how today knowing
[36:55] that Lord our dependency is upon you to
[36:58] come into
[36:59] this part of the service as
[37:03] the word is being ministered as your
[37:05] Bible is being read
[37:07] Lord we need the quickening of your Holy
[37:12] Spirit to unveil yourself to us Lord we
[37:17] pray that we could all be in the
[37:19] position to receive the very message
[37:21] that you have for us Lord we ask that
[37:24] you would if our hearts are not prepared
[37:27] that you would prepare our hearts Lord
[37:29] we want to receive what you have for us
[37:33] and I pray Lord that you would forgive
[37:36] us of our sins our trespasses our doubts
[37:40] our carnality
[37:41] our murmuring our complaining our our
[37:45] anything that has been
[37:48] displeasing to you we just pray that you
[37:51] would cover us now with your blood
[37:53] and Lord
[37:55] allow us to be in that position to
[37:58] receive from you the things that we have
[38:01] need of Father we commit the service
[38:04] with all of our needs into your hand and
[38:07] we wait further in San B we ask it all
[38:10] now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[38:14] Revelations chapter 3 starting with
[38:16] verse 15.
[38:18] I Know Thy works
[38:20] that thou art neither cold nor hot I
[38:23] would that thou were cold or hot so when
[38:27] so then because Thou Art lukewarm
[38:31] neither cold nor hot look at how many
[38:33] times he makes mention of that
[38:36] he really hates lukewarmness I will spew
[38:39] thee out of my mouth
[38:41] because thou sayest I am rich and
[38:43] increased with goods and have need of
[38:46] nothing and knoweth not that thou art
[38:48] wretched and miserable poor blind and
[38:50] naked
[38:51] says I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[38:54] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[38:57] rich
[38:58] and white Remnant that thou mayest be
[39:04] clothed
[39:06] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[39:09] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[39:13] eyes half that thou mayest see as many
[39:16] as I love I rebuke
[39:19] and chasten so
[39:21] what do we need to do be zalius
[39:25] therefore and repent
[39:28] amen and then in the book of First Peter
[39:32] chapter 5.

[39:54] likewise you younger submit yourselves
[39:57] unto the Elder yea all of you be subject
[40:03] one to another
[40:06] and be clothed with humility
[40:10] for God resisted the proud and he giveth
[40:13] grace to the humble
[40:15] humble yourself therefore under the
[40:18] mighty hand of God that he may exalt You
[40:21] In Due Time cast all your cares upon Him
[40:24] for he careth for you amen God bless you
[40:28] may be seated
[40:30] the bride's humility

[40:35] clothes are the outside garments that we
[40:38] wear for the purpose to hide the shame
[40:42] of our bodies
[40:47] just as we see
[40:49] one another's natural clothes we all
[40:52] have spiritual clothing that we wear
[40:57] and according to the scriptures there is
[41:00] a proper clothing that covers the shame
[41:03] of our carnal nature
[41:07] right and this is what we're reading
[41:09] about in the Bible Jesus wanted us
[41:13] not to have the shame of our nakedness
[41:16] to appear before him
[41:19] he wanted us to come to him
[41:22] for the clothing amen
[41:24] amen and and and and and
[41:29] to be properly dressed for his coming
[41:31] because unless we're dressed for his
[41:33] coming we're not going to go away with
[41:36] the bride amen
[41:38] now we are required to be dressed in
[41:42] these clothes for his return and now
[41:45] depending on what Spirit we have upon us
[41:47] at the moment is what
[41:50] clothing we're wearing
[41:53] and remember this that our spiritual
[41:56] clothes are seen by everybody
[42:00] some are more
[42:02] uh
[42:04] some are more uh in tune
[42:08] and some are a little more oblivious but
[42:11] Jesus said Beware of false prophets
[42:13] which come to you in sheep's clothing
[42:14] but inwardly they're raving wolves
[42:19] and Jesus is really speaking to us about
[42:22] the inner man amen amen he's wanting the
[42:25] inner man to to to to repent not just
[42:28] put some clothes on the outside and say
[42:31] I'm a Christian or just act a certain
[42:33] way a certain time and feel it but he's
[42:36] looking for the inside right
[42:39] now
[42:41] the Bible tells us that we're going to
[42:43] be like Jesus when he returns we're
[42:45] predestinated to that
[42:48] so we're going to be in the image of God
[42:51] the thing is that there is a difference
[42:54] today A distinct difference between us
[42:57] and God
[43:00] there's a difference between the groom
[43:02] and the bride
[43:03] The Head and the body
[43:06] God in the church
[43:08] the Bible tells us about these
[43:10] differences even though they're to be
[43:12] the same the bride is to be subject to
[43:16] the groom
[43:18] the body follows the head the word of
[43:21] God is preached and the church obeys it
[43:24] so you see that there is a a positional
[43:27] difference between the bride and the
[43:30] groom even though they are the same
[43:33] Ephesians verse 5 verse 23 tells us for
[43:37] the husband is the head of the wife even
[43:39] as Christ is the head of the church and
[43:42] he is the savior of the body therefore
[43:43] as the church is subject unto Christ so
[43:46] let the wise be subject unto their own
[43:49] husbands and everything yet they are one
[43:54] right a husband and wife are one Christ
[43:57] and the church is one yet there is a
[44:00] distinct difference
[44:03] we're in the same image but we play
[44:06] different roles
[44:10] Jesus said you have not chosen me bride
[44:12] I have chosen you
[44:15] amen we love him today because he first
[44:18] loved us
[44:20] he is the Potter we are the clay he is
[44:23] the creator we are his the creation
[44:27] and because of this he requires us to
[44:30] dress with proper clothes
[44:34] these clothes are required to be worn at
[44:37] all times
[44:38] we never want to come to church without
[44:41] having these clothes on
[44:43] we never want to approach god without
[44:46] these clothes we really don't ever want
[44:49] to be without these clothes
[44:52] now we're invited to approach God
[44:55] there's many scriptures in the Bible
[44:57] Jesus said come on to me all ye that
[45:00] labor and a heavy laid and I will give
[45:01] you rest he's inviting us to come to him
[45:05] he said ask and it shall be given seek
[45:07] and you shall find not and it shall be
[45:09] open unto you
[45:11] and turn with me if you would or watch
[45:13] on the screen here Hebrews chapter four
[45:15] I want to read just the three verses
[45:17] there Hebrews 4 verses 14 through 16.
[45:22] we are invited to come to God
[45:27] seeing then that we have a great high
[45:29] priest that has passed into the heavens
[45:31] Jesus the son of God let us hold fast
[45:34] our profession
[45:36] so we have someone there that is
[45:40] in our behalf amen
[45:44] for we have not a high priest which
[45:46] cannot be touched with the feelings of
[45:49] our infirmities but was at all points
[45:52] tempted just like we are yet he was
[45:55] without sin amen
[45:57] Amen Let Us therefore come boldly unto
[46:01] the throne of grace that we may obtain
[46:04] mercy and find Grace to help in a time
[46:07] of need
[46:09] the bid is to come boldly before the
[46:13] throne of grace but what does it mean to
[46:16] come boldly what does that really mean
[46:19] does it mean I have a right to come
[46:22] before the throne
[46:24] I know you're awful quiet it shouldn't
[46:26] be a quiet night
[46:28] I want to take a look at a couple
[46:30] Believers in Luke Chapter 18. that
[46:33] actually came before the throne
[46:36] last service we read a parable
[46:40] and it was the first part of 18 that
[46:42] meant ought to always pray and not faint
[46:46] but to be diligent to be desperate and
[46:50] when you pray make sure
[46:54] that you're not trusting in yourself
[47:00] you're not trusting
[47:04] that you're just a little bit better
[47:06] than somebody else or that somebody else
[47:08] is a little bit worse than you you don't
[47:10] want that type of thinking when you
[47:12] approach God
[47:14] now let's pick that up right after that
[47:15] Parable see this really connects Luke 18
[47:19] verse 9 and he spake this Parable unto
[47:21] certain which trusted in themselves that
[47:25] they were righteous
[47:27] and that they despised other Soul let me
[47:29] just say it like this nobody's going to
[47:30] say Hey you know I'm righteous you know
[47:33] we know we've kind of been trained and
[47:35] we're not like that but we can have that
[47:37] tendency of thinking we've not just
[47:39] requirement
[47:41] and therefore I'm I'm something special
[47:44] right now
[47:45] and especially when we look at somebody
[47:47] else who's not doing good
[47:50] and then kind of look and all of a
[47:52] sudden we feel comfortable because
[47:53] they're not doing good
[47:56] and it's it's again trusting in yourself
[47:59] we don't want to approach god with those
[48:02] thoughts
[48:05] the two men two men went up to into the
[48:08] temple to pray the one a Pharisee and
[48:11] the other a Publican so they're both
[48:14] approaching you know the Throne of of of
[48:17] Grace right now and a Pharisee was
[48:20] someone who thought they were more
[48:22] special than certain other people let's
[48:24] just say it like that they they talked
[48:26] about uh how how good they were they
[48:29] they acted like that they tried to
[48:30] profess it out there but but their their
[48:33] spiritual clothes were really really if
[48:36] I could say it like this easy to
[48:37] identify a Pharisee
[48:42] and verse 11 the Pharisees stood and he
[48:45] prayed thus with
[48:47] himself so he's quiet prayed with
[48:51] himself God I thank you that I am not
[48:55] like
[48:57] other men
[49:00] extortioners unjust adulterers or even
[49:03] as this publican
[49:06] were you ever thankful that you weren't
[49:08] like somebody else
[49:11] come on
[49:14] that's what this Pharisee did
[49:16] have you ever been in the prayer room
[49:21] looking down your spiritual nose at
[49:23] somebody in the
[49:25] kind of thinking well they got a real
[49:27] need
[49:29] let's just be honest
[49:36] you think about the bad they've done or
[49:40] or you can say I've never done what
[49:43] they've done
[49:44] and that's how this Pharisee was he was
[49:48] truly thankful that he wasn't like that
[49:50] person
[49:52] but that is what he was approaching god
[49:55] with
[49:58] and it was the wrong clothing
[50:02] he said I fast twice a week look what
[50:04] I'm bringing I fast twice to eat I give
[50:06] tithes of all my possessions of all that
[50:09] I possess
[50:13] now the Republican
[50:14] he's standing afar off
[50:17] now look how he's dressed he would not
[50:20] lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven
[50:23] but he smote his breath saying God be
[50:28] merciful to me a sinner
[50:34] fulfilling be zealous therefore and
[50:37] repent
[50:40] I tell you Jesus said this man went down
[50:43] to his house Justified
[50:46] just as if he'd never done it
[50:49] rather than the other
[50:54] for everyone that exalts himself shall
[50:56] be obasan and he that humbles shall
[50:58] shall be exalted so I ask you what does
[51:00] it mean to come boldly before the throne
[51:03] of grace because it looked like this
[51:04] Pharisee was really coming boldly before
[51:06] the throne of grace
[51:09] but he wasn't coming boldly he was
[51:11] coming arrogantly
[51:16] this Publican is who came to the throne
[51:19] of grace
[51:20] boldly
[51:24] amen and the proof was it is that he
[51:27] received justification where the other
[51:29] man did not
[51:31] now that Pharisee he went home and he
[51:33] probably thought he was justified
[51:36] he thought he probably thought God just
[51:39] answered his prayer and everything was
[51:41] right
[51:42] but I'll tell you it was an arrogant
[51:44] Spirit God resists the proud
[51:46] right and he gives Grace unto the humble
[51:51] our approach
[51:54] should always be humbly
[52:01] we need to forget about
[52:06] comparing ourselves with others
[52:10] you know a lot of times when we're
[52:11] praying the devil likes to just bring
[52:15] people into our minds when we're praying
[52:18] and when the devil does it he's he's
[52:22] trying to lure you into thinking
[52:25] something negative about somebody
[52:28] because you will automatically not be
[52:31] justified in the sight of God if you
[52:32] take that hook that bait
[52:35] but now if you're in prayer and godly
[52:37] somebody on your heart
[52:40] God wants you to pray for them
[52:43] to intercede imagine this Pharisee just
[52:47] going in there and saying God what a
[52:49] great blessing it is to be able to
[52:51] approach your throne of grace and I just
[52:53] pray that you would lift us up in your
[52:56] presence and help this man who's here
[52:58] right beside me God if there's just
[53:00] something I could do to help him
[53:04] how that would have been coming to the
[53:06] throne and approaching God the right way
[53:11] and this is so important because we
[53:13] spend time in prayer thinking that if
[53:16] we're praying it's good enough it's not
[53:19] good enough it is the effectual fervent
[53:21] prayer of a righteous man that availth
[53:23] much and we need to watch what we're
[53:26] wearing when we're approaching God and
[53:28] not only when we're approaching God but
[53:30] when we come into his house and we're
[53:32] sitting in the Holy place and we're
[53:34] expecting God to come and meet with us
[53:36] we've got to be dressed properly
[53:40] we've got to have the clothes of
[53:42] humility on
[53:46] the only way we could ever come
[53:49] before the Lord boli and receive mercy
[53:52] and Grace is by meeting all the
[53:54] requirements
[53:56] that he's asked us to meet in our
[53:58] approach
[54:01] there in other words there's a right way
[54:03] to approach God in a wrong way we think
[54:05] as long as we're approaching them it's
[54:06] okay it's not
[54:10] there's a wrong outfit
[54:12] there's a right outfit
[54:15] there's an outfit that covers you and
[54:18] then there's an outfit that Jesus looks
[54:20] at can see right through that that pride
[54:23] and see the nakedness of of our attitude
[54:29] they're invisible spiritual garments
[54:32] Jesus
[54:34] Peter said be clothed with humility
[54:38] for God resists the proud
[54:42] and give it grace to the humble of
[54:44] course when we come into God In Prayer
[54:45] we're looking for help
[54:49] the woman the widow woman that was
[54:51] praying when we pray what there's things
[54:53] that we want of God there's things we're
[54:55] praying for
[54:57] if it's for ourself it's for others
[54:59] we're still wanting God to give us help
[55:04] and the thing is if we if we don't come
[55:07] with enough humility
[55:12] Every Man's right in his own eyes so I'm
[55:13] humble enough
[55:14] right so there's the battle that we're
[55:17] that we face and we we must make sure
[55:21] that we are just nothing
[55:24] in our own eyes
[55:29] I tell you Jesus said this man went down
[55:32] to his house Justified rather than the
[55:36] other he obtained Mercy he found
[55:38] justification for his life
[55:41] while the self-righteous believer never
[55:44] even knew he was still in his sin when
[55:47] he got out of there
[55:49] he thought he met the requirements but
[55:51] this is what Pride does it blinds a man
[55:54] from seeing what's really happening
[55:56] that's what Pride does
[56:00] no wonder the prophet said
[56:02] we should always
[56:05] we should always have an attitude that I
[56:08] could be wrong
[56:09] because it's in that that you open the
[56:12] door for God to show you
[56:20] brother Branham says whatever you do lay
[56:22] everything else aside until you get
[56:25] perfect love
[56:26] it's
[56:27] it is what the bride will have when he
[56:31] comes back to get her
[56:33] because that's the only thing that's
[56:35] going to enter in and I I don't care
[56:38] yes we got to lay our pride away we're
[56:41] going to lay everything aside until we
[56:43] get it
[56:46] Pride
[56:48] is such an awful spirit amen
[56:53] the scripture teaches us that God
[56:55] resists
[56:57] the proud he even hates a proud look
[57:01] I'll just say it like this he doesn't
[57:03] feel comfortable around you ever been
[57:04] with somebody and you just don't feel
[57:05] comfortable
[57:07] you know you just sense a spirit there
[57:10] well God doesn't feel comfortable around
[57:13] a spirit of pride
[57:17] if your spiritual outfit has any pride
[57:19] in it we can't expect God to do very
[57:23] much for us
[57:25] he'll resist that and so look we might
[57:27] as well get down to the real
[57:29] real requirement that God needs before
[57:33] we go to him in prayer
[57:35] sometimes we get all of our prayers just
[57:37] right but our spirit ain't right
[57:40] and we're not clothed right
[57:43] God may visit anyone occasionally
[57:45] because the the goodness of God the
[57:48] spirit of God
[57:49] falls on the just in the unjust
[57:52] and he would pour out his Spirit upon
[57:54] All Flesh but his dwelling is only with
[57:57] the humble
[58:00] he only dwells with the humble
[58:03] that's where he chooses
[58:06] to dwell with and we've got to choose to
[58:08] keep that garment on all the time
[58:11] we can't just you know have it on
[58:13] sometimes and then when we leave church
[58:15] it doesn't matter
[58:17] right
[58:18] or does it matter how we're acting in in
[58:22] our homes and then we just you know try
[58:24] to go in prayer and no God wants us
[58:29] dressed in humility it's a real thing
[58:32] and that's where he draws I'm going to
[58:34] say that's why it's so important turn
[58:35] with me to Isaiah 57 verse 15.
[58:41] Isaiah 57 verse 15 says 4.
[58:45] four for I want to wait till you get
[58:49] there before I read it
[58:53] I'm in training you know that right I'm
[58:55] in concentrating
[58:58] praise the Lord how many loves the
[59:01] scriptures where would we be without the
[59:03] scriptures
[59:05] the Bible says for thus saith thee high
[59:09] and lofty one
[59:11] that inhabiteth
[59:13] eternity
[59:15] whose name is Holy I dwell in the high
[59:18] and holy place and I'm sorry with him
[59:23] also that is of a contrite
[59:27] and humble spirit
[59:31] and my purpose is to revive the spirit
[59:33] of the humble and to revive the heart of
[59:37] the contrite ones so we see here
[59:42] he dwells in the high and holy place the
[59:47] lofty place but he also dwells with the
[59:51] humble spirit
[59:54] and this is a
[59:59] brother Branham taught us if our spirit
[1:00:02] gets wrong the Holy Ghost just takes its
[1:00:05] flight and it waits for us to get things
[1:00:08] right
[1:00:10] I can't expect God just to be with me
[1:00:13] all the time
[1:00:16] I got to make sure that my spirit
[1:00:18] matches his word
[1:00:20] that my attitude is blazing to him
[1:00:25] so the purpose is to dwell which means
[1:00:28] to continue or remain think about it
[1:00:32] that's why we got to stay humble because
[1:00:34] we wanted to continue remain rest lodge
[1:00:38] reside a permanent stay or inhabit
[1:00:41] that's what God wants to do for the
[1:00:44] believer and that's what the promise is
[1:00:46] of the holy ghost in a man's life it
[1:00:49] will keep him humble
[1:00:53] this is the greatest thing about this
[1:00:55] message
[1:00:56] many great things about this message but
[1:00:59] brother Branham
[1:01:00] he showed us the reality of God in a
[1:01:04] human being's life
[1:01:07] there's hundreds and thousands of
[1:01:10] churches out there claiming God claiming
[1:01:14] they have the truth they all profess it
[1:01:17] right they all profess it but how many
[1:01:21] are dressed in humility
[1:01:26] that's hard to come by
[1:01:29] that's a Dying Breed
[1:01:32] because Satan is getting as many people
[1:01:35] he can on his bandwagon
[1:01:38] true God feels comfortable around a
[1:01:41] humble spirit
[1:01:43] so what is a humble spirit is someone
[1:01:45] who denies himself
[1:01:48] someone who knows they're a sinner right
[1:01:53] God be merciful to me a sinner
[1:01:57] who needs forgiveness
[1:02:00] someone who breaks themselves down until
[1:02:03] there is nothing left of themselves
[1:02:08] someone who really really feels unworthy
[1:02:11] to even approach God
[1:02:14] someone who doesn't feel worthy to even
[1:02:17] live so much as their eyes to heaven
[1:02:22] someone who makes themselves completely
[1:02:24] available for God to take over
[1:02:29] that's where God dwells
[1:02:33] God feels very comfortable around that
[1:02:35] Spirit why don't we feel comfortable
[1:02:37] around certain Spirits because we feel
[1:02:39] they're going to take advantage of us
[1:02:42] all right I mean you go buy a car and a
[1:02:45] Salesman comes out and he's trying to
[1:02:46] sell you every car
[1:02:49] he's not even interested in what you
[1:02:51] want
[1:02:52] he's trying to tell you what you want
[1:02:57] you don't feel comfortable around that
[1:03:00] manipulative spirit
[1:03:02] and to me pride is a manipulative Spirit
[1:03:06] it will try to put fear upon you if you
[1:03:09] don't do exactly what it says
[1:03:15] no wonder Lucifer got kicked out of
[1:03:17] heaven
[1:03:20] he would continue to pollute heaven and
[1:03:23] God won't have it
[1:03:26] if you're going to delight yourself in
[1:03:28] the Lord make sure you're clothed with
[1:03:30] humility
[1:03:32] don't try to do something for God and
[1:03:34] pride God isn't looking for our
[1:03:36] performance or our entertainment or
[1:03:38] whatever we could bring before miss
[1:03:40] something good the sacrifices of God are
[1:03:43] a broken Spirit a broken and contrite
[1:03:46] heart oh God thou will not despise
[1:03:52] those are the things that God wants to
[1:03:55] see in her life
[1:03:56] and I'll tell you it is a sacrifice to
[1:03:59] break yourself down
[1:04:02] to humble yourself in the sight of the
[1:04:05] lord it's a sacrifice
[1:04:08] but unless that happens he really can't
[1:04:10] restore
[1:04:12] he's got to break us down before he can
[1:04:14] restore us
[1:04:16] he loves to Quicken us he loves to get
[1:04:18] us back on the right track and if we're
[1:04:21] just zealous about repenting if we just
[1:04:24] really get excited about it and said all
[1:04:26] this oh I don't want to do it or I
[1:04:28] shouldn't have to do it or I already did
[1:04:29] it and you know it becomes some distant
[1:04:32] thing
[1:04:33] or it's some repetitious thing that we
[1:04:37] do just because we know we've sinned but
[1:04:40] God really wants to see us look at
[1:04:43] ourselves as we are nothing without the
[1:04:47] grace of God in our life
[1:04:53] what brought this justification to this
[1:04:56] man was the Garment of humility
[1:05:01] maybe he didn't pay all his ties
[1:05:04] maybe he didn't even fast
[1:05:07] but he sure looked at himself the right
[1:05:09] way
[1:05:11] and he wasn't comparing with himself
[1:05:13] with somebody that was worse than him
[1:05:16] someone that had a real problem in the
[1:05:18] church
[1:05:20] no he compared himself what God required
[1:05:24] and when you look into his Holiness you
[1:05:26] see how rotten you really are
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:32] this sinner wore the proper garment in
[1:05:35] his approach to God's Throne think about
[1:05:37] it
[1:05:40] that's why it doesn't matter what you've
[1:05:41] done
[1:05:43] it
[1:05:43] doesn't matter how you're sitting here
[1:05:46] today if your attitude is humble God
[1:05:50] will receive you
[1:05:54] now whether
[1:05:56] you're Republican or Prophet God
[1:05:59] requires the garments of humility
[1:06:02] amen it doesn't matter which one you are
[1:06:04] when Isaiah experienced heaven and he
[1:06:06] saw the Lord high and lifted up in his
[1:06:08] train filled the temple and the the
[1:06:10] cherubins with all the angels and the
[1:06:12] serpents covering their eyes because
[1:06:14] they were unworthy to look upon the Lord
[1:06:16] and cover in their feet because they
[1:06:19] were unworthy to be in the presence of
[1:06:21] the Lord and they were crying holy holy
[1:06:23] holy is the Lord God of holds the whole
[1:06:25] earth is full of his glory now when he
[1:06:28] experienced that
[1:06:30] the power of God was so strong
[1:06:33] the post of the doors of Heaven shook
[1:06:36] there was smoke
[1:06:38] and here was a prophet of God that said
[1:06:42] the same thing as a Publican whoa
[1:06:45] is me
[1:06:48] I am a man of unclean lips who am I to
[1:06:52] speak the word of God to anybody
[1:06:57] that approach
[1:07:00] is what got him Justified
[1:07:04] not you know well I I guess I'm I've
[1:07:06] been caught up into this trance and this
[1:07:09] experience in heaven because you know
[1:07:11] I'm kind of special now and God gave me
[1:07:13] this I'm going to come down and just you
[1:07:15] know help all the people now because I'm
[1:07:17] better no that wasn't his attitude he
[1:07:19] didn't deserve to be up there he wasn't
[1:07:21] worthy to be up there amen
[1:07:24] and he wanted God to have mercy on him
[1:07:26] woe is me for I am undone
[1:07:29] because I am a man of uncleanness I
[1:07:32] dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:07:34] uncleanness for my eyes have seen the
[1:07:37] king the lord of the hosts
[1:07:40] God requires the garments of humility if
[1:07:44] you really are going to be in God's
[1:07:45] presence
[1:07:47] and we all want to get in God's presence
[1:07:50] but we put little attention to this
[1:07:52] necessary apparel
[1:07:57] verse 6 then Flew Over the seraphines
[1:08:01] unto me praise God having a live coal in
[1:08:05] his hand which he had taken off the tall
[1:08:07] uh off the tongs of the altar
[1:08:12] from off the Altar and he laid it upon
[1:08:14] my mouth and said Lo
[1:08:17] this have touched thy lips thy iniquity
[1:08:21] praise God is taken away and thy sin is
[1:08:27] the and thy sin purged
[1:08:35] imagine Isaiah in heaven
[1:08:38] thinking about him being a prophet you
[1:08:41] know
[1:08:42] above others saying Lord I Thank you I
[1:08:46] am not like others
[1:08:49] I read I pray
[1:08:51] I prophesy
[1:08:53] you know his iniquity would have
[1:08:55] remained
[1:08:56] his sin wouldn't have been purged
[1:08:59] and so our attitude is what really
[1:09:03] counts when we're approaching God
[1:09:07] we cannot forget how needy we really are
[1:09:10] and I'll tell you like this the more
[1:09:12] that you can practice being truly
[1:09:15] genuinely humble with one another the
[1:09:18] easier it is to get the results from God
[1:09:23] because you can't
[1:09:26] where the garments be clothed with the
[1:09:28] ability one unto another the Bible says
[1:09:32] and that takes a lot
[1:09:34] it takes a lot to really esteem the
[1:09:36] other better than yourself
[1:09:38] to really say something good about
[1:09:40] somebody who you know there's something
[1:09:42] wrong with
[1:09:45] but you want God on your side that's
[1:09:47] what God is because I'm going to tell
[1:09:49] you every one of us
[1:09:52] are not worthy of the least of God's
[1:09:54] blessings
[1:09:56] we're not worthy to be saved we're not
[1:09:58] worthy to be blessed we're not worthy
[1:09:59] for depression to leave us we're not
[1:10:02] worthy of our bodies to be healed we're
[1:10:03] not worthy of anything of God
[1:10:06] but it's it's so easy in our lives that
[1:10:09] we can just get drawn away by some
[1:10:12] spirit that makes us feel like we're
[1:10:14] something when we compare ourselves to
[1:10:16] somebody else
[1:10:18] and God is a million miles from that
[1:10:27] verse 8 and look at this what happened
[1:10:29] after he was justif after he was cleaned
[1:10:32] and I heard the voice of the Lord saying
[1:10:34] whom shall I send and who will go for us
[1:10:37] then said I
[1:10:40] here am I send me
[1:10:46] what did God really do to the prophet
[1:10:49] when he came before him
[1:10:52] He restored him
[1:10:55] He restored him back to order
[1:10:57] amen amen something happened that
[1:11:00] disconnected him he got out of the vine
[1:11:03] something happened to where sin came in
[1:11:05] and I'll be honest with you we Brothers
[1:11:08] we backslide 100 times a day
[1:11:12] I don't know it seems like evil is
[1:11:14] getting worse and worse I wonder if
[1:11:15] we're doing it more and more
[1:11:18] but after he cleanses us and washes us
[1:11:22] he puts us in service
[1:11:26] he sanctifies you for the service of the
[1:11:28] Lord
[1:11:30] to where you could really be a help
[1:11:32] helping somebody you know one of the
[1:11:34] most wicked Spirits is not caring about
[1:11:37] somebody
[1:11:39] I got my own problems right now
[1:11:42] well we all got our own problems
[1:11:45] but the spirit of God in you will have
[1:11:47] faith that he'll take care of your
[1:11:48] problems when you now start helping
[1:11:52] others right
[1:11:55] right do you believe that
[1:11:57] I believe that with all my heart
[1:12:05] I don't care who we are
[1:12:07] when we're in the presence of the Lord
[1:12:09] we're not going to condemn somebody
[1:12:12] now think about the times you've got
[1:12:14] down on your knees to pray and you're
[1:12:16] thinking evil about somebody you're
[1:12:19] thinking ill of your neighbor you're
[1:12:21] thinking something wrong about the
[1:12:23] church
[1:12:24] come on
[1:12:26] of course
[1:12:28] to think about negative things in the
[1:12:30] church why is that because we have more
[1:12:33] people in the church
[1:12:37] right the more people the more problems
[1:12:41] the more chance that we're going to get
[1:12:43] hurt stepped on offended bothered
[1:12:47] right if you just come to church and
[1:12:50] it's only you
[1:12:52] right you're probably not going to feel
[1:12:55] that much about it
[1:12:57] you're probably going to get down in
[1:12:58] your knees you're going to say Lord why
[1:13:00] isn't there anybody else in the church
[1:13:04] but just remember when that little
[1:13:07] thought starts coming I don't care how
[1:13:09] true it is
[1:13:14] God has called us to be intercessors not
[1:13:16] accusers of the brethren
[1:13:19] you'll never never get anything from God
[1:13:23] with that type of spirit
[1:13:26] and that's because God's light is
[1:13:28] stronger
[1:13:29] than us and when Isaiah got into the
[1:13:32] presence of that light it was no longer
[1:13:35] about Lord these people they don't
[1:13:36] listen to me but I've been prophesying
[1:13:38] I've been I've been telling them like it
[1:13:40] is and they just won't listen to me he
[1:13:41] didn't say that
[1:13:43] he was so focused on his wrong
[1:13:46] I'm telling you this is the right
[1:13:47] garment to be wearing don't let anything
[1:13:50] keep you from wearing this garment
[1:13:55] the Bible says who can lay anything to
[1:13:57] the charge of God's elect
[1:14:01] he that is with without sin Let Him cast
[1:14:04] the first stone Jesus said
[1:14:07] the bride
[1:14:09] is always dressed in humility because
[1:14:13] God is humble and this is what God
[1:14:17] requires of his bride Jesus said learn
[1:14:20] to me for I meek and lowly he dwells
[1:14:23] with the humble
[1:14:25] and Vengeance belongs to God the Bible
[1:14:27] never said hey vengeance is the brides
[1:14:29] take care of it
[1:14:31] he said vengeance is mine
[1:14:34] God is the one that justify if God is
[1:14:36] the one that
[1:14:39] takes care of the business that needs to
[1:14:42] be taken care of
[1:14:44] it's our job to serve amen all right
[1:14:49] now during the time of Esther
[1:14:51] this is a a Esther is a beautiful type
[1:14:54] here now of the Bride
[1:14:57] Esther only wore the Garment that was
[1:15:00] provided by her by the king's
[1:15:02] Chamberlain
[1:15:03] all the other women that were going to
[1:15:06] be trying to be a queen trying to be
[1:15:10] chosen they all added their own ideas
[1:15:13] to and it says here in Esther 215 now
[1:15:16] when Esther's turn came to come before
[1:15:19] the king she required nothing but what
[1:15:26] he Gaia the Kings Chamberlain The Keeper
[1:15:30] of the women appointed and Esther
[1:15:32] obtained favor in the sight of all them
[1:15:34] that looked upon her
[1:15:38] now don't you know the same devil that
[1:15:41] tells you nobody listens to you nobody
[1:15:44] cares about you is the same spirit that
[1:15:47] tells somebody else the same thing
[1:15:51] we're all dealing with that we're all
[1:15:54] wanting to get the attention of God
[1:15:56] we're all wanting to get the attention
[1:15:58] of our King
[1:16:01] but what we need to realize is that we
[1:16:04] just need to do what God says just take
[1:16:07] what he says we don't need to add our
[1:16:10] stuff
[1:16:12] just approach god with humility
[1:16:16] now both vashti and Esther approached
[1:16:20] the throne
[1:16:21] as well and it looked like vashti
[1:16:24] approached the throne with boldness
[1:16:28] while Esther approached the throne which
[1:16:31] seemed to be a little timid
[1:16:36] didn't seem very bold I just
[1:16:41] and see how things look from the outside
[1:16:45] that
[1:16:47] humbleness
[1:16:51] can really be if you're not screwed in
[1:16:55] if you really don't know can look timid
[1:16:58] but I'll tell you what
[1:17:02] Esther was not bashful
[1:17:06] she was not timid in the aspect of
[1:17:11] um
[1:17:14] I I don't know if I should be doing this
[1:17:16] no she knew she should be doing this but
[1:17:19] she knew she had to do it the right way
[1:17:22] where vashti had that arrogant I don't
[1:17:25] say it's confidence I say that arrogant
[1:17:28] stupidity thinking because she was the
[1:17:32] elective of God that she could just do
[1:17:37] what she wanted to do
[1:17:40] she didn't have to reverence the
[1:17:42] sanctuary
[1:17:44] she didn't have to reverence the Throne
[1:17:46] of God she didn't have to reverence the
[1:17:48] king when the king called for her to
[1:17:50] come unless I would like you to come no
[1:17:54] right stubborn I don't need to go to
[1:17:56] church I don't need to pay the time I
[1:17:59] don't need to listen
[1:18:01] I don't need to work with them
[1:18:06] and you expect God to bless you
[1:18:12] we've got to put the garments on
[1:18:15] the Garment of humility
[1:18:17] do you believe that
[1:18:20] the Bible says that the king love Esther
[1:18:22] above all other women and she was made
[1:18:26] King she was made and she made I'm sorry
[1:18:31] she was made
[1:18:33] the Queen instead of vashti right
[1:18:36] Esther could approach the throne with
[1:18:40] boldness because she knew what was
[1:18:43] required
[1:18:44] and she met the requirements and when
[1:18:47] you meet God's requirements that's when
[1:18:49] you could come boldly Before the Throne
[1:18:51] of God you've done all you know to do
[1:18:55] it's only when you mix your outfit with
[1:19:00] a little bit of self
[1:19:06] I believe Esther
[1:19:11] she listened to what the king's
[1:19:13] Chamberlain said for her to do
[1:19:17] and I believe when we come into church
[1:19:18] we read the Bible we listen to the tapes
[1:19:21] we need to be listening to what's being
[1:19:23] spoken to the bride
[1:19:26] because in that brother Branham taught
[1:19:29] us
[1:19:30] and the word teaches us that the
[1:19:33] faithful Ministry is for the perfecting
[1:19:35] of the saints that we have a prophet in
[1:19:38] the rapturing faith lies in those types
[1:19:40] and we have a fightful mystery they take
[1:19:43] their place
[1:19:44] Esther had character
[1:19:47] we learn in type how the bride of Christ
[1:19:49] will have character and just think about
[1:19:52] these few things she respected God and
[1:19:56] honored his house because when she
[1:19:58] walked in to the Palace
[1:20:01] she did just go up there and interrupt
[1:20:03] and say hey I gotta talk to you
[1:20:06] she went into the inner court and she
[1:20:09] stood there and she waited on the king
[1:20:13] she waited in prayer until
[1:20:17] he held out the scepter
[1:20:19] right
[1:20:20] and sometimes we just got to spend more
[1:20:22] time in prayer than just coming into
[1:20:24] church popular and say God I need your
[1:20:26] help
[1:20:28] God I need something from you tonight I
[1:20:30] need well come and just wait on him they
[1:20:33] that wait upon the Lord they shall renew
[1:20:36] their strength
[1:20:38] they that are are are faithful and
[1:20:41] diligent to to do what God has required
[1:20:46] I believe
[1:20:47] that the bride will always keep the
[1:20:49] garments of humility on
[1:20:52] and she will approach god with
[1:20:54] confidence because she's been taught
[1:20:57] that her husband is going to take care
[1:20:59] of her
[1:21:02] she knows
[1:21:04] that's why we can come boldly Before the
[1:21:06] Throne of God
[1:21:07] but we must keep in mind that God does
[1:21:10] not humble himself to us
[1:21:15] well God you don't understand you know I
[1:21:18] you gotta no you no you don't
[1:21:24] we've got to learn to trust him
[1:21:26] we got to learn to come before him and
[1:21:29] remain in that place of God I submit my
[1:21:33] life to you I'm nothing without you I
[1:21:36] can't I'll tell you sometimes we may
[1:21:38] think we can't get out of a wet paper
[1:21:40] bag
[1:21:42] because of the mental gain that's going
[1:21:44] on in her head
[1:21:47] but it don't matter
[1:21:48] because our strength is from above
[1:21:51] our strength comes from God
[1:21:53] and if we could put keep those garments
[1:21:56] of humility on then God Can Lift us up
[1:22:01] in due season but we've got to Humble
[1:22:03] ourselves under the mighty hand of God
[1:22:05] keep ourselves humble now that isn't
[1:22:08] just you know well I'm going to spend
[1:22:09] some time in prayer I'm going to be real
[1:22:11] humble and try to be humble at church
[1:22:13] and then I'm just going to leave and
[1:22:14] kind of go do no
[1:22:16] we've got to exercise humility
[1:22:19] all the time amen we got to exercise
[1:22:21] humility in our thoughts they speak
[1:22:23] louder in heaven than our words do here
[1:22:25] on Earth humility is a garment it's an
[1:22:28] invisible garment and it's worn all the
[1:22:30] time and I'll tell you every one of you
[1:22:31] that are wearing clothes today you
[1:22:33] consciously knew what clothes you were
[1:22:35] putting on you were not blindfolded you
[1:22:37] were not asleep and somebody put the
[1:22:39] clothes on you knew what you were doing
[1:22:41] when you put them on and when you put on
[1:22:43] humility you know what you got to do to
[1:22:45] get there
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:47] you have to humble yourself before the
[1:22:50] Lord
[1:22:52] and your humility is going
[1:22:55] to be tested
[1:22:58] when somebody comes up to you and tries
[1:23:00] to get you
[1:23:03] humility
[1:23:05] if you got the right clothes on
[1:23:07] you won't be moved
[1:23:10] but if somebody bumps you the wrong way
[1:23:13] all of a sudden you've got a reason to
[1:23:15] think evil then
[1:23:18] you need to get
[1:23:20] your clothes
[1:23:21] of humility on all the time amen Esther
[1:23:26] 5 1 says Esther 5 1 she put her royal
[1:23:31] apparel
[1:23:34] she she put her royal apparel and stood
[1:23:38] in the inner Court of the King's house
[1:23:39] now
[1:23:40] Royal apparel my definition
[1:23:44] for us is humility
[1:23:48] the bride puts on humility that is fit
[1:23:51] for the king
[1:23:53] yes and she stood in the inner Court of
[1:23:55] the King's house against the Kings over
[1:23:58] against the King's house and the King
[1:24:00] sat upon his Royal throne in the Royal
[1:24:02] house over against the Gate of the house
[1:24:05] now
[1:24:06] you go in the prayer rooms or you come
[1:24:08] in the church and you pray
[1:24:10] what are you doing you're in the Kings
[1:24:13] house
[1:24:15] and you're waiting on him
[1:24:18] and I think if there's one thing that
[1:24:20] we're missing in our church
[1:24:23] is we're missing spending more time
[1:24:25] waiting on God
[1:24:28] because if we don't wait on God enough
[1:24:31] we're not even positioning ourselves to
[1:24:33] for him to tell us that we got a wrong
[1:24:36] Spirit right that our pride that that
[1:24:38] sin is in the way something's wrong you
[1:24:40] know sometimes we don't want to even
[1:24:41] make things right before we come to
[1:24:43] church come on
[1:24:45] and we think yeah God will still speak
[1:24:47] to us well he may speak to you
[1:24:50] but it's no way to have a relationship
[1:24:58] now
[1:25:01] The Queen Esther
[1:25:03] and the King
[1:25:04] they were married
[1:25:06] they were one
[1:25:08] but they held different positions yeah
[1:25:11] she didn't come in there and just sit
[1:25:13] right next to him and just this is well
[1:25:16] I'll tell you we're not going to go over
[1:25:18] and push Jesus to the side and say hey
[1:25:20] I'm sitting with you on the throne
[1:25:23] no he said if you overcome I will grant
[1:25:27] to you to sit with me on my Throne like
[1:25:29] I have overcome his hat with my father
[1:25:31] on his throne he's the one that allows
[1:25:34] things to happen the way they need to
[1:25:37] happen
[1:25:38] Esther didn't give up half of her
[1:25:41] kingdom
[1:25:42] to the king it was the king that offered
[1:25:45] half of the Kingdom up to her
[1:25:48] just like Jesus offers up to us
[1:25:51] half of the Kingdom right we're join
[1:25:53] heirs with Christ
[1:25:56] praise the Lord amen
[1:25:58] now we've all pictured Esther coming
[1:26:00] into the King's house
[1:26:02] at one time or another
[1:26:04] just some quiet
[1:26:08] person
[1:26:11] dressed in her spiritual garments I'll
[1:26:13] say of humility and her approach to her
[1:26:16] husband was with great respect
[1:26:19] and I'll say like this how you treat one
[1:26:21] another
[1:26:22] is how you're really treating God
[1:26:28] what you've done to the least
[1:26:30] of these my little ones you've done it
[1:26:33] unto me
[1:26:36] so we need to put so much heart into
[1:26:40] making sure that we actually
[1:26:43] are having
[1:26:45] a garment that is acceptable to God in
[1:26:48] our life amen
[1:26:49] because I want to get out of here I do
[1:26:52] not want to be left behind amen I do not
[1:26:54] want to go through tribulation I do not
[1:26:58] want to fail because I didn't want to
[1:27:00] humble myself and I don't care think
[1:27:02] about this
[1:27:04] the rest of the group that's left behind
[1:27:07] after the Rapture they could spend all
[1:27:10] day
[1:27:12] fighting with one another how they are
[1:27:14] better than one another
[1:27:16] I'm not as bad as you
[1:27:18] you did so bad in the church you
[1:27:21] wouldn't do this you played favorites
[1:27:24] and they could go through the whole
[1:27:25] group of that
[1:27:30] and still feel justification in what
[1:27:32] they're doing because it'll probably be
[1:27:33] true
[1:27:35] but wouldn't it be better
[1:27:38] to not be doing that
[1:27:41] and get dressed with humility that you
[1:27:44] look at everybody the same you love
[1:27:46] everybody the same you help everybody
[1:27:49] the same there's no respecter person
[1:27:51] I'll tell you this Pharisee he was a
[1:27:53] great respecter of persons
[1:27:58] how many is getting something out of
[1:27:59] this
[1:28:02] now notice when Esther went in she
[1:28:05] wasn't just blabbering
[1:28:07] she didn't go into the King's house and
[1:28:10] just you know start blabbering to
[1:28:12] somebody waiting for the king to come oh
[1:28:14] I'm just waiting for the king
[1:28:16] no
[1:28:19] she was waiting in inner court for her
[1:28:21] husband to acknowledge her presence
[1:28:24] in verse 2 it says that it was so when
[1:28:27] the king saw Esther the queen standing
[1:28:29] in the court
[1:28:30] that she obtained favor
[1:28:33] in his sight I wonder when God looks
[1:28:35] upon us when we come to church
[1:28:38] are we finding favor with him or does
[1:28:42] God want us
[1:28:43] to be doing something different
[1:28:47] and the King held out to Esther the gold
[1:28:50] scepter and that was in his hand so
[1:28:53] Esther Drew near and touched the top of
[1:28:56] the scepter
[1:28:57] and then said the king onto her
[1:29:00] what will thou Queen Esther what is thy
[1:29:05] request and it shall be given thee to
[1:29:07] half of the Kingdom now imagine God
[1:29:11] saying that to any one of us
[1:29:14] at that point
[1:29:17] it's all over our need is met
[1:29:21] right
[1:29:23] we all have needs we're coming to church
[1:29:25] we want God to move
[1:29:28] and it's I'm telling you it's an
[1:29:30] individual basis
[1:29:33] you I
[1:29:35] I don't know how many times
[1:29:38] um
[1:29:39] we've sat in church
[1:29:42] and we have felt so blessed and then
[1:29:45] there's sometimes we sat in church we
[1:29:46] think well I just didn't get nothing out
[1:29:48] of that
[1:29:50] it's an individual affair
[1:29:58] and God is looking to us to do our part
[1:30:01] first to Humble ourselves more not to
[1:30:05] feel that I'm humble enough
[1:30:07] If my people with my people not somebody
[1:30:11] else but they're already my people will
[1:30:14] humble themselves
[1:30:19] call upon my name seek my face
[1:30:25] leave themselves make themselves empty
[1:30:29] available nothing I'm a sinner I need
[1:30:32] you God then I will hear from heaven
[1:30:35] then I will heal their land then I will
[1:30:37] forgive then I will meet their need
[1:30:41] well brother John have done that well
[1:30:42] I'm telling you God is not not a liar
[1:30:48] I've already humbled myself
[1:30:51] well maybe he wants to see it continue
[1:30:53] in your life
[1:30:56] maybe maybe this is not a a place where
[1:30:59] we just come and get a McDonald's and
[1:31:01] run
[1:31:03] you know God is looking for us to be
[1:31:05] dressed and to stay dressed we it would
[1:31:08] be odd if you've seen somebody come to
[1:31:10] work and they're dressed one day the
[1:31:12] next day they're running around naked
[1:31:15] well God when he looks at us he wants to
[1:31:18] see
[1:31:19] a spiritual humility
[1:31:23] amen doesn't want to see pride
[1:31:25] because he sees right through that in
[1:31:27] his nakedness in front of him
[1:31:31] amen Lord help us
[1:31:34] now we're all on this pilgrimage
[1:31:39] trying to make a rapture
[1:31:42] and life takes a toil on us
[1:31:45] it's easy to get out of position
[1:31:48] it's so easy to get caught up in the
[1:31:49] cares of life
[1:31:52] things of the world to creep in
[1:31:55] to allow
[1:31:57] pressures
[1:31:59] all sorts of pressures come
[1:32:03] and just zap the time that we would have
[1:32:05] to where we should be doing the will of
[1:32:08] the Lord and we find ourselves spending
[1:32:11] less and less time in prayer
[1:32:14] get distracted by what's important
[1:32:17] start to entertain lukewarm Spirits like
[1:32:19] things don't matter
[1:32:21] these are just avenues that Saint will
[1:32:23] use to get us out of our position
[1:32:28] now Financial pressures will tempt us to
[1:32:31] hold back some of our ties and our
[1:32:33] offerings
[1:32:35] is that a true statement it certainly
[1:32:38] will
[1:32:39] and I'm not saying to everybody
[1:32:42] work pressures will tempt us to miss
[1:32:44] church
[1:32:45] now I'm not saying that about everybody
[1:32:49] busyness will tempt us to shorten our
[1:32:52] prayer time amen
[1:32:54] I'm not saying everybody does that but
[1:32:56] it will it will tempt us to shorten our
[1:32:59] Bible reading to listen to tapes too
[1:33:01] much entertainment will pull us away
[1:33:03] from getting serious with God
[1:33:08] family pressures will tempt us to miss
[1:33:10] out on helping the church
[1:33:13] excessive burdens for ourselves will
[1:33:15] attempt us to not have burdens for
[1:33:17] others
[1:33:19] and these things can lead us away from
[1:33:22] our humble position in Christ to where
[1:33:24] we just put on our own garments and
[1:33:27] we're going to do what we're going to do
[1:33:29] we're going to do it our way
[1:33:31] amen and then we miss out
[1:33:34] on getting what we're really after
[1:33:37] which we want God
[1:33:39] to consume Our Lives
[1:33:42] and to bless us with
[1:33:45] blessings Untold
[1:33:47] come in this church and answer our
[1:33:49] prayer give attention to our prayer to
[1:33:53] heal the sick
[1:33:55] to raise us up
[1:33:57] to deliver us
[1:33:59] to fill us what joy unspeakable and full
[1:34:01] of Glory right
[1:34:03] but we've got to meet the requirements
[1:34:05] and we've got to take this message that
[1:34:09] we've heard tonight
[1:34:11] and really try to apply it to your life
[1:34:15] because
[1:34:16] unless
[1:34:18] we understand the importance
[1:34:21] of coming before God and humility and
[1:34:24] really crying out before him
[1:34:27] we're going to live outside of God's
[1:34:29] presence and we're going to be miserable
[1:34:32] we won't have that joy that we need
[1:34:35] when you've got time I want you to read
[1:34:37] James chapter 4.
[1:34:41] the whole chapter but I want to read
[1:34:43] just a few verses in it before we
[1:34:45] dismiss
[1:34:47] talking about this battle that we have
[1:34:51] inside of us there's a battle going on
[1:34:54] and verse 5 says of James chapter 4 do
[1:34:57] you think that the scriptures saith in
[1:34:58] vain the script the spirit that dwelleth
[1:35:01] in is it lusteth to Envy or ill will
[1:35:05] but he giveth more grace
[1:35:07] wherefore he saith God resisteth the
[1:35:11] proud
[1:35:12] but giveth Grace unto the humble
[1:35:16] so the Garment that we want to wear
[1:35:20] is humility
[1:35:23] we gotta get rid of our pride I don't
[1:35:27] care what anybody says to you I don't
[1:35:28] care what anybody does to you I don't
[1:35:30] care what anybody thinks
[1:35:32] there's never an element for Pride to be
[1:35:36] in your life
[1:35:39] none
[1:35:40] and the more humble you are the more
[1:35:43] God's going to move in your behalf
[1:35:46] and here's how we get
[1:35:50] submit yourselves therefore to God
[1:35:53] resist the devil resist the pride
[1:35:56] and he will flee from you
[1:35:59] you ever like kind of the tensions there
[1:36:02] you know the Bible says a soft answer
[1:36:04] turns away wrath well you can easily
[1:36:07] just kind of fight back with what's
[1:36:08] coming at you
[1:36:10] and you've got to resist that spirit
[1:36:12] amen you submit to God you res you you
[1:36:15] take the back seat you humble yourself
[1:36:18] you say not my will Lord thy will be
[1:36:20] done
[1:36:25] God resist the problem giveth Grace unto
[1:36:27] the humble submit yourselves therefore
[1:36:28] to God resist the devil will feed from
[1:36:30] you draw an eye to God and He will draw
[1:36:31] an eye to you cleanse your hand ye
[1:36:33] Sinners and purify your heart she
[1:36:35] double-minded be afflicted and more and
[1:36:37] weep and let your laughter be turned the
[1:36:39] morning your joy to having is humble
[1:36:41] yourselves in the sight of the Lord and
[1:36:43] He Shall lift you up now I'm not saying
[1:36:46] we should come in the church and look
[1:36:48] like we all look right now foreign
[1:36:52] s that's not what I'm talking about
[1:36:57] just no Pride
[1:36:59] just knowing that you're nothing without
[1:37:02] the blood of Jesus Christ and when
[1:37:04] you're talking to somebody they need to
[1:37:06] see that
[1:37:07] that's when you know you're dressed
[1:37:09] they need to see that humility
[1:37:14] it isn't something that's just before
[1:37:16] God
[1:37:17] you're written Epistles red of all men
[1:37:21] and we're to submit ourselves one to
[1:37:24] another let's Stand Together God bless
[1:37:26] you
[1:37:47] I guess I would rather always be feeling
[1:37:52] I'm lacking
[1:37:55] like the publican
[1:37:57] than to feel
