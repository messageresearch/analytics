[2:27] 17. And it came to pass,
[2:31] now this is this is the showdown, the
[2:33] Mark Carmel showdown, that it was it was
[2:37] God's person against
[2:41] um well,
[2:44] God's one person against the devil's
[2:47] people. That's that's what the showdown
[2:50] was. And the devil's people were
[2:52] religious, by the way.
[2:55] Verse 17. And it came to pass when Ahab
[2:58] saw Elijah that Ahab said unto him, "Art
[3:03] thou he that's troubling Israel? Are you
[3:08] are you the one that's troubling the
[3:09] church? Are you the one that troubling
[3:11] the home?"
[3:13] And he answered, I have not troubled
[3:17] Israel,
[3:19] but thou in thy father's house, in that
[3:22] ye have forsaken the commandments of the
[3:26] Lord, and has followed Balum.
[3:32] That's who troubles. That's who will
[3:34] trouble a church. That's what will
[3:36] trouble a home is someone that has
[3:38] forsaken the commandments of God and
[3:40] followed after something different than
[3:42] God Almighty. Now therefore send and
[3:46] gather to me all Israel unto Mount
[3:48] Carmel and the prophets of Baal 450
[3:55] and the prophets of the groves 400 which
[3:59] ate at Jezebel's table.
[4:03] Now I'm just going to be honest with
[4:04] you. This is the this is not just the
[4:08] gods of of of Baal, but they the gods of
[4:13] um of Ash Harat. She was the Canaanite
[4:16] goddess. So there's 850
[4:19] religious prophets against one man.
[4:24] Against one man.
[4:27] And Ahab sent unto all the children of
[4:29] Israel and gathered the the prophets
[4:31] together unto Mount Carmel. And Elijah
[4:33] said unto all the people uh came unto
[4:37] all the people and said, "How long he
[4:40] between two opinions,
[4:43] if
[4:44] the Lord be God, follow him.
[4:48] But if Balam then but if Balam then
[4:52] follow him and the people answered him
[4:56] not a word." God bless You may be
[5:00] seated.
[5:02] We'd like to entitle this message I
[5:04] don't know yet.
[5:07] I don't know yet. And for a subject, the
[5:09] danger of riding the fence.
[5:15] Now,
[5:18] this sounds strange because these 850
[5:22] prophets did not come
[5:24] to Elijah and say, "Well, we're not
[5:28] quite sure what to do.
[5:32] We're not quite sure what we believe."
[5:37] because they were 450 of them were
[5:39] standing for uh Balum and um or um
[5:47] of Baal and the others were following a
[5:52] Canaanite goddess Ashara
[5:54] and they served. But yet the prophet
[5:58] Elijah, he called it out and discern it
[6:01] and said, "How long are you going to
[6:02] you're going to halt between two
[6:04] opinions?" Because why was there two
[6:06] opinions? Because God had already showed
[6:09] himself the truth.
[6:14] Everybody has seen the truth at one time
[6:16] or another.
[6:18] Maybe not all the Bible, but enough to
[6:21] know that you have a choice to make.
[6:27] And a lot of times
[6:30] we can get caught between two opinions
[6:33] of what to do in life.
[6:37] and we don't know what to do
[6:40] or we think we don't know what to do.
[6:45] There is a difference between not
[6:46] knowing the will of God and not knowing
[6:49] whether or not you want to do the will
[6:51] of God.
[6:53] So, a lot of times people want to say,
[6:55] "Well, I'm not sure what to do." But if
[6:58] the word's already said what to do, it's
[7:01] not a question about what what you
[7:04] should do. It's a question of whe
[7:05] whether you are going to follow the word
[7:06] or you're going to do what you want to
[7:08] do and make an excuse. I I haven't heard
[7:09] from God yet. God hasn't told me, you
[7:12] know, personally, you know, that I that
[7:15] I need to pay my tithe, that I that I
[7:18] need to to go to church, that I that I I
[7:21] I should, you know, listen to the
[7:23] message or I should pray every day or I
[7:25] should read the Bible every day. You
[7:26] know, God has not really spoke to me
[7:28] personally that, you know, I need to be
[7:30] part of a body.
[7:33] So, uh, I don't know what to do yet. So,
[7:35] I'm I'm just deciding I'm not going to
[7:37] go to church and I'm just I'm just
[7:39] pulling out an example. I'm just, you
[7:41] know, I'm not going to pay my tithe. Um,
[7:42] I I I just because I'm not quite sure,
[7:45] you know, really,
[7:48] you know, where we're where if I have to
[7:50] pay ties really because it's between me
[7:52] and God.
[7:54] It It's not a matter of
[7:58] that being the truth. It's a matter
[7:59] whether you want to come under
[8:00] subjection to the word or not.
[8:06] How long will you halt between two
[8:07] opinions?
[8:11] A lot of times people will ignore the
[8:14] word of God, which is the actual the
[8:16] will of God. So you don't need to pray.
[8:21] I've had so many people tell me they
[8:22] were going to do something, leave the
[8:24] church, go here, move there, but never
[8:27] come to me and ask for prayer and
[8:29] counsel.
[8:33] People
[8:38] want to do what they want to do.
[8:42] But when you come to them and you talk
[8:44] to them about why you're doing what
[8:46] you're doing what you should be doing,
[8:48] they say, "Well, I don't I don't know
[8:50] yet. I you know, God hasn't told me.
[8:55] So, I don't I don't know if I you know,
[8:56] that's your opinion.
[9:04] To say I don't know what the Lord wants
[9:06] me to do yet often times means I don't
[9:09] know whether I want to do the will of
[9:10] the Lord or not.
[9:12] There's a difference
[9:14] and that that will get us in trouble.
[9:20] But we know
[9:23] that God knows our very intents. The
[9:26] Bible says Hebrews 4:12, "For the word
[9:29] of God is quick and powerful and sharper
[9:31] than any two-edged sword, piercing even
[9:33] to the dividing of sunder of the soul
[9:35] and spirit and of the joints and the
[9:37] marrow, and is a discerner of the
[9:39] thoughts and of the intents of the
[9:42] heart."
[9:44] So God knows our motive.
[9:47] I mean, how many times have we thought
[9:51] things about somebody
[9:54] and we're glad that they don't know what
[9:56] we're thinking?
[10:00] Like we hide behind a smile or, you
[10:03] know, shake in the hand, but you know,
[10:05] God knows every thought.
[10:07] He knows the hairs. How many hairs we
[10:09] got on our head?
[10:13] Maybe with you, they're multiplying
[10:15] daily. with me. They're subtracting. You
[10:19] get to that age and they start going the
[10:20] other way.
[10:24] But God knows how sincere we are.
[10:28] God knows whether we're halting between
[10:31] two opinions,
[10:33] saying, "I'm not sure what I want to do
[10:35] yet."
[10:37] Or if he sees that we're just going to
[10:39] stay with his word.
[10:42] Brother Brandon, I want to read this
[10:44] quote. It's in questions and answers.
[10:48] 64.
[10:49] The question was asked to brother
[10:51] Brandham the third poll and his speaking
[10:54] of the word.
[10:56] It seems entirely possible for you to
[10:59] speak the word and one would be
[11:01] completely and fully restored
[11:03] placed entirely ready for the rapture
[11:05] and the resurrection the son of man.
[11:08] This is so or is it not?
[11:11] And you would be you would do this if
[11:13] properly pressed upon you, would you
[11:15] not? And escape all the things and stand
[11:18] before the son of man. So we all
[11:20] understand that the third pole is part
[11:22] of speaking into existence. Is that
[11:24] true? Can you say amen to that? Okay. So
[11:27] that's that's what he's getting here
[11:29] that you got the power of speaking the
[11:31] word.
[11:33] Brother says, "Now my dear friends, see
[11:35] now I think here that you got a good
[11:38] statement." Yes sir. Yes sir. Now, that
[11:40] would be so
[11:42] um in other words, here's what I I don't
[11:47] think it's a I I believe now he says,
[11:51] not to polish up what you said, but I
[11:53] believe I can make it a little bit
[11:54] clearer to the people. See, you're
[11:56] believing because the spoken words and
[11:58] the things like that, he said, and all
[12:00] of you here are witness of the squirrels
[12:03] and all the other things that's been
[12:05] done. But did you notice that was
[12:08] sovereignly given?
[12:12] I never asked him, "Lord, let me do
[12:14] this, speak these things in that, do
[12:18] these things there." I never asked him
[12:20] that. It was by his own divine will that
[12:24] he came to me and said, "You do this."
[12:26] And I wasn't asking one thing about it.
[12:29] Moses never asked to go down to Egypt,
[12:31] but God had sent him down there to
[12:34] Egypt.
[12:35] So now he's he's bringing a point across
[12:39] here. It's not us doing what we want to
[12:43] do with the word,
[12:46] but it's about getting in tune with God
[12:49] and letting God speak to you, speak
[12:51] through you to actually accomplish his
[12:54] will. He says, 'Now, I believe that the
[12:57] Holy Spirit would come to me and say in
[12:59] a vision, go tell a certain person that
[13:02] they are not to that they're trying to
[13:04] overcome a certain thing and they can't
[13:06] do it and they're smoking and they're
[13:08] drinking, they're lying, they're
[13:09] stealing, they're committing adultery,
[13:10] whatever it might be or they go got a
[13:12] lustful spirit and you just go where
[13:14] they are. Thou spirit come out of there.
[13:17] I set I set this captive free. Would it
[13:20] take place? Absolutely.
[13:23] Yes.
[13:25] Indeed that absolutely would take place.
[13:28] But now upon my own presuming
[13:32] now the word presume means to a venture
[13:36] without authority.
[13:38] See I go down to there to help the this
[13:41] person and I'm just presuming that it's
[13:44] all going to be right. Then I don't know
[13:48] and I can call on the name of the Lord
[13:50] over them and I can pray for them. I can
[13:52] do whatever I wish to,
[13:55] but it doesn't mean it's going to
[13:56] happen.
[14:00] You see, when you got, you know, Brother
[14:02] Brandon calls it out in the message so
[14:03] many times. You got people that act like
[14:07] God,
[14:09] but it's really not God in them. But
[14:11] they're they're so excited. They want
[14:13] God to use them, and they're using the
[14:14] word. This is what the word says.
[14:18] And they say it's going to happen, and
[14:19] it don't happen.
[14:22] And so, uh, you know, presuming without
[14:24] authority is that you really don't know
[14:26] yet what you're doing.
[14:30] You're hoping that it's going to happen.
[14:33] But there's danger in assuming without
[14:36] authority. You need the authority of God
[14:39] telling you.
[14:41] And here's the thing, there's many
[14:43] voices out there
[14:45] &gt;&gt; and they mimic God.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; They mimic the voice of the Holy Spirit.
[14:51] and they try to puff you up. They give
[14:55] you a reason to go out there and to to
[14:58] to to
[15:00] that's why Jesus said to his disciples,
[15:03] one of the reasons was you're not going
[15:05] to go out and witness for me until I
[15:06] endure you a power from on high because
[15:08] it's got to be me inside of you doing
[15:10] the work.
[15:12] Brother man says, "If I had my own way
[15:15] this morning, I just had an interview
[15:17] with a little lady sitting in the
[15:19] wheelchair to come to this meeting
[15:21] today." They had to have the fire
[15:23] department take her out uh of her house
[15:26] in Chicago and people live across the
[15:29] street and they don't come to the
[15:31] meetings. Isn't that funny? People live
[15:34] so close they won't come to the meetings
[15:35] and brother says they'll come all the
[15:37] way from Chicago to come to the meeting.
[15:40] That's you could see where Jesus said um
[15:44] um the Queen of Sheba went you know
[15:47] halfway across
[15:49] to come to see the wisdom of Solomon and
[15:52] it said a greater than Solomon's here
[15:55] and so obviously they're going to pay a
[15:57] greater a greater uh penalty. Amen. So
[16:02] brother says what would I do if I had in
[16:05] my power it is I have all the authority
[16:08] to do it but if I h but I have to wait
[16:12] for orders to do it. I have to wait for
[16:16] God to tell me to do it. I can't do it
[16:19] out of my my but I have to wait for
[16:23] orders.
[16:25] See I have the authority from God to do
[16:28] it. But now when he gives the orders,
[16:30] she'll go back home. Well, I know this
[16:33] is the truth. I see I just be as willing
[16:38] to die this morning on th on that as I
[16:42] in anything. That's the truth. So I love
[16:44] what brother said. He is so sure about
[16:46] what he just said. He said, "I'd ra I"
[16:48] He said, "I could just die knowing that
[16:50] what I'm telling you is the truth." If
[16:52] God speaks, it's going to happen. And if
[16:54] anybody knows this to be the truth, it's
[16:56] the prophet who wouldn't do anything
[16:57] until he seen a vision. And and even
[17:00] Jesus said, "I do nothing except the
[17:02] father shows me first." So it we have to
[17:06] we have to walk so close to God that we
[17:10] know that we know that we know that is
[17:12] God moving us.
[17:16] So
[17:18] that's the way we want to a Christian
[17:21] walks. I think brother Brandham said
[17:23] like this, the bride will do nothing
[17:24] until she has thus sayeth the Lord. So
[17:27] we have to we have to be so close to God
[17:30] that we need to know for sure what his
[17:32] voice is speaking to us. Now we don't
[17:35] want to assume that what we're doing is
[17:38] okay. We don't want to assume it.
[17:41] We don't ever want to adventure without
[17:43] authority because every decision that
[17:46] you make becomes a destiny.
[17:48] It's leading you somewhere.
[17:51] And we never know where our destiny is
[17:54] going to be if we're not paying
[17:55] attention to the decision we're make.
[17:57] You know, Brother Bam said like this.
[17:59] It's real, real easy to know where
[18:00] you're going. Everybody can know where
[18:03] they're going. You don't have to wait
[18:04] till you get there.
[18:07] He says, just look at what you're being
[18:09] drawn to.
[18:10] If you're being drawn to the world,
[18:15] you're probably not going to end
[18:17] in that the way of life.
[18:21] But if you're being drawn to the the
[18:24] broad way
[18:26] and you you just it doesn't care, it
[18:29] doesn't matter to you what you do in the
[18:31] world,
[18:33] that's a good sign that you're not going
[18:35] to make it. But if you're being drawn to
[18:38] God, a hunger to know God to to to go
[18:44] back to where you came from,
[18:47] then that's a good indication that
[18:50] you're going to make it into the
[18:51] straight and narrow gate that leads to
[18:53] life. Amen.
[18:55] So, we've got to seek God until he gives
[18:58] us the answer. We just can't keep
[19:01] living. I don't know what to do yet. I
[19:02] don't know what to do yet. We need to
[19:05] get serious with God and and know God.
[19:08] You know, the the Bible says, "Stand
[19:10] still and know that I am God." God has
[19:13] got a voice.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; My sheep know my voice and they follow
[19:18] me.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; And we don't have to be part of the
[19:20] group that is always, "I don't know what
[19:22] to do. I don't know what to do." We just
[19:24] need to get desperate with God. Brother
[19:26] Brandon preached desperation that would
[19:28] lead us.
[19:31] Now when God's word is spoken
[19:35] then we should never delay
[19:38] like if the Bible just for instance
[19:42] if the Bible says that your temple is
[19:44] the temple of the Holy Ghost then we
[19:47] should never delay taking care of our
[19:50] temple.
[19:52] If the if the Bible says that that we
[19:56] rob God and and and and we rob him when
[19:59] we we don't pay our tithes and our
[20:01] offerings, then we should not delay. We
[20:03] should instantly always give God what's
[20:06] God.
[20:07] Because even God said, "Give Caesars's
[20:10] what's Caesars, give God what's God's."
[20:13] If the Bible says that a woman shouldn't
[20:15] cut her hair, we shouldn't delay on
[20:18] that. We should just not cut her hair.
[20:19] If if the Bible says that a a woman
[20:21] should not put on the clothes, the
[20:23] garments that pertainth unto a man, then
[20:25] then a woman should never wear pants,
[20:27] she should wear a goddess, a godly
[20:29] dress.
[20:31] So if the Bible says, "Forsake not the
[20:33] assembling of ourselves together and all
[20:34] the more as the day is approaching, then
[20:37] we should never delay obeying God." We
[20:40] should never halt between two decisions
[20:43] because we already know that God's
[20:45] decision. We already know what to do.
[20:49] We just come under subjection to the
[20:51] Holy Ghost.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Psalms 119 verse 59.
[20:57] Psalms 119:59 says, "I thought on my
[21:02] ways." I want everybody to think on
[21:04] their ways. I thought on my ways,
[21:08] and I turned my feet unto thy
[21:12] testimonies, unto the word. In other
[21:14] words, I made haste and I de and delayed
[21:19] not to what? To keep thy commandments.
[21:24] You know why a lot of people want
[21:26] walk around never knowing what to do is
[21:31] because they never practice
[21:34] standing on the word with everything.
[21:38] They they decided they're going to do
[21:39] the most important things to them and
[21:42] the other things don't matter. And
[21:44] before you know it, you don't have a
[21:47] solid foundation because Jesus said,
[21:49] "Man shall not live by bread alone, but
[21:52] by every word that proceedth out of the
[21:54] mouth of God."
[21:57] Joshua chapter 24 verse 15
[22:01] says, "And if it seem evil
[22:05] unto you to serve the Lord,
[22:08] choose you this day whom you will
[22:11] serve." I mean, this is Elijah
[22:15] made it real clear to all these
[22:17] religious prophets
[22:19] who were standing not for God, but we're
[22:23] standing for the gods that they wanted
[22:26] to serve.
[22:31] And he just looked at him and said, "How
[22:33] long are you going to stay in that
[22:34] condition and halt between the truth and
[22:39] what you want to be the truth?
[22:42] Because the truth will always remain the
[22:44] truth no matter what you think or feel.
[22:49] But what you think is to be the truth
[22:51] always changes. Did you ever notice
[22:53] that?
[22:54] Well, I used to believe this. I used to
[22:57] think that because we're finite.
[23:00] We can change.
[23:02] We can change our our ideas and our
[23:04] opinions and people can give us you know
[23:07] greater understanding but when it comes
[23:09] to the word of God that remains the same
[23:12] &gt;&gt; yesterday today and forever.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; So it's evil
[23:19] to to not stand with the word
[23:25] but I think one thing you know brother
[23:27] Brandham taught us is that we should
[23:30] never be wishy-washy.
[23:34] He said, 'If you're going to be a bum,
[23:36] be the best bum you can be. Now, I don't
[23:39] want to have a a a testimony of being a
[23:41] bum,
[23:43] right? It's a pretty poor testimony, but
[23:45] it goes along with what Jesus said to
[23:48] the Leodysian church, which is, "I'd
[23:50] rather have you cold than lukewarm."
[23:54] Take a stand. God has more respect for
[23:58] an outright sinner than he does a
[24:00] hypocrite.
[24:05] Don't don't don't tell me you don't know
[24:07] yet.
[24:09] There there's so much danger in writing
[24:11] the fence.
[24:13] You never ever It never turns out right.
[24:18] And the longer you wait to make your
[24:20] decision, the harder it will be to make
[24:23] the decision.
[24:27] the less strength you will have, the
[24:30] harder it'll be to get back.
[24:33] You got to make a decision. You got to
[24:35] make it quick. And you you you have to
[24:37] believe with all your heart because you
[24:39] got every demon in the world coming
[24:40] after you.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; And they don't care what your name is.
[24:44] They don't care what your desires are.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; They want to destroy your soul.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; It's time that we for ourselves take a
[24:55] stand with God. Because if God be before
[24:58] you, who can be against you? But if you
[25:00] don't stand with God, how is God going
[25:02] to stand for you? Jesus said, "If you're
[25:04] ashamed of me, I'll be ashamed of you."
[25:11] Love the word.
[25:14] We have heard that it's
[25:19] that trust isn't gifted to anybody.
[25:24] Trust has to be earned. How many's heard
[25:25] that before?
[25:27] Trust has to be earned.
[25:30] If you meet a person for the first time
[25:34] and they make a mistake,
[25:37] there's
[25:39] there's some grace there because it's
[25:41] the first mistake they've ever made.
[25:46] But you line them up to another person
[25:48] who's made that same mistake a hundred
[25:51] times.
[25:53] Tell me which person you're going to
[25:54] have more confidence in.
[25:58] Trust has to be earned.
[26:01] It has to be tested. It has to be tried.
[26:04] It has to be faithful. It always has to
[26:08] be the same. It's something that you can
[26:10] count on.
[26:13] If you can't rely or depend or trust,
[26:16] then there's no foundation to build
[26:19] upon. I mean, who is going to put their
[26:21] money in a bank and not have confidence
[26:25] when you go back there that you can pull
[26:27] it out?
[26:29] You're going to say, "You know what? I'm
[26:30] not going to do the the bank of the
[26:32] losers.
[26:34] I'm going to go to
[26:37] the Huntington
[26:40] Chase
[26:43] because I know they got a reputation
[26:45] that what I put in there, I can pull out
[26:47] a month from now.
[26:50] Trust has to be earned.
[26:54] If you want somebody to trust you, you
[26:56] got to start today building trust.
[27:00] Be faithful. Be faithful to God. Be
[27:03] faithful to the word. Be the same
[27:04] yesterday, today, and forever. Be just
[27:06] like Jesus.
[27:10] Because if you can't depend or trust,
[27:13] you can't build upon that kind of
[27:15] foundation.
[27:16] It's sinking sand. it's going to
[27:19] crumble.
[27:21] It won't stand the test in the trials.
[27:24] So when you're halting between two ways,
[27:27] two opinions, or two views,
[27:32] stay with the word. Whatever the word
[27:35] says, just do it. Forget about what you
[27:37] think.
[27:40] If we could just humble ourselves to
[27:41] realize that the devil has the ability
[27:44] to anoint our understanding,
[27:47] to anoint our emotions, to anoint our
[27:50] feelings, to make us think things that
[27:52] are not real. The Bible says that he can
[27:54] transform himself into an angel of
[27:56] light. You don't even know it.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; You should never halt between two
[28:04] opinions.
[28:08] You're opening yourself up for the enemy
[28:11] to twist you all up and get you so
[28:13] confused, not knowing what way is up,
[28:16] way, what way is down, and then when
[28:18] he's done with you, you're not going to
[28:20] even know how you got there, what to do
[28:21] to get out.
[28:24] You may not think it's important, but if
[28:28] God tells you to do something, do it.
[28:31] It may have nothing to do with whatever
[28:34] you think it needs to be do, but it is
[28:36] what God is requiring of you.
[28:39] Don't halt between two opinions. In
[28:42] other words, lean not to your own
[28:43] understanding.
[28:45] It can't be trusted. My understanding
[28:47] can't be trusted.
[28:50] My understanding is not faithful.
[28:53] My understanding I it's not reliable
[28:58] because I am a human and I have failed.
[29:02] But God's word cannot fail.
[29:07] God can never improve himself. I can
[29:10] improve my understanding. I can improve
[29:13] my knowledge. I can improve my wisdom.
[29:15] But God cannot be improved.
[29:19] There's no need for us to halt between
[29:21] two opinions.
[29:24] We just make a decision that we're going
[29:26] to stay with the word of God.
[29:29] Trust in the word. The word has never
[29:31] failed.
[29:33] Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ is the same
[29:35] yesterday and today and forever. The
[29:38] Bible says that God is faithful. Great
[29:41] is thy faithfulness.
[29:44] Heaven and earth will pass away, but my
[29:46] words will never pass away. The Bible
[29:47] says that God cannot lie. He is
[29:51] trustworthy.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; There are not very many people you can
[29:55] talk about and say he's he or she is
[29:58] trustworthy.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; All other ground is seeking sand.
[30:05] If we if we don't know what the Bible
[30:07] says, then our our desire should be to
[30:09] find out what the Bible says, not
[30:11] whether or not we want to do it or not.
[30:16] I believe it's time for us to grow as as
[30:18] as mature Christians.
[30:21] Psalms 118:8, "It is better to trust in
[30:24] the Lord than to put confidence in man."
[30:31] And that's you, by the way.
[30:35] You know, it's it's it's probably easy
[30:37] for for us to say, "I don't trust
[30:39] anybody." But, you know, you trust
[30:41] yourself.
[30:43] You trust yourself too much.
[30:46] That's putting conf when you trust
[30:47] yourself, you're putting confidence in a
[30:49] man.
[30:52] So, it's better to trust the Lord than
[30:53] to put confidence in a man. When you
[30:56] have a decision to make, never run away.
[30:59] Don't avoid making the decision. Just
[31:02] immediately trust the Lord.
[31:07] We don't always, you know, we don't
[31:10] always have the experience
[31:14] or the knowledge of the Bible what to do
[31:17] or how to handle a situation.
[31:19] But we do know what not to do.
[31:24] We do know not to trust in our own
[31:26] understanding.
[31:27] We do know not to run away. You don't
[31:31] ever see any of God's people run away.
[31:35] You know the story about Peter after
[31:37] Jesus had um uh uh died and and
[31:42] resurrected and the persecution came and
[31:45] they were going to uh crucify Peter.
[31:49] They were going to get him and they were
[31:50] going to crucify him. And what happened
[31:52] with Peter? They they were telling
[31:54] Peter, you know, run, get away because
[31:56] you if you don't get out of here. And so
[31:59] Peter left Jerusalem. And on his way out
[32:03] of Jerusalem, he met Jesus. Jesus
[32:05] appeared to him. And Jesus said, "Peter,
[32:10] where are you going?
[32:15] They're going to crucify me. Get back to
[32:18] your post of duty."
[32:20] You don't run away.
[32:22] If you notice Ephesians 6, there's
[32:25] nothing on your back to protect you
[32:28] because you always face the enemy. You
[32:31] don't turn your back. You keep your eye
[32:33] on the enemy and you fight him.
[32:38] Trust the Lord with all your heart. Turn
[32:41] with me if you would to uh Psalms 27.
[32:51] And my goal tonight is not to be long,
[32:53] but if you don't get into the word, I
[32:57] promise you I'll stay a little longer.
[33:02] Psalms 27:E2.
[33:06] Even when the devil tries to manipulate
[33:08] your life through fear, trust God.
[33:13] The devil don't know what to do with
[33:14] somebody who trusts God. He don't know
[33:17] what to do.
[33:18] That's why
[33:20] he trembles at the weakest Christian
[33:22] when he's on his knees.
[33:26] I'd rather be weak
[33:29] in seeking God than to be strong and
[33:32] think I don't need to.
[33:36] Psalms 27:2, "When the wicked, even my
[33:38] enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat
[33:41] up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
[33:48] God caused that to happen.
[33:51] Though a ho should a camp against me,
[33:57] my little heart shall not fear.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Though war should rise up against me and
[34:02] everybody come against me, in this will
[34:05] I be confident.
[34:07] The only desire that I have is that and
[34:11] that I'll seek after is that I may dwell
[34:13] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[34:16] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[34:18] and to inquire in his temple. I tell you
[34:21] that's where you get your answers is in
[34:24] church.
[34:27] I think it was David. He said there
[34:29] somewhere around Psalms 71 or 72
[34:33] something like that. He said when he
[34:35] looked at the wicked and how they
[34:37] prospered in the world that it began to
[34:41] eat at him and the Bible says that he he
[34:45] almost stumbled and fell because it
[34:49] being a stumbling block to him. He says,
[34:52] "But then I went to church
[34:55] and then at church I learned their end."
[34:59] In other words, he inquired in the house
[35:02] of God about what to do with the
[35:04] situation that he was involved with. And
[35:07] God gave the answer. Verse 5, for in the
[35:10] time of trouble he will hide me in his
[35:13] pavilion. In the secret of his
[35:16] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[35:18] set me up upon a rock.
[35:22] And now shall my head be lifted up above
[35:24] my enemies round about me. Therefore
[35:26] will I offer in his tabernacle
[35:29] sacrifices of joy and I will sing. Yeah,
[35:32] I will sing praises unto the Lord. What
[35:34] should we be doing in church today?
[35:37] Singing praises.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Saying a hallelujah to the word of God.
[35:42] Hear, O Lord,
[35:46] when I cry
[35:49] with the with my voice, and have mercy
[35:51] also upon me, and answer me.
[35:56] When you said, "Seek ye my face." I
[36:01] didn't halt between two opinions.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; My heart said unto thee, "Thy face,
[36:08] Lord, will I seek."
[36:10] A lot of times we hear the Lord calling
[36:13] out to his word and because we don't
[36:15] feel this um um real close personalness
[36:20] with the Lord or with the word, we don't
[36:22] recognize it's God speaking to us.
[36:28] It's because we're not prepared.
[36:30] We're not prepared when we get into the
[36:32] sanctuary. I remember as a young
[36:34] Christian,
[36:35] the Lord was speaking something to me,
[36:38] but I didn't recognize it.
[36:41] In fact, I was kind of avoiding.
[36:47] And when you don't really want to hear
[36:49] from the Lord, how do you expect to be
[36:51] blessed?
[36:52] How do you expect to have other needs
[36:54] met in your life that you want taken
[36:56] care of when you don't you're not even
[36:58] working hard to get in the presence of
[37:00] God?
[37:03] And I believe something that all of us
[37:04] could be doing here is seeking the face
[37:07] of God more.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; I believe it is the will of God in our
[37:10] life. And I'll tell you, we wouldn't
[37:12] have to halt between two opinions so
[37:14] much. We'd have an answer from God what
[37:17] to do because God, he's real.
[37:23] God allows tests and allows trials for
[37:27] various reasons in our life, but none of
[37:30] those reasons are without his desire for
[37:33] us to seek his face.
[37:36] We're we may what's this trial for? Why
[37:39] why this happened in my life? Why am I
[37:41] going through this? There may be various
[37:43] reasons for that. But one thing remains
[37:46] the same is that God wants us wants us
[37:49] to seek his face with all those test and
[37:51] trials.
[37:54] God wants to to be in contact with He
[37:57] wants to have fellowship with us.
[38:01] God wants us to know him more.
[38:05] I just wonder how many times God has
[38:07] said, "Seek ye my face." And our heart
[38:10] said, "I'll wait till tomorrow.
[38:15] I'll just wait till tomorrow."
[38:19] Brother Ram said we can't pray too much.
[38:25] I believe we have to fight through our
[38:28] flesh and just spend more time with the
[38:30] Lord
[38:33] in adversity,
[38:35] manipulation,
[38:37] in fear, in unstable emotions,
[38:41] in undependable understanding.
[38:44] David said, 'The Lord is my light and my
[38:48] salvation and the strength of my life.
[38:54] We're not We don't We're not going to
[38:56] have an easy life.
[38:58] We're all going to have issues and
[39:00] problems.
[39:02] David had more than all of us. I've said
[39:04] that before.
[39:06] But he didn't halt between two opinions.
[39:10] He didn't have to have an answer to the
[39:12] devil about why this has come upon him,
[39:15] this calamity.
[39:18] He just knew that God was his salvation.
[39:21] That he wasn't going to fear, but that
[39:23] he was going to trust God. He wasn't
[39:25] going to halt between two opinions and
[39:28] say, "Well, I got to wait till this
[39:29] problem gets resolved before I can start
[39:31] going back to church." Oh my goodness.
[39:36] Where's your relationship with the Lord?
[39:41] Brother Brandham said, "If there's, you
[39:43] know, I don't go to church because
[39:44] there's a hypocrite there."
[39:48] Brother says, "That only shows that that
[39:51] hypocrite's got a closer walk with God
[39:52] than you do."
[39:54] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[39:58] When David faced decisions
[40:02] that had to be made in his adversity, he
[40:05] didn't halt between two opinions.
[40:09] He said, "My heart is fixed."
[40:12] He stood still. He knew his God.
[40:17] He testified, "Whom shall I fear and
[40:19] whom shall I be afraid?"
[40:24] A number of years ago, the economy went
[40:27] through a real hard time around 2008.
[40:31] And during that time,
[40:34] uh I believe it was GM
[40:38] kind of went a little bit belly up and
[40:40] they needed help from the government
[40:43] because they were going bankrupt.
[40:46] But Ford
[40:48] didn't need it.
[40:50] They didn't need help from the
[40:52] government.
[40:53] And why was that, brother James? You
[40:55] know why? Well, I'm going to tell you
[40:57] why.
[41:01] Because when things were good before
[41:05] the downturn of the economy, when things
[41:08] were real good, you know what Ford did?
[41:10] They went to the bank and they said, "We
[41:13] would like to get credit with you."
[41:17] And they established credit with the
[41:19] bank.
[41:21] But GM didn't need any more credit than
[41:23] what they had. And then when the trials
[41:26] came, they didn't have what they needed
[41:28] to go through the trial. So, I'll just
[41:30] say this. The time to build your
[41:33] relationship with God is when things are
[41:35] going good.
[41:37] Don't wait till there's a problem.
[41:40] Build your rapport. Rebuild your
[41:42] closeness. Be faithful to God. Don't
[41:44] just every everything's good now. I take
[41:46] it easy.
[41:48] No. Build build your relationship with
[41:51] God.
[41:53] If the word is for you, who could be
[41:57] against you? Show God that you'll stand
[41:59] for him. All right. Psalms 37:4.
[42:03] I thought for sure I'd be done 15
[42:05] minutes early. It looks like I'm going
[42:06] to be 20 minutes late.
[42:11] Psalms 37:4.
[42:14] All right. Who wants a job? Who wants a
[42:16] job? One. Who else wants a job? Two?
[42:19] Three? Four? Five?
[42:23] Six?
[42:26] But the rest of you, I want to talk to
[42:27] you after service. So those that that
[42:28] want a job. All right. Right here.
[42:30] Psalms 37:4.
[42:32] Here's our job.
[42:36] Delight thyself also in the Lord. Now
[42:41] look what you get for doing your job.
[42:43] And he shall give thee the desires of
[42:45] thy heart.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; You talk about getting good benefits, a
[42:50] good pay right there. Delight thyself in
[42:54] the Lord. He'll give you the desires of
[42:56] your heart. Verse five, commit thy way
[42:58] unto the Lord. Commit your your life,
[43:01] your way, everything. Just commit it to
[43:03] God. Trust also in him, and he shall
[43:07] bring it to pass.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel, they halted
[43:14] between two decisions.
[43:16] They went into the promised land
[43:20] and they were they came out of Egypt,
[43:22] they were, you know, God is going to
[43:25] take us through. And then when they came
[43:27] into their their their trial of the
[43:30] promised land, they halted and they
[43:32] said, "Look, the land does flow with
[43:35] milk and honey and it's it's it's it's
[43:37] good land and and God's right about
[43:39] that, but I just want to let you know
[43:41] it's occupied by giants." and I don't
[43:45] think we can take it.
[43:49] So they halted between two opinions.
[43:52] God said, "Go take the land."
[43:55] But the devil said, "You can't do it.
[43:59] You can't overcome."
[44:01] And they halted there. And what happened
[44:03] when they halted there?
[44:06] They never went into the promised land.
[44:10] You ride that fence and you're not going
[44:12] to make it.
[44:16] I'm so glad for Joshua and Caleb.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; We're more than able.
[44:23] They weren't looking to their own
[44:24] ability.
[44:26] They were trusting in God. They
[44:28] committed their way to the Lord. They
[44:30] trusted in him.
[44:33] The three Hebrews,
[44:35] look, they're facing a fiery furnace.
[44:42] And they were staring death. And they
[44:44] weren't staring a ticket for driving too
[44:46] fast.
[44:48] They weren't staring at um uh I got a
[44:52] rip uh rodeo rotary cuff.
[44:58] They They weren't staring at losing
[44:59] their job.
[45:01] They were staring at death in the eye.
[45:05] You w you don't bow down and and and
[45:08] give yourself to this other really
[45:13] anything that you put before God is a
[45:15] God.
[45:16] Come on.
[45:18] And and the devil is always trying to
[45:20] get us to bow to something.
[45:24] But they were they didn't halt between
[45:26] two decisions.
[45:29] They said, made it clear, we don't know
[45:30] what's going to happen, but one thing's
[45:33] for sure. We're not bowing down.
[45:36] And they went into that furnace with
[45:39] confidence.
[45:41] What was their confidence? That God was
[45:44] with them.
[45:46] They trusted in God. a perfect example
[45:50] for us that no matter how hot our trial
[45:52] is, no matter what thing we get thrown
[45:55] into,
[45:56] &gt;&gt; that God is not gonna leave us alone.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; God will meet us there. God will take us
[46:03] through
[46:04] &gt;&gt; because we serve a faithful God.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; We don't serve a God that's halfway
[46:10] there. He wants us not to be halfway
[46:13] there. He wants us to be allin. Not half
[46:16] in, half out, but all in.
[46:20] Job, he didn't halt between two
[46:22] opinions.
[46:29] He stood there in the midst of all the
[46:32] worst possible things that could happen
[46:34] to him.
[46:37] But he stood faithful in his integrity.
[46:45] He did all that was required of him to
[46:47] do.
[46:49] He didn't say, "Well, maybe, you know,
[46:51] maybe um something is is is
[46:56] something was wrong."
[46:59] He said, "Though he slay me, I'm still
[47:01] going to trust him."
[47:04] He didn't halt between two opinions.
[47:07] What an example. When God told Satan,
[47:09] "Have you considered my servant Job?
[47:11] He's perfect. There's none like him. He
[47:13] knew what he was saying about Job.
[47:19] If you're going to halt between two
[47:20] opinions,
[47:22] that's not perfect.
[47:25] Stay with the word. Stay with the word.
[47:30] I understand that sometimes, you know,
[47:33] I'm not
[47:35] we quote jobs all the time. I don't have
[47:37] thus sayith the Lord what job I'm going
[47:39] to get. I'm just going to quote the job.
[47:40] If I get the job, I get the job. If I
[47:41] don't, I don't get the job.
[47:44] I mean, there's certain things you don't
[47:46] know until it comes to pass.
[47:50] But when the word tells you what you
[47:51] should be doing, you don't halt between
[47:54] two opinions and say, "Well, I didn't
[47:55] hear God tell me that." If the word
[47:57] saying it, just do it. That's why we got
[48:00] too many people that that backslide and
[48:03] they they they they they go from pillar
[48:05] to post and they don't even know where
[48:07] they're standing because they spent too
[48:09] much time halting between opinions.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; There's a Shutomite woman.
[48:16] She didn't
[48:18] she didn't halt between two opinions.
[48:21] Her
[48:23] boy was dead,
[48:26] but she knew what the prophet had said
[48:31] and that God is faithful to his word.
[48:35] When you can look at adversity and say,
[48:37] "All is well."
[48:40] I say there's a closeness with you and
[48:42] God.
[48:44] There's a closeness. You know, you don't
[48:46] That's what we should be seeking after
[48:48] right there. a relationship that can
[48:51] hold you in the middle of trials.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; And and and
[48:59] God has got to be able to trust you and
[49:02] I like he trusted Job.
[49:06] Now, to get there, you got to work on it
[49:08] every day.
[49:11] You you you don't just It's not a gift.
[49:13] It's not given to you. You got to work
[49:16] with God every day. You got to show them
[49:18] you're faithful in your prayers. Show
[49:20] them you're faithful
[49:22] in your reading.
[49:27] You know, Peter didn't halt between two
[49:30] two decisions when he was called. Look
[49:33] at Mark 1:16. Mark 1:1 16. Now, as he
[49:38] walked by the Sea of Galilee, Jesus, he
[49:41] saw Simon and Andrew his brother,
[49:43] casting a net into the sea, for they
[49:45] were fishers. And Jesus said unto him,
[49:47] "Come ye after me, and I will make you
[49:50] fishers of men." And straightway
[49:53] they forsook their nets and followed
[49:55] him. They didn't say, "Let's sit down
[49:58] and talk about this.
[50:03] They left their profession.
[50:05] They left their their dad,
[50:08] their their family. Abraham, he left his
[50:11] family.
[50:13] They forsook everything and straightway
[50:16] followed. They didn't halt between two
[50:18] opinions.
[50:22] Remember when I think this is
[50:26] Luke 9,
[50:29] I believe it is, but it may be 14. But
[50:32] when Jesus
[50:34] um said, you know, come and follow me.
[50:37] And there was a man that came and said,
[50:39] "Look, um, I need to go back and tell my
[50:41] father first that I'm leaving to to
[50:44] follow you."
[50:49] He he he told him, "Um
[50:54] um he said, "Well, let let the dead bury
[50:57] the dead. Come and follow me.
[51:00] Anyone that puts their hand to the plow
[51:02] and looks back is not worthy.
[51:05] We don't halt between two opinions. You
[51:07] make a decision, you're allin.
[51:11] God is looking for more all-in
[51:13] Christians. More dedicated Christians.
[51:17] We We got too many halfway in.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; More dedicated. Verse 19. And when he
[51:23] had gone a little further, he saw James,
[51:25] the son of Zebedee, and John, his
[51:27] brother, who also were in a ship mending
[51:30] their nets. And straightway he called
[51:31] them and they left their father in the
[51:35] ship
[51:36] with the hired servants and went after
[51:38] him. Can you imagine?
[51:40] We're not cleaning up today. We're not
[51:42] cleaning the fish. We're not helping you
[51:44] get the boat in. See you later.
[51:47] You talk about hearing from God. That's
[51:50] how we should be.
[51:55] There was a boy
[51:58] who dangerously
[52:00] straddled riding a fence.
[52:05] He used to sit on the fence on the top
[52:07] rail of the fence and he used to watch
[52:10] the horse in the corral
[52:13] and he was just dreaming of what it
[52:15] would be like to ride one of them
[52:16] because he had never rode a h horse
[52:18] before.
[52:20] like others who he had seen on the horse
[52:22] and you know cowboys with their hats and
[52:25] they controlled the horse and pull him
[52:26] to this side he'd go to the left, pull
[52:28] him to the left, he'd go to the left,
[52:29] pull him to the right, he'd go to the
[52:30] right and he just to have the control of
[52:33] a horse he just he just thought it would
[52:35] be so wonderful but they're, you know, a
[52:39] very powerful thing. So he's
[52:40] intimidated.
[52:42] The horse would periodically come by him
[52:44] when he was on the sitting on the fence
[52:47] watching him. And the horse, he just was
[52:50] so big and muscular that it was kind of
[52:53] intimidating that he could ride him.
[52:56] And he halted between two opinions this
[52:58] boy did. One that he could ride the
[53:01] horse and the other
[53:04] that he would get bucked off if he got
[53:06] on the horse. Anybody ever been on a
[53:08] horse and thought you you feared getting
[53:11] bucked off?
[53:13] Absolutely. Been there, done that.
[53:16] Feared and got bucked. Got them both.
[53:22] So, this is where this boy was.
[53:25] And he didn't know what to do for quite
[53:27] some time. And finally one day instead
[53:30] of choosing to ride the horse he had a
[53:34] thought that he could keep one leg on
[53:38] the second rail of the fence
[53:42] and put the
[53:45] the other leg over the horse
[53:48] and that he would just hobble down the
[53:51] fence
[53:52] with the horse while standing on the
[53:55] rail.
[53:57] And he did that and then as he got to
[54:00] the end of the fence,
[54:02] the horse started to ve off to the side
[54:05] and the boy basically just did the
[54:07] splits and fell on the ground
[54:10] because
[54:12] he halted between two opinions
[54:16] and he thought he could do both things
[54:19] because he didn't quite know what to do
[54:21] yet.
[54:24] We
[54:27] need to just stay with the word.
[54:30] Don't keep one foot in the world, one
[54:33] foot with God.
[54:35] Stay with what God told you to do. If
[54:38] God told you to get away from something,
[54:40] get away from it. Don't put one leg
[54:43] around it or one arm around it or one
[54:45] hand and don't stick it in your your
[54:46] pocket. Don't hide it. Don't be like
[54:50] Achen.
[54:52] Get rid of it.
[54:54] Just get on that horse and ride it
[54:57] without fear.
[55:00] Overcome.
[55:02] God is calling us
[55:06] to be sure of our walk with God. We
[55:10] don't want to walk. I don't know what to
[55:11] do. I don't want Get rid of that spirit.
[55:14] Don't ever say I don't know what to do.
[55:16] Don't say that.
[55:18] I'm sorry. Just say I'm in prayer.
[55:22] I'm in prayer.
[55:24] I I I I'm not saying walk around like a
[55:26] know-it-all. What I am saying is don't
[55:29] let that be your excuse because if you
[55:30] really don't know what to do, what we
[55:32] should be doing is seeking God
[55:36] &gt;&gt; and get the answer.
[55:39] That's what he that's what that's the
[55:41] whole part of seek my face. How many
[55:44] times have we heard of of fasting,
[55:48] praying, and brother Brandham going in a
[55:51] cave, spending time? We heard
[55:54] testimonies up here, Brother Johnson
[55:56] talking about going and seeking the
[55:57] Lord.
[56:02] I believe God still wants us to seek
[56:04] him. Yeah. To to to know surely where we
[56:10] stand with God, that we're a solid
[56:12] Christian. When people look at our
[56:13] lives, we're not wishy-washy.
[56:16] We're not back and forth, up and down.
[56:18] That that we're like Jesus, the same
[56:21] yesterday, today, and forever. And that
[56:23] people can count on us. Amen. Let's
[56:26] stand together.
[56:34] Amen. We're going to sing a a chorus
[56:37] without any music today or a song. And I
[56:40] just want to see if we can
[56:43] The the solid rock.
[56:48] The solid rock.
[56:58] Yes. 138. I found it.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; 138.
[57:09] Everybody knows, right?
[57:11] our music.
[57:18] So to make things difficult, this is an
[57:21] uh E flat and
[57:25] my hope is built on nothing less
[57:34] on nothing less than Jesus blood and
[57:40] righteousness.
[57:42] I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but
[57:47] holy lean on Jesus name.
[57:53] On Christ the solid
[57:56] rock I stand. All other ground is
[58:01] sinking sand. All of
