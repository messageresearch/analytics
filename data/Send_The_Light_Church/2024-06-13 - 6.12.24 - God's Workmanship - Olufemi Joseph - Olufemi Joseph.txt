Hallelujah and uh I thank the almighty God that a afford me the privilege to be here and uh precious brother John Martin for his love and Trust to also allow me on his Pulpit amen just by the recommendation of a good friend of mine brother Gideon that uh I believe you know very well and um he made uh the geography of the message in my head is from Brother bran that the geography of America in my head is from Brother Bram amen he went all over the land of America preaching the message all right from the south to the west from the I mean the South to the north from the West to the east Hallelujah and uh Sports and stuff so and but brother gon made Michigan more Alik in my mind because he always talk about Michigan the brethren in here and all that there was a time brother loo was sick I think you know brother Loco yes I don't know him I don't even know he's bearing I know that I visit him every family altar brother gide say let's pray for brother Lo let's pray he sick he's dead you know the Michigan and all that so I I'm grateful to God thatth for the rec Commendation he gave and the faith that brother John had in him to put me on the pulpit and he very warm about brother John he told me he's a wonderful brother he said brother joh Marti is a wonderful brother and I think I I got to see that that what he told me is the truth God bless you sir it's a privilege to serve God in your church and the love and trust that you have and someday we trust you come to Nigeria amen I someday we trust to come to Nigeria Hallelujah you know Nigeria is there we are God's children from that part of the world okay and some things we hear from the Western media gives very wrong impression about certain places on the earth the first time I visited Zimbabwe of course you've heard about Zimbabwe I was to vaccinate myself against colera because of what I heard in the news that you know they were trowing up and going to the bathroom trowing up going to the bathroom be getting to Zimbabwe I didn't see anything like that but I heard it in the news and it Formed my impression all right right so some things we hear about certain countries is not actually so but news media must do their job and we as Christians must believe what is necessary to be believed amen hallelujah and uh no matter how dark a place might be God will have his his children amen at that particular location on Earth amen I know we don't have time I just had like 55 minutes to speak and uh but something is coming to my mind now in the parable of the S Matthew Chapter 13 parable of the S I hope you are hearing me my accent and all that hallelujah amen okay so in the parable of the soer a man wore white and he went on to SW wheat the why men slept another one God behind him yes dressed in black and he sold test right and Jesus told us in the parable that the field is the world the field whereing the seed were sewn is the world is the Earth and he told us that the wheat are the children of the Kingdom am isn't it yes and the terrors are the children of the devil amen now if the field is the earth and the wheat the children of God now we see that the Earth is divided into continent isn't the world they have reduced the volume of the microphone I hope are she hearing me the world is divided into continent and the continents are divided into countries and the countries are divided into States and the states are divided into counties yes and the counties are divided into cities and towns and Villages and Hamlet amen isn't it yes now the seed that were sown the wheat the children of God the children of the Kingdom OM they are found on Earth in those continents in those countries in those States in those counties in those uh local councils in those cities and Villages and Hamlet am so go you understand the parable God's children are found everywhere and some of the seed fell at Tifton this Tifton what do you call the name of this city here fentin some see fell in fting and that is why you could come and you are here in this church God's children the whe they were soon Children of the Kingdom amen right some fell in Nigeria some fell in my city some fell in my Village and I happened to be one of them am so God's children are found all over the known Earth they are very few and scy but I believe that there's no there's no there's no country of of the world that does not have a Christian believer on it and is a fulfillment of the parable of the Ser God's children coming forth so God bless you appreciate you all Hallelujah let's read now from the scriptures let's read from this greetings from Brother Gideon specifically and uh from my church The name of my church is Salem Tabernacle Salem Tabernacle Sal peace Tabernacle amen greeting from my family and some other minister friends amen let's read Ephesians chapter 2 the book of Ephesians chapter 2 verse 8 and 10 before we read it we just call upon him who is the author of the word dear Jesus we want to read your word we have the capacity because of our little Elementary education to read the word but he just let her the Lord the capacity goes Way Way Beyond us to get the Revelation but father we trust in you tonight to Quicken the scripture unto us set me aside and let the spirit of God speak to your children thank you for hearing us in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen Ephesians chapter 2 verse 8 to 10 the Bible says for by grace are you saved through faith and they not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of works let any man should boast for we are his workmanship amen hallelujah thanks be to God for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them you be SE thank you Revelation 3:14 Revelation chter 3:14 thank you Revelation 3:14 these are familiar scriptures to the Believers and I'm not here to bring any new thing I'm only here to remind you of what the pastor have been teaching you all these years not anything special not anything different not anything new but from the message of the hour am Hallelujah Revelation 3:14 and unto the angel of the church Church of the leans right this things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God may the Lord bless the reading of his word in Christ Jesus name amen amen tonight just a little thought though it could take us up to an hour but now we don't have up to an hour anymore before we close because you know in America just one hour and you got to get out of the pulpit amen God bless you so tonight we just want to Fellowship around this thought God workmanship God's workmanship Hallelujah that's almighty God Amen he workmanship sometimes we we call workmanship to be the payment for the labor of a laborer but that is not what we want to talk about what I'm saying is this the carpenter that built this Pulpit this is a beautiful piece sometimes we call his payment workmanship we give him the contract please come and build this pulit the pastor give him the specification the trustees and all that then we now we we now ask him how much much will you charge what will be your pay what will you love to take in terms of money right sometimes we call that workmanship amen but we are not following that that is not the Divination We are following tonight by the grace of God what what we are talking about is God workmanship and workmanship means something that is made something that is affected something that is created amen something that is manufactured praise God now this pull pit is the workmanship of the carpenter that made it this altar is the workmanship is the work is the produce of the one that made it amen glory but these are physical materials amen but these are spiritual materials that no man could make apart from God Almighty himself so these are God's workmanship including myself that is what we want to talk about tonight am for the remaining minute that we have to talk about that so while we continue if maybe we call some quote if they could feature it on the screen we I will really appreciate that so now the art or skill of a Workman that's another definition for workmanship amen the art a r t yes the art or skill of a Workman now we I'm taking from church ages first brother ronam says the Son of God if they could search it while I'm reading it the Son of God himself said believe me for the very work sake Hallelujah he said believe me for the very work sake now he put an emphasis on his own Works while he was here on Earth the prophet say Jesus put emphasis on his own work if you can't believe me as a Son of God if you can't believe me as a prophet if you can't believe me as a pastor if you can't believe me as a preacher Hallelujah believe the works that I do because the works prove Who I Am The Works prove who sent me so if you can't believe me if you can't believe my statement if you can't believe my sentence believe my works because the works were Supernatural amen hallelujah and it takes somebody that come from God to be able to display Supernatural Works yes a canal man cannot manifest Supernatural Works a man that is Canal cannot produce Supernatural work so Jesus emphasized on his work amen while he was here on Earth praise the name of the Lord amen amen maybe for example you were doubting the carpenter the capability of the Carpenter to be able to produce a beautiful pull pit that befits the church or the desire of the pastor I guess you are hearing me right you doubt his capability you doubt his efficiency you doubt his uh skillfulness amen then on his uh trying to convince you he said look Pastor John don't worry give me let me produce there's a bench here I can't raise it up because of there's a bench here wherein our microphones are kept amen he said look give me this small work let me do it when I produce this work that will prove my efficiency to you then you'll be able to trust me to give me this big one here so Jesus was proven to them you is difficult for you to believe me believe the work amen that I do because the work prove who he was and your all prove who you are God workmanship Hallelujah so now ah I don't know I won't be able to read we just try to quote as much as I can now we so the works that he did were ordained of God and to inspire faith in him the work that Jesus I'm reading from church ages exposition of the seven Church ages the Titan Church age now the works that he did were ordained of God to inspire faith in him it was a great part of his ministry his his uh his holy spirit in the Apostle Paul said for we are his workmanship yes created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God had for ordained that we should work in them these Works were to faith in him as they will show forth that relationship to him that Paul described as created in him Hallelujah now will take this we read Revelation 3:14 the beginning of the creation of God the prophet says let me quote if I still reading reading our time will be gone I will not go far the prophet says that phrase th word that scripture does not mean as it sounds the beginning of the creation of God if it means as it sounds it will mean that Hallelujah God created Jesus and Jesus started creating other creations that's the literal meaning of that but the prophet said it doesn't mean that Hallelujah the prophet say this is a is a is is a new creation hallelujah amen and Jesus happens to be the beginning of that creation amen hallelujah it was the beginning of the creation of God he was the author or the beginner of the creation of God now Church in the Old Testament really will you hear or see anybody being addressed as Son of God in the Old Testament really I know in Genesis 6 the Bible says and the sons of God saw the daughters of men that were fair and they took unto them wives I mean women amen they took unto them wives but the prophet say supposed to have been women and not wives because a preacher must pronounce the blessings of the Bible upon your marriage before you start living with a woman you don't pick a woman from the street and start living with her she must come by a marriage ordinance amen then Heaven sanctions it yes praise the name of the Lord so in the Old Testament really will you see somebody being addressed as Son of God apart from Adam Adam was a Son of God he came fresh from the hand of almighty God right and and uh he was made in righteousness and his Works were righteous yes until the sin came in Genesis chapter 3 and broke and destroyed that Holy image then Man became mad m a r e d Man became mad man spoil Hallelujah and being that God's workmanship had been spoiled right God's workmanship had been mad God had to take him back to the workshop to work on him to fix him because a man he was made in the image of God he was made in the image of God he was made in the likeness of God Adam was God in the amateur form Adam was God's son right hallelujah amen God's potentials were in Adam in amature form amen what God could do Adam could produce the way his father spoke and he became creative was the same way Adam was speaking and he became creative yes who name all the Creations on Earth who name all the Creations on Earth praise God it was Adam that named all the creationss on Earth amen I don't know whether scientists even know the number of creationss we have on Earth there are so many yeah the Creations in the seas in abundant in the air in abundance on the earth in abundance amen and Adam was so brilliant Adam was so intelligent amen that he could give he could name all amen the Creations right yes now Church give us the opportunity to have 12 individual children give a man an opport to have 12 children by the time he he got names for the first to the fifth to the sixth to the sth he may lack name for the eight man is that poor in intelligence are you with me man is that poor because he lost it at the fall but Adam was so connected to God until he was God in a mature form he named all the Creations on Earth amen without giving the name of this to the other he was so intelligent but that image was mad he was spoiled God had to take him back to the workshop I mean yeah to fix him up now we can't read it if we read you can give us Luke chapter 3 from verse 23 Luke chapter 3 from verse 23 I just for us to see something in there now in Luke 3 from vers 23 the Bible says and Jesus who was the son of uh let's let's see it Luke 3 Luke 23 Luke chapter 3 I said amen I think uh we just take our time until it's time to leave the pulpit without adding a minute Hallelujah when you rush you just you just uh and Jesus began to be about Luke 3:23 yes and Jesus himself did what began to be about 30 years of age amen being as was supposed the son of who the son of being as was supposed because Joseph was not his father right heavenly father was his father being as supposed the son of Joseph which was what the son of heli the next verse which was the son of mat which are the son of Levi which are the son of Mel which are the son of Jana which are the son of Joseph we're supposed to take it down down down down but we won't because of our time let's go to let's go to verse 36 praise the name of the Lord amen you see that Joseph are you listening now we'll come to 36 Joseph that which was supposed go to the son of Joseph Joseph had a Father Joseph the husband of Mary had a father Yes and the father of Joseph had a father amen and the father of Joseph father had a father amen come on brother right now 36 just because of our time which was the son of Canaan he was tracing the genealogy of Jesus that was the book of the family tree of the genealogy of Jesus amen you have your genealogy I have my genealogy amen I mean which was the son of aat which was the son of Sam is becoming familiar now Shem sh sometimes Hebrew and uh Greek different pronunciation different spell but the same word which of the Son of Sam which of the son of no that's Noah which of the son of L right 37 which are the son of matus which are the son of Enoch which are the the son of Jar which are the son of malal which are the son of Canaan which are the son of 38 which are the son of Enos which are the son of thank you which are the son of which are the Son of God why is either Adam was not given an Earthly father's name Adam was the son of God Hallelujah Jesus was the son of God between Jesus and Adam the Bible could not address nobody as Son of God so God had to bring in another race God had to bring in another creation God had to bring in a super race amen hallelujah and Jesus happens to be the beginning of that race amen son of the Living God Amen and by the spirit of God in him he could beget other Sons yes that could be called or addressed as Son of God yes once you are filled with the Holy Spirit you become what Son of God yes hallelujah amen but Adam could not pass the Holy Spirit to AB or to se Noah could not pass it to shame this could not Abraham could not pass it to Isaac Isaac could not pass it to Jacob right Hallelujah they gave bir to the son of their image but Jesus G I mean God created a son in his own image so he was Adam God yes Adam God but Abraham Tera are you with me yes Sir Isaac Abraham amen Jacob Isaac praise the Lord yes John Mar me Joseph right but at the baptism of the Holy Spirit you become a Son of God Amen and Jesus happened to be the beginning of that race amen the beginning of the creation of God Amen Jesus was the first is the first born of that family yes who was a Son of God himself amen hallelujah and by virtue of his position in the house of God he could begot other Sons amen by the infilling of the holy spirit amen he be so they could be called sons of God sons of God sons of God you see in the New Testament we are addressed as sons of God amen amen hallelujah because God not becomes our father but Abraham was the father of Isaac of course the God was responsible for them God created them I hope you are with us amen now let's continue we okay and which are the Son of God Amen praise God let's move on here so Jesus is the beginning of that new race he is the beginning of the creation of god let's see that still in the seven Church ages I am the beginning of the creation of God that is who the Lord Jesus say he is but those went don't mean exactly as they sound is to us he said just taking them the way the sound has made some people in fact multitude of people get the idea that Jesus was the first creation of God making him lower than the godhead then the first creation created all the rest of the universe and whatsoever it contains but that is not right you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the Bible the words the words ah he is the beginner or author of the creation of God Amen now we know for a shorty that Jesus is God hallelujah yeah Jesus Is God and the prophets say very God he is the creator John 13 all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made am so if all things were created by Jesus then the it is wrong to say that Jesus being the beginning of the creation of God means that God created Jesus and Jesus created other creation no sir he was a Creator amen nothing was made that was not made by him that's right and for his own good pleasure so this is another race this is another creation I'll just be reading and be jumping so that I go to the conclusion because I'm looking at the time now yeah he is a Creator so now see there is no doubt that he is a Creator I'm feeling good I'm beginning to feeling good church Hallelujah no doubt that Jesus is the Creator and brother Bram says I wish they could project it brother Bram say he was the creator of a finished physical creation Jesus was a creator of a finished physical creation praise the Lord I hope you got that we had the trees we had the Lions the cheetah the birds the Eagles the vulture the you know doves mentioned them we have man Hallelujah we have the Earth we have the Seas physical creation you got that am Jesus was the creator of the finished physical creation he finished creating it and the seventh day he rested is that not the Bible six days he worked transforming the chaotic Eden into a beautiful Garden of Eden brother the Earth is a beautiful place the Earth beautiful place and in it Fallen state if it's as beautiful as it is today how much more when it was the beautiful Garden of Eden before sin ever came to this Earth but God Almighty is returning it back to what it was because there's a future home that is coming amen and it will be a paradise again amen no death no accident no sickness no nothing negative Hallelujah it will be a beautiful wonderful paradise and we are longing for that we are longing for that amen hallelujah some of our brothers are aging I mean they aging they aching in pains right the steps are getting slower and slower mhm but there's another body brother There's a Place coming and we are nature is groaning yes waiting for the adoption amen of sons of God Amen and it to happen so now Jesus I want us to get that he was the creator of the finished physical creation amen we will use that as we progress with this our little thought he created everything Colossians chapter 1 verse what he made he created everything yes nothing was created I was not created by Him and for his own good pleasure amen hallelujah amen you know we look at Jesus Jesus that body is what was begotten but the eternal spirit dwelt in that body yes amen and it cannot be born because that was God the Eternal Spirit the Loos the pillar of fire that became flesh Hallelujah I'm feeling good blessed be the name of the Lord amen so now the prophet says surely we can see what this word mean now to have any other interpretation of mean that God created God how could God be created when he himself is a Creator but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation Hallelujah Jesus called himself the beginning of the creation of God or the author of the creation of God and the prophet of God is saying this is another creation yes Revelation 3:14 is written is written in uh red letter that shows it was Jesus himself that was speaking in there and he called himself the beginning of the creation of God Amen Hallelujah or the other oh brother Hallelujah this is another creation not the not cheater not liar not your thck tree not mahogani I hope you with me not Oak right not the waters not the Seas not the rocks and the stones and all this is a spiritual creation yes is another creation and that is the church amen Hallelujah and that is God's workmanship brother amen let's continue now this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is a Creator yes and he will walk in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks amen Jesus is the champion of the seven Church ages amen he is the leader of the seven Church ages amen he is the warrior of the seven Church ages amen he's the protector of his church that's right he's the guide of his church and he makes sure he watches over his church he said my eyes is on the sparrow and I watch is over here nothing can pluck out his strength of your head right without God knowing about it amen we are privileged on Earth am to have Heavenly protection Hallelujah can I say something yes do you know we are more protected than President Biden as Christian Believers amen we are more protected amen than the very president amen hallelujah of the United States of America and who could be more protected on Earth than the president of America but we are more protected than the president of America because we are his creation we are his workmanship yes right yes sir when this man finished producing this pit he loved it he admired it did he condemn it did the carpenter condemn the work and you expect God to condemn his work God cannot condemn his work am let's move on now Hallelujah yes sir therefore If any man be in Christ is a new creation am all things are passed away and all things have become new but do you know church sometimes we don't we refuse to allow All Things become new because we refuse to detach from the past right we refuse to get detached from the past you have been forgiven but you are still carrying that guilt God does not remember but you are still remembering amen hallelujah amen and do you know sometimes we refuse to accept what God say we are right amen if a preacher is preaching your pastor is preaching sons of the Living God hallelujah you are called for eternity amen doubt could be streaming but if you change his subject you are all sinners do you know we accept it will we accept that faster than we accept to be sons of God yes you are going to hell you are not going to make it you will agree with it Hallelujah say born again you are Redeemed by his Precious Blood it become difficult to accept why it should be easier to believe God than to believe the devil right but do you know sometimes it's easy for us to believe the devil than to believe God you were saying the men's meeting there a brother was saying the devil trick us he trick us he still come through the scriptures to trick the Believers but he did not succeed in tricking Jesus Matthew chapter 4 so he will not succeed in tricking us amen hallelujah church so now All Things become new he has become the new creation of God Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created the union with Christ Jesus unto good works Hallelujah now this new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what he says it is New Creation it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by way of the flesh amen God is no more dealing by way of the flesh Hallelujah the tribe of G the tribe of Reuben the tribe of Levi the tribe of this the tribe of that the New Testament concept destroys that this is a new race amen yes sir it used to be that only a particular family could minister right right yes sir the ironic the levite under ironic priesthood but Calvary destroyed that and brought him a chees the priesthood yes and then the ministry is scattered all over the world Amen be you wife be you yellow be you black be you what brown are called to preach the gospel no my particular lineage Hallelujah now New Creation this is exactly what he says to New Creation it is not another it is another creation distin from the old one amen no longer is he dealing by world of the flesh that was how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue Through The Godly Isaac but new B now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has proposed a new creation he is the first of that creation yes Jesus is the first born of that family amen Jesus is the first Son of God of that family that's right and from him came other sons of God remember the kind of wheat that must go to the ground and die right if not it abide alone and as he die he shoot up he produce many more many many more jesuses many many more sons of God then you came up Son of God filled with the Holy Spirit I'm a Son of God tonight I believe you believe you're a Son of God tonight what gives you the faith and the confidence amen because of Christ brother Bram says do you know there's no difference between you and Jesus before God Jesus is a son as much as you are a son and brother Bram says when you go before the father in the name of the son in prayers it says the same as Jesus praying amen hallelujah so we must believe our prayers that God we answer now we why I'm see jumping by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation is by predestination now Hallelujah are didn't too glad that you belong to him amen I am glad brother that I belong to him amen amen now let's uh Forge your head Genesis chapter 1 Genesis 1 with the remaining few minutes that we have excuse me Genesis chapter one if you could feature it on the screen for us Genesis chapter 1 we will read and then we get to the end Hallelujah the Bible says amen I'm feeling good church amen thank thanks be to God now Genesis chapter 1 in the beginning God did what created the heavens and the Earth amen and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the de and the spirit of God did what moved upon the face of the wat and God said let there be light and there was what light and God saw the light that it was what Hallelujah the

engineer that mean you are good he's a good medical doctor that mean you are good amen so God said let there be light and there was light and God stood back and he saw his own work what was his remark God's remark was what good hallelujah amen now let's jump we have to jump because of our time let's go to verse 8 supposed to read the whole chapter but we came because of our time and God called the firment of the heaven and God called the firan Heaven and the evening and the morning were the second day verse n and God said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and
