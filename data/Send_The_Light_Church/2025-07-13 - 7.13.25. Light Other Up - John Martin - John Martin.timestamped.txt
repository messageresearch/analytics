[32:28] that for that uh this morning. And we
[32:32] thank you that we could come into your
[32:33] house and to worship you and just to to
[32:37] be real with you. And we ask God that
[32:40] you would look down upon each one of us.
[32:43] We all have different needs, Lord. Some
[32:46] of us are perhaps afflicted or sick.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're thankful for the testimony
[32:52] for our sister Jeanie.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, perhaps um some of us here are are
[33:00] feeling um like they just need a dose of
[33:03] the Holy Ghost this morning.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, there may be someone that just uh
[33:10] tired and they just need strength just
[33:13] to be able to enter into the word. May
[33:15] you bless them,
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Lord. Many needs represented, but you're
[33:20] a God that can meet every one of them,
[33:22] and you care about every one of them.
[33:24] And Lord, we're bowing in faith in this
[33:27] prayer, believing that you'll meet our
[33:30] needs this morning. Please bless the
[33:32] reading of your word and the ministry
[33:34] thereof. May our ears uh be prepared to
[33:39] hear our hearts prepared to receive. And
[33:43] may you help this uh unworthy vessel,
[33:46] Lord, to step out of the way that you
[33:48] may speak. Feed your bride this morning.
[33:51] We give you the praise for these things
[33:53] in advance. In the precious name of
[33:55] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. St. John chapter 8, we're going to
[34:01] read one verse there. Verse number 12.
[34:04] Then spake Jesus again unto them,
[34:06] saying, I am the light of the world,
[34:12] and he that followeth me shall not walk
[34:15] in darkness, but shall have the light of
[34:20] life.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; May God bless you. May be seated.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Um,
[34:26] we want to la last week we we or last
[34:30] service we spoke on walking into the
[34:32] light.
[34:34] And um this morning we want to speak on
[34:37] light up others.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; Light up others. And I got just a couple
[34:43] quotes I'm going to read here. Brother
[34:45] Bren says in in the message at thy word.
[34:47] He says, "A person who lives their life
[34:50] for themsself lives a selfish life."
[34:56] &gt;&gt; He says, "We must live for others. bear
[34:59] ye one another's burden and so fulfill
[35:01] the law of Christ.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; We've got to have a feeling for one
[35:06] another. Now, I think what's important
[35:07] when we're when we when we we come to
[35:09] church, we're hearing uh the word of God
[35:12] is that we really want to take inventory
[35:13] of oursel, right? Because um that's the
[35:16] only way we can be helped, right? Is
[35:20] when we look at ourselves, what our need
[35:22] is.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; I tell you, none of us want to live a
[35:25] selfish life.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We all want to live for others,
[35:30] but it is easier said than done.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother B, can I say an amen on
[35:37] that?
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to make all of you come
[35:40] up and sit in this front row together.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said in the message that
[35:44] that day on Calvary, he said, "What is
[35:46] crucified with Christ mean?" What does
[35:48] that crucified with Christ? It is to
[35:51] live for others.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; What kind of others? those who hate you,
[35:58] &gt;&gt; those who wouldn't like you, those who
[36:01] would make fun of you, live for them, be
[36:04] with them, love them, pray for those who
[36:07] despitefully use you, and say all manner
[36:11] of evil falsely for my name's sake. They
[36:14] persecuted the prophets which were
[36:17] before you. Right?
[36:18] &gt;&gt; And in the message uh that day on
[36:20] Calvary, brother Bram says, "Now the
[36:22] first thing I want to say is that Jesus
[36:24] never lived for himself.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; His life was spent for others. That's
[36:29] perfectly eternal life." Think about
[36:32] that. When you live for others, that's
[36:34] perfect eternal life.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; When you say you go to church and you do
[36:40] good things, that's fine. But when you
[36:44] live your life to yourself, you haven't
[36:48] eternal life.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Wow, that's a strong one.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Eternal life is living for others.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; It proved that when come in the lamb of
[37:00] God, he lived and had eternal life
[37:03] because he did not live for himself. He
[37:05] lived for others. And you receive
[37:07] eternal life by receiving that day.
[37:11] And you don't live for yourself no more.
[37:13] You live for others.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Calvary opened the door for us to
[37:18] receive God. Without Calvary, there is
[37:20] no way that God could have came inside
[37:22] and lived inside of us
[37:24] &gt;&gt; because of our nature. But being that he
[37:27] paid the price for our sin and we
[37:31] repented of our nature, that opened the
[37:35] door to say, "I can come in you now."
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and the nature can be changed
[37:40] and all a sudden we're not selfish
[37:41] anymore. We're not thinking about ourel
[37:43] anymore. We're we're we're we're
[37:45] thinking about helping somebody get into
[37:47] the kingdom.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the light of the world. Jesus
[37:53] said, "I am the light of the world."
[37:55] &gt;&gt; We learned that in him is no darkness at
[37:57] all.
[37:58] But if I could say this, that God is
[38:01] love,
[38:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[38:03] &gt;&gt; His love is light.
[38:08] We read in our opening verse that he
[38:11] that followeth me shall not walk in
[38:12] darkness but shall have the light of
[38:15] life.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; The light of life. So the scripture says
[38:19] he that loveth his brother
[38:22] abideth in the light.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; There's no occasion of of stumbling in
[38:28] him. There's none.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Because he's abiding in the light. And
[38:32] the light is the love of Christ.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Shed abroad in our hearts. We don't
[38:36] think about ourselves. We're living for
[38:38] others.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; But he that hateth his brother.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; He's abiding in darkness.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; So he's in darkness and he's walking in
[38:52] darkness. So hatred actually blinds you
[38:55] and you don't even you you you you don't
[38:58] even know what you're doing or what
[39:01] you're saying.
[39:03] The word is light.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; The word of God is light. I love that.
[39:08] Amen. The Bible says, "Thy word is a
[39:10] lamp unto my feet and a light unto my
[39:13] path."
[39:15] &gt;&gt; So Christ is the light. The love of God
[39:17] is the light and the word is the light.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; First John 2:5 says, "But whosoever
[39:23] keepeth his word, in him verily is the
[39:26] love of God perfected."
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:30] If you just keep the word, you know,
[39:32] when you think about love, it's okay,
[39:33] I'm associated. I got to, you know, be
[39:35] nice to somebody and it's it's how you
[39:39] But if you could just focus on living
[39:42] the entire word of God, you will
[39:44] automatically love others.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Hereby know we that we know him is when
[39:50] we keep his word. Jesus said, "If any
[39:53] man loves me, he will keep my words."
[39:56] Talking about that love relationship.
[39:58] Galatians 5:14, "For all the laws
[40:01] fulfilled in one word, even this, that
[40:03] thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[40:04] thyself."
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; So husbands are to love their wives like
[40:12] themselves
[40:15] &gt;&gt; and we as Christians are to love our
[40:17] neighbor as our as thyself.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; So we just need the love of God to do
[40:21] these things. That's right.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; For we see that the word of God and the
[40:26] love of God is exactly the same thing.
[40:28] You can't separate them.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; We can't just say, "I love God." But I
[40:33] know I don't. The word isn't that
[40:34] important to me. The Bible's No. If you
[40:36] love God, you read the Bible.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; If you love God, you read the Bible.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Because that's who God is.
[40:47] First John chapter 1
[40:51] verse one says, "In the beginning was
[40:52] the word
[40:55] and the word was with God and the word
[40:58] was God." You know, we we read um St.
[41:01] John 3:16, "For God so loved the world
[41:02] that he gave his only begotten son."
[41:06] For God so loved the world that he gave
[41:07] his word. That's who the only begotten
[41:10] son was was the word. He He so loved you
[41:13] and I that he gave the word.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:16] that whosoever believed the word
[41:18] &gt;&gt; shall not perish because the word is a
[41:20] person.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; It is God. It isn't something wrote
[41:23] about a person. This is God.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; So in the beginning was the word. The
[41:30] word was
[41:32] was with God and the word was God. The
[41:35] same was in the beginning with God. All
[41:36] things were made by him and without him
[41:38] was not anything that uh that anything
[41:42] made that was made. In him was life, and
[41:45] the life was the light of men.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; And the light shineth in darkness, which
[41:54] was
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[41:57] &gt;&gt; we're darkness, right? Before we come to
[41:59] Christ, and the light shineth in
[42:02] darkness, and the darkness comprehended
[42:05] it not. I remember when I was first
[42:06] introduced to the truth. To me, it just
[42:10] seemed so foreign. I'm sorry. I wasn't
[42:14] raised in it. I I wasn't taught it. I It
[42:17] just I just knew the Bible was it was
[42:19] was was God's book and and God um was
[42:23] was was real. The the the book was true
[42:26] and that's about all I knew. But it was
[42:29] it was a natural comprehension. It
[42:31] wasn't even by revelation.
[42:35] Amen.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; So when I was being introduced to all
[42:37] these things,
[42:39] uh uh there was
[42:42] something in me that didn't comprehend
[42:44] it
[42:46] &gt;&gt; and I I had to like pray about it and
[42:48] and and let it come in and and begin to
[42:52] to to to communicate to me. How many
[42:55] times you ever hear something from the
[42:57] word of God and say, "I don't know.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about." That's
[43:01] darkness, not comprehending it. Amen.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost says amen to every
[43:06] word of God.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; There was a man sent from God whose name
[43:10] was John. The same came for a witness to
[43:12] bear witness of the light that all men
[43:15] through him might believe. Now he was
[43:18] not that light. Either are we but was
[43:22] sent to bear witness of that light.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Understand the difference. It was the
[43:28] light that was was in him in us. But God
[43:32] is the true light. That was the true
[43:35] light which lightth every man that
[43:37] cometh into the world.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; He was in the world and the world was
[43:42] made by him and the world knew him not.
[43:45] He came to his own and his own received
[43:47] him not. But as many as received him.
[43:50] That's all we got to do is re be true
[43:52] about it.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Receive him. To them gave he power to
[43:59] become lights.
[44:00] Amen.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; To become light sons of God, even to
[44:04] them that believe on his name, which
[44:06] were not born not uh which were born not
[44:10] of blood, not of the will of the flesh,
[44:13] nor of the will of man, but of God. We
[44:18] want to keep it simple.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; We just want to submit to obeying the
[44:23] word of God. And we're we're literally
[44:26] witnessing the new birth when we do
[44:27] that.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:29] You know pe people
[44:32] in the in the fact that we become born
[44:34] again that is a mystery
[44:37] &gt;&gt; but how to become born again is
[44:39] extremely simple.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; You come to church you hear the word
[44:44] being preached and you say I want to
[44:47] live that and you walk out those doors
[44:50] and you put your heart into living that.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; You are experiencing in real time the
[44:56] new birth in your life. Amen.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; It's not some feeling that comes and
[45:03] bounces on you and makes you dance and
[45:06] and and and you feel different. I mean,
[45:08] those are blessings and we're thankful
[45:09] for them. And not that God can't do
[45:11] something during those times.
[45:14] But look, this new birth happens through
[45:16] a mutual agreement between you and God.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; And you've got to take his word, which
[45:21] you know is true, and make it true in
[45:23] your life.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:29] Verse 14, the word was made flesh and
[45:32] dwelt among us. And I believe God wants
[45:34] to make it flesh again in us. Amen. Our
[45:37] opening scripture, I am the light of the
[45:39] world, and he that followeth me shall
[45:43] not walk in darkness, but shall have the
[45:45] light of life.
[45:48] Now, we were all born in darkness,
[45:51] &gt;&gt; raised in darkness. Darkness is all
[45:54] around us today.
[45:56] It's in our governments, our schools,
[45:58] our TVs, our phones, our music,
[46:02] &gt;&gt; the people we work with, our friends,
[46:04] our family, even darkness, gross
[46:07] darkness, has covered the world that we
[46:10] live in.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; John said in 1 John 2:16, "For all that
[46:16] is in the world," this is how he's
[46:18] describing the world. Now all that is in
[46:20] the world,
[46:23] not talking about governments and TVs.
[46:27] All that is in the world is the lust of
[46:29] the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the
[46:32] pride of life.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; It's not of the father, but is of the
[46:38] world.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible is describing the world
[46:43] as the nature of an unconverted soul.
[46:54] And basically it's the unconverted soul
[46:56] who just does what he wants to do.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Lawless. Just whatever he feels, he just
[47:02] does. Nobody's going to tell me what to
[47:03] do. I'm going to do what I want to do.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; This is the world nature.
[47:09] Verse 17. And the world passeth away,
[47:11] and the lust thereof. But here it is.
[47:14] But he that doeth the will of the father
[47:16] abideth forever. So there there it is.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; All you got to do is do what the word
[47:20] says. Care about what the word says for
[47:23] your life.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; I mean don't don't don't try to leave
[47:26] the churches. I I I don't I just can't
[47:27] do this whole thing.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Don't have that mentality.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Have the mentality that God, you see my
[47:34] heart.
[47:37] I want to follow you.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; What is the first step you want me to
[47:41] take?
[47:43] I'm telling you, if you're going to walk
[47:44] here to the gas station down there to
[47:47] get a candy bar,
[47:50] you got to take your first step.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about your last one.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Take your first one.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; And then after you take your first one,
[47:58] then you take your next one. Verse 15
[48:03] says, "Love not the world, neither the
[48:06] things that are in the world. If any man
[48:09] love the world, the love of the father's
[48:12] not in him.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Now, this is pretty strong, but God
[48:15] draws a line between his will and
[48:17] Satan's will or man's will.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; There's a solid line,
[48:23] and he's not he's not going to cross it.
[48:25] God draws a line between his will and
[48:28] our will. Right.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; How many Okay, we've we've heard the
[48:37] story that, you know, many people would
[48:39] say to brother Brand or people would say
[48:40] to Brother Bren, "I love you." But he
[48:42] knew they didn't.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; How many people think How many people do
[48:46] you think tell think they love that they
[48:49] love God? They tell God they love him,
[48:50] but they don't.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; So,
[48:55] you know, God draws a line. We can't
[48:57] just you dive into our own nature and
[49:00] still hold on to God.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; God draws the line. The quicker we learn
[49:04] to draw the line, the better.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 55:8 says, "For my thoughts are
[49:10] not your thoughts, neither are your ways
[49:13] my ways, sayeth the Lord."
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; For as the heavens are higher than the
[49:17] earth, so are my ways higher than your
[49:19] ways, and my thoughts than your
[49:21] thoughts. So, I'm so glad we have the
[49:23] word of God to know the thoughts of God.
[49:26] Amen.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; These are the thoughts of God for every
[49:28] situation in every one of our lives.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Personally, no matter what's happening
[49:34] in our life, this word has an answer for
[49:37] that situation.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; That's why we know God cares and he
[49:41] understands everything.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; And if we just spend time with him,
[49:45] he'll lead us in the right direction.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[49:48] &gt;&gt; So God has drawn the line between his
[49:50] nature and the worldly nature inside of
[49:53] us.
[49:54] It's why we need to die daily.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Bingo. Right there.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; It we we if we don't die daily, that
[50:01] means the our our nature is going to get
[50:03] in the way with God. So, no matter how
[50:05] much God loves someone, he draws a
[50:08] definite line. He will not cross it.
[50:13] So, we have to be willing to say, God, I
[50:15] want to I want your word. I want all of
[50:17] your word. I care about all your word. I
[50:18] haven't been caring about your word, but
[50:19] I care now about all your word, and I'm
[50:21] going to step into that. I'm not going
[50:23] to just depend on going to church as if
[50:26] that is all I need to do. It's not all
[50:28] you need to do. You need to take the
[50:30] word, the inspiration, the message
[50:32] that's being given at church, take it
[50:34] home, and apply it in your lives.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Romans 8:5 says, "For they that are
[50:41] after the flesh,
[50:43] they do mind the things of the flesh,
[50:46] but they that are after the spirit, the
[50:48] things of the spirit. For to be carnally
[50:50] minded is death, but to be spiritually
[50:52] minded is life and peace. Show them the
[50:53] difference now. Because the carnal mind
[50:57] is is emnity against God.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; For it is not subject to the law of God,
[51:02] neither indeed can be. So then they
[51:05] flesh cannot please God. How many times
[51:07] have you ever said something, you knew
[51:09] it was wrong, but you didn't care at
[51:12] that moment that you said it.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; And you had this attitude of I just
[51:18] don't care.
[51:20] At that moment is emnity right there
[51:23] between you and God.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; God draws that line. You're in the
[51:27] flesh. You're not pleasing God. That
[51:30] mind can come at any time and trick us
[51:32] even though we're Christians.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That's why we need
[51:36] that's why we need to walk in the
[51:38] spirit, not fulfill the lust of the
[51:40] flesh and and and allow God to have his
[51:43] way in our life.
[51:46] Now, God himself is speaking to the
[51:48] devil here in Genesis 3:15.
[51:52] He's speaking to the devil and the seeds
[51:54] of his nature that would grow after him.
[51:56] So, I just want to get like a little
[51:58] background here of this this nature. And
[52:02] in Genesis 3:15,
[52:05] God says
[52:07] uh to the devil, "And I will put
[52:10] enmity," that same word again, that that
[52:13] means hostility and hatred, between thee
[52:17] and the woman, and between thy seed and
[52:21] her seed, and eventually it shall bruise
[52:24] thy head, and thou uh and it shall
[52:26] bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise
[52:29] his heel. So, we know this is a the
[52:32] prophecy of Christ bruising Satan's head
[52:36] at Calvary.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; But we see God is speaking to the devil
[52:42] himself.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Speaking to a spirit.
[52:50] And we know uh Ezekiel in 8:13 says,
[52:55] "Thou has been in the Garden of Eden."
[52:58] Revelations 12:9. and that great dragon
[53:02] was cast out, that old serpent called
[53:05] the devil.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; So, we know that uh the the the devil's
[53:09] called a serpent,
[53:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:12] &gt;&gt; And that he was in the garden. And so,
[53:15] we've got scriptures for this.
[53:17] But God was also speaking to the most
[53:20] subtle beast of the field when he said
[53:22] these words in verse 15.
[53:26] We know that because of the verse, the
[53:29] Lord God said unto the serpent, because
[53:32] thou has done this, thou art cursed
[53:34] above all cattle, above every beast of
[53:37] the field, and upon thy belly thou shalt
[53:39] go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days
[53:41] of thy life.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; So, he's speaking to both.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; He's speaking to the to the most subtle
[53:48] beast. We'll just call him a person at
[53:50] this for a second.
[53:52] He's speaking to him, but he's also
[53:54] speaking to the devil inside of him
[53:55] because they became one.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; They became one.
[54:01] And this outside person, he was
[54:03] literally turned into a snake.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; I I mean, I don't want to go preach the
[54:11] serpent seed right now, but that's what
[54:13] happened. And those of you that believe,
[54:15] we should just say amen right now so we
[54:16] can continue on here.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:20] Now we need to remember this. The two
[54:22] had become one.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; The most subtle beast and the devil had
[54:27] become one. They became united with one
[54:30] purpose. This is why it's important that
[54:33] we make sure what spirit is anointing
[54:35] us.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Because whom you yield yourself servant
[54:40] to obey his servant you'll be. Right.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; And when we become one with the devil's
[54:45] will or his nature, this will always put
[54:49] hostility and hatred between us and the
[54:51] nature of God.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; And those who have God's nature.
[54:57] You understand sometimes why there's
[54:59] bickering and fighting and things like
[55:01] that.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Because there's two spirits.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Now, I know
[55:07] um the devils, you know, want to get
[55:10] people fighting. I understand that.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; But just because you're standing for the
[55:16] truth doesn't mean the devil's gonna
[55:17] say, "It's okay. You just you be a good
[55:19] boy. You be a good girl." He's not going
[55:21] to do that.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; He's going to try to get you riled up.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; But you can't become one with a wrong
[55:29] message from the enemy,
[55:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Because then you you'll have this
[55:33] purpose to do ill. And you don't want
[55:36] that.
[55:37] The first nature that we're born with is
[55:39] a beastly nature. Nature,
[55:42] &gt;&gt; the most subtle beast united with a
[55:44] human being and were born by a a a
[55:50] beastly nature because of that union.
[55:53] Everyone was born in sin shapen in
[55:56] iniquity. I'll say it like this.
[55:58] Everybody was born either by a sexual
[56:01] act of pleasure or born by the will of
[56:04] their mother or father.
[56:09] And you want me to say that again?
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Well, then let's say amen.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Let's say amen to the word.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; And you know what it did? It produced a
[56:18] hybrid nature
[56:21] &gt;&gt; that knows to do good but chooses to do
[56:23] what it wants to do.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; In other words, as the Bible says, alive
[56:28] but really dead in sins and trespasses.
[56:30] Amen.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; And that's why Christ, the word, the
[56:33] light of God with whom there's no
[56:36] darkness, come to pay the price for our
[56:38] sins
[56:39] &gt;&gt; and allow the living word, which is the
[56:42] Holy Ghost to come and live inside of a
[56:44] person if they invite them in.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Right? They got to say, "God, I want you
[56:49] more than I want this ugly old nature."
[56:53] &gt;&gt; And you have to come to grips with that
[56:55] because inside of us, every one of us
[56:57] love doing the things in the world, and
[56:58] it was hard to give them up.
[57:01] Yes. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. That's
[57:03] that's the honesty. And even to this
[57:05] day, there's things that creep in and we
[57:07] want to hold on to them.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; And and we've got to be one with God and
[57:12] say, "Not my will, thy will be done."
[57:15] And the Holy Ghost will come into our
[57:17] lives.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Because the only way we're going to make
[57:20] it into that rapture that we're going to
[57:22] fly away is get so full of God that when
[57:25] he comes, he's going to come for his
[57:27] own.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:31] Now that Holy Ghost, it needs to be
[57:34] living inside of us. Why? It is the only
[57:37] thing that'll kill the devil inside of
[57:39] us.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; It is the only thing that'll stomp out
[57:43] the nature of the devil. We can do all
[57:46] we can to try to be a better person and,
[57:48] you know, discipline ourselves, but if
[57:51] we don't have the Holy Ghost inside of
[57:52] us, it will be fruitless. Amen.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; It's the only thing that would destroy
[57:59] the works of the devil. And 1 John 3:8
[58:01] says, "For this purpose, the son of God
[58:03] was manifested
[58:06] that he might destroy the works of the
[58:08] devil." Notice if the spirit of God
[58:11] would have remained in heaven,
[58:14] there is no way that he could have
[58:15] destroyed the works of the devil because
[58:17] the word was that the day you eat is the
[58:20] day you die. That's right.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; He had to come in the form of the flesh
[58:26] to pay the penalty and it destroyed the
[58:29] works of the devil that he could no
[58:31] longer the devil could never no longer
[58:33] hold us in hell.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; That that we're we're we're set free
[58:38] because God was manifested in the flesh.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you when God becomes
[58:43] manifested in our flesh, it'll destroy
[58:45] the works of the devil inside our
[58:47] nature. We'll have the nature of God
[58:50] Amen.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; It's real saints.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Turn with me if you would to Ephesians 2
[58:58] verse one. When we were out in the
[59:01] world, we were doing the things of the
[59:02] world. And by the grace of God, he came
[59:05] and spoke to us. Amen.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:1. And you have he quickened
[59:10] who were dead in trespasses and sins.
[59:13] where in times past you walked according
[59:15] to the course of this world, according
[59:16] to the prince of the power of the air,
[59:18] the spirit that now is working is still
[59:21] here.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Where is it at? is in those children who
[59:24] are being disobedient
[59:27] among whom also we all had our conver
[59:29] our conversations in times past in the
[59:31] lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires
[59:33] of the flesh and of the mind and where
[59:35] by nature just by nature the children of
[59:38] if I don't get what I want I'm going to
[59:40] show you
[59:42] &gt;&gt; the only thing you're going to show me
[59:44] &gt;&gt; is the devil
[59:46] &gt;&gt; that's the only thing you're showing me
[59:50] &gt;&gt; but God
[59:52] who is rich in mercy
[59:55] for his great love wherewith he loved
[59:58] us.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Even when we were dead in our sins have
[1:00:03] quickened us together with Christ by
[1:00:05] grace are you saved. Now we're laying
[1:00:08] this foundation because when we were
[1:00:10] dead in sins, God came and he loved us.
[1:00:12] He quickened us and he showed us the way
[1:00:14] out.
[1:00:16] Well, when Christ comes and lives inside
[1:00:18] of us, he will do the exact same thing
[1:00:21] to somebody else that he did to you.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; But he's going to use your body to get
[1:00:27] in there and reconcile somebody that's
[1:00:29] in sin back to him.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Because it's the same God that
[1:00:34] yesterday, today, and forever. He's not
[1:00:36] going to stop with you and say, "Okay,
[1:00:38] you're taken care of. You're going to
[1:00:40] heaven, and I don't need you anymore.
[1:00:42] You can go do what you want to do."
[1:00:44] That is not the nature of God.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; God called us and we followed him unto
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; unto justification,
[1:00:56] sanctification, and the baptism of the
[1:00:59] Holy Ghost. And Jesus said in Matthew
[1:01:02] 19:28, he said, "Verily I say unto you
[1:01:05] that ye which have followed me in the
[1:01:08] regeneration,
[1:01:11] the regeneration.
[1:01:14] When the son of man shall sit in the
[1:01:16] throne of his glory, you know, when
[1:01:18] we're raptured out of here, he shall
[1:01:20] also sit upon the 12 tribes
[1:01:23] uh the 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes
[1:01:25] of Israel and everyone." Now he
[1:01:28] expresses what you got to do to get
[1:01:29] through this regeneration here. And
[1:01:31] everyone that have forsaken houses or
[1:01:35] brethren or sisters or father or mother
[1:01:38] or wife or children or lands for my
[1:01:41] name's sake shall receive a hundfold and
[1:01:45] shall inherit eternal life.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:50] Well, brother John, that is not when I
[1:01:52] read when when I read he that believeth
[1:01:55] in baptiz is saved. That's not I didn't
[1:01:58] read that in there. I think this is a
[1:02:00] different doctrine. No, but to truly
[1:02:02] believe in Christ is to believe the
[1:02:04] whole word.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; You don't leave anything out.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; You leave part of it out, you leave your
[1:02:10] part out of the book of life. You add to
[1:02:12] it, then you're adding to the plagues
[1:02:13] that are going to come upon you.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; I'll say it like this. You you fathers,
[1:02:17] you mothers, and I'm talking about even
[1:02:19] you children. When you set an example
[1:02:21] before somebody that you know is not the
[1:02:24] word, you're adding a plague to your
[1:02:26] life.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Spirits.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the truth.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; We've got to, you know, we if we don't
[1:02:37] take the word of God serious,
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; it's only going to hurt us.
[1:02:45] It
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; it's going to hurt us because God ain't
[1:02:46] going to change his word for us. Amen.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; So true.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; So God wooing us closer every day to
[1:02:52] follow him. Follow the the the light of
[1:02:55] God's word. Amen. He said, "I am the
[1:02:58] light of the world, and he that
[1:02:59] followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
[1:03:02] shall not walk in hatred, shall not walk
[1:03:04] in in the things of their their desires,
[1:03:07] but they shall have the light of life."
[1:03:10] Now, the only light of life that I know,
[1:03:12] brother Dennis, is eternal life.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Eternal life is light.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, on the day of
[1:03:22] judgment, you know what's going to be
[1:03:23] there judging all of us?
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; The light of God.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; That's what's going to be there.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Now, when we truly follow Christ, we are
[1:03:34] actively becoming more like him.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what I mean by that
[1:03:40] is you're putting forth effort to become
[1:03:42] like him
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; and other people see it. They say things
[1:03:47] about it because they notice it. Our
[1:03:51] lives begin to testify that we're
[1:03:53] following Christ. Amen.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus himself said, "By the
[1:03:58] manifestation of perfect love shall all
[1:04:01] men know that you're following me,
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; that you're my disciple, that you're
[1:04:06] walking in the light,
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; you're loving the whole word because
[1:04:11] you're able to love others."
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; And that's what it means to truly follow
[1:04:17] Christ. It's not um well, I belong to
[1:04:18] this church
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; or I go to church or I pay my tithe.
[1:04:22] That is not following Christ. That's
[1:04:24] just part of what needs to be done. But
[1:04:26] there's a relationship and if that
[1:04:28] relationship doesn't get settled and and
[1:04:32] and be lived on on a daily basis, we've
[1:04:35] missed it.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; We've missed it. And I'll tell you, it
[1:04:38] isn't that we that that it isn't because
[1:04:41] it wasn't preached here. It's because
[1:04:43] the flesh did not want to submit.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; It the the the desire did not want to
[1:04:50] submit to the word. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; So, as God's followers, we press in to
[1:04:56] become more and more like him every day.
[1:04:58] As brother Dennis would say, he says
[1:05:01] that often in our men's meeting. 2
[1:05:03] Corinthians 5:17. Therefore, if any man
[1:05:05] be in Christ, he all things are passed
[1:05:07] away. He's a new creature. Behold, all
[1:05:10] things are passed away. Uh I'm so I'm
[1:05:12] going to read that the right way instead
[1:05:14] of the wrong way four times.
[1:05:17] Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he
[1:05:19] is a new creature.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Old things, old nature are passed away.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Behold, all things are become new
[1:05:30] because God is inside now.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; And he wants everything different than
[1:05:35] the way that we want it.
[1:05:38] and all things are of God.
[1:05:42] Who has reconciled us
[1:05:46] or
[1:05:48] changed us
[1:05:50] mutually. That's what that word means.
[1:05:54] In other words, he's not a he don't got
[1:05:56] robots. He don't come in your life and
[1:05:58] just shake you up and you you better
[1:05:59] listen to me.
[1:06:02] No. He comes and he knocks on the door
[1:06:04] of our heart.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Says, "Would you like
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; to have a relationship with me?
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; This is what I'd like you to do first.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Just do this." He would never put
[1:06:16] anything on us that we couldn't bear,
[1:06:18] right? Many things to tell you, but you
[1:06:20] can't bear it now. But he doesn't throw
[1:06:22] it all on one time. But if you don't do
[1:06:25] what Lord, he's asking you to do, he's
[1:06:27] not going to be able to take you to the
[1:06:29] next step.
[1:06:31] Yes.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; So he's reconciled us to himself by
[1:06:36] Jesus Christ and has given us the
[1:06:37] ministry of reconciliation.
[1:06:41] So we have changed together. It's been a
[1:06:43] mutual agreement. I desired. I sought
[1:06:45] the change. I paid the price. And God
[1:06:48] said I will come and do the work in you.
[1:06:50] Right? It's not by works that we have
[1:06:52] done.
[1:06:54] Right? It's by a submission to what he's
[1:06:56] asked us to do.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Right? He if he asks us to repent, we
[1:07:00] repent. If he asks us to to to to to
[1:07:03] make things right with our brother, our
[1:07:04] we make things right. Whatever God asks
[1:07:07] us to do, we do it. You know, a lot of
[1:07:09] times we we we we act like we're a judge
[1:07:12] over things. Like this is not important.
[1:07:14] I don't need to do that. This is all I
[1:07:16] need to do.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Well, if you can find it in the word,
[1:07:19] believe it. But if you can't find that
[1:07:21] in the word, you shouldn't say that.
[1:07:23] Amen.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, "Now the Lord
[1:07:28] is that spirit." Talking about changing
[1:07:31] mutually. Now, now the Lord is that
[1:07:33] spirit, and where the spirit of the Lord
[1:07:35] is, there is liberty.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Have you ever seen somebody they were
[1:07:41] mad?
[1:07:44] Has anybody ever seen anybody mad?
[1:07:49] I need participation.
[1:07:53] and
[1:07:54] you try to say something or do something
[1:07:56] and they don't change, they still remain
[1:07:59] mad
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; and you you kind of conclude there's not
[1:08:03] a whole lot you can do until they
[1:08:05] change.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; And so you you don't feel at liberty to
[1:08:10] go there and have popcorn with them.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Right. You you you just it it you you're
[1:08:16] you feel you feel there's something
[1:08:18] there.
[1:08:21] Well, when God comes and we don't give
[1:08:23] him liberty, come inside, Lord. I'm
[1:08:26] hungering for you today.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; He sees that that Brother Bam
[1:08:35] says there's like a a wolf nature that
[1:08:38] can get on us
[1:08:41] and he don't feel comfortable coming
[1:08:43] there. So he comes and he sits on
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; a a pole or a line just waiting
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; for us to change our minds.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Because there's got to be a mutual
[1:08:57] agreement in in the new birth.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; The new birth is not just something that
[1:09:02] happens with the turn of a calendar. No,
[1:09:05] you've got to have a desire. No matter
[1:09:08] how bad the preaching is.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No matter how bad the
[1:09:12] preaching is, you got to have a desire
[1:09:14] to be changed.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; And if you got to have music to feel
[1:09:19] good, we're not talking about the same
[1:09:21] thing. But because I'm not talking about
[1:09:23] emotion,
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about something that happens
[1:09:26] on the deep part of the soul. A desire
[1:09:28] that I want to be like Jesus when I get
[1:09:30] done.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Something that's not here and there and
[1:09:34] back and forth and up and down. It's
[1:09:37] something that's steady Eddie. That's
[1:09:38] right. Amen.
[1:09:42] God reconciles us little by little as we
[1:09:46] give him liberty.
[1:09:49] Verse 18. But we all with open face,
[1:09:53] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:09:56] Lord, were changed into the same image
[1:10:01] from glory to glory, from experience to
[1:10:05] experience, from church service to
[1:10:08] church service, from prayer room to
[1:10:10] prayer room. Amen.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; From entering in the spirit to entering
[1:10:14] into the spirit.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Even by the spirit of the Lord.
[1:10:20] So we come to church, we hear God's
[1:10:23] heart for our lives. We say amen. So be
[1:10:26] it for our lives. We leave the church
[1:10:28] and we begin to apply that word slowly.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; And God sees that there's a mutual
[1:10:34] desire that you have. You are literally
[1:10:36] having the same desire that he just
[1:10:37] preached to you.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; He sees that. And you know what he does?
[1:10:42] He then quickens the word in your life.
[1:10:44] And now you're living something you've
[1:10:46] never lived before.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; We've all experienced it.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; But God wants us to continue
[1:10:51] experiencing it.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; There's more things because all things
[1:10:55] need to become
[1:10:57] God. Amen.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; I am the light of the world. He that
[1:11:01] followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
[1:11:03] but shall have the light of life. So,
[1:11:06] we're no longer walking in darkness, but
[1:11:08] we're walking in the light of God as he
[1:11:12] manifests himself out of us. Jesus said,
[1:11:15] "As long as I am in the world, I am the
[1:11:18] light of the world." But there came a
[1:11:19] time that Jesus said in Matthew 5:14,
[1:11:22] "That you are the light of the world."
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; A city that is set on a hill cannot be
[1:11:27] hid. Now, notice this.
[1:11:31] He didn't say somebody else is the light
[1:11:33] of the world. He said you. Right?
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; I'll say it like this.
[1:11:42] If God was here and he spoke this word,
[1:11:44] you are the light of the world. At this
[1:11:46] point, you cannot look to anybody else
[1:11:48] in this room except yourself for that
[1:11:50] responsibility.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; You are the You are the light
[1:11:57] to get us out of here.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; You are the light to get your family
[1:12:02] out. Amen.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; You're the light to get your your
[1:12:05] co-workers out,
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; your your neighbors, your friends. You
[1:12:08] are the light. Well, they won't listen
[1:12:11] to me. Tell them anyways.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Tell them anyways.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; You're not responsible for them to
[1:12:18] receive it. You're only responsible to
[1:12:20] shine it.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Shine it. You're the light of the world.
[1:12:25] A city that a city that is set on hill
[1:12:28] cannot be hid. So, you're going to tell
[1:12:31] me you got the light of God and other
[1:12:33] people around you aren't going to see
[1:12:34] it.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; If it's in there, it's coming out.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; The only way it's not going to come out
[1:12:42] is it's not in there.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Neither do men light a candle and put it
[1:12:49] under a bushel.
[1:12:51] I'm a Christian, but you know, I'm not
[1:12:53] going to bring it out right now because
[1:12:54] I know you know how I know how they'll
[1:12:56] react.
[1:12:58] but on a candlestick, and it giveth
[1:13:01] light unto all that are in the house.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Let your light so shine before men that
[1:13:09] they may see your good works and glorify
[1:13:11] your father which is in heaven. Now
[1:13:13] notice it says your good works.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; you're joining together with God.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:22] Now,
[1:13:24] when somebody's in darkness,
[1:13:31] they don't know it's God in you,
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; So, when you when you do this good work,
[1:13:38] this good deed, this this love, this
[1:13:41] forgiveness, this prayer, or whatever
[1:13:43] you're doing with them, when you do
[1:13:45] that, all is they're seeing is your good
[1:13:47] works.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:53] Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Remember
[1:13:57] when they looked at when Peter and and
[1:14:00] John they prayed for the the man at at
[1:14:03] the gate called beautiful and he got his
[1:14:04] sight.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; The Bible says they took note that these
[1:14:09] men had been with Jesus.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; And when you you you are doing the works
[1:14:15] of Christ, he that believeth on me, the
[1:14:18] works I do, he shall do also. When
[1:14:20] you're doing those works, others are
[1:14:22] going to see Christ in you.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; They're say, "I never seen that before.
[1:14:28] I've never seen somebody love and
[1:14:30] forgive me like you do." What? What?
[1:14:31] What is that?
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Now your door's open.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Tell them about Jesus.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; And your motive for doing good works in
[1:14:45] front of others is what the scripture
[1:14:48] tells us right here. We just read it.
[1:14:49] What is our mo What is our motive?
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; So God can get glory through your works.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we do things and we want
[1:14:58] people to look at us.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Look what I did. Look at me
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; like it's not about you.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; It's about Christ in you loving others.
[1:15:09] You're reconciling others to to Christ.
[1:15:12] You're not reconciling others to you.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; So let your light so shine. That word
[1:15:17] shine means to give light to beam it
[1:15:20] with radiant brilliancancy.
[1:15:23] Wow.
[1:15:26] I'll tell you what, if you were going to
[1:15:28] buy a light and it said it it beams with
[1:15:30] radiant brilliancancy, what are you
[1:15:32] going to think when you first read that?
[1:15:33] When you first hear about that, you're
[1:15:36] going to think, "Do I want this room to
[1:15:37] be that bright? Is it going to blind my
[1:15:39] eyes?" Right?
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; So, let your light so shine that it's
[1:15:43] beaming out,
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; right? Not. Well, I got to check out the
[1:15:47] waters here.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Beam it.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Let others know that's the way to shine.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Not everyone is going to see the light.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Not everyone is going to walk in the
[1:16:03] light as he's in the light.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; But God still wants us to beam it out.
[1:16:09] 2 Corinthians 4:3 says, "But if our
[1:16:11] gospel be hid, it is hid to them that
[1:16:15] are lost."
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; In other words, there's nothing you can
[1:16:20] do about it.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Do Do you think that Jesus
[1:16:28] could convert any of the devils back to
[1:16:32] angels?
[1:16:34] Do you think we can convert someone
[1:16:39] who sold out to the devil?
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; I mean, everybody's not going to see the
[1:16:45] light.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; But guarantee God knows those that are
[1:16:49] his.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; He does. He's not going to lose one.
[1:16:52] They're in the palm of his hand. But we
[1:16:54] need to understand if our gospel is hid
[1:16:56] to somebody, it's hid to them that are
[1:16:57] lost.
[1:16:59] in whom the God of this world have
[1:17:01] blinded the minds of them which what
[1:17:04] believe not.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Lest the light of the glorious gospel of
[1:17:10] Christ who's in the image of God should
[1:17:12] shine unto them.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; For we preach not ourselves but Christ
[1:17:18] Jesus the Lord and ourselves your
[1:17:20] servants for Jesus sake. In other words,
[1:17:23] it's not about us. It's about others and
[1:17:26] we're trying to get others to Christ,
[1:17:28] reconciling them.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Verse number six. For God who commanded
[1:17:34] the light to beam out his light with
[1:17:37] radiant brilliancancy to shine out of
[1:17:40] darkness
[1:17:42] has shined in our heart. So why did God
[1:17:46] come into our heart? Why did he shine
[1:17:48] that light in there? to give the light
[1:17:51] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[1:17:54] the face of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; God called us out of sin.
[1:18:01] We saw the light. We begin to read the
[1:18:03] Bible more. We begin to read the message
[1:18:05] more.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; We begin to feed.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; We begin to get the knowledge, the true
[1:18:13] knowledge of Christ.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; And then we begin to walk in it.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's no good to read it if you
[1:18:21] don't walk in it.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; In fact, you're in worse shape if you
[1:18:25] read it and you don't walk in it.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; The Jes Bible says it'd be better if
[1:18:30] they have not known the way of the Lord
[1:18:32] than to know it and to turn it down.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; God doesn't give us light just for
[1:18:42] ourselves alone.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Or so we can judge others with it.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Right. I got this. I got this light now.
[1:18:49] Now I can judge others.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Or I got this light now. It's all for
[1:18:53] me. It's not for either of those.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; God gives us the light to give it to
[1:18:58] others, to help others, to live for
[1:19:01] others, to save others, to reconcile
[1:19:04] others, to himself.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Somebody gave us the light.
[1:19:11] Somebody came by and gave us the light.
[1:19:14] Every one of us sitting here.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; We weren't alone. Jesus appeared in the
[1:19:18] room.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; He chose the foolishness of preaching to
[1:19:21] save men.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; And God wants to continue on that
[1:19:25] process to get others saved to use us.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; But if we're just caught into this this
[1:19:30] religion of just me and God, just me and
[1:19:33] God. No, it's it's it's you doing what
[1:19:36] God wants you to do to help others.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; You know, you if we don't have a burden
[1:19:41] for others,
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; and you're and you're telling me Christ
[1:19:45] is there,
[1:19:47] I mean, Christ today, he's still in the
[1:19:49] same mindset that he was on the day of
[1:19:51] Calvary.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Very true.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; These many years later, he still cares
[1:19:58] about the person that's living today
[1:20:00] that don't have him.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; And he's looking for somebody that will
[1:20:06] be be a vessel to shine the light to
[1:20:09] them,
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; to be a light to them. And you know, you
[1:20:12] do that by actually living something
[1:20:14] different than everybody else does in
[1:20:15] the world. Right.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; It ain't the knowledge. Ain't you got
[1:20:18] more knowledge.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Your your knowledge ain't that's not it.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people out there that
[1:20:25] don't know Christ that probably know
[1:20:26] more about God or know more about this
[1:20:28] book than we do.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; But I'll say it like this. It's got to
[1:20:33] be a life that nobody else lives.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Something's got to attract them. Yes.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Now look, verse 7 says, "But we, the
[1:20:42] Sendelite church, but we have this
[1:20:45] treasure
[1:20:47] in our hearts, in our earn vessels."
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; We have Christ. It's a treasure in our
[1:20:52] earn vessel that the excellency of the
[1:20:56] power may be of God and not of us.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; When you got the Holy Ghost, it's of
[1:21:04] God.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the Holy Ghost isn't
[1:21:07] doing it, there ain't much power there,
[1:21:09] by the way.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. I feel like preaching
[1:21:13] now.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; We are troubled on every side. Now,
[1:21:18] look, look what the power is going to do
[1:21:20] inside. We are troubled on every side,
[1:21:23] yet not distressed.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; We're perplexed, but we're not in
[1:21:29] despair.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; We're even persecuted, but we're not
[1:21:33] forsaken.
[1:21:35] We're cast down but not destroyed.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; So you you see
[1:21:41] we have a treasure, a power inside of
[1:21:44] us. Yes, our outside vessels, they're
[1:21:46] going through all these things, but the
[1:21:49] treasure inside of us is what keeps us
[1:21:51] steady, Eddie.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; It's what keeps us going. How many, you
[1:21:55] know, we need to thank God for the
[1:21:57] keeping power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Keeps us through that stuff.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Now, what's happening in our life? Verse
[1:22:03] 10 says, "Always bearing about in our
[1:22:08] earth and vessel, our body, now the
[1:22:11] dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life
[1:22:14] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[1:22:17] our bodies." Now, we sing that song,
[1:22:19] must Jesus bear the cross alone.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; We know the scripture, I am crucified
[1:22:25] with Christ, I die daily. Amen.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; We got these scriptures and we must all
[1:22:30] if we if we don't feel a pain in dying,
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; I doubt whether there's going to be very
[1:22:35] much life coming forth.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; It it says always. Always. That is that
[1:22:42] what your Bible says? Always bearing
[1:22:44] about in our body the dying of the Lord
[1:22:47] Jesus.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; That the life also of Jesus might be
[1:22:50] made manifest. for which for we which
[1:22:54] live are always delivered unto the death
[1:22:57] for Jesus' sake. In other words,
[1:23:02] have you have you have you ever done
[1:23:05] something and you you say when you done
[1:23:08] it, I can't believe I just did that.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; I can't believe I just said that.
[1:23:16] And you realize that was not the right
[1:23:18] thing to do.
[1:23:21] That was bad.
[1:23:23] Are you with me?
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Am I just speaking about myself?
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. But at that point, I wasn't We
[1:23:33] weren't bearing about in our body the
[1:23:35] dying. We weren't dying out.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; How many times you just want to show
[1:23:40] somebody how great you are?
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; I I want I want you to know, you know,
[1:23:47] that it was me that did that. You know
[1:23:49] what I'm talking about?
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; So, at that point, there's you're
[1:23:53] there's no you haven't died at that
[1:23:56] moment.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; You're still a Christian, still go to
[1:23:58] church, but your vessel got lent over
[1:24:01] there,
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; And you wanted some of the glory. You
[1:24:03] wanted you wanted people to look at you
[1:24:05] or or or or you're trying to be funny or
[1:24:08] or or whatever it might be,
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; And the thing is, we must always be
[1:24:13] about dying.
[1:24:15] We must. That's the only way the life of
[1:24:17] Christ is going to come forth. For we
[1:24:20] which live are always delivered unto the
[1:24:23] death for Jesus' sake. That the life
[1:24:26] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[1:24:29] what? Our mortal flesh. Not when we get
[1:24:33] to the other side, but right here.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Look at the conclusion here in verse 12.
[1:24:39] So then death works in us, but life in
[1:24:43] you. Amen.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; So, what does that mean? I I've come,
[1:24:47] brother Ron. I I'm going to reconcile.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; We're going to we're going to die out.
[1:24:52] Death is going to be in us so we can
[1:24:54] give life to somebody.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Death is working in us. We don't get to
[1:24:59] do our will, but we're we're going to
[1:25:00] live for others. Life is going to come
[1:25:02] for others.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; But you we got to have the mindset of
[1:25:06] what our calling is. Right.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; It it you don't have to be called to to
[1:25:11] preach or do Sunday school, but you have
[1:25:14] to be called to give Christ to somebody
[1:25:16] who doesn't have Christ.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; An ambassador.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Let's drop down to verse 17. And it's
[1:25:24] hard to do, right? It's hard to do this,
[1:25:26] right? To live for others.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; We're encouraged here in verse 17. For
[1:25:31] our light affliction, notice, our light
[1:25:34] affliction, which is but for a moment,
[1:25:38] workketh for us a far more exceeding
[1:25:44] and eternal weight of glory.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; While we look not at the things which
[1:25:52] are seen,
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; but the things which are not seen.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; For the things which are seen are
[1:25:58] they're temporal.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the things which are not seen
[1:26:02] are eternal.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; We need to look at everything through
[1:26:08] eternal lenses.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Eternal lenses. Set your affections on
[1:26:14] things above and not the things of the
[1:26:17] earth. Amen. Philippians chapter chapter
[1:26:20] 2. You know the same same stuff is
[1:26:23] happening.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. Time is
[1:26:26] just going by too quick.
[1:26:33] Lord, help us.
[1:26:35] Lord, help me. Lord, help your people to
[1:26:38] be able to sit just a little bit longer.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; You know that it's it's 69 in here, but
[1:26:45] I'm sweating. Terrible. All right.
[1:26:48] Philippians 2:12. This is I'm going to
[1:26:50] tell you this whole message was because
[1:26:52] of this verse came to my heart, you
[1:26:55] know, through the week. So, I want to
[1:26:57] get to this. Wherefore, my beloved,
[1:27:01] as you have always obeyed, not as in my
[1:27:05] presence only, but now much more in my
[1:27:08] absence, work out your own salvation
[1:27:11] with fear and trembling.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Remember the day you gave your heart to
[1:27:16] the Lord?
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Remember the tears?
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Remember that? Oh, God, I just I want to
[1:27:23] be pleasing. I want to make it.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. I think the fear of God is
[1:27:30] the beginning of all wisdom.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And I I think we just need to keep that
[1:27:34] with us. We don't want to get we don't
[1:27:37] want to get lukewarm like leodysa.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Now notice, for it is God which workketh
[1:27:43] in you both to will and to do of his
[1:27:45] good pleasure. So we do all things
[1:27:48] without murmurings and disputings,
[1:27:51] that you may have a testimony, that you
[1:27:53] may be blameless and harmless, the sons
[1:27:55] of God. Now notice this. Blameless and
[1:27:58] harmless. Now who's that for? Who's that
[1:28:01] verse for? Is this is this Who's this
[1:28:03] verse for?
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; One, two, three, four.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Okay. If it's for you, you've got to
[1:28:12] take the responsibility of it.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; This is what's beautiful about this.
[1:28:18] that you may be blameless and harmless,
[1:28:21] the sons of God, without rebuke, in the
[1:28:23] midst of a crooked and perverse nation,
[1:28:26] among whom you shine as lights in the
[1:28:30] world.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; There's a difference between you and
[1:28:34] somebody that murmurss and complains and
[1:28:37] backbites and says something negative.
[1:28:42] holding forth the word of life that you
[1:28:45] that I may rejoice in the day of Christ
[1:28:47] that I may that I have not run in vain
[1:28:49] neither labored in vain. I mean, there
[1:28:51] are people we know that have come into
[1:28:53] the light, that have come into the
[1:28:55] truth, you know, perhaps by you that
[1:28:58] went back out into the world,
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; and I'll say it, it was it's vain for
[1:29:03] them.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Right? Because they didn't stay with it.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; But for those that stay with it, praise
[1:29:10] God, it'll be worth it all.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Now, we know the days that we're living
[1:29:15] in the church condition. This know also
[1:29:17] that the last days perilous times shall
[1:29:20] come. For men shall be lovers of their
[1:29:21] own self, covetous, boasters, proud
[1:29:23] blasphemers, disobedient to parents
[1:29:27] unthankful,
[1:29:29] unholy, without natural affection, truth
[1:29:31] breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
[1:29:34] fierce, despisers of those that are
[1:29:36] good, traitors, heady, high-minded,
[1:29:38] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:29:40] God, having a form of godliness. And
[1:29:42] what is our job?
[1:29:46] to turn away from them having a form of
[1:29:49] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:29:52] from such turn away.
[1:29:56] That's the condition
[1:29:59] of Leodysia.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; This is the condition of the worldly
[1:30:06] church member in Leodysia. It's the
[1:30:08] nature. Notice he's talking about the
[1:30:10] nature.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:14] But we also live in a perverse nation
[1:30:20] and not only a perverse nation but a
[1:30:22] perverse planet
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; where women want to be men and men don't
[1:30:27] even want to be men.
[1:30:30] Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:30:33] beastality and popilia
[1:30:37] you know the word.
[1:30:40] And you know what it is?
[1:30:42] Where 18-year-olds can physically alter
[1:30:44] their gender.
[1:30:47] The world we're living in
[1:30:50] where men and women can divorce for no
[1:30:52] reason.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; In every in the United States, all
[1:30:57] states permit no fault divorce, meaning
[1:31:01] a spouse can obtain a divorce without
[1:31:04] proving the other spouse has did
[1:31:07] anything wrong.
[1:31:09] You know, you we've heard of no fault
[1:31:11] insurance, right?
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Well, no fault divorce.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Hey, just
[1:31:22] there's not one bit of scripture to back
[1:31:24] that up.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; There's only one scripture that allows
[1:31:29] for divorce. Does anybody know what that
[1:31:31] is?
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody knows your scripture.
[1:31:39] It's not adultery.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Adultery is is not
[1:31:47] the reason.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; It's fornication.
[1:31:55] Matthew 19:3, the Pharisees also came
[1:31:58] unto Jesus, and what were they doing?
[1:32:00] tempting him, the Bible says,
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; "And saying unto him, is it lawful for a
[1:32:06] man to put away his wife for every
[1:32:08] cause?"
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Verse seven.
[1:32:13] And the Pharisees asked Jesus, "Why did
[1:32:18] Moses
[1:32:20] then command to give a writing of
[1:32:23] divorcement and to put her away?"
[1:32:27] And he saith unto them, Moses, because
[1:32:30] of the hardness of your heart,
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; suffered you to put away your wives.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; But from the beginning, it was not so.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; So just like today in this perverse
[1:32:43] nation that we live in today, no fault
[1:32:46] divorce, no fault insurance.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; It's there because of the hardness of
[1:32:51] the people. The people want it. Why do
[1:32:53] we got abortions? Because the people
[1:32:54] want it.
[1:32:56] No different.
[1:32:58] And I say unto you, whosoever shall put
[1:33:01] away his wife, except it be for
[1:33:03] fornication,
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; and shall marry another, committh
[1:33:07] adultery.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; And whosoever marrith her that is put
[1:33:10] away committh adultery. And his
[1:33:12] disciples said unto him, I if if the
[1:33:15] case of a man be so with a wife, it is
[1:33:17] not even a good thing to get married.
[1:33:21] You know there come that time where you
[1:33:23] just want to like I want to get married.
[1:33:26] I want to get married so bad. I want to
[1:33:34] but he saith unto them all. All men
[1:33:36] cannot receive the same say they to whom
[1:33:40] it is given.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus said I am the light of the world.
[1:33:44] He that followeth me shall not walk in
[1:33:45] darkness but shall have the light of
[1:33:48] life.
[1:33:51] In other words, we become the light of
[1:33:52] Christ to the world. Doing what? Living
[1:33:55] for others.
[1:33:57] Getting our vessels to be joint with
[1:34:00] Christ. Just as Satan was became joint
[1:34:04] with the most subtoast and the most I'll
[1:34:06] say it like this, the most subtaste lent
[1:34:08] his body over.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; And they became one.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; We do the same thing, but it's only to
[1:34:15] Christ. We lend our body over to Christ,
[1:34:17] the Holy Ghost, and we let him use us.
[1:34:20] And we become conscious of what we're
[1:34:21] doing. We're conscious of Jesus said,
[1:34:24] "You don't take my life. I lay it down
[1:34:26] consciously. I know that I'm giving
[1:34:28] myself to others."
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Because you become one.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:35] 2 Corinthians 5:18, God have given us
[1:34:39] the ministry of reconciliation to that
[1:34:42] God was in Christ, reconciling the world
[1:34:44] to himself, not imputing their
[1:34:45] trespasses unto them, and have committed
[1:34:47] unto us the word of reconciliation. It
[1:34:50] didn't stop with Christ. Now it's Christ
[1:34:52] in us. Now then, we are ambassadors for
[1:34:54] Christ as Christ as through as though
[1:34:58] God did beseech you by us. Amen. We pray
[1:35:02] you in Christstead be reconciled. So as
[1:35:05] ambassadors we go to people and we teach
[1:35:07] as Jesus said teaching them to do all
[1:35:10] things whatsoever I've commanded you.
[1:35:13] You read in the Bible
[1:35:15] that this is what God's will is and you
[1:35:18] share it with somebody.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; You share it with them.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; You don't cram it down their throat,
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; but you share it with them. Amen.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Knowing the terror of the Lord, we
[1:35:32] persuade men.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; There's got to be that burden that look,
[1:35:38] if you turn this down what I'm telling
[1:35:40] you,
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; you're turning down eternal life. There
[1:35:43] will be a day where I will see you no
[1:35:45] more. Amen.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; So, you're you're put in a a pickle with
[1:35:50] knowing something they don't know
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; that this is a real serious situation
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; and you got to get the truth across to
[1:35:58] them.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; And and and
[1:36:02] I I tell you the greatest thing you do
[1:36:03] is lay down your life and live for them.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Let them see that you have a greater
[1:36:08] power inside of you that you don't have
[1:36:10] to live for yourself anymore.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; But you've been set free from yourself.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Now your life is being lived for others.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just have a couple more quotes I
[1:36:23] want to read
[1:36:26] and then we're finished. Amen.
[1:36:29] And that day on Calvary, Brother Ram
[1:36:30] says, "Someone said, "How can you stand
[1:36:33] and let somebody call you such bad
[1:36:35] names?"
[1:36:38] Brother Ram says, "You don't live for
[1:36:39] yourself, you live for others.
[1:36:43] that you might redeem that man.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; You become sons. And the trouble of it
[1:36:49] is the church has forgotten. They were
[1:36:52] sons.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; You're a son. You're a daughter.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; You're taking Christ's place. Remember
[1:37:00] ambassadors. You're a son. So don't live
[1:37:03] for yourself. Live for others.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; In the message, faith in the son of God.
[1:37:09] Brother says so such day I want to live.
[1:37:13] So each day he said so each day I want
[1:37:15] to live not for myself. If I live for
[1:37:19] myself I live a selfish life.
[1:37:23] If I I want to live for others and give
[1:37:26] what strength I have not to myself
[1:37:32] and to my own pleasures
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; but for the benefit of others
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; that that'll build the kingdom of God.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Notice the motive of why we're supposed
[1:37:44] to be on the planet.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; One more quote, okay, and then we're
[1:37:47] done. Thank you for your patience.
[1:37:50] Brother Ram said the day that day on
[1:37:51] Calvary says would there be someone else
[1:37:54] he's at the end here making the call. He
[1:37:59] says I want to know him.
[1:38:01] I want this to be a day at Calvary for
[1:38:04] me. I'm sick. I'm tired.
[1:38:07] What's the use of me throwing around
[1:38:09] here and the very thing that I was born
[1:38:12] to do? I was born born to be a son of
[1:38:15] God. And here I am holding on to the
[1:38:18] things of the world. God, let me be
[1:38:21] crucified today. Let me crucify today
[1:38:24] myself and my ideas that I may live with
[1:38:26] Christ and live for others.
[1:38:30] No matter what they do to me to make fun
[1:38:33] of me, to persecute me and say all evil
[1:38:35] against me and the things, let me just
[1:38:38] humbly walk along and and be meek like a
[1:38:42] lamb like he did.
[1:38:44] And someday he promised to raise me up
[1:38:47] again at the last day. I'm looking
[1:38:48] forward to that day. He said, "Would
[1:38:50] there be someone would there be some
[1:38:53] more hands that would go up?" God bless
[1:38:55] you back there and you. All right, some
[1:38:58] God bless you. God bless you some more.
[1:39:02] Now before we pray, let's stand
[1:39:03] together.
[1:39:05] The desire
[1:39:08] to to to be like Jesus, to really be
[1:39:11] like Jesus,
[1:39:13] we got to give up oursel, right?
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can't be like Jesus and hold on
[1:39:19] to oursel.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that he's made a way for us.
[1:39:25] We are now the light of the world. Amen.
[1:39:28] Amen.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that little chorus. We are
[1:39:32] the generation.
[1:39:35] We are the generation.
[1:39:37] We're a chosen generation.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; We are the generation.
[1:39:50] We're themination,
[1:39:53] the final voice. The world will hear.
[1:39:57] The coming of the Lord is near.
[1:40:02] Living out the revelation.
[1:40:07] Overcoming sins temptation. The truth
[1:40:10] will go to every tongue and nation.
[1:40:17] We are the chosen generation.
[1:40:25] We are the generation
[1:40:30] where the calmination,
[1:40:33] the final voice the world will hear. The
[1:40:37] coming of the Lord is near. Living out
[1:40:43] the revelation.
[1:40:46] Overcoming sin temptation. The truth
[1:40:49] will go to every tongue and nation.
[1:40:56] We are the chosen generation.
[1:41:01] Amen. Sing it with all your heart now.
[1:41:04] We are the generation.
[1:41:10] We're themination,
[1:41:12] the final voice the world will hear. The
[1:41:17] coming of the Lord is near. Giving out
[1:41:22] the revelation.
[1:41:25] Overcoming sins, temptation. The truth
[1:41:29] will go to every tongue and nation.
[1:41:36] We are the chosen generation.
[1:41:44] Amen. And I'm I am thankful. I I think
[1:41:47] about all the people in my family
[1:41:50] uh that I'm talking about from before me
[1:41:54] and um none of my family came in
[1:42:03] and that he chose me out of my brother,
[1:42:06] out of my dad, out of my mother.
[1:42:09] What a privilege.
[1:42:12] He's chose us
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; with that choosing. Now there comes that
[1:42:17] responsibility
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; to share it with others
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; to shine that light
[1:42:24] because there's probably not probably
[1:42:26] there is somebody for all of us to speak
[1:42:29] to.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; And it may just be one in a family.
[1:42:34] That's right.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; And the the more serious we can get
[1:42:39] about that, the quicker we can get out
[1:42:41] of here.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; I can imagine Joshua and Caleb saying,
[1:42:45] "Let's get this thing going. I want my
[1:42:47] mountain."
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. Shine, Jesus.
