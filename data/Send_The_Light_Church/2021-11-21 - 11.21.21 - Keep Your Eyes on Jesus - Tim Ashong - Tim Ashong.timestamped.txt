[20:24] house of the lord this morning
[20:27] and it's always a privilege
[20:29] to be in his house
[20:32] and we are looking forward
[20:36] to the time when we will cross over this
[20:38] life
[20:40] and
[20:41] go on the other side
[20:44] where we'll be with our lord and our
[20:46] savior throughout eternity
[20:50] what a day that will be
[20:53] may the lord give grace and strength to
[20:55] us
[20:56] to keep pressing on
[20:58] the upward way
[21:00] so you are welcome in the name of jesus
[21:03] christ let's open to genesis chapter 3.
[21:10] genesis 3 we read some few lines from
[21:13] genesis 3
[21:14] and then we also read from isaiah 45
[21:19] and also from matthew chapter 14 just
[21:22] few verses and
[21:24] we
[21:25] so let's read genesis 6
[21:27] 3 i mean genesis 3 6
[21:31] and when
[21:34] the woman saw
[21:36] that the tree was good for food
[21:41] and that it was pleasant to the eyes
[21:46] and a tree to be desired to make one
[21:50] wise
[21:52] she took of the fruit thereof
[21:54] and did eat
[21:56] and gave also unto a husband with a and
[22:00] he did it amen
[22:03] so isaiah
[22:08] 45
[22:10] is reason when we read that we can see
[22:13] them and they will do the rest
[22:15] isaiah 45
[22:22] isaac 45 is 22.
[22:29] look unto me
[22:31] and be ye saved
[22:34] all the ends of the earth
[22:37] for i am god
[22:40] and there is none s
[22:43] shall be seated and i want to read from
[22:45] matthew chapter 14.
[22:55] let's read matthew 14
[22:57] verse 28
[23:04] and peter answered him and said
[23:08] lord
[23:10] if it be thou
[23:12] bid me
[23:13] come unto thee
[23:16] on the water
[23:19] and he said come
[23:23] and when peter was camped out of the
[23:25] sheep
[23:26] he walked under water to go to jesus
[23:31] but when he saw the wind bostros
[23:34] he was afraid
[23:36] and beginning to sink
[23:39] he cried saying
[23:43] lord
[23:44] save me
[23:46] amen
[23:48] maybe we'll read one more scripture and
[23:50] that is from hebrews
[23:54] hebrews chapter 12.
[23:56] [Music]
[23:58] wherefore same we also are compassed
[24:01] about
[24:03] we so great a crowd
[24:06] of witnesses
[24:08] let us lay aside every weight
[24:14] and the sin which does so easily beset
[24:17] us
[24:18] and let us run with patience
[24:21] the race that is set before us
[24:25] looking unto jesus
[24:27] the author
[24:29] and the finisher of our faith who for
[24:32] the joy that was set before him endure
[24:35] the cross
[24:37] despising the shame
[24:39] and he sat down at the right hand of the
[24:42] throne of god
[24:45] amen
[24:46] so we thank god for the reading of the
[24:48] scriptures
[24:50] we love to read it because the way to
[24:52] grow as a christian is to read your
[24:55] bible every day
[24:57] and pray every day that's how you can
[25:00] grow that's how you can be you know
[25:02] spiritual read the bible and pray
[25:05] i mean and as you read you pray lord let
[25:08] your spirit come upon it
[25:10] reveal it to me because many people read
[25:13] and they don't see it
[25:16] so it takes the only ghost to reveal it
[25:19] because the holy ghost wrote the word
[25:22] so when the holy ghost wrote the word
[25:25] when the holy ghost come upon you it
[25:27] will reveal it to you
[25:30] so we need the revelation of the word of
[25:32] the lord
[25:34] we pray that as we read
[25:36] may the holy spirit reveal it to us
[25:39] as we listen to it may the holy spirit
[25:42] reveal it to us
[25:44] because
[25:45] you know there are many that are
[25:47] educated and you know scholars and this
[25:49] and they read it and they don't see it
[25:53] they don't see the reading yeah yeah my
[25:55] son don't see it
[25:57] you read ah you know repent and be
[25:59] baptized i don't see it but i read it so
[26:02] it takes the spirit of god to reveal
[26:04] and to obey one's spiritual eyes
[26:08] and spiritual understanding
[26:11] so we thank god that to know god it is
[26:14] not by education but it is by revelation
[26:18] and god has to reveal himself to a man
[26:24] if god doesn't do it
[26:26] you there is no way for you to make it
[26:28] because god is so great
[26:31] and then it can be so simple
[26:33] he hides in simplicity
[26:36] and he reveals himself in simplicity
[26:39] and sometimes we are looking for a way
[26:41] up and he's right down here
[26:47] and so
[26:48] we miss him
[26:51] and it has if anybody has come to know
[26:54] god it's because god revealed it
[26:59] because
[27:00] the scripture says brethren
[27:03] know your calling
[27:05] many mighty men are after the flesh
[27:08] not many nobles but god has revealed
[27:12] this thing to beaves
[27:14] such as we learn amen
[27:18] so god has to reveal himself amen
[27:23] and that is the only way we can know him
[27:25] and jesus said father i thank you
[27:27] because lord you've eaten these things
[27:30] to the wise and reveal it
[27:32] no one can know the father accept his
[27:34] review to you no one can understand
[27:36] except the father revealing to you amen
[27:39] so we are blessed
[27:41] amen to know the things that we have
[27:43] known
[27:44] to hear the things that we have had what
[27:47] a privileged people we are
[27:50] we bless the name of the lord
[27:52] every day should be thanksgiving day in
[27:55] our lives
[27:56] you don't have to wait for one year
[27:58] before you give thanks to god
[28:00] every day should be a thanksgiving day
[28:04] when you wake up from your bed it says
[28:06] thank you lord
[28:08] every step you thank the lord for it
[28:10] when you drink water you thank the lord
[28:12] for it
[28:13] whatever movement we turn the love for
[28:15] it because
[28:17] without him we can do nothing
[28:20] we can't walk without him
[28:22] we can't do anything with that thing so
[28:25] our lives should be full of thanksgiving
[28:28] and praises to the living god
[28:31] hallelujah
[28:33] and
[28:34] i want us to speak this morning on
[28:37] keep your eyes on jesus
[28:42] keep your eyes on him
[28:46] because what you look at affects your
[28:49] life
[28:52] what you look at affect your life and so
[28:56] you can be affected
[28:58] in a positive way or in a negative way
[29:04] so there is something about what you
[29:06] look at amen
[29:11] that's why you see a lot of adverts all
[29:13] around us
[29:17] adverts all around
[29:19] you get step out and you look around
[29:22] advent of food advert of clothing advert
[29:25] of this advent of that and
[29:28] we make our choices by what we look at
[29:34] amen praise the lord
[29:36] you take care you shouldn't get out and
[29:38] you see these uh boats and the sun you
[29:40] know make some sandwich and some thick
[29:43] bacon and so and sometimes you want to
[29:46] lick the air
[29:49] so i'm good that's what i'm looking for
[29:55] what you saw it
[29:57] so what you see
[29:59] remember the eyes is an outlet
[30:02] and it's a gateway to your soul
[30:06] so what you look at affects your life
[30:10] has impact on your life
[30:12] and the enemy knows that
[30:15] and is using it very much in this day
[30:17] that's true
[30:20] amen so you see our average and women
[30:23] and this one and this one and
[30:25] naked women and and and all kinds of
[30:28] adverts
[30:30] do you think he's there for without the
[30:31] purpose that is a purpose for it right
[30:34] there is a spirit behind it right that's
[30:37] right
[30:41] what you look at
[30:44] affect your life
[30:50] so
[30:52] keep your eyes
[30:54] on jesus
[30:58] the scripture we read from genesis speak
[31:00] to us
[31:02] about
[31:05] if
[31:06] our first mother
[31:11] the mother of all living amen
[31:15] and
[31:17] when the lord put them in the garden
[31:21] the garden of eden
[31:24] when god has created all things
[31:27] everything was so beautiful
[31:31] and god said this is good this is nice
[31:33] this is beautiful
[31:35] and then he brought his son and his wife
[31:39] into the garden
[31:41] the headquarters of the earth
[31:44] so stay here
[31:46] and then
[31:48] he instructed them and gave them his
[31:51] word
[31:53] and he said to them
[31:56] of all that is in this beautiful place
[31:59] the only thing i'm telling you eat of
[32:01] everything
[32:03] by the tree of knowledge of good and
[32:05] evil
[32:06] don't touch it let me tell you
[32:10] and then we were taught in the
[32:11] scriptures that the enemy came in
[32:14] and when he came in
[32:16] ah
[32:17] he
[32:18] he he just looked at the woman and he
[32:20] spoke to the woman and he said ah did
[32:23] god tell you to eat of every three that
[32:26] is in this place he said no that's not
[32:28] what goes through it he said we should
[32:30] eat of all but this particular thing
[32:32] which is the tree of knowledge of good
[32:34] and evil we shall not partake of it
[32:37] because god said
[32:40] the day we take it we shall die
[32:44] and the bible said
[32:47] when the woman saw the tree
[32:50] she saw the tree
[32:53] she looked at it
[32:56] that the tree was good for food
[32:59] and that it was pleasant to the eyes
[33:04] and a tree to be desired to make one
[33:06] wise she took it
[33:08] took up the fruit of it she saw that
[33:10] tree
[33:13] the prophet said that is where she made
[33:15] a mistake
[33:17] because she stopped to look
[33:19] she stopped to listen
[33:22] and that's where we all make our
[33:24] mistakes many of us
[33:27] we mess up our lives
[33:29] our experiences we mind it by just
[33:33] stopping and looking
[33:36] by turning our eyes from the lord amen
[33:39] right
[33:40] and we tend to reasoning
[33:44] and when she did
[33:47] she lost everything
[33:49] she was stripped off
[33:53] the glory of god departed
[33:59] what she thought she could get out of it
[34:01] she didn't even get it
[34:05] satan always present peaches before that
[34:07] right and he tells you you will get this
[34:10] and you'll be smart and you'll be this
[34:11] and you'll be dead
[34:15] so
[34:16] the enemy came to them
[34:18] and stripped them
[34:20] right by just looking stop and look
[34:28] so
[34:30] keep your eyes
[34:32] on the word of the lord
[34:36] because god and his word is the same
[34:41] in the beginning
[34:43] was the word
[34:44] the word was with god and the word was
[34:47] god
[34:48] a man and his word is the same
[34:52] so god and his word is the same amen
[34:56] keep your eyes on the lord in his word
[35:02] why he told them
[35:04] josh you have god speaking to joshua
[35:06] said don't deviate
[35:08] to the right or to the left
[35:10] right
[35:11] that which moses
[35:14] my servant has given to you
[35:17] don't move from the right
[35:19] don't go to the left that is
[35:22] don't put your interpretation to it
[35:25] don't try to find wisdom
[35:28] don't try don't add don't make it any
[35:31] better amen you cannot make it better
[35:34] right you cannot improve upon what god
[35:37] says
[35:38] you can't make it better
[35:40] god always gives the best
[35:43] and god's word does not need any mass
[35:47] interpretation
[35:49] you can make it better why are we in the
[35:52] condition we are in today because
[35:53] somebody thought it could make it better
[36:04] you cannot make it better right because
[36:06] god gives the best amen
[36:10] you are in a mess today
[36:12] we are in a mess today because we
[36:14] thought we can make it better we thought
[36:17] we can make it better we thought we know
[36:19] more than god we thought we had better
[36:21] idea but you don't get better ideas if
[36:24] you think of any better idea you are
[36:25] deceived
[36:27] right amen amen amen
[36:31] the whole world is deceived
[36:34] because they thought they can make
[36:35] something better
[36:37] than what god has given
[36:38] who are you to make anything better than
[36:40] what god has given amen
[36:44] are we together
[36:47] god always gives the best
[36:51] he is the creator
[36:53] he is the almighty
[36:55] he is the giver of life
[36:58] and he know what you need so we don't
[37:00] even know our needs
[37:04] we only want this and we want that we
[37:05] want that but he knows our needs
[37:08] he knows your needs and our peace
[37:12] is in obedience to his word
[37:17] amen
[37:18] you cannot disobey his word and have
[37:21] peace no man that ever disobeyed god's
[37:25] word has peace
[37:26] and that is why this world has no peace
[37:30] because the prince of peace has been
[37:32] rejected
[37:36] you can't disobey the word of the lord
[37:38] drinking does not satisfy womanizing
[37:41] will not satisfy nothing will bring you
[37:43] peace peace will only come when you
[37:45] receive jesus as your lord amen will you
[37:48] accept him as your savior
[37:50] will you obey his word that is when you
[37:52] have peace because jesus said my peace i
[37:55] give unto you amen not as the word gifts
[38:02] how can somebody run after somebody's
[38:04] wife and they have peace no way
[38:07] how can somebody commit adultery and has
[38:09] peace no way right how can somebody be
[38:12] drinking and smoking and
[38:14] womanizing and happiness no way
[38:17] it is just violent substitutes right
[38:20] it's true yes
[38:22] you can never have peace by disobeying
[38:25] the word of the lord
[38:26] and that is why this word is in a
[38:29] condition it is today because we thought
[38:32] we know better than god
[38:36] and the more we go into things the more
[38:38] we become confused
[38:41] so the word leaders and the word itself
[38:44] is confused
[38:46] that's why some people are confused they
[38:48] think that they have been trapped in a
[38:49] male's body or in the woman's body you
[38:52] are confused
[38:53] you are perfected you have lost your
[38:55] mind
[39:02] the word of god is perfect
[39:07] the word of god is forever settled in
[39:09] heaven
[39:10] you cannot add to the word or take us
[39:13] from the world and have peace
[39:20] that's why we are in the condition we
[39:22] are in today because in the beginning
[39:25] they thought they could act right now
[39:28] god said
[39:30] the day you eat of this tree
[39:33] you shall surely die
[39:36] and the enemy came and said you shall
[39:39] not
[39:41] surely die
[39:45] what happened
[39:47] what happened
[39:48] death
[39:51] for the witness of sin is death
[39:54] what is sin drinking is not sin
[39:57] smoking is not sin womanizing is not sin
[40:01] fighting and fasting and this sin is
[40:03] unbelief of god's word
[40:07] when you dis disbelief and disobey the
[40:10] word of the lord that's when you will
[40:12] drink
[40:13] that's when you will smoke
[40:15] that's when you will behave and do all
[40:16] kinds of because you have disbelief the
[40:18] way if you believe god's word you will
[40:20] not do it
[40:25] so when god created man and god put man
[40:28] here god gave instructions
[40:33] what man should do and what man should
[40:35] not do
[40:38] like i always said to people when you
[40:41] buy
[40:41] these
[40:43] machines here gadgets or whatever they
[40:45] are computers and whatever you have a
[40:47] book
[40:48] and they call it the manual
[40:51] they give you the manual a little
[40:53] booklet and they say read it
[40:55] before you operate the machine
[40:59] read it
[41:01] so
[41:02] the manual shows you
[41:05] what to fix here and what not to fix
[41:07] that right sure
[41:09] put this one there and and plug this
[41:11] block and put this where it gives you
[41:14] all the instructions right right
[41:17] if you don't follow the instructions
[41:20] you will not get your machines working
[41:22] correctly
[41:24] stabilizers and amplifier and this one
[41:27] and you know for the sound put this one
[41:30] there put it and it gives you guidance
[41:34] because the composer or the manufacturer
[41:37] or the inventor that invented wrote the
[41:40] book okay this is the way to go about
[41:41] this this is the way to do this
[41:43] and the creator of creation amen the
[41:47] creator of creation give us that book
[41:49] the manual that's the bible that is his
[41:52] word
[41:54] and it tells you
[41:55] men
[41:57] live this way
[41:58] women
[41:59] live this way
[42:00] children to this
[42:03] he gave us the manual
[42:05] the book of life
[42:07] the book of instruction
[42:09] and he said look if you want to have
[42:11] peace do this
[42:14] and as long as men obey his word we had
[42:19] peace on earth
[42:21] the day
[42:22] they disobeyed
[42:25] the word of the lord peace was taken out
[42:28] from the earth
[42:30] death was introduced right that's true
[42:33] disobedience to the word of god brings
[42:37] death
[42:40] that is why we are dying
[42:45] because
[42:46] men
[42:47] disobey the creator
[42:51] the manufacturer
[42:53] the designer the inventor
[42:58] and when we disappear him and man
[43:01] lost his way right it's true
[43:05] we lost our way
[43:07] we became stranger one dress
[43:10] because he was the man and the woman
[43:13] they were placed in the beautiful garden
[43:15] and they were everything was under their
[43:17] control and the sun and the music and
[43:19] everything but now when they disobey the
[43:23] word of almighty god they were driven
[43:25] out
[43:27] their choice took them out of their
[43:29] peace
[43:31] their choice they made to disobey the
[43:33] word of god took them out
[43:36] their protesting their defense
[43:39] everything that they had they lost it
[43:41] right
[43:43] that's true
[43:44] and that is why today
[43:45] men are wondering
[43:47] women are wondering
[43:49] we've lost our past
[43:51] we don't even know what is right again
[43:53] we lost our senses
[43:55] yes man man that's
[43:58] crazy
[44:00] wandering from place to place and so he
[44:02] think when i smoke i'll be happy
[44:05] when i drink i'll be
[44:06] happy when i i walk like a a
[44:10] hollywood star i'll be happy
[44:12] when i wear this kind of shoe i'll be
[44:13] happy
[44:16] so when god make you to be working like
[44:18] now you want to walk like this
[44:22] yes you're not happy you're not afraid
[44:25] right it's true because medically it's
[44:27] not even sound for you right it's true
[44:32] if you give back to your child and the
[44:33] child is like this you want to go to
[44:35] doctor
[44:38] whatever to do something about it
[44:40] praise the name of the lord amen well
[44:42] you might not like what i'm saying but
[44:44] i'm saying it because it's the truth i'm
[44:45] telling you
[44:48] hallelujah we lost our way
[44:51] so what is wrong we take it to be right
[44:56] and we take the wrong to be right and
[44:58] the right to be wrong

[45:05] can somebody take money and go and buy
[45:07] crazy jeans
[45:09] that is stolen here
[45:12] what do you talk about
[45:16] before then will anybody wear that kind
[45:19] of a paint jesus

[45:37] right

[45:40] insanity
[45:45] oh god have mercy upon us
[45:47] and help us as children of god to
[45:49] realize where we are and what is
[45:52] happening today
[45:53] so that we can take refuge
[45:56] under the cross
[45:57] amen right to the cross
[46:00] back to the word of the lord
[46:02] for that is where we got protection amen

[46:47] to get better
[46:49] it's going deep down down down down down
[46:56] praise the lord amen

[47:00] women used to dress before men go look
[47:03] go back into the back centuries and see
[47:05] the way people were dressing bring it to
[47:08] today
[47:09] it's different
[47:12] that's right
[47:15] the more civilized we become the more we
[47:18] lose his hope on god
[47:20] we are just going
[47:22] because we think all this will make us
[47:24] better this will make us happy we are
[47:26] not getting any better
[47:28] we are not getting any better

[48:51] condition no way america is not coming
[48:54] out right no nation is coming out
[48:57] the nations have crossed the line
[48:59] they've rejected god
[49:01] they've left god behind and they want to
[49:03] do their own things and once you leave
[49:06] god behind there is no way right so i've
[49:08] said to you young men and young women
[49:10] mothers and fathers husbands and wives
[49:12] parents get back to christ
[49:17] it is the word amen amen

[49:24] word was with god and the word was god
[49:25] and the word was made flesh and blood
[49:28] to give us life yes
[49:31] praise god
[49:35] may the lord help our sins of god
[49:37] and may the lord help each and every one
[49:38] of us
[49:40] in this crucial hour
[49:42] that we are living here
[49:46] look to god
[49:48] keep your eyes on him
[49:51] on the lord jesus christ
[49:53] don't turn your eyes from me amen
[49:56] the prophet of god said there are so
[49:58] many voices on the land today
[50:00] so many things that are calling for
[50:02] attention
[50:04] it's about the only voice that worth
[50:08] attending to is the voice of the spirit
[50:12] he that have an ear
[50:14] let him hear
[50:16] what the spirit is saying unto the
[50:19] churches

[50:23] in the book of isaiah
[50:25] that the lord god almighty speaking and
[50:28] he said

[51:16] deliverance look to me
[51:23] the creator

[51:26] and his creatures
[51:28] you didn't create me i created you
[51:31] you don't know more than me i know more
[51:33] than you

[51:40] how can you know more than the inventor
[51:42] somebody invented something how can you
[51:44] know more than

[51:49] creator right
[51:50] true who are you
[51:52] and who bone you
[51:56] do you think in yourself that you know
[51:57] more than the creator

[52:04] said god
[52:06] you don't need any laboratory tests or

[52:13] all about it
[52:15] and i pray lord any abnormality in my
[52:17] system will make it right
[52:20] that's right when the doctor should go
[52:22] do this and take your blood and do this
[52:24] that's all fine but god don't need that
[52:28] to work
[52:30] the doctor medical science needed but

[52:34] lord that he let all your diseases

[53:02] to this right side and the left side and
[53:04] to our neighbors and to this one and to
[53:07] that man and to that woman and god said
[53:10] now look to me
[53:17] oh it depends it depends on what you
[53:19] look at
[53:21] but if god makes a promise
[53:24] god is obligated to keep that promise no
[53:28] matter what the circumstance
[53:32] no matter what the circumstance
[53:34] god is able to keep his promise
[53:37] so look to me
[53:39] you know when we look around us we
[53:41] feared
[53:44] you remember the children of israel when
[53:45] god brought them out of egypt and they
[53:47] came to the promised land and then in
[53:50] the days of somewhere
[53:52] the children of israel came to somewhere
[53:55] and what did they say what was their
[53:56] request make us a king
[53:59] so that would be like the other nations
[54:02] they look at the other nations
[54:04] they look at the other people
[54:06] all these other church this other
[54:08] denomination this other this make us a
[54:10] king
[54:11] so that will be like that
[54:14] right
[54:15] so they despise god
[54:18] they rejected the path of god they
[54:20] rejected the word of god because the
[54:23] word of god was to lead them by the way
[54:25] of a prophet
[54:26] right it was true amen a prophet with a
[54:29] stick in his hands a wrought in his
[54:30] hands right
[54:32] who was leading it was somewhere the
[54:34] prophet
[54:35] when they were going to war somewhere
[54:36] when they were doing it somewhere when
[54:38] they needed somewhere the prophet was
[54:40] leading them because that is god's
[54:42] provided way surely the lord god will do
[54:45] nothing but reveal his secrets unto his
[54:48] servants the
[54:50] prophets but they despise the way of the
[54:53] lord sorry amen praise the lord
[54:56] hallelujah
[54:58] yeah i'm getting charged up now
[55:00] come on amen praise the lord amen what
[55:04] if you think i'm crazy that's okay
[55:09] you got to be crazy you know
[55:13] someone every one of us is crazy in some
[55:15] ways so it's all fine
[55:20] paul said the way that people call her
[55:21] you see that is the way i worship the
[55:23] god of my fathers
[55:25] so that's fellow is very strange oh yeah
[55:27] that you see that fellow strange but you
[55:28] don't know you're also strange
[55:30] there's something strange about
[55:32] everybody
[55:34] yeah you can see somebody said somebody
[55:36] has to tell you your own.
[55:41] praise the lord
[55:43] may god give us grace hallelujah
[55:46] they look around and they say oh i want
[55:48] to be like that one
[55:50] oh human beings
[55:52] we despise what we are right what god
[55:55] has made us we don't thank you for what
[55:57] he has given us oh but you want to be
[55:59] somebody else
[56:00] and you don't even know that somebody
[56:02] also wants to be like you
[56:04] right
[56:07] we are never satisfied
[56:09] but when you get christ
[56:12] the bible says
[56:13] godliness
[56:14] with contentment is a great game
[56:18] for we brought nothing into this life
[56:20] and we are not taking nothing with us
[56:21] [Music]
[56:24] godliness with contentment
[56:27] don't despise
[56:30] what god has given to you
[56:32] what god has made you that's right be
[56:34] thankful to god amen for what he has
[56:37] blessed you with
[56:39] that's right you see when you look at
[56:41] others you look at this one and this one
[56:44] before me and this one has more than me
[56:46] you will never be satisfied
[56:51] you will never be content
[56:54] because you are just looking here
[56:55] looking there and looking there when you
[56:58] should thank god
[57:00] for what he has blessed you with
[57:03] that's true
[57:07] make us a king
[57:09] how some people might be desiring to
[57:11] have a prophet to lead them
[57:14] to guide them
[57:15] you understand it
[57:17] in the days of elijah or elijah and the
[57:21] king the king of syria
[57:23] they gathered together
[57:25] anytime they plan to attack israel
[57:29] elijah reveres it
[57:31] like your elisha and he says don't go
[57:33] here don't go there because they are
[57:34] coming
[57:35] and so the king of syria called a
[57:37] cabinet meeting and he said
[57:40] which of you in this camp belong to
[57:43] israel who is sparing for his right
[57:46] who who is doing that either because
[57:48] anytime we plan to attack them and
[57:50] somehow they get to know
[57:52] who is doing that and one might say sir
[57:55] no no fashion
[57:57] he said right there they have a prophet
[57:59] there amen there is a man that has the
[58:02] script of the living god
[58:04] a prophet there
[58:06] and whatever you plant in your secret
[58:08] that must seize it amen
[58:11] and you reverse it what else do you want
[58:15] if you don't like this which one you
[58:17] like
[58:19] is the man that reveals our secrets to
[58:22] the man to the israelites
[58:24] oh really
[58:26] does anybody know where that man is oh
[58:28] yes that man is in duty
[58:30] okay you know where he said yes we do
[58:33] okay send a battalion go and bring the
[58:35] man
[58:36] you are not correct
[58:38] the man that knows and sees you in your
[58:41] bedroom
[58:43] and you are taught and everything you
[58:44] said that you got arrested won't you see
[58:46] it right
[58:51] because when you want to attack others
[58:53] you will tell them you are coming to
[58:54] attack what about when you are to attack
[58:56] yourself
[58:58] and they send the people to go and
[59:00] arrest elijah and then when they were
[59:02] coming a whole battalion
[59:05] and biasy the seventh of elijah when
[59:06] they woke up in the morning he saw that
[59:10] the whole place was packed
[59:11] with army and characters
[59:18] we are finished
[59:19] he said what is happening
[59:21] we are surrounded
[59:24] surrounded by he said look at the
[59:25] students around us
[59:27] don't worry about that
[59:29] did that happen us
[59:31] and more than they are
[59:33] amen saints
[59:35] don't die with us
[59:37] and more than those that are against
[59:38] amen
[59:40] for us who can be jesus
[59:45] the bible says the angels of god and
[59:47] come run about the righteousness
[59:50] i want to remind you and i want to
[59:51] declare to you and i want to say to you
[59:53] again that once we are here this morning
[59:55] there are thousands and thousands and
[59:57] thousands of angels right here
[1:00:01] the angels of god are yet
[1:00:03] left and kept running about us there is
[1:00:06] nothing to worry there is nothing to
[1:00:08] fear because the angels of god are here
[1:00:10] for and brother brown said
[1:00:12] they came with us to church
[1:00:14] and they go with us back home
[1:00:16] he said the angels of god they are
[1:00:18] always with us
[1:00:20] they are always around us
[1:00:22] or when we knew this we know about these
[1:00:24] things and we believe it it takes away
[1:00:26] fear and worry
[1:00:30] so elijah said
[1:00:33] i don't know what it does that i will
[1:00:34] first have more than
[1:00:36] he look around
[1:00:38] he has a look around
[1:00:42] i don't see anybody
[1:00:45] you might not see anybody but they are
[1:00:46] here
[1:00:48] you may not feel anybody but they are
[1:00:50] here
[1:00:51] because it's not our feeling
[1:00:53] it is not your feeling it's your belief
[1:00:57] it is the word
[1:00:58] what you believe the word or your
[1:01:00] feeling i want to believe the word
[1:01:03] that is god believe what god says
[1:01:06] believe what god says not your
[1:01:08] feelings hallelujah the word of god says
[1:01:11] i am with you i will not leave you and i
[1:01:14] will not forsake you
[1:01:17] believe the word of the lord keep your
[1:01:19] eyes on jesus
[1:01:21] keep your eyes on his promise stay with
[1:01:24] the promise it will never fail
[1:01:28] and
[1:01:29] like i said because the young man was
[1:01:31] troubled
[1:01:32] all these prophets
[1:01:35] he said that more people i don't see
[1:01:37] anybody too
[1:01:39] but you say there are people where are
[1:01:40] the people with us we are surrounded and
[1:01:43] i'm trying to say it and you are saying
[1:01:44] that there are people with us
[1:01:46] you can make some statement that i don't
[1:01:48] understand this prophet
[1:01:50] well you don't understand the prophet
[1:01:52] but they are prophets
[1:01:55] the word of the lord comes to them amen
[1:01:57] that's right
[1:01:58] and elijah spoke so what elijah did you
[1:02:01] have that your messiah lord have this
[1:02:02] young man
[1:02:04] open his eyes
[1:02:06] so that he will see what i'm talking

[1:05:44] when they are going to give when they
[1:05:46] get back to what they were looking at

[1:06:33] right in that street and their eyes is
[1:06:36] set on that street that jacob made and

[1:12:34] because you are what you eat
[1:12:39] what you look at
[1:12:40] what you feed on is what you become
[1:12:45] the food that you eat
[1:12:47] become part of you
[1:12:48] so you are what you are feeding on
[1:12:51] so what are you feeding on
[1:12:54] if we are feeding on god's word we
[1:12:56] expect it to grow
[1:12:58] stretch our ways
[1:13:00] and flop our ways
[1:13:02] and be courageous
[1:13:04] and be bold
[1:13:06] and stand for the word
[1:13:08] what are you feeding on blood of christ
[1:13:13] because
[1:13:14] flesh manner has been given to us a
[1:13:17] fresh manner the world has been open
[1:13:21] jesus christ the mighty god has been
[1:13:22] unveiled
[1:13:24] fit on the word amen read the word it's
[1:13:27] the word
[1:13:28] for in the book of revelation john was
[1:13:31] told
[1:13:33] take the book right

[1:30:02] because instead of looking to the
[1:30:04] promise they were looking at the
[1:30:05] amorites
[1:30:08] god said i am giving you the light i
[1:30:10] have given you the land

[1:30:44] many of the spies
[1:30:45] that went to spite the land came back
[1:30:49] ten of them
[1:30:50] and brought back
[1:30:52] bad report
[1:30:54] we can't do it
[1:30:58] it will destroy it will my
[1:31:01] are bigger than we are
[1:31:05] that's their report right
[1:31:07] they said it is a land that divorces
[1:31:09] inhabitants
[1:31:11] and in our own eyes
[1:31:18] they look at the obstacles
[1:31:20] they look at the giants they look at the
[1:31:22] problems
[1:31:23] oh look at this one and look at this one
[1:31:25] and look at look at the other brother

[1:31:42] why don't you look at the sister or the
[1:31:44] brother that is doing well amen
[1:31:48] why do you always want to put man
[1:31:51] focus on them on the negative right when
[1:31:55] there are positive things
[1:31:57] there are positive things in your wives
[1:31:59] and positive things in your husband and
[1:32:02] positive things in your wife and
[1:32:04] positive positive things in our children

[1:32:10] one why don't you look at the positive
[1:32:13] everyday negative
[1:32:15] and negative and negative and you become
[1:32:17] negative
[1:32:24] we can take the life look at this look
[1:32:25] at that age
[1:32:27] they were imprisoned
[1:32:29] by what they look at
[1:32:31] because look at this they are giants

[1:33:49] jesus said do you believe right even he
[1:33:51] said did you feel right

[1:38:00] and elisha kept his eye because in like
[1:38:02] that today what you have asked his bigot
[1:38:05] is hard
[1:38:07] but all the same if you can see me
[1:38:09] you'll get it

[1:38:15] don't be looking around please
[1:38:17] it is time to turn your face
[1:38:20] and turn your eyes
[1:38:22] on jesus
[1:38:23] amen he is
[1:38:25] our peace
[1:38:27] as i close let me say about peter
[1:38:30] jesus was walking on the water
[1:38:34] they thought it was a ghost
[1:38:36] they thought it was a spirit
[1:38:39] and he said don't be afraid it's me
[1:38:41] it's me don't be afraid please it's me
[1:38:45] then they were just family and peter
[1:38:47] said lord
[1:38:48] if it is you then let me also walk
[1:38:51] let me walk on the world don't be afraid
[1:38:53] to ask for big things amen amen
[1:38:57] if it is you
[1:38:58] let me walk on the water they have never
[1:39:00] seen anybody walking on water
[1:39:04] and jesus i am doing it he said like we
[1:39:06] also do
[1:39:08] the work that i do the weather i and you
[1:39:11] shall also do
[1:39:13] those who believe in me don't limit god
[1:39:16] keep your eyes on me amen
[1:39:19] we should not be afraid to ask god right
[1:39:21] if we ask him
[1:39:23] he wants to do it he will do it right
[1:39:25] but the problem says when god said no
[1:39:27] is no cease
[1:39:33] and belief
[1:39:34] not just ask and believe amen hallelujah
[1:39:38] praise the lord jesus
[1:39:40] peter said if it is you
[1:39:42] let me also walk
[1:39:45] jesus said kind
[1:39:49] you just step you are
[1:39:51] on the
[1:39:52] water and he started walking
[1:39:55] oh wow he was working
[1:40:00] he was walking until he came from jesus
[1:40:04] when he take his eyes from jesus
[1:40:07] and he began to look at the words
[1:40:11] he came to his side he began to rise
[1:40:13] what is it it begins to sink
[1:40:17] if you put your eyes you turn your eyes
[1:40:19] from jesus you will sing that is why
[1:40:21] many people are sinking today right it's
[1:40:24] true it's true
[1:40:25] in their work with christ they are
[1:40:27] sinking
[1:40:28] because they've missed their focus
[1:40:31] instead of keeping our eyes on him we
[1:40:33] want to read about this one we want to
[1:40:36] find fault to the prophet we want to
[1:40:37] find form with our wives we want to
[1:40:39] fight forward and so when you begin to
[1:40:41] do that equation
[1:40:43] it brings strives
[1:40:45] and then
[1:40:46] our work is mere man a
[1:40:51] you want to find out where the prophet
[1:40:53] made a mistake or what you mess yourself
[1:40:56] up
[1:40:58] what will you have done in the days of
[1:40:59] abraham when the man has told life
[1:41:02] and that don't lie
[1:41:04] you talk about me like the woman is not
[1:41:05] my wife it's my sister
[1:41:09] because the bible says he was a friend
[1:41:10] that will kill him
[1:41:12] so he says stop my wife tell them that
[1:41:15] you are not my wife
[1:41:16] tell them you are my sister
[1:41:19] i said i also say yes he's my brother
[1:41:21] and that's true
[1:41:24] but the grace of god came down
[1:41:27] before being like we touched sarah god
[1:41:29] said hey
[1:41:30] that woman is that man's wife he said no
[1:41:34] the woman told me that is the brother
[1:41:36] and the man also told me that i said i
[1:41:38] don't care what they told you
[1:41:41] that man is my prophet
[1:41:44] and that is his wife oh but your prophet
[1:41:46] he told lie hey
[1:41:49] god said
[1:41:50] give that woman back immediately to that
[1:41:52] man give the woman back
[1:41:54] if you don't
[1:41:56] i strike everything dead in your land
[1:41:59] for the sake of that man
[1:42:01] and more so let him pray for you
[1:42:06] because that is the only prayer i will
[1:42:08] hear
[1:42:09] the only one that will pray and i will
[1:42:11] hear an answer in that manner
[1:42:14] god wants you to have confidence in the
[1:42:16] prophet
[1:42:18] don't look at the shock coming
[1:42:21] don't look at anyone's mistake don't
[1:42:23] let's just stop that
[1:42:24] this one no no no stop it
[1:42:28] keep your eyes on jesus

[1:42:35] down but you know the wonderful story he

[1:43:01] with you
[1:43:03] and god bless you
