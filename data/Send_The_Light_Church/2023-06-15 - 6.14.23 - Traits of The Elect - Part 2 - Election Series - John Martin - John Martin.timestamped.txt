[15:51] her name is Mary amen
[15:55] halleluia I hope we all know that prayer
[15:58] changes things sometimes when you know
[16:01] you just tell a person that you're

[31:46] false prophets are lying God's truth

[31:54] God through this generation's first

[32:38] [Music]
[32:40] amen
[32:44] praise the Lord amen praise the Lord I I
[32:49] think that's a perfect song for us to
[32:51] get into our opening scripture in
[32:53] Matthew 24 I believe that the coming of
[32:57] the Lord is very soon amen
[32:59] amen
[33:02] we want to
[33:04] continue on basically a part two of a
[33:08] three-part series on election
[33:10] today
[33:11] and talk about the traits of the elect
[33:15] um
[33:16] you know there's
[33:17] I'm sure we've all wondered at one time
[33:20] or another
[33:21] whether we are elect how do you know who
[33:25] is elect
[33:26] what can the elect do what can't they
[33:31] not do I mean there's just questions
[33:33] about the elect of God
[33:37] um
[33:38] but I believe according to the
[33:39] scriptures that we can know what where
[33:42] the elect
[33:45] are standing with the scriptures what
[33:48] they are doing what they are not
[33:50] supposed to do according to the
[33:53] scripture so we can identify ourselves
[33:57] in the scriptures and we can identify
[33:59] the elect in the scriptures
[34:02] and if we line up with the scriptures
[34:04] then we know
[34:06] Who We Are
[34:08] amen because the Bible says that many
[34:11] will be deceived
[34:13] and and we don't want to be part of that
[34:15] group amen that's what I believe this
[34:17] this series is for let's look to the
[34:19] Lord in a word of prayer and then we'll
[34:21] read the scriptures Heavenly Father we
[34:23] thank you Lord for this opportunity to
[34:27] be in your house
[34:28] and Lord what a beautiful thought it is
[34:33] to reflect back
[34:35] on our lives at the time that you called
[34:40] us out of the world
[34:43] we go back to that time lord knowing it
[34:46] wasn't us just interested in something
[34:50] but it was you calling us
[34:52] to get right with you and to get our
[34:58] lives prepared in such a way that we
[35:01] could be part of
[35:03] the elect that bride without spot or
[35:07] without wrinkle and God lord from that
[35:10] time till today we have faltered we have
[35:13] failed we have come short of your glory
[35:15] and yet Lord you're holding on to us
[35:19] you're keeping us Lord in your you
[35:22] promised to see us through and we are so
[35:24] grateful to you
[35:26] Lord as we approach this subject we just
[35:29] pray that you'd open our hearts our
[35:31] understanding that you help us to see in
[35:34] the scriptures that the things that were
[35:36] Were Meant to see we pray that you would
[35:38] keep us from saying anything Lord that
[35:40] would bring any sort of confusion or any
[35:43] any anything wrong but I just pray that
[35:45] you bless the ministry of the word today
[35:48] bless the hearers of the word we commit
[35:50] the service to you now and give you
[35:52] praise in advance
[35:54] for we ask it all in Jesus Christ's name
[35:56] amen amen Matthew 24 starting with verse
[36:00] 11 of course it's talking about the end
[36:05] time and verse 11 says and many false
[36:08] prophets shall rise and shall deceive
[36:11] many didn't that we just sing that in
[36:13] that song
[36:14] and then dropping down to verse 21
[36:18] through 24 for then shall be Great
[36:21] Tribulation such as was not since the
[36:25] beginning of the world
[36:28] to this time nor ever shall be
[36:32] and except those days should be
[36:34] shortened there should be no flesh safe
[36:36] but for the elect's sake those days
[36:39] shall be shortened then if any man shall
[36:42] say unto you Lo here is Christ or there
[36:46] believe it not for there shall rise
[36:48] false Christ and false prophets and
[36:51] shall show great signs and wonders and
[36:53] so much as if it were possible they
[36:55] shall deceive the very elect
[36:59] amen God bless you you may be seated
[37:03] to think about there's a tribulation
[37:05] coming upon the planet
[37:08] that has never been or never will be and
[37:11] we can look back and know about all the
[37:13] wars and all the horrible thing
[37:15] dictators have done
[37:17] and terrible things but there's coming a
[37:21] tribulation that we've never experienced
[37:23] before
[37:25] I believe God is shaking
[37:29] is going to shake up things Hebrews 12
[37:32] verse 26 says
[37:34] whose voice then shook the Earth but now
[37:38] he have promised saying yet once more I
[37:41] shake not the Earth only but also heaven
[37:46] so God is shaking things up
[37:51] brother Brennan said in the message
[37:52] Revelation chapter 4
[37:55] he said that's what he does today the
[37:58] Holy Spirit comes to those who God has
[38:01] called there's a great shaking amongst
[38:05] the elect
[38:07] great powerful things going on but the
[38:09] but the world knows nothing of it
[38:13] right
[38:14] remember brother Brandon preached that
[38:16] message the invisible Union
[38:19] of uh the Earthly bride and the Heavenly
[38:23] bridegroom
[38:24] and so there there is a work that's
[38:28] being done in the elect and I believe
[38:30] they're getting ready
[38:32] I believe God is speaking to the elect
[38:35] and the bride is taking what's being
[38:37] said seriously applying it to their
[38:40] lives and by doing that they're making
[38:43] themselves ready
[38:45] and at the end they can Rejoice let's
[38:48] rejoice and be glad for the marriage of
[38:49] the Lamb has come for his wife have made
[38:51] herself ready
[38:54] now in part one we laid a little
[38:55] Foundation the word election means
[38:58] selected or Chosen and God is selected
[39:02] or chosen us before there was ever a
[39:06] World so it was in the mind of God that
[39:08] he chose us we were a part of him
[39:12] now he never chose this on the basis of
[39:16] ourselves we didn't have really anything
[39:18] to do with it in part three we're going
[39:21] to get into the scriptures declare it
[39:24] was on the basis of God's love for us
[39:27] that he chose us
[39:31] God knew that his elect
[39:34] bride
[39:37] would love the same way that he loves
[39:39] and they would remain in that love it's
[39:42] like a covenant
[39:43] oh the Lord just opened up some
[39:45] beautiful things and just be praying
[39:47] about part three but we want to talk
[39:50] about some of the some of the traits of
[39:52] the elect there's there's a lot of
[39:53] different ones
[39:55] but we know that the elect of God are
[39:57] scattered throughout the world
[39:59] and uh many of them don't even know
[40:03] their elect yet
[40:05] just think about when God came to you
[40:07] amen amen you didn't know you were elect
[40:10] right until you started hearing the word
[40:12] and you started boy
[40:15] there's something inside of me that just
[40:17] that knows this to be the truth and it
[40:20] your spirit bore witness with his spirit
[40:22] that that you are the children of God
[40:24] you're the elect of God
[40:26] okay
[40:27] now we brought out that one parent
[40:30] can have both the natural seed and the
[40:33] spiritual seed inside of him
[40:36] Abraham was a natural father of many
[40:39] nations but he was a spiritual father of
[40:42] one spiritual Nation
[40:44] and that spiritual Nation that's the
[40:46] elect of God
[40:47] yes sir they are the Seed of Abraham
[40:50] through the spiritual seed of faith and
[40:54] I know that sounds kind of deep but it's
[40:56] it's really not deep it's just you have
[40:59] to believe without
[41:01] seen
[41:03] you have to believe
[41:05] Abraham wanted to be wanted Ishmael to
[41:09] be really God's
[41:12] seed in which
[41:14] uh the spiritual seed would come forth
[41:18] uh but
[41:21] uh Abraham
[41:25] he didn't know he was if I could say at
[41:29] for a point was deceived and not really
[41:32] knowing that Isaac was the one that God
[41:37] that God wanted
[41:39] but Abraham wanted Israel to be a part
[41:41] of God's Everlasting Covenant and he
[41:43] said here in Genesis 17 18 and Abraham
[41:46] said unto God all that Ishmael might
[41:48] live before thee and God said Sarah thy
[41:51] wife shall bear be a son and thou shalt
[41:54] call his name Isaac and I will establish
[41:56] my Covenant with him for an Everlasting
[41:58] Covenant and with his seed after him now
[42:00] you've got to remember these these
[42:02] scriptures for part three and as for
[42:05] Ishmael I have heard thee
[42:08] behold I I have blessed him and and will
[42:11] make him fruitful and will multiply and
[42:14] make CND 12 princess shall he beget and
[42:16] I will make him a great nation
[42:19] amen remember he's now the natural seed
[42:23] but my Covenant this has nothing to do
[42:26] with you Abraham but my Covenant well I
[42:29] establish with Isaac
[42:31] which Sarah shall bear unto thee at the
[42:35] Set time uh in the next year
[42:40] so the son of the flesh
[42:43] was literally mocking the son of God's
[42:47] promise we know the story in Genesis
[42:49] chapter 21 and verse 10 says and Sarah
[42:53] said unto Abraham cast out this Bond
[42:57] woman and her son for the son
[43:01] of this Bond woman shall not be Heir
[43:04] with my son even with Isaac so there was
[43:07] a separation here
[43:10] and the thing was very Grievous in
[43:13] Abraham's sight because of his son he
[43:16] really really had a closeness with
[43:21] Ishmael and God said unto Abraham let it
[43:24] not be Grievous in thy sight because of
[43:26] the lad and because of the Bond woman
[43:28] and all that Sarah have said unto thee
[43:31] hearken unto her voice for in Isaac
[43:34] shall thy seed be called he had to
[43:37] remind Abraham again about the spiritual
[43:41] Covenant
[43:44] and also the son of the bound woman will
[43:47] I make a nation because he is thy seed
[43:50] now notice natural seed spiritual seed
[43:55] Abraham had two seeds one was natural
[43:58] one was spiritual the spiritual seed is
[44:01] the elect of God
[44:04] it's just all there is to it
[44:09] by faith
[44:10] by God's promise
[44:14] it's not the natural believer
[44:17] so a good trait a good trait is don't
[44:21] come into church don't read your Bible
[44:24] don't listen to tapes carnally
[44:29] right you have to
[44:30] you have to mean business with God I I
[44:33] God I am your spiritual seed not I am
[44:36] your natural seed I am your spiritual
[44:38] seed
[44:42] amen Abraham wanted the natural seed to
[44:45] be Heir but God wanted the spiritual
[44:47] seed to be here so we see here that
[44:48] there was a a point here where Abraham
[44:51] the father of our faith was not on the
[44:53] same page with God
[44:56] now Isaac he also had two seeds one was
[45:00] natural one was spiritual
[45:02] right the Bible tells us that
[45:05] uh Isaac loved Esau really wanted him to
[45:10] be the heir
[45:12] but he didn't realize God hated him
[45:17] God loved Jacob the supplanter
[45:22] he was willing to go to whatever
[45:24] extremes he had to get the birthright
[45:27] and I'll tell you I think God loves the
[45:30] believer who's willing to do everything
[45:31] he has to do to make sure he comes
[45:34] completely Born Again of the spirit of
[45:37] God
[45:39] he was the elect seed of God and I
[45:41] believe that when we become born again
[45:43] completely born again because there's
[45:45] many people who start right they get
[45:48] Justified they get Sanctified and they
[45:51] stop they don't go on to get the oil
[45:53] right they live good clean lives we call
[45:57] them good Christians but they don't go
[45:59] on to get the nature changed
[46:03] now there's no way that you and I can
[46:06] judge another person whether they are
[46:09] elect or not
[46:11] we want to make sure that we get that
[46:13] out there
[46:15] that's right no matter what but we can
[46:17] search the scriptures to clearly
[46:19] identify what are the traits of the
[46:23] elect and I believe we can do that
[46:27] now
[46:28] If Abraham would have stayed in that
[46:31] that place of
[46:34] no Ishmael is going to be the one
[46:39] well then see
[46:42] it would have proved
[46:45] that he wasn't elect
[46:48] he had to submit to the word
[46:50] the elect will always submit to the will
[46:53] of God
[46:54] amen you know they may fight they may
[46:56] walk in Disobedience or they may go down
[46:58] a wrong roll they may go down a pit they
[47:00] may do some wrong things but I am
[47:02] telling you if our righteous man falls
[47:03] seven times he'll get back up he'll keep
[47:05] going he'll get back on the right track
[47:07] because the elect cannot be deceived
[47:11] they can't
[47:12] maybe for a short season but eventually
[47:17] the spirit when he the spirit of Truth
[47:19] to come he will lead and guide you into
[47:21] all truth because we are just as much of
[47:24] God as God as he God can't be deceived
[47:26] amen
[47:28] so the natural seed is carnally minded
[47:33] now this is scary
[47:34] because we all have to operate right
[47:37] but we don't want to just come into
[47:38] church Carly minded we don't want to
[47:41] read the Bible currently we want to be
[47:43] spiritually minded
[47:44] so the natural seed
[47:46] are after the things of the flesh they
[47:51] mind the things of the flesh they're
[47:52] thinking about all the things of the
[47:55] flesh
[47:56] and the Bible says that they that are in
[47:58] the flesh cannot please God so the the
[48:01] two seeds the natural seed and the
[48:03] spiritual seed there's a separation
[48:05] remember Ishmael he was blessed
[48:09] naturally his mind was natural I mean
[48:13] they got all the oil they got the gold
[48:15] they had so much of the natural
[48:17] but the spiritual seed don't think like
[48:21] that
[48:22] they're spiritually minded
[48:25] they they're they remain dead to their
[48:28] flesh or to their will
[48:30] they are debtors not to the flesh to
[48:33] live after the flesh but they are led by
[48:36] the spirit of God to mortify the Deeds
[48:38] of their body amen
[48:40] amen now there's a difference between
[48:41] the spiritual seed and the natural seed
[48:44] God is always
[48:46] one other thing about the foundation
[48:48] we're still in the last lesser less
[48:52] service
[48:54] um
[48:54] God has always had a messenger to the
[48:57] elect for every age brother Branham
[48:59] shared that and William Branham was
[49:01] God's Vindicated messenger for this last
[49:05] age
[49:07] I feel sad about those who question and
[49:12] doubt and are are still looking
[49:17] thank God that he's revealed to us the
[49:21] messenger
[49:22] because if we don't know who the real
[49:25] message messenger is how are we ever
[49:27] going to know the real message
[49:31] we can't be picking and choosing God's
[49:34] message from 13 different people or 13
[49:38] different message 13 different preachers
[49:42] you know God is not the author of
[49:44] confusion
[49:46] amen he doesn't even have two Major
[49:48] Prophets on the scene at one time so
[49:51] there won't be confusion
[49:54] brother Brandon said even true ministers
[49:56] will misunderstand the messenger because
[50:00] so much has been called God's truth by
[50:05] deceivers
[50:07] notice there's people that are saying
[50:09] this is God's truth but it's not
[50:14] and that information that goes out there
[50:17] now gets in the minds of people and then
[50:21] they don't misunderstand it that they
[50:23] don't understand they misunderstand what
[50:25] the prophet meant when he said certain
[50:27] things in the message why women got to
[50:30] dress like this and act like this and
[50:31] why the men got to do this and and what
[50:34] they shouldn't do
[50:36] it's because you've got
[50:39] false
[50:41] teachers out there that are saying it's
[50:44] okay it doesn't matter what you do
[50:48] yeah and and that this brings
[50:51] a greater confusion right
[50:54] brother Brandon said the last messenger
[50:57] is sent to the elect which is God's word
[51:01] born bride so in this age this is the
[51:06] only age that the actual elect of God or
[51:09] the Bride of God become the full
[51:12] manifestation of the word we have
[51:14] something that that the other ages
[51:16] didn't have
[51:18] that's why brother random said not
[51:20] that's not the reason I don't know the
[51:21] reason but brother Brown said this is
[51:23] the greatest age that he would rather
[51:25] live in is this age
[51:28] the elect are the ones who receive the
[51:32] true interpretation of what the message
[51:36] is now this is important because there's
[51:39] a lot of people who are in the message
[51:44] but have not received the right
[51:46] interpretation of the message
[51:49] but they're calling it The Message
[51:52] and I love this this quote right here uh
[51:55] brother Brandon said the word
[51:58] Revelation because the elect will
[52:01] receive the prophet the revelation of
[52:03] the word this word revelation brings the
[52:05] elect of God out of the world and into a
[52:08] full Union with Jesus Christ now there's
[52:11] too many people who stop with just
[52:14] coming out of the denomination coming
[52:16] out of the world and saying I'm in the
[52:18] message and that's their interpretation
[52:21] of the message is not to be out there in
[52:23] the world but you've got to come into
[52:25] the full Union with the word amen
[52:28] [Music]
[52:29] because that's what's missing
[52:32] brother Brandon said in the message God
[52:34] called men he says but didn't God raise
[52:37] up he he the Nations to straighten out
[52:39] Israel in the days gone by
[52:41] yes he did the Bible claims that Russia
[52:44] and communism and communism is playing
[52:48] right into the hands of God to
[52:51] absolutely rid the Earth of the people
[52:56] but before that can take place the
[52:58] Rapture comes and takes the church home
[53:02] before that can take place and if that
[53:05] so close at hand how close is the
[53:08] rapture well you're always reading in
[53:11] the news about Russia
[53:13] and sometimes China
[53:16] says if it's so close at the hand how
[53:18] close is the rapture that's what we
[53:20] should they like should be looking at
[53:21] closer than that it's closer than that
[53:24] so you see why why I'm preaching the way
[53:28] I do he says why I'm struggling as hard
[53:32] as I can why God is everything that he
[53:36] can do to press that into the elect
[53:40] to draw the seed of that woman out so
[53:44] the seed of the serpent can be punished
[53:46] that's exactly right and that's what he
[53:49] has promised to do
[53:51] so we see that there was a real purpose
[53:55] a real heartfelt reason that brother
[53:58] Branham preached the message the way he
[54:01] did because he was trying to get the
[54:04] elect out
[54:06] so
[54:09] this world can be demolished and and we
[54:12] can move on with God
[54:16] it's awful quiet in here
[54:21] now everybody's not here so that means I
[54:24] want everybody to say Amen eight times
[54:28] more than you normally say huh
[54:32] all right
[54:35] so if a person
[54:37] is elected of God there's certain
[54:39] criterias that will take place and I
[54:41] want to look at some of these traits one
[54:43] of the traits I want to look at is that
[54:45] they cannot be deceived
[54:50] Isaac didn't know
[54:52] who God had elected with his children
[54:55] but Rebecca did
[54:58] right
[54:59] God came to Rebecca
[55:02] Sarah and Abraham didn't know who was
[55:04] elected for a season
[55:07] and just because a person is elected it
[55:09] doesn't mean they won't go through a
[55:12] season of being deceived now this is why
[55:14] we can never judge anybody that's true
[55:17] but eventually the holy spirit will lead
[55:20] and guide a person into all truth and if
[55:23] it doesn't happen the truth remains that
[55:26] there's they're in an area
[55:28] of deception right right it's it's a
[55:32] trait that we don't want to be in we
[55:34] don't ever want to be deceived I'll just
[55:35] say it like this if I'm doing something
[55:37] wrong please come and help me
[55:41] I don't want to miss it
[55:44] amen and maybe I'm just been too
[55:47] stubborn to hear God's voice speak to me
[55:50] about doing something and I'm just
[55:52] bullheaded
[55:53] well God will use his he'll use my
[55:57] brothers and sisters he will use
[55:59] somebody to come and shape me up
[56:02] because God don't want me to miss it he
[56:05] has an expected end for me yes sir it's
[56:07] not about I'm so special that I can just
[56:10] do whatever I feel to do and if I'm
[56:12] black God or show me personally no God
[56:14] don't always show me personally amen
[56:17] sometimes he's got to use somebody else
[56:21] in the message Ephesian Church age
[56:24] brother Brahm says only the elect will
[56:26] really know which is the true spirit
[56:32] the true Spirit notice
[56:36] only the elect will not be deceived
[56:41] I I tell you I I could see why brother
[56:44] bran says I'd rather have the right
[56:45] spirit and have the wrong Doctrine
[56:48] than to have their white right Doctrine
[56:50] and be wrong in my spirit
[56:53] now there's a group of foolish virgins
[56:56] who thought they were elected
[56:59] until they realized
[57:01] that something was missing in their
[57:03] lives
[57:05] and it was too late
[57:09] it was too late
[57:13] we know what that was that was the Holy
[57:15] Ghost but the question comes to all of
[57:17] us how do I know I have enough Holy
[57:19] Ghost
[57:23] I think it's a fair question
[57:25] I I think it's scary just to say I've
[57:28] got the Holy Ghost
[57:30] as if that that that's you're all taken
[57:32] care of
[57:33] how many people has said I've got the
[57:36] Holy Ghost and they're not even in the
[57:37] message anymore
[57:39] the Holy Ghost leads you into truth that
[57:41] don't lead you away from truth amen I
[57:44] don't want to say that we got enough
[57:45] Holy Ghost
[57:47] I want to say we need to have the
[57:49] attitude that Paul had and let's press
[57:51] towards the mark keep calling on God for
[57:54] more Holy Ghost
[57:55] amen
[57:57] there's a group in laodicea who think
[57:59] they're elected to make it but the Bible
[58:02] tells us that they're blinded to the
[58:04] fact that they need
[58:06] to buy deity
[58:09] they're blinded to the fact that they
[58:12] need deity which we know is God
[58:15] counsels them come by of me
[58:19] deity by of me my life trade your heart
[58:23] by you you buy this without money
[58:26] without price but you you give your
[58:28] heart you repent you say not my will
[58:30] Lord but thy will be done
[58:36] but how do they know how do people know
[58:39] how do we know that we got enough
[58:43] of God
[58:44] enough of deity enough of the Holy Ghost
[58:49] it's not a matter of just thinking that
[58:50] we're elected
[58:52] or just intellectual believing as the
[58:54] prophet said that we're elected
[58:57] it's a matter of us humbling ourselves
[58:59] to search the scriptures
[59:01] to find out are we lining up with what
[59:05] the elect do man that's what this little
[59:08] series is about and I hope you with me
[59:11] take this more serious than just come to
[59:13] church and hearing a sermon and and but
[59:16] but really trying to apply this
[59:20] and no matter how tripped up we get
[59:24] with something
[59:25] I want to say this
[59:27] to the elect God will see you through
[59:33] the elective God will not remain tripped
[59:37] up
[59:38] God will make sure to see us through now
[59:42] that gives us
[59:44] very much comfort to me
[59:46] [Music]
[59:48] but I still have to receive correction
[59:51] from my brother my sister I have to
[59:53] receive correction when I read the Bible
[59:55] I have to receive correction when I'm
[59:57] listening to tapes I can't just listen
[59:59] to the message and look for something
[1:00:01] that
[1:00:03] I got to be Lord what is it that you are
[1:00:06] trying to correct in my life
[1:00:08] because that's the job of the holy ghost
[1:00:11] season the job of the Holy Ghost is not
[1:00:13] to be an Aaron boy for us that's right
[1:00:16] amen
[1:00:17] all right trait number two the elect
[1:00:20] will not be deceived in remaining in a
[1:00:23] state of iniquity
[1:00:25] right amen
[1:00:27] are you with me on this
[1:00:31] our very lives
[1:00:33] were shaping into iniquity
[1:00:36] so at a very young age
[1:00:40] we learned
[1:00:43] that we could get away with a lot of
[1:00:45] stuff
[1:00:47] without doing the right thing
[1:00:50] we know iniquity is knowing to do the
[1:00:53] right thing
[1:00:54] but simply not discipline yourself to do
[1:00:57] it in other words you have the knowledge
[1:00:59] but you just choose not to do it right
[1:01:02] and I'll say today as this lukewarm
[1:01:05] Spirit just is getting stronger and
[1:01:08] stronger and stronger it's really what
[1:01:10] makes this age the hardest age it
[1:01:12] presses on the people that they don't
[1:01:14] have to do the right thing and you're
[1:01:17] still okay you're still going to be okay
[1:01:20] and that spirit is strong
[1:01:24] now a trait of the natural seed will be
[1:01:28] they will remain in iniquity
[1:01:31] they will remain there the natural seed
[1:01:33] will they'll never get away from it it
[1:01:36] becomes a part of their life
[1:01:38] in fact they they they they can still go
[1:01:43] on with God
[1:01:46] while it's there
[1:01:48] and and Matthew 7 verse 22 many will say
[1:01:52] to me in that day Lord Lord have we not
[1:01:55] prophesy in thy name and in thy name
[1:01:58] cast out devils and thy name done many
[1:01:59] wonderful works and then why profess
[1:02:01] unto them I never knew you'd depart from
[1:02:03] me ye that work iniquity
[1:02:07] so we see that this iniquity is actually
[1:02:10] in the church and if you think about it
[1:02:12] if you if we had time to go into
[1:02:14] scriptures we could see that Lucifer
[1:02:17] defiled the sanctuaries with his
[1:02:19] iniquity
[1:02:21] the actual sanctuaries of God people
[1:02:23] coming into church without the fear of
[1:02:25] God
[1:02:29] so many people are deceived away from
[1:02:31] the foundation of the word
[1:02:35] and they basically become foolish
[1:02:37] Builders they build their their house on
[1:02:40] the sand their their relationship with
[1:02:41] God on sinking saying right
[1:02:45] but look at the trait of the spiritual
[1:02:47] seed of God here in second Timothy
[1:02:49] chapter 2 verse 19. second Timothy
[1:02:52] chapter 2 verse 19 nevertheless the
[1:02:55] foundation of God stands sure having
[1:02:59] this seal can't be broken having this
[1:03:03] sealed the Lord knoweth them that are
[1:03:05] his
[1:03:06] amen praise God
[1:03:08] and so what is he telling his children
[1:03:10] now what is he telling those that are
[1:03:12] are his and let everyone that nameth
[1:03:17] the name of Christ depart from iniquity
[1:03:22] so this is this is not about proving I
[1:03:26] don't have iniquity in my life
[1:03:28] or proving how good I am this is about
[1:03:32] checking your life to see if there's
[1:03:34] anything there that you should be doing
[1:03:35] that God asked you to do
[1:03:39] right that's what it means to depart
[1:03:40] from it
[1:03:42] and the elect will depart from iniquity
[1:03:45] I'll say if it doesn't bother you to
[1:03:48] lollygag around
[1:03:54] us you're shown the trait that you're
[1:03:57] not elect
[1:03:59] that's all I want to say
[1:04:02] it should mean something to you
[1:04:05] to not be an iniquity
[1:04:09] I want to show signs of election the
[1:04:12] Bible says make your calling an election
[1:04:14] sure that means you can't just lollygag
[1:04:17] around in iniquity you can't allow those
[1:04:19] things in your life
[1:04:20] [Music]
[1:04:22] second Peter
[1:04:24] chapter 1 verse 9 says but he that
[1:04:26] lacketh these things is blind and cannot
[1:04:28] see a fire off if you're forgotten that
[1:04:30] he was purged from his old sins
[1:04:33] I don't think God wants us to forget
[1:04:36] that he purchased from our old SIDS you
[1:04:39] wherefore the rather brother and give
[1:04:42] diligence to make your calling election
[1:04:44] sure for if you do these things ye shall
[1:04:46] never fall
[1:04:49] now give diligence this is what this
[1:04:51] means give much attention use speed make
[1:04:56] effort be Earnest move forward Endeavor
[1:04:59] labor study now that's how we need to be
[1:05:04] about making sure about our calling in
[1:05:06] the leg but here's how laodicea look
[1:05:08] views this oh
[1:05:10] I know I'm elect
[1:05:12] I don't have I know
[1:05:14] I'm in need of nothing
[1:05:17] and it's it's they're not
[1:05:21] making effort they're not using speed
[1:05:23] they're not given much attention they
[1:05:25] just know
[1:05:27] and I tell you
[1:05:29] Paul knew but he still pressed towards
[1:05:32] the mark
[1:05:34] he never said I've attained he never
[1:05:37] expressed that he attained and even
[1:05:39] though he had Revelations that were so
[1:05:43] great that you you he could utter them
[1:05:47] but he never felt like he attained to
[1:05:49] the place where he was ready to go
[1:05:53] we're just dealing with spirits that
[1:05:55] want to you know get on us right
[1:06:01] now when we forget what God has done for
[1:06:04] us we tend to not feel indebted to him
[1:06:10] okay let me just just be a little bit
[1:06:13] carnal for a second let's say I did
[1:06:15] something
[1:06:16] to to brother Mark like I stepped on his
[1:06:19] foot
[1:06:21] and I come back to brother Mark and I
[1:06:23] say brother Mark I am sorry I stepped on
[1:06:25] your foot
[1:06:28] and brother Mark says
[1:06:30] well you shouldn't have done it
[1:06:33] I said will you just please forgive me
[1:06:35] brother Mark I didn't mean to step on
[1:06:37] your foot
[1:06:39] okay you need to be praying about it a
[1:06:41] little bit more Brother John
[1:06:43] and if he held that attitude all this
[1:06:46] time
[1:06:47] you know what I would feel I'm indebted
[1:06:51] to brother Mark
[1:06:53] because I'm always being reminded
[1:06:55] he hasn't forgiven me are you with me
[1:06:59] now Christ has forgiven us but he
[1:07:02] doesn't want us to forget what he's done
[1:07:05] for us
[1:07:06] amen and that's why
[1:07:09] every time we get on our knees and we
[1:07:11] say God forgive me for my sins today we
[1:07:13] should we should remember Calvary
[1:07:16] and what he's done for us and and then
[1:07:18] we feel indebted that we're going to get
[1:07:20] up and we're going to live for God that
[1:07:22] day and we're gonna we're gonna go win a
[1:07:24] soul for him today
[1:07:26] that indebtedness
[1:07:28] now when iniquity gets a hold of a
[1:07:30] person's life
[1:07:32] they begin to lose respect for the
[1:07:35] things of God
[1:07:36] true that's very true uh-huh
[1:07:40] iniquity can really bring about
[1:07:44] where our relationship is with God
[1:07:47] a person with a nickery will begin to
[1:07:50] show less and less respect
[1:07:53] for God's word
[1:08:02] necessarily do away with the word
[1:08:04] they just show less respect
[1:08:08] they just focus on the part of the word
[1:08:11] that benefits their life
[1:08:13] God this is your promise for me
[1:08:16] God you promise this God you said you'd
[1:08:20] wash your God you said you'd provide
[1:08:21] they focus on the part that just benefit
[1:08:24] them and they lose respect for doing the
[1:08:27] things that God commands
[1:08:30] but God's word is a two-edged sword
[1:08:33] it cuts down to the very intense amen of
[1:08:37] our hearts
[1:08:40] I want to get into this iniquity because
[1:08:44] I know Satan
[1:08:47] enough that he would like us to just not
[1:08:51] talk about this
[1:08:52] [Laughter]
[1:08:56] an example iniquity is present when a
[1:09:00] person starts coming to church and
[1:09:02] feeding on the word without fear and
[1:09:05] without respect
[1:09:07] they come into church and they begin to
[1:09:09] feed in the world and they don't have
[1:09:11] that reverence and respect you know
[1:09:14] iniquity is beginning to work in them
[1:09:17] and iniquity is sets in when a person
[1:09:21] will start caring less and less
[1:09:26] you know when you got saved you just
[1:09:27] loved everybody and you cared about
[1:09:29] everybody
[1:09:31] and after a while if you're not careful
[1:09:33] you can lose that
[1:09:36] Lucifer is our prime example of this he
[1:09:38] was perfect until iniquity was found in
[1:09:41] him
[1:09:42] or until he stopped caring about doing
[1:09:45] what he was supposed to be doing
[1:09:49] maybe he started getting up there and he
[1:09:51] started leading the worship but really
[1:09:54] in his heart as he was doing this he was
[1:09:56] wanting people to give him attention
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:10:01] and he couldn't wait to after the
[1:10:02] service was over because he was going to
[1:10:04] go talk to some more Angels hey would
[1:10:06] you like to follow me I'll let you do
[1:10:07] your own will
[1:10:09] are you with me
[1:10:12] Matthew 24 verse 11 says that many false
[1:10:14] prophets shall rise and shall deceive
[1:10:16] many and because iniquity shall abound
[1:10:20] the love of many shall wax code
[1:10:23] how many times have you had a thought
[1:10:26] when somebody didn't show you genuine
[1:10:29] love
[1:10:31] we're living in an hour I mean the whole
[1:10:33] world hates you know there's so much
[1:10:35] hate in the world it's just growing and
[1:10:36] growing and growing and growing
[1:10:38] well I know we're not in the world but
[1:10:40] the spirits are still trying to attack
[1:10:42] the church
[1:10:43] and we got to protect the church we got
[1:10:45] to protect one another
[1:10:47] Jude chapter 1 verse 10.
[1:10:50] but these speak evil of those things
[1:10:53] which they know not
[1:10:55] but what they know naturally as brute
[1:10:59] beast in those things they speak evil of
[1:11:01] corrupt themselves
[1:11:04] woe unto them for they've gone the way
[1:11:06] of Cain they ran greatly after the Arab
[1:11:08] Balaam for for reward and perished in
[1:11:11] the gang saying of Korah
[1:11:14] now Jude mentions three religious
[1:11:17] believers they all believe in God
[1:11:20] religious believers
[1:11:22] but they all have something in common
[1:11:25] they're selfish they're self-centered
[1:11:28] and what they wanted they wanted for
[1:11:29] themselves
[1:11:30] all three of these
[1:11:32] and there's a lot of believers who start
[1:11:35] out right but end up going the wrong way
[1:11:39] running greedily for their flesh
[1:11:41] spiritual perishing not naturally but
[1:11:44] spiritual perishing with their
[1:11:47] dispute that word gang saying means
[1:11:50] dispute
[1:11:51] contradiction strife and disobedience
[1:11:56] it's a spirit of just disputing
[1:11:58] contradiction strife and disobedience
[1:12:02] start out right but don't end up right
[1:12:05] now God views verse 12 these three
[1:12:08] religious Believers as spots
[1:12:12] in your Feast of love
[1:12:15] your feasts of charity
[1:12:18] when they Feast with you
[1:12:21] feeding themselves without
[1:12:25] fear so they're feeding on the word
[1:12:28] without respect to correction from the
[1:12:31] word and what stops that is the iniquity
[1:12:34] that's inside of them
[1:12:36] afraid
[1:12:39] they use the word for what benefits
[1:12:41] their flesh but ignoring the word that
[1:12:44] corrects their life and brings their
[1:12:45] character more into the image of Christ
[1:12:49] it's what it means to feed without the
[1:12:51] fear of the Lord
[1:12:52] spots these are spots in your Feast of
[1:12:56] Charity feeding themselves they are
[1:12:58] clouds
[1:13:00] they are clouds they are
[1:13:02] without water carried about the winds
[1:13:06] trees whose fruit wither without fruit
[1:13:09] twice dead plucked up by the roots
[1:13:13] Raging Waves of the sea foaming out of
[1:13:15] their mouth their own shame
[1:13:17] wandering Stars just going here and
[1:13:20] there to whom is reserved the Blackness
[1:13:24] of Darkness forever
[1:13:27] no Foundation
[1:13:32] the elect of God will not go to church
[1:13:36] without the fear of God
[1:13:40] amen we were just talking about the
[1:13:42] traits of the elect
[1:13:44] they will depart from all iniquity
[1:13:47] because the word declares that the elect
[1:13:51] will
[1:13:53] so we're just identifying what the elect
[1:13:55] do
[1:13:58] is we talked a little bit in in part one
[1:14:03] if we remember the elect go through a
[1:14:06] process of sanctification of the spirit
[1:14:09] unto obedience and the sprinkling of the
[1:14:12] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:14:13] so ah when you depart from iniquity you
[1:14:17] are going through a process of
[1:14:19] sanctification of the spirit
[1:14:21] unto obedience
[1:14:23] so they will depart from a state of
[1:14:26] iniquity nevertheless the foundation of
[1:14:27] God says sure having this yield the Lord
[1:14:29] knoweth them that it is and let everyone
[1:14:31] that nameth the name of Christ depart
[1:14:34] from iniquity
[1:14:38] we have that responsibility of not just
[1:14:41] rejoicing in Christ
[1:14:44] and using the name of Christ to cast out
[1:14:47] devils
[1:14:48] but we've got that responsibility to
[1:14:51] depart from the things that we're just
[1:14:53] allowing
[1:14:54] a disobedience in their life about
[1:14:56] something
[1:14:58] are you with me
[1:14:59] all right a third trait is the elect our
[1:15:04] faithful
[1:15:06] they are faithful Revelation 17 verse 14
[1:15:10] says these shall make war with the lamb
[1:15:14] and the lamb shall overcome them for he
[1:15:16] is the Lord of lords he is the king of
[1:15:18] kings and they that are with him are
[1:15:22] called and chosen and faithful
[1:15:29] the elect will be faithful you've got to
[1:15:33] get rid of these excuses of why we not
[1:15:36] going to read why we're not going to
[1:15:38] pray why we're not going to listen to
[1:15:39] this why we're not going to come to
[1:15:40] church why we're not going to live for
[1:15:42] others they're just excuses the elect
[1:15:44] will make excuses they are faithful
[1:15:48] brother Brennan said in the message what
[1:15:50] heareth thou Elijah he says see we're so
[1:15:53] prone to go after the gifts instead of
[1:15:57] The Giver
[1:15:58] when you see signs and wonders take
[1:16:01] place don't notice the signs so much but
[1:16:04] look what's behind it
[1:16:07] is that still Small Voice that speaks
[1:16:11] that's the reason we can't have revivals
[1:16:13] in America is because it's because
[1:16:15] people go after the gifts instead of The
[1:16:17] Giver
[1:16:18] that's what the matter with the world
[1:16:20] tonight oh we got uh we got if you want
[1:16:25] great crowds and audiences
[1:16:30] um you have to have a real classical
[1:16:32] Hollywood outfit with a lot of show
[1:16:37] American people want entertainment yes
[1:16:40] they don't want the true Gospel of the
[1:16:42] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:44] so therefore the radio and the TV
[1:16:47] television will give them more
[1:16:50] entertainment than the church can do it
[1:16:53] and they stay home
[1:16:55] all that comes out I want you to be
[1:16:58] blessed with this last sentence all of
[1:17:01] that come out is the elect of God that's
[1:17:05] still hungering and thirsting and
[1:17:07] calling and crying for the real thing of
[1:17:10] God Amen oh I love that quote
[1:17:14] Hebrews 10 verse 25 says not forsaking
[1:17:18] the assembling of ourselves together
[1:17:20] as the manner of some is but not the
[1:17:26] elect they're faithful but exhorting one
[1:17:30] another and so much the more as you see
[1:17:33] the day of protein
[1:17:35] uh-huh and then verse 38 now the just
[1:17:37] shall live by faith brother Mark but if
[1:17:41] any drawback my soul shall have no
[1:17:44] pleasure in him but we are not of them
[1:17:47] that draw back unto Perdition but we are
[1:17:50] them that believe to the saving of the
[1:17:54] Soul
[1:17:55] well brother John
[1:17:57] my soul's already saved
[1:18:01] yeah but my salvation is nearer than
[1:18:04] when I first believed
[1:18:06] today is the day of salvation so thank
[1:18:09] God that he saved us before but we
[1:18:12] we got so much more today and if we God
[1:18:16] gives us another day we'll have more to
[1:18:19] be saved from tomorrow
[1:18:21] he's building his character in us I
[1:18:24] believe today by the grace of God we are
[1:18:27] closer to God today than we were five
[1:18:29] years ago I believe that with all my
[1:18:32] heart
[1:18:33] another trait the elect will remain
[1:18:36] humble they will remain in their
[1:18:37] position they will suffer persecution
[1:18:40] but will never persecute others
[1:18:45] Lord help me to get through this
[1:18:47] now Saul persecuted the church when he
[1:18:51] was unconverted
[1:18:54] so he was the electors he didn't know
[1:18:57] and he certainly wasn't acting like
[1:18:58] elect
[1:19:00] so if you're elect and you're
[1:19:02] persecuting all I can say is you're
[1:19:04] unconverted
[1:19:10] but when he was converted
[1:19:12] he was persecuted
[1:19:14] but he never reviled back
[1:19:18] oh and if you got time you read second
[1:19:20] Corinthians chapter 11. it talks about
[1:19:22] many of his persecutions
[1:19:26] and you don't see in any of those that
[1:19:28] he fought back and he he said well I got
[1:19:30] my rights
[1:19:33] second Timothy chapter 3 verse 10 but
[1:19:35] thou has fully known my Doctrine and my
[1:19:39] manner of life my purpose my faith my
[1:19:40] long suffering my charity my patience
[1:19:42] persecutions and afflictions which came
[1:19:45] unto me not just at one place but
[1:19:48] Antioch Iconia lystra he said what
[1:19:51] persecutions I endured
[1:19:55] but out of them all the Lord delivered
[1:19:57] me
[1:20:00] he didn't deliver himself he didn't
[1:20:02] defend himself the Lord did it
[1:20:06] yea and all that will live Godly in
[1:20:08] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions
[1:20:13] but evil men and seducers are going to
[1:20:16] wax worse and worse deceiving and being
[1:20:19] deceived now notice this
[1:20:21] the world is going down the tubes
[1:20:25] I mean I cannot believe this this stuff
[1:20:28] about transgender when I went to school
[1:20:31] there was none of that stuff
[1:20:33] but it's getting worse and worse the
[1:20:35] scripture is being fulfilled
[1:20:38] in the midst of this evil world that
[1:20:41] we're living in God has a pride that's
[1:20:43] getting Holier
[1:20:45] getting pure get him more into His Image
[1:20:48] because they're not focusing on CNN
[1:20:51] right
[1:20:53] right they're focusing on
[1:20:57] g-o-d-w-o-r-d the word of God they're
[1:21:01] focusing on the message of the hour that
[1:21:03] God sent to get us ready
[1:21:06] second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 8.
[1:21:10] we are troubled on every side
[1:21:13] yet not distressed we're perplexed but
[1:21:16] not in despair
[1:21:18] persecuted but not forsaken God is with
[1:21:21] us he will not forsake us
[1:21:23] cast down but not destroyed always
[1:21:26] bearing now this is us this is I we
[1:21:29] don't persecute back
[1:21:32] always bearing about in our body the
[1:21:34] dying of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:37] that the life also of Jesus might be
[1:21:39] made manifest in our body
[1:21:41] for we which live are always delivered
[1:21:44] into the death of for Jesus sake that
[1:21:47] the life also of Jesus might be made
[1:21:50] manifest in our mortal thrush
[1:21:55] so that means I am going to respond to
[1:22:00] persecutions the same way that Jesus did
[1:22:03] amen
[1:22:04] can you say amen I want you to say Amen
[1:22:06] to the word First Peter chapter 2 verse
[1:22:09] 19 First Peter chapter 2 verse 19 for
[1:22:12] this is thankworthy if a man for
[1:22:14] conscience towards God endure grief
[1:22:17] suffering wrongfully
[1:22:20] you know you don't got to tell everybody
[1:22:24] that you're being wronged
[1:22:26] right you don't got to do that all the
[1:22:28] time
[1:22:30] it's think Worthy
[1:22:32] if you just endure it
[1:22:35] amen
[1:22:36] for what glory is it
[1:22:39] when ye be buffeted for your faults you
[1:22:42] shall take it patiently
[1:22:43] but if when you do well and suffer for
[1:22:47] it you take it patiently this is
[1:22:51] acceptable with God
[1:22:54] that must be that the other is not
[1:22:57] acceptable
[1:22:59] amen and he goes on to say for even here
[1:23:02] unto were you called how many feels like
[1:23:05] they're elect if okay if you're elect if
[1:23:08] you're chosen if you're pre
[1:23:10] you've been called
[1:23:13] okay so here and two were ye called
[1:23:15] because Christ also suffered for us
[1:23:17] leaving us an example that we should
[1:23:20] follow his steps
[1:23:23] now here's the steps because that's a
[1:23:25] it's a uh some like you know it's a
[1:23:27] colon who did no sin neither was guile
[1:23:31] found in his mouth
[1:23:33] who when he was reviled he reviled not
[1:23:37] again
[1:23:38] when he suffered he didn't threaten but
[1:23:41] he committed himself to him that judgeth
[1:23:44] righteously
[1:23:48] I believe the elect remained humble
[1:23:53] God gives more grace to the humble
[1:23:55] I believe that you like stay in their
[1:23:58] position they stay in the word this is
[1:24:00] what the word says you don't rely back
[1:24:02] you don't talk back you just endure it
[1:24:05] with patience amen
[1:24:08] how many love the word
[1:24:11] all right
[1:24:12] now
[1:24:14] Galatians 4. turn with me to Galatians 4
[1:24:17] the elect suffer persecution but they
[1:24:20] never persecute others
[1:24:25] for it is written verse 22
[1:24:29] Galatians 4 22 for it is written that
[1:24:31] Abraham had two sons the one by the Bond
[1:24:35] woman the other by the free woman
[1:24:38] verse 28 now we Brethren as Isaac was
[1:24:42] are the children of Promise amen the
[1:24:46] elect right
[1:24:47] but as then he that was born after the
[1:24:51] flesh
[1:24:53] persecuted him that was born after the
[1:24:55] spirit even so it is now
[1:25:07] no matter how much we suffer persecution
[1:25:10] we will never persecute back remember
[1:25:15] that the elect don't do that
[1:25:18] brother Brian said in the laodicean
[1:25:20] churches it says elect cannot persecute
[1:25:22] light
[1:25:23] elect cannot harm elect
[1:25:26] it is the reprobates that persecute and
[1:25:30] destroy the elect
[1:25:32] they hate this true seed and they would
[1:25:35] do all they can in the name of the Lord
[1:25:38] to destroy
[1:25:40] God's elected ones
[1:25:45] we just you know we just got to trust
[1:25:47] God
[1:25:48] we just got to trust God
[1:25:50] God has got the final say so Vengeance
[1:25:53] belongs to God you know we didn't create
[1:25:56] them you know I understand they
[1:25:58] shouldn't be persecuting us but look if
[1:26:01] they did it to the if they did it to the
[1:26:04] uh they did to Jesus they'll do it to us
[1:26:07] if they if they did it to the ripened
[1:26:09] tree how much more they do it to the
[1:26:10] green tree
[1:26:11] right it's going to happen we can't get
[1:26:13] if you're gonna if you're gonna live
[1:26:14] Godly Satan hates you
[1:26:17] he's going to send somebody to try to
[1:26:19] destroy you but that doesn't give you a
[1:26:21] right to ever persecute anybody amen
[1:26:24] amen if you do your mouths are just put
[1:26:27] up a sign I'm showing the trait and I'm
[1:26:30] not elect
[1:26:34] I'm just we need things to motivate Us
[1:26:37] in the in the right direction
[1:26:39] not judging not pointing fingers I'm
[1:26:42] just saying here's the target let's go
[1:26:43] towards the target
[1:26:46] now another trade is that their purpose
[1:26:50] The Lex purpose becomes the same purpose
[1:26:53] of God
[1:26:56] which is to get all his family together
[1:27:00] I mean we just got to get out of this
[1:27:02] world Jesus said I'm not of this world
[1:27:04] I don't I don't pray for them that
[1:27:06] you'll take them out of the world I just
[1:27:07] pray that you'll you'll you'll you'll
[1:27:09] you'll keep them hearing that they
[1:27:11] they'll be one with me and they will do
[1:27:14] what I call them to do which is go into
[1:27:16] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:27:18] every creature
[1:27:20] get the law seeds be Fishers of Men get
[1:27:23] this get them safe so we can get ready
[1:27:25] to get out of here
[1:27:28] the focus of the elect is the Salvation
[1:27:33] of Souls
[1:27:37] the focus of the elect is the Salvation
[1:27:40] of cells no matter how hard the trials
[1:27:42] get
[1:27:44] that is their focus they need to stay
[1:27:46] focused second Timothy chapter 2 verse
[1:27:49] 10 second Timothy chapter 2 verse 10 if
[1:27:51] you want to write it there therefore I
[1:27:53] Endure all things
[1:27:56] for the elect's sake
[1:27:59] that they may also obtain salvation
[1:28:02] which is in Christ Jesus with eternal
[1:28:04] glory
[1:28:07] I Endure all things I'm willing to go
[1:28:11] through all the persecution I'm willing
[1:28:12] to do everything I got to do for the
[1:28:14] elect's sake somebody has got to see
[1:28:17] Jesus Christ in you somebody has got to
[1:28:20] see the Living Word today that he is the
[1:28:22] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:28:25] sometimes you got to go through a lot of
[1:28:27] stuff and just be as sweet
[1:28:31] just be full of Christ amen don't ever
[1:28:35] get discouraged when you're suffering
[1:28:40] this is what
[1:28:42] Jesus said
[1:28:44] about Saul in Acts 9 15 but the Lord
[1:28:48] said unto him go thy way for he is a
[1:28:51] chosen vessel unto me
[1:28:54] the illah now to Bear my name before the
[1:28:57] Gentiles and the Kings and the children
[1:28:58] of Israel for I will show him how great
[1:29:01] things he must suffer for my name's sake
[1:29:05] now you ever go up to somebody and say
[1:29:07] hey can we can you do me a favor would
[1:29:10] you do something for me and they say
[1:29:12] well it depends
[1:29:15] it really depends on what it is you tell
[1:29:17] me first and then I'll tell you
[1:29:20] well
[1:29:21] if God has called you to do something it
[1:29:24] would be an honor to suffer for him
[1:29:29] you don't find any Scripture that that
[1:29:31] Paul says no I don't want to I don't
[1:29:34] want to do this
[1:29:39] you you you hear him glory in in his
[1:29:43] infirmities
[1:29:44] you you it was an honor for him
[1:29:48] when he's shown his credentials against
[1:29:50] other ministers he wasn't talking about
[1:29:52] how many people he baptized he was
[1:29:55] talking about one of the things that he
[1:29:56] suffered for the Lord
[1:29:59] and I'll tell you as the elect of God if
[1:30:01] you're willing to just suffer to help
[1:30:04] somebody I'm telling you you're showing
[1:30:06] traits of the elect today
[1:30:09] second Timothy chapter 2 verse 11.
[1:30:12] second Timothy chapter 2 verse 11 it is
[1:30:15] a faithful saying for if we be dead with
[1:30:18] him
[1:30:19] we shall also live with him
[1:30:21] and if we suffer we shall also reign
[1:30:24] with him
[1:30:25] isn't that beautiful the bride with the
[1:30:27] bridegroom if we suffer we shall reign
[1:30:30] with him if we deny him he will also
[1:30:33] deny us
[1:30:36] so the elect won't deny him
[1:30:40] but the foolish virgins he denied
[1:30:45] because they were unwilling
[1:30:49] to go get the deity the goal that was
[1:30:52] tried in the fire that was that could go
[1:30:54] through the test and still be okay with
[1:30:57] it
[1:30:58] now verse 13 if we believe not yet he
[1:31:03] abideth faithful
[1:31:04] he cannot deny himself I'll tell you why
[1:31:07] I love this scripture No Brother Bruce
[1:31:09] loves this scripture
[1:31:13] we are part of God
[1:31:17] knows that we're frail there's a human
[1:31:19] part there's there's a development
[1:31:21] there's a we're still in the process of
[1:31:24] becoming completely born again
[1:31:26] completely manifested and there's times
[1:31:29] that we're going to deny the truth and
[1:31:31] deny him but he cannot deny himself he
[1:31:35] cannot deny the seed that's within us
[1:31:37] and he will lead and guide us out of
[1:31:40] that that deception into the truth
[1:31:44] can I talk about one more
[1:31:50] the elect
[1:31:52] are the only ones who overcome
[1:31:54] everything
[1:31:56] they're the only ones that overcome
[1:31:58] everything like Joshua and Caleb
[1:32:01] it is because they had another spirit
[1:32:03] and I'll tell you when we get
[1:32:05] enough of God's spirit
[1:32:07] will overcome everything
[1:32:09] I mean if Jesus said if somebody slaps
[1:32:11] you in a faith you turn the other one
[1:32:14] it's let me ask you to go a mile you go
[1:32:15] too
[1:32:17] well our flesh don't want to do that I
[1:32:19] ain't got time to do that I got time to
[1:32:21] you know you're not going to hit me
[1:32:25] the thing is that's our spirit now
[1:32:29] when Christ's spirit is inside of us
[1:32:32] it's a complete you don't even have a
[1:32:34] life anymore you can go two or three
[1:32:35] miles right because
[1:32:40] you already gave up your life to be
[1:32:42] married to Jesus
[1:32:44] to be his elect lady amen
[1:32:49] but the church needs to overcome all
[1:32:52] things today is faith in the word of God
[1:32:58] it's that simple you want to overcome
[1:33:00] every situation just believe the word
[1:33:04] believe the word now we've we've talked
[1:33:07] about a number of things today and I'm
[1:33:08] sure we've all had struggles with some
[1:33:11] of them but if you just have faith in
[1:33:13] that word that that's the example that
[1:33:15] you're supposed to follow you're
[1:33:16] supposed to follow his footsteps if you
[1:33:18] just have faith in that word you will
[1:33:20] overcome your situation
[1:33:22] [Music]
[1:33:24] first John chapter 5 verse 4 says and
[1:33:27] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:33:29] world even our faith
[1:33:34] if you're not operating your life by
[1:33:36] faith you're most likely operating by
[1:33:40] fear
[1:33:42] the natural seed
[1:33:47] will not murmur
[1:33:49] I'm sorry the natural seed will murmur
[1:33:52] and they will complain to the cows come
[1:33:54] home
[1:33:55] and it's usually because of fear they're
[1:33:58] fearing a situation so they have to
[1:34:00] manipulate they have to get involved and
[1:34:02] they they have to get their flesh
[1:34:04] working their own ways
[1:34:08] and if
[1:34:10] I tell you
[1:34:11] nobody
[1:34:15] wants to see their flesh suffer
[1:34:18] but when you're in the flesh and you're
[1:34:21] being carnal constantly you're going to
[1:34:24] find yourself murmuring and complaining
[1:34:28] but that is not a trait of the elect
[1:34:31] believers who murmur and complain often
[1:34:34] don't realize but they're motivated by a
[1:34:37] spirit of fear
[1:34:39] now I I could say Amen a thousand times
[1:34:43] to that statement
[1:34:44] they're not trusting God
[1:34:48] the Bible says God has not given us a
[1:34:50] spirit of fear but a power love and of a
[1:34:53] sound mind
[1:34:54] we can trust God through this situation
[1:34:58] now the elect overcome everything and
[1:35:00] they would do it without murmuring
[1:35:03] complain
[1:35:05] Philippians 2 13 for it is God which
[1:35:08] worketh inside of you
[1:35:12] to both
[1:35:14] to Will
[1:35:17] and
[1:35:18] to do of his good pleasure so is God
[1:35:21] willing your heart he's telling you what
[1:35:24] he wants you to do he's working inside
[1:35:26] of you and then through three or more
[1:35:29] agency you say yes and you do his good
[1:35:33] pleasure
[1:35:35] and he says do it do all things without
[1:35:38] murmurings and disputings
[1:35:41] that you may be blameless and harmless
[1:35:46] the sons of God without rebuke in the
[1:35:49] midst of a crooked and perverse Nation
[1:35:51] among whom you shine is lights in the
[1:35:54] world
[1:35:56] Revelation 3 21.
[1:35:59] to him that overcometh well I grant to
[1:36:02] sit with me
[1:36:03] in my throne even as I overcame and sat
[1:36:06] down with my father in his throne
[1:36:09] the Overcomers of each age are the elect
[1:36:13] for that age
[1:36:15] and the elect will hold their beginning
[1:36:18] confidence steadfast to the end they are
[1:36:22] they're just going to be Overcomers and
[1:36:24] not theirselves not their ability not
[1:36:26] their wisdom not not their not
[1:36:29] themselves but they have a an
[1:36:32] undying trust in almighty God that God
[1:36:36] will make a way for them
[1:36:38] Revelations 21 verse 7 8 these are my
[1:36:41] last two scriptures here Revelations 21
[1:36:43] verse 7 and 8 he that overcometh shall
[1:36:46] inherit all things
[1:36:48] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[1:36:53] son
[1:36:55] you got to overcome
[1:36:57] you've got to overcome but the fearful
[1:37:01] and the unbelieving
[1:37:04] and the abdominal the murders and
[1:37:06] whoremongers and Sorcerers and idolaters
[1:37:08] and all liars shall have their part in
[1:37:10] the Lake of Fire which burneth with fire
[1:37:13] and brimstone which is the second death
[1:37:18] now according to the scriptures
[1:37:20] everyone's a liar right except God
[1:37:25] that means we have to work very hard to
[1:37:29] get every trace of it out of us
[1:37:33] I say don't stop as long as you've got
[1:37:36] strength and and breath and health you
[1:37:40] make sure you're doing everything you
[1:37:42] can to stay true blue to God
[1:37:45] because Satan's always trying to trip us
[1:37:47] up doesn't he amen let's Stand Together
[1:37:50] God bless you
[1:37:54] just some traits
[1:37:56] of the elect
[1:38:00] some things that we can always go back
[1:38:02] and just check on am I doing these
[1:38:05] things
[1:38:06] I believe
[1:38:08] I believe that's always pleasing to the
[1:38:10] Lord to do check up and you know brother
[1:38:12] random I can never forget brother
[1:38:15] Branham said that he
[1:38:19] I don't know if he used the word often
[1:38:22] but I thought it was often
[1:38:25] that he would rededicate himself to the
[1:38:27] Lord
[1:38:29] and he didn't have the attitude once is
[1:38:32] enough you know he just always doing
[1:38:34] checkup and he taught us to turn over
[1:38:36] every Rock to check her Motors check our
[1:38:38] objectives
[1:38:40] and and just make sure that we're
[1:38:43] pleasing him because the elect is the
[1:38:46] only ones that please the Lord all the
[1:38:48] way

[1:38:53] of Prayer
