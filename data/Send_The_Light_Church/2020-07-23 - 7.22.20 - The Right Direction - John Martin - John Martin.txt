TRANSCRIPT
========================================
over my soul sweep over my soul sweet spirit sweep over my soul my wrath is complete while i sit at your feet sweet spirit sweep over my soul one more time sweep over my soul sweep over my soul sweet spirit just sweep over my soul my rest is complete while i rest at your feet sweet spirit sweep over my soul amen is that your desire amen amen let's take that before the lord as we pray heavenly father lord we've we've spent some time praying before service we've many of us have spent time during the day praying for the service lord we've sung the songs we've expressed our desire and lord just before we enter into this word that you have prepared for us lord we want you to sweep over our soul we want our heart prepared we want that word to fall on a good ground and lord we want to not only be at peace with the word father but we want to be at peace with all the things that you're bringing to us lord the things that you're wanting us to do lord we know that you have a direction for our lives and father we pray that you would bring revelation to all of our hearts you bring a direction to us that we didn't have before we came you'd increase our faith lord give us a a greater faith a greater revelation lord than what we had before we come and lord may you use this service to accomplish your good will in our lives and lord what you purpose for us we commit ourself into your hands lord we yield ourselves to you we give ourselves unreservedly into your hands might you receive glory and honor as we receive your word for we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen amen praise the lord turn with me if you would to the book of saint matthew chapter seven you know i'm so glad that we can have just as great as service without orchestra or stained glass windows or the choir entertainment or the best preacher in the whole world because we have the best god in the whole world with us amen and he has condensated to men of low estate he has not forgotten his bride amen amen matthew chapter 7 verse number 13 and 14 we'll have you be seated after we read these entry ye in at the straight gate for white is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in there at because straight is the gate narrows the way which leads unto life and few there be that find it amen god bless you may be seated we want of a couple more scriptures we want to read before we uh tell you what the name of the service is is about but here in this opening scripture here jesus is describing two ways and if i could say it like this when you first start out these two ways could look almost exactly the same no not did not jesus say the last days those two spirits would be so close that you couldn't you couldn't hardly tell the the difference unless you were his elect and somehow the truth gets to the elect that's right so when you start out uh in in this this broad way that leads to destruction it's kind of like a y and it just slightly veers and then after a while this road will take you in the opposite direction it'll take an opposite direction and we don't want that because it's the wrong direction we want to entitle this the right direction today and for a subject uh we want to check which direction our thoughts are going because usually our thoughts uh precede the direction that we end up going proverbs chapter 14 verse 12 said there is a way which seemeth right until man but the end thereof are the ways of death so if there's a way that seemeth right but it ends up being wrong there must be a way that seemeth wrong to a man but it ends up being the way of life and brother branham could say it like this that way is living for others or or or it's a perfect love without respect to persons and and that just seems um so wrong to the carnal man because you know we've only got so much time we've got to live for ourselves and you know we're going to choose who we're going to love and who we're not going to love either way it doesn't seem like man really thinks it's necessary to live for others because he has a chance every day to do it and he finds choices that he'd rather do what he wants to do first corinthians chapter 2 verse 14 says the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for their foolishness on him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned so there is a way that seemeth right unto man but the end there are the ways of death so this is very critical to understand is we're trying to figure out the right directions for our life because there's a part of us that isn't connected to god and it thinks this way is the right way and the part that's connected to god says it's this way well just depending on what you're doing that day is going to determine a lot of the direction that we're going to end up going well jesus said in 4 in chapter 14 of saint john verse 6 i am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me so we have to go through jesus to make it to eternal life now as we get into this when we're thinking about the right direction there's different ways that we can view this right direction a lot of times we're thinking that we're in the right direction uh uh if it's about something we want to do someplace we want to go something we want to buy and we're looking for the right direction in that but then there is something that we don't think about that we need to be concerned about the right direction and that is the things that god is thinking about us in other words the things that he wants us to do the places he wants us to go the things he wants us to buy or give to others live for others and then there's things that we spend little time thinking about and these are the things that brother josiah talked about last service and that's what we're doing from the original time that he's he's called us to the time we're making the rapture what's going on in this area this character building that there's a right direction for that and of course the the harder way is the right way that's the way that character is built but the way that seemeth right unto man is the easier path that we don't really necessarily need to have to suffer and we're still going to make it in and that's just simply the the attitude and the thought process that the children of israel had when they came out of when they came out of egypt and there is a picture i wanted to show you right now this is a picture on i-75 and you probably all have seen the picture and it's a picture of jesus and uh underneath it it says are you on the right road and it was what i liked about it it's a thought-provoking picture that's what we want to do is we want to provoke our thoughts instead of just assuming that we're all on the right road we're all going the right direction it's a good question and i think we would all anonymously like to say yes i am on the right road i am going in the right direction thank you let's go on to the next subject i think that's really part of the the problem we could start off right and very easily take a slight detour thinking that we're still heading in the right direction because there is a way that seemeth right unto man but the end is the wrong direction and every man is right in his own eyes he thinks he's heading in the right direction that's how every one of us think who is going to actually stand up here and say brother john i really don't know if i'm going in the right direction but to be honest with you that should be all of our all of us because brother brown says we come here to find out where we're at with god but too often we feel we have really have things handled now there's another thing to consider in this you could be on the right road but heading in the wrong direction just like taking the oars out of the water i mean end up going the wrong direction of what you were ordered with so some examples of this i wrote down is the saints in the first church age ephesus jesus said that they labored for jesus's namesake and god recognized their works and their patience and that they didn't faint through their trials but he said in revelations chapter 2 verse 4 nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love they ended up heading in the wrong direction the right direction was their first love then they ended up going in a wrong direction and when you leave off from something that god once had told you to do when you when you leave off that you're heading in the wrong direction now what we should be really be interested in is what is god's true direction for our life what is he interested in it would not matter if i had 15 trusted tools if i had 15 cars if i had 15 houses 15 bolts 15 motorcycles but he is definitely interested in seeing his image inside of me so the direction that we really want to focus on is are we on the right path to developing our character how do we know we're on that right path have we left something out are we just going through the motions verse 5 remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do thy first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and i will remove thy candlestick out of its place except thou repent now notice this church they were still going to church but they were backslidden still going through the motions still coming but no vision no burden no love constraining them to do anything more than what they were just doing so we can start out right and end up drifting just a little bit remember the children of israel they started out in the right direction but they decided to take the why in the role they wanted the easier path one without persecution with one without suffering they wanted the easier way so they started out right they rejoiced they could always go back and say god delivered me but they had a hard time saying he's the same yesterday today and forever so they wanted a form of godliness i'm still going to serve god i'm just going to do it my way the french sinatra way look at the rich young ruler he started out in the right direction i kept all these from my youth up but he took a y for the money the right direction was to share what god had given them that's what jesus told them to do share it with others and then you come and follow me now that was the right direction jude chapter one verse three now i say chapter one because it is a chapter just because there's no two doesn't mean one's a chapter right i got a revelation on that so i'm sticking right with it when i gave all diligence to write unto you the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints a lot of believers have gotten off the straight and narrow gotten off the living by faith kind of taking on a natural approach a more intellectual walk with the lord but we must stay the course we must contend for that faith amen we must fight the good fight we must finish this course we must finish this race that's the right direction is to continue on last service we were reminded about the believers standing still on the right road he said what are we doing in this time i mean just because the whole world quarantined or are we quarantined the rapture are we is the bride being quarantined i mean we're still sending out just as much money in missions as we were before we got to find a way to to reach still gotta to win souls you still gotta move on for christ we must remember church that god is persuaded better things of us the things that accompany the bride they're an elite god doesn't choose everybody to be his bride he's choosing a certain group now it's not we should brag about but it's something we should live higher for live live something that's greater hebrews chapter 6 verse 9 for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which ye have shown towards his name in that ye minister to the saints and do minister and we desire that every one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end well you know what i'm in that's all that matters that's not the right direction we were just told to hold that to the very end you know how you were when you first came in you were on fire for god you couldn't wait to share it with somebody even if they didn't want to hear it you learned quickly that you didn't have wisdom but you had joy you had perfect praise honestly so i want to say wherever you are at in your relationship with christ you need to go on to perfection not be comparing where you're at with soul and soul that won't provoke you to good works you need to lay aside the weights that so easily beset you you need to lay aside everything and go get perfect love go get it don't wait if god's not going to hand it to you go after it brother brown said lay everything aside until you get it go after it when opportunities come up and you got garbage going on in your life and somebody's coming at you and it's a real negative situation this is the opportunity to get it there won't be some flowery sermon that you say amen to makes you feel good say oh i've got perfect love now it don't happen like that and you'll see real quick when you have the acid test whether you're headed or not it's easy for man to assume that he's on the right road all the time and heading in the right direction man naturally has a a carnal spirit about him where spiritual things seem foolish unto him in other words he thinks the harder way is not the right direction humility isn't necessary dying out to the will and denying yourself desire the carnal spirit inside of a man is proud it's boastful is arrogant and he's overconfident and he's in need of nothing the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god so how can he know that he's in the right direction we must always recognize the selfish evil nature that's inside of us and kill it daily there needs to be a real real killing now anything that gets killed isn't enjoyable it hurts so if you're hurting if you pray long enough to where you're hurting you're getting somewhere you've got a good chance you're going to end up going in the right direction that day continue to yield yourselves to the holy ghost as lambs as lambs depending totally on the leadership of god not on your ability to make it through the course of the day just because we're children of god does not mean that we're automatically going in the right direction now if we love god first with our lives and we're working according to the eternal purpose which brother branham said mission work is always in the wild lord there was nothing else he says always in the will of the lord then we know that all things are going to work out for our good but if we love god second and we're working according to our purposes our plans you have no scriptural basis for thinking you're going in the right direction or that things are going to work out for your good even if you're a child of god romans chapter 8 verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god that's a really good scripture but when we're currently walking in our flesh we're not automatically going to catch god's leadership he can still be leading but we're so much in our flesh that we're going to think all the harder way forget it pray more no way wash somebody's feet not right now all because we're in the flesh but still claiming we're a son or daughter of god romans 8 verse 7 because the carnal mind is enmity it's against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so our carnal flesh our carnal mind isn't going to see god's leadership it's going to think i don't think so so then they that are in the flesh they cannot please god remember how the the lord spoke to us last service and told us that we could actually grieve the holy spirit and hold bitterness and express wrath and anger clamor and evil speaking with malice that certainly wouldn't be going the right direction if we're doing that so it's not about we're son of god we're led by the spirit of god and i'm claiming it right that's crazy i wonder are we going the right direction every day i don't need to be praying the wrong direction but i want to really provoke you wanting to know about it instead of just doing what the devil wants is for you to assume galatians chapter 5 verse 13 for brethren we have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for yourself but by love serve one another god's given you liberty to go serve somebody it's not for yourself to do what you want to do we were perverting what god has given us same thing satan did for all the laws fulfilled in one word even this that thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself how many really cares about somebody like they care about themselves find a person like that i'm telling you they stick out like a sore thumb but that's the right direction but if you bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another this i say then walk in the spirit this is the right direction walking in the spirit is the right direction and you should not fulfill the lust of the flesh you want to know if you're going in the right direction are you in the spirit well i just don't got time today for the flesh lusteth against the spirit the spirit against the flesh so they are contrary one to another soul that ye cannot do the things that you would there's a there's a battle going on if you don't feel the battle you're in the wrong direction you've got to be able to feel that flesh trying to pull you off and go off the y a little bit and when you you see that happening you're aware you've got consciousness you've got antennas going you're being able to discern the spirit to try the spirit now it's true that there are times that god will orchestrate certain things in your life he will intervene in certain situations and cause certain things to happen even if you're absolutely been out of his will going in the wrong direction god can do that he's god he can do what he wants to do but by no means do you ever think just because you're god's child and you and that god does those things that you can do what you want to do and it'll be okay i say no way jose it's it's not going to happen now if that's been your your revelation or your mentality i just want to tell you you're heading in the wrong direction you're just right in your own eyes but what is required to know whether you're going in the right direction that's my question to you you're eating up my time i want answers first of all it's not so much knowing which direction is right but which spirit are you being operated by to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servant you are to whom you obey it's the spirit don't focus on well should i buy this car should i work at this place should i go to this vacation house why are those things so important i guess maybe a better question is why isn't what god wants you to do with your life more important about what you're yielding to every day if you want to know the right direction you've got to know that you've met god's requirements i don't want you to focus on things in places there's no character building in that our emphasis needs to be what is god wanting you to do with your time who is he wanting you to reach out to to die out to something in your flesh that's going on we all got them yeah but brother john so-and-so's got more than anybody so so i mean obviously there's got to be one person in here that's doing more than others and one person is doing the least there's got to be there's got to be because we're not but but because he that's is guilty of one is guilty of all which puts us on the same level so it really doesn't matter who's doing more who's doing worse what matters is are we spending our time really trying to get on the right track trying to get in the right direction are we just satisfied with going to church i'll come when i can when i can i don't i do what i feel like doing i'll try to fit in and where's where where is the dying out where is that suffering for christ we all suffer in the flesh right hey when you wake up and things aren't going your way but when you choose to die out to live your life for somebody else because you have in your heart and mind their soul is best interest that's the right direction well i'm gonna wait till i get all caught up with all my honey-do lists well mine it just keeps going thinking i there wasn't that much on there when i looked at it last we've got to separate number one from our ideas so that's why it's important the more that you want something it's harder because that thing is standing in the way you're well god promised give me the desire of my heart and whatever i asked for you have not because you asked not and you're just you're you're drilling for what you're wanting why don't we drill for what god wants for us what about that well god wants me to have that be happy okay okay done with the subject let's go on now to perfection not to what you want to perfection to what god wants we don't i want i want i i want my children to have everything that they want it's just a natural feeling i think god wants us to be happy and have everything we want but that ain't all i want for my children i'll tell you that they're gonna go right to destruction if that's all they you know i want them to have something that'll that'll hold them that'll develop character that can function that can represent god that's what i want never free more agency they're not all excited about that think about the same thing for you and god because you're claiming him you're claiming to go in the right direction is it possible he's really wanting us to go in the different direction that we're going right now what are you saying brother john what are you really saying i'm saying exactly what i'm saying now he said a little eleven leaveneth the whole lump so maybe a little bit this direction we want to go is not the direction he's wanting and only you and god can decide this not nobody else because god may be dealing with husband and wife differently in different levels and different things because there's a whole lot of things in my life that he's working on i don't know i can keep it straight you know when you go in and see the doctor and i've got certain doctors i mean charts just you know going through my charts i'm thinking come on what is that a repeat god's probably got a lot of things he's dealing with us with i be i'm interested in knowing what those things are and he's interested in knowing us knowing what those things are but we've got to separate from our ideas number one naaman had to separate from his ideas in order to obey the word of god because he thought it was going to be just like this and if he would have stayed with that he would have went the wrong direction but god's grace came and he headed in the right direction after that and he got the right results abraham had to separate from his family in order for god to lead him to the promised land now watch this god was leading abraham in the right direction and abraham didn't even know where he was going see it's it's not about knowing what the right direction is it's about the spirit having the right spirit having the spirit leading you not to get what you want to give god what he wants now it's a perfect type of god leading his church we don't always know where he's leading but we know that the spirit is leading us in the right direction so we have to separate from our own ideas that's the first thing i want to say and this is why it makes it so hard when you have a big i want about something and you're wanting to to know the right direction for that i say focus on the other things first the i want can get in your way brother branham taurus you got to stay neutral about things so if you stay neutral with certain things it's it's going to be easier to to achieve it that's all i'm going to say but praise god that he has a perfect will for us and everything remember when brother branham was being led to aunt jemima brother brandon had to leave his own ideas his ideas i had to get to the post office i got to get that mailed and then i got to get to the airport because the plane's taken off now those were his ideas and he had to forsake them in order to go the right direction and he didn't even know where he's going keep walking keep walking keep walking that's how god leads he doesn't tell us this is what you're going to do this is what you want and this is how it's going to happen he don't owe me any explanation what he what he needs from me is just obedience and a tenderness to know that's him leading me but if i'm so much in the flesh how am i going to catch the right direction remember the time that brother branham his own ideas was to go to israel and to show that sign to the people because they would believe it and how frustrated it must have been from brother mike here in america and people just rejected it so much so this he had his ideas this is what but it wasn't the direction the right direction for him as a prophet and why didn't god show him that right away because god is not obligated to show us everything all the time when we want to know it what's important is that we learn to be neutral forsake our desires because it was his desire to go it was brother ben's desire to go and i think it makes it harder to see when your desire is for something i hope your questions there were times that brother branham wanted to tell ministers certain things that they were just brother random's thoughts remember god said you're telling them too much you're taught you're telling the ministers too much you shouldn't be doing that this is between me and you there were times brother branham wanted to go to certain places but they were just brother rams thoughts he had to forsake him at the beginning when god told him to go to a certain church and preach to those people brother branham his thoughts were not to go look what happened he went the wrong direction you know the story but there's a lot to this other than well you know what i would love to be able to go ahead and get me a nice cadillac it's not about things you want this is a this is this is your relationship with god is it one for his kingdom or is it one for your kingdom you using god for your kingdom for your wants for your direction for your interest the right direction don't automatically take place because we're children of god this is a real important fact there are precise choices that you have to make remember what god told brother branham i'm reading from the true easter seal about the prophecies is because thou has chosen the narrow path the harder way thou has walked of thine own choosing brother branham didn't choose what seemed right to him now of course god had to teach him some things along the way but he eventually chose the harder way it was a narrow path it was a harder way and he walked it of his own choosing so the the right direction has has to happen in your choice in your choosing it can't be god just you know blindfold you and you know no you are going to be presented with the harder way to live for others to spend time on your knees praying to get serious about what's happening in this hour and you can choose to get caught up in the things of the world and all the distractions as brother ron was saying anything to consume us that's what the devil is presenting to us the word has to become vital to you it has to become important to you don't wait for the lights to flash here we got 18 ministers we're going to have a big rally right here and and you're going to be told what's happening no if it ain't going on in your heart in a prayer closet at your home don't look for it here you're proving where you're at with god in your prayer closet at home this is just where you come to make sure that you don't do what you want to do and have to have god every time you come to church hit you off the high horse yeah right you need we we need to love god beyond that so brother branham he chose the narrow way he chose to walk the heart away he says thou has pro that thou has picked the correct and the precise decision and it is my way wow didn't force him he made it real clear you did have your own choosing you the one that picked it i didn't force it i didn't make you do it just because you're my prophet and to make sure it turned out right i had to control it no frimo agency you chose the right direction you turn the the wrong direction down the easy path brother brandon when he's saying this he said bless god it's my way he said that's what's important you know when you're suffering for somebody i'm telling you that's god's way but when you're suffering because of what you're you've done that's not the same suffering because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision that was made this in itself and he says here big prophecies around it this in itself is that which will give and may come to pass the tremendous victory in love divine so here we are brother man says whatever you do get perfect love and we have this beautiful to me real clear instructions here how to get it choose with your own free will to go the harder way and that decision is what will lead you to get perfect love i love it i love the word amen in order to be heading in the right direction we must be sure first of all that we have forfeited our thoughts in other words i i do remember this when i started out i wanted to marry cheryl so bad you remember that honey and i can take you to the field that i cried my eyes out and begged with god and made a plea deal with him as if he was saying well all right i'll do it and that thing just kind of hauled over my head that i made that deal with him and i knew that i could not start my walk off with god with that hanging over me god got me to a place that i did not and was i don't want to say did not want her but i did not want her first i was easily willing to say no if this was what your will was for me lord i forfeited my thought as much as i didn't want to but i did gave that up and then god showed me the right direction but it happens like that every day in our life if we're willing to do that we can learn the will of god on a daily basis for our lives for the things that he wants us to do that day if we forfeit our thoughts what we're going to do how we're going to run the day what our plans are forfeit them say lord i just want your direction for my life i don't want to do this or that i want what you want from me lord romans chapter 12 verse 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present yourself yourself your mind your thoughts your life a living sacrifice wow holy and acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world don't just do it because this is the way everybody else is doing in church how do you know the bride well i do because you know they came in before me so we need that personal relationship with christ not that always comparing be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is the right direction the good and acceptable and perfect will of god that is the right direction you got to prove it for i say through the grace given unto me to every one of us sitting here today not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think brother john nothing you can say that's going to distract me i know that i'm going in the right direction and if you say it one more time you're going to offend me that almost sounds like we're thinking more highly than we ought to think but we need to think soberly amen according as god has doubted to every man a measure of revelation we don't know at all we don't know all the direction that god has for us the right direction is to forfeit your thoughts in other words present yourselves soberly as a lamb before the lord lord i don't know what your will is but show me not as someone who's already has things figured out just seems like they always know god's direction all the time god resists the proud who already know and gives grace or gives direction to the humble god gives grace to those who acknowledge and believe that they don't know the right direction yet there's nothing wrong with being humble in fact there's a better chance that god is really directing you now jesus or james taught us in james chapter 4 that we really don't know the will of the lord or the right direction that's what he taught us james chapter 4 verse 13 go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we'll go into such a city and continue their year and buy and sell and get gained now this sounds like a pretty good plan doesn't it how many times do we hear people say god showed me well this is this is for us whereas you know not what shall be i do too god showed me for what is your life it's even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away for you ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do this or do that even when brother branham knew he was right he said i could be wrong i'm not saying that god don't show you things i'm not saying that but somehow we can develop that spirit that we're always pushing that agenda instead of pushing the agenda i could be wrong here i'm just trusting the lord and lord show me if i'm off if the lord will we shall live we shall do this or that of course we know it's the will of the lord if we live for others if we spread the gospel if we go e out if we invite somebody to church if we come a little earlier and get our heart prepared we already know that's the will of the lord these are about other things but it's the right direction to say if the lord will but if we're not doing that he says in verse 16 but now you rejoice in your boostings yeah god show me the very rejoicing of it when we arrogantly boast about something we're going to do i'm just going to tell you it's the wrong direction i don't know how many times the lord has showed me something i just tuck it just tuck it it's just the grace that he would show me because he don't owe me anything and i certainly haven't done anything to deserve it in fact it's just the other way around the other way around the right direction has more to do with the humble spirit than it does about what you're doing i'm doing what god told me to do i'm going it has more to do with a humble spirit too many believers today think that the correct doctrine is always the right direction contrary to what the prophet said i'd rather have the right spirit and be wrong in my doctrine than have the right doctrine and be wrong in my spirit so it's more about having the right spirit which we all can have that we all can have that we all can really promote the right direction our life by simply having a right spirit not having to figure out what the right direction is are you with me no the right doctrine and the wrong spirit will always lead people in the wrong direction and the good example of this is the pharisees they were so right in their doctrine that they were so wrong in their spirit their motives were all mixed up they wanted glory for themselves they wanted to prove others were wrong they want to prove they were better they were the only right ones and they had doctrine for it all but they were heading in the wrong direction but the right humble contrite i could be wrong spirit will always lead you out of being wrong in your views to the truth that's why i don't fear being wrong i fear having a wrong spirit look at the prostitutes the tax collectors jesus said they'll enter in faster the bible says the common people heard jesus gladly always remember the right direction has more to do with a humble spirit than it does actually what you're doing proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 as we're winding down here proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not to that own understanding so here we've got the first direction you've got to give up your thoughts give them up that's the first thing dump your thoughts lay down your ideas forget about what you've already got figured out just set it aside in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path the reas the recipe for the right direction is to let go of your thinking let go of your understanding and humble yourself to ask god about it and then wait for him to show you if you acknowledge him the promise is he will direct your path if you don't ask him you just go on what you think what you feel what you want what you desire what somebody told you that god gets jealous of that god don't want to share that with anybody he wants to claim that all for himself he wants it to be you and him so when you take the time lord this is the situation strike me trust in that prayer and then you march forward that's you keep maintain and any time you allow your spirit to get haughty boastful arrogant know right away you're in the wrong direction no right away you're in the wrong direction that's why we don't render evil for evil when somebody uses you you just love them and pray for them don't get your flesh in there the right direction is always the harder way but it's the precise decision and it is god's way be not verse 7 be not wise in your own eyes why would that be right afterwards because the tendency is every man is right in his own eyes be not wise in your own eyes be dumb in your own eyes be dumb i don't want people to think i'm dumb that's the problem we're worried about a reputation this is the recipe for the right direction we don't know the right direction so we ask the lord he'll direct our paths do not be wise in your own eyes that just opens the door for pride fear the lord and depart from evil well what is evil lies in your own eyes your thoughts what you think now what if it is the same as the lord's thoughts depart from being wise in your own eyes don't rest on what i know is what god wants the spirit is wrong it's it's more about having the right spirit a humble i could be wrong take the back seat that's the right direction you don't have to prove anything god's going to prove it all it's not so much the right direction that we're looking for but it's the right spirit to direct us i want to try to end with this john chapter 16 verse 12. remember god's thoughts are higher than our thoughts that's why we've got to dump ours i'd like to assume everything i think is what god thinks all the music i listen to is the music he likes everybody anybody try telling you a song and say listen this is a good one you listen to and you think you can't wait till it's over but we think the music we listen to is the stuff that god likes just multiply that to everything in your life god's thoughts are higher than ours we've got to be willing to let them go john chapter 16 verse 12 i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now i wonder how many times the holy spirit has tried to tell you something and you said i can't deal with this right now i i can't bend over that much i can't live for somebody that much i can't pray that i can't go to church i can't give that much of my time i can't be any more giving than what i'm giving i wonder how many times the holy spirit had something to say to us but we just couldn't deal with it and yet it's the right direction for us but the natural man exactly exactly brother ron now you don't have to do that but god will always bring us back to his word he's never changed since the day we met him he'll never change the quicker we change the better things will be amen our flesh just wants to to lean to its own understanding be wise in our own eyes but how be it when he the spirit of truth is come when the holy spirit is coming to us to guide us in the right direction into all truth he shall not speak of himself but whosoever he he whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come see the right direction comes from the right spirit not the knowledge of what that spirit parts to us or what we think is the right direction it's the right spirit that leads us in the right direction and the right direction is his will for our lives not just well i know what this doctrine says i believe in that doctrine it's not that it's the doctrine that he's trying to get you to live that you haven't been living it's you're doing your thing and he wants you to start doing more of his thing that's the direction he's trying that's what the personal holy ghost is for personal he deals with me differently than he deals with you you may be wanting three cadillacs so bad you may be wanting three horses so bad that's why i didn't say fishing boats i know i know but i'm trying to stay away from anything that could possibly be the point that i'm trying to say is god's dealing with me with my issues we all got issues god's deal with you with your issues the spirit is trying to lead you through those we don't want to use god for an earned boy that means only for the things that we would like we want to forsake our ideas give them up let his spirit direct us into something that's harder more difficult tomorrow than it was today that means we're walking more and the harder way right there's two paths one's easy one's hard if you want a more direct right path for you it's going to be harder it's not going to be harder for the prophet and everybody else but easier for you so if you're wanting that you can expect things are going to be harder you have to give up more you have to make more sacrifices but this is the precise decision and that momentous decision oh a huge portion of heaven awaits us this in itself will bring to pass that victory it's a victory love divine when you can love no matter what anybody does to you that's a victory it's not a gift character is not a gift it's a victory you had to give up something to get it you had to overcome your flesh you had to kill it you had to crucify it you had to say not my will lord but thine be done be glorified through me amen let's stand together praise the lord god's spirit is leading us in the right direction how many wants a clearer picture of that amen i believe the lord has showed us the importance of the right spirit for that amen this thing flow through me flow through me holy spirit

the right direction amen amen sorry i started too quick right have faith in god [Applause] have faith in god for the answer have faith in god have faith in god have faith in god have faith in god for the answer have faith in [Music] god amen praise the lord let's go to the lord in prayer heavenly father lord thank you for building our faith to trust in you for the right direction for our lives lord we don't want to blindly just walk and think it's the right direction lord we don't even want to practice those things but lord today we're coming to you with a a renewed dedication lord we want to forsake our our thoughts our ideas just become so neutral with things lord we want to acknowledge you with every situation and lord i believe we believe that you would direct your children in the right path lord i pray that our faith would be strong strong enough to believe lord not blindly but with a confidence that you have given us that we're in your perfect will going in the right direction lord help us to have your spirit a right humble spirit in every situation and lord i pray that when we're off when our spirit's off when our thoughts are off when our desires are off but we're still trying to claim a a a direction for our lives that is not your perfect will i pray that you be gracious be merciful to us and show us quickly lord because our desires is to turn and walk with you lord our love for you lord inside desires to choose the narrow way the harder way not because our flesh wants to no but because we know it is your way for you are the way and your way is the harder way and lord we're just yielding ourselves to you in this prayer we've heard your word we've accepted your word we're saying yes to your word and lord we want a huge portion of heaven awaiting us too we want there to be many souls on the other side because we've chosen to spend our time looking for souls god give us a revelation what heaven's all about we love you lord we commit ourselves to you we praise you in the wonderful name of jesus christ amen amen praise you jesus amen let's just take a moment and just just love them oh lord we want to express our love to you express your the same love you gave us we want to express it back to you lord that eternal love that living for others type of love oh god thank you for your goodness thank you for your grace thank you for everything you've done for us lord thank you for showing us the right direction for our lives thank you for helping us walk in the right direction lord thank you for the right spirit lord thank you jesus amen amen let's sing i'm going through i'm going through lord i have started to walk in the light shining upon me from heaven so bright i've made the world and its follies are due i've started in jesus i'm going through yes i'm going through yes i'm going through and i'll pay the price whatever others do i'll take the way with the lords just by his view i'm going through jesus i'm going through oh there are many who start in the race but with the light refused to keep pay others accept it because it is new but not very many expect to go through but i'm going through yes i'm going through and i'll pay the pride whatever others do i'll take the way with the lord's despised views i'm going to jesus i'm going through i'd rather walk with jesus alone and have for a pillow like jake up a stone live in each moment with his face in view then shrink from my pathway and fail to go through others do i'll take the ray with the lord just by spear i'm going through jesus i'm going through amen sounds like you're determined amen amen how many will work with me because i'm going to do this too put into practice what we heard tonight this this week take the time to pray lord i don't know i don't want to assume i really need you to direct my life i don't want to assume it's almost a wrong thing i think to assume that god's always leading us there's just too many examples in the bible that it wasn't soul but that humble and controy spirit he'll not despise that you have that you you are being led because you want it more than anything when you want it more than anything you will be being led but it's when those other desires slip in there that can can can confuse us so but if we practice this i just believe god will prosper us and and bless our lives because we're actively trying to put him in our lives we're inviting him in say that brother what were you going to say amen amen that's right his word is forever settled in heaven amen well i just want to say amen to what brother all ron said for our sister trisha we are depending on her and it's it's she's used to not leading so and then when cheryl's not here has to lead it's a totally different role you wouldn't think it you know but yeah all of a sudden you got to be johnny on the spot in the first note where before cheryl kind of has to do that so we're thankful for our sister and then we could please pray for sister cheryl i think things are going better in the directions of her lungs but honestly her she is doing worse her her nights her pain her can't walk it's just it's terrible but there is a little loosening that's going up she said today just before i left so that's a good sign that's a good sign but let's pray that she doesn't she gets better somewhat real quick so she don't have to go in there and get an x-ray because it's all possible to stay out of the hospital good to see brother tyler amen brother do you feel comfortable enough to to close us in prayer okay god bless you thank you lord amen [Music] wow right you
