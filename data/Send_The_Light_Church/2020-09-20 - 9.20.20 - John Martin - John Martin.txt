TRANSCRIPT
========================================
put it into our body to identify who we are and where we're at at the same time this chip could have enough information that it has all your banking your account your identification you won't bow to buy or sell without it makes sense doesn't it is it a monster computer in brussels that knows everything is it the barcode that we see on every item that we buy is it a universal id card or a health card or a hidden dna marker that they're going to put in a vaccine is it tied to a credit card or our social security card there's a lot of thoughts out there there's actually a number of things and names that end or add up to 666 and i want to show you one of them right now on the screen if ain could put it up there here are the titles of the roman catholic church that add up to 666. and you can see uh they're in in latin but what it means i tell you in church or the vikar of god's son the head of the clergy latin kingdom latin speaking man all these are adding up to 666 and there are so many more oh i've got pages and pages and pages of things that add up to 666. i want to draw our attention to one vicarious philiadi and most of us that are in the message have heard of that but the wikipedia encyclopedia said the vicarious philiadiliae means the viker or the representative of the son of god you can actually find this in most common dictionaries but uh it refers to simon peter a leader of the early church was regarded as the first pope by the catholic church and he was since he was given the keys right jesus gave him the keys to the kingdom jesus was gone and peter is conversation when you're gone strengthened thy brethren and you have the keys to the kingdom acts 2 38 he he preached the keys so they kind of went to seed on that and every pope that came along became the next in line viker is a person who acts in place of another or instead of so we might look at that is the instead of the son of god another way of looking at it is uh the substituting for or the place of another read accounts where people have saw the crown war by the pope with the words written on it right there's been others that have identified it many accounts of it in the catholics writing i mean i've got pages and pages and pages that their own catholics talk about it brother branham said in the message questions and answers he said well it isn't over the latin the latin words isn't over the vatican city it's over the throne of the pope where he sits on his throne and he he wrote up their vicarious philly idea i if you wish to in the morning i'll bring it out everything and put it on a piece of paper and if you want i'll bring it to you in the morning where you can spell it out in the roman letters vicara's philadelphi the word means instead of the son of god he is the successor of the son of god the catholic church believes that peter was the first pope he is the successor of jesus christ which is an heir yes all right then they claim that every pope following him is the successor and the pope now that is now is the successor of jesus christ and there it's rolled up there a successor of jesus christ take the roman letters and just write x for ten and v for five and so forth and spell out vicarious filial id and draw a line and you've got 666 write it out and find out now i've got a quite a bit of reading that i have to do so at this point i'm going to say you don't even have to pay attention i'll let you know when you need to pay attention viker of christ the title used almost exclusively of the bishops of rome as a successor of peter therefore the one of the church who particularly takes the place of christ but used also bishops in the general and even even a priest first used by roman sidna of ad495 refers to pope oh and this list i'm telling you it there's so much in the catholic writings i don't have time to read any of that amen the crown represents power and of the authority of the pope many of you have heard of my own personal testimony as i was talking to a priest and he told me that the pope has the power to change the word of god amen and that is what just changed my thoughts about church and afterwards god said that i'm not in the church i am in the word that's right that's why the emphasis in here is not the church but the word wherever he goes the insignia of john paul ii is displayed embolizing on the pope mobile hung from stages and on high as the post at the outdoor masses the various parts of the papal symbol show below and i didn't put that up on the screen but it's has the triple crown and the two keys referring to peter having the keys the red cross there all means something various parts of the papal symbols shown below describe the power of the papal pepper see one who as pope leo the 13th explained occupies the place on earth of god almighty most notable in the papal papal emblem is the terror of the triple crown until recently during the coronation of a new pope the tierra was placed on the head with the words receive the terror adorned with three crowns and know that you are the father of princes and of kings the guide of the world the viker of the savior jesus christ in this age where its appearance before masses and media and so forth the last two popes chose not to have this crowning ceremony including their coronation however lest we think they have abandoned the incredible claims of this crown it is displayed everywhere as the symbols of papacy therefore since it is in still widespread use it is good to understand the meaning of the three crowns the first circle of the crown symbolizes the pope's universal e-p-i-s-c-o-p-a-t-e for sure when you need her this means that he claims to be the ruler all over all the church of christ as priestly power including the power to forgive sins must come through him and his agents this is why the current pope john paul ii felt justified in reminding us that you should be in submission to him in order to be saved no salvation outside the church of rome quite simple that makes this makes spiritual slaves of nearly one billion people who christ died for the viker of christ is actually the same as antichrist with the same results the pope substitutes himself in place of god and earth and that's exactly what the meaning of antichrist is amen said in the in 63 and christ in the mystery of god revealed he says and a man that is a god-sent man would never stay in a denomination after hearing this or seeing what it is if he's got enough to go out and look at it certainly see i don't say that critically i say that truthfully see that's right the revelation notice in the last days lucifer is doing the same thing can you see it the devil's doing the same thing building a high bred church a hybrid a high bred members high blood and knowledge instead of the word of god by intellectual men instead of born again men building an intellectual kingdom that will outshine christ little bitty flock see what is that what is that did that fallen angels yes the bible said it was fallen angels who listened to lucifer instead of christ instead of christ who they once belonged to is that right now listen close fallen angels what kind of fallen angels luther wesley catholics pentecostal who kept not their first estate like the angels did and it fell into an organization yes like lucifer's main hold on nicaea and what they have done they organized a great and medical association of ministers to make it a church and orders like it see it's lucifer at his work strong brother brandon said in the message presuming he said the world councils of churches is forming the image of the beast i'm sure you're paying attention now and nobody's taking notes everybody just takes notes at my boring subject when they're falling asleep all right i was i thought there'd be a lot more chuckles with that one but the pulpit is not a place to joke so i deserve that one when we think of the mark of the beast much time has been spent emphasizing the name of the beast or the number of his name so it's either been the denominations the catholic church the pope or 666 that's what the emphasis has been and little emphasis has been put on the wisdom of the mark of the beast on the wisdom part which is the same as a man same as the number of man here's wisdom let him that understand count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is 666. so it's about the man let's bear that in mind as we go through this this second beast exercised all the power of the first beast which by the way way killed 68 million protestants yes the second beast calls the earth to worship the first beast whose wound deadly wound was healed amen the second beast deceived the people to make an image unto the first beast amen the second beast had power to give life to the first beast so the motive of the second beast is to get back to the plan of the first beast to get the world to worship him now remember lucifer's motive from the beginning was to get worship amen to get people to worship him to get at that time angels to worship him instead of god get it instead of god i will exalt my throne above the throne of god i want to be like the most high i want everybody looking up to me now nobody is going to worship second string over god which is not going to happen no one in their right mind is going to lead the creator of all living to worship something that cannot create so what does he do he makes an image unto himself he exercises the power towards his motive to be exalted so that's his end game satan can't create he's been if i could say it like this he's had to be content with not being able to create so what does he do he perverts what god has already created for himself and he causes them to look to the image instead of god he causes everyone else to turn away from god's will to their own will that's why we must clearly see what's happening when we have the satanic urge to get people to look at us instead of pointing them to the glory of jesus christ [Music] amen he manipulates all people both small and great rich and poor free and bond and causes all to receive a mark in their right hand or their foreheads people on earth will not be able to function without the image of the beast that image could be the mark of the beast the name of the beast the number of the beast we find in verse 18 there's a clue with wisdom and understanding that the number of this horrible beast is the same number as a man so i think we need to dig into the man the word beast means wild dangerous brutal savage same as a man [Laughter] that word mark is a badge of servitude satan wants us to be his servant and since we're not just going to outright live a life and worship the devil as long as we worship our will and do what we want to do we are serving the devil because there's only two wills gods and everybody else's [Music] and i know we don't want to put ours with satan because we feel we don't do horrible things but when we're not doing god's will it's horrible amen you can give the right hand a fellowship to a man-made denomination and you can agree in your forehead of what that what they're saying or what they're preaching but this mark is the same mark that's inside of a man satan perverted what god created in the garden by getting man to choose to do his own will instead of there's the mark right there instead of god's will instead of the the son of god's will it started right there and every man that's been born since that time is in the very image of the beast he's not the beast but he's in the image of the beast and that the thing that's in common is that man is born with his own will i just want that to soak in amen every man was conceived in sin shaping in iniquity speaking lies and doing his own will you didn't have to teach him to do that you couldn't stop him from doing that and remember satan was perfect until iniquity was found in him not doing what he knew he should be doing which was putting god first he decided to put himself first his will first his pleasures his plans his future first it became first that's what was found in his heart and that's when perfection became perversion and if you look at the church today pleasures more than pleasures of god lovers of themselves more than lovers of god right inside the church is the mark of the beast [Music] and so what does satan do he makes an image like unto himself here's cain just doing his own thing god comes to him and says you know if you if you do well you're going to be accepted but if you don't sin lies at the door right amen he chose not to do the right thing amen iniquity he perverts a perfect creature to do his own will above the will of his creator and that's what he did with eve and that's why jesus prayed when he when he was struggling with his will he prayed lord not my will thine be done amen that's why he taught his disciples to pray thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven amen iniquity is simply not doing the things that we should be doing it's the easiest sin to commit a man's life is shapened into a life of iniquity our thoughts of sinning are usually centered around not doing bad things because we know bad things are sin but we put little emphasis on not doing good things is really not that bad as long as i'm not doing bad things people in the denominations think that they're safe as long as they're not in the catholic church people in this message think they're safe as long as they're not in the denomination [Music] people right inside this message still have the mark of the beast they're still in their own will they've really never decided to put gods first now they don't mind paying tithes they don't mind changing their clothes but they're not giving up their will their will is instead of gods these things aren't good enough a change of clothes or giving up 10 that you never had to give up before nothing will be accepted outside of god's perfect will for your life nothing that's why jesus said you must be born again amen not you must pay your tithes not you must change your clothes you must take care of your hair your hair you must be born again amen or you'll never enter heaven amen you're just not going to enter heaven with your will right that's the very reason he put flaming swords to protect the tree of life you're not coming into life with your will we have to be born of god's will that's why peter said in first peter chapter 1 verse 23 being born again not of the corruptable seed but the incorruptable by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever we must be born of the word of god not just god's word saying you're born again the whole nature needs to change the corruptable seed that we were born with is just the seed to do our own will paul said that when we're truly born again of an incorruptible seed that there's a nature change yes there's a nature change with our will he describes it in second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things become new and look at this wonderful verse and all things are of god the emphasis is all things are of god we're born by the seed of god the will of god it's incorruptible it is incorruptible the will of god is incorruptible the seed of god is incorruptible but you know what our will is corruptable it gets us in trouble every time we use it every time we say i'm going to handle it my way i'm going to do it my way corruption comes something happens amen the devil has made a hybrid church they still believe in god as their savior but all things don't have to be of god they still believe in god as their provider but all things don't have to be done according to his will it's a carnal church without the complete new birth it's an intellectual church figuring out what they can get away with and what they can't and you're not going to outsmart the devil you need to just say amen to the word of god and stay with it lean not to your own understanding god knows his sheep paul told timothy in second timothy chapter 2 verse 19 nevertheless the foundation of god stands sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his can you say amen but we don't want to stop there if you're his sheep and let everyone that says i believe in jesus yes sir if you name the name of christ what are we to do depart from iniquity depart from i know i should do this but i kind of don't want to do it because it crucifies my flesh i have to die out amen i've got to depart from that way of thinking now i've got to accept that god's perfect will is the most important thing of my life amen and it's no longer about oh just not doing bad things but it's about learning to do more good things his will becomes first this is all about god's will you know we want to claim where his and do whatever we want to do i'm telling you it's just tommy rot it's sickening amen it's the mark of the beast amen and we don't even know it we've been deceived every one of us every one of us ought to be departing from doing our own will and our own things defining iniquity is not doing what we know we should be doing and we know we should be putting god's will first in our lives lucifer was perfect until in his heart he wanted to do what he wanted to do which was simply not doing what god wanted him to do you know when we think about the devil we think of him just being some man with a fork and fire coming out of his mouth and he wants to just kill people we never look at him as being pretty and beautiful and sitting in church in the most religious of all of us but so stubborn won't do the will of god we were born with the same nature of satan he made an image unto himself and he knew what he was doing in the garden our nature has to change completely into the perfect will of god we need to get away from just defending who we are and we need to be putting the emphasis on a humble lord help me to do your will the only thing that can change our nature is god and he doesn't use a magic wand he uses his living word come on i'll read it peter said being born again not of corruptible seed but incorruptible by the word of god amen we're born by the word the emphasis is the word now not the dead letter but it's the life of this word it's believing that these words are spirit in their life amen it's the living word that changes us when you say amen i believe it that's for me that can change your life that's all that's going to matter when it's over the living word that's why we need the holy ghost but not just the holy ghost the seal the seal of the holy ghost it needs to be sealed we've all experienced the holy ghost but you know some people identify the seal as i spoke in tongues or i've got the seal because i believe because if you remember aber uh abraham believed it was counted on him for righteousness but then brother ram says but god gave him a seal of circumcision god has to give us something if we're sealed it don't come by us saying well brother john i come here to get it you're more likely to get it if you're fearing and trembling at the word of god reverencing god lord if it isn't for your grace i hope he holds out that's happened to her and accepts me today we've made a mockery the type of people a real christian ought to be defending what we believe more than living the life brother madam says the mark of the beast is not to receive the seal of god and we should say amen to that one and we think well the mark of the beast is something out there and all he's saying is if you don't get the seal of the holy ghost you got it it's an ultimate it's an automatic thing we we agree with the preaching that says you were born with that seed if you ever had eternal life you've always had is your life that seed is lying in you we all say amen to that we don't want to say amen that was born with the the nature of the beast but we were yes that thing has to die out don't preach on suffering brother john but try to get the holy ghost without dying out try to get the nature of god without dying out you know the world don't want that's why we got all those denominations out there well we don't believe like that denomination we got we take this little creed and now we're all saved we got the holy ghost what about the nature of god amen amen why can't we just take that word and let that word judge us every time we open the book why do we gotta tout around like we got something let the word speak to you in other words man is already marked with the same nature of self-will as lucifer had he's born with it second peter chapter 2 verse 10 but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and the despised government how many has been despising the government lately presumptuous are they self-willed i'm going to do this i'm going to do that they're not afraid to speak evil well this is what i think about those red wings this is what i think we're as angels which are greater in power and might bring not a railing acquisition accusation against them before the lord but why would we be so bold it's not bold it's pride there's a difference between boldness and pride which is arrogance the boulders righteous is a lion but there is humble as a lamb at the same time ah we don't got time to get that we had to get going we had a message here but i got a lot of things i can say about that but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil those things which they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own seed that they were born with said in the message just once more lord he says brother sister i don't know in my bible of any other thing that god has promised to do before the rapture of the church he says i don't he says you're thinking a mark of the beast is coming he says i've told you they've done got it he said the next thing left is the rapture of the church it'll it could come at any time and not just disrupt any scripture in the bible as far as i know god knows that to be the truth yes sir the time is at hand it's later than we think please don't make the same mistake that other messenger messenger message believers make they feel safe that they're not in a denomination they feel safe claiming they're born again they feel safe claiming they've received the holy ghost they feel safe claiming that they're sealed our safety isn't in what we claim many will come to me in that day and say lord lord did not i did not i did i but they did not want to depart from their own will right god is interested in us doing his will more than if a righteous man's false seven times sometimes he's going to get back up we put our emphasis on oh look what he did oh yeah amen as well as i'm not doing bad things i can do whatever i want to do where what gospel is that that's the gospel according to satan i urge you to take a look at your will are you walking are you waking up every day doing your will or you honestly know that you're doing god's will because look god is not asking everybody to get up get baptized every day we're supposed to be going on to perfection amen not well there's nothing left for me to do i guess i'm perfected look at the attitude that's true where is your vision of perfection what should we be doing don't give me a list of the 15 things that you're doing for the lord give me the list of things that you're doing for your own will because that's the list that god's staring at we must continue to die out until the will of god is completely born again in us every single day [Music] not just back there back then that's good that we can point back there but today is that day of salvation that we prove what is that good and perfect and acceptable will of god for our lives that is the image that we've been predestinated to our first birth was very cute ask our parents no matter how ugly you were you were cute they're the only ones that can vouch for that no matter how cute our first birth was we grew up into monsters how do i know ask the same parents that thought you were cute it was the mark of the beast right before him and if that human nature continues on right it's no telling what it will do in a spiral out of control now the second verse it was also messy but it was beautiful amen this time it wasn't your natural parents i thought it was good it was your heavenly father that was rejoicing and all of heaven was rejoicing amen i remember my wife's parents they were so mad and upset i remember my dad he just thought i was in a cult what you know i gave you a tv and you ain't giving your kids tv yeah my my natural parents didn't think the idea was so cute in fact they never took they never told me sit in that catholic church and be a listen to them and do what they tell you to do they were just happy that you were you know you go to church be a good boy but as we grow we become more like humble lambs amen the nature of god and if that nature continues in us as humans we will become more into the image of christ in fact things will become so much like him that the very nature of christ in man will be seen again it does it doesn't yet appear but we know when he shall appear we shall be like him we will be not in the image of the beast but in the image of god amen because a man at his very best can't nowhere get to the image of christ why we got to be born again romans chapter 8 verse 29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that we might that he might be the firstborn among many brethren do you ever see a family where they all look the same he just you knew who their parents were i do believe that we're going to be like jesus amen we've been predestinated it's a conforming if you think of that word conforming it's not doesn't sound like a comfortable word i'd rather have one of these you know done over but a conforming a constricting a pressurized we don't have to prove it by saying i know what the mark of the beast is i know its number is 666. i know the name of it is some denomination or the mother harlot the first one in all the other ho its daughters we don't prove it by knowing who the head the antichrist is we don't prove it by saying i know i got the holy ghost that's right we prove it by living it out every single day by living out the will of god every single day how can i start brother john how can i start doing that romans chapter 12. romans chapter 12 just a a a few verses later look at it look at it start out let's start with verse 22 the holy spirit will conform us to the image of christ romans chapter 12 verse 2 and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of god now that's what we've been born to is the will of god not just i'm in the message i receive william branham as the prophet i'm in denominations are out is that what you think the image of christ is we're supposed to be proving with our life what the will of god is proving it so why are we so defending with our words don't want anybody to cross us don't challenge me don't tell me i'm not why are we comfortable with just i'm happy with the life that i'm living i want everybody to look at it i want them to see me every day give up my will for the will of god i want to see them deny myself and pick up my cross and follow me why aren't i happy with that because we want to do our own will and say we're born again amen it's another jesus it's just another denomination hiding behind the religion of this message look at verse one i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice [Music] holy acceptable unto god this is your reasonable service amen not making it to church twice a week and paying your tithes and changing your clothes and changing your hair it's about the will of god do you wake up with i got to do god's will i gotta do as well or i just wake up as long as i'm not doing anything bad i'm okay do what you want to do as long as i'm not doing nothing bad what gospel were you listening to right that's the mark of the beast it's the same number as a man it's the same as a man he let let him that have wisdom count that number who's got wisdom today we need to become more serious about pressing towards the mark yes instead of defending that we've already received it or that we're already there or that we're already received the holy ghost defending that will never defending will never change our nature you can defend all you want they ain't going to change your nature ain't going to make you become more of a lamb you're gonna make you lay down your life for your brother wash your brother's feet go the second mile love your enemy defending what you believe doesn't change your nature but pressing in to become more into his image will humble contrary lord i recognize this beastly nature inside of me i give up my will for the your will lord i want to do your will you have a revelation of what it means to get up every day and pray lord let thy will be done here in this earth as it is your desire in heaven for me paul lived a life of pressing towards the mark he pressed into the mark in fact the mark became more and more a part of his life that it became actually in his life in his body galatians chapter 6 verse 16. let's start with that as and as many as walk according to this rule peace be unto them in mercy and upon the israel of a god from henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus what an honor it would be to be tattooed with the marks of jesus and not by man putting some cross here [Music] but by you laying down your life and suffering for it so much that your body becomes marked amen paul's life became marked through persecution to giving up his will right that's where his life become marked what we hear we heard some requests today or some something that was said about uh the people there in in india india indiana there that that that uh were rejected because they they took christ as their savior and now they're being persecuted by their their own uh people by their own family and this is how you get the marks of christ by giving up your will of course we understand they were in his body in second corinthians chapter 11 when he was comparing himself with other ministries the marks of other ministries he said are they the ministers he says i am the more and more uh in labor's more abundant and stripes above measure and prisons more frequent deaths often of the jews five times receive thy forty stripes say one thrice was i beat with rods once i was stoned thrice i was shipwrecked i suffered shipwreck night and day and i've been in the deep now i'm stopping there but you notice these things affected his body they became marks in his body because of him denying his will giving up his will to do the will of god remember he he told to ananias he says i must i will show him how much things he must suffer for my name's sake i wonder has god showed you what you're going to suffer for him or do you believe you don't have to suffer because he died for you at the cross and you don't have to give up anything i feel like preaching today we need a balance we need understanding of the scriptures not take them carnally and twist them to our fleshly favor we got to feel in debt to what god did for us something's got to put us out there and go yell out there give the gospel to others it doesn't matter what persecution comes if we don't suffer form the bible says we won't reign with him turn with me to ephesians chapter four we're gonna be closing with this if we could and i know you're all praying we could right lord bless john with that supernatural strength to close with this scripture ephesians chapter four i want us when we read this to keep in mind god's motive for his will inside the church his will that's what this is all about it's about his will therefore i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation where with your call so what will we call it to to prove i got it well we prove it with all lowliness and meekness longsuffering for bearing one another in love endeavoring to keep unity unity means oneness oneness of the spirit in the bond of peace there is one body now look where he goes in so many times he says one here there's one body one spirit even as you are called into one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god one will one will not ours we can inject ours into it it's the mark of the beast one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all wow there's no room left for me can i just squeeze a little bit me in there oh but you know we get to know satan's voice real good you know as soon as church is over god reserves who he's going to spend eternity with don't let satan trick you and deceive you that just because you're not in the denomination and you're in a message church that you're ready you're in the right place to get ready but you need to come through those doors with prepared to hear the word or satan's going to be ministering to you a carnal interpretation how many times you walk in the church you're offended at the word and think well i don't got to do that think about that to the word and it isn't because the word is wrong it's because our attitude we got the same attitude as laodicea in need of nothing i don't need that kind of preacher i need a preacher it makes me feel good makes me just stand up and claim what i want for my life in other words we want to service without the will of god and at least we want a service that tells us that the will of god is you know you whatever you ask for you can have i just wonder what we're born of what what spirit is preeminent it it ought to be leading us to be more in his image now the mark of the beast won't it's just the opposite it will look i remember when i was first introduced to come to church i did not want to go i didn't want to go to the catholic church but after i went to the message church oh my my i started hearing all these things my flesh didn't want to go there tell me i got to give up my music i'm married to my music i had the mark of the beast and i didn't know it and that nature wants to creep up yes that's why it's a daily affair don't be looking out there please don't be looking out there for the mark of the beast and feel safe and comfortable in here it's right there inside trying to come out and have its own will every single day in our lives and if you're courageous enough to crucify it i say that courageous enough if you're willing to stay there in prayer long enough to you mean it from the depths of your heart lord let thy will be done today praise god you're on the right track you're starting out right but you can't get to the place don't get to the place so deceived i got the holy ghost i don't got to worry about anything pretty soon you won't be doing anything for god you won't be dying out to anything verse 7 but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of god wherefore he saith when he ascended on high he lay kept his captive and gave gifts unto men now that he is thou that he ascended what is it but he descended first into the lower parts of the earth he the descendant is the same that also ascended up far above heavens that he might fill all things so god is everywhere he went into the heavens and what did he do he sent a five-fold ministry for us and he gave some apostles and prophets and evangelists and pastors and teachers now what did he give them for just to let them know that their seed of god and and no matter what happens they're going in the rapture but that's the kind of preacher we like don't we yeah thank you brother mike somebody said amen our flesh wants that our flesh does not want to come here and have its hide tore off and god knows anybody that knows me outside of this pulpit knows that is not my nature you've seen people you've seen people outside you're just like whoa what what kind of nature is that so it i have to say this this is not the nature of john martin the five-fold ministry is not it's not the nature of a human being now god has an expression through different people and it's expressed different ways and different parts of the gospel come out every time they preach and we can't get by with just a one-fold ministry we need a a five-fold why is it so important it's for the perfection of the saints yes amen for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all say i got it no till we all jump and have a hallelujah service nope can we all feel more self-esteem about herself nope till we all come into the unity of the faith we've got to believe the word right down the middle amen not dissecting it the way we want to and taking it the way we want to believing it the way we want to hum we got to stay humble and let let that five-fold ministry speak to us exactly the way that god wants us to take it oh i love that till we all come into the unity of faith and the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the statue of the phone sounds to me like this is the image of christ the fivefold ministry is for us to come into the image of christ yes amen now when you're not listening to the word means you're open to every other thought that comes into your head and those thoughts are going to emphasize the mark of the beast amen amen which is exercise your will amen that's what's important as long as you're not doing anything real bad couple more verses and i want you to read the rest of this chapter if you would later today because this this is talking about coming into god's image amen that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine and the sleight of men incoming craftiness whereby they lying away to deceit and i want you to understand this we may not go out and be talking to one i'm so confused i don't know what this and that we may not be doing that but in our minds we don't know man am i supposed to die out or you know is that crazy am i supposed to suffer or not suffer it's something that's happening up here and i'll tell you if you don't take the word for what the word says it won't bring you peace it'll just bring more confusion because you're trying to fit the word to your own understanding you can't do that you gotta lay it all aside you gotta let the word be preeminent you gotta be born by the word but speaking the truth and love may grow up how many wants to grow up you ever you ever look at some of your soul man you said just grow up maybe not like that maybe he said oh just grow up maybe you said it like that god wants us to grow up amen but speak the truth in love may grow up in into him in all all things we're satisfied with just ties clothes hair in the church in the message church and there what about the the rest of the all amen which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together compacted about with every joint supplier that which every joint what did what are you supplying me today come on give me something good what else can he give me huh where's not me no we got to supply we got to supply to every joint what we need that we all function properly with oh i'm so i got arthritis and i can't walk and we we got to supply something to one another we want to have so much faith that we believe that it's going to happen faith comes from god we've got to spend that time in prayer god move in this situation move in this part of the body help this member you see what they're going through because we need to come into the unity a body in the image of christ loving one another amen let's stand together don't look to the outside for the mark of the beast satan has already caused us to receive the mark and if we don't get the holy ghost we're stuck with it satan's mark is seen when a man does his own will satan's mark is seen when a man does his own will so we can simply see that mark in our life and the seal of god is seen is seen the mark of god the image of god is seen in a man when man is doing the will of god so i want to build my house on the rock yes not sinking sam don't stop pressing into the holy ghost until you see christ will only always living in you don't be satisfied 90 don't compare yourself with others got 80. if if the message is not causing you to strive to be more like christ we haven't heard the message it's the ministry here is to provoke us to press him to christ because satan's ministry all day long is to get us to relax take it easy you're in you're there all you need to do is just go to church and be encouraged right be encouraged because you're not spending time pressing into christ we need encouragement but we also need to be putting forth our effort to get encouraged to feed on the right things and to do his will because happy is he who does the will of the lord right amen amen that's our heart in prayer how many would desire prayer today amen praise the lord father we come to you with all of our hearts because we want to be completely born of your will we thank you for the holy spirit that you've given each one of us we thank you for the revelations many revelations that you've given us lord we're desiring today to non-stop press into living out your will every day we know that requires a dying out on our part that you won't force us to do it's a choice we make help us to remember lord even the words of joshua said i choose this day whom i'll serve whose will i'll serve today i pray that you would bless every hand that was lifted lord there's a desire in every one of their hearts lord to fulfill your will to be found completely born again

we need to do that lord father there's times that we're weak and we're just struggling in our flesh and having such a hard time to even make it through the day god at that time bring to our remembrance how we need to feed on this message we need to feed on the word of god we need to spend time laboring to enter into the spirit of god get back into that harbor safe your presence [Music]
