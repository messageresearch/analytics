[40:01] partying over there and uh we shall see
[40:05] Jesus our lord and we shall be with him
[40:09] that is all that our labor here is for

[40:32] Jesus for the day that would be may God
[40:35] give us Grace that will continue to
[40:36] press on until that day comes amen let's
[40:41] read from the gospel of St John chapter
[40:45] 6 and then we'll go to the book of
[40:48] Hebrews to Hebrews chapter 11 to read
[40:52] some few things from there St John
[40:55] chapter 6
[41:02] John chapter
[41:04] 6 let us read from verse
[41:10] 38 for I came down from
[41:15] heaven not to do my own
[41:19] will but the will of him that sent
[41:24] me and this is the father's
[41:29] will which have sent
[41:33] me that of all which he have given
[41:38] me I should lose
[41:41] nothing but should raise it up again at
[41:47] the last
[41:48] day and this is the will of Fame that
[41:52] sent me that
[41:55] everyone would see Heth the son and
[41:59] believeth on him may have everlasting
[42:04] life and I will raise him up at the last
[42:09] day amen amen let's read from Hebrews
[42:12] chapter
[42:17] 11 Hebrews
[42:24] 11 verse 5 6 5 and six by faith Enoch
[42:30] was
[42:31] translated that he should not see
[42:35] death and was not
[42:39] found because God had translated
[42:44] him for before his
[42:50] translation he had this
[42:53] testimony that he pleased
[42:58] God but without
[43:01] faith it is impossible to please
[43:06] him for he that cometh to God must
[43:09] believe that he is and that he is a
[43:14] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[43:18] Him may the Lord bless the reading of
[43:22] his word
[43:23] amen let us please be seated
[43:29] so once again we give thanks to the
[43:33] king
[43:36] for sparing Our Lives to see another
[43:41] day amen and uh as we
[43:44] know every passing
[43:47] Day brings the kingdom of God coming of
[43:51] the Lord
[43:53] closer so we are already the year is
[43:57] already half we've closed the uh first
[43:59] quarter I mean first half in this uh
[44:02] second uh we just started the second one
[44:05] which is almost the seventh month is
[44:07] about to End Amen so we are very close
[44:11] to the coming of the Lord amen but then
[44:14] the question also should be to us how
[44:16] close have we come
[44:18] personally amen Every personing Day
[44:20] brings the coming of the Lord closer so
[44:24] every passing day should bring everyone
[44:27] one of us closer to his
[44:29] coming so when we look at ourselves and
[44:33] examine Our Lives how closer have we
[44:39] come how closer are
[44:41] we to his coming as individuals how how
[44:48] much are we prepared how prepared are we
[44:51] because every day brings is coming
[44:53] closer so every day should bring us
[44:56] closer so have we been brought closer
[45:00] have you been brought
[45:03] closer may the Lord help
[45:06] us but that is what we come to church
[45:09] for that's what we hear the word of God
[45:12] for to be brought brought closer to get
[45:16] closer to him reading the Bible singing
[45:20] his Praises worshiping all that we are
[45:23] doing is to be brought brought closer to
[45:26] him am
[45:28] amen may the Lord help us amen so that
[45:31] we will not just be coming and going or
[45:35] just be talking about the coming of the
[45:37] Lord and don't prepare for his
[45:39] coming the scripture told us that Noah
[45:43] moved with
[45:44] fear when he was told he received the
[45:47] message and he was told what to do God
[45:51] revealed to him this is what I'm going
[45:53] to do the end of all All Flesh has come
[45:58] to me this is what I'm going to do but
[46:00] you do this and the scripture tell told
[46:03] us that he moved with fear to prepare
[46:07] himself amen so if we know the Lord is
[46:11] coming and we know the Lord is coming
[46:13] and we don't
[46:14] prepare because he is coming not to ways
[46:18] about and he will be here because we
[46:20] have seen the signs that he promised us
[46:23] right and the things all that we see
[46:27] around signifies and shows us that
[46:30] indeed he's coming and his coming is
[46:34] drawing closer every
[46:37] day may the Lord help us so that you and
[46:43] I will not just oh the Lord is coming
[46:46] the Lord is coming the Lord is coming
[46:48] because the scripture portion of the
[46:50] scripture tells us the servant that
[46:53] knows the will of the master he doesn't
[46:57] do it the master will come and he will
[47:00] be unprepared for that
[47:02] day he said the the Lord of that servant
[47:05] will come and they will be found
[47:09] unprepared so may the Lord help us
[47:13] yesen this morning just to encourage
[47:16] ourselves we speaking
[47:18] on pleasing the father pleasing the Lord
[47:22] by
[47:24] faith Enoch before his
[47:29] translation the Bible
[47:31] said he had this testimony that he
[47:36] pleased the
[47:41] Lord Enoch before his
[47:46] translation the Bible say he walked with
[47:48] God and he was not for God took
[47:52] him and he had a testimony that he
[47:56] pleased God
[47:58] God in his
[48:02] life and we also as we speak about the
[48:06] coming of the Lord the seventh Church
[48:09] age the people that have been called out
[48:11] of this
[48:14] age and we are preparing and
[48:17] looking for changing of our bodies
[48:23] amen as Enoch was translated
[48:27] as he was taken away and he had a
[48:31] testimony so you and I
[48:35] today in everything that we do that we
[48:39] will please the
[48:41] Lord our lord Jesus
[48:45] said I came not from Heaven to do my own
[48:49] will right
[48:51] amen but I came to do the will of him
[48:55] that sent me amen
[48:57] this is very strong for
[48:59] me Emmanuel was made flesh Jehovah was
[49:03] made flesh and when he came here said
[49:06] look I I came not to do my own will he
[49:09] told us in the scripture looks he was
[49:11] speaking to this disciples and he was
[49:13] said for your sakes I sanctify
[49:18] myself he deprived
[49:21] himself he said I sanctify myself for
[49:25] your sakes
[49:28] may God help us that he didn't live for
[49:34] himself he lived and died for
[49:39] us and brother Braham told
[49:42] us Christianity is not living for
[49:45] ourselves
[49:46] right Christianity is living for others
[49:51] even he said to live for the one that if
[49:54] he gets you will kill you
[50:00] I didn't say he said
[50:01] so to live for the one that is against
[50:05] you right amen amen to live for somebody
[50:10] that if he get an opportunity to kill
[50:12] you will kill you
[50:14] am that's very
[50:16] strong but that's what the scripture
[50:19] tells us that's what Jesus told us
[50:22] that's why it said if your enemy is
[50:25] hungry giving food to eat
[50:28] if is thiry giving water to
[50:31] drink he said for in so doing because he
[50:35] how can I give my enemy water and give
[50:37] him food but he also told us in so doing
[50:41] if you are doing this you are rather
[50:45] hipping cuse of fire on that man's
[50:49] head so human mind cannot understand
[50:52] this and this flesh will not take it
[50:57] amen but it has to be God in us to do
[51:03] it amen may the Lord help us
[51:07] amen not to live for
[51:10] ourselves and
[51:12] remember our lord Jesus our savior is
[51:17] more interested in our character than
[51:21] our comfort
[51:26] is more interested in our
[51:29] character than our
[51:36] comfort we all want Comfort but he's
[51:38] more interested in our character because
[51:41] he told us with that character we cannot
[51:44] reign with him amen and he told us that
[51:48] H power with that character is satanic
[51:52] it's of the
[51:53] devil and he told us that no man will
[51:56] share his strong with him except
[52:00] character and he told us that a
[52:03] character is never made without
[52:12] suffering and the suffering comes
[52:15] because the Bible tells us his own
[52:18] character was molded
[52:21] through suffering that comes by
[52:24] obedience to the word of
[52:28] God so obedience to this word of God
[52:32] will make this one to
[52:37] suffer because everyone want to have our
[52:40] own
[52:42] way brother Brown told us our greatest
[52:46] enemy is this one
[52:49] here this one don't want
[52:53] suffering this one will want to have his
[52:55] way
[52:57] so brother Braham said if I can overcome
[53:00] that Willam
[53:03] Bram this fresh if I can overcome him he
[53:07] said because that is my greatest enemy
[53:09] and that is every one of us our greatest
[53:12] enemy
[53:16] amen praise the
[53:19] Lord when I said praise the Lord I
[53:21] didn't say praise Timothy I said praise
[53:23] the Lord so we respond to it hallel
[53:26] Hallelujah yeah yeah we are here
[53:29] together amen so we say praise say yeah
[53:32] amen amen amen be so be let it be the
[53:36] Lord has to be praised amen the Lord
[53:39] must be worshiped the Lord must be
[53:42] glorify amen oh somebody to shout hosana
[53:46] to the king somebody to worship the
[53:48] Living God for that is what we were
[53:51] created for he created us to worship him
[53:56] not to worship ourselves but to worship
[53:59] the Living God to bless the name of the
[54:02] Living God to shout hosana to the Living
[54:05] God to glorify the name of the Living
[54:08] God your savior your healer your
[54:11] deliverer your comforter your way your
[54:15] life your everything is to worship Him
[54:19] Hallelujah for our breath everything
[54:21] comes from him so we should be happy we
[54:24] should worship him we should lose up
[54:27] when we are in the house of the Lord

[54:32] they don't see them as quiet or flowers
[54:37] or whatever whatever they got into the
[54:39] spirit amen and they shout and they sing
[54:44] and sometime even before people come for
[54:46] the soccer of whatever game the
[54:48] supporters already singing and shouting

[55:01] our captain has won for us already the B
[55:04] has been W for us the victory has been W
[55:07] for us we have been declared winners for
[55:10] the scripture says we are more than
[55:12] conquerors you are more than a conqueror
[55:15] so how can a conqueror sit down like you
[55:17] are sitting down
[55:18] today praise you
[55:20] Jesus praise the Lord you are conqueror

[55:26] brother Bram said one time he was

[55:33] him he said if you ever had Victory yes
[55:36] you will worship the Lord you praise the
[55:39] Lord you will sing the Praises of God
[55:41] and he said yes and I remember when they
[55:44] had the Victory and they crossed the Red
[55:46] Sea and Miriam took the tambourine and

[1:10:25] soldiers of the Cross amen I remember a
[1:10:28] story one time in the about one of the

[1:10:32] soldiers and I think whether Israel they
[1:10:35] call him and uh in one of the
[1:10:40] awards he was wounded
[1:10:43] badly and they had to how
[1:10:46] many he was in a tank and was fired and
[1:10:49] he says 60% of his body was bent bent
[1:10:53] they have to do so many surgery on his
[1:10:56] body and then I think just after then I
[1:11:00] think 73 war came he was might be in the
[1:11:02] 63 war and then 73 the young Kon war
[1:11:07] came in and uh he went back to the Army
[1:11:11] he say he has to change something on his
[1:11:12] paper and F said and he went back into
[1:11:15] the army and he was inter why did you do
[1:11:18] that he said when I was young my father
[1:11:22] told me the flag of Israel is in my
[1:11:25] hands I should not let it
[1:11:28] go so in that hour when they were facing
[1:11:32] the syrians at that time on the Goan
[1:11:34] Heights and the syrians were coming with
[1:11:37] their
[1:11:39] tanks hundreds of Syrian tanks and he
[1:11:42] said he was left with Israel had about
[1:11:44] seven tanks or eight
[1:11:46] tanks and he was trying to get his but
[1:11:50] let's go he said nobody was
[1:11:52] going he said let's go so it that he he
[1:11:56] called from the command he spoke to the
[1:11:57] command house or whatever they call it
[1:11:59] they say and they said how many T are
[1:12:01] you left because they were calling for
[1:12:03] Air Force they had to for support and he
[1:12:06] said how many T do you have he said 40
[1:12:08] he said about the seven he said I call
[1:12:10] 40 so that maybe if our enemies were
[1:12:13] able to decode it they would know that
[1:12:15] we still said but they were left with
[1:12:16] seven and nobody the rest of the armies
[1:12:18] the rest of the trunks was were not
[1:12:20] ready to go and instead he said I pray
[1:12:24] he said Lord help me if I can get to the
[1:12:26] other side I will make it and he move
[1:12:28] his tongue that's kalahan I think they
[1:12:30] call him and he begin to move his tongue
[1:12:32] and he was fire just bombing just
[1:12:34] throwing fire fire until fear caught
[1:12:38] hold on the syrians
[1:12:40] yes when he started moving the rest of
[1:12:43] the army be to move after him and they
[1:12:45] were firing and he said God put fear
[1:12:50] upon the syrians and they begin to run
[1:12:53] they were just running away from those
[1:12:55] seven men coming my brothers and my
[1:12:58] sisters may God help us oh stand for
[1:13:01] what you believe amen stand for Jesus he
[1:13:05] will make a way he will make a way he's
[1:13:08] our captain

[1:13:14] faith

[1:13:20] works is
[1:13:22] dead he said as this body
[1:13:25] without life is nothing is dead without
[1:13:29] the spirit is dead the same way faith
[1:13:30] without work is dead so our faith must
[1:13:34] go into
[1:13:40] action he said our action shows what we
[1:13:44] are right and if we say we have
[1:13:48] faith and then afraid to step
[1:13:51] out and claim our faith and put put it
[1:13:55] at work then our faith doesn't do us
[1:14:00] much good
[1:14:02] amen the bible say that faith without
[1:14:05] works is
[1:14:07] dead just as the body without the spirit
[1:14:11] is dead so is faith without that
[1:14:16] works we must believe
[1:14:19] him and as we believe we must act on our
[1:14:23] confession yeah
[1:14:25] yes as we believe we must act on our
[1:14:30] confession and the prophet of God said
[1:14:34] God will make our body obey our
[1:14:41] confession I came not to do my own will
[1:14:44] but the will of him that sent me and we
[1:14:47] should know and remember we are not here
[1:14:51] to do our own will right but we are here
[1:14:54] to do things that pleases him

[1:15:04] pleasing to the
[1:15:08] Lord the way I'm doing as a husband as a
[1:15:11] father as a mother as a
[1:15:14] Believer is that pleasing to the
[1:15:17] Lord Brother Bram

[1:15:22] pleasure that the believer
[1:15:25] is knowing that he is living or doing
[1:15:30] something that pleases the Lord amen

[1:16:36] about this
[1:16:37] flesh there are things that this flesh

[1:16:44] spirit work in the spirit that you will
[1:16:48] not fulfill the desires and the loss of
[1:16:51] the
[1:16:52] flesh for the spirit and the flesh the
[1:16:54] are always at

[1:17:02] alive unto
[1:17:10] Christ may God help
[1:17:13] us God wants to be pleased that's why
[1:17:17] when our Lord is he came here Emmanuel
[1:17:21] he pleased the word it is written on of
[1:17:25] me I came not to do my own way so this
[1:17:28] flesh was brought under this
[1:17:34] word he submitted himself to the will of
[1:17:38] the
[1:17:39] father it has been written he said it is
[1:17:43] written of me it is written of me so
[1:17:47] though he was God he thought it not rly
[1:17:50] to be equal with God but humble himself
[1:17:54] and made made himself of no reputation
[1:17:57] yes he did it he made himself he did
[1:18:02] it he made himself of no reputation he
[1:18:06] laid everything
[1:18:08] down that's why said for their sake I
[1:18:11] sanctify
[1:18:13] myself brother Brandon said he could
[1:18:15] have
[1:18:15] married when he was here in the
[1:18:19] flesh there are many things he could
[1:18:21] have done as a man because he was 100 %
[1:18:25] man and 100%
[1:18:30] God but for your sake and my
[1:18:34] sake he submitted himself to the will of
[1:18:37] the
[1:18:40] father and he pleased the Father the
[1:18:43] bible say that go God spoke about said
[1:18:45] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:18:48] pleased to do it
[1:18:51] am he submitted himself and the father
[1:18:55] was pleased to dwell in him he said
[1:18:58] would it be wonderful that if every one
[1:19:00] of us come to that spot where the father
[1:19:04] will be
[1:19:05] pleased to dwell in
[1:19:10] US submitting to God's word to please
[1:19:14] the father not to please the flesh not
[1:19:17] to please
[1:19:21] ourselves he said the Sheep has one
[1:19:24] thing thing is
[1:19:27] wo and he submit himself to the sherff
[1:19:31] that's what Jesus
[1:19:33] did he submitted himself as a sheep
[1:19:37] before the sherff and he did not open
[1:19:40] his
[1:19:41] mouth they accuse him accuse him accuse
[1:19:44] him until even pilot Mar
[1:19:47] said don't you he what that they are
[1:19:51] saying all this you don't say anything
[1:19:58] he spoke and he told them don't you
[1:20:01] think in G man when they came to arrest
[1:20:03] him and he told Peter said put your
[1:20:05] sword
[1:20:07] back put it back oh they thought they
[1:20:10] were defending him he said that's not a
[1:20:12] way to defend me amen put your sword
[1:20:15] back amen don't fight anybody amen he
[1:20:18] said don't you think I can speak to my
[1:20:21] father right and he will send 12 Legions
[1:20:24] to come down now but how then will the
[1:20:28] scriptures be
[1:20:33] fulfilled the
[1:20:35] scriptures the word the prophecy the
[1:20:39] visions of the Lord that which has been
[1:20:42] spoken that which have been prophesied
[1:20:45] that he has come to know what he came on
[1:20:48] Earth to do because he said my will is
[1:20:52] to do my food is to to do the will of
[1:20:55] him that sent me am that of all that he
[1:20:57] has given me I should lose N I should
[1:21:00] keep all of them so he knew why he
[1:21:03] came and because he knew why he came
[1:21:05] that is why even Peter when he spoke
[1:21:08] that he was going to get Stoney and he
[1:21:10] spoke about what is going to be done to
[1:21:12] him how they will be denied how he will
[1:21:14] be persecuted how they will kill him and
[1:21:16] what Peter said no no no no don't say
[1:21:19] that don't we want you to stay here with
[1:21:21] us he said Dad behind me Satan am
[1:21:26] you don't know what you are talking
[1:21:28] about he knew why he came here so he did
[1:21:32] not allow his closest
[1:21:34] friend to interrupt
[1:21:37] it to stand on his
[1:21:40] way his friends he didn't allow them he
[1:21:44] did not even allow his parent uh Joseph
[1:21:46] and Mary when he was one day preaching
[1:21:49] and Joseph and Mary
[1:21:52] came said maybe the people have SP
[1:21:54] spoking so much about Jesus go and see
[1:21:56] what your son is doing go and see what
[1:21:58] he's preaching be beating people in
[1:22:03] church are we together

[1:22:10] is blaspheming do you know what he has
[1:22:12] done again he went to church with whip
[1:22:16] and he beat the people out of the church
[1:22:18] and he was kicking everything in the
[1:22:21] church so what kind of spirit is this
[1:22:24] yeah right yes
[1:22:27] sir and they would have gone to you
[1:22:29] better call your son and speak to your
[1:22:32] son because what he's doing is becoming
[1:22:34] too much

[1:22:41] because even when he was being dedicated
[1:22:43] there was a prophecy said many arrows
[1:22:45] shall pierce your
[1:22:47] soul when Simon was dedicating it to you
[1:22:52] many arrows will pierce your soul
[1:22:56] because they will be speaking all kinds
[1:22:57] of things they will see all kinds of
[1:22:59] things oh god oh they will say all kinds
[1:23:03] of
[1:23:05] things are we together am I remember
[1:23:09] when we got this message and believe

[1:23:23] they are saying this and that condemn
[1:23:24] even the pastors and

[1:23:29] soul so people come with complain people
[1:23:32] can't with complain people can't we and
[1:23:34] Mary they came and the brothers they
[1:23:36] came he Jesus was preaching they said

[1:30:38] asked for Isaac
[1:30:41] right God asks for something you have to
[1:30:45] give that to him that's why brother BR
[1:30:46] say he said Moses take off your shoe he
[1:30:49] didn't say take up your
[1:30:52] heart what God demand
[1:30:54] what God requests that's why we

[1:31:15] why you don't ask question you
[1:31:18] follow brother BR said Faith always
[1:31:22] acknowledges the word to be the truth
[1:31:26] right Faith don't reason Faith bases on
[1:31:30] the word God said
[1:31:32] so so Abraham obeyed yes he took his son
[1:31:38] you have to work for three
[1:31:40] days three
[1:31:43] days in the jungles climbing the hills
[1:31:47] climbing the mountain the word was not
[1:31:49] like this
[1:31:50] today talk about how many years back
[1:31:53] three to four th000 years
[1:31:55] back and they have to walk how many
[1:31:57] people were in the in the word at that
[1:31:59] time and they have to walk walk and talk
[1:32:03] about white animals here and there
[1:32:05] everywhere but Faith don't question
[1:32:09] Faith don't reason and Faith don't
[1:32:14] fear Faith hangs on the word God say so
[1:32:18] and if God said it God is
[1:32:21] responsible if God said I should
[1:32:23] sacrifice my son and God said go here it
[1:32:26] is God's responsibility to see to it
[1:32:29] that I get
[1:32:35] there oh there are many things you we
[1:32:37] want to understand and we don't
[1:32:39] understand but listening sometime we

[1:34:14] done and is quiet is just testing you

[1:34:27] say here sacrifice your son and God was
[1:34:32] watching there might be a lot of battles
[1:34:34] in the mind of Abraham because the
[1:34:36] greatest battle that is fought is fought
[1:34:38] in the
[1:34:38] mind what is this what is that
[1:34:42] but he had a revelation of God he
[1:34:46] believed in God you know that I don't
[1:34:48] understand sure you come to a point what
[1:34:50] is this it seems is contradictory
[1:34:53] God said out of Isaac your seed will be
[1:34:56] called God said sacrifice
[1:35:00] Isaac I can how can you put this two
[1:35:03] things together you said out of Isaac my
[1:35:06] shall be called now you said I should
[1:35:08] sacrifice him maybe Isaac himself would
[1:35:10] have asked his father Papa but you told
[1:35:12] me God told you that um your seed will
[1:35:15] be C through me say yes God told me I
[1:35:18] believe it about now Papa i c you now

[1:35:42] to whom shall we go even though we don't
[1:35:45] understand and we cannot explain
[1:35:46] everything but we
[1:35:49] believe like the woman said sir I
[1:35:52] perceive you are a
[1:35:57] prophet and even though the 7 went away

[1:36:35] mind and get the mind of Christ am if
[1:36:39] you don't lose your mind you can never
[1:36:41] serve God because the Bible tells us
[1:36:44] that God choose the foolishness of
[1:36:49] preaching the way of the Cross is
[1:36:52] foolish to those who have perishing so
[1:36:55] if you don't lose your mind you can

[1:37:16] is Faith when everything explain why is
[1:37:18] your faith God don't need to explain
[1:37:21] nothing if because of that you would not
[1:37:23] serve God

[1:37:29] come and serve him oh his children will
[1:37:30] serve him amen he's choosing we sering
[1:37:34] yes Peter said to whom shall we go we
[1:37:36] don't understand but we
[1:37:39] believe oh you think you have to be baby
[1:37:43] every day I come to church no no no no
[1:37:46] no if you don't can go somebody will
[1:37:49] come here Jesus said if this will hold
[1:37:51] their peace the stones will cry

[1:37:58] will bring somebody
[1:38:00] there because the foundation of God
[1:38:02] stand sure and God knoweth those that
[1:38:05] are his and God's people will believe no
[1:38:09] matter what
[1:38:13] amen

[1:38:20] God he didn't explain to Abraham m-

[1:38:43] it Go oby hallelujah oh what a day that
[1:38:49] will be and then after obedience Abraham
[1:38:52] put his son there and then just as he
[1:38:54] took the S go hey Abraham don't do any
[1:38:59] evil to your son now I know that you
[1:39:03] love me more than Isaac more than
[1:39:07] yourself look behind you just at that
[1:39:11] time he look behind where did I came
[1:39:15] from Brother BR said in the crucial
[1:39:18] moment in the moment of time God
[1:39:22] provided Hallelujah
[1:39:24] in the it was not there
[1:39:26] before but at the hour of
[1:39:30] need and in your hour of need you might
[1:39:33] not know how it will come where it will
[1:39:36] be coming from but it will come amen it
[1:39:39] will make a way and then God said now I
[1:39:43] know you love
[1:39:44] me and because you have obeyed my
[1:39:50] voice in blessing I will bless you in
[1:39:54] multiply I will multiply you because you
[1:39:57] have obeyed my
[1:40:00] voice may God help
[1:40:02] us Abraham pleased the Lord amen by
[1:40:06] obedience amen the Bible say by faith
[1:40:11] Abraham by faith Moses by faith Enoch by
[1:40:16] faith all of them Faith no explanation
[1:40:18] faith
[1:40:26] pleasing the Lord by
[1:40:28] faith God don't need to explain anything
[1:40:31] to us no we come by faith and brother
[1:40:36] Bram said that is revelation and he said
[1:40:39] it makes a difference in everything that
[1:40:41] we
[1:40:42] do Revelation makes a difference he said
[1:40:45] he made a difference between King and
[1:40:47] Abel they all receive order to go and
[1:40:50] sacrifice but Abel by revelation offered
[1:40:53] unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
[1:40:58] King so Revelation makes a differ in our
[1:41:02] lives in our worship every one of
[1:41:07] us the way you are doing things the way
[1:41:10] we are handling things shows what
[1:41:12] revelation we have
[1:41:14] yes we don't serve god with slackness
[1:41:18] amen the Bible say we should serve the
[1:41:21] Lord with all our heart with all your
[1:41:24] might with all your soul and everything
[1:41:28] that is in
[1:41:31] us hallelujah may God help you Brothers
[1:41:36] may God help you my sisters may God

[1:41:52] pain
[1:41:53] serve the
[1:41:57] Lord the prophet of God said sometime
[1:42:01] God allows disappointment to come to see
[1:42:04] what you will do
[1:42:07] right he said the Christian life seems
[1:42:10] to hold a lot of disappointments amen he
[1:42:14] say if one is not
[1:42:16] absolutely centered on the word it seem
[1:42:20] the Christian life holds a lot of
[1:42:22] disappoint ments but the prophet said
[1:42:26] those
[1:42:27] disappointments are God's Divine will
[1:42:31] happening to us he said it might not
[1:42:34] look like that but it
[1:42:36] is whether in sickness whether in life
[1:42:40] whether in death will serve the Lord
[1:42:42] that's why job said I know my redeemer
[1:42:46] liveth he said even though he slays me
[1:42:48] yet I will trust him and job was a
[1:42:51] righteous man and job was holy and J was
[1:42:55] prayerful and job was committed and God
[1:42:57] was proud of him oh Hallelujah and
[1:43:00] brother Bram said if you have a trial
[1:43:03] you find favor with God yes sir he said
[1:43:06] if you have a trial God has confidence
[1:43:08] in you as he had confidence in job and
[1:43:11] God knows you will stand the
[1:43:17] test Hallelujah we should stand gallant

[1:43:26] Believer no matter how little is what it
[1:43:30] might be he said he will stand on that
[1:43:32] word no matter he said the Wiest
[1:43:34] Christian the weakest so let's take me
[1:43:37] said me I'm the Wiest Christian but the
[1:43:39] wicked Christian will stand on the word
[1:43:41] and defeat the Devil to the

[1:48:34] okay
[1:48:36] hallelujah oh praise the Lord and and
[1:48:38] and and when they were to put him into
[1:48:41] the lion's den and and the King said
[1:48:44] something I preached on it one and the
[1:48:46] King told
[1:48:48] Daniel Daniel servant of the Living God
[1:48:52] May your God whom you Faithfully serve
[1:48:55] may he deliver you from the
[1:48:57] Lions the king says so right the king
[1:49:01] knew Daniel was serving God Faithfully
[1:49:03] yes
[1:49:04] Hallelujah and God delivered
[1:49:07] Daniel Hallelujah by faith he pleased
[1:49:12] the
[1:49:15] Lord from his
[1:49:17] childhood when he was in
[1:49:20] Babylon and they purpose in the their
[1:49:22] heart we are not going to defy ourselves
[1:49:25] we are not going to dress like other
[1:49:27] women are dressing we are not going to
[1:49:29] walk the way they are doing things we
[1:49:31] are not going to paint our faces we are
[1:49:33] not going to make our all this kind of
[1:49:36] high heels and whatever listen the
[1:49:38] message has not changed remember that
[1:49:41] the message if you are reading the
[1:49:42] message remember the message has not
[1:49:44] changed like this Bible has never
[1:49:46] changed that's this old Bible
[1:49:52] it has never changed the message has not
[1:49:55] changed God's word has not changed you
[1:49:58] may change things for yourself but the
[1:50:00] word of God has not changed whatever God
[1:50:03] condemn yesterday God condemn it today
[1:50:06] whatever the prophet brought to us under
[1:50:08] the inspiration is the same today am if
[1:50:10] you move away from it if you have done
[1:50:13] it it's said get back amen back to the
[1:50:16] line again back when the prophet had
[1:50:20] that Vision over there and he saw some
[1:50:22] going out of steps yes he said get back
[1:50:27] stay in the
[1:50:28] line why the word has not
[1:50:33] change oh God help us hallelujah it is
[1:50:37] our testing time whether we are going to
[1:50:40] stay with it or whether we are going to
[1:50:42] give up that's right whether we are
[1:50:44] going to stay with it or we are going to
[1:50:45] compromise whether we are going to stay
[1:50:47] with it or we are going to do what
[1:50:48] everybody is doing amen it's our testing
[1:50:51] time amen because there is pressure on
[1:50:54] the people today in everybody under some
[1:50:57] kind of pressure and that is pushing
[1:50:59] people into all kinds of things to do
[1:51:02] all kinds of things to let down the B to
[1:51:04] compromise on the word here and there
[1:51:06] but it's our test are you also going to
[1:51:09] compromise are you also going to give up
[1:51:12] may God help us not to give up not to
[1:51:14] compromise but stand and say I know whom
[1:51:18] I believed
[1:51:20] amen I am persuaded
[1:51:23] is
[1:51:25] able to keep
[1:51:27] what I have committed to his
[1:51:30] trust against that day you make a way
[1:51:34] sometime it seems we come to
[1:51:36] disappointment here and there but God
[1:51:38] allows it just after that he shows his
[1:51:40] glory
[1:51:42] yes they came to the re
[1:51:45] oh
[1:51:47] oh what is this oh and they look behind

[1:53:34] prophet Malachi prophesy that our hearts
[1:53:36] will be turned to the heart of the

[1:58:20] Hallelujah prise God God
[1:58:23] bless really app
[1:58:28] that that was double
[1:58:31] barrel
[1:58:36] automatic I wrote down here that I'm
[1:58:39] going to bring my notebook next time I
[1:58:41] need more than a piece of paper here
[1:58:44] that was so
[1:58:45] rich
[1:58:47] um you know something I I just thought
[1:58:50] about just now our brother was speaking
[1:58:52] here but we think about Enoch that he
[1:58:56] walked close with the Lord then he was
[1:58:58] like translated which was going which is
[1:58:59] going to H which did happen right and it
[1:59:02] is a type of the Bride being translated
[1:59:06] in this age but as our brother was
[1:59:09] speaking it just kind of opened up to me
[1:59:11] a little bit more that our walk we are
[1:59:15] being translated in our walk yes the
[1:59:18] Bible says we are changed from Glory
[1:59:21] unto Glory amen when we come to church
[1:59:23] we hear the word actually change happens
[1:59:25] in our life amen and we we don't want to
[1:59:28] be just looking for that day we want to
[1:59:30] be looking for the for the next word to
[1:59:33] come forth and change us just a little
[1:59:35] bit because if we see that change
[1:59:37] happening a little bit it gives us I
[1:59:39] think that faith that we're going to
[1:59:41] need for the Rapture amen amen let's
[1:59:44] stand together and I I like how our
[1:59:47] brother started off he asked that
[1:59:49] question how close are we to the Lord
[1:59:53] and I think after this message we could
[1:59:56] ask ourselves the same question how
[1:59:58] close are we to the Lord I feel like I
[2:00:01] mean I know that I need a closer walk
[2:00:03] with the Lord at the beginning of the
[2:00:05] service but after the word came forth it
[2:00:07] just like spoke I need a much closer
[2:00:10] walk with the
[2:00:11] Lord amen it's so so
[2:00:15] challenging so challenging that word I
[2:00:18] believe challenged us today let's sing
[2:00:20] all hail King Jesus

[2:00:27] prayer I know our brother will pray with
