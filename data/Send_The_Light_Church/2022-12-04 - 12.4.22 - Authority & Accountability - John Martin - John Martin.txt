and we thank you in advance for answering these prayers and we thank you for being faithful unto us Lord we ask all these things Jesus Christ and we pray amen brother Johnson has an announcement for us if you like to come up brother seems like there's some miss it either way I'm so happy to be here uh I had a choice of spending the day with my wife my my daughter spent all night with her and Mark he tried to see her last night and they would let him go because she was still in the emergency part of the hospital and so uh they only allowed two two visits all day in the emergency but they moved to a room because when they heard that Lucia wanted to spend the night with her they they quickly got a room and so Lucille spent the night Marx spending this morning I'll be spending all afternoon I just want to let you know I I had the address of the hospital in case somebody wanted to send her a card but I couldn't find it when I got here so anyway it's the U of M oh I hear uh only say my wife really has enjoyed coming to the church here she's felt welcome and she's enjoyed the ministry and uh so because when they when they sold the church that I pastored for 65 years ah I was very hurt ah but I'm not going to dwell on on tribulation or disappointments uh but I've been feeling like a fish out of the water you know how fish when it's out of the water and this well that's the way I felt because God sent me to Ann Arbor by Vision in 1954 I was praying with two young men in Tupelo Mississippi in a prayer room at the Bible school where I met my wife and uh man that was a great treasure and we're we're now we're now working on our 70th year amen so she's been so faithful but uh I I just need your prayer because this morning I woke up between four and five o'clock praying for Taiwan I don't know what that means that's one country I've never been to I was invited to Hong Kong probably 10 or 15 years ago and I'm so sorry now I didn't go there because it's not free now but my cow their country makes to China which is only two hours from Hong Kong there they're now allowing preachers to preach in the street and we have two Filipino brothers that are going there and preaching and I need you to really pray that God will direct them uh about 20 years ago I I had such a burden for Macau said I learned about a radio station and so I I sent tapes over there for three years ah but I didn't have anyone to put the tapes in this into Chinese language and so it wasn't a waste of money because we got we got mail that even some in prison received the Lord amen but uh uh God said his word wouldn't return void but I still got those tapes if I can get if I can get them translated into Chinese there'll be a simple message not a whole lot of introduction of brother Brennan but you know Saints let me just tell you brother branham's Ministry is something special you've heard brother John uh you know referring and and I appreciate brother Sean Martin we're here because this was the this was the one church that I felt brother John was so faithful when he attended was a deacon in the church for many years and and uh well anyway he would want me to say a whole lot but a special request for brother Eric Rogers uh he he came to the Lord about four years ago and uh receive the Lord but he needs the Holy Spirit and he was he promised me he would be at my house this morning at 9 15 now 8 45 to come with Brother Bruce and I and that was one reason I wanted to be here to introduce you to him but pray for him because he's he needs to have a revelation of baptism he didn't he doesn't resent the name of Jesus baptism but maybe you don't understand the importance he that believeth and is baptized should be saved makes it pretty important you know but uh let's let's just pray that he'll come uh Brother Bruce not going to be able to drive very much longer but he has a car and he asked for the address this morning so I think he'll be coming here so pray for him he's uh ah he's a little less than 50 years old but he's like a young man he's one brother that's been a great a great blessing to me uh so I gotta hurry here because I'm looking forward to hear the word this morning saying about a hunger for the word Hallelujah so uh just remember uh brother Hart is leaving for the mission field within a week now he's going to be spending three months in the Philippines and by the heart came to me probably 35 40 years ago complaining because he had no more to preach he was just a young preacher come out of Vietnam and and he he said the brothers in this message are so studied and they can preach the word and quote brother Branham and so forth and he felt he felt unneeded I said to him have you considered the mission feel Oh my he was shocked but he prayed for a solid year maybe even longer call me up said I'm gonna have to go to the Philippines because I I said hey they they speak English there anyway he went through a breakdown because his wife well I'm not going to go into any details but anyway his wife has been dead now several years and and he almost had a breakdown but he's reconsecrated his heart and life to the Lord and he's he's actually sacrificing a lot of personal money that they work and send to the Philippines remember him and I want to let you know I guess brother John's not in yet but Mission money that we left here for brother Stephen Queener uh it didn't get there in time so they closed the radio broadcast that I've been sponsoring for quite a while remember brother Stephen Queener uh his family is just one of the most precious he's got five children but he he went as a refugee over to Ghana which is two countries over from Liberia where he lived when they were having Civil War and a lot of people fled the country because of the war was all over the country and I went there with the burden to preach and I got there to the airport and the Holy Spirit said this is not the time I said Lord I'm here this is not the time and I thought maybe it was because the war had come into the capital city because I had flown into the capital so I stayed one night I left but the Lord let me go back and so we've been able to minister to about five churches in the country but uh brother queena received the Lord over in Ghana and as soon as they a war that was over he come back to his country with his five children maybe he didn't have five right then but anyway he preached in the first big city and has some converts he baptized them then he didn't want to leave him so he stayed in that City and anyway I could tell you a lot of things about it but I'm not going to I'm just going close with maybe the first three verses of of a Hebrews this morning and I'm going to sit down I'd appreciate the opportunity to say a few words I do want to say that I have a promise that the brothers oh the ministry that took the congregation away from Ann Arbor they're about 30 miles away probably but they've promised to sit down with me and I just want to have peace with all people I just I just I will not allow bitterness to come in my heart no matter what people do because we're too close to the end time but my heart's bleeding to try to win some souls and so let's keep praying for brother Larry you know he got a track somehow from our church when he was in prison and uh he hailed that track for 40 years and finally decided to look up the church and I was coming right in behind him and I said welcome because I knew they'd never been there before welcome and he said do you know anything about guanum and I said you mean William Branham yeah and he pulled this truck out he said I've been hanging onto this track for 40 years he said so it was a little track that the Lord uh put upon brother writes to he was working for a printing company and they give him permission to print the tracks uh not old company time but if he wanted to work at night or Saturday or Sunday and he was living in Mississippi didn't have a home Church there but he was printing messages then he moved to Ann Arbor and the last he told me they were he counted the countries that we'd sent the tracks to and there was 77 countries amen so just pray that somebody else will hang on to amen the Lord bless you I just want to read these verses God who had Sunder times and in diverse manners spoken time passed unto the fathers by the prophets half in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he whom he hath appointed heir of all things that's talking about you now heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds one more verse who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself pursed our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high God bless you this morning thank you for the time and so uh I could spend an hour but I'll looking forward to hear Brother John preach amen God be with you is our prayer amen thank you brother probably the scene come let us adore him oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore him Christ the Lord will praise His name forever will praise His name for him ever will praise His name for it forever Christ the lord will give him all the glory we'll give him all the glory Lord will give him all the glory cry the Lord for he alone is Worthy for he alone is worthy for he alone is [Applause] [Music] O come let us adore him oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore him Christ the lord so glad I'm Yours who's thankful for that [Music] amen so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm you so glad your mercy has followed me so glad you found me and set me free so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm Yours just claim it so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm you so glad your mercy

only real peace that I have did Lord is in you in all life's frustrations I need you I know I do for the only peace that I have did Lord is and you sing it one more time the only that I have dear Lord is in you the only repeats that I have dear Lord is in you it all lies frustrations I need you I know I do the only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you just bow our heads just take the tithes up before the Lord oh Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for providing this beautiful building for us Lord just thank you for providing everything that we have need of Lord you know what we have need of Lord we just give our tithes On To You Lord we want to just give with a cheerful heart Lord because you've given us all these things a job a car a roof over our heads Lord and we're so thankful and grateful for that Lord and may we never forget Lord where everything that we have comes from it comes from you Lord and Lord Jesus we just want to honor you by giving these ties unto you because you're worthy of them all Lord and we just thank you and ask all these things in Jesus Christ and we pray amen your brother just a moment um we wanted to show some pictures we're a little bit behind on the reports that have been coming in but these are some pictures from a pastor in Sarah gold Island Philippines and we had helped build the church after the a typhoon that they had late last year it just a little something we also have some more from the Philippines but we just haven't had time to to put them together but just wanted to encourage you to keep praying for those Saints there not all of them have been restored uh but we're grateful for what God you know has done just keep keep praying um we're also happy to announce that our our live stream is a little bit louder now so um we're grateful that the Lord had helped Ann to figure that out and uh um we can have a little bit more confidence if we can't not make it so hopefully those that are live streaming right now can can hear better um also there's an address card in the back for brother Iran Huskers family Dawns his wife if we want to send a sympathy card to the family I know they would appreciate it or she said her children would appreciate it so brother Ron was as faithful as he could be to the church and uh I'm looking forward to seeing him on the other side and uh I believe it would just be encouraging to the family the testimony as well um if you would feel in your heart to send them a card amen brother Jason Demars had contacted us and said that he is setting up some meetings in Egypt in February so if you could be in special prayer about those meetings amen amen amen let's stand together for the reading of the word we appreciate brother Johnson and let's uh be in prayer about that work um God doesn't close for brother queen of God does not close any doors without opening heaven in mind to open a new door and he opens a door that no man can close so we just trust the leadership of the Lord but we're we're it just to me we're fortunate to find people who are willing to work for the Lord and we just want to support and and help them the best that we can amen and if we could turn to the Book of Romans chapter 13 I want to say it's good to see everyone here this morning God bless you should have said that the very first thing but I'm so I I so often forget to read the announcements and things that so that's that's why amen Romans chapter 13 we're going to read two verses here the first two verses and have a word of Prayer let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of God whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God in they that resist shall receive to themselves damn Nation amen let's just buy our hearts in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we're bowing not on AirHeads but our hearts to the higher power this morning we want to thank you for your presence in this place that we could come and hear testimonies of all that you're doing Lord to to hear prayer requests to those that we need to be praying for and to be gathered together with those of light precious faith and to have the opportunity to worship you with one another Lord we thank you for this great privilege that you've given us and we thank you Lord that you've given us the this wonderful privilege to open the Bible and to read these holy words unworthy to look upon them Lord but you said that we would be blessed if we would just read them and we've read them today and Lord we're asking Lord for your blessings upon this word to our hearts Lord we're here because we want to be closer to you we want to be ready in that hour that you would call us now pray for every heart Lord not only here but those that are watching the live stream May there may there be just a faith special for them their situation drop into their Heart Lord that needs could be met father Lord we commit ourself and we commit this service we pray that Lord that you would reveal yourself to us this morning we thank you for all these things and give you praise in Jesus precious name amen amen God bless you may be seated amen the word is the highest power it's the spiritual supreme justice of everything it's our absolute it's what will judge God's creation in the last day even Jesus himself said in Saint John chapter 12 I've not come to judge the world but to save the world but he that rejecteth me and rejecteth my word have one that uh judgeth him the word that I've spoken the same shall judge him in the last day so the word is the highest power amen this message this morning is to really help us with our spiritual walk with God and if we struggle at times with authority and accountability I believe God wants to help us I don't don't you believe we all struggle with it from time to time amen I may if you're if you're you're honest uh I believe you agree with that statement Jesus prayed that with his disciples would become one with him as Jesus was with the father and that requires being under subjection to the higher powers brother Brandon said in this age there's an invisible Union taking place with a the Earthly bride and the spiritual bridegroom and it requires being under subjection to the higher powers to come into that Union I want this message to help stir Us in the right direction I like to entitle it Authority and accountability Authority and accountability everyone wants to see others held accountable husbands want to see their wives held accountable wives want to see their husbands held accountable parents want to see their children held accountable children want to hold their appearance accountable I mean everybody said well I'm not going to raise my children like my parents did employers want to hold their employees accountable and employees want to hold their employer accountable that's that's why we got uh what do they call that Union right the government wants to hold the people accountable pay your taxes the people want to hold the government accountable don't take advantage of us so everyone wants to see others held accountable but when it comes to holding ourselves accountable accountable our carnal nature wants to avoid Authority marriage without accountability is missing the important aspect of love think about that marriage without accountability is missing an important aspect of love home without accountability family without accountability a church without accountability is missing an important aspect of love we don't have to be afraid of accountability we don't John 3 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth him should not perish but have everlasting life we think about God's great love Jesus said no greater love than this than a man laid on his life for his friends for God so love the world that he gave but there's a part of God's love that we don't like to think about and Revelation 3 19 tells us what that is as as many as I love I rebuke and chasten these Alias therefore and repent so when God rebukes us when God chastens us when God speaks to us about something he wants change it is truly God loving man and and we we look at too much as a negative thing and we need to look at it as a positive thing amen now a Believer who's walking with a carnal mindset has a tendency of thinking that all the ways that God would be uh towards them should be ways of blessing them and helping them and just meeting their needs and this is how God shows love it's often missing in indebtedness for what God has already done for them because when you feel that indebtedness you automatically want to give more back to God you want to obey more of the word you want to be a servant now if we fail to view God's law balanced will always be battling that we don't have to do anything more than what we're doing amen remember God's unconditional love will always be coupled with correction which means there's always something more that God wants us to do the reason is True Divine love never wants us to remain the same way we are character building is on God's mind for us for his bride and they that have the mind of Christ will be pressing towards that Mark so as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and be zealous therefore and repent this is not just for Sinners but it's for the church and I'll say it like this is especially for the bride she will receive the most correction out of all believers the bride will she will repent more she will be good at repenting Jesus told his own disciples after walking and teaching them three and a half years I have many things to say unto you but you can't bear it now think about that three and a half years after all the teaching there's a part of God's love that's hard to accept [Music] and it really comes against our carnal nature and if we're not careful our carnal nature will blind us for what true love is and then we'll always have a negative feeling and be negative about correction verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he will not speak of himself for whatsoever he shall hear that shall he's speaking that he will show you things to come he you know a lot of times Spirits are speaking to us and they're always speaking the devil is always trying to pump us up it's always trying to get us to think about us but when the spirit of truth comes it's not it's going to be lifting up Christ and it's going to be lifting uh uh it's going to be bringing us more under subjection to the word they become more like the word because he's going to be leading us into all truth but here's the thing we can't bear all the truth the wonderful thing is now the Holy Ghost if you have the Holy Ghost now you can you can take more you're not so bothered you're not so offended you're not so well what's this again the Holy Ghost is what Embraces all the truth it's the only thing that can take it amen for as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and be zealous therefore and repent flesh really doesn't like this part of God's love true we don't enjoy it we don't like it preached we don't want to talk about it we don't want to discuss it we don't even want to think about it all leading to have the tendency to forget about the Holy Ghost intimacy that he has with us think about it it takes you know a lot of times we're afraid to tell somebody something because we don't want them gone right all right and to know that the Holy Ghost has Liberty to speak to us about our things that we need to correct that to me is intimate because when you know you can just talk to anybody talk to someone about anything you know there is a closeness there and God if we are his bride there's something special that there is between you and God and intimacy where he can come and speak to you about the things that he needs to see corrected in your life let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of God and the powers that be our ordained of God naturally we're supposed to be under subjection to the laws of the land and spiritually we're supposed to be under subjection to the word of God so whosoever therefore resisteth the power resists the orns of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation now a good example of this is the the children of Israel when they were in the wilderness they uh resisted the powers of God they resisted following the word and the word just honestly kept saying go get the Holy Ghost go get the Holy Ghost go get the Holy Ghost that is what the word was saying and it just it their hearts became hard and their ears became dull of hearing and they they wanted to do their own thing right but after saving the people that came out of Egypt the Bible says he destroyed them that believed not right and hear the scriptures saying they that resist shall receive to them self damnation so we see there is a there's a there's a fear there this should should put a fear of God inside of us to make sure that we don't miss one thing that the word is speaking to us now Authority is a good thing but it can also seem like a bad thing because a bunch of examples here we're glad when Authority is stopping some threat to burn down our school but we're not so happy when that same school sends extra homework home that requires our help with the children amen we're glad when Authority will pull someone over for a road rage but we're not so glad when when we're pulled over for speeding same Authority right but we're viewing it different we're glad when the government gives us a stimulus check but we're not so happy when that same Authority demands us to pay our taxes some may want to defund the the police for various reasons but they'll probably come a time that they wish they had the police to help them we're glad when the authority lets us off with just a warning for speeding anybody ever got that before but we're not so happy when that same Authority holds us accountable to obey the law we're glad when the authority of Jesus gives us unmerited Grace for our sins his mercies are new each day but we're not so glad when that same Authority demands us to keep his Commandments see you're the the very the very uh result of your amens proves what I'm saying [Laughter] we want the authority of God's word to Deliver Us From The Devils that torment our lives but we're not very interested in coming in subjection to the authority of that same word when it speaks to us what we need to be doing some people want God to bless them with a lot of money but they struggle with giving that money back to God some people want God to supply their needs but they struggle with putting God first in their lives and helping others right we could say Authority is a two-edged sword sometimes it's in favor of our flesh and sometimes it's not in favor of our flesh but God's Authority is actually sharper than any two-edged sword amen most people do not enjoy authority over them it's understandable but some refuse Authority they hate it they just can't handle someone over them telling them what to do you'll find them being critical or finding fault or looking for some reason not to be subject Lucifer was the first one to hate Authority he was the first one to use his influence against Authority to undermine Authority his selfish goal was to undermine and disrupt true Authority in order to get others to follow him instead of following God's order the fact is we cannot be in order with god without being under Authority remember that statement God always has an order in his kingdom and it won't change brother Brandon said that if if you are a prophet on this side you're going to be a prophet on that side every parent wants their children to obey in order for things to be right there has to be Authority and accountability one without the other will not be successful it'll bring confusion well Dad Mom said it was okay for me to do it well I'm telling you it's not okay understand confusion God's word is the same yesterday today and forever there should be no confusion with God's word if you're finding confusion with God's word get back on your knees get in his presence go back and read it go back and listen to it God is not the author of confusion children are commanded to obey their parents that their days would be extended and children need to learn to obey regardless if they agree or not agree [Music] in other words God loves to see respect yes regardless if the parent is right or wrong wives are commanded to obey their husbands in all things even when they are wrong God loves to see respect amen he loves to see order in the homes and God will correct the husband he will correct the husband mothers are commend to love their children properly to love their father to love their children's father to be a keeper of the home mothers play an important part all these are requiring Authority and accountability husbands are committed to love their wives to the same degree that Christ loved the church and gave himself for it to dwell with them in wisdom and to meet their every need praise God Amen amen fathers are command to love their children not to provoke them to anger in a church it's no different the Holy Ghost is our head the word is our Spiritual Authority brother Brandon preached Church order and that is was to stop the confusion that was in the church that's what it was for foreign and he told us that we just go back to that he said there wouldn't be a new one in 2020. right right no God is the same yesterday to him forever God has given the church the office of a pastor brother Brandon said is that that office will lead you through now God uses this office more than we realize to speak to us many things but we limit God when we limit the office I'll tell you write that down you that struggle you limit God when you limit the office when God uses this office God ought to be respected with accountability to what he is speaking because it's a Spiritual Authority it's not the man you got to get your eyes off the man because that's the hiccup and I don't say any one of us here got these problems but look for instance if you can't respect your pastor if you don't like your pastor if you don't agree with your pastor it's going to be extremely difficult for you to be under subjection to the Spiritual Authority that that office holds amen amen that's why you're hindering yourself because you're being carnal with what's being preached as much as we might find fault or disagreement or dissatisfaction God has an office where he speaks to us and you can't be little well I'm just going to get it off the tapes you know when you with that attitude you know when you listen to those tapes you're just cherry picking what you want to hear because if you weren't when you're listening to those tapes I'll tell you take you to your knees and repent and be zealous to say God help me fill me with your spirit today preach I always believe that if a person believes that God has led them to the wrong pastor then they really need to pray until they find the leadership to get to the right one because that man is ordained to lead you through God wants us in order under a Spiritual Authority not under a man but under the holy ghosts operating through the different offices amen now what is your pastor's responsibility now I want you to be honest with me and I just want to grab your attention and is it to help help us with all of our natural needs is it to fix all of our natural problems is it to supply all that we naturally are lacking no but do we look at our pastor that way have we looked at our pastor have we gone to our pastor for the natural right be that the shows were staring at that office in a natural way and this is I just want to be down to earth and and connect with us very seldom to somebody come to me and say I have a spiritual need with My Soul all right but what is the pastor for what what's he for a pastor's office is a spiritual office it holds a Spiritual Authority for Spiritual needs sometimes that office brings consolation and comfort as we're being fed or one-on-one and sometimes that office will hold us accountable to the word correct God uses this office for the ministry of our souls that is why we're here we're here for our souls but we don't focus on that much we come to church because we're supposed to come to church we don't come to church to feel like our soul needs anything my soul got saved like you know five years ago 20 years ago what do I need I don't need help with myself it's saved but I'm telling you the nature needs to change it got started but the nature needs to become like Christ and that's why we're here [Music] find out where we're at yes we're saved but we're not ready yet we're still in the process of manifesting all of his nature amen and if we limit this office to meeting only our natural needs our wants things that we prefer then we're actually limiting God when he's trying to speak to your soul it's why many believers they never get further established in Christ because they're not focusing on what the ministry is for and if you if you don't focus on that you're going to have that tendency not to be held accountable to the word that's why this is where we're going with this now you've got to believe the word is trying to hold us accountable if the if the word says pray without ceasing that our hearts need to be pricked Lord I'm going to put more effort in praying if if if I need to to have a burden one for another if I I need to lay down my life I need to go help someone uh brother Johnson stand up here and saying I I I I I got a burden on my heart I need to do this he's just obeying the Holy Spirit and this is what God wants to operate through our lives and we we get so natural that we're missing God dealing with our souls do you know uh in my position God deals with me with every one of these messages that you hear before you get them he's dealing with me I'm not up here saying you got needs that I do not no I'm up here saying I have these knees this is what God has for us but we don't want to be in a place where we dislike being under Spiritual Authority don't like hearing certain things you like disagree what's being done or who's doing it if we're going to mature and grow our character we're going to have to Humble ourselves and come under subjection to Spiritual Authority now God has put in charge of our souls someone is in charge of our souls to feed our soul to direct her soul into the nature of Christ to correct our souls when it's getting out of order right and I want you to look at your soul as your nature how you act when you get out of when you get wild when you want to do your own thing that's the thing that God is trying to get under subjection and he will use the holy spirit will use the office to bring us to give us the word and bring us back to where we need to be to get us back in order to direct us into all truth habakkuk habakyak two forces behold his soul which is lifted up is not right in him but the just shall live by faith so the soul that gets lifted up and says well I don't need to do that that's just you know brother soul and soul that's just his opinion well right there the soul is not right it it it it gets lifted up our souls come from God they belong to God Ezekiel 18 forces behold All Souls are mine I've read this before as the soul of the father so the soul the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die now our souls have a chance to sin every day in fact brother Brandon says we backslide every day so this is not about your loss and you need to get saved again we're not talking like that what we're talking about is where have we been this last week I'm subjecting myself to the word so the Holy Ghost can speak to me and get me more in order so we need to fine-tune what's happening in our souls Romans 13 1 again let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of God and the powers that be ordained of God whosoever therefore resisteth the power resist the the ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves trouble you don't want to resist the word no matter how much you think everything's okay true according to the scriptures here when you're not being subjects it's not you're not being subject to Brother John you're not being subject to God because the Bible says for there is no power but of God but the powers that be are ordained of God Amen amen so when you're resisting you're really not resisting Brother John you're resisting God I want you to know that I want to sink in because our our our conscience can become so hardened right right if we're struggling with coming under subjection to the higher Powers we just simply need to pray more just just humble yourself pray pray helps bring a balance in your life if we claim to have the Holy Ghost and not lining up with the word that when God gives it then we need to pray more for more holy ghosts we need to fight for the Promised Land not just I don't need it if that spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwells in you it'll Quicken your mortal body in other words it will bring your body into subjection to the word right amen so if you got the Holy Ghost the word should be there the love for the word the love to to to reach out to others to to help the body to grow and if the Holy Ghost is missing well then we're back doing the things that we want to do so let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of God the powers that be are ordained of God who so therefore resisteth that power he's resistant the ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation for rulers verse 3 for rulers are not a terror to Good Works but to evil in other words if you're coming to church you're here in time you're you're preparing you're entering into his gates with Thanksgiving you're you're doing all that you all the good works that you know that you can well there's nothing to be afraid about when you come in and you hear the word of God it's only when you're not following the word will thou then not be afraid of that power do that which is good and thou shalt Praise of the same for he is the Minister of God to thee for good but if thou do that which is your own be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the Minister of God a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doeth evil my I don't think you can preach that verse in a lot of churches right together but God is interested in a bride without spot a wrinkle he's focusing on a bride that's just perfect and he has many things to say unto that bride just like he did his disciples and we have to be able to take that word receive it be accountable to it begin to walk in the light of it and then come to the next service and look for more because like his brother Johnson said there's not much time left and if we're interested in a Rapture I'm telling you don't wait there's not time to wait wherefore ye must needs be subject ye must needs be subject not when you want to not when you agree not when you think not when you feel not when it's convenient not when it lifts you up not when it helps your reputation ye must these be subject not only for Wrath but also for conscience sake you don't want God to be bothered with you but also you want to be walking out of church with a clear conscience I've done your bidding Lord I've done what you've asked me to do I want to I want to leave here and I want to put these things into practice and I want to come back and I want to Rejoice because I followed through with what I said last service now the key is learning to be subject to the word this is it's real simple the key is learning to be subject to the word the Bible says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom Proverbs 15 5 says a food despiseth his father's instructions we don't want to despise our father's instructions and don't let the devil tell you that's just brother John right Proverbs 13 13 whosoever despises the word shall be destroyed but he that feareth the Commandment shall be rewarded amen praise God it's an either or there's no Switzerland here Proverbs 3 11 my son despise not the chasing of the Lord neither be weary of his correction don't despise it let God love you in this very intimate way that most people cannot receive most people can receive Calvary John 3 16 but they can't receive the intimacy remember when Jesus says I have many things to speak unto you but you can't bear it now that was in his most intimate hour in his with his disciples going into the upper room he was there having an intimate communication with him spoke things that just before he left that there were the most important things that had to do with his relationship and he was reminded them to stay in the vine stay connected be one keep it going amen no there's a lot of things are going to be coming right now you can't handle it he says but they're still coming they're still going to come the word is still going to come and if it don't come from me God will send somebody by here to make sure it comes because the the bride has got to receive the word that she needs a five-fold Ministry we'll get this bride ready verse 6 for this cause Peggy tributes also for they are God's ministers attending continually upon this very thing now if you're wondering what I'm doing with my extra time you know we all got extra time just ask my wife what I do with my extra time God's ministers attending continually upon this very what very thing the souls the souls that need shin that need to reflect the character of Christ we can know all the Mysteries we could have all the faith we can give our bodies but what we need is divine love which is the nature of God we're not only supposed to be subject but we're supposed to actually honor and to be thankful for God's ministers can you say Amen render therefore all their dues wow I didn't think I owed anything see that's how people look at Christ I don't owe them anything he did it all it's not by works tribute to whom tribute do is due accustomed to him custom honor to honor I mean just in every possible way oh no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another have fulfilled the law God doesn't want us owing anything I think a lot of people do owe I really do yes I'm thankful for the amens there the thing is I feel a lot of people oh God not a Payback not you can't pay anything back for Calvary but you can give them the only thing you have to give which is your life and he that giveth his life the Jesus said I shall save it and he that keepeth it from South shall lose it Hebrews 13 16. but to do good and to communicate forget not for what such sacrifice is God Is Well pleased I'd rather get in trouble for saying thank you to someone too much than to even come close to the borderline of missing it yeah you know people might think that it's not real if you say it too much but you know your heart and your life will follow what what how real it is it really will all right verse 17 obey them that have the rule over you and what's the word submit yourselves for they watch for your what foreign watch for your souls when you're talking or when I'm talking to you no matter what we're talking about there is a good chance I'm staring at something different I'm peeking at something different I'm interested in something that's different I love Fellowship but I have a responsibility I have a responsibility and it the responsibility was not given by you and God didn't ask you if it's okay for me to be here it's between God and look you you parents your children don't understand all the time while you tell them what they need to do but they need to be subject to you you know that and it's hard because sometimes they don't want to right now when they're young it's okay because you can spank them all the way to to doing it but after they get older you need to win them there's no longer spankings they don't work and it becomes harder but we're adults here the more you love God the more you'll come subject to the word [Music] for they watch for your souls as they that must give an account they have to actually give an account to God for all the dealings that they may do it with joy and not with grief for this is unprofitable for you so you know it's like a love triangle I mean I got a responsibility to God to give you the word you have a responsibility to follow that word because that's your relationship with God you see how that goes God said he'll do nothing except he first revealth his Secrets unto the prophets so God will always use a prophet to bring the word and then that five the rest of that FireFold Ministry who takes that word breaks it down and and gives it to the people do you feel okay don't let the tension be too strong in here there's a number of scriptures that we're going to have to escape because of of time but I want to talk about a couple things if I could and Jude talks about those that despise Dominion and he said well unto them for they have gone the way of Cain now Cain was a man that actually had a meeting with authority Authority came to him and told him what to do if thou do as well won't thou be accepted and if you don't well send lieth at the door right damnation to them that don't follow but Cain rejected accountability this is the danger he was okay he felt okay to sit in church and listen to the preaching he was willing to do that but he wasn't willing to be accountable just like Cain said listen to the preaching of God we don't want to reject Authority part of Cain's way was being a murderer just like his father brother Branham taught us to try to hurt somebody's influence is the Same Spirit it's the way of Cain Romans 2. verse eight look what happens in the spiritual realm here Romans 2 8 but unto them that our contentious Cain was contentious and do not obey the truth but obeying righteousness indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the Jew first and then the Gent and also the Gentile but glory honor and peace to every man that worketh good to the Jew first and also to the Gentiles for there's no respect of persons with God I love brother Johnson said I want to be at peace with all men because this is what the Life of Christ is all about I don't I don't really care about her past I don't care what's transpired what I care about is what's happening from here moving forward because that's what God is interested in the beautiful thing about being under God's Spiritual Authority is that you get the benefits too many people want to use the word for their own benefits man you'll come to me in that day and say Lord Lord did not this they used for their own benefit but they didn't even want to follow the word right now the first benefit I want to mention is the unveiling of gods John 14 21. this is a great benefit for being under subjection to the word John 14 see too much this is what happens I think in the majority of churches the people give out what they want to give out and they're not focusing on helping the people have a relationship with God and this is the most important thing he that have my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me right and he that loveth me shall be loved to my father and I will love him and what will manifest myself to him well I'll tell you this just kicks out the knowledge right out listen all the tapes read all you want it ain't about knowledge friends it's about God said I'll build my church upon the unveiling of himself from the father it's got to be real Judah saith unto him not a scary Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world and Jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode there's too many people are focusing on I got the Holy Ghost I've got the Holy Ghost they should be focusing in I want to obey more of the word I want more of the word I want to live more of the word because automatically Christ will manifest himself in you look at this benefit here in John 15 7. if he abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you when you allow the authority of the word to come inside your life when you come under subjection to the word you are receiving Authority not by just listening to it it's the doers that are Justified not just the hearers when we obey the word we are becoming one with the word we're becoming one with a Spiritual Authority I believe the Bible says let the word of God dwell in you richly dwell there there are benefits for letting Authority for coming under subjection to Authority he's able to make all grace abound to us the Bible says he's able to do exceedingly above all that we would ask or think if we would just seek first the kingdom not our own not our own things for not getting what you want look for ways to obey God's word more because he is able to make the grace that you're looking for abound in your life we don't have time but I want you to read it uh it's Matthew chapter 8 verses 15 through 13. this is the story of the Centurion and he had a revelation of Spiritual Authority he said I am a man under Authority amen and what did he say right after that I go tell a man this and he doeth I tell a man that and he do it I say come and he cometh but his first word was I am a man under Authority now I'm a man that gives that that tells people what to do right he was saying I understand Authority I understand how it works when you're subject to the one above you you do what he says and that if you're over someone you tell them what to do and they do it and now God I know that you're you are in control of all the spirits all the spiritual Realm and if you just speak the word my servant will be healed that's the beauty of being under subjection to Authority you don't have to be afraid of the word though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil that is that is not natural death that's spiritual death right that's why the first verse says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want amen he is leading us to do his will amen we don't want to pick and choose just want to give it all to Jesus God has given us spiritual authority over the devil I think we let him push us around too much tries to put us in a box of of hopelessness flooding our our minds with just negativity tormenting us with doubts and fears but God has given a spiritual authority over the devil to hold him accountable to the same word that we're accountable to yeah yeah think about that don't try to use the word when you're not accountable to it Jesus I know Paula no but who are you right but when you're under subjection to it you are you are a man under Authority you can say to the devil get thee behind me Satan in other words you have the authority to cast down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ see that and look at verse 6 and having a readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled so see how it's connected Authority and accountability this word has given us spiritual authority over the devil Mark 16 verse 17 and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we just need to have faith like that Centurion you've got to believe the word Christ is our example and I'm going to be ending with this okay Christ is our example he took upon him the form of a servant amen the Bible says he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross were for God also highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that the name of Jesus every knee shall bow and every of things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father notice he came under authority of the father he was held accountable and then God lifted him up in due season are you with me now the Bible teaches us to Humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God that he will lift us up in due time that we're told to be subject one to another one to another and let every soul be subject unto the higher Powers let's Stand Together we don't have to be afraid of the word I'm in we have to be afraid of our flesh that doesn't want to die out because that's the only thing that's going to hold us back uh let's sing by his word I'll prevail [Music] amen by his word [Music] foreign by his word I'll never fail by his word I'll overcome by his word of prevail amen let's sing that again by his word amen by his word I prevail by his word I'll never fail by his word how overcome come by his word of prevail I'll overcome by his love he loves us as many as I love I rebuke her

that word you can't be scared of it can't be afraid of it it's what we need to overcome amen let's bow our hearts in a word of prayer and if you're here Desiring to have more courage and and more boldness to take God's correction and his word no matter what he speaks you just desire prayer just lift up your hand I'm going to pray with you amen God bless these hands God sees you our heavenly
