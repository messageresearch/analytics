You know, a lot of times we get sick, you know, and but how many times are are we not sick, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And we we're ignoring that God's protection is on us in the times when we're not sick, right?

Heavenly Father, when we look at ourselves, we see such frailty, such inability, such shortcomings. And Lord, you are our hope and because you are here, all things are possible. Lord, we pray that your Holy Spirit would come and visit our hearts in a special way this morning. Visit each of us, Lord, from the youngest to the oldest. Lord, you know our our longing for you, our desire for you. And we just ask, Lord, that you would help each of us to get out of the way. Forgive us of our unbelief, our sins, our trespasses. Where we've come short, anything that would stand in the way from you, being able to have liberty. For your word says where the where the spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty. We ask Lord that you would have liberty in our hearts to work your will in our lives and to accomplish the very purpose. Uh Lord that this service has been set aside that you could come and minister to us. Draw us closer to you and help us to Lord we just want to be more in your image today. We commit the service into your hand each soul, Lord, young and old. Bless the reading of your word. May it be accompanied with revelation from above, Lord, that we that it would hit home and accomplish the very purpose of it being spoken. Lord, we love you. We thank you for these things. And now we wait further upon thee in Jesus Christ's precious name we ask. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me if you would to St. John chapter 18. Just have one verse here before you're seated and then we're going to have a perhaps quite a bit of reading. Hope that's okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll be reading from the word of God. That's the [snorts] most important. Amen. Amen. St. John chapter 18 and we're going to be reading verse number 37. So this is where um they took uh Jesus and brought him before Pilate. Pilate didn't really know what to do with him. And Pilate therefore said unto him in verse 37, "Art thou a king then?" And Jesus answered, "Thou sayest, I am a king." And he said, "To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth, and everyone that is of truth heareth my voice." Amen. God bless. You may be seated. Well, we we want to entitle this remembering God's gift and for a subject the reason for the season. We've often heard that terminology. Don't forget the real reason of the season. And I feel the reason that Jesus was born was to bring us back to him &gt;&gt; into fellowship into oneness into a personal relationship to birth us and change our selfish nature back into the image of God. It was what God intended for everyone to be born with. When God, if the sin would have never took place in the Garden of Eden, then every one that would have been born would have been born exactly into his image. But God in his great plan did not want that to happen. He wanted um he wanted to see us be born uh through a satanic, evil, selfish nature and for us to turn that down &gt;&gt; to say, "No, I I want to be like Jesus, &gt;&gt; and I'm willing to die out to let the word be born in me." And I believe that was a a showing the bride's love &gt;&gt; to the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Uh and I I in God's province, that's what he allowed. And I believe that if we allow this oneness to take place that it would impact our lives and how we treat one another. Amen. &gt;&gt; And thus it would bring about peace and good will on earth &gt;&gt; and joy unspeakable and and full of glory. And and that is really what Christmas means to me. But I'd like to read some common verses that that are usually read or at least some of them are read. So I'm going to go through them kind of quick. And first is in Isaiah 7 verse4. Basically the prophecy here. Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose to go. Now, notice this that every child that is born, if he's going to come to the new birth, he has to learn how to refuse evil and to choose good. It's an individual free will that a child must learn that. I'll tell you, if you give a child everything he wants, that child learns to be spoiled. &gt;&gt; It never learns to not do the evil and choose the good. For before that child shall know to refuse evil and choose good, the land that thou shalt be forsaken of both her kings. That's a prophecy. It did come to pass. Luke chapter 1 verse 26. And um this is where it all started. Uh here I I believe God spoke to Mary before Joseph. And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into the city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin exposed to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her, and said, "Hail, thou art highly favored. The Lord is with thee, and blessed art thou among women." Now, we want to keep in mind, we're not Mary, but we are a type of Mary. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the bride is highly favored among all the other churches. &gt;&gt; And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner salutation this should be. And the angel said unto her, "Fear not, Mary, for thou has found favor with God. And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name Jesus, and he shall be great, and shall be called the son of the highest. And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David." My, what a type. God is going to come into us, and he's going to take his rightful position on the throne of our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever. and of his kingdom there shall be no end. And then said Mary unto the angel, how shall this be, seeing I know not a man? So how in this how in the world is am I going to become born again? How am I going to have the nature of Christ seeing that uh I was born this way? If I could say it like that. And the angel answered and said unto her, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon you, &gt;&gt; and the power of the highest shall overshadow you." &gt;&gt; Therefore also that holy thing which shall be what? Born of thee shall be called the son of God. &gt;&gt; That's why Paul could could say, "It's no longer I, but it's Christ that liveth in me. And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth shall also conceive a son in her own age, and this is the sixth month with her, who uh was called barren, for with God nothing shall be impossible. And notice the angel of the Lord is trying to give her faith to believe for this supernatural thing in her life. And Mary said, "Behold, the handmade of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word." And the angel departed from her. Now if I could just say it like this. If we in our heart as the word of God is being preached, if we could just say, "Lord, be it unto me even as their word is being preached." &gt;&gt; In other words, the word is not for everybody. It's not. But it is for those who can receive it. &gt;&gt; And you just have to be the one that says, "Amen. I want this for my life, Lord." &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 1 verse 18. So the Lord appears to Mary now is going to come and is going to appear to um Joseph because Joseph didn't didn't get the revelation that Mary got because God, you know, I can't give you a revelation. You can't give me a revelation. &gt;&gt; If we don't hear from God, we're not hearing at all. &gt;&gt; But God is faithful to reveal himself to each of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise in verse number 18. When as his mother Mary was uh when as his mother Mary was exposed to Joseph before they came together, she was found with child. Notice of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost was the father. Then Joseph, her husband, being a just man and not willing to make her a public example, he loved her and was minded to put her away privately. Didn't want to make her a a spectacle of the situation. And while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee, Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her, it's not of another man, it's of the Holy Ghost. That's why we when we we are not just Methodist, Lutheran, Pentecostal assemblies. We're we're not just born of a church. &gt;&gt; We're that which is conceived of us is is of the Holy Ghost. We we've received the word of God. and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emanuel, which being interpreted is God with us. And Joseph being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bid him, and took unto him his wife, and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son, and he called his name Jesus. &gt;&gt; That beautiful. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, let's go where Mary and Joseph go to Bethlehem in Luke chapter 2. And we can't have a Christmas uh service without some of these scriptures, these Luke chapter 2:6. And so it was that that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end. If they really would have known, I think everybody would have just made room, &gt;&gt; but they didn't recognize. &gt;&gt; And there in that same country, shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over the flock by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be noticed to all people." And the angel said unto them, uh I'm sorry uh uh I'll just finish reading it. Fear not, for for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you. You shall find the babe wrapped in swallowing clothes, laying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts, and they were praising God, saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." And it came to pass that the angels were gone away from them into heaven. The shepherds said one to another, "Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord had made known unto us." and and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in a manger. What uh what a marvelous thing. Some humble shepherds &gt;&gt; that God appeared to. But notice the angel said it's going to bring uh this good tidings and great joy shall be to all people, not just to some, to all people. So we want to try to bring this this verse in that we we read in St. John chapter 18 verse number 37 and try to bring it into these scriptures. Pilate therefore said unto him, art thou a king then? That was his question because remember at his birth he was called a king. The wise men said where is is born king of the Jews? Where is he that's born king of the Jews? So even at the very beginning of his birth he was called a king and now Pilate is asking the question art thou a king then and Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king and he says to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth and everyone that is of truth heareth my voice. Jesus is sharing his own purpose of Christmas, &gt;&gt; his own purpose of what he was born for. It was to bear witness of the truth. &gt;&gt; So we just want to try to break this down. To this end was I born and this cause came I into the world. Jesus was born by the will of God, by the will of the father to do the will of the father. And that will was to bear witness of the truth. So this is this is a this means a whole lot here to bear witness of the truth. That was his purpose of uh being born. I it it so it it's more than just you know you know how it is. The whole church world don't even really know what Christmas is all about. &gt;&gt; It it's just you know Jesus in the manger. They lay it out the nativity saying and they give gifts and I'm not trying to to to be little any of that, but it it is so much deeper than Jesus being born as a baby and with the mentality that he came he he he he he came and he's our savior. And &gt;&gt; um there's it's much greater than that. And we're going to see as we go through here, John 3:16, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. Whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. God sent for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already because he believeth not in the name of the only begotten son of God. John 3:16 is probably the most quoted scripture in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Uh with my research, it had over two million searches in 2025. that once that one verse yet it's probably the most misunderstood misinterpreted and misused verse as well. &gt;&gt; First of all, the gift was not eternal life. And what I mean by that, God did not go out and hand out gifts of eternal life to individuals that said, "I believe." &gt;&gt; Amen. I wish it was that easy. &gt;&gt; I wish everybody that just said, "I believe had eternal life." &gt;&gt; But that is the way it's presented. &gt;&gt; That's the way the spirit of this world presents Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But that is not bearing witness of the truth. &gt;&gt; It's not like some Christmas present on the tree that says, "I believe that's for me." It wasn't God's so loving us that he gave us eternal life unconditionally. I'm sorry. God just did not hand out eternal life unconditionally to people. Eternal life is not just being able to live eternally when we die. But this is how the world views salvation. Jesus said, "All that ever came before me were thiefs and robbers." In other words, who wouldn't want eternal life? &gt;&gt; There's no question with that. Everybody wants eternal life. The question is, do I really want to live for God down here? &gt;&gt; That's the question. That's the problem. &gt;&gt; That's the hiccup. So if I can present the gospel in such a way that you enjoy the preaching that you have eternal life &gt;&gt; without doing anything without giving anything &gt;&gt; but he came to bear witness of the truth. Eternal life is a nature change. Let me just make this real clear. Eternal life is a nature change. Jesus didn't come to give us eternal life after we die. Jesus came to give us eternal life today. &gt;&gt; And it affects our nature today. &gt;&gt; In fact, if our nature doesn't change today, then we can't make it to the other side. That's what Jesus meant when he said you must be born again. &gt;&gt; Not I'm going to hand you eternal life here when you die &gt;&gt; and then we have this comfort somehow we belong to this church or that church or whatever church and we have eternal life. When eternal life comes into a man's heart, it will change his very nature and they will begin to have a personal relationship with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's much different than, well, I believe Jesus died for me and this I'm I'm I'm a Luther. I'm a Methodist. I I'm Presbyterian. I'm in the message or whatever it might be. And because I have that personal belief, I got eternal life. And that's all that matters. In other words, don't challenge me about any way I live or anything I do. Don't challenge me about anything. Brother Brandham said in the message that day in Calvary, he said, "Now the first thing I want to say is that Jesus never lived for himself. His life was spent for others. He said, "That's perfectly eternal life." &gt;&gt; When you say you go to church and you do good things, that's fine. But when you live your life to yourself, you haven't eternal life. &gt;&gt; Wow. I'm so glad God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; And I I'll say it like this. I feel like I'm more glad. just could be selfishly. I'm more glad that he showed me who he was &gt;&gt; because without that I would be lost &gt;&gt; personally. Eternal life is living for others. Brother Ram said it proved it when it come to the lamb of God. He lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself. That's why people say, "Well, I I believe Jesus died for me and I accept him, you know, Christmas and and and he he he went to Calvary for me." And that's the end of it for them. &gt;&gt; And they live for themselves. They just hoard their life and do what they want to do. &gt;&gt; And and and and they're and they're but they still think they have eternal life because that's exactly what the devil wants them to think. &gt;&gt; But Jesus came to bear witness of the truth. He lived for others. He did not live for himself. He lived for others. And you receive eternal life by receiving that day, which was that day in Calvary. And you don't live for yourselves no more. You live for others. So what Calvary did is it opened the door so you could get the Holy Ghost. That's what Calvary did. &gt;&gt; Because unless that price would have been paid, there'd be no chance for the Holy Ghost to come back on you. Calvary paid the price of your sin, of that of your past sin, of your nature, so God would be allowed to come back on you. &gt;&gt; God went to Calvary and gave his life unconditionally. &gt;&gt; But no man can benefit from that gift unconditionally. Just trying to rightly divide the word here like they would a Christmas present given to them unconditionally under the tree. Hey, this looks like this is for Joe and this is for Tom and this is for Sally here. And you pass out the gifts unconditionally. You don't say, "Hey, sign for this." Right? You ever get things that come to into your door that we'd like you to sign for this? You have to sign for it. All the stuff that we send to the government, all the checks and everything, I send it certified. I make them sign it and they get a report back because it only takes one time for them to say, "We didn't get it." &gt;&gt; You still have to pay the interest. [laughter] But not Christmas, you just give them. You don't even have to sign it. It's just yours unconditionally. &gt;&gt; So God went to Calvary unconditionally. &gt;&gt; Amen. As for God so loved the world that he gave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean you unconditionally receive him. &gt;&gt; Brother would go on to say that a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received as a pardon. &gt;&gt; So there is a condition to receiving the new birth. Amen. There's a condition to receive eternal life. Remember when the angels appeared to the shepherds and the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people." In other words, Calvary was to the whole world. It was to whosoever will. And that's what it says in the book of Revelation. Whosoever will, let him come and drink of the waters of life freely. Ju just if if that's in your heart, if you're of the truth, come. The giving of God's gift was unconditional, but the receiving of God's gifts is conditional. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that we got to earn it. &gt;&gt; Scripture for that is Ephesians 2:8. For by grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourself. It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. Look what I've done. So, it's nothing we can do. Nothing that we could do to to ever make Jesus go to Calvary. Nothing. There was nothing that we could do that would say, "Okay, because John Martin did this, I'm going to go die for him. nothing. He did that out of the love of his heart. &gt;&gt; For God so loved THE WORLD THAT HE gave &gt;&gt; his only begotten son. But when we receive salvation, look at verse 10 now. For we are his workmanship. I don't know if anybody ever worked on something, but you know when you start to do something, you have an end you have an end result. &gt;&gt; Those of you that uh clean, your end result is I want to see this place cleaned. &gt;&gt; You're doing a Sunday school project or a home project for the kids. You start with this, you want to end with this. &gt;&gt; Well, well, God don't just save you to live what every kind of life you want to live. He said you are the workmanship of his hands. You He has an end result for you. And what is that? For we are the workmanship. We are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which is his works. That's the only good work there is is his works which God have before ordained that we should walk in them. No longer walking into ourselves. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; So we have the unconditional gift of God coming into the world to bear witness of the truth and providing us an opportunity to be saved through Calvary. &gt;&gt; Because how many people are going to perish because they didn't take advantage of the gift that God gave at Calvary? That was the gift. The gift wasn't eternal life to everybody. I'm just trying to rightly divide because if Calvary saved every if Calvary just gave eternal life to everybody, then everybody would be saved. &gt;&gt; Calvary was unconditional. What's conditional is you believe in believing the report. Not all believe the report. And the report is that God Jesus came to bear witness of the truth. And this is the truth. It's the whole thing. It's rich to me. John 3:16, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son unconditional that whosoever believeth. Conditional in him should not perish but have everlasting life. See the see the the dividing line. For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but the but that the world notice through him through him might be saved. Not here's a Christmas present. God provided an unconditional opportunity to be saved. But we have to go through him, right? He's the way, the truth, and the life. He that believeth on him is not condemned. But he that believeth not because he remember he came to to bear witness of the of of of truth. He came to show us the truth to bear witness of the truth. And all they that are of truth will hear his voice. But he that believeth not is condemned already because he believed not in the name of the only begotten son. In other words, Jesus, he is the only way, the only truth, the only life. He was born to bear witness of the truth to show us the way to eternal life. The birth of Christ did not give us eternal life. It all starts with faith. The foundation of our walk is faith. The Bible says you're saved by faith and we walk by faith. We live by faith. And that we have to fight the good fight of faith. And the end of our journey is by faith. It's all by faith. We finish the course by faith. We must believe in order to receive. But our belief isn't like an unconditional Christmas present of eternal life. In other words, it's of no private interpretation how we believe. Like it doesn't matter how we believe. As long as we believe that, you know, Jesus died for us, then what else matters? Like it's kind of personal between me and you. It is not personal between you and it doesn't matter what you believe. You have to believe according to the scriptures. &gt;&gt; There's only one way to believe. We must believe his way which is the word according to the scriptures. The contingency or the condition is we must believe. And we can't just believe any way we want to, any way that we think. Not all that say Lord, Lord shall enter in, right? But he that doeth the will of the father, then you shall say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, didn't we do this, this, and this? So, it isn't just saying, well, I this is what I believe, and because I believe this, I got eternal life. &gt;&gt; No, we have to believe according to the scriptures to make it, we have to believe one way, and it's the only way, and that's God's way. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not what brother John says. It's what the word of God says. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John 5:39, I think we read this maybe last service or two, search the scriptures. For in them you think you have eternal life, but they are they whichify me. So Jesus knowing ahead of time that the devil was going to try to throw out there to as many people as he could that they have eternal life. I mean, look at the Pharisees and the Sadducees. But he's telling us this is how we know. This is how we know whether we got eternal life or not. Search them. Search these scriptures. Forget about what you feel, what you think, what your mom said, what your dad said, what your pastor said. Look, the scriptures declare the only acceptable way how to even believe. For if you believe not that I am he, Jesus said, you'll die in your sins. Jesus said in John 12:48, "He that rejectth me and receiveth not my words, have one that judgeth him. The word that I've spoken, the same shall judge him in the last days." You see, so right there, it just doesn't matter what we believe personally. It matters that we believe the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's all that matters. &gt;&gt; That that that's our common denominator when we come to church here. What we all have in common is we don't care about what we believe. We only care about what the word of God says. &gt;&gt; That we are his bride by his word, birthed by his word, coming into his image. Everyone testifies that they're a believer thinking that because they say that they have eternal life. But Jesus says, "No, sir. The scriptures declare whether you got eternal life or not. We have to believe, but we can't believe our personal way." So there's like that contingency and that there's not a lot of scriptures that talk about this. And I think the reason is is because he hid it from the wise and prudent it and he it because he made it real clear. All they that are of truth will hear his voice. If you got a seed in you, you will recognize you're married to the word. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away. It's just like the scriptures proof who's the real believer and who's the makeel believer. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John 7:38, "He that believeth on me, as the scripture have said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water." Not as the denominations have said, but as the scriptures have said. If we believe according to the scriptures, the Holy Ghost or the living water is going to flow out of us. I I'm going to be honest with you. I We can be a Christian. We can have the Holy Ghost, but we can be out of the spirit. And the the the promise is that if we believe according to the scriptures, then we're going to have the fruit of the Holy Ghost in our life. And and and Galatians 5 tells us what that is. 5:22, but the fruit of the spirit is love. Think about this. Look at your life. Tell me if this flows out of your belly. love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, because against such there's no law. Th this should be flowing from the person who receives Christmas. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Jesus came to bear witness really what eternal life is. Against such there is no law. And they that are Christ, they that have received Christmas have crucified the flesh with the affections and the lust. If we live in the spirit, let us walk in the spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain glory or provoking one another or envying one another. So we see here that these scriptures tell us if we truly believe or not. How many people do we know? They say they're a believer and they're just outright sinners. Like there's no doubt even a child could say, "Yeah, they're not living the life." You understand what I'm saying? And so Jesus came to bear witness of the truth. That's what Christmas was about. and his whole life is showing us the Christmas gift. And he's to help whoever wants this in them. All you have to do now is receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost will bring about the nature change, coming into his image. And really what eternal life is all about. It's eternal. You don't wait to the other side to experience eternal life. Eternal life is lived here. &gt;&gt; It's not even experienced as an anointing that comes down and shakes you up or you speak in tongues or dance in the spirit. That isn't it. I mean, yeah, you're you're being visited by uh uh a heavenly places. You're being visited when that happens. But we're talking about receiving it IN YOUR HEART TO WHERE YOU NO LONGER are thinking about living for yourself anymore. You're living for others. YOUR YOUR MIND IS is the SAME MIND THAT CHRIST WAS. [snorts] And I think we've we begin to make eternal life what we uh want it to be. And we ought to be looking to the word of God, looking to the message to find out what eternal life really is. And are we really fulfilling the fullness of eternal life? I'm not trying to take eternal life away from anybody here. What I am trying to do is the way that I understand this message. Brother Brandon was always trying to make sure make sure you got it. &gt;&gt; Even after you think you got it, he was still saying stay there and make sure you got it. &gt;&gt; And let's just say it like let's say all of us h have eternal life and everybody we know have eternal life. Wouldn't it be wonderful just to make sure that you're living more for others? [laughter] This is not this is not meant to be in any way a a negative thing but just to rightly divide what Christmas is all about. Jesus said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me again, believing, the works I do, shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go to my father." And and what did Jesus say the works were? The works of God is to believe on him that who God who the father have sent. And if the works of the Holy Ghost is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, shouldn't this be a wonderful opportunity for us to express those things to one another? &gt;&gt; Isn't that the true gift? I mean, imagine for a moment if we could take all the gifts away from under the tree and we could just sit there together as a family and express love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness. If we could be that to one another, &gt;&gt; wouldn't that be what really Christmas was all about? Not the commercial part. I mean, it's so easy to give a gift without thinking about Christ. &gt;&gt; It is. And then you're under pressure. How many's ever been under pressure? Oh, I didn't get so and so a gift yet this year. Within two days, my hand's still up. I mean, it's the reality, right? &gt;&gt; But how much pressure we've been under? Oh, I got to make sure I show so and so the love of God. &gt;&gt; I got to make sure I'm more patient, more long-suffering. What What about that? Where's that pressure for that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Second Peter 1:8 says, "For if these things be for if these things be in you, what things? Faith, love, temperance, longsuffering, if they be in you and abound and make they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ." In other words, there'll be rivers of living water flowing &gt;&gt; from your vessel. But he that lackth these things, number one, is blind. He cannot see a far off. And he's even forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. Notice he forgot Calvary. He forgot what Calvary meant to him. Wherefore it would be better, brethren, if you give some diligence to make your calling and your election sure. For if you do these things, you shall never fall. Jesus said, "To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, not to bring the Christmas present of eternal life to the masses, but to bear witness unto the truth on how to receive eternal life." How to receive eternal life. And everyone that is of truth will hear my voice. This is to me the supernatural the supernatural thing that brother Brand tried explaining to all of us about having that seed that germ seed inside that we were born with that if we were ever a child if we're if we uh if we are a child we always were a child if we have eternal life we always had eternal life there's only one source of eternal life he began to describe those things Jesus said in John chapter 10 27 My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me. So everyone that's of truth hear my voice. And Jesus said my sheep are the ones that hear my voice. I know them. Right? The foundation of God says sure God knoweth them that are his and everyone that nameeth the name of Christ let him depart from iniquity. So he knows who's belongs to him. And you know what happens to those that belong to him? They follow him. They do not say I belong to God and go do their own thing. &gt;&gt; That is not what Jesus said. They literally follow the word. And he says, "I give unto them eternal life." How is he going to give eternal life to somebody that don't follow him? Brother Brandham said that is satanic. Power without character is satanic. And to me, eternal life is power, right? It's power. Jesus said, "I have power to lay down my life. I have power to take it again." To me, if we have power to die out and live for others, that is not that's not you. That's God in you. &gt;&gt; That's power. I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My father which gave them me is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand. I and my father are one. It amazes me how many believers don't follow the word, but they still think they're following Christ. You talk about how powerful the deception of the devil is. &gt;&gt; I mean, you no wonder brother Rand said the devil's religious. &gt;&gt; Getting people to think they're following Christ without lining up with the word. No. I'm so glad that Jesus came to bear witness of the truth. &gt;&gt; And he said, "If you love me, keep my commandments." &gt;&gt; This this is this is the truth. My sheep hear my voice and they follow me. The voice of God is what? The word. I That should have been anonymous. The voice of God is the word. &gt;&gt; You know what? Most religious people say the voice of God is, "Oh, God spoke to me. God spoke to me." It was this thing that just came to me and he spoke to me. And they emphasized that. And it then they kind of diminish coming into church and hearing the word of God. It's like they have a their relationship isn't with the word. Their rel their relationship is with their their own personal belief. &gt;&gt; And I'm just going to say it like this. A man can never be changed by his personal belief. &gt;&gt; If the word doesn't birth you, you're not being birthed. Every man brings forth of his own kind. &gt;&gt; And if we belong to God, we're going to be God &gt;&gt; in flesh. To this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth and I should show the way, point them the way, and that every man is of the truth will hear my voice. Only the predestinated will catch it. Romans 8:29. For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate. Who are them? That's everyone that's of the truth. He came to bear witness of the truth. And everyone that's of the truth is going to catch it. Whom he did for know he did predestinate to be what? conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. In other words, the whole point of Christmas was to bring about the new birth. &gt;&gt; It It wasn't some here's the gift, you got eternal life. Yeah, you're going to heaven. I hate that spirit because what is it doing? It's deceiving. &gt;&gt; It's deceiving. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son unconditional that whosoever believeth conditional in him [clears throat] should not perish but have eternal life. This is the gift that God gave us. He gave us an opportunity to become born again. &gt;&gt; And it's us it's up to us to seize it. It's up to us to make a difference. It's up to us to make changes in our life. It's up to us to to to you cast away our personal belief and start looking to the scriptures. Start searching the scriptures. What am I supposed to become Lord? &gt;&gt; What do you expect out of me? Because see everybody, this is the truth. I just just face it. This is human nature. Everybody wants to go to heaven without changing. &gt;&gt; That is our first nature. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you know people if if if they were never challenged never challenged I think this church would be overflowing with people but it wouldn't make them any more a believer. [laughter] It wouldn't make this church anymore spiritual. Probably be less spiritual to be honest with you. &gt;&gt; Look at John 1. He came unto his own. Jesus came unto his own and his own received him not. But as many as received him, praise God. &gt;&gt; To them gave he power to become the sons of God. And to them that believe on his name. You notice it wasn't a Christmas gift. It wasn't an unconditional Christmas gift. You literally have to receive the word of God. &gt;&gt; You have to receive THE WORD IN YOUR HEART. Not believe it in history what happened in history but that word is has to become real to us. Now this is what it means to believe on his name. Verse 13. what it really means to believe on his name. Which were born not of blood, not of the will of flesh, not of the will of the man, but of God. We have to be born again. And verse 14, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld the glory, the glory as the only begotten of the father, full of grace and full of truth. And when we're born again, the word becomes flesh in us. That's when people start saying, "I, Brother Ron, last time I knew about you, uh, 20 years ago, you were you were smoking cigars. Brother John, I remember I I used to smoke with you and and drink with you and party with you." Yeah. But the words become flesh. &gt;&gt; Brother Brother M, I remember, you know, you used to swear all the time. What happened? The word became flesh. &gt;&gt; The word is becoming flesh. And the more you yield to God, more you yield to the word, the more it'll become flesh. See, it's not us waiting on God. God is waiting on us. &gt;&gt; He's here. He's just waiting for you to give more of yourself, give him more liberty, &gt;&gt; to become manifested in the flesh. The real gift is to receive the Holy Ghost into our bodies and to become born again, &gt;&gt; the correct way, his way, the only way. And the Holy Ghost leads us back to the word which births us into his character. Straight as the gate, narrow is the way, Jesus said, which leadth unto life, and few people and few there be that find it. If you were trying to get somewhere, let me just say if the whole world, if everybody in Livingston County here was trying to get to a place in Jese County and only a few of them made it. That would be pretty special, don't you think? But they were all trying to make it. Wouldn't you think if they were all trying to get there, that'd be for a good reason. Maybe you might receive a free house. I don't know. You're trying to get there, but only a few make it. Wouldn't you want to be striving to get there? Why is it that people come to church and they don't have this spirit of striving &gt;&gt; to become in his image? &gt;&gt; Because they stare at eternal life as here's the present. I gave you eternal life. You don't even need to change. There's no longing to be in the image of Christ. No longing to manifest love, joy, peace, longsuffering. There's just wrong understanding about what Christmas is about. The word is what conforms us into his image. And it happens as we give God liberty. As I said, as we as we worship God in spirit and truth, as we're planted together in his likeness, as we crucify our carnal flesh, as we pick up our cross and follow him, as we yield ourselves members unto his righteousness, as we let the mind of Christ become in us. This is how we become into his image. And this is truly what Christmas is. I tell you, every time we come to church, we should be experiencing Christmas. The fact that you've heard the voice of the Lord is a blessing. It's an opportunity to believe. Jesus said, "In every church age, he that have an ear to hear, let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church." In other words, everyone can't hear in every age. How many people have heard about this message and just walked in and walked out? There are many, many, many people who hear the truth. They're blessed, but they do not follow it. Therefore, they do not believe regardless even if they say they believe. You know, to me, the scariest thing is, and I've heard this a number of times when people have come to church, they've heard the truth, and they just said, uh, uh, you know, in in short, I believe in God, but I don't believe what I don't believe in what you believe. That is the scariest thing because they have been programmed that what they believe is really above the word of God. &gt;&gt; Somewhere down the line, they were never taught the importance in their home of the word of God. &gt;&gt; They were taught the importance of mom, of dad, what they say goes. But they were never taught that the word is is priority. It's preeminence. &gt;&gt; It is what's going to judge you and I when we go to heaven on judgment day. Matthew chapter 13 verse 14. We're closing up here. Jesus speaking. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand. In seeing you shall see and not perceive. You know, people can sit in church and hear the word of God and have no idea what's going on. For this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed less than any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and what? And understand with their hearts and should be converted &gt;&gt; and I should heal them. In other words, it's not a Christmas gift. You you've got to hear the word, apply it to your life, and become the word. &gt;&gt; It's the only way that we're going to be healed. It's the only way we're going to be converted. But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. We ought to be the most happiest people in the whole world. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's praise God. HE PUT SOMETHING INSIDE OF US. THAT WASN'T US. THAT'S ALL HIM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S all him. If you hear the voice of God, which is the word, follow it. And then you will become highly favored of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You're blessed if you hear, but you follow the word. Now you're highly favored. You stick out amongst other people in the sight of God. To this end was I born. And for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth. And everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice. I want to close with Ephesians chapter 5. To this end or cause or the reason for the season. God is going to have an eternal bride. Think about that. God is going to have an eternal bride and Christmas was needed to bring about perfection. &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 5 22. Wives submit yourselves to your own husband as unto the Lord. For a husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and is the savior of the body. Christ is the head of us church. The word is your head and he is the savior of you. Therefore, as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. Husbands, now notice he's talking here, husbands, love your wives exactly, even as Christ also loved the church. And what did he do? He gave himself for the church. He literally died for the church. Now we know that the spirit of this world husbands don't love their wives rather they use their wives. So he's speaking here to uh he he's speaking in in reference of our relationship with with Christ, but he's given us instructions as believers. Husbands, love your wife even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify it. Here's the purpose. and cleanse it and with the washing of the water by the word. Now, this is kind of strange because we really feel that somebody loves us when they give us what we want, right? when God just blesses us, fills us with joy, heals our body, supplies all of our needs, answers all of our requests, and this is what we consider a good God. But Jesus goes beyond that. That's why we got to search the scriptures. He says, "Many as I love, rebuke, chasen." &gt;&gt; He wants to get us perfected. He doesn't want to hurt us. Want us to feel bad. Look at verse 27. So he uses the word to present him uh to present him to himself a glorious church having not having a spot or a wrinkle or any such thing, but it should be holy without blemish. Think about this. This without the birth of Christ, this would never happen. To this end, to this end was I born. &gt;&gt; That I might bear witness of the truth. And all they that are of truth will hear this right here. I am his bride. I'm going to let the word wash me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to become more in his image. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourish it and cherth it, even as the Lord the church. For we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and they too shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery. But I speak concerning Christ and the church. Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband. Amen. Let's stand together. Let's remember God's gift this season. What it really is. Cherish it every day. Bear witness in every way of of what Christmas is. You bear witness of the reason for this season. And you know what's going to happen? Everybody that's of the truth is going to hear your voice that you're speaking because your life is speaking what's really important in your life. Your life is speaking what's really important. and and let them see that you just want to see them come to Christ, that Christ died for them and Christ sent the Holy Spirit to change their life. Amen. Let's sing that that song. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. What are you smiling for? I know you're [music] smiling. It was a tiny simple stable, all beaten and torn. Hardly a place [singing] for a king to be born. He didn't choose some place special to reveal his majesty. So I know I'll give him control. He'll be born in me. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. Let it start. Live inside this house of clay and mold it every [singing] day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Well, outwardly I'm nothing. Not much to behold. Unlikely the place for his word to unfold. But if I'll just yield this vessel and let him have his way from glory unto glory. He'll change me [singing] day by day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. Let it start. Live inside this house of clay and mold it every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Oh, let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. Let it start. Live inside this house of clay and mold it every day. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Let your word be born in the manger of my Let's sing it one more time. Oh, let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. Let it start. live inside this house of clay and mold it every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Amen. [clears throat] That's such a desire that I have. It's if I could say it like this, it's just as important to me today as it was the first day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our hearts. If we could close our eyes for a moment, maybe there'd be someone here today says, "John, Brother John, I pray that you would lift me up in prayer because I want to get more serious about the word being born inside of me. I just want to pray with you, man. It's my desire to pray with you. God bless these hands. Almost all the hands. Praise God. Praise the Lord. Father, we come to you with thanksgiving in our heart.
