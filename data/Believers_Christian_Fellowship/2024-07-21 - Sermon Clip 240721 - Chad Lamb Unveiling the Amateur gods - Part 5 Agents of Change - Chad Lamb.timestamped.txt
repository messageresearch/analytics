[0:00] it says now verse 21 but after a long
[0:03] abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst
[0:06] of them and said s you should have
[0:09] hearkened unto me and not have loosed
[0:11] from CRE and to have gained this harm
[0:12] and loss and now I exhort you to be of
[0:15] good cheer for there shall be no loss of
[0:18] any man's life among you but of the ship
[0:21] for there stood by me this night the
[0:23] angel of God whose I am and whom I serve
[0:26] saying fear not Paul thou must be
[0:28] brought before Caesar and lo God hath
[0:31] given thee all them that sail with
[0:34] thee wherefore sir be of good cheer for
[0:38] I believe God that it shall be even as
[0:41] it was told me Hallelujah he never
[0:44] required they believe God but he said
[0:46] you be of good cheer because I believe
[0:48] God and I believe because of faith faith
[0:51] will bring this to pass and because I
[0:53] believe God they'll be no loss of life
[0:55] only of the ship don't worry I believe
[0:58] amen
[1:00] praise God it says now listen that the
[1:03] angel of the Lord said Don't Fear
[1:05] because they have to go to Caesar the
[1:07] Apostle Paul already knew he was going
[1:09] to stand before Caesar God had already
[1:11] told him when he was arrested early on
[1:12] in his arrest that he had to go to
[1:14] appear before Caesar so he was on this
[1:16] journey to go to Pier before Caesar the
[1:19] Apostle Paul believed the word of God he
[1:21] knew the prophecy was true if he was
[1:23] going to go see Caesar he was going to
[1:25] go see Caesar regardless of what
[1:27] happened to the ship but he was away in
[1:29] a long abstinence the Bible says he was
[1:32] hidden away where was he I'll tell you
[1:34] what I believe amen this is me I believe
[1:36] he was praying a prayer of intercession
[1:38] for everybody else on that boat because
[1:40] look at the answer he got don't be of
[1:43] any fear for surely you're going to go
[1:45] to see Caesar but I have given you all
[1:48] the souls that are on this ship who did
[1:50] he give them to he gave them to an agent
[1:52] that was on the earth standing in the
[1:54] Gap a Son of God that was going to go to
[1:56] Caesar anyways he had no doubt he was
[1:59] going to go to Caesar so what's he need
[2:01] he he's saying God what about all these
[2:03] Souls on this boat what about all of
[2:05] these lives and he says I've given them
[2:08] to
[2:08] [Music]
[2:09] [Applause]
[2:12] youall Lord what would have happened to
[2:14] that ship if Paul wasn't on that
[2:18] ship what would happened to those lives
[2:20] if Paul hadn't interceded for those
[2:23] lives and what would happen to all the
[2:25] people around us if there's not an agent
[2:27] on earth right in their midst and you're
[2:29] workplace and in your family amen they
[2:31] may not be seen they may never be able
[2:34] to receive the message but my can you
[2:36] bring healing to their life amen can you
[2:38] bring comfort and peace to them can they
[2:40] be preserved in time of sickness all of
[2:43] these people on this boat most of them
[2:44] were prisoners I doubt all of them were
[2:46] SE Gene of God Amen but their life was
[2:48] saved from that shipwreck because there
[2:50] was somebody standing in the gap for
[2:53] them 200 and something
[2:55] Souls amen
