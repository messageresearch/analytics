[6:24] we've appreciated him

[6:27] sad but we want to
[6:29] give him a proper send-off amen
[6:33] is that luke and ariel hatfield
[6:36] god bless you it's good to have you back
[6:39] amen
[6:41] praise the lord
[6:44] i like saying that luke and ariel
[6:46] hatfield amen
[6:48] praise the lord let's read this
[6:49] revelation chapter 5.
[6:52] start at verse 5 and we'll let you have
[6:54] your seats
[6:55] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[6:57] not behold the lion
[6:59] of the tribe of judah the root of david
[7:01] hath prevailed to open the book
[7:03] and to loose the seven seals thereof and
[7:05] i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[7:07] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[7:09] midst of the elders stood a lamb
[7:11] as it had been slain having seven horns
[7:13] and seven eyes
[7:14] which are the seven spirits of god sent
[7:16] forth into all the earth
[7:18] and he came and took the book out of the
[7:20] right hand of him that sat upon the
[7:22] throne
[7:23] and when he had taken the book and the
[7:25] four beasts and the four and twenty
[7:26] elders fell down before the lamb
[7:28] having every one of them harps and
[7:30] golden vials full of the odors which are
[7:31] the prayers of the saints
[7:33] and they sung a new song sayeth thou art
[7:35] worthy to take the book
[7:37] to open the seals thereof for thou was
[7:39] slain and has redeemed us to god by thy
[7:42] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[7:44] and people and nation and has made us
[7:47] unto our god
[7:48] kings and priests and we shall reign
[7:51] on the earth god bless you as you're
[7:54] seated
[7:55] praise the lord if we can bring up the
[7:57] powerpoint
[7:59] we're going to continue on in the fourth
[8:00] seal
[8:02] and i want to talk about kings and
[8:03] priests amen
[8:05] so we see here at the opening of the
[8:07] seals when they begin to worship and
[8:09] pour out the vials of the prayers of the
[8:11] saints
[8:12] amen they begin to acknowledge that this
[8:14] is redemption amen and
[8:16] when they acknowledge that this is
[8:17] redemption then then they
[8:19] acknowledge also that we have been made
[8:22] kings and priests because that's what
[8:24] we're redeemed back to friends we're
[8:26] redeemed back to a position
[8:28] amen that that we fell from and we're
[8:30] redeemed back
[8:32] to that place of kings and priests unto
[8:35] our god
[8:36] hallelujah see redemption is tied to
[8:39] reconciliation
[8:41] because when you pay the price of
[8:42] redemption to buy back you buy back and
[8:44] reconcile
[8:45] back to its former place where it had
[8:48] fallen from
[8:49] and if we have been redeemed and made
[8:50] kings and priests and that was our
[8:52] original intended purpose
[8:54] amen but something happened something
[8:56] fell
[8:58] i'm gonna i'm gonna divert for a little
[9:00] bit and come back to kings and priests
[9:02] so don't don't get lost praise the lord
[9:06] we do a little bit of overlap
[9:08] these things build as we go but we know
[9:10] that he said when this
[9:12] the mystery was in the seven seals when
[9:13] the seven seals was open that opened up
[9:15] the entire bible
[9:17] the seven seals it was sealed with seven
[9:19] mysteries and then these seven seals
[9:20] held the entire
[9:22] mystery of that we keep going over this
[9:24] every time because we don't ever want to
[9:25] lose this
[9:26] this sealed up the entire book of
[9:29] redemption and all the mysteries that
[9:30] are in the bible
[9:31] are wound up in these seven seals
[9:35] amen in the fourth seal this is when
[9:38] brother ben was just opening his
[9:39] comments
[9:40] and he said i'm so glad we finally got
[9:43] to this one and i'm so thankful that
[9:45] being the last of those four horse
[9:46] riders
[9:47] which i think is one of the main
[9:48] messages to the church at this time
[9:51] and i want to break that down the reason
[9:53] this is one of the main messages to the
[9:55] church at this time
[9:56] is because redemption for the gentiles
[9:59] and the gentile church dispensation
[10:01] wraps up in the fourth seal
[10:02] it finishes in the fourth seal and under
[10:05] the fourth seal the church is raptured
[10:07] amen
[10:08] and when the church goes up in the
[10:09] physical rapture of the church
[10:11] satan is cast out and he physically
[10:14] incarnates the pope
[10:15] becoming the beast under the fourth seal
[10:18] and so that's the wrap up amen of the
[10:20] church ages that's the finishing of
[10:22] of the redemption of the gentiles it all
[10:24] finishes under the fourth seal
[10:26] and and we know the four seals also tied
[10:29] to prophetic ministry
[10:30] because it's it's the the it's the eagle
[10:33] anointing that comes down
[10:34] and the eagle is the prophets amen and
[10:37] so we see brother branham's
[10:39] ministry coming on the scene amen and
[10:41] and the lap over period between
[10:43] the third seal and the fourth seal
[10:45] because brother branham taught us it's
[10:46] like climbing a ladder like going up
[10:48] steps you don't just
[10:49] hop from one to the other just like the
[10:51] church ages there's a transition as you
[10:53] move from one to the other
[10:55] then you transition from one to the
[10:56] other and he explains it to us as going
[10:59] up steps or climbing a ladder
[11:01] so we see in brother branham's day he
[11:03] was making that transition and the
[11:04] transition will go
[11:05] all the way to the rapture in the fully
[11:07] incarnate devil
[11:09] but there's some things that are
[11:10] happening in our time and that's why
[11:12] this is one of the main messages to the
[11:14] church
[11:14] at this time so much happens under the
[11:17] fourth seal friends
[11:18] under the fourth seal we we see the
[11:21] finishing of redemption to the gentiles
[11:23] we see malachi 4 come on the scene we
[11:26] see
[11:26] the opening of the seven seals because
[11:28] it all takes place under this eagle
[11:30] anointing
[11:31] amen we see the church incarnate the
[11:34] church itself
[11:35] incarnate by the antichrist spirit by
[11:37] the devil himself
[11:38] amen bringing them to a system bringing
[11:41] them to
[11:42] the image of the beast amen and then we
[11:44] see
[11:45] god himself incarnate in his church the
[11:47] bride
[11:48] and those two facing off and in battle
[11:50] amen
[11:51] and then the bride overcoming going in
[11:53] the rapture
[11:54] then the devil coming down and
[11:56] incarnating the head of this system
[11:58] which is the pope
[11:59] amen and then going into the tribulation
[12:01] period
[12:03] so there's a lot that happens and we're
[12:05] right here we're right here friends this
[12:07] is what's happening to us it's exciting
[12:12] so we see we've come to the pale horse
[12:13] which is spiritual death it's also
[12:15] physical death but we want to focus on
[12:17] the spiritual side
[12:18] the incarnate devil and to combat that
[12:21] is the eagle
[12:22] we know the eagle is god himself and
[12:25] it's prophets
[12:26] and the children of god now the fourth
[12:28] seal
[12:29] you understand the fourth seal when it
[12:31] transitions into the tribulation period
[12:34] that's when the devil is fully incarnate
[12:36] and one man and
[12:38] the bride is gone unleashing full
[12:40] tribulation
[12:42] upon the earth but that doesn't mean the
[12:44] eagle anointing has left because we see
[12:46] when the bride goes
[12:47] two eagles rise up amen in revelations
[12:50] 11
[12:51] to the 144 000 and the eagle anointing
[12:54] continues on
[12:55] and the fourth seal and goes all the way
[12:57] to the end of the tribulation period
[13:00] so the fourth seal and the sixth seal
[13:02] very much run on parallel tracks
[13:05] we'll see this as we go further we'll
[13:06] see that they're running together the
[13:08] fourth seal and the sixth seal
[13:11] hallelujah
[13:14] so we see these two great forces
[13:18] standing off as we come through as we've
[13:21] come through the church ages we see
[13:23] the tactics of the enemy and we see what
[13:25] god's going to do to overcome the
[13:27] tactics each time
[13:28] and how god has and and what has worked
[13:31] will always work
[13:32] once god set a pattern he doesn't change
[13:33] his pattern the pattern stays true
[13:38] and then the fourth seal brother baby
[13:40] says oh my and notice yet he gave her
[13:42] space to repent
[13:43] and he's speaking of the catholic church
[13:45] now he gave her space to
[13:47] repent but she did she didn't do it he's
[13:50] done it again
[13:51] she won't do it her rejection away
[13:54] makes her rejection makes a perfect way
[13:56] for satan to come into her and be
[13:58] incarnate incarnate himself right in her
[14:01] because she rejected the word
[14:03] and he's speaking of the catholic church
[14:05] or the mother
[14:07] and that's exactly the same thing that
[14:09] the protestant church becomes a harlot
[14:12] is
[14:12] because she rejects the vindicated truth
[14:14] of the word of god and that gives the
[14:16] devil a place to come right in
[14:18] and incarnate himself and he will make
[14:21] an image into the beast when they
[14:22] consolidate together
[14:24] right yonder now and go on and do just
[14:26] exactly what he said
[14:29] so brother brahms showing us a principle
[14:31] where where
[14:32] this this uh this devil this antichrist
[14:35] spirit
[14:35] goes into the church amen making up a
[14:38] perfect scenario for him to be incarnate
[14:40] and they come into the catholic church
[14:42] giving space to repent and they don't
[14:44] and then we see the same thing happen to
[14:45] the protestants
[14:48] and when it happens to the protestants
[14:49] now now the protestants when he comes in
[14:52] and incarnates himself
[14:53] he works them around to make an image
[14:55] unto the beast
[14:57] hallelujah so if he's there
[15:00] if he's injected himself into the false
[15:02] vine
[15:03] making an image into the beast amen we
[15:05] know that
[15:06] the devil is only imitating what god
[15:08] does
[15:09] that's all he ever does he's an imitator
[15:12] and he cannot create he only perverts he
[15:14] only watch what god's
[15:15] doing and tries to imitate what god's
[15:17] doing he he can't do anything else
[15:20] he has no new thoughts amen he just
[15:23] watches god
[15:24] and he wants to be like god so he tries
[15:26] to emulate what god is doing
[15:28] and he does it in deception so now we
[15:31] see
[15:31] that he injects himself to build this
[15:34] great image
[15:35] unto the beast amen and when they when
[15:37] they build this image into the beast
[15:39] now it sets up a throne amen so there
[15:42] could be a head
[15:43] of this image of the beast which is a
[15:45] system a consolidation of churches
[15:47] and when they build this system now the
[15:49] devil himself can come down
[15:51] amen incarnate one person
[15:54] so it's got to be the devil incarnated
[15:57] into the church
[15:58] to bring the place amen for the
[16:00] incarnation of one
[16:02] one person and now we find that the
[16:04] church is doing the same thing
[16:06] she's been incarnated with the very life
[16:08] of jesus christ amen
[16:09] bringing about amen a throne for one man
[16:12] to sit on in the millennial reign and
[16:14] that's jesus christ hallelujah
[16:16] so they run parallel tracks amen
[16:20] so the devil is only imitating what god
[16:22] is doing
[16:23] so if he's getting if he's getting into
[16:26] the church
[16:26] to build an image of the beast an
[16:30] image of the beast which is the
[16:32] incarnate devil
[16:34] then in the true church god has injected
[16:38] himself in incarnation in the true
[16:40] church
[16:40] to build the church into the image of
[16:43] jesus christ
[16:44] [Music]
[16:45] same thing amen on both sides so now
[16:48] they're working together by the
[16:50] incarnate devil when he's full-blown
[16:52] antichrist
[16:53] with with no holds left in the false
[16:55] system he's building
[16:56] an image to the beast and over here in
[16:59] god's kingdom
[17:00] through god injecting himself into
[17:02] church they're building an image
[17:04] not to the beast but to jesus christ and
[17:06] it's christ in the formation of the
[17:08] bride
[17:09] christ in bride form amen in the image
[17:12] of jesus christ
[17:13] the bride then the image of the
[17:16] bridegroom hallelujah
[17:19] that's where we are the devil's only
[17:21] copying what god has already had in his
[17:22] mind to do
[17:23] what god has already declared he will do
[17:25] the devil is only copying it
[17:28] so whatever you see him doing you know
[17:30] assuredly he got that pattern from
[17:32] somewhere
[17:33] hallelujah
[17:39] and the third seal brother ben says the
[17:40] first three stages of them that went
[17:42] into the dark age
[17:43] song the first three church ages went
[17:45] into the dark age
[17:46] then the third three stages come the
[17:48] church out
[17:49] from justification sanctification
[17:52] baptism of the holy ghost
[17:54] incarnate god made manifest among us
[17:58] here he comes in as the antichrist is
[18:00] the false prophet then the beast in the
[18:01] dark ages
[18:02] and the church comes out of the dark age
[18:04] justification sanctification
[18:06] baptism of holy ghost incarnate word the
[18:09] way
[18:10] now hallelujah i like that
[18:16] incarnate word we we know
[18:19] we know that the devil
[18:22] is injecting himself into the false vine
[18:25] how by perverted word
[18:28] how did he eject himself into creation
[18:31] at the beginning
[18:32] he injected himself by perverted seed
[18:35] and the seed is the word
[18:36] and so he's injecting himself by
[18:38] perverting the seed and he's still
[18:40] perverting the seed bringing
[18:41] hybridization to the false vine
[18:43] but the way god is injecting himself
[18:46] into his bride
[18:47] is with pure seed and with pure seed
[18:49] where the word has returned amen to the
[18:52] church
[18:52] and that pure seed is coming to the
[18:54] virgin now he's
[18:55] incarnate by injecting pure word back
[18:58] into the virgin bride
[19:02] that's the incarnation of god
[19:05] hallelujah so we see the
[19:09] in the fourth seal he says notice the
[19:11] antichrist was on a pale horse
[19:13] mixed color horse and before we get in
[19:15] this i don't want to go that far yet
[19:18] i want to i'm trying to hold myself back
[19:22] franco knows i was in a mess today i had
[19:25] to cut half of my notes clear out and
[19:27] save it for sunday
[19:28] so lord was we were in a mess friends
[19:32] so keep pulling
[19:37] i want to back up and i want to read
[19:38] something i don't want to skip over this
[19:40] but in john 14 verse 18 brother or jesus
[19:43] says
[19:44] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[19:45] come to you yet a little while and the
[19:47] world sees me no more but
[19:49] ye see me because i live ye shall live
[19:52] also
[19:53] at that day you shall know that i am in
[19:54] my father and ye and me
[19:57] and i in you now realize that that
[20:00] whenever jesus is doing something and
[20:03] talking to his disciples
[20:04] he's setting forth a pattern because
[20:07] everything in the scripture sets forth a
[20:09] pattern
[20:09] and the pattern will not be broken and
[20:12] so now
[20:13] jesus is is there he's with the
[20:15] disciples but he's going to die
[20:17] he's going to leave them but he's laying
[20:20] down a pattern that says the world won't
[20:22] see me
[20:22] anymore but ye see me because i live you
[20:25] shall live also at that day
[20:27] you shall know that i am in my father
[20:30] and ye and me
[20:31] and i in you and so we know that there's
[20:33] a fulfillment of this when we come to
[20:35] the day of pentecost
[20:36] because on the day of pentecost we know
[20:38] that he incarnates himself
[20:40] back into the church again and now they
[20:42] realize
[20:43] that that he is in the father the
[20:45] fathers in him he's in them they're all
[20:46] one
[20:47] amen by injection of the holy ghost into
[20:49] the church
[20:50] so they have a realization of that but
[20:52] remember the word is eternal the word
[20:54] doesn't have an expiration date
[20:56] it's eternal and god set a pattern there
[20:59] and when the church would fall from the
[21:00] pure word amen and now
[21:02] fall away god is still going to keep
[21:05] this word
[21:07] there's going to come a time that in the
[21:09] churches the world does not see him
[21:12] they don't see him in the churches they
[21:14] see hybridization and compromise
[21:16] and they see portions of the word but
[21:18] they don't see him but there's going to
[21:20] come a time
[21:21] amen when we shall see him
[21:26] how many scene is appearing hallelujah
[21:30] we shall see him and at that day you
[21:33] shall know that i am in the father and
[21:34] he and me and i and you
[21:36] brother braham said in uniting time and
[21:38] sign we see the nations uniting we see
[21:40] the world uniting
[21:41] we see the churches uniting we see the
[21:43] bride uniting
[21:45] uniting with the word the word is god
[21:50] and as the word as the bridegroom being
[21:52] the word
[21:53] and the bride being the hearer of the
[21:54] word they come together in a union
[21:58] they unite like a wedding see they're
[21:59] getting ready for a wedding
[22:01] and they become one the word becomes you
[22:04] you become the word jesus said at that
[22:07] day
[22:08] all the father is i am and all i am you
[22:11] are and all you are i
[22:12] am and that day you'll know that i am in
[22:15] the father
[22:16] the father in me i and you and you and
[22:19] me
[22:19] now brother branham is referring right
[22:22] back to that scripture he gave the
[22:23] disciples before he died
[22:25] amen and now brother branham brings that
[22:27] right out and he says you'll know
[22:29] and what's he talking about he's talking
[22:31] about when the bride
[22:32] unites with the word uniting time and
[22:34] signs
[22:35] when the virgin bride receives the seed
[22:38] word of god
[22:39] and the two unite together for the
[22:41] wedding become one
[22:42] amen that's what he's referring to then
[22:45] he goes right to this scripture
[22:47] in that day you'll know that i'm in the
[22:48] father the father and me i and you and
[22:50] you and me
[22:51] at that day what day this day
[22:54] [Applause]
[22:55] [Music]
[22:57] hallelujah we find out the great hidden
[23:00] mysteries of god
[23:01] being revealed
[23:04] so you read that in the scripture and
[23:06] god had laid down a pattern right there
[23:08] in the scripture
[23:09] and he's not going to change the pattern
[23:11] because that happened that had a
[23:13] fulfillment in pentecost
[23:14] but when they fell away from the word
[23:17] now there had to come a future uniting
[23:19] signs and times
[23:20] when the bride would unite the virgin
[23:22] bride would unite with the word
[23:24] and in that uniting time then you would
[23:26] know that i am in the father the father
[23:27] in me i and you and you and me
[23:29] what day this day
[23:33] hallelujah in the third seal the prophet
[23:36] of god said god promised the spiritual
[23:38] eve
[23:39] as same as he did the natural eve that
[23:42] again
[23:43] the word would be restored to her
[23:46] amen in the last days he would restore
[23:49] to the
[23:50] church he would restore the church to
[23:53] the original
[23:54] word again this is what they fell from
[23:57] the word
[23:58] this is what he felt from the word and
[24:00] there was a promise
[24:01] that he would send the seed of the woman
[24:03] and that seed of the woman is jesus
[24:05] christ
[24:05] the word so he promised all the way back
[24:09] in the garden of eden when the woman
[24:11] fell he promised that the word would
[24:13] come back
[24:14] in full manifestation and brother bam
[24:17] said what would he send the word for
[24:19] for redemption when the full word came
[24:23] it was time to redeem back fallen eve
[24:26] because the full word was present
[24:28] but when the full word came amen now
[24:30] that spiritual eve the hebrew church
[24:33] they held onto substitutes instead of
[24:35] moving to the full word
[24:36] they didn't want to unite amen with the
[24:38] word amen so so they rejected the word
[24:41] when he came
[24:43] so he he moved over amen away from the
[24:46] jews and to the gentiles
[24:48] and on the day of pentecost amend the
[24:50] word united with the bride
[24:53] hallelujah but just like
[24:57] eve did in the garden of eden amen she
[25:00] fell
[25:00] from that word and the ephesus began to
[25:03] compromise under the white horse rider
[25:05] and seducing spirits began to take her
[25:07] away from the original word
[25:08] and when that happened that prophecy
[25:11] that was laying all the way back in the
[25:13] garden of eden
[25:14] god has to keep that word because the
[25:16] word has to come for redemption
[25:18] and if there's ever falling away there
[25:20] has to be a redemption
[25:24] and the only way to bring redemption
[25:26] because we fell from the word
[25:27] the only way to bring redemption is to
[25:29] bring back the word
[25:30] and then unite to the full word brings
[25:33] us back to full redemption
[25:37] see once the pattern is set the pattern
[25:39] never changes
[25:42] god is so good to us
[25:45] prophet says in the feast of trumpets
[25:47] and the seventh angel's message
[25:49] under the same trumpet same everything
[25:51] now he's comparing the seventh trumpet
[25:53] to the jews
[25:54] which are the two witnesses that'll
[25:56] bring them under the feast of trumpets
[25:59] the feast of trumpets is the sixth feast
[26:02] in the jewish feast and the feast of
[26:04] trumpets are to bring them blow the
[26:06] trumpets bring them in for an assembly
[26:08] to bring them to the feast of atonement
[26:10] that their sins are covered
[26:12] right and so these two these two
[26:15] prophets in revelations 11
[26:17] are the seventh trumpet their message is
[26:19] the seventh trumpet
[26:20] and the seventh trumpet is bringing them
[26:22] back to atonement where they recognize
[26:24] that they have crucified the lord of
[26:26] glory
[26:27] and they separate into their homes and
[26:28] they mourn as one that's lost his only
[26:30] son
[26:32] and so so they're bringing them back but
[26:34] brother bennam's is
[26:35] is paralleling that with the seventh
[26:37] seal
[26:39] the seventh angel's message under the
[26:41] same trumpet same everything exactly
[26:43] the same seal is to what call the people
[26:47] the bride
[26:48] out of the pentecostal and world
[26:49] traditions to
[26:51] the genuine atonement the word
[26:55] i thought i thought the atonement was
[26:57] the blood absolutely
[26:59] the shedding of human blood was the
[27:01] price that had to be paid
[27:03] because there was a problem with the
[27:04] blood but remember it was the word
[27:07] made flesh that was pierced and bled
[27:11] so it was the bleeding of the word when
[27:14] the word was made flesh that purchased
[27:16] redemption
[27:17] so redemption was in the full word
[27:20] so now under the seventh seal the
[27:23] seventh church age messenger just like
[27:25] the two prophets will do to the 144
[27:27] thousand
[27:28] bring them to true atonement amen
[27:32] now the seventh angel angel messenger
[27:35] under the seventh seal
[27:36] is bringing the church the gentiles true
[27:39] the true to the true atonement
[27:41] which is the word because when the word
[27:44] is restored
[27:45] back to the woman the seed of the woman
[27:48] is brought back
[27:49] and when it's brought back it's brought
[27:50] back for one purpose and one purpose
[27:52] only
[27:53] and that's redemption you cannot find
[27:57] redemption
[27:57] in this age when the word's restored you
[28:00] cannot find redemption
[28:01] any other place if you're part of the
[28:03] gentiles any other place
[28:05] outside of the seventh seal message from
[28:08] a seventh church age messenger
[28:10] to bring the word back in its fullness
[28:12] which is the true atonement
[28:16] else will bring redemption because she
[28:18] has to unite with the word
[28:24] god is super good
[28:30] so in the fourth seal we touched on this
[28:33] sunday but in the fourth seal
[28:34] he said now they were gods
[28:38] and men if you become born in the family
[28:40] of your family name
[28:42] you are a son and a part of your father
[28:46] what's he saying he's saying
[28:49] those prophets were the gods and and
[28:52] he's going to begin to speak about the
[28:54] this in just a minute but he says if
[28:56] you're born
[28:57] in your family then
[29:00] then you're of your family name you're a
[29:03] son
[29:03] and part of your father so if if your
[29:06] father amen is a caucasian-american
[29:10] then you're a caucasian-american if your
[29:13] father is a black african you're a black
[29:16] african
[29:18] you're part of your father but if your
[29:20] father is
[29:21] god and you're born of your father
[29:24] then that makes you god
[29:29] amen it makes you an offspring of god
[29:33] we've said this before if a cat has an
[29:36] offspring it's a cat
[29:37] if a dog has an offspring it's a dog but
[29:39] if god has an
[29:40] offspring it's a god
[29:45] in that day you'll know that i am in the
[29:47] father the father of me i and you and
[29:49] you and me
[29:50] why because he's dwelling he's come back
[29:52] to miss ayats
[29:53] come back to fully redeem sons and
[29:55] daughters of god coming back to their
[29:57] position
[30:00] and when she knows what she is and that
[30:02] she can do the greater works
[30:04] she will be an invincible army
[30:07] hallelujah
[30:09] i like it and then we're in the four
[30:13] seal and then when sin came in
[30:15] we found out the man crossed the chasm
[30:18] he was separated from god
[30:22] and the blood of bulls and goats covered
[30:23] but did not remit until the real bleach
[30:25] came
[30:26] that could take the stain of sin and
[30:28] break it completely to pieces
[30:30] and send it back upon its original
[30:32] perverter that was satan
[30:34] then it got back to satan he waits his
[30:36] time of eternal annihilation
[30:38] now that shows what we believe we
[30:40] believe that he will absolutely be done
[30:41] completely away
[30:42] and annihilated so how is he going to be
[30:45] done away with and annihilated he just
[30:48] told us that when a believer a
[30:50] child of god comes to redemption and
[30:52] passes through the bleach of the blood
[30:53] of jesus christ
[30:54] it breaks the sin off of him and sends
[30:56] it back to the original perverter
[30:58] which is satan and then with that on his
[31:01] record that on his shoulders
[31:03] he awaits his time of annihilation so it
[31:06] is you
[31:07] amen it is you making your choice in
[31:09] this life
[31:10] to choose the word amen and we know you
[31:12] can never make that choice unless you
[31:14] were predestinated
[31:15] but yet god did say brother brahm did
[31:17] say that you had to come to this life to
[31:20] be tested
[31:20] to be tried to make your choice
[31:24] and when you come and make your choice
[31:26] and accept the true atonement the word
[31:29] that's always been the atonement in
[31:31] every age has always been the word for
[31:32] that age
[31:33] when you accept the true atonement the
[31:35] word then the sin
[31:36] that you've carried through life the sin
[31:38] you were born with the sin that was
[31:40] accumulated in your life
[31:41] it's broke off of you and sent back to
[31:43] the perverter
[31:44] which is satan and now he waits his time
[31:47] of annihilation
[31:48] you don't have to wait any time
[31:50] annihilation you don't have to wait for
[31:52] any kind of judgment amen you've passed
[31:54] from death unto life
[31:55] amen there's nothing for you to be
[31:57] judged for you're as righteous as god is
[31:59] righteous
[32:00] because you're in jesus christ
[32:04] so now he why do you think he fights
[32:07] this revelation so much
[32:09] why do you think he tries to make it so
[32:10] hard for you to believe that you're one
[32:12] of them
[32:13] because when you accept it when you can
[32:15] identify with it when you can identify
[32:17] with your sacrifice and lay your hands
[32:19] on it
[32:20] and it and notice that it's dead and
[32:22] carried your sins far away
[32:24] he's the one held completely responsible
[32:26] for all of your life
[32:29] and he waits his time of annihilation
[32:32] and you wonder why you have mental
[32:33] battles that's the exact reason you have
[32:35] mental battles
[32:37] he doesn't want this to be awakened in
[32:38] you he doesn't want you to come to this
[32:40] revelation
[32:41] he wants you to always feel guilty
[32:44] but i have nothing to feel guilty for
[32:48] there is therefore no condemnation to
[32:50] them that are in christ jesus
[32:52] there's no reason for you to feel guilty
[32:54] if you've come to full repentance amen
[32:56] and you've if you've if you've made
[32:58] yourself a sacrifice and you've laid it
[33:00] all out and you've come to full
[33:01] repentance and you identified
[33:03] with the true word for your day the true
[33:05] atonement then you've
[33:06] you've passed through the bleach of the
[33:08] blood of jesus christ then god himself
[33:10] cannot even remember your sins anymore
[33:13] amen what in the world are you bringing
[33:14] them up again for
[33:16] don't remind god of what he has
[33:18] forgotten about
[33:22] you cannot stand judgment for it amen
[33:24] it's already been judged for
[33:26] it's already been removed from you and
[33:28] now lucifer satan himself will stand the
[33:31] judgment for that thing
[33:32] don't take it back leave it
[33:36] hallelujah
[33:42] when it got back to satan he waits his
[33:44] time of annihilation
[33:47] i believe that sin will be broke up and
[33:48] when it's confessed upon the basis of
[33:50] the blood of jesus christ it's like
[33:52] dropping a drop of black
[33:53] ink into a bunch of clorox bleach it
[33:55] just breaks it into chemical and sends
[33:57] it plumb back to where it come from
[33:59] and that's the way the blood of jesus
[34:00] christ does when that sets a man across
[34:03] the chasm again
[34:04] as a son of god now because of sin we
[34:07] were put across the chasm separated from
[34:09] god
[34:09] but when you come through the bleach of
[34:10] the blood of jesus christ it puts you
[34:12] back
[34:12] across the chasm and now you're standing
[34:15] on god's side
[34:19] hey i like to be on that side
[34:24] see now when you cross the chasm again
[34:27] as son of god see
[34:28] and then he becomes why even he's the
[34:31] creative
[34:32] power of god is in him
[34:35] now catch this when brother branham said
[34:38] that you've you've moved from across the
[34:41] chasm
[34:42] as a redeemed son of god because only
[34:44] the redeemable can move across this
[34:46] chasm friends
[34:48] so that which was lost that's now found
[34:50] comes
[34:51] back and is on the side of god he says
[34:53] now
[34:54] the creative power of god is in him
[35:00] do you believe that we're going to have
[35:02] to
[35:06] listen the creative power of god is in
[35:08] him and at least whenever god commands
[35:11] it to be done
[35:12] it'll be done remember somebody asked
[35:16] brother branham a question and we want
[35:17] to keep this straight
[35:18] they asked brother branham a question
[35:20] about the spoken word he said now that
[35:22] you've manifested the spoken word and
[35:23] i'm just paraphrasing but i can show you
[35:25] where it is if you really need to know
[35:27] he says now that you manifest a spoken
[35:30] word you could
[35:31] be speak some to somebody and they could
[35:34] be put
[35:35] in perfect condition ready for the
[35:37] rapture
[35:40] so they're saying now that you can
[35:41] manifest the spoken word speak squirrels
[35:43] and says and speak to a storm
[35:45] speak to hattie wright's boys now that
[35:46] you can do that now you've got that
[35:48] power manifest
[35:50] you could speak to somebody and put them
[35:52] in a perfect condition ready for the
[35:56] rapture
[35:58] how do you think brother brown is going
[35:58] to answer that one
[36:01] you know the first word he says yes
[36:08] yes that's true
[36:11] he said but listen friends and i'm just
[36:13] paraphrasing
[36:14] you have to watch he said those things
[36:17] were done by permission
[36:20] he told me to do them
[36:23] amen you have to realize if you say unto
[36:26] this mountain be plucked up and cast the
[36:27] sea and doubt not in your heart
[36:30] see it takes perfect faith to perform
[36:33] this
[36:33] in perfect faith when god speaks to you
[36:35] and says say what you want i got a
[36:37] feeling that'll produce perfect faith
[36:40] not you're just presuming or trying
[36:42] something or throwing some darts to see
[36:43] if they'll stick
[36:44] that's not perfect faith we're not
[36:46] playing around with this but the
[36:48] creative power of god is in you
[36:50] if you've crossed the chasm the creative
[36:52] power of god is in
[36:54] you and whenever god calls for it you
[36:57] can speak
[36:58] and it'll create but these things are
[37:01] done by permission
[37:04] now remember this is this is unique this
[37:07] kind of permission that was given to the
[37:09] prophet
[37:09] because when he was given permission to
[37:11] speak he wasn't told what to say
[37:17] god now this is really important
[37:20] because when a prophet when a normally
[37:22] when a prophet
[37:23] would be given a prophecy he is told
[37:26] exactly what to say
[37:28] and he repeats verbatim what was just
[37:30] told to him that's how a prophet
[37:32] operates
[37:32] when god speaks lip to ear to the
[37:34] prophet and the prophet prophesies
[37:37] but this manifestation of the third pool
[37:39] was totally different than that
[37:41] it was not prophecy friends it was a son
[37:44] of god come back into position now
[37:47] you have permission from god to speak
[37:49] and he says
[37:50] whatever you say that's how it will be
[37:56] you got that that means that this
[37:59] prophet
[37:59] this this son of god that was redeemed
[38:02] had come to such a place
[38:03] and he had such character and he'd been
[38:05] so tested that
[38:07] god could perfectly trust that he will
[38:09] say
[38:10] what god would say
[38:13] that's why adam was given permission to
[38:15] name the animals because adam was just
[38:18] like his father
[38:19] and when adam was there god was not
[38:21] worried about what adam would say
[38:23] god was given power over the creation he
[38:26] could move this tree from here to there
[38:28] he could rearrange the garden but god
[38:30] wasn't upset because adam was so much
[38:32] like god
[38:33] he knew that adam would do what he would
[38:34] do
[38:35] [Applause]
[38:38] she has the mind of christ
[38:41] that's what these messages are giving us
[38:43] that's what the revelation is giving us
[38:45] it's giving us the very mind of god what
[38:47] was in the back part of god's mind for
[38:50] generations and generations has now been
[38:52] brought out by a prophet
[38:54] amen and now we're taking the mind of
[38:56] god in
[38:57] and we're building character through
[38:59] trials and tribulations
[39:01] and testings and successes and failures
[39:03] what's he doing
[39:04] he's building that christ-like character
[39:06] back into the bride
[39:08] so that when he needs to he can say you
[39:12] say
[39:14] and it'll be exactly what you say
[39:17] but god will not will not move down that
[39:20] road unless there's christ-like
[39:22] character
[39:23] in full maturity in the bride of jesus
[39:25] christ
[39:26] amen you wouldn't give your toddler a
[39:28] pistol
[39:30] why would god give the power of the
[39:32] spoken word to an immature bride
[39:34] amen amen
[39:37] he says creative power of god is in him
[39:40] and at least whenever god
[39:42] can command it to be done it'll be done
[39:45] and when moses under the blood of bulls
[39:47] and when he met that light that pillar
[39:49] of fire in the burning bush
[39:50] and he stood down there on a commission
[39:52] god had given him and he was a prophet
[39:53] and when the word of the lord came to
[39:55] him he spoke and even things created
[39:57] by the word and now if it'll do that
[40:00] under that the blood of bulls and what
[40:02] about the blood of jesus
[40:04] not covered but remitted altogether
[40:08] meaning you have no sin
[40:12] you stand in the presence of god as a
[40:14] redeemed son now the church is
[40:16] far beyond its standard of living
[40:20] when i read that i say oh god i want to
[40:22] get back to my standard of living
[40:24] i want to come back to my rightful
[40:26] position what redemption has purchased
[40:28] for me
[40:28] let me come back to faith in the word of
[40:31] god
[40:32] amen we've fallen from faith friends
[40:34] we've fallen because of laodicea we've
[40:36] fallen because of church tradition
[40:37] and we've come to a place where we've
[40:39] accepted things as not in the word
[40:42] and we question things that are clearly
[40:43] written in the word but god is bringing
[40:45] a people back to perfect faith in a
[40:47] perfect word amen
[40:50] back to that place where we just take it
[40:52] as he said it and believe it
[40:56] he says again in the fourth seal that's
[40:58] what the blood of jesus christ
[40:59] does to the true child of god when he
[41:02] confesses that sin and stands there
[41:04] justified
[41:05] mercy goodness even it's so great till
[41:07] god said i can't even remember it
[41:09] anymore and he's absolutely my son
[41:11] verily i say unto you if you say to this
[41:13] mountain he connects these two
[41:16] he says when he's come to the blood god
[41:20] says i can't even remember it no more
[41:21] and he's perfectly my son
[41:23] verily i say unto you if you say unto
[41:25] this mountain be moved and doubt not in
[41:27] your heart but believe in what you said
[41:29] it shall come to pass you can have that
[41:31] what you have said
[41:33] you are a redeemed son amen i know
[41:36] that's true
[41:38] brother branham put that one to the test
[41:42] and he knows it's true
[41:45] he's not guessing he's not doubting he
[41:48] knows that one's true
[41:54] the fourth seal prophet says now notice
[41:57] the antichrist was on a pale horse mixed
[41:59] color
[42:00] a horse is a beast that represents a
[42:02] power his power is all mixed up
[42:04] it's political it's national powers it's
[42:07] religious powers
[42:08] it's demon powers it's all kinds of
[42:11] powers mixed together
[42:13] a mixed pale horse he's got all kinds of
[42:15] powers
[42:17] but when jesus comes it's on it's on a
[42:20] one
[42:20] solid colored horse the word
[42:25] now now don't don't project this way
[42:27] down the road friends or you're going to
[42:29] miss something glorious here
[42:31] he's going to come riding on a white
[42:33] horse in revelations 19
[42:35] but first before he comes physically he
[42:36] comes spiritually amen
[42:38] and he says what's this he said a horse
[42:40] is a power what's the power that he
[42:45] comes riding on
[42:47] the word has the word come
[42:50] has the lord come what did he come on he
[42:53] came riding on the power of the word
[42:59] i'll give you a little secret we're not
[43:02] there yet in the fourth seal but i'll
[43:03] give you a little secret
[43:05] he comes writing to the church in this
[43:08] day
[43:09] on the power of the word
[43:13] but that's not how he leaves in the
[43:14] rapture
[43:16] brother branham said he rides his church
[43:18] right into glory
[43:21] what's the power the power that brings
[43:23] him is the word what's the power that
[43:24] takes him
[43:25] the word made manifest in the bride and
[43:27] he rides that power
[43:29] right on into glory in the rapture
[43:33] that makes you the white horse friends
[43:35] that makes you the manifested word
[43:37] that makes christ riding that power on
[43:40] this earth the manifested word and bride
[43:42] form and he rides it right into glory
[43:44] [Music]
[43:46] that's a direct quote brother craig
[43:49] hallelujah
[43:50] oh brothers sisters we got to know who
[43:54] we are
[43:55] we've got to know what we are amen
[43:58] you're not going to get your
[43:58] identification at walmart and your job
[44:01] is not going to tell you who you are but
[44:02] when you look in the mirror of the word
[44:04] it's reflecting back
[44:05] you're a son of god you're a son of god
[44:08] redemption is here
[44:09] come to a fully redeemed son and
[44:11] daughter of god
[44:12] hallelujah it's all kinds of powers
[44:16] mixed he comes on a white horse the word
[44:18] amen
[44:18] this one mixes its colors of red white
[44:21] black three colors in one represented in
[44:23] one
[44:23] and three powers represented in one a
[44:25] white horse a black horse
[44:27] red horse three crowns in one sure i
[44:30] seen the crown myself he's talking about
[44:32] the triple crown of the pope
[44:34] stood all that close and looked at it
[44:35] wouldn't let me get to it on the count
[44:37] of the glass so
[44:38] there was a big lock on it sitting in a
[44:40] case triple crown
[44:41] so i know it's the truth so there he was
[44:43] triple crown vicar of heaven purgatory
[44:45] earth
[44:46] three powers united together see all
[44:48] mixed up in color
[44:49] pale death spoke it in the whole thing
[44:52] political
[44:53] religious demon powers mixed together
[44:57] so when he comes on this this pale horse
[44:59] it's the religious power
[45:01] the political power and the demon power
[45:04] mixed together now remember what we said
[45:07] in the beginning
[45:08] the devil is only an impersonator
[45:11] the devil is copying what god is doing
[45:13] in a perverted way
[45:14] he doesn't have his own method he
[45:16] doesn't have his own way
[45:18] he is copying and so we find all these
[45:20] three
[45:21] come into one and to death
[45:25] brother branham said in the fourth seal
[45:27] i'm in paragraph 166 he says just
[45:30] exactly like the church grows his church
[45:32] went from antichrist to false prophet
[45:35] and the great age to come the beast that
[45:37] is to rise up so the church comes the
[45:39] same way
[45:40] through justification sanctification the
[45:43] baptism of holy ghost is christ
[45:45] being in the people just exactly
[45:49] so we know that these three powers
[45:51] coming together
[45:52] is is the the antichrist spirit the
[45:56] devil
[45:56] putting himself into the church which
[45:59] will build
[46:00] a world council the churches build an
[46:02] image to the beast
[46:03] and when that rises up and creates a
[46:06] head
[46:06] a throne then he'll fully incarnate that
[46:09] position
[46:10] so we know those three powers blended
[46:12] together it is bringing
[46:14] that to pass but but brother brahma
[46:16] tells us
[46:17] that that's the same way god has done
[46:19] through justification sanctification the
[46:21] baptism of the holy ghost
[46:22] is christ being in the people
[46:26] and he's got the type of it rather just
[46:28] exactly so he's just typing what god's
[46:30] doing
[46:33] so how is god have three powers mixed
[46:36] together
[46:37] we know justification sanctification
[46:39] baptism holy ghost
[46:40] but the devil is using political
[46:43] power and force religious power and
[46:46] force
[46:47] amen in demon power and force and
[46:49] uniting them together
[46:51] right religious political demonic
[46:56] he's only copying god
[47:01] because god has made us kings and
[47:02] priests
[47:04] a king is political a priest
[47:07] is religious and the holy ghost is
[47:10] spiritual
[47:11] so while on one side you have a
[47:13] combination of
[47:14] the physic you have a combination of
[47:16] political
[47:17] religious and demon power on the other
[47:20] side you have the combination of forces
[47:23] of political kings religious priests
[47:27] and full of the holy ghost spiritual
[47:29] combined together to combat that
[47:31] antichrist system
[47:33] that's why you've been called kings and
[47:34] priests and filled with the holy ghost
[47:36] is because he's only copying what god is
[47:38] already doing
[47:39] and god is uniting his political force
[47:42] of the son of david
[47:43] with his religious force with the priest
[47:45] of the high after the order of the high
[47:47] priest of melchizedek
[47:48] united together with this spiritual
[47:50] power of the holy ghost making you
[47:52] redeem sons and daughters of god on this
[47:55] earth
[47:56] friends you're a force to be reckoned
[47:58] with all of heaven is backing you up
[48:00] political spiritual and and political
[48:03] religious and spiritual all combined
[48:06] together in this bride in the last days
[48:12] the devil isn't going to get anything
[48:13] over on you he doesn't have any tricks
[48:15] that god doesn't have a countermeasure
[48:16] to
[48:17] remember when the enemy comes in like a
[48:19] flood god raises up a standard
[48:20] when it when he brought a white horse
[48:22] god brought a lion amen when he brought
[48:24] a red horse god brought an ox
[48:25] when he brought a black horse god
[48:27] brought a man when he brought the pearl
[48:28] horse god brought the eagle which is god
[48:32] himself
[48:34] and now god has taken his kings and his
[48:36] priests
[48:37] and he has come himself
[48:40] upon the earth
[48:45] i get excited when i see stuff like this
[48:50] so christ injects himself
[48:53] into the people revelations 1 verse 4
[48:57] john to the seven churches which are in
[48:59] asia grace be unto you in peace
[49:02] from him which is and which was and
[49:04] which is to come and from the seven
[49:06] spirits which are before his throne
[49:08] and from jesus christ who is the
[49:09] faithful witness and the first begotten
[49:11] of the dead
[49:12] and the prince of the kings of the earth
[49:15] so he is the master or leader of all the
[49:18] kings of the earth
[49:20] now remember we read over here in
[49:24] revelations 5
[49:25] when they sang a new song and says that
[49:27] for that was slain
[49:29] and has redeemed us to god by the blood
[49:31] out of every kindred tongue and nation
[49:33] and has made us unto our god kings and
[49:35] priests and we shall reign
[49:36] on the earth amen and here is going to
[49:39] be the prince
[49:40] of the kings of the earth or the king of
[49:42] kings
[49:44] what are you going to be when you come
[49:45] back in the millennial reign a king
[49:48] and he's going to be the king over the
[49:50] kings
[49:52] unto him that loved us and washed us
[49:54] from our sins in his own blood
[49:55] and hath made us kings and priests unto
[49:58] god
[49:59] and his father to him be glory and
[50:01] dominion forever
[50:03] and ever amen that word
[50:06] hath is past tense
[50:10] he hath made us by what by the washing
[50:12] of our sins by his own blood
[50:14] he has already made us kings and priests
[50:17] and when that full atonement comes back
[50:20] in pure form the word returns
[50:22] the full atonement amen the true
[50:24] atonement and fullness
[50:25] he brings us back into the condition
[50:28] that the blood brought us to in the
[50:29] first place
[50:30] which is kings and priests
[50:36] i'll tell you what
[50:39] when a beggar walks into a store
[50:44] he walks with his head hung down dirty
[50:47] maybe just enough money to buy a loaf of
[50:49] bread or whatever
[50:51] but when a king walks into a store he
[50:54] walks a lot differently
[50:57] amen when a criminal
[51:01] walks into a courtroom he walks a
[51:04] certain way
[51:06] but when a righteous man walks into a
[51:08] courtroom
[51:09] when the judge comes into the courtroom
[51:11] he walks a lot differently
[51:15] we shouldn't be walking through this
[51:16] life like a poor man we shouldn't be
[51:19] walking through this life like a
[51:20] criminal
[51:20] we shouldn't be walking through this
[51:22] life with guilt and condemnation
[51:24] he by his blood hath made us kings and
[51:26] priests
[51:27] and we will reign on this earth amen and
[51:30] we know in the millennial reign we'll
[51:32] have a physical reign on this earth
[51:34] but brother branham tells us we're to be
[51:36] raiding now
[51:41] this was god's purpose all along back in
[51:44] exodus
[51:45] when they come out and they come to
[51:46] mount sinai moses goes up and he talks
[51:49] with god this is before the law was
[51:51] given friends
[51:52] this is before they accept the law so
[51:54] then moses went up unto god and the lord
[51:56] called unto him out of the mountain
[51:57] saying thus
[51:58] shalt thou say to the house of jacob and
[52:00] tell the children of israel
[52:01] you have seen what i did unto the
[52:03] egyptian and how i bore you
[52:05] on eagle's wings
[52:08] what were the eagles wings the prophetic
[52:10] ministry through moses
[52:12] he brought him out of egypt and bore
[52:14] them on eagle's wings amen
[52:16] he said i bore you on eagle's wings and
[52:18] brought you unto myself
[52:21] remember when god sets a pattern he
[52:22] never changes it we were stuck in
[52:24] egypt amen spiritual egypt amen in
[52:27] slavery and in bondage
[52:29] but he carried us out on eagle's wings
[52:31] because this is the eagle age
[52:33] this is the prophet age and he brought
[52:35] us out and he brought us unto
[52:37] himself this is
[52:40] speaking of the fourth seal
[52:43] now therefore if you will obey my voice
[52:46] indeed and keep my covenant then you
[52:48] shall be a peculiar
[52:49] treasure unto me above all people for
[52:52] all the earth is mine
[52:54] and you shall be unto me a kingdom of
[52:57] priests
[52:58] and a holy nation these are the words
[53:01] which thou
[53:02] shalt speak unto the children of israel
[53:05] god's original intent was not to set a
[53:07] priesthood over the people
[53:08] his original intent was to make the
[53:10] people a priesthood
[53:12] that they would be priest unto the whole
[53:14] world amen that's god's original intent
[53:16] and god once he sets an intent he never
[53:19] changes it that's always been his
[53:20] original intent
[53:22] to have a people amen that he can bring
[53:24] out on eagle's wings
[53:25] and bring to himself deliver them out of
[53:28] bondage but deliver them out of slavery
[53:30] bring them unto himself and have a
[53:32] peculiar treasure amen
[53:34] a kingdom of priests a holy nation
[53:38] that's why peter picks this up in first
[53:40] peter 2 9 but you are a chosen
[53:42] generation
[53:43] a royal priesthood a holy nation a
[53:46] peculiar people
[53:48] because that was his original intention
[53:50] for deliverance
[53:51] that was his original intentions for
[53:53] eagle's wings that was original
[53:55] intention to bring him to himself
[53:57] to make them a peculiar treasure a
[53:59] chosen people
[54:00] a holy nation a kingdom of priests
[54:04] god hasn't changed his mind friends he's
[54:05] just waiting for a people to get in that
[54:08] condition
[54:10] revelation 19 he says he had on his
[54:12] vesture and on his thigh a name written
[54:14] king of kings and lord
[54:18] of lords
[54:21] if he's the king of kings who are the
[54:24] kings
[54:26] he king singular is king of kings plural
[54:31] he lord singular is lord of lords plural
[54:36] who are the kings and who are the lords
[54:38] [Applause]
[54:41] amen we see this in revelations 19 when
[54:43] he's returning on a white horse
[54:45] and the armies of heaven follow after
[54:47] him amen and he has a name
[54:49] written king of kings where are the
[54:50] kings they're following after him
[54:52] and they're coming down to set up the
[54:54] kingdom of david upon the earth and he's
[54:57] going to sit a son of david upon the
[54:58] throne
[54:59] and we are going to rule and reign with
[55:01] him for a thousand years
[55:05] do you think there you're gonna walk
[55:07] around like ah just barely making it i
[55:09] can't hardly survive and we're just
[55:11] making ends me
[55:12] my goodness friends you're a king amen
[55:14] you're a lord upon the earth
[55:16] you're gonna act like it but it's time
[55:18] to act like it now
[55:20] not there now amen remember death
[55:22] doesn't change you it only changes your
[55:24] dwelling place amen
[55:28] redemption has brought us back by the
[55:30] washing of the water of the word full
[55:32] atonement is to bring us
[55:33] back as redeemed sons and daughters of
[55:35] god back to kings and priests upon the
[55:37] earth
[55:41] all kingdoms have failed
[55:44] all priesthood have failed every
[55:47] religion on the earth has failed
[55:49] every kingdom under the sun has failed
[55:52] they are everyone
[55:53] under the power of satan what this world
[55:56] needs is kings and priests
[56:02] in the church age book the revelation of
[56:04] jesus christ
[56:05] brother branham reads this scripture
[56:08] revelations 1
[56:09] 6 and he hath made us kings and priests
[56:11] unto god
[56:12] and his father to him be glory and
[56:13] dominion forever and ever amen
[56:15] he hath made us oh there are certain
[56:17] truths we need to emphasize
[56:19] this is one of them he he hath made
[56:23] us
[56:26] you didn't make yourself a king you
[56:28] didn't make yours there's no arrogance
[56:29] here there's no pride there's nothing
[56:31] puffed up you had nothing to do with
[56:32] that
[56:33] you were appointed you were ordained
[56:35] before the foundation of the world to
[56:37] stand on earth as a king and a priest
[56:39] amen you oh my goodness it's not your
[56:42] doing it's his doing
[56:43] and if you don't come to this position
[56:45] you're not honoring his will
[56:48] you're not honoring his word you're not
[56:50] honoring his desire
[56:51] when you stay in a broken down state and
[56:54] you stay in a pitiful state and unable
[56:57] to overcome
[56:58] you have missed the whole purpose of god
[57:00] and you are defying the very word and
[57:02] will of god
[57:03] because his word his will the
[57:05] restoration of the word
[57:07] to bring a fresh washing to the church
[57:09] to bring them back to their position as
[57:11] kings and priests
[57:12] [Applause]
[57:14] and when we let the world beat us down
[57:16] and let the world ridicule us and let
[57:18] the world
[57:18] name us and identify us we have missed
[57:21] the ordained purpose of god
[57:24] we've got to say what the word says and
[57:26] we got to say it until we believe it
[57:28] [Applause]
[57:30] i'm not a poor pitiful person barely
[57:32] making him
[57:33] you may be looking at my my fleshly
[57:35] condition
[57:36] amen but i don't care about my fleshly
[57:39] condition
[57:40] i have already amen moved into a
[57:43] spiritual condition
[57:44] by the new birth and i've been restored
[57:46] back across the chasm
[57:48] and i still stand with god as a fully
[57:50] redeemed son of god
[57:51] and i am on this earth as a
[57:53] representation of heaven
[57:56] an ambassador from heaven
[58:03] he hath made us salvation is his doing
[58:06] salvation is of the lord
[58:07] all of grace he redeemed us for a
[58:10] purpose
[58:12] he bought us for a purpose we
[58:15] are kings spiritual kings
[58:19] oh we are going to be kings upon the
[58:21] earth with him when he sits on his
[58:23] throne
[58:23] so here brother branham is breaking it
[58:25] down we will sit as kings in the
[58:27] millennium
[58:28] but brother branham is not limited to it
[58:29] sometime over there
[58:31] he's saying right now we are spiritual
[58:34] kings
[58:35] and we better be acting like it friends
[58:40] amen we are king spiritual kings oh we
[58:44] are going to be kings upon the earth
[58:45] with him
[58:46] when he sits on his throne but now we
[58:48] are spiritual kings and we reign
[58:50] over a spiritual kingdom that means you
[58:54] are
[58:54] reigning with christ today
[58:58] over a spiritual kingdom
[59:02] not a natural kingdom a spiritual
[59:05] kingdom
[59:08] so the question is in the spirit realm
[59:12] not the natural but the spirit realm
[59:15] who's in charge
[59:20] when the enemy comes in and brings
[59:22] sickness to your home in the spirit
[59:24] realm
[59:24] a demon power trying to afflict you
[59:28] who's in authority who's been made a
[59:33] spiritual king
[59:34] now
[59:38] who can take dominion over that now
[59:42] when an evil spirit starts to torment
[59:44] your mind amen that's the spirit realm
[59:48] not the natural realm the spirit realm
[59:50] when an evil spirit begins to torment
[59:52] your mind and trouble you
[59:54] amen that's a spiritual problem but we
[59:56] know that there's a king over the
[59:58] spiritual world
[59:59] and that king is the king of kings and
[1:00:02] that lord is the lord of lords and when
[1:00:04] we come to a spiritual kingdom
[1:00:06] then we have spiritual authority
[1:00:10] we need to exercise it with faith that
[1:00:12] doesn't mean you won't get sick that
[1:00:14] doesn't mean you won't stay sick
[1:00:15] god has things for you to overcome god
[1:00:17] has things to prove you to test you so
[1:00:19] you can make your choice
[1:00:20] he has things that he will put you
[1:00:21] through so that he can heap condemnation
[1:00:23] on the devil
[1:00:25] he will allow things in your life to
[1:00:27] condemn the devil amen but that doesn't
[1:00:29] mean we ever back down on the word amen
[1:00:31] god is sovereign he can do with this
[1:00:33] flesh what he wants
[1:00:34] but i will keep exercising my rights as
[1:00:36] a redeemed son of god
[1:00:37] i will keep saying what the word says
[1:00:41] because i have spiritual dominion
[1:00:46] adam had physical dominion as a as a he
[1:00:50] wasn't a redeemed son of god he was a
[1:00:51] full son of god
[1:00:54] and as a full son of god he had physical
[1:00:56] redemption he had physical dominion
[1:00:58] he was told to have dominion over the
[1:01:01] earth
[1:01:02] but as a fully redeemed son of god
[1:01:06] we've been given dominion also in the
[1:01:09] spirit world
[1:01:11] hallelujah continue on same quote
[1:01:15] and he quote he reads romans 5 17
[1:01:19] for by one man's offense death reigned
[1:01:20] by one much more than
[1:01:22] which they which receive abundance of
[1:01:25] grace
[1:01:25] and of the gift of righteousness shall
[1:01:27] reign in
[1:01:28] life by one jesus christ

[1:01:47] shall reign
[1:01:48] in life by one jesus christ remember you
[1:01:50] are as righteous as god
[1:01:52] is righteous because you have the you've
[1:01:54] been made the very righteousness of god
[1:01:57] and if you are the righteousness of god
[1:02:00] then there's no reason you can't have
[1:02:02] what you asked for
[1:02:06] colossians 1 13 who hath delivered us
[1:02:08] from the power of darkness and has
[1:02:09] translated us
[1:02:11] into the kingdom brother branham and
[1:02:13] jack's reign the kingdom

[1:02:51] take you you have a right to curse that
[1:02:54] thing and throw it right back on the
[1:02:55] devil where it came from
[1:02:56] you do you are the sin is subject to you
[1:02:59] you are not subject to sin
[1:03:02] you have been given dominion over sin
[1:03:04] start exercising dominion
[1:03:06] by your verbal decree by taking the word
[1:03:09] and placing it on your lips and taking
[1:03:11] dominion over that sin
[1:03:14] you have dominion over sin over the
[1:03:16] world
[1:03:18] this world doesn't have to tantalize you
[1:03:20] it doesn't have to discourage you
[1:03:22] it doesn't have to trick you and trap
[1:03:23] you and deceive you and it doesn't the
[1:03:25] glare the glow and the glitter doesn't
[1:03:27] have to pull you off
[1:03:28] you have dominion over the world

[1:03:34] to dominate you
[1:03:37] amen the scripture says possess that we
[1:03:40] we ought to know how to possess our
[1:03:42] vessels
[1:03:44] you are to possess your vessel
[1:03:47] your vessel is not to possess you
[1:03:53] this tabernacle that you see is
[1:03:56] possessed
[1:03:58] it's possessed by a redeemed son of god
[1:04:01] and that redeemed son of god has been
[1:04:02] given dominion over this flesh
[1:04:04] and i will exercise my dominion and i
[1:04:07] will not
[1:04:08] let this flesh condemn me

[1:04:14] on him we'll just pull him right back
[1:04:17] amen you have dominion over sin the
[1:04:19] world the flesh
[1:04:21] and this is my favorite the devil
[1:04:25] the devil does not have dominion over
[1:04:27] you you
[1:04:28] as a redeemed son of god with a
[1:04:30] spiritual kingdom
[1:04:31] have dominion over the devil he must
[1:04:34] must must obey you
[1:04:37] [Applause]
[1:04:39] think about this when brother branham
[1:04:40] came they came to the prayer line amen
[1:04:42] he knew his position he knew his calling
[1:04:44] he knew the scriptures
[1:04:45] and when he was standing in line with
[1:04:47] the word and he had somebody believing
[1:04:49] in front of him
[1:04:50] he would say i adjure you in the name of
[1:04:52] jesus christ leave this person
[1:04:54] he didn't ask him pretty please he
[1:04:56] didn't say if you feel like it
[1:04:57] because he knew he was operating in a
[1:04:59] realm of dominion
[1:05:03] if you resist the devil he will
[1:05:06] flee hey that's the word he has no
[1:05:09] options
[1:05:11] resist him by the word we're having
[1:05:14] dominion over sin in the world
[1:05:16] and the flesh and the devil showing
[1:05:18] forth his praise and glory
[1:05:20] showing forth himself whoa
[1:05:24] let's understand what we're reading i'll
[1:05:27] back up right now we reign with christ
[1:05:29] having dominion over sin
[1:05:31] the world the flesh and the devil
[1:05:33] showing forth his praise and glory
[1:05:35] showing forth himself
[1:05:39] for it is christ in us
[1:05:43] willing and doing of his good pleasure
[1:05:46] that's the secret to this dominion
[1:05:48] it's the incarnation by the holy ghost
[1:05:51] of jesus christ
[1:05:52] in you both doing but doing the will and
[1:05:55] the dew of his good pleasure
[1:05:58] it's not you it's him yes indeed even
[1:06:01] now we are seated in heavenly places in
[1:06:03] christ jesus continuing on the same
[1:06:05] passage and made us priest yes priests
[1:06:08] unto him offering spiritual praise of
[1:06:11] sanctified lips
[1:06:12] friends you know there's nobody else on
[1:06:14] earth that can praise him
[1:06:17] he won't receive praise from
[1:06:19] unsanctified lips
[1:06:20] how are you going to be sanctified
[1:06:22] without the blood how are you going to
[1:06:23] have the blood without the word
[1:06:25] you are the only ones that can praise
[1:06:27] him
[1:06:28] and so you are a priesthood amen and
[1:06:31] you're offering
[1:06:32] spiritual praise of sanctified lips
[1:06:35] spending our lives is a sweet offering
[1:06:37] unto him
[1:06:37] worshiping him in spirit and in truth
[1:06:40] interceding
[1:06:41] and petitioning
[1:06:46] you're the only interceder that this
[1:06:48] world has
[1:06:50] the people you work with your family
[1:06:52] members there's no other place for
[1:06:53] intercession friends
[1:06:54] only through the priesthood after the
[1:06:57] order of melchizedek
[1:06:58] that's the only place that they'll find
[1:07:00] intercession to melchizedek
[1:07:01] is through the priesthood after the
[1:07:02] order of melchizedek
[1:07:04] we've been made kings and priests
[1:07:08] interceding and petitioning priests and
[1:07:09] kings unto our god
[1:07:11] no wonder the world does not appeal to
[1:07:13] us
[1:07:14] that's my favorite line in this whole
[1:07:16] quote no wonder when you see your
[1:07:18] position and what right you have in
[1:07:20] dominion you begin
[1:07:21] why would the world have any attraction
[1:07:24] to us anymore why would it have any pull
[1:07:26] on us anymore this is who we
[1:07:28] are no wonder the world does not appeal
[1:07:32] to us
[1:07:32] we are a peculiar people zealous unto
[1:07:35] good works we have been
[1:07:36] recreated in him to be children like
[1:07:39] unto our
[1:07:40] father you're ordained
[1:07:44] to be kings and priests you have
[1:07:47] dominion
[1:07:48] amen dominion over sin dominion over the
[1:07:51] world
[1:07:51] dominion over the flesh and dominion
[1:07:53] over the devil right
[1:07:55] now you're gonna have to say it until
[1:07:59] you believe it
[1:08:00] you're gonna have to act on it till
[1:08:02] everything in your heart believes it
[1:08:03] take the word act on it believe it take
[1:08:06] your place and don't give any more
[1:08:07] ground to the devil
[1:08:10] brother branham tells a story
[1:08:15] and working on the holy spirit he says
[1:08:18] maybe you
[1:08:19] he's talking about this slave the slave
[1:08:21] trader goes
[1:08:22] to a plantation he sees a slave that's
[1:08:24] unlike all the other slaves he's a
[1:08:25] standout
[1:08:26] he's perfect in every way and he's
[1:08:28] starting to question the slave owner he
[1:08:29] says maybe you feed him better than you
[1:08:31] do the rest of them
[1:08:32] said no they all eat out of there in the
[1:08:34] galley together he said i don't feed him
[1:08:36] any different he's no boss he's just
[1:08:37] simply a slave
[1:08:39] so what makes him act different than the
[1:08:41] rest of them he said i didn't know
[1:08:43] that for a while but said you know one
[1:08:46] day i found out that his father is a
[1:08:47] king of the tribe
[1:08:50] and yet though he's an alien and away
[1:08:52] from home he keeps the morale of the
[1:08:54] rest of them up for he knows
[1:08:55] that he's a king's son
[1:09:00] i thought oh god though we be alienated
[1:09:03] here in a dark world amongst unbelief
[1:09:05] and skeptics and infidels and scoffers
[1:09:07] and laughters
[1:09:08] brother stick out your chest we're sons
[1:09:10] and daughters of the king
[1:09:11] let's act like men and women of the
[1:09:13] kingdom of god though we're an alien
[1:09:15] let's act like sons and daughters of god
[1:09:18] here you have a slave amen they never
[1:09:20] had to beat him into subjection they
[1:09:22] never had to encourage him in any way
[1:09:24] because he knew that he was the son of a
[1:09:26] king and no matter where he was on this
[1:09:28] earth and no matter how anybody treated
[1:09:30] him he was going to act like a king's
[1:09:32] son
[1:09:34] who in the world can move you away from
[1:09:37] that revelation
[1:09:38] it doesn't matter if your best friend
[1:09:39] treats you horrible it doesn't matter if
[1:09:41] somebody in the church treats you
[1:09:43] terrible
[1:09:43] what will cause you to stop acting like
[1:09:45] a son or daughter of god
[1:09:47] when you catch a revelation of who you
[1:09:48] are and where you're from
[1:09:50] it doesn't matter if they beat him with
[1:09:52] whips if they stole him from his
[1:09:53] homeland
[1:09:54] drove him far away subjected him to
[1:09:56] labor
[1:09:57] he still conducted himself like a king's
[1:09:59] son
[1:10:01] what is the devil going to do to you to
[1:10:03] stop you from acting like a king's son
[1:10:05] is he going to beat you and put you in
[1:10:06] subjection amen cause financial trouble
[1:10:09] cause family trouble
[1:10:10] cause sickness will you ever stop acting
[1:10:12] like a king's son
[1:10:14] no we've been given dominion
[1:10:18] we we're different than this slave this
[1:10:20] slave came
[1:10:21] came to a foreign land knowing he was a
[1:10:23] king son
[1:10:25] we came to a foreign land and we had no
[1:10:27] idea
[1:10:28] so we walked around beat down and beat
[1:10:30] up and discouraged and
[1:10:32] stepped on and falling in sin and no way
[1:10:35] to overcome and
[1:10:36] couldn't couldn't defeat the devil no
[1:10:38] matter how hard we try
[1:10:40] who remembers that condition no matter
[1:10:42] how hard you try you couldn't stop the
[1:10:44] addictions
[1:10:45] i mean you you couldn't stop the bad
[1:10:47] habits you couldn't stop the language
[1:10:48] you couldn't stop all these things
[1:10:50] no matter how hard you tried because you
[1:10:52] were in bondage but you had no idea who
[1:10:54] you were
[1:10:55] but then the eagle flew over and
[1:10:58] screamed
[1:10:59] and you realize whatever that is is what
[1:11:02] i am amen
[1:11:03] and you took to the skies and now the
[1:11:05] condition that you're in
[1:11:06] doesn't matter anymore because something
[1:11:08] on the inside's been awakened
[1:11:10] that you know that i'm a son i'm a
[1:11:13] daughter of the king of kings
[1:11:16] and though far from home i will conduct
[1:11:19] myself
[1:11:20] as a child of the king
[1:11:24] jesus was tempted by the devil
[1:11:27] took him into a wilderness place and
[1:11:29] tempted him
[1:11:30] and said took him up to a high
[1:11:33] high mountain he said showed him all the
[1:11:35] kingdoms of the world
[1:11:37] said if you'll bow down and worship me
[1:11:39] i'll give all this to you
[1:11:41] brother baby said he knew it was going
[1:11:43] to be his anyways
[1:11:46] see though he was far from home
[1:11:50] and though he was subjected into a
[1:11:53] condition you know
[1:11:54] jesus subjected himself to his earthly
[1:11:56] parents
[1:11:58] at the age of 12 he submitted himself
[1:12:00] unto them and went along with them
[1:12:01] letting them call the shots letting them
[1:12:03] make the rules
[1:12:05] he was subjected to this world amen he
[1:12:08] was subjected to the governments amen
[1:12:10] when they had to pay taxes he paid taxes
[1:12:14] but because he got dominion he knew
[1:12:16] where to get the money
[1:12:19] he lived in this world he was subject to
[1:12:22] this world but he still had dominion as
[1:12:23] the son of god he never
[1:12:25] lost his identification as a son of god
[1:12:28] no matter what they put him through no
[1:12:29] matter what they subjected him to
[1:12:31] he never lost his identification
[1:12:35] and satan trying to tempt him and he
[1:12:37] said i'll give you all of these
[1:12:39] and jesus knew it was going to be his
[1:12:41] anyways
[1:12:42] with no strings attached
[1:12:46] whatever the devil's tempting you with
[1:12:48] this whole world is going to be yours
[1:12:52] with no strings attached
[1:12:55] listen young people you have ambition
[1:12:58] you have desires want a home want a car
[1:12:59] want all this
[1:13:00] don't let the devil distract you by all
[1:13:02] those things
[1:13:04] because you're a joint heir with jesus
[1:13:06] christ
[1:13:08] you know what joint air means whatever
[1:13:10] he inherits you inherits
[1:13:12] you're joined to him in whatever he
[1:13:14] inherits you inherit and he's going to
[1:13:16] inherit the whole
[1:13:17] world that's your inheritance
[1:13:20] don't forget who you are
[1:13:23] one time jesus just knowing his
[1:13:25] identification
[1:13:27] he stands before an earthly governor
[1:13:29] named pilate
[1:13:30] not even caesar here you have the
[1:13:33] creator of the heavens and earth
[1:13:35] and a body he the king of kings the lord
[1:13:38] of lords
[1:13:38] the almighty god is standing here in an
[1:13:41] earthly form
[1:13:42] and a little puny governor
[1:13:45] is telling him don't you know i have
[1:13:48] power
[1:13:50] don't you know i have power to take your
[1:13:52] life don't you know i have power to give
[1:13:54] you life
[1:13:54] and jesus looked at him and he says you
[1:13:57] have no power
[1:13:58] other than what's been given you from
[1:13:59] above
[1:14:01] you see he was far from home when he was
[1:14:04] in this condition
[1:14:05] but he never forgot who he was
[1:14:08] don't let any government frighten you
[1:14:10] don't let anybody
[1:14:12] frighten you nothing can happen to you
[1:14:14] unless it's given
[1:14:15] unless authorities given from my father
[1:14:17] in heaven amen you have to know who you
[1:14:19] are stand your ground and never lose
[1:14:21] your position
[1:14:22] there's no magistrate there's no king
[1:14:24] there's no president there's no
[1:14:25] government
[1:14:26] that can do a thing to you unless it's
[1:14:28] permitted from above
[1:14:29] because i'm here as a representation as
[1:14:31] a king from a spiritual kingdom
[1:14:33] and unless that spiritual kingdom says
[1:14:35] so you can't do
[1:14:37] anything remember we were
[1:14:41] at the missionary conference just a
[1:14:43] couple months ago
[1:14:45] but ron and i were there and brother
[1:14:46] craig was there and there was a brother
[1:14:48] from ireland he's a missionary from
[1:14:50] ireland
[1:14:50] and he was there talking about he got
[1:14:52] arrested he was overseas somewhere in a
