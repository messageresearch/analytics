[9:51] standing let's take our bibles and turn
[9:53] to genesis chapter one
[9:56] we're going to continue on with the same
[9:57] thought from last sunday but
[9:59] this isn't really a part two it's just a
[10:01] little bit different we're going to go a
[10:02] little further
[10:03] and i would like to pick it up in
[10:04] genesis chapter one
[10:06] again like we did last week and kind of
[10:08] touch back on our foundation and move
[10:10] forward there
[10:11] i also want to remind you that this
[10:13] evening will be the communion and feet
[10:15] washing
[10:16] so if you want to come back for that
[10:17] that'd be wonderful and also
[10:19] um this wednesday we will start our
[10:23] tape service so we'll be starting uh
[10:25] with it is the rising of the sun
[10:27] there are books out on iraq here beside
[10:29] the welcome desk out here plenty of
[10:31] books so everybody can have one
[10:33] it's the message from april 18th the
[10:35] morning service
[10:36] from 1965 so if you want to use your
[10:38] tablet or your phone or
[10:40] or have your own book we'll be doing
[10:42] that starting this wednesday
[10:44] we'll probably go for three wednesdays
[10:46] is my guess but we'll just see how it
[10:47] goes as we get into it
[10:49] let's go ahead and turn to this
[10:51] scripture here and look at
[10:52] genesis chapter 1 verse 26
[10:56] and god said let us make man in our
[10:58] image after our likeness
[11:00] and let them have dominion over the fish
[11:01] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[11:03] and over the cattle
[11:05] and over all the earth and over every
[11:07] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[11:09] earth
[11:10] so god created man in his own image and
[11:12] the image of god created
[11:14] he him male and female created he
[11:17] them let's turn over to chapter two
[11:20] and read one verse out of chapter two
[11:22] verse eighteen
[11:25] chapter two verse eighteen and the lord
[11:27] god said it is not good that man should
[11:29] be alone
[11:30] i will make him a help meet for him
[11:33] and that helped me really just means a
[11:35] helper
[11:37] genesis chapter 5 let's
[11:40] read genesis chapter 5 and verse 1.
[11:45] this is the book of the generations of
[11:47] adam and the day that god created man
[11:50] and the likeness of god made he him male
[11:52] and female created he them
[11:54] and blessed them and called their name
[11:56] adam
[11:57] in the day when they were created amen
[12:00] let's bow our heads and ask the lord's
[12:02] blessing
[12:03] lord jesus we thank you that we can be
[12:05] here
[12:06] and father we ask as we look to this
[12:08] word now lord that you would open it to
[12:10] us lord
[12:11] that you would open our eyes to see that
[12:12] you would rub the eye salve in our eyes
[12:14] that we might see this word
[12:16] and god we can be changed by it may we
[12:18] look into the mirror of the word and be
[12:20] changed into the likeness of what we see
[12:22] lord and god i pray that you would feed
[12:24] us now by your own hand
[12:26] speak to us lord the words of life god i
[12:29] pray you granted according to your
[12:30] preeminence
[12:31] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[12:34] you can all be seated then for a title
[12:38] i'm
[12:39] i'm going to go a little bit different
[12:40] direction but i'd like to speak on
[12:42] a submissive queen with a humble heart
[12:45] and as we get into this i'm going to
[12:47] eventually get into esther
[12:49] and talk about that and there's just
[12:50] some things that really
[12:52] as i was meditating just it was a
[12:54] refreshing
[12:55] we preached on esther quite a bit we
[12:57] went into it for a little while a couple
[12:59] years ago
[13:00] but some of those things just came
[13:02] flooding back as we got into the subject
[13:04] and began to look at it
[13:05] but i want to i want to start with a
[13:07] quote here this is we read this last
[13:09] week
[13:09] this is part of our foundation still and
[13:12] out of questions and
[13:13] answers on genesis from 1953 the prophet
[13:16] of god said and then god taken from his
[13:18] side a piece of him a rib
[13:20] and made a woman now where did he get
[13:22] the spirit woman
[13:23] see genesis 1 26 he said let us make man
[13:26] in our image after our own likeness
[13:28] created he them male and female he made
[13:31] the burly spirit for the man he made the
[13:33] tender little delicate feminist spirit
[13:35] for the woman
[13:36] and when you see a woman acting like a
[13:38] man she's got out of her place
[13:40] in the beginning see all right i think
[13:42] it's a shame that women has lost their
[13:44] dainty feminist place
[13:46] it's a disgrace and then he says in the
[13:48] message he must be born again from 1958
[13:51] he says therefore
[13:52] when a man tries to act like excuse me
[13:54] when a woman tries to act like a man
[13:57] dress like a man talk like a man she's
[13:59] out of her place
[14:00] a woman is feminist sweet loving not big
[14:03] and carrying on and acting like a man
[14:06] well she's not supposed to be and when
[14:08] she does that her life is perverted
[14:10] she's sweet loving kind where adam is
[14:13] more the burly type
[14:14] for he was the man the masculine type
[14:16] the woman was feminist
[14:18] but it's the same spirit for he took her
[14:20] from adam
[14:22] so this is the part that we talked about
[14:24] last time but i just want to refresh
[14:25] your memory
[14:26] that the spirit that was in the woman
[14:29] was not
[14:30] different than adam it was adam
[14:34] but when god that spirit that was in the
[14:37] woman was originally an adam and both
[14:39] masculine and feminist was in him
[14:41] amen and god had created him a son of
[14:44] god
[14:44] and within him was the help meet within
[14:47] him was the
[14:48] female spirit within him he was a
[14:50] complete unit but god said it is not
[14:52] good that he should dwell alone
[14:54] so this is all god's master plan in
[14:56] creating his masterpiece he said it's
[14:58] not good
[14:59] she should dwell alone so he pulled out
[15:01] of adam
[15:02] the feminist spirit and he took a rib
[15:04] from adam and he formed another vessel
[15:07] and he put that spirit in adam
[15:09] and now the only thing you can call that
[15:11] spirit is
[15:12] adam it is adam it is
[15:15] it is another expression of adam it is
[15:18] atom is
[15:19] part a part of adam what was originally
[15:21] an atom
[15:22] has been pulled out for another
[15:24] expression and that expression is called
[15:26] woman
[15:27] and that woman is given a name and that
[15:30] name is adam
[15:32] praise god but when brother brown
[15:35] describes it here
[15:36] he says the one that remained in adam
[15:39] was the burly was the masculine
[15:41] amen and that's and when god you know uh
[15:44] we'll say it this way god's the one who
[15:46] did the splitting
[15:48] when he split the spirit he split it the
[15:51] way he wanted it amen
[15:52] and when he wanted in one expression the
[15:54] burly the masculine
[15:56] and another expression he wanted the
[15:58] sweet the feminine the gentle
[16:01] and that's what god wanted amen and so
[16:03] the reason that this is so important to
[16:05] us is because the world we live in is so
[16:07] utterly
[16:08] perverted it is called good evil and
[16:10] evil good
[16:11] and is changing god's original plan and
[16:14] in changing god's original plan
[16:16] it always brings death it'll never bring
[16:19] life
[16:20] to change from god's original will bring
[16:22] death
[16:24] not life and when god made a woman he
[16:27] made her the way he wanted her
[16:30] amen because god was expressing
[16:33] something that was in his mind from
[16:35] before the foundational world something
[16:37] he wanted to express
[16:38] something he wanted to achieve something
[16:40] he wanted to have upon the earth
[16:42] and he was expressing it here in his
[16:44] first masterpiece
[16:45] and that masterpiece fell to ruin and we
[16:48] know how the masterpiece came into
[16:50] ruin it's it's because the the the devil
[16:53] now
[16:54] began to work through the serpent and
[16:56] the serpent began to seduce the woman
[16:58] and the woman when she acted
[17:00] independently of the male
[17:02] amen should begin to fall
[17:05] amen this is so important because it
[17:08] relates to us
[17:10] you know we were talked about last time
[17:12] a dominating female spirit and we said
[17:14] you can have a dominating female spirit
[17:16] and be a man
[17:18] because it's it's a approach it's an
[17:21] attitude amen it's the way
[17:23] uh it's the way you view things and the
[17:25] way you approach things
[17:26] amen there's a dominating female spirit
[17:28] because that dominating female spirit
[17:30] has been upon the churches
[17:31] for years and the churches traditionally
[17:34] have been run by men
[17:36] the men were the priests and the popes
[17:37] and the priests and the bishops and the
[17:39] overseers
[17:40] amen they were all run by men but yet
[17:42] the spirit on that church was a
[17:44] dominating female spirit a jezebel
[17:45] spirit
[17:47] so you can come under this dominating
[17:50] female spirit because
[17:51] the female was pulled out amen and she
[17:54] was supposed to be a helper
[17:55] to the man a minute when she came out to
[17:57] be a helper now
[17:59] she was no longer working in conjunction
[18:01] with the man when she began to work
[18:02] independent of the male
[18:04] amen she was beguiled she was deceived
[18:07] she moved off to her reasoning and
[18:09] thereby she fell
[18:10] amen and adam amen who has not beguiled
[18:13] was not
[18:14] deceived he was not deceived into
[18:15] transgression but he knew
[18:17] full well what was going on but he chose
[18:19] to leave
[18:20] amen the commandment of god to go and
[18:22] redeem and save his wife
[18:24] and he's foreshadowing what christ will
[18:26] do for us
[18:28] only christ never has to leave the word
[18:29] to redeem us
[18:32] so this is the what we talked about last
[18:34] time and we want to
[18:36] move on from there and what's so
[18:38] critical is because in the expression
[18:40] that you and i
[18:41] are in this day god has chosen to
[18:44] express
[18:44] himself in bright form and so it's
[18:48] feminine form it's female form and when
[18:51] we have to understand
[18:52] what god did and why god did it it helps
[18:55] us understand
[18:56] what is our role what are we supposed to
[18:58] be doing what's the objective today
[19:00] amen it's jesus christ it is jesus
[19:02] christ just like it was adam in the
[19:04] beginning
[19:05] but it's jesus christ now in the
[19:06] formation of his bride
[19:08] he was here in formation of bridegroom
[19:11] he was here the last adam amen to
[19:13] restore all that adam lost
[19:15] he was he proved that he was the
[19:17] faithful son
[19:18] amen and every other son before had
[19:21] failed to be a perfectly faithful son
[19:24] adam failed noah failed moses failed
[19:27] david failed amen they all failed to be
[19:30] a perfectly faithful son
[19:32] and they were all typing or shadowing
[19:35] jesus christ but when he came he came
[19:37] the last adam
[19:38] why does it say last adam
[19:41] it's a interesting terminology last adam
[19:44] amen because moses was going to portray
[19:47] adam but he failed so he couldn't
[19:48] restore
[19:49] noah all of these were trying to portray
[19:52] the faithful son
[19:53] amen but they all fell but there was one
[19:56] that would come
[19:57] that would not fall amen and it was god
[20:00] himself in the form of his son jesus
[20:02] christ
[20:02] and he could not fail he could not fall
[20:05] amen
[20:06] and he he lived the faithful son
[20:13] and it's amazing i'm repeating a lot
[20:16] from last week but i want this to stay
[20:17] fresh in our minds
[20:19] it's amazing to me he was emmanuel
[20:24] he was the fullness of the godhead
[20:25] bodily
[20:27] he said that my father and i are one
[20:32] but yet he would say the son doeth
[20:34] nothing
[20:35] but what do you see the father doeth and
[20:38] jesus says
[20:39] i can do nothing
[20:42] it's not he says it's not me it's the
[20:45] father in me that do it the works
[20:48] see he was emmanuel
[20:52] god made flesh but yet in his expression
[20:55] he was expressing son
[20:58] and the expression of son he had to be
[21:01] faithful
[21:02] and obedient and submissive amen in
[21:04] order
[21:05] to in order to reverse all that adam had
[21:08] lost
[21:08] he had to come to perfect faithfulness
[21:10] perfect submission
[21:11] perfect obedience to be the perfect son
[21:15] and so there had to be a relationship
[21:17] between father and son
[21:18] that would express son and
[21:22] in the in the portion of the message in
[21:25] the church age book where
[21:26] brother ben writes what he was told to
[21:28] write when he was told to pick up his
[21:29] pen and write
[21:30] the angel lord told him to pick up his
[21:32] pen and he began to write he said look
[21:34] at the relationship between jesus christ
[21:36] and the father the son and the father
[21:38] and he says that relationship is now to
[21:40] exist between the bride and groom
[21:43] so jesus amen although the father was in
[21:47] him
[21:47] he could not take the role of the father
[21:49] he had to play the role of the son
[21:51] and the bride now although the
[21:53] bridegroom is in her she cannot be the
[21:55] bridegroom she must be the bride
[21:59] when she tries to be the bridegroom she
[22:01] gets out of her place she takes the
[22:03] wrong spirit
[22:04] and she's going to bring failure and
[22:05] ruin to the plan of gone and to herself
[22:07] because she's here to express
[22:09] bride not bridegroom but the
[22:11] bridegroom's with her the bridegroom's
[22:13] in her
[22:14] just like it was emmanuel god was in
[22:17] jesus christ
[22:18] reconciling the world to himself but yet
[22:20] he had to be the faithful son
[22:23] he could not be the father he had to be
[22:25] the son
[22:27] and now the bride although it is the
[22:29] expression of the bridegroom all it is
[22:31] mrs jesus christ
[22:33] although it is the same spirit i mean
[22:35] it's life of his life
[22:36] bone of his bone spirit of his spirit
[22:38] she's here to express
[22:40] bride and if she fails that's where
[22:43] every church before us has failed
[22:47] the first church every church age has
[22:49] failed
[22:50] they failed to stay in the channel god
[22:52] put them
[22:53] in amen they wanted to become dominant
[22:56] they wanted to make their own way
[22:57] they wanted to make their own decisions
[22:59] amen and they left the headship
[23:01] of the word and began to take reasoning
[23:04] and began to
[23:04] take their own ideas and creeds and
[23:06] dogmas and wanted to make their own
[23:08] decisions
[23:09] and as soon as they did that church fell
[23:12] amen it would go into ruin and he would
[23:13] start with another one
[23:16] but there's a prophecy today that this
[23:20] bride won't fail
[23:22] she's predestinated not to how will she
[23:25] not fail
[23:26] it's not going to be by her brightness
[23:28] it's not going to be by her intellect
[23:30] it's not going to be because they've
[23:32] gathered together the best minds or the
[23:34] best of this or the best of that
[23:37] but she's not going to fail because
[23:38] god's put in her the right spirit
[23:42] and she will remain submissive
[23:46] to her head which is christ the word
[23:51] that's why i titled this the submissive
[23:54] queen
[23:56] because it's interesting when you start
[23:57] talking about queen and we're going to
[23:59] look at queen in the bible
[24:00] amen there's a there's an initial
[24:03] expression of
[24:04] exaltation the queen she's exalted above
[24:07] all the other women she's
[24:09] she's placed uh sharing the throne with
[24:11] her husband and all these other
[24:13] imageries and terminologies and thoughts
[24:15] we have about the queen
[24:17] but don't ever forget that the queen
[24:19] worships the king
[24:22] don't ever forget that the queen bows
[24:25] before the king
[24:27] that the queen prostrates herself before
[24:29] the king that the queen humbles herself
[24:31] before the king
[24:32] it doesn't matter how exalted queen is
[24:34] queen has never exalted over king
[24:38] still there's still a difference
[24:41] still a big difference this is where we
[24:44] have to remain
[24:46] because if the devil can't get you off
[24:47] on one side of the road he'll get you
[24:49] off from the other
[24:51] if he can't get you amen to to be a
[24:54] heathen
[24:55] he'll get you over in fanaticism and
[24:56] make you go too far
[24:59] it's true there's truth there the queen
[25:02] and the bride
[25:03] but he can get you to go too far
[25:06] to where you can become like the first
[25:08] church like the catholic church and said
[25:09] i said a queen
[25:11] and am no widow and shall need see no
[25:13] sorrow
[25:15] you don't even know that destruction is
[25:17] coming
[25:18] because you left the word how did she
[25:21] get there friends
[25:23] slowly by degrees
[25:26] by wrong attitudes and wrong thoughts
[25:28] and self-exaltation
[25:30] she didn't she didn't just arrive there
[25:33] she grew into that kind of notion where
[25:35] she could be
[25:37] naked miserable wretched blind
[25:40] and know it not
[25:44] what did she do somewhere along the line
[25:47] she left the headship of the word
[25:49] and when she left the headship of the
[25:51] word she began to make her
[25:53] own decisions and find her own way
[25:56] but still believed she was the bride of
[25:58] jesus christ
[26:01] still believed that she was the queen of
[26:03] heaven
[26:05] still believed that she was blessed and
[26:08] honored
[26:09] and exalted and didn't even know it that
[26:12] she was already rejected
[26:16] hallelujah sober isn't it
[26:20] i say god make me submissive make me
[26:23] humble
[26:24] lord let me lower myself and bow before
[26:26] you
[26:27] you are my god you are my king you are
[26:29] my husband you are the revealed word
[26:31] that has been given this hour to us and
[26:33] we subject ourselves to that
[26:37] in the thyatiran church age we read this
[26:39] also last sunday
[26:40] from the church age book i'm just going
[26:42] to read a few excerpts i'm not going to
[26:43] read the whole passage like i did last
[26:45] time
[26:46] but it said it is most worthy of note
[26:48] that the very name thyatira means
[26:49] dominating female thus this age is
[26:52] characterized by a dominant force a
[26:54] force that ruthlessly invades all
[26:57] conquers all despotically controls now a
[27:00] dominating female is the greatest
[27:02] curse in the world oh
[27:05] praise be to god you ought to be able to
[27:07] say amen to that
[27:09] amen it's what caused all of our
[27:11] problems amen
[27:14] further down says from the garden of
[27:15] eden onward women has
[27:17] constantly and successfully tried to
[27:19] take control over the man
[27:22] further down he says now a woman is not
[27:24] meant to have an iron disposition
[27:26] she is according to the holy scripture
[27:28] to be submissive to the male
[27:30] that is commanded of her women a woman
[27:33] who is truly female
[27:34] all female will be of that disposition
[27:37] not a doormat
[27:38] no real male makes a wife a doorman but
[27:41] she will
[27:42] but she will want to be under authority
[27:44] and not rule over the mail
[27:46] for he is the head of the house if she
[27:48] breaks that
[27:49] image that god made for her she is
[27:51] perverted and
[27:53] any male that lets the woman take
[27:54] authority has also broken that image
[27:57] and is perverted that is why a woman
[27:59] cannot wear that which pertaineth to a
[28:01] man or cut her hair
[28:03] she is never to wear garments that
[28:04] pertain to a male or cut her hair
[28:06] when she does she is intruding into the
[28:08] male domain
[28:09] taking authority and perverting herself
[28:12] and when a woman invades the pulpit
[28:14] which is commanded she must not do
[28:16] she shows that this she shows what
[28:18] spirit she's of
[28:20] being a dominating female is antichrist
[28:22] and the seeds of the roman catholic
[28:24] church is in her
[28:25] though she may deny this ever so
[28:27] vehemently
[28:28] but when it comes to the word let god be
[28:31] true in
[28:31] every man's word a lie
[28:35] further down in the same passage he says
[28:37] and that weakness in her
[28:39] allowed satan to seduce her by way of
[28:42] the serpent and has brought the woman
[28:44] to a very peculiar position before god
[28:47] in his word
[28:48] she is the type of all things vulgar
[28:50] foul and lowsome on the one hand
[28:52] and on the other hand she is the type of
[28:54] all things clean and beautiful and holy
[28:56] as a receptacle of the spirit and
[28:58] blessings of god
[29:00] on one hand she is called the who
[29:01] is drunk with the wine of her
[29:03] fornications
[29:04] on the other she is called the bride of
[29:05] christ on one hand she is called mystery
[29:08] babylon the abomination before god
[29:10] and on the other hand she is called new
[29:12] jerusalem our mother
[29:14] on the one hand she is so foul and
[29:16] wicked and lewd that she is
[29:18] similarly cast into the lake of fire as
[29:21] the only fit place for her
[29:23] and on the other hand she is exalted to
[29:24] heaven sharing the very throne of god
[29:27] as the only place befitting such a queen
[29:30] and in this thyatiran church age she is
[29:32] a dominating female she is mystery
[29:34] babylon she is the great
[29:36] she is jezebel the false prophetess why
[29:39] because the true female is submissive to
[29:42] god
[29:43] that's key why is she all this because
[29:46] the true female is submissive to god
[29:50] christ is her head she has no word but
[29:53] his no
[29:53] thoughts but his no leadership but his
[29:57] amen and i say lord that's the the kind
[30:00] of bride that i want to be
[30:02] amen and no matter how much we want it
[30:04] we always find self coming to the
[30:06] surface and
[30:07] all of these things in our carnality but
[30:09] what we desire more than anything is to
[30:11] be
[30:11] this submissive woman amen to be the
[30:14] perfect reflection
[30:15] of jesus christ reflecting back to him
[30:18] his own self in the image of female
[30:21] remember i said before when god
[30:24] separated out the woman
[30:25] he did not make a clone of the man
[30:27] although it was the same dna
[30:29] although it was the same spirit amen he
[30:32] did not make a clone he made a
[30:34] complimentary piece
[30:36] because if you made a clone you would
[30:38] see in anatomy and in makeup and
[30:40] physique and also in spirit you would
[30:42] see another male
[30:43] but that's not the masterpiece god was
[30:46] making the masterpiece god was making
[30:48] was to separate the female out of the
[30:49] male
[30:50] and bring a separate expression of
[30:52] female amen so when he made
[30:54] the same thing he made the same thing
[30:57] only with a different expression to be
[30:59] complementary
[31:00] and the two together make the
[31:02] masterpiece
[31:05] you can't have a masterpiece with one
[31:06] without the other it's an incomplete
[31:08] masterpiece amen until the bride comes
[31:11] out and is restored back to the
[31:13] bridegroom
[31:13] then the masterpiece is complete again
[31:16] amen and the bride cannot operate
[31:18] independent of her head ever ever
[31:21] ever she does she's moving into
[31:25] dangerous ground
[31:28] so when god wanted this expression he
[31:31] made it the way he wanted it
[31:32] and now god to restore his masterpiece
[31:35] has restored the bridegroom has restored
[31:38] the male
[31:38] in jesus christ in his earthly ministry
[31:41] he was the restoration of the faithful
[31:43] son
[31:43] he was the last adam there's no need for
[31:46] another one to try
[31:48] we've had the last adam now the
[31:51] bridegroom has come forth been expressed
[31:53] fulfilled his role
[31:54] done all that he was supposed to do and
[31:55] redeemed back all that the first one had
[31:57] lost
[31:59] but now he has to have a female
[32:03] to complete the masterpiece so god
[32:05] struck him in the side
[32:07] and he pulled out from under his rib
[32:09] water and blood and he began
[32:10] by the word and the spirit to make
[32:12] another amen what is he doing he's
[32:14] completing the masterpiece he's
[32:16] rebuilding what had fallen
[32:17] and he's making a another bride another
[32:20] wife another woman amen and what's he
[32:22] doing he's taking
[32:24] not a different spirit but the same
[32:26] spirit amen
[32:27] the spirit that was in jesus christ is
[32:29] now coming into the bride to be what
[32:31] amen
[32:32] life of his life bone of his bone flesh
[32:34] of his flesh
[32:35] but not a clone a complementary peace
[32:42] amen sometimes when when we hear what
[32:45] brother bannon's telling us
[32:46] it's there's a truth there's a truth
[32:48] it's jesus christ in the formation of a
[32:50] bride
[32:50] it's in every way the wheat restored
[32:52] again the wheat grain it's christ coming
[32:54] back it's the word come
[32:56] back amen but we realize it's got to
[32:58] match the picture of the first
[32:59] masterpiece
[33:00] it's not a clone we're not here to be
[33:03] the last adam
[33:04] that's fulfilled amen we are here to be
[33:06] the last woman
[33:11] the complementary piece that complements
[33:14] the bridegroom the bride
[33:15] and the bridegroom together make the
[33:17] masterpiece
[33:20] amen so sometimes we take these terms
[33:23] that brother broom gives
[33:24] we take them upon ourselves amen but we
[33:26] want
[33:27] and without meaning to we want to
[33:29] reflect the bridegroom
[33:30] and we're supposed to reflect the bride
[33:33] humble submissive reverent
[33:37] giving honor to her husband
[33:42] brother mam says in the message
[33:43] influence he said now notice secondly
[33:46] the two wings that cover their feet
[33:48] what did they mean humility before god
[33:50] in his presence
[33:52] these are the very these are the very uh
[33:56] cherubims that are in the heavens that
[33:57] are worshiping god brother of them said
[33:59] never sin never done wrong
[34:00] but with two wings they cover their feet
[34:03] humility two cup
[34:04] two wings they cover their faith in
[34:06] reverence and with two
[34:08] they fly they're in action amen and
[34:10] they've never done anything wrong but
[34:11] god is so
[34:12] holy that they have to reverence and
[34:14] humble
[34:15] him these beings have never sinned
[34:17] they've never done wrong
[34:18] but in the presence of god he is so holy
[34:20] they must reverence him
[34:22] and humble themselves before him
[34:25] and this is important because we we gave
[34:27] this a title
[34:28] amen the submissive queen with a humble
[34:31] heart
[34:32] because these things go together to have
[34:34] the right kind of expression
[34:37] he goes on to say that moses at the
[34:39] burning bush took off his shoes when he
[34:40] heard him say i am that i am
[34:43] paul on his road to damascus he fell on
[34:44] his face john when he saw the spirit of
[34:47] god above jesus he said i have need to
[34:48] be baptized of thee and why cometh thou
[34:50] to me
[34:51] here is a good example always be
[34:53] conscious of your littleness
[34:55] not your bigness
[34:58] praise god
[35:02] amen
[35:05] see if we don't understand the the way
[35:08] god is trying to express
[35:09] himself that through his attributes he
[35:13] wants a full expression of
[35:14] all that's in his attributes and
[35:18] and he wants the attributes to express
[35:20] the proper portion in the proper season
[35:22] because that's the proper display of who
[35:24] god is
[35:26] and and we we have a reality
[35:30] that it's not us it's god in us
[35:33] amen that if we ever were part of god
[35:37] we're always part of god and it's an
[35:39] attribute of god a portion of god
[35:41] part of god's life that he attributed to
[35:43] us so it is god
[35:45] it is god but we cannot act like god
[35:53] and if i say that i don't want to say
[35:55] that wrong but we cannot be the father
[36:01] that's where we came from is that who we
[36:04] are
[36:04] yes there's a portion of that in me what
[36:07] is in you
[36:08] god is that true yes
[36:11] but there's a certain attribute of god
[36:13] that he wants to spray
[36:14] and that attribute he wants me to splay
[36:17] he's not asking me to display
[36:18] father he's not asking me to display the
[36:21] the faithful son
[36:22] he's asking me to display the faithful
[36:24] wife
[36:26] and that's the expression of god he
[36:27] wants in this day and that expression of
[36:30] god
[36:31] just like when emmanuel came forth in
[36:33] the sign
[36:34] the son reverenced respected humbled and
[36:37] submitted himself to the expression of
[36:39] the father
[36:41] and if we had done any less he would
[36:42] have been wrong
[36:45] but now in the expression of the female
[36:47] and the expression of the bride
[36:49] and the expression of the female
[36:50] expression of jesus christ
[36:52] now in order to properly express god is
[36:55] not to take on another expression
[36:57] amen but to express the portion that
[36:59] he's allotted to be expressed in this
[37:01] day
[37:01] in this age and in you is it god yes
[37:03] it's god is it jesus christ yes it's
[37:05] jesus christ but if you express
[37:07] anything other than the expression he
[37:08] wants today you're going to be
[37:10] out of line with god's will
[37:14] so we have to stay in the channel amen
[37:16] stay in the channel
[37:20] of god's word in god's way
[37:23] always be conscious of your littleness
[37:25] not your bigness
[37:28] let's turn to proverbs 18 together
[37:31] there's several
[37:32] scriptures i want to read here together
[37:34] but we'll begin with proverbs
[37:37] the 18th chapter
[37:50] proverbs 18 and 12
[37:57] before destruction the heart of man is
[37:59] haughty
[38:00] and before honor is humility
[38:04] this is a principle that will always
[38:05] remain true
[38:07] it will never change before
[38:12] uh sorry let me read this again before
[38:15] destruction the heart of man is
[38:16] haughty look at the revelations 18 when
[38:20] you see the false church the great
[38:23] she says i am a queen and am no widow
[38:26] and shall see no sorrow see she was
[38:29] coming to her destruction because in
[38:30] chapter 18 she sees her destruction
[38:33] right when she comes her destruction she
[38:34] expresses a holy spirit
[38:36] and before destruction is
[38:40] a man is haughty but before honor is
[38:43] humility
[38:43] just before honor comes there has to be
[38:46] humility
[38:47] haughtiness is pre as a prelude to
[38:50] destruction
[38:51] humility is a prelude to exaltation
[38:56] that principle will always remain true
[38:59] let's go to luke 14
[39:01] and see how jesus says this
[39:05] luke chapter 14.
[39:18] luke chapter 14 and verse 7.
[39:29] yeah luke 14 7.
[39:32] and he put forth a parable to those who
[39:34] were bidden when he marked how they
[39:37] chose out the chief room saying unto
[39:39] them when thou art bitten of any man to
[39:41] a wedding
[39:42] sit not down in the highest room lest a
[39:44] more honorable man than thou
[39:46] be bidden of him and he that bade thee
[39:49] in
[39:49] and he that obeyed thee in him come and
[39:52] say to thee
[39:53] give this man place and now begin with
[39:55] shame to take the lowest room
[39:57] but when thou art bidden go and sit down
[39:59] in the lowest room
[40:01] that when he he that bade thee cometh he
[40:04] may say unto thee friend go up higher
[40:06] then shalt thou have worship in the
[40:08] presence of them that sit at the meat
[40:09] with thee
[40:10] for whosoever exalteth himself shall be
[40:13] abased
[40:13] and he that humbleth self shall be
[40:15] exalted
[40:17] let's turn over to luke 18.
[40:24] luke 18 and verse 9.
[40:31] in luke 18 and verse 9 jesus he's going
[40:34] to begin to say another parable in verse
[40:36] 9 he says and
[40:37] he spake this parable into certain which
[40:38] trusted in themselves
[40:40] that they were righteous and despised
[40:42] others
[40:43] two men went up into the temple to pray
[40:45] the one a pharisee and the other
[40:47] republican
[40:48] the pharisees stood and prayed thus with
[40:51] himself
[40:51] god i thank thee that i am not as
[40:55] other men are extortioners unjust
[40:57] adulterers or even as this republican
[41:00] i fast twice in the week i give tithes
[41:02] of all that i possess
[41:04] and the publicans standing afar off
[41:05] would not lift up so much as his eyes
[41:08] into heaven
[41:08] but smote upon his breath saying god be
[41:11] merciful to me a sinner.
[41:13] i tell you this man went down to his
[41:15] house justified rather than the other
[41:17] for everyone that exalted himself shall
[41:19] be abased and he that humbled himself
[41:22] shall be exalted
[41:26] i'm just you see these attitudes
[41:32] all the time and sometimes these
[41:35] attitudes are bold and sometimes they're
[41:36] subtle
[41:38] but sometimes people individuals can
[41:42] take the title of
[41:43] bride and do such horrible things with
[41:46] it and be so
[41:46] arrogant
[41:50] so so arrogant and condescending and
[41:53] judgmental and critical to everyone
[41:54] around them
[41:55] because they're the bride and it's no
[41:57] different than a pharisee spirit
[42:00] but that's not the wife that god's
[42:02] looking for he's looking for a bride
[42:04] who's humble
[42:05] and sweet and gentle and submissive
[42:08] is that right i mean brother ben was
[42:12] such an example to us
[42:13] amen you never see him taking those
[42:15] attitudes at any time he briefly did in
[42:17] the pulpit god corrected him quickly
[42:20] and humbled him amen and so we can
[42:24] we can go one way or we can go the other
[42:26] way but god wants us right down the
[42:27] middle he wants to stay true to his word
[42:29] and he wants us to express the right
[42:31] portion and he wants us to always
[42:33] remember
[42:34] without him we can do nothing
[42:38] without him we are nothing without him
[42:41] without his anointing without
[42:42] inspiration that comes from him
[42:44] amen a preacher cannot even preach
[42:46] without the inspiration of the holy
[42:47] ghost amen
[42:48] it doesn't matter what kind of gift is
[42:50] in him but if he's got a true gift
[42:51] he waits for that inspiration and he's
[42:53] helpless without it
[42:56] amen had so many saturdays where i labor
[42:59] and labor and labor and read and read
[43:01] and read all friday all saturday
[43:03] and have no inspiration and it's not
[43:05] that there's nothing to preach
[43:06] there's sermons i mean sermons full of
[43:09] good food the bible's
[43:10] litter i mean literally full amen of the
[43:13] word of god amen but without inspiration
[43:15] you're helpless
[43:17] i called and talked to somebody one day
[43:18] i was in one of those positions i said
[43:20] pray for me
[43:20] he said what's going on i said the sales
[43:22] are up but there's no wind
[43:26] we're doing our part amen the sales are
[43:28] up amen
[43:29] amen we've got the rigging all in place
[43:32] we're all ready to sail
[43:33] but without the wind we can do nothing
[43:37] amen without the mail we can do nothing
[43:40] amen we need him
[43:41] we always need him every day of our
[43:43] lives we need him
[43:44] we will never be able to operate
[43:46] independently of him
[43:47] and he is the word that has been
[43:49] revealed to us in this day
[43:52] and we need it and we need to stay
[43:53] submissive to it
[43:57] and the message question from questions
[43:59] and answers from 1959 brother ben says
[44:02] it isn't that just the way that people
[44:04] get today
[44:05] let god just bless a fellow and put a
[44:07] little confidence in him
[44:08] and he gets to be a know-it-all he gets
[44:10] to be he's got to start an organization
[44:12] or he's got to do something that's
[44:14] different
[44:14] why art thou fallen from heaven or
[44:16] lucifer
[44:17] god has a hard time trying to get
[44:19] somebody that he can deal with that will
[44:20] stay humble and meek
[44:22] and stay in the place until god calls
[44:24] him to do something
[44:25] you believe that a man that god can
[44:27] bless and he'll still keep himself a man
[44:30] not be an angel or a god and as soon as
[44:32] a man gets blessed and has a little
[44:34] something given to him he wants to
[44:36] become a god he wants to become an angel
[44:38] he wants to become some great person
[44:40] amen see
[44:42] what i do me and my me and mine all that
[44:45] that's the wrong attitude
[44:47] god's hunting for somebody who he could
[44:49] bless and pour out blessings
[44:51] and the more he blesses the littler that
[44:53] man will become
[44:55] and you'll never get more of god until
[44:57] you become nothing
[44:59] oh this is good friends you'll never get
[45:01] more of god until you become nothing
[45:03] you've got to be little yourself he that
[45:06] will exalt himself god will bring a base
[45:08] he that will humble himself god will
[45:10] exalt you've got to get little before
[45:12] you can get big
[45:13] and you'll never be big in your own self
[45:15] you'll only be
[45:16] as big as god will be big in you
[45:20] we need him i want to look at
[45:24] the apostle paul's attitude before i
[45:25] move on to the real meat of what i want
[45:27] to get to but let's turn to first
[45:29] timothy together
[45:31] first timothy
[45:42] first timothy chapter 1.
[45:47] first timothy 1 and we'll begin at 12.
[45:52] i think christ jesus our lord who hath
[45:55] enabled me
[45:56] for that he counted me faithful putting
[45:58] me into the ministry who was before
[46:00] a blasphemer and a persecutor an
[46:03] interest but i obtained mercy because i
[46:05] did it ignorantly and unbelief
[46:07] and the grace of our lord was
[46:09] exceedingly abundant with faith
[46:11] and love which is in christ jesus this
[46:13] is a faithful saying and worthy of all
[46:15] exception
[46:17] acceptation that christ jesus came into
[46:19] the world to save sinners
[46:21] of who i am chief
[46:24] how be it for this cause i obtain mercy
[46:26] for that in me
[46:28] first i for that in me first jesus
[46:31] christ might show forth all
[46:32] longsuffering
[46:33] for a pattern to them which should here
[46:35] after believe on him to life
[46:37] everlasting the apostle paul
[46:40] was not boasting of his goodness the
[46:42] apostle paul was saying
[46:44] jesus by his mercy he's enabled me
[46:47] to be a faithful minister that god has
[46:50] chosen me and
[46:51] and i and i i was a blasphemer and i did
[46:53] these things but i did it ignorantly and
[46:55] unbelievable
[46:56] amen but this is a faithful saying amen
[46:58] that jesus christ come to save sinners
[47:00] of whom i am chief and why did he do it
[47:04] he did it to show you
[47:07] the pattern so that you could be saved
[47:10] that's what he's saying so the apostle
[47:13] paul
[47:14] you know i'd like to read that part
[47:16] again how be it for this cause i obtain
[47:18] mercy for this reason i obtain mercy
[47:21] that in me first jesus christ might show
[47:23] forth all longsuffering
[47:26] for the for a pattern to them which
[47:28] should hereafter
[47:29] believe on him to life ever life
[47:32] everlasting
[47:33] so paul's not saying i did anything i'm
[47:36] nothing special
[47:37] he said i was wrong i was the chief of
[47:39] sinners but god showed mercy and he did
[47:41] this for this reason
[47:42] he showed mercy unto me to show his
[47:44] longsuffering as a pattern for you who
[47:45] would believe
[47:47] so if he can save me he can save you
[47:50] so paul was not you know paul was not
[47:54] exalted in himself but he realized the
[47:56] position god put him in
[47:57] and why and he realized that it was all
[47:59] by mercy and it was by grace
[48:01] go to first corinthians 15.
[48:07] first corinthians 15
[48:10] and 9.
[48:14] first corinthians chapter 15 beginning
[48:16] in verse 9
[48:18] for i am the least of the apostles
[48:21] and that i am not meet to be called an
[48:24] apostle because i persecuted the church
[48:25] of god
[48:27] paul is placing himself now now the
[48:30] apostle paul
[48:31] we know is the first church age
[48:32] messenger we know that he's a prophet
[48:34] that he is going to write
[48:36] the majority of the new testament we
[48:38] know this about paul so in
[48:39] our eyes paul is tremendous he was a
[48:42] tremendous gift to us
[48:43] and through that vessel god would give
[48:45] us his word and he would place much of
[48:47] the old testament
[48:48] into the new testament paul had a major
[48:50] position
[48:51] as he met the pillar of fire was called
[48:53] by christ himself
[48:54] amen and given instruction on the word
[48:56] he had a major position but paul in his
[48:58] own eyes
[48:59] was little paul said i am
[49:03] least of the apostles and not even
[49:05] worthy
[49:06] to be called an apostle because i
[49:08] persecuted the church
[49:10] but by the grace of god i am what i am
[49:13] and his grace which was bestowed upon me
[49:15] was not in vain
[49:16] but i labored more abundantly than they
[49:18] all yet not i
[49:20] but the grace of god which was with me
[49:24] the apostle paul won't take credit
[49:27] for nothing
[49:30] was he was he the prophet of the age yes
[49:33] was he predestinated that position yes
[49:36] was god working in and through him
[49:38] yes but in his own estimation he was
[49:40] little
[49:42] it was all he recognized it wasn't him
[49:45] it was god's grace
[49:46] it was god's mercy it was god he said no
[49:49] not in vain because i labored more than
[49:51] them but not me it was the grace that
[49:53] was in me
[49:55] he's always given credit to god listen
[49:58] to brother branham he does the exact
[49:59] same thing
[50:00] and the anointed ones at the end time so
[50:02] now i want you to know this
[50:04] is sure and you that listen to this tape
[50:06] you might have thought today that i was
[50:07] trying to say that about myself
[50:09] being that i was packing this message i
[50:11] have no more to do with it than nothing
[50:14] no more than just a voice
[50:16] was this the prophet of the age yes was
[50:18] it elohim working in flesh to
[50:21] demonstrate himself yes did he have more
[50:24] did he have more gifts and more
[50:26] manifestations than anything else we've
[50:27] ever seen
[50:28] absolutely but look at his attitude
[50:31] about himself
[50:33] this is what's so important friends it
[50:35] doesn't change who he is
[50:36] it doesn't change his position he's not
[50:38] denying that he's the seventh angel
[50:40] he's not denying that he's called of the
[50:42] lord a child of god with an attribute of
[50:44] god on the inside he's not denying all
[50:46] of that
[50:46] but he's putting himself in his proper
[50:48] place so that he can have the proper
[50:49] expression
[50:53] so that god is god and god is the one
[50:56] who's worshipped and god is the one
[50:58] who's praised
[51:02] he said you might have thought today
[51:04] that i was trying to say that about
[51:06] myself being that i was packing this
[51:07] message
[51:08] i have no more to do with it than
[51:10] nothing no more than just a voice
[51:12] and my voice even against my better
[51:14] judgment
[51:15] i wanted to be a trapper but it's the
[51:17] will of my father that i declared to do
[51:19] and determined to do i wasn't the one
[51:22] that appeared down on the river
[51:23] i was only standing there when he
[51:25] appeared i'm not the one that performs
[51:27] these things and foretells these things
[51:29] that happens as perfectly
[51:31] as perfect they are i'm only one that's
[51:33] near when he does it
[51:34] i was only a voice that he used to say
[51:36] it it wasn't what i knew
[51:38] it's what i just surrendered myself to
[51:40] that he spoke through
[51:42] it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel
[51:44] oh no
[51:45] it was the manifestation of the son of
[51:47] man it wasn't the angel his message
[51:49] it was the mystery that god unfolded
[51:51] it's not a man
[51:52] it's god the angel was not the son of
[51:55] man he was the messenger from the son of
[51:57] man
[51:58] the son of man is christ he is the one
[52:00] that you're feeding on
[52:01] you're not feeding on a man a man his
[52:03] words will fail but you're feeding on
[52:05] the unfailing body word
[52:06] of the son of man brother venom
[52:11] he kept the pattern sure he kept the
[52:14] pattern true
[52:15] amen because every servant of god always
[52:18] points all praise worship
[52:20] acknowledgement back to god
[52:22] when jesus was here he was the son of
[52:25] god he's the messiah
[52:26] the anointed one god and flesh the
[52:28] fullness of the godhead
[52:30] god was in him reconciling the world and
[52:32] to himself and jesus christ is always
[52:34] saying
[52:34] i didn't do it it wasn't me it was the
[52:36] father i can do nothing of myself it's
[52:38] the father that doeth the works amen
[52:40] worship god well who was he
[52:45] god in flesh but what was he doing
[52:46] pointing back to the father amen
[52:49] and here we are in this day amen we're
[52:52] we are
[52:53] here expressing amen the very life that
[52:55] was in the bridegroom is now here
[52:57] the what was what was wheat has gone
[52:59] through the process and come back to
[53:00] wheat again
[53:01] it was the word there it's the word here
[53:03] it's the very life of jesus christ on
[53:05] display
[53:06] but in our expression what do we do we
[53:08] point back to our husband it's not me
[53:10] it's him
[53:12] it's not what i did it's what jesus
[53:14] christ did for me it's not me but it's
[53:16] his life through me
[53:17] it's not what i do it's not me it's not
[53:20] about me
[53:20] it's all about him amen why do you say
[53:23] that because
[53:23] every character in the bible did the
[53:25] same thing
[53:27] and when god was here in the form of
[53:29] jesus christ he took the same approach
[53:31] but the apostle paul took the same
[53:33] approach brother branham took the same
[53:35] approach
[53:35] and this bride is going to take the same
[53:38] approach she's not going to say
[53:39] i'm bright therefore i say therefore i
[53:41] do she says i'm nothing but he's
[53:43] everything
[53:45] and he's chosen me by his grace amen
[53:48] it's by his grace by his foreknowledge
[53:49] by his predestination
[53:51] not by my marriage not by my efforts not
[53:53] by my brightness
[53:55] not by my intellect i failed in all of
[53:57] that and i'm an
[53:58] utter failure and all of that amen but
[54:00] it's god who has chosen me
[54:02] it's god who is selected and it's god
[54:04] who's working through me if there's
[54:06] anything to be praised
[54:07] it's not me it's jesus christ
[54:11] it's my husband my bridegroom the true
[54:14] king
[54:16] but you're the queen yeah but i bow
[54:18] before the king
[54:25] see it's all about attitude
[54:31] there's a truth the truth is
[54:34] the bride is the expression of christ on
[54:36] earth
[54:38] she is the body of jesus christ the
[54:41] flesh of jesus christ collectively as a
[54:43] whole
[54:43] the bride on this earth now is the body
[54:46] of jesus christ she is
[54:48] but she's an expression and female
[54:52] and her attitude needs to remain true to
[54:54] the scriptural pattern
[54:56] and when that attitude begins to shift
[54:58] and arrogancy and pride begins to come
[55:00] in
[55:01] you know right there that satan is
[55:03] trying to push her a little too far
[55:07] because it's different than how
[55:08] everybody else acted in the bible
[55:10] and it's different than what we saw in
[55:12] the prophet
[55:15] in the message influence brother bennett
[55:18] said if you want to find how great you
[55:19] are
[55:20] put your finger down in a pool of water
[55:21] or a bucket of water then pull your
[55:23] finger out and try to find
[55:25] where you put your finger you're nothing
[55:29] listen i know brother branham also said
[55:32] you're the virtuous if you're standing
[55:34] with this word another with you're the
[55:35] virtuous sinless spotless bride of jesus
[55:37] christ
[55:38] that's true but this is also true
[55:42] they're both true and it has to do how
[55:46] it has to do with how you as an
[55:49] individual you view yourself and view
[55:52] god
[55:55] so where you put your finger you're
[55:57] nothing god can do without you
[56:00] now this is a major statement brother
[56:02] i'm saying this after the seals
[56:04] november of 1963 he said god can do
[56:06] without you
[56:07] he can do without me but we can't do
[56:10] without him
[56:11] we've got to have him for he is life and
[56:14] he alone
[56:16] now listen brother bam is expressing an
[56:18] attitude not a doctrine because
[56:19] doctrinally brother branham would say
[56:21] if you're an attribute of god god's not
[56:23] complete without you he does need you
[56:25] amen but brother branham is now coming
[56:26] back to you as a person in your flesh
[56:29] amen as a human being he's trying to get
[56:31] get us to stay in the right place in the
[56:33] right frame of mind with the right
[56:35] attitude
[56:38] yes god is not going to do without
[56:39] himself amen the attribute that he
[56:41] placed in your soul
[56:42] amen he is not going to live without
[56:44] that he needs that that's another
[56:46] expression of himself
[56:47] amen he is he is incomplete without you
[56:50] that is absolutely the truth but you
[56:52] have to realize
[56:53] that that's him and you amen that's a
[56:55] portion that he allotted to be
[56:57] the expression of you but it come from
[56:59] him he did it by his grace
[57:00] amen it's not you as a human being that
[57:03] did
[57:04] anything
[57:07] so that's why brother branham can say
[57:08] god can do without you
[57:11] you he can do without me really
[57:14] god could have done this without brother
[57:15] branham
[57:17] you see it's an attitude friends he's
[57:20] bringing us to the right attitude
[57:23] but we can't do without him we've got to
[57:26] have him for he is life and he alone
[57:29] not to know his book and not to know
[57:30] this or know that or know the creed
[57:32] but to know him as life know him as a
[57:34] person christ in you the word made flesh
[57:37] in you
[57:37] that's knowing him when he you and he
[57:41] become
[57:42] becomes one like i said last night in
[57:44] the super sign he has got to come
[57:46] in you god and man must come one and
[57:48] you're
[57:49] conscious of your littleness because
[57:52] it's all him
[57:53] it's not me it's him
[57:56] in me i want to go to revelation
[58:01] chapter 3. i want to read two passages
[58:02] there and then we're going to go to the
[58:04] book of esther
[58:16] revelations chapter 3
[58:21] verse 17. this is the last church age
[58:25] the final church
[58:26] he says because thou sayest i am rich
[58:30] and increased with goods and have need
[58:32] of nothing
[58:33] and knowest not that thou are wretched
[58:36] and miserable
[58:37] and poor and blind and naked
[58:41] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[58:43] in the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[58:45] white raiment that thou mayest be
[58:46] clothed
[58:47] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[58:48] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[58:51] eyes
[58:51] that thou may see as many as i love
[58:55] i rebuke and chasten be zealous
[58:58] therefore
[58:59] and repent
[59:03] see this last church
[59:06] thought everything was fine because she
[59:10] had an overinflated estimation of
[59:12] herself
[59:14] she had left the word her bridegroom her
[59:16] mate she had left the word and thought
[59:18] she was fine
[59:19] because of her title that she supposed
[59:22] that she still had
[59:24] she still believed that she was bright
[59:25] she still believed that she was queen
[59:27] but she had already left the headship
[59:29] and when she left the headship she put
[59:30] him on the outside of the church
[59:32] and now she was standing there thinking
[59:34] she was clothed thinking she was rich
[59:36] thinking she was increased with goods
[59:37] but she was poor miserable blind and
[59:40] naked
[59:42] and god says in verse 19 as many as i
[59:45] love
[59:46] i rebuke and chase and be zealous
[59:47] therefore and repent
[59:50] what wonderful words as many as i love
[59:53] i rebuke and chasten
[59:58] see this church had got to the place
[1:00:03] where they didn't think god would
[1:00:05] chasten them because they're the church
[1:00:08] they didn't think god would rebuke or
[1:00:10] chase him because
[1:00:11] we're this and we're that and we have
[1:00:13] this but he says as many as i love i
[1:00:15] rebuke and chase sin
[1:00:17] and don't think for a minute that god
[1:00:19] will not correct his bride god will
[1:00:21] correct his bride
[1:00:23] whenever and that's one thing the bible
[1:00:25] says thy rod and thy staff they comfort
[1:00:28] me
[1:00:28] i take comfort in that if i am his bride
[1:00:31] it doesn't mean that i'll never do wrong
[1:00:32] but if i get to one side or the other
[1:00:34] his rod and his staff they comfort me he
[1:00:36] will chase and he will rebuke
[1:00:38] if he loves me
[1:00:41] so brother bam said you know he talked
[1:00:43] to that young man that young man said
[1:00:44] oh god loves me so much he doesn't care
[1:00:46] what i do
[1:00:49] none of us would say that not one of us
[1:00:51] would say a thing like that because we
[1:00:53] heard the brother ben say it not but
[1:00:54] sometimes in our attitude we can express
[1:00:57] that
[1:00:57] we can disregard and take the wrong
[1:00:59] attitude have an arrogant spirit
[1:01:01] and assume something but what we need to
[1:01:02] do is say god search my life and make me
[1:01:05] be pleasing to you
[1:01:06] i think that's our hearts cry amen
[1:01:08] that's the spirit of the age that's come
[1:01:10] upon the bride
[1:01:11] is to be submissive to be humble to be
[1:01:13] reverent to be respectful
[1:01:16] and to know that if there's any good
[1:01:17] thing that's happening it's him and not
[1:01:19] i
[1:01:20] he's done it through me let's go to
[1:01:24] verse 18 we've already referenced this
[1:01:25] but i would like to read it together
[1:01:27] or i'm sorry chapter 18 chapter 18
[1:01:31] in revelation
[1:01:35] i'm going to read verse 4.
[1:01:43] and i heard another voice from heaven
[1:01:45] saying come out of her my people
[1:01:48] that you be not partakers of her sins
[1:01:50] and that you receive not of her plagues
[1:01:52] for her sins have reached into heaven
[1:01:54] and god hath remembered her iniquities
[1:01:56] reward her even as she rewarded you and
[1:01:59] double under her double according to her
[1:02:01] works
[1:02:01] and the cup which she has filled filled
[1:02:03] to her double
[1:02:05] how much she hath glorified herself
[1:02:09] what did this church do glorified
[1:02:12] herself
[1:02:14] amen this is one thing that the bride
[1:02:16] will never do she will never glorify
[1:02:18] herself
[1:02:19] she will wait for her husband to glorify
[1:02:21] her
[1:02:23] she will not glorify herself how much he
[1:02:26] hath glorified herself and lived
[1:02:27] deliciously so much
[1:02:29] torment and sorrow give her for she
[1:02:31] saith in her heart
[1:02:32] i sit a queen and am no widow and shall
[1:02:35] see no sorrow
[1:02:36] therefore shall her plagues come in one
[1:02:38] day death and mourning and famine
[1:02:40] and she shall be utterly burned with
[1:02:42] fire for strong is the lord god
[1:02:45] who judgeth her she thought she was
[1:02:48] beyond judgment
[1:02:50] she thought she was the queen and would
[1:02:53] see no sorrow
[1:02:55] but she didn't realize that she had
[1:02:57] already left her mate
[1:02:59] her husband and she was rejected
[1:03:02] amen she wasn't humble she exalted
[1:03:05] herself
[1:03:07] with all these things that we talked
[1:03:08] about i want to take this now to the
[1:03:09] book of esther
[1:03:10] because i want to show the attitude and
[1:03:12] approach of the bride
[1:03:14] the book of esther let's turn there
[1:03:17] esther we'll start with esther chapter
[1:03:19] one
[1:03:29] now i'd like to just say all the way
[1:03:32] back from the garden of eden and beyond
[1:03:35] whenever the woman gets out of her
[1:03:37] position it brings death
[1:03:39] not life but if the woman out of
[1:03:43] position
[1:03:44] can bring death then the woman in
[1:03:45] position can bring life
[1:03:48] so let's look here at esther chapter 1
[1:03:50] verse 2.
[1:03:54] it says that in those days when king
[1:03:57] azzarah sat on the throne of his kingdom
[1:03:59] which was shusha and the palace
[1:04:01] in the third year of his reign he made a
[1:04:03] feast into all the princes and his
[1:04:05] servants the power of persian media
[1:04:07] and the nobles the princes of the
[1:04:09] province as being before him
[1:04:11] when he showed the riches of his
[1:04:12] glorious kingdom in the honor of his
[1:04:14] excellent majesty
[1:04:15] many days even a hundred and four score
[1:04:18] days
[1:04:19] so we want to look at this and like i
[1:04:20] said we went over this many times but it
[1:04:22] still so
[1:04:22] comes back so fresh to me he had this
[1:04:26] feast amen for six months but at the end
[1:04:28] of six months
[1:04:29] you're going into the seventh month now
[1:04:31] so 180 days back in biblical time
[1:04:34] with six months at the end of six months
[1:04:36] he's going into the seventh month
[1:04:38] and so now when it says uh
[1:04:41] many days even a hundred and four score
[1:04:43] days and verse five and when these days
[1:04:46] were expired so after that going into
[1:04:48] the seventh
[1:04:49] so we can start to place ourselves right
[1:04:51] here
[1:04:52] in the seventh church age right here in
[1:04:54] time and when these days were expired
[1:04:56] the king made a feast unto all the
[1:04:58] people that were present in shusha and
[1:04:59] the palace
[1:05:00] both under the great and small seven
[1:05:02] days in the court of the garden of the
[1:05:04] king
[1:05:05] of the palace so there's a seven day
[1:05:07] feast taking place in the seventh month
[1:05:09] this is so good because in the seventh
[1:05:11] church age we're going to have
[1:05:13] amen all seven church ages expressed
[1:05:15] amen all the truths of the seven church
[1:05:17] ages expressed
[1:05:18] in the seventh church age so he's gonna
[1:05:20] have a feast amen for seven days
[1:05:24] i wanna i wanna jump down from there to
[1:05:26] verse nine
[1:05:28] also vashti the queen made a feast for
[1:05:30] the women in the royal house
[1:05:32] which belonged to king azaris on the
[1:05:35] seventh day
[1:05:36] the seventh day of the seven day feast
[1:05:39] in the seventh month
[1:05:41] so when he gets all the way down to the
[1:05:42] end he's going to do something
[1:05:44] and the seventh day when the heart of
[1:05:46] the king was married with the
[1:05:48] that was mary with wine he com he
[1:05:50] commanded
[1:05:51] and these are seven names i'm not going
[1:05:53] to try to read all those names
[1:05:54] amen the seven chamberlain's that served
[1:05:56] in the presence of azares the king
[1:05:59] to bring vashti the queen before the
[1:06:01] king with the crown royal
[1:06:02] to show the people and the princess her
[1:06:04] beauty for she was
[1:06:05] fair to look on so now we come to the
[1:06:08] seventh month
[1:06:09] there's a seventh day there's a seven
[1:06:11] day feast amen and then the seventh day
[1:06:14] amen you've got seven seven seven amen
[1:06:18] and the seventh day he sent seven
[1:06:20] chamberlains
[1:06:21] like the seven church age messengers
[1:06:24] that were in the cloud
[1:06:25] he sends the seven amen go to go
[1:06:29] fetch vashti the queen amen she's the
[1:06:31] queen
[1:06:32] come and fetch her and bring her amen
[1:06:35] into the face so all can see her because
[1:06:37] she's beautiful
[1:06:41] verse 12 but the queen vashti refused to
[1:06:44] comment the king's commandment
[1:06:46] by his chamberlains therefore was the
[1:06:48] king very roth
[1:06:49] in his anger burned in him
[1:06:53] here she has a wonderful opportunity
[1:06:57] but this queen the king sends her and
[1:07:00] sends seven chamberlains after her
[1:07:02] and he goes after her on the seventh day
[1:07:04] of the feast to bring her
[1:07:05] for all the people to see what's he
[1:07:07] doing he's going to
[1:07:08] unveil the bride he's going to bring out
[1:07:10] the queen
[1:07:12] and he tells her to get her her royal
[1:07:14] apparel and her crown
[1:07:16] amen come out i want all the people to
[1:07:18] see amen my beautiful queen
[1:07:20] amen but she refused to come to the
[1:07:23] king's bidding
[1:07:24] amen and and that's exactly what
[1:07:27] happened in this church a.j man
[1:07:29] god sent a messenger with a powerful
[1:07:31] demonstration in the word
[1:07:32] and he restored i mean he restored the
[1:07:34] word back amen but the church
[1:07:36] denominational systems refused to come
[1:07:39] to the feast
[1:07:44] what was she doing she was having her
[1:07:47] own feast for the women
[1:07:50] she was caught up in her own ecumenical
[1:07:52] move with all the other churches
[1:07:57] and she refused and you you realize how
[1:08:01] how uh terrible this is because you
[1:08:04] realize
[1:08:05] she was the queen amen and she was the
[1:08:08] queen
[1:08:08] and the queen had a position and that
[1:08:11] position came with
[1:08:12] certain power and authority and when she
[1:08:14] was in this position
[1:08:15] she was now using that uh position to
[1:08:18] have a feast for
[1:08:20] uh for the women and then this feast of
[1:08:22] women she would rather stay
[1:08:24] in her own feast the feast of women than
[1:08:26] comet the king's bidding to the king's
[1:08:28] feast
[1:08:30] and that is exactly what has happened in
[1:08:32] our day friends we've seen this with our
[1:08:33] own eyes
[1:08:34] they would rather stay in their own feet
[1:08:36] the queen making her own feast the feast
[1:08:38] for the women for all the denominations
[1:08:40] staying in their ecumenical move and
[1:08:42] refused to come to the feast of the king
[1:08:47] but the sad part is she was only a queen
[1:08:52] by the choice of the king not
[1:08:55] by her own merit
[1:08:59] see she refused the one who made her
[1:09:03] queen
[1:09:05] she was so if i could just put it in my
[1:09:08] own way of understanding and viewing
[1:09:09] this
[1:09:10] she was so exalted in her own glory
[1:09:14] she was so puffed up and so exalted and
[1:09:18] so deceived by her own brightness
[1:09:20] she was beautiful she was rich she was
[1:09:22] the queen
[1:09:23] she was in position and then she now has
[1:09:26] her own
[1:09:27] idea and her own idea is a is a
[1:09:30] is a feast for the women and she wants
[1:09:33] to stay with her
[1:09:34] own idea and not come to the bidding of
[1:09:36] the king
[1:09:37] and the king is the one who made her
[1:09:39] queen she's not
[1:09:40] queen of her own right she's only queen
[1:09:42] by the will of the king
[1:09:46] see how foolish the church systems are
[1:09:49] amen they leave
[1:09:50] off the word which is their very king
[1:09:52] amen to take their own idea
[1:09:53] because their church because i'm the
[1:09:56] bride because i'm this church or that
[1:09:58] church or this church
[1:09:59] i have this title or that title amen i
[1:10:01] can begin
[1:10:02] you know all the churches come up with
[1:10:04] their own doctrine and own dogmas and
[1:10:05] own ideas
[1:10:06] and own answers to questions outside the
[1:10:09] word of god
[1:10:09] and sometimes contrary to the word of
[1:10:11] god
[1:10:13] and why do they do that because they say
[1:10:15] they're the church of the living god
[1:10:17] and we have a right to do this
[1:10:22] not realizing the only reason that you
[1:10:24] are even queen is by choice of the king
[1:10:27] the king makes you queen not you
[1:10:29] yourself make yourself that
[1:10:31] you're nothing without the king and the
[1:10:33] king is this revealed word amen
[1:10:36] it is the word of god which is our
[1:10:38] headship is our husband
[1:10:39] the revealed word of the hour
[1:10:42] so the act independent of that word is
[1:10:45] to do exactly what vashti was doing
[1:10:49] make our own choices to go our own way
[1:10:53] to make our own decisions because we are
[1:10:57] we're nothing without the king and we're
[1:10:59] only what the king has made us
[1:11:02] and how many times not just in the bible
[1:11:06] but through the church ages did god
[1:11:09] put away one to take another
[1:11:17] they always israel thought they were the
[1:11:19] chosen nation
[1:11:21] nothing will ever hurt us and it was
[1:11:23] true they were the chosen nation
[1:11:25] nothing will ever hurt us nothing will
[1:11:26] harm us we're the chosen nation
[1:11:28] but when they left their god amen god
[1:11:31] rejected them
[1:11:35] they were the chosen nation by his
[1:11:37] choice
[1:11:39] they became a strong nation by his
[1:11:42] strength
[1:11:45] and they got puffed up because what god
[1:11:48] did for them
[1:11:49] they got blinded they forgot how little
[1:11:52] they were they forgot how helpless they
[1:11:53] were
[1:11:54] they forgot what it was like to be a
[1:11:56] slave in egypt
[1:11:57] to feel the task masters whip and have
[1:11:59] no way to deliver yourself
[1:12:02] they forgot what that was like when they
[1:12:05] got into position
[1:12:06] god chose them god led them by a pillar
[1:12:08] of fire god placed them in the land
[1:12:10] god drove out the inhabitants amen but
[1:12:12] they began all of a sudden
[1:12:13] to rely on their own strength amen and
[1:12:16] move away from the commandments and laws
[1:12:18] of god
[1:12:19] amen and then they would go into utter
[1:12:20] ruin because they were only
[1:12:22] there by the will of god and
[1:12:25] vashti was only in the palace by the
[1:12:28] will of azaris the king
[1:12:32] but yes she wanted to exert her own will
[1:12:35] she wanted to have her own way i think
[1:12:38] this is so
[1:12:39] so sad
[1:12:43] i said god never let me be like this
[1:12:46] vashti
[1:12:48] never let me get comfortable so
[1:12:50] comfortable in what you've done for me
[1:12:52] that i forget what i am without you
[1:13:00] amen let's look at verse
[1:13:04] 19. there's a council that takes place
[1:13:06] they
[1:13:07] they counsel with uh the king on what he
[1:13:09] should do and it comes to verse ninth he
[1:13:11] says if it pleased the king
[1:13:13] let there be a royal commandment from
[1:13:15] him and let it be written among the laws
[1:13:17] of the
[1:13:18] persians and the medes that it be not
[1:13:21] altered that vashti come no more before
[1:13:23] king azaris
[1:13:24] and let the king give her royal state
[1:13:26] unto another that is better
[1:13:28] than she wow
[1:13:33] they're going to get one that's better
[1:13:34] than she but
[1:13:36] i want you to look at the one that's
[1:13:38] better than she this is what we're going
[1:13:40] to spend some time with
[1:13:42] what were the qualifications what were
[1:13:43] the characteristics of the one that was
[1:13:45] better than she
[1:13:46] because listen she was beautiful she had
[1:13:49] the royal apparel
[1:13:51] she may have had you know by this time
[1:13:53] she had may have had all the right
[1:13:54] etiquette
[1:13:55] all the right forms she may have had
[1:13:57] social graces
[1:13:58] she had beauty amen there there was
[1:14:01] there was
[1:14:02] there was all of those things that the
[1:14:04] queen possessed but they were looking
[1:14:05] for one that was better than her because
[1:14:07] she wasn't good enough
[1:14:09] and she wasn't good enough by by virtue
[1:14:12] of her beauty or her refinement
[1:14:14] she wasn't good enough because she was
[1:14:15] exalted in her own eyes and refused the
[1:14:17] commandment of the king
[1:14:19] now they're going to look for one that's
[1:14:21] better than she
[1:14:23] let's look at chapter 2 verse 1
[1:14:27] after these things when the wrath of
[1:14:29] king azaris was appeased
[1:14:31] he remembered vashti and what she had
[1:14:33] done and what was decreed against her
[1:14:36] then said the king's servants that
[1:14:37] ministered unto him let there be fair
[1:14:39] young virgins sought for the king
[1:14:42] and let the king appoint officers in all
[1:14:44] the provinces of the kingdom
[1:14:45] that they may gather together all the
[1:14:47] fair young virgins into shusha and the
[1:14:49] palace
[1:14:49] to the house of the women and to the
[1:14:51] custody of haggai
[1:14:53] the king's chamberlain keeper of the
[1:14:54] women and let their things be
[1:14:56] for purification be given them and look
[1:15:00] at verse 4
[1:15:02] and let the maiden which pleaseth the
[1:15:04] king
[1:15:06] here we go this is what we're looking
[1:15:10] for
[1:15:12] let the maiden which pleases the king be
[1:15:14] queen
[1:15:15] instead of vashti vashti was more
[1:15:18] interested in pleasing herself than she
[1:15:19] wasn't pleasing the king
[1:15:22] but now let's get a maiden that pleases
[1:15:24] the king
[1:15:26] the queen instead of vashti and the
[1:15:28] thing pleased the king
[1:15:30] and he did so let's go down to verse 8.
[1:15:36] so it came to pass when the king's
[1:15:38] commandment in his decree was heard
[1:15:41] and when many maidens were gathered
[1:15:43] together into shush and the palace to
[1:15:44] the custody of haggai
[1:15:46] that esther was brought also into the
[1:15:48] king's house
[1:15:49] to the custody of haggai keeper the
[1:15:51] women and the maiden pleased him and she
[1:15:53] obtained kindness of him
[1:15:55] and he speedily gave her things for
[1:15:57] purification
[1:15:58] with with with such things as belonged
[1:16:01] to her
[1:16:02] and seven maidens which were meat to be
[1:16:04] given to her
[1:16:05] out of the king's house he preferred her
[1:16:07] and her maids into the best place of the
[1:16:09] house
[1:16:10] of the women esther had not showed her
[1:16:12] people nor her kindred
[1:16:14] for mordecai had charged her that she
[1:16:16] should
[1:16:17] not show it so here i'm going to
[1:16:20] we're going to expound upon several
[1:16:22] things in here but we realize now
[1:16:24] esther is is the adopted daughter of
[1:16:27] mordecai because mordecai
[1:16:29] the esther is his cousin mordecai's
[1:16:31] uncle this is mordecai's uncle's
[1:16:33] daughter
[1:16:34] and her parents died and mordecai took
[1:16:36] her and raised her as his own daughter
[1:16:38] so his adopted daughter is esther
[1:16:41] and esther is obedient to mordecai so
[1:16:44] one of the first things we want to see
[1:16:46] here that esther is submissive to
[1:16:49] headship
[1:16:52] esther is submissive to her headship
[1:16:56] and and when esther goes to the king
[1:17:00] esther didn't go to the king by her own
[1:17:03] choosing
[1:17:05] you realize the king's servants went out
[1:17:07] and gathered all the fair young virgins
[1:17:09] and they made the selection and they
[1:17:11] brought them in so it wasn't esther's
[1:17:13] own choosing
[1:17:14] esther didn't say well i mean i think i
[1:17:17] meet all the qualifications i think
[1:17:19] i've got this and i've got that and i've
[1:17:20] got my resume and i'm going to go up to
[1:17:22] the king's palace and i'm going to take
[1:17:24] my resume and give it to him
[1:17:25] esther did not have this estimation of
[1:17:28] herself
[1:17:30] esther was chosen by one of the king's
[1:17:32] servants went and called her
[1:17:34] and brought her in to the house of
[1:17:36] haggai where she can be prepared to meet
[1:17:38] the king
[1:17:38] and then because the king was going to
[1:17:40] choose the one that pleases him to be
[1:17:41] queen instead of ashty
[1:17:44] so vashti lost her position is that
[1:17:47] right
[1:17:49] so that shows that vashti that it had
[1:17:52] nothing
[1:17:52] to do with vashti
[1:17:55] because if she lost her position she
[1:17:58] didn't give herself the position she
[1:17:59] didn't earn the position
[1:18:00] she only had the position by the choice
[1:18:03] of the king
[1:18:04] and when the king changed his choice she
[1:18:06] lost her position
[1:18:08] now he's looking for one that will
[1:18:09] please him but god is going to give us
[1:18:11] insight
[1:18:12] into this esther and esther now she went
[1:18:15] in and
[1:18:15] then esther was was admired by haggai
[1:18:18] haggy i loved her and
[1:18:20] haggy i chose her and haggy i set her in
[1:18:23] a special position and gave her a maiden
[1:18:24] and gave her all the things she needed
[1:18:25] for purification
[1:18:27] because she pleased haggai and we're
[1:18:29] starting to find out now that esther has
[1:18:31] the kind of nature
[1:18:32] amen esther has the kind of approach
[1:18:34] amen where she's submissive and pleasing
[1:18:37] haggai becomes she haggy i has
[1:18:40] charge of the virgins he's in charge and
[1:18:43] now she submisses the haggy eye
[1:18:44] and and she's pleasing to haggai she
[1:18:48] doesn't show her people her kindred
[1:18:50] because mordecai
[1:18:51] her adopted father told her not to and
[1:18:54] let's look at this over at verse 20.
[1:18:56] verse 20 says the same thing of the same
[1:18:58] chapter chapter 2 verse 20.
[1:19:00] esther had not yet showed her kindred
[1:19:02] nor her people
[1:19:03] as mordecai had charged her for esther
[1:19:05] did the commandment of mordecai lack as
[1:19:07] when she was brought up
[1:19:09] with him here she
[1:19:12] is she can choose her own way mordecai
[1:19:15] has no more say over her
[1:19:17] mordechai she's gone into the charge of
[1:19:19] haggai
[1:19:20] she's gone amen she's independent now
[1:19:22] amen but she has a submissive nature to
[1:19:25] headship
[1:19:26] and mordecai was like a father to her it
[1:19:28] was her adopted dad
[1:19:30] and when mordecai said don't show it she
[1:19:32] wouldn't show it
[1:19:33] when she was separated from work morocco
[1:19:35] she obeyed him just like when she was
[1:19:37] brought up with him
[1:19:39] what are we seeing we're seeing the
[1:19:40] nature of esther there's a nature here
[1:19:42] that is going to please the king
[1:19:50] amen let's let's look here back at verse
[1:19:53] 15.
[1:19:54] let's jump back to verse 15.
[1:19:58] now come a turn for each of these young
[1:20:00] virgins to go before the king
[1:20:02] and he was going to make his selection
[1:20:04] verse 15 said now when the turn of
[1:20:06] esther the daughter
[1:20:07] abigail the uncle of mordecai who had
[1:20:09] taken her for his daughter was come to
[1:20:11] go into
[1:20:12] to the king she required nothing but
[1:20:15] what haggai
[1:20:16] the king's chamberlain the keeper of the
[1:20:18] women appointed
[1:20:20] and esther obtained favor in the sight
[1:20:22] of all them
[1:20:23] that looked upon her this is an amazing
[1:20:27] scripture
[1:20:28] now it's her turn to go before the king
[1:20:31] and the king
[1:20:32] is going to make her selection and it
[1:20:34] says and it makes special note of this
[1:20:36] so i think it's important
[1:20:37] it says that that
[1:20:41] when it was her turn to go into the king
[1:20:44] she required nothing but what haggai the
[1:20:48] king's chamberlain the keeper the woman
[1:20:50] appointed when she went before the king
[1:20:54] she did not go with any of her own ideas
[1:20:59] she did not require anything else all
[1:21:02] that she went before the king
[1:21:04] was what haggai the keeper of the woman
[1:21:06] had appointed under her
[1:21:07] and when haggai who was her headship and
[1:21:10] pointed under her she says
[1:21:11] whatever you say is good enough for me
[1:21:13] whatever you give is right amen because
[1:21:16] esther had never been there but haggy i
[1:21:18] knew what the king liked
[1:21:20] haggai i knew what was appointed to the
[1:21:22] women haggy i gave it and when it says
[1:21:25] the scripture
[1:21:25] when it says it this way it leads you to
[1:21:28] believe that the
[1:21:29] other women were able to ask of things
[1:21:32] or have other things amen but here is
[1:21:34] one woman and i don't know how many
[1:21:36] there was or how many would have made
[1:21:38] the same choice
[1:21:38] but here's one woman who doesn't want
[1:21:41] anything of her own
[1:21:42] idea she doesn't want to adorn herself
[1:21:44] any differently than what haggai the
[1:21:46] keeper of the virgins told her to wear
[1:21:48] and appoint it to her to wear what are
[1:21:50] you seeing you're seeing a submissive
[1:21:52] nature
[1:21:54] i say this is what god wants this is
[1:21:57] what king azaris is going to be pleased
[1:21:59] with
[1:22:01] it says and esther obtained favor in the
[1:22:04] sight of all them that looked upon her
[1:22:06] so esther was taken in the king azaris
[1:22:08] into his house royal in the 10th month
[1:22:10] which is the month tibeth in the seventh
[1:22:12] year of his reign
[1:22:13] and the king loved esther above all the
[1:22:15] women and she obtained grace and favor
[1:22:18] in his sight
[1:22:18] more than all the virgins so that he set
[1:22:21] the royal crown upon her head
[1:22:22] and made her queen instead of vashti
[1:22:28] now who's the queen the one that pleased
[1:22:31] the king
[1:22:32] see now who's the the queen the one that
[1:22:35] pleased the king
[1:22:37] the one that didn't do it her own way
[1:22:39] but did it the way she was instructed by
[1:22:40] mordecai she kept his command
[1:22:42] by haggai she kept the things appointed
[1:22:44] to him now she comes before the king and
[1:22:46] the king says this is the one that i'm
[1:22:47] going to choose
[1:22:50] then the king made a great feast unto
[1:22:52] all his princes and his servants even
[1:22:54] esther's feast
[1:22:55] and he made a release to the provinces
[1:22:57] and gave gifts according to the state
[1:22:59] of the king praise
[1:23:02] be to god let's look over here verse 4.
[1:23:09] now as soon as as soon as esther gets
[1:23:12] promoted to queen
[1:23:13] guess who else gets promoted haman
[1:23:17] these these things are always running on
[1:23:18] parallel tracks
[1:23:20] and haman comes up with a plan to
[1:23:23] destroy
[1:23:24] amen to destroy the jews because he's
[1:23:26] jealous of mordecai
[1:23:27] amen and now he's going to come up with
[1:23:29] this plan and he's been exalted he's
[1:23:31] been
[1:23:32] lifted up amen he's been given a
[1:23:33] position in the kingdom
[1:23:35] and now he he's working his plan to
[1:23:37] destroy but there sits
[1:23:38] esther amen the humble little uh
[1:23:41] submissive queen
[1:23:42] amen that's obedient submissive gentle
[1:23:44] and quiet
[1:23:45] she's sitting there and we're going to
[1:23:47] find out that deliverance is going to
[1:23:49] come by this woman
[1:23:51] but this woman is never going to have to
[1:23:53] act like jezebel to bring deliverance to
[1:23:55] her people
[1:23:55] she is never going to have to get out of
[1:23:58] her position and her role
[1:23:59] to bring deliverance she's going to stay
[1:24:03] submissive
[1:24:04] humble reverent give honor amen and
[1:24:07] she's going to do
[1:24:08] all of those things and in keeping in
[1:24:11] her position
[1:24:12] she is going to deliver an entire
[1:24:14] kindred in people
[1:24:16] and you think you know to conquer to
[1:24:19] overcome to deliver
[1:24:20] she's the queen she'll stand there and
[1:24:22] she'll decree and she'll say
[1:24:24] no she doesn't change her nature amen
[1:24:27] she plays the role god gave her to play
[1:24:29] and when she plays that role she becomes
[1:24:31] a mighty conqueror and overcomes haman
[1:24:35] but she never has to become aggressive
[1:24:37] she never has to become burly
[1:24:39] she never has to become manly she
[1:24:41] doesn't have to become conniving
[1:24:42] she doesn't have to take her own ideas
[1:24:47] she can stay feminine gentle sweet
[1:24:50] reverent kind she can give honor and
[1:24:53] respect
[1:24:54] and in doing so the king will come to
[1:24:57] her side
[1:24:58] and deliver her what a picture of today
[1:25:02] friends we don't have to become
[1:25:04] arrogant and boastful and loud we don't
[1:25:06] all we have to do is stay in the role
[1:25:08] god gave us stay submissive to our
[1:25:10] headship
[1:25:10] and say god i'm doing what you said god
[1:25:12] i'm obedient to you and now i'm trusting
[1:25:14] in you to deliver me
[1:25:16] because i have no power to deliver
[1:25:18] myself
[1:25:20] all i have is what you've given all i
[1:25:22] have is the word you've given and i'm
[1:25:23] taking the word as you gave it the way
[1:25:25] the prophet
[1:25:26] said take it and i'm using it the way
[1:25:27] the prophet said use it and i'm trusting
[1:25:30] you
[1:25:30] to bring deliverance and i'm not going
[1:25:32] to change i'm just going to do it the
[1:25:34] way
[1:25:34] that your prophet said do it
[1:25:40] this plan begins to unfold and and after
[1:25:42] the decree comes out
[1:25:43] mordecai is in sackcloth and ashes and
[1:25:46] and somebody tells
[1:25:47] uh esther the queen and she begins to
[1:25:49] become worried
[1:25:50] amen and sends a chamberlain to go and
[1:25:53] speak to mordecai
[1:25:54] here's the conversation in chapter 4
[1:25:56] verse 7.
[1:25:58] and mordecai told him of all that had
[1:25:59] happened unto him and of the sum of the
[1:26:01] money that haman had promised to pay
[1:26:03] to the king's treasuries for the jews to
[1:26:05] destroy them
[1:26:07] also he gave him the copy of the writing
[1:26:09] of the decree that was given at shushan
[1:26:10] to destroy them
[1:26:12] to show it unto esther and to declare it
[1:26:14] unto her and to charge her that she
[1:26:16] should go in unto the king
[1:26:18] to make supplication unto him and to
[1:26:20] make requests before him for her people
[1:26:23] and heitach came and told esther the
[1:26:25] words of mordecai
[1:26:27] and again esther spoke unto hatetach and
[1:26:29] gave him commandment unto mordecai
[1:26:32] that all the king's servants and the
[1:26:34] people of the king's provinces do know
[1:26:36] that whosoever whether man or woman
[1:26:38] shall come unto the king and to the
[1:26:40] inner court
[1:26:41] who is not called there is one law
[1:26:44] of his to put him to death except such
[1:26:46] to whom the king shall
[1:26:48] hold out the golden scepter that he may
[1:26:50] live
[1:26:51] but i have not been called to come in
[1:26:54] unto the king these thirty days
[1:26:56] and they told to mordecai esther's words
[1:26:58] then mordecai commanded to
[1:27:00] answer esther think not with thyself
[1:27:02] that thou shalt escape in the king's
[1:27:04] house more than all the jews
[1:27:06] for thou altogether holdest thy peace at
[1:27:08] this time then shall their enlargement
[1:27:10] and deliverance arise to the jews from
[1:27:12] another place
[1:27:14] but thou and thy father's house shall be
[1:27:15] destroyed and who knoweth
[1:27:17] whether there are come to the kingdom
[1:27:19] for such a time as this
[1:27:20] then esther bade them return mordecai
[1:27:23] this answer
[1:27:24] go gather together all the jews that are
[1:27:27] present in shushan and fast
[1:27:28] ye for me and neither yet
[1:27:32] neither eat nor drink three days night
[1:27:34] or day
[1:27:35] i also and my maidens will fast likewise
[1:27:38] and so will i go in unto the king
[1:27:40] which is not according to the law and if
[1:27:42] i perish
[1:27:44] i perish
[1:27:47] praise god so mordecai went his way
[1:27:51] and did according to all that esther had
[1:27:53] commanded him
[1:27:54] now he comes to her and says you're the
[1:27:56] queen amen you've got to go unto the
[1:27:59] king
[1:27:59] and you've got to make supplication for
[1:28:01] your people and she says no
[1:28:03] but we reverence the king there's an
[1:28:05] approach to the king
[1:28:07] and she knows she's not just going to
[1:28:08] barge in there and start making demands
[1:28:10] and throw her weight around
[1:28:12] she's not that kind of a queen amen but
[1:28:14] she comes she starts to humble herself
[1:28:16] when she's going to go to the king and
[1:28:18] then she starts to humble herself and
[1:28:20] she declares a fast amen
[1:28:22] and then the fast for three days and she
[1:28:24] the queen humbles herself under this
[1:28:26] fast
[1:28:27] to go in unto the king and then we see
[1:28:29] this approach here in
[1:28:30] esther chapter five verse one now it
[1:28:33] came to pass on the third day that
[1:28:35] esther put on a royal apparel and stood
[1:28:37] in the inner court of the king's house
[1:28:39] over against the king's house and the
[1:28:40] king sat upon his royal throne
[1:28:42] in the royal house over against the gate
[1:28:44] of the house
[1:28:46] and it was so when the king saw esther
[1:28:48] the queen standing in the court
[1:28:49] that she obtained favor in his sight and
[1:28:52] the king
[1:28:52] held out to esther the golden scepter
[1:28:55] that was in his hands so esther drew
[1:28:57] near and touched the top of the scepter
[1:28:59] then said the king unto her what will
[1:29:01] thou queen esther
[1:29:03] and what is thy request it shall be
[1:29:05] given thee to
[1:29:06] half of the kingdom my goodness
[1:29:10] look at her approach and look at her
[1:29:13] reward
[1:29:16] what is it she comes before him humbly
[1:29:19] she stands there
[1:29:20] when he sees her that she's come to him
[1:29:22] he holds out the golden scepter
[1:29:24] for her acceptance she come she touches
[1:29:26] he said what is it
[1:29:27] that you want up to half of the kingdom
[1:29:30] oh my goodness if esther was a different
[1:29:32] kind of person
[1:29:33] what kind of advantage would she have
[1:29:35] taken of that word right there
[1:29:38] but esther had the right nature amen she
[1:29:41] could be granted
[1:29:42] such a statement but she wouldn't use it
[1:29:44] for personal gain
[1:29:46] she wouldn't use it to exalt herself but
[1:29:48] she's not here for herself
[1:29:50] she's here for her people so now the
[1:29:53] king
[1:29:54] and look at the delight of the king the
[1:29:56] king is delighted that she came
[1:29:58] vashti would not come at a request here
[1:30:01] comes
[1:30:01] esther without a request approaching to
[1:30:03] the king
[1:30:05] and guess what the king liked it
[1:30:09] he said what is it that you want
[1:30:13] up to half of the kingdom
[1:30:17] and answer and esther answered if it
[1:30:19] seemed good unto the king
[1:30:21] let the king and haman come this day
[1:30:23] into the banquet that i have prepared
[1:30:25] for him now
[1:30:28] as we go along in this dialogue i want
[1:30:30] you just to to catch some things
[1:30:35] esther's approach to the king is always
[1:30:38] if it seemed good to the king if it be
[1:30:41] pleasing to the king
[1:30:43] if the king be pleased see
[1:30:46] esther's approach is not demanding
[1:30:50] i'm the queen i have rights but her
[1:30:53] approach to the king is always
[1:30:55] if it's pleasing to you if it seemed
[1:30:59] good in your sight
[1:31:00] you know this was jesus approach to his
[1:31:03] father
[1:31:04] when he comes to gethsemane and he's
[1:31:07] pouring his heart out
[1:31:08] and he's in agony over what's coming and
[1:31:10] he was sweating as it were great drops
[1:31:12] of blood
[1:31:13] he said if it be thy will
[1:31:16] let this cup pass from me but if not
[1:31:19] nevertheless thy will be done
[1:31:22] he's not as a son making demands and
[1:31:24] he's not
[1:31:25] amen throwing his position out there
[1:31:27] he's saying god
[1:31:29] i don't jesus is saying can this cup
[1:31:32] pass he's saying i
[1:31:33] i myself as a man don't want to go
[1:31:35] through this i'm in agony over this but
[1:31:37] he says
[1:31:38] if thy will can this cup pass from me
[1:31:42] he's not saying god stop this and take
[1:31:44] this away and you said and
[1:31:50] it's like david when david's walking
[1:31:52] amen he's walking out of
[1:31:54] israel amen and there's a man cursing
[1:31:56] him and throwing rocks and spitting
[1:31:58] at him and amen and one of his soldiers
[1:32:00] want to say i'll cut the head off of
[1:32:02] that dog
[1:32:02] that spits on my king and david said
[1:32:06] leave him alone maybe the lord told him
[1:32:08] to do that
[1:32:09] and brother brennan picks up the same
[1:32:11] story over a tax collector
[1:32:13] and then he's having a hard time with
[1:32:14] this tax case and then he's there in his
[1:32:16] home and
[1:32:17] and there's a question about whether he
[1:32:19] should go back to arizona or not
[1:32:20] and somebody says spouts off and says
[1:32:23] something about that oh
[1:32:24] all that tax collector i wish he would
[1:32:26] and brother bran said leave him alone
[1:32:28] maybe the lord told him to do that
[1:32:32] see such a humility friends
[1:32:35] such a respect for god in god's way
[1:32:38] amen that he wouldn't even let somebody
[1:32:40] rail against a tax collector that was
[1:32:42] causing him problems
[1:32:44] i mean even when when michael was
[1:32:47] disputing
[1:32:48] michael the archangel was disputing over
[1:32:50] the body of moses
[1:32:51] with the devil he said the lord rebuked
[1:32:53] thee
[1:32:55] he wouldn't even the bible said he
[1:32:57] wouldn't even bring a railing accusation
[1:32:59] against
[1:32:59] him amen and
[1:33:03] sometimes we we can find ourselves
[1:33:06] saying things that are so harsh
[1:33:08] we speak about government officials
[1:33:11] in such wicked evil ways but who put
[1:33:14] them there
[1:33:16] whose plan is it who picks your leader
[1:33:21] amen god raises kings god lowers king
[1:33:24] amen you never see daniel act that way
[1:33:28] is that right there's such the
[1:33:32] this this esther has such an approach
[1:33:35] jesus christ had such an approach
[1:33:37] brother branham had such an approach
[1:33:38] amen amen even when brother benham
[1:33:40] disagreed with the politics and the
[1:33:42] stance
[1:33:43] of jfk he disagreed amen that that we
[1:33:45] should even elect the catholic president
[1:33:47] disagreed on his policy
[1:33:49] remember when he shot down he had the
[1:33:50] people stand up and pray
[1:33:52] for his wife and for his children he
[1:33:55] said he's our president and he deserves
[1:33:57] respects
[1:33:59] is that what the prophet says
[1:34:02] why because when you understand that god
[1:34:05] ordains everything around you
[1:34:06] amen we find ourselves fighting god
[1:34:09] sometimes
[1:34:09] amen but jesus was saying if it be thy
[1:34:11] will amen esther is saying if it be
[1:34:13] pleasing to you
[1:34:14] if it's good in your eyes amen there's
[1:34:16] got to be a certain submission
[1:34:18] and the bride says god whatever you want
[1:34:20] from me i'm happy with
[1:34:21] whoever you choose i'm happy with these
[1:34:23] things aren't good they're not supposed
[1:34:25] to be good they're not going in the
[1:34:26] right direction amen
[1:34:28] but god has ordained it to be so and the
[1:34:30] bride says
[1:34:31] be it so because my king my lord is
[1:34:35] decreed it that way and whatever he does
[1:34:37] is good
[1:34:43] amen let's look at chapter 7.
[1:34:49] they come they come to the
[1:34:52] feast esther's banquet
[1:34:57] chapter 7 verse 1 it says so the king
[1:35:00] and haman came to the banquet with
[1:35:02] esther the queen
[1:35:03] and the king said again unto esther on
[1:35:05] the second day at the banquet of wine
[1:35:07] what is thy petition queen esther and it
[1:35:10] shall be granted thee
[1:35:11] and what is thy request and it shall be
[1:35:13] performed even to half of the kingdom
[1:35:16] here she gets a second opportunity at
[1:35:18] half the kingdom
[1:35:20] but one thing we realize about esther is
[1:35:22] esther wasn't in it for herself
[1:35:24] esther was selfless
[1:35:28] then esther the queen answered and said
[1:35:30] if i have found favor in thy side old
[1:35:32] king
[1:35:33] and if it please the king let my life be
[1:35:37] given me at
[1:35:38] my petition in my people at my request
[1:35:42] for we are sold and i am my people to be
[1:35:44] destroyed to be slain and to perish
[1:35:46] but if we had been sold for bond men and
[1:35:48] bond woman i had held my tongue although
[1:35:49] the enemy could not countervail
[1:35:51] the king's damage then king azares
[1:35:54] answered and said unto esther the queen
[1:35:56] who is he and where is he that durst
[1:35:58] presume in this heart
[1:35:59] to do so and esther said the adversary
[1:36:02] the enemy is this wicked haman
[1:36:04] then haman was afraid before the king
[1:36:07] and the queen see
[1:36:10] esther if you watch esther's nature
[1:36:14] esther never has to get outside her
[1:36:17] nature
[1:36:18] to get the attention of the king she
[1:36:20] does it respectfully
[1:36:22] with honor and in submission
[1:36:25] and then the king asks her what do you
[1:36:27] want
[1:36:28] and then she begins to share and she
[1:36:30] says if it please the king
[1:36:32] if it be good in thy sight would you
[1:36:33] give me my life we're talking about
[1:36:35] something serious somebody's threatening
[1:36:37] the life of the queen
[1:36:38] you would think she could just storm
[1:36:39] right in stomp in and start making
[1:36:41] demands and you know who i am
[1:36:43] and but she doesn't do it that way
[1:36:46] she stays gentle submissive this is what
[1:36:49] was pleasing to the king
[1:36:51] chapter 8 verse 1
[1:36:57] they send off haman haman hangs on the
[1:36:59] gallows that he built for mordecai
[1:37:01] but it says on that day did the king
[1:37:02] azares give the house of haman the jews
[1:37:05] enemy and to esther the queen
[1:37:07] and mordecai came before the king for
[1:37:09] esther had told what he was unto her
[1:37:11] and the king took off his ring which he
[1:37:13] had taken from haman and gave it unto
[1:37:15] mordecai and esther
[1:37:16] set mordecai over the house of haman and
[1:37:19] esther spake yet again before the king
[1:37:21] and fell
[1:37:22] down at his feet and besought him with
[1:37:24] tears to put away the mischief of haman
[1:37:26] the agagite
[1:37:27] in his device that he had devised
[1:37:29] against the jews then the king held out
[1:37:31] the golden scepter toward esther
[1:37:33] so esther arose and stood before the
[1:37:35] king and said if it pleased the king and
[1:37:37] if i have found favor in thy sight
[1:37:39] and the things seem right before the
[1:37:41] king and i be pleasing in his eyes
[1:37:43] let it be written to reverse the letters
[1:37:46] devised by haman the son of hemadetha
[1:37:49] the agagite which he wrote to destroy
[1:37:51] the jews which are in all the king's
[1:37:52] provinces
[1:37:54] for how can i endure to see the evil
[1:37:56] that shall come unto my people
[1:37:58] or how can i endure to see the
[1:37:59] destruction of my kindred
[1:38:01] then the king azares said unto esther
[1:38:03] the queen and the mordecai the jew
[1:38:04] behold
[1:38:05] i have given esther the house of haman
[1:38:07] and him that have they have hanged upon
[1:38:09] the gallows because he laid his hand
[1:38:10] upon the jews
[1:38:12] right ye also for the jews as it liketh
[1:38:14] you in the king's name and seal it with
[1:38:16] the king's ring
[1:38:17] for the writing which is written in the
[1:38:19] king's name and the ceiling with the
[1:38:21] king's ring may no man
[1:38:23] reverse she was
[1:38:26] of such a nature that the king could
[1:38:29] tell
[1:38:30] esther now whatsoever you say
[1:38:35] see she didn't take it on herself amen
[1:38:38] she waited for when the king she comes
[1:38:40] to the king if it be pleasing to you
[1:38:42] okay
[1:38:42] if it be good in your side if i found
[1:38:45] grace in your sight of pleasure in your
[1:38:46] sight
[1:38:47] you take pleasure in me can you reverse
[1:38:49] this and he says
[1:38:51] mordecai has the ring you write it you
[1:38:53] you guys write it and you write it in my
[1:38:56] name
[1:38:58] see how different this is to jezebel
[1:39:00] jezebel when she found out that
[1:39:02] ahab comes in pouting because he can't
[1:39:04] have nabat's vineyard amen he says
[1:39:06] do you not rule over israel or do you
[1:39:09] not rule over israel she says i will
[1:39:12] give you naba's vineyard
[1:39:14] i will give you nabal's vineyard and she
[1:39:17] took
[1:39:17] and wrote letters and sealed it the
[1:39:19] king's seal with the king's name
[1:39:21] amen without even permission of the king
[1:39:23] she took it upon herself
[1:39:24] to take the king's name in her own way
[1:39:27] saying i will
[1:39:28] i will i will and it's the very nature
[1:39:30] of lucifer being expressed
[1:39:34] but esther comes completely different
[1:39:36] than jezebel
[1:39:37] esther comes if it be pleasing to you if
[1:39:39] it is good in your sight
[1:39:40] if i found favor in your sight
[1:39:43] and the king says you can say it in my
[1:39:47] name
[1:39:49] and whatever you say will be backed up
[1:39:51] by my seal
[1:39:52] amen not because she was arrogant not
[1:39:54] because she said i'm the king
[1:39:55] but because she approached the king the
[1:39:57] right way the king found
[1:39:59] somebody that he could trust and say now
[1:40:02] you say in the way you say and right you
[1:40:04] have a right to use
[1:40:06] my name and in this day he's looking for
[1:40:09] a bride that'll stay
[1:40:10] bride amen stay submissive to his word
[1:40:13] stay humble
[1:40:14] stay reverent stay in respect so he can
[1:40:16] say
[1:40:17] whatever you say did he have that with
[1:40:21] the prophet
[1:40:24] he gave the power of the spoken word to
[1:40:27] his prophet
[1:40:28] amen and when he gave that power to
[1:40:30] moses he told moses call for fleece call
[1:40:32] for flies call for this
[1:40:33] and moses would go out and say what god
[1:40:35] said and it will come to pass
[1:40:36] but when it come to the prophet of this
[1:40:38] age he would say
[1:40:40] whatever you say
[1:40:43] what did he find what was in that man
[1:40:45] there was a man that was completely
[1:40:47] submissive to god
[1:40:48] there was a man who didn't take his own
[1:40:50] way he had been tried and he had been
[1:40:52] tested he would humble himself to god
[1:40:54] before the people
[1:40:56] he would correct his wrongs he would
[1:40:57] stay in line with the word
[1:40:59] he would he would he would he would want
[1:41:01] god's will over everything else and god
[1:41:02] would say you say
[1:41:08] see god loves
[1:41:12] that kind of nature
[1:41:16] he hates the one that grabs and takes
[1:41:18] and says and
[1:41:19] declares
[1:41:22] he loves the one that will come to him
[1:41:25] humble themselves and trust in him and
[1:41:28] believe in him
[1:41:29] and want to please him somebody asked
[1:41:32] brother branham they were asking about
[1:41:33] the spoken word and say
[1:41:35] now that you've demonstrated the spoken
[1:41:36] word you could speak somebody and they
[1:41:38] can be
[1:41:39] totally saved and in a raptured
[1:41:40] condition something along those lines
[1:41:43] and go to heaven are going the rapture
[1:41:45] and brother branham says
[1:41:47] yes that's true because the power of the
[1:41:50] spoken word is the power of the spoken
[1:41:51] word
[1:41:53] he said yes he said but see all those
[1:41:56] were given
[1:41:57] by permission the prophet
[1:42:01] didn't take his position and just say
[1:42:03] this and say that and say this
[1:42:04] it was all by permission
[1:42:08] we even talked last sunday about him
[1:42:10] standing on the platform
[1:42:12] and the message the deepest calling to
[1:42:13] the deep standing there and
[1:42:15] him hauling around i don't say that
[1:42:16] disrespectfully but that's what he was
[1:42:18] doing he was
[1:42:19] he was having this discussion and that
[1:42:21] discussion he's standing he's got people
[1:42:23] lined up
[1:42:24] he's got thousands in the crowd i mean
[1:42:25] he's under pressure but he's sitting
[1:42:27] there waiting and he's talking and he
[1:42:28] said we got this lined up and he's
[1:42:30] telling a testimony
[1:42:31] and then all of a sudden he says now you
[1:42:33] know i'm waiting for something
[1:42:38] look at the humility friends look at the
[1:42:41] subjection
[1:42:42] unto god look at the surrender the the
[1:42:44] submission
[1:42:45] god this is what god loves friends
[1:42:49] you never you don't see the prophet of
[1:42:51] god taking his position
[1:42:53] i mean he he's not even demanding that
[1:42:56] people show him respect
[1:43:00] should you show him respect yes but he's
[1:43:02] not even demanding it because of his
[1:43:03] position
[1:43:06] he's giving all glory and honor to god
[1:43:11] he's humble he's submissive
[1:43:14] he's been tested and he's proved himself
[1:43:16] humbled to god he gives all credit to
[1:43:18] god
[1:43:19] he stays with the word of god at all
[1:43:21] costs and god can say unto him
[1:43:23] now you say the king
[1:43:27] as theirs can say unto esther you i've
[1:43:29] given the i've given the seal
[1:43:31] i've given the signet my ring amen to
[1:43:33] mordecai whatever
[1:43:34] you guys write write it and seal it in
[1:43:36] my name
[1:43:38] he didn't ask to inspect it first
[1:43:42] he didn't want to proofread it why he
[1:43:44] had already
[1:43:45] seen the character that was so different
[1:43:47] than the character of vashti
[1:43:49] this was a character he could trust in
[1:43:55] i want him to find that character in me
[1:43:59] we believe in the manifestation of the
[1:44:02] spoken word
[1:44:03] we believe in a short quick where we
[1:44:05] believe in all of that
[1:44:06] amen but i wonder if now is not the time
[1:44:09] of character
[1:44:12] proving and testing our character amen
[1:44:16] remember esther brought deliverance
[1:44:18] listen esther brought down haman
[1:44:21] the second most powerful person in the
[1:44:23] kingdom
[1:44:24] brought him to ruin amen and all those
[1:44:27] that agreed with him were brought to
[1:44:29] ruin
[1:44:29] and his ten sons were killed and hung on
[1:44:31] the gallows we'll get to that in a
[1:44:33] minute
[1:44:33] amen and all because of esther but
[1:44:36] not in her mind and not in her power and
[1:44:39] not in her taking a a position that
[1:44:41] wasn't hers
[1:44:42] but esther brought the destruction of
[1:44:44] the nemesis of the jews
[1:44:45] brought the destruction of all those
[1:44:47] that would harm the jews and brought
[1:44:48] deliverance for the nation
[1:44:50] by what by staying submissive as a
[1:44:53] as a humble submissive queen
[1:44:58] see the bride in this day we don't have
[1:45:00] to get bold and brash and
[1:45:02] burly and boastful and we don't have to
[1:45:04] be like other churches and we don't have
[1:45:06] to be
[1:45:06] like a queen who wants our own feasts
[1:45:08] and refuses the king this
[1:45:09] bride can stay submissive and humble and
[1:45:12] reverent amen and sweet and kind
[1:45:16] and what is she going to do she's going
[1:45:17] to bring down haman's kingdom and all
[1:45:19] that agree with him
[1:45:21] and bring deliverance to all god's
[1:45:23] people amen and then by her submission
[1:45:26] bring a resurrection out of the dead
[1:45:28] amen and there's going to be a rapture
[1:45:30] by the plan of god
[1:45:31] how because he's going to have a bride
[1:45:33] who's not going to act like vashti but
[1:45:35] he's going to have one who acts like
[1:45:38] [Music]
[1:45:42] esther
[1:45:44] praise god
[1:45:48] you can be called queen so long you
[1:45:51] start to forget how you became
[1:45:52] queen you lose sight of
[1:45:56] who made you clean and how you're
[1:45:59] sustained as queen
[1:46:02] you're queen by the choice of god you've
[1:46:04] come into union with christ by the new
[1:46:06] birth
[1:46:07] by something he did for you by his
[1:46:09] foreign nation his choosing his election
[1:46:11] and you remain there by him
[1:46:14] vashti forgot that esther never did
[1:46:19] let's look at chapter 9 this is the last
[1:46:21] portion i want to read here in the book
[1:46:22] of esther
[1:46:24] esther chapter 9.
[1:46:29] we'll read it at verse 12 that they sent
[1:46:31] out a decree esther and mordecai for all
[1:46:33] the jews did to be able to defend
[1:46:34] themselves
[1:46:36] the word comes back
[1:46:40] to the king and verse 12 says and the
[1:46:42] king said unto esther the queen
[1:46:44] the jews have slain and destroyed 500
[1:46:46] men in shushan
[1:46:47] the palace and the ten sons of haman
[1:46:51] what have they done what have they done
[1:46:53] in the rest of the king's provinces
[1:46:55] now what is thy petition and it shall be
[1:46:57] granted thee
[1:46:58] or what is thy request further and it
[1:47:00] shall be done
[1:47:02] then said esther if it pleased the king
[1:47:04] let it be granted to the jews
[1:47:06] which are in shushan to do tomorrow also
[1:47:08] according unto this day's decree
[1:47:10] and let haman's ten sons be hanged upon
[1:47:13] the gallows
[1:47:14] and the king commanded it so to be done
[1:47:16] and the decree was given at shushan
[1:47:18] and they hanged haman's ten sons
[1:47:22] listen we've come to judgment
[1:47:25] we've come now to a time of judgment and
[1:47:27] the king and the queen are together
[1:47:29] and there's a judgment taking place in
[1:47:31] shushan and and there's
[1:47:33] there's all these that are killed and
[1:47:34] the ten sons of haman are killed
[1:47:36] and after they're killed amen they they
[1:47:39] the king says unto the queen
[1:47:41] what else is your petition what else
[1:47:45] do you want she says if it pleased the
[1:47:48] king
[1:47:50] if it pleased the king she always says
[1:47:55] if it pleased the king
[1:47:59] you know in the book of james james
[1:48:01] admonishes this says don't say
[1:48:03] tomorrow i'll travel to this city and
[1:48:05] live there a year and make such and such
[1:48:07] he said don't do that say if the lord
[1:48:09] wills i will
[1:48:14] now you can take that to extreme and
[1:48:15] make a law and you can tell your wife
[1:48:17] hey i'm going to go get gas if the lord
[1:48:18] wills
[1:48:20] no just go get gas it's an
[1:48:23] attitude it's the approach
[1:48:27] say i will go to a city i will be there
[1:48:30] a year
[1:48:30] i will earn such and such that's all
[1:48:32] wrong
[1:48:33] that attitude is wrong not like if you
[1:48:36] tell somebody oh yeah
[1:48:38] i'm planning on going to visit my mom
[1:48:39] we're going to go over to this state
[1:48:40] we're going to be there a week we'll be
[1:48:41] back
[1:48:44] what he's saying is your attitude should
[1:48:45] be if that pleases the lord
[1:48:48] if that's the lord's will whatever we do
[1:48:51] whatever we say we want it to please the
[1:48:53] lord
[1:48:54] he's telling us don't even make plans as
[1:48:56] as if you're in control and as you get
[1:48:59] to decide
[1:49:00] he said make your plans as if it's the
[1:49:01] will of the lord we'll go and do this
[1:49:03] and go and do that because tomorrow you
[1:49:04] have no guarantee of and you don't know
[1:49:06] what's going to happen
[1:49:08] and so esther has been given this this
[1:49:10] opportunity to speak
[1:49:12] he says now what do you want and she
[1:49:14] says if it please
[1:49:15] the king let them do today
[1:49:19] as they did yesterday and hang the ten
[1:49:22] sons of hammond
[1:49:23] amen you realize
[1:49:27] this is she's judging the dead
[1:49:30] because these ten sons were already
[1:49:32] killed
[1:49:33] and we know there's a time amen that
[1:49:36] that the bride will sit
[1:49:37] the white throne judgment and she'll
[1:49:38] judge the dead amen when those ten
[1:49:40] sons were hanged it was a second death
[1:49:45] and you are going to sit with the king
[1:49:48] the bride will sit
[1:49:49] king and queen will sit together at the
[1:49:50] white throne judgment judging this world
[1:49:52] according to the scriptures
[1:49:54] but look at how it was done when esther
[1:49:56] was given the right to judge
[1:49:57] he said what do you want now he turns to
[1:49:59] her and what do you say
[1:50:01] she didn't just spout off she didn't
[1:50:03] just say she didn't come with their own
[1:50:04] plans when the lord told her to judge
[1:50:06] she judged and when she judged he said
[1:50:08] if it pleased the lord
[1:50:10] see all of these things are true she was
[1:50:13] the queen
[1:50:14] she was given the right she was allowed
[1:50:16] to use the king's name
[1:50:17] she had all of these rights and all
[1:50:19] these privileges she defeated her enemy
[1:50:21] she delivered amen she delivered the
[1:50:24] kingdom of the jews she delivered she
[1:50:26] saved she did
[1:50:27] and how does she do it she did it
[1:50:29] through submission to her headship
[1:50:30] she did it with humility and honor to
[1:50:32] the king and always with if it please
[1:50:34] you if it'd be pleasing to you if it's
[1:50:36] good in your sight
[1:50:38] and when it comes to the end what did
[1:50:40] esther really do
[1:50:43] what sword did she wield who did she
[1:50:47] take captive she didn't do anything
[1:50:51] the king did it all when we get to the
[1:50:54] end of this journey
[1:50:56] god is going to use his bride in the end
[1:50:57] time to finish his works
[1:51:00] she knows that it has to be him and her
[1:51:02] doing the work
[1:51:04] he's going to complete now all that he
[1:51:06] left amen he didn't fulfill all of his
[1:51:08] work but he would now complete his work
[1:51:10] in and through the bride and she knows
[1:51:12] that it has to be him doing the work
[1:51:14] when it comes to the end of it what is
[1:51:16] it that we've done anyways
[1:51:18] we've done nothing it was all him all we
[1:51:21] did was surrender and submit
[1:51:22] and let him be god
[1:51:27] god doesn't need our power
[1:51:31] god doesn't need our intellect god
[1:51:32] doesn't need our beauty
[1:51:34] god doesn't need our money what god
[1:51:36] needs is our humble submission
[1:51:38] and he needs us to play the right part
[1:51:41] as the bride
[1:51:48] i want to read a quote as we wrap up
[1:51:53] two quotes i want to read the first one
[1:51:56] is a humble thyself from july 14th 1963.
[1:52:00] though i understand all the mysteries of
[1:52:02] god see and still though i could do it
[1:52:04] and have not charity i am nothing
[1:52:06] see i got nowhere yet see the main thing
[1:52:08] is love god
[1:52:09] and humble yourself with it now surely
[1:52:13] after all these years on the field and
[1:52:14] around the world and
[1:52:16] seeing different people i ought to know
[1:52:17] a little bit about the gate to enter in
[1:52:19] that
[1:52:20] and if you want to get somewhere with
[1:52:21] god never let an arrogant spirit ever
[1:52:23] come around you
[1:52:26] don't let no malice come in no matter
[1:52:28] what anybody does if they're wrong don't
[1:52:30] you never build up a complex against
[1:52:32] that person see
[1:52:33] you be sweet and kind remember god loved
[1:52:35] you when you were in sin
[1:52:37] and if the spirit of god is in you you
[1:52:39] love the other person when he's in the
[1:52:40] wrong
[1:52:41] just pray for them and love one another
[1:52:43] above everything love
[1:52:44] god and love one another and be humble
[1:52:46] with god and around one another
[1:52:49] and god will bless us it's hard telling
[1:52:52] what he'll do
[1:52:53] usually when a church begins to get in
[1:52:54] numbers and get to getting a little
[1:52:56] bigger or something like that
[1:52:57] they get away from the real thing the
[1:53:00] real thing
[1:53:02] brother i said i've been around the
[1:53:03] world i ought to know the approach
[1:53:06] he said don't never let an arrogant
[1:53:07] spirit come around you
[1:53:09] you stay humble with god and humble with
[1:53:11] one another and see what god will do for
[1:53:13] you
[1:53:14] and i say lord let me have the approach
[1:53:18] of esther
[1:53:20] root out jezebel root out vashti root
[1:53:23] out
[1:53:24] all these other queens but give me the
[1:53:26] nature
[1:53:27] of esther let me approach the way esther
[1:53:31] approached let me
[1:53:32] let me petition you the way esther
[1:53:34] petitioned you
[1:53:35] amen let me let me know your love for me
[1:53:38] and let me come lord to you
[1:53:40] trusting that you'll do for me and in
[1:53:42] the end of it all i can say is i didn't
[1:53:45] do anything
[1:53:45] and then at the end we'll be able to
[1:53:47] have the same testimony brother branham
[1:53:49] had
[1:53:49] he goes i wasn't the one that did those
[1:53:51] things i was just standing near when he
[1:53:52] did them
[1:53:55] i wasn't the one who come down the river
[1:53:57] i wasn't one who said that i'm not the
[1:53:59] one who opened blind and i
[1:54:00] i'm not the one who've done all these
[1:54:01] things he's the one who'd done it and
[1:54:03] jesus christ said the same thing he said
[1:54:06] i'm not the one who did it it's the
[1:54:07] father who dwelleth in me
[1:54:10] and brother branham coming he said it's
[1:54:12] not me amen it's him
[1:54:14] i'm not the one it's him it's not the
[1:54:16] seventh angel it's christ
[1:54:18] it's not me and when the bride
[1:54:22] comes to the end of the road she's going
[1:54:23] to say the same thing
[1:54:25] it wasn't me i was just standing there
[1:54:27] when he did it it wasn't what i did
[1:54:29] it's what i surrendered myself to it
[1:54:31] wasn't my power it was my submission
[1:54:34] it wasn't my strength it was my yielding
[1:54:36] amen it wasn't my
[1:54:37] my intellect it was my obedience
[1:54:42] what god looking for he's looking for
[1:54:44] something he's never
[1:54:45] had before
[1:54:48] a church that'll hum themselves and
[1:54:51] submit to all of his word
[1:54:54] he doesn't need your power he's got
[1:54:56] plenty
[1:54:58] he doesn't need your money he doesn't
[1:55:00] need your good looks
[1:55:02] he doesn't need he does all he's looking
[1:55:05] for is what he's never
[1:55:07] had before a people that will humble
[1:55:10] themselves
[1:55:11] and give him complete submission and
[1:55:13] make him first place in everything
[1:55:16] and if he can find that kind of bride
[1:55:19] it's
[1:55:19] limitless what can be done
[1:55:23] deliverance will come but not if we
[1:55:26] change our role
[1:55:28] deliverance will come if we stay the way
[1:55:31] he's made us
[1:55:32] and express jesus christ
[1:55:36] in the formation of the bride
[1:55:40] one more quote out of christ is the
[1:55:42] mystery of god revealed
[1:55:45] he says never he's talking here and
[1:55:49] picking up mid-sentence never able to
[1:55:50] come to the knowledge of the truth
[1:55:52] and these men resisted as janice and
[1:55:54] jamberry's generous and janice withstood
[1:55:56] moses able to produce a church and
[1:55:58] produce a group of people yes sir
[1:56:00] but their folly will be made manifest
[1:56:02] when jesus takes his bride
[1:56:04] and sets her up here and said this is
[1:56:06] her
[1:56:07] and the way he goes with her
[1:56:11] what's he going to do he's going to
[1:56:14] exalt his bride
[1:56:16] he's going to take her and all the other
[1:56:19] janice and jammers all the other gifts
[1:56:20] and all the other
[1:56:22] movements amen they'll show their folly
[1:56:24] when he takes his bride
[1:56:25] and he lifts her up here and says this
[1:56:27] is her and the way he goes for her
[1:56:29] she will not exalt herself she will
[1:56:32] humber herself
[1:56:33] but if you humble yourself in due time
[1:56:35] you'll be exalted
[1:56:36] when jesus christ himself picks up his
[1:56:38] bride and says
[1:56:39] this is her and then away he goes with
[1:56:43] her
[1:56:45] how do i get there how do i get to that
[1:56:49] exalted place
[1:56:50] how do i get to the place where he picks
[1:56:53] me up and says this is her the way he
[1:56:54] goes with her i tell you the way
[1:56:56] up is down the way to get to there
[1:56:59] amen is is the the to submit
[1:57:02] to humble to reverence to respect our
[1:57:06] headship which is christ
[1:57:08] which is the word and give him all
[1:57:10] reverence
[1:57:11] and all respect and give him first place
[1:57:15] and if we can be submissive and humble
[1:57:18] and sweet
[1:57:20] and be the bride that he's looking for
[1:57:21] in this day
[1:57:23] in due season he'll take us and put us
[1:57:26] up here
[1:57:27] and say this is her and away he goes
[1:57:31] with her
[1:57:32] i say god let me be that kind of bride
[1:57:37] let's all stand
[1:57:41] musicians if you'll come please
[1:57:47] i'd like to say this last statement i've
[1:57:49] said it several times through this
[1:57:52] but when a woman gets out of position
[1:57:54] she brings death
[1:57:57] but when a woman stays in position she
[1:57:59] brings life
[1:58:01] and this bride will stay in her position
[1:58:06] because she's predestinated to there
[1:58:08] will be a people and there is a people
[1:58:10] on this earth
[1:58:11] that doesn't want her own way that
[1:58:13] doesn't want to be anything special of
[1:58:15] any special title
[1:58:16] she's only what she is by the
[1:58:18] commandment of god
[1:58:20] she's only what she is by the will of
[1:58:22] god she's only done what she's done by
[1:58:24] the strength of god and the provision of
[1:58:25] god
[1:58:26] and she gives him all the credit for and
[1:58:28] she says it wasn't me
[1:58:30] it was him and even the queen
[1:58:34] bows before the king because it was all
[1:58:36] him
[1:58:38] let's bow our heads and pray
[1:58:41] lord jesus we ask that you would bless
[1:58:43] us lord
[1:58:44] as we hear this word lord we want to
[1:58:46] become this word
[1:58:48] lord you've called us in this day to
[1:58:50] express this very nature
[1:58:52] and god it has to be you and us we're
[1:58:55] just asking lord that you would
[1:58:57] help us to remain humble and submissive
[1:58:59] to you
[1:59:00] god that we would be a people unlike any
[1:59:03] that's ever been here before lord
[1:59:04] because
[1:59:05] every other church lord they they got
[1:59:08] exalted in their own eyes and they went
[1:59:10] their own way
[1:59:11] but you promised there would be one in
[1:59:13] the end time
[1:59:14] that would not fail you promised there
[1:59:17] would be one just like you restored the
[1:59:19] last adam you promised there would be a
[1:59:21] woman that would be here
[1:59:23] that it would be you and her expressing
[1:59:26] yourself in the formation of the bride
[1:59:29] you said it would be here we believe it
[1:59:31] we accept it
[1:59:33] lord we reverence you we respect your
[1:59:35] lord and we come humbly before you
[1:59:38] we say lord make us make us what you've
[1:59:41] called us to be in this hour purge out
[1:59:44] all the wrong thinking if there's any
[1:59:46] vanity and any pride
[1:59:48] take it out of us lord there's any
[1:59:50] hangover from previous denominations if
[1:59:53] there's any
[1:59:54] lord any self-exaltation lord i pray you
[1:59:57] strip it from us now
[2:00:00] may we have the approach of esther
[2:00:03] oh may you be glorified in our lives may
[2:00:06] you have your way with us
[2:00:09] god your prophet said we can't make
[2:00:11] ourselves little enough
