[5:15] while we have our service here amen god
[5:18] be praised
[5:19] let's look here at revelation chapter 1
[5:22] verse 1
[5:30] the revelation of jesus christ
[5:33] stop i don't want to read any more i
[5:35] want to leave it with that impact well
[5:38] when you look into the book of
[5:40] revelation right in the beginning when
[5:41] you start
[5:42] the declaration of what this is comes
[5:45] right up and hit you right in the face
[5:46] the revelation of jesus christ
[5:50] let's turn over to romans chapter 9.
[5:59] now can you see why the book of
[6:00] revelation is the bride's book
[6:03] the capstone of the bible amen
[6:08] and god kept it hid behind symbols
[6:11] amen so that nobody could interpret they
[6:14] could try
[6:15] but nobody with any authority could
[6:16] accurately interpret amen until a
[6:18] prophet would come along and it was the
[6:20] right prophet at the right season
[6:22] to come and unlock the mysteries so we
[6:24] catch the revelation of jesus christ
[6:28] uh romans chapter 9 verse 30
[6:32] 9 and 30. what shall we say then that
[6:36] the gentiles which follow not after
[6:38] righteousness have attained
[6:40] to righteousness even the righteousness
[6:42] which is of
[6:43] faith but israel which followed after
[6:46] the law of righteousness had not
[6:47] attained to the law of righteousness
[6:49] wherefore because they sought it not by
[6:52] faith but as it were by the works of the
[6:54] law
[6:54] for they stumbled at the stumbling stone
[6:58] as it is written behold i lay in zion a
[7:00] stumbling stone
[7:01] a rock of offense and whosoever
[7:03] believeth on him
[7:05] shall not be ashamed let's just bow our
[7:07] heads and pray
[7:10] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[7:11] jesus for this day
[7:13] we thank you for this opportunity to
[7:15] gather together to worship your name
[7:17] and now as we come lord to the preaching
[7:19] of the word we do so because you told us
[7:22] to we do so because
[7:23] you laid this pattern out lord well but
[7:26] there's no sufficiency in man there's no
[7:28] ability in humans lord
[7:30] so we look beyond that lord and we come
[7:32] according to a promise in your word
[7:33] trusting that you'll speak
[7:35] through human lips well when israel was
[7:38] camped in the wilderness you brought
[7:39] fresh man a day by day
[7:41] they didn't have to labor for it or work
[7:43] for it all they had to do was gather
[7:44] lord and
[7:45] i pray that you would drop fresh manna
[7:47] from heaven now lord that we could
[7:49] gather it
[7:50] and feast on it and enjoy him we love
[7:52] you and we pray you find preeminence in
[7:54] all that we say and do
[7:56] and lord find a welcome in our hearts
[7:58] this morning in jesus christ's name we
[8:00] pray
[8:01] amen you can all be seated
[8:06] as we look here at romans chapter 9
[8:10] if you'll remember when brother branham
[8:12] comes to sirs is this the time
[8:14] uh he's preaching this this he's had
[8:18] a series of six dreams that people have
[8:20] brought to him and those six dreams are
[8:22] all talking in one way or another
[8:23] about him going out west or storing up
[8:26] food or
[8:26] or things like that and and it's capped
[8:29] off by a vision
[8:30] and he and he's get caught up in a
[8:31] constellation of angels and now he knows
[8:33] he's got to leave
[8:34] and go out west to to meet those angels
[8:37] for the revelation of the
[8:39] seven seals and so when brother branham
[8:43] says when he has this vision he said the
[8:45] vision nearly packed me out of the room
[8:47] and he found himself in the corner of
[8:49] the room reading this scripture
[8:51] so this is a significant scripture he's
[8:53] reading as it is written behold i lay in
[8:56] zion a stumbling stone
[8:57] a rock of offense and whosoever believes
[9:00] in him shall not be ashamed
[9:01] and so now he's talking about seeing a
[9:04] constellation of angels
[9:05] getting caught up in the constellation
[9:07] of angels and now he knows he needs to
[9:09] go out west and
[9:10] he's asking could this be that third
[9:12] pool is that them seven unknown thunders
[9:14] is it
[9:15] time for them thunders to be revealed
[9:17] that the seals on the back side of the
[9:19] book the part that
[9:20] not even written in the book and he's
[9:22] asking this question
[9:23] but but supernaturally when he gets
[9:26] caught up in this realm
[9:27] he's beside himself and he comes through
[9:30] and when he comes to
[9:31] he's in the corner of his room with his
[9:33] bible open reading this scripture
[9:36] amen behold i lay in zion a stumbling
[9:38] stone
[9:39] i wonder what's coming amen it's the
[9:41] coming of the stumbling stone
[9:44] what was a cornerstone now coming to be
[9:46] the head of the corner
[9:47] and it's going to be a stumbling stone a
[9:50] rock of
[9:50] offense and
[9:53] whosoever believeth in him shall not be
[9:56] ashamed
[9:58] if you ever believe in him has nothing
[10:00] to worry about has no
[10:01] shame has no iniquity amen has no sin
[10:05] but will be completely purged by what by
[10:07] believing in receiving the stumbling
[10:09] stone
[10:11] let's back up and just read this section
[10:13] again so we can catch context
[10:15] it says what shall we say then that the
[10:17] gentiles
[10:18] which followed not after righteousness
[10:20] hath attained to righteousness
[10:21] even the righteousness was of faith he's
[10:23] showing this principle now the contrast
[10:26] between the jews the old church
[10:27] and the gentiles the old church amen
[10:30] they had received the prophecy
[10:32] they had received the written word but
[10:34] when the living word come
[10:36] they didn't have any faith and couldn't
[10:37] believe in that it became a rock of
[10:40] offense and a stumbling stone to them
[10:42] amen but the gentiles would receive it
[10:44] by faith
[10:45] and now they've received the law of
[10:47] righteousness by faith
[10:49] and those that were striving after
[10:50] righteousness have failed in
[10:52] righteousness
[10:53] because they didn't believe the
[10:54] stumbling stone
[10:56] and now we come to the same place
[10:58] brother brings to the same place
[11:00] at the end of the church ages at the end
[11:02] of the old church they had received
[11:04] prophecy they had received words
[11:05] they had received the bible amen but
[11:07] when the word came
[11:09] manifest in the flesh it became a
[11:11] stumbling stone to them
[11:13] a rock of offense and they stumbled at
[11:16] it
[11:17] amen but there's going to be a gentile
[11:19] bride amen was not going to stumble at
[11:21] the stumbling stone but she would
[11:23] receive it for what it was
[11:25] the seventh seal the coming of the lord
[11:27] the mighty god unveiled
[11:28] the mighty angel descending and to her
[11:31] she doesn't need to be ashamed anymore
[11:33] amen because there's no iniquity there's
[11:35] no now there's nothing but
[11:37] righteousness by what by faith
[11:41] not by works the gentiles received it by
[11:44] righteousness which is of faith
[11:45] but israel which followed after the law
[11:47] of righteousness had not obtained to the
[11:49] law of righteousness
[11:51] they wanted to be right and they were
[11:54] wrong
[11:56] the denominations through the systems
[11:58] have wanted to be right
[12:00] but they become wrong amen what made
[12:02] them go for what they they desired the
[12:04] law of righteousness they desired the
[12:06] word to make them righteous
[12:07] amen but the only way that you can be a
[12:10] righteous is by
[12:11] imputation by faith and so you cannot
[12:14] believe
[12:14] in the word you have to believe the word
[12:18] there's a big difference you cannot
[12:20] believe in god
[12:21] amen devils believe in god but is not
[12:23] believing in god it's believing god
[12:26] not believing in the word but believing
[12:28] the word and whenever the word comes in
[12:30] whatever form the word comes in
[12:32] then we believe that and that's a
[12:35] imputation
[12:36] of righteousness by faith amen why
[12:39] because it always comes as a stumbling
[12:41] stone
[12:42] mecha was a stumbling stone to ahab
[12:46] you know noah and his ark was a
[12:47] stumbling stone to that scientific
[12:49] generation
[12:50] every time the word comes it's a
[12:52] stumbling stone
[12:55] they stumbled at it and wanted
[12:57] righteousness but
[12:58] fell from righteousness they haven't
[12:59] even attained to the law of
[13:00] righteousness because
[13:02] they could not receive the stumbling
[13:05] stone
[13:06] when it was presented to them
[13:11] let's not stumble at the stumbling stone
[13:14] let's turn to matthew 21.
[13:19] if i can today i i want to minister
[13:23] on the stone cut out of the mountain
[13:24] without hands
[13:26] spend a little bit of time on this i'm
[13:29] trying to teach myself to go slow
[13:34] you know how self-reformation works it
[13:36] usually ends in disaster
[13:39] so we're just going to trust god to do
[13:41] whatever he wants to do but i don't want
[13:42] to go so fast and cramps so much in that
[13:45] we leave not knowing
[13:46] where we're at i just want god to just
[13:48] have his way and i want to just relax
[13:49] now relax in his presence and let him
[13:52] have his way
[13:53] matthew 21 42
[13:58] jesus said unto them did did you never
[14:01] read in the scriptures the stone which
[14:03] the builders rejected
[14:04] the same has become the head of the
[14:06] corner this is the lord's doing and is
[14:08] marvelous in our eyes
[14:10] therefore say i unto you the kingdom of
[14:12] god shall be taken from you
[14:14] and given to a nation bringing forth the
[14:16] fruits thereof
[14:18] and whosoever shall fall on this stone
[14:20] shall be broken
[14:21] but on whomsoever it shall fall it will
[14:24] grind him to powder
[14:26] this is interesting
[14:30] portion of scripture that that there's a
[14:32] stone
[14:33] that the builders have rejected that
[14:35] will become the head of the corner
[14:38] as the lord's doing it's marvelous in
[14:39] our eyes and he says
[14:41] now the kingdom of god will be taken
[14:45] from you and given to a nation bringing
[14:47] forth fruits
[14:48] so the kingdom of god is going to be
[14:50] taken away from the jews and given to
[14:53] another nation
[14:54] but we know it was never given to one
[14:56] nation there's no you can't say that it
[14:58] went to the greeks or it went to the
[15:00] romans or it went here
[15:01] amen but but it was taken away the
[15:03] kingdom of god was taken away
[15:05] and it was given into another people and
[15:07] that other people
[15:08] became the kingdom of god
[15:12] and then he says and whosoever shall
[15:13] fall on this stone
[15:15] shall be broken this stone we know a
[15:17] stone is a revelation in the word of god
[15:19] and whoever falls on this stone will be
[15:24] broken
[15:26] but on whomsoever it shall fall it will
[15:28] grind him
[15:30] to powder so we find that no matter who
[15:33] you are
[15:35] no matter what you think you will come
[15:38] in contact with this stone
[15:41] and when you come in contact with this
[15:43] stone it will require
[15:45] it'll bring brokenness and the question
[15:48] is whether it's voluntary or involuntary
[15:51] but you will come in contact with this
[15:53] stone
[15:54] at some point everyone will come in
[15:57] contact with this stone
[15:59] that was rejected that's become the head
[16:01] of the coroner and when you come in
[16:02] contact with that by free will
[16:04] and throw yourself upon the stone you're
[16:07] broken amen
[16:08] broken from wrong ideas broken from a
[16:10] false life
[16:11] broken from hybridization broken from
[16:13] sin amen so that he can put you back
[16:15] together the way that he wants
[16:17] but if you refuse that brokenness at
[16:20] some point
[16:21] that stone that you refused will be the
[16:23] stone that crushes you
[16:25] and grinds you into powder and blows you
[16:27] into the chaff of the wind
[16:29] so there's no option on coming in
[16:32] contact with this stone
[16:34] which is a revelation of the word and
[16:37] this stone
[16:38] you will either be broken on it or you
[16:40] will be broken under it
[16:42] one will be voluntary when you come in
[16:44] contact and are not ashamed and throw
[16:46] yourself down
[16:47] on the revelation of the word for your
[16:49] day or you can reject it amen
[16:52] and you can you can you can stumble at
[16:54] the stumbling stone and reject it
[16:55] but there's going to come a day when you
[16:57] do that that you will be ashamed when
[16:59] you stand before god and that stone will
[17:01] crush you
[17:04] oh praise god i say lord let me fall on
[17:07] that stone
[17:08] fresh every day and be broken from ideas
[17:11] be broken from concepts
[17:12] be broken from intellect be broken from
[17:15] passions be broken from
[17:16] everything that's human amen and be like
[17:18] you
[17:20] let's look at luke 17 together
[17:35] luke 17 and verse 20.
[17:48] and when he was demanded of the
[17:50] pharisees when the kingdom of god should
[17:52] come
[17:52] he answered them and said the kingdom of
[17:54] god cometh not with observation
[17:57] neither shall they say low here or lo
[17:59] there for behold the kingdom of god
[18:01] is within you so now the jews were going
[18:04] to lose the kingdom and it was going to
[18:06] go to another nation
[18:07] but jesus says that the kingdom of god
[18:10] doesn't come with observation you can't
[18:12] say
[18:12] it's over there and it's over there and
[18:14] it's over there for the kingdom of god
[18:16] is within you
[18:17] so now we know where the kingdom of god
[18:19] is the kingdom of god is
[18:21] inside a people on the earth
[18:25] the jews were the oracles of god they
[18:27] were keeping the word of god
[18:29] they were they were they were keeping
[18:31] the light shining
[18:32] of the word of god amen but when the
[18:34] true light came
[18:36] they refused it to keep their artificial
[18:38] light or keep
[18:39] keep the portion of light they refuse
[18:41] the fullness of life
[18:43] amen and now that that kingdom was
[18:45] removed from them
[18:46] and given to another nation that will
[18:48] bring forth fruits thereof
[18:51] and that other nation amen is not a
[18:54] country or a physical location or
[18:56] something with borders that you can
[18:58] measure out
[18:58] because the kingdom of god doesn't come
[19:00] with observation
[19:02] you can't say over there there's a 10
[19:04] mile square
[19:05] there's a continent or there's alright
[19:10] that kingdom now is within you
[19:13] praise god now let's i just want to lay
[19:17] those scriptures down for a foundation
[19:18] and then
[19:19] move forward i want to if we can bring
[19:22] up the powerpoint
[19:24] i want to look at a couple of quotes
[19:27] just as review
[19:28] from where we've been and move on from
[19:29] there so now any bible reader here knows
[19:32] that a scripture has a compound meaning
[19:34] every prophecy
[19:35] some most all of it is a duel a time
[19:37] there or two times or more
[19:39] that'll be answered as a revolving
[19:41] history
[19:43] now as i said last night and we all know
[19:46] that every prophecy is a compound
[19:47] meaning
[19:48] compound it repeats itself
[19:52] praise god and he says and how many
[19:56] knows that scripture is a compound
[19:57] meaning to every prophecy
[19:58] sure does yes sir it'll say it and mean
[20:01] it just exactly to this time
[20:03] and turn right around and repeat it
[20:05] again back over here somewhere
[20:07] so when it's spoken it means like when
[20:09] david was speaking of his condition in
[20:11] the psalms and crying out
[20:12] it was a real condition he was going
[20:14] through right then something that was
[20:15] happening to him
[20:16] but he was also referring to something
[20:18] that would happen amen when christ was
[20:20] in calvary
[20:22] and it had a dual meaning
[20:25] and then he says now this prophecy of
[20:27] course like all other prophecy is a
[20:29] compound meaning
[20:30] a prophecy sometimes has a natural
[20:32] meaning then it has
[20:33] a spiritual meaning so it's interesting
[20:36] that brother branham can come to this
[20:38] and he can begin to show you that
[20:40] there's a there's a revolving history to
[20:42] the word of god
[20:43] we find it repeating itself i mean you
[20:45] find it you know
[20:46] through the old testament many times the
[20:48] cycle repeats
[20:49] over and over again that they they they
[20:52] god rescues them
[20:53] they settle down under the rescuing
[20:55] power of god he sends a prophet he sends
[20:57] a judge
[20:58] amen and and then they'll settle down
[21:01] they'll turn
[21:01] back to jehovah but then they relax and
[21:04] little things start creeping in and they
[21:05] get caught up in idolatry again
[21:07] and then he brings a warning and they
[21:09] don't heed the warning then comes
[21:11] another judgment
[21:12] through either a plague or another army
[21:15] coming in and
[21:16] then they cry out and after they cry out
[21:18] he brings a deliverer and the deliverer
[21:20] brings a deliverance and it goes
[21:21] and the cycle repeats because the
[21:24] prophecy repeats in a revolving history
[21:26] sometimes there's a natural meaning
[21:28] sometimes a spiritual meaning
[21:30] that's why when god gave us the word
[21:32] amen he gave us his
[21:33] thought amen when god laid his thought
[21:36] down he laid it in the word
[21:37] but he wrote his word in such a way that
[21:39] the word is eternal
[21:41] and not limited by our carnal
[21:43] understanding
[21:45] so the word of god is limitless let's
[21:48] just say it's limitless
[21:50] amen and that's why the word can only be
[21:52] known by revelation
[21:53] because by intellect we'll put
[21:55] boundaries on scriptures
[21:58] and when we put boundaries on scriptures
[22:00] all of a sudden the very thing that'll
[22:02] bring us deliverance and understanding
[22:04] where we're at
[22:05] we've pigeonholed to another place and
[22:07] now we walk in darkness because the
[22:10] light that he's gave us has been put out
[22:11] by our own intellectual understanding
[22:15] and this word is a light it's a lamp
[22:17] unto my feet a light unto my path
[22:19] and god sent it as a light and it's a
[22:21] living word it's not a dead word
[22:23] i mean the old testament is not history
[22:25] the old testament's very much alive amen
[22:28] everything that happened there and all
[22:29] the spirits that all the warfare all the
[22:32] spirits
[22:32] everything that was there is here
[22:36] so it's very much alive it's very much
[22:38] applicable it's very much
[22:39] pertinent to what we're going through
[22:40] today because the same spirits they were
[22:43] fighting there
[22:44] are the same spirits you and i are
[22:45] fighting here
[22:47] so we we spied ourselves we we cut
[22:50] ourselves off
[22:51] amen from the very source that god gave
[22:53] us to overcome
[22:54] when we don't allow what brother branham
[22:56] taught us in the scriptures
[22:58] when we don't allow that scripture to
[23:00] unfold through
[23:01] natural and spiritual sometimes dual
[23:03] meanings two or more meanings
[23:05] in a revolving history sometimes natural
[23:07] sometimes spiritual
[23:09] so we've got to break ourselves away
[23:12] from
[23:13] pigeonholing the word of god we have to
[23:15] break our really what we got to break
[23:17] ourselves away from
[23:19] is the denominational approach to the
[23:21] word
[23:23] and it's more pervasive than we think
[23:27] we do it all the time and we don't mean
[23:29] to but it happens to us all the time
[23:32] but thank god he sent a prophet now i
[23:36] want to
[23:36] turn to the book of daniel let's read
[23:38] daniel together daniel chapter 2.
[23:42] this is where we get the context where
[23:45] we drew our text out of
[23:47] for some of what we want to speak on
[23:49] daniel chapter 2 verse 31
[24:03] daniel chapter 2 verse 31 thou o king
[24:05] solace may hold a great image
[24:07] this great image whose brightness was
[24:09] excellent stood before thee and
[24:11] the form thereof was terrible this image
[24:14] image's head was of fine gold his breast
[24:17] in his arms of silver his belly in his
[24:19] thighs of brass
[24:20] his legs of iron his feet part of iron
[24:23] and part of clay
[24:25] thou sawest till that a stone was cut
[24:28] out without hands
[24:30] which smote the image upon his feet that
[24:32] were of iron and clay and break them to
[24:34] pieces
[24:35] then was the iron the clay the brass and
[24:37] the silver and the gold
[24:38] broken the pieces together and became
[24:41] like the chaff of the summer threshing
[24:42] floor
[24:43] what's that that's what the stone fell
[24:45] on
[24:47] and what the stone fell on was ground to
[24:49] powder
[24:50] became like chaff in the summer
[24:51] threshing floor and the wind carried
[24:53] them away that no place was found for
[24:55] them
[24:56] and the stone that smote the image
[24:59] became a great mountain and filled the
[25:00] whole earth
[25:02] this is the dream and we will tell the
[25:04] interpretation thereof before the king
[25:07] thou o king are the king of kings for
[25:09] the god of heaven hath given the
[25:11] kingdom power and strength and glory and
[25:14] wheresoever the children of men dwell
[25:16] the beast of the field and the fowls of
[25:17] the heaven
[25:18] hath he given unto thine hand and hath
[25:20] made thee ruler over all them
[25:23] thou art this head of gold and after
[25:25] thee shall arise another kingdom
[25:27] inferior to thee and another third
[25:29] kingdom of brass
[25:30] which shall bear rule over all the earth
[25:32] and the fourth kingdom shall be strong
[25:34] as iron for as much as
[25:36] iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all
[25:38] things
[25:39] and as iron that breaketh all these
[25:41] shall it breaketh in pieces and bruise
[25:44] and whereas thou saw us the feet and the
[25:46] toes part of potter's clay and part of
[25:48] iron
[25:49] and the kingdom shall be divided but
[25:51] there shall be in it
[25:53] of the strength of the iron for as much
[25:55] as thou saw as the iron
[25:56] mixed with miry clay and as the toes of
[25:59] the feet were part of iron and part of
[26:01] clay
[26:02] so the kingdom shall be partly strong
[26:04] and partly broken
[26:06] and whereas thou saw's iron mixed with
[26:08] miry clay they shall mingle themselves
[26:10] with the seed of men
[26:11] but they shall not cleave one to another
[26:14] even as iron is not mixed with clay
[26:17] and in the days of these kings shall the
[26:19] god of heaven set up a kingdom
[26:21] which shall never be destroyed and the
[26:23] kingdom shall not be left to other
[26:25] people
[26:26] but shall break in pieces and consume
[26:28] all these kingdoms
[26:29] and shall stand forever so as much as
[26:31] thou saw was that the stone was cut out
[26:33] of the mountain without hands
[26:35] and that it break in pieces the iron the
[26:37] brass the clay the silver and the gold
[26:40] the great god hath made known to the
[26:42] king what shall come to pass hereafter
[26:45] and the dream is certain and the
[26:46] interpretation thereof
[26:48] sure so we know by by the teaching that
[26:51] we've had and by what the prophet has
[26:53] taught us
[26:54] that there's an image that
[26:57] nebuchadnezzar sees in a dream
[26:58] and that image starts with his kingdom
[27:01] and moves down through four kingdoms
[27:03] all the way down in the where it's iron
[27:06] mixed with clay
[27:07] into the feet and then to the toes and
[27:09] brother man teaches us this is a gentile
[27:11] world domination
[27:12] this is the gentile world powers amen
[27:14] moving down through
[27:16] starting with nebuchadnezzar who became
[27:18] unto the lord as a king of kings
[27:21] and so then he sees this image
[27:26] and a stone cut out of the mountain
[27:28] without hands
[27:29] now you see where i picked the stone
[27:33] that was just me i just picked that why
[27:36] do you think i picked that stone
[27:41] amen because of the message because of
[27:43] everything else brother branham told us
[27:45] amen if you if you if you if you would
[27:47] ask me
[27:48] brother chad would you please go tell me
[27:50] where brother brennam said that stone
[27:52] that was cut in the vision of daniel
[27:54] was the pyramid capstone at the top of
[27:55] the pyramid i'll just ask you to go read
[27:58] the message
[28:00] just go read the message amen because
[28:02] it's the coming of the headstone
[28:03] friends it's the coming of the capstone
[28:06] capping things off
[28:07] and now there's a stone cut out of the
[28:09] mountain without hands and it smites the
[28:11] image
[28:12] in the feet and it crumbles and then
[28:15] this
[28:16] stone grows into a kingdom
[28:19] that fills all the earth are we together
[28:23] so we we definitely know he's not
[28:25] talking about rocks
[28:27] not talking about a mountain he's
[28:29] talking about a kingdom
[28:30] amen and there's coming of a king which
[28:33] is the stone cut out of the mountain
[28:34] without hands
[28:35] and when the king comes the king smites
[28:38] this image
[28:39] now now if you look this is the world
[28:41] domination of the gentiles
[28:43] which really is the manifestation of the
[28:46] kingdom of satan
[28:48] so really we're looking at the
[28:50] manifestation of the kingdom of satan
[28:52] amen that's going to dominate and rule
[28:55] the world
[28:56] until there's a coming of a stone a
[28:59] king stone the headstone the capstone
[29:03] is going to come and smite this image in
[29:05] the feet
[29:06] why does it smite it in the feet because
[29:08] it's got to smite it
[29:10] in the place where the stone comes to
[29:12] manifestation
[29:14] and the stone comes to manifestation at
[29:16] the end of these four stages
[29:19] all the way down when the gentile
[29:21] kingdoms come to the end of time
[29:23] the end of time for the gentile
[29:25] domination amen at the toes
[29:28] the stone has to hit it there but when
[29:30] it hits the stone
[29:31] when the stone hits the feet it grinds
[29:34] the powder the iron
[29:35] the clay the brass the silver the gold
[29:39] it doesn't have to hit it in the head
[29:40] because that was nebuchadnezzar's right
[29:42] in that same spirit
[29:44] that that antichrist spirit satan's
[29:47] kingdom
[29:47] has now moved into the toes so when the
[29:50] smiting stone
[29:51] comes which is the king the king comes
[29:54] and smites it in the feet
[29:56] amen and it grows into another kingdom
[30:02] praise be to god the things
[30:06] that we have been told the things that
[30:10] we have been
[30:10] shown friends
[30:14] the whole world is waiting for this to
[30:16] happen
[30:20] and that doesn't mean that there won't
[30:22] come a king
[30:23] in the millennium as the son of david
[30:25] that will put down
[30:26] all other kingdoms and that kingdom will
[30:29] grow to a giant mountain that fills all
[30:30] the earth it will it absolutely will
[30:32] happen
[30:33] literally on this earth in the
[30:35] millennium
[30:37] but that doesn't mean that it's not
[30:39] happened already and happening now
[30:43] and it won't happen again
[30:46] see if you think about this
[30:50] when you talk about new jerusalem if we
[30:53] just can just for a minute just bear
[30:55] with me and let me take my time
[30:58] and just just relax i'm just going to
[30:59] relax and not feel pressured
[31:03] but there is a spiritual new jerusalem
[31:05] on earth now
[31:06] and that is the bride and the bride has
[31:09] been adorned prepared for her husband
[31:11] and adorned and what adorned in the word
[31:13] the revealed word of the last day has
[31:15] become her adornment
[31:16] and she has made herself ready by
[31:18] putting this adornment on
[31:21] and there's a there's a new jerusalem
[31:24] but we see
[31:25] that there's going to come a destruction
[31:26] at least a partial destruction to
[31:28] jerusalem
[31:29] and armageddon amen and then the king is
[31:32] going to come which is going to be
[31:33] christ as the son of david
[31:34] and we will come with him and establish
[31:36] a kingdom upon the earth
[31:38] and that kingdom will be the kingdom of
[31:40] jesus christ as the son of david
[31:42] for a thousand years and he will rebuild
[31:45] jerusalem
[31:46] so you will have a new jerusalem so you
[31:49] have a new jerusalem
[31:50] and a new jerusalem
[31:53] are they both new jerusalem yes
[31:56] then at the end of the millennium
[31:58] there's going to be a holy fire from god
[32:01] come down
[32:01] and utterly destroy absolutely
[32:04] everything
[32:04] amen and there's going to be a mountain
[32:06] rise up out of the earth
[32:08] and that mountain will rise up out of
[32:09] the earth and there's going to be
[32:11] a heavenly city the heavenly jerusalem
[32:14] descend
[32:14] from god out of heaven amen after the
[32:17] millennium
[32:18] when we move into eternity it will come
[32:20] down and it will cap off our rest over
[32:23] top of this mountain
[32:24] and the city will be on the mountain and
[32:26] this will come down over the mountain
[32:28] and it'll be new jerusalem
[32:32] so which one's new jerusalem it's all
[32:34] new jerusalem
[32:35] it's all telling the same story it's all
[32:38] telling the same thing
[32:41] men you have a you have it spiritually
[32:44] now
[32:44] you have it naturally in the millennium
[32:46] and then when you move beyond the
[32:48] millennium and the new heaven the new
[32:49] earth
[32:50] what was spiritual and what was natural
[32:52] blends together
[32:53] and now there's no veil separating
[32:55] heaven and earth
[32:56] there's nothing separating the
[32:58] dimensions anymore
[32:59] what was spiritual what is natural now
[33:01] blends together
[33:03] for eternity upon this earth amen and
[33:06] there's no
[33:06] separation from heaven and earth so you
[33:09] have spiritual
[33:10] natural and the blending of spiritual
[33:12] and natural
[33:14] you got that so we have to know who we
[33:17] are and where we're at
[33:18] because i'm i'm not a jew
[33:22] i'm not a jew so i don't need to see
[33:26] something physical i'm a gentile been
[33:29] called under the spiritual reality
[33:31] of a kingdom being taken away from a
[33:33] group of people in a physical location
[33:35] and given to another nation which the
[33:37] kingdom of heaven is within you
[33:39] which is no longer a geographical
[33:41] location but inside a people on the
[33:43] earth
[33:44] so the kingdom moved from a location
[33:46] with a headquarters called jerusalem
[33:48] now moved into another place
[33:52] which is his people and so the gentiles
[33:55] are able to catch this concept of what
[33:58] was natural to israel is now spiritual
[34:00] to the gentiles
[34:02] and we need to get comfortable with that
[34:04] because if we get comfortable with that
[34:05] we'll know where we're at and what's
[34:06] going on right now
[34:08] because i'll tell you new jerusalem is
[34:10] here there's a kingdom that has grown
[34:12] and is covering the face of the earth
[34:14] there is a light that is shining
[34:16] amen the light has descended the king
[34:18] has come
[34:20] the king and queen have united he's
[34:22] sitting on the throne
[34:23] at the top of the mountain and i cannot
[34:26] give you the physical dimensions because
[34:27] there's not physical dimensions
[34:29] it's a spiritual happening that's taking
[34:31] place right now
[34:34] praise be to god and if we can get
[34:36] comfortable with that we can get the
[34:37] benefit from that
[34:38] because the benefit of not always
[34:40] putting off putting off putting off
[34:42] waiting waiting waiting it puts us in a
[34:45] stagnant
[34:46] stalemate position where we begin to
[34:48] slumber and fall asleep again and fall
[34:50] back into the same category of
[34:52] denominationalism
[34:53] and constantly pushing something down
[34:55] the road is going to bring the
[34:57] denominational spirit right
[34:58] back in and we're going to lose our
[35:00] youth and we're going to fall asleep
[35:02] again but this isn't something for the
[35:05] future this is something for right now
[35:07] that's happening right now and we need
[35:09] to ask god to rub the eye salve in our
[35:11] eyes fresh
[35:12] every day so that we can see what's
[35:13] going on all around us
[35:16] because in our hearts maybe not in our
[35:19] intellect
[35:20] but in our hearts he has ripped the veil
[35:23] separating heaven and earth amen and
[35:25] it's
[35:26] connected in my soul
[35:30] and that's the reality that's within the
[35:32] believers
[35:34] praise the lord
[35:40] when jesus came into the coast of
[35:41] caesarea
[35:43] philippi he asked his disciples saying
[35:45] whom do men say that i the son of man
[35:47] am and they said some say thou art john
[35:50] the baptist some elias others jeremiah
[35:52] are one of the prophets he saith whom
[35:55] say ye that i am
[35:56] and simon peter answered and said thou
[35:58] art the christ the son of the living god
[36:00] and jesus answered and said unto him
[36:02] blessed art thou simon barjona
[36:04] for flesh hath not revealed it unto thee
[36:06] but my father which is in heaven
[36:08] and i say unto also unto thee that thou
[36:11] art peter and upon this
[36:12] rock i will build my church and the
[36:14] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[36:16] him
[36:17] there's a foundational scripture for us
[36:21] in more ways than one brother member
[36:23] says now if you notice in the scripture
[36:25] reading there in the psalms i kept
[36:26] saying god is my rock
[36:27] do you know what a rock represents in
[36:29] the bible a rock in the bible here
[36:31] represents the revelation of god
[36:33] see god is my revelation he is see the
[36:35] revelation of the word
[36:37] is the rock so if a stone was cut out of
[36:40] the mountain without hands
[36:41] what is that amen
[36:47] 1962 perseverance but god's got a
[36:50] construction
[36:51] a constructed church that's built on the
[36:53] rock christ
[36:54] jesus and all other ground is sinking
[36:56] sand said
[36:57] eddie paranet that's right upon this
[37:00] rock i'll build my church the catholic
[37:02] church said it was upon peter
[37:03] he backslid after that the protestant
[37:05] said it was upon jesus
[37:06] i differ with you he said flesh and
[37:09] blood hath not revealed this to you but
[37:11] my father
[37:12] which is in heaven has revealed this to
[37:14] you then it was upon the rock of
[37:16] spiritual revelation of the word
[37:20] that's right same thing abel had so
[37:23] listen let's just stop right here
[37:26] whatever
[37:27] peter had is the same thing abel had
[37:31] but we're talking thousands of years
[37:33] apart in different parts of the
[37:34] scripture
[37:35] one caught a revelation of the fall in
[37:37] the garden of eden and the need for a
[37:39] blood sacrifice
[37:40] the other caught a revelation of jesus
[37:42] christ being the son of god
[37:44] and brother brahm said what they got was
[37:47] the exact
[37:48] same thing because they got the
[37:50] revelation
[37:51] of the word for their day
[37:56] oh there's no way we can overemphasize
[37:58] that i can repeat that ten times in a
[38:00] sermon we could go to prayer and we will
[38:01] be all right
[38:02] amen because we've got in order to come
[38:05] in contact with jesus christ
[38:06] you must come in contact with the living
[38:09] word made flesh in your
[38:11] day what abel had
[38:15] was and received was the same thing that
[38:18] peter received
[38:19] they received the word the revelation of
[38:21] the word for their day
[38:23] and it counted abel is righteous and
[38:25] peter is righteous
[38:31] that's right same thing abel had it was
[38:33] revealed to him instead of offering
[38:35] fruit like cain did he offered blood for
[38:36] it was revealed to him
[38:38] the whole church of god is built upon
[38:40] the spiritual
[38:42] revelation of christ who he is what he
[38:45] is and all about him
[38:49] praise be to god
[38:54] we don't mean to be rude there's no
[38:56] desire to be rude
[39:00] but outside the revelation of the word
[39:03] for your day
[39:05] is no life it's death
[39:10] outside the ark everything died
[39:14] the ark was the revelation of the
[39:17] manifestation of the revelation of the
[39:19] word for that day
[39:20] and everything outside of that died
[39:26] and that's everything outside of this
[39:28] message
[39:29] unless you're part of the 144 000
[39:32] is death
[39:36] and doesn't mean there won't be those
[39:37] who are granted eternal life at the
[39:38] white throne judgment but right now it's
[39:41] not eternal life
[39:42] for them they'll be permitted to enter
[39:45] into eternal life but right now it's not
[39:47] equal to eternal life
[39:48] it's death everything outside is death
[39:54] remember that judgment at the great wine
[39:56] throw judgment is the judgment of the
[39:58] dead
[40:01] not the living the only judgment the
[40:04] living have is a judgment of rewards
[40:06] but that white throne judgment is a
[40:08] judgment of the death all the dead
[40:11] rose praise be the god
[40:15] that's not in a way to be rude or say
[40:17] there's categories for everybody god
[40:19] knows there's those who are going to
[40:20] receive
[40:20] entrance into eternal life there are
[40:22] those that will be there and come into
[40:23] the city
[40:24] and visit you and you'll like it and
[40:26] you'll be happy
[40:28] so it's not cutting everybody out it's
[40:30] not that but we have to recognize
[40:32] the word we have to recognize what the
[40:33] word means it's not
[40:35] flexible to our ideas it doesn't make us
[40:38] feel
[40:38] warm fuzzy and comfortable all the time
[40:40] amen the word is the word and the word
[40:42] doesn't flex and the word doesn't move
[40:46] that ark was non-negotiable
[40:51] it was non-negotiable you're either in
[40:53] the ark or you're out of the ark
[40:55] in the ark you live out of the ark you
[40:57] die
[40:58] it's non-negotiable and now the message
[41:01] is christ you're either
[41:02] in christ or out of christ it's not
[41:05] negotiable and we can't be in christ
[41:09] amen by refusing the light of the hour
[41:12] and trying to
[41:12] walk in the light from a previous hour
[41:15] that the only way you can enter into
[41:17] christ is to find him present tense and
[41:19] enter him there
[41:22] and if you enter him there christ is the
[41:24] full revelation of the full word of god
[41:26] so if you enter at the entry point which
[41:29] is the word made manifest in your day
[41:31] when you enter in you get all the word
[41:34] but you've got to find the door you've
[41:36] got to find the gate you've got to find
[41:38] the way to enter
[41:39] and that's through the word made flesh
[41:40] in your day
[41:43] praise god yes
[41:47] but abraham says that's what paul was
[41:50] no matter how much intellectual he had
[41:52] learned he had known god by revelation
[41:56] yes sir the intellectual went all the
[41:57] way out of the business then
[42:00] when the revelation came which upon the
[42:02] rock the church is built
[42:03] yes sir notice he was a predestinated
[42:06] seed
[42:07] the holy ghost alone shows you who he is
[42:10] there is no man they'll make they'll
[42:12] make you father son holy ghost and
[42:14] everything else out of it see but the
[42:16] holy ghost will reveal him as the lord
[42:18] god of heaven
[42:19] made manifest that that is
[42:24] him what will the holy ghost do the holy
[42:27] ghost will reveal to you
[42:29] the lord god of heaven made manifest
[42:31] that that is him
[42:34] so the holy ghost will not point you
[42:36] back to a previous age
[42:39] that's not the holy ghost the holy ghost
[42:42] will point you to the lord god of heaven
[42:44] made manifest
[42:47] praise god
[42:52] now
[42:56] oh praise be to god where do we want to
[42:59] go
[43:02] all right let's look at here
[43:06] we've talked about this several weeks
[43:08] back we've been talking about it quite a
[43:09] bit
[43:10] but brother branham pointed in 1960 to
[43:13] an event that took place where they had
[43:14] the
[43:15] 10 nation committee on disarmament and
[43:17] the talks fell apart and
[43:18] and uh ended badly but brother brown
[43:21] draws our attention to this and shows us
[43:24] that there was the divide of the eastern
[43:27] countries and the western countries
[43:29] and there was five countries on each one
[43:32] and he said the two big toes
[43:34] on those country were the two leaders of
[43:35] the two big nations
[43:37] and that was the united states and the
[43:38] soviet union amen
[43:40] and those two big toes were eisenhower
[43:43] and khrushchev
[43:44] eisenhower means iron khrushchev means
[43:47] clay
[43:47] and so brother branham is trying to not
[43:50] trying
[43:51] he's looking at an event that's taking
[43:53] place in the world
[43:54] and he's and he's drawing our attention
[43:56] to that because god drew his attention
[43:58] to that
[44:00] to show us where we are in the sequence
[44:03] of events where we are in time for the
[44:06] gentiles
[44:08] and brother branham says now and did you
[44:10] notice right now at the last hour
[44:12] when we brought in and where that this
[44:15] last great conference where khrushchev
[44:17] was five nations of the east eisenhower
[44:19] the leader five nations of the west
[44:21] represented the ten toes of the image
[44:23] they would not mix and khrushchev took
[44:25] off his shoe and beat it
[44:26] spiritual mind would pick that up right
[44:28] quick
[44:30] without brother berman i missed it
[44:34] so you have to figure out where your
[44:35] spiritual mind comes from
[44:38] [Laughter]
[44:40] amen we needed a prophet friends we had
[44:43] to have god
[44:44] show us spiritual mind would pick that
[44:47] up right quick
[44:48] on the desk they beat it on the desk
[44:50] they will not mix
[44:51] next thing is the coming of the stone
[44:53] that shoot out of the mountain without
[44:55] hands that will roll into the gentile
[44:56] kingdom
[44:57] it'll be finished and just before that
[45:00] time he's going to send his angel to
[45:02] what church
[45:02] to sodom no to the lukewarm no he sent
[45:05] it to the elected called out church
[45:07] what kind of a sign did he show the same
[45:10] thing that he did here last night
[45:12] god elohim manifested in the person of
[45:15] the holy ghost in his church
[45:16] oh my why it ought to send us a million
[45:19] miles in the sky with shouts and praises
[45:21] of his glory
[45:23] brother is pointing that out and he's
[45:25] saying the next thing to come is a stone
[45:28] that will come and smite those nations
[45:30] in the field that's the
[45:32] next thing to come but just before that
[45:34] he'll send a messenger to the elect
[45:36] group
[45:37] and he said what sign will he show did
[45:39] you catch it
[45:40] he says what kind of sign did he show
[45:42] the same thing that he did here
[45:44] last night the same thing he did here
[45:49] last night
[45:50] when he turned us back to the tent and
[45:52] told what was sarah was thinking in her
[45:54] heart
[45:54] amen and brother branham is there
[45:56] manifesting the same sign
[45:58] showing that the same one is present
[46:01] amen giving a message to his elect
[46:03] amen just before the stone comes down
[46:06] and smites the image in the feet
[46:10] now we got the image down to the feet
[46:13] down to the toes
[46:15] [Applause]
[46:17] and we've got the one who's going to
[46:19] come first
[46:21] with a ministry to the elect doing the
[46:24] same signs
[46:26] everything's in place now it's time for
[46:29] the stone to come
[46:31] and here we are in 1960 amen praise be
[46:34] to god that means
[46:36] amen if if brother branham's talking
[46:38] here and he's showing
[46:39] we've come to the end of the feet to the
[46:41] end of amen this manifestation of the
[46:44] antichrist spirit down through the
[46:45] gentile world
[46:46] powers we've come to the end of that and
[46:49] now
[46:50] the elohim is here in human flesh again
[46:53] doing the same sign that he did there
[46:55] just before the destruction of sodom
[46:57] amen then all of a sudden you have to
[47:00] look around and say
[47:01] where's the stone where's the stone
[47:02] where's the stone it's time
[47:04] for the stone everything's in place
[47:10] praise god
[47:14] amen
[47:17] so that stone
[47:21] when it's cut out it smashes that image
[47:23] in the feet
[47:25] now brother branham he he explains
[47:29] uh this image and he shows the
[47:30] domination of the world powers from
[47:32] babylon
[47:33] to the medes and persians to the empire
[47:35] of greece to rome and rome goes all the
[47:37] way
[47:38] out into the end and it turned from
[47:40] pagan
[47:41] pagan rome to papal rome and then it was
[47:44] a religion that was mixed in
[47:45] mingling with the politics religion and
[47:49] politics now mixing in
[47:50] and infiltrating into everything
[47:54] he said brother i said is rome it's
[47:55] always rome it'll always be rome it's
[47:57] rome
[47:59] and rome has mingled itself in and
[48:01] there's several places in the message
[48:02] where brother ben talks his iron and
[48:04] clay
[48:04] and he starts showing it protestants and
[48:06] catholics he said they start
[48:08] to mix together but they won't mix
[48:10] together but they're starting
[48:12] to come together to mix together but
[48:13] they won't completely mix
[48:15] is that right and he's showing the
[48:17] ecumenical move where they're coming in
[48:19] where the world council of churches is
[48:20] starting up and the the evangelicals and
[48:23] the protestants are gathering together
[48:25] the catholics are gathering together
[48:26] they're going to make a pack and come
[48:27] together to try to mix but they won't
[48:29] completely mix
[48:31] so brother man he's showing us that this
[48:34] image coming down to the feet
[48:35] it's both a political and a spiritual
[48:38] power
[48:39] it's both political and spiritual
[48:41] there'll be a destruction of all the
[48:43] political powers in the kings absolutely
[48:45] don't worry
[48:46] but before that he's going to destroy
[48:48] the stronghold of the spiritual
[48:50] and set his children free
[48:54] so he's going to there's going to be a
[48:55] spiritual stone cut out of the mountain
[48:57] that's going to strike
[48:58] aim in this image of the feet and break
[49:00] the power amen of this
[49:02] catholicism and protestantism the power
[49:05] of the and the harlots
[49:07] the seducing spirit of jezebel amen that
[49:10] has seduced god's children he's going to
[49:12] break that power
[49:13] with a revelation a stone
[49:16] that's going to smite the image in the
[49:18] feet and then that's going to grow into
[49:20] a kingdom that's going to fill all the
[49:21] earth and then there will be
[49:25] the son of david that will put down all
[49:28] other nations
[49:30] and build a mountain which is a kingdom
[49:33] that'll fill all the earth see mountains
[49:36] are kingdoms many times in the bible
[49:40] and it's amazing that moses was called
[49:43] unto a mountain
[49:45] and when he was called into the mountain
[49:46] he met the pillar of fire where and the
[49:48] mountain mount horeb
[49:49] mount sinai when he got the word amen
[49:52] the covenant word
[49:53] for the people of israel he got it on
[49:56] the mountain
[49:56] so god will bring a servant to the top
[49:58] of the mountain and at the top of the
[50:00] mountain he'll give them the word
[50:02] amen that's a covenant between him and
[50:05] his people
[50:06] and we know that that that went wrong
[50:08] the people refused it but there's always
[50:11] these mountaintops and even god when
[50:13] he's when he's calling out in ezekiel
[50:15] calling out least lucifer
[50:16] he says you were on my holy mountain
[50:19] amen but i kicked you
[50:20] out of my mountain that means he's been
[50:22] kicked out of the kingdom
[50:25] and this mountain that grows in daniel
[50:27] will be a kingdom
[50:28] so many times a mountain is a kingdom
[50:31] but let's go to hebrews chapter 12.
[50:55] hebrews chapter 12 verse 18
[50:59] for year not come unto the mountain that
[51:01] might be touched
[51:03] and that burneth with fire nor into
[51:05] blackness and darkness and tempest
[51:07] and the sound of a trumpet and the voice
[51:09] of words which voice that they heard
[51:11] entreated that the word should not be
[51:13] spoken to them anymore
[51:15] for they could not endure that which was
[51:16] commanded and if so much as a beast
[51:18] touched the mountain it should be stoned
[51:20] or thrust through with a dart
[51:21] and so terrible was the sight that moses
[51:24] said i exceedingly
[51:25] fear and quake but you are come
[51:29] unto mount zion and unto the city of the
[51:32] living god the heavenly jerusalem
[51:34] to an innumerable company of angels
[51:37] to the general assembly in church of the
[51:39] firstborn which are written in heaven
[51:41] and to god the judge of all and to the
[51:43] spirits of just
[51:44] men made perfect and to jesus the
[51:47] mediator the new covenant to the blood
[51:49] of sprinkling
[51:50] that speaketh better things than that of
[51:52] abel
[51:53] see that you refuse not him that
[51:55] speaketh for if they escape not who
[51:57] refused him that spoke on earth
[51:59] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[52:01] away from him that speaketh from heaven
[52:04] who voiced then shook the earth but now
[52:07] he hath promised saying
[52:08] yet once more i shake not the earth only
[52:10] but also heaven
[52:12] in this word yet once more signifying
[52:14] the removing of those things that are
[52:16] shaken
[52:17] as of things that are made that those
[52:19] things which cannot be shaken
[52:21] may remain wherefore are we receiving
[52:24] we receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[52:26] moved
[52:27] let us have grace whereby we may serve
[52:29] god acceptably with reverence and godly
[52:31] fear
[52:32] for our god is a consuming fire
[52:35] now the apostle paul brings us in the
[52:37] book of hebrews and he says
[52:38] you've not come to the natural mountain
[52:41] where the law was given where they met
[52:43] god and saw the pillar of fire come down
[52:45] on top of mount you've not come to that
[52:47] mountain
[52:48] but you've come to a mountain is that
[52:51] right
[52:52] so now paul is the one who is taking the
[52:55] natural things from the old testament
[52:57] and bringing them to become spiritual
[52:59] realities in the new testament
[53:02] so paul will take what happened to moses
[53:04] amen it will bring it right up here to
[53:06] today
[53:07] and say you've not come to that mountain
[53:09] but you've come to mount zion
[53:11] and so now moses brought them to a place
[53:14] a minute in that place they were
[53:16] supposed to when they heard the trumpet
[53:18] sound
[53:18] go up into the mountain and meet with
[53:20] god and hear his voice directly
[53:22] but they refused and ran away but moses
[53:25] brought them to the meeting place but
[53:27] they refused and they received the law
[53:29] which was a covenant between god and his
[53:31] people
[53:31] but now now paul the apostle is coming
[53:34] along
[53:35] there's three great prophets amen
[53:37] outside of jesus christ
[53:39] three great prophets that we want to
[53:40] take note of moses
[53:42] the apostle paul and brother branham
[53:46] three great prophets and all of them
[53:48] have to do
[53:49] with a mountain and the word
[53:52] right moses brought a people freed from
[53:56] the bondage of
[53:57] egypt enslaved in egypt and brought a
[53:59] people out
[54:00] to meet god on their way to the promised
[54:03] land and he was given the word
[54:06] paul was bringing a people out of the
[54:09] bondage of religion
[54:11] and trying to bring them to mount zion
[54:13] he said you've not come to that place
[54:15] but i've brought you to a place i've
[54:17] brought you to mount zion
[54:18] what were they supposed to do at sinai
[54:20] when they heard the trumpet they were
[54:22] supposed to go and meet god
[54:23] now paul brings them to the base of
[54:25] mount sinai
[54:26] amen and he's bringing it to the base of
[54:28] mount sinai but there's going to be a
[54:30] building up of mount
[54:32] zioni zion for three
[54:35] or for some seven church ages but when
[54:38] we get to the top
[54:40] amen something's going to happen at the
[54:42] top of mount zion
[54:44] that's going to be the king the king's
[54:46] going to come
[54:47] cap this mountain and unite with his
[54:50] church
[54:52] so moses brought them to a mountain and
[54:55] gave them the word
[54:56] paul brought them to a mountain and gave
[54:58] them the word and brother branham
[55:00] amen comes at the top of the mountain
[55:02] and receives the word
[55:05] amen moses wrote the old testament
[55:09] paul wrote the new testament and brother
[55:11] branham gave the revelation of the
[55:13] unwritten word in the top of the
[55:15] mountain amen that reveals the mystery
[55:18] laying through old and new testament
[55:22] three great prophets amen and we happen
[55:24] to be living in the day
[55:25] not on mount zion not at the base not a
[55:28] mount sinai not at the base of mount
[55:30] zion but we
[55:31] through seven church ages worked our way
[55:32] up and now we're up in the capstone
[55:35] in the throne with the king himself
[55:38] this is a different age and we we need
[55:41] to act different
[55:42] think different believe different be
[55:44] different amen
[55:45] we're not in the journey we're in the
[55:47] top
[55:50] and paul was the one bringing the church
[55:53] to this mountain
[55:54] and this mountain was spiritual
[56:02] yeah the apostle paul has absolutely no
[56:05] problem
[56:06] taking something from the old testament
[56:08] that's fixed and solid
[56:10] and tangible and touchable
[56:13] and he'll bring it right to the new
[56:15] testament church and it's spiritual
[56:16] nothing you can touch lay your hands on
[56:18] it's a faith in the word because
[56:21] that's the dispensation for the gentiles
[56:24] it's spiritual revelation spiritual
[56:26] manifestation
[56:28] a spiritual kingdom in you it was taken
[56:30] away from the jews which was
[56:32] physical and given to a nation which is
[56:35] spiritual
[56:36] what nation is that the nation of the
[56:39] kingdom of christ
[56:40] the kingdom of god
[56:44] praise god now
[56:48] now the apostle paul
[56:52] he's coming at the end of the old
[56:56] testament
[56:57] he's coming into the new testament to
[56:58] lay out the new testament
[57:00] but he's speaking of a voice that will
[57:02] speak from heaven
[57:04] that will shake he said that voice
[57:07] shook the earth but don't refuse him
[57:11] that speaketh
[57:13] that is going to shake the heavens and
[57:16] the earth
[57:18] so that anything that can shake
[57:21] that can move will be shaken so that
[57:23] that which cannot move shall remain
[57:26] so now he's talking about a voice from
[57:28] heaven that will shake
[57:30] not just the earth but the heaven and
[57:32] the earth and
[57:33] remember now paul is talking spiritually
[57:38] he said you've come to the heavenly
[57:39] jerusalem you've come to the
[57:41] uh uh you know the the spirits of just
[57:44] men made
[57:45] perfect you've come to all none of it
[57:47] you can see
[57:48] none of it you can see none of you can
[57:50] feel what the sense is
[57:52] it's all spiritually discerned
[57:55] so when the shaking comes that he's
[57:56] talking about is he talking about
[57:59] something
[57:59] where you see you know all the uh all
[58:02] the stars falling and shooting stars to
[58:04] the earth and great earthquakes rumbling
[58:06] that's not what he's talking about he's
[58:08] talking about a shaking that's going to
[58:09] shake the whole world
[58:10] and when brother branham got caught up
[58:12] in the constellation he said there was a
[58:14] blast
[58:14] that shook the whole earth
[58:17] shook the horse why it shook every
[58:20] religious system
[58:21] it shook every religious demon amen it
[58:23] even shook
[58:24] i'm telling you it shook the powers in
[58:26] heaven because we were not against
[58:28] principalities
[58:29] and flesh and blood but we war against
[58:31] uh principalities and powers in heavenly
[58:34] places
[58:34] that term actually means in heaven
[58:38] because the accuser of the brethren is
[58:39] there making accusation
[58:41] he has access to the the throne in
[58:43] heaven to accuse you
[58:45] and when this blast went off amen for
[58:47] the opening of the seven thunders
[58:49] it didn't just shake the religious
[58:51] system on earth but i assure you friends
[58:53] it shook heaven itself
[58:55] heaven and earth has been shaken from
[58:57] this voice that has come from heaven
[59:00] where at the top of zion
[59:05] all these things that brother branham is
[59:06] teaching us and telling us he's pulling
[59:08] them right out of the scriptures friend
[59:10] and making them alive amen and we just
[59:13] have to
[59:14] take what he said we've made so many
[59:16] mistakes as human
[59:18] beings trying to take the word and use
[59:21] the word to him
[59:22] in the message
[59:25] oh if i could take time to explain this
[59:29] we want to prove everything by the word
[59:31] but we've had the backwards approach to
[59:33] proving everything by the word
[59:35] so we've taken our understanding or
[59:37] denominational understanding through
[59:39] years of the word
[59:40] and we've tried to frame brother
[59:42] branham's message
[59:44] in our paradigm of the word
[59:48] amen and because you can read the
[59:51] scriptures
[59:51] easy for water baptism in jesus name it
[59:54] fit in
[59:56] and you could read the scriptures on
[59:58] there's only one god
[1:00:00] only one lord and you could slip that in
[1:00:02] there too and you could even read about
[1:00:05] eve was beguiled by the serpent and you
[1:00:07] could see serpent seed
[1:00:08] and so you could slide that in right
[1:00:10] there but there was some things he said
[1:00:12] that was so mysterious amen it was far
[1:00:15] beyond an
[1:00:16] intellect being able to read black marks
[1:00:18] on white paper
[1:00:19] so we would leave that outside saying
[1:00:22] that we're just judging this by the word
[1:00:24] and shaving off things that the prophet
[1:00:27] taught us
[1:00:30] is that the truth that's exactly what's
[1:00:33] happened
[1:00:34] not by evil intentions but the carnal
[1:00:36] mind through a denominational upbringing
[1:00:39] trying to take the word and check the
[1:00:41] message with the word and brother
[1:00:43] branham said take everything i said back
[1:00:44] to the word
[1:00:45] but brother branham wasn't saying he was
[1:00:47] teaching it wrong
[1:00:49] he was letting you know this is right
[1:00:52] take it to the word
[1:00:53] you'll find it in the word
[1:00:58] so now we've got to take the pattern
[1:01:00] that was laid out at the opening of the
[1:01:01] seals
[1:01:02] and lay that pattern down all through
[1:01:04] the word and with that pattern in our
[1:01:06] minds read the word
[1:01:07] and all of a sudden the word starts
[1:01:08] coming to life we started seeing things
[1:01:11] that were there that we never knew were
[1:01:13] there
[1:01:13] [Applause]
[1:01:14] and all of a sudden this is why he said
[1:01:16] this and this is why he said that and
[1:01:18] this is why he said that
[1:01:20] oh praise be to god let the prophet be
[1:01:23] the prophet
[1:01:24] moses was the giver of the word amen in
[1:01:26] the old testament
[1:01:27] amen paul was the giver of the word in
[1:01:29] the new testament and brother branham
[1:01:31] was the revealer of the word
[1:01:33] at the end of it all let him have his
[1:01:36] job
[1:01:40] he said when all the mysteries of the
[1:01:42] bible was all finished
[1:01:46] down comes this angel who was finishing
[1:01:49] the mysteries
[1:01:50] what ministry was that the ministry of
[1:01:52] the seventh angel
[1:01:53] that's his job
[1:01:57] it wasn't never our job to fact
[1:02:00] check brother branham
[1:02:04] it was brother branham's job to break
[1:02:06] our fact checker
[1:02:09] [Laughter]
[1:02:12] amen so that we can break the carnal
[1:02:15] the intellectual the ability to read oh
[1:02:19] my goodness we think it's such a
[1:02:20] privilege to be able to read amen
[1:02:22] those who would would benefit from the
[1:02:24] prophecy laid out in the book of
[1:02:26] revelation with those
[1:02:27] that read or hear amen you don't even
[1:02:29] have to be able to read
[1:02:31] amen peter was not an intellectual man
[1:02:34] and it benefited him well just to be
[1:02:36] able to receive the keys to the kingdom
[1:02:41] so praise be to god we don't want to get
[1:02:44] in bad habits we want all bad habits to
[1:02:47] be broke
[1:02:49] let the prophet bring the word that's
[1:02:52] what a prophet is
[1:02:53] a divine revealer of the word
[1:02:57] brother brethren gave us that definition
[1:02:59] a divine revealer of the word
[1:03:01] he says and what we have now is the
[1:03:04] perfect interpretation of the word with
[1:03:05] divine vindication
[1:03:11] so i'm not interested in fact checking
[1:03:12] brother branham
[1:03:14] i want him i want that message that god
[1:03:17] brought through that vessel
[1:03:19] to break every notion and tear down
[1:03:22] every wall and fence and i want to go
[1:03:25] back to the word
[1:03:26] with some freedom to move in the message
[1:03:30] with some freedom to explore the land
[1:03:32] with some freedom
[1:03:34] to cut away the ball and chain and cut
[1:03:36] away all the restrictions
[1:03:38] amen and just be free to enjoy the word
[1:03:43] amen so now the apostle paul
[1:03:47] here in hebrews he's laying this out
[1:03:49] you've come to a mountain
[1:03:50] you've come to heavenly jerusalem you've
[1:03:52] come to an innumerable company of angels
[1:03:55] he never said you're coming too you've
[1:03:56] already come
[1:03:58] because why that's all part of this
[1:04:00] mountain
[1:04:02] that's all part of mount zion it's all
[1:04:04] there you've come to it
[1:04:08] he says now
[1:04:11] verse 25 see that you refuse not him
[1:04:13] that speaketh
[1:04:14] for they escape not who refused him that
[1:04:16] spake on earth much more shall not we
[1:04:18] escape if we turn away from him that
[1:04:20] speaketh from heaven whose voice then
[1:04:23] shook the earth
[1:04:24] but now he has promised saying yet once
[1:04:26] more i shake not the earth only but also
[1:04:28] heaven
[1:04:30] and this word yet once more signifying
[1:04:32] the removing of those things
[1:04:33] which are shaken as the things which are
[1:04:35] made that those things which cannot be
[1:04:37] shaken may remain
[1:04:39] wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[1:04:42] cannot be moved
[1:04:43] let us have grace whereby we may serve
[1:04:46] god acceptably
[1:04:47] with reverence and godly fear
[1:04:50] apostle paul says we're receiving a
[1:04:52] kingdom
[1:04:54] and that kingdom cannot be moved
[1:04:58] he says in the message in his presence
[1:05:01] from 1962
[1:05:04] he said this is evangelism this is the
[1:05:06] time to shake people this is the time
[1:05:07] that
[1:05:08] god said there'd come a time he shook
[1:05:10] mount sinai one time but
[1:05:11] there'd come a shaking again he wouldn't
[1:05:14] only shake mount zion but he would shake
[1:05:15] everything that could be moved but did
[1:05:17] you notice the rest of the scripture
[1:05:19] but we receive a kingdom that cannot be
[1:05:21] moved hallelujah
[1:05:22] everything that can be shook will be
[1:05:24] shaken the heavens will shake the earth
[1:05:26] will shake
[1:05:27] heaven and earth will pass away but the
[1:05:28] word shall never pass away
[1:05:30] for upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:05:33] and the gates of hell will never prevail
[1:05:34] against it everything that can be shook
[1:05:37] will be shaken
[1:05:38] but we receiving a kingdom which is the
[1:05:40] word of god himself
[1:05:42] and god is the word so what is that
[1:05:44] kingdom
[1:05:45] the word of god himself and it cannot be
[1:05:47] shaken
[1:05:48] and god is the word he don't shake
[1:05:51] himself amen but we receiving a kingdom
[1:05:55] that cannot be moved
[1:05:56] it is unshakable said paul the hebrew
[1:05:58] writer
[1:06:00] i want to read a couple more quotes on
[1:06:01] the same subject and the world is
[1:06:03] falling apart he says we are dead our
[1:06:05] lives are hidden god through christ and
[1:06:07] not only that but we are raised with him
[1:06:09] raised up
[1:06:10] in a system a denomination organization
[1:06:13] we are
[1:06:13] resurrected in the kingdom of god the
[1:06:16] kingdom of god is within
[1:06:18] you why all these man-made systems must
[1:06:20] fall
[1:06:21] not one not once more i'll shake the
[1:06:24] world but i'll shake heavens
[1:06:26] and those things that cannot be shook
[1:06:28] it's what will remain and we receive a
[1:06:30] kingdom receiving a kingdom that cannot
[1:06:32] be shook or moved
[1:06:33] that's the kingdom of god not a system
[1:06:36] not a political wheel
[1:06:37] not a denomination but a kingdom amen
[1:06:40] and its subject
[1:06:41] is dead to the systems of this world its
[1:06:43] subjects are dead to these organizations
[1:06:45] it's dead to those political system and
[1:06:47] it's alive and resurrected by the power
[1:06:50] of the king
[1:06:54] and future home he says and look you are
[1:06:56] part of that
[1:06:57] ground is that right and when he
[1:06:59] redeemed you he redeemed the earth with
[1:07:01] the same thing and you are together
[1:07:02] again
[1:07:03] how much plainer can it be you have to
[1:07:05] be redeemed because you're part of it
[1:07:07] and if the blood didn't drop on you you
[1:07:09] ain't redeemed yet you're not called
[1:07:11] then he cleansed it that's the same
[1:07:13] thing he does in the fire
[1:07:14] even the blood dropped it's yet got to
[1:07:16] be cleansed by fire
[1:07:18] that's right for a dwelling place for
[1:07:20] god god
[1:07:21] already took up his abode potentially
[1:07:23] the kingdom of god is in the earth now
[1:07:26] in the hearts of his saints are you in a
[1:07:29] kingdom
[1:07:30] is the kingdom in you what's the
[1:07:32] geographical location
[1:07:34] i'll tell you where it is it's covered
[1:07:36] the whole earth
[1:07:40] it's his attributes that he begin in the
[1:07:42] beginning now his attributes is redeemed
[1:07:45] what's he waiting
[1:07:46] to redeem the earth to set his
[1:07:47] attributes on it to fulfill exactly his
[1:07:49] predestinated plan
[1:07:52] then he says christ and christ is the
[1:07:53] mystery of god revealed then our
[1:07:55] headship
[1:07:56] is a kingdom oh this is good
[1:07:59] our headship is a kingdom what's our
[1:08:01] headship the capstone
[1:08:04] what's the capstone christ the
[1:08:06] revelation of jesus christ the capstone
[1:08:08] the headstone coming to the church
[1:08:10] is a kingdom the kingdom of god is
[1:08:13] within you
[1:08:14] said the bible jesus the kingdom we are
[1:08:16] not a denomination we belong to a
[1:08:18] kingdom and the kingdom is the word of
[1:08:20] god
[1:08:21] made spirit and life in our own life
[1:08:24] let's read that again the kingdom the
[1:08:27] kingdom is the word of god
[1:08:30] made spirit and life in our own life
[1:08:34] that's the kingdom not just say i've got
[1:08:36] the kingdom i listen to the message no
[1:08:37] it's got to become spirit of life
[1:08:39] in our life that's the kingdom there's
[1:08:42] spirit in life in our own life
[1:08:45] every promise in this day as it did in
[1:08:46] the day when the word and god was won
[1:08:49] and the word and god is one in his
[1:08:51] church today making it the headship of
[1:08:53] the body that is redeemed
[1:08:54] to bring the message in the last day and
[1:08:57] be taken up from the dead in the
[1:08:58] resurrection to go back and restore
[1:09:00] again as adam and eve in the beginning
[1:09:02] in the garden of eden the threefold
[1:09:04] mystery of god his
[1:09:06] body the threefold mystery of god
[1:09:10] has to do with his body
[1:09:13] second fold is preeminence in his body
[1:09:18] in his kingdom his kingdom in you the
[1:09:20] kingdom
[1:09:21] in you in the earth now what earth this
[1:09:24] earth
[1:09:28] let's look at this section again out of
[1:09:30] daniel daniel 2 and 31
[1:09:32] thou saws till a stone was cut out
[1:09:34] without hands
[1:09:36] which smote the image upon his feet that
[1:09:38] were of iron and clay and break them to
[1:09:40] pieces
[1:09:41] then was the iron the clay the brass the
[1:09:44] silver and the gold
[1:09:44] broken the pieces together and became
[1:09:46] like the chaff of the summer
[1:09:48] threshing floors and the wind carried
[1:09:50] them away that no place was found for
[1:09:51] them
[1:09:52] and the stone that smote the image
[1:09:54] became a great mountain
[1:09:55] and filled the whole earth this is the
[1:09:58] prophecy that we're dealing with now
[1:10:00] now i want to look at junior jackson's
[1:10:03] dream
[1:10:04] if i can and i'm going to i'm going to
[1:10:06] take my time and not
[1:10:07] blow through this either but i want to
[1:10:09] read out is this the sign of the answer
[1:10:11] i got several places i'm going to read
[1:10:13] but we'll talk about this
[1:10:15] so brother jackson dreamed to dream he
[1:10:17] couldn't get away from it
[1:10:19] and was leaving his church and he just
[1:10:21] couldn't stand it
[1:10:22] how long ago has it been brother jackson
[1:10:24] for the brexit february 61.
[1:10:26] he had the dream and he came to me and
[1:10:28] said something is on my heart i must
[1:10:30] tell you brother branham
[1:10:31] i said go on brother jackson he said i
[1:10:33] dreamed a dream and there it was
[1:10:35] i just sat still and i listened and
[1:10:37] watched brother bram is now seeing it
[1:10:39] he's listening to junior jackson tell it
[1:10:40] but he's watching the dream
[1:10:44] and i watched he said i dreamed that
[1:10:45] there was a great big hill like out in
[1:10:47] the field
[1:10:48] where bluegrass or something was and
[1:10:50] said up on top of this hill
[1:10:52] where the water had washed away the soil
[1:10:54] there was a top rock
[1:10:56] up on top the hill like the top of the
[1:10:57] mountain it was a rock
[1:10:59] no grass and where the water had washed
[1:11:02] down it had cut
[1:11:02] some kind of readings on these stones
[1:11:05] and you were standing there interpreting
[1:11:07] this reading on these stones
[1:11:09] and said all of us and here's the way he
[1:11:11] put it the brethren from georgia and
[1:11:13] from all around we were all standing
[1:11:15] together listening to you interpret that
[1:11:16] mysterious writing on those stones that
[1:11:18] mountain
[1:11:20] and said then you picked up something
[1:11:22] like from the air something like a
[1:11:24] wrecking bar or a crowbar wasn't it
[1:11:25] brother
[1:11:26] something like that a wrecking bar real
[1:11:27] sharp and said
[1:11:29] how you done it i don't know and said
[1:11:31] you struck the top of the mountain
[1:11:33] ripped it around and lifted the cap
[1:11:35] of it off it was in the shape of a
[1:11:37] pyramid and you ripped the top of it off
[1:11:39] now that was months and months and
[1:11:41] months before the pyramid message was
[1:11:42] preached
[1:11:43] beneath that was white stone granite and
[1:11:46] you said the sun or the light has never
[1:11:48] shined on this before
[1:11:49] look in on this watch this and that's
[1:11:52] right because the formation of the world
[1:11:54] the world was formed before there was
[1:11:55] light
[1:11:55] we all know that god moved upon the
[1:11:57] water and then then in the beginning he
[1:11:59] spoke for
[1:12:00] light and natural down down under there
[1:12:03] and the age that
[1:12:04] that formation was that light had never
[1:12:06] come upon that stone
[1:12:08] and he said look upon this light has
[1:12:10] never come upon it before
[1:12:12] and then when all of them got up and i
[1:12:14] told them to watch that
[1:12:15] and all of them come up and look in but
[1:12:17] he said while they were looking in
[1:12:19] he looked out the corner of his eyes i
[1:12:21] believe it was and watched me
[1:12:23] i slipped off to one side and started
[1:12:25] going towards the west towards the
[1:12:26] setting of the sun
[1:12:27] coming up a hill going down a hill
[1:12:29] coming up a hill going downhill getting
[1:12:30] smaller and smaller
[1:12:32] and went all the way out of sight so
[1:12:35] junior jackson comes to brother man with
[1:12:36] this dream this is the first dream in a
[1:12:38] series of six dreams that individuals
[1:12:40] will bring to him
[1:12:40] that's capped off by the vision of the
[1:12:42] constellation of the seven angels
[1:12:44] and in search of this the time he says
[1:12:46] there was this pyramid
[1:12:48] coming up out of the earth
[1:12:51] amen friends where
[1:12:54] where has this pyramid of the church
[1:12:57] ages come from
[1:12:59] from the earth the people you you and
[1:13:02] the people down through the ages for 2
[1:13:04] 000 years
[1:13:04] have been flesh part of the earth eating
[1:13:07] the earth
[1:13:08] earth making their body and in their
[1:13:10] body amen was a portion of the word for
[1:13:13] that
[1:13:13] age amen and that mountain has been
[1:13:16] growing
[1:13:16] out of the earth through the seven
[1:13:19] church ages it's been coming up out of
[1:13:22] the earth
[1:13:23] brother branham says your bodies were
[1:13:24] laying in this earth back when he formed
[1:13:26] the foundation of the world your body
[1:13:27] laid right there the materials for your
[1:13:29] body laid right there
[1:13:31] so this great monument to god this great
[1:13:34] pyramid that's been raising through
[1:13:36] seven church ages
[1:13:37] has been coming out of the earth
[1:13:42] and up at the top the washing of the
[1:13:44] water of the word is starting to reveal
[1:13:47] what's in the earth
[1:13:50] hallelujah the prophet's been revealing
[1:13:53] the church ages he's been revealing
[1:13:54] amen what has been coming up out of the
[1:13:57] earth from the time of fall on
[1:13:59] it's been building and building and
[1:14:00] building this great pyramid shape
[1:14:02] through seven dispensations of time
[1:14:04] coming up now
[1:14:06] to the top to the cap and he says up
[1:14:08] there was a top rock
[1:14:10] like a pyramid at the top amen and there
[1:14:13] was
[1:14:14] where the water had washed down the
[1:14:16] water the word had washed down
[1:14:18] he said it had cut yeah he had cut
[1:14:20] riding in this rock
[1:14:22] then another place brother bib says
[1:14:23] funny looking writing
[1:14:26] funny writing because nobody could
[1:14:29] interpret it
[1:14:32] they the the the lutherans tried and the
[1:14:34] wesleyans tried
[1:14:36] and the pentecostals tried but it was
[1:14:39] funny writing
[1:14:40] and brother benham never attributed to
[1:14:42] any given language
[1:14:45] yeah you understand he didn't say it was
[1:14:48] this kind of writing or that kind of
[1:14:49] writing
[1:14:50] he said funny writing
[1:14:53] because there's only one that's ever
[1:14:55] going to be able to interpret that
[1:14:56] writing
[1:14:57] and it's going to be the seventh angel
[1:14:59] that funny writing was put there
[1:15:01] just for him
[1:15:04] and he says all of a sudden he reached
[1:15:06] out of the air
[1:15:08] and he grabbed something like a wrecking
[1:15:10] bar crowbar real sharp
[1:15:12] and he just he said he didn't even know
[1:15:14] how he did it just grabbed it somehow
[1:15:16] and popped the top off of this
[1:15:18] and underneath was white stone so there
[1:15:21] was writing
[1:15:22] all over on the outside of the stone the
[1:15:24] stone was coming
[1:15:26] up out of the earth oh if we could just
[1:15:29] catch this phrase
[1:15:30] this is going to explain our whole
[1:15:31] existence and the whole church ages and
[1:15:33] everything right here
[1:15:34] coming up out of the earth amen through
[1:15:36] this hill coming
[1:15:38] up what was in the earth what was laying
[1:15:40] in the earth undiscovered
[1:15:41] amen it was the very mountain of god the
[1:15:44] very kingdom of god the very people of
[1:15:46] god
[1:15:46] amen god himself in a pyramid form
[1:15:49] coming up through seven church ages
[1:15:51] amen but at the top the water of the
[1:15:53] word begins to wash it away
[1:15:55] so you can see what's been in the earth
[1:15:57] all the time
[1:15:59] and we get to the top and now there's
[1:16:01] this funny writing and nobody can
[1:16:03] interpret but brother branham starts to
[1:16:05] interpret the writing
[1:16:06] because brother branham has to go around
[1:16:08] all over this
[1:16:09] outside word which is
[1:16:13] what's written in the bible and restore
[1:16:16] all the truths that were lost and
[1:16:17] interpret the bible
[1:16:19] and when he gets the bible all
[1:16:20] interpreted ties together all these
[1:16:22] loose sins that was left off through the
[1:16:23] church ages
[1:16:25] when he gets done with that at the top
[1:16:28] now
[1:16:29] it's time to reveal that there's
[1:16:32] something
[1:16:32] inside this rock now that has no writing
[1:16:35] on it
[1:16:38] oh praise be to god you know brother
[1:16:40] bram didn't have this dream
[1:16:42] junior jackson had the dream so he's not
[1:16:45] taking
[1:16:46] he's not just saying this is what
[1:16:47] happened and this was no somebody else
[1:16:49] had the dream
[1:16:50] and god was showing it through another
[1:16:52] vessel showing exactly what's taking
[1:16:54] place
[1:16:56] and so now brother bannon had come to
[1:16:57] the end of tying together all the loose
[1:17:00] ends
[1:17:00] he had preached the uh he preached the
[1:17:02] church ages which contained in the
[1:17:04] church ages
[1:17:04] every major doctrine of the church is
[1:17:07] that what he said
[1:17:09] tied together all the lucians interpret
[1:17:11] their writing on the outside of the rock
[1:17:14] but then when he gets to the top and all
[1:17:15] the brothers are standing around he gets
[1:17:17] an instrument he gets a tool he gets
[1:17:19] something in his hand
[1:17:20] and he uses that tool to pop the top
[1:17:23] off of the mountain to show that there's
[1:17:25] something else
[1:17:27] in here there's something else inside
[1:17:31] here
[1:17:32] everybody else can see the funny writing
[1:17:36] and try to interpret serpent seed and
[1:17:38] what about it is there three gods one
[1:17:40] god
[1:17:40] amen i don't understand the serpenty
[1:17:42] thing what about election
[1:17:44] election and free choice and how does
[1:17:45] election and free choice work and
[1:17:47] funny writing and everybody could try
[1:17:49] but there was one who could interpret
[1:17:51] the writing on that
[1:17:52] and that was brother branham and when he
[1:17:53] got done tying together all the loose
[1:17:56] ends something from heaven was given to
[1:17:58] him an ability
[1:18:01] was handed to him to discover amen
[1:18:04] to pop the top off of this and discover
[1:18:06] that underneath the top of this
[1:18:09] there is unwritten word light has never
[1:18:12] shined on this before
[1:18:14] nobody's even tried to interpret the
[1:18:16] funny writing
[1:18:18] why because there is no writing
[1:18:22] and brother bam goes right to the seals
[1:18:24] let's turn over here to revelation
[1:18:27] revelation chapter eight
[1:18:31] oh i'm trying to hold myself back i and
[1:18:34] and so many of you are so well versed in
[1:18:36] this you know exactly where i'm going
[1:18:37] you know what i'm going to say
[1:18:38] but i just feel compelled to keep going
[1:18:40] through because sometimes you don't
[1:18:41] catch it the first time
[1:18:42] second time third time but there's
[1:18:44] always a time when all of a sudden under
[1:18:46] the anointed preaching he's like
[1:18:48] got it click something just clicked like
[1:18:50] never before
[1:18:51] so i want to take my time and go through
[1:18:53] this revelation 8 chapter
[1:18:55] chapter 8 verse 1. see that's what
[1:18:58] happens when i start talking too fast
[1:19:00] sends you to the wrong chapter the wrong
[1:19:02] book in the bible
[1:19:04] we're gonna this is the opening of the
[1:19:05] seventh seal
[1:19:08] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[1:19:11] there was silence in heaven about the
[1:19:12] space of half an hour
[1:19:15] see brother brennan takes that and he
[1:19:17] shows
[1:19:18] that nothing said right here in this
[1:19:21] seventh seal
[1:19:22] at all other six seals they had
[1:19:25] information they had information they
[1:19:26] had information
[1:19:27] but when you get to the seventh seal the
[1:19:29] only information that you have
[1:19:31] is silence about the space of half hour
[1:19:35] nothing but then he comes over here to
[1:19:37] revelation chapter 10.
[1:19:40] we'll pick it up in verse 1 he says and
[1:19:42] i saw another mighty angel come down
[1:19:43] from heaven clothed with a cloud
[1:19:45] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[1:19:47] face was as it were the sun
[1:19:50] and his feet as pillars of fire and he
[1:19:52] had in his hand a little book
[1:19:54] open and he set his right foot upon the
[1:19:56] sea and his left foot upon the earth
[1:19:58] and he cried with the loud voices when a
[1:20:00] lion roareth and when he had cried
[1:20:02] seven thunders uttered their voices now
[1:20:05] seven thunders uttered their voices
[1:20:08] that wasn't a rolling of thunder
[1:20:12] a thunder in the bible was always the
[1:20:14] voice of god
[1:20:15] what the prophet tells us and you can
[1:20:17] see in the scriptures seven thunders
[1:20:19] uttered their voices
[1:20:21] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[1:20:22] their voices i was about to write
[1:20:25] so when the thunders uttered their
[1:20:26] voices it spoke
[1:20:28] something that john could write down so
[1:20:31] it wasn't just
[1:20:32] a noise it wasn't an undiscernible noise
[1:20:34] it was something that john
[1:20:36] heard and john comprehended john
[1:20:38] understood
[1:20:39] and john could record it
[1:20:44] and when the seventh hunters had uttered
[1:20:45] their voices i was about to write and i
[1:20:46] heard a voice from heaven saying unto me
[1:20:48] seal up those things which the seven
[1:20:50] thunders uttered and
[1:20:52] write them not
[1:20:56] and the angel which i saw stand up on
[1:20:57] the scene upon the earth lifted up his
[1:20:59] hand to heaven
[1:21:00] and swore by him that liveth forever and
[1:21:01] ever who created heaven and the things
[1:21:03] that therein are
[1:21:04] and the earth and the things that there
[1:21:06] are and the sea
[1:21:07] and the things which are therein that
[1:21:10] there should be time no longer
[1:21:12] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:21:13] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:21:15] sound
[1:21:16] the mystery of god the mystery
[1:21:20] of god and i just want to inject this
[1:21:23] christ is the mystery of
[1:21:27] god revealed the one singular mystery
[1:21:31] was a threefold purpose
[1:21:35] male female restored back to the garden
[1:21:38] of eden
[1:21:39] the mystery of god what is the mystery
[1:21:42] of god christ is the mystery of god what
[1:21:44] is christ the anointed word in each age
[1:21:47] the word and manifestation or the word
[1:21:49] becoming flesh
[1:21:51] what is christ what is christ the
[1:21:53] mystery of god revealed i don't know
[1:21:54] about you but to me
[1:21:55] christ the mystery of god revealed is
[1:21:57] the mystery that
[1:21:58] god wanted to be manifest in flesh
[1:22:04] jesus is flesh and my flesh
[1:22:09] and i hope your flesh
[1:22:12] the mystery of god and the days of the
[1:22:15] voice of the seventh angel
[1:22:16] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:22:18] of god should be finished as he hath
[1:22:19] declared to his servants
[1:22:21] the prophets so brother ever said he
[1:22:23] begins to sound
[1:22:24] he said not when he goes out and the
[1:22:27] healing campaigns and all of that
[1:22:29] when he begins to sound out his message
[1:22:31] and his
[1:22:32] message is the message of the seventh
[1:22:34] seal he's the messenger of the seventh
[1:22:35] seal
[1:22:36] and the seventh seal is revelation 10
[1:22:38] 1-7
[1:22:39] it's what he says and what what what is
[1:22:42] the message
[1:22:43] in revelation 10 1-7 it's the message
[1:22:46] that
[1:22:46] john was forbidden to write
[1:22:50] brother branham so brother branham says
[1:22:52] that's why
[1:22:53] when he looks at this he says there's
[1:22:55] seven thunders and those seven thunders
[1:22:57] are sealed
[1:22:58] he says seal it up and write it not and
[1:23:01] that's why brother branham starts saying
[1:23:02] see there's seven seven seals on the
[1:23:05] back
[1:23:06] part of the book this is what he's
[1:23:08] talking about
[1:23:10] not 14 seals there are no 14 seals
[1:23:13] but he says there's seven seals amen in
[1:23:16] the book
[1:23:16] and there's seven seals on the back side
[1:23:19] of the book amen and he's talking about
[1:23:21] the seven seals
[1:23:22] from revelation chapter six the six
[1:23:24] seals and then the seventh in revelation
[1:23:25] chapter eight
[1:23:26] amen that come forth in symbol form
[1:23:29] except the seventh which is just
[1:23:31] silence for the space of half an hour
[1:23:33] but then
[1:23:34] over here you have seven thunder seven
[1:23:37] voices seven
[1:23:38] revelations seven something that came
[1:23:41] from god
[1:23:41] when the angel descended so when the
[1:23:44] angel comes to earth with an open book
[1:23:46] in his hand
[1:23:47] then there are seven voices
[1:23:51] that bring information
[1:23:54] that john could write down but he was
[1:23:57] told not to write it to seal it and
[1:23:58] brother branham calls those the seals on
[1:24:00] the backside of the book or the second
[1:24:02] set of seals
[1:24:05] and so he sees the ones on the inside
[1:24:07] are open but they're open in symbol form
[1:24:09] but the ones on the back side
[1:24:10] nothing's even spoke of them at all and
[1:24:13] that's what he's referring to when he
[1:24:15] gets here deserves is this the time
[1:24:17] and he takes that tool and he pops the
[1:24:19] top off and sees see
[1:24:21] no light is shown on this unwritten word
[1:24:23] it's not even written
[1:24:25] in the bible why because when it comes
[1:24:27] to the seventh seal
[1:24:28] silence when you come over here to the
[1:24:30] seven thunders silence
[1:24:31] he said see they're connected together
[1:24:35] it's the same thing whatever the seventh
[1:24:37] seal is amen is what those seven
[1:24:40] thunders are
[1:24:44] and he says and brother says i've read
[1:24:46] lots of men's writing and i've never
[1:24:47] read where anybody ever said that
[1:24:49] there's seven seals yet to be revealed
[1:24:52] why because he's the one that was given
[1:24:54] the tool
[1:24:55] that'll pop open the top of this word
[1:24:59] what's the what's the top of the word
[1:25:01] amen the word has been building old
[1:25:02] testament new testament building all the
[1:25:04] way up when you get to the top of the
[1:25:06] word or the capstone of the bible is
[1:25:07] which book of the bible
[1:25:09] the book of revelation amen brother
[1:25:12] banham starts down through that book
[1:25:13] down through the church ages
[1:25:15] amen and he gets to a place now where
[1:25:16] serves as this the time
[1:25:18] he starts showing that there's seals
[1:25:20] over here there's a seven seal here
[1:25:22] there's thunders over here
[1:25:23] what's he doing he's interpreting the
[1:25:25] funny writing on the outside of the cap
[1:25:29] but he says but look he grabs a tool
[1:25:33] he pops it open and says look but
[1:25:35] there's something
[1:25:36] inside that's not even written in the
[1:25:38] bible amen and he said i went out west
[1:25:40] and he said maybe to get the
[1:25:42] interpretation of what that was
[1:25:45] oh i love this
[1:25:52] he said
[1:25:55] and further in search is this the time
[1:25:57] or is this the sign of the answer
[1:26:00] and seven thunder's right in the
[1:26:01] revelation here of jesus christ it's
[1:26:03] some mystery
[1:26:04] does not the bible say that the
[1:26:05] revelation of jesus christ
[1:26:08] what is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:26:09] this book that we're reading out of the
[1:26:11] capstone book of the bible
[1:26:13] is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:26:17] and there's a hidden mystery in the
[1:26:19] revelation of jesus christ
[1:26:21] that has to do with the white stone to
[1:26:24] the seven
[1:26:24] thunders the unwritten portion in the
[1:26:26] word
[1:26:29] why he said why there is some hidden
[1:26:32] mystery then of it
[1:26:33] what is it the seven thunders have it
[1:26:36] for john was just about to write and the
[1:26:38] voice come down to heaven said don't
[1:26:40] write it
[1:26:40] but seal it seal it up put it on the
[1:26:42] back side of the book
[1:26:43] it's got to be revealed it's the
[1:26:46] mysteries
[1:26:48] further down he says and notice he said
[1:26:51] in some mysterious way
[1:26:52] we picked up out of the air a sharp tool
[1:26:55] that opened up the top
[1:26:56] and in there was white granite but it
[1:26:58] wasn't interpreted
[1:27:00] there was no letters i didn't interpret
[1:27:02] that junior i just looked at it
[1:27:04] and i said to the brethren look on this
[1:27:06] and that's
[1:27:07] fulfilled tonight
[1:27:11] motherboard is coming down he's taking
[1:27:12] this dream he's taking all of this and
[1:27:14] he's starting to piece it together so we
[1:27:16] know where we're at
[1:27:17] and he's and brother branham said now we
[1:27:18] went around and we interpreted the
[1:27:20] writing on the wall
[1:27:21] on on the outside of the stone and at
[1:27:24] the top
[1:27:24] amen and what's he doing brother branham
[1:27:27] is showing
[1:27:28] seven thunder seven mysterious thunders
[1:27:30] of seven seal
[1:27:31] silence a seven thunder sealed up don't
[1:27:33] write it
[1:27:34] all of these things and at the time of
[1:27:36] the uh the seventh angels ministry
[1:27:38] amen the mystery of god will be complete
[1:27:40] he's talking about
[1:27:41] all of that what's he doing he's taking
[1:27:45] the sharp tool
[1:27:46] and he's popping the top off of the word
[1:27:50] right there and the message serves as
[1:27:52] his time and showing there's a white
[1:27:54] stone underneath
[1:27:55] and junior jackson dreamed about it in
[1:27:57] february of 1961
[1:27:58] and brother branham comes and says that
[1:28:00] dream's fulfilled tonight
[1:28:05] and he said look on this and i'm going
[1:28:07] out west
[1:28:09] to get the interpretation and come back
[1:28:12] and we're going to reveal what's not
[1:28:15] written
[1:28:17] see brother said i used to think that it
[1:28:19] was something that was not even written
[1:28:21] in the bible at all but he said see you
[1:28:22] can't add one word or take one
[1:28:24] word away it's something that has to be
[1:28:26] laying in the bible
[1:28:28] but been missed back there so what's he
[1:28:31] saying
[1:28:31] that there is a white stone there
[1:28:35] so there's a there's a there's
[1:28:38] out of the earth has been coming the
[1:28:42] kingdom of god
[1:28:44] one delegate at a time
[1:28:47] building building building what his
[1:28:50] temple
[1:28:51] his holy mountain his dwelling place
[1:28:55] do we understand we start thinking about
[1:28:58] temple when we think of solomon's temple
[1:29:00] we think of the temple in new heavens
[1:29:01] and new earth
[1:29:02] those are all symbolic friends
[1:29:05] where's his altar your heart where's his
[1:29:06] temple you
[1:29:09] solomon gathered stones from all over
[1:29:11] mis-shaped different sized stones and he
[1:29:14] fit them together perfectly to make his
[1:29:16] temple
[1:29:16] why because it's the living stones where
[1:29:19] the shekinah glory of god abides
[1:29:23] the lord of the rings keeps pointing to
[1:29:25] the pyramid to the pyramid over and over
[1:29:26] pointing to the pyramid
[1:29:27] and the pyramid is made by all kinds of
[1:29:29] different size and shaped stones
[1:29:31] amen and they've been gathered together
[1:29:33] and placed so perfectly in their
[1:29:35] position
[1:29:37] that they're earthquake proof
[1:29:42] everything that can be shaken shall be
[1:29:44] shaken so that which cannot be shaken
[1:29:46] which was the word
[1:29:47] that looked like a misfit to the world
[1:29:49] but there was a place in the temple of
[1:29:51] god that you
[1:29:52] that stone fit perfect and when you find
[1:29:54] your position in your place
[1:29:56] in the temple of god the house of god
[1:29:58] the mountain of god the dwelling place
[1:30:00] of god
[1:30:00] then you become earthquake proof
[1:30:06] you cannot be shaken because you're the
[1:30:08] word you're the living stone
[1:30:10] shaped by the word put in position by
[1:30:12] the word in the temple of god
[1:30:14] and it's become earthquake proof
[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:19] out of this out of the earth
[1:30:23] comes the temple of god the mountain of
[1:30:26] god
[1:30:26] what is it the kingdom of god the holy
[1:30:30] mountain where is it coming from
[1:30:33] you and me and great-great-grandma
[1:30:36] so-and-so and luther's
[1:30:37] great-great-grandma so and so
[1:30:39] what is it out of the earth is coming
[1:30:42] the holy mountain of god
[1:30:46] and at the top under the washing of the
[1:30:47] water of the word
[1:30:49] there's revealing mysteries
[1:30:52] loose ends in the bible it's all tangled
[1:30:55] up and
[1:30:56] there's gonna be a prophet start
[1:30:57] interpreting that and then when he gets
[1:30:58] to the top
[1:30:59] and his funny writing he's to begin to
[1:31:01] show that there's something more there's
[1:31:03] something in the bible
[1:31:05] there's seven thunders there's silence
[1:31:07] in heaven there's something going on
[1:31:09] a a mighty angel descending and a
[1:31:12] ministry of the seventh angel
[1:31:13] and he takes a tool and he pops it off
[1:31:16] and he says see
[1:31:17] nothing was written but it was sounded
[1:31:20] it was the voice of god and brother man
[1:31:21] said god doesn't do something just to be
[1:31:23] playing
[1:31:25] god doesn't speak just to speak he
[1:31:27] wasted he does waste not his breath
[1:31:30] if god spoke it was for a reason and if
[1:31:32] god spoke he gave a revelation
[1:31:35] and if that revelation was sealed up
[1:31:36] there has to come a time for that
[1:31:38] revelation to be
[1:31:39] unsealed and brother brenham said
[1:31:43] that he showed us that that white stone
[1:31:45] is a mystery
[1:31:47] that's not written but it's
[1:31:51] in the word it's in the stone
[1:31:55] i say it like this it's in the living
[1:31:58] stones
[1:32:03] what are you doing as a stone hewed out
[1:32:06] of the earth
[1:32:08] all you see is stone but i'd like to
[1:32:11] tell you behind the stone
[1:32:13] is a white rock
[1:32:16] a mystery that's been going on through
[1:32:19] the whole bible
[1:32:20] and that mystery is a mystery of
[1:32:22] marriage a mystery of a husband and a
[1:32:24] wife
[1:32:25] a mystery of god becoming flesh
[1:32:28] and that white stone is the unspoken
[1:32:31] mystery
[1:32:31] through the whole bible he said it was
[1:32:34] christ and noah
[1:32:35] it was christ and moses it was christ
[1:32:38] and david
[1:32:38] it was christ what was that it was the
[1:32:41] white stone in the stone amen
[1:32:43] it was christ hiding behind moses it was
[1:32:45] christ hiding behind david it was christ
[1:32:48] hiding behind solomon
[1:32:51] what was it it was the white stone
[1:32:54] within the stone
[1:32:55] amen the unwritten portion of the bible
[1:32:57] the mystery of
[1:32:59] god becoming flesh
[1:33:05] and nobody knew it until somebody could
[1:33:06] pop the top off and say there's
[1:33:08] more than what the theologians have been
[1:33:10] reading there's more than what the
[1:33:12] the printer can put in the book there's
[1:33:14] more what's laying there is written
[1:33:16] between the lines
[1:33:17] it can't be a new word because you can't
[1:33:19] add to or take away
[1:33:20] but this white stone nothing's written
[1:33:23] because it's been written on the outside
[1:33:25] but the revelation of the white stone
[1:33:26] will read between the lines
[1:33:28] on what's written on the outside and
[1:33:31] show you what the mystery has been
[1:33:32] through the whole book where at the top
[1:33:37] when somebody can take a tool from god
[1:33:39] and pop the top off and say
[1:33:41] there's a white stone inside
[1:33:45] oh praise god where does that put us
[1:33:48] friends
[1:33:50] i hope you're not waiting for something
[1:33:52] to happen
[1:33:53] [Music]
[1:33:54] you are the something that's happening
[1:34:00] and i say that over and over but i want
[1:34:02] it to sink into all of our hearts i want
[1:34:04] it to sink into my heart
[1:34:05] i want to repeat it till it becomes such
[1:34:07] a living reality it affects
[1:34:09] every moment of my day because it still
[1:34:11] hasn't hit like it should hit
[1:34:15] we'll go over these things and go over
[1:34:17] these things and go over things because
[1:34:18] there's got to come a greater
[1:34:19] manifestation to what is going on
[1:34:21] there's got to become a greater reality
[1:34:23] that's going on
[1:34:24] there's got to be oh praise god there's
[1:34:26] got to be that prophet with that tool in
[1:34:28] his hand
[1:34:29] that can cut away the casing stone off
[1:34:31] of me so the white stone can shine for
[1:34:33] us
[1:34:34] in my life so it wouldn't be chad lamb
[1:34:37] it would be jesus christ the one on the
[1:34:39] inside
[1:34:40] it was christ and moses it was christ
[1:34:42] and david it's
[1:34:43] christ in his bride can you say it's
[1:34:45] christ and bob it is christ and chad and
[1:34:47] it's christ and dave
[1:34:48] can you say that and say lord let that
[1:34:51] prophet take that tool and cut away the
[1:34:53] casing
[1:34:54] so that the whiteness comes through the
[1:34:56] purity of the revelation of what's going
[1:34:58] on in this day
[1:35:01] hallelujah
[1:35:05] let's look in the book of exodus real
[1:35:12] quick
[1:35:17] i told you there's three prophets you
[1:35:19] have to watch
[1:35:21] moses but paul brother brandon
[1:35:25] there's three exodus all tied to these
[1:35:28] three prophets
[1:35:30] let's look at exodus 32.
[1:35:37] oh my goodness i get so excited
[1:35:44] i'm gonna take a drink we'll slow down
[1:35:47] i'm gonna say the right chapter
[1:35:49] and the right verse so we can all read
[1:35:52] the same spot
[1:35:53] exodus 32 15.
[1:35:57] and moses turned and went down from the
[1:35:59] mountain two tables of the testimony
[1:36:01] were in his hand
[1:36:02] and the tables were written on both
[1:36:04] their sides on one side and on the other
[1:36:06] were they written
[1:36:07] does that sound familiar
[1:36:11] i mean it's like we're right at
[1:36:13] revelation chapter 5
[1:36:15] and i saw a book in his hand written
[1:36:18] within on the inside and on the back
[1:36:20] side
[1:36:23] these things aren't in here just because
[1:36:27] god doesn't waste any time they were
[1:36:30] written on both their sides on the one
[1:36:31] side and on the other
[1:36:32] were they written and the tables were
[1:36:34] the work of god and the writing was the
[1:36:36] writing of god
[1:36:37] graven upon the tables and when joshua
[1:36:40] heard the noise of the people as they
[1:36:42] shouted
[1:36:43] he said unto moses there is a noise of
[1:36:45] war in the camp
[1:36:47] and he said it is not the voice of them
[1:36:48] that shout for mastery
[1:36:50] neither is it the voice of them that cry
[1:36:52] for being overcome
[1:36:53] but the noise of them that sing do i
[1:36:55] hear and it came to pass as soon as he
[1:36:57] came nigh into the camp
[1:36:59] that he saw the calf and the dancing and
[1:37:01] moses anger waxed taught
[1:37:03] and he cast the tables out of his hands
[1:37:05] and break them
[1:37:06] beneath the mount
[1:37:09] so now he's been up
[1:37:13] he's been up in the presence of god
[1:37:18] and he's received the law of god
[1:37:22] but if you read the previous chapters
[1:37:24] brother
[1:37:25] god is telling him all about temple
[1:37:27] worship and all about
[1:37:29] the the law he's giving them all kinds
[1:37:31] of information
[1:37:33] but all that was written on the table of
[1:37:35] stones was the ten commandments
[1:37:37] because the ten commandments is the
[1:37:39] covenant between god and his people
[1:37:41] he brought them to sinai to marry them
[1:37:45] the purpose of sending a prophet to go
[1:37:47] rescue them from bondage was to bring
[1:37:49] them out to sinai so he could marry them
[1:37:51] but they refused the purpose of sending
[1:37:55] paul
[1:37:55] a prophet was so that he could marry
[1:37:57] them but they refused
[1:37:59] so what's the purpose of sending this
[1:38:00] prophet in the end time
[1:38:02] to bring us to the mountain so we can
[1:38:04] marry him
[1:38:06] let's not refuse him that speaketh from
[1:38:08] heaven
[1:38:11] so now you know moses brings them here
[1:38:16] god wanted to give his word directly to
[1:38:18] his people
[1:38:19] so he spoke he came down with fire and
[1:38:21] he spoke and when he come down with fire
[1:38:23] and he spoke the people ran the other
[1:38:25] way because they could not endure that
[1:38:27] which was commanded they couldn't take
[1:38:29] him in the voice direct from god and
[1:38:31] they prayed for a prophet to come and he
[1:38:33] says that's fine
[1:38:34] that's what you'll have from now on and
[1:38:35] that's the way god's done it ever since
[1:38:39] and so he brings him up into the
[1:38:41] mountain and he gives him all kinds of
[1:38:43] the word
[1:38:44] but he writes on these two tables of
[1:38:46] stone the covenant between him
[1:38:50] and israel and he comes down with this
[1:38:54] covenant
[1:38:56] this these two tables of stone written
[1:38:58] in stone between
[1:38:59] god and the people and he found the
[1:39:01] people
[1:39:02] already in idolatry
[1:39:06] and he was so angry that he cast out the
[1:39:09] tables of stone from his hand and they
[1:39:10] broke the pieces
[1:39:11] because when paul would come with the
[1:39:13] revelation of the word before they could
[1:39:15] unite they
[1:39:16] already went into idolatry in the first
[1:39:18] church age and the word was fragmented
[1:39:22] it's the same pattern over and over
[1:39:23] again now the word was broken
[1:39:26] amen the covenant between god as people
[1:39:28] was broken and fragmented and people
[1:39:30] could pick up
[1:39:31] pieces and have a little bit of this and
[1:39:33] a church age could grab a little bit of
[1:39:35] this and
[1:39:35] a little bit of that armenianism and
[1:39:38] calvinism
[1:39:39] and and right
[1:39:44] but god wasn't going to leave it that
[1:39:45] way god was going to fix it
[1:39:50] his own way praise god let's turn to
[1:39:55] uh exodus 34
[1:39:59] and read verse 1.
[1:40:05] and the lord said unto moses hew thee
[1:40:08] two tables of stone likened to the first
[1:40:11] and i will write upon these tables the
[1:40:13] words that were the first tables
[1:40:15] which thou breakest and be ready in the
[1:40:17] morning and come up in the morning unto
[1:40:19] the mount sinai and present thyself
[1:40:21] there to me in the top of the mountain
[1:40:23] and no man shall come up with thee
[1:40:25] neither let any man be seen throughout
[1:40:27] all the mount
[1:40:28] neither let the flocks nor the herds
[1:40:30] feed before the mount
[1:40:32] and he hewed two tables of stone like
[1:40:34] unto the first and moses rose up early
[1:40:36] in the morning
[1:40:37] and went up until mount sinai as the
[1:40:39] lord had commanded him
[1:40:41] and took in his hand the two tables of
[1:40:42] stone
[1:40:44] and the lord descended in the cloud
[1:40:48] and the lord descended in the cloud and
[1:40:50] stood with him there and proclaimed the
[1:40:52] name of the lord
[1:40:53] so now the word has been broken because
[1:40:56] of idolatry and in idolatry the word's
[1:40:58] been fragmented
[1:40:59] but god now is going to give his people
[1:41:01] the covenant again he's going to give
[1:41:03] the people his word again
[1:41:04] and so he calls moses back up into a
[1:41:07] mountain
[1:41:08] but before he tells moses to cut
[1:41:11] two tables of stone out of the mountain
[1:41:13] amen that means
[1:41:14] moses was going to have to grab a sharp
[1:41:17] tool
[1:41:19] he's going to have to take a sharp tool
[1:41:21] and he's going to have to
[1:41:23] cut amen two tables of stone but not
[1:41:25] right on the two tables of stone
[1:41:27] because moses is going up to the
[1:41:29] mountain recognizing that there's word
[1:41:32] that's been broken
[1:41:33] amen and he's coming up with two tables
[1:41:35] of stone with
[1:41:36] nothing written on the stone
[1:41:41] i love the word of god amen how did he
[1:41:44] get these tables of stone oh he must
[1:41:46] have just grabbed something from the air
[1:41:48] a sharp tool or something
[1:41:49] amen and cut it out and he realizes
[1:41:52] there's got to be writing on these two
[1:41:54] tables of stone
[1:41:55] amen brother madam he's in sabino canyon
[1:41:57] amen and he lifts up his hand
[1:41:59] and all of a sudden something strikes
[1:42:00] his hand and what is it it's a sword and
[1:42:02] it says it's the sword of the king he
[1:42:04] said oh a sword of a geek said no
[1:42:06] these sword of the king what is it the
[1:42:08] word in the hand
[1:42:09] the prophet gets a sharp tool and with
[1:42:12] the sharp tool
[1:42:13] he can cut the top off and say there's
[1:42:15] something here
[1:42:16] in the same shape as this there's
[1:42:19] something underneath
[1:42:20] moses cut something the same shape of
[1:42:23] what was lost the first time
[1:42:25] but it has nothing written on it
[1:42:28] unwritten word
[1:42:29] unwritten stone and brother branham
[1:42:31] takes a sharp tool
[1:42:33] and cuts the top off and in the same
[1:42:35] shape
[1:42:37] of the seven seals in the same shape
[1:42:40] of the capstone there's another stone
[1:42:45] with nothing written on it
[1:42:49] so when moses was going to get the
[1:42:51] writing on the stone he had to take this
[1:42:53] stone
[1:42:55] that he cut with a sharp tool
[1:42:58] and go up on the mountain and up on the
[1:43:01] mountain
[1:43:02] god would come down in the cloud
[1:43:09] oh praise be to god
[1:43:12] everything brother branham did was
[1:43:14] orchestrated by the word
[1:43:17] this is what i was talking about the
[1:43:19] first time early in the message
[1:43:21] tonight this morning when we said we've
[1:43:23] been taking the word
[1:43:25] and trying to mold brother ben's message
[1:43:27] inside our paradigm of the word
[1:43:29] amen and it's the actual revelation of
[1:43:31] the word
[1:43:32] that brings light to what's laying here
[1:43:34] in the message how do we know what moses
[1:43:36] is doing if it wasn't for what we've
[1:43:38] seen happen in this day
[1:43:40] and caught the revelation of what's
[1:43:41] happened and it unlocks the mystery back
[1:43:44] in exodus
[1:43:46] exodus is not unlocking the mystery
[1:43:48] today the mystery today
[1:43:50] is unlocking the mystery in exodus
[1:43:53] we've got to catch the revelation by
[1:43:56] faith we've got to catch the revelation
[1:43:58] of the word today
[1:43:59] amen and if we catch the revelation of
[1:44:01] what's happening
[1:44:02] your bible will become a new book
[1:44:06] but we've tried to take the old book of
[1:44:08] the old bible amen and tried to take the
[1:44:10] message and stuff it into the old book
[1:44:12] of the old bible
[1:44:13] that's not a new bible that's not a new
[1:44:15] book friends
[1:44:17] but the seven seals loose that book from
[1:44:20] the old form that we had it in
[1:44:21] so that it could pop wide open so that
[1:44:24] we could catch the fresh
[1:44:25] revelation from god and that revelation
[1:44:28] will unlock the mystery of the whole
[1:44:30] word
[1:44:33] we've had it backwards
[1:44:36] how do we understand what ruth was all
[1:44:38] about and her journey in moab and coming
[1:44:40] back
[1:44:40] and orpha and two churches and false and
[1:44:43] because of the revelation today
[1:44:45] unlock the mystery then that was the
[1:44:48] white
[1:44:48] part of the stone that was hidden behind
[1:44:51] the words amen
[1:44:52] how did we get the interpretation of the
[1:44:54] white part the unwritten part
[1:44:55] where does the bible say ruth amen is a
[1:44:58] type of the gentile bride
[1:45:00] it doesn't it's white
[1:45:02] [Applause]
[1:45:04] [Music]
[1:45:05] amen where does it say rachel the fourth
[1:45:07] one to bring forth from jacob
[1:45:09] brings forth joseph amen perfect type of
[1:45:12] christ and brings forth benjamin when
[1:45:13] she departs
[1:45:14] showing the ministry of the bride where
[1:45:16] is that it's written there but it's in
[1:45:18] the white part
[1:45:20] what revealed the white part when a
[1:45:22] prophet could pop the topic
[1:45:24] when he could grab a sharp something
[1:45:26] from the air
[1:45:28] hallelujah we've got to be spiritually
[1:45:31] tuned in
[1:45:32] when brother branham says and serves
[1:45:33] this time i grab something out of the
[1:45:35] air somewhere
[1:45:36] and then he comes just a month later
[1:45:41] because the happening in sabino can with
[1:45:43] the sword in his hand happened just a
[1:45:45] month later in january
[1:45:48] and he holds his hand up and something
[1:45:50] mysteriously strikes his hand
[1:45:55] how can you tie those together how can
[1:45:58] you not
[1:45:58] tie those together
[1:46:02] you see friends it's not intellectual
[1:46:04] understanding
[1:46:05] amen it's not the ability to do a word
[1:46:08] search and compare exact phrases
[1:46:10] it's a revelation that unlocks the whole
[1:46:13] mystery
[1:46:13] it's a revelation that unlocks the
[1:46:15] message and it's a revelation that
[1:46:17] unlocks the whole bible
[1:46:20] and without that revelation you'll be a
[1:46:22] frustrated human being
[1:46:24] because you'll always be trying to take
[1:46:25] firm hard
[1:46:27] fixed unflexible words and explain and
[1:46:30] understand the message
[1:46:31] when brother branham doesn't use the
[1:46:33] scriptures in an
[1:46:34] unbending unflexible stiff rigid way
[1:46:38] and if we try to use the scriptures in a
[1:46:41] way different than he used the
[1:46:42] scriptures
[1:46:44] which he used them the same way jesus
[1:46:46] christ used the scriptures
[1:46:48] and the same way the apostle paul used
[1:46:49] the scripture
[1:46:51] but if we try amen so that we're not
[1:46:53] deceived
[1:46:54] and so that we don't go in air and so
[1:46:56] that we don't make any mistakes
[1:47:01] take a common well-defined understanding
[1:47:04] of the bible
[1:47:07] do you see the foolishness of mankind
[1:47:10] do you see our own our own failure do
[1:47:13] you see your failure i see my failure
[1:47:17] take the rigidity of the word and a
[1:47:20] rigid interpretation of the word
[1:47:22] and try to understand the message with a
[1:47:24] rigid interpretation of the word
[1:47:26] and all we end up doing is getting
[1:47:27] confused
[1:47:30] and we do word searches and find exact
[1:47:32] phrases and then we say well what did
[1:47:34] brother branham say
[1:47:35] about this subject and you start
[1:47:37] searching through it's like ah
[1:47:38] yeah he means this and he said that he
[1:47:40] means this and then all of a sudden he
[1:47:42] switches
[1:47:47] at the opening of the seventh day ah
[1:47:49] seventh season will open we know the
[1:47:50] seventh seal is not open yet so i'm
[1:47:51] still not open yet
[1:48:00] because that's not the way to find truth
[1:48:02] the way to find truth is a divine
[1:48:05] revelation from the father himself who
[1:48:08] unlocks the mystery in your heart and
[1:48:10] then you have faith in what that prophet
[1:48:12] said
[1:48:12] and you let that be the measuring stick
[1:48:15] that unlocks the
[1:48:16] the whole bible you can't work
[1:48:20] backwards you've got to work from the
[1:48:23] revelation at the top
[1:48:25] down you can't work from the bottom up
[1:48:30] hallelujah so moses now
[1:48:34] takes a sharp tool where'd you read that
[1:48:36] brother chad
[1:48:38] it's between the lines
[1:48:42] i don't think he used a dull tool to cut
[1:48:44] out the stone
[1:48:48] oh once you catch the revelation of the
[1:48:51] word the bible's fun
[1:48:53] all the rigidity all the stiffness all
[1:48:55] the fear
[1:48:56] of having it wrong just vanishes away
[1:48:58] and all of a sudden you realize that
[1:49:00] this word is my playground
[1:49:02] this word is my land this is the streams
[1:49:04] and the hills and the fields that he
[1:49:06] gave me to enjoy
[1:49:07] this word is my eden
[1:49:11] and i can eat the fruit from it and i
[1:49:13] can go anywhere in it
[1:49:14] and i can enjoy being in eden
[1:49:20] and all of a sudden the word gets fun
[1:49:23] because moses
[1:49:24] must have took a sharp tool
[1:49:28] and cut out two tables of stone with
[1:49:31] nothing written on them
[1:49:34] and went to the mountain because brother
[1:49:36] branham had cut the top off to reveal
[1:49:39] a stone with nothing written on it and
[1:49:41] he takes that stone
[1:49:42] up to the how do you know he took the
[1:49:44] stone up to the mountain my goodness
[1:49:47] there was no real stone it was a dream
[1:49:53] he took that stone in his heart the the
[1:49:56] mystery that was there
[1:49:57] he took it with him up to the mountain
[1:49:59] in sabino cannon
[1:50:01] and then a cloud came down
[1:50:04] and revealed the name of the lord
[1:50:08] but then let's go over here to verse 27.
[1:50:12] between verse 5 and 26
[1:50:16] uh god is speaking to moses giving him
[1:50:18] all kinds of instructions
[1:50:20] now let's let's back up and look over
[1:50:22] here
[1:50:24] at chapter 34 verse 1 it says the lord
[1:50:27] said unto moses who the two tables of
[1:50:29] stone like and to the first and i will
[1:50:31] write upon these tables
[1:50:33] the words that were in the first tables
[1:50:35] which thou breakest
[1:50:38] so the lord says i'm going to write on
[1:50:40] these tables you hew them out
[1:50:42] you bring them up with nothing written
[1:50:43] on them i'll write on them
[1:50:46] now verse 27 and the lord said unto
[1:50:49] moses
[1:50:50] write thou these words for after the
[1:50:52] tenor of these words i have made a
[1:50:53] covenant with thee
[1:50:55] and with israel and he was there with
[1:50:57] the lord 40 days and 49th he didn't
[1:50:59] either eat bread nor drink water
[1:51:01] and he wrote upon the tables the words
[1:51:03] of the covenant
[1:51:04] the ten commandments who wrote upon it
[1:51:09] moses it was moses's hand
[1:51:13] but it was the word of god moses became
[1:51:17] the tool
[1:51:18] amen that god was using to write it oh
[1:51:20] it was moses hand all right
[1:51:22] with another sharp tool
[1:51:27] where did he get that sharp tool i don't
[1:51:28] know maybe he grabbed it out of the air
[1:51:32] he was up on the mountain he went up on
[1:51:34] the mount and god said i'm going to ride
[1:51:36] on these stones he went up into the
[1:51:37] mountain
[1:51:38] expecting god to ride on the stones he
[1:51:40] had already cut the stones out
[1:51:41] so maybe he just left all of his sharp
[1:51:44] tools
[1:51:46] because god said he's going to write on
[1:51:48] this stone so he goes with unwritten
[1:51:49] stone
[1:51:50] amen in the same shape he knows it's got
[1:51:52] to be the same thing
[1:51:57] because you can't add to or take away
[1:51:59] it's got to be the same thing
[1:52:00] but moses can't write on there because
[1:52:02] moses doesn't know what it is
[1:52:03] amen so now he's got to go up and god
[1:52:05] says all right on it so where did he get
[1:52:07] the sharp instrument to write on it
[1:52:09] maybe he had his hands up rejoicing and
[1:52:12] maybe something struck his hand
[1:52:14] and maybe he took that amen and was able
[1:52:16] to carve
[1:52:17] out of the stone what was unwritten
[1:52:19] before and when he when he carved it out
[1:52:22] you realize it was an exact match to
[1:52:25] what was laying in the first word
[1:52:29] oh praise be to god friends
[1:52:33] that hits me and thrills my heart
[1:52:37] why because it's the same story a
[1:52:39] revolving history
[1:52:40] doing the same things if you know what's
[1:52:42] been you know it will be
[1:52:44] and all that is is what's been before
[1:52:46] that's what solomon told us
[1:52:48] amen this has already happened i mean
[1:52:51] brother brennan's ministry was been
[1:52:53] vindicated
[1:52:54] by the word everything he did was based
[1:52:56] on what happened in the
[1:52:58] word and now he was given this sword
[1:53:01] amen to cut amen out of the white stone
[1:53:05] and give us the revelation of the
[1:53:08] unspoken part of the word
[1:53:10] which was the revelation contained in
[1:53:13] the seven
[1:53:14] thunders which was the interpretation
[1:53:18] of the symbols of the seven seals that
[1:53:20] were given in symbol form
[1:53:22] amen but nobody knew what they meant and
[1:53:23] they probed that and they poked at it
[1:53:25] but the revelation was laying in the
[1:53:27] seven thunders which wasn't written down
[1:53:29] which john heard but couldn't write but
[1:53:31] brother branham picked it up
[1:53:33] and where did he get it brother branham
[1:53:34] says it's not a man
[1:53:36] this didn't come from a man it's been
[1:53:38] the angels of the lord
[1:53:39] amen brother branham was the tool that
[1:53:41] god used to speak from the microphone
[1:53:43] but he's not the one who can make up the
[1:53:46] words
[1:53:46] it had to come directly as a revelation
[1:53:49] from god almighty to interpret the
[1:53:51] unwritten stone
[1:53:52] that was under the cap and so brother
[1:53:55] branham didn't reveal
[1:53:57] anything amen he was only the tool that
[1:54:00] god used to reveal it
[1:54:01] because moses didn't write on those
[1:54:03] stones god said i'll write on those
[1:54:05] stones
[1:54:06] just like god said i'll go down and
[1:54:07] deliver my people now moses you come and
[1:54:10] go
[1:54:11] i'll write on those tables of stone now
[1:54:13] moses pick up your pen and write
[1:54:16] [Applause]
[1:54:19] you see friends when we take the form in
[1:54:22] rigidity
[1:54:22] amen away from the word the word gets
[1:54:25] super fun and exciting
[1:54:27] because you see it not as stories but as
[1:54:29] one story
[1:54:31] and an unfolding of the one mystery the
[1:54:34] one plan
[1:54:34] the one goal god had in his mind
[1:54:38] what was that christ the mystery of god
[1:54:42] revealed
[1:54:47] oh praise god i'm so far off my notes i
[1:54:50] don't even know where i'm at
[1:54:52] hey amen brother man said don't you say
[1:54:56] thank you to no man in the seventh seal
[1:54:58] this didn't come from a man he said i
[1:55:01] knew not those things
[1:55:03] he didn't get it through study he got it
[1:55:06] by divine revelation
[1:55:08] guess what you're not going to get it
[1:55:10] through study
[1:55:12] now i firmly recommend
[1:55:15] reading your bible every day
[1:55:18] and i firmly recommend reading and
[1:55:20] listening to the message
[1:55:21] constantly
[1:55:25] but without a divine revelation
[1:55:30] you may catch some of the writing on the
[1:55:33] outside of the stone
[1:55:35] but you'll never catch the writing on
[1:55:37] the inside
[1:55:39] that comes by divine revelation
[1:55:42] and that's the mystery that is unlocked
[1:55:45] in our hearts
[1:55:49] hallelujah
[1:55:56] brother ram goes back to junior
[1:55:57] jackson's dream
[1:56:00] he says and junior turned around this is
[1:56:03] 1964 questions and answers from
[1:56:05] august of 64. and junior turned around
[1:56:08] and looked and he seen me going towards
[1:56:09] the west towards the setting of the sun
[1:56:11] going over one mountain another mountain
[1:56:13] real fast just kidding then he turned
[1:56:15] around and looked and seen me gone a
[1:56:17] whole big group of them took off
[1:56:19] that way and they they wanted to go
[1:56:22] this and do that after i told them to
[1:56:24] stay there stay here
[1:56:26] stay right here this is the place then
[1:56:28] when i did that i went just exactly and
[1:56:30] a little bit after that the angel of the
[1:56:32] lord appeared to me
[1:56:33] go out to arizona yonder i heard that
[1:56:35] blast go off and went there
[1:56:36] and what was it the boy dreamed that
[1:56:38] dream just exactly right
[1:56:40] and the lord gave that right remember i
[1:56:42] said there's something i'm going there
[1:56:44] for
[1:56:44] and when i went there it was the mystery
[1:56:46] of the seven seals
[1:56:48] that was sealed up on the inside of that
[1:56:51] mountain of the lord
[1:56:53] the mystery of the seven seals was
[1:56:55] sealed up
[1:56:56] on the inside of the mountain of the
[1:56:59] lord
[1:57:01] that mountain was the word had the word
[1:57:04] around it
[1:57:05] it was the readable part the writing on
[1:57:08] the outside of the book
[1:57:10] but there was something on the inside of
[1:57:13] the book
[1:57:14] that light had never shined on before
[1:57:17] and it was the mystery
[1:57:18] that was laying through the whole bible
[1:57:20] and it was sealed up with seven seals
[1:57:24] and that was the revelation of the seven
[1:57:26] thunders would come forth and
[1:57:27] unlock what that mystery was and here we
[1:57:31] are
[1:57:32] recipients of the interpretation
[1:57:36] of the white stone
[1:57:39] brother remember says in the feast of
[1:57:41] trumpets immediately after that the
[1:57:42] angel of the lord appeared and told
[1:57:44] about the seventh
[1:57:45] or the seven seals that i was a return
[1:57:47] back to jeffersonville and preached the
[1:57:48] seven seals
[1:57:50] there if i've ever said anything that
[1:57:51] was inspired it was in that
[1:57:53] there were the angel of the lord met us
[1:57:55] and the bible became a new bible there
[1:57:56] it opened up and revealed all the things
[1:57:58] that the reformers and things had left
[1:58:00] out
[1:58:00] it was the complete revelation of jesus
[1:58:03] christ
[1:58:04] what is the book of revelation the
[1:58:06] revelation of jesus christ what's the
[1:58:07] whole bible the revelation of jesus
[1:58:09] christ
[1:58:09] what's the mystery of the seven seals
[1:58:11] the complete revelation of jesus christ
[1:58:15] and jesus christ is the revelation of
[1:58:17] the whole thing
[1:58:20] and he's in me and i'm in him
[1:58:25] do you understand i'm i'm in the white
[1:58:28] stone
[1:58:30] do you understand i'm in the thunders it
[1:58:32] was speaking about me
[1:58:34] the uh the mystery i'm part of the
[1:58:36] mystery
[1:58:37] amen christ is the mystery of god
[1:58:39] revealed christ is male and female
[1:58:42] i'm part of the female expression of
[1:58:43] christ amen which is the thought of god
[1:58:46] anointed word for the day amen that's
[1:58:48] who we
[1:58:49] are we are the white mystery that was
[1:58:52] hidden in the rock
[1:58:54] that's what was revealed at the end time
[1:58:57] when he took that sharp tool which was
[1:58:59] a tool to be that he could use it to cut
[1:59:01] the word
[1:59:02] and pop it off and show that there's
[1:59:05] more to this than what we've been
[1:59:07] reading
[1:59:08] you know moses brought the word
[1:59:11] but then the apostle paul he went you
[1:59:14] know the apostle paul had a rigid
[1:59:16] understanding of the old testament
[1:59:20] and in his rigid understanding of the
[1:59:22] old testament
[1:59:23] he called jesus false
[1:59:27] and everything his disciples taught
[1:59:29] heresy
[1:59:32] is that the truth the apostle paul
[1:59:35] he was taught under gamaliel brother bam
[1:59:39] said one of the best schools one of the
[1:59:40] best teachers in all the land
[1:59:42] he had the best of best religious
[1:59:44] upbringing and teaching
[1:59:45] and he knew the word forward and
[1:59:47] backwards and in his rigid
[1:59:49] understanding in his bible school
[1:59:51] knowledge in his
[1:59:52] baptist sunday school literature
[1:59:56] knowledge
[1:59:58] i don't mean to be mean but that's the
[1:59:59] truth
[2:00:02] he had a rigid understanding
[2:00:05] and in that rigid understanding jesus
[2:00:08] christ
[2:00:09] couldn't be him because a
[2:00:10] disqualification and he didn't come and
[2:00:12] he didn't conquer and blah blah blah
[2:00:14] blah blah whatever reasons he had
[2:00:16] they had their case don't you think the
[2:00:18] pharisees didn't have points one through
[2:00:20] ten on why jesus could not be
[2:00:23] come on they knew the word amen don't
[2:00:26] think the devil doesn't know the bible
[2:00:30] he knows the bible he's listened to all
[2:00:34] the tapes
[2:00:36] he was there when they were preached the
[2:00:38] first time
[2:00:41] but he doesn't know the mystery locked
[2:00:44] in my heart
[2:00:44] he doesn't know the white stone inside
[2:00:47] my soul
[2:00:48] he can't get there amen he can get to my
[2:00:50] mind but he can't get down there
[2:00:53] he doesn't know the mystery that's been
[2:00:54] unlocked he doesn't know who i really
[2:00:56] am and whether he believes it or not i
[2:00:59] don't care
[2:01:00] because the seals have been broken in my
[2:01:02] heart
[2:01:04] hallelujah and so paul in his rigid
[2:01:08] understanding couldn't jesus couldn't be
[2:01:10] right what he taught couldn't be right
[2:01:12] and his disciples couldn't be right
[2:01:15] but with one encounter with the pillar
[2:01:17] of fire
[2:01:20] he caught a revelation from god himself
[2:01:23] and went to the desert of arabia and he
[2:01:26] said i was not taught this by man
[2:01:27] neither went to jerusalem but i was
[2:01:30] taught by
[2:01:30] god himself so where did paul get the
[2:01:34] revelation the same place brother
[2:01:35] branham god at the same place moses got
[2:01:37] it
[2:01:38] amen and when he came
[2:01:41] back with the revelation
[2:01:45] totally different than the way he saw it
[2:01:47] before
[2:01:48] i knew not those things when it came to
[2:01:50] me it was totally different than the way
[2:01:52] i had it worked out before
[2:01:53] where did we hear that
[2:01:56] and he came back and he used the
[2:02:00] same bible he used to reject christ now
[2:02:03] he used the same bible to teach christ
[2:02:06] he didn't need a new bible he needed the
[2:02:08] mystery of the bible to be unlocked to
[2:02:10] him
[2:02:11] and christ is the mystery of god
[2:02:13] revealed and christ was the mystery
[2:02:15] through the whole testament
[2:02:17] every prophet the psalms the prophets
[2:02:19] were all speaking of
[2:02:20] him and when paul caught a vision of him
[2:02:24] and the mystery unlocked he could go
[2:02:26] back to the same
[2:02:27] bible and now go from synagogue to
[2:02:32] synagogue
[2:02:33] teaching christ
[2:02:38] brother branham he said at the opening
[2:02:40] of the seven seals my bible became a new
[2:02:42] book to me
[2:02:45] he made no edits or corrections to the
[2:02:48] written text
[2:02:51] but it was all together different than
[2:02:54] he had ever seen it worked out before
[2:02:58] and for us when we catch the revelation
[2:03:01] of this word
[2:03:03] what's was the unwritten portion of the
[2:03:05] mystery
[2:03:06] locked in by seven mysterious thunders
[2:03:09] when god opens that in our heart and we
[2:03:11] see the mystery
[2:03:12] it's god becoming tangible
[2:03:16] it's god becoming flesh
[2:03:19] how in the earth stoned by stone
[2:03:25] see there's a part of you that's from
[2:03:27] earth
[2:03:29] but there's a part of you that's in
[2:03:31] heaven
[2:03:35] then there's another part of you that's
[2:03:36] your soul that can span
[2:03:39] both heaven and earth
[2:03:42] is that true i mean i don't mean to say
[2:03:44] anything wrong but you are seated in
[2:03:46] heavenly places in christ jesus right
[2:03:47] now
[2:03:52] and now we are the living stones
[2:03:56] you see the dirt you see the rocks
[2:04:00] but back inside of there's a white rock
[2:04:04] it's the unwritten portion of my life
[2:04:09] amen there's a mountain
[2:04:14] in the new heaven and new earth that
[2:04:15] pushes out of the earth
[2:04:17] a mountain that pushes out of the earth
[2:04:21] because part of you came out of the
[2:04:22] earth
[2:04:25] but part of you was already there in
[2:04:27] heaven
[2:04:29] which is the heavenly city new jerusalem
[2:04:31] that was here when moses was here
[2:04:33] brother braham said it was right over
[2:04:34] him the whole time
[2:04:36] and you're there and you're here
[2:04:39] so part of the city part of the kingdom
[2:04:42] part of the mountain of god
[2:04:44] pushes up from the earth and the rest of
[2:04:47] it
[2:04:47] comes down from heaven and sits over top
[2:04:50] until heaven and
[2:04:51] earth unite again permanently
[2:04:54] and forever
[2:04:58] where's that white stone
[2:05:02] unwritten party
[2:05:08] brother madam said and feast the
[2:05:10] trumpets
[2:05:12] he said this is the complete revelation
[2:05:14] of jesus christ
[2:05:16] and the seven seals have the mystery hit
[2:05:18] of what it all was
[2:05:19] and is supposed to open it in the last
[2:05:21] day at the laodicean age
[2:05:23] at the end of time thanks be to god that
[2:05:26] finishes the message to the church
[2:05:28] that finishes it when when they look
[2:05:31] back and see
[2:05:32] what has been and see where it's all
[2:05:34] brought up to that finishes at the age
[2:05:36] of the church
[2:05:38] is the church age finished it's finished
[2:05:41] at the opening of the seven seals
[2:05:45] so let's go back to daniel's prophecy
[2:05:49] there's a mountain let's just call this
[2:05:51] mountain the word of god
[2:05:53] or the kingdom of god you can call it
[2:05:56] either one
[2:05:57] the kingdom of god the word of god god
[2:06:00] himself
[2:06:03] and then you've got
[2:06:06] the image of satan's kingdom
[2:06:09] coming by wisdom coming by deception
[2:06:13] coming by splendor and grandeur
[2:06:17] then you have a stone cut out of the
[2:06:19] mountain without hands
[2:06:21] that comes and smites the image in its
[2:06:24] feet
[2:06:26] you know the word of god the bible
[2:06:29] christ is the revelation of god christ
[2:06:32] is the revelation of the bible
[2:06:36] revelation 1 1 the revelation of
[2:06:39] jesus christ

[2:07:41] december 1960 brother branham starts
[2:07:43] into the book of revelations with the
[2:07:45] revelation of the seven church ages
[2:07:47] why because there's coming a stone when
[2:07:49] he gets to those mysterious thunders
[2:07:52] what stone maybe that cloud
[2:07:55] shape pyramid the headstone
[2:07:59] the capstone the headship coming to the
[2:08:02] body

[2:08:04] the holy ghost the full life coming
[2:08:08] where
[2:08:08] coming to unite with what the mountain
[2:08:11] coming up out of the earth
[2:08:13] amen in the revelation coming down from
[2:08:15] heaven to unite once again to cap it off
[2:08:18] to show amen the full declaration of
[2:08:20] christ in bride form
[2:08:24] what is that stone i'll tell you for me
[2:08:26] it's the book of revelation
[2:08:28] the prophet opened it's the seven
[2:08:30] thunders it's the revelation
[2:08:32] of jesus christ that has smashed
[2:08:35] denominational teachings
[2:08:37] smashed the and the harlot
[2:08:39] teaching smashed
[2:08:40] jezebel religion and then now for me i
[2:08:43] don't know about for you
[2:08:45] but for me it has crumbled
[2:08:47] denominationalism
[2:08:48] it has destroyed carnal understanding it
[2:08:51] has ripped apart
[2:08:52] amen the and harlot system and it
[2:08:55] has blown it like the chaff of the wind
[2:08:57] and out of that has grown a mountain
[2:09:00] what mountain
[2:09:01] the mountain of jesus christ how in the
[2:09:04] form
[2:09:04] of his bride amen he's already been
[2:09:07] manifest in fullness in the form of
[2:09:09] jesus christ
[2:09:10] amen but now at the end of the new
[2:09:12] testament it's time for a new testament
[2:09:15] bride
[2:09:16] to rise in the full measure of the new
[2:09:18] testament to display the fullness of
[2:09:20] jesus christ
[2:09:21] in feminine form and that stone which
[2:09:24] was the revelation of jesus christ the
[2:09:26] seven thunders the book of revelation
[2:09:28] the capstone
[2:09:29] the headship call it whatever you want
[2:09:32] whatever makes you feel good it's all
[2:09:34] the same thing coming down and smiting
[2:09:37] this religious system that has worked
[2:09:38] through the gentiles
[2:09:40] from babylon actually from cain through
[2:09:42] nimrod
[2:09:43] all the way from assyria to babylon
[2:09:45] through egypt all the way down through
[2:09:47] and now in the end time by the
[2:09:50] revelation of the white stone
[2:09:52] it has destroyed that and we know the
[2:09:54] truth
[2:09:56] and what is the truth i don't need a
[2:09:58] religion i don't need a priest i don't
[2:09:59] need a man
[2:10:00] i don't need a system i don't need a
[2:10:02] book i don't need somebody's
[2:10:03] interpretation
[2:10:04] why because i was with god before the
[2:10:06] foundation of the world
[2:10:07] god is in me now and i'm going back
[2:10:09] there and it matters not
[2:10:11] amen what happens i'm a recipient of
[2:10:13] grace because my name was written on the
[2:10:14] last book of life
[2:10:15] before the foundation of the world and i
[2:10:18] don't need your system to get me through
[2:10:20] i don't need your arm to lean on i don't
[2:10:22] need your crutch amen because i've
[2:10:24] already
[2:10:25] made it in the mind of god why because i
[2:10:28] am part of god and i am part of the
[2:10:30] expression of god
[2:10:31] amen i'm one of the living stones that
[2:10:33] he is living in
[2:10:34] the shekinah glory of god is behind the
[2:10:37] dirt
[2:10:39] there's a white stone in my soul that's
[2:10:41] a revelation of who i
[2:10:43] am and i don't need a system of man
[2:10:46] they've been blown and scattered
[2:10:49] out of that has grown a mountain of what
[2:10:53] of revelation growing
[2:10:56] growing more word more word
[2:10:59] more word growing until it fills
[2:11:04] the horse
[2:11:07] sometimes we have such wrong
[2:11:09] understanding if there's a mountain that
[2:11:11] fills the whole earth
[2:11:12] everybody would know about it
[2:11:19] jesus was the light of the world
[2:11:26] but the light of the world cannot cure
[2:11:30] willful blindness
[2:11:34] a pharisee standing this close to jesus
[2:11:37] christ
[2:11:38] who was the light of the world saw no
[2:11:41] light
[2:11:43] and because he saw no light didn't mean
[2:11:46] there was no light
[2:11:48] and because you can't see a kingdom
[2:11:50] filling the earth doesn't mean there's
[2:11:51] not a kingdom filling the earth
[2:11:54] because you can't see the light at the
[2:11:56] top of this when the headships come down
[2:11:58] a light arise and shine for thy light
[2:12:01] has come shalom good morning it is the
[2:12:04] rising of the sun
[2:12:05] the world is in darkness and blackness
[2:12:07] the moon's blacked out the sun has
[2:12:09] turned to sackcloth where
[2:12:10] under the sixth seal the earth is under
[2:12:12] judgment and completely blacked out
[2:12:14] blind and cannot see but that doesn't
[2:12:17] mean the light's not here
[2:12:19] because the light is here arise and
[2:12:21] shine for thy light has come and the
[2:12:23] glory of the lord has risen upon
[2:12:25] thee where upon the mountain that has
[2:12:28] filled the earth the throne of god is at
[2:12:30] the top
[2:12:31] shining the light through the whole
[2:12:33] world
[2:12:34] [Music]
[2:12:35] and today there's a bright shining light
[2:12:37] there's a kingdom of god upon this earth
[2:12:39] and it's a bright light that expels all
[2:12:42] darkness
[2:12:42] and all evil and it's the kingdom of god
[2:12:46] and if you can't see it it's not my
[2:12:48] fault
[2:12:50] because jesus came as the light of the
[2:12:51] world and it wasn't his fault if
[2:12:53] somebody couldn't see it
[2:12:56] but i'll tell you something if you can
[2:12:57] see it the gates of the city are open
[2:13:00] day and night
[2:13:02] they never closed you're welcome to come
[2:13:05] into the provided place of worship
[2:13:07] you're welcome to come into christ
[2:13:08] you're welcome to enter into this great
[2:13:10] revelation
[2:13:11] this great mountain that has risen amen
[2:13:13] from the capstone coming
[2:13:14] and smiting the image of the beast now
[2:13:17] it has risen to a mountain with gates
[2:13:18] that stand wide open
[2:13:20] and you're welcome to come if you can
[2:13:22] see it come
[2:13:23] because the spirit and the bride say
[2:13:25] come
[2:13:27] the ministry of the bride has come unto
[2:13:29] this holy mountain come
[2:13:30] under the light of the age come under
[2:13:33] the light of jehovah himself
[2:13:35] the capstone the headship at the top of
[2:13:37] the mountain
[2:13:38] shining the light you don't have to stay
[2:13:40] in darkness you don't have to stay in
[2:13:42] the world
[2:13:42] and you don't have to stay in gentile
[2:13:44] religion
[2:13:46] there is a kingdom on this earth filling
[2:13:48] the whole earth
[2:13:50] and the gates stand open always
[2:13:53] now she has no need of natural light
[2:13:58] no need of the sun no need of the moon
[2:14:05] why because the lamb is the light
[2:14:08] thereof
[2:14:09] and the lamb has come to unite the bride
[2:14:12] and the lamb is the light thereof
[2:14:15] she doesn't need your walled city
[2:14:18] she doesn't need your defense and
[2:14:20] protection
[2:14:22] the lamb is her protection her walled
[2:14:25] city is the word that she's part of
[2:14:28] praise be to god
[2:14:31] let's look at one more scripture
[2:14:33] together
[2:14:37] lots more but we'll get to it some other
[2:14:39] time revelation chapter 2
[2:14:44] verse 17.
[2:14:50] revelation chapter 2 verse 17.
[2:14:58] he that hath an ear let him hear with
[2:15:00] the spirit saith unto the churches
[2:15:03] to him that overcometh will i give to
[2:15:05] eat of the hidden manna and i will give
[2:15:08] him a white stone
[2:15:10] and in the stone a new name written
[2:15:12] which no man knoweth saving he
[2:15:15] that receiveth it
[2:15:19] i will give him the hidden manna what
[2:15:21] hidden man the manna that was behind the
[2:15:22] veil
[2:15:26] the manna that was only reserved for the
[2:15:28] priest
[2:15:30] so you better be a king or a priest to
[2:15:32] come in behind this bail the veil that
[2:15:36] was reserved for a certain specific
[2:15:38] time after the feast of atonement
[2:15:44] the full word because it's the word that
[2:15:47] bled for you the word died for you
[2:15:48] he's going to bring him to the true and
[2:15:50] living word the true and living
[2:15:51] sacrifice the word
[2:15:54] and then the veil is going to be open
[2:15:57] brother branham speaks in a couple
[2:15:58] places of a vision he had and he wrote
[2:16:00] it in a book
[2:16:02] i can't remember the name of the book
[2:16:03] but anyways in the vision he had years
[2:16:05] ago
[2:16:06] there was a veil in the west and now
[2:16:09] behind that there was a mountain of the
[2:16:11] bread of life
[2:16:13] brethren talks about this and searches
[2:16:16] this the time
[2:16:18] he said there was a veil out to the west
[2:16:20] he said there was a mountain of the
[2:16:21] bread of life
[2:16:23] he said lord that's revealed right
[2:16:24] before our face today
[2:16:27] what was that great mountain what's the
[2:16:28] bread of life the word of god that we
[2:16:30] feed on
[2:16:31] christ is the bread of life christ is
[2:16:33] the manna that came down from heaven
[2:16:36] and now he says i will give you the
[2:16:38] hidden manna
[2:16:40] and i will give him a white stone
[2:16:45] stone is a revelation white a pure
[2:16:48] revelation a revelation that only comes
[2:16:52] from god
[2:16:53] no light has shined on this yet
[2:16:58] i'll give him a white stone what's going
[2:17:00] to be
[2:17:01] in that white stone a new name
[2:17:06] which no man knoweth saving he that
[2:17:09] receiveth it
[2:17:10] see brother chad have you received a new
[2:17:12] name you betcha
[2:17:14] what is it does it sound hebrew does it
[2:17:17] have a certain
[2:17:18] exotic ring to it yes it's called mrs
[2:17:21] jesus christ i received a white stone
[2:17:25] and in that white stone was the
[2:17:27] revelation of my
[2:17:28] new name i've always been part of him i
[2:17:31] will
[2:17:32] always be part of him i am part of jesus
[2:17:35] christ
[2:17:35] and i'm here to display the part of mrs
[2:17:38] jesus christ
[2:17:40] i hope you've received your white stone
[2:17:42] with a new name but i've received my
[2:17:43] white stone with a new name
[2:17:45] and because i received that stone to me
[2:17:47] it became a smiting stone that would
[2:17:49] smite all the intellectuals away
[2:17:52] and i say god be praised
[2:17:59] everything in brother branham's life was
[2:18:01] orchestrated and everything meant
[2:18:02] something
[2:18:04] and brother branham comes now in 1964 to
[2:18:07] sabino canyon he comes down
[2:18:08] and there's going to be judgment set in
[2:18:10] because they've rejected christ
[2:18:12] and there's a whirlwind that comes down
[2:18:13] three times and it claps three times and
[2:18:15] it rips the rocks
[2:18:18] out of the wall and cast them all about
[2:18:21] it says judgment striking the west coast
[2:18:23] and there the whirlwind went up and
[2:18:24] alaska nearly sank but i want to ask you
[2:18:27] what did all those little rocks look
[2:18:36] like
[2:18:38] they were all three cornered rocks
[2:18:40] brothers in a pyramid form
[2:18:43] like capstone rocks
[2:18:47] like revelation of the capstone headship
[2:18:49] the word
[2:18:52] what is that there was a headstone come
[2:18:55] down
[2:18:56] and blasted out of the rock you and i
[2:19:01] and now it's not one capstone
[2:19:05] they're scattered all over
[2:19:08] he said what was that little pyramid he
[2:19:10] said the revelation of the oneness of
[2:19:12] god the three or one
[2:19:14] father son and holy ghost in that day
[2:19:16] you'll know i'm in the father
[2:19:17] father and me i in you you and me making
[2:19:20] them all
[2:19:22] one what is the revelation
[2:19:25] i'm part of the capstone i'm part of the
[2:19:27] pyramid
[2:19:28] i'm part of the word i'm part of the
[2:19:30] white mystery that was hid
[2:19:31] behind the print on this paper for
[2:19:34] thousands of years
[2:19:35] that i'm there amen and he busted those
[2:19:37] stones and scattered them all over
[2:19:39] so you can pick one up and realize that
[2:19:41] i am a little stoned
[2:19:43] in the image of the great headstone and
[2:19:45] i'm here to display the mystery
[2:19:47] what is it all that was in god he poured
[2:19:49] into christ
[2:19:50] all that was in christ he poured in the
[2:19:52] church i in you you
[2:19:53] and me amen all making them one amen
[2:19:56] what is it the revelation of the godhead
[2:19:59] includes all the little stones
[2:20:03] [Music]
[2:20:04] includes you and i how did you get that
[2:20:08] brother chad
[2:20:09] because i was given a white stone
[2:20:13] i was given a white stone and at the
[2:20:16] right time god would use a prophet with
[2:20:17] a sharp tool to rip the top off of my
[2:20:19] life
[2:20:20] and shine light on this stone and give
[2:20:21] me a revelation of what my name is
[2:20:23] because he would come in the first seal
[2:20:25] now that he's breaking the seals now
[2:20:26] he's shining the light he comes in the
[2:20:28] first seal and he says now
[2:20:30] i'm no longer going to call you church
[2:20:32] i'm going to call you bride
[2:20:33] so that you'll understand it because
[2:20:36] there's an understanding that can only
[2:20:38] come to bride
[2:20:40] not to church because the church has
[2:20:42] been smashed the denominational church
[2:20:44] but now at the smashing of the smiting
[2:20:47] stone now there's a revelations coming
[2:20:49] and you can only understand if you get a
[2:20:52] new name
[2:20:54] [Applause]
[2:20:54] [Music]
[2:20:56] and now the prophet gave them a new name
[2:20:59] gave us all a new name i no longer call
[2:21:01] you church
[2:21:03] i call you bride
[2:21:06] amen hallelujah if you ever get a white
[2:21:10] stone
[2:21:12] and the prophet ever comes and peels the
[2:21:14] top off and shines the light on that
[2:21:16] white stone
[2:21:17] you'll realize i'm part of god
[2:21:21] an attribute of god misses jesus christ
[2:21:24] an expression of christ
[2:21:26] on earth i can no more be lost than god
[2:21:29] can be lost
[2:21:31] if you get that revelation then just
[2:21:34] watch all the denominational systems
[2:21:36] start
[2:21:36] blowing like shaft in the wind and all
[2:21:39] the
[2:21:40] scare of the enemy and all the fear of a
[2:21:42] point system
[2:21:43] and making good points to please god and
[2:21:46] coming to church every time the doors
[2:21:48] are open so i can go to heaven and
[2:21:51] having to say i believe the message even
[2:21:52] went in my heart i have doubts about it
[2:21:56] if you ever see the white stone
[2:21:58] interpreted to you it'll blow all of
[2:22:00] that away
[2:22:01] all of that chaff of that man-made
[2:22:03] denominational rubbish
[2:22:04] blows away and all of a sudden
[2:22:08] you've got the interpretation of your
[2:22:11] white stone
[2:22:13] because it's your new name personally
[2:22:17] to you not because a preacher said it
[2:22:19] not because mom and dad said it
[2:22:20] not because brother branham said it in
[2:22:22] the first seal but because god himself
[2:22:25] revealed my position to me and he gave
[2:22:27] me the stone and he revealed to me my
[2:22:29] new name
[2:22:30] in a pure revelation that comes from
[2:22:33] father god
[2:22:34] himself praise god
[2:22:38] let's all stand musicians if you could
[2:22:40] come
[2:22:43] hallelujah god is good friends
[2:22:48] and i love him with my whole heart
[2:22:51] i tell you this revelation is
[2:22:55] more than anything to me i'd rather have
[2:22:57] this revelation than have my next breath
[2:23:01] i'd rather have this revelation than my
[2:23:02] next meal job home
[2:23:04] it doesn't matter i'd rather have this
[2:23:06] revelation and if we catch this
[2:23:07] revelation
[2:23:08] who cares if you lose your job tomorrow
[2:23:10] who cares if your house burns down the
[2:23:12] next day
[2:23:12] and all your friends tell you you're
[2:23:14] crazy with this revelation
[2:23:16] everything's gonna be fine because all i
[2:23:18] got to do is portray christ in whatever
[2:23:20] measure he wants for this little bitty
[2:23:22] space of time
[2:23:23] and then i realize i've got a millennium
[2:23:25] i got a new heavens and new earth i've
[2:23:27] got
[2:23:27] everything my heart's ever long for is
[2:23:29] here and coming to me
[2:23:31] amen and coming in greater manifestation
[2:23:33] it doesn't matter anymore
[2:23:35] government rises government falls it
[2:23:37] matters not to me anymore
[2:23:39] people complain people leave people come
[2:23:42] it matters not anymore
[2:23:44] why because of the revelation of my name
[2:23:46] in the white stone that's why it doesn't
[2:23:48] matter
[2:23:49] because my position is secure my
[2:23:51] revelation is solid
[2:23:52] i'm not going anywhere
