========================================

for so long i searched for life's meaning enslaved by the world in [Music] then the door of my prison was opened my love for the ransom was paid i was free thank you jesus i'm free from the fear of tomorrow and i'm free from the guilt of my past [Music] [Music] at foreign thank you jesus i am free from the guilt that i carried from the door i'm set free [Music] for when i met [Music] jesus he made me complete he forgot the foolish man i used to be thank you jesus i'm free from the fear of tomorrow thank you jesus and i'm free from the guilt of my past for i traded my shackles for a glorious song i'm free praise the lord free at last i'm free from the fear of tomorrow yes i'm free from the guilt of my past for i traded my shackles for a glorious song and i'm free to praise the lord free at last for i've traded my shackles for a glorious song i'm free praise the lord free at last [Music] i'm free praise the lord [Music] yes i'm free praise the lord free at last for there is [Applause] [Music] that is what i want to do i give you praise for you are my righteousness there is none like you you can all be seated for a moment praise the lord it's a special day for us and it's good to have our brother yatzik here brother yahset wallach from poland he's a pastor there in poland and if you'll remember when brother ben and i were in uh poland last year when we went through eastern europe that was one of our stops and i remember i told you that that was a lovely place to minister it was a good place for me amen i was so blessed when we got there and saw the church and the church was in order and when i was preaching it was just like being here it was freedom and the spirit to preach and while i was preaching there was such a pull and such freedom as that these people are being taught the word amen and it was a good feeling and it was a good homey feeling a good place to be and so it's it's a pleasure to have brother yatzik here and minister the word and i'm looking forward to it to myself i always enjoy feeding on the word we've had good fellowship thus far he came in uh late last night they had a problem with a plane that seems to be normal when you travel sometimes and got rerouted and it took them longer to get here but praise god they're here amen and they're able to minister minister for us tonight and sunday so be praying be pulling tonight and be praying for sunday also brother nathan mazur god bless you brother nathan's here traveling with him brother nathan's the head of his musicians there at his home church actually brother nathan's got a special for us nathan if you want to come forward and get ready for that special you can go ahead and get ready for that he's going to sing a song that his brother joel wrote and then we're just going to let him introduce his pastor with this special and then brother yahtzee can take the pool but as soon as he's done but remember we didn't come here to be entertained we came here to eat yes amen the lord is going to be serving it up through the vessel that he's chosen tonight but it's our duty to take it from his hands and feed on it amen and i don't know about you but i come hungry i come expecting i come looking to get my portion amen and if nobody else gets theirs i'm going to get mine because that's why i came to church i didn't come to be seen i didn't come out of a tradition i didn't come out of an obligation i came with joy and expectation that i'm going to get something wonderful from the hand of my savior tonight and if you guys are like me and we're all in the same mind we're going to have a wonderful service amen it was a pleasure to be in brother yahtzek's church and i felt like as i began to minister and the people there began to pull that i could just set my wings and fly and it was a pleasure to preach and i'd like you to help me to return the favor let's make it a pleasure for our brother to preach just that he could just slip into that channel where he's got absolute liberty and we pull on the word and where god can use him in freedom amen god bless you brother nathan is there anyone worthy [Music] there was no one found john was hopeless as he cried but then he heard a voice that spoke to his troubled heart victorious he stands the battle is over so lift up your voice and praise the lion of judah prevail victorious he stands he's worthy of our honor and praise [Music] our voice is [Music] he came down to open the seals he revealed himself to us now we know our names are placed in the book of life victorious he stands the battle is over so lift up your voice and praise the lion of judah prevail victorious he stands he's worthy worthy of our honor and [Music] lion praise victorious he stands the battle is over so lift up your voice and praise victorious he stands he's worthy worthy of our honor and he's worthy worthy of our honor and praise shalom my brothers and my sisters amen i greet you in the precious and lord jesus christ for the privilege and joy for us to be here in the middle of the week and gathering in his name i believe that uh you are under expectation and you pray for me truly in my heart i'm just expecting something from his side because uh you know we are coming here in his name and uh you know under expectation and we we should we should be focused on him and it's indeed the truth that's when but the chat and uh benjamin was in our place last year was really a blessing i'm just looking around to see by the benjamin i don't know if he's in the meeting or not he didn't wave me yet but he's somewhere not here okay anyways you know god bless you brother and uh but chat he was preaching for us it was a really really uh wonderful time we didn't know each other before it was the brothers from serbia that uh kind of orchestrated this meeting you know and called me up with a desire to meet together last year and they proposed by the chat his ministry because they said they are going to be there with brother benjamin so i said well just we don't know each other we never met each other but i listened one sermon some years ago he preached on the cloud you know and the importance of the you know who came down really in that age and i really appreciate it when he took a stand and he just uh protect you know something that is so precious for us for the bride of christ and i said just you was such a tremendous wonderful meeting and in fact it was the only one i heard but it was such a good one so i said just come come come all of you and we had a wonderful wonderful time of fellowship and that's probably how i'm here first time in ohio and i appreciate real song of the nathan maybe 20 minutes ago i just asked him uh you know are you going to sing something maybe on the way to the church he said yes but maybe 20 minutes ago i asked him uh uh what's what's your song and he said the the line of the type of judah prevailed i said i didn't say anything but this is my scripture for for tonight maybe a little few verses forward but from revelation 5 and i really like to see the little things how they are dovetailing because it gives you encourage uh you know that the lord is with us and he's working through the body so may the lord bless you you have to understand in my english i never learned english in any school and so my english is kind of maybe kentucky english or whatever it's from the tapes i really many many years ago almost 30 years ago i i i start to learn and i promise to the lord that if he will bless me with understanding that language and i will use it for his glory i wanted to understand and also speak and he gave me grace of both maybe i'm not a professional but still i can communicate and preach the word of god and i believe that it will help me will be a blessing for all of us because we are not here to preach ourselves to be focused on us on the human side humanistic realm but we are here to hear from him and so may the lord bless you i will not just keep you too long i will try to do that uh the brothers by the chat he gave me a really liberty but i said no no no i will not preach so long as you offer me even i i want to really go to the point and just uh but also i want to just give him a liberty of the holy spirit to move the way he wants uh you know because we are the um creatures of eternity we are not just we are really a time timely bound but we know those things on a daily basis but we are more than these we are more than these elements that bound us and put to the pest house we are the we came from above we are coming back uh to our position like jesus when he came down he said i'm coming for the father i'm coming back to the father we know we've been part of him from the beginning in him he was our voice in those days we are his voice today so we know we are coming back and we are the creatures of uh eternity so god bless you i ask you to stand up we read first from the song of solomon song of solomon chapter 2 the second chapter of song of solomon from the verse 10 up to 15 and greetings from our assembly from the south of poland poland as some of you may be know this is really a catholic country 97 97 percent of population of our country is the catholics but anyways you know god placed us there to represent him and it doesn't matter because uh even he said some good things about the catholics how the catholics coming to the prayer line they've got tremendous faith because they were taught for years that god is using a human body to communicate to unveil himself you know and we know that finally in our age we know it is working like that so even the protestants they've got a problem today they were very very close to god but they they are depending on the experiences different things so much and they didn't recognize that god promised in the last age he will send us a human being someone in the spirit of elijah with a ministry to turn our hearts back to the hearts of our fathers and you know he used a man he always used a man and many times the people they've got a great faith until they will see god is using a man they are very uh offended because they they would prefer the angel but god doesn't use the angels this way to preach the gospel he is using human beings so we are very very privileged very happy in those days to to have an open ear and living heart to trying to absorb the things the lord stored for us in that age amen so the song of solomon second chapter from the verse 10 my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away for law the winter is past the rain is over and gone certain season is passed the winter is past you've got a similar winter like in poland it's really really freezing you know it's it's cold you know but when this uh that season is past the new season is open and we i believe that we understand the bible in the in the way we shoot you know the old testament was written in the symbols it was it was a shadow of the new things that came in the new testament especially in our time we understand you know the value of the bible because the bible became a new book for us god took away the condemnation that always we we look uh from the uh perspective of the condemned person to the bible we're trying to understand it but uh you know the shadow that was hanging over us was not allowing us really to to catch the real meaning what was in the world but we are living in the the golden age the the the best time we could live so we can see uh we understand these symbols it's not the symbols anymore it's a revelation for us so the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth amen the manifestation of the seed is not the seed anymore but the flowers appeared and the time of the singing of birds is come praise god the voice of the turtle is heard in our land the fig tree put it forth her green fix and the wine with the tender grape give a good smell arise my love my fair one and come away all my doves that aren't in the clefts of the rock in the secret places of the stars let me see thy countenance let my hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is calmly this is really a book about a relationship about the uh really very close contact of the bride and the bride room how the man and the woman are coming together and they are praising each other and this is really on the level that we cannot understand unless we are in the same relationship so we know the bible is uh is a book of mystery for many people but it's the mystery is broken when the relationship is coming together of these two take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines for our vine vines have tender grapes my beloved is mine and i'm his he fitted among the lilies and he's speaking about the union of the christ and the bride the mystery of god that was hidden in the bible in every chapter every verse but now the mystery is open because the mystery of the marriage the union god and the man again and now let's open revelation 5. revelation 5 but then nathan he sunk revelation 5 1 up to five i will just read from the sixth verse up to ten revelation five six up to ten and i beheld and law in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood the lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou has slain and has redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we have we shall reign on the earth amen let's bow our heads the word of prayer our precious heavenly father we deem this as a great privilege tonight to be gathered together in thy name lord jesus let us go into the spirit of composer of this great heavenly music that was written on the pages of the bible father let us go into the harmony of your spirit and understand the things that you want to express and manifest among us tonight because we don't want to be focused only on the history as we know that such a great manifestations and the great things happen in the history we are eyewitnesses oh god how faithful you've been in the past but we are desiring oh god for tonight holy spirit to move in our hearts dealing with us in a personal way dealing with us oh god and unveiling the the page of that great book that uh is is open right now and to see you in the present moment to see the present truth revealed for us in such a personal way oh god that will understand not only the the you know the manifestation but also going to the mind of the composer of this great music and to understand our position that is absolutely sure that you have chosen us before the foundation of the world and you predestinated us to our position and no one is able to take our position lord so we will be thankful and just be be open or to understand this quiet little voice of the supernatural music that is revealed in the last days oh god we are so thankful father so let us go in the spirit and just understand and just leave this building tonight as a change people lord with a closer walk with a closer understanding with a deeper more profound insight to the mystery of god bless the people here tonight and just help me to express your purpose for tonight and just bless the scripture we read we appreciate so much the bible and the open book the living bible in those days just we give you praise and honor for everything you have done already and you are going to do for thy glory in the precious name of lord jesus christ amen so god bless you take your seats amen amen so my subject my little subject is the unwritten song of solomon unwritten song of solomon and we know that uh the bible is written in a very special way this is a bible bible as a book that uh there's no book in this world that we can compare with the bible because the bible is written in such a harmony we know that god used so many people in the space of so many years you know and all these chapters all these uh books of the bible they are written in such a harmony that no prophet no apostle never rise up uh contradicting by writing the his book you know contradicting the another part of the bible that was written before so that's the reason we're supposed to appreciate you know that the bible as the the holy book god in the printed form and because god is able and he's willing always to speak to us by these verses but you know that uh the biggest challenge is to go into the spirit of the bible to go into the spirit of uh uh you know author of the bible which is a god himself the problem of the so many denominations and contradictions between the one and another is that the people they are trying to understand in their own carnal way reading the bible that we read but they are not trying to go in the spirit of of uh outer of the bible and it causes a clash after clash after clash misunderstanding people they are just uh discouraged they don't understand they are living trying to join they're living you know but if we are able to go into the spirit of the outer of the bible which is that god himself he's the author of the of that book you know there is no contradiction there is no confusion it's always such a wonderful experience when god is open his own word for you and me in a personal way and this is my expectation for tonight i know that our time is limited but holy spirit is here and he's he was he's going to deal with your heart my heart in a personal way because you and and me before him he knows you by name he knows me by name and you know we are here as a group but he is going to deal with you in a personal way that's the way he is doing the job always and uh you know we supposed to go to the spirit of composer because the bible is written like a music in a certain harmony i don't mean uh you know modern music this is a chaos this is really something against the heartbeat something against you know that was for for uh ages centuries it was working like this even the secular music was still in a certain rhythm that was right but now in the last uh uh hundred years was a change of the the beat change of the music change of their rhythm you know and now even the uh so-called christian churches you know accepted you this modern way of expressing the music and it's absolutely wrong we know this is not right but the bible is written in the harmony no contradiction like in the right kind of music so that's the reason you know uh if we can go into the understanding of the deeper things we have to just be in the relationship with god and you know the when the salomon has written uh the the book this we call it a song of solomon which is like uh the the song about all songs you know uh he has written uh eight chapters and if you carefully study you know this book in these eight chapters you will find uh six songs there's a six songs included in eight chapters and we know that god runs with the numbers we we cannot go into that tonight it's not necessary you understand that it's you know bible is not written haphazardly this is really something lost uh is coming right from the mind of god it's perfect there is no fault in the bible and you know if the solomon we know that he was living in the golden age we know there is there was no age like this in the old testament when god was identified so much with the human flesh like a solomon and the people around him around the gift that was given to solomon we know that it was uh called even the golden age in the old testament it was a prototype of the millennial reign for thousand years in in future it was such a great moment such a great time but we know it was a beginning it was a final end of the reign of solomon because a solomon he was such a great man he got the gift of wisdom he got the gift of discernment but we know still as much his position was he received just a gift and a gift was given by god to him and we know the gifts uh are all right as on as long as they are connected with the out of the gifts and we know as long as the uh solomon was enough humble to listen the advices of god and he was staying in the relationship with god himself you know his kingdom was unshakable no one was able to defeat the kingdom and we know never no one defeated the kingdom from outside as long as salomon was was a king but we know there was a final time when he lost his position and his connection with god was not as he was at the beginning he was losing his authority he was losing his position and his kingdom uh was fall to pieces from inside that's mostly how the people they don't expect the enemy they think the enemy is always coming from outside but you know the reason why the kingdom of solomon with the golden age with such a authority he had that all the other nations around have to respect salomon and pay uh you know offerings different things you know expressing the you know that they they are in agreement you know about his position why it was changed because uh salomon was equipped with a gift you know and we have to compare it quickly with the new testament with our time why god promise that will rise up the group of people in the last days that won't be shaken won't be deceived cannot be defeated was there was a difference we know that paul apostle paul in the book of ephesians he was praying for ephesians which was the most spiritual church that was given grace to him to speak to to them we know he said i pray to the father that the god will give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation there is a difference between the gift of wisdom and the spirit of wisdom there is a difference between the discernment and the spirit of discernment because the gift of discernment a gift of wisdom can fail it will just disconnect the god himself with the gift that he gave to you and you will depend on the gift doesn't matter what kind of gift it is you will disconnect yourself by this connected relationship with the god himself he's the author or every good gift and that's what solomon did finally he trusted you know the women let's say churches he trusted you know he was dependent on himself on the gift he had he never lost the gift but he lost relationship am i right so you know his gift failed but you know when jesus cried jesus christ has come he said the greater the solomon is here right now and we are living in the same age we are living a golden age like a solomon was living in a golden age of the old testament when jesus christ has come first time it was a golden age it was a crowning of the old testament the all the prophets you know the the wise men they were just writing predicting pointing of the moment when jesus christ has come and he said he himself he said greater than solomon is here right now and we know there was a alpha time and god predicted the omega time will be a group of people in the last days or so with the golden age we are living in a golden age which is the harvest time reproduction of the same seed that was planted 2 000 years ago is reproductive today again so we can see that we can compare the days of solomon with the days of the first coming of the lord and the days of the second coming of the lord you can see you know how it's related to each other the reason why the bride of christ cannot fail we are not depending on the gifts [Music] we are not depending even of the gift of wisdom discernment different gifts around us god gave it to the church many years ago even when the pentecostals rise up that god poured out his spirit upon the people more than thousands more more than 100 years ago it was a restoration of the gifts but with the gifts people will fail he will not just continue to walk in the light of the revelation of his word there is something more than the gift of wisdom there is a spirit of wisdom and spirit of wisdom is god himself and the paul he was praying for the ephesians they will receive the spirit of wisdom and revelation which is a holy spirit god himself living in us amen he will stay in the spirit of revelation spread our wisdom we cannot fail amen because the word of god cannot fail this is the reason why solomon failed but you know before he failed he has written something three books we know that that are part of the bible and they are absolutely inspired absolutely real you know and the book of solomon the song of solomon contains a six songs and we know the six is a good number but this is not the the best number because number seven is a number that represents completion perfection and the salomon even when he was inspired he was writing 1005 songs and three thousand proverbs when he was writing a song of solomon it was a special song special book contains six songs but he was not able to come to the seventh one because god was hiding certain mystery in the old testament for the people of the new testament it was the mystery of the union perfect union between the man and god you know so that we want to just look on the solomon and this book the the song of solomon because this describes relationship in the prophetic form many things that the solomon has written is a prophecy prophecy for the end time prophecy that describes a union that is going to be restored in the last days between the man and god again union that existed first time in the garden of eden when god and the man adam on the earth they're a perfect way of communication the channel of communication was so pure that god could communicate with adam perfectly because adam was on the level of god he was on the level god was speaking even thinking and ana was able to just catch it and speak it out what god thought you know in heaven adam was able to speak it out on the earth it was a perfect way of communication but it was lost but god promised i'm going to restore it i'm going to restore it back so we have to look on the bible watch it carefully because god gave in the old testament certain signs signs and points you know that he will just trace it we can see how this great story of restoration can unveil before our eyes you know so first of all the song of solomon is a dialogue it's a description of the dialogue between the bride and the bride room and it's such a great thing that uh many people even the theologians you know that probably theologians they were against that book to put it as a part of the bible because they said it's so small almost nothing about god mentioned in that book and they say how it's such a book that you can you can read it and sometimes you think you you can draw conclusions that you you think my goodness this is part of the bible yes whole scripture whole bible is inspired every verse every scripture is inspired and god just took decision to put these books in the bible that he put put in for us for our edification correction encouragement that's the reason it's such a supernatural book and only way how we can understand this book we have to come to the relationship with the author of that book that's the reason if someone is not born again cannot understand this book many people are trying to explain understand explain even their fasting about this book the meaning of the verses different things but we can understand that book on the one base it must be a personal revelation of jesus christ for you this is a new birth when we are coming to a new birth experience we are coming right to his kingdom then the things that we couldn't see before we can see clearly you are receiving a new sight new sense of hearing clear-cut hearing clear-cut scene you are getting a new sense of understanding of the things that before you are just only presuming that's the reason a new birth is so important in every church even today people they they think they are born again born again but they are not fruits of the being born again no understanding law no revelation no power to overcome but those things are coming by the new birth experience by the new birth experience you are coming to the the most close relationship with god that you can imagine amen so when he wrote you know the six songs in the eight chapters there was a certain mystery that was hidden even before solomon salomon was a great man he was a very wise man but he let's say he didn't understand what is uh what is coming after a person passes away when the person is is dead what the next he said he said the life doesn't make really a meaning and you know you can you can you can just collect the things you know you can you can be a good you can you can work properly you get a house property different things he said but what about you who will just take it after you so he didn't understand you know what he said he gave a question what is about the human being after he passed away he didn't know he didn't know the mystery of the resurrection he didn't know the the life after death he didn't know those things because it was filled up before him but god you know like for the most of the prophets of the old testament he was giving them a certain glimpse of the mystery for each and every one of the prophet he gave a certain glimpse like for jeremiah isaiah solomon david moses all of them they describe one mystery one mystery in the bible from their perspective okay but you know god allows us the people of the new testament the people of the open book he allows us to see the things in a real way not from the certain perspective but from the real perspective you we can see the things not there partitionally but in a real way and it's possible only by the holy ghost only by the holy ghost that's the reason you need to have a holy ghost as a person amen then you are coming to the relationship that adam lost he couldn't communicate anymore because he just dropped down from the higher dimension the lower dimension you know he struggled he was he was more focused how to survive there was no peace like before there was no joy like before there was no connection with god like before understanding was known like that he lost even the vocabulary that he had excess before all those things happened before he lost the relationship but god promised i'm going to restore it i'm going to restore it praise god so the the song of solomon is the description how this uh two people are thinking about each other in such a wonderful way as we said the people they think this book is uh they've got a different thoughts i don't know about you but you can have a different thought thoughts about this book but if you are coming to understanding that the bible is a supernatural book and you cannot understand that book from your level you have to just come up higher you have to come to the dimension where god exists you have to come to the spirit of the outer of that book then the things that you before understood in carnal way you finally understand in a real way that's what we need as a christian amen so there was a dialogue of the two lovers and they were praising each other you know uh in such a way there was so much in love you know that the mystery of the union between the man and god is included there how christ that before we we thought how who is you know every denomination describes christ and they say we've got the uh our our denomination is absolute our understanding is is right you are wrong you know but we we can see it cannot be this way must be one channel amen one place chosen by god place of the meeting and the union and understanding only one place and this place is in christ and christ is the mystery of god revealed and when we are coming into christ by the baptist of the holy spirit we've got access to his being then he is in you you are in him then these two they are one then he will praise you for your decision because he cannot praise no one else only himself because he is the world he cannot praise pentecostals because if god will praise pentecostals then it means he rejected methodists if you just uh chosen baptist or seven adventists you know he would have to reject the other denomination but he doesn't deal with denomination even your denomination my denomination if you have i i have one just sometimes the people can be domination but god doesn't care about your denomination he doesn't pay attention to our denomination he says come out come out of her come out of your understanding come out of your of your tradition denomination whatever stops you you have to come to the relationship you have to come to the union amen and we can see that uh you know if this book was written in the golden age in order to understand that book and the things that the solomon has written in his six songs you have to go to the golden age because you cannot understand a man and he's talking about something if you don't go in his shoes you have to understand his language you have to understand the experience what he experienced his life why he's writing this why he's talking like that why why what happened in his life then you can come to understanding and you know the song of solomon chapter 5 from the verse 10 chapter 5 verse 10 the bible says this is a bride praises her beloved one my beloved is white and rudy and jeffers among the thousands so she praises him amen the bride praises the bride room and she's sure that there's no one like he that's what you have to do in your life to be sure if there is anything better follow it but there is nothing better than christ follow him and only him be sure there is no one like him jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever there's no one like him today so she praises him because she's sure she praises him because she fall in love in him his head is as the most fine gold his head is my headship his head is like the most fine gold his logs are bushy and black as raven his eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters wars with milk and fitly said so she is absolutely fall in love in him she praises him you know how you can understand someone that will praise someone like a woman praises a man or man praises the woman if you are not in the same relationship you can understand it that's the reason this book is misunderstood that's the reason even christians are misunderstood because when you are falling in love in christ you will do the things that usually people around you they will not do and you cannot even explain it how someone is in love with someone can explain his action if the love is supernatural you cannot miss your love you cannot wait laugh because it's supernatural you cannot even measure peace and joy because all those elements are supernatural and and this book describes those things this is a different language this is language that you can understand only if you are falling in love so his head is as the most fine gold and his eyes are as the eyes of doves so he's using the symbols and he says the bride is glad of his head which is intelligence that's how the solomon described it he said he his his head is so is such a authority for her she's fall in love in him and she praises his head and he compares his hair to the god the pure is god amen she compares his eyes to deaths amen so he she says other words his intelligence i accept it i rest in his intelligence in his head i rest in his type of vision whatever he can see the dove is the type of the holy ghost innocent innocent perfect i'm resting in his vision i'm resting in his intelligence i'm just i i love him i praise him [Music] you know that uh the bible describes the most precious gold in the old testament let's open book of isaiah book of isaiah chapter 13. from the verse 9 so she can see his head as the most fine god what's the meaning of the most fine god isaiah chapter 13 from the verse 9 behold the day of the lord cometh cruel both with wrought and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it for the stars of heaven and their constellations thereof shall not give daylight the sun shall be darkened in his going forth and the moon shall not cause her light to shine isaiah can see the sixth seal he's describing a judgment we are facing the judgment what we can see around the world right now what's going on in every continent every nation more or less but this is judgment because the rejection of the world and isaiah can see the sixth seal that it developed to to really the horrible pictures things you know that we believe the bride won't be here but we know that many times the sixth seal and the seven syllables connected not only because they are so close to each other but we know that we've been redeemed under the sixth seal but our names was revealed in the seventh one because the sixth seal is a single judgment and god required judgment because all of us have been born in sin shame iniquity we came to this world to to say lie that's the reason god's requirement was a judgment because he cannot just say okay i don't see your sin he see he sees our sins he said where are we that's the reason he took our judgment upon himself two thousand years ago it was our sixth seal requirements of god was met we've been redeeming him when he said it's finished it was finished your sin was finished once forever it's done you are free but if someone will reject it or just not accepted in the way god requires you know there is no seven seal there is no perfection there is no rest there is no deliverance there is no revealing of your your name people they will stay in the sixth seal for purification but when isaiah describes sixth seal he's coming to something else and he said i will punish the world for their evil and their wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the urgency of the proud to cease and will lay low the hatchness of the terrible now the verse 12 listen i will make a man more precious than a fine gold amen all of south in the midst of the sixth seal he is something about he's telling about a different group he says i will make a man more precious than i find gold to find gold the best gold i will make a man more value than the best gold you can find even a man than the gold wage of offir and we know that in the old testament the days of solomon it was the best gold available it was the gold from ophir they imported you know by ships this gold and that's the way how the temple of solomon was built up the resting place for great jehovah he came down in the cloud he was dwelling the place but it was built up in all these places by god and uh you know when this goal was found and imported it was the goal of offir and ofir was not in israel it was imported it was from the gentiles it was from the hidden country amen it was showing something that god will find a special type of material very plastic that you can mold you know that is not affected by water with a great value and it will be found in a gentle countries from among the gentiles will be taken and will be just say used for they build their sanctuary for god himself in the new testament amen in the days of summon he was looking for this great very value of fear goat and when he was imported he built up the place of the rest for great jehovah all those things was only a typing of the new testament and the hour we are living right now if you think that a certain generation will come or the age will come when all those things will be fulfilled that was predicted and and uh played as the prototype way before you are wrong because won't be any other generation we are living in the final generation this is the harvest time this is a golden age we came to the hour of zero [Applause] when the rocket must go this is hour of the rapture this is the hour where all the prophets and apostles predict they spoke about are pointing on the type of people will rise up in the last days without a spot without a wrinkle amen perfect group of people not in themselves but by the perfect word when you receive that perfect word you are as perfect as the word you received if you receive that particular word partition revelation that is all you can reflect but this is an hour of perfection amen amen amen so isaiah he saw the day he said i will make a man more precious than a fine gold gold is a deity in the bible you know that every one of you even from the sunday school even children know it the gold is a deity i will make a man like a deity not only jesus christ he was the first one but i will just manifest more like he is that's the reason he's a he's the firstborn among the brethren yes amen he calls us his brothers because we are coming from the same source we forgot it we lost the awareness of that but we are part of the same source which is a divine source god is the source of you and me as jesus he said i came from the father i'm coming back to the father you can say the same in that age you can say the same i'm coming from god i'm coming back to god this is a rapture season rapture time harvest time golden age when the man and god they became one i will make a man more precious than i find gold i will make it who spoke it god i'm going to do it i will start your journey i will finish your journey don't worry i'm going to do it i will achieve in your life because he is a altar and a finisher of our faith do you love him praise god in the song of solomon chapter 2 verse 4 he brought me to the banqueting house he brought me the bride room brought the bride where to the prison to the desert the desolation no poverty no sickness no he brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was love he waves his love over me he loves me amen brother sister you understand that this is maybe basic but you have to understand every day a new way he loves me he loved me first and this is only base how i can love him i have to understand by revelation he has chosen me he loved me before the foundation of the world then you can serve him you cannot serve him without understanding of redemption no ministry nothing no praise no offer nothing to god without first understanding he redeemed me he has chosen me he loved me amen he's chosen me in love his banner over me was love it was revelation no condemnation no prejudice just a pure honest profound love where around the bank of the house bunking the house around the table feasting together with him bride in the bride room the bride's room he brought me to the place where i can feast with him but now he promised us full square meal the full seven course menu for all the seven seeds are open and everything is ready for the word of god to those who can receive it amen amen is ready seven seals not six years seven seals not just as six songs there is somewhere the seven one there's a message for the bride there's a hidden mystery for the bride [Applause] where you can find it in the bank of the house he brought me there to only chosen place of worship he brought me there i'm sitting with him around the table there's a seven course menu seven series i'm eating i'm feasting amen finally understood all the way of redemption [Music] why my life was so complicated why i had up and down here why just i i failed here why i was living for years under condemnation god knew it he was he was dealing with us he was dealing with his gold molding his plastic goat molding your character you think i lost some years you didn't lose anything there is no condemnation for the bride she is sitting around the same table with the son of man seven seats are open everything is ready for you if you can receive it all you have to do just receive it say lord jesus i believe it i believe this revelation i believe unveiling of god in the last days i believe i am living the golden age this harvest time i understood i am the wheat we produce wheat amen he was the first one son of man jesus christ i am manifestation unveiling of him because he's the head i am the flesh how god can he reveal himself it wouldn't be no one on this earth he doesn't do it by angels he does by human beings he said i will make a man like a pure god i'm going to do it hallelujah song of solomon 2 7. i charge you all you daughters of jerusalem by the rose and by the hands of the field that you steer not up nor awake my love till he please you know the real love you cannot awake you cannot just do it prematurely uh it must come time for it because there is a time for hatreds there is a time for love there is a time for everything if there is a time for certain season you cannot change it but you know first of all the bible teaches us that he has chosen us in himself before the foundation of the world in love you you could do nothing to stir up the love in his heart you cannot deserve for the grace you cannot do anything amen for his love but before you've been born he has chosen you because he loved you amen that's what the poll he teaches book of ephesians chapter one fourth and fifth verse according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love or before him in law of in fear in self-righteousness being religious in tradition no we are chosen in him in love amen he loves you you understand that you understand about revelation train your heart for revelation he loved you before the foundation of the world nothing can stop you young people nothing can stop you there's no demons in this world to stop the bride if she will be able to understand he loved me in himself before the foundation of the world and he protested me to be holy without blame having procrastinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will it was a good pleasure of his will we are not saved because we wanted to be saved we are not christians because we wanted to be christians we are christians because he has chosen us in himself it was according to good pleasure of his will that before you've been born he loved you he placed something into you he couldn't just love our human part but he placed his own seed into you and now when the city is open understanding came to you amnesia is move on you can praise him as he prays you all the bible describes how sure is our salvation how perfect is the redemption how how the prize is enough how he conquered death how he made you overcomer all those things are in the bible but we have to read from the open book if we are under the cloud of condemnation you cannot see that because there is a power of the enemy holding you anytime you want to just make a step forward he holds you he gives you conditions he tells you explains the word of god you cannot do it this is not for you because you you you are not faithful you didn't do this you didn't do that but the gospel is not the gospel the real one is not the gospel of do's and don'ts no amen it's given us by grace salvation by grace being a bride of christ by grace amen amen [Music] hallelujah praise god now the song of solomon 2 12 the flowers appear on the earth flower is the manifestation of the seed and the flower is not the seed flour is an expression of the seed and the flower is in the seed but you cannot see the flower until the seed dies got rotten and manifest itself when everything around the seed dies and the germ of the flower inside is activated it manifests what was in the seed and the solomon he noticed and he understood the difference between the seed and the fruit seed and the flower we have to understand that this is not the hour of the seed we've been the seed but this is the hour of manifestation that's the reason we are the flowers we are those flowers such a different colors all of us different different features from different countries different names your background is different different flowers god wanted to have us as a different flowers a corner type of seed he plays in you before the foundation of the world flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of

people if the marriage is a mystery for you it should be it should be if this is mystery you think what is the mystery of the successful marriage look around find find a marriage that is really working properly on the right basis holy spirit is inside amen and the men husband they are one they are in union then you can see manifestation of the mystery of the marriage and the mystery is not any more mystery because you can see what is a real marriage amen so if god and the men united together in the golden age in the harvest time it must be [Music] that was postponed for future it must be today we must be ready for the rapture that's the reason the birds of paradise are singing in the saints heart hallelujah hallelujah song of solomon chapter 4 verse 10. now the bride room is

he has chosen you he has fascinated you he called you he justified you he glorified you he sealed you up even before the foundation of the world but the bride in that form she's asking for that she doesn't understand how deep it is she says set me as a seal upon thy heart as a seal upon thy arm for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave the cause thereof are cause of fire which

the seventh one seven is a perfection completion the end of the story all the six ones were leading only the seventh one where is the seventh one brother he calls the revelation 5. the most outstanding scripture in the whole bible amen amen the most profound revelation 5 redemption no one was worthy jesus he paid the price but john typing the bride he was not aware in that moment he was not aware he was looking back and he knew that he he paid the price if he will not stand up no one would stand up to claim everything would be lost everything would turn back to the atoms and molecules because everything was polluted by sin jesus paid the price he said it's finished but he never claimed his position possession he never claimed his inheritance until revelation 5. he was the only one he stood up he took the book he opened seven seals amen and something happened to john he was whipping wailing apostol walking with jesus walking with paul leaving as the last one of the all apostles typing the pride but he was whipping in revelation 5. until that moment the seas became open amen god was showing to john those things in the prototype form in the vision two thousand years ago but we are leaving the time revelation 5. seven seas are open the lord himself came down the shout voice of archangel trump of god he is here right now malachi 4. he said my ministry is to proclaim that he is here right now amen when the cs became open something happened to john john is typing the bride you will never understand the book of revelation until you'll be identified with john whatever john was moving from one chapter first chapter to the 22nd chapter verse after verse of the verse you have to be ill and divide with him then you can see your position john was weeping but it was a voice don't whip john anymore there's a line of tribe of judah prevailed and he's the word he won to take the book and he took that book and he opened all the seven seals took it off open the book and hand it down to the seven messenger in revelation 10 7 he's starting to use the voice god is using the voice it's nothing to do with brother branham he was just a channel that yelled himself to the high intelligence that was the intelligence behind the trumpet trumpet is mute until his intelligence behind the instrument blowing giving a certain sound we got a certain sound of the gospel in the last days not joined to denomination not go from the church to church coming to christ the mystery of god god and the man became one revelation 10 7 mystery of god is finished what was the group in revelation 5 that responded for the open book there was a question answers on the seals and someone asked brad branham sunday morning 24th of march 1963. problem what kind of group it is in revelation 5. what kind of group he was so tired he was all the time privately you know he was tired two hours in the presence of the angel he was just breaking to seal or just give a revelation of the seal that the lamb in heaven broke down one by one he was tired so he said this is a heavenly group and then all of a sudden he felt to be condemned he said something is wrong in a congregation maybe someone is sick we're supposed to pray for someone what's wrong what's wrong the answer is not coming from heaven he doesn't know the answer brother he doesn't know the answer god is showing the transition the response is coming from the audience simple brother he says read the scripture again read again you read it once but now read it again in a new way an answer is coming for the bride because she's also part of death what is going on right now it's not only about blah blah he didn't know he was tired but he said read again he reads again revelation 5. he reads the scripture and he realized and they sung a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof forth always slain and has redeemed us to god you redeem us to god it couldn't be heavenly group it couldn't be no angel no cherubim there is no redemption for angels when the angels to follow lucifer they were kicked out from heaven with the lucifer they became fallen angels there is no redemption for angels there is a redemption for you and me [Music] you redeem us to god oh i would make a mistake he said if the holy spirit wouldn't be here holy spirit use the bride member of the bride read again he reads against the scripture and then the revelation strikes him it was not the heavenly group it was the bride it was you and me before you've been born you responded for the opening the seals you recognize my name is also in the book [Applause] i was only typed in john but i responded you redeem us there was a group of redeemed people revelation 5 the most profound scripture in the whole bible when jesus christ he paid the price in his first coming in the second coming he's claiming his possession [Applause] and a song a new song what kind of song the seventh
