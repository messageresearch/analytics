TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] lord to thy precious [Music] amen god bless you this evening let's just take our bibles and go right to the word here we're going to write to matthew 21. and it's been said a few times already but i want to say happy veterans day to the veterans out there so grateful and appreciate so much all you've done amen we're so thankful to still live in a country where we can do this where we can be free and we know that that privilege won't always be here so we want to take advantage of it while we can it'd be sad to someday see the doors of this church close down and think i missed a lot of services because i was a little tired and i could have been there so i appreciate you all coming out on a wednesday night amen let's take a look at matthew 21 verse 21. jesus answered and said unto them verily i say unto you if you have faith and doubt not you should not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done let's just bow our heads and ask the lord to bless the reading of his word dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this word we come to you today in the name of jesus christ asking lord that you would break the bread of life to us this morning this evening lord that you would open your word and pour it into our hearts and forever change us by your word lord you're molding us and you're shaping us lord by the chisel of your word lord i pray that tonight you would do a further work in my life that you would just hone out that that character of christ in me using your word i ask that you take these lips of clay and use them for your glory give us years to hear and hearts to perceive all you have for us this evening in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated i just want to remind everybody while you're being seated of the weekend meetings this weekend with brother abraham myra we have a saturday night service at seven sunday morning is our normal time but then we've added a sunday afternoon service at four and brother abraham has a wonderful testimony and it's it's really out of this world when i say out of this world i mean out of this world supernatural and so i think it would be quite a blessing so we're going to ask him to come back at 4 00 p.m and we're not going to have a song service or anything we're just going to have a testimony service and give him plenty of time to share his testimony what god's done for him is miraculous it's wonderful it's exciting and i know it'll be a blessing you know i mentioned before but brother abraham brother abraham holds the office of a prophet and he's gifted that way and he has that ministry and has been confirmed by many and so we're excited to have him here he also pastors a church in uganda a church of 700 people from what i understand so he he's quite active and quite busy and god's really blessed him so i think it'll be a blessing to you so i encourage you to come out seven o'clock on saturday also there's one other thing i want to i want to announce before we get right into to the scriptures here and the word um we decided to take another field trip with our youth group up to a mega church up in toledo we did this about six years ago and it was quite an eye-opening experience for all of us who were able to go so we're going to plan that again for not this coming saturday but the following saturday november the 21st we'll be meeting here at 2 30 in the afternoon here in the fellowship hall and we'll carpool our way up there and it would be very good for the the youth in this church to see what brother branham's talking about you know uh i'd say most of the young people in the church have been raised in the message and don't really have many experiences outside of this assembly here or assemblies like this or camps or whatever and it would be really it's really an experience to go and see everything that brother branham was talking about in 1950s and 1960s now we're here 50 years later and to see what it actually everything he said is actually taking place things that nobody in his day believed would happen that the church would be led by rock and roll music they didn't believe it in the 1960s nobody believed that but now it's happening and you'll get a chance to see that if you take this trip and so we're going to put a sign up sheet out for the weekend for all the kids who want to sign up to go we want to get a good head count so we know what to do about transportation and any parents that are willing to drive up if you've got a minivan or a vehicle that'll hold many if you want to drive if you could sign up we'll have a separate spot for you the list you know that you want to go and how many that you can take so we make sure everybody has a ride up there and we want to make sure that this is for the youth in our church anybody can go up anytime i mean it's an open door church they have 2 500 people that go through there through the weekend but we don't want to show up with 150 people so let's be conscious of how many we take and how many go we want to primarily do this for the young people amen i think that's it man we're going to do like we did last time i think we did it six years ago i think it was six years ago when we did that and we're going to stop on the way back and get a bite to eat so we can talk about the things we've seen and experienced and kind of have some time to share with one another so i think that'd be beneficial so we'll have that sign up sheet this weekend so make sure you sign up for that if you have any questions just give me a call and we'll work it out so we want to get back to the word right now we're gonna we got the scripture in matthew 21 which is very very familiar passage of scripture if you say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea it shall be done and brother branham admitted that this scripture had baffled him for many many years and so he we're going to get into god giving him the revelation of this scripture but we're going to wrap up our our bible study on esther tonight lord willing this is titled the rise of the queen part 3 the third pool so we're gonna talk about the third pool in the ministry of esther it's amazing that esther has so much in ten little chapters ten little chapters we found vashti the queen put away for refusing the king we found the seven chamberlains which are the seven church age messengers we've sound we we've seen haggai the ministry of brother branham ministering to the virgins and we've seen the the virgins go before the king and the king choose one out of all of them for the queen and so we've seen the rise of the queen esther coming into power and we've been through all of that and we've seen her revelation of her position as she first starts off humbly afraid to approach to the king because she doesn't know what the king really feels about her she doesn't really know she knows she's called because all the fair young virgins were called she knows she's chosen because god the king chose her out of all of the fair young virgins so she knows she's called she's no she's chosen but she doesn't know the access she has to the king and she doesn't really know how the king would feel about her so we find her in early on in in esther fasting for three days and having all of her kindred fast for three days because she's going to go into the king unbidden now if the king called for you to come it was no big deal but if you decided to go to king on your own of your own choosing that was a big deal because any who did so and wasn't received by the king was killed because it was death to go into the holy of holies we found the same thing in the in the book of leviticus in the old testament to go into the holy of holies where the throne of god was where his seat was was death except only one person the high priest one day out of the year could go and not without blood but any time he would approach the wrong way not when he was bid and not of his own free will but if he had approached the wrong way he would be smitten dead and so now we find esther the queen which is the type of the church she doesn't know that she has free access to the king she's worried about this old law amen and so now she finds out that the king the king delights in her and she knows this because when he saw her come in with the royal apparel and the royal apparel is the word she's clothed in the word and she comes in with the royal apparel and he extends the golden scepter under her and we found out that the golden scepter was the symbol of power and authority or the symbol of the kingdom which is the word of god and it was extended unto her and she received that extension of mercy by coming up and placing her hand on top of the scepter and so she found that mercy was extended and mercy was received amen and it's extension of the word of god but then she finds out exactly what's in the mind of the king when he says what is your request and it'll be given to thee up to half of my kingdom and that's when esther finds out that she's a joint heir with christ amen that she gets up to half the kingdom amen so it's a far cry from being afraid you'll be slaughtered to all the sudden being a half half the joint heir having half the kingdom virtually handed to you so last time we talked about on sunday we talked about the the two comings of the king first she comes into the king's inner chamber and she's accepted there then she invites the king to her inner chamber to her banquet of wines and when she come when he comes we find out that haman's there because haman's always there right and esther's in esther's banquet of wine in esther's house is haman the evil one the enemy of the jews but she's also invited the king to come now the king has come to her inner chamber but it wasn't on the third day it wasn't the first coming of the king that gave her deliverance over haman but it was the second coming of the king on the fourth day all right because we're going to pick up our story in the fourth day so on the fourth day which we found out for is god's number of deliverance there's four faces to the cherubims four four gospels four is his number of deliverance and so on the fourth day she finds deliverance from haman amen because the king came to her in her chamber to her banquet of wines to her communion which is the baptism of the holy ghost so that's where we are in our story in esther so let's turn to esther and pick it up where we left off sunday we find out also that i just want to remind you the quote i read it sunday and i want to read it again out of christ is the mystery of god revealed and the reason we're diving into esther like we are is brother benham talking about the opening of the seven seals and he says it's the coming of the lord and and he said let me read it here out of christ is the mystery of god revealed he said god has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of half an hour and seven thunders uttered their voices and john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't know he has showed it or revealed it in every type that's in the bible amen that we find it in esther the plan of redemption that's the mystery of god the mystery redemption therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type in expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it that's a marvelous quote that's the reason esther is coming to life to us because he he has revealed the hidden mystery all through the bible but he's only he has hid it there but he's only revealing it to his precious bride and he hid it there brother brenham said like a love letter so that at the point in time he could open our eyes to see what's always been there right it's not a new bible we're not rewriting the bible we're not looking for a new bible we're looking for the mystery that's veiled in the bible for the word that's already here we don't need to change the word what needs to change is our eyes so that we can see the word that's what he's doing for us he's continually revealing himself he didn't stop in 1963. he's continually revealing himself and continually revealing the love letter so that his children his precious bride would know who he is and so that she would know who she is that's what we found out esther first needed to realize who the king was but the more important was for esther to realize who she was because deliverance never came until esther took her place and deliverance in our day is not going to come till esther takes her place amen until the bride of jesus christ gets in her full position then we're not in the full redemption is not going to come until she gets in position whether you like it or not this whole thing is hinged on you and i yeah amen let's get in position brothers and sisters so let's go to esther eight this is where we ended so we'll pick it up here in esther chapter eight verse one said on that day and that is the fourth day that's the second time that the king has come to the banquet of wines in esther's house that's when haman is exposed to be the wicked one the enemy that's trying to take her life and that's where esther calls for life she says i want my life she's calling for eternal life and then the bride is calling saying my life my life is tainted my life is taken my life is in jeopardy why because of hybridization in the garden of eden because of serpent seed because of serpency because of what happened in the garden this wicked haman's plan is to destroy me and the wicked haman is the devil is the devil and this is when when is the devil exposed in the fourth day when was the devil exposed in his plan to destroy the people of god when was it exposed in the fourth anointing and the eagle anointing because it wasn't until brother branham's day that that thing was fully exposed the full revelation of serpent seed and how the trail of the serpent has been from the garden of eden all the way through in the antichrist spirit because the antichrist spirit is still the trail of the serpent and winds up all the way in the book of revelations amen that was revealed under the fourth anointing not not the lion anointing not the ox anointing not the man anointing but it was the eagle anointing the fourth anointing that exposed the work of haman all the way back in the beginning so deliverance comes in four so on that day did the king ahazeras give the house of haman the jew's enemy and to esther the queen so he found out all that haman thought that he had and all that haman thought was his and all that the devil thinks is his is going to become property of the bride it became it became esthers but then look what esther does he gave the house of haman the jewish enemy and to esther the queen and mordecai came before the king for esther had told what he was under her and the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman and he gave it unto mordecai and esther set mordecai over the house of haman this is amazing esther is taking authority esther's placing people in positions of authority and mordecai's an interesting figure so mordecai is a benjaminite and we know mordecai represents the 144 thousand and we know the 144 000 are attendants to the bride in the groom brother branham tells us that in the in the church ages but mordecai is also going to take on a representation of christ if we watch this very carefully mordecai is going to represent christ to us in this story especially today if you think about it it was mordecai who brought up esther it was mordecai who instructed esther and what she should do it was mordecai who told esther to go in before the king this is the work of christ as the holy ghost amen so this is what mordecai's representation we find out that esther doesn't even have mother or father who's raising her who's bringing her up it's mordecai it's the holy ghost it's not our mother and father but it's the holy spirit it's the it's the it's the office of christ his holy ghost who's come down and he's raising us up he's giving us instruction he's working all the way through to the house of the virgin and it says mordecai when she was in the house of the virgins came by daily to check on her somebody's been watching over you watching over you through justification being chosen watching over you through sanctification the 12 months in the house of the virgins being purged and purified somebody's been watching for you all the way until you come to this to this choosing of the king all the way through to deliverance amen it's this mordecai so mordecai gets the ceiling ring and we know it's the holy ghost that does the ceiling amen so let's keep moving here verse three and esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman the agagi and his device that he had devised against the jews then the king held out the golden scepter toward esther so esther arose and stood before the king and said if it pleased the king and if i have found favor in his sight and the things seem right before the king and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letters devised by haman the son of hamadatha which he wrote to destroy the jews which are in all the king's provinces so we find the first time that the queen queen esther after she's been called after she's been chosen the first time she goes to communicate she certifies by mordecai's name to the king about the planned assassination we don't see her go in herself we don't see this fasting and going in and the scepter being extended the first time she certifies or sends communication in mordecai's name amen to the king but the second time she wants to communicate with the king she has to go in herself and so she's got this worry this dread this fear of going before the king and so she's got this fasting and this prayer and all this preparation and she goes in but now the third time after the king's been to her banquet of wine she just goes in we don't have any fasting any preparation or asking all the kindred to fast with her we don't have any special preparation of the royal garments we just see her go in amen her revelation is increasing as time goes on we're going to find her revelation is going to go even higher than that not that she just could go in and it's amazing that we find out when esther goes to the king what's what's amazing about esther going to the king is she goes of her own will not when the king says but when she has the desire when she has a need then she goes before the king amen and she finds out she's accepted to the king now the second time she's got a need and she goes before the king again and she's learning that she can go to the king with her needs and she finds out that the king loves her he's always willing to extend the golden scepter amen mercy is always extended to his bride so she asked that all this evil and what haman had done is he had written a decree that on an appointed day on the 13th day of the 12th month then everybody in all the kingdoms and all the 127 provinces of this king are going to be able to attack and kill the jews and spoil their goods and take all their stuff so this is a law that's on the books and so now after haman is destroyed he's hung on his own gallows that he had for mordecai trying to destroy story christ he destroys himself that's exactly what the devil's going to do amen and so now we find out that that she still has this law that she has to deal with there's still the law paul talked about that i find this law taking occasion work its destruction in my flesh there's still a problem there's a law on the books that are going to destroy her people amen so she needs not just mercy for herself she needs mercy for her people so verse 6 she says for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred so first she goes in and she asks for her own life she goes to the king she invites the king into her house the king comes to her house she finds deliverance over wicked haman and she's asking for her life but now after she's found life and after she's found mercy now she goes the king to the king for her kindred she's already found pardon she's already found mercy she's already found life but now she is asking for life of her kindred brother branham says in convinced and then concerned andrew was concerned about his brother after he had stayed with jesus all night he says but i'm afraid that that's what's the matter with our churches today brother sister we just don't stay long enough we run in and shake hands with the pastor put our name on the book and go home call ourselves a church member with no burden for lost at all no burden for the lost at all we're not concerned about the missionary overseas we're not concerned about the starving anywhere else we got our tummies full and we got a good warm nice church and fine intellectual pastor that will never say anything against the things that we're doing so we're seemed to be very well satisfied see therefore we're not concerned we're not concerned about what goes on but if you was convinced that jesus christ raised from the dead and will judge you for your sins and that his coming is at hand and that his holy spirit identified himself then you'd be concerned about other people too and getting them to just as concerned as andrew was amen brother branham said it's a burden for souls once you've found your own pardon you want somebody else to find pardon the evidence that you found the real pardon is you have a desire for somebody else to find mercy you've been to the king he's been to your inner chamber you've found deliverance over wicked haman but it's not good enough for you to find eternal life now you've got a burden for your kindred amen esther's taking on the same plan the same path that we journey through so now she's crying out for her kindred now in verse 7 then the king azeroth said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew now look he's speaking to both of them to esther the queen and mordecai the jew behold i have given esther the house of haman and him hath they hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews right ye also for the jews as it liketh as it liketh you the king's not telling them what to write the king is talking to esther and to mordecai which is a type of the holy spirit and he's talking to them and saying write what you like remember we're talking about the rise of the queen the third pool the king just gave esther and mordecai the right to write or say what they want to happen amen there's a law in the books and the king can't change his law but he's given a seal amen and by that seal a new word can be sealed into law and that would be just as effective as the previous law god's never changing his word amen he's never changing his word he's just giving us a seal and the seal will overcome the previous word hallelujah hallelujah he said the esther the queen and mordecai that you behold have given esther the house of haman and him have they hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews write ye also for the jew as it liketh you in the king's name and seal it with the king's ring for the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's ring may no man reverse once you've got the seal nobody's reversing the seal hallelujah amen i want to skip over to verse 9. the rest of the chapter in verse 8 is just what they write and mordecai goes to write how the jews are going to be able to defend themselves and when they're attacked on that day they can defend their enemies they can kill their enemies and they can take their spoil so everything's going to be reversed but now i want to pick up the story in chapter 9 verse 10. through verse 9 the day comes the appointed day there's an attack that the enemies are going to make against the jews the jews counter attack and sometimes they attack ahead of time and they kill all of their enemies so the jews now are free and so then they kill the ten sons in verse verse six through through nine they're telling the names of the ten sons of haman that are killed we'll pick it up in verse ten the ten sons of haman the son of hemadatha the enemy of the jews slew they but on the spoil laid they not their hand on that day the number of those that were slain in sushi and the palace was brought before the king and the king said unto esther the queen now i want to stop right there stop there was 500 killed they killed the 10 sons of haman and then they're going to come and they're going to report to the king what had happened so we know that before when there was a when when this travesty was first set in motion and the decree went out that the jews were going to be slaughtered by the hand of haman then mordecai told esther you must approach to the king she says i can't i've not been called these 30 days but he says for such a time as this you were you were brought into power and so she prays she fast she goes before the whole scene plays out the king comes to her twice she goes back to the king amen the king allows them to say whatever they want to be said but now something has transpired something has changed in the relationship of the queen and the king now after the destruction amen and shushing of the 500 and the 10 sons of haman now they bring a report to the king that says thou this many has died and shushing and all this and it says the king says to esther where's esther he doesn't call for esther esther doesn't have to be brought before him esther's with him something has changed in the relationship now when they bring the number before to esther he doesn't say go fetch esther send a chamberlain after esther somebody bring esther he just tells esther look what's hidden in the love letter amen let's read it again on verse 11 on that day the number of those that were slain and shushed in the palace was brought before the king and the king said unto esther the queen he didn't have to go anywhere he didn't have to call for anybody he could just say to esther the kring why she's sitting with him in his throne look at the progression of esther esther progresses in a relationship with the king in four stages first she certifies to the king in mordecai's name that's how we're taught to pray jesus says just don't pray to me pray directly to the father in my name and he'll answer thee so first she certifies to the king in mordecai's name the second time she comes to the king herself with prayers and fastings right the third time the king comes to her banquet of wines in the baptism of the holy ghost and the fourth stage of the relationship is on the throne with the king amen revelations chapter 3 says to him that overcometh laodicea to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i has overcome and sit with my father in his throne amen she's got a right now to sit those that overcome in laodicea how do you overcome in laodicea by being born again and accepting this message you've overcome laodicea and they that overcome laodicea they've come out of laodicea into the bride age and now they have a right to sit with them in his throne hallelujah esther went from certifying a message in mordecai's name to going in boldly not boldly but timidly the second time boldly into the very throne room of god third time god coming into her inner chamber and the baptism only goes and the fourth time sitting with him on the throne what about your progression where are you in your progression man i don't know about you but i'm sitting with him on his throne i'm not waiting to do it later i'm doing it now amen brother branham said where is his throne he said his throne is in the hearts of men amen christ came to his throne and he's enthroned in my life hallelujah let's keep going and the king said unto esther the queen the jews have slain and destroyed 500 men in shush in the palace and the 10 sons of haman what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces now what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee or what is thy request further and it shall be done the queen esther doesn't say anything to the king esther doesn't ask the king for anything now esther seated with him in his throne amen in his inner chamber and now the king is telling her this is what happened and this is the report now what is your petition what do you want to be done not what the king desires what do you desire to be done don't forget we're talking about the third pool amen we're going to get this interesting quotes here in just a minute look at what she says then said esther if it pleased the king let it be granted to the jews which are in shushan to do tomorrow as according unto this day's decree and let haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows and the king commanded it so to be done and the decree was given at shushan and they hanged haman's ten sons first corinthians 6 1-2 says dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints do you not know that the saints shall judge the world what the king just gave to esther was the right to judge he says what would you have what is your petition what would you like to have done and look at what she did they had already killed the ten sons of haman there's a mystery laying here she had already they had already killed the ten sons of haman but she says let the ten sons of haman be hanged they're already dead unless now we've moved into the judgment the white throne judgment and now we're talking about the second death and who's got a right to judge at the white throne judgment in the second death it's the king and queen together who are passing judgment and now he looks to esther say what would you have to be done they're already dead they're already dead she's passing judgment on the dead it's the white throne judgment esther's now passing judgment on that which is already dead and she says hang them it's the second death and who gets a right to say past judgment the queen esther that's you and i we're not going to be in the judgment we're going to be on the throne judging with him it's an esther it's right here praise god i like it it's amazing i want to back up and just remind you mordecai is a type of christ and in this story we're at the we're at the wrapping up of all time the exposing of haman the destruction of the enemies of the of god's chosen people and their freedom to go free and what we have is is we have mordechai the benjaminite jesus christ came out of the tribe of judah the alpha but the omega is benjamin the first tribe is reuben the last tribe is benjamin so he's showing at the final stage at the very last the little benjamin is when mordecai comes on the scene and leads esther all the way into the throne room of god amen and we'll find his role here at the very end brother branham says now i want to talk about this third pool because we see it in esther the third pool is when the king says what would you have the third pulls when the king says you say brother ram is going to talk about this in the message testimony in 1963 said i was praying i heard something say stand up on your feet now he's praying for his wife his wife has a tumor and he's prayed for he's laid hands on her and her tumor keeps growing and growing and growing we're very familiar with the story she's down in tucson she's going to go see a specialist he's in jeffersonville he's getting prepared for some meetings and he's praying and while he's praying something says stand up on your feet and i just went ahead praying because i thought maybe i imagined that he was a human being amen he was a man i just imagined that and as i was praying on something said stand up on your feet i thought what was that stand up on your feet i thought well i'll stand up on my feet and i got up on my feet just that same voice that spoke up here on the hill that night the same one who always come i said lord god what was that that you spoke to your servant he said just say the word and there'll be no more tumor the king is telling esther say what you want what would you want to happen next that's what's happening here in this story i stood there a little bit i got to myself i got to get to myself right many of you knows in here and the people in the tabernacle knows what was that she had it i said then i say in the name of the lord jesus christ that that tumor shall leave her been bothering her so bad she had been in bed for three or four days with it i said they will never even find a trace of it for the lord my god who is creator who can stop winds and storms and can rebuke the seas and bring forth that he is the creator of heavens and earth and i love him and believe him and i believe that this time that this time is now nearing when these things are to be and you who would create a squirrel and put it into existence can take an enemy out of existence hallelujah we know the prophet said before they lay a hand on her it'll be gone and that's exactly to the t how it happened she laid on the examination table the doctor when he moved towards her to put his hand on her to check the tumor she felt something cool sweep over her and it was gone he wasn't he was praying but it wasn't prayer that moved the tumor he had prayed for her before but this time it was different it wasn't a prayer of faith it wasn't a prayer according to the faith in the word that moved that turmeric it was when the king said to the queen when the king said to esther what do you want you say what you want and it'll be done and guess what when esther said what she wanted done guess what was done whatsoever esther said and when the king came to the prophet this way and said you speak whatever he said was exactly what happened again brother braham says in the message i have heard but now i see in 1965 joshua was in an hour of crisis when the armies were routed and the sun was going down joshua was a prophet and he knew that if them armies ever had a chance to unite again and come against them he would lose more men so in the hour of crisis when something had to be done there's only one thing if he could keep them running he'd route them everyone down but there wasn't enough light to do it so joshua stood raised his hands and said son stand still and moon hang over agile until i get through with this battle and the sun stood still they heard joshua speak and then they seen god with their own eyes in action true that's what he says perhaps joshua never had tried to figure out how he was going to do it how god was going to do it the only thing that he said was son stand still he said it perhaps not knowing what he was saying because it was god that gave it to him and he worked same thing in mark 11 23 if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said but you can't stand there fumble in your mind and say you've got is to say it you've got to be inspired to say it amen brother is going to make this really clear this isn't you taking the word upon yourself of your own will and speaking it it's by permission he's going to make that really clear excuse the expression but that day sitting there in the woods and god's my judge and i could fall dead on this pulpit when that scripture had stumped me all my life what scripture saying to this mountain that's the scripture he says it stumped me all my life sitting there that morning in the woods and i was thinking on that and that voice spoke to me and said that scripture is like all scripture it's true and i thought well how could it be and he said he said speak and it will be that way don't doubt it and i was talking to somebody sitting way out in the woods no squirrel's been there for three days there's no squirrels there and i was sitting in a sycamore thicket squirrels don't even come anybody that hunt squirrels know they're not in sycamore and i had been sitting there and the wind blowing real hard about 10 o'clock in the morning and i was thinking again and it said you're hunting and you need squirrels just just the same as abraham needed a ram i thought that's always told me the truth but this sounds funny and i got up from where i was sitting and i looked around where is that person that was talking to me nothing wind just blowing real hard and i thought could i have fell asleep and dreamed that no i wasn't asleep i was sitting up against the tree there watching supposed to pick up brother woods and brother sophomore back there just in a little bit around 10 o'clock in the morning farmers all around there working gathering their corn and i heard it again say you're hunting and you need game how many do you need and i thought now i don't want to overdo this i'm just going to ask for three squirrels three squirrels i want young three red squirrels i want them he said listen brother branham says and i thought get this and i thought now i don't want to overdo it i'll just ask for three i want three red squirrels and then he said then speak about it thinking wasn't good enough didn't matter what esther was thinking when the king spoke to her it mattered what she said amen then speak about it and i said i'm going to get three young red squirrels and he said which away will they come well i thought i've went this far there's something talking to me here just as the same as you hear me talking and god in heaven with this bible over my heart knows that's the truth and i said well i picked out a ridiculous place an old dry limb hanging out of there about 50 yards where my rifle was shot in i said the first one will be right there and there he was i rubbed my eyes and looked back i turned my head and i thought i don't want to shoot a vision so i looked around again and there set the squirrel i throwed a shell up in my gun and aimed up and i could see his black eye young red squirrel i thought maybe i'm sleeping i'll wake up in a few minutes see i'm dreaming about this while i leveled down shot the squirrel and it dropped off the limb i thought well i don't know i thought well should i go over and look for it and i walked over there and there it laid i picked it up and blood run out of it a vision don't bleed you know so i picked it up and it was a squirrel i got real numb all over and i looked around i said god that was you i said thank you for this now i'll go out and and he said but you said do you doubt what you said you said you'd get three now where will the next one come from why because there was a king who could call to a man on earth and say what do you want now catch this brother branham wasn't praying he wasn't praying he was just living life not praying but while he was living life god spoke to him and said now you say brother brethren was pondering on this scripture he's thinking about this has always baffled me all of my life to say to this mountain but here god comes and vindicates that that scripture is the truth amen i want to read i want to read another quote to you where brother branham makes this really clear in questions and answers somebody asked him this question said this third pool end is speaking the word it seems entirely possible for you to speak the word and one would be completely and fully restored placed entirely ready for the rapture in the resurrection the son of man this is so or is it not and you would do this if properly pressed upon would you not escape would you not escape all things escape all things and stand before the son of man so somebody's asking brother branham a question in 1964 they've heard his stories about the spoken word speaking squirrels into existence and the hattie wright and these other things and now they're asking couldn't you just speak to somebody and they'll be fully restored and rapture ready listen to his response he said now my dear friend see now i think you've got a good statement yes sir yes sir now that would be so now that would be so brother branham saying he could do that he could speak to somebody and they would be raps restored and rapture ready he said yes sir that would be so now look what else he says you said brother branham in other words not to polish up what you said but i believe i can make it a little clearer to people see you are believing because of the spoken words and things like that that he said about and all of you here witnessed the squirrels and all these other things that's been done but did you notice that was sovereignly given here's the key that unlocks this mystery it was sovereignly given i never asked him lord let me do this speak these things like that do these things there i never asked him that he by his own divine will came to me and said you go do this see i wasn't asking one thing about it moses never asked to go down in egypt but it was god that sent him down to egypt sea now i believe that the holy spirit would come to me and say in a vision go tell a certain certain person that they're not they're trying to overcome a certain thing and they cannot do it and they're smoking they're drinking they're lying stealing or committing adultery whatever it might be or they got lustful spirit and you just go where they are and say thou spirit come out of there and set this captive free would it take place absolutely yes indeed it absolutely would it'd take place but now upon my own presuming now presume means to venture without authority see i'd go down there to help this person i'm just presuming that it'll be all right see then i don't know i can call the name of the lord over them and i can pray for them or do whatever i wish to do. he's saying i could go pray for a person in that condition but i can't declare them whole that's just presuming brother branham says he says could you call for somebody they'd be restored and raptured yes sir absolutely absolutely but the key that unlocks the mystery is it's sovereignly given you can't just decide to do that you can't choose to operate the third pool we've had so much fanaticism so much crazy stuff take racing the message because people want to claim things that they have no right to claim you don't have a right to claim things and say this is the way it's going to be and you're going to be delivered because brother branham said you can have faith in the word and you can teach and preach the word of god but you do you to declare that a demons come out of a person brother branham said they can come across the pulpit he himself can pour gallons of oil over them and anoint them and lay hands on them and he said if they have unconfessed sin that devil will never go anywhere he's got a right to stay and so you by claiming you're going to go free you're going to be healed everything's all right you're just presuming because you don't know you know the word says by faith they can go free you can say what the word says and if you believe the word you'll go free but you can't claim something you have no right to claim all right this kind of preaching makes some people nervous because they want to claim some stuff they want to say everything's going to be this and everything's going to be that everything's going to be according to the word and it operates by faith and faith is grace a gift that's given to you to believe but you must believe and you can't believe without grace and faith is a revelation it's revealed to you that the word works not because somebody looked down at you and said the word says this i proclaim you to be healed and delivered that's presuming unless you see a vision or unless god speaks to you you can't go and do those things that creates catastrophe every time because it doesn't work 100 amen now we're not saying don't claim the word claim the word but it operates by faith not by somebody saying it's working but by the person who actually takes the word and believes it by grace by a gift of god they have the faith to believe and when they believe the word goes into action amen esther never said the way it was going to be until the king told her to say the way it was going to be esther didn't go in making a bunch of claims and esther didn't go on saying well haman's going to this and haman's going to that esther went in humbly before the king making her request but when the king said you say then she had a right to say but not until the king said you say amen i hope this clears up a whole bunch of confusion because people have taken the gift of god and made it disgraceful by assuming a bunch of stuff here's what brother brahma goes on to say it's wonderful what he says now if i had my own way this morning i had an interview with this little lady sitting here this wheelchair to come to this meeting today they had to have the fire department to take her out of her house in chicago and there's people that live across the street and don't come to the meeting see what would i do if it was in my power see i have the authority to do it amen i have the authority to do it but i have to wait for orders to do it did the apostle paul have the power to cast out the demon spirit of the woman who followed him for three days crying out he had the power but he had to wait for divine permission to use the authority that was in him amen he had the authority to do it he could do it he proved that he could do it and on the third day he did it but why didn't he do it on day one day two why did he wait till after the third day because he didn't have permission yet jesus didn't he go forth doing anything he wanted to do he said i only do that which the father shows me amen this authority comes under the restraint of the divine will of god and that's what the bride has to mature into into the place where god can speak and she'll move into action but not her will not her desire not her thinking not one ounce of presuming but by faith she's got faith in the word of god or she keeps still she has thus saith the lord or she keeps still hallelujah what we're wanting is something that's real we don't want to pretend we don't want to put on we don't want something that happens sometimes and doesn't happen the other time what we're waiting on before the lord is faith in his word to rise to a place that we've got the genuine article the real deal the genuine tongues the genuine interpretation of drunks the genuine laying hands of the sick the real genuine thing amen amen the only thing we do by presuming has hurt a lot of people he says i have the authority to do it but i have to wait for orders to do it see i have the authority from god to do it but now when he gives the order she'd go back home well see i know that is the truth i'd be i'd just be as willing to die this morning on that as i'd be on anything see that's the truth what's the truth when i get the orders he said she would go home well i would just be just as willing to die on that as anything this morning because he knows once god said it there's nothing that could stop it from happening but unless god spoken it to you or give you into a real genuine revelation you don't have the right to speak it you have the right to speak the word and faith and say lord according to your word i believe that this will happen but you don't have the right to go around saying this is going to be that and this is going to be that and you're going to be this you've got to be careful with that brother branham said if you ever do that it doesn't come to pass you better come down to the altar and have hands laid on you and ask for that demon to be cast out of you because the spirit of god is never wrong man a lot of people should have done that a long time ago they would have saved a lot of people a lot of heartache and grief amen now let's get back to esther coming into position in the third pool brother branham says in pergamon church age in the church age book those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time does christ still have a work to do on the earth absolutely how's he going to do it through his body who's his body the ones who are baptized into one body by one spirit is the literal body of jesus christ and if he's got a work to do on the earth he's got to use his earthly body that's you and i brothers and sisters we're his hands we're his feet we're his eyes we're his mouth we're his ears and if he's got a work to do there's only one way he can do it in the earth is when he uses his body hallelujah so there's still something for us to do esther chapter 9 verse 29. then esther the queen the daughter of abigail and mordecai the jew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of purim and he sent the letters into all the jews to the 120 and seven provinces of king of king of the kingdom of ahazaris with the words of peace and truth to confirm these days of purim and their times appointed according as mordecai the jew and esther the queen had enjoined them and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed the matters of the fasting in their cry now look in verse 29 it says then esther the queen the daughter of i behale and mordecai the jew wrote with all authority and then in 31 it says according as mordecai the jew and esther the queen had enjoined them i think it's very unusual and it's very odd the way the scripture speaks whenever whenever esther is going to decree or esther's going to move go into motion to write something or say something it's esther and mordecai have we seen that nestor esther and mordecai mordecai is a type of rod the spirit of god and so we have this scripture in revelations right at the end of the book revelations 22. i'll just turn to it i can't find it in my notes revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the bride say come in esther and mordecai wrote and astor and mordecai decreed amen do we see it in the spirit in the bride say come and at the end time in this last stage what's the voice that's speaking it's the spirit speaking through the bride amen because the spirit can't speak in an audible voice that others can hear unless he uses your vocal cords and the spirit and the bride say come in the end time it's going to be the spirit and the bride amen i want to finish up here with with esther now esther has the authority because she's the queen because the king's given her the authority but mordecai has the power to enforce the authority amen you get it the spirit and the bride say come the the bride of atazeras by his authority by his will by his decree has given esther the right to say what she wants to write what she wants to make law what she wants to make law so she has the authority to say it but mordecai the holy spirit has the seal or the power to put it in action hallelujah that's why it's the spirit and the bride that say come because the bride has the authority on earth for these things but it's the spirit of god that comes and backs up what she says and is the power to manifest what she says amen that's why it's always esther and mordecai let's look at esther 9 32 and the decree of esther confirmed these matters of purim and it was written in the book it wasn't that the king said it should be in the book it wasn't that the king decreed the king is not decreeing amen after haman's exposed and delivered after the second coming of the king it's the king is always telling esther to say what she wants then it's esther and mordecai working together over here in esther and mordecai working together over here but at the end the decree of esther confirmed the matters of purim amen and it was written in the book he has things yet that he needs to do on the earth and he's going to do it in and through the bride who do you think is going to be decreeing in the last days whose voice is it that says come the spirit and the bride not of her own will not of our own choosing but by divine commandment of the father just a couple more quotes we'll wrap up this will finish our topic here is the rising of the sun 1965 as christ was the first one to rise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of christ did you catch that the second coming of christ is what the bride coming of christ remember he comes in mail then he comes in female then the third time is male and female restored to eden all right he came as male and jesus christ the men that walked in nazareth the man from nazareth walks by the sea of galilee the second time he comes into a many member bride amen so now we're talking about the second coming in the bride coming of christ out of the church they'll have to be a sheaf waved again in the last days oh my waving of the sheaf what was the sheave the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was wheat that proved it was a sheep hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism have we received the resurrection out of dark denominationalism how many has received that resurrection already amen i'm just waiting for my body to catch up to where my soul is but i've already received that resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there so brother branham talking about the wave chief offering he talks about jesus christ he was the wave chief offering he come and he proved amen he proved he fulfilled all the law and he proved that all the works were available to the people and he was the wave chief waved over the people in resurrection when he resurrected he proved that he overcome death and all the promises were coming to the people and the book of the acts was the rest of the harvest we got it so the resurrection of christ was the wave chief offering waved over the people and the book of acts is the rest of the of the harvest now he says in the second coming of christ amen in the bride coming of christ there will once again need to be a wave sheath offered over the congregation and the wave sheep was the first part of the field to come to harvest maturity was cut and waved before the lord and that's his ministry mother brennan's ministry is the wave sheep offering but just as jesus christ was the wave sheep offering there had to be a full harvest come and the full harvest was the book of acts now in the bride coming of christ there has to be a wave sheep offering proving that the full maturity of the word was back again and then brother branham show us that the full maturity of the word was back again so just like the wave chief has offered there's got to be a full harvest was it all in the prophet no he was the first one the wave chief the first one to come to full harvest maturity the full word back again but there's got to be a full harvest the whole field's got to come to full word maturity amen to everything that's in the word is in the is in the field every gift that's in the body has to be in the field it can't just be in the wave sheath it's got to come to the body to full harvest maturity and in the last days we've had the wave chief and the way she proved that this word will bring a harvest to full maturity and so now we've been laying in the presence of the sun which is the same word and that same word is bringing the rest of the field to full harvest maturity but there's got to be another book of acts written behind it the first wave she produced the book of acts the second wave chief has to produce a book of acts but not a presuming not a hoping so but the real genuine thing amen we see it all around us it's happening all the time we hear testimonies after testimonies after testimonies but that's got to come to full harvest maturity amen but we don't want to put on look what brother branham says in looking away to jesus in 1963 the very end december 29th 1963. so now i'm going to say something to you now that i haven't said all along and that is that the thing we have looked forward to so long for at least many years four or five years or maybe longer the third pull has now been vindicated and i'm sure you all know what it is now brother branham told us that the third pool and anointed ones at the end time he says the third pool is the opening of the word all right when he's talking about third pool he goes back to a vision he had in 1956 and in this vision in 1956 he starts off by he's trying to i believe he starts off by trying to thread a cord into a baby shoe and he's got a great big cord and a little bitty eyelid on the shoe and he can't get it to go in and the angel of the lord tells him you can't teach pentecostal babies spiritual things all right so then after that goes away there's a fishing pole in his hand and he's fishing on the bank and there's other fishermen around and we find out that they're all ministers and the end of the lord tells him to go out deep and catch the big ones said all around here are little ones but out there is the big rainbow trout that's what you're after so he puts the lure on and he casts it out then all the ministers come around and says you're a fisherman aren't you you're a fisherman how do you do it and he said that made me feel pretty good and i said yeah i'm a fisherman so i begin to show them what i'm doing and i do this first pull this first little jerk of the lure to try to attract the tension of the fish and he says that's the sign in the hand when i lay my hand on him and the bumps and things and the red rash would appear and i would tell them what disease they had that's the first little jerk trying to catch those big fish what's he trying to catch rainbow trout he said covenant fish seed of god and he says then another little fish come and on the second pool the second pull which is discernment of the thoughts and intents of the heart when god would tell him people's sins and what they had done and look back and show him by vision their doctor and what's wrong with them and and all of that he said i jerked it real hard and jerked the lure clear out of the water and on it was this little bitty old fish looked like skin over allure i don't even know how it swallowed the thing now he's trying to catch rainbow trout but what's he catching little bitty old fish he says just like them other brethren were catching the second pool was only catching the same kind of crop that all the other ministries and evangelistic ministries on the field was catching but he was supposed to catch rainbow trout covenant fish and none of these brethren were catching the covenant fish he said they were out in the deep waters hallelujah it's going to take more than a little shallow water experience for the fish to live in so the second pool was the was the discernment or the prophesying but he said the third pool was the opening of the word and it's the third pool that catches the rainbow trout amen not the signs and wonders not the prophecies that just draws their attention he says that's the lure that's the bait on the hook but the hook is the word amen and so he was showing that it's not the first pool or the second bull and he says you made a great mistake in trying to explain how you were trying to catch the fish trying to explain the gift and and he was always trying to explain how the supernatural worked and he never could anyways nobody ever understood it but he said this will create a bunch of impersonations and it did so he said now in this third pool this third pool is the opening of the word it was the opening of the seven seals all right and what was that when amen when the book of redemption was opened in the in the children of god the rainbow trout saw all the redemptive promises coming back and they saw their name in the book and they saw the title deed back in the hand of of the lamb then they realized that i'm part of that book and that is what was catching the fish what's catching the rainbow trout today not brother branham's discernment amen not the bumps that he had on his hand but it's the word and it's the word that's catching the fish you might be able to attract a rainbow trout with the first pole or the second pull of the lure but what's going to hook him and what's going to catch him is the opening of the word that's the third pull but then what brother branham is talking about now is he's talking about the the vindication of the third pool all right the third pulls the opening of the word but the evidence of the third pull is the spoken word all right brother branham when he talks about the third pool and he talks about the evidence of of the third pool he's talking about or the vindication of the third pull he talks about the creating of squirrels we read about that it happens twice three the first time the next year there's five squirrels then he goes to hattie wright's house or her parents house and he's talking to them about the creation of the squirrels and she says that ain't nothing but the truth and then he stands up and says whatever you say you'll be given to you now hattie wright wasn't praying brother branham wasn't praying when he got squirrels god divinely came down and told him to ask what he wanted hattie wright wasn't praying but to see god can only give that kind of authority mixed with power to somebody who's got character and he could tell he said what that little lady said pleased the lord she caught a revelation that that prophet was saying was nothing but the truth so pleased the lord they said you can have whatever you want because he knew the character in the heart of that little lady wasn't going to ask for a million dollars was it even going to ask for the healing of her sister wasn't even going to ask for something for her parents she was going to ask for the salvation of her two boys amen why doesn't god trust us with the spoken word what's our motive and objective what's in our heart do we have the character to handle that kind of power and authority if he come to you right now and said whatever you want what would you want would it match his will or would it be your own will amen the bride's maturing into the place where she has his word and she knows what he wants done with the word she has the mind of christ not her own mind we're coming to that place brothers and sisters where the third pool can operate hallelujah what's going to bring us there the opening of the word the third pool has now been vindicated and i'm sure you all know what it is now remember there'll never be an impersonation of that because it can't be how can you impersonate that you can lie about it but you certainly can't say squirrels appear and squirrels appear you cannot impersonate the vindication of the third pool and you cannot impersonate the opening of the word that ties genesis to revelations in perfect harmony you can't impersonate that there'll be never be an impersonation of that because it can't be see it cannot be now it's in existence and i'm warned of this right at this time now it's just happened so it could identify its presence among you this third pose happened just now so it can identify its presence among you in what the wave sheath offering and the wave chief offering the third pool's identifying its presence among you but it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up and when it does the pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when what time is he talking about until this great council begins to tighten up that's what he's talking about but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily will be manifest in the fullness of its power why wave sheaf offering full harvest amen wave chief offering he says what you've seen temporarily you'll see in the fullness of its power then he says c c c c four times now i must continue in evangelism just as i was commissioned first i must continue on therefore you've had the word and you know what to look for how to stand i must continue on an evangelism and friends of mine keep still and just keep moving on for the hours approaching swiftly see that when something is going to be done now you might see some little odd things happen for me nothing sinful i don't mean that but i mean something odd to what the regular trend because where i reach to now in the ministry i'm dropping back here where did he reach to the opening of the seven seals how do you go beyond the opening of the seven seals where i'm reaching my ministry i'm dropping back here watching that spot what spot the spot of the squeeze when the squeeze comes down watching that spot and waiting for the time to use it but it's going to be used and everyone knows that for as certain as the first was identified so has the second been identified he's talking about the three pools just as the first was identified so was the second been identified and if you think real closely you who are spiritual as the bible said here's to them that have wisdom the third is properly identified see we know where it is so the third pull is here why because christ has come when at the opening of the seals christ has come it's so sacred that i mustn't say much about it as he told me in the beginning said this say nothing of it remember that years ago it speaks for itself see i've tried to explain the others and i made a mistake this will be the thing that to my opinion i don't say the lord tells me this this will be a thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going away see listen to what he says here i must lay quiet for just a little while now remember and who is listening to this tape you might see such a change in my ministry right away dropping back not going up dropping back two years after he preached this he's dead ministries ended in his life you might see a change in my ministry right away dropping back not going up dropping back we're right at that age now and it can't it can't go any further we have to wait just a minute until this happens over here to catch up what's he talking about when the squeeze come down when this great council begins to tighten up that's what he's referring to we have to wait just a minute until this happens over here to catch up then the time comes but it's thoroughly identified so who's going to have that manifestation of the third pool prophet's gone we've seen it temporarily but you're going to see it in the fullness of its power where in the message shalom brother venom says and we all know that's the identification we know that's the third pool is we all understand that now you've got you have the tape see and i think listen to what he says i think it'll just lay dormant for a little while until the great hour of persecution comes on that's when it be it'll speak it'll be manifest just like the five straight signs without failure perfectly when he says those five straight signs he's talking about first squirrel second squirrels hattie wright the storm he speaks to out of existence in colorado and his wife's tumor the five straight times and he says and i want to read this quote again in shalom 1964. and we all know that that's the identification we know that what the third pool is we all we all understand that now you you have the tapes see and i think it'll just lay dormant for a little while has it been laying dormant brothers and sisters it's been laying dormant until the great hour of persecution comes on that's when it be it'll speak not you'll speak it'll speak and when it speaks it needs a mouth and whose mouth is it going to be i say let it be mine oh god let me live a consecrated life so obedient to this word that when it's time for the third pool to speak when it's time for christ to speak again that he can use these lips right here amen that's the full harvest maturity that's what he's coming to where we don't go off half cocked we don't say what we think we don't just make up stuff but it's a real genuine divinely inspired of god's word it's a real genuine faith that's revealed to us at the time it's needed and we speak and move forward not presuming no presuming whatsoever but a genuine knowing that something that you know beyond any shadow of a doubt and you're speaking it comes to pass we're coming to that time amen how many believes it's on the doorstep we can see everything in the nation changing and everything around the world changing just as there's a persecution coming against the jews you better believe there's the same persecution coming against the bride because what happens naturally happens spiritually as well and brother branham already prophesied he already told us what's going to happen and now that that third pool that that spoken word has been laying dormant for a little while waiting for this persecution to come on and then it'll speak what's he need he needs a bride in maturity what's going to bring us to maturity the full revelation of the full word of god will bring us to harvest maturity you're not going to get there playing games you're not going to get there spending all your time with entertainment that's not going to work brothers and sisters we're coming to full harvest maturity when it's time to lay aside foolishness and things that distract and things that take our time and things that divide our attention and it's time for us to focus on what he gave us he gave us the full sunlight of his word to bring us the full harvest maturity and nothing else is going to work i don't know about you but i'm ready to go oh i'm so ready to go i say consecrate me lord make me lord if you need a vessel you can have this one if you've got to clean it up clean it up if you've got to purge it purge it but use me oh god take me o god use me o lord how many would say that's your cry amen it's time for what we've seen temporarily to come into full power amen and i say let it be me let's all stand musicians if you want to come i just want to read one scripture together while we're standing don't put your bibles away quite yet in chapter 9 there's an interesting wording that i really like in esther chapter 9 verse 24 because haman the son of hamadath of the agagite the enemy of all jews had devised against the jews to destroy them and it casper that is the lot to consume them and to destroy them is that what the devil's tried to do this is a pretty accurate description of what the devil has tried to do to god's people he's tried to consume them and he's tried to destroy them but in verse 25 it starts off with but i love it when it's talking about destruction and consuming and destroying the people of god and then god is so kind to put a butt right there but that was haman's plan but haman had devised but haman has sought to consume them but when esther you know esther means star esther's name was hadassah which means myrtle and it was changed to star sounds like the royal seat of abraham to me are they not the stars in heaven this queen happens to be a star part of the royal seed of abraham but when esther came before the king he commanded the letters that this wicked device which he devised against the dew should return upon his own head and that he and his son should be hanged on the gallows haman has devised a plan to destroy your life haman has devised a plan to destroy the elect's seat of god to consume them to destroy them to cast them out but when esther came into the presence of the king amen everything changed amen are you esther have you been in the presence of the king it's time for everything to change all his wicked devices come back on his own head that's what brother branham said is going to happen to the devil all his wicked devices through the blood of the bleach of jesus christ goes right back to the originator everything that he put on you when you pass through that blood it takes it back to its original form and what was its original form it came from the devil it goes back to the devil he's destroyed by his own vices he's destroyed by his own plans when when esther comes before the king hallelujah let's pray dear heavenly father we thank you for your word lord we just ask that you would just anoint us lord to take our position just like you did esther lord a little girl out of obscurity lord you cleansed her lord you purified her you called her out and you cleanse during your purity fire in the house of the women under the tutelage of haggy eye and lord you've done the same thing to us tonight god we've heard the instructions of haggai and we've we've kept them to the tee we've not added our own thinking our own lifestyle our own design but we've went according to all that haggai has said and lord you've come into your presence and you've chosen us lord and god we're learning more and more as we travel in this life what you think of us how precious we are to you and that we're joined heirs with you and you've given half the kingdom to us but there's something yet to come in the story of esther and that's the third pool ministry in esther when you tell her to say and she speaks not when you decree but the decree of esther is what begins to be written in the book lord i just pray that you would let it be this humble little people that's here tonight that we can live such a consecrated life to your word that you can purge us by your word wash us by your word sanctify us and cleanse us so that you can use us in your service lord we saw what you did in the wave chief and we're expecting you to do it again in the full harvest lord i pray that you bring us to maturity and help us to be consecrated vessels for your kingdom oh praise the lord i pray that you would defeat haggai and me as you would destroy the wiles of the enemy in my flesh lord in my life by your spoken word that you would have the victory in this house right here lord i pray that you would speak through these lips that you would love lord through this body should minister through us in jesus christ's name we love you lord and thank you and ask your blessings as we go keep us safely on the road and lord give us somebody that we can talk to and share this life with god i pray that you bless the weekend meetings come up bless brother abraham as he travels in lord help us to come back this weekend with great expectations to hear from you we love you lord we ask for your blessings in jesus christ's name amen i just want to remind you in the story of esther when esther finally got the decree and haggy i wrote out the instructions of what the jews were supposed to do they were no longer afraid of what their enemies were going to do to them [Music] as soon as the bride had spoken what she wanted and it was stamped by the seal and put in the action guess what all of those jews did they took up arms and went on the offensive our days of defensive are over brothers and sisters i'm tired of what the devil's trying to do to our families i'm tired what he's doing to our minds tired of what he's doing to our homes and amen i'm going to kick him out at every turn because i am not on the defensive anymore because there's been a decree that's went out through the bride and don't forget that brother branham's part of the bride he's not separate of the bride he's the first part of the harvest that came to maturity what bro what what part of the harvest part of the bride the first part of the bride to come to harvest maturity he's part of the bride he's in the bride those works are still in the bride amen and when the decree went out through the bride and mordecai put the seal on it and acted in the law then the chosen people of god went into action fighting for their rights and i'm fighting for my rights this word is my right healing is the children's bread deliverance from sin that's in the book and it's mine and i'm no longer in defense of hoping cowering that the devil won't come after me again i've heard the voice amen i've read the decree and now i know that i have a right to take this word and take what's mine no more defense it's time for an offensive amen let's just sing this song again just dedicate our lives to the lord you can be dismissed as you need to be god bless you we'll see you again saturday night
