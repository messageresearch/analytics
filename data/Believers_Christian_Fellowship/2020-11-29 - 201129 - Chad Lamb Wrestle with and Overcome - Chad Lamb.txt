i am in him and what i'll do and what he'll accomplish to this vessel and i thank god for that and while we're standing let's turn to jeremiah 29. begin reading from there as you turn there i just want to thank everybody who was praying and those who were able to attend the funeral yesterday for brother steve smart's father eugene smart and then we had a nice funeral many of the people that were gathered i didn't know they were strangers to me and i had never had the opportunity to meet steve's father before but as steve sat down and began to share his testimony and share that he was a believer in the message and he was the one who led steve to the message and i you know it's got that familiar feeling to it you know that same testimony that we have and brother steve told me he said i want the message preached at my dad's funeral i said praise god i can do that and so by the grace of god that's what he allowed us to do is we just preached the message we just preached what gene believed to his family and to his friends and and i just talked to him very straight about what the message is what gene believed why there was a need for a message why god sent a prophet who that prophet was and what was accomplished by that prophet coming and they listened very intentively and in um i received quite a bit of feedback from several of the individuals that were here folks i never met before but family members shook my hand and said that was powerful i appreciate what you said thank you for that and then as they left i invited them to take a church ages book if they wanted to know better what gene believed i'd set seven church age books out on the welcome desk and invite them to take the booklets that were back on the wall and by the time i walked out here all the church age books were gone and several of the individual booklets were gone and then one of the ladies that were here uh met my wife and and the voyeur and she had a stack of three or four or five message books that she had gotten out of the rack and she was telling angie how wonderful the service was and how much you appreciate what was said and i said you never know what god's going to do or what form matter what setting he's going to use and i just ask that you'd be praying for brother steve that god will give him wisdom that is his family would have questions that god can use him as a tool to lead them to christ and that the things that were said that wouldn't fade away from their heart but god would pierce to the heart there's a seed laying there that it would quicken to life amen so i appreciate those who are praying those who are able to come and support and pray that ask that you continue to pray and those are things we long for opportunities to tell somebody the message of the hour the way of escaping this day how to find the ark of safety these are things that we love to talk about and every time you have a set of fresh ears it's so much fun to tell somebody the truth amen what we know amen and i think sometimes we get bogged down because we've had such rejection if you've been in the message and shared the message very much you've had rejection amen and we've met with rejection but but you know if you're rejected 50 times but find that one it's worth it amen and most all of us are here because somebody told us the truth amen and we thank god for that and so just continue to pray for that and we just ask god to have his way i also want to say hi to matthew god bless you matthew mcgeary and gabriella and their family they're here visiting it's good to have you hopefully i get a chance to shake your hand before you leave brother amen let's look at jeremiah 29 and verse 13 and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your hearts not a half-hearted search but with all your heart you shall seek me and you shall find me when you search for me with all your heart let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father we thank you lord for your word we thank you for the testimony from the funeral yesterday and what you were doing in the lives of many we pray that you would comfort those that have lost a father and uncle a friend a brother comfort the family lord but take that word that was sown into their hearts and drive it deep lord and let it take root and grow and be a bountiful harvest for your glory bless our brother steve lord as he has affairs to arrange and things to take care of for his family and for his father i pray that you give him wisdom lord if it would be any in the family that would have questions that he would have inspiration from you on how to answer lord that you would use him as a tool to minister to those needs god as we come to the service this morning we thank you god for your presence for you promised to be here because you said wherever two or three are gathered in your name you'll be in our midst and you're here lord and we thank you for that help us to never take that for granted may these times be precious and dear to us lord may we benefit fully from each one i pray god you would speak your word now lord that there be no hindrance to it in man in the weakness of flesh or in any spirit that would try to hinder but we ask that you would take preeminence in this place and take preeminence in every heart and every life that you would have your way with us in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated also i'd like to make a quick announcement i forgot to make last week but we've decided to go ahead and plan for our watch night service this year so on december 31st which will be a thursday evening at 8 30 p.m we want to gather here for a watch night service so being that it's thursday we're going to cancel the wednesday night service on the 30th and we're going to move service to thursday on the 31st at 8 30 pm here and then we're going to serve communion at midnight or as close to it as we can so if god lay on your heart a song special or or something that you'd like to share in the way of song at the watch night service i like to set aside for just us to gather together we're not going to video it we're not going to record it it's just for us to gather together at church and thank god for what he's done for us this year this has been a strange year and that might be putting it lightly but we have a lot to be thankful for god has brought us through in many ways and he's grown us in many ways and changed us in many ways and we want to take time to thank him for that thank you for healing us thanking for preserving us and then we want to look forward to see that god as preeminent one in our lives and he does what he wants moving forward so if you want to sing a song of thanksgiving you have something on your heart amen will just start working on that you can get with one of the song leaders and they'll start putting that together i just now said that so i might have to talk to them and come up with a better plan but you can talk to them anyways they'll come up with a plan those are good fellas amen amen so so this morning i want to talk about wrestle with and overcome for just a little bit and i you know god has laid this on my heart and i just want to share it uh maybe just take my time not a long time but just to share from my heart and i really want to talk to to to the young people really the young people and the teenagers but it's for all of us but that's kind of a target for me uh this morning if you will the way god's laid it on my heart i want to look at revelations 5 together if we could turn to revelations 5. revelations 5 and verse 5. and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth unto all the earth i'd like to read a quote out of the breach what brother branham says and john started crying he's referring to here to revelation chapter 5 and john started crying because no one was worthy and no one could even look at the book oh it took a human being john wet because no one could do it and everything was lost and there came a voice from one of the elders standing in the midst of the four beasts and all that great host of heaven said don't weep john oh my the grace of god don't be brokenhearted john don't weep for the lion of the tribe of judah the root of an offspring from david hath prevailed prevail means wrestle with and overcome that's where i get the title this morning wrestle with and overcome and i want to talk about that he has prevailed prevail means wrestle with and overcome oh my in the garden of gethsemane when his blood dropped down out of his face he was overcoming the lion or the root of david was prevailed has prevailed and has overcome like jacob being a supplanter and when he got in contact with an angel he held on and the angel tried to pull away he said i'm just not going to let you go he held on until he got what he wanted he wanted and his name was changed from sir planter which means deceiver to what to a prince with god israel he prevailed amen so he got a name change amen when he prevailed his name was changed and and we look back at revelation and john is weeping because he knows if there's nobody that can take this and and i i'm trying my best just to share from my heart with young people so pay close attention to me amen and and i'm going to try to bring it as simple from my heart as i understand it not that you need it simple you guys are smarter than me but i just want to share something real direct with you he was he had prevailed he wrestled with and overcame and when you look the call was for a lion we've talked about this before the call was that there's a lion there's now a lion the lion hath prevailed and when he looked he saw a lamb as it had been slain he saw a bleeding bloody lamb beat up and bruised and this was the lamb that had been mocked and ridiculed and rejected and bruised and what was he he was the one that prevailed and so many times that we get the wrong idea when we read these terms and we think that the line of the tribe of judah has prevailed like he went down there with a mighty force and mighty strength and he wiped them all out and he killed them all but the way he prevailed was submitting to the will of the father and becoming a lamb and surrendering himself completely to the will of god and allowing that will of god and the spirit of god to lead him in ways amen that was contrary to a natural mind and the desire of natural flesh the natural mind the natural heart always wants to protect himself avoid danger keep from trouble amen avoid rejection don't say anything that would be contrary and cause a conflict you know that's the human nature that's the natural way amen but as a lamb he surrendered his rights like a lamb does to his father amen in that surrender he was overcoming he was overcoming for you and i he was overcoming everything that had gone wrong in the garden of eden the fall of mankind he was overcoming not as a mighty a mighty force that would go in and just speak and slay he was overcoming as a lamb and in the garden of gethsemane when blood dropped down out of his face he was overcoming you realize uh when he was in the uh wilderness you know he had been baptized at jordan and the holy ghost of the dove descended and rested upon him and the holy ghost led him in the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and in that temptation he overcame the temptation but but in that temptation he overcame but in that overcoming brother man said he didn't use any of his great powers though he possessed all powers all gifts he had the ability to turn water into wine he had the ability to curse a fig tree to die he had the ability to speak to the lame and they would walk he had the ability to heal all manner of seizes cast out all demons but he used none of his power he was overcoming the temptation in the wilderness without power he was overcoming by the word and brother brahm said he was making it he was putting it where the simplest and the humblest of christians can take it and follow after him he was putting it within reach of you and i he was putting it in reach of an 11 year old a 12 year old a 15 year old a 50 year old a 95 year old he was putting it within reach because it wasn't it wasn't uh the lion amen coming down and devouring it was the lamb taking the word and staying with the word and staying obedient to the word and then staying obedient to the word and humbled to that word with no display of a power that would bring him recognition or or would scare away the devil what did he do he took the word amen in simplicity all he did was quote back the word and what was the devil quoting to him the word it was a word battle that was going on in the wilderness and the temptation was around the word amen the devil didn't come to him amen with a a glass of beer the devil didn't come to him with an immoral woman amen the devil came to him with the word and he was trying to use the word in a way that would allow jesus to fulfill a fleshly desire by the word watch this closely now this temptation in the wilderness was an in temptation with alcohol and drugs and and cigarettes and and immorality amen that was not the temptation the testing in the wilderness was over the word amen will you take the word and will you fulfill the desires of the flesh with the word or will you surrender everything and just stay with the word the devil says you're hungry turn these rocks into brother said he could have done it but he told the devil the the word is my bread it's more than my daily bread see he didn't he didn't use the word for selfish gain this is for more than just the young people right here he did not manipulate the word or allow the devil to quote a word in such a way that would allow him any personal gain and he took him up on the pinnacle of the temple and said see all these kingdoms i'll give them all to you if you bow down and worship me and he says it's wrong to worship anyone but god he was what was he tempting him with the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life but it was so tempting because he was in part using part of the word amen and and you know you're able to make these stones in the bread and he was he was tonsilly poking at him and saying well you know if you're really the son of god if you're really a christian why don't you demonstrate some of your power and the greatest power that he could demonstrate was the ability to recognize the tactics of the devil and stay with the word i can't think of a greater power to be demonstrated in this hour amen there's all kinds of powers that can be demonstrated but those powers amen i just say it as honest as i know how to say it you can have all kinds of gifts of the spirit and demonstrate powers and the gifts of the spirit and those powers have been used over and over to manipulate the word and bring deception but the greatest power that i know of is the ability to lay your life down and surrender and stay with the word and not allow somebody or some spirit to take the word and use the word in a way that you can fulfill your own fleshly desires and still be in the word see deception deception in this hour for the message and the message believers deception is not the bar room it's not i mean it's not the worldliness that's out there deception in this hour is the devil coming in and trying to get you with quotes and with the word amen to fulfill the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life to still have your own will and be religious and stay in the word and jesus prevailed when he was in gethsemane he was prevailing how was he prevailing because jesus as a man brother venom said he was 100 man and 100 god now i'm not even going to attempt to explain that i just believe it in in the 100 percent man part brother of them said he did not want to die he did not want to go through the physical pain of calvary he did not want to separate from those that he loved his disciples he did not want to die that was the 100 percent man parts and he did not he did not want the pain he knew it was coming and he said father if you can let this cup pass from me he knows the will of the father he knows where he's going but yet in his is 100 man part he's asking can i bypass this can i bypass this amen and so many times we come to the things in our life is going to require a death to self it's going to require another level of sacrifice another level of surrendering my will my thoughts my ones and when we come to that other level amen it's always i mean we ask the question and it's not wrong to ask the question because jesus did father can i bypass this do i really have to surrender that do i really have to separate from that do i really have to are you really asking me to give that level of sacrifice are you really asking me for that level of death say god can i can i bypass that and that's the tricky time because that's where the devil will slip in and that devil will come in and he'll give you quotes and scriptures and reasons for why you don't need to surrender to this it's the truth it's the truth take the word and manipulate it into a way because if the devil can get you to fulfill your own selfish desire he has knocked you off the plan of god can we take the word by manipulation of the word paint it in such a way that there's relief now there's relief from sacrifice i say it's never good to have relief from sacrifice from personal sacrifice amen jesus was in gethsemane and what was jesus doing in gethsemane overcoming second time father can this cup pass from me he said but nevertheless thy will he was wrestling it out he was fighting and listen friends this wasn't just a little go off to the corner god what do you want this or that okay but he was in so much agony he was in so much physical agony as a human being in the physical agony that he was sweating as it were great drops of blood were coming out friends this is torment this is agony this is pressure this is trouble amen like you and i haven't faced and in that he is still able to say father but not my will and he's so he's so troubled and he's so discouraged he comes back to his disciples and he rebukes them he says could you not wait with me one hour you're leaving me all alone you don't understand what's happening i'm also all alone i'm isolated my soul is exceedingly heavy and exceedingly troubled unto death he said and in gethsemane he was overcoming there are some times that you will overcome and it won't look like uh it won't look like sometimes what we think the testimony service should look like when we say we overcome sometimes our overcoming is alone in the wee hours of the night when nobody's around and we're troubled in our spirit and we're so troubled we're torn and ripped to shreds on the inside and we don't know what to do but god's requiring a greater level of sacrifice a greater level of death to self and we're all caught up in this and we finally surrender our will to god and nobody knows and we don't write it down on a testimony and there's no legs restored and no blinded eyes open amen and there's no great manifestation of power to bring us any glory amen but what happened there was overcoming real genuine overcoming because self was sacrificed self was subdued and the word was put in its place what is the word it's our husband it's our headship amen it's the headship of the body the word of this hour the word that's been restored and we were able amen in the wee hours of the night to be real genuine overcomers and we can't write out a testimony and put it on the desk and have it read because nobody will understand god was asking us to give up some personal little thing god was asking us to separate from something or someone or some place and in the battle many of you have been through the battle you've served god for a while you've been through the battle amen reasoning starts to kick in and it starts to grab scripture and starts to grab quotes and it starts and listen your reasoning will start to massage what the prophet said it will and if you've never been there you will be there the enemy will be right on top of you and begin to take a quote and a scripture and begin to massage it and and paint a picture in such a way that you know you don't have to give this up you don't have to surrender this and those are the hours for the overcomers to say not my will but i will be done i don't understand why it has to be this way i don't understand why i have to give this up i don't understand why this is so important to god i don't understand why the prophet said it that way but i don't have to understand it's fine with me i take it as it is and i believe it and i surrender to it see growing up in the message you can hear so many versions of the message you can hear so many ideas and so many concepts and and it's it's become it's become to a place where you can find the version that suits you best and attach ourselves to that version because it's the version of the message that suits me as my personal human being the best now i'm not at all saying there's not a place where you fit and god has put you in a place and you fit into that place and that place you fit shouldn't should be a match for you it should fit you should match i'm not talking about that but i'm talking about willful selfishness and self-desire things we want to do things we want to things that we want to be okay and things that that we want and we know full well amen we've checked in our heart we know full well it's not right there's a question mark around it and we're just not so certain amen and there's question marks here and question marks there amen and so many times what we'll do is we'll find a voice that will tell us it's okay to go around the question marks amen so that we can quiet that still small voice on the inside and still get to do what we want to do but in gethsemane jesus was overcoming and when we looked at an overcomer when we looked at the line of the tribe of judah the one that had prevailed and overcome when we saw that picture when john looked he heard the announcement of a lion and he was going to see a mighty one a victorious one mighty in battle powerful amen the king of the jungle when he turned the way that the lion overcame was as a lamb and as a bleeding lamb surrendered to the will of god sometimes what god wants is a bloody lamb from us we're mighty warriors that's the truth but we're mighty warriors under the banner of the word not fighting for our own way not mining for our own likes or for our own desires but what we're fighting to do is just uphold the word of god and its purity in the way it was delivered he said brother random goes on to say in the breach a lamb stepped up the elder said the lion has overcome the lion of the tribe of judah and john looked to see the lion and there come a lamb shaking blood on him wounds he had prevailed you could tell he'd been in battle he'd been slain but he was alive again sometimes victory doesn't look like what we think victory looks like in the eyes of the world sometimes victory sometimes victory looks like defeat and what looks like defeat is many times victory what looks like weakness many times his power that can be confusing until you've been through it what looks like a weakness many times is power because it's a power to bring this body subject to the word and bring this body subject to the word it can appear like a weakness amen it's humility it's many times brokenness it's surrender amen it's no self glory no vain glory no no self involved at all and it may look weak and it may look humble and it may look obscure and there's no there's no flash there's no showmanship there's there's nothing to it it's just humble and it's just meek and many times it can be broken and shaking and bleeding an individual broken and weak and trembling and shaking amen and what are they they are the overcomer they're the ones who are mighty in battle this is the invincible army because they'll never be destroyed amen they will never be destroyed because they're standing with the word and standing on the word standing behind the word amen and they can know the word can never be defeated but the lamb part the flesh part can be tore up can be beat down can be mocked ridiculed rejected cast out is that true it can happen and what many times look like weakness many times is a great victory on display where somebody by the grace of god and the spirit of god in their lives are able to say amen i will not i will keep my body and i will bring it under subjection like paul said i keep under my body i buffet it amen i keep under my body to keep it in subjection amen and many times that is power on display in the message the lamb and the dove prophet of god says now i want you to notice another thing the lamb was a willing lamb to be led it was willing and god lamb god's lambs are willing to be led by god's spirit my sheep know my voice a stranger they won't follow see brother bam says sometimes when you get to a place where you meet somebody who's a know-it-all they got the answer to everything he said stay away from that because that's not how god does stuff god will god will will get somebody out on the limb amen and they'll get down a path and they've been led by the spirit of god and then they know that they're where they're supposed to be but they get to a place where where there's no other place to go they get to a red sea they get to a jordan they get out on the limb where they can't go any farther amen and you ask them what are you supposed to do next and you say i don't know where are you going next i don't know what is god doing in your life i don't know that doesn't look like strength that doesn't look like power that doesn't look like mine that doesn't look like a mighty warrior but i'm telling you if they were led if every footstep was led by the spirit of god and they get up against a jordan in a trap and there's no way out they get out on the limb that can no longer hold their weight and there's no other place to go amen that is power that is might that is overcoming right there and it doesn't look the part but it is the part because they were led here by the spirit of god and they're not going to take their own reasoning or their own mind but we'll wait patiently if it's weeks if it's months if it's years we'll wait until god does something to show the next step that's overcoming we wrestle with and overcome we have to wrestle with this guy brother branham said my biggest enemy is william branham it wasn't the denominations it wasn't the spirits it wasn't the 200 000 000 demons that was released out of euphrates that wasn't his biggest enemy that was his enemy but it wasn't his biggest enemy his biggest enemy was self and jesus showed us how to overcome in gethsemane and your biggest enemy is not i mean it's not the government it's not any other power or force amen your biggest enemy is the one that you look at in the mirror in the morning that's why i tried to avoid the mirror i don't need it to comb my hair because i don't even want to look at that guy all my problems all my troubles everything i struggle with is because of that guy that's looking me in the mirror but everybody says you want to blame it on the devil said the devil made you do he said the devil never made you do it you did it of your own selfish lustful desire you did it because you were tempted being tempted you were led away of your own lusts that's what james says no man is tempted of god but he's tempted he's tried he's tested when he is led away of his own lusts and that word lust for young people it doesn't just mean immorality lust amen is anything that you crave or you desire or you want you can lust for an ice cream cone it doesn't make it bad unless it's your tenth then it could be bad you can desire like jesus desired to eat this last meal this last supper with his amen many prophets and women desire that's the same word lust and desire it's a strong desire not every desire is evil amen but the selfish desire is evil you fall we fall we don't fall in sin we don't fall because somebody trapped us although there may be a trap set we don't fall amen we fall because we're led away of our own lusts we're enticed of our own desires and we need to wrestle and overcome that that's why it would be so much better if we realized if everybody if every believer could realize who the enemy really was we wouldn't have any more problems in churches or between churches or or any of that because the problem is not out there the problem is right here and if i could ever conquer this guy and keep him subdued to the word i would never have another problem the rest of my life because every problem i got is because i'm enticed when i'm led away of my own desires but if i can bring every desire every thought amen every imagination captive to the obedience of christ which is the word then i can have victory see we need the word we need the message we need the scripture so much more than we ever realized because just going to church is not enough in fact church is a wonderful place to hide church is a wonderful place to hide because we hear the truth and we can respond to the truth and we're around all the people and there's a great atmosphere it can even feel good we can even like the atmosphere but what we need is the word because the word is what will overcome the word is what will subdue our own lustful desires because when we check it with the word we'll find out that's not the will of god that is not what god wants that is not what god commanded i now must subdue my will and die and buffet this guy and bring it under subjection and and i must put down the flesh and let the word take preeminence take the headship so you realize it's a battle of headship who's going to be the head you are the word you are christ amen let's continue with this quote from the lamb and the dove now it's it's a willing lamb and another thing it was a self-sacrificing lamb it had no selfish motives the lamb was willing to give everything it had a little lamb you can take him out there and he's only got one thing that belongs to him and that's his wool you can throw the little fella up on the table and tie his feet i've done it many times and shave every bit of the of the rights that he has away from him and he'll stand still but oh how different we are oh my you try to shave us one time oh yeah brother we got hot under the collar and tell them off don't we or we just leave the church or we just find a another quote i mean it's the same it's the same thing over and over or we just say i don't know god you've got to judge me god i've been deceived by my own thinking so many times you know so many times when we react and we get flared up we get angry we get upset we heard this and we don't agree with it we think this is wrong and that is wrong but listen friends don't don't forget that your mind is corrupt your emotions are not correct amen and so many times i have been deceived by my own self to the point where i don't trust myself i want to stop and be patient and not react so fast sometimes and just say god show me in your word show me the truth show me what you want amen but how different we are you're trying to shave us one time oh yeah brother we get hot under the collar and tell them off don't we then you wonder what's the matter with us that's right oh a lamb is a willing lamb you say now brother branham and what do you mean listen here you say i'm an american some of you women say i'm an american last week you preached on the way we are wore our makeup you preached on the way we wore our shorts out on the streets and things i'm an american citizen i've got just exactly the right to do what i want to as long as the law puts up with it they sell it in the store that's my american privilege i know but sister if you're a lamb of god you'll forfeit your rights you'll forfeit your constitutional rights for the lamb amen to be a lamb you'll forfeit laodicean rights to be a lamb that's right yes sir you'll forfeit it you say well if i want to stay home and see who loves susie ever what them things are they look at that's my own american privilege i know it but if you're a lamb you'll forfeit it because it's not sheep food amen you say it's american my american privilege if i want to put some beer in an ice box and drink a good gold cold glass at night when i come home from supper that's my own american privilege i know it sir but if you're a lamb you'll forfeit your rights to become a christian that's exactly right amen see we want i don't know about you but so many times we want we want to be seen as powerful and capable and and all these things but jesus when he stepped forward on the scene and what brother branham called the most sublime scripture in all the bible when he stepped forward to take the book he was the lion that had overcome but when he stepped forward to take the book see god god has nothing to prove jesus is not about saving a reputation or looking good in the eyes of man i mean he's dealing with the reality of things and when he when he come forward when he stepped forward in the most sublime scripture in all the bible when he stepped forward to take the book how did he take the book he took the book and the form that he prevailed in as a humble lamb submissive to the will of god if it meant beating it was beating if it meant if it meant losing his reputation he lost his reputation losing his friends he lost his friends if it meant crucifixion he would take crucifixion because he was a lamb see samson was a mighty warrior simpson in mighty power he had mighty gifts he had mighty strength and samson in his gifts he could destroy the enemy out there but samson's gifts and his power could not destroy the enemy in here he could slay demons by the thousands he could cast out demons by the laying on of hands he could anoint with oil and pray for the sick you see what i'm saying he could he could fight demons out there amen but he couldn't overcome himself his own selfish desire and his own lust amen to have a woman that was not his not rightfully so amen he could not sampson could conquer the philistine sampson couldn't conquer samson let's look at this let's go to judge just for a minute let's go to judges chapter 16. let's go 16 and verse 27. samson has been captured he told his secret to delilah and she was trapping him and see the philistines did not defeat samson samson defeated samson and delilah did not defeat samson sampson defeated samson because none of them could touch him as long as he stayed with the word but when he gave up the secret it was willing to give up the promise the covenant with god when he was willing to tamper with that and give it up now delilah could defeat him the philistines could defeat him so samson was defeated by samson and you and i are defeated by ourselves he says in verse 27 he's been captured his eyes have been plucked out he's been down chained to a mill grinding at the mill wasting away but he felt that his hair was growing back the covenant was coming back and now as the covenant's coming back when he lost the covenant he realized how weak he was you know we can get the idea that because god has blessed us how many has been blessed by god abundantly blessed by god healed and delivered and provided for and that's the way samson was under the covenant promise and samson begin to think amen that it was him that it was him that was conquering it was him that was defeating it was him and he didn't realize it was the promised word that he was under and sometimes we think that it's us that's been successful i got a raise at work i they told me i did a good job and i figured this out and i accomplished this and i amen you don't realize you're under the blessings of a covenant it's not you it's the covenant that god has with you and he's promised you promises of taking care of you and providing for you and it's not your intellect it's not your ability i mean it's god because if we take that covenant away from you for a little while watch what happens to you you'll wind up amen like samson you'll wind up with your eyes poked out no more vision amen you walked up with your covenant chopped off and you'll be grinding at the meal wondering what happened and sometimes in god's grace he lets us get a taste of that every once in a while every once in a while god will let us do it on our own and when it comes to absolute ruin amen he'll come by and he'll let you it'll let you know that was you samson grinding at the male samson with his eyes plucked out samson but he feels a covenant coming back i promise he remembers the promise it says in verse 27 now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of the philistines were there and they were upon the roof of about 3 000 men and women that beheld while samson made spore and samson called unto the lord and said oh lord god remember me i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once o god then i may be at once avenge the philistines from my two eyes and samson took hold of the two middle pillars of which the house stood on a stood and on which it was born up of the one with his right hand and the other with his left and samson said let me die with the philistines let me die with the philistines and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were there on so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life i say the same thing's true for you and i friends and the collapse of the house samson parted with his greatest enemy which was himself he finally recognized and he said let me die with the philistines he wasn't looking to save his life preserve his life to have his way anymore he was just there to finish his commission which was to deliver israel to begin to deliver israel from the stronghold of the philistines and he bound himself down with all his mind and what was he doing he was getting back in the purpose of god back in the calling of god and when he bound himself down he made an absolute full surrender as a lamb and said let me die with the philistines because his purpose his calling was to begin to deliver them from the philistines and so he didn't just destroy the enemy out there but but he had destroyed the enemy in here oh i wish i wish that i could have that same approach all the time let me die not just slay on my enemies let me die let me surrender let me be a perfect lamb because that's where real overcoming comes in that's where real power is on display that's where really that's where things really begin to move when you can't move them but you've surrendered to the force that can that's when real moving takes place as long as we can do and we think we can do it sometimes god will let us do it and all we do is sometimes prolong our own deliverance or we keep muddling up things that don't need to be muddled up anymore but what we need to do sometimes is say just take me slay me i cannot fix anything i cannot do anything i cannot get this right i'm just going to lay down here and ask you lord to take care of this for me and show me what you want me to do let's turn to genesis 32. i want to take a few minutes and look at the life of jacob genesis 32 first i'm going to read this quote here from hearing recognizing acting on the word of god so you must realize then friend what condition you're in that's the reason this tape i said to the church only to the church only if you've been called from light from darkness and delight from death and the life from a formal intellectual conception of christ to a born-again experience and watching your life and it lays in the things of the world aside and it lays the things of the world aside and you stand for christ regardless then something's happened there's something in you hungering and moving like it was jacob you wrestle with the lord you walk different after that something's different in you you've changed mother rams now is going to start typing us with jacob and we're going to read the scripture but he says if you're willing to lay all the world aside and you don't want it anymore i mean something in you has changed there's been a change that's taken place and in genesis 32 verse 28 it says and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince has thou power with god and with men and has prevailed that's the same word prevailed wrestle with and overcome see jacob was in trouble jacob with his own intellect had had found a way to get things for himself he had gotten the birthright off of his brother he had gotten the blessing with the help of his mom and and their their devious plan to deceive his father he went to laban and he got a wife and and he was deceived there and he got two wives but but before he left he had deceived his father-in-law amen and come up with a plan that would allow him to to get all the cattle from his father-in-law and he and he spoiled his father-in-law as he left see jacob in his own human ability with his own intellect he was able he was called brother ben called him a shyster a supplanter is what the bible that his name actually meant the brotherhood said little shyster he was able to wheel and deal and he was able to pull a fast one here and there and he got the birthright and he got the blessing and he spoiled laban's household but eventually that all catches up with you i promise you some of some some here are more and more intellectual prowess than others some have more abilities than others some can wheel and deal some can overcome some have a strong will we all have different things but when we continue to exercise those things for our own personal gain i tell you at some point there's going to be a day of reckoning and jacob had deceived and deceived and gained and gained until he now he's coming back into the land and he's coming back into the land he finds his brother esau is now coming and he believes his brother esau is coming to destroy him and rightfully so because all of his own efforts landed him in a heap of trouble and so now jacob he separates all his wealth and he separates across the river and he takes his wives and his children here and he goes alone across the river and now jacob because jacob has got himself in a fix by his own his own strength his own ability has gotten him in this place why because of his own lusts has gotten him into place now he's in desperation it's amazing that we do this to ourselves so many times of our own lusts and our own desires and of our own strengths we get ourselves in a place of desperation but praise god though jacob was the one who was guilty though jacob was the one who had worked his own intellect and got him to this situation amen jacob had no way to get to the angel but the angel came to him god is so faithful amen he he he's so faithful that it'll allow us you run that way that's fine there's a day of reckoning coming and when we finally get on our face and cry out to god and get desperate before god and we got a mess on our hands amen it's he who knows how to find us jacob 32 or sorry genesis 32. verse 28 he wrestled with the angel and the angel says and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince has thou power with god and with men and has prevailed and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou just ask after my name and he blessed him there and jacob called the name of the place pineal for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved who was it that jacob was wrestling with he was wrestling with god and as he passed over pinwell the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh this experience for jacob changed his walk for life motherboard is going to refer to this and he's going to type it with a new birth experience he got into a place where he had made himself a mess and all around him was a mess and he had got himself in trouble by his own intellect and his own in his own lust and his own willfulness amen but in desperation amen he come in contact with god amen and when he when he grew and god came to him when he come in contact with god amen for jacob it was not a light thing it was not a trivial thing but for jacob it became desperation and he got a hold of this angel which he called a man and he got a hold of this angel and he wouldn't turn him loose and he said the angel said turn me loose and he said i'll not turn you i'm not turning you loose until you bless me and how did he bless him friends what was the blessing that jacob walked away with there was two things that jacob walked away with in this blessing he had a new name and he had a new walk that was the blessing he didn't give him money he didn't give him promises of wealth he didn't give him anything when he said i will not let you go till you bless me he touched his thigh amen and it shrunk up and he changed his walk and he changed his name from sir planter to prince because he was a prince with god see the blessings that we need friends are not money and wealth and good jobs and god has promised to clothe us the lilies are clothed amen the sparrows are the god has promised that that's not what we need friends what we need is an encounter with god where we come in contact with a true and living god amen and we get a hold of him and said i'll not let go till you bless me and what will that blessing look like it won't be a position in a church it won't be a better job in a better car but if you ever get the blessing from god if you meet him face to face and wrestle it out with him the blessing you'll get is a change in your name and a change in your walk [Music] this is this is what i want to tell you young people amen you got to have an encounter with the living god amen don't go your own way and don't use your own intellect and don't think because i know about the message and i know to stay away from this and i know to follow this listen because you know right and wrong because you've been taught what god likes and doesn't like there's a certain amount of blessings that comes from living a righteous life and you will be blessed and you will be sheltered and you will be protected but that is not the same as coming in contact with the living god and him touching the hollow of your thigh and changing your walk for the rest of your life and giving you personally to you a new name amen don't be mistaken because many times by an intellect and good upbringing and parents that love you in a church that surrounds you you can come to a place where you can keep the things of god and in keeping those things of god by your own willpower and your own understanding there'll be a certain amount of blessing and protection and you will succeed in natural life but don't be surprised if god allows all that to come to a dead end someday where even your ability your understanding and your knowledge and your ability to do right and wrong won't be enough and all your plans and all the selfishness that we held on to and wanting to do it our own way but still you know the religion keeping it right some point god will allow us to come come to a dead end and say it's not working anymore i'm getting myself in trouble and that's the grace of god because when you get to that place it's he who finds you not you who find him he finds you amen i'll give you this advice when he comes your way and you know you're in the presence of god you may not see a man in a robe you may not have any physical anything you can put your hands on but when you know you've come in contact with the power with the living god get a hold of it with everything you've got and say i cannot turn this loose until you bless me and don't ask for anything physical friends it's not the physical that you need amen it's a change in your life and it's a change in your name jacob became israel because he held on he prevailed with god and with man he wrestled it out and he overcame and what was his victory march like after that it never looks like what we think overcoming looks like god sometimes will let us go through things we come and i let those things scarred we come out of those things halting upon our leg sometimes for the rest of our lives never able to fully get over that leaving the word of god never able to fully get over that selfishness and my own selfish desires have taken me down the wrong path wrong choices in relationships wrong choices in marriage is wrong you can't get past some of that but when god comes down and changes your walk and changes your name that becomes a victory march amen because you're able to stay with the word stay with the word surrender myself surrender my will surrender my life and stay with the word brother ram goes on to say now he had to divide the lands and there were 12 tribes to divide it by now what if he had some uh picks and pets he's talking about joshua what if joshua would just give preference to this one or that one what if he had picks and pets and what if he liked the tribe of gad better than that did the tribe of ephraim the tribe of joseph better than he did judah but he didn't do it that way he divided according to the word revealed by the spirit he divided according to the tribe and notice he done it by the revelation by discernment by the discernment of god's spirit he did it and each one of those hebrew mothers giving birth to those babies called their name each one of their name has a meaning jacob when he was born being a twin she called him sir planter jacob but he got his overcoming power and wrestled with the angel god changed his name from jacob to a prince israel a prince the name has something to do with your life when peter a fisherman had overcome by his faith in jesus he said your name is simon but i'm going to call you peter which is little rock it changes you your name has something to do with it your placement in this life the change in the name had something to do with jacob becoming israel had something to do with just change had something to do with his placement in life and in the exodus journey when the mothers were bearing the children they would call out the tribal name over them as they were born and that tribal name would place them in a certain place in the land and i tell you when you're birthed in the kingdom today it matters what name is called over you when you're birthed because we're not birthed under a former tribe of a former denomination we're not birthed under under wesleyanism we're not birthed under pentecostalism but we're birthed in the bright age amen we're birthed amen we're birthed in the bright age we're birthed into the bride because where your birth amen the name that's called over you in your birth amen has to do with your position in life and where you're placed we don't want to be placed in a former age we want to be placed in another tribe amen those were all tribes those were all five they all had their position they had their placing amen but i want to be placed in the right place today your name has something to do with it your placement in life to all in the message in his presence oh what a great thing it was now to know that he had wrestled through that he had seen signs of god he had dreams about god but this was one time he was in the face of god in the presence of god think of it friends now as we hurry up in the presence of god a man has changed a jacob was changed now he could walk with god excuse me he could walk with god yes he was a different man than what he was when he went up there the battle was now over he had wrestled and overcome i want to read a lengthy section on the first seal this will help me wrap up my thoughts said i wish i could stop on that just a minute oh my i got a good notion but maybe nobody knows it did you ever know the name of jehovah is not correct anybody knows dr vale you know it's true the translators could never translate it spell it j-u-h-v it means it's it isn't jehovah they they couldn't touch it they don't know what it is called it jehovah but it wasn't his name look every time a victory is one or something goes on a name has changed catch that jacob prevailed with god and his name changed to israel look at the days of abraham he was abram and never could have had the baby until his name was changed to abraham and sarah could could not have nothing but a dead woman until her name was changed to sarah jacob means supplant or deceiver and that's what he did he put sheepskin on himself and deceived his prophet father to take the birthright he put poplar sticks in the water speckled them and scared the cattle when they was pregnated with their young to make speckled cattle and sheep nothing but a deceiver but one night he caught a hold of something real and he knowed it was real and he stayed with it and held on until he overcame and his name was changed and called israel meaning prince with power before god is that right every overcomer simon was a fisherman but when his faith caught and no that was jesus when he told him he was the messiah and told him who his name was and what his father's name was he was overcome and changed from simon to peter saul was a good name saul was a king one time in israel but saul didn't fit an apostle might be all right for a king but not an apostle so jesus changed his name from what from saul to paul look at the sons of thunder and oh now and jesus his name on earth was redeemer jesus when he was on earth he was the redeemer that's true but when he conquered death and hell and overcame and ascended on high he received a new name that's the reason they holler the way they do and they don't get nothing it'll be revealed in the thunders i'm going to talk about this for a minute but just just hang on to that i'm going to finish the quote and we'll come back now the mystery he is coming writing there's got to be something to change this church you know that there's got to be something noticed no man knoweth but himself what's that his name now notice no man no node but himself and he was clothed with a vester dipped in blood and his name was called the word of god he's reading right out of revelation 19. and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed and fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword with that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he tread the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god and he had on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords there comes the messiah oh thank you brother i'll take that right now god has answered my prayer and he had a vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords there comes the messiah there he there he is not this fellow on this horse back here what's the difference it's talking about the pale horse rider here he stands with the book in his hand here the redemptive work he hasn't took his place yet so it was not christ that went forth the holy spirit not disagreeing with them great men no sir i don't do it i wouldn't want to do that but this is what my revelation of it is see you got something different well that's all right but it ain't all right with me i believe it this way and notice christ is not seen anymore from that time there but he is on a white horse so if this guy is riding a white horse he's only an impersonator of christ get that notice the writer on the white horse doesn't have any name he might use two or three titles but he hasn't got any name but christ has a name what is it the word of god and his name is called the word of god that's what it is in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word made flesh see and the writer has no name but christ is called the word of god that's what he is he is called that see every time there's a great victory there's a name change and now we see him in revelations 19 and in revelation 19 he's already come through revelations 5. he took the book revelation 10 amen the mighty angels descended with the book and now he's gathering his armies to come to the great standoff on the battle of armageddon and he's got a name because there's been a victory there's been redemption he's been the kinsmen redeemer redeeming through the church ages but now he's coming to claim his possession and when he comes to claim his possession amen he's got a name amen and his name is called the word of god because in this hour it's been revealed to us that he is the full revelation of the word of god the mystery of god revealed is christ he is the word and we know him we know his name it denotes a great victory i want to read out of a message called how can i overcome i'm reading just a few things but i hope by the grace of god we can tie it together so just let me lay these pieces down now look let's take now the 12th verse he's in revelation chapter 3. this to the church of philadelphia in the 12th verse him that overcometh what i make a pillar in the temple of my god he shall go no more out and i will write upon him my name name of my god in the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from god and i will write upon him my new name he's saying now there's there's promises and we know that these promises amen the promise that's given to one age carries over to the next stage the overcomer of ephesus we're given a right to the tree of life amen and brother ben said now that right to the tree of life is for every overcomer that overcomes in every age so now if we overcome laodicea as we've overcome what's overcome it's the same word as prevail to wrestle with and overcome we've wrestled with people's rights we've wrestled with laodicean conditions we've wrestled with and overcome by what surrendering like a lamb by giving ourselves and he says now you have rights all of these promises if you overcome in this day all of these promises are yours because they're promises to the overcomer but here in the philadelphian age he said and i will write upon him my new name watch what the overcomer is promising now the laodicea that's the last church day there's going to be some overcomers in there watch they remember each church age the one proceeding inherits all that the other ones offered watch up here now here it's after they done received all these powers these new names and everything written that he promised and eat the hidden man and all down through watch the last church age revelations 3 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcome and i'm sit down with my father in his throne he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches there's the reward for the overcomers press on lily he throws this in he was talking about this earlier press on lily he's talking about the little lily amen and the he always admired a pond literally because upon linde starts out under the waters down in the muck and the mud amen and down in there there's a life a beautiful life laying there but it it's a life that is uh uh not on betray it's not displayed it's a hidden life but it's got a push through the muck what's it doing it's climbing its way to the sunlight there's light penetrating through the water and light coming down through the mud and that light and when it hits the seed it's starting to bring a life out of that little lily and it's moving up through the mud and it's coming up through the muddy water and when it gets up out of the water it spreads forth amen and it begins to bloom and brother branham thought that was the most beautiful flower of them all because of the story that the lily tells and then it gives its fragrance for all to enjoy here he comes now and he's talking about the promises to the overcomer and he says press on lily press on be an overcomer push through the mud push through the muddy water amen we can't be lazy christians amen when we come in contact with the living god amen it would not have worked for jacob to have a change if jacob would have come in contact with the angel and said hey you have a nice day and if you think of me down the road would you send back blessings my way but he was in a desperation he couldn't fix his own problem he had messed himself up and could not fix himself and when he come in contact with the living god he had enough sense to get a hold of it and not turn it loose till it changed him and brother man i was talking about the overcomer in each age overcoming overcoming overcoming to wrestle with and prevail he says press on lily don't stop amen until we come to full bloom know a half-hearted effort is not going to work you'll seek me he says in jeremiah and find me when you search for me with all of your heart it's not enough to be associated with the message to know it to have heard it to grow up in it to attend the church we've got to come in contact with the living god we've got to get a hold of it we got to press hold uh uh whatever we have to do we have to wrestle with and overcome until until that that we got a hold of changes our lives so it changes our walk until it changes our name see when jesus was on this earth it wasn't the people that were casually you know in the marketplace when jesus walked by they didn't really get a whole lot but it was the blind bartimaeus who would cry out and keep crying out and when the others tried to get him quiet he would cry out the louder and jesus would turn to him it was the woman who would press her way through the crowd amen just to touch to him of his garment amen it was the four friends who would rip the roof off of a building and lower their friends in that got healing you realize friends this is when god came to jacob amen it wasn't as though god was disappointed when jacob got a hold of him amen god come to jacob and and god wasn't he wasn't angry with jacob the angel said turn me loose he said i'll not turn you loose until you bless me see we can't be casual about god we can't be casual about the word you can't you know blind bartimaeus couldn't have been sitting there when his opportunity came when god come by his way amen he could have sat there and said oh he didn't come very close maybe next time maybe maybe he'll pass back through the woman with the blood of you had caught a revelation and if i touch the hem of his garment she didn't look at the crowd and say oh i'll get trampled there's no way to get there i'm going to have to push and i'm going to have to fight i might wait to a more convenient time the friends who had the the lame men that they lowered on the mat you know they ripped up somebody's roof to do that amen they didn't think you know maybe we'll find a more convenient time we'll catch him out but no they they knew where god was they knew where god was working and they had to get there they had to get to him and i think we need the same kind of desire whatever it was in jacob amen what it was ever in those people who had to get to the lord we've got to get to him friends you young people you've got to get to him it's not good enough to come to this church every day of your life and pay your tithe and believe the message you've got to come in contact with the living god and when you get in contact with him you've got to aggressively get a hold of me and not turn loose and say you've got to change me i can't do this on my own i can't do with my intellect i can't do with my reasoning i have no ability to overcome i need you to change me don't wait for another opportunity or another day today is the day of salvation if he's here if you know he's here if his presence has come and touched you get a hold of him amen get ahold of him and don't turn him loose don't be casual about the message don't take it or leave it don't be casual don't put it off for the future but take it take it unto yourself devour it feed on it become one with it and be aggressive about it amen i've got to have a change i've got to have a change something has got to bring a change it's got to change my name and it's got to change my walk you know when god knew that simon was really a peter peter didn't know he was a peter he was all his life a simon but god knew he was a peter and because god knew he was a peter god would make sure he would get down close enough to where simon could recognize who he was and in the recognition of who he was he could turn around and change his name when he changed his name he changed his identity and he placed him saul didn't know he was paul right saul didn't know he was paul and saul amen saul was was was using his own intellect and his own reasonings and his own strengths and he was having great success in the jews religion and he was finding himself in great positions and in in in the jewish religion everything was working fine for saul but saul had had a flawed identity he had spiritual amnesia he thought he was saul the great zealous pharisee he didn't realize he was the apostle paul the light to the gentiles he was in the midst of identity crisis and didn't know it but the only one that could give him his true identity was a living a living god a present tense god could give him his identity and he made sure that he found he found palm simon didn't find jesus jesus found simon saul didn't find jesus jesus in the form of pillar of the pillar of fire found paul i asked your friends has he found you did you find him or did he find you amen why are you here why are you hearing the things that billions have not had the privilege to hear millions who have heard it have rejected it but you're here and something in you can recognize that there is a god here amen there's a present tense god here and it's the message of the hour it's the word of god he's here he's present i'm telling you friends get a hold of him amen don't wait for him to pass by another time don't wait for the crowd to get lighter don't wait for more convenient time if you've got to rip the roof off rip the roof off amen if you've got to miss a week of school and work to stay in your room and pray through amen get to him and get a hold of him until you know that something has changed my desires have changed my thinking has changed something in me has shifted gears i meant a new creation a new creature amen get a hold of him and say god changed me changed me changed me i don't want all my life to be a message believer i want to be one who's met a living god and got a hold of him and i want to be one who's wrestled with and prevailed god this is just brother chad but from reading the scriptures god was not ever looking for a casual believer to take it or leave it i think so maybe looks good to me i think it must be right where was that in the bible but he was looking for those that would press he was looking for those that would wrestle with and overcome those that would take a hold and not let go those that would say you must bless me you must heal me you must change me and i want to be that kind of believer amen if you're a young person here if you've never had that experience amen where you know something's changed amen press through and get ahold and say god i'm not letting go of this message i'm not letting go of you amen i'm staying right here until i know that you've changed me that i've met you and something has shifted on the inside and my desires have all turned heavenward i need you to change my walk change my wants my desires my thinking the things that are in my heart that nobody knows about but me they need to be changed they need to be changed and i need you to change my name in the message once more prophet of god says you say a name means nothing then why did he change abram's name to abraham why did james saul's name depaul simon's name to peter why did he change his own name why did he change jacob to israel not until he wrestled with the lord and not until he overcome and when jesus overcome death hell in the grave the bible said he had a new name and when jacob overcome and if the church can overcome she will stop saying i am methodist baptist presbyterian she will stop saying i'm a message believer she will stop saying i'm a member of this church and i'm a member of that church and i go to this and that church those aren't wrong things to say but if that's your identification it hasn't went deep enough so the church can overcome she will stop saying i'm methodist i'm baptist and presbyterian when she can overcome her creeds and the world that draws her there she'll come back to the bride of jesus christ misses jesus christ she will get a new name amen and that's not a name a preacher can give you amen that's not a name any human being can give you there's only one way to get that name change and that's when you come in contact with jesus christ himself and he tells you you are my bride and he changes your name and changing your name changes your identity changes your placing amen changes everything amen then you become mrs jesus christ his name is called the word of god what is the word of god today the word of god made flesh today is the bride is the manifestation of christ in bride form mrs jesus christ it is the word made flesh it is the identification of this day it is the identification of the hour it is our portion in the promised land and we must be birthed under that name jesus christ must come to us personally we must get a hold of him personally individually not a church not a group amen individually we must make contact with the living god and that living god has to do something has to touch us in a way that changes our lives changes our thinking changes our walk amen and changes our identification to now spiritual amnesia goes away and from that point on saul knew he was paul simon knew he was peter jacob knew he was israel and from that time on you'll know that you're the bride of jesus christ that you are mrs jesus christ not because somebody pointed at you from a pulpit and said it but because jesus christ in a personal meeting with him has told you he's whispered a love secret in your ear and he says you're one of them you're mine you belong to me and i'm marrying to you and then your identity changes your walk changes and you can say i am mrs jesus christ not because of what the you know brother branham come in the first seal and he says no i'm gonna i'm gonna call you bride he was making a declaration amen because every time there's a victory a name changes he said i no longer call you church i call you bride because there was a great victory that was taking place in the opening of the seals the lamb had done the mediatory work he had been the redeemer now he was coming forth the kingdom and redeemer to claim his redemption to unite with his bride there was a great victory taking place amen in revelations chapter 5. and in the first seal amen to denote that there's a great victory taking place he the prophet changes the name from church to bride and when he said that it was nothing but the truth but he was speaking to a category of people he was speaking to a category of people amen you need more than that you need jesus christ revealed personally to you you need it not a prophet who would teach that there's an invisible union but you need to come into an invisible union amen not just be surrounded by people in an invisible union but you yourself has had to go behind the veil and unite with a living jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i'll tell you he's here where do i go to find him he's here he's hearing the revealing of his word he's hearing the message he's here the fullness of the holy ghost is here don't let him pass by don't wait for another day blind bartimaeus had one shot and he wasn't going to lose it the woman with the blood issue she had a revelation in her heart if i could just get to him it'll be well and she made sure she got to him this isn't the hour for passive religion this isn't the hour to sit back and say well i'm only 12 i'm only 13. i'm only 17. i i'm only it doesn't matter where you're at are you coming in contact with jesus christ is he calling your name amen can you sense that he's here can you tell that there's a present tense god there's a god on the scene there's a present god here and he's coming in contact with you what are you going to do with that contact now what are you going to do with that contact today what are you going to do when he comes in contact with you and you know the presence of god is here are you going to let him pass by and look for a more convenient time are we going to say god i'm coming i'm coming god get a hold of me i'm getting a hold of you we're privileged to believe this message we're privileged to have this word we're privileged to have jesus christ identified to us now let's get a hold of him and let him identify us to us so we can see him in the mirror of his word and so we recognize who he is and let him tell us who we are that's the only way we'll get the proper identity for this day the only way amen those disciples who had a name change the only way they could get their true name amen was to come in contact with jesus christ and the only way for you to get your true name your real name is to come in contact with jesus christ you come in contact with him don't be passive don't say well he knows well he knows of course he knows he showed up when jacob was in a time of need who knew what who knew the most god or jacob he knows yeah he knows he he come by because there was a woman had needs to go by and samara he knew but she had to get a hold of something he knows that's why he comes by that's why he calls your name by revealing the mysteries that's why he woo's you with his love story with all his love secrets he's wooing you to himself he's here he's calling you he's calling you to himself he's drawing you by the revealing of the word he's present amen but he'll it's just like when he was on the water he come to the disciples walking in the water and he acted like he was going to walk by he was their deliverance he was their only choice for hope he was the only way that they could make it but he was going to act like he was going to pass by so that they would cry out when he was with him on the road to emmaus he was there and their hearts were burning within them as he spoke to them along the way and then they were in the contact with jesus christ and their hearts were burned they were having a reaction to the opening of the word and at the end of the day he acted like he would just go on but they compelled him and they implored him to come in see jesus christ is a gentleman he doesn't force his way on anybody he doesn't force his way on you but he'll pass by and he'll begin to break the word to you so that your heart begins to burn as he speaks to you along the way and then he'll act like he's just going to pass on and i might be back here wednesday and i might be back here next sunday but don't let him pass on today implore him to come in compel him implore him beg him amen say lord you're here i know you're here amen my heart's burned within me i feel your presence i know it's a real god i know it's a living god oh god i want to get a hold of you amen i want to cry out i want you to deliver me because i can't deliver myself don't let him pass by don't settle with a church name don't settle with the name of message believer message believer is not good enough the only name that gives the right identity is mrs jesus christ the bride of christ don't stop pressing till you have your identity don't stop pressing until you've something's changed something's shifted you know that whatever it was before is different now i think different i feel they're all my desires are different don't stop pressing little lily don't stop pushing little lily the sun is shining keep pressing towards the sun this is for young and old alike friends the sun is shining keep pressing for the sun don't be passive don't be trivial about it get aggressive amen it's time to get aggressive and say god i've got to have more of you i've had you in the past amen you you've given me an experience i've got a new birth experience but i want more i want something fresh i want something for today i need something now i've had you in the past you changed me you changed my walk you've given me and i did it you've given me a name but oh god i feel dry and i want more of you amen i want less of me and more of you i'm like a little lily pressing towards the lie i'm coming through the muddy water lord i'm pushing my way up i'm coming to the light there's a push and a pull not just a pull there's a pull and a push there's a magnetism god is drawing but there's lives or seed here that are magnetized to that draw and they're two forces coming together and those two forces coming together it's not passive friends it's aggressive and it doesn't mean you have to shout like blind bartimaeus for all to hear and it doesn't mean that you have to crawl on your hands and knees like the woman with the blood issue but however god has come in contact with you and however you get a hold of him just be sure of one thing that i've gotten a hold of him and i'm not turning him loose until he changes me it can be quiet it can be loud it could be today it can be months from today but just get a hold of it friends reach out and grab a holder and say lord this message is you you are present tense you are here and i'm grabbing a hold of you a living god today and i won't turn loose i will feed on this word i will give my life to this word i will wrap my arms around it until you change me then way too many people thought they were okay know about the message and know the details of the message know the timelines and and the quotes and then they find out there was not actually no change no identification because if he ever reveals your true identity to you into your name you don't walk away and call brother branham a liar and say it's all fallacy this is the time to wrestle and prevail god is here friends job was looking for this day job job was saying where is god hey he moves before me and i don't see he's behind me he works but i can't find him to the right i can't discern it to the left i cannot recognize him he's all around me but i cannot find him where is his house that i might go knock on his door that i might ask him questions job wanted to find god and i tell your friends god has come down in this day jesus christ has come and made himself so plain through the message of the hour he's standing here the mighty god unveiled before you with no covering the only covering that is left is the covering on your heart but he has uncovered himself and if we can break past the veil of traditions and break past the veil of denominations we can see the mighty god unveiled he has unveiled himself he is here where is he what do i get a hold of you just get into this word friends and you'll see him he's here grab a hold of him young people grab a hold of him old people get a hold of him and don't let go just walk with him talk with him don't let him out of your sight don't let him out of your mind don't let him out of your heart hold on say god change me and keep changing me and keep changing me until i come into that perfect image that you had of me before the foundation of the world i want to die i want to be like samson i just want to die i want to be like jesus christ i want to be able in gethsemane to wrestle it out and say not my will but your will i want to prevail i want to be the overcomer because the promises are to the overcomers those that wrestle with and prevail wrestled with my own flesh paul wrestled with his own flesh he said i buff at my body i keep under my body to bring it in subjection he taught us how to possess our vessels amen i want to wrestle and prevail i want to wrestle this flesh and this objection i want to hold on to the word with all that i've got until it changes my life but i tell you there's no other way there's nothing else that'll change our lives it's this revealed word is it right the life that's come with this word when that life comes into you by the revealing of the word it'll change your life and it's the only way to have a change in your walk and it's the only way to get your true identification has got to come from the revealed word amen get a hold of it devour it keep a grip on it don't lay it down for recreation and don't lay it down just hold on to it friends don't substitute it for anything else get a hold of jesus christ the word made flesh the revealed word for your day get a hold of it and say i'm not letting go of this message until it changes me musicians if you could come blake if you could come first john 5 4 says for what who whatsoever is born of god overcome with the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith that's by grace not of yourselves it is a gift of god if god's given you something to believe with believe if he's given you something that that woman with the blood issue had she had something that all the other people in israel that day with a blood issue didn't have she had something in her heart that says if i touch his hand i'll be well and if god has put something in your heart that says if i can just hold on to this word i will be fine i will be changed i will have him and he will give me my identification what's what put that there it's a revelation that comes from god revealing that this is jesus christ this word and if i get into that amen and he gets into me i'll be changed and i'll get my true identity can we sing do you know a song reach out and touch the lord as he passes by let's all stand you guys know me i'm not a gifted evangelist but i've got a heart for god's people [Music] we've been too passive too long sometimes it's hard when you grow up and you hear the same things over and over and over again but at some point you have to say this isn't for everybody around me and this isn't for me someday but this is for me today this is for me now this is what i want this is the desire of my heart this is what i i want to be changed i want to have my identity come from jesus christ not from just a preacher or from a parent or from an association with a group of people but i want an identity that come from an individual revelation of jesus christ personally to me you've heard it heard terms and heard about it but there comes a time when you say i want it i don't want to hear about it i want it i want to get a hold of it and i want him to get a hold of me i want to be changed [Music] you know like i said i'm not a gifted evangelist i don't know how to pull to the altar and get you to come but i don't desire that i want something real i'm not looking for 20 30 40 to flood the altar so that i feel like it accomplished something i'm looking for one person to be born again i'm looking for one person to say whatever he preached about he was preaching to me it was for me and this is my day and i'm going to get a hold of it and i want god to change me and give me my identification [Music] i don't want the vindication of a flooded altar i don't want the vindication of everybody saying a raising of hands that's not what i'm after i want something real to take place in the heart of one of god's children i want a new birth experience for somebody who hasn't had one yet i want somebody to be born again to get their identification from jesus christ not from me but from jesus christ to say you're my bride i'm gonna see that life live a life of surrender and a life of sacrifice and a life that's given over a lamb's life given over to the lamb amen if that's you amen as we sing you can just pray friends just reach out and touch him get a hold of god you can come to the altar if you want to come to your pray in your seat you can stand in your seat it doesn't matter to me this isn't for me this is you and him you and him however he leads whatever you want to do but if you want to
