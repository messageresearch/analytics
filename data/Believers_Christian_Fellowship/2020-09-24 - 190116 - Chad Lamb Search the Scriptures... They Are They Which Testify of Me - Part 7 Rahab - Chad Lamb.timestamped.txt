[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] there is
[0:33] [Music]
[0:41] praise the lord man i think i'm on
[0:45] yeah god bless you all let's take our
[0:48] bibles where we're standing and turn to
[0:49] luke 24.
[0:51] we are continuing on in the same subject
[0:53] search the scriptures part 7
[0:55] which is super unusual for me
[0:58] but thank god i'm enjoying myself
[1:02] i am absolutely loving the word of god
[1:05] and and you get to a place where you
[1:07] read it so much you read it so much in
[1:09] the same passage
[1:11] year after year you read and and you you
[1:13] kind of think you know you get to a
[1:15] certain passage of scripture well i've
[1:16] read this before
[1:17] but all of a sudden it's like you've
[1:19] missed half of it
[1:20] like where have i been all my life
[1:22] what's happening
[1:23] amen and it's god he he can hide himself
[1:27] and reveal himself amen and it's amazing
[1:29] his ability to do that
[1:31] in the same scriptures amen that we've
[1:33] read for years
[1:34] he's able to unfold himself in the same
[1:37] we didn't rearrange the ink blots you
[1:39] know it's all the same
[1:40] but all of a sudden it's new again amen
[1:43] and i just
[1:44] appreciate the way god does that it
[1:46] encourages us and we're so thankful for
[1:48] them
[1:48] while we're standing quickly let's look
[1:50] at luke 24
[1:51] and 44.
[1:56] and he said unto them these are the
[1:57] words which i spake unto you
[1:59] while i was yet with you that all things
[2:02] must be fulfilled which were written in
[2:04] the law of moses
[2:05] and in the prophets and in the psalms
[2:07] concerning me
[2:09] then opened he their understanding that
[2:11] they might understand the scriptures
[2:14] amen let's bow our heads their heavenly
[2:16] father we thank you lord for your word
[2:19] and god it becomes more rich to us every
[2:21] day
[2:22] lord it's vast and it's unmeasurable
[2:25] it's eternal
[2:26] lord it is you god expressing yourself
[2:29] in the form of your word lord i just
[2:32] prayed today that you would take this
[2:33] vessel of clay lord and that
[2:35] you would move the mind of a man out of
[2:37] the picture lord but you would come
[2:39] yourself
[2:40] and speak through these lips of clay
[2:42] lord i pray that we would hear
[2:43] lord with new ears with spiritual ears
[2:46] to hear what you're saying to us today
[2:48] that we might receive your word in the
[2:51] lord we might grow
[2:52] thereby and become more like you in
[2:54] jesus christ's name we pray
[2:56] amen you can have your seats keep your
[2:59] bibles open we'll read through this
[3:00] again
[3:01] as you're seated i just wanted to make
[3:03] mention
[3:04] i should have said something over a week
[3:06] ago but we're moving into the season
[3:08] where we start to have some bad storms
[3:10] and
[3:10] many of you may have seen they're
[3:12] predicting a bad snowstorm for this
[3:15] weekend what will happen as we get there
[3:17] nobody knows it might go away
[3:19] it might get worse it might who knows
[3:21] but i just wanted to remind everything
[3:23] everybody of how you know we we cancel
[3:25] if we have to cancel or what we intend
[3:27] to do
[3:28] so first of all the goal is if at all
[3:30] possible we're going to have church
[3:33] unless it's just completely unsafe for
[3:35] anybody in this area to come
[3:37] if we're able and locally to have church
[3:41] we're going to come to have church amen
[3:43] but when we when we say that we caution
[3:45] anybody
[3:46] if anybody feels uncomfortable just
[3:48] because we're having church
[3:50] don't push yourself don't feel like you
[3:51] have to get out so if you're
[3:52] uncomfortable driving uncomfortable
[3:54] getting out
[3:55] don't don't worry about it if it's
[3:57] marginal and you're not sure
[3:59] just stay home it's okay but the reason
[4:02] we're gonna get here who can get here
[4:03] everybody with a four-wheel drive
[4:04] vehicle and everybody with a truck and a
[4:06] forward and a snowmobile
[4:08] we're gonna come and we're all gonna
[4:09] pull like crazy so that we can stream
[4:11] the service
[4:12] so everybody who's stuck at home has
[4:14] something to watch amen
[4:15] so if we locally can have service at all
[4:18] safely we're going to have service
[4:19] and we're not going to cancel unless we
[4:21] absolutely have to
[4:23] but sometimes in different areas like
[4:24] this last snowstorm
[4:26] if you were south of i-70 you got
[4:28] hammered but up here
[4:29] it was bad but it was okay we could
[4:31] still get to church so wherever you're
[4:33] at if it's not safe just stay home
[4:35] we'll come we'll pull you stay
[4:38] you pool and we'll have church amen and
[4:41] the last time we had a wonderful
[4:43] atmosphere we were down
[4:44] probably a quarter or third of the
[4:46] people but everybody pulled extra hard
[4:48] and it was wonderful and so we thank
[4:50] everybody for that
[4:51] so that's what we intend to do if for
[4:53] some reason we have to absolutely have
[4:56] to cancel the service what what i do is
[4:59] i'll talk to some of the deacons we'll
[5:00] make the decision
[5:01] if we make the decision sister suzanne
[5:04] will put it on the recording
[5:06] here in the church if you call into the
[5:07] church there'll be a recording saying
[5:08] there's no service
[5:10] we'll also call wtgn and wtg and we'll
[5:13] put it on the radio but also on their
[5:14] website so you can read it
[5:16] franco will put a banner on the website
[5:18] saying it's canceled
[5:19] and on the facebook page or you can call
[5:22] a deacon
[5:24] so we should be able to find out if we
[5:26] cancel church we should be able to find
[5:28] out
[5:28] amen so god bless you just be praying
[5:31] i'm praying we can still have service
[5:32] amen
[5:33] and if it wants to snow piles and piles
[5:35] after we go home that's fine
[5:37] as long as we can have church amen let's
[5:40] look at this scripture again
[5:42] in luke 24 verse 44 and he said unto
[5:45] them now we know what
[5:46] set the stage here jesus has has been
[5:49] crucified he's resurrected from the dead
[5:51] he's now shown him shown himself to the
[5:54] disciples
[5:55] amen thomas wasn't there the first time
[5:58] that he appeared to all the disciples
[5:59] and
[6:00] and he says i'll not believe unless i
[6:02] stick my finger in the
[6:03] in his hands and my thrust my hand into
[6:05] his side and so now
[6:07] jesus appears again when thomas is there
[6:09] and he tells him
[6:10] you know thrust your finger here and
[6:12] thrust your hand here and see that it is
[6:13] me
[6:14] and thomas says my lord and my god and
[6:16] he says hey
[6:17] you you now now you believe
[6:20] but blessed is he who doesn't see and
[6:22] yet believes so here we are in the
[6:24] setting this is the setting of the
[6:25] resurrection amen so this is a
[6:27] resurrection time
[6:29] this is a resurrection setting and this
[6:31] gets important because we've come
[6:33] back to a resurrection time we've come
[6:35] back to a resurrection setting in our
[6:38] day
[6:38] so now in this resurrection he begins to
[6:41] speak to them
[6:43] and he said these are the words which i
[6:44] spoken to you while i was yet with you
[6:47] that all things must be fulfilled
[6:50] all things must be fulfilled which are
[6:52] written in the law of moses and in the
[6:54] prophets and in the psalms concerning me
[6:57] then opened he their understanding
[7:00] that they might understand the
[7:02] scriptures
[7:04] now it wasn't that they didn't know the
[7:05] scriptures because he said i told you
[7:07] these things
[7:09] he talked about these scriptures he's
[7:11] talked about these things
[7:13] these men amen they grew up going to
[7:15] synagogue they grew up hearing the
[7:17] scriptures
[7:18] it wasn't that they never heard the
[7:20] scriptures or didn't know the scriptures
[7:22] but they didn't understand the
[7:24] scriptures so
[7:25] one of the things that jesus christ does
[7:27] in the resurrection
[7:28] is he brings understanding of the
[7:31] scriptures
[7:33] amen and brother branham says in the
[7:35] message it is the rising of the son
[7:37] he says act christ was the first one to
[7:39] raise from all the prophets and so forth
[7:41] although typed in many places he was the
[7:43] first fruits of those that slept
[7:45] in the bride coming of christ coming out
[7:48] of the church
[7:49] they'll have to be a sheaf waved again
[7:51] in the last days
[7:52] oh my waving of the sheep what was the
[7:55] sheaf the first one that come to mature
[7:58] the first one that proved it was a wheat
[8:00] that proved it was a sheaf
[8:02] hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm
[8:04] talking about
[8:05] [Applause]
[8:07] amen i'm sure you see what i'm talking
[8:10] about
[8:10] i don't know how many that they saw but
[8:12] i thank god for eyes to see it today
[8:14] amen amen
[8:20] i'm sure you see what i'm talking about
[8:21] it was waved over the people and the
[8:23] first time there will come forth for the
[8:25] bright age
[8:26] for a resurrection out of dark
[8:29] denominationalism
[8:30] so now we're talking about a
[8:31] resurrection another resurrection
[8:34] out of dark denominationalism what's
[8:36] resurrecting out of dark
[8:37] denominationalism
[8:38] christ the word and we've come to
[8:41] another resurrection
[8:43] only it's not a resurrection out of a
[8:45] out of a cave
[8:46] tomb over and over in judea but now it's
[8:49] a resurrection
[8:50] out of dead denominationalism where they
[8:53] took the word
[8:54] and they they they they bound the word
[8:58] in their chains of creeds and dogmas for
[9:00] nearly 2
[9:00] 000 years but to be loosed in the
[9:02] evening time by the evening time message
[9:05] christ the word back in the church again
[9:07] the holy ghost back in the church again
[9:09] so now we see there's another
[9:10] resurrection
[9:12] taking place and it's a resurrection out
[9:14] of dark denominationalism
[9:16] and one of the resurrection works that
[9:18] christ does when he resurrects
[9:20] is to give us understanding of the
[9:23] scriptures
[9:26] hallelujah i'm so glad
[9:31] they will come the first time they will
[9:32] come forth for the bright age for a
[9:34] resurrection out of dark denomination
[9:36] will be a message
[9:38] that the full maturity of the word is
[9:39] turned back again in its full power
[9:42] and being waved over the people by the
[9:44] same signs and wonders that he did back
[9:45] there
[9:46] because i live ye live also speaking to
[9:49] his wife because i live ye live also
[9:51] what a resurrection that was and what a
[9:55] resurrection this
[9:56] is hallelujah are you in this
[10:00] resurrection
[10:01] hallelujah and in this resurrection
[10:03] season amen the word has been
[10:05] resurrected out of dark
[10:06] denominationalism and now it's come
[10:09] amen not for us to feel prince amen
[10:12] and thrust hands and decide amen but we
[10:14] can hear his voice
[10:16] and that he can give us understanding on
[10:19] the scriptures
[10:21] amen what a good day to be alive
[10:26] what a resurrection that was and what a
[10:28] resurrection this is
[10:30] to be quickened from the dead to be made
[10:32] alive in christ jesus by god's
[10:34] quickening power
[10:36] he was waved to them the word which he
[10:38] was was way
[10:39] back to them on the day of pentecost the
[10:41] word made manifest
[10:43] now and as i say it's to be waived again
[10:46] in the last day so now we come
[10:49] in the resurrection time that jesus
[10:52] resurrects now he comes
[10:54] amen to show the sign to prove that it
[10:56] was him amen and then to
[10:58] get them to understand the scriptures
[11:00] and now in this resurrection season he's
[11:03] done the sign of the messiah to show
[11:04] that it's him the resurrected christ
[11:06] present tense here now amen and then he
[11:10] comes
[11:10] comes forth to bring us understanding of
[11:13] the scriptures
[11:14] but then now that wave chief was waved
[11:17] over them on the day of pentecost
[11:18] and now the pillar of fire comes into
[11:21] the church on the day of pentecost
[11:23] and now peter runs out and all of the
[11:25] 120 run into the street
[11:27] amen they're speaking in tongues and
[11:29] every man heard
[11:30] in their own language and he gets up on
[11:33] his soapbox that day
[11:35] and says these men are not drunk as you
[11:36] suppose but what's he start doing
[11:38] he starts giving understanding of the
[11:42] scriptures because he's in a
[11:43] resurrection season amen
[11:46] he that seed within peter has just
[11:48] sprung to life
[11:49] and resurrected and now peter who was
[11:51] afraid of the authorities who was hiding
[11:53] out with 120 who had separated and was
[11:56] in an upper room
[11:57] now when the pillar of fire comes into
[11:59] the church
[12:00] amen now that seed is quickened to life
[12:03] there's a resurrection in the
[12:04] resurrection season
[12:06] and he runs out and say this is that
[12:08] that the prophet joe has said
[12:10] [Music]
[12:10] [Applause]
[12:12] hallelujah now he's bringing
[12:15] understanding of the scripture through
[12:18] the church
[12:21] praise the lord let's turn to matthew
[12:25] chapter one and keep going down this
[12:27] path that we've been on
[12:30] i am enjoying these first six verses of
[12:32] matthew
[12:34] i never realized how rich the genealogy
[12:39] can be
[12:43] matthew chapter 1 verse 1
[12:48] the book of the generation of jesus
[12:50] christ the son of david the son of
[12:51] abraham
[12:53] abraham begot isaac isaac they got jacob
[12:55] and jacob begot judah and his brethren
[12:58] so we see here we've come to one two
[13:01] three four
[13:02] judah being four abraham isaac
[13:05] jacob and judah or isaac yeah jacob and
[13:08] judah
[13:08] comes to four and four is god's number
[13:10] of deliverance and judah is the tribe
[13:13] where the governor shall come forth
[13:14] shiloh shall come forth
[13:16] the scepter the king all of this it's
[13:18] it's the lion
[13:19] tribe it's the king tribe it's the
[13:22] delivering tribe amen
[13:24] so we we find all of this all of the the
[13:27] information all the things
[13:28] brother brennan teaches us amen in the
[13:30] seals we're gonna find it all through
[13:31] here
[13:32] we're gonna find four stages the the
[13:34] number four the number of deliverance
[13:36] seven church ages it's just it's just
[13:39] amazing
[13:41] so come to judah now in verse three and
[13:43] judas begot pharas
[13:45] and zara of tambar and now we've been
[13:47] through tamar and talked about her
[13:49] and how she comes into this lineage and
[13:52] she goes back to the original seed giver
[13:55] amen and so her fourth husband in the
[13:56] fourth stage
[13:58] is back to the original amen because
[14:01] judah is the original of the lion tribe
[14:04] the first one is judah amen who's the
[14:07] lion the king the scepter the ruler the
[14:09] governor
[14:10] is judah and so now she comes to her own
[14:12] and sheila
[14:13] but she comes back to the original to
[14:16] receive
[14:16] original seed and when she receives
[14:19] original seed
[14:20] her who could not conceive before now
[14:22] conceives on the original seed
[14:26] in the fourth stage of this journey
[14:28] which is back to the original seed again
[14:31] the wheat plant and so now
[14:35] back to the original seed now she
[14:37] produced
[14:38] produces not the third son
[14:41] but the fourth son pharas
[14:44] hallelujah so judas b got pharez
[14:49] and zara of tamar and pharis begot ezram
[14:52] and ezra and begot aram and abraham
[14:54] begat amina dab and aminadab begot nason
[14:56] and nayson begot solomon
[14:58] and solomon begot boaz of rahab so this
[15:01] is where we're
[15:02] at now to rahab and then we know in
[15:05] verse five it goes
[15:07] uh and boaz begat obed of ruth so that's
[15:09] the third woman that we've been wanting
[15:11] to look at here
[15:12] in verse 6 and jesse we got david the
[15:14] king and david the king begot solomon
[15:16] of her that was wife of uriahs so here
[15:19] we find out
[15:21] in verse five and six there's three of
[15:23] these four women mentioned so
[15:25] it's like we come down to the number
[15:28] four
[15:28] one two three four and we get to zara
[15:31] marrying judah
[15:32] and then we've got a gap and then all
[15:33] these women are clustered again
[15:35] and so whenever you see things like that
[15:37] you always ask yourself what's going on
[15:39] here why isn't this evenly dispersed
[15:43] because if you look when you look into
[15:47] the
[15:47] uh into genesis
[15:51] the jacob now is a possessor of the land
[15:55] he's living in the promised land that
[15:57] was given to his father
[15:58] abraham passed down to isaac passed down
[16:00] to jacob
[16:01] amen but we know what happens with
[16:03] joseph he's rejected of his brethren
[16:06] he's sold amen and he goes into his
[16:08] prison house he's exalted to the right
[16:10] hand typing christ all the way through
[16:12] but then a famine strikes the land amen
[16:15] in palestine
[16:16] and so now through all these
[16:17] circumstances the children of israel
[16:19] move out of the land move out of the
[16:22] promised land
[16:22] and move down into egypt okay and so
[16:26] now we're going to type this with the
[16:27] church ages because now they're leaving
[16:29] the promised land the word
[16:31] and they're going down into egypt which
[16:32] is a type of the world
[16:35] leaving the word going into the world
[16:37] and so we know
[16:38] judah and his in all of his children
[16:41] were there
[16:42] that generation was the generation who
[16:44] came with jacob their father and went
[16:45] down
[16:46] so judah would be the first
[16:50] judah so we go from
[16:54] judah to pharas
[16:58] to ezram to aram
[17:01] to abinadab to nason
[17:05] and to solomon number seven
[17:11] going through the church age journey and
[17:14] coming back through restoration
[17:16] and it was solomon who's born in the
[17:18] journey back
[17:19] but it's solomon who crosses jordan and
[17:22] goes into the promised land
[17:24] number seven in the seventh church age
[17:27] so these things are all laid out for
[17:29] reasons i mean they're not just
[17:31] they're not just there this way they're
[17:33] here for a reason amen
[17:35] so we find out that they come to solomon
[17:37] solomon's number seven
[17:38] and solomon number seven marries
[17:41] rahab the harlot in the promised land
[17:45] not an israelite a gentile marries her
[17:48] and when he comes to union with her and
[17:50] marries her and we're going to get more
[17:51] into this later
[17:52] what does she produce she produces the
[17:56] kinsmen redeemer
[17:57] which is number eight amen which is
[17:59] always a type of christ again
[18:01] so it's just over and over and over
[18:04] these stories roll and these numbers
[18:06] roll
[18:06] all through the bible so now we're going
[18:08] to focus down on
[18:10] on rahab let's turn to hebrews chapter
[18:13] 11.
[18:16] [Music]
[18:22] hebrews 11.
[18:30] in verse 29 we know chapter 11 to be the
[18:34] faith chapter of the bible the hebrews
[18:35] the heroes of faith as it's often called
[18:38] and we find here rahab mentioned of all
[18:41] the people that can be mentioned in this
[18:43] rahabs mentioned it says verse 31
[18:47] by faith the harlot rahab perished not
[18:50] with them that believed not
[18:52] when she had received the spies with
[18:54] peace
[18:55] so who perished those that believe not
[18:58] so in jericho all the unbelievers
[19:01] perished
[19:01] but it says ray have perished not with
[19:04] them that believe
[19:05] not so by faith
[19:08] by faith the harlot ray have perished
[19:10] not with them that believed not
[19:12] when she had received the spies so what
[19:14] was it that saved rahab's life
[19:18] faith amen by faith she was saved by
[19:21] faith she was justified
[19:22] it was her faith that saved her and you
[19:25] have to say
[19:26] what was it amen what was it that held
[19:29] her house up
[19:30] when all the walls came crashing down
[19:33] amen brother bam said 20 feet thick came
[19:35] in and parts the walls
[19:36] come crashing to the ground at the the
[19:39] sound of the trumpets and the sound of
[19:40] the shouting
[19:41] and they fell flat so that every man
[19:43] could go up in front of him
[19:44] but there was one section of this entire
[19:47] giant city
[19:48] with these giant walls that brother ben
[19:50] said they could run chariot races around
[19:51] the top
[19:52] there was one section that could
[19:54] withstand the wrath of god
[19:57] there was one step instead there was one
[20:00] section that though
[20:01] god in his wrath would demolish the
[20:03] defenses of jericho
[20:05] and demolish all the fortress of jericho
[20:07] but one section
[20:09] could withstand god's judgment
[20:14] what held that up it was faith that held
[20:18] that up
[20:19] faith held that part of the wall up amen
[20:21] and she was given a true token and that
[20:23] token was on display
[20:24] amen and the token amen was
[20:28] evidence of her faith
[20:31] it was an outward evidence of the faith
[20:34] she had
[20:34] so by faith she perished not
[20:38] it was her faith holding her house up it
[20:40] was her faith amen
[20:42] holding the walls intact for the
[20:44] salvation of her and her family
[20:46] it was by faith
[20:49] brother bam says and as i was with moses
[20:51] so i'd be with thee in 1960
[20:54] he says this great harlot rahab became a
[20:56] believer
[20:57] i took her history here not long ago
[20:59] after she was considered and brought
[21:01] into the faith because of her belief in
[21:03] god
[21:04] she was brought into the israelite faith
[21:05] a proselyte
[21:07] she quoted a general in the army of the
[21:09] israelite army watch what god did for
[21:11] that woman
[21:12] they moved up in bethlehem and they had
[21:15] a son and
[21:16] and this son they called him boaz and
[21:18] out of boaz he married ruth from ruth
[21:20] and boaz came jesse
[21:21] and out of jesse came david and out of
[21:23] david came jesus hallelujah
[21:25] why faith cometh by hearing hearing of
[21:29] of a god that's a god of heaven and
[21:31] earth and believing on him
[21:33] believing what this is what we talked
[21:35] about last time but this is really
[21:36] important because it matters what we
[21:38] believe
[21:40] because by faith rahab amen by faith ray
[21:43] have perished not with them
[21:45] and that believed not so what was it
[21:47] that she believed in
[21:49] amen that gave her so much faith and her
[21:51] faith became an immovable fortress
[21:53] what wasn't she believed in well it
[21:55] wasn't the crossing of the red sea
[21:58] amen it wasn't the destruction of the
[22:00] armies across
[22:01] jordan it wasn't the signs it wasn't the
[22:04] miracles
[22:04] because she testified herself we all
[22:08] know what god did when he dried up the
[22:10] red sea
[22:11] we have heard of what god did in the
[22:13] destruction of the armies across jordan
[22:15] we have heard of these things and all of
[22:18] our hearts do faint
[22:21] so everybody in jericho believed
[22:24] in the supernatural signs they believed
[22:27] in the hand of god
[22:28] and they knew that it was god that was
[22:30] doing it amen
[22:31] so it's not believing in that amen there
[22:34] was something specific that she had to
[22:36] believe in
[22:37] and her faith in that thing was the
[22:40] thing that god
[22:41] recognized and saved her alive
[22:46] so my faith cometh by hearing hearing of
[22:48] god that the god of heaven and earth
[22:50] and believing on him believing what
[22:53] the commission that god had given to a
[22:56] man named joshua
[22:57] having that commission amen and there
[23:00] was a prophet with a commission amen
[23:03] and part of that commission he had signs
[23:05] and wonders and miracles and healings
[23:07] but you can believe in the creation of
[23:09] squirrels and you can believe
[23:11] in the opening of blind eyes in the
[23:13] healing of cripples amen but that is not
[23:16] the faith amen that is going to move us
[23:18] out of the destruction that's coming
[23:20] because anybody
[23:21] amen who believes in the supernatural of
[23:23] god believes in those things
[23:25] but what is it you have to believe you
[23:27] have to believe in that man's commission
[23:31] and what was his commission his
[23:33] commission was to forerun
[23:35] the second coming of christ
[23:38] that was his commission he was told
[23:42] when the pillar of fire showed up on the
[23:43] river in 1933
[23:45] as john the baptist four ran his first
[23:49] coming
[23:50] you your message will four in a second
[23:54] so he's given a commission and then
[23:56] brother branham he comes down and he's
[23:58] working down through his ministry and he
[23:59] comes in 1962
[24:01] present stage of my my my ministry i
[24:03] believe is where he says
[24:04] he says lord let this be the crowning of
[24:06] my ministry
[24:08] so now he's got a commission and a
[24:09] crowning amen and that is to dress a
[24:12] bride
[24:12] to clothe the bride in the word amen for
[24:15] your glory
[24:16] and so now he's here he's got the
[24:18] eleazar commission he tells us and
[24:20] explains to us
[24:21] he's under an eliezer commission to go
[24:24] and find a bride for the promised son
[24:26] and to bring that bride in union with
[24:28] the promised son
[24:30] hallelujah it's not just the miracles
[24:32] the signs and the wonders it's not just
[24:34] believing that god sent a prophet
[24:36] amen that's the same thing that jericho
[24:39] believed
[24:39] everybody in jericho believed moses was
[24:41] a prophet everybody in jericho believed
[24:43] they crossed the red sea
[24:45] he believed that they destroyed the
[24:46] armies across jordan but
[24:48] could they believe in joshua's
[24:50] commission to come in and divide the
[24:52] land to the rightful owners of the land
[24:55] that's the part that they couldn't cross
[24:57] they couldn't cross that line
[24:59] because they didn't believe that this
[25:00] group of people amen was the fulfillment
[25:03] of the promise
[25:04] they didn't believe this group of people
[25:05] had a right to the word
[25:09] they thought they had a right to the
[25:11] word they didn't believe that these
[25:12] people were the people with the right to
[25:14] the word
[25:18] see it matters what you believe you have
[25:21] to believe the commission amen
[25:23] not just the report but the commission
[25:28] brother ben uh says in the token message
[25:31] in 1963
[25:32] anyone knows anything about the bible
[25:34] knows that the harlot was predestinated
[25:39] oh that does me good a predestinated
[25:43] harlot
[25:45] predestinated to be in that condition
[25:52] that goes beyond goes beyond your human
[25:56] understanding
[26:00] anyone knows anything about the bible
[26:02] knows that that harlot was predestinated
[26:03] sure she was the bible says she perished
[26:07] not with them who believed not that's
[26:09] right but she believed the message
[26:11] of the hour
[26:15] it matters what you believe salvation is
[26:17] in the message
[26:18] of the hour not believing in works and
[26:22] not believing that there's a prophet but
[26:24] salvation is in the message of the hour
[26:28] and god give her a sign by his
[26:31] messengers
[26:32] take a scarlet red streak and tie it on
[26:34] your side remember if you don't tie that
[26:36] streak there or leave it there what
[26:38] we've escaped by we're not responsible
[26:40] for our oath
[26:41] instead if if you are out from under it
[26:43] we're not responsible oh my
[26:45] ray have every predestinated seed in
[26:48] here you get out there and go to hunting
[26:50] them
[26:51] get your daddy your mother for we've
[26:53] just come out under the atonement down
[26:55] in egypt and everything that didn't have
[26:57] that we didn't have under that token
[26:59] perished
[27:01] so begin to explain the token to her now
[27:03] the token
[27:04] amen the token was given
[27:08] in recognition of faith
[27:11] because that's why the token is given in
[27:13] this day the token is given
[27:16] in recognition of your faith because
[27:19] abraham
[27:20] believed god and he received the sign of
[27:23] circumcision
[27:24] which was the sealing of the covenant
[27:26] because of his
[27:27] faith if he didn't believe he would get
[27:30] no circumcision
[27:32] so he believed god and received the sign
[27:35] of circumcision
[27:38] and now amen faith in the word of god
[27:41] faith in the message of the hour amen
[27:44] faith
[27:45] is what god when god gives the token
[27:47] he's recognizing
[27:49] your faith and your faith he is
[27:52] recognizing and when he recognizes you
[27:54] have the faith the right faith and the
[27:55] right thing
[27:56] he comes down and seals it in
[27:58] circumcision by the baptism of the holy
[28:00] ghost
[28:02] you can't just cry for hours and hours
[28:05] and hours on an altar to get the holy
[28:07] ghost
[28:12] it's a recognition of your faith
[28:16] the baptism holy ghost is a seal of your
[28:19] faith
[28:21] so you can't just jump up and down you
[28:23] can't just go through a prayer line
[28:25] now that will be fine if you have faith
[28:27] and if that's god's way
[28:28] amen for him to quicken that faith amen
[28:31] and seal you
[28:32] that's fine god can do it any way that
[28:34] he wants to do it
[28:35] through any sensation through any
[28:37] emotion through anything none of that is
[28:38] excluded
[28:39] but that you can do all of that but if
[28:42] you don't believe the message of the
[28:44] hour
[28:44] there'll be no holy ghost seal if you
[28:48] don't believe the commission if you
[28:49] don't have faith in the right thing
[28:52] at the right time the fully revealed
[28:54] word the message for this
[28:56] hour that we're living in you can cry
[28:58] and go through prayer lines and jump up
[28:59] and down
[29:00] and be anointed with oil and it's not
[29:02] going to come because it's god
[29:04] recognizing your faith
[29:06] [Music]
[29:07] [Applause]
[29:10] hallelujah so if you really truly
[29:13] believe
[29:13] i mean i mean really believe not an
[29:15] intellectual belief
[29:16] not a trying to believe but something in
[29:19] you that absolutely
[29:20] just believes then rest amen because he
[29:23] has to recognize
[29:24] your faith
[29:28] hallelujah if you don't have that
[29:31] knowing faith
[29:31] just say god i need a revelation amen i
[29:34] need
[29:35] i need you to quicken it to me unlock it
[29:37] lord give me a revelation so that i know
[29:40] that i know that i know that this is the
[29:41] truth
[29:46] she believed the message of the hour and
[29:48] god give her a sign by his messengers
[29:51] take a scarlet red streak and tie it
[29:54] on your house now
[29:57] the thread was recognition
[30:00] that she believed the message and then
[30:03] she had to have it
[30:04] on display outside the house for
[30:07] everybody to see
[30:09] that she was a believer there are no
[30:12] secret believers
[30:14] there are no hidden believers amen
[30:20] brother says in the again in the same
[30:22] message the token
[30:23] they must have believed that their own
[30:27] big denomination of jericho was able to
[30:29] resist the wrath of god see their own
[30:31] big denomination
[30:32] see they didn't believe the commission
[30:34] they didn't believe that this prophet
[30:36] was coming
[30:37] to restore the word to open the seals
[30:39] amen
[30:40] and to positionally place a bride in an
[30:42] invisible union with her groom
[30:44] they didn't believe all of that they
[30:46] didn't believe amen in the commission
[30:48] that now
[30:49] now it's going to be the bride coming of
[30:51] christ
[30:54] they just thought that they could just
[30:55] stay in the big denomination system and
[30:57] it'll be fine and god will recognize it
[30:59] amen they had confidence too much
[31:01] confidence in the big old walls amen
[31:04] and so god now brother man is now typing
[31:07] amen this wall city with the
[31:09] denominational systems
[31:10] and it's amazing where we go from here
[31:12] let's go back to joshua chapter 6.
[31:20] joshua chapter 6
[31:25] and verse 2 and the lord said unto
[31:29] joshua see i have given unto thine hand
[31:32] jericho and the king thereof and the
[31:34] mighty men of valor
[31:35] and you shall compass the city all you
[31:37] men of war and go around about the city
[31:39] once
[31:40] thus shalt thou do six days and seven
[31:43] priests shall bear before the ark seven
[31:45] trumpets of ram's horns
[31:46] in the seventh day you shall compass the
[31:48] city seven times
[31:49] and the priest shall blow with the
[31:51] trumpet and it shall come to pass that
[31:53] when they make a long blast with the
[31:55] ram's horn
[31:56] and when you hear the sound of the
[31:58] trumpet all the people
[32:00] shall shout with a great shout and the
[32:01] wall of the city shall fall down flat
[32:03] and the people shall ascend up every man
[32:06] straight before him
[32:07] now we've looked at this and been
[32:08] through this before on this jubilee
[32:10] trumpet
[32:11] it says here when they make the long
[32:12] blast with the ram's horn
[32:14] that ram's horn is the yo bell or the
[32:16] jubilee trumpet that's blown at the time
[32:18] of jubilee
[32:19] amen so we're hearing a jubilee trumpet
[32:22] and when the jubilee trumpet sounds
[32:24] then the walls will come fast go come
[32:26] come down flat
[32:27] amen and you will you this
[32:29] denominational system will be destroyed
[32:30] and you begin to possess the land
[32:32] so it's interesting that that he has
[32:34] them go around
[32:35] once we all know this really really well
[32:37] they go around one time they march
[32:39] around once was
[32:40] with the seven with the seven
[32:43] uh priest with seven trumpets amen that
[32:46] go around once for six days
[32:48] first church age second church age
[32:51] second
[32:52] third fourth fifth sixth they go through
[32:55] all
[32:56] six church ages amen and everything's
[32:58] the same before amen we're going through
[33:00] another church age another church age
[33:02] another church age but when we get to
[33:04] the seventh church age
[33:05] it's going to be different than the
[33:07] first six
[33:09] something very different is going to
[33:11] happen on the seventh that happened on
[33:12] the previous sex
[33:14] mother brethren says in 1964 the
[33:16] masterpiece
[33:17] says like in israel perfect type day of
[33:20] time i just got a few minutes left but
[33:22] in a perfect type in the beginning
[33:23] everywhere that a pillar of fire went
[33:25] was life
[33:26] god was that light and i don't care if
[33:28] it was midnight or whether they was in a
[33:30] good selected place
[33:31] when the pillar of fire moved the
[33:32] trumpet sounded and israel moved with it
[33:35] hallelujah and when the trumpet sounded
[33:37] martin luther moved out
[33:39] amen himself a man after him and then
[33:41] god took the life out of that and
[33:43] brought it on out and laid it down in
[33:44] the grave
[33:45] then out came wesley he saw the big
[33:46] organization so he sounded a trumpet of
[33:48] sanctification more of the word of god
[33:51] when he did that out they moved amen
[33:53] right out of luther right into methodist
[33:56] so he's saying the church ages are
[33:57] moving at the sound of a trumpet
[34:00] he comes to the sixth eel and he says
[34:02] and when messiah was cut off the jews
[34:04] was blinded
[34:05] so he couldn't see that was messiah and
[34:09] and then when messiah was cut off then
[34:10] the gospel in grace age came to the
[34:13] gentile
[34:14] and they came down and god pulled one
[34:15] from here and there and here and there
[34:17] and
[34:17] put them away under the messengers and
[34:20] here and there and here and there put
[34:21] them away under the messengers and
[34:23] he sent forth the first messenger and he
[34:25] preached and the trumpet sounded
[34:28] as we pick it up after a while and then
[34:30] that trumpet was declaring war
[34:33] what were they declaring around jericho
[34:36] this was a war march friends amen in
[34:38] each church age amen the church age
[34:40] messenger would sound forth the word
[34:42] brother branham said
[34:43] every church age they would break a seal
[34:46] amen bring a revelation
[34:47] sound a trumpet declaring spiritual war
[34:49] and then when it was rejected a plague
[34:51] would fall out amen
[34:52] the same thing you have in the book of
[34:54] revelations a seal a trumpet and a
[34:55] plague
[34:56] through each church age so he so he says
[35:00] and then the trumpet was declaring war
[35:02] trumpet always denotes war
[35:04] the messenger the angel came on earth
[35:06] the messenger of the hour like luther's
[35:08] like any of the messengers that we've
[35:10] talked of what does he do he arrives a
[35:12] seal open
[35:13] reveals a trumpet sounds war declared
[35:15] and away they go
[35:16] and when the messenger dies he seals
[35:18] away his group they're put in
[35:20] and a plague falls upon those who
[35:22] rejected it see and then it goes on
[35:24] then they organize get another
[35:26] organization we just come through it
[35:28] so brother branham is showing us amen
[35:30] that that every church age
[35:32] had a trumpet sound and here we all the
[35:36] way back in the book of joshua amen
[35:38] they're going to go around jericho
[35:40] seven times why seven times why not five
[35:44] why not twelve why seven times because
[35:46] you can find
[35:48] amen you can find this mystery secret of
[35:50] god
[35:51] working all the way down through the
[35:53] bible amen he's wanting us
[35:55] to come at the end of time amen when he
[35:57] begins when he breaks the seals and he
[35:59] opens the seals and he reveals the word
[36:01] and now the bible it opened up the
[36:03] entire
[36:04] bible you say the bible was open
[36:07] no the bible was not open until brother
[36:10] branham come and preach the seals that
[36:12] was a closed book that bible was not
[36:14] open
[36:14] but why is it we can preach this today
[36:17] is because a prophet came on the scene
[36:19] amen and he was given the revelation of
[36:21] the seals
[36:22] and when he preached that amen in the
[36:24] preaching of the thunders this bible
[36:26] became a new book
[36:28] it opened up the entire bible it opened
[36:31] up the entire word
[36:33] and he didn't have to change one word we
[36:36] didn't have to have a revision
[36:37] we don't even need a message revised
[36:39] bible
[36:41] we don't have to rewrite it we don't
[36:42] have to change the structure of the
[36:44] words we don't do anything we just take
[36:45] it for the way it is
[36:46] and the way it's been read for thousands
[36:48] of years and hundreds of years
[36:50] amen as scholars have poured over it
[36:51] they're pouring over a closed book
[36:53] and they're probing at it and getting
[36:55] kind of close but now
[36:57] now is the time that the seals have been
[37:00] taken off and it's opened up the entire
[37:02] book
[37:02] and he wants his bride to look down
[37:04] through and say there it is
[37:05] there it is there it is there it is
[37:08] there it is
[37:08] because we've got to have something amen
[37:11] that we can anchor our soul to amen
[37:13] enough faith that's going to change this
[37:15] body
[37:17] and now you're looking at every type
[37:19] every shadow
[37:20] every word what are you seeing you're
[37:23] seeing the whole plan of redemption
[37:24] you're seeing the threefold purpose
[37:26] you're seeing the seventh seal
[37:27] you're seeing yourself
[37:30] and if you can see yourself in this
[37:32] entire bible amen and you realize
[37:35] that i'm not reading the scriptures i'm
[37:37] living the scriptures
[37:39] i don't read the bible anymore to find
[37:42] out what happened
[37:44] i don't read the bible anymore to find
[37:45] out what's going to happen i'm reading
[37:47] the bible to discover what's happening
[37:49] to me right now
[37:51] as you read you say that's me that's me
[37:54] that's what i'm going through this is
[37:56] the position i'm in these are the
[37:57] spirits that i'm fighting
[38:00] they were called hittites and jebusites
[38:03] and parasites
[38:04] amen they were called philistines back
[38:05] then but now you can call them religious
[38:08] spirits and
[38:08] demons of depression and sickness and
[38:11] disease
[38:11] but it's the same thing
[38:17] man now we realize
[38:22] i'm not reading about the new testament
[38:25] church
[38:27] i am the new testament church
[38:33] all the new testament is husband and
[38:36] wife
[38:40] hallelujah so now it's different
[38:44] now you look back and see huh six times
[38:46] around
[38:47] huh seventh day i wonder what that types
[38:54] amen but on the seventh day you shall go
[39:00] around
[39:01] seven times
[39:04] because somebody is going to come along
[39:07] and explain all the mysteries of all the
[39:10] ages
[39:10] in the seventh so we've got to go around
[39:14] for the first stage and around for the
[39:16] second aid
[39:17] and around why because he's tying
[39:19] together all the loose ends and
[39:21] explaining what was left off in every
[39:22] age amen so we got to go
[39:24] through the church ages all again we've
[39:28] got to go around
[39:28] seven times on the seventh day
[39:31] and after the seventh time around on the
[39:34] seventh day
[39:36] now these seven priests
[39:39] are going to blow the trumpet and when
[39:41] they blow
[39:42] the ram's horn the yo bell the jubilee
[39:45] trumpet
[39:45] now it's not just the messengers now
[39:49] it's not just the seventh church age
[39:50] messenger but now
[39:52] the people join in
[39:56] now it's different now the people
[39:59] are being liberated now the people have
[40:01] a part to play
[40:02] before it's the messenger the messenger
[40:05] the priest
[40:05] the messenger the priest but now after
[40:08] the seventh time around
[40:10] on the seventh day and then they all
[40:12] stop and the seven messengers begin to
[40:14] blow
[40:15] all seven at one time
[40:19] and when they blow it's now not just a
[40:21] work for the priesthood
[40:23] it's now not just to work for the seven
[40:25] messengers but
[40:26] now in order for this system to come
[40:28] crumbling down
[40:30] it's going to take a shout from the
[40:32] people
[40:32] [Applause]
[40:34] say i get it i see it i believe it
[40:37] hallelujah
[40:38] i'm free this is our jubilee
[40:42] we're not leaving this for the preachers
[40:46] we've got something to do
[40:50] so now we find out that they blow the
[40:54] trumpet
[40:55] let's go over here to verse 20.
[41:00] chapter 6 verse 20. so the people
[41:03] shouted when the priest blew the
[41:05] trumpets
[41:06] and it came to pass when the people
[41:08] heard the sound of the trumpet
[41:10] and the people shouted with a great
[41:11] shout that the wall fell down flat so
[41:14] that the people went up into the city
[41:16] every man straight before him and they
[41:18] took the city
[41:20] now you realize when these walls came
[41:22] down
[41:23] these are huge boulders and huge rocks
[41:25] amen
[41:26] and they can come down haphazardly in
[41:29] all kinds of different ways
[41:30] and you could have a pile here and a
[41:32] pile there so that you would have to
[41:34] everybody's lined up around it so
[41:35] everybody would have to bunch together
[41:37] to work around this pile
[41:38] that's not how it came down amen it came
[41:41] down
[41:42] flat amen there is now no obstacle
[41:45] standing before them
[41:46] nothing the denominations could do to
[41:48] stop them nothing they could do from
[41:50] hindering them
[41:51] none of the creeds that kept them out
[41:53] none of the doctrines that kept them out
[41:54] it's all brought flat
[41:58] and every man went straight up before
[42:00] him
[42:02] he didn't need a detour there was only
[42:04] one spot
[42:06] they couldn't cross and that's where
[42:09] rahab was
[42:11] because her faith held the walls up
[42:21] verse 21 back in verse 20
[42:25] in the middle the great shout the wall
[42:27] fell down flat so that the people went
[42:29] up into the city every man straight
[42:30] before him
[42:31] and they took the city and they utterly
[42:34] destroyed all that was in the city both
[42:36] man and woman young and old and ox and
[42:38] sheep and ass
[42:39] with the edge of the sword but joshua
[42:42] said unto the two men
[42:43] that had spied out the country go into
[42:45] the harlot's house and
[42:46] bring out vince the woman and all that
[42:48] she hath
[42:50] as ye swear unto her
[42:54] so now they're going to bring that
[42:56] they're going to bring the woman out
[42:58] at the time after the seven trumpets
[43:00] after the after the the
[43:02] seven times around after the great blast
[43:05] after the walls came down
[43:06] now the woman is going to be separated
[43:08] out
[43:10] from the systems she's going to be
[43:13] removed and separated out from the
[43:14] system
[43:16] it says it i'm just going to read two
[43:17] scriptures to you might want to jot them
[43:18] down but it says second corinthians 6 17
[43:21] wherefore come out from among them and
[43:23] be ye separate
[43:24] saith the lord and touch not the unclean
[43:26] thing and i
[43:28] will receive you this is the important
[43:31] part
[43:32] come out from among them and be separate
[43:36] and i will receive you
[43:40] revelation 18 4 and i heard another
[43:43] voice from heaven saying come out of her
[43:44] my people
[43:45] that ye be not partakers of your sins
[43:48] and they receive none of her plagues
[43:50] so here rahab after the destruction
[43:53] arihaba is brought
[43:54] out and she's separated out
[43:57] brother benham says in the token 1963
[44:00] and then when god honored it the house
[44:02] never shook down
[44:04] and then when joshua stood there and
[44:05] give the signal to destroy the whole
[44:07] thing went right
[44:08] straight up and rahab and all of her
[44:09] people set right
[44:11] and all their possessions amen amen all
[44:13] their possessions was in the house
[44:14] safely they just stood there and didn't
[44:16] have to look out the window
[44:18] they could read the scripture while the
[44:20] battle was going on
[44:22] there was nothing to be nervous about
[44:24] nothing to be worried about
[44:25] they had she had a true token not a
[44:28] false token
[44:29] a true token and she was confident in
[44:32] the token
[44:32] and she was confident in the promise
[44:36] they didn't have to look out the window
[44:38] they could read the scriptures while the
[44:39] battle was going on
[44:41] she came right back and courted courted
[44:44] the general and army
[44:45] in the army and was raised up and come
[44:47] into bethlehem
[44:49] and her portion was allotted up there to
[44:51] them
[44:52] and she brought forth a famous son and
[44:54] that famous son brought forth another
[44:55] famous son and that son brought forth
[44:57] another famous son
[44:58] until the great famous sun came right
[45:01] back
[45:02] down and on through obed and on through
[45:03] jesse and on through david that's right
[45:05] harlot rahab because she believed the
[45:09] messenger
[45:10] hallelujah we can't put enough stock in
[45:13] that
[45:13] just believing one and what has
[45:16] just believing accomplished in the
[45:19] scriptures
[45:21] amen not the works program amen just
[45:24] believing
[45:26] just believing knock the walls down just
[45:28] believing held her house up safe
[45:30] just believing what the messenger said
[45:33] amen was enough to preserve her in the
[45:35] time of judgment
[45:38] because she believed the messenger she
[45:41] applied the token
[45:42] and her house was saved or she had
[45:44] perished down there
[45:45] where she was at
[45:49] now i want to look at this solomon
[45:53] character for a minute solomon
[45:56] is not just one of any number
[46:00] of people he's a very unique person
[46:04] and numbers 26 moses begins the number
[46:08] or i believe it's joshua begins the
[46:11] number of the people
[46:13] the new generation that's raised up all
[46:15] the old warriors now have died off
[46:17] they're getting ready to cross over and
[46:18] there's another numbering and they
[46:20] number
[46:22] in in numbers 26 51
[46:25] it says these were the number of the
[46:26] children of israel six hundred thousand
[46:30] and a thousand seven hundred and thirty
[46:34] so six hundred and two thousand seven
[46:36] hundred and thirty
[46:37] all fighting age men aged 20 and
[46:40] up that can fight not women and children
[46:44] and not the house of the levites there
[46:46] was another several thousand in the
[46:47] house of the levites wasn't counted in
[46:49] this
[46:50] so these are the men not the women and
[46:52] children
[46:53] the men that can go into battle
[46:56] are six hundred and two thousand seven
[46:58] hundred thirty
[47:01] right and there's one
[47:04] little harlot woman that has believed
[47:08] the message
[47:10] and come out of the denominations
[47:14] and which one of these 600
[47:17] 000 men do you think she's going to
[47:19] happen to run into
[47:23] the only one that counts
[47:26] is the prince of the house of judah he
[47:29] that's in line for the birthright and
[47:31] the house of judah
[47:33] because she is predestinated
[47:37] she is a predestinated vessel to be
[47:40] in the genealogy of jesus christ she's
[47:44] predestinated
[47:45] to come out she's a predestinated womb
[47:48] and that womb will
[47:49] only receive seed from one source
[47:53] this we're talking about was a harlot
[47:57] a harlot amen a harlot
[48:00] with a predestinated womb
[48:06] misusing what god had predestinated amen
[48:10] receiving seed from every denomination
[48:13] every thought
[48:14] everything that's out there but it never
[48:16] took never took never took
[48:17] never took until she comes out and she
[48:20] can't go to
[48:21] any one of these six hundred and two
[48:23] thousand men
[48:24] although they're righteous men amen
[48:26] although they're coming into the promise
[48:28] but there's one that she's predestinated
[48:30] to receive seed from
[48:34] now if you follow the line down through
[48:37] this is the line of the birthright from
[48:39] judah to pharas to ezram
[48:41] to aram to aminadab to nayasan
[48:45] naasan dies in the wilderness
[48:49] right this is solomon's dad he dies in
[48:52] the wilderness amen because all the old
[48:54] fighters die off
[48:55] so here comes solomon solomon
[48:58] is the only one
[49:02] right in this seed line
[49:05] one in a million how many
[49:09] hundreds of thousands do you think were
[49:11] in jericho
[49:13] one woman one man
[49:16] how did they ever get together
[49:19] predestination
[49:22] sometimes when we read the story we read
[49:24] the story but we don't realize the
[49:26] magnitude of what is taking place
[49:30] how is it that solomon stays single this
[49:32] long
[49:34] how is it he's not married how is it
[49:36] there's no there's a predestinated plan
[49:39] taking place
[49:43] amen
[49:46] brother brahm said why it had to be
[49:47] shepherds
[49:50] he said
[49:55] hold on i think i missed the part yeah
[49:59] why i had to be shepherds i'll get to
[50:00] that next but i want to go back and read
[50:02] joshua 6 again hopefully you're still in
[50:04] joshua 6. let's read 23 and then we'll
[50:06] go
[50:07] to the next quote
[50:12] let's go back to 22. but joshua had said
[50:16] unto the two men that had spied out the
[50:17] country go into the harlot's house and
[50:19] bring out vince the woman
[50:21] and all that she hath as you swear unto
[50:23] her
[50:24] and the young men that were spies went
[50:26] in and brought out rahab and her father
[50:28] and her mother and her brethren
[50:29] and all that she had and they brought
[50:31] out all her kindred and left them
[50:33] without the camp of israel
[50:34] and they burned the city with fire and
[50:36] all that was therein only the silver and
[50:38] the gold and the vessels of brass and of
[50:40] iron they put into the treasury
[50:42] of the house of the lord and joshua
[50:44] saved rahab
[50:45] the harlot alive in her father's
[50:48] household and all that she had
[50:50] and she dwelt in israel even into this
[50:52] day because she hid the messengers
[50:54] which joshua sent to spy out jericho
[50:58] i want to look if we can look back
[51:01] and read verse 23 again
[51:05] and the young men that were spies went
[51:07] in and brought out rahab
[51:09] and her father and her mother and her
[51:10] brethren and all that she had
[51:12] they brought out all our kindred and
[51:14] left them
[51:15] without the camp
[51:23] she left them without the camp of israel
[51:26] why they were heathens they couldn't
[51:29] come into the camp
[51:30] i mean they couldn't come into the camp
[51:32] of israel they they were from a heathen
[51:34] nation
[51:35] they were heathen people and besides
[51:37] that she had lived a very ungodly
[51:39] lifestyle she was
[51:40] rahab the harlot a famous harlot and now
[51:43] she's outside the camp
[51:45] brother ben says and why it had to be
[51:48] shepherds
[51:51] no i'm sorry not that one
[51:57] yeah here it is and why little bethlehem
[52:01] and then you see here she was taken in
[52:02] as one of the israelites she fell in
[52:04] love with the man
[52:05] which was a captain and a prince in
[52:07] judah he was the captain of the
[52:08] israelite armies
[52:09] his name was salman just like the king
[52:12] solomon
[52:13] and he was a captain and she became in a
[52:15] great romance with this captain which
[52:16] was prince of judah
[52:18] and finally she married him and when the
[52:20] estate was settled up for the israelites
[52:22] she and her beloved husband lived in
[52:23] bethlehem now you begin to see it
[52:26] open haven't you see begin to open as we
[52:29] see that in bethlehem she lived being a
[52:31] gentile bride to
[52:32] a jew why because she believed in a
[52:34] miracle-working god
[52:35] look where she come from from being out
[52:37] of a house of ill-famed prostitution
[52:40] through her conversion and through her
[52:41] unfailing faith in god it brought her
[52:43] from a prostitute house
[52:44] prostitute house to a beautiful home in
[52:47] bethlehem
[52:48] what a difference that's the way it does
[52:50] all of us from a house of unbelief and
[52:52] flusterations
[52:53] immoral acts and everything to a place
[52:55] position in christ
[52:56] which is most beautiful from the
[52:58] ridiculous to the sublime
[53:00] that's the difference that it makes
[53:01] through our conversion and did you see
[53:03] she married a prince of the house of
[53:05] judah a captain
[53:06] the captain represented christ took to
[53:08] himself a gentile bride
[53:10] from the lowest of the lowest to the
[53:11] principle and best place in the land
[53:14] as we'll get to it later in our message
[53:16] to prove that it was nothing else could
[53:18] be but that
[53:19] they're a type of the gentile bride so
[53:22] now
[53:22] she goes from being moved outside the
[53:25] camp
[53:26] they take her and they put her outside
[53:27] the camp of israel
[53:29] amen and so she has no hope of coming
[53:31] inside the camp
[53:34] but she's predestinated so there's only
[53:36] one way that she can get inside this
[53:39] camp
[53:39] there's only one way for her but there's
[53:42] no
[53:43] hope in her mind because she knows her
[53:45] immorality
[53:46] she knows her sinfulness she knows her
[53:48] condition so in her mind
[53:50] it's a hopeless situation and here she
[53:52] is removed
[53:53] and set outside the camp but here's
[53:55] solomon
[53:56] now solomon has every right to be in the
[53:59] camp
[53:59] solomon is one of the 12 princes and the
[54:02] firstborn lineage of each of the 12
[54:04] tribes
[54:04] of israel and he happens to be carrying
[54:07] amen the natural lineage of christ
[54:11] key fella here not just any of the 600
[54:15] and 2 000
[54:16] this is the only one amen that is
[54:20] that is he's the predestinated one in
[54:22] the birthright of judah amen and he's
[54:24] got to find
[54:25] a predestinated womb to bring forth amen
[54:28] the lineage of christ
[54:29] and so god has to move all the
[54:31] circumstances so no doubt
[54:33] amen that he's taken notice of the girls
[54:36] in israel amen
[54:37] a lot of fine girls a lot of godly girls
[54:39] living right
[54:40] doing right dressing right doing
[54:42] everything right but
[54:43] none of them fit the bill because
[54:46] god is laying down a pattern showing his
[54:49] gentile bride
[54:50] so solomon in order to find his bride
[54:54] he must himself go outside the camp
[54:59] he's got to go outside the denominations
[55:02] outside the camp of religion
[55:04] he himself moves outside the camp when
[55:07] he comes outside the camp
[55:08] he's found the one who's come out from
[55:10] among her
[55:12] he's found the one who's been delivered
[55:14] from denominations he's found the one
[55:16] that's separated out
[55:17] not touching the unclean things and he
[55:19] said if you'll if you'll come
[55:20] out from her amen and not cut and be
[55:22] separate and not touch of the unclean
[55:24] things
[55:24] i will receive you receive you where
[55:29] not in the camp out of the camp
[55:32] i won't receive you in there i won't
[55:34] receive you in the denominations i won't
[55:36] receive you in the systems
[55:37] but if you come out from among her and
[55:40] be you separate
[55:41] i will receive you and now rahab has
[55:44] come out
[55:45] and she is separated and she's outside
[55:48] the camp
[55:48] in psalm and now what moved him to
[55:51] stroll outside the camp
[55:54] what power was upon his life what was he
[55:57] thinking
[55:57] he may not have been thinking he may
[55:59] have lost a goat he may be chasing down
[56:01] who
[56:02] knows how god worked it out but all of a
[56:04] sudden he goes
[56:05] outside the camp because what he's
[56:07] looking for
[56:08] cannot be found back in the system
[56:16] let's go out out of the camp to be
[56:20] joined to him
[56:22] so now these two meet
[56:25] outside the camp
[56:28] do you see yourself do you see the
[56:31] redemption story
[56:33] you see the bride of jesus christ the
[56:36] predestinated seed separated out
[56:40] the one who's ordained to redeem her
[56:45] now the question is how is she going to
[56:48] be redeemed
[56:52] by receiving seed
[56:57] now solomon is going to go outside the
[57:01] camp
[57:02] just like the the the owner of the armor
[57:04] the armor company's son goes down and he
[57:06] sees all of these
[57:08] beautiful girls and they're they're
[57:09] putting on the ritz for him but he goes
[57:11] out and finds outside the camp
[57:14] outside the party he finds a little
[57:17] washer woman
[57:19] and he finds in her character character
[57:22] that he can marry
[57:23] character that he's been looking for
[57:25] what was it solomon found in rahab
[57:28] rahab amen not an israelite princess
[57:31] amen not growing up hearing the stories
[57:34] not growing up
[57:35] always you know in the presence of moses
[57:37] and seeing joshua no
[57:39] this is a woman who grew up outside of
[57:41] all of that was
[57:42] her life was horrible in a horrible
[57:44] condition full of adultery but the first
[57:47] time she heard the message she believed
[57:49] it
[57:50] what was solomon looking for he was
[57:52] looking for the character
[57:54] that is expressed by faith faith in the
[57:56] message of the
[57:57] hour that was
[58:00] attracted to psalm and solomon finally
[58:03] found what he was looking for
[58:04] couldn't find it anywhere else couldn't
[58:07] find it back in israel but here
[58:09] is the woman amen and instantly when
[58:11] that light struck when that light
[58:13] flashed across that seed comes alive
[58:16] here's the woman with character
[58:20] and he says will you marry me
[58:24] can you imagine being rahab
[58:30] you probably can it was probably like
[58:34] when you first realize christ wanted to
[58:36] marry you
[58:39] and you're saying really
[58:42] like the preaching is striking your
[58:44] heart you know it's god calling you
[58:47] but you're like really i mean really
[58:49] could it be me
[58:51] i mean do you know what i did in jericho
[58:56] do you know what my name was my title
[58:58] you know what the nomination i come
[58:59] through
[59:00] do you know what i've believed you know
[59:03] what i've done
[59:05] solomon didn't care what she had
[59:07] believed solomon didn't care what she
[59:09] had done
[59:10] because all that mattered is she is
[59:13] separated from that
[59:15] and he can receive her
[59:18] and now the woman that's separated from
[59:20] the camp outside the camp
[59:22] when solomon comes outside the camp and
[59:25] finds a believer
[59:26] he marries her now
[59:29] is she outside the camp anymore he
[59:32] brings her
[59:33] right into the household of faith and
[59:36] dare anybody
[59:39] condemn rahab i dare
[59:42] anybody to mock rahab to condemn rehab
[59:46] to say she has no rights what gives her
[59:48] the right the right is that she is
[59:50] receiving seed and that seed takes
[59:52] conception within her
[59:54] and she brings forth the lineage of
[59:56] christ
[59:58] she's right there in matthew chapter one
[1:00:00] amen you go and read it
[1:00:01] and there's rahab and what's rahab
[1:00:04] bringing forth
[1:00:05] rahab's bringing forth not just another
[1:00:06] name judge is another name in the list
[1:00:08] but boaz the kinsman redeemer
[1:00:14] how dare anybody speak evil of rahab
[1:00:18] from that day on
[1:00:21] call her a harlot no sir her sins have
[1:00:24] been washed away
[1:00:27] her past life has been forgotten
[1:00:30] she is now a princess
[1:00:33] in judah who did she marry
[1:00:37] a footwash funky foot soldier water boy
[1:00:43] she married the highest ranking prince
[1:00:48] in judah
[1:00:51] the king tribe
[1:00:54] instantly her identity changed
[1:00:58] from rahab to harlot to princess
[1:01:03] mr and mrs salman
[1:01:09] now when she goes to the well she
[1:01:11] doesn't have to go outside to camp
[1:01:12] anymore
[1:01:13] she doesn't have to hide or come in odd
[1:01:15] hours now she walks right out there
[1:01:17] and if she's dipping in the well they
[1:01:18] can say oh i haven't met you
[1:01:20] who are you she doesn't say rahab i'm
[1:01:23] rehab
[1:01:24] no she says i'm mrs solman
[1:01:29] oh oh oh can i help you carry your water
[1:01:32] pot
[1:01:34] her identity completely changed in a
[1:01:38] moment
[1:01:39] it didn't take amen it didn't take years
[1:01:42] of being married before
[1:01:43] she could take his name amen before her
[1:01:45] identity would change
[1:01:47] it happened in a moment when he took her
[1:01:49] and said you're mine
[1:01:50] and she accepted what he has given to
[1:01:52] her amen instantly
[1:01:53] in the ceremony he took her unto himself
[1:01:56] and her
[1:01:57] total identity changed from that point
[1:01:59] on from the lowest of the low to the
[1:02:01] highest of the high
[1:02:04] it's hard to go any higher than where
[1:02:06] rahab went
[1:02:07] and it's hard to be any lower than where
[1:02:09] she was
[1:02:12] my goodness that should make us dance a
[1:02:15] little jig
[1:02:16] say it doesn't matter what i was it
[1:02:18] doesn't matter what i've done it doesn't
[1:02:19] matter where i've been
[1:02:20] it doesn't matter what label i've worn
[1:02:22] before i'm only wearing one label now
[1:02:24] and if you want to know who i am i am
[1:02:26] mrs jesus christ
[1:02:28] my identity has changed i have
[1:02:29] confidence in who i am amen there may
[1:02:31] have been a time
[1:02:32] i wasn't so sure that name would work
[1:02:34] there may have been a time i didn't know
[1:02:35] amen i didn't really know i'm just
[1:02:37] feeling it now but we've walked along
[1:02:39] far enough to know that this
[1:02:40] is a true identity amen it come through
[1:02:43] a true token
[1:02:44] and a true union amen with a true the
[1:02:47] true seed
[1:02:49] the true prince of the house of judah
[1:02:52] the true king
[1:02:54] making me the true bride
[1:02:57] and now i have a right to give my true
[1:03:00] identity
[1:03:02] i don't have to call myself what others
[1:03:04] called me
[1:03:09] i don't have to identify my former life
[1:03:14] i don't have to explain myself to
[1:03:16] anybody
[1:03:21] because solomon didn't care
[1:03:24] christ didn't care why should anybody
[1:03:27] else care
[1:03:31] praise god
[1:03:36] see brother brennan begins to say
[1:03:39] i just want to wrap up by sharing this
[1:03:42] last few thoughts
[1:03:44] he says in the message why i had to be
[1:03:45] shepherds
[1:03:48] he was talking about solomon
[1:03:51] is the one who founded bethlehem
[1:03:57] solomon founded bethlehem and who was
[1:04:00] there with him when he got his
[1:04:02] inheritance and found at bethlehem
[1:04:04] rehab rahab
[1:04:08] is taking possession of the land
[1:04:12] with her husband
[1:04:15] amen she's now in the marriage union
[1:04:18] she's now walking with her husband and
[1:04:21] when her husband
[1:04:22] gets an inheritance guess what she gets
[1:04:25] an inheritance
[1:04:27] when her husband gets bethlehem guess
[1:04:29] what she gets
[1:04:30] bethlehem this is why christ had to be
[1:04:34] born in bethlehem because solomon was
[1:04:36] given bethlehem
[1:04:37] and solomon and rahab took bethlehem and
[1:04:40] they brought forth boaz
[1:04:41] in bethlehem and they brought forth obed
[1:04:43] and bethlehem they brought forth jesse
[1:04:45] and bethlehem they brought forth david
[1:04:47] in bethlehem christ had to be born in
[1:04:50] bethlehem
[1:04:51] why because of rahab the harlot and
[1:04:54] salman
[1:04:57] she found her position
[1:05:00] and her position produced the kinsmen
[1:05:03] redeemer
[1:05:04] her position produced the kingly race
[1:05:06] her position produced
[1:05:08] the right offspring out of position
[1:05:13] nothing was happening seats coming
[1:05:15] nothing seats coming nothing seats
[1:05:16] coming
[1:05:17] when she gets into the right position
[1:05:19] seat comes conception right baby's born
[1:05:24] so why no matter how much we wanted to
[1:05:26] live a good christian life in whatever
[1:05:27] system we were in we were incapable of
[1:05:29] overcoming
[1:05:31] but when we come into the right position
[1:05:33] amen all of a sudden we receive the
[1:05:35] right seed and it brings forth the right
[1:05:37] life
[1:05:41] praise gone
[1:05:47] brother bill says
[1:05:53] he goes the bethlehem the house of god's
[1:05:55] bread
[1:05:56] we proved it in scriptures he could not
[1:05:58] come any other place bethlehem was
[1:06:00] founded by rahab and her husband
[1:06:02] in case you doubt it brother man said
[1:06:05] bethlehem was founded what was bethlehem
[1:06:08] the house of god's
[1:06:10] bread hallelujah
[1:06:14] where was that coming from rahab
[1:06:18] rave and her husband rahab was a harlot
[1:06:22] that a general courted in the israelite
[1:06:24] army after that after they had taken
[1:06:26] jericho and by face she believed the
[1:06:27] message of god in her condition and she
[1:06:29] was saved
[1:06:30] and from there when joshua divided up
[1:06:32] the lands and where each one would be
[1:06:34] and there's a great lesson that
[1:06:36] sometimes i hope to be able to bring at
[1:06:38] tucson
[1:06:39] of those hebrew mothers giving birth to
[1:06:40] those babies when she groaned at the
[1:06:42] birth pain of the baby she called the
[1:06:44] name of the baby
[1:06:45] and that positionally placed it in the
[1:06:47] promised land
[1:06:49] its tribe so now she's got to get into
[1:06:52] position when she gets into position
[1:06:54] now each one of these hebrew mothers in
[1:06:56] the in the exodus journey
[1:06:58] when they were bearing down in labor
[1:07:00] they would call forth a name and that
[1:07:01] name would position them in the land
[1:07:03] and brother branham said they were
[1:07:04] calling their tribal name they're called
[1:07:07] reuben
[1:07:07] and gad and then joshua comes along and
[1:07:10] joshua places reuben and gad and naftali
[1:07:12] and issachar and
[1:07:14] and dan and all of these he begins to
[1:07:16] place them amen but
[1:07:17] in their birth when they're birthed
[1:07:20] they're positionally placed
[1:07:23] because of the name spoken over them
[1:07:25] when they're birthed they're
[1:07:26] positionally placed that's why it's so
[1:07:28] important that
[1:07:29] all you do amen both in word indeed you
[1:07:31] do all in the name of jesus christ
[1:07:34] because how you bring somebody in and
[1:07:35] birth them into the church amen is their
[1:07:37] identification
[1:07:38] and if you birth them under
[1:07:39] trinitarianism and trinitarian
[1:07:42] baptism they'll never find the right
[1:07:44] position in the land
[1:07:45] but they've got to be birthed and
[1:07:46] brought in amen under the name of the
[1:07:48] lord jesus christ
[1:07:51] restoring water baptism wasn't just a
[1:07:53] trivial thing it brought an
[1:07:54] identification
[1:07:59] so now it's important it's important
[1:08:04] what how a baby's birthed
[1:08:08] and under what word they're birthed
[1:08:10] under
[1:08:12] because when the mother's bringing forth
[1:08:14] the word that she's speaking as she's
[1:08:16] travailing and bringing forth
[1:08:17] a new believer a new israelite
[1:08:21] what she's speaking is positionally
[1:08:23] placing them in the word
[1:08:27] so my brother venom comes to the first
[1:08:29] seal
[1:08:30] he says it only is to be revealed at the
[1:08:33] last day
[1:08:36] when this actual seal is broken i'm
[1:08:39] going to back up
[1:08:40] one paragraph and read now watch he said
[1:08:42] it would be known in the last day
[1:08:44] but it comes forth in a church symbol
[1:08:46] he's talking about the seals it comes
[1:08:47] forth in a church symbol do you
[1:08:48] understand church
[1:08:49] it comes forth in a symbol of a church
[1:08:51] that they knew there is a seal
[1:08:53] but just what it is yet they don't know
[1:08:55] because it's a white horse rider
[1:08:57] white horse rider red horse rider black
[1:08:59] horse rider but listen what he says next
[1:09:01] and it only is to be revealed at the
[1:09:03] last day when the actual seal is broken
[1:09:07] so there's an actual breaking of the
[1:09:09] seals
[1:09:11] when is the actual breaking of the seals
[1:09:14] not after the rapture but the actual
[1:09:17] breaking of the seals
[1:09:19] took place in 1963
[1:09:23] at the actual seal is broken broken to
[1:09:25] who not to christ
[1:09:27] but to the church notice oh my that just
[1:09:30] makes me tremble
[1:09:31] i hope the church truly understands it
[1:09:33] you people i'm going to call you bride
[1:09:37] that you'll understand it so why does
[1:09:40] brother branham take the time
[1:09:42] to stop and say now there's going to be
[1:09:45] there's a transition taking place
[1:09:47] amen now we're coming to a new place a
[1:09:50] new position
[1:09:51] not a church age position but now we're
[1:09:53] coming to the breaking of the seals when
[1:09:55] they actually break
[1:09:57] and we reveal what the symbol of white
[1:09:59] horse says red horse says
[1:10:01] black horse says all of these things now
[1:10:03] we're coming to an
[1:10:04] actual position in order for you to get
[1:10:06] into position
[1:10:08] i'm going to have to call you by another
[1:10:10] name
[1:10:11] [Music]
[1:10:12] i'm not going to call you church but i
[1:10:14] will call you bride
[1:10:16] because the actual breaking of the seal
[1:10:18] is the bride's position
[1:10:20] because it's coming back into the
[1:10:22] fullness of the land
[1:10:23] not a partial journey not one time
[1:10:26] around but all
[1:10:26] seven times around
[1:10:31] that's what brother branham said in in
[1:10:33] 1964 the feast of trumpets
[1:10:35] now if i come with if i come with the
[1:10:38] message of pentecost
[1:10:39] i would be in the laodicean church age
[1:10:42] and it wouldn't be right
[1:10:46] i'm going to read that again now if i
[1:10:49] come with the message of pentecost
[1:10:51] i would be in the laodicean church age
[1:10:53] and it wouldn't be
[1:10:55] right but i'm saying that message
[1:10:58] if i come preaching a pentecostal
[1:11:00] message i would be in the later scene
[1:11:01] church age because the pentecostal age
[1:11:03] is the laodicean church
[1:11:04] and if i come preaching a pentecostal
[1:11:06] message i'd be in the later sea in
[1:11:07] church age
[1:11:08] and that wouldn't be right
[1:11:12] because what's right he come to bring us
[1:11:15] out of that
[1:11:16] into the bride age and that's why he had
[1:11:18] to call her bride
[1:11:19] because now there's a new position the
[1:11:21] new position isn't luther
[1:11:23] it's not wesley it's not justification
[1:11:25] it's not sanctification
[1:11:27] it's not baptism or holy ghost but now
[1:11:29] we've come to a new position
[1:11:31] and i'm going to speak in the first seal
[1:11:34] a new name
[1:11:35] as i'm laboring to bring forth and that
[1:11:38] new name i'm going to call you
[1:11:40] bride so i can position you in the
[1:11:42] bride's portion of the land
[1:11:47] amen that's why it's important it's
[1:11:49] important what you're birthed under
[1:11:52] the word that's spoken amen as the woman
[1:11:56] the church the bride
[1:11:58] is bringing forth more the word that is
[1:12:00] spoken is going to position
[1:12:02] us in the land
[1:12:08] praise god
[1:12:14] so now we can't identify
[1:12:19] with reuben's portion luther's portion
[1:12:24] any portion that belonged to the church
[1:12:26] before
[1:12:28] because the prophet said i'm going to
[1:12:29] call you bride that you'll understand
[1:12:33] that you can be positioned in your land
[1:12:38] what is our land the capstone
[1:12:41] the fullness of the word the entire
[1:12:43] bible
[1:12:44] opened up the revelation of the seals
[1:12:47] it's not anymore not anymore
[1:12:51] a church ages message
[1:12:54] if i preached that it wouldn't be right
[1:12:58] but now we come not with the pentecostal
[1:13:01] message
[1:13:02] but we come with the bride's message
[1:13:06] and when the bride is bringing forth
[1:13:08] more bride
[1:13:09] it matters what's being spoken during
[1:13:11] the labor pains
[1:13:12] because what's being spoken is
[1:13:14] positioning
[1:13:15] the seed in the land
[1:13:19] hallelujah amen
[1:13:24] praise god in the invisible union
[1:13:28] of the bride of christ
[1:13:31] said now your old book is gone with your
[1:13:33] old union
[1:13:36] you think rahab likes this portion of
[1:13:37] the message
[1:13:40] your old book is gone with your old
[1:13:41] union your name and your old
[1:13:43] has been transferred now you say do you
[1:13:45] mean to tell me that my old book
[1:13:47] god put it in the sea of his forgiveness
[1:13:50] you stand
[1:13:51] perfectly before god
[1:13:54] how do you think rahab stood before the
[1:13:56] rest of israel
[1:13:58] perfectly not because of her deeds
[1:14:01] but because of her husband it was her
[1:14:04] union with the right person
[1:14:06] that got her the respect it got her the
[1:14:09] position that she needed to be in
[1:14:12] you stand perfectly before god now your
[1:14:15] name is now in the new book not the book
[1:14:16] of life but the lamb's book of life
[1:14:18] what the lamb redeemed not the old book
[1:14:20] of your natural union
[1:14:22] but your new bride hallelujah your new
[1:14:24] life is in the lamb's book of life
[1:14:26] your marriage certificate
[1:14:32] i've done a lot of marriage not a lot
[1:14:34] i've done a few marriages
[1:14:36] and there's two names that matter most
[1:14:38] on a marriage certificate
[1:14:40] the bridegroom and the bride
[1:14:44] and your name is on the marriage
[1:14:46] certificate because your name is in the
[1:14:48] lamb's book of life
[1:14:51] hallelujah how would you like for your
[1:14:54] husband the day you get married
[1:14:57] to come to you and whip out a document
[1:15:01] and the date on it stamped and certified
[1:15:04] is 20 years
[1:15:05] earlier and it's got your name on the
[1:15:08] marriage certificate next to his
[1:15:11] i bet that'd be a shocking day how did
[1:15:13] you know how did you do that
[1:15:15] how how did you put that on that's
[1:15:17] exactly what god has done
[1:15:20] god knew who he was going to marry
[1:15:21] before we ever got here he knew what
[1:15:23] position would be and he knew what age
[1:15:24] we'd come forth
[1:15:25] he knew when the union was going to take
[1:15:27] place amen and he already recorded that
[1:15:29] name
[1:15:30] rahab's name was already on that book
[1:15:33] amen when she was in jericho living a
[1:15:35] harlot life her name's on the marriage
[1:15:37] certificate
[1:15:38] next to jesus christ
[1:15:41] amen when she's believing the report
[1:15:43] it's because her name's written there
[1:15:44] amen
[1:15:45] when she's when she's coming to life and
[1:15:47] receiving a true token because her
[1:15:48] name's being there
[1:15:49] when she's brought out and separated out
[1:15:50] of the camp it's because her name is on
[1:15:52] the marriage certificate
[1:15:53] when solomon can't find a suitable mate
[1:15:56] in all of israel
[1:15:57] it's because his name is next to hers on
[1:15:59] the marriage certificate
[1:16:00] that's why christ couldn't marry a
[1:16:02] church a.j man he had to wait until he
[1:16:04] had a bride he meant that he had
[1:16:06] a bride that he could marry
[1:16:10] we know there's bride all through the
[1:16:11] church ages they'll come up at the end
[1:16:13] but now in the invisible union he's
[1:16:15] waiting for one that's separated out
[1:16:17] and outside the camp
[1:16:20] amen what's moving solomon
[1:16:25] to go outside the camp his name on the
[1:16:28] marriage certificate
[1:16:31] what's moving rahab to stay outside the
[1:16:33] camp her name on the marriage
[1:16:34] certificate
[1:16:36] what is it that makes his heart skip a
[1:16:38] beat when he said he saw lots of women
[1:16:41] before
[1:16:43] you know her story would have been
[1:16:45] famous through all of israel
[1:16:48] the two spies they were received and
[1:16:51] they were spared and they were sent out
[1:16:54] you know that news would travel like
[1:16:56] wildfire
[1:16:57] when you look around jericho and the
[1:17:01] entire
[1:17:02] city is laid flat except one little
[1:17:04] house on the wall standing right here by
[1:17:06] itself
[1:17:07] you think that would have started a
[1:17:09] conversation
[1:17:10] [Music]
[1:17:11] you think they wouldn't all know who
[1:17:13] lived in that house and why it was
[1:17:15] standing and what her reputation was and
[1:17:17] what she
[1:17:18] everybody knew her story
[1:17:23] solomon wasn't looking for a
[1:17:25] relationship with a harlot
[1:17:30] he was looking for the one that had her
[1:17:32] name on the marriage certificate with
[1:17:33] him
[1:17:35] amen hallelujah
[1:17:42] it says now your new life is the lamb's
[1:17:45] book of life your marriage certificate
[1:17:47] hallelujah where your true eternal germ
[1:17:50] from the beginning takes hold
[1:17:53] now you're not only forgiven but you're
[1:17:56] justified amen
[1:17:59] by what by believing
[1:18:04] you're just but you're justified glory
[1:18:07] justified romans 5 1 said yeah
[1:18:08] romans 5 1 said they're being justified
[1:18:11] by faith
[1:18:12] look up the word the word don't mean
[1:18:14] forgiven the word means justified
[1:18:16] it don't mean you're forgiven
[1:18:19] you say i've been forgiven in my sense
[1:18:21] that's true
[1:18:23] but now i can go a step further because
[1:18:26] i've been in the invisible union
[1:18:28] received the seal of my faith the
[1:18:29] baptism of the holy ghost been washed by
[1:18:31] the water of the word and cleansed from
[1:18:33] all unrighteousness
[1:18:34] and now i cannot just say i'm forgiven
[1:18:37] of my sins
[1:18:37] that was an old statement that i made
[1:18:39] when i was coming in but now i can say
[1:18:42] what sins yes
[1:18:45] are you forgiven of your sins what sins
[1:18:48] [Applause]
[1:18:50] if you think i'm if you think i'm off my
[1:18:52] head just listen a little bit further as
[1:18:54] we read on down
[1:18:56] amy said the word don't mean forgiven
[1:18:58] the word means justified it don't mean
[1:19:00] you're forgiven
[1:19:01] for instance you heard i got drunk and
[1:19:02] done some evil things and everything
[1:19:04] then you come around and say to me you
[1:19:06] found out i didn't do them
[1:19:07] then you come around and said brother
[1:19:08] branham i forgive you forgive me i
[1:19:10] didn't do it at the first place see
[1:19:13] now if i did it i'm guilty but you could
[1:19:15] forgive me and i wouldn't be guilty
[1:19:17] but yet i'm not justified because i
[1:19:20] actually done it
[1:19:23] but the word justified is though you
[1:19:25] never
[1:19:26] did it amen it's not even regarded at
[1:19:29] all
[1:19:31] now he asks a good question how is it
[1:19:33] done how's that done
[1:19:35] in god's book of the sea of
[1:19:37] forgetfulness your old book in marriage
[1:19:39] is divorced
[1:19:39] and dead it's not even the memories of
[1:19:43] god
[1:19:43] amen so why would you get back on your
[1:19:47] knees and say god i'm sorry for that
[1:19:49] thing i did 20 years ago
[1:19:51] it's not even in his memory it's not
[1:19:54] just forgiven
[1:19:56] it's justified just as if it never
[1:20:00] happened so if the devil reminds you of
[1:20:02] it say forget it amen i'm
[1:20:04] not bringing that back to god i've
[1:20:05] already repented amen i've already been
[1:20:07] forgiven and now
[1:20:09] i am justified
[1:20:13] how is it done and god's book of the sea
[1:20:15] of forgiveness your old book in marriage
[1:20:17] is divorced and dead it's not even in
[1:20:19] the memories of god you are justified
[1:20:21] therefore being justified
[1:20:23] it was accused you was accused you never
[1:20:26] did it in the first place
[1:20:28] the old union is in the sea of god's
[1:20:30] forgetfulness you wasn't married to it
[1:20:32] to begin with
[1:20:34] he the bridegroom bore your shame
[1:20:35] himself for you in your place
[1:20:37] he took your place for you were
[1:20:39] predestinated for him
[1:20:41] to be in his bride and before the
[1:20:42] foundation of the world the bible said
[1:20:44] so
[1:20:45] and you are a predestinated seed how did
[1:20:48] you come to do this
[1:20:51] you were deceived into it by your first
[1:20:53] marriage to your adulterous parent eve
[1:20:56] it's no fault of your own
[1:21:01] now we're talking about the difference
[1:21:02] between the natural man
[1:21:04] and the spirit man be in the inner man
[1:21:08] and the outer man
[1:21:09] there's a big difference this outer man
[1:21:11] did all kinds of stuff
[1:21:13] amen and it did it because it was moved
[1:21:15] by the wrong nature i mean it came with
[1:21:16] a sin
[1:21:17] nature but at one point in my life amen
[1:21:20] that sin nature was burnt out by the
[1:21:22] holy fire of god
[1:21:23] and god quickened to life a seed that
[1:21:25] was laying there in my soul
[1:21:27] dormant and been bursted into action
[1:21:30] and that is the life that i now live
[1:21:35] that's the real me from before the
[1:21:37] foundation of the world
[1:21:38] this is my true identity
[1:21:42] and that guy that i don't say it like
[1:21:45] that
[1:21:45] not that guy that expressed attribute of
[1:21:48] god
[1:21:50] never sinned in the beginning never was
[1:21:53] an unbelief
[1:21:54] never was in deception never disbelieved
[1:21:57] god at any time
[1:21:59] it was only a human mind a human spirit
[1:22:02] in a human body that was fallen but that
[1:22:04] has been cut off and divorced amen
[1:22:06] amen and the real you has sprung to life
[1:22:09] the eternal predestinated seed of god
[1:22:11] an expressed attribute of god
[1:22:16] you were deceived into it it's no fault
[1:22:17] of your own by your natural birth you
[1:22:19] come
[1:22:20] after eve who committed adultery that's
[1:22:22] the reason you was born
[1:22:23] unadulterous you're a sinner to begin
[1:22:26] with that's right
[1:22:27] you was deceived into it no it ain't
[1:22:30] your fault
[1:22:32] you never did it because that little
[1:22:35] germ that was in you was to be you
[1:22:37] before the foundation
[1:22:38] of the world god put your name in the
[1:22:40] lamb's book of life
[1:22:45] rahab was in that book
[1:22:50] did rahab really commit adultery
[1:22:57] depends on which rahab you're talking
[1:22:58] about
[1:23:01] brother branham said down inside me was
[1:23:03] another william branham
[1:23:07] it depends on which rehab you're talking
[1:23:09] about
[1:23:11] the one in the lamb's book of life or
[1:23:14] the one in the record of natural life
[1:23:15] just come up from natural parents
[1:23:18] which one are you talking about
[1:23:22] did ray have committed mount daltry well
[1:23:26] in one sense she did in another sense
[1:23:29] she never did it in the first place
[1:23:35] and now as her and solomon move into
[1:23:37] bethlehem
[1:23:39] they set up house and they brother man
[1:23:41] said they built a beautiful home
[1:23:44] they have wealth and they have land and
[1:23:46] they have boaz
[1:23:49] it's a totally new life old things are
[1:23:53] passed away
[1:23:54] she doesn't need to live the old kind of
[1:23:56] life in the old kind of condition
[1:23:58] now she comes to a brand new life
[1:24:02] a brand new condition
[1:24:06] why because of who she married
[1:24:11] say thank you god i don't have to rely
[1:24:15] on my old identity
[1:24:18] but through a union now my name is
[1:24:20] changed
[1:24:22] i've taken his name
[1:24:25] romans 5 1 says therefore being
[1:24:27] justified by
[1:24:29] faith we have peace with god through our
[1:24:33] lord jesus christ
[1:24:35] by whom also we have access by faith
[1:24:37] into his grace wherein we stand
[1:24:39] and receive and rejoice in the hope
[1:24:43] of the glory of god i thank god
[1:24:48] spiritually we may have lived like rahab
[1:24:52] we may have been in all kinds of
[1:24:54] horrible situations
[1:24:55] spiritually speaking maybe even morally
[1:24:57] speaking or naturally speaking
[1:25:00] but something's changed
[1:25:05] now you say remember all those things
[1:25:07] you did
[1:25:09] well yeah in the human mind i remember
[1:25:12] them but god doesn't remember them
[1:25:15] they're not in the mind of christ so
[1:25:17] they're not worth talking about anymore
[1:25:21] i've received my true identity the
[1:25:23] identity of the true me that was written
[1:25:25] in the lamb's book of life and before
[1:25:27] the foundation of the world
[1:25:29] the old record of the old union is dead
[1:25:31] divorced
[1:25:32] and dead and i've realized my name is
[1:25:34] written on a marriage certificate from
[1:25:36] before the foundation of the world
[1:25:38] and now i have a right to his name i
[1:25:41] have a right to this new identity
[1:25:44] and i say thank you god we can come into
[1:25:48] bethlehem
[1:25:49] the house of god's bread praise god
[1:25:52] let's all stand
[1:25:54] musicians if you'd like to come
[1:26:01] i don't know about you but i've enjoyed
[1:26:03] rahab
[1:26:06] i never dreamed
[1:26:09] that so much was laying there
[1:26:12] and the sad part is as we move on we
[1:26:14] know we're leaving things behind
[1:26:16] but you just have to wait for revelation
[1:26:18] you can't manufacture those things
[1:26:21] so we just keep praying you know
[1:26:25] this is exciting time to be alive
[1:26:29] we've been birthed out not under a
[1:26:31] pentecostal message
[1:26:34] we've been birthed out under the message
[1:26:36] of the hour
[1:26:38] and it's birthed us into christ the word
[1:26:42] and now i don't have to wander around in
[1:26:44] darkness i don't have to move from one
[1:26:45] walled city to the next walled city but
[1:26:47] i've come out of that and separated
[1:26:50] and if i separate and touch not the
[1:26:52] unclean thing
[1:26:53] he will receive me and solomon's outside
[1:26:57] the camp
[1:26:58] and rahab's outside the camp and there's
[1:27:00] a union that takes place
[1:27:03] i say thank god thank god that he
[1:27:05] predestinated
[1:27:08] the lineage of christ because if he
[1:27:10] didn't predestinate it
[1:27:11] it'd be a totally different picture
[1:27:15] and i thank god he predestinated me
[1:27:18] to be in that line if it wasn't for his
[1:27:21] predestination it'd be a totally
[1:27:22] different story
[1:27:24] not by any works or any merit of our own
[1:27:26] but simply by predestination
[1:27:29] are we here let's bow our heads and pray
[1:27:33] dear lord jesus we thank you father god
[1:27:37] lord what tremendous things lord that
[1:27:39] you have shown through the story of
[1:27:40] rahab
[1:27:42] and god it's amazing lord what you have
[1:27:45] laid in your word
[1:27:47] and allowed to lay there hidden in plain
[1:27:50] sight for all these thousands of years
[1:27:53] but now lord at the opening of the
[1:27:55] entire word
[1:27:57] you're showing us more and more and more
[1:28:00] about yourself and about ourselves and
[1:28:02] about this story
[1:28:04] about this great love story i pray god
[1:28:08] that you would just
[1:28:10] lord lift us on a higher plane with
[1:28:12] clearer vision that we might
[1:28:14] see in reality all of these things that
[1:28:17] we've discussed
[1:28:19] lord that it might be more than a story
[1:28:21] and more than a sermon but it would be
[1:28:23] our very
[1:28:23] life lord it becomes such a revelation
[1:28:27] to us
[1:28:28] that it would change the way we behave
[1:28:30] it would change the way we look at the
[1:28:32] world around us it would change
[1:28:34] everything about us because it's a
[1:28:36] reality it's
[1:28:37] true and it's true in us lord
[1:28:41] god change us mold us make us into your
