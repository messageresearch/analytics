TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i love the humanity i love how brother brandon was a real person elijah was a man of like passions that we he felt what you feel amen you can you imagine fear you can imagine feeling what he would feel in that situation because he's describing feelings that you and i have amen what was he wanting to do get away from the pressure he was wanting to get away from the rejection how many people want to just get away from rejection and get away from pressure and disappear amen when one of your favorite scriptures become oh if i could take wings as a dove and fly him to the cleft of the rock amen we all feel that way sometimes amen but he didn't have that privilege he had a commission there was a purpose in his life and there's a purpose in our life god has not called us to go live in a commune somewhere and find you know a couple thousand acres and build our own commune but he's called us to be here to shine light in the darkest age and the darkness of time in the face of rejection and misunderstandings and hardships and everything else god is correcting us and we you know what we we are or we are called to hold a high standard because god gave us that standard in his word we are called to live for him and for him only and he gives us no wiggle room you step out of line and the rod of chastisement come down quickly and you wonder how come other people can and they seem to be fine but god won't let me get away with anything i'll tell you why because your life is too important your purpose is too critical you're here at the end time to be the end time bride the very manifestation of christ in the flesh of his body his bride and god will if you're part of that he won't let you get away with anything and that is the most wonderful thing that a christian can ever hear [Music] i just wanted this and i just want a little rest and i just wanna and he won't let you get away with anything because your commission is too important your purpose is too important do god allow us to play around
