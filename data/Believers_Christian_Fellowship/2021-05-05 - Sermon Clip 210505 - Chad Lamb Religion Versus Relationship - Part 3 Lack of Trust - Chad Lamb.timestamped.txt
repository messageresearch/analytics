[1:41] circling all around you you know what
[1:44] those spirits want to do
[1:45] they want you to be satisfied believing
[1:48] in malachi 4 that god sent a prophet
[1:50] dressing holy and going to church and
[1:52] paying tithes and settle down and make
[1:54] that
[1:54] your tower of protection against the
[1:56] judgment
[1:58] all of those demons want to take the
[2:00] message and make it a religion
[2:04] and they want you to accept the religion
[2:06] or the message but the message is not a
[2:09] religion the message is not doctors the
[2:10] messages and the teaching
[2:12] the message is the bridegroom amen and
[2:14] he's here today to unite with the bride
[2:16] and he's dwelling in his bride
[2:18] protecting her from those demons
[2:20] it's the mind of christ it's the
[2:22] revealing of the word of god
[2:24] it's not you it's not me it's him
