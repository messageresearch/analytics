TRANSCRIPT
========================================
brother B said in God's provided place of worship he said the church will come through justification through Luther through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the Pentecostals and go right on into the Perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the same self persons God will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will both be the same they are one now you see where we're at how is that going to happen by embracing the person of Truth by receiving the person of Truth and letting the spirit of Truth come and take up residence in me and begin to live out to truth you know what sometimes we don't maybe quite understand what brother brenon meant by this or what that scripture means but if the spirit of Truth lives in us we will still act out the truth am we will still project truth I may not comprehend how this and this add together and I may not be able to intellectualize it but if the life of that word that I can't intellectualize in me I will still be living the life of the word I'll still be projecting the very life and nature of Jesus Christ even if my comprehension hasn't come to the place yet where I say oh click that's it amen but I'll still be projecting the the very nature of Jesus Christ and along the way the spirit of truth will guide me into all truth and as we're moving down living the life of Jesus Christ one day click oh that's it I got it now what's more important brother B says you have long hair have a long dress down to your ankles and have tempered enough to fight a buz saw that's not truth the dress is Right The Temper is wrong see what I'm saying am this message is Christ am turn it to the right this is the Vindication that this message is right what made it the Vindication that this message is right because it was Christ that's what made it truth is that Christ identified himself in the cloud in the message and he declared to the whole world when brother bam turned that cloud to the right he declared to the whole world it's me this message is me that made this message the truth not because all of a sudden we lined up all the scriptures immediately we could verify it and we could cross reference it and check it no the very person of Jesus Christ being identified in that cloud was the Vindication that this is the truth because this he and this is the same thing making it all the truth cuz he is the truth and when Christ identified himself in the message it Vindicated that this message is the truth not when we figured it out but when he identified himself with it
