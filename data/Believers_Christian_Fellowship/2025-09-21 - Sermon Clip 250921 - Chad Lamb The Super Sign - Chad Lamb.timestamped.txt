[0:01] They say, "I don't know because I'm not
[0:03] an athlete." But they say that the roar
[0:06] of the crowd and the energy in the
[0:07] stadium can actually move the team. It
[0:10] can inspire them. Amen. It can get move
[0:12] them to greater feats. AMEN. LISTEN, WHY
[0:15] DON'T WE BECOME A TEAM? WHY DON'T we
[0:16] root for our team? WHY DON'T WE BECOME
[0:18] ENTHUSIASTIC? WHY DON'T WE CREATE A
[0:21] CHEER and an enthusiasm and an
[0:23] EXCITEMENT FOR WHOEVER'S RUNNING ON THE
[0:25] FIELD AND WHOEVER'S CATCHING THE BALL?
[0:26] WHY DON'T WE PICK UP THE INTENSITY A
[0:29] LITTLE BIT AND GET EXCITED ABOUT THE DAY
[0:31] THAT WE LIVE IN? LISTEN, WE'RE HERE TO
[0:33] MANIFEST ANOTHER SUPER SIGN. WHAT IS THE
[0:35] SUPER SIGN? JESUS in his day manifest
[0:38] the super SIGN OF THE RESURRECTION.
[0:40] DEATH HAS NO more hold on the children
[0:43] of God. He overcame death in himself. He
[0:45] said, "I have power to LAY MY LIFE DOWN.
[0:47] I HAVE THE POWER TO take it up." And
[0:49] when he took it up, he didn't take it UP
[0:50] FOR HIMSELF ONLY, BUT ALL THE SAINTS
[0:52] THAT HAD SLEPT in the Old Testament CAME
[0:54] WITH HIM. THAT WAS A SUPER SIGN.
[0:57] &gt;&gt; And listen, we're living in the hour OF
[0:58] ANOTHER SUPER SIGN. THERE'S going to be
[1:00] a resurrection of sleeping saints. Amen.
[1:03] The super sign is among us. IT'S TAKING
[1:05] PLACE. HE'S BRINGING IT TO PASS RIGHT
[1:07] NOW. ALMOST ANY MOMENT, ANY HOUR, ANY
[1:10] DAY. AMEN. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE saints
[1:12] arise.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; THAT WE SHOULD BE EXCITED ABOUT. WE
[1:16] SHOULD BE IN THE RHYTHM OF THE
[1:18] RESURRECTION. AMEN. LISTEN, THERE'S
[1:20] GOING TO BE AN ENTHUSIASTIC thing take
[1:22] place one of these days that's never
[1:24] happened before. Amen. There's going to
[1:26] be a people ON THIS EARTH THAT DON'T
[1:28] resurrect
[1:31] &gt;&gt; because they're not going to need a
[1:33] resurrection because they're GOING TO BE
[1:34] SO ONE WITH GOD THAT GOD IS GOING TO BE
[1:37] SO ALIVE IN THEIR FLESH THAT THEIR FLESH
[1:40] CANNOT DIE. BUT IT'LL CHANGE
[1:43] in a moment, IN THE TWINKLING of an eye.
[1:46] It'll become a brand new body. NO DEATH
[1:50] BUT LIFE.
[1:52] Let's get into the rhythm of the word.
[1:55] Let's get into the rhythm of the word,
[1:57] into the symphony that God's playing.
[2:00] Because we're living in the generation,
[2:02] friend,
[2:05] are you tired of SITTING ON THE
[2:07] SIDELINES WONDERING WHY EVERYBODY AROUND
[2:08] YOU IS EXCITED AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
[2:10] THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT? ARE YOU TIRED OF
[2:12] SITTING there saying, "All he's saying
[2:14] is confusion to me?" I'm telling YOU,
[2:16] GET INTO THE MESSAGE.
[2:19] READ, LISTEN, TALK ABOUT THE ONLY THING
[2:23] THAT MATTERS IN LIFE,
[2:25] &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AMEN. IF GOD'S NOT IN
[2:27] IT, IT'LL COME TO NOTHING.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; But if God anoints our day, if God
[2:32] ANOINTS OUR WORK, IF GOD ANOINTS OUR
[2:34] FAMILY, if God ANOINTS OUR HOBBY, THEN
[2:37] GOD IS MANIFESTING HIMSELF in us.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; This is the day we live in, friends.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; There's another super sign getting ready
[2:45] to manifest itself. The super sign of
[2:49] eternal life coming into flesh.
