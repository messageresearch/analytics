[16:10] [music]
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:15] Many of you know that in Nigeria there's
[16:17] a bitter persecution against many
[16:19] Christians here. And I had a brother
[16:21] that I know fairly well, brother Gideon
[16:23] Owen Kunlay. He sent me this prayer
[16:26] request for us to read. Says, "Dear
[16:28] saints, please kindly remember brother
[16:30] Maru Garba and four other brethren in
[16:32] pastor Gondu's church at Mat Makater
[16:36] Gibby state in prayers. The bandits,
[16:39] kidnappers, terrorists attacked their
[16:41] village in the early hours of today and
[16:42] took many people away in captivity,
[16:44] including these five brethren. Please
[16:47] kindly pray for divine intervention and
[16:49] that the good Lord will grant our
[16:51] brethren and a host of others total
[16:52] deliverance from the hands of these evil
[16:55] men.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's one thing when you hear
[16:57] something in the news, but when it comes
[16:59] home like this, so we just want to bow
[17:01] our heads together and pray, you just
[17:04] sit it here. Dear heavenly father, we
[17:06] thank you Lord so much for the blessing
[17:09] Lord you've given us of gathering here.
[17:11] But at the same time we're here in peace
[17:13] and safety Lord. There's been an attack
[17:15] and a village and our brethren along
[17:18] with many others have been taken captive
[17:20] Lord. And God I pray you who can control
[17:23] king's hearts. You can control destinies
[17:25] and nations and powers. You can rise up
[17:28] and you can tear down. You can open the
[17:30] Red Sea. You can stop the turning of the
[17:32] earth and the movement of the sun. you
[17:34] can certainly deliver our brethren.
[17:36] Lord, we pray, God, that you would
[17:38] supernaturally intervene in this need
[17:40] and deliver them and restore them back
[17:42] to their families and their homes.
[17:43] [music] Bring safety to them and the
[17:45] many others who are undergoing a bitter
[17:47] persecution. [music] May you, Lord,
[17:49] undertake for their behalf. May you come
[17:51] and bring changes, Lord. And God, I
[17:54] pray, Lord, that you would move on the
[17:55] scene and show your mighty hand. For
[17:58] God, you are mighty to deliver. God, I
[18:01] pray you'd bless us as we remember them,
[18:03] not just tonight, but from the in the
[18:05] future. God, may we pray until we see
[18:08] your hand move. And God, tonight as we
[18:10] look into your word, I [clears throat]
[18:12] pray, Father, that you would just move
[18:14] on us. Move on us mightily, Lord. Move
[18:18] away all the cloudiness of the day and
[18:21] all the stresses and pressures of life.
[18:23] And may we just have a time to relax in
[18:25] your presence, Lord. May we open our
[18:27] hearts and receive from you as you feed
[18:29] into our souls the precious words of
[18:31] life. May the light strike us, Lord, and
[18:33] bring us into a greater revelation. May
[18:36] we walk more pleasing to you in all
[18:38] ways. We love you. I pray you take care
[18:40] take this vessel under your control and
[18:42] [music] speak your words of eternal life
[18:44] to our hearts. In Jesus Christ's name we
[18:47] pray. Amen. And may God bless you. If
[18:50] you could turn to the book of First
[18:52] John.
[18:55] Thank you.
[18:57] Amen. 1 John chapter 4
[19:01] and let's look at verse 14. First John
[19:04] chapter 4:14.
[19:08] [cough and clears throat]
[19:10] And we have seen and do testify that the
[19:12] Lord that the father sent the son to be
[19:14] savior of the world. Whosoever shall
[19:17] confess that Jesus is the son of God,
[19:19] God dwelleth in him, and he in God. And
[19:22] we have known and believed the love that
[19:24] God hath to us. God is love, and he that
[19:27] dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and
[19:30] God in him. Herein is our love made
[19:32] perfect, that we may have boldness in
[19:34] the day of judgment, because as he is,
[19:37] so are we in this world. [clears throat]
[19:39] There is no fear in love, but perfect
[19:41] love casteth out fear, because fear hath
[19:43] torment. He that fearth is not made
[19:46] perfect in love. We love him because he
[19:50] first loved us. Amen. God bless you. As
[19:52] you have your seats,
[19:55] amen.
[19:56] Before we get into the PowerPoint to the
[19:58] slides, I just want to uh remind you
[20:01] that this Sunday, Brother Andreas Ringan
[20:03] from Germany will be here. So, be
[20:05] remembering him in prayer as he's
[20:06] traveling. And traveling's not been easy
[20:09] lately and it's getting more difficult.
[20:10] So, just pray that everything will work
[20:12] out perfect for our brother as he flies
[20:14] in. Um he'll [clears throat] be coming
[20:16] in on Friday, Lord willing. Uh also the
[20:21] next week, the following week after
[20:22] that, uh that brother Jason Demar will
[20:24] be preaching for us on November 16th. So
[20:27] be praying for that. And then he's going
[20:28] to be preaching at the youth meeting in
[20:30] the afternoon. So we'll take the Sunday
[20:31] morning service here and then the youth
[20:33] meeting. So remember both of those
[20:35] things in prayer if you will, please.
[20:37] Amen. So but for tonight, you got me.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. So [cough] if you
[20:45] could pull up the PowerPoint, please. I
[20:47] want to preach on a love that produces
[20:49] works. And we when we read through this,
[20:52] we find out that if we dwell in love, we
[20:54] dwell in him. For God is love. And then
[20:57] what the last verse we read is we love
[20:59] him because he first loved us.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; And we find out, I've said this many
[21:03] times, but our love for God is
[21:05] reciprocal love. God loved us first.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; And if God didn't love us, we couldn't
[21:10] love him back. Amen. So if we find
[21:12] ourselves loving God, it's because he
[21:14] loved us first. We love him because he
[21:16] first loved us.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as as we look at this here,
[21:22] uh we're going to look in Jeremiah.
[21:23] Jeremiah 31 says, "The Lord hath
[21:25] appeared of old unto me, saying, "Yay,
[21:27] have I loved thee with an everlasting
[21:30] love."
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Therefore, with loving kindness have I
[21:33] drawn thee. Why was Jeremiah drawn to
[21:35] God? Because God already loved him with
[21:37] an everlasting love.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Before he was born, God called him to be
[21:41] a prophet to the nations. So God knew
[21:44] him and God loved him and God called
[21:46] him. Amen. And so so I have loved thee
[21:50] with an everlasting love. I don't think
[21:52] that applies only to Jeremiah, but how
[21:54] many believe it applies to you, too?
[21:56] &gt;&gt; So the reason I'm getting into this and
[21:58] I want to look at this is we love God
[22:00] because he first loved us. So he loved
[22:02] us first.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he loved Jeremiah with an
[22:06] everlasting love. So Jeremiah didn't
[22:08] have to do anything to earn this kind of
[22:09] love. This love came before Jeremiah was
[22:12] born and it's a love that can't change.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; So, it's a love that is not dependent on
[22:17] Jeremiah's behavior or conduct.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Uh, we're in Malachi. We know this one
[22:24] really well, but I'm going to read
[22:25] Malachi and then Romans. Malachi 1. I
[22:28] have loved you, sayaeth the Lord. He's
[22:29] speaking to Israel that yet ye say,
[22:32] wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau
[22:34] Jacob's brother? Sayeth the Lord. Yet I
[22:36] loved Jacob and I hated Esau. So,
[22:39] brother Ram goes to the scripture and
[22:40] shows that God's love is elective love.
[22:42] He loved us from before the foundation
[22:44] of the world. And and we we read the
[22:48] same thing in Romans 9 when Paul writes,
[22:50] "For this is the word of promise." At
[22:52] this time will I come and Sarah shall
[22:55] have a son. And not only this, but when
[22:57] Rebecca also had conceived by one, even
[23:00] by our father Isaac, for the children
[23:02] being not yet born, neither having done
[23:05] any good or evil, that the purpose of
[23:08] God according to election might stand,
[23:10] not of works, but of him that calleth.
[23:13] It was said unto her, "The elder shall
[23:15] serve the younger, as it is written,
[23:17] Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I love
[23:19] have I hated." So God according to
[23:24] election, according to his purpose, he
[23:27] had already determined, he had already
[23:28] declared that I loved Jacob and he hated
[23:31] Esau before. Uh I'm going to I'm going
[23:34] to highlight this as we go. For the
[23:37] children being not yet born,
[23:41] &gt;&gt; neither having done good or evil, that
[23:44] the purpose according to election might
[23:46] stand, not of works, but of him that
[23:49] calleth. God wasn't waiting to find out
[23:51] if Jacob was going to do good and be a
[23:53] good boy and then he'll choose to love
[23:55] him. But God loved him before. And we
[23:57] know that when we look at the life of
[23:58] Jacob and Esau, Amen. Esau was the
[24:01] better man. Esau had the better
[24:03] characteristics, the better traits.
[24:04] Amen. He was more faithful to his
[24:06] father. Amen. And all of these other
[24:08] things. But it did that didn't matter
[24:10] because God had known him before. And he
[24:12] was in the mind of God before and in the
[24:14] plan of God before. So before he did any
[24:17] good or evil, one was chosen and one was
[24:19] not.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; That the purpose of God according to
[24:23] election might stand. And the reason we
[24:25] we get into this is because I'm talking
[24:27] about a amen a love that produces works.
[24:30] Because works is an outcropping of love,
[24:33] not of any desire or need to be accepted
[24:36] by God. We've already been accepted in
[24:38] the beloved.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; He loved us before with an everlasting
[24:42] love. So we don't do things to get God's
[24:44] approval. Well, we already have God's
[24:46] approval.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, that has to go that that has
[24:51] to be put to rest from the very
[24:52] beginning. We have to start with that
[24:54] foundation. Amen. Because if we start
[24:56] with the foundation that I'm working my
[24:58] way up into acceptance with God and I'm
[24:59] hoping someday to be accepted, that's a
[25:02] Catholic doctrine where you never are
[25:03] assured of your salvation, but you're
[25:05] always hoping to be good enough and to
[25:07] have a shorter stay in purgatory and
[25:09] maybe someday to pass from purgator.
[25:11] Listen, it's not that way at all. The
[25:13] purpose of God according to election
[25:15] stands. God knows whom he's chosen
[25:18] &gt;&gt; and he's loved them with an everlasting
[25:20] love. Amen. So there's no fear. Amen.
[25:23] We're not fearful of not making it.
[25:25] We're not fearful of not being uh uh uh
[25:27] good enough to be accepted by God. All
[25:29] of that has to be put to rest.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; Must be
[25:35] in Galatians. Now we're going to read
[25:36] two places out of Galatians. Paul
[25:38] writes, "I'm crucified with Christ.
[25:40] Nevertheless, I live yet not I, but
[25:42] Christ liveth in me. And the life which
[25:44] I now live in the flesh, I live by the
[25:46] faith of the Son of God, who loved me
[25:49] and gave himself for me. I do not
[25:52] frustrate the grace of God. For if
[25:54] righteousness came by the law, then
[25:56] Christ is dead in vain. If I can become
[25:59] righteous by doing the deeds of the law,
[26:02] then Jesus died in vain.
[26:05] But he died because there was nothing I
[26:07] can do to become righteous by good
[26:09] deeds. Amen. So he has declared me
[26:12] righteous by faith. And he's paid the
[26:14] price of redemption and the price of
[26:16] sanctification to free me from the
[26:18] bondage of sin and from my old life.
[26:20] Amen. So that I can be declared
[26:22] righteous in Christ.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; So
[26:28] he lives. I now live in the flesh. I
[26:32] live by the faith of the son of God.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; That's not faith in the son of God, but
[26:37] the very faith of God has delivered him
[26:38] and he's living that life in the flesh.
[26:41] Now, by that faith who loved me and gave
[26:44] himself for me. This is Paul writing
[26:47] this and and it's amazing. Paul looks to
[26:49] this the Calvary and he can say the son
[26:52] of God loved me and gave himself for me.
[26:55] And Paul didn't know it till after the
[26:57] deed was done. That means Jesus Christ
[27:00] loved Paul and gave himself for Paul.
[27:02] Before Paul met the pillar of fire,
[27:04] before Paul could do good things, before
[27:06] Paul could submit to the word, for
[27:08] before Paul could agree with the word,
[27:10] Amen. Jesus Christ loved him and gave
[27:13] himself for him.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a what a consolation. That's
[27:18] why Paul was not going to frustrate the
[27:20] grace of God.
[27:22] Galatians 5, he says, "Stand fast,
[27:24] therefore in the liberty wherewith
[27:26] Christ hath made us free." "And be not
[27:29] entangled again with the yoke of
[27:30] bondage." He's talking about the law.
[27:32] Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if you
[27:35] be circumcised, Christ shall profit you
[27:37] nothing. For I testify again to every
[27:39] man that is circumcised that he is a
[27:41] debtor to do the whole law. Christ has
[27:44] become of no effect unto you. Whosoever
[27:46] of you are justified by the law, you are
[27:48] fallen from grace. For we through the
[27:51] spirit wait for the hope of
[27:53] righteousness by faith. For in Jesus
[27:55] Christ neither circumcision avaleth
[27:57] anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith
[28:00] which workketh by love.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; So how does faith work? By love. Because
[28:06] he loved me and gave himself for me.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And my faith workketh by love, not
[28:13] by the deeds of the law. Amen. So in
[28:16] adoption, Brother Ben says, "I don't
[28:18] live true to my wife because I think
[28:19] she'd divorce me. I live true to my wife
[28:23] because I love her." It's a legal
[28:25] position that we have taken that we love
[28:27] one another. First, before it could be
[28:29] there, it had to be a love. I love her.
[28:32] Although I believe if I done something
[28:33] wrong, she'd forgive me. Still, I
[28:36] wouldn't do it anyhow. I love her.
[28:39] That's the way it is with Christ. He
[28:41] said, "I'm 50. If I live to be 90 or
[28:43] 100, if I have another 50 years to
[28:45] preach and I never preach a time and I
[28:49] go down and set on the river, I'm saved
[28:51] anyhow. God saved me by his grace
[28:54] unmmerited of anything I could ever do,
[28:56] did do, or anything else. I preach
[28:58] because I love him and I love his
[29:00] people.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; But brother Benham was very clear. He
[29:03] wasn't serving God because he needed to
[29:06] serve God to to be saved. Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; He He says, "If I live another 50 years
[29:13] and never preach another sermon, not
[29:15] another single time, and just go down
[29:17] sit on the river,
[29:19] I'm saved."
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm saved anyhow. Because he's
[29:24] saved by grace. And we know that for for
[29:27] by grace are you saved through faith in
[29:29] that not of yourselves. It is the gift
[29:31] of God. Amen. In grace, brother says,
[29:33] "Grace and love are twin sisters."
[29:36] Because God can't prefer you or give you
[29:38] a favor unless he loves you. He loves
[29:40] you and extended grace to you. And you
[29:42] apprehended that grace through faith.
[29:43] And that faith is not even your own. It
[29:45] is a gift of God.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. The faith that you have to believe
[29:49] in what God has done for you and that he
[29:51] loved you first and that he gave himself
[29:53] for you and by faith you now live this
[29:55] life by the faith of the son of God.
[29:58] Amen. So, brother Ben's super clear and
[30:00] he goes through this and and Paul's very
[30:02] clear on this. Brother Ben is very clear
[30:04] on this that you don't have to do
[30:06] anything to earn his love. You had his
[30:08] love before the foundation of the world.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Your names are written in the lamb's
[30:13] book of life before the foundation of
[30:14] the world. He loved you before with an
[30:17] everlasting love.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; You were saved before the foundation of
[30:21] the world.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Brother says, "You weren't saved on any
[30:24] certain day. You were always saved."
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Right? We went through that. I believe
[30:29] uh on Sunday, you were always saved
[30:31] because in the mind of God, you were
[30:32] always saved. In the lamb's book of
[30:33] life, you were always in the book of
[30:35] redemption. You were sealed under the
[30:37] blood before the foundation of the
[30:39] world.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I don't need to do works to be
[30:45] saved. And I don't need to do works to
[30:47] find favor with God. Amen. I already
[30:49] have favor. That's what grace is, is
[30:51] favor to me
[30:52] &gt;&gt; and it's already there.
[30:55] But brother Ben said, "I don't just love
[30:57] my wife because I'm afraid she'll
[30:58] divorce me. I love her because I love
[31:01] her."
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; That's simple.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; In the in the book of James here, it
[31:07] says, "Thou believest that there is one
[31:09] God. Thou doest well. The de the devils
[31:12] also believe and tremble. But willil
[31:15] thou know, oh vain man, that faith
[31:17] without works is dead?"
[31:21] Faith without works is dead.
[31:24] Amen. We can go in the reverse. We know
[31:27] works without faith will not produce any
[31:29] life.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; That's what trying to keep the law,
[31:32] Amen, and trying to do good works, Amen.
[31:35] to have faith, that won't work. Works
[31:36] without faith will not produce
[31:38] salvation.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; But James tells us that faith without
[31:41] works is dead, being alone. And he
[31:45] shows, he begins to tell us, amen, show
[31:47] me your faith without your works and
[31:48] I'll show you my faith by my works
[31:50] because what I believe, amen, the real
[31:53] genuine faith and the love of God will
[31:55] produce something in me and there'll be
[31:57] a life that will manifest behind that
[31:59] love. Behind that genuine faith will
[32:02] will bring about a life and you will see
[32:04] works. We've seen it all through the
[32:05] Bible because the Bible is full of good
[32:07] works that people did who met God and
[32:09] loved God.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so faith without works is
[32:13] dead. Jesus says in John 14:15, "If you
[32:18] love me, keep my commandments."
[32:21] &gt;&gt; When we look at this, Christ's love for
[32:24] us is never in question.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Christ's love for us is not in question.
[32:32] It's our love for him.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[32:35] &gt;&gt; That's our response to him.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; If you love me, keep my commandments.
[32:40] I'll say this also. Jesus never demanded
[32:44] anybody obey him.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; He never demanded He never demanded
[32:50] anybody obey him. He simply said, "If
[32:52] you love me, keep my commandments."
[32:54] &gt;&gt; It's your choice. Amen. You did not
[32:57] demanded. It wasn't commanded. Anybody
[32:58] who wanted to walk away could walk away
[33:00] any time.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't demand anybody obey him.
[33:04] He just gave his word. And he says, "If
[33:06] you love me, keep my commandments." So
[33:08] his love for us is not the question. And
[33:09] it's our love for him
[33:12] &gt;&gt; that's in question.
[33:14] So brother Bam is referring here in the
[33:17] Sardisian church age to the first age.
[33:20] He said the first church age was the
[33:21] Ephesian church age from AD55 to 170.
[33:25] Paul being the star and it was the first
[33:27] church age. Works without love was God's
[33:30] complaint. What was God's complaint in
[33:33] the first age? Works without love.
[33:35] Because the first stage in in Revelation
[33:37] chapter 2, it starts off, I know thy
[33:39] works and thy labor and thy patience.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Starts off with works and labor and
[33:45] patience. Endurance. Amen. And he
[33:47] recognized that. But when he comes down
[33:48] a little further, he says, "But I have
[33:50] somewhat against thee. Thou has left thy
[33:52] first love." They kept the works. They
[33:55] kept the labor, but they lost the love.
[33:58] And his complaint against them was works
[34:00] without love. Amen. So God's not looking
[34:03] for a works program. God's looking for
[34:06] somebody that'll love him back.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; He's already loved us. We love him
[34:11] because he first loved us. He's looking
[34:13] for the reciprocal love. And Jesus said,
[34:14] "If you love me, keep my commands." You
[34:16] don't have to.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; You don't have to, but if you love me,
[34:20] keep my commandments. It's voluntary.
[34:23] And it's an outcropping of love. What is
[34:26] the keeping of the commandments? It's
[34:28] not fear.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:30] It's not it's not any of those things.
[34:32] The the keeping of Jesus' commandments
[34:35] is love. Because that's what Jesus told
[34:37] us to do. If we love him, keep his
[34:40] commandments. He didn't say, "Keep my
[34:41] commandments." He said, "If you love me,
[34:43] keep my commandments."
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; So, it's it's an outflow of love.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; It's it's a reciprocation of his love to
[34:56] us. It's a recognition of all he's done
[34:58] for me. How could I not love him?
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; So the complaint was works without love.
[35:06] So faith without works is dead, but
[35:08] works without love is not pleasing to
[35:10] God either.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Look here at the rich young ruler. We've
[35:16] been through this scripture a lot. But
[35:18] he comes to Jesus said, "Master, good
[35:20] teacher, what must I do to inherit
[35:22] eternal life?" Jesus tells him to keep
[35:24] the commandments. He said, "I've done
[35:25] all this from my youth." And it says,
[35:28] "Then Jesus beholding him loved him."
[35:32] &gt;&gt; I This is so good.
[35:37] Jesus loved him first
[35:40] &gt;&gt; before he told him what he was going to
[35:42] tell him next. He loved him.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; He wasn't waiting to see if he would
[35:49] obey or not.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Before he gave the commandment, he loved
[35:54] him. And because he loved him, he gave
[35:57] him the commandment. So the commandment
[35:59] was an outflow of Jesus's love for this
[36:02] rich young ruler.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Because he loved him, he would tell him
[36:07] what he needed.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus told him what he needed,
[36:14] he says, "And he said unto them, one
[36:15] thing thou lackest.
[36:18] Go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast,
[36:20] and give to the poor, and thou shalt
[36:22] have treasure in heaven. and come take
[36:24] up the cross and follow me. And he was
[36:26] sad at the saying and went away grieved
[36:30] for he had great possessions.
[36:33] Jesus was looking at this man
[36:36] [clears throat]
[36:37] and Jesus did not tell him to go sell
[36:40] all that he had because he disliked him,
[36:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Because he wanted to punish him,
[36:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Because he wanted to see whether or not
[36:48] he's worthy of my love. No, Jesus loved
[36:51] him. That's why he gave him the
[36:52] commandment. And the commandment was an
[36:54] expression of love
[36:57] &gt;&gt; because he knew that this man was bound
[36:59] by something. And he says, "You've done
[37:01] all the commandments. You've been to
[37:02] church. You've paid. You've done all of
[37:04] these things, but there's one thing
[37:05] you're lacking. And I love you enough to
[37:07] tell you where your problem is."
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; And the man looked at the commandment
[37:13] that Jesus gave. Cuz listen, this is a
[37:16] commandment. Right.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; One thing thou lackest, go thy way, sell
[37:19] all thou hast, give to the poor. Thou
[37:22] shalt have treasures in heaven, and then
[37:24] take up thy cross, AND FOLLOW ME. HE'S
[37:26] INVITED NOW INTO FELLOWSHIP with Jesus.
[37:29] Amen. And the man looks at this and he
[37:32] doesn't see this as love.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; When he looks at what Jesus told him,
[37:39] sell all of that I have, give it to the
[37:41] poor. Amen. Then take up my cross and
[37:44] follow him. And it SAYS HE WAS SAD AT
[37:47] THE SAYING, NOT REJOICING because Jesus
[37:49] loved him. He wasn't feeling loved.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Are we on the same page? HE HE DIDN'T
[37:56] SAY, "OH, he is so loving.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; That was the nicest thing anybody's ever
[38:04] said to me."
[38:06] No, he walked away sad
[38:09] &gt;&gt; and went away grieved
[38:13] &gt;&gt; for he had great possessions.
[38:16] See, it was this this is not an issue of
[38:19] whether or not Jesus loved this man.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; It's whether or not he loved Jesus.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Because he said, "If you love me, keep
[38:28] my commandments."
[38:31] &gt;&gt; It he could have said all that he wanted
[38:33] to say. Oh rabbi, oh great master. He
[38:36] could have called him all kinds of
[38:38] wonderful titles of adearment and then
[38:40] he could he ran up and he bowed down
[38:42] before him and showed honor and respect
[38:44] and and it looked like he was loving
[38:46] this master and it looked like he was
[38:47] surrendering to the master. But when
[38:49] this when Jesus Christ looked at him and
[38:51] loved him, HIS LOVE CAUSED him to tell
[38:54] him the truth about his situation and
[38:56] give him a commandment that would not
[38:59] hinder him, bind him, hurt him. He gave
[39:02] him a word that would free him.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; And this man walked away from freedom
[39:07] because the freedom that Jesus offered
[39:09] looked like bondage.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; It looked like poverty. It looked like
[39:13] heartbreak. It looked like heartache. It
[39:15] looked unfair. It looked uh you could
[39:17] imagine he thought that's uh that that's
[39:20] irresponsible for him to say that.
[39:22] That's an EXTREME STATEMENT THAT NOBODY
[39:24] else has to do that. How could he say
[39:26] that to me? He he's over the top.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; That's a bit legalistic.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; But Jesus told him because he loved him.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, if we could look at every
[39:41] commandment of God that way and
[39:43] everything that he taught us and all
[39:45] that the word instruct us and then
[39:46] everything that HE TAUGHT US THROUGH A
[39:48] PROPHET.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; How to live in this age, how to live in
[39:52] Leodysia, what to stay away from, what's
[39:54] what's acceptable God, what's not. Amen.
[39:57] There's it's a shame that some people
[39:58] look at that and they think that's hard
[40:00] preaching and that's bondage and that's
[40:02] legalism. Listen friends, that's freedom
[40:05] from Leodysian spirits. It's freedom
[40:07] from bondage. DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE
[40:09] FASHIONS OF THE WORLD. DON'T GET CAUGHT
[40:11] UP IN THE TRAPPINGS OF THE DEVIL. DON'T
[40:13] GET CAUGHT UP WITH THE entertainments of
[40:14] Leodysia. AND A PROPHET CAME ALONG TO HE
[40:17] WAS THE VOICE OF GOD IN OUR AGE, IN OUR
[40:20] GENERATION. AMEN. TO FREE US from the
[40:22] things that bind us. And it's a shame
[40:24] that so many people look at the LOVE OF
[40:26] GOD EXPRESSED TO THEM AND IT DOESN'T
[40:28] LOOK LIKE LOVE.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; AND THEY WALK AWAY FROM A CHURCH SERVICE
[40:32] OR LISTENING to a message UH READING A
[40:34] BOOK AND THEY WALK AWAY SAD. AND THEY
[40:37] WALK AWAY GRIEVED. AMEN. BECAUSE THEY
[40:39] DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP THINGS OF THE
[40:41] WORLD. THEY won't want to give up
[40:42] entertainments AND THINGS THAT BRING
[40:43] PLEASURE.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; And it's NOT THE QUESTION OF uh who
[40:50] loves who. JESUS SPOKE IT BECAUSE HE
[40:52] LOVES US.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; He wants us to be free. THIS MAN WAS
[40:57] RICH. This man was religious. THIS MAN
[40:59] DID ARMS DEEDS. THIS MAN FOLLOWED THE
[41:02] COMMANDMENTS FROM HIS YOUTH. HE DID
[41:04] EVERYTHING that looked good TO HIM.
[41:06] EVERYTHING THAT MADE HIM FEEL LIKE he
[41:08] was worthy of eternal life.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS BOUND BY HIS RICHES.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; RELIGIOUS GOING TO CHURCH, KEEPING THE
[41:17] COMMANDMENTS IN BONDAGE TO RICHES. AND
[41:20] HOW, BROTHER CHAD, HOW DO YOU KNOW HE
[41:21] was in bondage to riches? Cuz when Jesus
[41:23] GAVE HIM A COMMANDMENT, HE COULDN'T
[41:25] FOLLOW JESUS CUZ JESUS INVITED HIM,
[41:27] "COME AND FOLLOW ME." BUT HE TURNED HIS
[41:29] BACK ON JESUS AND WALKED AWAY CUZ HE was
[41:31] bound by his riches.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; And he saw the commandment as a
[41:37] hardship.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Instead of freedom and instead of love.
[41:43] [snorts]
[41:45] And so
[41:47] he was receiving the love of Jesus,
[41:51] but he couldn't respond in love
[41:54] &gt;&gt; because he loved himself
[41:57] &gt;&gt; and his riches more than he loved Jesus.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; And and it sounds like a hard statement
[42:04] to say, but it's nothing but the truth
[42:07] &gt;&gt; because Jesus says, "Sell all of that
[42:09] and come
[42:11] &gt;&gt; follow me."
[42:13] It's an invitation to fellowship. It's
[42:16] an invitation to be with him and be part
[42:18] of his program. Come and follow me. But
[42:21] what he wanted was his riches more than
[42:23] he wanted to follow Jesus.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; So he was bound by his riches and the
[42:29] word of God was his freedom. And it was
[42:32] love, but he couldn't receive it as
[42:35] love.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; And because he didn't receive it as
[42:38] love, he didn't respond in love. because
[42:40] we love him. Because he first loved us.
[42:43] And when we see the commandments of God
[42:44] as his love, then when we love him, we
[42:47] keep his commandments.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; It's a response of love,
[42:52] not of fear,
[42:54] &gt;&gt; not of trying to gain acceptance. It's
[42:57] an absolute responding of love.
[43:02] Jesus Jesus says in John 15, "As the
[43:07] Father have loved me, so have I loved
[43:09] you. Continue ye in my love. If you keep
[43:14] my commandments, you shall abide in my
[43:16] love, even as I have kept my father's
[43:18] commandments and abide in his love."
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Look at this statement.
[43:25] Uh, if you keep my commandments, if
[43:30] you shall abide in my love.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; If we don't understand what Jesus is
[43:36] saying, it looks like he's saying, "If
[43:39] you don't keep my commandments, you
[43:41] won't have my love
[43:42] &gt;&gt; or I won't love you." That's not true.
[43:45] Jesus love for the rich young ruler
[43:47] never changed.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; He still loved him. He loved him before
[43:51] he gave him the commandment. He loved
[43:53] him before the man chose right or wrong.
[43:55] He loved him first.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Because he loved him, he told him the
[43:58] truth. Now he says, "If you keep my
[44:00] commandments, you shall abide in my
[44:02] love." Look at this. Even as
[44:06] I've kept my father's commandments and
[44:08] abide in his love.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; So, could Jesus ever be beyond the love
[44:14] of God, the love of the father? No. He
[44:18] He wasn't in jeopardy of not being loved
[44:20] by the father.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Right? You believe that?
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; But he says, "If you keep my
[44:26] commandments, you'll abide in my love
[44:28] even as I have kept my father's
[44:31] commandment and abide in his love."
[44:34] &gt;&gt; So think about this, friends. The
[44:36] father's love is not changing for Jesus,
[44:39] for the son.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; But when the son keeps the commandments,
[44:44] he abides in the love that's already
[44:46] there.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. He doesn't receive new love or
[44:51] more love or greater love or lose love.
[44:54] The love's already there. But when he
[44:56] keeps the commandment, WHICH IS LOVE, HE
[44:58] ABIDES IN THE LOVE. And Jesus tells us
[45:01] it's the same thing for us in him. If
[45:03] you keep my commandments, YOU ABIDE or
[45:06] live or dwell or remain in my love
[45:09] because my commandment is my love.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; IS MY LOVE EXPRESSED TO YOU BECAUSE I
[45:16] LOVE this young man. AMEN. I TOLD HIM
[45:18] the truth. So my commandment was my love
[45:21] and he walked away from my love. So he
[45:23] no longer could abide in my love.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't mean Jesus didn't love
[45:28] him.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MEAN JESUS LOVE FOR HIM
[45:32] CHANGED. BUT HE COULDN'T ABIDE IN HIS
[45:34] LOVE. TO ABIDE IN HIS LOVE, HE WOULD
[45:36] HAVE KEPT HIS COMMANDMENT, sold all he
[45:37] had, give to the poor, took up his
[45:39] cross, and followed Jesus. And he would
[45:41] BE ABIDING IN THE LOVE THAT WAS ALREADY
[45:43] THERE AND REMAINED. AMEN.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; But he left the love of Jesus. The love
[45:49] Jesus had for him didn't leave.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Does the scripture make sense?
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus is not saying, "I'm going to
[45:56] withhold love from you now cuz you
[45:57] didn't do what I said."
[46:00] &gt;&gt; He's not fickle like that.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But [clears throat] his
[46:05] commandment is love.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; And if you keep his commandment, you
[46:09] abide in him.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:13] It's never a problem with the Lord. The
[46:16] problem's always with us.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; He's never failed us. He's never failed
[46:21] to love us. He's never failed to tell us
[46:23] the truth. He's never failed to extend
[46:25] his love and mercy unto us. It's never
[46:27] his failure. It's always ours.
[46:31] Amen.
[46:35] When I think about just this statement,
[46:40] the worthiness of God to be obeyed.
[46:46] Just if we could just reflect on this
[46:48] for a minute.
[46:50] God who is the supreme
[46:54] being, the deity, the creator of all
[46:56] heavens and earth.
[47:01] We have no life without him.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; There is no creation without him. There
[47:06] is nothing without him.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Just on that basis alone, he's worthy to
[47:12] be obeyed.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; And then on top of that, he's expressed
[47:17] such love towards us.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; And that he chose us before the
[47:21] foundation. He loved us. He came down
[47:23] himself in a body of flesh and was
[47:25] brutally tortured and died and shed his
[47:27] own blood so that we could go free
[47:29] because he loved us that much. HOW COULD
[47:31] WE NOT LOVE HIM BACK?
[47:34] &gt;&gt; And I wrote this. I wrote this statement
[47:36] earlier today. I said, "Surrendering to
[47:38] the sheer wonder of his magnificence
[47:41] should be the natural response of a
[47:43] revelation of his awesomeness."
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Can I read that again?
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Surrendering to the sheer wonder of his
[47:51] magnificence should be the natural
[47:54] expression of a revelation of his
[47:55] awesomeness.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; NOT SO I CAN GET something out of him.
[47:59] Not so I can get treats because I'm a
[48:01] good boy and I I'm like a dog and I I
[48:03] DID THE TRICK AND I GET THE TREAT. THAT
[48:05] HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. I SHOULD
[48:07] GIVE HIM MY WHOLE LIFE JUST BECAUSE HE'S
[48:09] AMAZING.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Just because how WONDERFUL HE IS, HOW
[48:12] AWESOME HE IS, HOW ARUCK I AM BY HIS
[48:14] MAJESTY. HE IS GOD. AMEN. HE HAS DONE
[48:16] ALL THIS ALONE. AMEN. NOT EVEN IF HE
[48:19] NEVER DID A THING FOR ME, I SHOULD
[48:21] PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO HIM BASED ON HIS
[48:23] CHARACTER ALONE,
[48:25] &gt;&gt; BASED ON HIS PERFECTION, BASED ON HIS
[48:27] HIS AWESOMENESS. YEAH. AMEN.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. How did we get to be created
[48:33] BEINGS? AMEN. WHO WOULD SNUB their nose
[48:34] and turn THEIR BACK AND DECIDE WHETHER
[48:36] OR NOT THEY WANTED TO OBEY GOD'S LAW?
[48:38] HOW FOOLISH. HOW TRIVIAL. I MEAN, YOU
[48:41] TALK ABOUT RIDICULOUS.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; He is awesome and worthy of our respect
[48:51] and obedience. If he never did a thing
[48:54] for us,
[48:56] &gt;&gt; he's worthy of respect and obedience.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; How do we get to the place where we
[49:02] decide what we want to listen to and
[49:03] what we don't want to listen to? What
[49:06] pride in the human race.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; What shameful pride.
[49:13] If you look at 1 John 5, it says,
[49:15] "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[49:18] Christ is born of God. And everyone that
[49:21] loveth him that begth loveth him also
[49:23] that is begotten of him. By this we know
[49:26] that we love the children of God when we
[49:28] love God and keep his commandments. For
[49:30] this is the love of God that we keep his
[49:32] commandments, and his commandments are
[49:34] not grievious."
[49:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Did the rich young ruler walked away
[49:38] grieved?
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; The commandment was grievious to him.
[49:42] Yeah.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; If he only could weigh what he was
[49:46] exchanging.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; It would not have been a grievous
[49:50] commandment. It would have been a
[49:52] glorious commandment.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So his commandments for this is
[49:58] the love of God that we keep his
[50:00] commandments and his commandments are
[50:02] not grievious. So the question is not
[50:04] whether God loves us or not. The
[50:05] question is whether we love him or not.
[50:08] That's
[50:08] &gt;&gt; right. Amen. In the Thotyron church age,
[50:11] brother Bram says, "I know your love,
[50:14] service, faith, and patience. You will
[50:16] note that their love is placed between
[50:18] works and service." And that is the
[50:20] right place for it because without love,
[50:23] our works are not accepted before God,
[50:25] and neither is our service. Paul
[50:27] speaking to the Corinthians said,
[50:28] "Without love, I am nothing. And
[50:30] whatever I do is without profit, unless
[50:32] it is done in love." Now, you can see
[50:34] right here that these believers weren't
[50:36] in that nickelan class that did works as
[50:38] a means of salvation or to be admired by
[50:41] men. They did their works out of the
[50:44] love of God that was shed abroad in
[50:46] their hearts by the Holy Ghost. That's
[50:48] the way I want to do works.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; I want to serve God because I love him.
[50:53] Because he first loved me. And if I
[50:55] could give more of my life, I want to
[50:57] give more of my life to him.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:02] And Christ is revealed in his own word.
[51:03] The prophet was telling a story here. He
[51:05] says, "I've been this week down in the
[51:07] country staying with with some very dear
[51:10] friends. I asked some of them at the
[51:12] table yesterday when we was eating. We
[51:14] always sit around and have a like a
[51:16] little study on the Bible. We was
[51:18] talking about love and there was a
[51:20] certain person said to me, he said, "I
[51:22] believe you're an antichrist." I said,
[51:24] "If that would be pleasing to my Lord,
[51:26] that's what I want to be. I want to be
[51:29] whatever he wants me to be. I love him.
[51:32] [clears throat] And if he should cast me
[51:34] into hell, I still will love him. If I
[51:37] go with the same spirit I have now, he
[51:39] looked at me kind of strange.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; But brother M showing us a genuine love
[51:45] for God.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; That's not tied to a love of self, but
[51:50] just a love for God.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; I seen four or five of them there. Young
[51:55] men, young wives, fine women. I know how
[51:58] them boys love their wives. So I said to
[51:59] them, I said, "Here's the way to test
[52:01] it. If your wife before you were
[52:03] married, now you go back, say this
[52:05] married life, you've been dreaming you
[52:07] were married. You really wasn't married,
[52:08] but you dreamed you were. And you woke
[52:10] up and you went and talked it over with
[52:11] your girlfriend and said, "You know, I
[52:13] dreamed that we were married and we had
[52:14] children. We were living happy, waiting
[52:17] for the coming of the Lord and
[52:19] everything." And then this girl would
[52:21] say to you, "You know, I love another
[52:23] man better than I love you. I could be
[52:26] happier with the other man. Could you
[52:28] from your heart love her well enough to
[52:30] say, "God's blessing rest upon you, my
[52:32] dear. Go with this other man."
[52:35] Now, now check that each of you men or
[52:38] you women. See, well, if your love is
[52:40] correct, you would do that for you are
[52:43] interested in her welfare. What you know
[52:45] you could have her, you can live with
[52:47] her. She she's your wife or she will be.
[52:49] She'll marry you, but she won't be
[52:51] happy. She would be happier. And then if
[52:53] you love her, then you want her to be
[52:55] happy. Therefore, whatever the will of
[52:57] God is, let God's will be done, whether
[53:00] I'm happy with it or not.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; I want to live so he will be pleased
[53:05] with what I do. Therefore, check your
[53:07] objective and your motive. By that, you
[53:09] know, whether you love God or not. What
[53:11] if he said, what what if he'd say, "You
[53:13] serve me if I'm going to cast you away.
[53:15] I love you anyhow."
[53:18] Brother showing us how we should love
[53:21] God.
[53:23] Whether I'm wh sorry I did it again.
[53:27] I crossed it out.
[53:30] Whether I'm happy with it or not, I want
[53:33] to live so he'll be pleased with what I
[53:35] do.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; I want his his command, his desire, his
[53:39] will to be supreme in my life because I
[53:42] love him. And I surely want to love him
[53:44] more than I love myself.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; But you realize, friends, that's the
[53:47] struggle we're struggling with. This old
[53:50] flesh wants demands attention and time
[53:52] and protection and all these things.
[53:54] We're struggling with the love of self
[53:55] versus the love of God. But I want him
[53:57] to have supreme authority in my life. I
[54:00] want him to be the one that I love.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Let self take a backseat.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the
[54:07] world that he gave."
[54:10] He demonstrated love to us. God so loved
[54:12] the world, he gave his only begotten
[54:14] son. What did love compel him to do?
[54:16] Give. What does love compel me to do?
[54:19] Get or give?
[54:20] &gt;&gt; It compels me to give.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Lord God left as a an example. He loved
[54:26] the world. Amen. So he gave. If I love,
[54:29] I'll give. Amen. It's not about what I
[54:32] can get. It's about what I can give.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Says, we realize that in this in doing
[54:37] this, it pleased God so well to see that
[54:40] Abraham loved him above everything else
[54:42] on earth, even his only son. He loved
[54:45] him above what anybody could say,
[54:47] anybody could do. He still loved God
[54:49] enough to believe his word. All
[54:51] Abraham's seed believes God like that. I
[54:54] said, "Oh, God, help me believe you like
[54:56] that." And he's referring to Abraham
[54:57] taking his son, his only son Isaac, up
[54:59] to Mount Mariah and and and binding his
[55:02] hands and laying him on an altar and
[55:04] raising a knife to slay him because God
[55:06] said, "Take thy son, thy only son Isaac,
[55:08] and sacrifice him unto me." And and
[55:11] Abraham loved God so much. He was going
[55:13] to obey God whether he understood the
[55:15] commandment or not. Whether he liked it
[55:17] or not, he come to the place in his
[55:20] relationship with God that he was he
[55:22] learned to trust him. He learned to love
[55:23] him. He learned to obey him so much that
[55:25] if he got a request that seemed
[55:27] absolutely ridiculous, outlandish,
[55:30] impossible, but he knew it was God
[55:32] speaking to him. He was going to obey
[55:34] because he loved God more than anything
[55:36] else.
[55:38] more than his son, MORE THAN HIS WIFE,
[55:40] MORE THAN HIMSELF, MORE THAN ANYTHING
[55:42] ELSE, HE LOVED GOD. AND BROTHER, AND GOD
[55:45] WAS SO PLEASED WITH THIS, HE PUT HIM TO
[55:47] THE TEST. He put him to the moment. He
[55:48] got him to brother Bam said, he raised
[55:50] his hand WITH A KNIFE ABOUT THE PLUNGING
[55:52] INTO ISAAC'S HEART. And the angel of the
[55:54] Lord said, "STAY THY HAND." SAID, "NOW I
[55:57] KNOWEST THAT THOU fear God."
[56:00] &gt;&gt; God was so pleased with his actions.
[56:02] Amen. And and brother said, "All
[56:04] Abraham's seed believes God like that."
[56:06] I tell you friends, I don't know that I
[56:08] always do, but I want to. And I believe
[56:09] I'm Abraham's seed. And I want to love
[56:11] him more than I love anything else. WHY?
[56:14] BECAUSE HE FIRST LOVED ME. LOOK WHAT
[56:15] HE'S DONE FOR ME. I'M A NOBODY FROM
[56:17] NOWHERE. AND I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE
[56:20] IN THIS WORLD. I was a I WAS A RENEGADE.
[56:23] I WAS EVERYTHING ELSE AND TOSSED ABOUT
[56:25] AND AND AND IGNORANT AND BLIND AS CAN
[56:27] BE. AND GOD BROUGHT THIS MESSAGE TO ME
[56:30] AND HE OPENED MY EYES. HE REDEEMED me
[56:32] and he DREW ME TO HIMSELF. AND HE
[56:34] WHISPERED LOVE SECRETS IN MY EAR. AND HE
[56:36] OPENED UP THE BACK PART OF HIS MIND. HE
[56:38] UNVEILED HIMSELF IN THE HIDDEN CHAMBER
[56:40] AND SHOWED ME WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING FOR
[56:42] 6,000 7,000 YEARS. EVEN BEFORE THAT,
[56:46] WHAT HIS PLAN WAS before the foundation
[56:47] OF THE WORLD. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
[56:49] GARDEN OF EDEN? I KNOW THE SECRET THAT
[56:51] THE WHOLE WORLD DOESN'T KNOW.
[56:52] [screaming] AMEN. HOW COULD I NOT LOVE
[56:54] HIM? HOW COULD I NOT SERVE HIM? HOW
[56:56] COULD I TURN MY NOSE UP BECAUSE THE
[56:58] PROPHET SAYS SOMETHING THAT I DOESN'T
[56:59] THINK SOUND RIGHT WHEN GOD HAS BEEN SO
[57:01] GOOD TO ME? AMEN.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; IT'S AN ARROGANT, SELFISH SPIRIT.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; I OWE HIM EVERYTHING. WHAT? WHO WAS I
[57:10] THAT HE SHOULD COME AND REVEAL THE WORD
[57:11] TO ME? WHAT WISDOM DID I HAVE? WHAT
[57:13] INTELLIGENCE DID I HAVE? WHAT FAMILY
[57:15] CONNECTIONS DID I HAVE? I MEAN, WHAT
[57:17] WHAT WAS I? I WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; NOT EVEN A DOT ON THE MAP, NOT EVEN A
[57:24] NUMBER ON A TALLY sheet somewhere.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; ONE OF 8 BILLION PEOPLE ON THE EARTH.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; YEAH. WHO COULD FIND ONE OUT of eight
[57:33] billion?
[57:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; IF I PILED UP 8 billion anything here,
[57:41] &gt;&gt; I don't even know if it'd fit here.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[57:44] &gt;&gt; and you go pluck one out and tell that
[57:46] one. You're precious to me and I love
[57:48] you and I'm going to tell you all my
[57:49] secrets. and I'm going to draw you to
[57:51] myself and I'm going to I'm going to
[57:52] give you a glorified body and you're
[57:54] going to sit with me in my throne for a
[57:55] thousand years and you're going to be in
[57:57] the new heavens and new earth and you're
[57:58] going to have perfection and you're
[58:00] going to BE PART OF ME. YOU'RE GOING TO
[58:01] BE AN EXPRESSION of me and we're going
[58:03] to come into a unity like nobody's ever
[58:05] seen before and we're GOING TO LIVE
[58:06] TOGETHER FOREVER. OH, WHAT WOULD THAT
[58:08] ONE LITTLE ITEM THAT'S PLUCKED OUT OF 8
[58:10] BILLION FEEL ABOUT THE ONE WHO PLUCKED
[58:12] THEM OUT? YEAH, that's right.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; OH, GOD, HELP US NOT TO BE PROUD AND
[58:17] ARROGANT AND GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE
[58:19] THINK WE DESERVED it or we were owed it
[58:21] or
[58:23] &gt;&gt; I was good enough or he liked me or I
[58:26] had beautiful eyes.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; We had nothing. This was purely based on
[58:31] his love and election,
[58:34] &gt;&gt; not only merit of our own. And it should
[58:36] put inside of us such a tremendous
[58:39] passionate love for him
[58:42] &gt;&gt; that if he ASKED ME TO DROP EVERYTHING
[58:43] and go to the other side of the planet
[58:45] tomorrow, I should be willing to do it
[58:47] though it cost me everything.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's love.
[58:57] And
[58:57] &gt;&gt; I remember years ago when we come to the
[59:00] message, it was quite a tumultuous time
[59:02] for our family, for my wife and I, and
[59:04] lots of up and down and back and forth
[59:06] and confusion and disturbances from
[59:08] outside the family. But yet God draw us
[59:11] through and and and it brought us into
[59:13] such a relationship. We went through a
[59:15] relationship strain because of the
[59:17] unknown and because of the family
[59:19] pressures. But then all of a sudden when
[59:21] God brought us the revelation of the
[59:22] word, it threw us together in a union.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Like we'd never experienced before. And
[59:28] I remember one time after we'd been in
[59:30] the message for a while and God had
[59:32] taught us how to love one another and
[59:34] and taught us how a husband should care
[59:36] for a wife and a wife should reverence
[59:38] her husband. My wife looked at me one
[59:40] time and she said, "I would follow you
[59:43] anywhere on this planet. If you told us
[59:45] tomorrow you're picking up and moving to
[59:46] Alaska, I would go without question.
[59:50] And I just stood there.
[59:52] I don't remember what even the
[59:54] conversation was about.
[59:57] But listen friends, what love is that?
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; What how could somebody how could a
[1:00:04] human being put such love and trust and
[1:00:07] respect into another failed human being?
[1:00:12] And you know what that did to me?
[1:00:15] When she said that to me, all of a
[1:00:17] sudden, I got this sense of
[1:00:19] responsibility
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; that I would never lead that woman
[1:00:22] astray. And if I if I had to give my
[1:00:24] life, I wouldn't hurt her
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; if she'll love me like that.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; And if a wife can have respect and love
[1:00:32] and reverence and trust to an earthly
[1:00:34] husband, what should the bride of
[1:00:35] Christ, how should she trust her
[1:00:37] husband?
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; How should we TRUST HIM? NO MATTER WHAT
[1:00:40] HE SAYS, whether I understand it or
[1:00:42] don't understand it, whether I like it
[1:00:44] or don't like it, whether it feels good
[1:00:45] or don't FEEL GOOD, WHAT DOES THAT
[1:00:47] MATTER, FRIENDS? AMEN. He's been
[1:00:49] everything to me. He's worthy OF MY
[1:00:51] TRUST. HAS HE NOT HE PROVED HIMSELF
[1:00:53] FAITHFUL?
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; HAS NOT IS HE NOT TRUSTWORTHY? HAS NOT
[1:00:56] HE PROVED HOW much he loves us?
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Could we not just say, "God, whatever
[1:01:03] you ask, wherever you go, whatever you
[1:01:05] want, I'll go wherever you go. Amen.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; I'll be wherever you want me to be. I'll
[1:01:10] do whatever you ask me to do. I love you
[1:01:11] that much.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; That's real love.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; And Christ is the revealed in his own
[1:01:22] word. He says God said if a man has
[1:01:24] caught was caught in adultery a woman,
[1:01:27] take them out there and stoned them to
[1:01:28] death. That settled it. He's even caught
[1:01:30] picking up a weight of stick on the
[1:01:32] Sabbath day. Take him out and stone him.
[1:01:34] They lived by it then. And now see, we
[1:01:36] don't have them kind of laws today. But
[1:01:39] the Christian, the church, what I'm
[1:01:40] talking to this morning, the law of God
[1:01:43] is in your heart.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. The law was done away with
[1:01:50] because Jesus Christ fulfilled the law.
[1:01:53] He met every requirement of the law. So,
[1:01:55] we don't have to meet the requirements
[1:01:56] of the law.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean the law was evil.
[1:02:00] Paul says the law was perfect.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; The problem was not the law of God. The
[1:02:04] law of God came from the mind of God. It
[1:02:06] was the way to treat people, way to
[1:02:08] treat your neighbor, way to redeem
[1:02:09] things, way to love God, way to serve,
[1:02:11] Amen, your neighbor, way to live in a
[1:02:13] community. All those things were
[1:02:14] perfect. The wisdom OF GOD, DON'T CALL
[1:02:16] IT BAD. DON'T CALL IT WRONG. Paul called
[1:02:19] it perfect.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; The problem wasn't with the law. The
[1:02:22] problem was with us. We could never live
[1:02:24] it. So, we could never attain to THE
[1:02:25] RIGHTEOUSNESS WE SOUGHT after
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; under the law. So Jesus Christ came and
[1:02:30] fulfilled all the law so that he could
[1:02:32] be the perfect substitute, the lamb
[1:02:34] without spot or blemish. And he took our
[1:02:36] place and stood in ourstead and he died
[1:02:38] on our behalf so that we could go free.
[1:02:41] So now we're not bound to the law to
[1:02:43] keep the ordinance of the law. BUT
[1:02:44] LISTEN, GOD still has wisdom. There's
[1:02:47] still a law OF GOD. THERE'S STILL A
[1:02:49] RIGHT way and there's still a wrong way
[1:02:50] to do things. And that may not be a law
[1:02:52] that we have to obey, amen, to seek
[1:02:54] righteousness from God. BUT IT'S A LAW
[1:02:56] NOW THAT'S in our heart. And the
[1:02:58] obedience is obedience from the heart.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; The law of God is in your heart. See,
[1:03:05] you have no desire to do it. It's inside
[1:03:08] here. You want to keep God's law so
[1:03:10] perfect. No matter what it is, you want
[1:03:13] to be just what if God needs a doormat
[1:03:15] at the door. He wants you to be that
[1:03:17] doormat. You're so happy to be that. No
[1:03:20] matter what it would be, you want to be
[1:03:22] the doormat. See, whatever God wants you
[1:03:25] to do, that's what you want to do cuz
[1:03:27] it's God. Now, that's where you really
[1:03:30] find your real, genuine, true love for
[1:03:33] God.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Is not when I want God to make me
[1:03:37] something.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; When God, I want this position or God, I
[1:03:40] want to do this for you, but when God
[1:03:42] tells you he wants you to do something,
[1:03:44] AND IF IT'S THE DOORMAT AT THE DOOR,
[1:03:46] you're just so happy to be that. Brother
[1:03:48] Benham said, that's where you get the
[1:03:50] real true love of God.
[1:03:53] Amen.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Let's look at John 21 together.
[1:04:00] Gospel of John chapter 21
[1:04:11] and let's begin at verse 15. In John
[1:04:13] 21:15
[1:04:21] it says, "So when they had died, Jesus
[1:04:23] saith to Simon Peter, [snorts]
[1:04:27] Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me more
[1:04:30] than these?"
[1:04:32] He saith unto him, "Yay, Lord, thou
[1:04:34] knowest that I love thee?" He saith unto
[1:04:37] him, "Feed my lambs."
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:40] He saith to him again the second time,"
[1:04:42] Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?' He
[1:04:45] saith unto him, "Yay, Lord, thou knowest
[1:04:46] that I love thee?" He saith unto him,
[1:04:49] "Feed my sheep."
[1:04:51] He saith unto him a third time,"Simon,
[1:04:53] son of Jonas, lovest thou me?" Peter was
[1:04:56] grieved because he said unto him the
[1:04:58] third time, "Lovest thou me?" And he
[1:05:00] said unto him, "Lord, thou knowest all
[1:05:02] things. Thou knowest that I love thee."
[1:05:04] Jesus said unto him, "Feed my sheep."
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:12] Jesus looking at Peter. You know, Peter
[1:05:16] had denied him three times and had
[1:05:18] failed the Lord. And here he comes with
[1:05:20] three opportunities for him to express
[1:05:23] his love to the Lord. Says, "Does thou
[1:05:26] love me?" He says, "Yes, I know." And
[1:05:27] then he says, "Feed my sheep."
[1:05:32] Peter's declaring his love for God.
[1:05:36] Jesus is giving him a commandment.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; And his commandment is love.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; The question is, "Do you love me?" Peter
[1:05:46] says, "Yes." Jesus says, "Feed my
[1:05:49] sheep."
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; So, how will Peter express his love to
[1:05:54] Jesus?
[1:05:55] Not saying, "I love you,"
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; but feeding his sheep.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus is looking for.
[1:06:03] He what's he asking Peter to do? He's
[1:06:06] saying, "Peter, will you serve my
[1:06:08] people? Will you sacrifice yourself?"
[1:06:12] Listen, what he's asking Peter to do is
[1:06:14] not a glorious thing, not an easy thing.
[1:06:16] He's asking him to sacrifice his life.
[1:06:20] Peter had run away because he didn't
[1:06:22] know what to do was after the
[1:06:23] resurrection and there was confusion all
[1:06:26] about and there was some fear of the
[1:06:27] authorities and he went back to fishing
[1:06:29] and this is where Jesus finds him going
[1:06:31] back to familiar ground. Amen. And and
[1:06:33] running out of Jerusalem having no idea
[1:06:35] what next to do. They know Jesus died.
[1:06:37] They know he resurrected. They've seen
[1:06:39] him. Amen. They know it was a
[1:06:41] fulfillment of the word. And here they
[1:06:42] are. Amen. Back fishing again, back in
[1:06:45] familiar territory. And Jesus comes to
[1:06:47] him. Amen. And he and he and he says,
[1:06:50] "Do you love me?" And Peter finally he
[1:06:53] SAYS, "LORD, YOU KNOW ALL THINGS."
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Why are you asking ME THIS? YOU KNOW MY
[1:06:58] HEART. YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW I love you.
[1:07:01] And after THIS OUTBURST OF GOD, YOU'VE
[1:07:03] GOT A GUARANTEE OF MY LOVE. WITH YOUR
[1:07:05] WITH YOUR OMNISCIENCE, YOU KNOW THAT I
[1:07:07] LOVE YOU.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; He says the third time, "Feed my sheep."
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. How did Jesus want Peter to
[1:07:19] express his love?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; By feeding his sheep.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Simple.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Let's keep reading.
[1:07:31] Verse 18. Jesus says, "Verily, verily, I
[1:07:34] say unto thee, when thou was young, thou
[1:07:37] girdst thyself, and walkest wheither
[1:07:38] thou wouldest. But when thou shalt be
[1:07:40] old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands,
[1:07:42] and another shall gird thee, and carry
[1:07:44] thee whether thou wouldest not.
[1:07:46] This spakey signifying by what death he
[1:07:50] should glorify God.
[1:07:54] That was the word of the Lord.
[1:07:58] That was not a pleasant prophecy or
[1:08:02] commandment.
[1:08:04] He didn't say, "I'm going to give you
[1:08:06] some rewards and I'm going to give you a
[1:08:08] comfortable life and I'm going to take
[1:08:09] care of you and your family and you're
[1:08:11] going to have a big church and you're
[1:08:12] going to have all of this." No. He just
[1:08:14] told him, "You're going to sacrifice
[1:08:16] your life for me. I've asked you to
[1:08:19] serve my people, not yourself. Serve my
[1:08:22] sheep." That means, you know, Peter
[1:08:24] didn't know how to do that. Peter didn't
[1:08:26] know how he would do that. He hadn't
[1:08:28] been to Pentecost yet. He hadn't
[1:08:29] received the Holy Ghost. He didn't have
[1:08:30] that overcoming power. He just knows
[1:08:32] Jesus is asking him to go out to do
[1:08:34] something he doesn't know how to do.
[1:08:36] It's overwhelming at this stage in his
[1:08:38] life to go and feed his sheep and feed
[1:08:40] his lambs. But what about the
[1:08:41] authorities? What about the ones who
[1:08:42] arrested you and accused you and our
[1:08:44] life is in danger and we're running for
[1:08:46] our lives? Then you're asking me to feed
[1:08:48] your sheep. Listen, this wasn't a jump
[1:08:50] up and click your heels. Oh boy, guess
[1:08:52] what I get to do kind of a commandment.
[1:08:55] This was a commandment that was going to
[1:08:56] cost Peter his life. And he even even
[1:08:58] sealed it with a prophecy of his
[1:09:00] crucifixion.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; The commandment of the Lord was for
[1:09:05] Peter to give his life. But he said, "If
[1:09:07] you love me, feed my sheep." And this is
[1:09:10] what's going to happen
[1:09:15] in verse and I want to finish verse 19.
[1:09:18] And when he had spoken this, he said
[1:09:21] unto him, follow me.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; That's the same opportunity he gave to
[1:09:25] the rich young ruler.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; He told the rich young ruler, "Sell
[1:09:29] everything you got and give to the poor.
[1:09:31] Take up your cross and follow me." Amen.
[1:09:33] That was to me an easier request than
[1:09:36] what he just told Peter.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Right. I want you to feed my sheep. No
[1:09:40] matter, you don't have any idea how to
[1:09:41] do it. It's a dangerous situation, but
[1:09:43] feed my lambs. Feed my sheep. And you're
[1:09:46] going to give your life for it. You're
[1:09:47] going to be crucified. Now, follow me.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God that Peter made the
[1:09:54] right choice. Peter loved the Lord. He
[1:09:56] truly loved the Lord. How do we know he
[1:09:58] loved the Lord? Because he fed HIS
[1:10:00] SHEEP. HE TOOK THE GOSPEL. AMEN. HE TOOK
[1:10:03] THE KEYS OF THE GOSPEL to the three
[1:10:04] people types of the world. to the Jews,
[1:10:06] to the Samaritans, to the Gentiles, and
[1:10:08] he opened it to them in the face of
[1:10:10] GREAT DANGER. AND HE SACRIFICED HIS
[1:10:12] WHOLE LIFE TO DO IT. AND HE DIED BY
[1:10:14] CRUCIFIXION upside down.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THAT? THAT WAS PETER'S LOVE FOR
[1:10:19] THE LORD. AMEN. THERE WAS NO QUESTION
[1:10:21] WHETHER GOD LOVED HIM OR NOT. JESUS
[1:10:23] WASN'T SAYING, "DO you think I love you,
[1:10:25] Peter? Are you sure I love you? Do you
[1:10:26] have any questions about my love for
[1:10:28] you?" THAT WAS UNQUESTIONABLE. THE
[1:10:30] QUESTION WAS, "PETER, DO YOU LOVE ME?
[1:10:32] ARE YOU WILLING TO KEEP MY COMMANDMENT?
[1:10:34] ARE YOU WILLING TO SACRIFICE YOURSELF?
[1:10:36] ARE YOU WILLING TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE?
[1:10:37] ARE YOU WILLING TO DO WHAT I ASK AND GO
[1:10:39] FEED my sheep?
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Even if it cost you your life.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad that Peter followed him.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; We're here today because Peter followed
[1:10:49] him.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Verse 20. Then Peter turned about seeth
[1:10:55] the disciple whom Jesus loved following
[1:10:58] which also leaned on his breast at
[1:11:00] supper and said, "Lord, which is he that
[1:11:02] betrayeth you?" We know this is John.
[1:11:05] Peter's seeing him say saith to Jesus,
[1:11:06] "Lord, and what shall this man do?"
[1:11:10] Listen, Peter is [laughter]
[1:11:13] Peter just got a pretty difficult
[1:11:15] commandment.
[1:11:18] And he looks around, he looks at John,
[1:11:19] and John's always been the favorite.
[1:11:22] What What has he got to do?
[1:11:28] Jesus saith to him, "If I will that he
[1:11:30] tar till I come." What is that to thee?
[1:11:33] Follow thou me.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; What if he gets nothing but blessings?
[1:11:40] What if his life is easy? What if he
[1:11:42] tries till I come? What does that have
[1:11:43] to do with you? I asked you if you love
[1:11:46] me.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; This has nothing to do with any other
[1:11:49] human being. This has to do with just
[1:11:51] you and I, Peter. I'm asking if you love
[1:11:53] me. It has my love, MY RELATIONSHIP WITH
[1:11:55] JOHN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY
[1:11:56] relationship with you.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; WHAT IF I GIVE HIM NOTHING BUT BLESSINGS
[1:12:00] and he tries? till I come and his life
[1:12:02] is easy and there's no crucifixion. AND
[1:12:04] WE KNOW JOHN'S LIFE WASN'T EASY. God was
[1:12:06] going to require of him imprisonment ON
[1:12:08] PATMAS
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; BOILING ALIVE IN oil and the oil
[1:12:12] couldn't burn him persecution and
[1:12:14] imprisonment and all kinds of hardship
[1:12:16] IN HIS LIFE. BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER.
[1:12:18] AMEN. Jesus was asking Peter, "Do you
[1:12:21] love me regardless of what I do for
[1:12:23] anybody ELSE OR REQUIRE OF ANYBODY ELSE?
[1:12:25] CAN I REQUIRE more of you than anybody
[1:12:27] else? And do you love me enough to give
[1:12:29] it to me? Amen.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; WHAT IF EVERYBODY ELSE HAS AN EASY LIFE,
[1:12:33] BUT GOD ASKED YOU TO HAVE A HARD LIFE?
[1:12:34] WHAT are you going to do?
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; WHAT IF HE ASKED YOU TO SACRIFICE? WHAT
[1:12:38] IF HE ASKED YOU TO EXPERIENCE
[1:12:40] LONELINESS? WHAT IF HE ASKED YOU TO
[1:12:42] EXPERIENCE LOSS in your family and keep
[1:12:44] believing and keep serving? WHAT IF HE
[1:12:45] ASKED YOU TO GIVE UP YOUR JOB? WHAT IF
[1:12:47] HE ASKED YOU TO MOVE AWAY? WHAT IF HE
[1:12:49] ASKED YOU TO KEEP believing when your
[1:12:50] family doesn't believe? WHAT IF HE ASKED
[1:12:52] YOU TO STAND true when YOUR SPOUSE
[1:12:53] LEAVES, BUT NOBODY ELSE HAS TO? Their
[1:12:55] spouse CAN STAY. ALL THEIR children can
[1:12:56] believe. They can have an easy life.
[1:12:58] What will you say?
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER GOD LOVES
[1:13:03] YOU AND I OR NOT. THE QUESTION IS, DO WE
[1:13:04] LOVE HIM?
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; GOD, help me to love you more.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Love him with all my heart. I got to
[1:13:15] slay this flesh of mine.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; To stay in his love.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Brother says, "Grace is what God did for
[1:13:24] me.
[1:13:25] Works is what I do for God." Amen.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Now, they'll make a doctrine out of it.
[1:13:29] They'll think that works is what wins
[1:13:31] your merits. If it is, it isn't a free
[1:13:33] gift. Grace is what God did for you. By
[1:13:35] grace, you're saved. And works is what
[1:13:37] you do in appreciation of the grace that
[1:13:39] he showed to you. And if you love him,
[1:13:42] you like to do the works of the Lord.
[1:13:44] Certainly, because then you love him.
[1:13:48] Accepting me to as my wife was what love
[1:13:51] done for her. what she does in
[1:13:53] appreciation. She's a nice woman, stays
[1:13:56] home, takes care of the children, and
[1:13:57] lives a good, true life. That's not
[1:13:59] because we're not married. We are
[1:14:00] married, but she does that in
[1:14:02] appreciations. If she run downtown every
[1:14:05] day and took in every 10- cent store and
[1:14:07] up and down the streets and never washed
[1:14:09] the dishes or anything else, we are
[1:14:11] still married. Absolutely. When I took
[1:14:14] my vow, that settles it. She's my wife.
[1:14:16] As long as there's life in us, she's my
[1:14:18] wife. That's her vow. But what
[1:14:20] appreciation she does for that. She
[1:14:22] stays home and takes care of the
[1:14:24] children and tries to be a real wife. I
[1:14:27] could run out and be gone all the time
[1:14:28] just gatting about over the country and
[1:14:30] let her have starve or anything. Let the
[1:14:32] children go without something to eat.
[1:14:34] We're still married. If she even
[1:14:36] divorces me, I'm still married long as
[1:14:37] there's life in my body. I took that vow
[1:14:40] till death we separate. That's right.
[1:14:42] We're still married. But yet I make a
[1:14:44] poor excuse of a husband. She'd make a
[1:14:47] poor excuse as a wife. So if we love one
[1:14:49] another, we stick together and pull the
[1:14:51] load together. That's the way God in his
[1:14:54] church is when you're born in the
[1:14:55] kingdom of God.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. God doesn't throw us away just
[1:15:00] because we're being a lousy wife.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; He made a promise. He made a commitment.
[1:15:06] He put our name on the book before the
[1:15:08] foundation of the world. Amen. Brother
[1:15:10] Ben said she'd be make a poor excuse as
[1:15:12] a wife. He'd make a poor excuse as a
[1:15:14] husband. We can be a poor excuse as the
[1:15:16] BRIDE OF CHRIST. HE'S STILL NOT casting
[1:15:18] us away.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; THAT'S HIS PROMISE. THAT'S HIS VOW.
[1:15:23] THAT'S HIS WORD. IT'S NOT GOING TO
[1:15:25] CHANGE. BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE a sorry
[1:15:27] excuse for a wife. I don't want TO BE A
[1:15:29] SORRY EXCUSE for his child. Amen. I WANT
[1:15:31] TO SHOW HIM THAT I LOVE him and I want
[1:15:33] to give him love.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; And I want to abide in his love. I want
[1:15:38] to keep his commandments. Jesus said,
[1:15:40] "If you love me, keep my commandments."
[1:15:42] Then I WANT TO SHOW HIM THAT I LOVE HIM.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He asked Peter, "Do you love me?"
[1:15:48] Peter says, "Yes." Jesus didn't leave it
[1:15:51] with yes.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; He said, ' Then feed my sheep.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Now, Peter can show his love for Jesus
[1:15:59] by feeding his sheep.
[1:16:04] I don't want to just come and sing a
[1:16:06] song. Oh, I love you. I love you. I love
[1:16:08] you. And go out and live any way I want
[1:16:10] to live and be a sorry excuse for a
[1:16:11] bride.
[1:16:14] It's easy to sing the song, but I want
[1:16:16] to come and show him that I love him and
[1:16:18] I want to sacrifice for him. Not because
[1:16:20] I have to. Not because I have to or I'll
[1:16:24] be lost or I have to so I'll be saved.
[1:16:26] Because I want to because of all that
[1:16:28] he's done for me. I want to please him
[1:16:30] and I want to honor him and I want to
[1:16:32] show him my respect to him.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; I want to keep his word. I want to obey
[1:16:36] the voice for this generation. I want to
[1:16:39] surrender to his will and to his word. I
[1:16:41] want him to know that I love him. And
[1:16:44] when Peter went out feeding his sheep,
[1:16:46] he knew he was doing what God had asked
[1:16:48] him to do. And he was showing his love
[1:16:51] for his savior. Amen.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4:1-7 says,
[1:17:01] "Furthermore, we beseech you, brethren,
[1:17:03] and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that
[1:17:06] as you have received of us, how you
[1:17:07] ought to walk to please God, so you
[1:17:10] would abound more and more. For you know
[1:17:11] what commandments we gave you by the
[1:17:13] Lord Jesus. For this is the will of God,
[1:17:16] even your sanctification, that you
[1:17:18] should abstain from fornication, that
[1:17:20] every one of you should know how to
[1:17:21] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[1:17:23] honor, not in the lust of concupitions,
[1:17:26] even as the Gentiles, which know not
[1:17:28] God, that no man go beyond and defraud
[1:17:30] his brother in any matter, because that
[1:17:31] the Lord is the avenger of all such as
[1:17:33] we also have forewarned you and testify.
[1:17:36] For God hath not called us untoan
[1:17:39] uncleanness, but unto holiness. Amen.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; God has called us to holiness, friends.
[1:17:45] [snorts]
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; God and when we look at holiness, Amen.
[1:17:48] I'm going to skip ahead here just a
[1:17:50] little bit and skip over something. But
[1:17:52] when we look at Leviticus 20, he says,
[1:17:54] "Sanctify yourselves to therefore and be
[1:17:57] you holy for I am the Lord your God."
[1:18:00] He's looking at his children. He says,
[1:18:01] "Be holy." And this word holy means
[1:18:04] sacred, holy, a holy one, a saint set
[1:18:07] apart. Listen, there's a part of
[1:18:09] holiness we cannot do for ourselves.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; We have no holiness.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "It's not the holy
[1:18:15] church. It's the holy God in the
[1:18:17] church."
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the Holy Ghost in us. Amen.
[1:18:21] There's a certain holy We can't We have
[1:18:23] no holiness of our own. We cannot be
[1:18:26] holy. We cannot give ourselves holy. We
[1:18:28] cannot make ourselves holy. That's
[1:18:30] something God has to do.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; He has to do it by a sanctifying power
[1:18:35] of his blood. He washes us and frees us
[1:18:37] and sets us aside for service and fills
[1:18:40] us by his Holy Ghost and he makes us
[1:18:42] holy. But there is a part of holiness we
[1:18:45] can do. We can't make ourselves holy,
[1:18:49] but we can stay in holiness.
[1:18:52] I'll show you. See this word set apart.
[1:18:58] God will choose us. God will call us.
[1:19:00] God will fill us. And he'll set us
[1:19:02] apart. But he never takes away free
[1:19:05] moral agency. The question is, will we
[1:19:07] stay set apart
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; or will we choose the world?
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; We can stay in his holiness.
[1:19:16] Let's look at first Peter together.
[1:19:18] Let's read this scripture together.
[1:19:22] 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 13.
[1:19:29] 1 Peter 1 and13.
[1:19:40] Wherefore g up the loins of your mind
[1:19:42] and be sober and hope to the end for the
[1:19:44] grace that is to be brought unto you at
[1:19:46] the revelation of Jesus Christ. As
[1:19:49] obedient children, not fashioning
[1:19:51] yourselves according to the former lust
[1:19:52] and your ignorance. But as he which hath
[1:19:55] called you is holy, so be ye holy in all
[1:19:59] manner of conversation. That word
[1:20:01] conversation means manner of life.
[1:20:04] He's he's telling us to be holy.
[1:20:07] We can't make ourselves holy. He has to
[1:20:10] make us holy. Brother B's clear on this.
[1:20:12] But he's telling us to be holy. That
[1:20:15] means stay separated and set apart and
[1:20:18] consecrated for him.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Listen, my wife is holy unto me and I'm
[1:20:23] holy unto her.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I am completely set apart
[1:20:28] from every other female on this planet.
[1:20:30] only for her and she is completely set
[1:20:32] apart for me. She is holy unto me and I
[1:20:35] am holy unto her and I want to be holy
[1:20:37] unto the Lord
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; and I want he's holy and he's told me TO
[1:20:42] BE HOLY NOT MAKE MYSELF holy he has to
[1:20:45] make myself holy but I can stay in
[1:20:48] holiness
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; meaning separated unto him
[1:20:54] let's read that again verse 15 but as he
[1:20:56] which hath called you is holy so be ye
[1:20:58] holy in all manner of conversation
[1:21:00] manner of life because it is written and
[1:21:03] be holy for I am holy. Why do I need to
[1:21:07] be holy? Because he's holy.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Because I'm a reflection of him. I'm
[1:21:12] here to reflect him on the earth. And
[1:21:14] he's holy. So he's called me to be holy.
[1:21:17] What is he? HE'S SET APART from anything
[1:21:19] filthy, from anything wicked, from
[1:21:21] anything that's of the devil, from
[1:21:23] anything that's contrary to the word.
[1:21:24] HE'S SET APART. And because I'm his
[1:21:26] reflection on the earth, he says because
[1:21:28] I'm holy, you be holy. You stay
[1:21:31] separated, too. because you're my
[1:21:32] reflection.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; And we stay separated unto him.
[1:21:39] Be ye holy, for I am holy. And if you
[1:21:42] call on the Father, who without respect
[1:21:44] to persons judgeth according to every
[1:21:45] man's work, pass the time of your
[1:21:47] sojouring here in fear. For as much as
[1:21:50] you know that you were not redeemed with
[1:21:51] corruptible things, as silver and gold
[1:21:53] from your vain conversation, received by
[1:21:56] the tradition from your fathers, but
[1:21:58] with the precious blood of Christ, as of
[1:21:59] a lamb without blemish and without spot,
[1:22:02] who verily was for ordained before the
[1:22:04] foundation of the world, but was
[1:22:05] manifest in the last times for you. Why
[1:22:09] are we holy? Why are we set aside?
[1:22:11] Because we weren't redeemed with trivial
[1:22:13] things of silver and gold, but by the
[1:22:15] precious blood of Jesus Christ who
[1:22:16] purchased us. And he made us holy. And I
[1:22:19] want to stay separated for him.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; I want to stay in a loving relationship
[1:22:26] with him.
[1:22:28] Hebrews 12:14 says, "Following peace
[1:22:30] with all men and holiness without which
[1:22:34] no man shall see the Lord."
[1:22:39] This word holiness is this word that
[1:22:41] means consecrated.
[1:22:43] Consecration, purification,
[1:22:45] sanctification of heart and life.
[1:22:47] Listen, God has to make us pure.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; We can't make us pure, but it's the
[1:22:52] blood of Jesus Christ that makes us
[1:22:54] pure. We can't make ourselves pure, but
[1:22:56] once he's made us pure, we can stay in
[1:22:58] his purity.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; This word hagiosmos comes from a word 37
[1:23:05] in the concordance. And if I pull up
[1:23:07] that word, Amen. This word uh it means
[1:23:11] to be holy, to render acknowledge or to
[1:23:14] be venerable or hallow. That's what God
[1:23:17] did when he chose us and he filled us
[1:23:19] with his spirit. He hallowed us. He made
[1:23:21] us holy.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; But then this one says to separate from
[1:23:25] profane profane things and dedicate to
[1:23:27] God to consecrate. That's what he's
[1:23:30] asking us to do when he says be you holy
[1:23:32] like I'm holy. He's asking us to
[1:23:33] separate from everything else and deb
[1:23:36] dedicated to God.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; So holiness is something God he makes us
[1:23:41] holy. We don't make ourselves holy, but
[1:23:43] we are commanded by the word to be holy
[1:23:46] and to walk in holiness.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Holiness is a doctrine of the church.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Holiness is the truth. Amen. Holiness is
[1:23:54] not legalism. Holiness is separation and
[1:23:57] consecration to God alone.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; That this body, my life, my mind, my
[1:24:03] eyes, my mouth, my hands, they are
[1:24:05] separated for God only. They are
[1:24:07] rendered holy for his use only. Amen.
[1:24:09] They're not for the world. They're not
[1:24:11] for the things of the world. They're not
[1:24:12] for the things of the enemy.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; But I'm consecrated to God and I'm to be
[1:24:18] holy unto him. Why? Because I'm his
[1:24:21] wife. Because he loves me.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. When brother talked about his
[1:24:25] wife, he talked about me. Ma, you know,
[1:24:28] I've accepted her, chose her. We're
[1:24:30] bound by love till death do his part.
[1:24:32] So, she wasn't serving brother Brandham
[1:24:35] and serving the home because she had to
[1:24:37] to stay married. She was going to stay
[1:24:38] married anyways, but she wanted to out
[1:24:40] of appreciation, love, and respect for
[1:24:42] her husband.
[1:24:44] And he wanted to be a good husband to
[1:24:46] her because he loved her. And they were
[1:24:48] serving one another.
[1:24:51] I want to be a good wife to Jesus
[1:24:54] Christ.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; In appreciation of all he's done for me.
[1:24:58] I don't want to serve myself. I want to
[1:24:59] serve him. Amen.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; 1 John 3 1:3 says, "Behold, what manner
[1:25:05] of love the Father has bestowed upon us
[1:25:08] that we should be called the sons of
[1:25:09] God." Friends, I'm going to stop right
[1:25:12] there.
[1:25:15] That statement alone should produce
[1:25:17] something inside of us.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; What manner of love the father's
[1:25:23] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:25:25] called the sons of God.
[1:25:28] What should that do to us?
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; What should the revelation of that
[1:25:33] produce in us?
[1:25:35] What manner of love the father has
[1:25:37] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:25:39] called the sons of God. Therefore, the
[1:25:42] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[1:25:44] not. Beloved, now are we the sons of
[1:25:46] God. And it does not yet appear what we
[1:25:48] shall be, but we know that when he shall
[1:25:51] appear, we shall be like him, for we
[1:25:53] shall see him as he is. And every man
[1:25:56] that hath this hope in him purifieth
[1:25:59] himself even as he is pure.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; We are called to walk in holiness. We're
[1:26:05] called to be holy. We're called to love
[1:26:07] the Lord and keep his commandments.
[1:26:09] We're we're we're called to purify
[1:26:12] ourselves.
[1:26:14] We can't purify ourselves in the way
[1:26:16] Jesus purify ourselves. But we can stay
[1:26:17] separated from the things of the world.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I have to. No, we've
[1:26:23] already established that because I want
[1:26:26] to.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Not because I'm trying to find favor.
[1:26:30] I've already found favor. I have I'm a
[1:26:32] recipient of his grace.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Not so I can be redeemed. I'm already
[1:26:36] redeemed. I was redeemed before the
[1:26:38] foundation of the world. But oh, what
[1:26:41] gratitude should be in my heart.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; What appreciation for his love. What
[1:26:46] appreciation for his mercy. What love we
[1:26:48] should have together, him and I.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:55] 2 Corinthians 7:1,
[1:26:57] "Having therefore these promises, dearly
[1:27:00] beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from
[1:27:02] all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,
[1:27:05] perfecting holiness and the fear of
[1:27:08] God." That perfecting means to bring to
[1:27:10] completion.
[1:27:12] This is what Paul's telling us to do.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; There's a part that we can't do. God has
[1:27:17] to do it for us. But he there's a
[1:27:19] commandment for us to walk in holiness.
[1:27:21] There's a commandment for us to purify
[1:27:23] ourselves. There's a commandment for us
[1:27:25] to walk in sanctification. There's a
[1:27:27] commandment for us to cleanse ourselves
[1:27:29] from all filthiness of the flesh and
[1:27:31] spirit, perfecting holiness and the fear
[1:27:33] of God. Why? Because we still have free
[1:27:35] moral agency.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; And we still get to choose. Listen, when
[1:27:39] brother Brandon went to work, Ma had
[1:27:42] free moral agency.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; She could choose what she would do with
[1:27:45] her day. He said she could run down to
[1:27:48] all the 10-centent stores. Well, he
[1:27:50] said, "I I something like that. Dollar
[1:27:53] Tree,
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Family Dollar, Dollar General,
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; finding all the deals. Thrift store and
[1:28:00] blah blah blah blah blah."
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Or she could stay there in her post of
[1:28:04] duty and serve her husband and serve her
[1:28:06] children and make a home for him and
[1:28:07] make a nice meal for him and make it
[1:28:09] comfortable for when he comes home. Not
[1:28:10] because he's going to divorce her, but
[1:28:12] because she loves him and she
[1:28:13] appreciates him and she sanctifies
[1:28:15] herself to him. Amen.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; She makes herself holy unto him.
[1:28:20] Oh, that's the way I want to serve the
[1:28:22] Lord. I can run around. I can do some
[1:28:24] things. I can get away from with stuff.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; He loves me. He's not going to throw me
[1:28:31] away. I I by faith I believe that I'm
[1:28:34] one of his. He's not going to dump me in
[1:28:35] the trash can, friends. But his
[1:28:37] commandment is his love to me.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; And it's not grievious. Neither is it
[1:28:42] bondage.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; The commandment he gives. Listen, when
[1:28:47] through a prophet in this age, he tells
[1:28:50] us about watching TV and Hollywood
[1:28:54] movies and he tells about the fashions
[1:28:56] of the world and he talks about smoking
[1:28:57] and drinking and all of these things.
[1:28:59] Listen, brother Ben's not coming and
[1:29:02] telling us, you know what, if you watch
[1:29:04] a movie, you're going to go to hell.
[1:29:05] He's telling us that's the trappings of
[1:29:08] Leodysia. That's bondage. The love of
[1:29:11] God will tell you, stay, keep your head
[1:29:13] out of them televisions. And he said,
[1:29:15] "Stay out of that Hollywood this and
[1:29:17] don't go to this and don't do that and
[1:29:18] don't be partakers of that." WHAT IS
[1:29:20] THAT? THAT'S THE LOVE OF GOD EXPRESSED
[1:29:22] TO YOU AND I.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; IF IT FEELS LIKE BONDAGE, WE NEED TO
[1:29:26] CHECK UP ON OURSELVES AND FIND OUT WHO
[1:29:28] GOD IS and who this messenger is and who
[1:29:30] the voice is and who's speaking to us in
[1:29:32] this age and what he's trying TO TELL
[1:29:35] US. SELL ALL YOU HAVE. GIVE TO THE POOR.
[1:29:38] TAKE UP YOUR CROSS AND FOLLOW ME. THAT
[1:29:40] SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE THAT MAN SAD. THAT
[1:29:42] SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE HAPPIEST THING HE
[1:29:44] EVER HEARD. YOU MEAN THERE'S SOMETHING I
[1:29:46] CAN DO? YOU MEAN I'M ALLOWED TO? YOU
[1:29:48] MEAN I CAN FOLLOW YOU? YOU MEAN YOU WANT
[1:29:50] ME?
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GIVE UP TEMPORAL
[1:29:53] THINGS AND NATURAL things and the THING
[1:29:55] THAT'S BINDING MY SOUL. AND IF I CAN GET
[1:29:58] RID OF THAT, YOU'RE INVITING ME TO
[1:30:00] FOLLOW YOU IN ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Easy choice, friends.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; THROW AWAY THE MONEY AS FAST AS YOU CAN.
[1:30:11] GIVE IT TO THE POOR AS QUICKLY AS YOU
[1:30:12] CAN AND TAKE UP THAT cross and follow
[1:30:14] him.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET DIDN'T COME ALONG AND GOD
[1:30:18] HASN'T CAUSED HIM TO COME AND PREACH
[1:30:20] HARD MESSAGES UH CRYING OUT AGAINST SIN,
[1:30:22] CRYING OUT AGAINST THE FASHIONS OF THE
[1:30:24] WORLD and the way we dress. Listen,
[1:30:26] THOSE THINGS ARE BONDAGE. FASHION BRINGS
[1:30:29] SPIRITS,
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; REAL SPIRITS, HOMOSEXUAL SPIRITS,
[1:30:33] LUSTFUL SPIRITS. AND if you're if you're
[1:30:35] surfing THE INTERNET, LOOKING ALL OVER
[1:30:37] THE PLACE FOR the latest fashion, the
[1:30:38] latest this, listen, YOU'RE OPENING
[1:30:40] YOURSELF UP TO SPIRITS,
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; PLAYING AROUND WITH ENTERTAINMENTS, AND
[1:30:44] FINDING the latest this AND THE LATEST
[1:30:46] THAT. LISTEN, THE PROPHET TOLD US TO
[1:30:48] STAY AWAY FROM THOSE THINGS. WHY WAS IT
[1:30:51] BONDAGE? ABSOLUTELY NOT. IT'S FREEDOM,
[1:30:54] FRIENDS.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Forget Hollywood. Forget the things of
[1:30:58] the world. forget what everybody else is
[1:31:01] saying and separate holy unto the Lord.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Look at this word and let it guide us
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; like a marriage.
[1:31:11] Brother Brandham could go he could go to
[1:31:13] Shreport. His wife could stay home.
[1:31:16] [snorts]
[1:31:17] He's not worried about what she's going
[1:31:18] to do
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; because he loves her. She loves him.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; She's not worried about being put away
[1:31:25] when he gets back if she didn't do a
[1:31:28] good job. She didn't measure up and she
[1:31:29] didn't get the house just right and the
[1:31:31] clothes just right and she didn't make
[1:31:32] sure the kids did all that they were
[1:31:34] supposed to do and she didn't get her
[1:31:35] checklist right and so she's nervous
[1:31:38] when brother Bam's coming home she's all
[1:31:39] upset worried I don't know if I'll be
[1:31:41] accepted she was already accepted
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; she did that because she loved him
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; that's the kind of relationship I want
[1:31:51] with the Lord
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; you know in a home we can have a
[1:31:56] relationship that's based on all kinds
[1:31:58] of other things, but the relationship
[1:32:01] should be just between a man and a woman
[1:32:03] and that should be the primary
[1:32:04] relationship and everything else should
[1:32:06] be secondary.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard of emptiness
[1:32:09] syndrome?
[1:32:11] When couples divorce after they get an
[1:32:14] empty house,
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; when the kids grow up and the kids move
[1:32:16] out, it's called emptiness nest
[1:32:18] syndrome. And they find out that when
[1:32:21] the kids move up and go to co go to
[1:32:22] college, get married and moved out and
[1:32:24] they're just there with each other. They
[1:32:26] find out that they have no relationship
[1:32:28] between the two of them.
[1:32:30] The basis for their love was a link
[1:32:32] between the children. And they both love
[1:32:35] the children. Because they love the
[1:32:36] children, it kept them bound. But when
[1:32:38] the children leave, they have no
[1:32:40] relationship. They have no love for one
[1:32:41] another. And although it looked like a
[1:32:43] good house and a good family and a good
[1:32:44] relationship and a good marriage, Amen.
[1:32:46] People are shocked sometimes that and
[1:32:48] the empty nest syndrome hits the most
[1:32:50] unlikely people. They look like a good
[1:32:51] family. They look like everything was
[1:32:53] going right. They look like they had it
[1:32:55] all together.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; But the basis for the relationship was
[1:32:58] not just the two of them. The basis for
[1:33:00] relationship was for the love for the
[1:33:02] children, the desire to raise them.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Listen, that can happen to us in
[1:33:06] Christianity.
[1:33:08] It can get to the place where the basis
[1:33:10] of our relationship with God is through
[1:33:12] somebody else,
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; through a spouse or through a church or
[1:33:16] through a preacher or through something
[1:33:17] else.
[1:33:19] And then we find out that when that
[1:33:21] preacher lets me down or when that
[1:33:22] church fails or when that spouse leaves
[1:33:24] or when something goes wrong, all of a
[1:33:26] sudden I'm in a crisis with faith of
[1:33:28] God. I have no relationship with God
[1:33:29] because my link to God was through the
[1:33:31] church.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; My link to God was through the preacher.
[1:33:34] The link to God was through a family
[1:33:35] member, through mom or dad or through my
[1:33:37] wife or through my husband. But I didn't
[1:33:39] have that relationship with him myself.
[1:33:41] Amen. And many times God will let
[1:33:43] something else get wrecked. He'll let
[1:33:45] somebody disappoint you. HE'LL LET THE
[1:33:47] CHURCH FAIL. He'll let your ministry
[1:33:48] fail. HE'LL LET YOUR SPOUSE FAIL. AMEN.
[1:33:51] SO THAT YOU HAVE TO COME back in contact
[1:33:53] with the relationship that matters. So
[1:33:55] you're NOT RELATED TO GOD AND LOVING GOD
[1:33:57] BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIS PEOPLE, because you
[1:33:59] love the ministry, because you love the
[1:34:01] preaching, BUT BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM.
[1:34:04] YOU AND HIM FIRST. YOU AND HIM ALWAYS.
[1:34:06] YOU AND HIM LAST.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE, IT'S YOU AND HIM.
[1:34:10] AFTER EVERYBODY ELSE LEAVES, IT'S YOU
[1:34:12] and him.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; That's the way it should be with us and
[1:34:16] our spouses. Friends, we shouldn't put
[1:34:18] the kids first.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; It should be husband and wife first. You
[1:34:23] started together, you're going to finish
[1:34:25] together. The kids will come and the
[1:34:27] kids will go. You should stay in love
[1:34:29] with one another.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. The same thing WITH JESUS CHRIST.
[1:34:33] AMEN. I STARTED LOVING him because he
[1:34:35] reached out his hand to me. He redeemed
[1:34:37] ME OUT OF A PILE OF a mess. Amen. And he
[1:34:40] BROUGHT ME TO HIMSELF. AMEN. AND NO
[1:34:42] matter how many people I come in contact
[1:34:44] with and how much church members and
[1:34:45] friends and ministry and ALL KINDS OF
[1:34:47] STUFF. AMEN. I'M NOT GOING TO BASE MY
[1:34:50] relationship on HIM BY ANYBODY ELSE. BUT
[1:34:52] the one I started with is the one I'm
[1:34:54] going to walk with all THE WAY THROUGH.
[1:34:55] AND IT'S THE ONE I'M GOING TO FINISH
[1:34:57] WITH. CUZ WHEN I'm laying there taking
[1:34:58] my LAST BREATH, AMEN, IT'S NOT GOING TO
[1:35:00] BE THE CHURCH. IT'S not going to be
[1:35:02] anybody else. It's going to be me and
[1:35:03] God. AND WHEN I CROSS OVER, IT'S NOT
[1:35:05] GOING TO BE HOLDING ANYBODY else's hand.
[1:35:07] It's going to be me and him.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP I WANT MORE than
[1:35:12] anything else. And I love him because he
[1:35:15] first loved me and his commandments are
[1:35:17] not grievious to me. If he through a
[1:35:19] prophet said, "STAY AWAY FROM THAT." MY
[1:35:21] HEART SAYS I WANT TO stay away from
[1:35:23] that. Amen.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; And if there's SOMETHING IN THIS OLD
[1:35:26] COCKER BURNER NATURE OF ME THAT'S
[1:35:27] GETTING PULLED, AMEN, to Hollywood, TO
[1:35:29] MOVIES, TO FASHION THESE THINGS, I'M
[1:35:30] GOING TO SAY, GOD, AMEN, YOUR PROPHET
[1:35:33] TAUGHT US TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT. AND I
[1:35:35] believe that he was your voice FOR THAT
[1:35:36] DAY AND I DON'T WANT IT. GOD, COME AND
[1:35:39] TAKE THE DESIRE OUT OF ME BECAUSE I WANT
[1:35:41] NOTHING but you and I want to love you
[1:35:44] AND I WANT TO SHOW you that I love you.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE LIP SERVICE
[1:35:49] ON SUNDAY AND WEDNESDAY AND SING THE
[1:35:51] SONG AND GO AROUND AND VIOLATE ALL OF
[1:35:53] YOUR COMMANDMENTS THE REST OF THE WEEK
[1:35:54] and trample over everything you DESIRE
[1:35:56] OF ME. BUT I WANT TO LOVE YOU IN MY
[1:35:58] PRIVATE LIFE. I WANT TO LOVE YOU WHEN
[1:36:00] NOBODY'S LOOKING. I WANT TO LOVE YOU IN
[1:36:02] MY THOUGHT LIFE. I WANT TO LOVE YOU
[1:36:04] EVERY DAY, EVERYWHERE, UNDER EVERY
[1:36:06] CIRCUMSTANCE.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; CUZ IF YOU JUST LOVE HIM AT CHURCH AND
[1:36:11] YOU JUST LOVE HIM WITH you're with
[1:36:12] believers, BUT WHEN YOU GET OUTSIDE OF
[1:36:14] BELIEVERS, YOU CHANGE THE WAY YOU ACT.
[1:36:16] YOU CHANGE THE way you dress. YOU CHANGE
[1:36:18] the things you look at. You change the
[1:36:20] things you do, then your relationship to
[1:36:23] him is based on somebody else.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; But if you're all alone and nobody sees
[1:36:31] you,
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; do you still do what he asks you to do
[1:36:34] in this agemen
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; when it's just you and him?
[1:36:41] Do you still want to be holy?
[1:36:45] sanctified, purified to the word that's
[1:36:49] been given to us in this day.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; That word is our bridegroom, friends.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the thoughts of a man or the
[1:36:55] ideas of a man. That's our bridegroom
[1:36:58] speaking to us.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; All I want to do is love him. [snorts]
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; I want myself to be abased in him to be
[1:37:09] exalted.
[1:37:11] I want to sacrifice for him.
[1:37:14] If he said, "Feed my lambs," I want to
[1:37:16] feed the lambs.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; If he said, "Sell what you have good to
[1:37:20] the poor." I want to sell what I have. I
[1:37:23] truly with all my heart want to put him
[1:37:26] first.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; I find so many times that I've failed.
[1:37:30] And I find still so many days in which I
[1:37:33] still let some old desire creep up and
[1:37:35] trump what I know is right. And I find
[1:37:38] that I served myself and I didn't serve
[1:37:42] him. And I hate it every time I do it.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. In my relationship with my
[1:37:49] wife, I do the same thing. There's times
[1:37:50] I want to I want to put her first in
[1:37:52] everything. And I find myself I put my
[1:37:53] first myself first this time. And when
[1:37:56] it happens, I hate it.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way it should be. We
[1:38:00] should hate ourselves for it. I hate
[1:38:02] that we did that, but I want to put
[1:38:03] myself first for him.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Not that we've reached perfection, but
[1:38:08] oh, we're striving.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. that that holiness will be
[1:38:13] perfected or completed in me
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; when I'm wholly completely set aside for
[1:38:19] him.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; When this vessel, doesn't that sound
[1:38:23] like the second fold of the three-fold
[1:38:25] purpose?
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Preeminence
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; and a people.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; When I can be wholly
[1:38:32] set aside for my Lord,
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; that's my love to [snorts] him.
[1:38:40] And you know what's so beautiful and so
[1:38:42] powerful
[1:38:43] is I don't have to do it.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; I don't have to do it to be saved. I
[1:38:50] don't have to do it to be born again. I
[1:38:52] don't have to do it
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; to be in the lamb's book of life. That's
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; But something in me is responding to his
[1:39:00] love.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; And I have to do it.
[1:39:04] Not because I must in order to get
[1:39:07] something. But something in me is
[1:39:09] responding to his love.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Something in me is reaching back to his
[1:39:13] love [clears throat and cough]
[1:39:15] and saying the commandment's not
[1:39:16] grievious. Holiness is not a scary word
[1:39:19] to me.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Holiness is beautiful.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; It's me being set apart for him.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to do. Let's
[1:39:29] stand together.
[1:39:31] Musicians, if you'll come. Brother
[1:39:33] Josiah, if you'd please make your way
[1:39:34] up.
[1:39:37] Listen, I feel like I've fall short a
[1:39:40] thousand times.
[1:39:43] But you know what?
[1:39:45] I've fallen short at home before. Has
[1:39:48] any of you fallen short to your spouse?
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; You can raise your hand. It's okay. I
[1:39:52] got both up because I've done it
[1:39:54] probably twice today. I don't know.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; But you don't give up. You don't throw
[1:39:59] in the towel. You don't say, "Well, it
[1:40:00] just ain't working. Amen.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; No, you wake up the next morning and
[1:40:04] start serving your spouse again.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; If you got to repent, you repent. If you
[1:40:08] got to make it right, you make it right.
[1:40:10] But you go right back. What compels you
[1:40:13] to keep coming back in repentance? To
[1:40:15] keep coming back and serving, to keep
[1:40:16] surrendering your own ideas and keep
[1:40:18] doing what the other prefers. What is
[1:40:21] that?
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; That's love.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Not that you have to. They're not going
[1:40:26] to leave. They're not going to move out.
[1:40:27] You're not going to lose everything.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; No. But I keep I keep wanting to save
[1:40:32] the last piece of the pie for my wife. I
[1:40:35] keep wanting to make sure we find out
[1:40:37] what she wants to do, not what I want to
[1:40:38] do. And what what's better for her, not
[1:40:40] better. What is that? Does that have to?
[1:40:43] And she wants to make sure that he gets
[1:40:45] to go first and then he gets the best of
[1:40:47] this. And what is that? That's love,
[1:40:49] friends.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Not because we have to, because we want
[1:40:54] to.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when God's asked me to serve
[1:40:57] him, feed his sheep, live for him,
[1:41:00] surrender my life to him, stay away from
[1:41:02] the world, separate only unto him. Oh my
[1:41:05] goodness, everything in me wants to do
[1:41:07] that.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; And when I fail, I'm miserable and I'll
[1:41:10] repent and I'll make it right. But he
[1:41:11] didn't throw me away and I'm not
[1:41:13] throwing him away and I'm not running
[1:41:14] away. I'm not going anywhere because I
[1:41:16] started with him. I'm staying with him.
[1:41:18] We're going to finish with him.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to rise up and say, "God,
[1:41:23] help me
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; one more time." Amen.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord, with all my heart. I'm
[1:41:27] sorry for putting myself first. I'm
[1:41:29] sorry for rejecting your commandment.
[1:41:31] I'm sorry for ignoring what you said.
[1:41:33] But oh God, I love you and give me
[1:41:35] another chance. I want to prove my love
[1:41:37] to you. I want to keep the word.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; I want to obey.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is good, friends.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; God is good. And I'm so thankful I'm
[1:41:47] still alive.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful I'm still here
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; because I messed up. in so many ways and
[1:41:55] done so many things wrong, but I still
[1:41:57] want to do something for him. And if he
[1:41:59] gives me another day, it's another
[1:42:00] chance to show him that I love him.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; When I get up and I talk to him first
[1:42:05] before I talk to anybody else, I'm
[1:42:06] showing him I love him. I mean, when I'm
[1:42:09] honest in my dealings through the day,
[1:42:10] when I do what he's asked me to do, when
[1:42:12] I when I turn my eyes from things I
[1:42:14] shouldn't see, when I surrender myself
[1:42:16] completely to him, I'm showing him that
[1:42:19] I love him.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; And oh, I thank God I'm still alive. And
[1:42:22] every day I'm alive, I want to show him
[1:42:25] that I love him more than anything else.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together and
[1:42:31] pray. Lord Jesus, I'm so thankful, Lord,
[1:42:36] that you have called us in this hour.
[1:42:39] And God, you've not left us in darkness
[1:42:41] about what your desire is. God, it's not
[1:42:44] a mystery to us what you want from your
[1:42:47] bride in this end time. For God, you
[1:42:49] sent a voice in this hour and you laid
[1:42:52] it out. You told us what you like. You
[1:42:55] told us what you don't like. You showed
[1:42:58] us your preferences. You told us what to
[1:43:00] stay away from. You've told us the
[1:43:02] things to look at and the things not to
[1:43:05] look at. You've showed us your word.
[1:43:07] You've unveiled yourself to us. You've
[1:43:09] revealed your great mystery plan to us.
[1:43:12] You've showed us our part in it. And
[1:43:15] God, we love you so much.
[1:43:18] God, I feel like Peter sometimes, Lord,
[1:43:20] you know that I love you.
[1:43:22] But God, you gave him a chance to show
[1:43:24] it, to demonstrate it, to sacrifice
[1:43:27] himself, to feed your sheep. And God,
[1:43:30] you have given us your word in this
[1:43:32] generation like no generation has ever
[1:43:34] had it. You've placed it in our ears and
[1:43:37] in our hands and in our heart. We know
[1:43:40] what you want done. The bride knows what
[1:43:42] you want done with the word. You want it
[1:43:44] to be observed, obeyed, followed.
[1:43:49] And God, we stand like Peter. We failed
[1:43:52] you. We've messed up. We're grieved
[1:43:54] because you're asking us, "Do we love
[1:43:56] you?" But oh, the best thing you ever
[1:43:59] did for him was give him a commandment
[1:44:03] to say, "If you love me, feed my sheep."
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; God, we love you. And we find that we've
[1:44:09] messed up so many times, but we stand in
[1:44:11] such a beautiful place because you have
[1:44:13] given us your word in this generation
[1:44:16] and you've asked us to live it. And oh
[1:44:19] God, I can go tomorrow and I can live
[1:44:21] it. Lord, if you'll give me your your
[1:44:23] strength and your anointing and your
[1:44:25] power, God, I'll exercise whatever
[1:44:27] choice I can to choose your word over
[1:44:29] myself. And I'm going to demonstrate how
[1:44:32] much I love you, Lord, because I get to
[1:44:33] I get the chance in this wicked world,
[1:44:36] in this Satan's Ed, in this blackness of
[1:44:38] darkness. You've allowed me to shine the
[1:44:40] light of your word by taking your word
[1:44:42] and putting it on. God, what a privilege
[1:44:45] we have. We love you. We want to walk in
[1:44:47] your word. Help us, Lord, to walk, Lord,
[1:44:51] like we've never walked before.
[1:44:54] Help us to forsake all the things of the
[1:44:56] world in ourselves and just to love you
[1:44:59] with all of our hearts, Lord. But I pray
[1:45:02] you bless your people as we go from
[1:45:03] here. May we go, Lord, walking with a
[1:45:06] clear vision, love in our hearts, with
[1:45:10] the opportunity
[1:45:12] to put our love into action.
[1:45:15] God bless us along the way. I pray in
[1:45:18] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
