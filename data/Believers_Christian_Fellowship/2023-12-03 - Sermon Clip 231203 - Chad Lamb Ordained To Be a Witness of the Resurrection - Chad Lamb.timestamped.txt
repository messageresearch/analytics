[0:00] what were the disciples looking for they
[0:02] were looking for one qualified to be a
[0:04] witness of this
[0:06] Resurrection they thought in order to
[0:08] witness the resurrection you had to see
[0:10] the ministry in order to witness the
[0:12] resurrection you had to be there you had
[0:13] to hear his voice you had to follow the
[0:15] ministry you had to be there amen when
[0:17] you saw the crucifixion you had to know
[0:19] when he was arrested you had to know the
[0:21] circumstances about amen the stone that
[0:24] was rolled and the seal that was placed
[0:25] and you needed to have firsthand
[0:27] knowledge of all of those things to be a
[0:28] witness and you had to see him after he
[0:31] resurrected and you had to see him in
[0:32] his Corporal body that resurrected and
[0:34] you had to be there during the private
[0:36] conversations when he met his disciples
[0:38] amen and all of a sudden God bypassed
[0:40] all of that to be a witness of the
[0:42] Resurrection you don't need to see with
[0:44] fleshly eyes you don't have to have
[0:46] natural experience and Earthly
[0:47] experience to be a witness amen you have
[0:50] to have an encounter with the Living
[0:51] Word With Jesus Christ to awaken that
[0:54] Eternal part in you that was with him
[0:55] from the beginning to stand in your day
[0:58] to witness of Jesus Christ to witness of
[1:02] the resurrect Paul was a witness of the
[1:04] resurrection of Jesus Christ cuz he met
[1:06] Jesus Christ but he didn't meet them the
[1:08] same way that the disciples met him in
[1:11] the resurrection amen he met him amen
[1:13] when he went back into the pillar of
[1:15] fire form that form that was now in the
[1:17] church amen because he says why
[1:19] persecutest thou me that Pillar of Fire
[1:22] was in the body of Believers and that's
[1:24] how Paul met him he didn't meet any
[1:27] other qualifications but he sure met
[1:29] God's qualific
[1:30] and if that was God's qualification to
[1:32] be a witness of the Resurrection then I
[1:34] stand here as a witness of the
[1:35] Resurrection cuz I've met the same
[1:37] qualification by the grace of God cuz I
[1:40] believe by faith that I was with him
[1:42] before the foundation of the world and
[1:43] he ordained me to come forth in this day
[1:46] and I was going Every Which Way But the
[1:48] right way but in some time he came to me
[1:50] and I met the pillar of fire the same
[1:53] one that that was here with the word the
[1:55] same one that had his picture taken over
[1:57] brother Bam's said the same one that
[1:59] brought the word is still here
[2:00] delivering the word and I come in
[2:02] contact with a living breathing Jesus
[2:07] Christ making me qualified to be a
[2:10] witness of his
[2:12] resurrection amen that's what makes me a
[2:14] witness of this message not because I
[2:16] was in the prayer lines not because I
[2:17] was in the meetings I wasn't born yet I
[2:20] didn't have to be born yet we can all be
[2:22] one born out of season praise God we're
[2:25] never born out of season we were born in
[2:27] season this is our season CU we've been
[2:30] ordained to be Witnesses of his
[2:33] resurrection
