amen he did a very good job God bless you brother God bless you God bless you amen let's all stand that is always so much fun and don't forget I'm Still Holding Out for a 12 baby year I want one per month one year I'm still I we haven't achieved that yet but we're looking forward to it amen amen Let's uh let's turn in our Bibles to Colossians chapter 3 want to say welcome home to brother Emanuel it's good to have you back in the service brother you're always missed when you're not here but I asked brother Emanuel to take the Wednesday night service to give us a little report on the trip and to minister the word and he accepted so Lord willing this Wednesday we'll be hearing from him also remember brother Gabe and his family as they're away brother Gabe's ministering for Nathaniel sias up in Lorraine up near Cleveland and so I'm sure that they're enjoying themselves there they'll be traveling back today so remember them also really enjoyed the update for brother Mike God is so good I was able to speak to him yesterday and he was in good spirits and happy and cheerful and it was just so good to hear his voice and I'm so thankful to God for his Healing Hand amen for his promise so God is good also appreciate the song sister chrisy that was wonderful and very timely amen it encouraged me greatly so God is good Colossians chapter 3 verse one says if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory amen God bless you as you have your seats may the Lord bless us as we look into his word so we see that the Apostle Paul now is encouraging the church he says uh uh if you then be risen with Christ see those things seek those things which were above so we've risen with Christ and seated with with him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus is that correct so that's where we're at that's our position with Christ but it's also our destination it's also should be our Focus right and that's what he's telling the church here in Colossians he said if the if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ to is our life shall appear then shall he also appear with him in glory so this is a great instruction he's telling us don't put our affections here put our affections there amen where we are seated with Christ Jesus because Christ is our life and and I find that that is a constant struggle uh For Me Maybe maybe not for you but it's a constant struggle to struggle against the the the this flesh in this life to keep my affections centered on the things that are right they keep focusing on where my life truly is and what my life really is amen and and so for a subject today I'd like to discuss sacrifice or selfishness um since the last message that brother Benjamin seabolt preached on selfishness I've been going over and over and over and again and and uh and I've just been uh focused on it really I've been focused on it and uh doing a lot of thinking and realizing that that's my biggest problem it may not be yours but it's mine self-focus selfishness self-love self self self self self and it's a constant struggle and it's a constant struggle in Leo deia and and so I wanted to just take a look at it and read some things out of the scriptures and read some things that brother brandham said and see if we can get our Focus realigned I think we constantly need to realign our Focus so let's turn to the Book of Matthew together Matthew 16 and I am going to read a lot of scriptures and I'm going to read several quotes because I want to look at what the Bible says and what the message is showing us on this subject and not just offer my opinion because remember this is my problem too in my opinion probably no good I want the word Matthew 6 16 Matthew 16: 24 then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul Jesus is giving such good instruction such truth if a man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me when he says take up his cross we all know what a cross is used for it's a it's a place of uh execution it's a place where a a victim a guilty victim is nailed Amen to uh uh to be punished and it's a place of death and he says take up your cross and follow me and so that's an instruction for us to take up our cross that means we should have a place where we nail ourselves amen uh a place where this flesh is sacrificed and that we should follow him for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it we find that's the that's where the struggle really comes because it's a struggle for life because we look in nature and all of nature is struggling for life life we see every animal every plant everything around us is struggling for Life struggling for breath struggling to eat struggling to to drink struggling for life just to live to continue life amen they're struggling for it but but Jesus is teaching us something different we're not to struggle for this life but we're to struggle for real life and strive for real life and let this life take care of itself but the problem is that we're stuck here and and and we still find ourselves in that struggle for life and it happens to all of us and it has a way of creeping in and we need to keep it at Bay with the word of God and realize I'm not I don't need to take care of myself I need to give myself to Christ and Christ will take care of me he's promised to provide for me and I'm sure he'll do a better job than I will do and I've got to stop focusing so much on how to make provision for myself and I need to lose myself and find myself in Christ and give all my attention to real life and focus on things that are above not the things on the earth and God will take care of of all of these things but we say that we say it we mean it we believe it amen but the problem is we're stuck in flesh so it's not that we don't believe it it's not that we don't mean it when we say it but but the next time that a bill comes in and there's not enough money in the bank to pay the bill then you'll recognize you're still in flesh and you're still struggling to struggle yes sir amen but thanks be to God he's made a promise let's go to Mark chapter 10 together Mark chapter 10 and verse 21 this is when uh Jesus is having a discussion with the Rich Young Ruler who comes to him and asks what he must do to inherit eternal life and they have these discussion back and forth and finally it comes down to verse 21 and says then Jesus beholding him loved him and sudden him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions this is a this story is a travesty because this man comes to Jesus who is the Prince of Life and this Rich Young Ruler comes to Jesus and asks what must I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus tells him amen and he tells him to keep the Commandments he said I've done that from my youth and Jesus beholding him loves him so the next thing he's going to tell the man is out of a love for him and out of his love for him he says there's one thing that you're lacking sell all that you have and give to the poor take up your cross and follow me and then it says I want to come back down and read it together says take up the cross and follow me verse 22 and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved he asked Jesus what must I do to inherit eternal life Jesus now is giving him the answer there's one thing you're lacking this is it do this and you'll have what you desire he says sell all you have given to the poor take up your cross follow me and all of a sudden the man was sad and the question is why was he sad he was just given the key to eternal life he was just given the ticket to he asked for he asked for eternal life now Jesus was telling them the one thing he lacked if you do this and it and what we realized is this man had the same problem that we all struggle with and fight with this man loved himself more than he loved eternal life right amen right when it comes down to it nuts and bolts that's it friends and that's the problem with self that's the problem with this flesh that's the problem with hybridization that's the problem with this world we live in he wanted eternal life as long as he didn't have to give up anything to have eternal life because he was already able to keep the Commandments he's done it since he was a child so because he was already able to do that for him that was an easy exchange for eternal life when Jesus says honor thy father and the mother you know the Commandments have no uh other God but but God Almighty and all of these things he starts to tell the Commandments and he says I've done that check check check I've got that that was an easy exchange because he was rais raised that way he was raised in that life and he could do that for eternal life but when it really came down to it when he could give up himself his reputation his funds his security his support his promise of food for tomorrow when he could give up all of that which is an absolute denying of self see it wasn't it it it was to give up amen what made him who he was right remember he had a title brother R gave him a title the Rich Young Ruler and he had he had uh because of his position in the community and in the synagogue and his wealth and because of all of this he had a certain title a certain identity and that identity brought him a certain amount of respect and then the finances the economy had brought him a certain amount of security and he wasn't willing to give all of that up for eternal life and he walked away sad and grieved for he had great possessions set your affections on things above he had great possessions but what good were those possessions brother B takes us later in the story and we find out that this same man later in life had wealth had the great economy had Barns and he had to tear down Barns and big Builder bigger Barns and his Harvest was so great great and his barns were so full says Soul take thy rest and Jesus said thou fool th knowest not that tonight thy life shall be taken from thee and we find the man in hell when he lifts up his eyes and he sees Abraham across the chasm and he sees Lazarus the poor beggar man in the bosom of of Abraham and and he asked that he might just dip his finger and cold water and quench the burning of his tongue and me we find that he he he could not give give up self to have real life yes and we find the result of that is this man in Hell lifting up his eyes and seeing Lazarus who had nothing now has everything amen so the man was sad and went away grieved I don't know what it is about that scripture but it tears me up every time I read it he was that close he was there with the person of eternal life he came in contact with life and was told what to do that he might inherit life and he walked away because he couldn't sacrifice himself see we love the idea of Jesus Christ being the sacrifice taking my place taking my shame Taking My Punishment we love that idea because we couldn't pay the price we couldn't endure and he did it in our place and we love that concept and we love that idea but we have to realize it doesn't mean that we have no sacrifice that we have no suffering that we have no giving up of Our Lives he took the place for us to purchase for us eternal life we could never take that place so he took it for us but Jesus still said take up your cross and follow me so we act like because he took that POS position that there's no cross for us to Bear let's go to Romans 8:12 Romans chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 verse 12 says therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you lived after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live amen we are not to live after the flesh if we live after the flesh we'll die but we live in the flesh this is where it gets tight we live in the flesh we're human beings we still have emotion we still have feelings we still have fears we still have all the things that come with living in hybrid flesh and living in this world and we have we all we all suffer we're all subject to these same things amen but we're not to live after the flesh because if we live after the flesh we'll die but if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live let's go back to Matthew 6 I'm sorry we're flipping back and forth but it's good for us it's good exercise Matthew chapter 6 and I really I I'm I'm not going to apologize for reading a lot of scriptures because this is exactly what I want to do I want to take my time and read the scriptures Matthew chapter 6 ver 25 says therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than reignment I love that statement first he tells us don't be so preoccupied with what you're going to be where you're going to live what house you're going to have a car you're going to drive and I say that as one who's been very preoccupied like we don't we don't say it as though we're immune from this is like what what you got to do is this and no I get very preoccupied there are some days I can't wait to get home and eat supper and I that's all I think about but we it goes deeper than that how will we provide for our kids how will we get their education how will we this and what about our future and what about retirement and what about and what about and what about and you can't stop thinking about that and also you can't stop being responsible enough to take what God's given you and lay up store for the future because that's also part of the word that's also our responsibility so it's not all wrong the problem is when that becomes a focus and that Focus becomes a priority and that priority begins to dictate how we act in life and what we think about and begin to detract from the main purpose we're on this planet that's when it becomes wrong that's when it will lead to death amen so we're all subject to these same things we all I mean we we all have these thoughts we all have these concerns we all have this but we have to constantly bring it back in perspective so that we don't lose sight of what is real and what is the vapor what is the mist and what is reality what is temporal and what is permanent amen and and and and it it smacks in the face every day and we have to come in contact with all the time but we need the word of God constantly in our mind so that we realize that I'm here for more than a retirement plan I'm here for more the the the the body is more than for reignment I'm here for more than just to get clothes and put clothes on I'm here for more than just to feed this body amen God will take care of that because I'm here to serve his purpose and as long as I'm here to serve his purpose he'll take care of this body amen so life is more than meat and the body than reignment let's turn to chapter 16 same book Matthew chapter 16 Matthew chapter 16 verse 21 says from that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go into Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed be raised again the third day then Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee Lord this shall not be unto thee but he turned and said unto Peter get thee behind me Satan Thou Art an offense unto me for thou savest not the things that be of God but those that be of men Peter was very narrow sided Peter it it looks like Peter just has a a love for the Lord but really Peter has a love for himself and for the current condition that he's living in and there was a a great ministry going on at the time Jesus had a fantastic Ministry Peter was part of that Ministry they were in The Glory Days and Peter just before this had received the Revelation from the father that Jesus was the Christ the son of the Living God and after that Revelation came and Jesus confirmed that that Revelation came from the father not from flesh then he begins to tell them what's going to happen that he's going to be going to Jerusalem he's going to be taken he's going to be crucified and all of that and when Peter hears that Peter's response is that's impossible that cannot happen that is wrong because it's counterintuitive they're having the campaign Jesus is the son of the Living God he just got the Revelation amen from the father of who this is how important this ministry is there's no way in a Ministry this important is going to be crucified man that's humanistic thinking that's the human idea and Peter's stuck in the human idea he doesn't want what he has to go away he doesn't want the ministry to cease he doesn't want the Lord to depart he doesn't want his position in it to fade away Peter is looking after the things that be of man and not the things that be of God because it was the will of God that he should be the sacrificial lamb it was the will of God that he was taken to Jerusalem it was the will of God that he was beaten and rejected and mocked and scored and crucified and Jesus recognized where this self-preservation came from he said get thee behind me Satan oh if God would help me have that same kind of vision when those whispering things come into my ear when I feel like defending myself or protecting myself I get preoccupied with self if I could turn around and say get behind me Satan for you are an offense to me because you careth about the things that be of men and not the things that be of God you're trying to get me to care about this life more than I care about the next life get behind me Satan you're trying to get me to preserve my natural life instead of surrendering and taking my cross and following get behind me Satan am God if he would just help us to have Crystal Clear Vision they would help us so much in the Smur and church age from the church age book brother BS makes this statement he says you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering hey I'm going to tell you right now this is a problem for me like I know this is true and I testify it's true but the very next time I enter into suffering I I I start to feel like God's love means no suffering and I start think things like God do you love me why are you letting this happen to me why am I going through this don't you know where I am don't you know what's happening can't you see my heart is breaking can't you see my prayers the things that I say and the things that go through my mind testify that I'm struggling with the same thing the Jews were struggling with that somehow I still think his love means no suffering because when I'm suffering I start feeling abandoned I start feeling neglected I start feeling like maybe I'm not one of them and God doesn't care for me and I'm not part of the elect and I'm not a chosen because now I'm suffering amen all these questions start flooding the Mind through suffering why am I suffering and does God loved me and and and all of these things start coming and then you realize that we as human beings struggle with the same thing human beings have always struggled with CU they couldn't figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God has chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth question is does God love you has he revealed the message to you has he revealed the word has he unveiled himself to you has he chosen you Amen to receive this then he loves you period what happens next doesn't change his love for you his love is fixed and his love is known by election and his election is revealed to you by Revelation amen that's God's love good days and bad days doesn't change the amount of love that he has for us because that was determined before when our names were sealed in the Lamb's Book of Life he says listen to this he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative amen help me God help me let this be his progy I truly friends want to get to the place where the next time the wheels fall off the bus and life Turns Upside Down I don't start saying God what's wrong I'd like to change from God's what's wrong to God help me do right right now show me what you want me to do next that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as job said he put strength in US you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered if that's the case for Jesus then how's he going to perfect Us by showering us with everything's easy everything's provided you never get sick you never lose your job you never have Financial insecurity you never have somebody misunderstand you never have conflict in the church you never have problems in your family you never have any of this stuff because God loves you see he learned obedience by the things he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered there's another scripture I'm going to uh jump ahead I have it somewhere in my notes if I can find it to Ecclesiastes 7:3 I'm just going to read it to you you don't have to turn there said sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the count countenance The Heart Is Made better what a statement what a statement you know when I preach these things I almost feel bad for preaching him because but it's life it's real it's what really happens it's the way Christianity really is sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the countenance The Heart Is Made better listen I there's times in my life that I've suffered and been brokenhearted really been down low and really hurt but I can tell you those have become the greatest times of growth in my whole life those are times when God became precious to me and he revealed himself in a personal way and maybe in a way that I would have never stopped and seen or felt or understood if I hadn't hit the despair it was times in despair that brought about my testimonies it's times in great struggle where I seen his mighty hand amen and the sadness of the countenance The Heart Is Made better and I can say amen that's nothing but the truth amen am amen amen we don't like to suffer and we don't like to watch others suffer and that's just the truth I've told people before as a pastor breaks my heart to see people go through trials and troubles in their family and if it was up to me I would let them bypass it all I say oh Lord no no no don't let that happen to their family don't let that happen to them no God take that away immediately and that's still the way I pray but in reality God is doing what's best for that individual and I know it when he's doing it for me I know it I said God help me to understand this is what I need for the sadness of the countenance does the heart good amen we need to suffer to be perfected let's look turn to Hebrews chapter 12 now Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 in Hebrews 12:1 he says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness Witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which those who easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finish of our faith for who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your minds he's telling us to focus focus on Christ because he was an example to us because he didn't have it easy and he didn't have it without contradiction and he didn't have a life that was at ease amen and and look look unto Jesus the author and finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross amen God has given us precious promises we know what's set before us and what is set before us is more glorious than anything we can experience in this life in this Dimension amen this life is a vapor this is a Mist it's going to be over if you make it 90 years 90 years is nothing in comparison to Eternity 90 years of suffering to gain eternity is better than year than 90 years of pleasure and missing eternity so we weigh it in the balance amen there's no way if i s struggle and suffer every single day of my life it is still worth it is still better it is still glorious in the face of winning eternity of what God has in store for me amen if he must if he must perfect me through this to get me there so that I have character to reign with him in the Millennium then go be praise be to God this is what I need to get there my goal is there my goal is not here amen amen praise God amen if you're going to school to the the the to to to become a professional and you have to go to maybe six seven eight years of school you want a PhD and something and and and you're going to school and the reason you're going to school is to get the job so as you go to school you have to study you have to write papers and you have to be diligent about when you go to bed and when you get up and attending class and writing the papers and getting the grades and blah blah blah blah blah and it's not so much that you want to write that paper and say oh I'm so excited I get to write a 20page research paper on a topic I could care less about this is wonderful no that's not wonderful that's hard it's a trial you don't like it you have to do it but you do it because of the goal and for the glory that lay ahead and Jesus endured the cross amen God helped me to set my affections on things above not on things on the earth help me to understand with reality with revelation and the glory that's laying ahead you think this is glorious amen just to hear the message wait until the very message himself Jesus Christ is there in flesh in the Millennium and you can see him and hear his voice and be under that rule in that atmosphere where sin is bound my goodness there's nothing here that can compare to that and 40 or 50 more years of struggle and suffer is nothing compared to that I I say God help me help me to be like a mule amen and just put my head down and plow through the traces without complaining without bitterness without selflove you know what's destroying our mental health feeling sorry for ourselves feeling sorry for ourselves somebody made fun of me misunderstood me treated me poorly amen that's the grace of God bringing us to Perfection that's the tool in the hand of God to shape his children is it wrong it's wrong did they do you wrong they did you wrong did God allow it yes it's either yes or no if God allowed it then it must be for my good and it must serve his purpose and it must bring about glory in the end so when I begin to feel sorry for myself for the thing that God has brought for my perfection and His glory then what I do is I trap myself in an emotional trap and it's destroying our walk with the Lord that's right man if I could just not feel sorry for myself I could do so much better amen I wish I had mastered that by now I wish I could stand here and say I got over that but I didn't get over it I wasn't over it yesterday I probably won't be over it tomorrow but by the grace of God may he paint the picture where I can keep saying you know what that's not the truth it's not the truth I feel miserable but that's not the truth the reality is all things work together for good this too is serving his purpose it's going to be okay and I could say God my heart is broken God I don't understand but God I'm trusting in in you help me to move forward and strengthen me am mean we still need his help we still need his strength we still need the bomm of Gilead we can't do it by ourselves but if we don't recognize what's happening we move into despair we move into self-focus when we move into self- Focus we begin to deteriorate on the inside I'm telling you the worst thing that could ever happen to you and I is that we feel sorry for ourselves guess what if God told us every trial goes across God's desk right and he's got to give approval for it if God signed off on it that means he didn't feel sorry for you so if God's not feeling sorry for me what right do I have to feel sorry for myself amen and the reality is if I begin to feel sorry for myself what I'm doing is I'm saying this isn't fair and this isn't right and this isn't fair that's a total self FOC Focus perspective I've lost focus of the word that's really the danger of this is because I've lost focus of Christ being Lord of all because I feel like what's happening to me isn't right isn't fair isn't just and all that may be true that it's not right not fair not just but it's still ordained of God and so with that self focus I lose sight of the word when I lose sight of the word I start to believe a lie yeah that's right and how did Deception come in the beginning how did the fall come it was when Eve believed a lie what is the devil trying to get us to do he's trying to get us to believe a lie and the very minute we begin to accept a lie as truth amen we begin to deteriorate spiritually when we believe that that that this is uh this is not right this is not of God this is not it's going to begin to deteriorate us spiritually it's going to damage us and hurt those around us I say God I'm telling you friends I've got a sickness and I think you've got it too a sickness is called self and I think we all got a bad case of it but God's working on it he's trying to cure us amen let's turn to Galatians chapter 5 sometimes we wonder how we can get into such places in life such places where we pull back from God we pull back from the body we separate ourselves from fellowship we get so discouraged and despondent we get so depressed and we wonder sometimes how we got in that place amen and I'll tell you the way we got there in my this is just my perspective is started by feeling so sorry for ourselves and then the devil gave us all kinds of information to support that feeling right all the facts poured in then you start feeling unfairly treated when you start feeling unfairly treated unjustly treated uh the whole world's against you nobody's been fair with you what's happening to me isn't right I guarantee that there's going to be a devil there to give you a list of facts that support that truth because he wants you to believe the lie yeah and the more we believe the lie the further we separate ourselves from the very thing we need the most which is the word of God The Fellowship of the Saints the body of Christ amen say God help me to stop feeling sorry for myself it's pretty bad I mean it's so bad that if my wife forgets what I asked her to pack for lunch and pack something else I start feeling sorry for myself I told her yesterday I didn't want this I want she didn't listen to me she doesn't care like she should care nobody cares about me I'm going to have to start packing my own lunch she was worried about something else and now she and she but but the boys they got what they wanted in lunch but I didn't get what I wanted she's putting more time and attention to them than she's putting into me and you know what happens and that sounds funny but that's exactly the way it starts and it's all a lie and it's all feeling sorry for myself oh it's a bad sickness friends it's really bad your kids get it too he got two pieces I only got one you like him better than me yeah that's exactly right the day you were born I decided you're not getting anything we joke about those things but when it starts to become a reality in Our Minds when that starts to become the truth it starts to plague us and it starts to discourage us and that discourage moves the despondency and all of a sudden you can begin to feel like an outcast in your own home and it's all a lie you can start to feel like those who love you the most don't love you right and that's a lie amen amen amen God help us human beings are pathetic yes might as well come to terms with it brother man said man's a failure to begin with we are pathetic our minds are shot these bodies are falling our minds are corrupt amen we need the word of God to keep setting this thing right all the time or else we're going to go wrong There's A Thousand Ways To Die there's only one way to live and that's receive the word of God receive Christ let's go to Galatians chapter 5: 16 he says this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would but if you would be led of the spirit you are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath Strife seditions her IES envyings murders drunkenness revelings and such like of the which I tell you before as I have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law when you look at these list of the things that are of the flesh and the works that are of the spirit the fruit of the Flesh and the fruit of the spirit if you look at those that are of the flesh they all have to do with self self-pleasure self-gratification self-preservation what Strife is all about being right emulations is competition being number one wrath is being angry at somebody for what they did to you all of these are about self if you look at the fruits of the spirit it's all outside of self love joy peace longsuffering it's being patient gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance and self-control against such there is the law there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit see the spirit walks according to the word the flesh walks according to our own desires and lusts and affections that's why we have to crucify the Flesh and that we have to walk in the spirit and to walk in the spirit we cannot walk in the spirit apart of walking from God's word because God's word and God's spirit go together and the the word tells us to crucify the flesh with the affections and lust thereof the word tells us to take up our cross and follow after him the word tells us to suffer for his name's sake and so when we walk in the spirit we will not fulfill the lust of the flesh so what is the secret to overcoming the flesh is to walk in the spirit amen I need to be conscience and diligent and deliberate about walking in the spirit the problem that comes is when I start to get so when I start to feel sorry for myself and become despondent and become discouraged you know what I do almost every time I pull back from the word pull back from brothers and sisters pull back from fellowship pulled back and all a sudden I began despondent discouraged depressed and I begin to lose interest even listening to The Prophet's voice what did that self the combat flesh is to walk in the spirit to stay engaged not to nurse my hurt not to allow the lie to take over but to stay connected to stay engaged to stay in the word to stay in prayer to stay in Fellowship to listen to the message to read to to stay connected with God Amen no matter how hurt I am or how depressed I am the only healing that I God is in that word but the trick of the devil is to get us to turn inward and to turn inward then we we go on a a course and we spiral downhill in Galatians Chapter 2 we're here in Galatians let's just flip back to chapter 2 verse 20 says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I'm crucified with Christ but I live but it can't be me living it has to be Christ Living in me that's the only way that we're going to overcome when brother B begins to talk about the Apostle Paul he begins to speak about Paul and he comes to this place and present stage of my Ministry and he talks about Deus having forsaken Paul and the reason Deus forsook him is because he couldn't understand Paul Paul was a mighty Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ he was a prophet he was a light to the Gentiles he had met the Lord face to face he had gifts in his life he had healings and he had all kinds of manifestations that followed him he met the pillar of fire himself he had all this but yet when he saw Paul's life life Afflicted saw him rejected cast out ridiculed when he saw that he was no longer welcome in churches he used to be welcome in when he got to the place where he only had one coat and he was a prisoner and he left his friend sick in one city to come to another and no longer had the power to heal that friend brother M said it looked like Paul was walking up they had no more power that there there was no more might it wasn't like it was at the beginning it changed and the Bible actually says in 2 Timothy 4 it says for demoth has forsaken me having loved this present World why did Deus forsake Him the same reason the Rich Young Ruler turned his back on Jesus and walked away the same reason because he couldn't cope with losing out in this world he couldn't deal with the rejection he couldn't deal with weakness he couldn't deal with being nothing and Deus had forsaken him having loved this present world but Paul the Apostle Paul who had everything going for him in the natural Paul begins to tell us that you know he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees he he had gotten letters from the high priest so he knew the the priesthood the leadership in Jerusalem he was well thought of respected went to the school of Gia he was out on a campaign as a zealous Jew to stamp out this new sect this new heresy amen he had everything going for him brother B said he was arm in-arm with the high priest he had it all he had Prestige he had he had class he had no doubt opportunity for wealth he had he was going to get a good position he had you know he had everything going for him but when he met the pillar of fire his whole life changed and from then on what does Paul have Paul has trials tribulations rejections abuses he's shipwreck he goes through a list Shipwrecked beaten amen uh beaten 39 times left for dead lowered off of a wall of the city I mean he has he has this wrap sheet that is absolutely ridiculous it's tragedy after tragedy after tragedy not after he served the Lord not before he after he served the Lord was it perfect it was perfect before he served the Lord the tragedy came after he served the Lord after he gave his life to Christ after he became the messenger for the age the light un the Gentiles after he moved into his commission and his purpose on the earth and God's hand was upon him he was filled with the Holy Ghost and he was moving forward in the power of God to serve God's purpose it was in that condition that everything went wrong it got so bad Deus couldn't handle it anymore because Deus couldn't sacrifice himself but Paul Paul says I count it all D that I may win Christ Paul had a life of suffering and rejection false accusation and imprisonment and Paul wasn't complaining and we don't have a record in the Bible that Paul was feeling sorry for himself but he was pressing on they put him in jail he wrote letters amen he testified on the ship he prayed amen after he was Shipwrecked he had a healing campaign through the island that he landed on he didn't sit down and nurse his hurts and talk about falsely imprison they rejected me the Jews how could they they know me I used to be their friends and now the very ones I went to school with in Gia School a theology now they're the ones who turn on me how could they treat me this way and I I'm this and it's so bad amen you know what happened to now I'm in prison and now I'm Shipwrecked and now I'm snake bit now I'm miserable and wet and even the natives have to come start a fire my life is miserable and everything's horrible he wouldn't have had a healing campaign if he would have been in that attitude he wouldn't have had a Revival on the island like he did and go all the way up to the governor of the island and heal his father if he had that attitude amen Paul knew that he was chosen for a purpose he knew he knew the glory that lay at the end of the road and he was willing to endure to obtain that prize he told us so in the scriptures he says in Philippians this is what Paul says he says yay and doubtless I count all things lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and I do count them but dung that I may win Christ can we do the same thing can we count everything else as dung that I might win Christ can we suffer every day of our lives and still have a joyful expectation for the next life and still be about the father's business can we have all our friends turn against us and people falsely accuse us and say things that aren't true and go and try to destroy our work behind our back and can we have that and still say it's worth it all to have Christ can you can we have that happen to us and stay engaged and stay in the ministry and keep spreading the gospel that's a challenge Paul was an example to us all he tells us let's turn to First Corinthians together and read this from the Apostle Paul 1 Corinthians chapter 9 1 Corinthians chapter 9: 24 know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth from the Mastery is temperent in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertain so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others on myself should be a Cast Away Paul starts using the analogy of running a race for a a worldly treasure for some Accolade or some reward a crown he calls it and those that are running that race to receive that Earthly Crown they're tempered in all things they keep their body under control they're careful about what they eat they're careful about how much they sleep they're careful about where they go and what they do why because they're training themselves and keeping themselves in condition so that they might obtain a temporal prize but he says but ours is Incorruptible ours is an eternal prize if they will have to keep after themselves if they will have to eat right sleep right walk right associate right do right in order to win this Earthly prize what should we do to obtain the Heavenly prize amen should we should I think we should reign in this flesh I think we should tell it no I think we should tell this flesh when the flesh starts that self-pity party say uh-uh buddy no we're in the hands of God we're not going to feel sorry for ourselves we're not going to protect ourselves we're not going to defend ourselves we're not going down that road we're not going to spend hours worrying about tomorrow it's a waste of time we got to keep under our flesh and walk in the spirit bring these things subject to the word of God we have to we have to know how to possess our vessels and not let our vessels possess us because these are all things that we face all of us face and they're all questions that we have in circumstances that we come in contact with and they're all trials that we undergo and so none of us are excused from this but we're instructed Amen to walk in the spirit not in the flesh to forget those things and press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus to look at the glory that lay ahead and endure and like I said earlier I I I I have this image that I keep coming back to but it it may sound uh uh negative in some way but it's not negative when I get into trouble and when I get into difficult circumstances what I want to do is just like a mule hooked to the traces plowing out for the master I just want to put my head down and just walk amen because you know what I'm going to plow this field regardless if I kick and scream and fuss and I bite it the bit and I he and Hall and whip my head around I'm still going to I'm still going to have to plow this row I'm still going to have to go through this trial I'm still going to have to come to Perfection I'm still going to have to learn obedience by the things I I'm still going to have to plow this field no matter how much I strain and fight and you can have an old mule and if he's not trained real well and he gets contener he can fight and he can fuss and he can stomp his feet and kick his feet but you know he's still tied to the traces and he's still going to plow this field but at the end of it he's going to be all worked up and sweaty and he's going to hurt hurt himself and it's going to be way worse for him and if he just quietly put his head down and get to the end of the row said God help me to be the tool that you're going to use on this Earth and help me to have enough sense just to put my head down and plow cuz that's the easiest way amen amen and I don't mean with an attitude of defeat not nothing's ever going to change it's never going to get better that's not not true not that kind but this is something God wants me to go through God wants me to do and I just got to go through it and the quicker I submit and move through the easier it's going to be and I'm going to find out at the other end there might be a rub down in a pile of Oats be a reward in it friends there always is sometimes we can't see the reward when we're in the middle of the field but God's good to us you look at the things that Paul went through after his conversion the the the list is unbelievable we think about the things brother Brenham went through after his conversion the troubles and the trials but you know his life also wasn't without blessings God blessed him abundantly he talks about the things all the gifts that people sent him he he talks about the trips he got to go on through he loved the Wilderness he loved the Hun and and that brother took some of the most amazing hunting trips I've ever heard of right you know what that was that was a blessing from God for him it's not that it's all treasury it's not that it's all misery God is good if we learn to see good in everything we're going to see more good if we see the trial is good and the blessing is good we're going to find out amen that that I could never enjoy the blessing if I didn't go through the trial I would never get the benefit out of the blessing if I didn't go through the trial and if my life was all blessing I would never have the character that comes through the trial brother Brenham loved guns and he loved shooting he had guns sent to him from all over the world you know what that was the blessing of God but he couldn't get that without the trial it had to go together I believe in the blessings of God but I also believe that God will perfect our character through suffer and I believe it's ordained so the two go hand in hand brother B says and oh Lord just once more uh speaking of Samson he says the trouble of it is the church today is not like Samson they're not willing to pay the price Samson prayed right when he prayed Lord let me die with the Enemy he know it was going to cost him something he know it was going to cost something it's going to cost you something it's going to cost me something your social prestige your place and position in the denomination Lord let me die then I see your purpose he know it was going to cost him something you must be ready to die out to your enemy to get in the blessings of God Samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of God again upon him he was willing to do it are you that's what brother R says he's willing to do it are you are you willing to sacrifice your television programs and you know it used to be wrong for us to go to the movies but now the devil put one over on you brought it right in the house with you that's right brother B starts going into a list of things but what he's showing us are you willing to give up the things that feed the Flesh and bring pleasure Amen to serve God are you willing to die out to this guy so that the purpose of God in our lives can be fulfilled God had a purpose in Samson's life and that purpose was to begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines and he went out and because he had a gift in his life and there was a prophecy over his life he began to go out and he began to do that the problem is Samson could never overcome himself Samson's trials came because he had to pleas self so he finds himself one day in a dungeon grinding at a mill with his eyes poked out because of self-love but in that dungeon with his eyes poked out you know what you know what that was that was the mercy of God amen that dungeon was Mercy having no more eyesight was the love of God so how can that be because when Samson was grinding at the Mill he began to think he never stopped serving himself in life long enough to really think he never stopped fulfilling the lust of the flesh long enough to really think he knew he had a gift and he knew he loved God and he knewest part of the Redemption uh part of the Deliverance but he never really stopped to think and now in this condition he begins to think and as he begins to grind at the meal he begins to reflect back on his life and he think about the commission and the things that God has done and the things that he's done and the condition he's in guess what was not happening to Samson he was not growing despond and he wasn't trapped in self-love and a pity party for himself he began to realize I'm here of my own doing I'm here because of the choices I made and this isn't what God has for me God called me to be a deliverer and Samson's greatest Victory came when they brought him out to make sport of him to make fun of him and mock him you know when they brought him out to mock him let out by a little boy so that they can make fun of him you know what was on his mind Lord let me die I surrend surrender yes all what did Samson come to he finally come to the the place where he would give his life for his purpose amen they were mocking him making fun of him and he wasn't yelling that's not fair stop that's mean but he come to terms with his purpose he said God let me die right here with the Philistines with my enemy that I might fulfill the purpose which you've called me for you know what you know what you're called for to destroy the works of the devil that's what you're called here for God wants to use his bride to finish the work that he left for this specific hour he needs your body he needs my body he needs us to be in a condition where we're not serving self first cuz that won't work what does he need preeminence what is preeminence First Place full control what is the whole plan of God Amen the whole plan of God was for God to manifest himself he foreshadowed it in Eden since it's Fallen Eden he's been rebuilding it and has come through a three-fold purpose which is God's one goal to have preeminence in a man he did in Christ Jesus to have preeminence in a people he's doing that now God to finish the work and restore Eden back again amen amen amen you know what he needs from us Lord let me die let me die sometimes when we think that God's called us to destroy the works of the enemy that it'll it'll be a sword and a horse and we just ride around and slay everybody but maybe the very best way for God's purpose to be fulfilled in our lives is for us to give up our lives not the image of a soldier not the image of a warrior not the image of a mighty Victor are going around destroying the devil stomping them under feet and maybe that's the wrong image because when that doesn't happen we start to feel disappointed in our life as a Believer maybe what he needs is a Samson somebody will say Lord I surrendered to that let me die to myself let me die to self-preservation let me die to self love let me die so that you can take this flesh finish your work and destroy the works of the devil many times we get the wrong idea he says they're not willing to pay the price brother man said it's going to cost you something it's going to cost me something and when I began to reflect on that I went to second Samuel so if you could turn there with me I want to look at 2 Samuel together the second book of Samuel and let's go to chapter 24 2 Samuel 24 verse 22 this is where the angel of the Lord was destroying by pestilence Israel because David had numbered the people and he had stopped over Jerusalem and the prophet had told him to offer a sacrifice and so he had stopped at a aronas threshing floor so David wants to offer a sacrifice and in 22 it says and aronas said unto David let my Lord the king Take and offer up what seeth good unto him behold here be oxen from B sacrifice and threshing instruments and other instruments of The Oxen for wood all these things did Arona as a king give unto the king and Arona said unto the king the Lord thy God accept thee and the King said unto Aron this is King David and the King said unto Arona nay but I will surely buy it of thee at a price neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing so David thought David bought the threshing floor and The Oxen for 50 shekels of of silver and David built there an altar unto the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings so the Lord was entreated for the land and the plague was stayed from Israel this is such an interesting important principle to realize that David needed to offer an offering he needed the he needed to offer an offering of an atonement so that the hand of the Lord could be stayed and he was the king he was the one to offer it and and they were there at the threshing floor where he would have a sacrifice and and I gave him everything take the oxen take all the instruments for the for the fire I give it all to you you can have the threshing FL you can have everything make the offering and that sounded wonderful amen it sounded like that was a good thing but to David it wasn't going to work how can I offer to the Lord that which cost me nothing I said God how let's bring it home today how can we offer to the Lord that which cost us nothing amen when it's easy just to come to church it's easy easy to sit through a service it's easy to go back home amen but but what if I just give him my whole life amen what if I give him my thought life what if I give him my time what if I give him my energy I don't want to give him that which cost me nothing amen I don't want to worship God in a way that has no sacrifice cuz how do I show my love to God brother brandom says in the message the church and its condition from 1956 he says and so they were very loyal to go to church and he's talking about people that are a northern Canada he's getting ready to have meetings up in Canada and he's telling them that it's cold up there the people are coming from far and there's long distances between cities and Villages says so they they're very loyal to go to church no matter how cold it is they'll wrap up in a blanket and sit on a bob sled and drive the horse for 30 Mi to go to get to go to church they'll walk through the snow drifts and everything else Young and old they'll all group together and one family gets the other and they start walking and they go it's a sacrifice that they make is what causes them to get so much out of the service when there's no sacrifice there's not very much to the service you have to really get down and do something that hurts real bad have to lay aside some things and stop the work and do this or that to get to go to church and show God that you love him and you you you make a sacrifice to go it's then when you get something out of it amen listen we've got it pretty easy we got heated and air conditioned home heated and air conditioned cars good roads easy travel heated and air conditioned Church soft seats and regular service times and uh work schedule that's already worked around it not too bad and listen I don't think we should just on purpose make that harder I kind of like that but he says the sacrifice that they get something out of it David wouldn't offer to God that which cost him nothing we don't want to give God the minimal service that which cost us nothing and listen at some point if you take this word as the authority and you take this message as truth you're going to come in contact someday to a place that it's going to cost you something it seems like when we first come to it it's all gain you're the bride of Christ you get a position you have eternal life you have have you'll be the Bride of Jesus Christ joint air but somewhere along the line you're going to hit something that's going to have to cause you to deny yourself for this word there's people who have come in contact with a barrier in the word where they now know that they're not they're not they have no right to remarry because of their marriage condition they have to live single the rest of their lives am we have come in contact with with with a commandment to not forsake the attending of the fellowship not forsake the assembling together of ourselves amen and there's those that will give up work promotions yes for the word of God why just to simply be in the house of God when the doors are open somewhere along the line we're going to come in contact with the word and it's going to require sacrifice and we can make excuses and find workarounds is that true but brother B said it's the sacrifice that they make is what causes them to get so much out of the service I'm not just talking about a church service I'm talking about serviceing serving God now if it all comes easy and there's no sacrifice you know we're blessed with a robust Fellowship you can have people to Fellowship well you can talk to somebody you can visit with somebody almost every night but there's those that are alone following this message there's those that have no Fellowship there's those that are the only one in their demographic in their Church The Only Widow the only teenager the only kid amen amen so God help me not to be a lazy self-serving Christian not to be a lazy message believer that always takes the easy road but God help me to deny myself to keep this word help me to deny if it means giving up a promotion if it means giving up extra this or that God help me to be do something to give you the best that I got because it's the sacrifice brother B said that makes the service amen it's amazing how Leo DEA Creeps in so easy brother B we have a prophet of God who teaches us he teaches us that we should be at the church every time the doors are open if we don't have that desire then we should pray because something's wrong am but it's kind of easy to miss and brother man furthermore tells us that it's a good idea to come early and get quiet and pray but we still have multitudes that come at the last minute and I I know that we live in Leo deia and I said God help Leo deia not to affect us help us to push back lord sometimes I look and I see things cooling off I see it cooling off in myself and it scares me I say God don't let me don't let me cool off don't let me get lazy don't let me start coasting Lord I don't want to start coasting let me drop it back down in gear and let me put my shoulder to the wheel let me sacrifice myself for this message it makes me nervous when I see things get too easy to routine makes me nervous because I know what kind of people we are we're human beings and I know what kind of atmosphere we live in Leo DEA and we get to the place where we attend church when it's convenient we come early if we happen to make it early we pray if we got there early if we didn't we say why pray at home we make all kinds of excuses for ourselves the reason we make excuses for ourselves is because our biggest enemy is oursel and we all do I do too I get I go from fervency to cooled off to ferv I say God I don't want to live like that I want to be RedHot on fire and I want to crucify this man so that I may win Christ because that means everything to me if we brother M said if you put more in you get more out it's amazing too how pathetic we are as human beings we'll miss church we'll come halfhazard we'll come at the last minute we won't come early and pray we won't come for the Saturday prayer meeting we won't invest in the service we'll come last minute we'll sit and listen to the preaching and we'll leave and say I didn't get anything out of it there must be something wrong with the preacher maybe there was no sacrifice maybe it's not maybe it is the preacher it could be but maybe it's not maybe we all have a responsibility to put our whole heart into Christ and I we use an example the church but it's beyond the church service it's our whole life it's where we give our time it's our personal devotion it's what we watch it's what we spend time doing it's where we let our minds drift to it's our whole life and we find ourselves serving the Flesh and we get discouraged about something and serve the Flesh and find distractions in entertainment or find distractions in something else and then we become lethargic as Christians and then then you know it's never our fault it's always somebody else's fault it's always because they did me wrong or because they're not preaching fiery enough at church or we don't have this or that but we never stop long enough to say could it be me could it be that I'm not getting something because of my level of sacrifice and it could be the other that's true it could be the problem is in the preacher it could be the problem is in other people or it could be the problems in us the reality is I can't do anything about the preacher and I can't do anything about the other people the only thing I have control over is me so maybe what I should do is focus on the thing that I know I ought to do and see if I do what the prophet told me to do and I make a sacrifice and I give up my feelings my emotions my time my if I give it all up and I give everything maybe I'll do that and see Amen brother B said in hearing recognizing acting on on the word of God said someone say Billy if you don't stop that you'll Ru you'll run everybody away there's one thing that won't go the holy spirit because it's his word and the real predestinated believer won't go away because it's food to his soul he loves it and nothing can keep him away from it he'll do anything like Jacob but he wants that Birthright he'll stand there I don't care if it cost every friend he's God if it cost his job if it cost his church membership if it cost everything he'll still hold to it cuz he can't help it there's something in him moving him the Deep calling to the Deep oh there you are something in him praise God brother bam said in the message he that is in you it was hard for him to die that this might be produced to you it was hard for him to go to Calvary he wanted to stay even so much till he cried not my will but thine be done see he don't he didn't want to leave he was a young man and he had his Brethren he loved them just like I love you he couldn't live and them live also so he he died that we might live that wasn't easy he had to do it look what a death laid before Him Father the hour has come and shall I pray that you'll take this cup away from me no he didn't want to do that he wanted God's will to be done again in power of transformation he said our Redemption wasn't a cheap thing yes it was the son of God had to die for us things of value come of great price things of value come at great price the question is is this message valuable is this word valuable is fellowship with the Saints valuable because it comes at a great price somebody had to pay the price what price am I willing to pay for this treasure that's been handed to me I think we take things with too little value sometimes because they were handed to us easy and I realize too like in myself there's been times of huge sacrifice in the past we first come to the message and rejection and we sacrificed we lost a lot but just because I sacrificed 25 years ago doesn't mean I don't have to sacrifice now just because I gave up my church church and my family and I gave up a job and I gave up these things doesn't mean I'm done doesn't mean well I paid my dues no I want to give more he gave me everything I want to give him my day I want to give him my time I want to give him my mind I want to give him my eyes I want to take time to read his word I want to stop what I'm doing I want to force this flesh to get up a little earlier I'm so so sick and tired of self I convinc myself that what I need is more sleep when what I need is time with God but I'll convince myself when the alarm comes off that what I need is more sleep right God help me help me God to bring this I don't want this flesh to be my God and I don't want to keep making sacrifices for this flesh I want to sacrifice this flesh for my God help me God said I'll read the first line again the Redemption wasn't a cheap thing it was the son of God had to die for us things of value come of great price to bring this message it wasn't easy see no it isn't I had to forsake everything that was dear to me even my own people everybody but you see the value of it is you see is to do the will of God and to do that which knowing that there is something in me when he used to say well they was going to put me away he thought I'd lost my mind baptizing in the name of Jesus Christ contrary to the church and all these things they said he's crazy but you see no matter what they said there is something has to be done and God just takes a person sticks him in his hand and said do this and you do it what a price it might have been to St Paul taught under Gia the greatest teacher of the Dead day and come down and the very thing that he considered heresy the thing that he thought that was the worst thing that he could have happened to the church he comes right around and becomes a partaker of it strange thing and how God works in wondrous ways and strange odd ways his wonders to perform God was able to take Paul in his hand and Paul was willing to give up everything for this glorious gospel it came with a price the New Testament that we read it came with a price the fact that we read a Bible came at a price how many people died burned at the Stak or killed by state governments because they translated a Bible into a common language that people could read and printed it and distributed it it came at a price and there's times I won't pay the price to take 30 minutes of my day to read it God forgive me people gave their life so that I could hold a Bible easily in my hand and read it in my native language I could at least pay a price to read it every day I don't know about you but I get ashamed of myself then I look in my mirror and I say I hate you I hate everything about you I hate the things you want I hate the it might do us all a bit of good to do that every morning go through that exercise I I hate you you're my enemy I'm going to defeat you I'm going to control you you're not going to control me we are going to serve the Lord and guess what tomorrow you're getting up extra early cuz you slept in today it's funny but we have to take control of this guy because he wants to control us the wrong way the fall in the beginning came because Eve had a desire for self but man said she didn't know but she wanted to know and the serpant offered her a way to know if Eve hadn't had any self- desire there would have been no fall it began in the beginning because of self-d Desire it's continuing in us because of self- Desire but God is going to have the victory amen James 1 tells us but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust ha conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death so what happens where's the problem in me in lust you can say that devil that Devil's only enticing Your Lust it's you you're the one who has to deny self let's go to 1 Timothy chapter 3 first Timothy chapter 3 I'm sorry second Timothy I told you wrong let's flip over to Second Timothy chapter 3: 1 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come so are we in the last days it's perilous times for men shall be lovers of their own selves first out of the shoot first thing to mention when perilous times comes men will be lovers of their own selves you can say oh I don't struggle with all anything else on that list well we all struggle with this one for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy traitors I'm sorry unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good Trad heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away men shall be lovers of their own selves if you look at this whole list again it's all self-focus and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God that's not what his bride is to be that's not what I want to be and that's why I want to strive against this flesh that I live in so that I will not be that brother M said in the rising of his son he said there's something oh God it's old self it's that wife of job standing there what was that wife of Job saying there what was she saying why don't you curse God and die she says does thou retain thy Integrity Curse God and die what was that old wife of job doing she was saying what good is it doing you anyways look how miserable you are look how bad it is just give up and brother bandam says that old wife of job is self now it's self telling you what what is it worth to you every time it always goes this way it always goes wrong it's always trouble it's always going bad you're always in the fix yeah what good is it doing you job said you speak like a foolish woman we need to tell self that amen you're speaking foolishly amen the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord it's in job 2:9 where she says this I'm going to read it to you then said his wife unto him dust thou still retain th Integrity Curse God and die but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil and all this did not job sin with his lips God help us brother Benham said and standing in the Gap he said I wonder in this day of this loose lazy soft leodan age that we live in that's the age that we're living in that's the description loose lazy soft leoty in age that we're living in he tells us also that leoty is people's rights I have rights my rights and myself and I and all of this nasty stuff amen but but brother B said a lamp gives up its rights amen the bride give up her rights she turns herself over to her headship with his Christ she surrenders all to him it's no more Leo Dean condition for us because we don't have any rights if I had any right I exercise my right to give up my rights and give them all to him Amen brother B says God's only provided place of worship he says now if you get everything running just right it's going to run everything's set in order if there's a shorten that wire that light won't come on because it's been grounded and when you'll take one of God's words or one of his places and in your own heart have selfish objectives it'll ground the power of God right there even in taking the word of God or the promise of God if our objective is selfish to serve self he said it'll Crown the power right there and the power won't come to produce the word he says the motive and the objective has to be right right amen that's what job was telling his wife won't we accept good from the Lord and evil like we must accept whatever the Lord sends we must accept it from the hand of the Lord not just good but if he wants me to go through this trial then I must accept it as from the lord it's going to work good amen and we ground the power right there Amen in the message standing in the gap brother Bram says I've never regarded myself anybody knows this but people have said brother brandham the Lord called you to be his Prophet I've never regarded myself as that but I begin to get to that time that I was about ready to do it to think well maybe I am if I am I'll live back in the wilderness and if I live back in the wilderness then be his Prophet see and then if he wants to send me somewhere while he's not using me then I'll sure to catch some fine fish and do some things said of course that was kind of selfish attitude see because I wanted to do that now it isn't just exactly the thing that's to do and now I had that made up in my mind to do that we understand really well standing in the Gap brother Brenham is struggling with himself do you know who brother man's struggling with and standing in the Gap his own flesh he's offended because the people haven't heard him he thought they ought to hear his message he's feeling an old rejection complex that came through childhood and he's wanting to run away to the Wilderness to get away from the pressure that's what that's what he's dealing with he's dealing with himself and he comes up with a plan and he puts a religious cover on the plan and I hope you'll forgive me for talking about the Prophet this way but it's the truth his plan was if I'm a prophet like they say I'm a prophet then prophets don't live like this they don't spend all their time with the people they don't have all these means they go away to the Wilderness they get a message from God they stomp out they deliver the message and they go back back and so he looks he's looking at scripture but the reason he was looking at scripture was to justify the desire of his own heart to get away from rejection to get away from the people to go hunting and fishing which is what he wanted to do and he said that wasn't right that was kind of a selfish attitude cuz that's what I wanted to do why was that so tempting for the prophet amen there was two reasons it was tempting for the prophet one he had a rejection complex because he was a child and he was feeling the pain of an offense of people rejecting his ministry and second he loved to hunt and fish so in this temptation he had a push and a pull and when he could find the scripture to go with it he was ready amen but he said that was just me I wanted to do that and God come along and stopped him and showed him that if you go on with your plans you'll become a bum and your wife won't stay up there with you why because he was choosing self and self would have brought destruction God help me to stop choosing self that's my prayer you know brother Brandon wasn't I don't think even exactly realizing what was going on inside of him he was under turmoil he was struggling with himself and he had this pressure that he want to get away from he had this pain of rejection that was coming he had this desire to be free and to be in the wilderness all of this was stirred up inside of him and I don't even know that he consciously was aware of what was happening but when God come down and spoke to him all of a sudden he realized and he came back and standing in the Gap and he was able to confess and be honest and he say that was just me that was my desire that was self that was selfishness and if the prophet of God could struggle like that what about you and I friends what about the things that we go through and the things we want to be free from the situations we want to change in our life amen and sometimes we're willing to go through things to change those situations that aren't according to the word amen trying to come up with our own Solutions our own ideas and we don't realize that it may be pain inside it may be self that we're trying to save amen and what what brother Brenham had to end up doing he had to come to terms with the fact that God said I put more gifts in you than that you're you're in an Apostolic way you've got to go out and brother bham realized I let the sick people lay because of his own hurt and he realized he was going to have to go subject himself to the same pain to fulfill the purpose of God what was that man going to have to do go right back to the place where he was hurt prise God amen listen if God doesn't feel sorry for us do we have a right to feel sorry for ourselves God wasn't feeling sorry for the prophet and say you know I understand it's been hard if you want to go to the woods for a little while no he sent him right back to the place that he suffered the pain because that was his commission that was his calling and brother Brenham had to die to himself to go back into Commission it's not easy nobody said this life was going to be easy so many times we have to enter right back into the very place where we were wounded and hurt to what to fulfill the commission God has for us we would protect ourselves we would never let that happen again sure that doesn't mean God wouldn't we would never get ourselves in a position where I can get hurt like that again how many said something like that that's not God's attitude that's just ours he showed it in the prophet he showed it in you and I there so many times I've decided that I'm never going to let myself get hurt like that again I'm never going to subject myself I'm never going to open myself up like that I'm never going to find myself in that situation but God said says forget about it I mean he doesn't say it just like that but we have a commission we have a purpose friends we have to surrender our lives and let God have his way with us you know it's not it's not easy to preach the gospel to be misunderstood to be rejected it's not easy to be a pastor you know where I want to go Northern British Columbia Hunting fish yes right it's not easy to be rejected it's not easy to have somebody misunderstand and say things that are false about you it's not easy and sometimes I want to run away and I want to say I'm never going to let that happen again but then you sleep a little bit and you pray a little bit and you say where am I going to go what else can I do we all have a cross to carry we all have to nail ourselves to that cross guess what you've been hurt you've been hurt by people in church you've been hurt by your own family you've been hurt by whatever and guess what you're going to be hurt again if you're going to be where human beings are and you're going to be a human being I mean I'm sorry I wish I could paint the picture different but if you're going to be where humans are and you have a complex which we all do and you're going to be with other human beings with complexes hey guess what you're going to cry in your pillow again but does that give me the right to stay away from fellowship does that give me the right to forbid the forsaking assembling together of ourselves does it give me a right to reject the body of Christ does it give me a right to deny the word does that give me a right I don't think it does I think in Leo deia there's a people who say I give up my rights fulfill your word amen God if that's where you want me that's where I'll be amen if that's though he slay me yet will I serve him the prophet had to go right back on the field to people he knew didn't understand his ministry and ridiculed him he went right back and I'm so glad he did because the messages he preached after after this and he preached those messages in places where they were openly mocking him you know what we wouldn't have the message the Rapture if he didn't go back to a hostile environment and finish his commission there's many messages that he preached in the west coast at the end of his ministry and he was in the midst of a hostile environment there was a debate going on whether they would have him preach anymore at the businessman's fellowship because the wives of the leaders didn't like him because he was too hard on women and there was one man that stood up for him that was Carl will will is it will Carl Williams stood up for him and said as long as I'm here and I'm the I'm the Pres I'm the I think he was the secretary he said William brandham will preach at our meetings and he knew it brother brandham knew that he stood up for him and he knew that the others didn't want him and guess what he did he went back there and preached messages that you and I needed to hear yeah amen listen you may get wounded again opening yourself up and coming back but there's somebody who needs you here there's somebody who needs you in the fellowship somebody needs you in your family somebody needs you at work some wherever it is that God's plac you somebody need you there I needed the prophet to go back amen we need each other to stay in our post of Duty and finish the commission we need you know what we need we need to get over ourselves and I don't exactly know how to do that cuz I'm struggling with myself but I need to get over myself I need God to come and give me a strength that's Supernatural I need to lay myself be and say God I'm I'm I'm staying I'm staying engaged I'm staying in place but I need you to do something to heal this heart I need you to do something to give me strength I need you to do something that I can't do for myself I know where you want me and I'll stay where you want me but you got to do something for me I need a supernatural element to help me you know I believe the prophet God I believe he had a supernatural element that helped him through the end of his ministry he admitted that he had a selfish attitude he said no selfish thing will work just listen this is a quote that brother Benjamin he read when he preached last time when he was remember the story he was talking about brother mam Saul that there was a vein of oil down there those brothers were going after it and they said that they were going to use it for the missions and they went down there and started fussing amongst themselves and they didn't hit it and they asked brother Brenham to tell him where it was and he said he wouldn't because of their attitudes they got selfishness mixed in somebody else found it nearby and we heard all that story but brother B said it won't work no selfish thing will work prise God amen amen that's another one of those I need to write on the back of my hand and I just need to realize amen I I feel like being selfish I feel like giving into my myself I feel like doing what feels good but no selfish thing will work because the whole gospel is built on sacrifice Jesus said to his disciples he said take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart said oh God help me to be meek and lowly in heart that's what I need brother Brenham this is the last quote that I want to read to you out of a prisoner said and tonight if we as the brandham Tabernacle could only become prisoners to our own selfish being to our own ambition that we could completely surrender ourselves and be yolked to him no matter what the rest of the world thinks what the rest of the world does we're yolked with feathers of love we are prisoners amen he was speaking to the brandham Tabernacle but this is a message for you and I amen right here this morning yes if we could only become prisoners to our own selfish being to our own ambition that we could completely surrender ourselves and be yolked to him no matter what the rest of the world thinks what the rest of the world does we're yolked with feathers of love we are prisoners amen how many times have we heard the message a prisoner and how many times have we liked it and believed it's true yes but you know those chains of love that's a willfulness you're willingly because of love you're willing to follow but what if those chains of Love ask you to go back to the place where you were hurt the worst do we like the message prisoner then is that our favorite message when the Lord's asking us to enter back in to this relationship to go back to that Fellowship to go back to that family member it's great when everybody else is a prisoner it was fantastic that Paul was a prisoner I'm glad I'm so glad brother Brandon was a prisoner but now when it comes to me being a prisoner I like the idea but the daily practice is a little rough it's a little rough and the thing about this prison sentence is it's voluntary the gates are open the gates are open there's nobody there with a shot collar there's nobody there with real literal chains this is where we get to prove whether we have love for Christ or not whether we are a prisoner voluntarily with the chains of Love or whether we still love ourselves the most listen we we have a hard time denying ourselves a meal sweet can pray for a brother who's sick we have a hard time getting up early because of self I said God I want to be a love Slave To You Lord give me more of your spirit to overcome this self amen no matter how much we want God to do everything God's left something for us to do amen we so much want God to take away all the problems and make make everything and what we really want this is what I really want I really want God to pick me up move my arms and legs make me do everything so I don't do anything wrong and but God's put himself in partnership with man he's asking you to do some things too he's asking you and I to deny ourselves he's asking us to follow him he's asking us to surrender our will to his he's asking us to give up our rights for him and he's giving us plenty of opportunities to do it and if you don't think you have enough opportunities just wait you're going to get some more I mean so many of us are ready for the firing squad we're ready to take the final stand for the message the messeng or die we're ready to go down to the face the World Council churches stand before the tribunal take whatever comes our way but I'm not going to deny the message but the problem is not there the problem is in our homes in the morning in our minds in our car in our workplaces in ourselves that's where we've got to win the battle the tribunal may come but the tribunal is going to be victorious when we're victorious in this guy God I want to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ but I need your help and guess what he sent his help when he sent the word and when the word came the fullness of the Holy Ghost came back into the church if we'll just say that's the truth my mind's lying to me this selfishness is a lie but that word is the truth the spirit of that word will give us power to over overcome as we accept it and stop making excuses for oursel but being honest and just say it's not right this is what I want but it's not right this is the way I feel but it's a lying vanity this is what my my mind's telling me but I don't accept it anymore I accept what the word says amen oh friends life isn't easy I don't expect it to get easier you've been hurt I've been hurt you're going to get hurt again Paul got hurt went to the next city and got hurt went to the next city and got hurt then he got up and went to the next city and got hurt brother Brandon preached the sermon people criticized him he went and preached another sermon people criticized there's no way around it we just put our head down and plow say God you know what's best and when I am tried I shall come forth this well it's not me but there's something in me pushing me through this life I know that it's temporary every hurt is temporary all the pain is temporary rejection is temporary criticism is temporary physical pain is temporary mental anguish is temporary depression is temporary It's All Temporary but there's a glory that lays ahead let us take our cross and walk towards the glory that lays ahead we can despise The Shame of the suffering absolutely we hate it but I love what's coming more than I hate The Shame of the of the son suffering said God give us strength to deny ourselves to take up our cross to follow you according to this word man let's all Stand Together musicians if you'll come and brother Ben please come and let's just bow our heads together and let's pray I don't know about you but I I find myself in need Lord God lord all we can say is that you are good and you do all things well your word is true and every other word is a lie God I realize like never before that I am the problem that self is the problem this hybrid flesh that I live in with a fallen mind God I need the renewing of My Mind by your word I need to hear your word receive your word surrender to your word God I pray you forgive us for yielding to the dictates of the flesh forgive us for our complaining forgive us Lord for our transgressions yes forgive us Lord that we spoke evil against the things that you meant for our good forgive us for grumbling and complaining when you're trying to bring us to Perfection God help us to surrender God I need a greater dose of surrender and I need your help to do so but I see it as my commission in this day I see it Lord as the plan that you have for me and it's what I want I see that the Apostle Paul was your prisoner I saw that your prophet in this age was your prisoner ER I've seen my brothers and sisters imprison themselves to your word and surrender and it gives me courage to do the same Lord I want to have feathers of Love attach me to you and I want to follow you wherever you lead regardless of what it does to me physically God I'm sorry for the times that I felt sorry for myself and complained in my mind and pulled away from obedience to your word I'm sorry Lord but God I'm praying that you come and that you would do for us like you did for Samson when Samson had time to think on his ways when he had time to reflect on his selfishness self-love how he got into the condition that he's in when he had time Lord to think on those things he came to one conclusion Lord let me die let me die with my enemies Use Me Lord God as we've heard your word and we reflect Lord on what you're speaking to us I just want to say Lord let me die let me die to my enemy of self let me surrender Lord to you that you might take me and you might win the victory through me for I know it won't be my strength it won't be my wisdom it won't be my abilities but it will only be my surrender that allows your strength and your word and your ability to work through me so God I must surrender for you're a gentleman and you don't force but God I want you to have your way I want to go right back into the place where I was hurt if that's what you want I want to go right back and do the thing that caused rejection if that's what you want I want to go right back to serve and right back to the place that you would have me if that's what you want for God I know that you do all things well and that you make no mistakes and you're not making a mistake with my life God I want you to have the victory in Me God I pray that you would take each one of us in your hand pour your spirit out upon us Lord let the spirit of this word that was preached find a home may this word that was preached come to life inside of us may we have resolve and strength Beyond human strength may your spirit move us Lord to surrender in a greater way to bring this flesh subject to your word may we be like Paul Lord as we're striving for the Mastery may we keep under our bodies to keep it subject to this word so that we'll not be found to Cast Away but may we be found in the center of your will serving your purpose come rain or shine good days bad days may we be serving your purpose through it all and may we rejoice in your goodness to carry us through and God give us a Clear Vision of what lays ahead that we might have the courage and the strength to press on God bring a greater revelation of the millennial Reign the greater revelation of the marriage supper the greater revelation of a theophany body Lord may it give us courage to press on because we know Lord at the end of this journey is the greatest rewards far greater than we could ever mention far greater we could ever imagine God help us to look ahead God we love you we ask your blessings over all that's said and done may you use the word to shape us into your image may you take the sword of the word may it cut everything away that's not like you so that you can shine forth in our lives we love you I
