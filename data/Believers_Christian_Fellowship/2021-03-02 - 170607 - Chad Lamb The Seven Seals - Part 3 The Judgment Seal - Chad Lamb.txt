wow this is a treat on a wednesday night brother praise the lord let's turn to john chapter 16. verse 33. john chapter 16 and verse 33 i i want to minister i want to keep going down the avenue that i've been going down and i want to preach on the judgment seal which brother branham is what brother branham called the sixth seal he calls the sixth seal the judgment seal so we want to preach on the judgment seal this evening let's read john chapter 16 verse 33 together these things have i spoken to you that that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world hallelujah let's pray the heavenly father we thank you lord for your word god as it becomes more alive before our eyes we cannot help but just stare at you in amazement and wonder at all that you've done how after so many years you can continue to unveil yourself lord out of the same scriptures we've read hundreds of times lord out of the same message books we've read dozens of times but yet lord you continue to unveil yourself it just shows how amazing you are how there's no limits no boundaries the depths we cannot reach the bottom of your depths lord we can't climb to the highest of your heights but lord we're still trying to discover lord we're just trying to chase after you just to see you lord i pray that you would just continue to unveil yourself to us lord that you would take control of these lips lord and they would speak only your word lord let your truth come forth let me see you let us all see you afresh tonight lord like we've never seen you before and that you would continue to draw us nearer to you for as we see you lord we see ourselves because we're looking at you as though we're looking in a mirror lord reflecting off of the word and i just pray god that you didn't make it clearer to us than it's ever been before we love you we give you our lives and we surrender unto you in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated um have finally got a vacation plan for our family so we're going to be leaving in the morning and i literally made my reservation and booking last night at nine o'clock at night and i said i have never done this before my kids are like dad you're crazy usually if we're going to do anything we have it well established months in advance we have it planned we have envelopes of money set aside we know everything that's going to happen and this time it was absolute last minute crazy and i think we're going to have a wonderful time i think god's trying to break my mold a little bit and get me to loosen up a bit but we're excited so we just appreciate your prayers while i'm gone brother craig is going to minister this sunday june 11th and then next wednesday brother bob brooks is going to minister for us so be praying for them and come expecting i also want to announce we've got some brothers traveling overseas coming up the following week brother craig and brother rich lavie are going to be traveling to new zealand into australia and i believe they're leaving june 14th is that right brother rich 14th yeah june 14th and they'll be gone about 14 days so keep them in prayer they're doing two countries on the other side of the globe so keep them in prayer that god will use them and bless them and then brother emmanuel sebastian brother kyle weikert are going to haiti they leave the next day june 15th through the 19th so they're just a long weekend but but i'm really excited about that trip also because they need to follow up with that little group that was started after brother kyle and brother elmer went there a couple years ago and so i'm just really excited to see what god will do there so please keep them in prayers i'm just excited because god is good and he's always doing something something always an organism is always moving and growing and shifting it doesn't stay stagnant when it stays stagnant we know it's beginning to die and we don't ever want to stay stagnant we want to keep flowing and keep growing and keep moving that's exciting i also want to make sure i remind everybody that this sunday is going to be our first summer potluck carry-in so uh we're taking care of the meat and the drinks sister mom and brother nate are really good at working on that but they could use some help cleaning up so just remember that keep that in mind volunteer services so that they can eat their meal and visit with people and then go home and then we'll take care of cleaning it up so god bless you if you want to help with that that'd be wonderful i only wish i would be here for that but lord willing we'll be at the next one so god bless you i want to get into this sixth seal which brother branham calls the judgment seal and and i started looking at the seals and and you know from the last couple of services that we've ministered that that god is really beginning to open some things up for me and another perspective and i just want to share these things with you and i got a feeling we're going to be here for a long time because it's very exciting we find that that brother branham's ministry is an exact match to the scriptures so like when you read this word this word is layered right you can read the scriptures and you can read the scriptures and you can get a moral code of conduct out of the scriptures and that's a good thing you can find out what you should do and shouldn't do you know what's wisdom what's wise what'll bring the blessings of god what'll bring destruction from god you can read this book and you can gain a moral code of of conduct for your life and that's good there's nothing wrong with that but then you can read this book and you can also see the path of the holy spirit from genesis through revelations what he's done before what he's doing now and what he'll do in the future that's wonderful also but you can keep going deeper in the layers of the bible until you get down and you can begin to unlock the mystery of who god is and then you can go down and you can begin to unlock the mystery of who you are so you can take this bible and you can read it at one level and maybe you can go to the next level but the children of god in the last days are keep going deeper and deeper and deeper in this word as it as it moves off a single dimension double dimensions it's 3d it's going beyond that it's becoming living living flesh living life all around us right and so we find the message of the hour is very much the same exact way because brother branham is a word prophet so you would expect if isaiah if isaiah the prophet could come and say something that would have multiple meanings over time and it would have multiple fulfillments and there'd be a natural and a spiritual type to what isaiah said what about when another word prophet comes on the scene will it be the same way i mean we're still reading isaiah and isaiah is still unlocking hyundai thousands of years later we're reading ezekiel and ezekiel is still unfolding amen haggai is still unfolding in the day that we live in and so what do we think is going to happen with the message he's a word prophet it's going to keep unfolding and so that's the way the revelation of the seven seals is because i remember i remember for years i've read the seals we love the seals and we all understand that the seven seals the revelation of the seven seals it is the climax of brother branham's ministry he's looking forward to it for years he talks about it he preaches it while it's going on he's saying this is just a tremendous week there's so many wonderful things are happening he's saying are you catching what's going on i mean he's telling you what a marvelous event this is and then he gets beyond the seals and he's continually pointing back to him and saying that that was it you know that was the highlight of my ministry that was you know and after that he starts saying things like you know i must decrease he must increase and and there won't be two of us here at the same time and he's saying things at the at the end of his ministry but he's always pointing back to the seals but i have to confess when when i would read through the seals i would take you know first seal second seal third seal and you begin to read through it and you begin to notice that brother branham is him hauling around and and he's telling stories and and you know i went and prayed for this person today and and all this and and all this stuff he's telling and then he gets to the actual facts of the seal the the this word means this and this happens in this time and this will happen in the future and he preaches the whole seal in like 10 or 15 minutes and then after he goes back to telling stories and him hauling around and and i'm thinking he could have preached each seal in 10 or 15 minutes right am i the only one who thought that and we realized this is like the most important thing that he did was priest of revelation of the seven seals he said the whole bible is bound up in those seven seals and the revelation of the seven seals reveals the whole entire bible and how could he unlock the whole bible in 15 minutes a night and i began to realize that the stories are parables brother branham is teaching the seals exactly the same way jesus taught the seals because jesus taught the seals in matthew 24 and he starts talking and he's laying out the seals and he gets down and as soon as he finishes the sixth seal he doesn't say anything about the seventh seal and as soon as he's done he says now listen to the parable of the fig tree right when the fig puts forth its buds know that summer is nigh and the and the disciples are sitting here they've got questions they want answers to and here he's he like covers the whole seals in just a few verses and then he starts into parables telling parables and the parables are revealing the seals the parables he's telling you what he's trying to get you to catch but you have to understand that when jesus was there in matthew 24 he was speaking to the disciples they asked a question and he was revealing parables and the parables were telling more of the story but he wasn't speaking the parables for the disciples sake because the disciples never understood what he was talking about there was never a day until this day that we know what it means when the fig tree puts forth his bud know that summer is nigh because now we know that's when israel moves back into the homeland and becomes a nation again so now jesus was giving the parable and he was giving the seal but he wasn't doing it for the crowd that was listening he was doing it for you and i could brother branham have preached the seals the same way he's a word prophet amen say it's the same thing over and over once you see the pattern the pattern repeats the most important thing in the scriptures is to catch the pattern to see what god's doing brother branham in the sixth seal said this this is all just christ and antichrist what's he saying he's saying the whole revelation of the seals the whole revelation of the bible the whole thing is revealing christ in antichrist because back in heaven before there was the earth created there was rebellion in heaven and lucifer and his angels rebelled against michael and his angels right and that battle came down to earth and what we're seeing in genesis through revelations is christ and antichrist battling it out genesis exodus levitic what are they doing it's christ an antichrist all the way through that's why when brother branham gets to the seals he says this is just christ an antichrist why he's revealing the whole story of the bible and see theologians make big time mistakes when they start reading the bible and they start trying to find the history get the archaeology to match the history that's in the bible and the order of the kings and and get all the details just like we used to do to the seals get all the details and the historical events and where it placed and what it all means and to get it all lined up and they missed the story because it's a story of redemption it's a love letter it's a story amen of what was in the back part of god's mind what he wanted to accomplish i mean that's why i love christ as the mystery of god revealed so much brother branham comes down and he doesn't load you down with facts and figures and details and dates he's telling you the story he's telling you the theme of this entire bible is one theme one idea one objective that god wanted to accomplish and it had three parts to it and so now you can listen to christ as the mystery of god revealed and you can go back and he says if you can't find christ in every line and every verse read it again why it's the whole thing is christ crowd is christ christ is the mystery of god revealed so whenever the mystery of god is revealed that's christ that's why you're christ and i'm christ because we're part of that mystery of god being revealed in this day so we are part of that and so now what brother branham's doing is he's telling us the story and we've been looking for the facts the details the same thing the theologians have done to the bible is the same thing i'm guilty of in doing to the seals not that i did it on purpose and not that i've done it intentionally but i just didn't know what to do because god has a timing for everything god has a revelation that has to come in the final days there has to be a rapturing faith that comes to the church and i would pose this question to you is it possible to come to rapturing faith before the time of the rapture why because rapturing faith will rapture you there's nothing that can hold back rapturing faith that's why when you have faith for your healing there is nothing that can stop your healing because everything in the kingdom of god operates by faith so once you receive rapturing faith you will take a rapture so god has to keep a cap has to keep a veil until the time is right till the last one comes in so he can peel back this veil so his bride can take a rapture all at once it doesn't do any good for somebody to rapture 20 years ago amen and then me to rapture today and somebody else 20 years from now that's not that's not the way the scripture is written so we have to say i i had to say god show me what i'm missing in your time in your season not not that we twist and manipulate till we get it figured out but as you reveal more we walk into it as the leather layer peels back we step into that layer and we enjoy that layer because hey that just explains the the last 50 years of the message has been peeling back another layer and the believer's stepping into that layer and enjoying everything and then peeling back another layer and stepping into the layer and we're doing the same thing now it's going to continue until we all come to rapturing faith and take a body change so that's why i want to spend some time on these seals and so we look at the judgment seal and we recognize we we all know the sixth seal so i'm not going to go into the the details of the facts of the future of the six seals because you can read those and you know those we know that the sixth seal cracked open at world war ii and brother branham didn't say it closed back it cracked open because tribulation began at world war ii the sixth seal and it carries through to the time of the great tribulation and when it when it opens wide open in great tribulation and brother branham said what opens that seal he said those two witnesses in revelations 11 moses and elijah that go to israel they open up that seal because under that seal plagues fall out upon the earth and and it's given to those two to bring plagues upon the earth so they're the ones who open that seal wide open they're the ones who bring on tribulation it's beautiful so then we find out that the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal sound at the same time because the sixth trumpet is the second woe there's three woes after the fourth seal whoa whoa whoa and to the habitants of the earth and that's world war one world war ii and world war three we're not laboring on this i'm just giving you a snapshot world war one's the fifth seal world war ii is the second seal so if the if this or the sixth deal i'm sorry the second world war is the six sixth trumpet so if the sixth trumpet is world war ii and the sixth seal cracked open at world war ii persecution against the jews then the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal run together okay we talked about this sunday where the seventh is revealed in the sixth that's the way it always was through the bible so these are these are the facts and the details and we know that plagues have come upon the earth and under the sixth seal there's going to be a purging of the earth a destruction of the people a destruction of the planet to get the earth in condition for the millennium so that's all under the sixth seal from the world war ii everything that's happening and we have to realize everything that's going on around us is under the effect of the sixth seal we put it back here in world war ii and we try to put it over here in the tribulation period but we don't realize that sixth steel cracked open and it began to move things in place what did it begin to do it began to unite world powers it began a war and it began pushing the jews into their homeland and we're still under the effects of the sixth seal the six seals cracked open and it's still working and it's still moving along with the sixth trumpet and so we can't we don't wanna put this over here we don't wanna put this over there we're living in the effects of it amen so don't ever don't ever put these things somewhere else let's take these things home and say why what what is going on for me what is going on today what is going on in my life because brother venom said the revelation of this of the seven seals he says it it reveals the whole bible we got that now the bible is christ in word form in letter form we got that then paul looks at his disciples and he says you are written epistles he said the word is written not in tables of stone but in the flesh in the fleshly hearts right so now the word is written in you and you become the living word or the manifestation of the word and now you're the word right so if the seals unlock the mystery of the entire scriptures and you've got scripture in you and you're part of the scriptures and there's word in you and you're part of the word then the seals must also unlock your life so the seals reveal the word and you're the word the seals have to reveal you and so there's so much more going on when brother branham's preaching the seals than just the information about the tribulation period that's super important and we need to know that but there's something for me today there's a mystery unlocking my life in the sixth seal and the judgment seal that i will understand me better and my purpose on this planet and what god is doing with me and how my word is being unveiled hallelujah oh who wants to go read the seal book all over again i mean it's not just the facts and it's not just the figures i'm the word this reveals the word this takes the mystery off the word it takes the mystery off of me now i can look back over my life and understand every transition everything i'm going through it all makes sense because i'm part of the word and god works with me like he works with his people in the word so what he did with ruth he does with me what he did with esther he does with me amen what he did with this he does with me and if i could see the seals unlock the mystery and ruth it'll unlock the mystery in me because once god sets the pattern he keeps the pattern pattern doesn't change hallelujah god it's amazing to me that when brother branham preaches the seals he starts with god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself the same it's the all you have to do is see the pattern and the pattern repeats it's so simple a child can understand but the problem is right here we make it so complicated by trying to figure the dates and the sequence of events and and we're missing the story you can do the same thing with the bible sequence of events and this king was before that king and chronicles has this name and kings has this name what are the dates and and you're missing the whole point not so that you can have an accurate knowledge of history of the of the jewish lineage of kings that's that's not the point the point is to catch the mystery in the word the point is to catch christ in the bible to see that this is the unveiling of god this is christ moving down through the ages god coming into materialization and materialization so that he can be seen and felt and heard from and known hallelujah praise god hallelujah so so when we look at this sixth seal the judgment seal we have to realize and i know i'm not taking the seals in order i know you have first second third and i know i've talked about the seventh seal for a couple services and now i'm talking about the sixth seal you just have to forgive me i can only go by inspiration i can't mechanically go to the first seal and work forward this is where i'm at and i this is what you got so i i don't even think we'll do them all backwards i don't even know where we'll go from here but i know we've done the seventh and we're going to do the sixth or at least take a take a little look at it tonight so for the sixth seal brother branham preaches a message i believe it was in 1953 called israel in the church and way back in 1953 he sets a pattern and that pattern has to continue and the pattern is israel and the church are on parallel tracks one natural one spiritual and he and he shows us this in the first exodus what happens in the first exodus happens at the second exodus what happens in the second exodus happens in the third exodus so we find out now paul picks up this same thing and he says in hebrews he says now these things were written for our examples what what happened to israel now paul is preaching amen he's preaching to the new testament church and he's saying the same thing israel and the church that they type one another that they parallel one another so what you see god doing with the with israel he does with the church and so now we we can take this principle and it and once the pattern starts it never stops pattern repeats we got that this is simple stuff pattern repeats so now if there was a first exodus there has to be another exodus so so now we find in the seals if we look at the natural of the sixth seal the sixth seal cracking open had a purpose and world war ii had a purpose and what did brother branham tell us the purpose of world war ii was he said it was the tender hand of jehovah driving the jews back into their homeland so that they could eat of the tree of life so if that's what he was doing for the jews what is the sixth seal doing in my life hallelujah and then we realized too that the sixth seal when it comes in fullness under the plagues in the three and a half year tribulation it's purging the world it's destroying all that that needs destroyed and cleaning off the earth and renovating it for a millennium now in the natural if the sixth steel the judgment seal will take the earth the natural thing and destroy it and purge it and cleans it for a millennium what is it doing to my soul what is it doing to me is the judgment seal now we're coming the scripture says judgment must begin at the house of god so we can't ever say that judgment is not for the church judgment is absolutely for the church but the great white throne judgment has nothing to do with the bride but the scripture says judgment must begin at the house of god we got that so we have the judgment seal the sixth seal working in our life and if the six seal works in our life and it burns you down and it tears you to pieces and it pour plagues out upon you all it's doing is renovating you for your rest holy ghost rest the millennium is a type of the holy ghost so you cannot come to the holy ghost without passing through the sixth seal you cannot get to the millennium so we find out that we ourselves have to pass through the judgment seal now the seals are unlocking the mystery in my life i remember coming to the message desperately seeking the holy ghost and i remember being renovated i remember agony and distress and travail of soul i remember knowing that i was all wrong and i remember knowing that i was never going to be right i remember realizing there is no good thing in me no not one that wasn't a scripture verse that was my prayer why i was under the sixth seal i was under the judgment seal amen the hand of god was coming down on me in conviction and what was happening he was trying to renovate me for the millennium for my holy ghost rest i was going to move into rest but you cannot move into rest without the sixth seal and you cannot have the sixth seal without judgment and repentance and recognizing how fallen you are and how desperately you need him and how you're nothing it will never be nothing and you're deserving of all the plagues that are going to be poured out in your life and you deserve every single one of them plus more and if you come to that then you're being renovated for the millennium then you're on your road to entering into the rest now recognize that when when solomon now i i i don't have very many notes i don't have a well laid out plan all i've got is a heart that is absolutely full so if you're poor i may jump all over the place but i want to paint this picture for you when solomon comes into his throne if we remember when brother abraham myra was here and he was preaching on these things brother uh brother uh abraham taught to us about solomon coming to the throne and solomon is the son of david and so israel and the church so solomon is only typing christ taking the throne of david in the millennium and so we find out when solomon comes to his throne solomon cannot move the church into millennium he cannot bring them to the seventh seal until first solomon passes the church through the sixth seal because david david never passed judgment on the israelites the man who spit on him he let him go all right joab who killed abner he let him go all of these things he let go he never brought judgment because the scripture says that god giveth all judgment to the son so once he sets the pattern he keeps the pattern if god is going to give all judgment to the son then david has to give all judgment to solomon and so now solomon comes on the scene and david said don't forget jimmy i don't forget joab don't forget those don't forget them why because he's given all judgment to the son don't you love the word of god catch the pattern pattern never changes so now solomon has to begin judgment at the house of god solomon's not judging philistines or hittites or any other nation solomon now is judging israelites he's purging the church of all the spirits that came against god all right and after he purges them all and he has this period of judgment what happens to the nation of israel they move into a millennium why because under the judgment of solomon he brought them through the judgment seal the sixth seal so that they could enter into rest the pattern never changes that's happened to israel that's going to happen to the whole world but what happens to you and i yeah brother branham said whenever we come to church on sunday every sunday is judgment we come to the judgment seat every sunday so that our lives can be judged by the word so that we can look at this word and say god burn me down i am no good there is nothing good on me why because every time you come to the sixth seal you get a fresh revelation of the seventh every time oh if you think about this pattern is established in the scriptures if you go back now the seals reveal the mystery of the whole bible right so now we understand moses's life because moses could never come to the burning bush until first he at first he had to be rejected amen he had to go into the wilderness and he had to be in the wilderness under judgment for 40 40 years 40 is the number of judgment and after he passes through the sixth seal then he sees the pillar of fire in the burning bush he comes to isaiah 6 he gets cleansed with a coal of uh off of the fire off of the altar and he gets recommissioned and he goes back and look what he does after the six seal judgment that he couldn't do before this is the pattern the pattern never changes look at samson samson was born to be a deliverer all right and he began to deliver from the philistines but you have to understand that the pattern has to hold true so so samson he does things that are wrong things that are not right right so he comes into judgment and we find him under the sixth seal and he's grinding at the meal with his eyes poked out he's working for the system all right he has no revelation no eyesight working for the system laboring right but what happens he begins to get a fresh revelation of the seven seals growing out of his head and after he's come to tribulation after he has come to judgment after he's come through the sixth seal then he gets a fresh revelation he gets back in his commission like isaiah did see none of these men these all of these men that were talking about isaiah leaning on uzziah right having to come to a fresh revelation woe is me a fresh commissioning same thing with moses same thing with samson same thing with the apostle paul they were all god's men before the sixth seal and they were all god's men after the sixth seal samson comes out and he has a revelation and he comes to repentance sixth seal always brings the children of god to repentance that's the key is repentance isaiah come to repentance samson come to repentance these men come to repentance and and he says god forgive me samson comes then and it says when he gets his recommissioning after sixth seal it says he killed more in his death than he killed in his life why he came through the sixth seal the apostle paul the apostle paul comes on the scene he's smitten by a pillar of fire he's struck blind ananias comes and lays hands on him and it says right there he immediately goes into the synagogue and preaches christ right he has no success so he's got to go to the wilderness for three and a half years in the wilderness of arabia before he can get the proper commission for his ministry so here he he he comes to the lord he he's filled with the holy ghost he goes right out and he begins preaching in the synagogue but we find out something didn't go right something wasn't right because he had to go into the wilderness in arabia for three and a half years amen but when he came out of there look at his ministry something changed for moses something changed for samson something changed for the apostle paul if you think of all the disciples now every one of those disciples they they hear the call from god jesus christ calls them himself they enter into the ministry they're casting out devils wonderful things are happening but they've got to come to the sixth seal so now their chief captain they see him hanging on a cross and he's dead and he lay him in a tomb and now they are all going through tribulation they're all going through judgment peter is a perfect example we watch peter the crows three the third time he runs out and he weeps bitterly what is he's under judgment peter's in the sixth seal and once he starts to pattern keeps the pattern now you see why the seals unlock the mystery of the bible now we see the pattern pattern holds up peter's in the pattern but what's going to happen is is peter is going to get a fresh revelation and he's going to get it at pentecost and after the fire falls amen at pentecost and he's burnt with a coal off of the fire of the altar amen then look at peter's commission then see the pattern never changes pattern keeps up keeps going pattern never stops so now we find that this judgment seal is so much more it's so much more than just the tribulation period right the scriptures talk about talk about a lot of these things brother branham says in the message i know he says why does god god let troubles come god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god there had been no rainbow until the flood came but after noah was pressed into that condition that he was in now think about this no one was pressed into the condition that he was going to see the rainbow the covenant of the lord after he's pressed in that condition what did the sixth seal do to the jews it pressed them into a condition what was it doing for the believer judgment and tribulation puts them in position what did it do in your life put you in position and when you get out of position and the chastening hand of the lord comes and brings judgment what is he doing he's putting you back in position this is first corinthians 11 judge yourself but if you're judged we're supposed to judge ourselves but if we fail to judge ourselves when you are judged you are chastened of the lord that you will not be condemned with the world god's chastening is not to condemn you with the world if you do not come to judgment on your own then the sixth seal comes upon you afresh and the chastening of the lord comes so that you will not be in position with the world but that you'll get back in position with the word thy rod and thy staff they comfort me the whole word is built on this cycle all of the scriptures my life is this cycle this plays out daily weekly in my life we've had major six seal events in our life but then we have minor six seal events in our life amen and it's always it's always you come to the chastening hand of the lord you come to repentance you come back to woe as me i'm i'm a man of unclean lips dwelling among a people of unclean lips and what happens he always puts you back in position he put isaiah back in position he put samson back in position he put moses back in position he put the disciples back in position do you see the pattern and we thought we were just getting in trouble we thought we were just making a bunch of mistakes it's the beauty of the sixth seal for the believer for the unbeliever it brings destruction for the believer it brings positional placement the seal does both for the unbeliever they're going to march right into destruction why because cain come under the hand of the sixth seal and what was cain's response under the sixth seal when when when isaiah comes under the hand of god he says woe is me when samson comes under amen the sixth seal he repents when cain comes under the judgment the judgment seal he says this is too hard for me you see the difference now judge your life are you cain or are you isaiah when things come down in your life god don't you know what's happened god this is too much how can you expect so much of me you're speaking just like cain and the seals have come to unlock the mystery of your life to put you in position to explain to you where you are and the plan of god are you on antichrist side or christ's side right and that way when now when trials come upon your life and this chastening hand of the lord comes to you amen now you don't say god this is too much god you're asking more this is more than i can bear why is this all happening now you say woe is me lord i'm wrong correct me lord make me right forgive me almighty god because if you can come to that point in the sixth seal you'll step right back into the seventh seal yes hallelujah do you see the pattern so simple a child could understand we could teach our our children this and they could start unlocking the mysteries out of the bible by revelation why because he he gave it to children to babes not to the wise and the learned but the babes and he said it in such a way that he could give a revelation and you get the key and when you get the key you just start unlocking unlock unlock unlock and lock and now all the doors fly open now we begin to understand things we've never understood before now our life becomes it starts to come in order it starts to make sense i start to comprehend solomon's bringing to me to millennium and before solomon can bring me to millennium he's got to purge the church and before god can bring me to millennium christ has to purge my church hallelujah thank god brother branham starts off the sixth deal i just want to i would really like while i'm on vacation if as many of you could start reading this this revelation of the seals please start reading it and start reading it a different way than we've ever read it before or at least a different way than i read it before start reading it and saying god let me see your story let me see your mystery but brother branham gets to paragraph three the very first thing he's saying right after he says hello he he does a real quick prayer right after he does the prayer he says you may be seated so good evening friends it's a privilege to be here again tonight to be in the service of the lord i was just a bit late i just went on an emergency of a dying man of a member of this church his mother is or comes here and they said the boy is dying right then so here he's coming to preach the sixth seal the judgment seal he prays he says be seated and he says i'm a little bit late because i was called out on an emergency for a dying man. it sounds like the man's in judgment and he says they said the boy is dying right then i went down to see a shadow of a man laying on a bed dying a man about my age and in just a moment's time i seen a man rise to his feet giving praise to the lord and so god if we will be willing to confess our sins and do that which is right ask for mercy call upon him god is willing and waiting to grant it to us he steps to the pulpit praise be seated and the first thing he tells is he reveals them the sixth seal there's a man laying here dying but i seen him in a few minutes ago from a dying man to raise you on his feet and if we will just repent and confess our sins and ask for mercy what is he telling us he just revealed the sixth seal in our lives in his opening statements and this is the part where i thought he was just him hauling around to get to his 15 minutes of explaining the seal missing the whole time this is exactly what he did when he come out and he began the whole series of the seal meetings with god hiding himself in simplicity and says i was just a little late getting the pulpit i had to marry a couple the whole thing's a wedding and then he goes right into the dedication of the church because he's dedicating the church and now he's doing this through the whole seals he gets to his ceiling he goes now did you recognize what was happening in the seals he's preaching the atonement right he's preaching christ who is the atonement coming on the scene the revealing of christ christ coming down and he says that little boy who was healed of leukemia he said did you catch that that little collins boy and then did you catch that healed leukemia what's leukemia leukemia is a blood disease what's being cured the blood disease the atonement cures the blood disease christ being restored to the church in full measure the holy ghost and fullness coming down is curing the blood disease and brethren he's not just telling stories he's not just jesus walking along they ask him a question he says i'll tell you a parable [Laughter] oh god open our eyes let us see what's going on all around us hallelujah oh i just love it friends he said in the sixth seal in paragraph 249 it's the eagle age that gets the word and the revelation and all that understands that raise up your hands that's good that's fine he said if you can get back here under these seals when they're open you can see exactly what god is doing what he has done and what he's going to do hallelujah is he not jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever is this not an eternal word with an eternal application and he says if you can if you can get back under these seals when they're open you can see exactly what god is doing what he has done and what he's going to do i say god show it to me reveal it to me afresh give me fresh eyes to see because why this is all christ an antichrist so what what am i trying to understand i'm looking at this these seals and they're unlocking the bible and i'm seeing christ and antichrist in every story in the bible remember once he sets a pattern he doesn't change it so if i can see what antichrist has done and every one of the believers down through and how he's brought deception then he's going to do the same thing today if i can see his tactic his battle plan his mode of operation then i can see in every age how christ countered it and now i can judge myself i can judge my condition and i can place myself in the scriptures why because the seals unlock christ and antichrist all the way down through the word they unlocked the battle plan of lucifer and the battle plan of michael and now i know lucifer is going to do this every time and christ is going to do this every time hallelujah i'm excited i just i feel like i want to go somewhere and read my whole bible over again cover to cover whole bible whole seven seals church age book and then i want to read it all and then start right back at the beginning read it all again because it is so absolutely wonderful and beautiful to see now brother branham is talking about the sixth seal and he's talking about tribulation and the calling out of the hundred forty four thousand and the two witnesses in in the in the great tribulation right that's what the sixth seal is about but he spends so much time talking about other stuff i mean like over an hour's worth of time and one of the main stories he gets into first is he starts talking about uh the tribulation period and 145 then he starts talking about you know there was that story of that armor boy whose dad owned the ranch in texas and he went down to look for a wife we're talking about the sixth seal tribulation period 144 000 we call it two witnesses right right so if all we understand on the sixth seal is the tribulation period the calling 144 thousand what is he talking about he goes down there and all the girls were fixed up and he didn't want any of them and he went out to look at the stars what is he talking about look at the stars and and he sees this washery woman and she's a cousin to all of them and she's an outcast orphan and he sees in her character and he says i wanted character not in any of them will you marry me and she she says yeah it's too much for me how can you and he says i've chose you i'll build you a house i'll come back and get you what story is he telling telling the story of christ and the bride why the six deals about the 144 000 and the two witnesses in the tribulation period what's he talking about he starts breaking it down and he starts saying now after he left she starts confessing and they start laughing at her making fun of her what's happening she's moving into persecution she's moving into her tribulation period and they say laughing and as that got closer she got her wedding dress and they saw her wedding dress and they laughed and said you silly child he's not coming for you and she's holding her confession what is it he's showing what the world council of churches is going to be doing to the bride under the influence of the sixth seal but the six seals about the tribulation period and two witnesses 144 thousand then why does he spend over an hour talking about everything but that why israel and the church natural and spiritual these seals unlock unravel the mystery of the scriptures and they unlock the mystery of your life so now now if you only if i could only preach it's like brother abraham he said i wish i was a preacher and i said oh my goodness if you're not a preacher i'm not even human you know and so i just brother bam said i wish i could give it like he showed it to me you know you're so limited as a human being but but if you can only see even the things that have been happening in my life over the last week i'm recognizing now that god is showing everything in shadows and types i'm seeing it all over the place it is an amazing place to be but you're seeing how this little woman now takes the promise and she takes the promise and she just starts repeating what her mate has told her the promise he's coming for me i'm chosen from him and all she's doing is just repeating what he said not her own words she's repeating what he said and it brings persecution from all the cousin churches the rest of the family turn on her and they begin to condemn her and chastise her and mock her why brother branham is showing what the world council of churches is doing to the bride and it gets worse as the time gets closer for her departure because if you go through the sixth seal you get the seventh what does the sixth seal do to the jews it puts them in position for the tree of life to receive the messiah what does the sixth seal do to you it puts you in position why because i rod in my staff they comfort me why because you're in laodicea with a fallen outer two realms to your being with a sticky cockleburn nature and you will backslide and get lazy and cool off but god will put you in position god will get out the sixth seal god will bring down the judgment and solomon will come to your life and he will start casting this out and casting that out and you'll fall back to woe is me almighty god forgive me and then he'll touch you with a coal off of the altar and put you back into your commission and you'll come back out wiser more dedicated more sincere and god that what's he doing amen he was only solidifying those all the persecution from the cousins all the pressure that was coming from outside was only solidifying her confession purging her from every other thought standing on this one thought he's promised me he's coming for me i must have the wedding dress on when he gets here what's he doing with us he's purging us he's focusing us and if he's got to use a rod he'll use a rod if he's got to use the world council of churches he'll use the world council of churches but he's got to get us in one position he's coming for me one thing to confess one thing to focus on he promised he's coming i've got to have the wedding dress on when he gets here hallelujah why it's under the influence of the sixth seal we're under the influence of the sixth seal what's he doing putting his people in position think about this he tells job he said i smite and i bind up i bruise and i heal who's saying that god you know job's having this issue and job's saying why is god letting this happen job didn't say one thing about the devil he didn't blame the devil he didn't accuse the devil he didn't give the devil any credit he said god's hand is upon me now think about this in the in the prophecy of joel when when there was sent out four insects the palmer worm the canker worm the locust and whatever caterpillar he sent them out and the god said mine great army that i send forth what did they do they destroyed the bride tree why did they destroy the bride tree because in the first age they began to deviate from the truth so god sent an army to tear it down so that he could rebuild it correctly and so he says mine great army that i send forth he tells job i smite i break and i mend i bruise and i bind up why this is god's pattern he's the good shepherd the good shepherd has a rod and the rod is to keep the sheep in position because it matters more than anything that we stay in position under this word confessing he's coming with the wedding garment on it's the thing that matters most in your life nothing else matters your retirement account doesn't matter your health doesn't matter your children don't matter as much as staying in position amen staying where you're supposed to be under the word in the body where you are supposed to be working that is the only thing that matters that's why if you begin to bring compromise into your life because we want to make the children more comfortable right god god is not here to make you comfortable your children comfortable god is not here to make your life a pleasure cruise he is here to get you in position to awaken you out of your spiritual amnesia to open the word to you to put you in position under that word and to keep you there till you manifest what you were designed to manifest on this planet god is not here for pleasure he's not here for entertainment he's here you're here to serve his purpose not yours god is not here sometimes when we have all this modern worship music that's nothing but the rock and roll and sensual and worldly i wonder who who is receiving glory in this worship who's being pleased whose pleasure is this is it pleasing the one being worshipped or is it pleasing the worshipper and we find out most of what is called worship is only satisfying the worshipper it is not doing anything for the one being worshiped and we realize that we can fall in the same trap in our lives our lives are supposed to be a life of worship a life of sacrifice you can reign with him if you suffer with him the bible doesn't say anything else amen and so now now we find out that we can worship god in a way that satisfies the worshipper i can live in compromise i can still be a message believer i can just deviate ever so slightly on his word because it makes me uncomfortable to toe the line so i find a way that's more comfortable for me to be a believer and i confess the message and come to church but i'm still a little bit comfortable and what you find out is you've deviated from the word and he will send his great army and you will get the palmer worm the cankerworm the caterpillar and the locust will tear you down to nothing so that he could bring you back up because you're out of commission you've missed the calling you're out of the word a slight deviation is out of the word and so now we find that god is constantly positionally placing us and we keep saying the devil's doing this the devil's doing this the devil doing this and god is trying to put us in position we're blaming the devil job didn't blame the devil so we're beginning to recognize the sixth seal is beginning to open our eyes to our world we're beginning to understand who we are and where we are and what we're supposed to do further in the message i know he says i don't even know where i'm at praise the lord he said must i be carried home when i to heaven on a flowery bed of eaves while others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas we ask for comfort and peace god gives us the best he could give us the sixth seal trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace our comforts is just beyond the river it wasn't until the hebrew children was forced into the fiery furnace on one of their most outstanding trials that they seen one like the son of god stand among them their troubles produced the son of god standing among them amen i ask you do you want the son of god standing among us then get ready for the fiery furnace but not until they went into the fire did the comforter appear it was daniel who had purpose in his heart that he had not defiled himself with the things of the world and was forced through a trial whether he'd pray to god or go to the lion's den but it was after it was after that he saw the angel of the lord standing in the midst of him keeping away that great pillar of fire standing between him and the lions and the lions could not get him because he'd went through the trials and temptations and troubles he knew that his god was able to deliver him from that it was abraham after he'd seen the ground get barren and the drought come and separate himself go down to live deliciously in the world it was after he had heard the whines and the cries of his herdsmen with no grass for the cattle but he maintained in the land that god gave him and told him to soar so jordan and as on that day after he had been tried his patience was at the end it was on that day that when after the trial was over he spoke face to face with elohim because the sixth seal always brings you to the seventh it was after he had suffered his trials after he went through the troubles that he'd been through that god appeared to him in the form of a man and sat there and told him he was married and his wife's name was sarah and said she'd laughed at him in the tent behind it was there that abraham called him elohim it was after the trial and tribulation oh if the church could only wake itself today to find that after the troubles and trials and laughs and the made fun of and the things that the church has been through the pentecostal church that we see god in our midst doing great signs and wonders further down he says all these great men that would take much of our morning service away to go in to mention that they went through trials and saw god they went through trials and saw angels they went through trials and revelations and saw signs and wonders and things but oh none of them saw what job saw all them men after seeing angels and seeing god and all these things they never saw nothing to give them hopes beyond the grave but job saw the resurrection he saw easter he saw the thing that comforts every heart then when he did all that my words words would be printed in a book all that they would be engraved with iron pen on a rock everything had turned against him even his servants wouldn't speak to him his wife was a stranger there he sat on an ash heap that great trial and the church come and turned their back to him for seven days and no one to comfort him where was he in the sixth seal then he must have saw a vision of easter when he cried i know my redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand on the earth i know oh that my words were pinned with an iron pin and stone that my words would never fade no more for i know my redeeming liberty i know i know we look at job's trials and all that he went through and everything that happened and there's a scripture in the book of job that says for six days you'll be troubled but in the seventh no evil will touch thee why job when he passed through his trials when he passed through his persecutions when he went through that what did he get he got the same thing isaiah got he got a fresh vision of the lord he said i know that though the skin worms destroy this flesh yet in my flesh i'll see him hallelujah we we have to understand that god's in control of everything what's he doing what is the sixth seal doing it is putting us in position what it does for israel it does for the bride of jesus christ if the sixtieth is putting israel in position the sixth seal is putting the bride into position hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah i don't even know what to say yet do you see it the sixth seal it's more than just the tribulation period three and a half years then the two witnesses that's it but it's more than that there's a tribulation period in your life there's a travail of soul there's anguish of spirit there's bringing about a new birth in our life like brother benjamin was talking about there's a burning down of the earth and making it new again we've all had to pass through the burning down of our earth if you've come to the new birth you've come to the burning down of your earth into the new creation and then god continues the walks walks us through this pattern of sixth seal bringing us to the seventh and we say oh it's too much why did this happen this isn't fair oh my goodness that's cain speaking but if you're a child of god nothing comes into your life unless first it passes the sacred desk of jehovah and he signs off on every child that trial that comes in your life and we just think somebody did me wrong somebody mistreated me god is trying to positionally place you you should get on your knees and say thank you god for this trial thank you god for the scourging thank you for the chastisement lord let me get up from here and put me right in position where i'm supposed to be that's why every child who got a proper discipline growing up and was raised in boundaries and had parents who would keep putting them in position putting them in the position they'll come back and say thank you mom thank you dad i appreciate that you didn't hold back that you punished me you took care of me you kept me on the straightener what were they doing they were using the sixth seal to put you back in position back in position back in position and you get down to the years where you have little children and you're raising a family and you say oh i'm so grateful but when god is putting you back in position this isn't fair this is too much why are they doing this to me why is all this happening to me we need to say thank you lord put me in position lord if there's if i'm wrong if i'm out of position if i've got wrong thinking if i've got wrong practices in my life god scourge me strip me down burn me to the ground and make me new because this is the only thing the elect wants the only thing they can think about is get in the land get in the land find my inheritance and get in my inheritance this end time there's a pool on the saints of god there's something drawing the saints of god and what's drawing them the word is calling amen it's calling your name what's it calling you for it's calling you to a position right israel is getting called back to a position look at what happens under the sixth seal they come back in in revelations chapter seven brother bernstein's talking about it says in this tribe so many thousand this tribe so many thousand this tribe so many thousands what does that mean when you name the tribe they know exactly what portion of land is theirs they know what part of the word belongs to them they know they know what they're supposed to be doing in that part of the land they know we over here we grow wheat over here we fish over here we mine right it's a positional placement and brother bam said when they come to this time they don't know what tribe they belong to the jews have been dispersed their records have been scattered they don't know if i'm in benjamin i don't know if i'm in dan i don't know if i'm natalie i don't know where i am and what position they place them it's those two prophets of revelations 11 and they hear their name and they find out their position in the body and under a prophetic ministry under an eagle anointing under the sixth seal what's being happened they're saying you seven thousand you're part of ephraim oh ephraim as soon as you say ephraim i know what portion that that moses allotted for ephraim i know what ephraim is supposed to be doing i know what part of the country it's in i know what the topography of that country is in i know what the job is for ephraim and under the under the eagle anointing he's calling out that you're in ephraim amen you're in naphtali you're in judah you're in benjamin what's the sixth seal doing the sixth seal is putting them in position on their land and what is the sixth seal doing to you and i it is putting us in position in the word and whenever we get off of the word the rod is putting us back in position in the word because there is a predestinated position in this word for me and god is going to have every one of us in position fulfilling our role before the rapture takes place and what is moving the elect into position now remember the sixth seal only puts the elect in position it drives everything else to the battle of armageddon the elect go to position under the sixth seal and the sixth seal destroys everything else it's good to be elect but you know what everybody cries under the sixth seal rocks fall on me mountains fall on me hide me from the wrath of the lamb that's cain's generation but the elect say god exposed me stripped me down lord forgive me put me in position they don't crawl into the caves in the dens and cry out for the rocks to hide them from the lamb they're running to the lamb and saying lamb o lamb of god judge me from your throne o solomon purge me by your coal of fire take all the iniquity out of me and put me in position in my land let me live the exact position you've called for me to live without compromise amen without deviating one step keep me here o lamb of god let me come under the judgments of the lamb and if that's the elect's attitude then the elect is going to go to another judgment one day and it just happens to be that brother branham finishes the sixth seal with a story he said i just want to tell you something he said i've never told this in public before radar goes off ding ding ding we're in the sixth seal he's going to tell another unrelated story unrelated to the tribulation period and the two witnesses and he says i had a vision the other day and i was standing with a group of people there was a big throne and christ was sitting there and they were calling names like ormond neville and they would come out everybody be patting them on the back and say way to go god bless you brother and he would go up to this thing he'd say enter into the joys of the lord my faithful servant and he would go into this light what's he talking about the judgment seal what judgment is this it's the judgment seat of christ where the elect get their rewards if you'll come to judgment here you'll wind up in judgment there because under the judgment seal will purge you and positionally place you so that when you get beyond this life and you go to the judgment seat of christ no one is lost at that judgment that is not the white throne judgment that's the judgment of rewards for the elect and brother branham finishes the sixth seal the last thing he says is i want to tell you a story and i've never told this in public before and he's talking about entering in at the judgment seat of christ to his rewards i say god let the sixth seal do its work in me let the judgment seat purge me god let it positionally place me lord thy rod and thy staff they comfort me after you see this friends why would you avoid the chastening of the lord why would you fight his hand of chastening why would you re-fight the rebuke from the pulpit why would you fight the rebuke from the message when all he's trying to do is put you in position so that you can manifest the word the jews i meant they were in the holocaust do we understand that they were killed by the millions and it was the tender hand of jehovah to put them in position to receive the tree of life what foolishness for them to shake their fist at god and say god i'm mad at you for this it was the loving hand of jehovah it was god positionally placing an entire people to receive the messiah and what right do we have to shake our fist at god say god why am i in this trial and why is this happening to me and why is this ailment in my body don't shake your fist at god say god purged me from the fire off of your altar oh lamb of god cleanse my heart and put me in position because i want to come to another judgment one day amen and i want to come to the judgment that brother branham saw at the end of the sixth seal and the judgment of rewards at the judgment seat of christ where he steps up to the platform and he couldn't believe his name was called and he wasn't expecting that and he comes up and everyone's patterning on the back and say god bless you brother branham oh my brother and he walks up and he gets ready to walk on the platform to the light and he feels something slip in one arm he looks over its hope something hits his other arm he looks over its meda and they walk in together i say put me in position god i want to be at that judgment i want to be at the judgment of rewards and i'll never make it if i don't allow the sixth seal to put me in position we need to submit ourselves under the mighty hand of jehovah let's all stand i didn't really get to all that i wanted to get to but i pray that god will get us there and i pray like brother branham said the holy ghost will reveal what i couldn't say let's go back and read the seals again i'm excited friends i'm excited god is unlocking the mystery of our lives god is positionally placing us in his word why because brother branham said rapturing grace lies on them tapes what tapes is he talking about the revelation of the seven seals the mysteries that unlocked after that those tapes what's in them is something to unlock your life it's something to unlock the world the word and i say god give me more of it musicians if you want to come on up come on up i say god's good to his friends just when you think that you're about to plateau god takes us higher there is no leveling off for the bride of jesus christ revelation is not going to stop it's not going to slow down we're not going to come to the end of the unveiling of god until until we get a body change and go on and then we'll begin to discover the revelation of god amen we're so limited here but even in our limited condition god has so loved us and he so has a desire that he's continually unveiling come and see me see me more see yourself and me find your position find true satisfaction i'm excited about the sixth seal when it comes it is not one bit pleasant the chastening hand of the lord doesn't feel very good but the after effect oh it's glorious friends i wouldn't miss it for the world let's bow our heads and pray their heavenly father i thank you lord for your word you're such a marvelous god and i can say lord that thy rod and thy staff they comfort me lord you lead your sheep you correct your sheep because you love your sheep lord and i'm so glad lord that when i would go astray you never let me learn that i'm to judge myself but if not if i'm judged i'm chastened of you lord that i will not be condemned with the world what a satisfaction that brings i just pray almighty god that you would let this lesson come home to each one of us that you would unlock the mystery in our life that you would reveal to us lord what you're doing in our lives lord if there's individuals here who have been hurt in the past from what they see as wrongdoings of other people people that have hurt them and abused them and and and mocked them and taken advantage of them god opened their eyes to see that they may not be here today hearing this word if it wasn't for that let us see lord that you make no mistakes lord that nothing is out of sequence with your clock but lord those things that we thought were terrible i believe one day we're going to see him as the best thing that's ever happened to us lord i pray that you'd open our eyes let us have faith and believe that you take your seed on a predestinated platform and you're moving us into position to receive the tree of life i love you lord i ask that you would just bless us lord as we move from here watch over us protect us help us to grow in our grace and our knowledge of you and our understanding and revelation of what you have for us what you've done positionally place us in our land lord we thank you god have your way with us we pray in jesus christ's name man god bless you saints i want to encourage you to pick up your seal book and read it read it these next couple weeks i think we're going to spend a little time here if the lord keeps moving i'm excited to see what comes next there's nothing negative in the kingdom of god everything's positive and he's going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle not because you wanted it but because he wanted it not because of your desire but because of his word he will have a bride without spot or wrinkle we come to the judgment seat every sunday i say open up and say god judge me don't be like cain and shake your fist at the preacher say that's too much that's too far if it's the word of god you say god purge me touch me with a coal of fire lord cleanse it out of my life but do not take cain's attitude ever to the judgment of god ever you just lay your life down sheep lay their life down for the shepherd god bless your saints let's sing this song god bless you brother [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] for we need your strength from day to day [Music] another day [Music] come and lead us [Music] let us ask that you would be praying and remembering those that are going to be traveling if you pray for our family we'd appreciate it and we look forward to getting back i i want to come back on full charge battery fully loaded and i want to i i want to do all that god has called me to do because i feel like we've rounded the back stretch we've rounded the last corner we're looking at the finish line and it's time to sprint when you're running in that long endurance race you know you got a couple laps around the track and you get around that last corner and that's when you give it all you've got every last bit of energy that was reserved for this last dash to the finish line and god has put us in position he's given us his word we've got everything we need and it's time to dash all the way to the rapture i'm excited
