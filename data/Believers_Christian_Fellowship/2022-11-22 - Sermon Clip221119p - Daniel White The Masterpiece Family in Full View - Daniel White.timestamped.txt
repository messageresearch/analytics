[0:00] God expressing himself
[0:05] if the Holy Ghost
[0:07] is in the husband how will God Express
[0:11] himself
[0:16] as a husband
[0:20] if the Holy Ghost is in
[0:24] a wife
[0:26] how is God going to express himself
[0:32] as a wife
[0:35] did God give a husband boundaries
[0:41] did God give Ephraim boundaries
[0:46] did God give Manasseh boundaries
[0:49] they had to operate within the
[0:50] boundaries that they were given
[0:52] did God give a wife boundaries
[0:57] absolutely
[0:59] absolutely if God is if the Holy Ghost
[1:01] is in a wife he's going to express
[1:04] himself within the boundaries that he
[1:07] laid out
[1:13] if the Holy Ghost is in the children how
[1:15] will God Express himself
[1:20] as the children
[1:24] this is a very beautiful thing because
[1:26] this is Hebrews 3 and 8. in a
[1:29] many-membered body
[1:30] it's God expressing himself
[1:34] well as I said earlier the terminology
[1:37] the son of man the seven seal all these
[1:39] terminologies that we had at some point
[1:41] that's got to become material that's got
[1:43] to become visible that's got to become
[1:45] seen in Amendment many membered body the
[1:49] body of Christ it's got to be seen
[1:52] through her it's got to be seen from her
[1:54] it's got to be more than terminology
[1:57] it's got to be a living vessel it's got
[2:00] to be a living God it's got to be the
[2:02] son of man ministry again in a
[2:05] many-membered body
[2:07] the Solomon Ministry is God Is Not
[2:10] restricted to a prophetic Ministry even
[2:13] though it is in the prophetic Ministry
[2:15] but the son of man Ministry can be in a
[2:17] child
[2:19] because the son of man Ministry is the
[2:22] word made flesh and if you if you have
[2:25] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:27] and the word has been made flesh in a
[2:29] child than the son of man Ministry can
[2:32] be expressed from a child
[2:35] the son of man Ministry has not just
[2:37] being expressed from what from your
[2:39] pastor
[2:41] no sir the Solomon Ministry is it being
[2:44] expressed from a many-membered body
[2:48] in many different offices
