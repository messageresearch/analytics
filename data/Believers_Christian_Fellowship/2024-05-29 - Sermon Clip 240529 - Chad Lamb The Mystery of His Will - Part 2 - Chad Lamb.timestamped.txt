[0:00] and we know that speech sometimes is
[0:03] different than what we consider speech
[0:05] amen what we call speech is speech amen
[0:07] but the the Bible in the Psalms as it
[0:10] describes the heavenlies amen it says
[0:12] they speak a language amen and it goes
[0:14] out all over the their speech is heard
[0:15] by all the world Amen what what speech
[0:18] do the stars give that hits your
[0:21] eardrum
[0:23] right amen but they're speaking of the
[0:27] glory of God they're speaking of the
[0:29] handywork of God Amen their voice utth
[0:32] out the things of God their speech goes
[0:34] to the ends of the
[0:39] world praise God so this word is so much
[0:44] deeper it can be represented on paper it
[0:46] can be represented audibly as what we
[0:49] call audibly it can be represented amen
[0:51] through signs through wonders through
[0:53] through mirica it can be represented in
[0:55] many ways amen but what it is is the
[0:58] thought of God coming into manifestation
[1:01] that is this
[1:03] word
[1:04] amen and it embodies the concept or idea
[1:08] so this is the this is the thing that
[1:10] becomes so important because if I get
[1:13] the audible part that hits my ear and
[1:15] then I go to act that out in life and
[1:18] the way I act it out is not according to
[1:20] God's thought then I did not get the
[1:22] logos although I got words I got what we
[1:26] would call words I did not get the logos
[1:28] because now my actions are different
[1:31] than God's thinking when he spoke that
[1:33] word or when he had a prophet speak it
[1:35] or when he had men of old put it down
[1:37] and pin it out on a scroll amen whatever
[1:39] was in God's mind amen is the word the
[1:43] thought becoming the word the word must
[1:46] contain that thought in order to be
[1:51] logos this is
[1:54] why this is why you can read and you can
[1:57] read and you can read and you can read
[1:59] but without the spirit of Revelation
[2:01] amen we're not going to get any further
[2:02] than the denominations are getting and
[2:05] there's nothing wrong with reading and
[2:06] there's nothing wrong with respecting
[2:07] the word and I believe God will even
[2:09] honor those who do it sincerely amen but
[2:12] we need more than the ability to read we
[2:14] need more than just a great translation
[2:16] of the Bible brother Brenham says so
[2:18] much what we need is the spirit of
[2:20] Revelation to tap us back into the mind
[2:22] of God and God in his Mercy amen he sent
[2:25] down a voice in our day the voice of God
[2:28] Amen that could tap into the back part
[2:30] of God's mind and bring the perfect
[2:32] interpretation of the word with Divine
[2:34] Vindication so that we don't have to
[2:36] question what God meant by this
[2:38] verse you just go back and find what the
[2:41] prophet said because the prophet was the
[2:43] mouthpiece of God he wasn't his own
[2:45] mouthpiece he was the mouthpiece of God
[2:48] and so now this is why in my life I'm
[2:51] not trying as a a as as a Christian
[2:54] who's been predestinated into the
[2:56] adoption of children to be conformed
[2:58] into the image of Christ who is the
[3:00] anointed word amen so I've been
[3:03] predestinated to come into the image of
[3:04] the anointed
[3:07] word amen so that's why I'm not here in
[3:10] this life to contradict the prophet or
[3:12] to correct the prophet or to change what
[3:14] he said or to make it more malleable to
[3:17] my station in life amen because I'm here
[3:20] to get the thought behind the word and
[3:22] how am I going to do it with my own
[3:26] intellect we need a we needed a
[3:30] voice at the end of time we needed the
[3:33] perfect interpretation of the word with
[3:36] Divine vindication
