[5:48] for them and the lord will bless them
[5:50] and their union together
[5:52] amen before we read too i'm going to
[5:55] i'm going to pray but i also have caught
[5:57] word over the last week or so of a
[5:59] couple different assemblies out there
[6:01] that have had covert 19 go through and
[6:03] some that
[6:04] were very very sick brother donny
[6:06] reagan's been sick for several days now

[6:11] he's recovering at home
[6:12] uh brother david silas church i know got
[6:15] hit with a pretty bad case
[6:17] some people in icu uh so we just want to
[6:20] remember the bride around the world
[6:22] i also found out late last night that
[6:24] our brother jivaratnam marlapudi i hope
[6:27] you remember he was here last summer
[6:29] he's been here two years in a row
[6:30] he's a good friend of ours he stayed in
[6:32] our home for a little over a week and we
[6:35] really got to know him and enjoy the
[6:36] brother quite a bit
[6:38] and jiva ratnam is very very very sick
[6:40] right now as we speak
[6:42] the doctors actually told his family
[6:44] that only god can save him
[6:46] he's 100 dependent on oxygen his
[6:48] saturation
[6:49] saturation levels keep dropping but
[6:52] we've heard that story before
[6:55] and god is a healer and god can do it
[6:58] for one he can do it for another amen
[7:00] and since we've been through this before
[7:02] we want to exercise our faith because
[7:04] we've
[7:04] we've seen god bring from the lowest of
[7:07] the low all the way out amen
[7:09] if you did it for brother gene he can do
[7:11] it for brother marla putin you can do it
[7:12] for brother don he can do it for anybody
[7:14] so we just want to pray so let's pray
[7:16] together before we read
[7:19] dear lord jesus we thank you father for
[7:21] the goodness that you've extended to us
[7:23] for your mercy for your grace in our
[7:25] lives for your word lord that never
[7:28] fails
[7:29] god we just want to come to you and ask
[7:31] lord that you would bless our service
[7:33] this evening all that would be said let
[7:35] it be done for your glory
[7:37] and god for those that have needs lord
[7:39] throughout the world
[7:40] your bride lord is suffering like the
[7:42] rest of the world is suffering just like
[7:44] your children of israel suffered when
[7:46] the plagues broke out in goshen as well
[7:48] as in
[7:48] in egypt lord for the first few plagues
[7:51] my god your hand of mercy is extended
[7:54] your grace is sufficient your word has
[7:56] not failed
[7:57] you've healed so many and delivered us
[7:59] from such dire circumstances
[8:02] and we pray for our brothers and sisters
[8:04] we pray for our brother donny reagan
[8:06] lord that you'll heal him and bring him
[8:07] you know back to full strength lord and
[8:10] for those in his church and those in by
[8:12] the david silas church and
[8:13] many others that out there some we know
[8:15] about some we don't know about
[8:17] but we pray that you would show yourself
[8:19] mighty on behalf of your bride
[8:21] in order for our precious brother
[8:23] jivaratnam lord in india
[8:25] he's suffering so badly as wife sick and
[8:27] children sick
[8:28] i just pray you would raise them up for
[8:30] your glory lord that you would let this
[8:32] turn from a disaster to a tremendous
[8:34] testimony
[8:35] lord that you would get great glory and
[8:37] honor through that testimony
[8:39] bless us as we read your word tonight
[8:41] bless us lord as we feed on your word
[8:43] may you come yourself lord and break the
[8:45] bread of life to us
[8:47] that you might show us the way to walk
[8:48] in this day that we live
[8:50] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[8:54] let's read from romans chapter 12
[8:57] verse 1. romans chapter 12 and verse 1
[9:02] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[9:03] mercies of god
[9:05] that you present your bodies a living
[9:06] sacrifice holy
[9:08] acceptable unto god which is your
[9:11] reasonable service
[9:12] and be not conformed to this world but
[9:14] be transformed by the renewing of your
[9:16] mind
[9:17] that you may prove what is the good and
[9:18] acceptable and perfect will of god
[9:21] for i say through the grace given unto
[9:22] me to every man that is among you not to
[9:25] think of himself more highly
[9:26] than he ought to think but to think
[9:28] soberly according
[9:30] according as god hath dealt to every man
[9:33] the measure of faith
[9:35] so in this passage in verse 3 he's
[9:37] saying let's not
[9:38] be overly exalted let's not think
[9:40] ourselves special
[9:42] because if we believe we've been given a
[9:44] measure of faith by the lord
[9:45] that he's given to us so let's read that
[9:47] again for i say through the grace given
[9:49] unto me to every man that is among you
[9:51] not to think of himself more highly than
[9:53] he ought to think
[9:54] but to think soberly according as god
[9:56] hath dealt to every man
[9:58] the measure of faith first we have many
[10:00] members in one body and all members have
[10:02] not the same office
[10:04] so we being many are one body in christ
[10:07] and every one members one of another
[10:09] having them gifts differing according to
[10:11] the grace that is given to us
[10:13] whether prophecy let us prophesy
[10:15] according to the proportion of faith
[10:17] or ministry let us wait on our ministry
[10:19] or he that teacheth on teaching or he
[10:21] that exhorted on exhortation
[10:23] he that giveth let him do it with
[10:25] simplicity he that ruleth with
[10:28] diligence he that showeth mercy with
[10:30] cheerfulness
[10:31] let love be without dissimulation abort
[10:33] that which is evil
[10:34] cleave to that which is good be kindly
[10:37] affectionate one to another
[10:39] with brotherly love and honor preferring
[10:42] one another
[10:43] amen you can be seated
[10:46] turn from there to second chronicles
[10:48] with me
[10:50] we're going to keep on with the thought
[10:52] we've been on looking at
[10:53] solomon coming to his kingdom and the
[10:56] golden age
[10:58] sunday we talked about uh
[11:01] preparing for a golden age and what had
[11:03] to be done in preparation for a golden
[11:05] age
[11:06] and in in that i just want to do a just
[11:09] a quick review
[11:11] with you there was four individuals we
[11:14] talked about that came to judgment
[11:16] and we opened with the scripture that
[11:17] judgment must begin in the house of god
[11:19] and
[11:19] brother graham said that that that
[11:22] solomon
[11:23] brought israel into a golden age under
[11:25] solomon's rule
[11:26] amen and he was a foreshadow of jesus
[11:28] christ and that's why jesus would say
[11:31] you know there's a greater than solomon
[11:32] that's here and brother branham would
[11:34] pick up on that and
[11:35] he would bring it forward and say a
[11:36] greater than solomon is here
[11:38] and we know that a greater than solomon
[11:39] is still here
[11:41] and so when that great when that solomon
[11:43] came that was foreshadowing christ
[11:45] amen to bring them to a golden age first
[11:47] he has to deal with spirits that are
[11:49] embedded in the church amen
[11:51] spirits that are close to him spirits
[11:53] that are there that are working
[11:54] amen until these things are dealt with
[11:57] he can't move to the
[11:58] to the golden age first there has to be
[12:00] a purging
[12:01] and so that's a very important step in
[12:04] the process
[12:05] that we can miss so many times is this
[12:08] purging
[12:09] removing the spirits david did a
[12:11] fantastic job
[12:12] amen of purging israel of
[12:15] the outside enemies amen those that were
[12:18] not israelites
[12:19] those those false kingdoms that were all
[12:23] around that were being dispossessed of
[12:24] their land
[12:25] and david fought the philistines he
[12:26] liberated jerusalem
[12:28] amen from the jebusites and all of these
[12:30] wonderful victories that he had
[12:32] but but when he was dying because the
[12:35] father gives all judgment to the son
[12:37] when he was dying he told the son there
[12:39] are some things that are within
[12:42] i judge the things that are without but
[12:44] there are things that within that need
[12:46] to be dealt with
[12:47] and i'm calling on you to deal with that
[12:49] don't forget joab don't forget shimmy
[12:51] high
[12:51] don't forget these things and so we we
[12:54] we spoke about that but
[12:56] there were four judgments and four
[12:58] individuals that we spoke about
[13:00] the first was adonijah adonijah was an
[13:02] older brother to solomon
[13:04] he was next in line to absalom after
[13:06] absalom was killed
[13:08] and and his rebellion but adenija
[13:12] tried to get ahead of the program of god
[13:14] amen before he was told
[13:16] amen he tried to usurp himself
[13:20] he tried to put himself in position that
[13:22] god didn't put him in
[13:24] he tried because it logically it looked
[13:27] like it was his
[13:28] amen by reasoning it looked like it was
[13:30] his amen by all logic and reasoning it
[13:33] looked like he would be the successor
[13:35] so because of his reasoning because of
[13:37] his wisdom because of his intellect
[13:39] he decided to move ahead in god's
[13:41] program without god's commandment
[13:43] it's a dangerous position to be in that
[13:46] spirit has to be rooted out of the
[13:47] church
[13:48] because this church christ has to have
[13:50] preeminence in his church
[13:52] amen not the church deciding by our own
[13:54] reasoning and own wisdom
[13:55] it's time for this we'll just go ahead
[13:57] and do it it's time for this
[13:59] we'll just go ahead and do it like
[14:01] saying it's time for the manifestation
[14:03] of the third pull let's start speaking
[14:06] we're going to make a mockery of the
[14:08] things of god when we get ahead of god's
[14:10] program
[14:11] every time brother branham said that
[14:13] that he there was a manifestation of the
[14:15] third pool and speaking to squirrels
[14:17] speaking to a storm speaking to his
[14:18] wife's tumor speaking to had he writes
[14:20] boys
[14:21] all of these things that brother ben
[14:22] spoke about he says now see that was
[14:24] done
[14:25] by permission not by him deciding it was
[14:29] time
[14:30] and then moving ahead of god's program
[14:32] but waiting until the lord said speak
[14:34] and then he spoke
[14:35] so adonijah got ahead of god's program
[14:38] amen
[14:39] and he had to be judged and it would
[14:40] show that there was wickedness within
[14:42] him
[14:42] it wasn't that he made a simple mistake
[14:44] but he was actually wicked in his heart
[14:47] he wanted something that god hadn't
[14:49] given him because the king hadn't said
[14:51] this is your position so he went ahead
[14:53] and went through septility and tried to
[14:54] put himself in that position
[14:56] so adam nigel was self-appointing and
[14:58] it's amazing there's going to be
[15:00] four judgments adonijah abby athar the
[15:03] priest
[15:04] joab the the captain of the host and
[15:07] shemiyah
[15:07] of the house of saul all four of them
[15:10] are going to be judged
[15:12] but they're going to be four men that
[15:13] take their place
[15:15] four men or the family of the fourth man
[15:17] we'll talk about that in a minute this
[15:18] one i want to get to
[15:20] but adenija was self-appointed solomon
[15:23] was appointed by god
[15:26] see one thing i want to start moving
[15:29] into is i want to start getting into
[15:30] positional placing in the body of christ
[15:33] but in positional placing amen
[15:35] positional placing does not come by the
[15:37] will of the person being placed
[15:41] positional placing in the body comes
[15:43] solely by the will of god
[15:46] solomon didn't put himself anywhere
[15:49] solomon did
[15:50] nothing until the king told him that
[15:51] you're the successor amen and god put
[15:53] him in position because god had spoke it
[15:55] years before
[15:56] and even though it was prophesied and
[15:58] spoken years before solomon didn't move
[16:00] till david said it's you
[16:03] and it's time and so so that
[16:06] we see the difference between adonis and
[16:08] solomon amen
[16:09] all of this is moving is moving israel
[16:12] into the golden age these things have to
[16:14] be dealt with to move into the golden
[16:16] age
[16:16] not only do the spirits have to be
[16:19] judged
[16:19] amen all the right positions have to be
[16:22] filled by the god called men
[16:24] so to come to a golden age is not just
[16:26] purging
[16:27] it's purging and placing so to come to a
[16:31] golden age you have to have purging
[16:33] and placing abby athar the priest we
[16:36] find out
[16:37] went with adonijah and you wonder why
[16:39] did abathur the priest go with
[16:41] adrenaline
[16:41] abe ether was a priest he was a son of
[16:44] aaron but he was of the lineage of eli
[16:47] amen through the youngest son of aaron
[16:49] and the high priesthood was supposed to
[16:51] move through eleazar
[16:52] and so samuel had cursed eli and put a
[16:55] curse on his household and said
[16:57] that the priesthood will be removed from
[16:59] you and it continued on till we got to
[17:01] abathar but when christ comes
[17:03] to bring a golden age amen all prophecy
[17:06] will be fulfilled
[17:08] all wrongs will be righted and here a
[17:10] beathard
[17:11] proves what spirit is he's of because he
[17:14] goes with adonisia
[17:16] so he is cast out he the priesthood
[17:18] stripped from him
[17:19] zadok is put up in his place amen is the
[17:22] priest he's of the line of eliezer he's
[17:24] the appropriate priesthood of the
[17:25] appropriate line
[17:26] and he's put in the appropriate position
[17:29] zadok doesn't put himself anywhere
[17:32] solomon puts him there you see a theme
[17:36] god purges judges and places
[17:41] so much of this judging has to take
[17:43] place
[17:44] the judging that has to take place is on
[17:47] people
[17:47] who tried to take a position
[17:50] people who tried to make themselves
[17:52] something they want people who tried to
[17:54] grab
[17:55] something that wasn't given to them amen
[17:57] and they they brought damnation upon
[17:59] themselves
[18:02] so abr ather isaac
[18:06] is sent away sent to his own hometown
[18:08] he's stripped of the priesthood
[18:10] zadok is put in position joab who's the
[18:12] captain of the host who's
[18:14] a a relative a nephew of david
[18:17] uh he's fought many a battle with david
[18:19] and he's a religious man a.b author is a
[18:21] religious man adenizer is a religious
[18:22] man
[18:23] uh joab's a religious man we're not
[18:25] talking about heathen's friends we're
[18:27] talking about people who worship god
[18:29] people who are in the church i mean joab
[18:32] even protested when david wanted the
[18:34] number of the people
[18:35] because david numbering the people was
[18:36] contrary to the law of moses and he said
[18:38] don't do this don't do this to israel
[18:41] but but david pushed him anyways because
[18:43] god had ordained it
[18:45] so it wasn't ju that job didn't want to
[18:47] serve the lord didn't want to obey the
[18:48] lord didn't know the law and didn't keep
[18:50] the law
[18:51] but job had a problem joab
[18:54] took it upon himself to bring
[18:58] judgment upon abner and upon a mesa amen
[19:01] who david was not going to judge they
[19:03] were coming at a time of peace
[19:05] and reconciliation but that peace and
[19:07] reconciliation
[19:08] was a threat to joab's position as
[19:11] captain of the host
[19:13] and because it was a threat to his
[19:15] position amen he slew
[19:18] abner and he slew a mesa amen without
[19:21] the king's consent
[19:22] against the king's desire in a time of
[19:25] peace and reconciliation
[19:27] he destroyed and ruined destroyed their
[19:29] lives so that he could stay in a
[19:31] position of authority
[19:34] and he wasn't a heathen he wasn't a
[19:36] philistine he wasn't a gentile
[19:38] amen he was an israelite who worshipped
[19:41] god
[19:42] who loved the lord and loved the law but
[19:45] he loved himself
[19:46] more a b a thor
[19:49] loved the lord loved the law loved
[19:52] himself more
[19:53] adonijah no doubt was a worshiper of
[19:55] jehovah but he loved himself
[19:57] more then
[20:00] joab now is replaced by banaya
[20:03] banaya is actually a gentile warrior in
[20:06] in banaya he he's the one
[20:10] if you if you follow banaya through
[20:12] banaya does many acts of valor
[20:13] he's one of the mighty men of david but
[20:15] bania you never see banaya
[20:18] move outside the authority of david
[20:20] outside the command of david
[20:22] when david says go he goes if david
[20:24] doesn't say go
[20:25] he doesn't go he doesn't get caught up
[20:28] in the seduction in the subtility of
[20:30] adonijah
[20:31] when adam knight is going to usurp
[20:33] himself amen abe third gets caught up in
[20:35] it
[20:36] joab gets caught up in it amen many
[20:38] others get caught up
[20:39] amen but but banaya doesn't get caught
[20:41] up in it
[20:43] zadok doesn't get caught up in it nathan
[20:46] the prophet doesn't get caught up in it
[20:48] why because they're not going to fall by
[20:50] deception
[20:52] because the bride won't fall by
[20:53] deception amen
[20:56] praise be to god so joab is replaced
[20:59] with banaya
[21:00] a man who will only do what the king
[21:03] says do
[21:06] shimmy i is of the house of saul
[21:10] shimmy i lives peaceably with david he's
[21:13] a
[21:13] he is i guess he has
[21:17] undercover resentment
[21:20] now i'm talking in the church not
[21:23] outside the church
[21:25] in the church he has undercover
[21:27] resentment
[21:29] because the the kingdom was removed from
[21:32] saul's family and he's part of saul's
[21:34] family
[21:35] and was restricted from saul and it
[21:37] didn't matter how evil saul was or
[21:40] how righteous god was in stripping the
[21:42] kingdom away and giving it to david
[21:44] amen because it was taken from someone
[21:46] given to david
[21:47] amen that was god's righteous judgment
[21:50] that was god's
[21:51] uh god's duty god's obligation to the
[21:54] kingdom to set up the king
[21:57] but shemii resented david all along for
[22:00] it
[22:01] and david didn't do anything david just
[22:03] obeyed the command of god
[22:04] david didn't choose himself god chose
[22:06] him he didn't pour the oil on himself
[22:08] samuel under the direction of god poured
[22:10] the oil on david didn't do
[22:12] anything to put himself in this position
[22:14] god did it all
[22:15] amen but shimmy i was secretly resentful
[22:18] of his position why
[22:22] because his house lost out
[22:26] we're not talking outside the church
[22:28] we're talking in the church
[22:30] see a greater than solomon is here amen
[22:33] not to deal with the dominations he's
[22:34] already dealt with the nominations
[22:36] but now he's to bring us to a golden age
[22:39] friends
[22:39] and he's got to purge out all of
[22:41] self-love all of selfishness and all the
[22:43] self-will
[22:44] has got to be purged out of jerusalem
[22:49] amen praise be to god we
[22:52] we are you know we are not exempt
[22:55] because we say we're the bride we know
[22:56] the message we're in the message
[22:58] amen they were the bride they were in
[23:00] the message amen
[23:01] the solomon's reign under david was they
[23:03] were in the message of the
[23:04] hour they were message believers in the
[23:07] right dispensation amen but wrong
[23:09] spirits were trying to move in the
[23:11] church
[23:11] amen and when solomon come on the scene
[23:13] to bring him into a golden age he's got
[23:15] to deal with these wrong spirits
[23:18] and a greater than solomon is here to
[23:19] deal with the wrong spirits that try to
[23:21] work in our lives
[23:23] so shimmy i now curses david
[23:27] when when david is strong nothing said
[23:31] i mean he at least nothing said
[23:33] outwardly nothing said to david
[23:35] in his home he may be backbiting the
[23:37] king and but
[23:38] but out openly he's not saying anything
[23:40] until david is leaving jerusalem
[23:42] seemingly weak having lost his kingdom
[23:45] being defeated and cast out by a son
[23:47] and as he's moving along shimei is going
[23:49] on the ridge top
[23:50] cursing david with grievous curses and
[23:52] throwing stones and casting dust and
[23:54] dirt
[23:56] and david has so much of god he's a man
[23:59] after god's own heart
[24:01] amen that when when one of the mighty
[24:03] men that were with him said
[24:04] let me cut his head off and he says no
[24:06] the lord told him to do that
[24:08] the lord told him to curse david
[24:12] why because nothing happens outside of
[24:14] god allowing it to happen
[24:16] so when he curses david david goes out
[24:20] when he's
[24:20] going to mahanim when he's fleeing from
[24:23] absalom
[24:24] and when david comes back after the
[24:27] rebellion is cast down david is going to
[24:28] be reinstated as king
[24:30] shimaya falls at jordan falls at his
[24:33] feet
[24:33] and begs for mercy and apologizes and
[24:36] makes him swear that he won't kill him
[24:37] and david says i won't kill you
[24:39] and that's the promise but when
[24:41] solomon's coming on the scene
[24:43] see shimei didn't change
[24:47] shemii cursed david for love of himself
[24:50] and shemio repented to david for love of
[24:52] himself
[24:54] he was never humbled he was never
[24:56] changed amen he still
[24:58] loved himself more than he loved the
[24:59] plan of god
[25:01] because if the plan of god let's just
[25:04] say it this way
[25:04] if the plan of god takes you out of
[25:07] position and sits you down and puts
[25:09] another man in position
[25:10] amen you should say praise be to god
[25:12] that's the plan of god
[25:14] amen if that's what god wants that's
[25:15] what i want
[25:18] but if the plan of god amen moves one
[25:21] position to another position
[25:23] amen and that irritates you and makes
[25:25] you jealous and envious
[25:26] amen you need to get to the altar amen
[25:28] before god and say god i'm sorry
[25:31] i'm sorry that i can't humble myself i'm
[25:34] sorry that i
[25:34] can't amen rejoice in what you're doing
[25:39] praise be to god we're going to find out
[25:42] as we move along
[25:43] amen when we can get away from self we
[25:45] can start to see the golden age move in
[25:49] and so
[25:53] when when david tells solomon don't
[25:56] forget joab don't forget shimmy i
[25:58] he also mentions another name he says
[26:01] don't forget
[26:03] braziliani don't forget braziliani
[26:07] he did good to me and he said take his
[26:10] sons
[26:11] and let his sons eat at your table
[26:14] feed them and sustain them and say what
[26:17] did brazilia
[26:18] do let's turn to second samuel
[26:22] we'll come back the chronicles let's go
[26:24] to second samuel
[26:28] verse 9 or chapter 19.
[26:41] second samuel 19 31
[26:44] in brazil ai the gileadite
[26:47] came down from regulum and went over
[26:50] jordan with the king to conduct
[26:52] him over jordan now brazilian was a very
[26:54] aged man even four score years old
[26:57] and he had provided the king of
[26:58] sustenance while he lay at mahanaim
[27:00] for he was a very great man so now well
[27:04] shemii when the king was going to
[27:06] moanain shemyi was cursing him
[27:08] at the same time this man gilead and i
[27:12] he was coming and bringing substance to
[27:14] sustain the king he was bringing food
[27:16] and provisions to the king
[27:17] and monad in his exile in his weakness
[27:20] amen when he was down at his lowest
[27:23] there was somebody who would stand with
[27:24] him and support him
[27:26] shimmy i took advantage of the situation
[27:28] to finally express what was really in
[27:30] his heart
[27:31] resentment and self-love amen and he
[27:33] cursed him with a great curse
[27:34] he was cursing god's anointed
[27:38] but brazilian had enough god in him to
[27:40] say though he's cast down though he's
[27:42] run out of jerusalem though he's low
[27:44] he's still god's anointed and i'm going
[27:46] to support him
[27:48] i'm going to bring substance to him so
[27:50] he brought substance to him
[27:55] and he says verse 33 and the king said
[27:58] to brasilia i
[27:59] come now over with me and i will feed
[28:01] thee with me in jerusalem
[28:03] now he's been in monday he's been in
[28:04] exile now the rebellion's cast down now
[28:07] he's coming across jordan to be
[28:08] reinstated as king
[28:09] brazilian i had brought him substance he
[28:11] said now come with me
[28:13] amen and i'll feed you at my table amen
[28:15] to sit at the king table means you'll
[28:17] never work another day in your life
[28:19] means you'll never want for anything
[28:21] ever again means you're honored and
[28:23] respected
[28:24] and you're put in a position of care
[28:27] amen and support for the rest of your
[28:29] life
[28:30] and braziliani said unto the king
[28:34] how long have i to live that i should go
[28:36] up with the king unto jerusalem
[28:38] i am this day four score years old and
[28:40] can i discern between good and evil
[28:42] can thy servant taste what i eat or what
[28:44] i drink
[28:45] can i hear any more the voice of singing
[28:47] men or singing women
[28:49] wherefore then then should the ser thy
[28:52] servant be yet a burden unto my lord the
[28:54] king
[28:55] thy servant will go a little way over
[28:56] jordan with the king and why should the
[28:58] king recompense
[28:59] me with such a reward let thy servant i
[29:02] pray they turn back again and i may die
[29:04] in my own city and be buried by the
[29:06] grave of my father and
[29:07] my mother but behold thy servant cheham
[29:10] let him go over with my lord
[29:12] the king and do to him what shall seem
[29:14] good unto thee
[29:17] so now we find out braziliani he he
[29:20] comes
[29:20] at a time david's in weakness when
[29:22] shemia is taking advantage he's bringing
[29:24] substance to the king
[29:26] but his true motive is expressed when
[29:29] the king comes back in the power
[29:31] amen braziliani did not help the king
[29:35] so that when the king comes in the power
[29:36] he'll get benefit
[29:38] because when the benefit comes he turns
[29:40] it down proving his motive was pure
[29:43] all the way through he didn't want
[29:45] nothing back all he wanted to do was
[29:47] serve god's program
[29:49] all he wanted to do was support god's
[29:51] plan could support support god's man
[29:53] he wasn't looking for a kickback he
[29:55] wasn't looking for an attaboy
[29:56] he wasn't looking for anything because
[29:58] when the golden opportunity comes
[30:00] he said hey i can't even taste the food
[30:02] i can't even hear the
[30:04] singing and dancing i would just be a
[30:05] burden to the king don't do it for me
[30:07] but do it for this other man
[30:10] my goodness do you understand what
[30:11] character we're looking at in brasilia
[30:13] amen the character that god wants to
[30:15] have in his children today
[30:17] preferring one over thyself just take
[30:19] him do to him lord amen
[30:21] i i'm not worthy i don't waste all your
[30:23] effort on me
[30:24] do it for my brother over here
[30:28] so his his conduct and his response to
[30:30] the king
[30:31] proves what his motive was amen so when
[30:34] judgment comes
[30:35] judgment when judgment comes in
[30:37] preparation for the golden age
[30:39] judgment doesn't always come on the
[30:41] wicked judgment also comes on the
[30:43] righteous
[30:45] and now he tells uh uh and
[30:49] first kings chapter two when he gives
[30:51] instruction to solomon
[30:52] he says solomon judge joab judge shemii
[30:55] he says
[30:56] and take brazilia and bring his sons and
[30:59] feed them at your table all your days
[31:02] what happened because of the true motive
[31:04] of the father
[31:05] the children are put into a position
[31:07] that they could have never got to
[31:09] themselves
[31:10] [Music]
[31:11] because god keeps good records friends
[31:15] don't we don't do things to get
[31:18] something from god
[31:19] we our motive has to be pure our
[31:21] intention has to be pure
[31:23] amen when jesus was here he was telling
[31:25] you don't pray like the pharisees
[31:27] do stand on the corner and say loud
[31:29] prayers and blow a trumpet before they
[31:31] cast their arms in
[31:32] he said they've already got their reward
[31:34] they won't get anything else because
[31:35] what did they want
[31:36] they didn't want to serve god they
[31:38] wanted the people to see them serve god
[31:41] they didn't want god's respect they
[31:43] wanted the people's respect
[31:46] so they got the reward people respected
[31:48] them they thought they were amazing
[31:51] that's the only reward they would get
[31:52] but the little widow woman amen who had
[31:54] almost
[31:55] nothing to give didn't blow a trumpet
[31:56] didn't announce it she was probably
[31:58] ashamed at the amount that she was
[31:59] putting in so she was probably trying to
[32:01] slip
[32:01] in drop it and slip out
[32:04] but jesus noticed exactly what she did
[32:07] friends god keeps good records she
[32:09] didn't do it to get
[32:10] anything she did it because she had a
[32:11] pure heart that loved god
[32:14] i said god give me a pure heart that
[32:16] will serve you just because i
[32:18] love you not for benefits not for
[32:20] kickbacks amen not for blessings
[32:22] not for healings amen not for not for
[32:25] material gains
[32:26] amen just because i love you
[32:31] we don't have to try to get anything
[32:32] manipulate a situation do something to
[32:34] get something
[32:35] god keeps good records he knows whose
[32:37] are his amen the never seen the
[32:38] righteous forsaken or the god seed
[32:40] begging for bread
[32:42] we need to serve god out of a pure heart
[32:46] so braziliani his sons now by this time
[32:49] i'm sure he has passed away he was
[32:51] already 80 years old so his the
[32:53] this honor is bestowed upon his sons
[32:55] that now they're placed in a position
[32:56] because of the character of their father
[33:00] so adenisia self-appointed
[33:05] was replaced by a god called man solomon
[33:09] abi athar who tried to seize the high
[33:12] priesthood and hold on to it
[33:13] by aligning with adani he lost it all
[33:16] and zodak was put in his place
[33:18] zadok joab who tried to hold his
[33:21] position
[33:22] as captain of the host amen by
[33:25] destroying and we talked about sunday
[33:27] and brother man said there's more than
[33:28] one way to murder a man
[33:31] amen today what we have in the in the
[33:33] church today
[33:34] may not be physical murder amen but
[33:36] there's murder going on all the time
[33:38] because if you do something to destroy
[33:40] somebody's influence brother ben said
[33:41] it's the same as taking a knife and
[33:43] murdering him
[33:46] and so joab would murder the influence
[33:48] of abner and the influence of a mesa
[33:50] amen so that he could stay in position
[33:52] right
[33:54] and his position was gone and bania a
[33:56] man who would obey the king's order
[33:58] was put in place shimayi was destroyed
[34:01] because he loved himself more than he
[34:03] loved the word of god
[34:04] but the sons of brazilia were put into a
[34:07] place they could have never attained on
[34:08] their own
[34:10] see god keeps good records friends you
[34:12] don't have to try to get anything
[34:14] you don't have to try to do anything you
[34:16] don't try to put yourself in any
[34:17] position
[34:18] god does it just love the lord serve him
[34:21] with all of your hearts
[34:23] now let's go to second chronicles
[34:27] and i'll give you the title of tonight's
[34:30] sermon which i forget to do sometimes
[34:33] but there's a reason i didn't give it to
[34:34] you because some of you would already be
[34:36] where i'm trying to go right now
[34:39] so praise god that's the danger of
[34:42] ministering to people who know the
[34:43] message really really good
[34:45] and know their bibles as soon as you say
[34:47] something they're like tick tick tick
[34:48] i've already got to the punch line
[34:52] so i like to hold a few pieces back all
[34:54] right
[34:55] second chronicles chapter nine and what
[34:57] i want to discuss
[34:58] now after doing this review is what did
[35:00] the queen of sheba see
[35:03] the queen of she became there was
[35:05] something she saw
[35:06] and after she saw it she had no more
[35:08] heart in her what did the queen of sheba
[35:10] see
[35:11] all right somebody's already there see i
[35:14] told you
[35:16] let's read verse 1 and when the queen of
[35:19] sheba heard of the fame of solomon
[35:21] she came to prove solomon with hard
[35:23] questions at jerusalem with a very great
[35:26] company
[35:27] and camels that bear spices and gold and
[35:29] abundance and precious stones and
[35:31] when she was come to solomon she
[35:32] communed with him of all that was in her
[35:34] heart
[35:35] and solomon told her all her questions
[35:38] and there was nothing hid from solomon
[35:40] which he told her not
[35:42] and when the queen of sheba had seen the
[35:43] wisdom of solomon
[35:45] and the house that he had built and the
[35:47] meat of the table and the sitting of his
[35:48] servants and the attendants of his
[35:50] ministers
[35:50] and their apparel his cupbearers also in
[35:53] their apparel
[35:54] and his ascent by which he went up into
[35:56] the house of the lord there was no more
[35:57] spirit in her
[35:59] and she said to the king it was a true
[36:01] report which i heard in my own land
[36:03] of thine acts and of thy wisdom how be
[36:06] how be it i believed not their words
[36:08] until i came in mine eyes had seen it
[36:10] and behold the one half of the greatness
[36:12] of thy wisdom was not told in me
[36:14] for thou exceedeth the fame that i heard
[36:17] happy are thy men and happy are these
[36:19] thy servants which stand continually
[36:21] before thee
[36:21] and hear thy wisdom blessed be the lord
[36:24] thy god which delighteth in thee to set
[36:26] thee on his throne
[36:27] to be king for the lord thy god because
[36:30] thy god loved israel to establish them
[36:32] forever
[36:33] therefore made he the king over them to
[36:35] do judgment and justice
[36:37] and she gave she gave the king 120
[36:42] talents of gold and precious
[36:44] and spices great in abundance and
[36:45] precious stones neither was there any
[36:47] such spices as the queen of sheba
[36:49] gave king solomon so now we see that
[36:53] she came and then she had heard of his
[36:55] fame from afar and she came but she
[36:57] believed it not till she come to see it
[36:59] and she said the half was not told to
[37:00] her until she came in person to see it
[37:03] and she marveled at the wisdom she she
[37:06] she
[37:06] she proved solomon with hard questions
[37:10] if we turn keep your place in chronicles
[37:12] here but let's turn to first kings
[37:15] first kings chapter four let's just look
[37:18] at this example
[37:23] of solomon first kings chapter 4 verse
[37:26] 29.
[37:32] first kings 4 and 29 and god gave
[37:35] solomon wisdom
[37:36] and understanding exceeding much
[37:38] enlarges in the heart
[37:39] and largeness of heart even as the sand
[37:42] that is on the seashore
[37:43] and solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom
[37:45] of all the children of the east country
[37:47] and all the wisdom of egypt for he was
[37:49] wiser than all men
[37:51] than ethan the azerite and heman the
[37:54] choco
[37:55] and chokhal and darda the sons of moho
[37:57] and his fame was in all nations round
[37:59] about
[38:00] and he spake three thousand proverbs and
[38:03] his songs were a thousand and five
[38:05] and he spake of trees from the cedar
[38:07] tree that is in lebanon even unto the
[38:09] hyssop that springeth out of the wall
[38:11] he spake also a beast and a thousand of
[38:13] creepy things and of fishes
[38:15] and there came of all people to hear the
[38:17] wisdom of solomon
[38:19] from all the kings of the earth which
[38:20] had heard of his wisdom
[38:23] let's go back to second chronicles now
[38:27] you see she came and tried him with hard
[38:29] questions
[38:30] and and it's amazing
[38:34] that uh nothing was hit
[38:38] of all of her questions but but we
[38:40] wonder
[38:41] what was she asking we talked about this
[38:43] on sunday and we bring it right up to
[38:45] today
[38:45] i mean everything that that happened
[38:48] then is happening now in a form
[38:50] and a greater than solomon is here that
[38:52] same spirit that was there giving
[38:53] solomon wisdom
[38:54] we saw in jesus christ we saw return in
[38:57] this day
[38:58] and a prophet and and like we talked
[39:00] about sunday amen
[39:01] who told us about the war in heaven who
[39:04] told us
[39:04] what's wrong with our flesh who told us
[39:08] why
[39:08] there has to be a blood sacrifice why a
[39:10] human had to shed blood
[39:12] amen to redeem us back who told us what
[39:14] happened in the garden of eden amen
[39:16] who told us how the earth got in this
[39:18] condition
[39:19] tilted off of its axes spinning out here
[39:21] in an elliptical orbit who told us that
[39:24] amen it wasn't just the prophet of god
[39:27] it was a greater than
[39:28] solomon that revealed it through the
[39:29] prophet of god
[39:31] the wisdom that talked of birds and
[39:33] beasts and trees and of nature and all
[39:34] this
[39:35] and brother banham will come and he'll
[39:36] talk of of trees and nature
[39:39] and he'll tell us that an atomic bomb
[39:42] burst and
[39:43] and threw the earth away from the sun
[39:45] and then in the the water the fountains
[39:47] of the deep broke open and there was
[39:48] condensation of the
[39:50] of the the atmosphere and it began to
[39:52] rain and
[39:53] where else can you find this
[39:56] i wonder if solomon was able to tell the
[39:58] queen of sheba some of these things
[40:01] i wonder if solomon could tell how
[40:03] hybridization came into the human race
[40:06] i wonder if he could tell her answer all
[40:08] her hard questions
[40:11] what about dinosaurs
[40:14] why what are their fossil records where
[40:16] that's from the prophet told us
[40:19] you see a greater than solomon is here
[40:25] oh what about what hybrid food does to
[40:27] us
[40:31] amen what about the fur the pyramid and
[40:33] what it was all about
[40:36] you see a greater than solomon is here
[40:40] and he proved it she came amen and she
[40:43] asked hard questions
[40:44] and she got answers to all that was in
[40:46] her heart amen and we didn't even know
[40:48] to ask these questions but god was still
[40:50] giving us answers that we didn't even
[40:51] know we had questions for yet
[40:53] we were so far away from god and so
[40:56] misunderstood the bible that we didn't
[40:58] even have the questions
[40:59] but he had already gave us the answers
[41:02] the nomination that had taken us so far
[41:04] away from the reality of the word
[41:06] and into a fairy tale to a watered-down
[41:08] gospel that we didn't even know to ask
[41:10] how do we get in this condition and why
[41:12] did it have to be a blood sacrifice
[41:14] why are humans sacrificed why virgin
[41:16] birth
[41:18] but praise god but the revelation of
[41:20] serpent seed it reveals why a virgin
[41:22] birth and why a blood sacrifice
[41:26] but we didn't even know to ask that
[41:28] question we were so far gone amen but
[41:30] greater than solomon was here working
[41:32] through a human vessel to give us
[41:34] answers that we would cut that we needed
[41:36] to have answers to
[41:37] even though we were so far gone we
[41:39] didn't yet have the questions
[41:41] i say the queen of sheba is probably
[41:42] further along than we were when we stuck
[41:44] in denominationalism
[41:48] amen and hebrews 4 12 says for the word
[41:51] of god is quick and powerful and sharper
[41:52] than any two-edged sword piercing even
[41:54] to the dividing asunder
[41:56] of soul and spirit of joints and morrow
[41:58] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[42:00] intents of the heart
[42:02] neither is there any creature that is
[42:03] not manifest in his sight but all things
[42:05] are naked and open unto the eyes of him
[42:08] in whom we have to do when they
[42:11] when they stood before solomon in
[42:13] judgment i'm sure they felt naked
[42:16] when he judged the two harlots he
[42:18] absolutely unveiled the whole
[42:20] the whole scene with just a little bit
[42:22] of wisdom i'm sure
[42:23] because the word is the discerner amen
[42:25] it's not the man it's the word that's
[42:27] the discernment
[42:31] i want to read that more carefully it
[42:32] says the word of god the word of god is
[42:34] who we're talking about the word of god
[42:36] is quick and powerful right
[42:41] further down it says neither is there
[42:43] neither
[42:44] is there any creature that is not
[42:45] manifest in his sight
[42:49] the word of god his sight see the word
[42:52] of god is not just a sterile thing
[42:54] that's printed on paper
[42:56] the word of god is a he and nothing is
[43:00] not hid before his sights
[43:03] well the realm says in the message
[43:04] shalom no wonder he said the queen of
[43:06] the south
[43:07] shall rise in the judgment with her
[43:09] generation and condemn this one because
[43:10] she came from the uttermost parts of the
[43:12] earth
[43:13] to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold
[43:16] a greater than solomon is here
[43:19] how that little queen way down a heathen
[43:22] saw that light and come from miles
[43:25] through the desert
[43:26] three months on a camel's back to hear
[43:28] the wisdom of solomon and them standing
[43:30] right there with solomon being a type a
[43:32] figure of him
[43:32] they were standing right there with
[43:33] jesus they were missing he said it
[43:34] greater than solomon she's going to
[43:36] judge this generation amen because she
[43:38] came
[43:38] why she heard a rumor about what was
[43:41] happening and she would give every she
[43:43] would pack up
[43:44] so much goods and so much effort to
[43:46] travel three months on camelback just to
[43:48] find out if it was true or not amen and
[43:50] brother bennett said and we won't even
[43:51] cross the street
[43:54] but he says she saw that light and then
[43:57] she saw
[43:58] that light what light it was the light
[44:00] of the word friends it was the light of
[44:02] christ
[44:02] it was the same light that's on top of
[44:04] the new jerusalem
[44:05] she saw that light and she came to that
[44:08] light and now there's a prophecy that
[44:10] the gentiles will come to his life
[44:12] and here's a gentile queen coming to
[44:14] that light
[44:15] it wasn't a physical light it was the
[44:17] illumination of the
[44:18] understanding that god had given to
[44:20] mankind
[44:21] and that light is still shining at the
[44:23] top of new jerusalem
[44:24] and there's people that's going to find
[44:26] their way to this light and what is it
[44:28] it's
[44:28] understanding it's enlightenment amen
[44:30] it's it's saying
[44:32] i can see what made you see the light
[44:34] what light a greater than solomon is
[44:37] here
[44:38] where is he he's on the throne at the
[44:40] top of the of the pyramid
[44:42] of the church who else
[44:45] knows i mean let's look in this day
[44:48] friends who else on this planet
[44:50] knows why there was a virgin birth what
[44:52] happened in the garden what happened in
[44:54] war in heaven amen why the earth is
[44:56] tilted away
[44:56] from the sun who else knows those things
[44:59] who else knows where the dinosaur bones
[45:01] came from
[45:04] praise god because there's a light at
[45:07] the top of mount zion
[45:10] there's a light we've come through seven
[45:12] church ages capped off in this day in
[45:14] the bright age
[45:15] and there's a light at the top of the
[45:16] mountain amen and people see that light
[45:19] and they're coming to the light
[45:21] it's the illumination of a greater than
[45:23] solomon it's a wisdom of the word
[45:29] now i want to look i want to move from
[45:30] that and i want to look at
[45:32] something else here in chapter 8. we
[45:35] back up to chapter 8
[45:36] second corinthians chapter 8. verse 12.
[45:40] i want to read a couple scriptures in
[45:42] succession from here and then over in
[45:43] first kings
[45:45] in the latest foundation and talk about
[45:47] it for a minute
[45:49] then solomon offered burnt offering unto
[45:51] the lord on the altar of the lord
[45:53] which he had built before the porch even
[45:56] after a certain rate every day
[45:58] off offering according to the
[46:00] commandment of moses
[46:01] on the sabbaths and on the new moons and
[46:03] on the sodom feast three times in the
[46:05] year
[46:06] even in the feast of unleavened bread in
[46:07] the feast of weeks and in the feast of
[46:09] tabernacles
[46:10] and he appointed according to the order
[46:12] of david's father the courses of the
[46:14] priests
[46:15] to their service and the levites to
[46:17] their charges to praise and minister
[46:19] before the priest is the duty of every
[46:21] day required
[46:22] the porters also by their courses at
[46:24] every gate for so had david the man of
[46:27] god commanded
[46:28] and they departed not from the
[46:30] commandment of the king unto the priests
[46:31] and levites concerning the matter of
[46:33] concerning the treasures
[46:36] so david had given instruction for the
[46:40] order of the levites for praise for
[46:41] worship reporters for sacrifices
[46:43] and solomon does exactly what his father
[46:46] says
[46:47] whatsoever my father showed me that's
[46:49] what i do and he set
[46:50] and ordered the worship in the temple he
[46:53] didn't just build a temple he said in
[46:55] order the worship
[46:56] the sacrifice he kept the law he kept
[46:59] the word and he kept the commandments of
[47:00] his father
[47:01] and he established an order to worship
[47:04] and there's a reason we're saying this
[47:05] and just hold that in your mind
[47:07] go over to first kings
[47:10] chapter four
[47:14] first kings chapter four and verse one
[47:18] i'm going to read two more pat passages
[47:20] and hopefully tie this together
[47:22] first kings chapter 4 verse 1.
[47:26] so king solomon was king over israel all
[47:28] israel
[47:29] and there were the princes which he had
[47:31] azariah the son of
[47:33] zadok the priest elohoraf and ahaya the
[47:36] sons of
[47:37] shisha the scribes jehoshaphat the son
[47:39] of ahilu the recorder
[47:41] banaya the son of jehoiada was over the
[47:43] host and zadok and ebe aether with a
[47:45] priest
[47:46] and azariah the sons the son of nathan
[47:48] was over the officers
[47:50] and zaboon the son of nathan was
[47:52] principal officer and the king's friend
[47:54] and ashar was over the household and
[47:57] adina ram the son of
[47:58] abdu was over the tribute and solomon
[48:01] had 12
[48:02] office officers over all israel which
[48:04] provided
[48:06] vittles for the king and his household
[48:08] each
[48:09] man his month in a year and made
[48:11] provisions
[48:12] a scoot skip over to verse 21 and
[48:14] solomon reigned over all the kingdom
[48:16] from the river into the land of the
[48:18] philistines and unto the border of egypt
[48:20] they brought presents and served solomon
[48:22] all the days of his life
[48:24] and solomon's provision for one day now
[48:27] this is the food that was provided for
[48:29] one day
[48:31] solomon's provision for one day was 30
[48:33] measures of fine flour
[48:35] three score 60 measures of meal
[48:39] the 10 fat oxen 20 oxen out of the
[48:42] pastures
[48:43] a hundred sheep besides hearts and robux
[48:46] and followed deer
[48:47] and fatted foul how many people was he
[48:51] feeding
[48:54] for he had dominion over all the region
[48:56] on this side of the river from
[48:58] tipsa even to aza over the kings on
[49:01] this side of the river and he had peace
[49:03] on all sides around about him and judah
[49:05] and israel dwelt safely
[49:07] every man under his vine under his fig
[49:09] tree from dan
[49:10] even to beersheba all the days of
[49:12] solomon this
[49:13] this verse 25 smacks of the millennium
[49:17] same verbage same thing every man
[49:19] dwelled peaceably under his vine
[49:20] and under his fig tree from dan to be
[49:22] shiva all the days of solomon
[49:25] and solomon had 40 000 stalls of horses
[49:27] for his chariots and 12 000 horsemen
[49:30] and those officers provided vittles for
[49:32] king solomon and for all that came into
[49:34] the king solomon's table
[49:36] every man in his month they lacked
[49:38] nothing barley also in straw for the
[49:40] horse and dromedaries
[49:41] brought them to the place where the
[49:43] officers were
[49:44] every man according to his charge
[49:49] now let's get to the point
[49:53] back over to second chronicles or yes
[49:57] second chronicles where were we chapter
[50:01] nine
[50:06] now let's get to the point of all of
[50:09] that
[50:10] solomon ordered according to the word of
[50:11] david the worship in the temple he made
[50:13] sure it went right
[50:15] made sure it was done right he
[50:16] established the order of
[50:18] the every 12 month an officer over the
[50:20] charge bringing
[50:21] all this food feeding so many people
[50:24] officers of this and treasurers and and
[50:27] recorders and
[50:28] and uh captains of the host and soldiers
[50:31] he had all of these things going
[50:33] now let's read from verse three chapter
[50:35] nine second chronicles chapter nine
[50:36] verse three
[50:38] and when the queen of sheba had seen the
[50:40] wisdom of solomon
[50:41] and the house that he had built and the
[50:43] meat of his table
[50:47] and the sitting of his servants and the
[50:49] attendants of his ministers
[50:51] and their apparel
[50:54] see it wasn't just solomon's wisdom in
[50:57] answering her questions that caught her
[50:59] eye
[51:02] it was the order of the kingdom
[51:05] it was the meat of the table it was the
[51:08] attendance of his ministers
[51:10] and their apparel
[51:15] his cup bearers also and their apparel
[51:18] his ascent by which he went up to the
[51:20] house of the lord there was
[51:22] no more spirit in her
[51:25] it took her breath away when she
[51:28] he answered all of her hard questions
[51:30] she there was nothing hid from her but
[51:32] it wasn't just the wisdom
[51:34] because the wisdom had to bring a life
[51:36] it was the wisdom and the life
[51:37] together when she heard the wisdom and
[51:40] saw the life there was no more spirit in
[51:42] her
[51:42] amen this is written this way for a
[51:44] reason friends
[51:45] amen because you can get the wisdom that
[51:47] comes from the message and not have the
[51:49] life
[51:50] and when you don't have the life i want
[51:51] to know where is the light that's
[51:53] attracting the gentile queen
[51:56] that's bringing her from afar out of her
[51:58] denomination
[51:59] out of her wrong standing and then
[52:00] causing her to travel
[52:02] on a camel for three months and bring
[52:04] all of her substance to lay at the feet
[52:06] of solomon
[52:07] what is it amen what took her breath
[52:08] away was not just the wisdom that the
[52:10] message contains
[52:11] but the life that it brings to the
[52:13] church because a greater than solomon is
[52:16] here and if a greater is solomon here
[52:18] there should be a greater witness than
[52:20] she saw in solomon's courts
[52:22] because if solomon's wisdom amen and is
[52:25] keeping the order of the word in the
[52:26] order
[52:27] of the worship amen could do that to
[52:29] that gentile queen
[52:30] why should a greater than solomon here
[52:32] today working in our lives
[52:34] through the wisdom of the word that's
[52:35] been given what should it do to us today
[52:37] friends
[52:39] amen when i when i came from afar amen
[52:43] from afar
[52:44] and i came to the church it wasn't just
[52:47] the tapes say man it wasn't just the
[52:48] preaching
[52:49] that was the initial attraction i saw
[52:51] the light on top of zion
[52:52] i came but when i saw the families in an
[52:55] order when i saw the women dressed like
[52:57] women the men
[52:57] act like men men taking responsibility
[53:00] for their families
[53:01] the church said in order the order of
[53:03] worship i had no more spirit in me
[53:05] it took my breath away i couldn't resist
[53:08] it any longer
[53:10] and after it took her breath away
[53:12] everything she had brought she piled at
[53:14] solomon's feet
[53:17] see the two have to go together
[53:23] he he had to purge
[53:26] he had to do a purging friends of all
[53:30] the false spirits
[53:31] because all those spirits that were
[53:32] purged were lovers of self
[53:36] we're selfish self-centered with
[53:39] self-desire self-motives
[53:43] if that would have stayed in the kingdom
[53:45] and not got purged there would have been
[53:47] nothing for the queen to see
[53:50] because it would have divided it would
[53:51] have caused strife there would have been
[53:53] no harmony
[53:54] amen but every when she what the queen
[53:56] saw
[53:57] when she saw everything sat in order
[54:00] amen the order of worship
[54:01] the order of families amen the order of
[54:04] the song service
[54:05] the dress of the people the order of the
[54:07] trustees the order of the sunday school
[54:09] teachers amen the order of the moms the
[54:11] order of the dads to order the teenagers
[54:13] to order the little kids
[54:15] do you get what i'm saying when she saw
[54:18] it all working together and working in
[54:20] harmony there was no more spirit in her
[54:22] she knew this was the real deal this was
[54:25] it friends and what i was told amen was
[54:28] only
[54:29] half amen of the wisdom because the word
[54:32] the word the word had put the kingdom in
[54:34] a golden age
[54:36] and the word can bring us ourselves our
[54:39] lives amen our own flesh into a golden
[54:41] age
[54:41] amen spiritually we can come to a golden
[54:44] age
[54:44] where the inside man can conquer the
[54:46] outside man and bring it subject to the
[54:48] word of god
[54:52] be to god this isn't the time to hear
[54:55] the wisdom
[54:56] and be like zeda or be like abby athar
[54:59] or
[54:59] shimmy i or joab and have self-interest
[55:02] and self-motives
[55:03] in order for them to pull off what was
[55:05] pulled off in the kingdom
[55:06] amen they all had to find their position
[55:08] and find their place
[55:09] under solomon's wisdom and every joint
[55:12] had to supply
[55:14] within 20 years they had built his
[55:16] palace
[55:17] and they built the house of the lord
[55:19] they needed craftsmen they needed
[55:20] mechanics they needed embroiders
[55:22] they need those that can do engraving
[55:24] those that could cast gold
[55:25] amen the priest had to be set in order
[55:28] they had to know how to bring the daily
[55:29] sacrifice how to do the special feast
[55:31] amen what portion went where it took
[55:35] it took years to get this kind of order
[55:37] amen it was at least
[55:38] 20 years because she shows up after the
[55:41] temple
[55:41] has been inaugurated and established and
[55:43] it took 20 years to complete that
[55:46] so under it wasn't like solomon shows up
[55:49] in day one everything's in order no
[55:51] solomon's got to judge this and judge
[55:53] that
[55:53] amen it was three years before shimmy i
[55:55] met his destruction
[55:58] he gave him space to repent he gave him
[56:00] time to try out the spirit
[56:02] amen and after three years he proved
[56:04] what he really was and that was purged
[56:05] out
[56:06] so it's not that everything happened
[56:08] overnight amen it took
[56:10] years it took years to purge this out
[56:12] and years to purge that
[56:13] out years to purge this out amen then
[56:16] years to establish this order in this
[56:19] order and this order
[56:22] he had 12 captains 12
[56:25] princes that were over the king's
[56:28] provisions one over every month
[56:30] amen and he had to work i would imagine
[56:32] this is just for the chad
[56:34] but if you saw what the daily allowance
[56:36] was
[56:38] daily 10 oxen fatted
[56:41] 10 oxen from the patch a hundred sheep
[56:45] sixty measures of this and so
[56:48] you see that's every day and each one of
[56:51] these
[56:51] princes were in charge of 30 days
[56:56] i imagine they had to work all year
[57:00] with how many people
[57:03] to gather all the provisions just to
[57:06] meet their obligation for one month
[57:09] so one day i mean one day would take me
[57:13] a lifetime together
[57:17] for one day of the king's portion would
[57:19] take me a lifetime
[57:20] i mean these guys didn't do it by
[57:22] themselves there was hundreds and
[57:24] hundreds of people working together to
[57:27] provide meat for the king's table
[57:29] amen for one month times
[57:32] 12. each prince amen had his region amen
[57:36] and in his region
[57:37] he had those that that he was over and
[57:39] they had farmers of grain and farmers of
[57:41] cattle and farmers of sheep and
[57:43] all of these that were putting together
[57:45] and storing up and laying aside
[57:47] and putting away because their 30 days
[57:50] were coming
[57:52] and the prince may have been the one and
[57:54] a few others who delivered to the
[57:55] kingdom
[57:56] but the farmer on the backside of mount
[57:58] gilead
[57:59] over by mount hermon amen he's the one
[58:01] who's making it happen
[58:04] right when she saw the meat at the table
[58:07] she
[58:08] wasn't just seeing a a nice cut of meat
[58:11] amen but the whole kingdom was working
[58:13] to get that meat on the table
[58:16] the whole body of israel pulled together
[58:18] was working to support the ministry that
[58:20] god gave
[58:21] was supporting the word the wisdom the
[58:23] light that was in israel
[58:25] the whole body was laboring and they
[58:28] didn't all have the same job but they
[58:29] all had something to do
[58:31] from the tiniest to like the most
[58:33] profound amen
[58:34] the guy who made the menorah amen was no
[58:36] less than the guy who was raising the
[58:38] wheat for the king's table
[58:40] because when the queen saw it all she
[58:43] saw it all
[58:44] she saw the minister she saw the meat at
[58:45] the table she saw their clothing
[58:47] who made the clothing who raised the
[58:51] sheep that grew the wool and sheared the
[58:53] wool and
[58:55] you see what she saw was not just a cup
[58:58] bearer there's a pair on a minister
[58:59] there's a barrel and meet at his table
[59:01] and she saw the order by the way he went
[59:03] up to the lord's house amen she was
[59:05] saw the order of worship she saw
[59:09] the conduct of all those that were
[59:11] serving this gift
[59:12] serving the word and when she saw all of
[59:16] that
[59:16] she wasn't just seeing the handful of
[59:18] people she was seeing an
[59:20] entire group of people work together
[59:23] for this word for the message that they
[59:26] had
[59:27] for for the for the dispensation that
[59:29] they were in
[59:31] under solomon and i want to say there's
[59:33] a greater than solomon that's here
[59:37] if you could have a farmer in obscurity
[59:39] raising weed or raising an
[59:41] auction to send it to the king's table
[59:43] who would never get credit for that
[59:45] never know outside of his local region
[59:46] what he did amen if he would do that for
[59:48] solomon what are we to do for a greater
[59:50] than solomon
[59:52] if we never get noticed we never get in
[59:54] the limelight our name never gets
[59:55] mentioned we never eat at the king's
[59:57] table
[59:57] amen we never become a prince amen can
[1:00:00] we be happy on the backside of mount
[1:00:01] gilead
[1:00:02] under the shadow of hermann amen doing
[1:00:04] our part to support the ministry
[1:00:06] to support the word in this day
[1:00:10] what did what did the queen of sheba see
[1:00:13] the queen of sheba saw a people rally
[1:00:15] around the word
[1:00:18] she saw people support solomon's support
[1:00:21] all that he was doing and what was
[1:00:22] solomon doing solomon was bringing back
[1:00:24] correct worship they made correct
[1:00:26] placement
[1:00:27] purging out false spirits bringing a
[1:00:29] golden age amen and there's a greater
[1:00:31] than solomon here to bring a golden age
[1:00:33] in your life and in my life and to the
[1:00:34] bride of jesus christ
[1:00:36] and what are we going to do amen we're
[1:00:38] going to let that amen that ministry
[1:00:40] that wisdom put us in our place and
[1:00:42] we're going to give everything we got
[1:00:46] so so many people we talk about so many
[1:00:48] times and i've struggled with this in my
[1:00:50] past
[1:00:50] what's my position in my body what am i
[1:00:52] supposed to be doing
[1:00:54] does anybody ever ask that question
[1:00:59] don't worry about what you're supposed
[1:01:01] to do banaya didn't ask that question
[1:01:04] zadok didn't ask that question solomon
[1:01:06] didn't ask that question
[1:01:09] brazilian i didn't ask that question his
[1:01:11] sons didn't ask that question
[1:01:13] what did they do they did what was in
[1:01:15] their hand they did what they were told
[1:01:17] they did what they could they were
[1:01:19] faithful in every station of life
[1:01:22] and the king put them in position
[1:01:26] sometimes we drag our feet doing nothing
[1:01:29] waiting for god to tell us what our
[1:01:30] position in the body is
[1:01:33] and if it doesn't come with a title
[1:01:35] trustee deacon
[1:01:36] minister pastor evangelist then it
[1:01:38] doesn't feel like a position in the body
[1:01:43] see we're just going to route the devil
[1:01:44] out right now we're just going to root
[1:01:46] him out of every crack in every crevice
[1:01:49] you tell me a father and mother living
[1:01:51] this word in their home is not as
[1:01:53] important as a minister
[1:01:54] in the pulpit they're every bit as
[1:01:56] important as a minister in the pulpit
[1:01:58] a daddy who will give godly instruction
[1:02:00] to children and raise him in the fear
[1:02:01] and admonition of the lord
[1:02:03] amen it might be the farmer growing oxen
[1:02:05] under the mount herman
[1:02:06] but amen it matters at the king's table
[1:02:09] when the queen's looking and when she
[1:02:10] sees it
[1:02:11] she recognizes god is in this place and
[1:02:13] it takes her breath away
[1:02:17] see it's not it's not about if i only
[1:02:19] knew what my position was if i only knew
[1:02:21] what i'm supposed to do in the body
[1:02:23] amen wrong idea god has put you here god
[1:02:26] has brought you to the word
[1:02:27] god has given you something he's given
[1:02:29] you a husband a wife a child
[1:02:31] amen he may i ask you to teach sunday
[1:02:33] school he may give you
[1:02:34] something to do but whatever you find in
[1:02:36] your hand to do do it with all thy might
[1:02:38] amen
[1:02:39] do it with everything you've got and do
[1:02:40] it for the lord do it for the greater
[1:02:42] than solomon that's here
[1:02:44] raise your children for the king amen
[1:02:46] serve your husband for the king care for
[1:02:48] your wife for the king
[1:02:49] come to church in the order of worship
[1:02:51] for the king
[1:02:52] [Applause]
[1:02:54] don't worry about what i'm supposed to
[1:02:55] do god is giving you what you're
[1:02:57] supposed to do do it amen
[1:02:59] and whatever comes next he'll give it to
[1:03:01] you he'll put it in your hand he'll call
[1:03:02] you to a work
[1:03:04] many times you're established right in
[1:03:06] your position and don't even know it
[1:03:08] because we can't put a title on it
[1:03:12] the farmer who's under herman amen
[1:03:15] raising sheep
[1:03:16] and dividing a portion of that to go
[1:03:18] with everybody else in the region who
[1:03:19] cuts a portion who's gathered by the
[1:03:21] prince who brings 100 sheep per
[1:03:23] day for a month amen so so that the
[1:03:25] queen of sheba can see the meat on the
[1:03:26] table and recognize that god's in this
[1:03:28] place
[1:03:28] he may not have known the full extent of
[1:03:30] his impact
[1:03:32] he may not have realized it was his lamb
[1:03:34] chop on the table that day
[1:03:40] you see what i'm saying friends but he's
[1:03:43] raising for his family he's raising for
[1:03:45] himself and cutting out a portion
[1:03:46] this is what i can do for the kingdom
[1:03:51] he may have not thought it was much but
[1:03:54] the queen of sheba recognized it was god
[1:03:58] and it took her breath away your moms
[1:04:01] are at home with your babies raising
[1:04:02] them up teaching them bibles and
[1:04:04] teaching them manners
[1:04:05] teaching them basic respect teaching
[1:04:07] them how to sit through a service
[1:04:10] it may just seem like i'm just farming
[1:04:11] i'm just all it is is i just
[1:04:13] i cut a few barrels of wheat off to the
[1:04:16] side to go with the portion of everybody
[1:04:18] else in the area that goes with a bigger
[1:04:19] portion that gets
[1:04:21] swallowed up in a huge amount that
[1:04:23] nobody notices
[1:04:26] god keeps good records
[1:04:29] a greater than solomon is here
[1:04:34] we are in position god put you in this
[1:04:36] body for a reason
[1:04:38] god brought you to this message for a
[1:04:39] reason god called you to this word for a
[1:04:42] reason
[1:04:42] god put you in contact under the great
[1:04:45] king the greater than solomon and you're
[1:04:46] in the kingdom for a reason
[1:04:49] don't doubt it don't question it don't
[1:04:51] look for a work to do
[1:04:52] whatever's in your hand do it if it's a
[1:04:54] mother if it's a father if it's a single
[1:04:56] amen
[1:04:57] it doesn't matter what it is whatever
[1:04:59] god has put in your hand do it amen if
[1:05:01] it's for you to be faithful to come to
[1:05:03] the house of the lord just to encourage
[1:05:04] somebody else who sees you faithfully
[1:05:06] come
[1:05:06] do it with all your heart come to church
[1:05:09] for the king amen
[1:05:11] amen read your bible pray for the king
[1:05:13] come to prayer time for the king
[1:05:15] whatever it is that you can do do it for
[1:05:18] the king
[1:05:22] banaya didn't ask to be captain of the
[1:05:25] host
[1:05:28] banaya joined to david after he heard
[1:05:31] that david had been anointed by samuel
[1:05:33] uh yeah by samuel and he was fleeing
[1:05:35] from saul and running from cave to cave
[1:05:37] amen bania went not to get anything not
[1:05:40] to be anybody
[1:05:41] he went because this is the word
[1:05:45] and he served that word from this cave
[1:05:47] to that cave and amen amen when
[1:05:50] when he needed to break through a line
[1:05:51] of philistines he served there and when
[1:05:53] he had to go into a snowy pit
[1:05:54] and then go into a pit on a snowy day
[1:05:56] and kill a lion he did it
[1:05:58] not to be captain of the host to serve
[1:06:01] the word
[1:06:03] the lion was there he was there he
[1:06:05] killed the lion he didn't kill the lion
[1:06:07] to get promoted the captain of the host
[1:06:08] he did what was there
[1:06:11] do you understand what i'm saying he
[1:06:13] whatever was in his hand he did
[1:06:15] amen and god moved him amen from the
[1:06:18] captain over a small band going from
[1:06:20] cave to cave
[1:06:21] then he put him over the parasites and
[1:06:23] the
[1:06:24] cherozites i think that's what you call
[1:06:25] them
[1:06:27] the special guard for david his special
[1:06:30] army then he put him over that
[1:06:32] and then after the whole thing with job
[1:06:34] transpired then he put him over the
[1:06:35] captain of the whole host
[1:06:36] see he was never looking for a position
[1:06:38] he was never asking what my title is he
[1:06:40] was never saying what can i do
[1:06:42] amen what am i supposed to do he just
[1:06:44] did what was in his heart
[1:06:46] he served the word he served the word in
[1:06:49] printing he served the word and
[1:06:50] perforating he served the word
[1:06:52] and cleaning amen he served the word and
[1:06:54] serving a meal amen working at a funeral
[1:06:56] dinner
[1:06:59] helping at a wedding taking a meal to
[1:07:01] somebody who's sick
[1:07:02] writing out a card of encouragement
[1:07:06] see what i'm saying friends when the
[1:07:09] queen of sheba
[1:07:10] sees under the rule of a greater than
[1:07:12] solomon sees
[1:07:13] every joint supplying working together
[1:07:16] for love not for promotion for love
[1:07:19] not for gain for love amen recognizing
[1:07:22] the day we're in recognizing who is here
[1:07:24] recognizing whom we serve
[1:07:28] not to get noticed by the congregation
[1:07:30] not to get noticed by the pastor
[1:07:33] but if nobody ever notices i will raise
[1:07:37] the best sheep that i can raise
[1:07:41] because a little bit of this goes to the
[1:07:42] king's table
[1:07:45] and these five sheep i give won't even
[1:07:47] make a whole day's worth of food
[1:07:52] you realize how insignificant you can
[1:07:54] feel
[1:07:55] he eats a hundred sheep a day
[1:07:58] i can only give five i can't even give a
[1:08:01] whole day's worth
[1:08:04] but these five these five are good
[1:08:07] sheep they've been well cared for i've
[1:08:09] reared them by hand
[1:08:11] amen there's not a blemish on them the
[1:08:13] muscling is perfect they're the best of
[1:08:15] my flock
[1:08:16] i got the best genetics i breed the best
[1:08:18] to the best amen i take the best care i
[1:08:20] i feed him in the best pastures with the
[1:08:22] coolest running water amen
[1:08:24] whatever i give to the king is the best
[1:08:28] and when the king eats that lamb chop
[1:08:30] amen or that leg of lamb
[1:08:31] he might delight in that leg and have no
[1:08:35] idea who took such tender care
[1:08:39] of this lamb to provide his meat that
[1:08:41] day
[1:08:42] or the king's guest who comes from sheba
[1:08:46] and the farmer may never know that it
[1:08:49] was his
[1:08:50] portion that made it on her plate that
[1:08:52] caused her heart
[1:08:54] to fail within her
[1:08:57] see there's a greater than solomon here
[1:09:02] we should have among us greater than
[1:09:04] what the queen of sheba
[1:09:06] saw the word we have is a discerner of
[1:09:09] the thoughts and intents are
[1:09:10] we have discernment in our midst how
[1:09:12] many will raise your hand and say the
[1:09:14] word has discerned me
[1:09:16] we have discernment in our midst not a
[1:09:18] man amen the word that's been restored
[1:09:20] to us in this day
[1:09:22] we have the wisdom that solomon spoke of
[1:09:25] of trees and of birds and of nature
[1:09:27] and of all things that we ever wondered
[1:09:29] about
[1:09:32] right brother branham tells us
[1:09:35] hey you know they built the pyramids
[1:09:36] with some sort of atomic power or
[1:09:38] something like that
[1:09:39] they're still trying to figure out how
[1:09:40] they built the pyramids and we know
[1:09:45] why because of greater than solomon is
[1:09:47] here
[1:09:49] but it's not just the wisdom without the
[1:09:50] life
[1:09:52] it's the wisdom brings a golden age
[1:09:55] and a golden age brings a body of
[1:09:58] believers who will rally around this
[1:09:59] king
[1:10:00] and give everything they've got to the
[1:10:01] king
[1:10:03] to support
[1:10:06] just the daily provision of food
[1:10:11] is extraordinary the amount of
[1:10:14] management planning tracking
[1:10:17] overseers supervisors storage facilities
[1:10:20] transportation
[1:10:23] if i would pick one of you out and say
[1:10:25] now listen for a month
[1:10:28] i need this grocery list
[1:10:33] how many workers do you need how many
[1:10:35] store houses do you need
[1:10:37] how many wagons of transportation how
[1:10:39] many oxen
[1:10:40] and donkeys and camels is it going to
[1:10:42] take just to get it here
[1:10:44] where are we going to keep it how are we
[1:10:46] going to keep bandits from it how are we
[1:10:47] going to keep rodents away from how are
[1:10:49] we going to keep it and give it to the
[1:10:50] king every
[1:10:50] you realize it's a much more monumental
[1:10:53] task than just the two verses it takes
[1:10:54] to explain it
[1:10:56] anybody who's been in logistics or in
[1:10:58] business they're like there is no way
[1:11:00] i'm so glad i wasn't one of them 12
[1:11:02] princes
[1:11:07] i mean what do you do if you have crop
[1:11:08] damage
[1:11:10] you gotta still get food to the king
[1:11:15] see it was huge it was a huge
[1:11:19] undertaking the order of the service the
[1:11:22] order of the temple was huge
[1:11:24] it took an army of priests the daily
[1:11:27] sacrifices were huge
[1:11:30] the the order of the service was huge
[1:11:33] the daily meet was huge
[1:11:35] the servants that would clean that would
[1:11:37] transport
[1:11:38] that would notify that would record that
[1:11:41] we're over the treasury
[1:11:43] that that would count the daily money
[1:11:45] coming in
[1:11:46] amen that that would would buy would
[1:11:48] sell i mean it was a huge undertaking
[1:11:52] what the queen of sheba saw was
[1:11:55] more than just the wisdom of a man
[1:12:00] she saw she saw what christ can do
[1:12:03] in a body of believers
[1:12:08] let's turn to ephesians chapter four
[1:12:11] let's bring it right to the new
[1:12:12] testament
[1:12:14] as we wind down
[1:12:17] ephesians chapter four
[1:12:23] brother branham says in questions and
[1:12:25] answers on the seals
[1:12:27] preaches it sunday morning before he
[1:12:29] preaches the seventh seal
[1:12:31] the question is would the bride of
[1:12:32] christ have would the bride of christ
[1:12:34] have a ministry before the rapture
[1:12:37] he said sure that's what's going on
[1:12:39] right now the bride of christ certainly
[1:12:41] it's the message of the hour
[1:12:43] the bride of christ sure she consists of
[1:12:44] apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[1:12:46] and pastors
[1:12:47] is that right that's the bride of christ
[1:12:49] sure she's got a ministry great ministry
[1:12:51] it's the ministry of the hour
[1:12:53] it'll be so humble now we look at that
[1:12:56] brother branham makes a statement is the
[1:12:58] bride have a ministry before the rep
[1:12:59] sure it's what's going on right now it's
[1:13:00] the message of the hour it consists of
[1:13:02] apostle prophet
[1:13:03] and you can automatically say well i
[1:13:04] don't have one of those titles i'm out
[1:13:05] of the bride's ministry
[1:13:08] don't miss it let's go to ephesians 4.
[1:13:12] verse 11. and he gave some apostles and
[1:13:15] some prophets and some evangelists and
[1:13:17] some pastors and teachers
[1:13:19] four now listen
[1:13:23] there was a reason he gave these
[1:13:25] ministry gifts
[1:13:27] let's find out what they're for and
[1:13:29] we'll find out what brother branham is
[1:13:31] referring to in the ministry of the
[1:13:32] bride
[1:13:34] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[1:13:36] work of the ministry
[1:13:38] for the edifying of the body of christ
[1:13:40] to build up the body of christ
[1:13:44] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:13:46] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[1:13:47] god
[1:13:48] and to a perfect man unto the measure of
[1:13:50] the stature of the fullness of christ
[1:13:52] now this points right back to adoption
[1:13:55] the fullness of the stature of christ
[1:13:57] points right back to adoption
[1:13:59] amen where where in adoption points to
[1:14:02] positional placing
[1:14:04] so that means the fivefold ministry is
[1:14:06] here for the perfecting
[1:14:07] of the the body of christ to build
[1:14:10] everyone up into the stature of a
[1:14:12] perfect man
[1:14:13] to bring them up to what amen to sow the
[1:14:15] word and to bring somebody as they grow
[1:14:17] under the leadership of the holy ghost
[1:14:18] and under the ministry of the word
[1:14:20] to grow them up into a place where they
[1:14:21] can be positioned in the body and be a
[1:14:23] contributor
[1:14:24] that's why the fivefold ministry is here
[1:14:26] for positional placing that's part of
[1:14:29] the
[1:14:29] that's part of the ministry is for
[1:14:31] positional placing of the body
[1:14:33] not to say yeah they've got a ministry
[1:14:34] it's these five offices if you're not
[1:14:36] that you're not in the ministry
[1:14:39] the ministry is the display of christ
[1:14:41] amen the display of christ is found when
[1:14:42] the whole camp is working together for
[1:14:44] one purpose
[1:14:45] when every joint supplies it everybody's
[1:14:47] found their place in the body of christ
[1:14:49] how do they do that through the five
[1:14:50] full ministry
[1:14:52] building them up on the word
[1:14:54] establishing in the word
[1:14:55] building them up in the stature of
[1:14:57] christ and so they can get placed amen
[1:14:59] and under adoption placed in a work that
[1:15:01] god can work through them now
[1:15:04] not just through five offices but
[1:15:07] through the whole body
[1:15:09] the five offices are here to help
[1:15:11] everybody get in position
[1:15:14] but the ministry of the bride is the
[1:15:16] ministry of christ
[1:15:17] it's christ working through
[1:15:20] his body let's keep reading
[1:15:27] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:15:29] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:15:31] every wind of doctrine
[1:15:32] by the slight of men in the cunning
[1:15:33] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[1:15:35] deceive
[1:15:36] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[1:15:38] up unto him and all things
[1:15:40] which is the head even christ from whom
[1:15:42] the whole body
[1:15:43] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:15:46] that which every joint supplyeth
[1:15:48] according to the effectual working and
[1:15:50] the measure of every part
[1:15:52] making increase of the body unto the
[1:15:54] edifying of itself
[1:15:55] in love that went far beyond
[1:15:58] five ministry offices that became the
[1:16:02] whole display of jesus christ
[1:16:03] in a whole body where every joint
[1:16:05] supplieth amen
[1:16:07] listen every joint now listen uh i want
[1:16:09] to read this again carefully
[1:16:13] verse 16 from whom the whole body fitly
[1:16:15] joined together
[1:16:16] and compacted amen the body is pressed
[1:16:18] together amen
[1:16:20] this love bond that we're coming to is
[1:16:22] pressing us together
[1:16:23] as one body compacted by which
[1:16:26] every joint supply us according to the
[1:16:29] effectual working
[1:16:30] and the measure of every part that means
[1:16:33] there's something
[1:16:34] given to every part to benefit other
[1:16:36] parts
[1:16:38] the measure of every part making
[1:16:40] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:16:42] of itself
[1:16:44] in love what that means is
[1:16:47] everybody gives what they've got because
[1:16:50] they love god and they love the body
[1:16:53] it was what it was what the queen of
[1:16:55] sheba saw when she sat
[1:16:57] at at solomon's feet and sat in his core
[1:17:00] and sat at his table
[1:17:01] what she saw was this right here
[1:17:05] under the ministry of solomon under the
[1:17:07] ministry of christ
[1:17:08] and bringing them to a golden age what
[1:17:10] was the golden age the golden age was
[1:17:12] the display of christ
[1:17:15] what is our golden age christ in the
[1:17:18] body
[1:17:20] every joint supplyeth to the effectual
[1:17:23] working
[1:17:24] to the edifying of itself in love
[1:17:28] they had brought such peace solomon's
[1:17:31] wisdom
[1:17:31] the word the enlightenment the light
[1:17:33] that was at the top of that pyramid
[1:17:36] brought so much uh peace
[1:17:39] so much understanding that there was a
[1:17:42] bond of love
[1:17:44] and every joint was supplying throughout
[1:17:45] the whole kingdom
[1:17:47] just so the queen of sheba could see and
[1:17:49] however short her stay was
[1:17:51] what she saw was encompassing the entire
[1:17:54] kingdom
[1:17:56] and what she saw left no spirit in her
[1:17:59] at all
[1:18:01] i want to be a people that when people
[1:18:03] come in contact with us and they see how
[1:18:05] we love one another
[1:18:07] they see our families in order the order
[1:18:09] of our worship they see the children and
[1:18:11] the teenagers the moms the dads the
[1:18:13] widows
[1:18:14] the older couples the young couples the
[1:18:15] singles when they see
[1:18:17] they see they see the life i want them
[1:18:19] to come in hear the wisdom i want them
[1:18:21] to hear the wisdom but i want them to
[1:18:22] see the life
[1:18:23] and i want it to have the same effect it
[1:18:24] had on the queen of sheba that there's
[1:18:26] no more spirit or no more resistance i
[1:18:28] can't resist this anymore
[1:18:29] this is god i give over to it
[1:18:33] i empty my camels and i empty my purses
[1:18:35] and i give everything to it because this
[1:18:37] is god
[1:18:42] see it's got to be written epistles
[1:18:45] living word read by all men
[1:18:49] brother branham says in the message an
[1:18:50] adoption to did you
[1:18:52] notice moses the great miracle performer
[1:18:54] that brought down israel
[1:18:56] down through the land and brought them
[1:18:57] up to the promised land but did not
[1:18:59] place their inheritance to them
[1:19:01] he did not give them their inheritance
[1:19:03] he led them
[1:19:04] up to the land but joshua divided the
[1:19:06] land to the people is that right
[1:19:08] and christ brought the church up to the
[1:19:09] place where their possession was made to
[1:19:11] them was given to them
[1:19:13] just the jordan to cross but the holy
[1:19:14] spirit is the one who sets the church in
[1:19:16] order
[1:19:17] joshua today puts the church in its
[1:19:20] order giving to each one
[1:19:21] gifts places positions and he is the
[1:19:23] voice of god speaking to the inner man
[1:19:26] that christ has saved the holy spirit do
[1:19:28] you get that much of it
[1:19:30] now we're getting over in the book of
[1:19:31] ephesians now the same way he
[1:19:33] positionally places the church there
[1:19:35] where they belong now joshua placed him
[1:19:37] in the natural land the holy spirit is
[1:19:39] placing the church positionally
[1:19:40] in the land that they in the possession
[1:19:43] that they belong in their inheritance
[1:19:45] now the first thing he started off here
[1:19:46] he addresses the letter paul
[1:19:49] which we're going to find out after a
[1:19:50] while that all this mystery was revealed
[1:19:52] to him
[1:19:53] not in seminary not in theologian but
[1:19:56] was a divine revelation of the holy
[1:19:57] ghost
[1:19:58] that god gave paul knowing that the
[1:20:00] mystery of god
[1:20:01] he said that had been hid since the
[1:20:03] foundation of the world had been
[1:20:05] revealed to him by the holy spirit
[1:20:07] and the holy spirit amongst the people
[1:20:08] was setting each one in order
[1:20:10] setting the church in position
[1:20:14] is the holy ghost been released in this
[1:20:16] day unbound
[1:20:19] to do what to put the church in position
[1:20:22] do you think he forgot about you
[1:20:26] don't let the devil tell you that don't
[1:20:29] let lies
[1:20:30] hold us back from giving our all
[1:20:33] don't let the deception of the enemy say
[1:20:36] you know i can see this one i can see
[1:20:37] this one but what is there for me to do
[1:20:40] friends that's self-love that's a pity
[1:20:43] party
[1:20:44] you know really what that is is saying
[1:20:47] well well
[1:20:47] this little thing i got is not as
[1:20:49] important as his
[1:20:51] well well yeah i mean of course i've got
[1:20:53] this but
[1:20:54] i'm a witness at work but what's that
[1:20:59] you realize whatever i hand find it to
[1:21:00] do do it with thy might
[1:21:03] do it for the king be a witness at work
[1:21:06] for the king
[1:21:07] be a mother or father be a teenager for
[1:21:09] the king be a student for the king
[1:21:13] do it for the king
[1:21:20] let's go to first corinthians
[1:21:25] first corinthians 14.
[1:21:32] and 26
[1:21:38] how is it brethren when you come
[1:21:40] together every one of you had a psalm
[1:21:42] had a doctrine had a tongue
[1:21:43] how the revelation had an interpretation
[1:21:45] let all things be done
[1:21:47] unto edifying he goes on
[1:21:50] i won't read it all but you can read on
[1:21:52] through the rest of the chapter he goes
[1:21:54] on to explain
[1:21:55] you know if if you don't have a pro if
[1:21:57] you have a tongue with no interpretation
[1:21:59] hold your peace and
[1:22:00] let the prophet speak by two or the most
[1:22:02] by three and let another judge
[1:22:03] do everything decently in order let
[1:22:05] everything be done to edification
[1:22:08] that means don't let anything be done
[1:22:09] for yourself glory don't get up and give
[1:22:11] a show don't
[1:22:12] don't sing so people think you're a good
[1:22:14] singer amen don't
[1:22:15] there's no performance here there's no
[1:22:17] there's no exalting self
[1:22:19] everything we do let it be done for
[1:22:20] edification let it be done to bless the
[1:22:23] bride bless the body bless somebody else
[1:22:24] whether it's seen or not seen
[1:22:26] don't just blurt out in tongues when
[1:22:28] there's no prophet there's no
[1:22:29] interpretation because what's the point
[1:22:30] of that
[1:22:31] only to prove that you can speak in
[1:22:32] tongues
[1:22:34] but let everything be done for the
[1:22:36] edification of others not the
[1:22:37] glorification of self
[1:22:42] brother brahma says the influence of
[1:22:45] another and the message the influence of
[1:22:46] another
[1:22:48] from 1963 says when you're playing a
[1:22:50] ball game as is the football
[1:22:52] season the thing we want to do is not
[1:22:53] everybody try to take the ball away from
[1:22:55] the man that's got
[1:22:56] it he is trying to guard that man
[1:22:58] protect him let him get through
[1:23:00] we are trying to make a goal see but
[1:23:02] could you imagine a team
[1:23:03] so untrained as to find one man their
[1:23:05] own man with that ball running to the
[1:23:07] field goal
[1:23:07] and then instead of trying to knock the
[1:23:09] enemy away from him the opposing team
[1:23:11] to let your own man that's got the ball
[1:23:13] take off with it and every man trying to
[1:23:15] take the ball out of his hand
[1:23:16] while you're bound to lose of course
[1:23:21] and today we have the same thing when we
[1:23:23] see god come on the scene and
[1:23:24] going to bless a certain thing let's
[1:23:26] keep all the enemies away from it let's
[1:23:28] use our influence as tackles not runners
[1:23:31] tackles that protects the runner let's
[1:23:33] impact the ball through
[1:23:35] because there's no opposition all he has
[1:23:37] to do is just keep running and we should
[1:23:39] be tackles
[1:23:41] amen those aren't the ones that get
[1:23:43] interviewed at the end of the game
[1:23:46] they're not the ones who get heisman
[1:23:47] trophies
[1:23:49] they're not the ones in the limelight
[1:23:50] they're not the ones wearing
[1:23:52] everybody's wearing their jersey and got
[1:23:54] their number and their name on their
[1:23:55] back what is that oh that's the right
[1:24:00] guard what do you do without him
[1:24:04] see brother branham's telling us amen
[1:24:06] support one another amen support their
[1:24:09] gift
[1:24:09] encourage it pray for them stand in the
[1:24:12] way of the enemy
[1:24:12] don't always try to one-up or out do or
[1:24:15] or
[1:24:16] pull somebody down or take the ball from
[1:24:18] them let's support one another amen
[1:24:20] let's block for one another let's take
[1:24:23] amen
[1:24:23] a position that nobody will know about
[1:24:25] and let's get on our knees and pray for
[1:24:27] the one running with the ball
[1:24:29] let's pray for those that are gifted
[1:24:31] among us who write songs who sing who
[1:24:33] preach
[1:24:33] who do the things amen just let's let's
[1:24:36] be a tackle let's be a guard
[1:24:38] amen nobody will wear my jersey nobody
[1:24:40] will give me a heisman trophy nobody
[1:24:41] will get my playing card
[1:24:46] but god knows what i did god knows and i
[1:24:49] did it because i loved god not to have
[1:24:51] my card
[1:24:52] and meant condition worth 47 in 50 years
[1:24:57] not to get in the hall of fame and not
[1:24:58] to get a heisman trophy but i did it
[1:25:00] because i love the lord
[1:25:01] and i see his anointed packing the ball
[1:25:03] and i'm willing to get on my knees and
[1:25:05] block every devil from that brother
[1:25:07] from that sister amen from that
[1:25:10] individual
[1:25:12] why because there's a greater than
[1:25:14] solomon here friends
[1:25:17] philippians chapter 2.
[1:25:23] i'm just going to read two more passages
[1:25:25] of scriptures
[1:25:29] you know on wednesday nights i keep
[1:25:30] coming with less and less notes
[1:25:32] because i'm trying not to hold everybody
[1:25:34] too long and i'm preaching longer with
[1:25:36] less notes
[1:25:38] i need to come with more notes
[1:25:41] i can't even find philippians
[1:25:45] all right ephesians philippians
[1:25:48] all right philippians chapter 2 verse 1.
[1:25:52] if there if there be therefore any
[1:25:55] consolation of christ
[1:25:56] if any comfort of love if any fellowship
[1:25:58] of the spirit if any bowels
[1:26:00] and mercies fulfill you my joy that you
[1:26:02] be like-minded having the same love
[1:26:05] being of one accord and of one mind let
[1:26:07] nothing be
[1:26:08] done through strife or vainglory but in
[1:26:11] lowliness of mind let each esteem
[1:26:13] other better than themselves look not
[1:26:15] every man on his own
[1:26:17] on things but every man also on the
[1:26:19] things
[1:26:20] of others this is what we need in the
[1:26:23] body of christ
[1:26:25] go back to first corinthians 3 and we'll
[1:26:27] just finish with this tonight
[1:26:34] first corinthians 3
[1:26:38] and 1. and brethren
[1:26:43] i brethren could not speak unto you as
[1:26:45] in the spiritual
[1:26:46] but as in the carnal even as in the
[1:26:47] babes in christ
[1:26:49] i have fed you with milk and not with
[1:26:51] meat for hitherto you were not able to
[1:26:53] bear it
[1:26:53] neither yet now are you able for ye are
[1:26:56] yet
[1:26:56] carnal for whereas there is among you
[1:26:58] envying and strife and divisions
[1:27:00] are you not carnal and walk as men let's
[1:27:03] stop right there
[1:27:04] clear indication of our spiritual
[1:27:06] condition
[1:27:09] if there are if there are
[1:27:12] endings strife and divisions
[1:27:15] you are carnal and walk as men
[1:27:20] those things should never be among us
[1:27:22] why are greater than solomon is here
[1:27:26] where am i at spiritually carnal
[1:27:29] as a man not as a son and daughter of
[1:27:33] god
[1:27:33] because if there's endings strife and
[1:27:36] divisions
[1:27:37] it's not right verse 4 for a while
[1:27:41] one saith i am of paul another i am of
[1:27:43] apollos are you not carnal who then is
[1:27:46] paul
[1:27:47] and who was apollos but ministers by
[1:27:49] whom you believed even as the lord gave
[1:27:51] to every man
[1:27:52] i think he's telling you don't align
[1:27:55] yourself with preachers
[1:27:59] that doesn't mean you're not supposed to
[1:28:00] love your pastor
[1:28:02] you're supposed to love your pastor but
[1:28:05] we don't divide ourselves by preachers
[1:28:08] i'm of paul i'm of apollos i believe
[1:28:11] this way i believe that way
[1:28:15] forget it verse six
[1:28:18] i have planted apollos watered but god
[1:28:20] gave the increase
[1:28:22] so neither so then neither is he that
[1:28:24] planteth anything neither he that
[1:28:26] watereth but god that giveth the
[1:28:28] increase
[1:28:29] now he that planteth and he that
[1:28:30] watereth are one and every man shall
[1:28:33] receive his own reward
[1:28:35] according to his own labor for we are
[1:28:37] laborers together with god
[1:28:39] ye are god's husbandry you're god's
[1:28:41] vineyard you're god's field you're god's
[1:28:43] farm
[1:28:44] you're god's garden
[1:28:47] ye are god's building what is paul
[1:28:51] what is apollos just somebody who's
[1:28:53] laboring in god's vineyard
[1:28:55] paul labored apollos labored john
[1:28:58] labored
[1:28:59] peter labored they all labored amen
[1:29:01] they'll all receive their reward but not
[1:29:03] for us to say
[1:29:04] well i'm with paul i'm with apollos
[1:29:07] you're carnal
[1:29:08] divisions envying strife you're carnal
[1:29:11] you're mesmen you're not acting right
[1:29:14] i say god spare us from that but let us
[1:29:18] have a higher vision let us all pull our
[1:29:20] resources together
[1:29:21] let's not divide by camps or by churches
[1:29:23] or by ministries or by
[1:29:25] certain preachers or certain ways of
[1:29:27] thinking but let us all pull together
[1:29:28] and say
[1:29:29] i'm here to give whatever i got whatever
[1:29:32] little bit i got is going to be the very
[1:29:33] best that i can contribute
[1:29:35] amen because there's a greater than
[1:29:36] solomon here
[1:29:38] do you believe there's a greater than
[1:29:40] solomon here then i believe
[1:29:42] that there should be a display greater
[1:29:43] than the display that the queen of sheba
[1:29:45] saw
[1:29:47] every home every life every individual
[1:29:50] young old amen is a contributor in the
[1:29:53] body of christ
[1:29:54] and everybody should be doing whatever
[1:29:56] god has given them to do
[1:29:58] if the only thing you can do is pray
[1:30:00] brother branham said that's the most
[1:30:01] powerful weapon
[1:30:02] ever given to man you say all i can do
[1:30:05] is pray
[1:30:06] are you diminishing prayer by that
[1:30:08] statement are you saying
[1:30:10] well all i can do is pray all you can do
[1:30:12] is pray there's not a better thing you
[1:30:14] can do than pray
[1:30:18] praise god only one carries the ball at
[1:30:21] a time
[1:30:23] but everybody else can block support
[1:30:27] encourage cheer alone
[1:30:31] there's a greater than solomon here
[1:30:34] and i believe there's still gentile
[1:30:36] queens out there
[1:30:38] that are willing to travel to this light
[1:30:42] now hear the fame of the wisdom of the
[1:30:44] message of the hour
[1:30:46] the answer to the questions
[1:30:48] denominations can't answer
[1:30:51] why are we here how did we get here why
[1:30:54] a virgin birth
[1:30:55] why a blood sacrifice why human
[1:30:57] sacrifice why
[1:30:58] why judgment what happened to noah's day
[1:31:00] why are they finding dinosaur
[1:31:02] fossils
[1:31:05] a greater than solomon is here
[1:31:09] i say god bring to us a greater
[1:31:12] manifestation
[1:31:14] of a unity of a body than what the queen
[1:31:16] of sheba saw
[1:31:18] bring to us a greater desire to do our
[1:31:20] little part
[1:31:22] if if i'm a prince if i'm an overseer if
[1:31:25] i'm a recorder if i'm a treasure
[1:31:26] if i'm an attendant if i'm a farmer
[1:31:29] whatever
[1:31:30] it is for me to do if i'm a cupbearer
[1:31:32] amen the queen saw the cupbearer
[1:31:34] and saw how the cupbearer was dressed
[1:31:38] if all i can do is dress right
[1:31:42] i'm going to do it for the king if i'm
[1:31:45] going to put on my apparel
[1:31:46] amen and my apparel is going to catch
[1:31:48] the attention of the queen of sheba
[1:31:49] i'm going to put on my apparel for the
[1:31:51] king to glorify
[1:31:53] his kingdom not myself when he looked at
[1:31:56] the
[1:31:57] the the ministers and their apparel and
[1:32:00] then they put on apparel for the king
[1:32:01] they didn't put apparel for the self
[1:32:03] because when she saw their apparel she
[1:32:04] honored the king
[1:32:09] everything we do matters
[1:32:12] let's all pull together and say i don't
[1:32:16] care
[1:32:16] if it's paul or apollos
[1:32:19] really i don't care what i want is that
[1:32:23] greater than solomon to be on it
[1:32:26] to be lifted up to be exalted for his
[1:32:29] light to shine
[1:32:31] when we attract people to his light when
[1:32:33] they come to his light
[1:32:34] may they look around and see the life
[1:32:36] that that light produces
[1:32:39] in our homes and our in our individuals
[1:32:42] in our youth and when they look around
[1:32:46] they said
[1:32:46] i was amazed at what i heard but i'm
[1:32:49] just as amazed at what i see
[1:32:53] you know how confusing it is to say we
[1:32:55] have the light of the hour
[1:32:56] and not the audacity to cover our flesh
[1:33:03] to dress decent to to talk the way the
[1:33:06] prophet told us to talk to dress the way
[1:33:07] he told us to dress
[1:33:08] to stay away from worldly entertainment
[1:33:10] the way he told us to stay away from
[1:33:12] early entertainment
[1:33:13] you know what conflict you bring in
[1:33:15] people's hearts and minds
[1:33:17] amen when you show such wonderful wisdom
[1:33:19] of a greater than solomon
[1:33:20] but the life around the kingdom
[1:33:25] doesn't line up i say god line me up
[1:33:29] line me up amen if i'm a farmer amen if
[1:33:32] i'm an attendant if i'm a seamstress and
[1:33:34] i'm from engraver
[1:33:35] i'm engraving for the king i'm sowing
[1:33:37] for the king i'm raising children for
[1:33:39] the king i'm working my little farm
[1:33:41] on the back side of the kingdom for the
[1:33:43] king
[1:33:45] i'm giving the best i got because the
[1:33:48] queen of sheba saw
[1:33:49] more than just the wisdom of solomon
[1:33:53] she saw the life of israel
[1:33:56] let's all stand musicians if you come
[1:34:03] praise be to god greater than solomon
[1:34:06] is here
[1:34:09] and there's a kingdom on earth a body of
[1:34:13] christ
[1:34:14] on earth it's a many-membered body
[1:34:18] and you and i are part of that body
[1:34:22] i've heard statements i've even thought
[1:34:24] these thoughts before myself
[1:34:26] well if i was in their position i would
[1:34:28] know what to do i could really do
[1:34:30] something for the lord
[1:34:34] that's a joab thought
[1:34:37] that's a shimmy-eyed thought but i want
[1:34:41] to have a banaya thought
[1:34:43] i want to have a brazilian thought i
[1:34:46] brought you substance because i love you
[1:34:49] i brought you goods not to sit at your
[1:34:50] table when you were at your lowest when
[1:34:53] you couldn't give me anything back
[1:34:55] when it looked like you probably could
[1:34:56] lose your kingdom i still knew you were
[1:34:58] anointed the king i served you because i
[1:34:59] love
[1:35:00] god's word and i love god's anointing
[1:35:02] not to get anything back
[1:35:04] mania joined when david was nothing and
[1:35:07] when david became something he didn't
[1:35:09] grab a position like job he didn't try
[1:35:11] to exalt himself
[1:35:12] he didn't push to get anything what he
[1:35:14] did was serve the king faithfully just
[1:35:16] like he did when he was in a cave
[1:35:20] and god told him you're now you're now
[1:35:22] captain of the host
[1:35:25] i want to serve whether it's in the
[1:35:27] backside of a cave
[1:35:28] whether it's in the backside of the
[1:35:30] desert i want to give him everything
[1:35:32] and whatever else he wants me to do
[1:35:34] he'll give me to do
[1:35:36] i don't want to sit around waiting well
[1:35:37] if i had a bigger farm
[1:35:39] i would give sheep to the king if i've
[1:35:41] got two he can have one
[1:35:44] give give where we're at give what we've
[1:35:47] got give with all of our hearts
[1:35:49] serve the king in our daily life don't
[1:35:51] look for something else to do daily life
[1:35:53] serve the king and our prayer time with
[1:35:56] our family devotions with our children
[1:35:58] encouragement to our wife love and
[1:36:00] support of a husband
[1:36:01] serve the king that way
[1:36:04] and if we're faithful in the least he
[1:36:07] can give us more
[1:36:10] let's all pray lord jesus we thank you
[1:36:13] god
[1:36:15] we thank you lord that you've made it so
[1:36:16] simple
[1:36:19] you made it so simple in showing us what
[1:36:21] the queen of sheba saw
[1:36:24] what she saw was the work of an entire
[1:36:28] nation
[1:36:29] come together to support a king
[1:36:33] god may your whole nation of your bride
[1:36:35] your people on the earth
[1:36:37] your body and flesh may they all work
[1:36:39] together to support your kingdom
[1:36:42] to have you high and lifted up may we
[1:36:44] represent the kingdom well
[1:36:47] nor may we be a representation of your
[1:36:49] wisdom and your light
[1:36:51] in our daily tasks at home in our
[1:36:54] workplaces in our schools
[1:36:57] in church and out of church with
[1:36:59] believers and not with believers
[1:37:03] may we always lord reflect this kingdom
[1:37:05] we're part of and may we always
[1:37:07] give every joint supply every joint
[1:37:11] every joint supplies with that portion
[1:37:14] that they have
[1:37:15] for every man has been given a portion
[1:37:17] of faith
[1:37:19] let us give back lord to the body what
[1:37:21] you've given to us whether it's small or
[1:37:23] great whether we think it's big or small

[1:37:57] be smitten may she lose her breath lord
[1:37:59] and give all to you

[1:38:03] life in your children
[1:38:05] i heard the word i was amazed but when i
[1:38:07] saw the life
