========================================

[Music] praise the lord amen he's good and he's worthy to be praised and let's take our bibles and turn to the book of acts while we're standing and while we do that i have a very special announcement to make there's been a new baby surprisingly born into the congregation come early but brother jarria and sister becca had a baby this morning 1 17 this morning they had little samantha danielle wholesale praise god the doctors were trying to make her wait push it off try to stop labor and i text brother jeriah late last night i said god knows when this baby's supposed to be born and he knows more than the doctors so the doctors couldn't stop it any longer and now she's here so god bless you and be praying for them and we hope to see them soon but that's exciting friends amen there's always surprises always good surprises also uh today's another special day for the bondo family because young blandine bondo would like to be baptized at the end of service this morning while the my brother aaron was preaching last sunday god began to prick her heart god began to call and she knew god was calling her and she was able to respond and now she'd like for the world to know that she's accepted the lord's invitation to her so what a good day what a good day to be here what a good day to be alive serving the lord amen what a good time to be his bride world's falling apart but something inside of us keeps climbing higher and higher and higher by the grace of god and then before we read i had one more announcement i've got a special announcement a party that we want to have for brother tom davis but tom doesn't know it i'm surprising him now this is the first he's hearing about it but i've been working conspiring with his wife behind the scenes and with the trustees but brother tom you know the lord has has used him as a song leader in the assembly for a long long time and even before this assembly was a song leader he's been leading songs over 50 years and god finally told him it was time to stop and brother thomas decided to retire just a couple months ago after he was really sick and we've been waiting for things to get better get easier so we could do something for brother tom so we decided to go ahead and do something out in the pavilion uh sunday september 13th we'll come back about four o'clock we'll gather there we'll have coffee we'll have cake and we want to have a very very special time a celebration for brother tom davis for all that he's done for us so i want to encourage you to come to that if you're able to make plans um we're gonna we're gonna have different ones speak we're gonna say a few things and if you'd like to bring a card or even a gift a token of thanks to give to brother tom at that at that time we would like to just just thank him from the bottom of our hearts for all he's done for us so god bless you brother tommy we love you i'm going to say thank you let's give him a hand so i hope you'll forgive me for springing that on me but i asked your wife first i had permission amen so let's let's make sure we remember that we'll put something on the overhead to remind everybody but i just want to i you know things happen so fast in our life you move from one event to the next and things change and i don't want to take i don't want to forget to take time to stop and think about what god's done and thank god for what he's done these are special things and the life of service that brother tom and sister barb have lived for this assembly are worthy of a big thank you and i don't want to just let time twitter away and forget these things that are important and we want to do that so thank god for that opportunity let's look at acts chapter 15. we'll read one verse and we'll let you be seated the book of acts chapter 15 in verse 18 known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world amen what a statement that's such a simple verse something we already know but i think it's going to take us the rest of our lives to fully encapsulate the understanding of what that actually means but known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world that means god is not now trying to decide what he should do next he knows what he's going to do next he's not waiting for circumstances to unfold and watch the way they unfold and then choose what he'll do after that before the world began he knew what he would do his works are known to him from before the foundation of the world amen so nothing is going to disrupt that plan amen and we are that plan we're part of that plan let's bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing over the word dear lord jesus we thank you father for this wonderful word that you've given us today we thank you god for the opportunity to gather like this to just praise your name to worship you lord with the freedom that you've given us freedom from bondage freedom from denominational understanding freedom from confusion lord but you've lifted us out of that lord to understand whom we worship and who we are and god with a joyful heart we just want to give you praise and lord we come to this part of the service where we we come to feed from your hand lord we're asking you to break the bread of life to us that we might feed from you our great shepherd and you might give us what we need for the journey and that all that we do with the strength we gain today would be pleasing unto you lord we thank you for this little baby that you've given to brother dry and sister rebecca we thank you for life for life is a precious thing lord we ask that you'd bless the recovery help them to get home the family to come back together quickly and help everything to go well bless bless us today your children lord as we feed from you in jesus name we pray amen you can each be seated i'm i want to talk about this morning the subject of placed suns placed suns not just suns but placed suns we're going to begin talking a little bit about adoption and this is actually a giant subject it's huge i've been looking at it for some time and and just by my nature i tend to like to have everything nailed down you know really tight before i begin to move forward and i've been looking at this adoption for some time and i've been thinking you know before i begin preaching that there's five books i don't know why there's five books i want to read right in a row and so i'm starting reading those and and i thought you know what i'm just gonna start preaching as god leads he'll put all the pieces together for us as we go and so i'm excited to see where god takes us in this and there's there's many different facets to that and so hopefully we just broach the subject today and see where god will lead us but for me the the foundation is what we started with in the scripture the foundation for everything is known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world god knows what's going to happen he knows what's going what's going to transpire he has a plan of action and he's working his plan and if we are part of god we are part of his plan nothing is happening out of kilter with us everything is ticking right on time god knows what it is we're going to do god knows what it is he wants for us to accomplish amen some of these things may be great mysteries to us and we may we may battle over it in our mind and we may talk about or or ponder over what would the lord want me to do what is my position in the church amen what is my position in the body those are things that we might ponder or wonder our muse over in ourselves but the fact is god already knows he already knows he's already determined it amen all we need to do is rest and walk into the plan that he has for us in the adoption series in the first message he preached an adoption in 1960 he says the bible teaching is usually a little treacherous a little you know kind of walking out on thin ice we call it and this is a statement that many have used to caution against teaching but i want to read the rest of the quote the bible teaching usually a little treacherous a little you know kind of walking out on thin ice we call it but we just feel that maybe at this point and at this time it might be good to kind of bring the church to what i think to a complete understanding positionally of what we are in christ jesus and sometimes they think that preaching is a wonderful thing but i believe sometimes brother beeler that teaching goes beyond that economy especially to the church now preaching usually catches the sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places a man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are doing so if you just take brother behind statement teaching is a little bit treacherous getting out on thin ice and you can say well you know be careful we don't want too much teaching and but you can never have faith until you positionally know what you are and you can't know that without teaching amen so so don't be afraid of teaching the teaching is a posi the teaching is intended to bring a positional placing and that positional placing will bring the right kind of faith amen and we always need preaching we always need evangelism we always need teaching we always need all of these all these guests saying this and no why diminishes any other gift because we still need amen we still need conviction sometimes we still need somebody to preach in such a way that'll shake us out of lethargy or awaken us to a a you know to to a condition in our lives that we're allowing we still need to glean what's in the field we still need our children to come to the lord we still need the visitors amen we still need those among us that haven't had that experience to come to that experience but when we come to that experience with the lord amen and in the body of christ then we need to come under teaching which will give us understanding and that understanding will place us positionally in christ which will give us the right kind of faith so so don't ever be afraid if anybody ever uses that quote like that say yeah it's treacherous but you can't have the right kind of faith without it it stretches but you'll never come into position without it amen because it was the teaching of the word that brought us into our position let's go to the book of ephesians together and look at ephesians chapter one ephesians chapter 1 verse 3. see the one of the reasons i want to go into this is just the way the lord's been leading of course but also god didn't save us to have a trophy god didn't save us i mean just for an accomplishment he didn't put us on this earth he didn't call us to himself he didn't awaken us to the reality of the message just you know to check off an accomplishment box or for us to have a merit badge or a certificate or an award but it all is for a purpose amen everything that god's doing is for a purpose amen he put us here in this age for a purpose he called us at a specific time for a purpose we had an ability of faith within us to respond at a certain given time it may not have been the first time you heard preaching it may not have been amen you might have been raised in the truth and you know so much of it was going over your head for so long but there was an appointed time and at a point in time it meant something quickened on the inside and you had an ability to receive amen what was being preached god god put you here for that time god called you in that time you responded in your time amen because god has a purpose in doing it not just saying i did it but there's something else he wants to accomplish in your calling amen and calling you to himself in your being here on earth with the faith to believe amen that's just the starting point but he wants to now finish his his work and he in order to finish his work upon this earth he's got to have a body to work through and that body is the members of the body of christ that's on earth at this time to finish the work that christ did not finish in his first earthly ministry so we have to be positionally placed we have to know what we are we have to be taught these things so that we can begin to move amen and the things god called us to move in with confidence all right ephesians 1 verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ jesus according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love so god has already predetermined he's already predetermined uh what we're going to be he has already chosen us in christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love that is god's desire not ours god chose us in him so that we could be holy and without blame before him in love god wants us blameless it doesn't matter how much we want to be blameless it was god's design god chose us in christ christ would die for us because he wanted us holy and without blame before him in love it was all his purpose amen no matter how many tears that you shed in repentance and how what a longing that you had amen to come to the lord no matter how strong that was in you it was only a reflection of the strong desire god had before god had the desire first and god had the desire stronger and it was reflected back in us in in our desire to be one with him verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according according to the pleasure of his the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved so in this in this passage there's nothing yet that we've done there's nothing yet that he's asked us to do there's nothing yet that was required for us to have this grace and have this love and to be blameless before him in love and it was all by his will by his desire amen to glorify his grace it's all for him it's all what he chose to do but but verse 5 he said having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will i want to look at that word adoption of children because if you go through the strongest concordance and you go to adoption of children it's very much what brother branham's already taught us and explained to us but i just want to take some time with him in this in this word adoption of children that's one word in the greek that they've made adoption of children as the translation and when you go into the uh uh the concordance it says from a presumed compound of word number 5207 and a derivative of 5087. so basically what they're saying is that's a compound of these two words put together is what this word now is and this word is translated adoption adoption of children adoption of sons that's how it's translated but if we go look at those other two words that this word is a compound of the first one just means sun or offspring it just is a sun but the second one means to lay put make a point it means to set to put to place so now when we look at adoption of sons adoption of sons is not you know like we understand adoption to be and brother branham explain this thoroughly it's not like you know when we see a poor little child that doesn't have a home and needs a home and we're moved in our heart and we want to adopt that child into our family that's what we understand in our english term of adoption that's what we understand adoption but that's not what this word adoption means adoption is you already have a son this is already a sun to begin with it's not becoming a son it is a son it is an offspring it is the one from the father but that one has to now be set or put or placed so we've been ordained we've been predestinated to the adoption of children by jesus christ we weren't just we weren't just predestinated to be picked up out of the marty clay and saved and set on a shelf but we were predestinated to be picked up amen to be washed off but to be put in service to be filled and to be used by god so when we look at our predestination our predestination is not he just he knew i was going to be lost and he made a way that i wouldn't be lost it was more than that friends it wasn't just to not be lost but it was now to become the vessel that he's going to use he's going to put you in position put you in place as a son not take you from non-sun to sun you were not acting like a son but you were always were a son amen you may not have been acting like a wheat but down inside of you was wheat life amen but you were acting and displaying cockleburn but if there was no wheat life in there there was nothing no life to quicken there had to be a you had to be a son or daughter of god to begin with or else you'll never come to any position or any placing so he's taking a son this adoption of children is taking a son that's already a son and putting it into a position or putting it into a place those are things common in the message we understand that amen but i want to take my time and just look at that so we understand why brother benham said what he said and what the scriptures are saying and what these words mean so so i must in order to fulfill my purpose in this life i must move beyond just the joy and satisfaction that i've been chosen because that's a wonderful thing that's a wonderful revelation and realization that before the foundation the word he chose me that i was wayward i was lost i was undone i had spiritual amnesia i was going the wrong direction but he came and interrupted my plan with his plan and he opened my eyes so that i could see that i'm a son amen in in in any uh and he baptized me with the holy ghost gave me a new birth experience to recognize that the seed has come to life that's a wonderful thing but we can't stop there because we've been predestinated unto the placing of sons in jesus christ so there's more there's more than just that realization there's the actual work that he's called us to do if we look at galatians let's go to galatians chapter 4. in verse 1 now i say that the heir as long as he is a child different nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but as under tutors and governors until the time appointed to the father even so when we were children we were in bondage other than the elements of the world so even when we were in bondage under the elements of the world you were still a child of god we were just stuck in that condition but we were still a child of god amen but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons now this adoption of sons is the same exact term that we just went through and because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart crying abba father so what is the spirit i mean what is the what is the spirit of his son it's the holy ghost why does the holy ghost come because you're a son because you're a son he sent the spirit of his son into your heart to where you could cry abba father amen why why did that happen because you were already a son wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son than an heir of god through christ so he he's actually even showing amen through the old testament that that the children of israel were called servants they meant they were being brought up under the tutors of the law amen but god's desire amen was to positionally placed them in christ and when christ come they rejected christ amen and now they never they never got placed in christ jesus but now that opportunity has come for the bride amen so now we were we were under the elements of the world we were lost in darkness but we were sons and because we were sons he sent unto us the spirit of his son you realize he didn't uh if i could just take my time and explain it the best way that i know how it wasn't my agonizing for hours that brought the spirit of the sun now i may have had the experience of agonizing because i needed to go through that in repentance you understand that but it wasn't that i had finally earned something from god because i had finally proved to him that i was a son because i'm really laboring here in prayer and god looked down on me with mercy and said oh he's really laboring in prayer i'll go ahead and give him the holy ghost no because you were sons he sent the spirit of his son to where you can cry abba father my father so we go through the travailing for us those are necessary things the weeping and the travailing and the repenting are necessary for us amen to mourn over our sins to mourn over our conditions amen but it's not it's not the length or the amount of agony or the intensity by which we agonize that moves god amen to fill us with the spirit he's already moved before the foundation of the world because we're sons and if you're a son he sends the spirit of his son into your heart where you cry abba father so there is no earning this this is something that's given to sons now that's a know why uh taking away from the agony of repentance because brother branham he even said i doubt a dry eyed confession why because when we come to the realization and impact of this it should have impact in our lives there should be a real repentance and a real sorrow for sin and a real crying out to god and a real desperation to be saved those things should be there but we don't want to get the wrong idea of what's happening there's always our perspective in god's perspective we want to keep these things right in our minds that's why we come to teaching so that we can have the right kind of faith you know if we don't come without teaching if we don't ever slow down and just go through what brother branham went through then we can get into these cycles of you know uh i must not have prayed long enough or i must not have repented enough and i and you might think that's nonsense but i hear it all the time and then people are you know i i just don't know that i i completely repented of everything i want to go back through the whole process again i want to go back through the process again and then those are the that's the way we live life in the pentecostal denomination we were always going through the process again and every time we failed god and every time we let down the word we went back and questioned our sonship and we had to go back and reestablish our sonship amen and then start from zero again you know and that see see without the right kind of teaching and then if we just give just repentance preaching amen then you get people who are born again repenting and trying to get born again again and how do you get born again again all right and those who are already born again they may have to come back to repentance because there's a place in the word that they've let down the bar and they may have to they have to on may have to uh repent and repent of that and be sorrowful for and ask god to forgive them for and wash that out but that's not getting born again again once that seed comes to life it comes to life once it's quickened by the spirit it's quickened by the spirit how are you going to quicken it by the spirit again once it's quickened by the spirit of god how is it going to die how is it going to go back into a dormant state you see that we have to understand that i've come to the realization of who i am by the grace of god he's given me a revelation and he's given me a faith to believe that didn't come from my labors it didn't come from my hours in prayer it didn't come from my own effort or my own love it was his love in my heart projecting back to him what was already there and if i've come to that then i realized i'm a son i'm a son i'm a daughter of god amen if i fail god i'm still a son or daughter of god that failed god i've still been birthed amen i still been birthed by the spirit of god amen by the baptism of the holy ghost and i'm not going to go back amen and take that away and readdress that again i'm just going to say god i'm your son amen you've birthed me into into your body but i failed you and i'm repenting for my failure but i'm not doubting my sonship you see if we you know we're going to fail i mean if you haven't failed this week then my goodness i want to spend some time with you and learn what you've got and i want it to rub off on me we're going to fail but without the right understanding the right teaching every time we fail we go back to square one and start over again then we never move away from milk we never get into me we never go into positional placing we never get to where we're useful for the body because we never have confidence in who we are always doubting always wondering want to get baptized again want to go to the altar again want to pray through again but god god wants more than just you to recognize you're a son he wants you to get in a position a work that he had before the foundation in the world something that needs to be accomplished in this day and only you you're the only vessel that can do it there's no other vessel that's ordained you're not here by a waste of flesh you're not here by an accident you're not here by the passions of mom and dad if you're a son or daughter of god you're here for a specific reason for a specific purpose for a specific work in this time that you're in and as long as we keep going around the doubt and confusion of whether i'm born again or not then we never get to a place where we're useful for the kingdom of god we're always wondering we're always doubting we're always i say god this is this is the time for action this is the time for manifestation this is time for the life of christ on displaying the bride this isn't time for the bride to be beat over with a denominational stick and be getting knocked down to the ground again because she's not good enough she must not be saved i'm saved by the grace of god i'm a child of god by forward nation amen by predestination amen i i can't help it that's who i am i may not be doing a good job at it but that's who i still am i may be failing but i still who i am how do you know brother jeff by faith i know it i know he's awakened something in me that i didn't awaken there's something there that recognizes that who he is and i can't help it i just see it so i may not be doing a very good job i mean my report card might be embarrassing but i can't change who i am and if i realize if i can get positionally placed in what i am in christ amen then i can move past all the doubts and fears of whether i'm a child or not and finally start walking in the calling wherewith he's called me the purpose that he has for my life now in adoption the same message we just read a quote before we want to read here but in genesis 2 when he made man he said i am i am jehovah yahweh jehovah what did he mean i am the all-existing one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine oh glory now i want to i want to pay attention to this i'm going to read through it again slowly but i want to back up for a minute and i want to make a qualifying statement when i make statements like i'm making today about teaching and placing and being born again i'm in no way diminishing the role of an evangelist i hope you understand me or even of a camp meeting for use i'm not diminishing that or taking away from that those things have their place and they're necessary because until you come under the conviction of the holy ghost and repent you're never going to move forward in the plan of god and also i understand too beyond any shadow of a doubt that not every gift is placed into one manner one ministry or one group of people there's specialists out there who specialize in things and no no pastor has it all and there's times that you just need an evangelist to come through because because there's kids who are born here who need to come up and come under the conviction the power of the holy ghost and they need they need to realize i'm lost and need to be saved and you know if that if that's if that's just not the way god's wired us and not each person has that gift then we have to bring those gifts through you understand that and there's nothing against it we work in harmony with one another there still needs to be a camp amen that's going to preach to children who have grown up in a message and never realized they're lost somebody needs to tell them unless you've had an experience of change you're lost and need to be saved cry out unto the lord so we don't ever want to get just because just because we'll just bring it right home just because in this church we have a certain style of ministry because of who the pastor is i can't change that i can't help that but if we ever if we ever make that the measuring stick and anything outside of that is wrong we've missed the whole plan of god we've got to be very very careful that we never just get one leaning one way because we're going to get out of balance very quickly and realize we're off in the weeds because we've refused other ministries that we have need of [Applause] amen even even old-timers believe the word serving god with all their hearts every once in a while they need to be handled a little bit roughly and be sheared and we can't expect one minister to do it all you know he does the convicting he does the shearing he does the teaching he does the family stuff we got to have it all you know it's like when brother aaron came through sunday brother aaron i mean he at the end the spirit dropped in a way he brought a call to action stand up if you want to do this and we had people responding and i said praise god that's what we need we need to work together we need to have these things amen one plants one waters god gets the increase that's why every ministry in this church doesn't have to be a replica of the pastors what's the point if every ministry of all our ministering brothers is a replica of the pastor and please don't ever feel that kind of pressure to be a replica i am what i am by the grace of god i can no more help it than you can help it i've tried to change style of preaching before and didn't work so good for me because i like i hear stuff and i like it you know i hear other preachers i'm like i like the way he preaches it doesn't work for me i think i told you my testimony when brother diggs the first time brother diggs was preaching i mean he used the whole platform the whole floor everything and i had just started preaching i mean i had maybe preached a couple times and i'd gotten to the i'd come up and i don't think i've ever went from this corner to this corner outside of that and he's over here hammering on top of this post and and he's running all over the floor and i liked it i liked that freedom i liked that life i liked that so i i told myself next time i preach i'm going to go over and touch that post i'm going to do it right now just to prove i can and i come to the next service and priest and i never moved from this corner to that corner you can't help what you are don't try to change don't try to mimic don't try to copy and certainly don't put down something that's different i mean of course if we had evangelism every sunday and every wednesday we would be off balance in another way but you can get off the road on the right and left side as much as you can on the right side so we got to make sure that we we accept the gifts we accept what god has said amen when somebody comes in and preaches a fiery sermon and really gets down in our business amen we say thank god i needed that today when somebody comes and starts to to preach a higher level of revelation from a word we've never seen before and begins to break it down and tie it together from genesis to revelation when he's saying thank god that's what i needed today and get away from saying well i wish we had this i wish we had that just take what god gives and let it mold our character and mold us into what he wants us to be so we have to know who we are i mean it's great when we finally see mature christians when they get to a place where they can relax in who they are don't have to pretend don't have to put on don't apologize for the way they are don't have to apologize for the way they minister we don't have to apologize for the way that god has made them the way they handle the word the way they talk about the word the way they handle situations but we all need each other everybody needs everybody everybody in the body needs every other part of the body and so we don't we don't ever want to get in the wrong frame of mind so when i make these statements i you you guys know me you know my heart but i want to share and be clear we're not diminishing anything else or any other style and and i've heard comments before you know they'll talk about another pastor with that pastor he's really not a pastor he's really an evangelist don't you ever say that don't you ever ever ever ever ever say that if god put him there then he is exactly what those people there need now that that may not work for you god didn't put you there so you can look at that and say well i don't think i could sit under that ministry well god didn't put you under that ministry so be happy but don't tear somebody down just because you couldn't sit under that ministry amen that's god's ministry to god's sheep and he designed one to match the other they're complementary the congregation and the pastor are complementary to one another let it be just be thankful god's put you where he's put you but but don't ever say he's really advanced he's not don't say that if god made him a pastor he's a pastor if he's in the wrong position let god move him that's don't you determine what he is and is not praise god i won't plan on saying that but i'm glad i did we just have to love one another and let god be in charge let god be gone now i want to get into this adoption back to this quote it says but in genesis 2 he's talking about the creation of man when he made man he said i am and he says all the way back he says lord god let's go into genesis and just look at this together aaron mentioned this on sunday and uh i wrote it down i really enjoyed it and i want to review this because of this quote genesis 1 it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and brother venom talks about this right out of um right about right out of the school field bible in genesis 1 1 he even uses some of the languages in the notes here in the scofield bible but in the beginning god amen it's elohim or el or ella and brother brennam all the time will say el ella elohim el ella elohim and he said these are these are just three ways of saying the same thing but it's it's this exactly what aaron mentioned it's a compound meaning of two words meaning the strong one and also one who's bound by an oath so there's a strong one who's bound by an oath it's god who bound himself by his own word but when he gets over to genesis chapter 2 genesis chapter 2. verse 4 these are the generations of heaven and earth when when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens so they're using a new term now in genesis 2 as lord god and after he makes man now there's an expression of lord god amen which is jehovah elohim so this this is also a compound it's the self-existing one we hear brother brahm say that all all the time he's a self-existing one but but there's also a part of this word jehovah comes from the word hava which means to to become to become to become known amen or becoming so that's why aaron said there's a compound meaning he didn't break it down but he says it's a compound the self-existent one who's becoming or to become so now when when he's god and when he when he's in the beginning god he's elohim he's the strong one amen who's bound by his word but now when he begins the rate to relate to humanity he makes man now he is uh lord god he's jehovah elohim he's jehovah the self-existing one who's becoming amen and that's why brother branham says who's revealing himself he uses that term revealing himself because as he's becoming what does he mean by becoming i mean it's not that he wasn't amen but whatever he was he's becoming manifest in this dispensation and as he's becoming he's revealing himself so it's the self-existent one who reveals himself how does he reveal himself by becoming do we understand that so it's not that it's a self-existent one who reveals himself by staying in heaven and spurting out words to reveal himself no in this in this self-revelation of the self-existing one he becomes the word and as he becomes the word he reveals himself oh praise be to god that's why you're the revelation of the word it's him becoming that's what aaron was talking about on sunday it's the same thing so when brother branham uses these terms amen he's saying you know uh uh ella elohim jehovah yahweh and he's mixing them all up but he keeps going back to the self-existing one who reveals himself or the self-existing one who's revealing himself but when you really go back to it that revelation is a becoming because god wanted to become tangible it's god becoming tangible is jehovah the self-existing one who's becoming and that becoming is him revealing himself praise god that's why creation was a revelation that's why the creation of man was a great revelation it was jehovah it was the self-existing one revealing himself when he made man and when he made man male and female it was a self-existing one revealing himself male and female so it says in genesis we'll read this quote again genesis 2 when he made man jehovah yahweh jehovah what did it mean i'm the self-existing one one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine o glory what jehovah means that he gave man to be listen he said jehovah means that god that he gave man to be an amateur god because he is father god and he made man an amateur god so he isn't self-existing anymore he exists with his family what is that the self-existing one who reveals himself how in the creation of man the man and his wife putting them together in the garden that was that that was jehovah that was the word made manifest it was the word made flesh he is the word it was the strong one bound by a nose who's self-existing who's now revealing himself by what by becoming amen so now he's not alone he exists with his family amen ella elohim now now he is jehovah jehovah meaning the one who exists the one who exists with his family brother ram says that is now jehovah jehovah meaning the one who exists with this family you can't find that if you're looking for that exact phrase in any bible translation that you ever find but it's exactly what is happening when job is revealing himself he's becoming he's becoming one he's becoming tangible how does he become tangible as he comes family by family attribute by attribute family member by family member he is becoming tangible he's becoming visible he's becoming known in his attributes so what is jehovah brother man's the definition the one who exists with his family what is that family it's him revealing himself what is family the family is the revelation of him it is god becoming are you in the family that makes you part of jehovah automatically now god made man to be predominant over the earth he had dominion and the earth was man's dominion is that is that scripture then if that's his domain he was god over the earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak this and it would be so oh there he is god jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence now exists with his family and his little ones with him there you are that's jehovah where's jehovah at now jesus christ in a many men are by he's still becoming what becoming tangible to becoming known he's becoming known now as a bride he was known as a church but now he's being known as a bride what is it it's a further expression of jehovah so that's why we when we take these terms uh you know there's a denominational understanding of the great jehovah and that the great jehovah puts him over here or puts him in this place and puts him in that place but the great jehovah now exists with his family the self-existing one who's becoming one who's becoming tangible how is he becoming tangible he's becoming tangible through his family what is his family his attributes what are his attributes his thoughts from before the foundation of the world that have come down into flesh and been born again by the baptism in the holy ghost now manifesting his life what is that jehovah on display that's the self-existing one dwelling with his family we're part of that expression it's not god over there it's not god there it's not someday god and one day god it's god here now expressed in his family it's god in me it's god in you that's why you can't disrespect me and i can't disrespect you because it's the self-existing one amen with his family what is it in you it's the self-existing one becoming is the self-existing one revealing himself in you amen and i can't disrespect that and you can't disrespect it in me if i disrespect it in you i've disrespected jehovah because it's jehovah the self-existent one becoming whatever portion you were meant to play whatever part that you have in the body amen nobody else can take it it's your part and if i disrespect that or disregard that i have rejected jehovah now you see why we have to be careful how we speak about one another how we treat one another even in error even in wrong even in mistakes we've got to be very careful how we treat the bride of jesus christ how we treat one another amen because because you cannot reject jehovah see sometimes we want to determine because this brother doesn't agree with me or he doesn't have this doctrinal position or or this or that i want to make him outside of christ but if i take an expression of christ and i myself call him antichrist i have become antichrist because i'm against the word because what is that that's a positional place son or daughter of god that is the word on display i have now rejected the word sometimes it's better just put your hand over your mouth you remember uh you remember when they were disputing over the body of moses michael the archangel i mean michael he did not even bring a railing accusation when contending with satan he just said the lord deal with you i'm doing what he told me to do it would be so much better if we would just say god bless you and may the lord may the lord bless you and lead you may the lord deal with you i'm not going to say i'm not going to judge i'm not going to put you in and put you out but there's so there's such a there's such a pride and an arrogancy in human beings amen that if you're against me in any way or contradictory or say something i don't agree with i immediately want to label you with a label that comes from my own will and desire i'm calling you antichrist i'm calling you not in the bride i'm calling you foolish virgin i'm calling you whatever amen and you don't realize that with your very words you you've taken an antichrist spirit and become an expression of antichrist not an expression of christ i said god help us help us we all know what it's like to feel guilty of that we all know what it's like to be quick in judgment quick to speak and say god help us help us you know what that's just another expression that's different than this expression it's like when you get into a relationship with your wife and you get to know one another better you realize she is a different expression than you are like things that you thought were normal all your life this is the right way this is the way everybody thinks about this then you start talking to your wife and she comes from left field with a whole different set of thoughts and you're like you're wrong and she's looking at you like you're wrong but you got but but both are an accurate expression of god according to your makeup i'm not talking about an argument i'm just talking about a viewpoint a way of looking a way of seeing you take circumstances and you analyze it and you come up with two totally different uh modes of operation or two totally different approaches to the same thing what is that it's two expressions of the same thing male and female but if you drive the line too hard and you say well i know this is right because the lord led me there and if you're different than that then you're not of god get thee behind me wife then you're missing another expression amen when god took the two and made them one you're missing another expression of yourself same thing with your brothers and sisters the teacher is one expression of christ the pastor is another the evangelist is another and if we take one and reject the other we become antichrist we when a brother you have brother bam said you look out there all kinds of different types you see some that are real bolsters some are real exuberant you got that peter they're real bold and they're loud you have some that are just he says he says like this you have some that are just real nice [Applause] what was he calling peter i wonder they're just okay you know but that was those were john and peter were both expressions of the nature of christ paul was another expression timothy was a different expression even thomas was a certain expression so this is a god the the self-existing one becoming becoming tangible and we have to be careful and let everybody find their place even the scripture makes it so simple how can the uh how can the eye say to the hand i have no need of thee i may have the wrong words don't condemn me please how can how can this part say to this part i have no need of you but god is so fast in the body that even the uncomely parts we've bestowed more honor on god has even made your human body amen he's made our human body in such a way and put us in a human body so that we could understand the self-existing god who's becoming so that we would understand jehovah amen brother said i want all of my body even the little tip of my finger i want it to stay right there well that should relate to the body of christ i mean you may be one of those boisterous bold ones or you may be one of those that's just nice but they both have to be here they both have to be on display they both have to be expressing something of the nature of god to have a full expression we can't all be the same way so let's let one another find our position get into our place let's encourage one another in our positions and in our places and not try to constantly chip away and mold somebody to be a reflection of our desire but let them be a reflection of jehovah the self-existing one in 1965 the god who is rich in mercy brother brahma says now if you've got eternal life tonight if you have eternal life then we always were because there was only one form of eternal life we always were and the reason we were because we are part of god and god is only god is the only thing that's eternal so if you have eternal life if eternal life is in you then you're part of god it's god in you praise god i don't think we can fully grasp that i know i don't and i don't mind saying that because brother graham says i don't understand it like i should you guys he said you don't understand it like you should because i don't understand it like i should because a part of god is not like if i tear a piece of my bible out and pull off a little corner and give it to you and all you've got is that little piece and you might know what book it is in what chapter and you don't know much but a part of god contains everything that god is all that god is all the wisdom all the knowledge all the knowing all the power all the resources all there same in quality just different in quantity you have a portion but you have a portion with the full dna all of it is there now you may only express a portion of that but it's all there so if we could only grasp that there's a part of god eternal life zoe life god it's on you it's in you it was predestined to be part of you before the foundation of the world it was there if we could just realize that it would change so much i'm begging god to give me a greater revelation than that because where's fear then where's anxiety then amen where where is all of this depression and stuff go when we realize who we are amen god has got to lift us on a higher plane and get above the carnal thinking and break away all the amnesia to realize who we actually are amen to get above some of the things that trouble us so much i'm desiring it for myself i get troubled i get bogged down then i get ashamed of myself because the realization comes of who we are and god's calling and you're like i never should have worried in the first place but he says now continuing on in this same quote he says and like as melchizedek received tithes from abraham and it was allotted to his great-grandson levi who was yet in the loins of abraham paid tithes for he was yet in the loins of abraham when he met melchizedek i want to speak on that over at the other place one morning who is this milk is a day now notice that way back god knew this boy coming down he knowed all things now we are part of god you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in god you were only in his thinking your very name if it ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare you brother bran's not trying to mix up your doctor and he's trying to straighten doctrine out you were if you're a part of god you've always been a part of god you were with him before there was a molecule before there was dust before there was starlight before there was anything you were a part of god and if all of that would happen to fade away you would still exist you may not exist in this form but you would still exist [Applause] he's trying to straighten this out not twist it up see you're not going to be but now you are the sons of god see you always were the sons of god for when god had you in his thinking at the beginning you had to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before there well when when he before he was before he even become material here on earth before there was anything but god you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be he knowed the color of hair you would have and you're worried about what the job's going to do tomorrow you see teaching positionally places teaching gives us the right kind of faith brother branham came to set this doctrine straight to take away the fear and the scare he before there was one material thing made in the universe he knew what color hair you would have he knew what color eyes you would have and he knew what you would do why are we worried about what the job is going to do or what the economy is going to do or what's going to happen tomorrow before there was a tomorrow he knew what color eyes i was going to have praise god he know what color hair you would have he knowed all about you the only thing happened is when you being a sinner many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy or a little girl you would walk around there would be certain things that would just where it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was god somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then it was in you then it didn't come to your new birth it was there the holy spirit the spirit of christ the spirit of god came to you to waken that up to bring it to life it didn't bring it to you amen what happened was two parts a male and female part come together for a new birth see brother branham is telling us this to take the scare away i was walking here last night at 10 30 at night or something like that it was dark and i was walking down the lane down this way and looking at the stars and i just began to cry because i was thinking this quote and i realized god i have loved you all my life i remember as a little boy wanting to know god i mean i didn't know how to get saved i went to the altar a couple times and you know in the pentecostal church i didn't know how to meet god i didn't know how to connect him i didn't know very much but there was something down in me and i can say from the bottom of my heart i've loved god all my life even backslidden even doing wrong even when when i regret the things that i was doing and the times in my life there was something in me i've loved god all my life where did that come from what is that that's more than a man that's more than a human being when sometimes still when i'm alone you know and the pressure comes off and i'm not worried about all the things that i need to do decisions i need to make but i just get out and i take a walk and i'm under the stars all of a sudden when all that lifts that thing comes right back and i begin to weep and i begin to say god i love you and all i want under those conditions the only thing in my life i want is the knowing more i mean you'll weep underneath the heavens you'll weep when you see uh the grandeur and beauty of his creation you weep when you hear the word when you read the message when you listening you begin to weep and then you give a longing for me i have a longing i want whatever this barrier is in me because no matter i love him so much but i still feel i still feel that there's more i still feel a barrier and it's the barrier of hybridization no matter how how much we grow how really makes himself no matter how many experiences we have amen i'm longing to break through this barrier of hybridization amen and to know him as i am known to break through and go to complete freedom out of human carnality i want more of him not less and when i say more of him i'm not looking for a new doctrine or a new revelation that's how he gives himself more of us more revelation he reveals himself more but i'm not even talking about that i just want i just want to be closer whatever this distance is i want to bridge the gap whatever bridges that gap is what i want i've loved him all my life you've loved him all your life how why what caused you to pray little prayers when you were five and six and seven years old what was that that was god in there where did it come from it came from the mind of god from before the foundation of the world so many of you many of you can relate with me on this there was a little something form of life in you then then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination but one day you being part of god you had to be part of the word and when you heard the word you know where you come from you know that was the truth you were always the seed was in you always the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you came to it it wasn't what you did right it wasn't your successes it wasn't even even though god would use correct teaching and correct gospel and it wasn't just the correctness of the teaching it was the word finding the word it was the word coming to the word it was that part of you that came from god connecting to another part that came from god the word to the word and brought that seed to life and the power of transformation brother man says and we we had talked talked about the word of predestination you see that stumbles so many of them it's god's word he uses it for we are predestinated by the word of god and in that when you were predestinated why it has it has to happen because it is that god chose you because he knowed what you would do from the beginning so i'm wanting to move on into placing of sons i'm just we're still laying a foundation but we're moving on god chose you because he knowed what you would do from the beginning and and so many times we're struggling with what can i do for the lord what should i do for the lord he already knows and sometimes what i think we need to do more than anything that's what i want to get across today is quit fretting more than anything we just need to quit fretting and we need to quit trying and we need to start resting and start trusting because he knew what i would do before the foundation of the world in ephesians 2 let's go look at ephesians 2 together ephesians chapter two brother ben has a quote we'll get to in a minute but brother starts talking about the ephesians is the joshua of the new testament the joshua the new testament brings them to a promised land and joshua begins to positionally place them in the promised land and brother baby tells him that's what ephesians is and we went through that when we talked about armenians versus calvinism and how ephesians pulls the two together but brother brown starts off the book of ephesians or paul starts it off in the book of ephesians by so securely placing you in predestination in christ that you can have no doubt about who you are and then he comes in the middle and he begins to tell you that you've got a position or a place in the body and then at the end he tells you now go do it and and balances the thing out but ephesians chapter 2 verse 8 let's just read this for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any men should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them so god we're his workmanship we are god's workmanship we are the thing that he's working on his we let's i'd say it this way we are his project we are his project we're his building where his vineyard where his garden we are his project that he created in christ jesus unto good works that that which god has before ordained that we should walk in them he already determined that there's something for you to do he knew there's something for moses to do knew there was something for paul to do there was something for noah to do amen but but so many times we can look at the bible stories and we could see he had something for brother branham to do and we could see amen these big tangible things in these large ministries and we say yeah i see that for them but what about for me if it's true for them it's true for you too it's true for every attribute of god so so i think sometimes so so many times we reference the scriptures and we point to like noah building an ark i mean that's a huge endeavor moses bringing a ministry amen and gone through him destroying egypt and bringing them out with a mighty hand that's a huge thing amen but you realize that's no different than what he's called us to do moses only walked in obedience god did all the work moses didn't do anything all moses did was obey when god said speak he spoke when god said move he moved he realized it wasn't moses it was god and god gave a portion of moses a portion of noah a portion to you in a portion to me and it's not us it's him and if he chooses your portion amen if he chooses your portion to be something that they won't write articles about amen then what is it to us to begrudge the portion he's given to us what are we saying about the great mind of god and the great wisdom of god and the plan he had before the foundation of the world so many times we're stomping right on the plan and purpose of god in our life stepping on it trying to reach for something that's not ours for a gift or a position and it's not even ours and we're stomping and treading all over the beautiful thing he's trying to do through us because to us it doesn't have great value but it's the self-existing one expressing himself as a mama as a daddy as a metal worker as a as a mailman and we want to play that down because i want to have a gift i want to be like brother so-and-so i want to be like sister so-and-so i want to play i want to sing i want to write a song amen he already knows he knows what works you do you created in the good works which he before ordained that you should do before the foundation of the world he knows what you'll do we just need to get with his program and relax relax in adoption part four he says how was our inheritance given to us through what predestination predestination is foreknowledge how did god know he would trust you to be a preacher his foreknowledge not because you were doing a good job at being a christian how did he know he could trust you be a preacher you were doing a good job of being a christian so he decided that's somebody i can make a preacher his foreknowledge knew you would be a preacher he may have had to wait for you to get in the right condition he made it wait for you to submit he he may have had to bring the preaching of the word to wash some things out of your life before he could put you in that position but he always knew you would be there amen how did he know he could trust you with it because of his foreknowledge not because of the merit of your character but because of his foreknowledge i mean god doesn't choose somebody to be a songwriter or a singer or a musician a man or a song leader or a preacher on the merit of their conduct but it's based on their foreknowledge that's why some of those people were horrible heathens before god called them and it wasn't the merit of their conduct that god used although god had to bring him into the body god had to sanctify him he had to get him in a certain position so that he could use them amen why did he do that you realize it's not because that they put their home in order that god says now i'm going to make you a preacher or you know it's not climbing the corporate ladder all right you come and you cleaned yourself up you got a haircut you wore a tie to church amen and god's going to now make you a deacon and you've done a good job you put your home in order you follow now god's going to make you a preacher which one is the highest position in the body brother brown said he that's the greatest should be servant of all and the term minister means servant and if you go to the bible servant was not like now would be like oh he's the servant of god but that term in the bible's servant was the foot washed flunky the one who did the dishes the one who cleaned out the chamber pot realized the servant the slave i mean the lowest in the household was the servant amen and the minister is the servant that's what ministry means service it's not a place to climb up to amen it's not it's not a it's not a reward for being a good christian it's not a it's not a projection on my scale of christianity that someday like somebody says someday i want to be a manager of this department someday i want to be a minister no someday i want to fully trust in god and him to have preeminence so he can do exactly what he wanted to do in my life i want to someday get to the place where i'm not hindering him in any way and i'm not slowing him down or holding him back in any way that's our goal friends that's our projection my projection is for him to have preeminence in me that's why david could say i would rather i would rather be the doorkeeper i'd rather lay at the door than in king's tents king's palaces i whatever position i mean whatever i can do for god is greater than anything else and he was king of israel he says brother bram says improving his word when i look around sometime and see these rickeys and raketas that we got today and on the streets and how everything's going on i think oh god wait a minute he says see my timepiece is turning just exactly right i've got to put you up on the same basis i did the first man them days and i put you on the same basis of luther and on the same basis of wesley because you see sin wasn't known then like it is now and when we got more knowledge now than we had then and when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises a standard against it and now today we've got more knowledge more understanding so the rivers of unbelief is flowing in hard but god raises a standard against it but remember the reason the reason he predestinated these things to happen he foretold them by his prophets that they would happen and when the righteous see those things confirmed then they know it's right regardless of what anyone else says see they know it's right we find out over there and i believe it is first thessalonians he said he has predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ god not saying i'll choose you i don't choose you but his foreknowledge knowed what you would do and so now we we see the world is getting so wicked and so bad i mean it has grown so much worse and i say the last two years wickedness on the increase depredation i mean things that are just i mean you can hardly talk about but why why why would god put me in this age why would god put me here he knew before the foundation of the world you would be here and he made sure you had some ingredients inside of you that was a perfect match for the day that you would live in because he knew satan's eating would come to culmination he knew it would come to a perfect satan's eating he knew evil would come amen to perfect freedom to express itself so before the foundation of the world he put something in you to overcome that that's why you're here in this wicked day that's why you're here in this evil age because you've been predestinated to meet the challenge of the hour so there's no fear about oh what will happen to our family how will we raise our children if it gets much worse what are we going to do you've been predestinated to make the final stand and the worst of times you are you were called in christ jesus under good works which he before ordained that you would do if there's a stand to be taken there was a stand in the foreknowledge of god and god knew who would make that stand and he pre-programmed you in the seat on the inside to make the stand he pre-programmed you to stand in the face of wickedness and evil and debauchery he's still in the world falling apart you are pre-programmed to stand in this day how do you know that brother chad because you're here in this day and god doesn't make mistakes and he knew he knew his works from the beginning of the world he knew what he would do he's not changing anything now you realize he didn't have to come amen and say oh man it's getting pretty bad uh things are getting bad i better open the seal so they'll make it he knew exactly when it would get bad when he was going to open the seals when he was going to bring the revelation of his great mystery because everything is clicking just right on time you're here because you're supposed to be here it's bad because it's supposed to be bad and you're able to overcome because he predestinated you to overcome this condition stock market crashes and you lose all your investment you're predestinated to go through that trial don't wring your hands don't fret and worry god has ordained us to be here he's ordained the works and sometimes in order to get in order to get us where we need to be he lets things get really bad so he can express what's on the inside of us which was in his mind before the foundation of the world see david david was programmed to kill a bear did god know that david would kill a lion and kill a bear you believe that so if god knew that david could kill a lion and kill a bear and he programmed david for killing a lion killing a bear and that was part of the works from before the foundation of the world then you realize god had to send a lion because he already in his mind knew david would slay the lion so god had to allow the lion to come you know and it probably wasn't david's best day on the job it probably wasn't the most the most rewarding thing that ever happened in his life he was probably under tension he was probably afraid he probably i mean there was all kinds of emotions he was going through and he probably felt responsible he probably was nervous he was probably all alone amen all the things that you and i go through when we face danger and we face trouble but he was already programmed to kill the lion but but when he killed the lion he wasn't done because he was already programmed to kill the bear so after god sends a lion now god's obligated to allow the bear to come he was also programmed to kill goliath you know we don't put ourselves in position god puts us in position david never woke up and said i'm going to be a giant killer today he was programmed before the foundation of the world to be the one that god would use and that didn't make him a better son than the other seven sons even jesse didn't believe that it was david maybe there was characteristics in the other ones that far outshined his characteristics maybe there was attributes that that even his father jesse saw and no doubt samuel psalm 2 and the first one that would really this would be the one but god had already determined who it would be so the anointing oil was poured out on the correct one that's why martin luther's not here today that's why john wesley's not here today and i'll tell you something else that's why brother white brother bam is not here today he was programmed for his part he did it your program for this part you can't take his place and he can't take your place because david was designed predestinated to kill goliath god had to move his daddy to want to send cheese and bread on a certain day at a certain time to a certain place you realize for david to begin to move into his purpose into god's plan for his life david never moved himself if you watch the plan of god and the children of god down through the old testament to the new testament these people weren't they weren't they weren't going down through catalogs of jobs i can do for god they weren't rolling the roll of decks and see i got these skills and these qualifications they weren't shopping for a job they weren't brushing up their resume they weren't trying to get new skill sets to eventually move into a position that god worked out all the circumstances god did all the work he got everybody in the right place at the right time to do the right thing and if he had to interrupt him if he had to meet him with a pillar of fire to interrupt their plans and knock them off their horse he did it because it was his purpose and his plan paul wasn't looking to be the church age messenger brother branham wasn't looking to be the church age messenger but it was god's plan from before the foundation of the world so god was obligated to come to him and put him in a position brother branham never could have put himself in he didn't have the resources he didn't have the friendships he had nothing to put himself in the position god put him in he didn't have the education he didn't have the speaking style he didn't have he had nothing you brother had nothing to make possible a worldwide ministry but god had called him to a worldwide ministry so god it looked like with this circumstance that circumstance that circumstance man you got lucky you know i've even heard people i've heard this with my own ears you know if things have went another way if i had made a few different decisions i could have seen myself in the ministry if really that thinking is here let's flush that out today you know if i hadn't made a few different decisions if i would have done things a little different if something would have went different i would i could have had that position or i could have been that or i could have done that you've just made your decision more powerful than god's purpose from before the foundation of the world i said god have your way in me you know the way that i take you know the predestinated plan help me to walk in him now i want to go just a little bit further and adoption part two baby says when did you notice moses that great miracle performer that brought down israel down through the land and brought them up to the promised land but did not place their inheritance to them he did not give them their inheritance he led them up to the land but joshua divided the land to the people is that right and christ brought the church up to the place where the possession was made to them was given to them just the jordan to cross but the holy spirit is the one who sets the church in order the joshua of today puts the church in order in its order giving to each one gifts places position and he is the voice of god speaking to the inner man that christ has saved the holy spirit how do you get that much of it now we now we're getting over into the book of ephesians now the same way he positionally placed the church where they belong now joshua places them in the natural land the holy spirit is placing the church positionally in the land that they in the position that they belong in in their inheritance so now as joshua come he represents the holy ghost today who puts everybody in their position amen so now this tribe goes here because the word of god declared it the prophet said now he's dividing it out and he's positionally placing all the believers in that day into the proper place amen and brother brahms typing that right now with ephesians and right where we're at that god is placing each one of us in the place that we belong by the holy ghost and he's doing it in the word and i i just want to i'm going to cut ahead for a minute to something i want to say we we say sometimes when we come to the lord and god gets a hold of our life and we're filled with the spirit and we begin to live a life for him we're looking for something new something different another position sometimes they're coming to adoption i need a position in the church and and paul says remain as you are in whatever vocation you came and remain there if you're a soldier stay a soldier if you're married stay married you stay in whatever state you came but your positional placing is placing in the word in wherever you are in life so if i could explain it this way you say you know what's my position and i would ask you where you're at like what's going on in your life where are you at are you married do you have children are you a wife and a mother initially i'm going to say well there's your position your position is a wife your position your mother your position is a father your position is you know i'm i'm this kind of employee employee i'm this or that that's your position because that's where god called you when you were in that he called you in that and the apostle paul said stay that way right so that's your position but you said but i was doing this before and i'll say it this way you weren't doing it according to the word before you may have been a mother but you weren't a word mother you may have been a wife but you weren't a word wife you may have been a husband but you weren't a word husband you want a word father you were just a father like every other every other human that has an ability to procreate as a father but when god calls you into the word he places you as a godly father as a godly mother as a word wife as a word husband as a word employee see sometimes we get the wrong idea amen we're coming into adoption i've got to have a place in the body of christ amen i've got to find find my position don't worry your position will find you just walk true to the word walk in submissive life and whatever you are be a word employee be a word employer be a word grandfather be a word retiree you know let the word have preeminence because that's what he wants jesus christ wants to be known as a father as a mother as a husband as a wife it's the expression of jehovah in you so so many times we're looking looking for a position that's why i said you're trampling over the one you've got i i have watched with my own eyes and grieved in my heart at men who called it a young age into the ministry and they absolutely devalue their family to try to preach the gospel trample over the heart of their wife and ignore their children i have watched with my own eyes as a man in the ministry will run from place to place he's not even preaching but he'll go from meeting the meeting and what he's out there doing is networking trying to find places to preach and he's got a wife at home with two or three little babies trying to do it herself i'd say he's not fit to preach because he's trampling over a god-given position reaching for another one and i would say he's got no business taking it if god wants you to have it he'll give it to you you don't have to go from meeting to meeting convention to convention ministers this and that to try to get a place to preach if god wants you to preach he'll have you preach they'll find your number they'll look you up you don't even have to print a business card i've never had one i still don't have one right there's too much self-promotion too much grabbing too much seeking and not enough just resting and let god be god and trust in god's plan for my life and surrender wherever i'm at if if god has given me a wife if i'm a newly married man then my whole ministry is as a husband to that wife if i'm a brother in the church my ministry is a brother in the church if i'm a sister in the church my ministry is a sister in the church if i have a husband my ministry is a wife if i have a wife my ministry is a husband and sometimes we we make silly comments but i'm seeking the lord from my position how are you doing with the one you have how's your family doing how does your wife feel how are your children doing how is your attendance to church how do the brothers and sisters around you feel do they feel loved and encouraging you see positional placing is not about a title in the church it's about the position in the body that you hold you realize all of these gifts are mingled out through the whole body you take the gift of knowledge knowledge what is knowledge knowledge is understanding of the word what is wisdom wisdom is the proper application of that word you think only preachers have knowledge and wisdom i can name off names i won't because they'd be embarrassed but i can tell you people who have a gift of knowledge in the word in this assembly and never preach once in the pulpit and they have a ministry to the rest of the body you can sit with them and if you've got a question about the bible they can start flipping through and telling you where it is in the message and what brother ben said about it what is that that's part of the body a joint that supplieth same thing with the gift of wisdom gift of helps there's people with a gift of help you know what they don't know how they do it but they always find themselves helping and sometimes they ask themselves how do i always get in this position how does this how does this always happen to me because that's a position in the body other people can recognize it they come and ask you for help because you're good at it because it's a gift i mean sometimes we don't even recognize that we are positionally placed god has put us in the body he's put you in the local assembly he wants you he's put you in the family he's gonna want you in amen he's put you under the ministry he wants you under amen and whatever he's done to you genetically naturally genetically is part of that calling the parents the grandparents all that he worked together to get you the way are just so you can have that certain ring to the bell and so you can do that certain thing amen and it may never show up on the on the billboards it may never show up even in a grand announcement or even a grand thank you from the pulpit but it's an essential part of the body and so when i started talking about positional placing so many times you know we can get nervous and start thinking about well you know i mean i don't know if i'm a deacon i don't know if i'm a trustee i don't know if i'm a sunday school this or that it's like i'll tell you right now hands down i would love to be a singer secret desire of mine if i got the pick i'd go to god and say god i mean let me sing [Music] let me sing you know what it doesn't matter how hard i try or how i deceive myself when i'm alone that's not my position i can't do it i tried to have an altar call a couple times it was a flop that's not my style ministry i did it because i saw other people do it it was effective i saw a need i thought i'll try to meet the need it went over like a lead balloon i was in the philippines one time and i preached my heart out and honestly i have no idea how to have an altar call i don't know how people do it but some people i mean it's just like wham and people are weeping and crying and i'm like that's wonderful i can't do it i was in the philippines one time just preached my heart out just a message that preached my heart out and all of a sudden people started coming up for prayer i started praying for people a prayer line started we went through a prayer line people were getting delivered things were happening i ended up praying for almost the whole church and standing there for two hours could i repeat that not on your life i have no idea how to do those things see it's not about i want to be this style i want to have that and i'm mimicking this this is what's needed and i want to fill this need it doesn't matter what's needed if you're not the recipe if you're not the ingredient to fill to meet that need all you're going to do is mess the whole thing up if i come here every day and i try to bring convicting messages and really blah blah blah and get you fired up and come to the altar every service you guys would be standing looking at me like a mule looking at a new gate like what is wrong with him because it wouldn't fit it wouldn't click it wouldn't have that feeling but when you come and just be what god made you it fits when you see somebody who's got wisdom or somebody who's got a gift of helps or or an encourager when you see it it just clicks it just fits it's not a misfit you don't have to make it fit you don't have to wiggle it around and pop it in position it's just a fit see we're predestinated unto the placing of sons to be a working member of the body to work with the whole body but we don't need a certain title we don't need to use our own mind we just need to yield to the lord let's turn to ephesians 4. i read this a couple weeks ago but i'd like to read it again and i want to remind you of solomon in his golden age when when in second corinthians 9 when the queen of sheba come to him and she saw his wisdom she saw the meat of his table and she saw his cupbearers and his porters and and she saw how he went up to the lord's house and now he come to when she saw the whole kingdom what did she see she was looking at she was looking at a kingdom that was adopted you're looking at adoption because moses led them out amen under justification he led them out they went through sanctification in the wilderness and under the baptism holy ghost they come into the land brother said when you get baptized with the holy ghost under the new birth you're just getting started that's not the finish and they come into the new land and they conquer and they build they inhabit cities and they start governments and they fail and they have judges and it doesn't work and then they pick their own king and and that falls apart and but then god brings a king on the scene and that king that you know he he squashes the rebellion he brings peace to him he's in and david starts setting an order setting an order of the worship setting in order the singer setting an order of the priest he starts gathering for the temple he starts setting an order those who would be porters and those who who would judge you start setting an order then he turns it all over to the sun amen and the sun brings him into a golden age and we talked about that he begins to judge the spirits in the church that are hindering them as much as the father could give out the word much as the father and i want you to think of father and son now with david and solomon as much as the father could give out the word amen could give out the positions could give out the order until they could come to a golden age he had to come and there had to be somebody to come and pass judgment and get jealousy and envy and strife and hatred and backbiting and self-gain he had to rid the kingdom of all of that and when he read the kingdom of all of that there was already a word given and everybody began to move into the word they were already positionally placed by birth of what tribe they were born and determined what land they would be what land they moved into had a great deal to do with their occupation were in the mountains they didn't raise corn amen they heard it sheep or goats or they mined or whatever but they're where they landed by the sea amen they were fishermen in the plains they raised wheat crops wherever wherever they were positioned and they were positioned by birth brother venom says as those women would groan and travail they would call out reuben or ephraim they would call out the tribal name over them when they were born and they were born predestinated to a position in the kingdom we were born the exact same way you were born predestinated to a position and in that position we talked about the extreme effort that it would go into just to get the daily portion of meat to the king's table which was one of the things that that the queen of sheba saw that impressed her so much when she saw all this there was no more heart in there and every joint with supply what were we looking at we were looking at a at a church who had came through justification sanctification the baptism holy ghost moving into the promised land amen taking their position taking their land amen but then they had to come up to the word and then up to the manifestation of the word they had to come to the golden age under solomon's reign and every joint had to be supplying with no envy no strife no backbiting no hating no malice amen do you really do you really think amen that we are in the position we need to be in if we've got hate and strife and backbiting and malice among us i say judgment begins at the house of god we need we need a solomon we need the holy ghost here we need the son of god son of david the son of man here to purge us of all of those things so that everybody could take their portion and then the queen of sheba looked there in second corinthians nine she looked and she says happy are your men happy are your servants they weren't like all i ever get to do is plow in the field sure wish i was a porter that's comical but we do the same thing sit in our houses sit in our seats and say well you know if god if god made me a trustee or something it would make me damn do something for him we may not even verbalize that but sometimes there's those the devil puts those thoughts there instead of just doing what comes natural just do what you do do what god's called you to it's ordained it's predestinated you can't miss it quit overthinking it quit thinking about it just rest just trust the lord just walk the walk a christian walk every day sanctify your life unto him every day ask him that preeminence in you and i guarantee you're going to go to places amen and do things for the lord that he's ordained for you to do and sometimes you may not even realize it but there may be times you're even surprised at what happens in your life you know when brother you know we're talking about adoption and placing and i'm not doing a very good job of getting to my subject but we're just going to preach anyways brother branham you know you're going to say when did brother ben come to adoption because we start to play these games what is adoption what you know when you finally hit your place when brother branham was called to ministry was he adopted you know i i'll say it this way i'll say it this way i think like everything else there's layers of revelation under adoption because really if we want to be truthful the true adoption for us is when we get a change in the body when he lifts us on high changes our garment says this is my sign amen that's going to be our true adoption but yet we've got to come to a positional place in adoption before then so so there's layers to adoption brother branham come and he become a minister he started revivals and he started preaching but then shortly after that he became a pastor and for a past he was a pastor for more than 10 years for for more like 14 15 years but then god called him from there and moved him to a worldwide evangelism healing ministry but that wasn't the destination but nowhere along you realize brother branham he just moved as god moved him as the door opened he walked he never had his eye set on any particular thing his goal wasn't any one thing he was never feeling like i haven't arrived because i'm not this i'm not doing anything again because i'm not there amen and then god would move him from that worldwide ministry and healing and healing ministry and then even moving to be the manifestation of the seventh angel to really his whole purpose in his life and maybe come into that manifestation at the opening of the seven seals and the preaching of the mystery what was he before what was he next what was he after i'll say it like this he was the son of god he was a son of god walking in the plan of god what i'm hoping to do is take away all this self analysis and position hunting and label seeking and just be a son and daughter of god with a life fully committed that whatever he's put in your hand whatever you find in your hand do it with all thy might if it's a daddy be a goddaddy if it's a mommy be a god mommy amen if god's opened the door for you to teach sunday school do with all your mind amen if god's asked you to be a deacon do it with all of your heart amen but don't forsake the mommy daddy thing too well not mommy daddy sorry we don't have deaconesses you see whatever he puts in your hand do it if it's to be a brother be a brother if it's to be a contributor be a contributor if it's to be part of the body if it's to encourage people with your presence encourage people with your presence you realize whatever god gives us to do do it with our might forget about the silly questions well what's your position next time somebody asks you that you say i don't know you tell me i'm in the body of christ i'm part of the body i want to read this last scripture and then we're going to slow down we're not even near where we're supposed to be but we're going to have to wind her down let's read ephesians 4 and 11. and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers now i talked about this a week or two ago but i i'd like to reemphasize this he didn't give the fifo ministry to be honored to be worshiped to be praised to be the ultimate of a christian experience on earth but he sent those gifts for a reason they had a specific purpose and that purpose was for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the formers of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working and the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so what is the purpose of the fightful ministry to get the bride to the same shape israel was in when solomon was on the throne is that what the scripture says every joint supplies every knee every organ every cell every fiber every hair where all the body fitly joined together worketh together for love for the building up of the body of christ for the perfection of the saints amen to do away with all false notions false doctrines that create scare and hold back the body from expression that's what the fifo ministry is sent for the firefight ministry has sent amen to help the bride find her place to move into an adopted position amen where every joint supply and the body is functioning as one body so every mother every father every grandmother every aunt uncle sunday school teacher you name me whatever position every widow widower everybody amen they come into their own they find their position they get in harmony with the plan of god in their lives and everybody is a contributing member to everybody else and then you know what we'll see we'll see whatever the queen of sheba saw when she come into the kingdom of israel because israel had come to a golden age israel come to an adoption amen everybody's free if if my job if if i feel good encouraging somebody i'm free to encourage somebody and i'm free to say that's what god wants me to do not what does god want you i don't know what god wants me to do i don't know i mean just do what you do do what you do god will open the next door do what you love do what do what you see inspires people encourages people bless these people do what comes natural do what's in you let what's in you come out an expression and quit worrying about what you're supposed to be be what you are i hope that through teaching this that we can give people the freedom to be what they already are not seek to be something that they will never become no more frustration no more you know i remember uh sister mita her daughter rebecca told a story one time i think they wrote it in in one of the magazines i can't remember where i read it but she was talking about sister mita and sister media was always ironing ironing ironing and rebecca told her mom after she was grown me to come over to the house was helping her iron some stuff and she she told mom she said mom i'm so glad you enjoy ironing i just don't enjoy it and sister meter said who told you i enjoy ironing she said well you're always doing it and she told rebecca's story she said you know years ago when your daddy brother branham was in the ministry he said i saw all these other wives of these evangelical ministers they were always helping their husbands they're always planning events and planning dinners and doing this she said i couldn't do any of that and i used to feel so discouraged she says finally one day i was i was feeling low i was feeling discouraged i was ironing a shirt and she goes she was just talking to the lord she was just crying out lord i can't do like these other women i can't and somehow the lord led her to understand that she could pray and she said from that day on while she ironed brother branham shirts she would pray for him for the meetings for the ministry for god to protect him i tell you in eternity it may take eternity to realize the value of a wife's prayer over her husband did she did he need her to plan an event to have a lady's tea to get the ministering sisters together no he needed that quiet time while she was ironing a shirt praying for him and since then me to begin to pray for everybody sharing shirts for so when she volunteered to do rebecca's ironing for her family it was she was actually going into a ministry of intercessory prayer she wasn't worried about ironing shirts she was praying for everybody's garment of clothes who possessed his garment clothing you think did brother branham ever devalue meeta in any way no he said one time he said you know she never when she was getting when she was sick he was standing in the gap before he said lord you know she's never fussed one time i've been gone months at a time i'm meeting she's never fussed at me i'll come in and just get out from under the pressure i'll go on a hunt and trip her a fishing trip she always has my clothes back she always irons my shirt and she never says one thing about it and then brother brandon says and she wonders how she can serve the lord he says sisters as you serve your husbands you serve the lord that ironing a shirt that packing a bag that not saying anything it was a huge sacrifice for me to husband gone to month tending the children by herself that's how she got in trouble she was frustrated keeping the children while her husband was gone and said something sharp to brother branham slammed the door in his face and none of us would blame her but over and over silently stood by his side took what came i'd say she did exactly what she was supposed to do she was worried in herself i'm not like these other women they do this they do that they they they put together a tea they plan their husbands events they keep their husbands scheduled but i wonder how many of them stopped and prayed for his ministry which has greater value see sometimes we human beings we tend to gravitate towards the thing that gets noticed planning the the tea or having all the ministering sisters over it gets noticed i plan this i'm a good pastor's wife i'm a good minister's wife i play in this i did this and we had a ladies bible study and did this and sometimes all your husband needs all god wants you to do is iron that shirt and pray for your husband stay in your post of duty stay in your calling a mother who will clean home so her children are raised in a clean home and pray for her kids pray with her kids take the time just to stop take the time to be what god called her to be not try to be a mom the mom's not enough the world doesn't put enough value on mom i need to be a mom plus something else to have value in my life tell me what's greater value than raising a baby who can put greater value on that a father who goes to work every day and works so that he can provide for his family and all he does is go to work and come home but when he comes home he's got a happy wife and happy children they come to church holding hands and smiling you think that brother is not serving god i say he's serving god because when that family walks in the back door this church or walks into a walmart or goes and sits down and the kids are well behaved and they're happy and they talk to one another there's no phones on the table there's no games and a man shows his wife respect and a wife honors and reverences her husband and they truly love one another and they look at each other still with a spark in their eye and you can see the love and you can see the family you can see the harmony you know what the world sees jehovah the self-existing one who reveals himself god doesn't need all our efforts and all our this and that he just needs us to do what he's called us to do there's nothing wrong with with planning a this or that or having a fellowship those sometimes are the thing that god needs us to do sometimes god needs us to bring the people together sometimes god and he's called you to do that there's people here that are great at hosting families putting families together hosting people to have great fellowship there's people who are great at playing that's your gift that you're calling but don't ever feel like that what god has called me to do and what's in my hand isn't enough that sort of thinking doesn't come from god whatever god's put in your hand do it with your whole heart and if he wants you to do something else he'll give it to you he'll put it in your hand he was faithful in the least he'll be faithful and much but if we're not faithful in the least will we be faithful and much don't ever don't ever let the devil tell you that you're not doing something for the kingdom of god because i don't have a title i don't have an official church title there's some people that have had official church titles before they haven't done nothing for the kingdom of god but they were called a pastor or a minister an evangelist or a deacon and they didn't do a thing for the glory of god every step we take and every move we make be for him and not us let's just surrender ourselves to him and let's cry out for preeminence not a position not a work not a i'll feel good i'll tell you something right now friends it doesn't matter what position you move into it will never bring a satisfaction brother branham in 1960 he's laying on his bed with his hands behind his head meditating he says well you're already 50 years old he says if you're going to do something for the lord you better start now do you think brother ben felt secure because he had had a worldwide ministry he felt satisfied he was ready for retirement he was done no those things never bring satisfaction to a believer the only thing brings satisfaction to believers that i'm doing all that he called me to do there's no settling down there's no achievement there's no getting to a certain station in life and plateauing there's always a desire of god what do you want now what's pleasing to you now what do you want me to do for you now if brother branham went through that do you think becoming a deacon will all of a sudden answer all your questions and now you'll never wonder anymore no sir do you think moving into this or getting asked that no you're always a christian is always going to be tore up all the time wanting to please the lord there's no arrival there's no achievement the only achievement is preeminence i say god have your way with me and make me a word brother a word sister a word member of the local body make me a word daddy a word mommy a word grandma a word and whatever god's called you to do you become the expression of christ in that thing and you know what you're going to find you're going to find yourself moving into adoption and not even realizing what's happening god before the foundation of the world he already knew what his works would be he's called us in christ jesus unto good works and he's ordained that we should walk in them what we need to do is just keep walking and be faithful in what he's given us to do let's all stand now i'm going to have an altar call may the lord may the lord deal with us each one in our hearts may the lord may this today be answering questions moving away fears moving away scares if we could just relax and say i'm all that god wants me to be if there's another place for me you'll move me to that place whatever you do whatever you do be the self-existing one who's revealing himself let god have preeminence let's bow our heads before we do sister bondo if you want to go around back yeah blandine if you want to move around back here with any of your family like to go with you they can come with you and one of the deacons will be back there to help you let's pray lord jesus we thank you god for your mercy and your grace to us we thank you for your goodness lord god as we move into this subject of adoption i pray that you'd make it real to us make it so simple lord lord the devil would make it complicated he would put things out of our reach and set goals that aren't yours and bring doubts about ourselves that aren't from you god i pray right now you begin to speak to every heart lord every mother every father every man every woman every single every grandparent wherever we find ourselves in life whether with a ministry or with a work whatever it is lord let us surrender in a greater way to you let us die to self in all strife and vain glory let us be happy with the portion that you've given us lord when you divided out the nation to israel ephraim had a portion and god had a portion and naftali had a

not to complain for you've designated a portion in your body for us a part of the word for us to manifest a section of scripture for us to make alive in our lives let us not grumble or complain or devalue what you hold so dear by asking for something else but help us lord to be faithful in what you put in our hands whatever it is may your word take preeminence maybe do it by your word according to your word the way you would do it on this earth may we as believers in this last time be jehovah on earth the self-existent one who's become a family who's revealed himself and individuals come

this is the day this is the hour and you're predestinated to it whatever part big or small if you want to call it big or small whatever label it doesn't matter you're part of the expression of jesus christ and bridefold no matter i don't care what title you can give we can say exhortation helps or work so we can find a title in the bible and you can try to draw identification out of that title that title is not your identity your identity is the bride of jesus christ misses jesus christ tell me what title could supersede mrs jesus christ it's the greatest title that's ever been expressed on this earth that's who i am that's what i am that's my expression and if he wants to express that in some office or some position that's fine but there's no greater title than mrs jesus christ we can enjoy that and enjoy that and be thankful for that god bless you brother ben it's not entirely untrusting it's not in running but in resting it's not in one [Music] [Music] [Music] but in [Music]

sunday god spoke in a certain way that pricked her heart and she knew it was god calling her and afterwards we were able to talk and she explained to me what was going on and i went right through the scriptures in acts chapter 2 and and i showed blandine i said this is you and i watched as her lies lit up she realized she found herself in the scriptures when they heard the word they were pricked in their heart say what must we do peter said repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the mission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and when we went through that i saw the expression i saw her light up i saw her realize i am living out the bible in my life amen and we get to be participants of that as a body of christ we get to see this and we're encouraged by it meant blending because you love the lord because he's called you and you've responded to that call it's my joy to baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ dear lord jesus i

of the enemy every tactic of the devil may you expose it lord may she grow in your word may she grow in your likeness may you fill our lord with the baptism of the holy ghost according to your promise in the word may she be able to open her heart and receive you lord and experience you in a life-changing way god may you walk in her and through her and use her for your glory every day of her life in
