[5:31] bow our heads
[5:33] lord jesus we thank you
[5:35] we thank you lord for the privilege of
[5:37] gathering again
[5:39] lord as we so often say that mean it
[5:41] from our hearts lord
[5:43] we consider it a grand privilege and may
[5:45] it never become a tradition lord
[5:47] but it may it always have meaning and
[5:49] purpose in our hearts and when we come
[5:51] each time with expectation lord to hear
[5:53] from you
[5:55] god may you find welcome lord and our
[5:58] hearts and in our lives and our singing
[5:59] and our praises may it all be gloried
[6:02] and honored to your name lord
[6:04] god as we look into your word we pray
[6:06] you would come and break the bread of
[6:07] life to us and that you would feed us of
[6:09] your own hand
[6:10] one that you'd be pleased with all
[6:12] that's said and that we may grow to be
[6:14] more like you word by word we ask it in
[6:17] jesus christ's name
[6:19] amen
[6:20] and god bless you while we're standing
[6:23] we could take our bibles and turn to the
[6:25] book of jonah
[6:26] i'm going to continue on i believe for
[6:29] one more service
[6:30] from where we were on sunday
[6:34] but i give it a different title i'd like
[6:36] to call it the open book of life
[6:39] and we'll look into that for a few
[6:40] minutes but we'll begin here in jonah
[6:45] jonah chapter 3
[6:48] and verse 10.
[6:52] and god saw their works that they turned
[6:54] from their evil way and god repented of
[6:56] the evil that he had said that he would
[6:58] do unto them and he did it not as we
[7:00] know from sunday this was nineveh jonah
[7:03] went and cried out against nineveh as
[7:05] the lord had told him to and they
[7:06] repented in sackcloth and ashes and here
[7:08] it says they repented of the evil that
[7:10] and god repented of the evil that he
[7:12] said that he would do unto them and he
[7:14] did it not so god sent jonah to preach a
[7:17] message unto them to cry out against it
[7:20] and cry out that there was a judgment
[7:21] coming in 40 days and when they repented
[7:24] in sackcloth and ashes then god repented
[7:26] of the evil that he said that he would
[7:28] do and he did it not in chapter 4 verse
[7:31] 1 but it displeased jonah exceedingly
[7:34] and he was very angry
[7:36] and he prayed unto the lord and said i
[7:37] pray thee o lord was not this my saying
[7:40] when i was yet in my country therefore i
[7:43] fed i fled before and before unto
[7:46] tarshish for i knew that thou art a
[7:48] gracious god and merciful slow to anger
[7:52] and of great kindness and repentancy
[7:55] of the evil
[7:57] praise god
[8:00] jonah's complaint
[8:02] is my refuge and my comfort amen god
[8:05] bless you as you seated
[8:08] and then jonah had ought against them in
[8:11] nineveh he had a wrong attitude about
[8:14] them obviously he wanted them destroyed
[8:16] he didn't want their repentance to bring
[8:19] god's mercy
[8:21] upon them so he he was angry exceedingly
[8:25] amen
[8:26] he was displeased and exceedingly he was
[8:28] very angry but but what he was telling
[8:31] god was god i didn't want to come here
[8:33] because i knew
[8:35] i knew that you are a gracious god and
[8:37] merciful slow to anger and of great
[8:40] kindness and repentancy of the evil
[8:43] praise be to god that's the attributes
[8:46] in god that i'm thankful for tonight
[8:48] amen that he was gracious with me he's
[8:51] merciful that he slow to anger with me
[8:53] that he that he repented of the evil
[8:55] that i deserve amen but i thank god for
[8:58] that amen i want to take a look here at
[9:01] a quote uh two quotes here one from
[9:04] faith once delivered to the saints from
[9:05] 1957. brother brennan said christ will
[9:08] come
[9:10] he will be the judge but before he can
[9:11] bring judgment he has to offer mercy to
[9:14] be a just god and if he offers mercy and
[9:17] mercy is spurn then there's nothing left
[9:19] but judgment and you'll and you've
[9:22] judged yourself by rejecting him don't
[9:24] reject him anymore
[9:27] so brother graham's telling us that
[9:28] there's a principle with god that he
[9:30] will bring mercy before he brings
[9:32] judgment and he and he doesn't call man
[9:34] to judgment without first giving him a
[9:35] warning
[9:37] but god now comes and now nineveh is
[9:40] going to be judged but he sends
[9:42] a message of judgment through
[9:45] jonah but when jonah preaches this
[9:46] message of judgment they repent and they
[9:48] receive mercy and we know later they
[9:51] they go back on that they turn back and
[9:53] there in the book of nahum they're
[9:54] destroyed but god is a merciful god and
[9:57] god brings doesn't bring man to judgment
[9:59] without first giving him a warning and
[10:02] giving him an opportunity of mercy
[10:04] so man amen man condemns himself by
[10:07] rejecting god's mercy
[10:09] and the message is the token brother bam
[10:11] said he had done all these things and
[10:14] yet they still desired not to repent or
[10:16] to believe the message of the day they
[10:18] still didn't want to do it although it
[10:20] had been displayed before them and had
[10:22] been surely made known and when you see
[10:24] such things take place it is a sign of
[10:26] oncoming judgment judgment will follow
[10:28] those things it always done it and this
[10:31] won't be no exception see judgment
[10:33] follows grace when mercy is spurned
[10:35] there's nothing left but judgment so it
[10:37] will always follow it
[10:40] amen god is gracious god is merciful god
[10:44] is slow to anger amen and god amen it's
[10:47] all of these wonderful things but he is
[10:50] also a god of justice and a god of
[10:52] judgment so he must remain a god of
[10:54] justice and a god of judgment and a god
[10:56] full of grace and a god who's
[10:58] merciful amen it takes a perfect
[11:01] character to be able to pull all of this
[11:02] off at the same time
[11:04] god will never god will never uh
[11:08] diminish his justice his his law of
[11:12] justice to be merciful and he'll never
[11:14] forsake mercy for justice somehow god
[11:17] can keep it all in perfect balance amen
[11:20] and he's perfect always in his judgment
[11:23] perfect in his justice he's always
[11:24] righteous yet he's always gracious and
[11:26] he's always merciful
[11:29] i say i i love serving a god whose
[11:32] character is perfect amen and this bible
[11:34] is such a display of his character
[11:37] if you can turn with me to daniel
[11:39] chapter 7
[11:41] i want to start looking at judgment and
[11:43] we're going to focus on the white throne
[11:45] judgment
[11:47] for a little space of time here
[11:49] the book of daniel chapter 7
[11:55] and i'm going to
[11:56] very much so try to take my time
[11:59] not take a long time but just go slow
[12:01] and teach
[12:02] this evening
[12:05] daniel chapter 7 verse 9.
[12:10] and i beheld till thrones were cast down
[12:12] and the ancient of days did sit whose
[12:14] garment was white as snow and the hair
[12:16] of his head like pure wool his throne
[12:18] was like the fiery flame in his wheels
[12:20] as burning fire
[12:22] a fiery stream issued and came forth
[12:24] from before him thousand thousands
[12:27] ministered unto him and ten thousand
[12:29] times ten thousand stood before him the
[12:31] judgment was set and the books were open
[12:34] so brother branham ties this to the
[12:35] white throne judgment and showing that
[12:38] that thousand thousands ministered unto
[12:40] him and brother benham said that's his
[12:42] bride for who ministers to a man but his
[12:45] wife and so the bride is in judgment
[12:47] with him ministering unto him thousand
[12:50] thousands ministered unto him and ten
[12:52] thousand times ten thousand stood before
[12:54] him the judgment was set and the books
[12:57] were open i think it's important to note
[12:59] when we come to this judgment the books
[13:01] were open so it's a it's an open book
[13:04] judgment there's nothing hidden in this
[13:06] judgment nothing now a secret amen
[13:08] everything is completely open when we
[13:10] come to the white throne judgment so
[13:12] there is there is nothing that we will
[13:15] ever keep hidden or keep secret from god
[13:19] let's go over to revelation chapter 20.
[13:28] we can hide all of our life
[13:30] but there's no hiding at the whiteton
[13:32] judgment
[13:38] revelation chapter 20
[13:42] verse 11
[13:45] and i saw a great white throne and him
[13:48] that sat on it from whose face to earth
[13:51] and the heaven fled away
[13:53] and there was found no place for them
[13:55] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[13:58] before god and the books were open
[14:00] and another book was opened which is the
[14:02] book of life
[14:03] so now we've got books that are opened
[14:05] and the book of life is open at this
[14:08] white throne judgment
[14:09] and let's let's read that again and i
[14:11] saw the dead small and great stand
[14:13] before god amen this is not a judgment
[14:16] that the bride will ever go to amen this
[14:18] is not a judgment for the seed of god
[14:20] because the seed of god has bypassed
[14:22] judgment they will now not come to
[14:24] condemnation or the judgment they
[14:26] already have eternal life amen this is
[14:28] the judgment of the dead those without
[14:30] eternal life
[14:32] amen because the the bride the elect of
[14:36] god are not dead they're living amen and
[14:38] when they pass on they're sleeping
[14:41] but this is everybody else outside of
[14:43] the elect predestinated seed of god who
[14:45] will stand in judgment and everybody
[14:48] else will stand in this judgment and it
[14:50] says then i saw the dead small and great
[14:52] stand before god and the books were
[14:54] opened and another book was opened which
[14:56] is the book of life and the dead were
[14:58] judged out of those things which were
[15:00] written in the books according to their
[15:02] works
[15:03] i think this is very interesting this
[15:06] judgment is a judgment that has to do
[15:08] with their works amen that's why the
[15:10] book of life is open and other books are
[15:13] open
[15:14] this is really interesting because
[15:16] they're judged based off their works
[15:18] amen but the bride is not going to be
[15:20] amen she's not going to come into
[15:22] condemnation she's not going to be
[15:23] judged between life and death based off
[15:25] of her works amen she's received life by
[15:28] faith
[15:28] she's a gift of faith and by faith she
[15:30] has eternal life amen and so it's her
[15:33] judgment she will come to a judgment a
[15:35] judgment of rewards coming into the
[15:37] millennium amen in that judgment of
[15:38] rewards is based off what she did in
[15:40] life amen but it's never a judgment of
[15:43] condemnation ever
[15:45] and then it's a judgment of rewards here
[15:47] is a judgment between life and death
[15:50] amen between those who will enter in and
[15:52] those who will go to the lake of fire
[15:53] and it's amazing to note that the books
[15:55] were open and the book of life were open
[15:58] and they were judged out of those things
[16:00] which were written in the books
[16:02] according to their works
[16:06] and the sea gave up the dead which were
[16:07] in it and the death and hell delivered
[16:09] up the dead which were in them and they
[16:11] were judged every man according to their
[16:13] works this is the second time it's
[16:15] mentioned according to their works and
[16:17] death and hell were cast into the lake
[16:19] of fire this is the second death and
[16:22] whosoever was not found written in the
[16:23] book of life was cast into the lake of
[16:27] fire
[16:28] and let's turn back to matthew 25 this
[16:31] is the third scripture i want to read in
[16:34] reference to the white throne judgment
[16:38] because brother benham also tells us
[16:40] that this is the white throne judgment
[16:50] matthew 25
[16:57] and verse 31
[17:02] when the son of man shall come in his
[17:04] glory and all the holy angels with him
[17:06] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[17:08] glory and before him shall be gathered
[17:10] all nations and he shall separate them
[17:12] one from another as a shepherd divided
[17:15] his sheep from the goats
[17:16] and he shall set the sheep on his right
[17:18] hand but the goats on his left on the
[17:20] left
[17:22] now we've got in this judgment we've got
[17:25] some categories of people we've got
[17:27] before the throne a gathering of people
[17:30] all the nations are gathered and they're
[17:31] going to be separated as a shepherd
[17:34] separates his sheep from his goats amen
[17:36] and then you've got the lord on the
[17:38] throne but he's going to start issuing
[17:40] out amen either condemnation or or
[17:44] salvation based off what they did and
[17:47] let's let's let's keep reading that and
[17:48] we'll comment on it in a minute
[17:52] verse 33 and he shall set the sheep on
[17:54] his right hand but the goats on the left
[17:57] then shall the king say unto them on his
[17:59] right hand come ye blessed of my father
[18:01] inherit the kingdom prepared for you
[18:03] from the foundation of the world
[18:05] for i was a hungered and you gave me
[18:07] meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink
[18:10] i was a stranger and you took me in
[18:12] naked and you clothed me i was sick and
[18:15] you visited me i was in prison and you
[18:17] came unto me
[18:19] then shall the righteous answer him
[18:20] saying lord when saul we thee a hungered
[18:23] and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee
[18:25] drink
[18:26] when saw we thee a stranger and took the
[18:29] inn or naked and clothed thee or when
[18:31] saw we the sick or in prison and came
[18:34] unto thee
[18:35] and the king shall answer and say unto
[18:37] them verily i say unto you in so much as
[18:39] you have done it unto one of the least
[18:41] of these my brethren you have done it
[18:44] unto me
[18:45] then shall he say also unto them on the
[18:47] left hand depart from me you cursed into
[18:50] everlasting fire prepared for the devil
[18:52] and his angels
[18:54] for i was hungred and you gave me no
[18:56] meat i was thirsty and you gave me no
[18:58] drink i was a stranger and you took me
[19:00] not in naked and you clothed me not sick
[19:03] and in prison and you visited me nom
[19:05] then shall they also answer him saying
[19:07] lord when saw we thee a hungered or a
[19:10] thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or
[19:12] in prison and did not minister unto thee
[19:15] then shall he answer them saying verily
[19:17] i say unto you insomuch as you did it
[19:19] not to one of the least of these you did
[19:21] it not to me
[19:23] and these shall go away unto everlasting
[19:25] punishment but the righteous into life
[19:28] eternal
[19:30] so here at the white throne judgment
[19:33] christ is here dividing
[19:35] as sheep from goats and and he's
[19:38] separating them based off what they did
[19:41] to him
[19:43] that they were judged according to their
[19:46] works
[19:48] one group had done service unto him had
[19:51] fed him when he was hungry clothed him
[19:52] was naked visited him when he was in
[19:54] prison and when one group had done that
[19:56] but they didn't know that they were
[19:58] doing it to him they were they were
[20:00] ignorant of the fact amen that they were
[20:02] serving the lord and they said when did
[20:05] we do these things unto you and he said
[20:07] it when you did it to the least of these
[20:09] mine brethren so you see there's another
[20:11] mystery group embedded in matthew 25 and
[20:14] the mystery group is these my brethren
[20:17] and he's not talking about the ones
[20:19] separated as sheep or those separated
[20:21] from goats there's a whole nother
[20:23] category of people here in matthew 25
[20:26] that are these and my brethren and you
[20:28] have to say where are your brethren they
[20:30] tell us in the book of daniel amen and
[20:32] thousand times thousands ministered to
[20:34] him were on the throne with him it was
[20:36] his bride amen it was the elect
[20:38] predestinated seed that were seated with
[20:40] him on his throne
[20:43] and he said when you did it unto these
[20:45] my brethren you did it unto me. that's
[20:48] why this is this is not
[20:51] i mean
[20:53] sometimes with a denominational
[20:54] mentality we get the we get the thinking
[20:57] or the attitude if we if we start a
[20:59] clothing drive for the poor and we start
[21:02] amen feeding the poor and we start a
[21:04] food bank amen we'll ensure amen that we
[21:07] get a better judgment amen but only if
[21:10] you clothe christ
[21:11] [Music]
[21:14] only if you're feeding christ amen
[21:17] you could be feeding a lot of people
[21:18] that aren't his brethren that's not what
[21:20] they received entrance into eternal life
[21:22] for but it was when they fed him amen
[21:24] when they clothed him when they visited
[21:26] him amen
[21:28] so you take if we take the
[21:29] denominational idea the denominational
[21:32] idea is amen god says amen that if if we
[21:35] feed the poor and if we clothe the naked
[21:37] we do it unto him that is not
[21:40] necessarily true
[21:42] that's why the denominational idea amen
[21:45] will never ever comprehend the nature of
[21:48] god amen how can god amen grant you
[21:52] entrance into eternal life amen because
[21:54] you took clothes and you gave clothes to
[21:56] just any person any body of flesh that
[21:58] was walking out of there no they're
[22:00] granted eternal life because they gave
[22:02] him clothes when he was naked
[22:05] they gave the they gave the person of
[22:07] life himself clothes when he was naked
[22:10] food when he was hungry hey listen when
[22:13] jesus christ amen oh praise be to god
[22:16] when jesus christ is just in his
[22:18] heavenly form he's never hungry he's
[22:20] never naked he's never in prison but
[22:23] it's only when he's in a body of flesh
[22:25] that he can be naked or in prison or
[22:27] hungry
[22:30] so they couldn't do it to jesus amen as
[22:33] as the great savior on high dwelling in
[22:36] the heavenly realms they can only do
[22:39] these acts these works that are written
[22:40] in the book amen that will grant them
[22:42] life everlasting they can only do it as
[22:45] christ is manifest in flesh and when
[22:48] christ is manifest in flesh amen then he
[22:51] can be naked then he could be hungry
[22:53] then he could be poor then he can need a
[22:55] visit
[22:58] praise god
[23:00] amen
[23:02] so it's not a food drive
[23:05] it's not a clothing drive
[23:08] it's serving christ when christ is
[23:10] manifest in flesh
[23:14] amen
[23:15] do we see that
[23:18] brother branham says in the sardinian
[23:19] church age book and i'm referencing
[23:21] several quotes out of the church age
[23:23] book from the sardisian church age and
[23:26] it'd be good for you to go back and read
[23:27] this if you've got the church age book
[23:29] if you've got one of the blue ones it's
[23:30] a huge section that brother benham takes
[23:33] on this book of life and he breaks it
[23:34] down so thoroughly and then it's between
[23:37] pages 266 and 286 20 pages between page
[23:42] 266 and 286 it would be good for you to
[23:45] go back and read it because i'm not
[23:46] going to break down the whole thing but
[23:48] brother banner spends 20 pages in the
[23:49] sardisian church age explaining this so
[23:52] thoroughly amen so that we could
[23:54] understand it
[23:56] here he says
[23:58] on page 277 the first resurrection has
[24:01] nothing to do with second death the
[24:03] first resurrection is when the elect
[24:05] seed of god will resurrect amen in the
[24:07] rapture that's the first resurrection
[24:09] that has nothing to do with the second
[24:10] death there's no chance of coming to
[24:12] second death you'll never condemn the
[24:14] condemnation you'll never come into the
[24:15] judgment
[24:17] that's only for those who are in the
[24:18] second resurrection then that's
[24:20] everybody all the dead
[24:23] come up after the thousand years and are
[24:25] judged
[24:26] the first resurrection has nothing to do
[24:28] with the second death that is at the end
[24:30] of the thousand years when all the rest
[24:32] of the dead live again and in that day
[24:35] there will be those who come forth to
[24:36] eternal life and those others who are
[24:39] caught in the second death
[24:40] now we do not need to guess about those
[24:42] who
[24:43] those who in the second resurrection are
[24:45] given life we are told it is given to
[24:48] them on the ground that they have been
[24:49] kind and good to the brethren
[24:51] those who are raised and cast into the
[24:53] lake of fire will be so treated because
[24:55] of their mistreatment of the brethren
[24:58] since this is the word of god we simply
[25:00] accept it there is no argument here just
[25:02] a simple statement of fact
[25:05] i wish it was that easy for everybody
[25:07] amen we just accept it as fact
[25:11] to further clarify notice specifically
[25:13] the words of matthew 25
[25:15] 31-46 it does not say that a shepherd is
[25:18] literally separating sheep from goats
[25:21] but it is as and this is capitalized yes
[25:23] it has a shepherd dividing sheep from
[25:26] goats these are not sheep in the
[25:28] particular area of time white throne
[25:30] judgment the sheep are in his fold they
[25:33] heard his voice word and they followed
[25:34] him they already have eternal life and
[25:37] cannot come into the judgment this is an
[25:39] important distinguishing that jesus is
[25:41] making because if we go to matthew 25
[25:44] and try to apply it to all the scripture
[25:46] amen when jesus is talking about my
[25:48] sheep hear my voice and other than not
[25:50] follow when you think these are jesus
[25:52] sheep you find yourself thinking that
[25:54] the elect predestinated are there in
[25:55] this judgment but they are not these are
[25:57] not sheep the sheep have already been
[25:59] gathered into the fold
[26:01] but he's separating as a shepherd it's
[26:03] an analogy it's a tide as a shepherd
[26:05] which separates sheep from goats this is
[26:07] how he's separating two groups of people
[26:09] but these are not the sheep of god
[26:15] amen
[26:17] but these do but he says
[26:20] i'll read this again the sheep are in
[26:22] his fold they heard his voice word and
[26:23] they followed him
[26:25] they heard his voice word what was his
[26:27] voice the word amen
[26:29] what word the word for your day is the
[26:31] voice of god calling you
[26:35] and they followed him they already have
[26:37] eternal life and cannot come into the
[26:39] judgment
[26:41] but these do not have eternal life and
[26:43] they are in the judgment they are
[26:45] allowed to go into eternal life
[26:48] they do not have eternal life
[26:52] that's why they're in the judgment
[26:55] if they had eternal life they wouldn't
[26:56] be in the judgment they would have been
[26:59] part of the first resurrection
[27:01] but because they're in the judgment they
[27:03] cannot have eternal life
[27:08] praise god brother benham is so clear on
[27:11] this
[27:14] but upon what grounds do they enter into
[27:16] life eternal certainly not upon the fact
[27:18] that they already have his life as does
[27:20] the bride but they receive it because
[27:22] they were kind to his brethren
[27:24] they are already
[27:26] sorry they are not his brethren that
[27:28] would make them joint heirs with jesus
[27:30] they are not heirs to anything but life
[27:32] they share no throne etc with them their
[27:34] names must have been in the book of life
[27:36] and not removed now because of their
[27:39] love of the people of god they are
[27:41] recognized and saved no doubt these
[27:44] served and helped the children of god
[27:46] perhaps like nicodemus and gamaliel they
[27:48] stood for the children in a time of
[27:50] trouble
[27:52] if this seems the smack of restoration
[27:54] restoration is god will restore everyone
[27:56] in the end that's not what he's saying
[27:59] if this seems the smack of restoration
[28:01] watch carefully now for the wicked are
[28:03] not restored but turned into the lake of
[28:06] fire
[28:07] the names of many of those destroyed
[28:09] were in the book of life also but they
[28:11] were blotted out because they failed to
[28:14] honor the people of god who were the
[28:16] living manifested word living epistles
[28:20] for their day
[28:24] jesus said when i was hungry you fed me
[28:28] when i was naked you cloned me
[28:32] enter into the joys of the lord now
[28:33] listen
[28:34] enter into the jewish lord prepared the
[28:37] kingdom prepared before the foundation
[28:38] of the world
[28:40] if you think about what's being said
[28:43] that when god in his great mind knew
[28:47] that he was going to come down he had a
[28:49] plan because we had a lamb slain before
[28:51] the foundation of the world so god
[28:53] foresaw a fall
[28:55] because he had a lamb slain before the
[28:57] foundation of the world so before there
[28:59] was a fall there was a lamb slain if
[29:01] there's a lamb slain god fore knows
[29:02] there'll be a fall god foresault amen
[29:05] his plan of redemption he foresaw the
[29:07] plan of himself coming down amen and
[29:11] coming down and manifesting himself
[29:13] through six six thousand years of time
[29:15] amen so that he could display his
[29:17] characteristics so that he could display
[29:19] his attributes amen so that he could so
[29:21] that he could become a tangible god who
[29:24] can be felt who can be touched amen and
[29:26] all of his attributes would come into
[29:28] expression and all of his
[29:29] characteristics would be expressed in
[29:31] this time amen and he would redeem back
[29:34] himself
[29:36] to be a family upon the earth
[29:39] but when god foresaw that
[29:42] he foresaw also times when he would be
[29:45] naked hungry
[29:49] are you catching this when he foresaw
[29:52] his the journey of the predestination of
[29:54] zoe life of eternal life of the life of
[29:56] god of the manifestation of christ down
[29:58] through 6 000 years of time he also
[30:01] foresaw times of need
[30:04] times of hunger times of nakedness times
[30:08] of destitution times of imprisonment he
[30:10] also forced all that amen so when he had
[30:13] when when he was let's just say writing
[30:15] the last book of life because i don't
[30:16] believe god wrote it
[30:19] it was in his mind
[30:21] i don't believe he had to write it out
[30:23] like a writer writes a story amen god in
[30:25] his thinking he foresaw the whole plan
[30:28] it was all real to him and the thoughts
[30:30] of god and when he saw these attributes
[30:32] coming down and he saw need amen he
[30:35] would also foresee a provision to meet
[30:38] that need
[30:43] amen
[30:44] and the provision would be in the book
[30:46] of life
[30:51] praise god
[30:52] they didn't have life
[30:54] they were not part of him
[30:57] they were not his attributes
[30:59] but when he foresaw amen himself coming
[31:03] down through the stream of time he
[31:05] foresaw areas of need and need of
[31:07] support and times amen when we would
[31:10] need people to to step in and do things
[31:13] to keep the program moving so god also
[31:15] foresaw other individuals who would come
[31:18] on the scene at that time and to support
[31:20] and to help amen and to move the program
[31:23] of god along so god also foreknown he
[31:26] also predestinated helps
[31:33] hey amen
[31:35] talk about a wonderful god talk about a
[31:38] wonderful plan
[31:41] and these helps if they would aid the
[31:44] life of god as it was moving down
[31:46] through and progress the plan of god and
[31:49] move the plan forward and keep moving
[31:51] the word forward and keep helping the
[31:52] word as it moves forward they would
[31:55] receive entrance into the kingdom of god
[31:57] into eternal life for their support for
[32:00] their works because when they come to
[32:01] this white throne judgment they're
[32:03] they're judged based off the things that
[32:05] are written in the book
[32:07] one the in the book of life there's only
[32:09] there's only one thing written in the
[32:10] book of life that's names
[32:13] and if their name's not there they go to
[32:15] the lake of fire if their name is still
[32:17] there at the white turn judgment they go
[32:19] into the kingdom so what are these other
[32:21] books for
[32:24] because we have the book of life and
[32:25] when we come time to the book of life
[32:27] amen the section of the book of life
[32:29] that's the lamb's book of life which is
[32:31] the record of the seed of christ that's
[32:33] already sitting on the throne with him
[32:35] so now he's opening the book of life
[32:37] amen for the part that's not the
[32:39] predestinated elect seed
[32:41] for the rest of those that are in the
[32:43] book of life and if your name is still
[32:45] there
[32:46] you go into life if your name is not
[32:49] there
[32:50] you go to the lake of fire
[32:52] so what are the other books
[32:54] this is just brother chad i may be wrong
[32:57] but i believe those other books based
[32:59] off what we read in the prophet said i
[33:00] believe those other books are god's
[33:03] justification for his judgment
[33:08] what would be in those books
[33:10] when i was hungry you fed me
[33:13] when i was naked you clothed me
[33:17] when did we do these things right here
[33:20] in the book amen when i was 1000 bc
[33:26] amen
[33:27] 20 21
[33:29] when i was walking in flesh i had a need
[33:32] and you met that need you support it you
[33:34] defended you protected you did whatever
[33:36] it was that the book said you did and
[33:38] this is my justification for my judgment
[33:44] amen
[33:47] why else would we need other books
[33:50] and they're judged out of the things
[33:52] written in the books not the book the
[33:54] books
[33:55] according to their works
[33:57] what works
[33:59] not that they were just a good daddy and
[34:01] not that they were just honest in their
[34:03] employment but what they did amen
[34:06] according to the program of god and how
[34:08] they helped or hindered the program of
[34:10] god
[34:11] that's the judgment
[34:14] praise be to god
[34:16] let's go to mark chapter 9.
[34:24] like i said i'm going to take my time
[34:26] but i'm not going to take a long time
[34:27] i'm going to try to do something new
[34:29] i'm going to try to preach only one hour
[34:36] don't laugh at me it hurts my feelings
[34:40] mark chapter 9 verse 41.
[34:50] for whosoever shall give you a cup of
[34:52] cold a cup of water to drink in my name
[34:55] i'm sorry let's back up to verse 40.
[34:58] for he that is not against us is on our
[35:01] part for whosoever shall give you a cup
[35:04] of water to drink in my name because you
[35:05] belong to christ verily i say unto you
[35:08] you shall not he shall not lose his
[35:10] reward
[35:12] and whosoever shall offend one of these
[35:14] little ones that believe in me it is
[35:16] better for him that a millstone were
[35:18] hanged about his neck and he were cast
[35:20] into the sea
[35:22] right there is justification for
[35:23] judgment
[35:25] one group if they just so much as give a
[35:27] cup of water to drink in my name because
[35:29] you belong in to christ apparently i say
[35:32] unto you he shall not lose his reward
[35:34] and whosoever shall offend one of these
[35:36] little ones that believe in me it is
[35:38] better for him that a millstone were
[35:39] hanged about his neck and he were cast
[35:41] into the sea amen if you offend you're
[35:44] doomed if you help you can be saved amen
[35:47] let's go to matthew chapter 10.
[35:58] matthew chapter 10 verse 40
[36:03] he that receiveth you receiveth me and
[36:05] he that receiveth me receiveth him that
[36:07] sent me
[36:08] he the receiver of the prophet in the
[36:10] name of a prophet shall receive a
[36:11] prophet's reward
[36:13] and he that receiveth a righteous man in
[36:15] the name of a righteous man receiveth a
[36:17] righteous man's reward
[36:18] and whosoever shall give to drink unto
[36:21] one of these little ones a cup of cold
[36:23] water only in the name of a disciple
[36:25] verily i say unto you he shall in no
[36:28] wise lose his reward
[36:31] this is not giving anybody you come in
[36:33] contact with a cup of water
[36:36] that is one who belongs to christ amen
[36:39] that is one of these little ones and so
[36:42] the this what brother ben is teaching us
[36:44] is not isolated what he's teaching us is
[36:47] throughout the entire scripture in fact
[36:49] what i would like to propose is that
[36:51] what brother benham is teaching here in
[36:53] the sardisian church age he's teaching
[36:56] the very nature and character of god
[36:58] that is throughout this entire bible
[37:00] because this is the way god deals with
[37:02] people all the way through his word amen
[37:05] and god
[37:06] remember he's gracious he's merciful
[37:08] he's slow to anger
[37:10] he is all of these things amen and he
[37:13] always is giving people an opportunity
[37:15] in giving people a chance but when mercy
[37:17] is spurned there's nothing left for
[37:18] judgment
[37:20] now i want to read this quote
[37:22] uh here out of an absolute from 1963 an
[37:26] absolute
[37:28] he said i can see eternity break come
[37:30] down into time since eden
[37:32] and when it did there came a line of
[37:34] blood all the way up unto calvary and
[37:37] from calvary tied with this line and
[37:39] goes on to the typos jesus
[37:41] and someday when he comes to claim his
[37:43] own everyone that's tied to that
[37:45] ultimate will be raised up into eternity
[37:47] why they have been in eternity all the
[37:49] time
[37:50] they were predestinated in eternity they
[37:52] are part of god
[37:54] they were in his thinking at the
[37:56] beginning and when that big rope is
[37:58] pulled of the line of blood that token i
[38:00] was speaking of when it comes up from
[38:02] the earth everyone that was included in
[38:04] that blood will be dropped right up and
[38:07] dropped right up into eternity again but
[38:09] the only way it'll be will be tied to
[38:12] that absolute jesus christ it's absolute
[38:14] not an achievement of man but god raised
[38:17] him up from the dead and he is an
[38:19] absolute and we know he's alive because
[38:21] here he is with us in the power of his
[38:23] resurrection doing the same things he
[38:25] did when he was here on earth
[38:28] he goes down skipping a paragraph down
[38:30] to another one he says it don't make any
[38:32] difference what others want to believe
[38:34] to the individual you're tied to that
[38:37] brother branham patch's bible so he's
[38:38] talking about the bible you're tied to
[38:40] that that's your ultimate that's the
[38:42] last word and then if he's the word then
[38:45] he must be the last word this this must
[38:48] settle it whatever that says that's that
[38:50] scarlet thread
[38:53] that is christ and anything contrary to
[38:55] that i know nothing about him that's
[38:57] what we want to know is what the word
[38:59] says for i am tied to christ and christ
[39:02] is the word you you get it now
[39:04] and the portion of his word that's
[39:06] lauded for this day his holy spirit is
[39:09] here to manifest that portion of the
[39:11] word
[39:11] just like it was back here at his birth
[39:13] isaiah 9 6 all down through the
[39:15] scriptures everything was spoke of him
[39:18] it was fulfilled over in the book of
[39:19] luke we see it he was that he was the
[39:22] end he was the end of the prophecy too
[39:25] of him he fulfilled that the history the
[39:27] songs everything in the old testament
[39:29] that spoke of him it was fulfilled right
[39:31] there
[39:32] that became the ultimate that became the
[39:34] thai post of the word of god for that
[39:36] age
[39:38] amen
[39:39] brother franco can you turn this writing
[39:41] tablet on i'm gonna i'm gonna try to
[39:43] draw some pictures we've got a new
[39:44] writing tablet that i'm gonna try to
[39:46] work with
[39:47] and see if it works
[39:51] okay
[39:52] so i wanna i wanna draw
[39:55] align
[39:57] if i can let's see if i can draw a line
[40:00] i drew a line
[40:03] and then i want to draw a cross right
[40:05] here
[40:15] the mind of god that looks horrible
[40:23] there
[40:25] in the mind of god was the plan of god
[40:27] and he foresaw and and part of god were
[40:30] attributes of god and in the mind of god
[40:33] was the lamb's book of life before the
[40:34] foundation of the world but the section
[40:37] of that lamb
[40:38] section of that book of life was what
[40:40] brother brown calls the lamb's book of
[40:42] life he said it's really it's like it's
[40:44] two books but it's one book it's one
[40:45] book with two sections one section is
[40:48] the zoe life the eternal life the life
[40:50] of god that'll come down through time
[40:52] and the other section is is the the
[40:55] other part of the book of life which we
[40:56] already described it's the part that
[40:59] supports that life
[41:01] and supporting that life
[41:03] it gets the benefit of life
[41:06] that's why it's called the book of life
[41:09] so what makes it the book of life
[41:12] is because part of that book
[41:15] is zoe eternal life
[41:18] and the rest of that book is surrounding
[41:20] that life or supporting that life and
[41:22] because they support that life they have
[41:24] a right to that zoe life
[41:27] they're not part of it but they get
[41:29] access to it they're supporting it so
[41:32] they get the benefit of it amen and
[41:33] that's all contained in the book of life
[41:35] not death but life
[41:39] so in the mind of god is the book of
[41:41] life
[41:46] okay
[41:49] it comes down starts here
[41:53] it comes from god and it goes back to
[41:56] god
[41:58] and
[41:59] on this line
[42:01] we start over here
[42:04] i'm a little off but forgive me
[42:06] it comes down to adam
[42:09] and god brings
[42:12] life down into adam and he and he starts
[42:14] his plan on earth and we know that
[42:16] there's a fall and then god then god
[42:18] gives a blood sacrifice as an atonement
[42:21] for adam to cover for his sins now that
[42:23] blood could never take away it could
[42:26] never take away the sin of adam but it
[42:28] was only making a covering for that and
[42:30] it was foreshadowing the lamb slain
[42:33] before the foundation of the world which
[42:34] would be when god amen brings that zoe
[42:37] life down and that life becomes uh it
[42:40] becomes encompassed or embodied in a
[42:42] mortal man and a mortal life with
[42:43] created blood of god and that blood will
[42:46] be shed amen and that shedding of that
[42:48] blood amen will be an elimination of
[42:50] cleaning taking away of the sin of
[42:52] mankind amen but until then they had to
[42:55] stick with the foreshadowing part
[42:57] because that was the word for their day
[43:00] and what brother benham is telling us in
[43:01] this quote he said the word for your day
[43:04] becomes the ultimate becomes the thai
[43:06] post
[43:08] so i want to read that again
[43:10] he said i am tied to christ and christ
[43:13] is the word
[43:16] and the portion of his word that's
[43:18] lotted for this day
[43:20] so
[43:21] so
[43:22] we we've got to be part of christ part
[43:24] of the word but it's got to be the
[43:26] timepost it's got to be the ultimate but
[43:28] it has to be the portion of that word
[43:30] for that day
[43:32] amen so he goes and he talks about the
[43:35] prophecy that christ fulfilled of isaiah
[43:36] 9 6 and he become he was the fulfillment
[43:39] of the old testament prophecy he was a
[43:41] fulfillment of all the old testament
[43:43] prophecies they were all fulfilled in
[43:45] him all the law all the prophets
[43:47] everything was fulfilled in him amen so
[43:50] he was the word made manifest for that
[43:52] day and in that day he was the ultimate
[43:54] he was the thai post
[43:57] now listen what he says next
[44:00] that became the thai post of the word of
[44:02] god for that age
[44:03] and the real born-again people of this
[44:06] age that's filled with the holy ghost is
[44:09] the thai post of this scripture that's
[44:12] got to be fulfilled in these last days
[44:15] there's a typos today amen and that thai
[44:18] post is christ
[44:20] and what is christ the anointed word
[44:22] that's made manifest in his day what is
[44:24] the portion of the word to be manifest
[44:26] for this day amen it is christ in the
[44:28] formation of a bride a bride
[44:31] manifestation of christ amen that's the
[44:33] word for this day and that's christ amen
[44:37] i think sometimes people get
[44:38] uncomfortable with this kind of
[44:40] conversation because they think we're
[44:41] talking about bodies of flesh amen it's
[44:44] only working through bodies of flesh
[44:45] it's not these bodies of flesh you don't
[44:47] have to be tied to me chad lam as a
[44:50] person i'll fail you a million other
[44:52] ways but i believe by the grace of god
[44:55] there is a portion of zoe life down
[44:56] inside chatham the real chad lamb not
[44:59] the one born of earthly parents but the
[45:01] one that came from the mind of god amen
[45:04] that was predestinated that portion of
[45:06] the word of god was predestinated to
[45:08] come into manifestation in this day
[45:12] and when that word begins to manifest
[45:14] out of this corrupt body of flesh so
[45:16] don't look at the flesh it's not the
[45:18] flesh
[45:19] i think sometimes we start talking about
[45:20] pride manifestation of bride hey i meant
[45:23] christ manifest in bright form we start
[45:25] thinking flash we see the human side and
[45:28] the human side is still failing amen the
[45:30] human side is still flawed
[45:33] we believe by the word it's coming into
[45:34] perfection i'm not what i used to be
[45:36] amen but i'm not what i want to be
[45:39] the word is bringing us into greater
[45:41] manifestation all the time amen but that
[45:44] zoe life down on the inside of that
[45:46] vessel amen is predestinated to be
[45:48] manifest in this day and that
[45:50] manifestation of the word in this day
[45:53] becomes christ in our day becomes the
[45:56] ultimate becomes the thai post
[46:01] so
[46:03] that's why
[46:04] when jesus said
[46:06] i was hungry and you fed me
[46:09] i was naked and you clothed me
[46:12] when he said you did this to my brethren
[46:14] when his brethren were on earth
[46:17] they were they were manifest in all
[46:20] kinds of different bodies
[46:22] of all kinds of shapes and all kinds of
[46:23] sizes and all kinds of temperaments
[46:27] some may have been super likable
[46:28] easygoing and nice some may have been
[46:30] kind of cranky
[46:33] some might have been easy to do for some
[46:35] might have been hard to do for
[46:37] so some i you know you know what i'm
[46:39] saying
[46:41] it wasn't the body of flesh amen it was
[46:44] what was working through that body of
[46:46] flesh
[46:48] and what was inside that vessel amen was
[46:51] a life that come from god that he
[46:52] manifest to be men that he ordained to
[46:55] be manifest at that day and when that
[46:57] word was being made manifest amen when
[46:59] they were supporting that zoe life no
[47:02] matter what kind of vessel it was in
[47:04] when they were supporting it amen they
[47:07] they were supporting life
[47:11] in working with the program of god
[47:14] so we go we go down here a little bit
[47:17] and let's go to noah
[47:21] noah got the word for his day
[47:25] and noah became the manifestation of the
[47:27] word for his day and now salvation in
[47:30] noah's day
[47:32] was tied to noah's message
[47:36] so we've been through this so many times
[47:38] it's so simple amen but but but with a
[47:41] denominational mindset we get so
[47:44] scrupled up
[47:46] brother banham told us he says
[47:48] i just read it but we'll read it again
[47:49] since eden
[47:51] when it did there come a line of blood
[47:53] all the way up to calvary and from
[47:56] calvary
[47:58] tied with this line and goes on to the
[48:00] tie post jesus
[48:02] so there's a bloodline all the way to
[48:04] calvary and all the way from calvary
[48:06] that's why i've drawn this line amen and
[48:09] and when we think about the bloodline we
[48:12] know that at calvary at the cross the
[48:14] blood was shed but brother branham comes
[48:17] in the token and he makes it super clear
[48:19] so we can understand
[48:20] that now we must have not chemical
[48:23] properties of blood because we can no
[48:25] longer get that physical blood and apply
[48:28] that blood to us amen and say that we're
[48:30] under the blood he said that blood went
[48:32] back into the judean soil
[48:35] and when that blood was shed it was
[48:36] dropping and it was purchasing it was
[48:38] the purchasing power it was the
[48:40] purchasing price it was the exchange
[48:43] rate of funds for life he was purchasing
[48:45] back all of creation and redemption a
[48:48] redemption price was paid
[48:51] but but brother bannon said when that
[48:53] when that blood cell was broke the life
[48:55] of the blood was released and now amen
[48:58] we have to receive the life of the blood
[49:00] and that's being covered in the blood
[49:04] and so there's a bloodline that goes
[49:06] from eden to all the way to calvary and
[49:09] from calvary it goes on but i would like
[49:12] to i would like to describe this
[49:14] bloodline as the the blood lifeline
[49:18] the life of that blood which was the
[49:20] life of christ which was the life of god
[49:21] which was the life of the word and it
[49:23] was expressed here in noah
[49:26] what was expressed in noah
[49:28] zoe life
[49:30] god the word of god was expressed in
[49:32] noah and now that word brought salvation
[49:35] in that day
[49:38] and then we
[49:40] then we come down
[49:47] to abraham
[49:51] moses
[49:52] we come to the judges
[49:55] to the
[49:56] kings
[49:58] all the way down to john the baptist
[50:02] and as you come down through each
[50:04] manifestation
[50:06] you realize that it was this part of
[50:09] god's mind this lamb's book of life
[50:13] this zoe life this this life of christ
[50:17] god had foresaw it manifesting itself
[50:20] down through six thousand years and as
[50:22] it came into manifestation
[50:24] every time the word came into
[50:26] manifestation it became the ultimate for
[50:29] that day and it became the thai post in
[50:31] that day
[50:34] so abraham became the time post in that
[50:36] day his message became the typos in that
[50:39] day amen but when we go on from there
[50:42] amen now we cannot no longer hold on
[50:45] that's what brother benham would always
[50:47] say moses couldn't come preaching noah's
[50:49] message
[50:51] because noah's message was the typos in
[50:53] that day it was the manifestation of the
[50:55] life of god and noah's day but as god
[50:58] foresaw himself amen what's he doing
[51:00] he's revealing himself he's letting more
[51:03] of himself out all the time and as god
[51:05] is revealing more of his life he comes
[51:07] down to a manifestation that's going to
[51:09] be in moses's day and now in order to
[51:12] get a hold of the typos you've got to
[51:14] get a hold of the typos when it presents
[51:16] itself in your day
[51:19] you can't be in moses's day hundreds of
[51:22] years
[51:23] or even thousands or more years after
[51:25] noah's day and you can't get a hold of
[51:27] the thai post of noah's day you can't
[51:29] grab a hold of it friends
[51:32] you got to find a place a time a place
[51:35] to grab a hold of the thai post amen and
[51:38] you can't grab a hold of the thai post
[51:40] that was a thousand years before because
[51:42] you can't get a hold of it it's already
[51:44] been now you're standing in your day so
[51:46] what's the typos for your day when the
[51:48] same life that was in noah's message in
[51:51] the same life that was in moses message
[51:53] and the same life that goes all down
[51:55] through when the same life presents
[51:56] itself in your day that becomes the
[51:58] typos you get a hold of that typos when
[52:01] you grab ahold of that typos you are
[52:03] tied into the bloodline
[52:05] [Music]
[52:08] now when jesus christ comes amen and he
[52:11] he lives the perfect life he is
[52:13] everything when you look at this this
[52:16] left side of this line everything that
[52:19] was attached to that line that got a
[52:20] hold of the thai post in their day
[52:22] everything that got a hold of that was
[52:24] part of the life of god was was
[52:26] manifesting
[52:28] christ in their day when it come all the
[52:30] way down through all of that was wrapped
[52:32] up into one man and that man was christ
[52:34] jesus and as he was manifesting he
[52:36] became the typos for that day
[52:40] when he died and shed his blood amen the
[52:42] blood he shed was the blood that
[52:45] contained that life that was expressed
[52:48] and noah and moses and abraham and david
[52:52] and solomon all the way down through
[52:54] when that life was expressed that life
[52:56] was now brought into a body amen and
[52:59] there was created blood amen that that
[53:01] life would be housed in that blood and
[53:03] when the blood cell split the life would
[53:05] be freed to come back on the believer
[53:09] but when that blood shed
[53:14] everything that was attached to the pie
[53:16] post
[53:17] went free
[53:21] they were back under blood of bulls and
[53:23] goats which blood of bulls and goats
[53:25] cannot take away sin it can only cover
[53:28] it
[53:29] but it was the word for their day so
[53:31] they stayed faithful to the word for
[53:32] their day
[53:34] now when all that the law foreshadowed
[53:36] and all the sacrifices foreshadowed was
[53:39] now here in christ and he was the lamb
[53:40] of god and he died the sacrificial life
[53:42] and shed that blood amen amen what was
[53:46] what was what noah was believing was in
[53:48] christ
[53:51] what moses was believing was in christ
[53:54] that's why amen the bible said amen when
[53:57] christ resurrected many of the saints
[53:59] that slept in the ground resurrected
[54:01] with him when that life came up
[54:04] everything that was attached to that
[54:05] bloodline came up with him and
[54:07] resurrected with him
[54:09] why because they you know they weren't
[54:11] there to see jesus dying on the cross
[54:15] they weren't there to stand at the foot
[54:16] of the cross and say i believe this is
[54:18] the word of god
[54:20] noah wasn't there moses wasn't there
[54:23] amen but the life that was there
[54:26] presented itself in a portion of noah's
[54:28] day and noah said that's the truth
[54:30] that's nothing but the truth and i give
[54:32] my whole life to that
[54:34] and in moses day moses comes to another
[54:37] portion of the word that includes adam's
[54:40] day the sacrifice of the lamb that
[54:42] includes salvation and noah's day it's
[54:44] all included still in his day but when
[54:46] he comes to this day and god speaks to
[54:48] him he believes it and he acts on it
[54:50] amen and he gets a hold of the typos in
[54:52] his day and he clamps himself around at
[54:54] that timepost and won't let go
[54:57] and that is a link to that bloodline
[55:02] so when christ amen who was all of that
[55:04] life wrapped up in one
[55:08] shed that blood
[55:10] it freed everybody attached to the
[55:12] bloodline
[55:16] and when he resurrected
[55:18] they resurrected
[55:23] they
[55:24] they didn't even
[55:25] uh they didn't even have to confess
[55:27] beforehand that they believed that he
[55:29] he would be resurrected amen because
[55:31] they believe the portion for their day
[55:33] when the portion for this day manifests
[55:35] they get the benefits of this day
[55:40] so when christ resurrects everything
[55:43] that was attached to that line
[55:45] resurrects with him
[55:49] oh my goodness i was going to try to
[55:50] preach one hour
[55:53] i'm still going to try
[55:55] you bear with me love me anyhow
[56:00] this is a quote that we've been reading
[56:02] quite a bit lately out of crisis the
[56:04] mystery of god revealed
[56:06] he said now you see the seals when he
[56:08] was in his mediator work back there
[56:09] redeeming but someday he comes forth to
[56:11] get this book that that he's redeemed
[56:14] and all that's in the book would be him
[56:17] for that's the believer the words in the
[56:19] book and the word is him
[56:22] so the words in that book of the lamb's
[56:24] book of life that book is him it's
[56:27] christ
[56:28] and the believers are all the words in
[56:29] the book
[56:30] so when christ was on calvary he was the
[56:34] book
[56:36] the book was on calvary
[56:39] and all the words that were in the book
[56:42] had been expressed down through the
[56:43] previous uh 4 000 years
[56:46] is that right
[56:49] and so
[56:50] when the book was on calvary
[56:53] all the words in the book were on the
[56:55] calvary too
[56:57] this is what brother branham said
[57:00] when the word when when all the word was
[57:03] in christ
[57:05] so when when christ was on calvary moses
[57:09] was in christ
[57:11] when when moses was expressing his
[57:14] portion for his day christ was in moses
[57:17] though the prophet said
[57:19] said christ was in noah christ was in
[57:21] moses christ was in david it was all
[57:23] manifesting the life of christ
[57:25] manifesting a portion of that book
[57:28] and now when all that book was here on
[57:30] the cross amen all the words in the book
[57:33] were there amen
[57:35] and so they were there
[57:38] but let's go a little further
[57:41] now we come down
[57:43] we've got peter
[57:45] we've got paul
[57:48] we've got
[57:50] seven church ages
[57:54] all right
[57:54] all the way down through we've got all
[57:56] the church age messengers all the way
[57:57] down through you you know it i won't
[57:59] take the time to write it but when you
[58:01] go all down through there amen
[58:03] when whenever you come in contact let's
[58:06] just say we come down here
[58:09] and we come to luther's dispensation
[58:13] all right
[58:14] we come to luther's dispensation amen
[58:17] you had to believe luther's message
[58:19] because luther's message in his day was
[58:21] that portion of the word to be made
[58:23] manifest in that day
[58:25] and when that word was made manifest in
[58:27] that day it became the thai post it
[58:29] became the link amen that ties you to
[58:31] this bloodline
[58:33] because the bloodline goes up to calvary
[58:35] and from calvary amen
[58:37] and then when we come over here
[58:41] to wesley's dispensation
[58:44] you couldn't say
[58:46] i know luther was right so i'm going to
[58:48] stick with luther i'm not so sure about
[58:50] wesley amen because now god was moving
[58:53] down the line amen the lifeline was
[58:55] moving the word was progressing the
[58:58] manifestation of the book of life was
[59:00] coming more and more into manifestation
[59:02] and now it comes in the wesley under
[59:04] ministry of sanctification amen and to
[59:06] refuse that was to refuse the lifeline
[59:11] because you can't go backwards you can
[59:13] never go backwards and get a hold of the
[59:15] typos you can only get a hold of the
[59:17] thai post in your day
[59:20] and the typo says that portion of the
[59:21] word made manifest to manifest in your
[59:24] day and when you get a hold of that you
[59:26] get a hold of the lifeline
[59:31] amen so now it comes all the way down
[59:33] through we know our day we know all of
[59:34] these things but what we have to realize
[59:37] is is when we get a hold of the lifeline
[59:39] it's when the word is expressed in our
[59:41] day and the word must be expressed in us
[59:45] so when i say get a hold of the lifeline
[59:47] i'm not talking about taking a safety
[59:49] belt and wrapping it around no when i
[59:51] get a hold of the lifeline i receive the
[59:53] word and i become the manifestation of
[59:55] the word
[59:57] so when we look at this bloodline and
[59:59] this lifeline i'm calling the lifeline
[1:00:01] coming all the way down through the life
[1:00:03] of christ amen that life is hidden
[1:00:07] i drew it red and so you can see a red
[1:00:09] line amen but it's a it's a hidden line
[1:00:12] what's hidden i shouldn't i shouldn't
[1:00:14] have drew in line to write the names
[1:00:16] above what i should have done is write
[1:00:17] the names right over top the line
[1:00:20] i should have wrote noah
[1:00:22] abraham moses why because the lifeline
[1:00:26] is hidden underneath noah underneath
[1:00:29] abraham underneath moses underneath amen
[1:00:32] all the judges and underneath the the
[1:00:34] kings and underneath the prophets what
[1:00:36] is it that lifeline is running through
[1:00:38] all those manifestations amen and it's
[1:00:41] hidden because until the end time the
[1:00:43] book was sealed and we couldn't see what
[1:00:46] we needed to see where that lifeline was
[1:00:48] running down through and when we come to
[1:00:50] the end of the church ages there was a
[1:00:52] confusion about who's right and who's
[1:00:54] wrong and denominations and and what we
[1:00:56] we see the mixed bag and the mixed vines
[1:00:59] amen because that lifeline was running
[1:01:00] down through seven church ages
[1:01:04] and it was hidden
[1:01:06] but in the end of time amen god would
[1:01:09] take and open the seals and open the
[1:01:11] book of life and when he opened the book
[1:01:13] of life we saw what was under the names
[1:01:15] amen what was under luther what was
[1:01:17] under wesley what was under pentecost
[1:01:19] what was under all of these things was
[1:01:21] the life of christ coming all the way
[1:01:22] down through it was the blood life it
[1:01:24] was the lifeline it was eternal life
[1:01:29] and now in each age as it presented
[1:01:31] itself
[1:01:32] we got a hold of the life
[1:01:34] in that day
[1:01:37] but i just want to take a quick look at
[1:01:40] just a couple places here
[1:01:42] but i want to show
[1:01:44] off abraham
[1:01:47] there would be people who would interact
[1:01:49] with abraham and abraham was part of
[1:01:51] this lifeline
[1:01:54] but connected to him
[1:01:56] would be people like abimelech
[1:02:00] is that right
[1:02:03] there would also be a connection over
[1:02:05] here to three brothers
[1:02:10] mamrie
[1:02:14] eskel
[1:02:17] and
[1:02:18] aynor these three brothers were in a
[1:02:21] coalition with abraham and they actually
[1:02:23] went with him to help him deliver lot
[1:02:26] they were his friends when he was
[1:02:27] separated on the plains of memory they
[1:02:29] were his friends and they were in a
[1:02:30] coalition with him and they were
[1:02:32] agreement to help one another and when
[1:02:34] he went down to deliver lot
[1:02:36] these three went with him to help him
[1:02:38] deliver lot
[1:02:40] they were connected to abraham
[1:02:43] they may not have been able to be
[1:02:45] connected to the lifeline but they were
[1:02:47] connected to abraham and abraham was
[1:02:49] connected to the lifeline
[1:02:52] and they helped abraham deliver lot
[1:02:57] they were in a coalition or a
[1:02:58] confederation with abraham and they
[1:03:00] helped him and they protected him and
[1:03:02] helped him protect his herds and his
[1:03:03] flocks and in this confederation they
[1:03:05] worked together in conjunction to help
[1:03:06] one another and even abraham when
[1:03:09] abraham when the king of sodom tried to
[1:03:10] give abraham all the goods abraham
[1:03:12] wouldn't take anything amen from the
[1:03:14] king of sodom but he said i won't take
[1:03:17] anything but yet what the young men eat
[1:03:19] and the portion to the three friends of
[1:03:21] mine that went down amen so they were
[1:03:23] blessed under abraham
[1:03:26] because abraham wouldn't take the spoil
[1:03:28] but he allowed a portion of the spoil to
[1:03:30] go to these three friends
[1:03:32] abraham didn't need the spoil he needed
[1:03:34] what melchizedek had and that's the only
[1:03:36] thing he needed communion with
[1:03:37] melchizedek but these three friends
[1:03:39] couldn't come into the same communion
[1:03:41] with melchizedek but they could receive
[1:03:43] a blessing because of abraham
[1:03:47] see when i say brother branham when
[1:03:49] brother branham teaches this it's not an
[1:03:51] isolated this and isolated that this is
[1:03:53] the entire bible friends he's taking
[1:03:55] this concept through the white turn
[1:03:57] judgment from the entire bible
[1:04:00] abimelech was not predestined elected
[1:04:03] seed he was not what abraham was
[1:04:06] but abimelech nonetheless was righteous
[1:04:09] he was just and when abimelech was going
[1:04:11] to do something wrong he was going to
[1:04:13] take sarah he was doing it in ignorance
[1:04:16] he didn't know amen but god came to him
[1:04:19] anyways in a dream and warned him not to
[1:04:21] take that man's wife and he said god you
[1:04:23] know the integrity of my heart you know
[1:04:25] i didn't know
[1:04:26] and he says i know the integrity of your
[1:04:28] heart that's why i warned you in a dream
[1:04:30] so that you would not sin against me
[1:04:35] i thought he was going to sin against
[1:04:36] abraham
[1:04:39] abraham was the word for his day
[1:04:42] if he would have sinned against abraham
[1:04:43] he would have sinned against him because
[1:04:45] there was a word being manifest in
[1:04:47] abraham and that word was abraham would
[1:04:49] have a promised son and brother abraham
[1:04:52] or abraham was to have that promised son
[1:04:55] through sarah his wife that was the
[1:04:57] prophecy that was the word for their day
[1:04:59] when abimelech was going to go in and
[1:05:01] interrupt the word for his day
[1:05:05] god stopped him and said i would not let
[1:05:07] you sin against me
[1:05:11] because abimelech was going to hinder
[1:05:14] the word
[1:05:16] but because he was just god would not
[1:05:19] let him hinder the word so god woke him
[1:05:21] up in a dream and warned him and and had
[1:05:23] a curse upon him
[1:05:26] and told him to have abraham pray for
[1:05:28] him
[1:05:29] and then when abraham he blessed abraham
[1:05:31] and he gave him flocks and he heard and
[1:05:33] told abraham he could live wherever he
[1:05:34] wanted in his land and then abraham
[1:05:36] blessed him when abraham blessed him god
[1:05:38] took the curse away
[1:05:40] see abimelech could not be what abraham
[1:05:42] was
[1:05:45] but because abraham would intercede for
[1:05:47] him because he was righteous god would
[1:05:49] warn him because abraham would intercede
[1:05:51] for him god would bless him
[1:05:54] so he needed abraham
[1:05:57] when he was going to interfere with
[1:05:59] abraham's manifestation he was going to
[1:06:01] interfere with the word and that brought
[1:06:03] a curse
[1:06:06] so
[1:06:07] i want to go over here i don't have time
[1:06:09] to go through very many but we'll go
[1:06:10] over here to paul
[1:06:15] this centurion that paul was put in the
[1:06:18] charge of when he was put on a boat to
[1:06:19] go to caesar
[1:06:21] this centurion was really good to paul
[1:06:25] when paul would go into a city this
[1:06:27] insured and give him liberty to go to
[1:06:29] his friends
[1:06:31] when the soldiers wanted to
[1:06:34] when they got into a storm and it looked
[1:06:35] like we were going to be shipwrecked
[1:06:36] when the soldiers wanted to kill all of
[1:06:38] the prisoners the centurion in order to
[1:06:41] save paul
[1:06:44] forbid them
[1:06:47] this centurion
[1:06:48] could never be what paul was
[1:06:52] but he preserved paul's life
[1:06:55] and he gave paul liberty to continue in
[1:06:57] his ministry
[1:07:00] he let him go visit the brethren when
[1:07:01] they stopped in this city and when they
[1:07:03] stepped this city he let him rent his
[1:07:04] own house amen and stay there for a
[1:07:06] period of time amen and this centurion
[1:07:09] was good to paul he protected paul's
[1:07:11] ministry he protected paul's life and he
[1:07:14] obeyed paul
[1:07:17] when paul come back and said you know
[1:07:20] you should have listened to me and you
[1:07:21] should not have released from the poor
[1:07:22] amen but nonetheless amen god has told
[1:07:25] me by an angel that you'll not no will
[1:07:28] be no loss of life only of the ship
[1:07:31] they all the sailors wanted to get the
[1:07:33] lifeboats out and take off and paul told
[1:07:36] the centurion if they if
[1:07:38] they don't stay with the ship they'll
[1:07:39] die and the centurion told the soldiers
[1:07:41] to go cut the ropes to all the lifeboats
[1:07:43] and let them go
[1:07:45] the centurion was obeying the prisoner
[1:07:52] oh
[1:07:53] praise god
[1:07:56] supporting the ministry protecting the
[1:07:58] life
[1:07:59] working with
[1:08:00] paul
[1:08:04] but there was another man
[1:08:06] in paul's life named demas
[1:08:10] demons
[1:08:11] was a fellow laborer paul calls him a
[1:08:13] fellow labor in the gospel
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:16] demas was a preacher
[1:08:19] demas was a traveling companion to paul
[1:08:21] demas was a friend of paul and a fellow
[1:08:23] minister and they ministered together
[1:08:24] and spread the gospel together
[1:08:27] demas amen would surely have part in the
[1:08:31] book of life he was supporting life he
[1:08:33] was working and laboring in life amen
[1:08:35] but we come to and we come to an epistle
[1:08:37] that paul writes and he says demas has
[1:08:40] forsaken me loving this present world
[1:08:43] and when demas forsook paul
[1:08:48] demas
[1:08:50] had his name blotted off the book of
[1:08:51] life
[1:08:55] because if we look at this line here
[1:09:00] this line
[1:09:02] is the record of life
[1:09:07] eternal life
[1:09:14] eternal life
[1:09:17] this is
[1:09:18] also the word
[1:09:22] it's also the seed
[1:09:24] it's also christ
[1:09:27] you have many names for that line
[1:09:30] it's the life line the record of the
[1:09:32] seed zoe life of god that line is all of
[1:09:36] those things
[1:09:38] and the centurion may not have been
[1:09:40] predestinated to be on that line
[1:09:43] but he could come in contact with paul
[1:09:45] who was on that line and expressing that
[1:09:47] life
[1:09:49] and he could support and help in a time
[1:09:51] when paul would need his support and
[1:09:53] need his help
[1:09:55] is that right
[1:09:57] if that centurion wasn't there what
[1:09:59] would happen to paul amen
[1:10:01] paul had to go bound unto caesar that
[1:10:03] was part of the word also so god had to
[1:10:06] place a centurion there that may not
[1:10:08] have been predestinated seed may not
[1:10:10] have been on the line of life amen but
[1:10:12] he could be there to support paul's
[1:10:13] ministry on that line
[1:10:16] just like
[1:10:18] abraham's friends could support him
[1:10:22] so
[1:10:23] this line
[1:10:25] would be the the lamb's book of life
[1:10:28] the record of the seed
[1:10:32] but
[1:10:33] everything
[1:10:35] around it
[1:10:39] would be the book of life
[1:10:46] judas had his name in the book of life
[1:10:51] judas was a support to the ministry of
[1:10:53] jesus christ
[1:10:56] because the names in the book of life
[1:10:57] remember
[1:10:58] are there to support the life as the
[1:11:00] life's moving through and judas
[1:11:01] supported the life as the life was
[1:11:03] moving through amen and judas supported
[1:11:05] the life judas was treasurer judas did
[1:11:08] work judas was in the ministry judas
[1:11:10] healed the sick judas preached the
[1:11:12] gospel
[1:11:13] he did all those things
[1:11:15] but in the foreknowledge of god god
[1:11:17] would also know that judas would be one
[1:11:20] whose name would be on the book of life
[1:11:22] but he also knew that he'd be one whose
[1:11:23] name was blotted off the book of life
[1:11:27] so here we had
[1:11:29] judas
[1:11:33] judas was part
[1:11:35] he was part of this book of life because
[1:11:37] when he come back amen with the
[1:11:39] disciples and went to 70 and they were
[1:11:41] saying you know the spirits are subject
[1:11:43] unto us jesus says don't rejoice because
[1:11:45] the spirits are subject unto you but
[1:11:46] rejoice because your names are written
[1:11:48] in heaven
[1:11:50] so judah's name was in the book of life
[1:11:53] amen but when he turned on life when he
[1:11:56] turned on the typos when he rejected the
[1:11:59] word made life in front of him amen
[1:12:02] judas
[1:12:03] was blotted off of the book
[1:12:05] let's just do it that way
[1:12:08] and demas was blotted off of the book of
[1:12:10] life they had a part in the book of life
[1:12:13] because they were there supporting the
[1:12:15] life for a time but whenever they
[1:12:17] rejected the life they were blotted off
[1:12:19] of the book of life
[1:12:22] this is what brother branham's teaching
[1:12:23] us amen and so god has created
[1:12:27] opportunities for numerous people if
[1:12:30] they'll just support the life amen god
[1:12:32] had god has opened up in his mind and
[1:12:35] his thinking before the foundation of
[1:12:36] the world he knew there would be a fall
[1:12:40] and in being a fall amen the world is
[1:12:42] going to be populated with all kinds of
[1:12:44] people now because of hybridization
[1:12:47] no longer was it just going to be his
[1:12:49] seed borne by his predestinated will now
[1:12:52] the will of man was going to bring forth
[1:12:53] whenever man wanted to bring forth
[1:12:56] and there's going to be multitudes of
[1:12:57] people on the earth but god still had a
[1:13:00] predestinated seed that was going to
[1:13:02] come all the way down through that line
[1:13:04] so what did god do for all these other
[1:13:06] people that were going to be born
[1:13:07] because of hybridization because of the
[1:13:10] introduction of sex sexual birth and sex
[1:13:13] desire by man to have man at his own
[1:13:15] will now there's going to be all these
[1:13:17] people but if they can support life amen
[1:13:20] if they can support the life as it comes
[1:13:22] down through they can be part of the
[1:13:24] book of life amen
[1:13:27] and they can receive life
[1:13:30] let's look at a couple things brother
[1:13:31] benham says
[1:13:36] he said in christ is the mystery of god
[1:13:38] revealed
[1:13:39] watch redeemed by christ the second adam
[1:13:41] you believe he was
[1:13:43] going back home to eden with his fallen
[1:13:44] wife redeemed back home again that's
[1:13:46] christ in the church today taking his
[1:13:48] wife back see the threefold mystery
[1:13:51] god manifest in christ christ manifests
[1:13:53] in the church all together to bring back
[1:13:55] the original adam and eve again man and
[1:13:57] woman which are one
[1:13:59] made out of the same blood same spirit
[1:14:02] everything else
[1:14:03] the church is the blood of christ by the
[1:14:06] spirit because the life is in the blood
[1:14:11] the church
[1:14:13] is the blood of christ
[1:14:14] by the spirit
[1:14:16] because the life is in the blood
[1:14:19] so when the life of that blood is now
[1:14:21] present in the church manifesting the
[1:14:22] word for their day amen the church amen
[1:14:25] is the blood by the spirit amen that
[1:14:28] manifestation that word made flesh
[1:14:30] becomes the tie post
[1:14:32] and we can get a hold of the thai post
[1:14:35] in that manifestation
[1:14:38] and what does it do
[1:14:40] it links us right back here to calvary
[1:14:46] see we live over here
[1:14:52] i want to be linked to calvary
[1:14:56] do you want to be linked to calvary
[1:14:59] then in order to be linked to calvary
[1:15:01] i've got to find where that line is
[1:15:03] traveling in my day
[1:15:06] i got a in in the great mind of god when
[1:15:08] god mapped it out for 6 000 years he was
[1:15:10] bringing his life down all the way
[1:15:12] through and injecting his life into the
[1:15:14] timeline and through the timeline there
[1:15:16] was always going to be expression of the
[1:15:18] life of god amen and so now in the day
[1:15:20] that we live all the way here on the end
[1:15:23] of the gentile dispensation how do i get
[1:15:26] a hold of calvary that was 2 000 years
[1:15:28] ago there is a line that links me right
[1:15:31] back to calvary but i got to get a hold
[1:15:33] of that line and how do i know where
[1:15:34] that line is wherever the word of god
[1:15:37] for this day is made manifest is the
[1:15:39] thai post and when i get a hold of that
[1:15:42] thai post there is a lifeline a
[1:15:44] bloodline that goes all the way back to
[1:15:45] calvary
[1:15:49] see when jesus
[1:15:51] when jesus
[1:15:53] went to
[1:15:54] uh i can't remember what city it was but
[1:15:56] when he's walking through the city and
[1:15:57] he comes to a sycamore tree and he looks
[1:15:59] up and zacchaeus is up there says
[1:16:01] zacchaeus come down i'm going to your
[1:16:02] house today and he goes into zach he is
[1:16:04] his house and in zacchaeus's house amen
[1:16:08] zacchaeus begins to confess all of his
[1:16:10] sins i've done all this and i'm going to
[1:16:12] pay back if i stole anything i'll pay it
[1:16:14] back four times i'm going to give to the
[1:16:16] poor and he confesses his faults and he
[1:16:18] acknowledges he's going to make it right
[1:16:20] and jesus said salvation has come to
[1:16:23] this house today
[1:16:25] he didn't ask zacchaeus to believe
[1:16:27] anything in a former day
[1:16:30] he didn't ask zacchaeus to believe
[1:16:31] anything that would come in the future
[1:16:34] but because zacchaeus received the
[1:16:36] manifested word for his day that the
[1:16:38] high priest couldn't receive that the
[1:16:40] chief elders couldn't receive that the
[1:16:41] scribes and pharisees couldn't receive
[1:16:43] when zacchaeus could receive it confess
[1:16:46] his wrongs and repent he says salvation
[1:16:48] has come to this house today
[1:16:53] but but what if zacchaeus made a mistake
[1:16:55] later i don't think jesus is taking back
[1:16:57] his declaration of salvation amen
[1:17:00] i don't think jesus is playing a game
[1:17:02] saying zacchaeus you're saved but you
[1:17:04] know don't make a mistake and don't fail
[1:17:06] to receive me later no when zacchaeus
[1:17:09] had the capacity to recognize the living
[1:17:11] word he knew what was inside of
[1:17:13] zacchaeus
[1:17:15] he gets invited to simon's house and in
[1:17:17] simon's house amen simon pays him no
[1:17:19] respect simon gives him no uh washing of
[1:17:22] his feet no kiss no greeting amen and
[1:17:24] simon just invites him to the house but
[1:17:26] has no respect for the word made flesh
[1:17:30] but there's a little harlot woman
[1:17:31] there's a little woman's trapped and
[1:17:33] steeped in sin and she comes running in
[1:17:35] and breaks an alabaster box and washes
[1:17:36] his feet with her tears dries him with
[1:17:38] their hair and jesus looks at simon and
[1:17:41] he tells this woman though her sins are
[1:17:43] many they are all forgiving her
[1:17:47] she listen i i say this and don't get
[1:17:50] shocked at what i say jesus declared
[1:17:53] that all her sins were forgiven and we
[1:17:55] have no record in the bible of her
[1:17:57] asking forgiveness for her sins
[1:18:02] he didn't wait for her to say a sinner's
[1:18:04] prayer he didn't wait for her to ask
[1:18:05] forgiveness he didn't tell her to go to
[1:18:07] the temple
[1:18:10] there was nothing else she had to do all
[1:18:12] she had to do was recognize the word
[1:18:15] made flesh before her and she fell at
[1:18:17] his feet and began to worship the word
[1:18:19] that was made fast and she was getting a
[1:18:21] hold of the thai post amen
[1:18:23] and a few days after that that typos
[1:18:25] would go to calvary and shed blood and
[1:18:27] that shed blood was the price of her
[1:18:29] redemption but she got a hold of the
[1:18:30] typos here
[1:18:36] and jesus said he looked at her and says
[1:18:39] your faith
[1:18:41] has saved you
[1:18:43] saved by faith faith and what faith in
[1:18:47] the word that was presented to her in
[1:18:49] her day
[1:18:52] see those on the bloodline
[1:18:57] can recognize the word made flesh
[1:19:00] and they become the word made flesh
[1:19:05] and everything that supports that life
[1:19:08] and labors to bring forth that life and
[1:19:11] is working in conjunction with that life
[1:19:14] is also part of the book of life
[1:19:17] and as long as they never fight that
[1:19:19] life their name can remain on the book
[1:19:22] of life
[1:19:23] but if they ever fight against that life
[1:19:25] like judas did their name is blotted out
[1:19:28] of the book of life
[1:19:30] because it all has to do with zoe life
[1:19:36] i've already blew my one hour deal
[1:19:41] but i want to read just a couple quotes
[1:19:45] brother ben said after the bride is
[1:19:46] rapture will any foolish virgin be saved
[1:19:48] or will they all be lost
[1:19:50] no
[1:19:51] see everything will be finished for the
[1:19:53] gentile church when the bride is taken
[1:19:54] from the earth the spirit of god leaves
[1:19:56] the earth
[1:19:57] he that's filthy is filthy still he
[1:19:59] that's righteous is righteous still he
[1:20:00] that's holy is holy still amen what's he
[1:20:03] saying he's saying because the foolish
[1:20:06] virgin
[1:20:08] whatever they are they are by the time
[1:20:11] the bride goes up because when the bride
[1:20:13] leaves the earth the spirit of god
[1:20:14] leaves the earth when the spirit of god
[1:20:16] leaves the earth the blood life leaves
[1:20:18] the earth and now nobody in the gentile
[1:20:21] dispensation can change what they are
[1:20:24] they can only change what they are based
[1:20:26] off what they do with that life and
[1:20:28] remember no name was ever added to the
[1:20:32] book of life
[1:20:34] brother bram says it's very clearly at
[1:20:36] no time amen is there any record in the
[1:20:38] bible where names are being added to the
[1:20:41] book of life that was done before the
[1:20:43] foundation of the world and the book was
[1:20:45] sealed
[1:20:47] before the foundation of the world so
[1:20:49] you can't get your name on the book the
[1:20:51] only thing you can do is get your name
[1:20:53] off the book
[1:20:55] and what gets the name taken off of the
[1:20:57] book
[1:20:58] it's not smoking drinking lying
[1:21:00] committing adultery
[1:21:04] please don't throw anything at me
[1:21:07] we're more mature than that the the
[1:21:09] prophet of god has taught us better than
[1:21:11] that amen everybody comes into the world
[1:21:13] that way whether the name was on the
[1:21:15] book or not on the book i mean
[1:21:16] everybody's everybody's
[1:21:18] got that
[1:21:19] that they're disposed to those kind of
[1:21:21] things because of nature amen what get
[1:21:23] your name taken off the book there's
[1:21:24] only one thing that i know that gets
[1:21:26] your name taken off the book and that's
[1:21:28] rejecting and fighting against the life
[1:21:30] when it's presented to you
[1:21:32] because if you reject that life which is
[1:21:34] the word which is zoe life which is god
[1:21:36] which is christ which is the seed when
[1:21:39] you reject that you can have no part in
[1:21:41] life because your only link to life is
[1:21:43] this life zoe life
[1:21:45] and if you reject zoe life in your day
[1:21:47] how will you get entrance into zoe life
[1:21:49] at the white throne judgment
[1:21:53] praise god
[1:21:56] brother bem said in the second
[1:21:58] resurrection wherein
[1:21:59] the five foolish virgins come up notice
[1:22:02] that they were virgins they did not have
[1:22:04] the holy spirit so they missed being in
[1:22:05] the bride
[1:22:07] while the five wives who had oil became
[1:22:09] part of that bride but these people
[1:22:11] being a separated god-loving people and
[1:22:13] trying to abide in the word according to
[1:22:16] what they knew of it and being a help in
[1:22:18] the work of the lord will come up at the
[1:22:21] end of time
[1:22:23] it's not just that they wanted to do
[1:22:25] good
[1:22:27] it's they were a help in the work of the
[1:22:29] lord
[1:22:30] how were they a help i don't know god
[1:22:32] knows that
[1:22:33] they were either directly or indirectly
[1:22:35] supporting and helping the work of the
[1:22:37] lord but if they can stay true to that
[1:22:39] and never fight against the word
[1:22:42] their name can remain on the book of
[1:22:44] life
[1:22:48] they will miss the millennium which you
[1:22:50] can begin to see by these truth is much
[1:22:52] more important and wonderful than we
[1:22:54] have ever thought or believed all these
[1:22:56] people had their names in the book of
[1:22:57] life and their names remain but whose
[1:23:00] names did not remain those of the world
[1:23:02] system churches who fought the bride
[1:23:04] will be those whose names are removed
[1:23:07] that is who will lose out they will be
[1:23:09] cast into the lake of fire
[1:23:12] again in the sardisian church he says
[1:23:14] thus
[1:23:14] if god is so designed that there be
[1:23:16] those whose names are placed in a
[1:23:18] section of the lamb's book of life and
[1:23:20] cannot be erased for there the names of
[1:23:22] his bride then we must accept that
[1:23:24] if it also states that there are those
[1:23:26] whose names were placed in the record of
[1:23:27] book of life but in the foreknowledge of
[1:23:29] god they they were to fall and have
[1:23:32] their names removed we must accept that
[1:23:35] and if there are those whose names were
[1:23:37] never placed upon a record of life we
[1:23:39] must accept that also and if there are
[1:23:42] those who will enter into life eternal
[1:23:44] after the white throne judgment solely
[1:23:46] on the grounds of being good and kind
[1:23:48] and just to the elect of god who are his
[1:23:50] brethren then we cannot but accept that
[1:23:53] for who knoweth the mind of the lord
[1:23:55] that he should instruct him rather let
[1:23:57] us be subject in faith unto him who is
[1:23:59] our father and live
[1:24:03] further down he says i'm just going to
[1:24:04] pull just a small excerpt out of this
[1:24:07] he says
[1:24:09] then as we have previously shown there
[1:24:11] are those who stood for the bride and
[1:24:13] were an aide and a comfort to her
[1:24:16] maybe like the centurion for paul
[1:24:20] those had their names remaining on the
[1:24:21] book of life and go into life
[1:24:23] everlasting
[1:24:25] finally there are those such as pharaoh
[1:24:26] who never had their name on the book of
[1:24:28] life and these are cast into the lake of
[1:24:30] fire
[1:24:31] also
[1:24:33] thus the grain of wheat that became a
[1:24:34] plant for the harvest is the record of
[1:24:36] the church
[1:24:37] and even as not all the wheat plant is
[1:24:39] wheat seed and not all the plant is used
[1:24:41] in the harvest
[1:24:42] so with the church all the church is not
[1:24:44] the bride and neither is it all given
[1:24:46] eternal life but a part of it is
[1:24:48] gathered into the garner and a part of
[1:24:50] it is kept that it might enter into
[1:24:51] eternal life in the second resurrection
[1:24:53] and part of it which is accounted chaff
[1:24:55] is burned
[1:24:57] in the lake of fire
[1:24:59] the brother of them said this wheat
[1:25:01] plant that's been coming through to
[1:25:02] bring back the seed and harvest time the
[1:25:05] many member
[1:25:06] many member bride of jesus christ
[1:25:10] he said
[1:25:11] in the harvest time some of that seed is
[1:25:13] gathered into the garden
[1:25:16] some of that wheat plant is saved for
[1:25:18] another purpose and some of it is burnt
[1:25:20] like chaff
[1:25:23] have you ever seen them harvest wheat
[1:25:26] when they harvest wheat
[1:25:28] what's the reason they plant wheat
[1:25:31] to get wheat
[1:25:34] why was the christ seed planted to get a
[1:25:36] mini member of
[1:25:38] christ but along the way there's another
[1:25:42] valuable part of the wheat plant
[1:25:44] that is not wasted in the harvest
[1:25:47] the plant is necessary to support the
[1:25:49] life and bring it up all the way to
[1:25:50] harvest time it's all a support in the
[1:25:52] ministry of the life coming through as
[1:25:54] it matures and goes back to seed the
[1:25:56] purpose was to get seed but in harvest
[1:25:58] time if you've ever watched them harvest
[1:26:00] a field of wheat amen they'll go they'll
[1:26:02] go and they'll gather the wheat into the
[1:26:04] garden and when they get the wheat into
[1:26:05] the garner amen then they put it up in
[1:26:07] safety it goes back to the farmer's
[1:26:09] place but then that farmer will go back
[1:26:11] and he'll bail that straw because straw
[1:26:14] has another purpose for the farmer
[1:26:17] and the rest of the chaff is led to laid
[1:26:19] there the rot
[1:26:21] that's what brother branham is telling
[1:26:22] us here god had a purpose in bringing it
[1:26:25] all up it was to get wheat amen but all
[1:26:27] that that supported the life coming
[1:26:29] through he has a purpose for it too and
[1:26:31] he has a use for it in his kingdom
[1:26:34] but all that that was against and pulled
[1:26:35] away and fought the truth it it is burnt
[1:26:38] like shaft it is burnt out
[1:26:41] and so i say
[1:26:42] thank god for the book of life
[1:26:46] amen what do we say all this for
[1:26:51] like we said on sunday
[1:26:53] when we live in this life there's more
[1:26:55] going on all around us than we realize
[1:26:57] there's supernatural things there's
[1:26:59] predestinated conversations we have
[1:27:01] predestinated contact we have with
[1:27:03] people and there are people who've been
[1:27:05] predestinated to have contact with you
[1:27:09] and the foreknowledge of god he would
[1:27:11] know when you would need a support when
[1:27:12] you would need a help when you would
[1:27:14] need a system when you would need
[1:27:15] something to bring that life along amen
[1:27:18] and it was already pre-arranged in the
[1:27:20] mind of god and when we have these odd
[1:27:22] things that happen to us in life when
[1:27:24] somebody's just there when we needed to
[1:27:25] be there when they stand up for us in
[1:27:27] the face of persecution when something
[1:27:29] happens i would rejoice whenever that
[1:27:31] happens friends because there is a book
[1:27:33] of life and that book of life is a
[1:27:35] support that's surrounding the seed of
[1:27:37] life that's going through the lamb's
[1:27:38] book of life
[1:27:41] and it's all there
[1:27:43] to support the life of christ and
[1:27:46] everything that supports the life of
[1:27:47] christ
[1:27:48] can have entrance into life
[1:27:51] god is merciful
[1:27:54] god is gracious
[1:27:56] full of mercy
[1:27:58] he's created all kinds of opportunity
[1:28:01] for salvation
[1:28:03] and i say
[1:28:05] thank you lord
[1:28:08] when god foresaw his plan
[1:28:11] he knew
[1:28:13] he knew when he looked down through time
[1:28:15] and he was going to bring this to pass
[1:28:17] at this time and manifest himself in
[1:28:19] this way he knew he would need to get
[1:28:21] paul over to caesar
[1:28:24] and he knew he would need a centurion
[1:28:26] that would look after him and get him
[1:28:27] there but allow him to minister along
[1:28:29] the way
[1:28:31] oh
[1:28:32] i hope to meet that centurion someday
[1:28:35] i hope that centurion comes walking
[1:28:37] through an open gate
[1:28:38] in the city someday and i say were you
[1:28:41] that centurion that i read about in the
[1:28:43] book of acts amen
[1:28:45] praise god thank you for supporting paul
[1:28:48] amen thank you for what you've done
[1:28:51] i think it's a wonderful thing
[1:28:54] what brother brendon has taught us on
[1:28:55] the book of life
[1:28:57] it's so contrary to what the
[1:28:59] denominations teach
[1:29:01] it's so absolutely opposite amen i mean
[1:29:04] if you want to be
[1:29:06] i mean if you want to be good in your
[1:29:08] denomination you have to acknowledge
[1:29:10] that that's the only way to life
[1:29:12] this doctrine this teaching this
[1:29:13] confession these things that you say
[1:29:16] this repeating of a certain phrase
[1:29:17] that's how you come to life amen and it
[1:29:19] does not match the character of the god
[1:29:21] of this bible but what the prophet of
[1:29:23] god has taught us about the book of life
[1:29:25] exactly matches the character of the god
[1:29:28] of this bible from genesis to revelation
[1:29:31] this isn't just something that's neat
[1:29:33] amen that we get excited about because
[1:29:34] we see there's potential for other
[1:29:36] people out there and potential maybe for
[1:29:38] people that we love but when we look at
[1:29:40] it this message is christ amen it is the
[1:29:43] very nature of god and every doctrine
[1:29:46] that this prophet teaches us includes
[1:29:48] the entire nature of god they're not
[1:29:50] isolated doctrines amen doctrine of
[1:29:53] godhead and water baptism
[1:29:55] and the book of life they're not
[1:29:56] isolated doctrines that we just talk
[1:29:58] about because they're need they are
[1:30:00] absolutely portraying the very nature of
[1:30:02] god almighty
[1:30:04] and brother branham's teaching on the
[1:30:06] book of life
[1:30:08] absolutely
[1:30:10] demonstrates to us the very nature and
[1:30:13] character of god
[1:30:15] the god that brother banham talks about
[1:30:17] at white throne judgment the god that he
[1:30:20] talks about with the book of life
[1:30:23] is the god i read from genesis to
[1:30:25] revelation in this book
[1:30:28] this message is so perfect
[1:30:33] remember it's the apostle paul
[1:30:36] who told us that by faith we are
[1:30:39] children of abraham
[1:30:41] was it the apostle paul
[1:30:44] so
[1:30:44] he says by faith we are the children of
[1:30:48] abraham
[1:30:50] then if we're children of abraham then
[1:30:52] we get abraham's promise is that right
[1:30:55] because abraham's promise was to abraham
[1:30:59] and to his seed after him
[1:31:01] and by faith we as gentiles by faith by
[1:31:04] the faith seat inside of us by true
[1:31:06] faith we are abraham's children and
[1:31:09] therefore we are part of that blessing
[1:31:11] for abraham and his children
[1:31:13] we'll remember all the way back when
[1:31:15] abraham was called and god gave him his
[1:31:18] blessing he said whoever blesses you i
[1:31:20] will bless and whoever curses you i will
[1:31:22] curse
[1:31:24] tell me if brother branham's doctrine on
[1:31:26] on on the white throne judgment does not
[1:31:28] exactly match that promise to abraham
[1:31:32] which we are under by being a faith seed
[1:31:35] of abraham we come right in line with
[1:31:37] that promise and brother branham is
[1:31:39] picked up in the white throne judgment a
[1:31:41] prophecy and a promise that was placed
[1:31:43] on abraham all the way back over 4 000
[1:31:46] years ago brought it right to the white
[1:31:47] throne judgment and exactly matches
[1:31:50] exactly what was told to abraham
[1:31:52] and we as being children of abraham by
[1:31:55] faith are under that promise whoever
[1:31:57] blesses you i will bless and whoever
[1:31:59] curses you i will curse
[1:32:04] this bible
[1:32:05] is perfect amen
[1:32:07] and this message is christ
[1:32:10] and it came to unshackle us from
[1:32:13] denominational bounds bonds that were
[1:32:17] bound around our mind to break it off so
[1:32:19] that we can see the god of this bible
[1:32:21] through the whole bible
[1:32:24] amen let's stand
[1:32:26] i'm done
[1:32:29] i didn't meet my goal
[1:32:32] but it was a very slight improvement i
[1:32:34] won't tell you how slight
[1:32:39] oh i am trying to do better on wednesday
[1:32:42] nights
[1:32:44] pray for me
[1:32:47] i love this message
[1:32:49] the more i read it the more i study it
[1:32:51] the more i read my bible the more
[1:32:53] perfect it becomes
[1:32:55] things that years ago were questions and
[1:32:57] i couldn't sort it out and pieces that
[1:32:59] didn't fit together by revelation upon
[1:33:01] revelation god keeps sliding it together
[1:33:03] and sliding it together and you realize
[1:33:06] i don't care what anybody else says or
[1:33:08] what they think about the prophet of god
[1:33:10] whether they think about brother
[1:33:11] branham's ministry or his doctrine god
[1:33:13] has so confirmed his ministry over and
[1:33:16] over and over again by this book right
[1:33:18] here there is no question
[1:33:21] in this message
[1:33:23] when god begins to lace his word
[1:33:25] together with the ministry of the
[1:33:27] prophet and somebody says 16 men didn't
[1:33:30] fall off a bridge all of a sudden it
[1:33:31] doesn't matter if 16 men fell off a
[1:33:33] bridge did you not read your bible
[1:33:37] i want to leave the message because they
[1:33:39] don't have proof 16 men fell off a
[1:33:40] bridge read the bible and read the
[1:33:43] message i mean there's no problem
[1:33:46] there's no issue
[1:33:49] this message is christ
[1:33:51] it is the very character and nature of
[1:33:53] christ it is the very mind of god amen
[1:33:57] the book is open to us now it's been
[1:33:59] opened up by the opening of the seals
[1:34:01] the restoring of the word as a bright
[1:34:03] shining light that is shining down on
[1:34:05] this word to open the bible this is why
[1:34:07] brother brahm said my bible became a new
[1:34:09] book to me
[1:34:12] it's still becoming a new book to me
[1:34:15] god is perfect friends
[1:34:18] amen let's bow our heads and pray
[1:34:21] lord jesus i thank you for your word
[1:34:23] lord

[1:34:30] purpose

[1:34:33] years knowing when it would come to pass
[1:34:36] knowing when you would bring it back up
[1:34:38] and when you would tie it together oh
[1:34:41] god you amaze us lord
[1:34:44] god we thank you for sending a prophet
[1:34:46] in this day
