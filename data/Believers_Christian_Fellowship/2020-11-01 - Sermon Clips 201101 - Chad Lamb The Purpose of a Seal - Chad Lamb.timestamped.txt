[0:00] so the whole book is the book of life of
[0:03] the lamb the lamb's book of life
[0:05] it's all about eternal life it's all
[0:07] about the tree of life it's all about
[0:09] the word
[0:09] it's all about him he comes to get the
[0:13] book and the book is all about him
[0:15] all the contents in the book is him but
[0:17] when you look at the words in the book
[0:19] when you start to separate pieces of the
[0:21] body
[0:21] amen what are those those are the
[0:23] believers so what are the believers the
[0:25] believers are the word
[0:26] what is the word the word is him amen
[0:29] you are
[0:30] the book you're part of the book amen
[0:32] the book isn't paper
[0:34] the book is the life of the lamb amen
[0:36] it's christ as he comes down through
[0:39] it's christ in noah christ and moses
[0:41] christ and abraham
[0:43] christ and brother branham christ in you
[0:45] the hope of glory
[0:47] and if it's christ in you then you're
[0:49] the words in the book
[0:51] your name is in the book maybe not the
[0:54] name that you have now brother branham
[0:55] said
[0:56] but who you are your position your
[0:58] identity is found in this book
[1:04] and how does he call your name by
[1:06] revealing the mysteries
[1:08] and the revealing the mysteries is
[1:09] calling the name
[1:13] he didn't say chad they say bob
[1:16] then say mary what did he say
[1:20] he said what happened in the garden
[1:25] the reason for a blood sacrifice the
[1:26] reason jesus needed to be born virgin
[1:30] was because of adultery in the garden
[1:32] and you said
[1:33] that's true what's he doing
[1:36] calling your name what's your name your
[1:38] identification
[1:40] he's calling your identity because it's
[1:43] christ
[1:44] calling to christ it's the word
[1:47] calling to the word and the only thing
[1:49] that can call the word
[1:51] is the word the revealed word called the
[1:53] predestinated word for that day
[1:56] and the two are magnetized to come
[1:57] together
[2:00] some hear the doctrine of serpentine
[2:02] saying that's weird
[2:04] you heard the doctrine of serpent seed
[2:06] and even if you said that's weird
[2:07] something
[2:08] inside started turning and you may have
[2:11] said that's weird
[2:12] i don't know i've never heard that
[2:13] before but all of a sudden you get an
[2:15] uncomfortable feeling inside that this
[2:17] is might be true
[2:20] oh god help me
[2:24] i remember that feeling friend something
[2:26] in me my brain was saying no my heart
[2:28] was saying yes
[2:30] my intellect my reasoning my logic my
[2:32] training my teaching
[2:33] my past history my years in a in a
[2:36] formal church
[2:36] we're all saying no way no way no way
[2:39] but something inside began to pulsate
[2:41] and the heartbeat got stronger and
[2:42] stronger and the more i heard it the
[2:44] more i knew it was true until one day
[2:45] god just dropped a revelation in my
[2:47] heart and i said that's nothing but the
[2:48] truth
[2:50] what was he doing he was calling my name
[2:52] how is he calling my name he was
[2:53] revealing the mysteries of this book
[2:56] amen what was the mysteries of the book
[2:57] it's a book of redemption and then he's
[2:59] starting to show you
[3:00] how you got into the condition you're in
[3:02] and how you get out of the condition
[3:04] you're in
[3:06] because that's redemption you're in the
[3:08] condition you're in because you need
[3:09] redemption because of a fall
[3:12] but but redemption brings me back to the
[3:14] place i was intended to be
[3:18] and that's what this seven seal mystery
[3:20] is all about
