TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Do you know what it is not to have one guilty feeling? Not to wonder where you're going when you die. Not condemned by the past. Not afraid of what tomorrow holds in store and know the reason why. Yes, that's just how it is when you go down in the water. For by faith you believe in what you've heard. It's no impossible dream you can start over clean when you're washed by the water of the word. Are you washed by the water? Washed by the water of the word. Are you washed by the water? Washed by the water of the word. It's like being born again with a whole new life to live. never having to look back to what you've been. Cuz according to the Lord, you become a new creation. And where he's concerned, never was no sin. For when God looks at you, he no longer sees a sinner, but a saint who's been washed white as snow. Not by anything we've done. By the blood of God's own son. Are you washed by the water of the word? Yes, I'm washed. Yes, I'm washed by the water. Washed by the water of the word. I am washed by the water. Washed by the water of the word. Verse three. It's like being born again with a whole new life to live, never having to look back to what you've been. Because according to the Lord, you've become a new creation. And where he's concerned, it never was no sin. For when God looks on you, he no longer sees a sinner, but a saint who's been washed white as snow. Not by anything we've done, by the blood of God's own son. Are you washed by the water of the word? Oh yes, I'm washed by the water. Washed by the water of the word. Yes, I'm washed by the water. Washed by the water of the word. So glad. So glad I'm wash by the water. Washed by the water of the word. Oh, I'm washed by the water. Washed by the water of the word. Now, let's go to the key of C. Oh, let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me. All his wonderful passion and purity. Oh thou spirit divine all my nature refine till the beauty of Jesus be seen in me once more. Let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me. All his wonderful passion and purity. Oh thou spirit divine. Oh my nature in mind. Till the beauty of Jesus be seen in me. She was a virgin bride to be. And one night as she prayed quietly, the spirit of the Lord overshadowed her. And he said, "You'll conceive a child that sin cannot defile." And she said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." So she kept these things and pondered them deep within her heart. She believed the word, never one time felt desire to depart. The word has been born in Mary and I can see it being born in you and me. Now we're that virgin bride to be saved through the blood of Calary. In this time of darkness, we have come to manifest the anointed word. Oh, that we all have heard and I can see it being born in you and me. Though we kept these things and pondered them deep within our hearts. We believe the word never one time felt desire to depart. For the word has been born in Mary and I can see it being born in you and he. Oh yes, the word has been born in Mary and I can see it being born in you and me. And we bring praisees to you, Lord. Lifting holy heads we worship and adore. Sinners saved by grace. We bow before your face. offering nothing but praisees to you, Lord. Empty handed we come to the high holy throne. Oh, open inside with nothing to hide. We offer praisees and we now worship the name of the lamb that was slain. Asking nothing for us. We just bring you our love offering praise. Would you stand with me this morning? And we bring praisees to you, Lord. Lifting holy hands we worship and adore. Sinners saved by grace we bow before your face. offering nothing but praisees to you. And angels fold their wings as we boldly sing. Redeemed by the lamb now holy we stand. We're offering praisees and all our sin stains are gone. And we've been washed in the blood. Pure and rightous we come to the most holy one offering praisees. Oh, we bring praisees. is to you Lord. Lifting holy hands we worship and adore. sinners saved by grace. We bow before your face. Offering nothing but praisees to you. As brother Chad comes this morning, how preious is your love for me. It is beyond my understanding. Oh Lord, I want to realize the meaning of the price which you paid to save us. The very heart you guide through me inspires my heart with humble worship. I could earn your love, my deeds, his grace, my spirit needs, and your redeeming favor. unto you I'll sing my song. Lifting up your name, Lord Jesus. Wondous love is pure and strong. Casting away my sin, changing me from I stand amazed of what you do. You hold a vessel that's been broken. The image Lord you want to see reflecting you in me the true and holy to you shall not break that's bruised it's garden this our God. Oh, you heal my body and my soul. Your love will make me whole by your restoring power. Unto you I'll sing my soul. lifting up your name, Lord Jesus. Wondous love is pure and strong, casting away my sin. You're changing me from within. You are faithful to me. You are faithful, Lord. You are faithful. Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Oh Lord Jesus, we're so glad that you are faithful. God, you've already tried man under conditional covenants and man could not remain faithful. But you brought us into an unconditional covenant in which you remain faithful, Lord. And we're so thankful for that faithfulness, Lord. For when we couldn't, you can. When we failed, you never fail. when we couldn't keep our end. You've kept yours all along, Lord, and sealed it by your own blood, Lord, so that it's irrevocable. God, we thank you for this time we get to spend together, Lord. We ask that you would come now and break the bread of life for us, Lord. As we've come to hear from you, we've come to worship you. We've come to bring glory to your name. And we're asking, God, that you would give us a fresh portion of mana from heaven. God, that that that bread of life that we need so desperately, Lord, to walk in this life. May you give us a fresh portion this morning. And may it strengthen us and sustain us, Lord. God, I pray you'd have your way as you take prereeminence among us. And may you have your way with this vessel of mind, Lord, as we've come to that portion of the service where we open your word and look into it, Lord. and we don't want to do so with intellect and the ability to read and natural eyesight. But God, we're asking for more than that, Lord. That you supply the portion we cannot. That you bring a spirit of revelation and understanding on your word. That you would give us the eyes sav that would help us to see. And God, may we take your word deep into our hearts and our souls. Lord, may we become one with it. And may it become a manifestation in our lives. We love you. We ask your blessing over all that's said and done. May it be to your pleasure, according to your will. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless you. We're going to have you all take your seats for just a moment. Amen. Thank you, musicians. Amen. I have a baby dedication this morning. Amen. So, if Brother Riley and Sister Abigail Sanders want to bring their little baby girl forward, we'd be really, really, really pleased to help them dedicate this baby to the Lord. Amen. and they named her Mildrid and call her Millie. Millie Rose Sanders. I looked up the name Mildred and it means gentle strength. I thought that's beautiful. Amen. What a good name. And so we thank God for this little gift that he's given to them. Oh, come here, Millie. Amen. Let's all bow our heads together. Dear heavenly father, we're so grateful, Lord, for your gifts are good. Your blessings are abundant. And God, we're not deserving of them, but we're grateful for them. And God, you saw fit to give this little life of Millie Rose, Lord, to this mother and this father. And God, they desired to commit her and dedicate her back to you, recognizing where she comes from. And God, they also want to commit themselves as stewards over this little life. And and as they commit themselves, Lord, I pray that you would bless them abundantly with the spirit of wisdom and understanding to know how to care for and raise this little life. May you touch our brother Riley, Lord. May you always be a provider and a protector. May Millie grow under his shelter, under his branches. May he be the oak for her to grow under. May he lead her and guide her in the ways that are right. God, we pray you bless her sister Abigail. May she nurture and care for little Millie. May you give her wisdom to know what she needs at all times. And God, may she be an example to her of Christian womanhood. And may Millie follow in her footsteps. And God, I pray that you'd help us as an assembly to be supportive and caring to help this family as they grow in your likeness and in your image. May we support them, care for them. May we be a shelter that they can rest under in weary times. May we be a support to them when they need it. And may your blessings abound in little Milliey's life. May you put a hedge of protection around her, Lord, that the fiery darts of the enemy will never get to her. May she grow, Lord, in grace and in understanding and knowledge. And God, may you give her eyesight to see from an early age. May she follow after you all the days of her life. May she never experience what it's like to go astray, but may she follow you, the great shepherd, from the time she's a child. And God, may you prosper her life, and may you get glory and honor in her life as her your purpose and her is fulfilled. We ask it in Jesus Christ holy name. Amen. Praise God. Yeah, that's right. God bless you. God bless you. Amen. Praise the Lord. That is a lot of fun. Thank you musicians for not being dismissed. I was out of order. God bless you. But you can be dismissed now. Amen. It's nice to have some backup and help when you need it. Amen. Uh we can all stand together and take our Bibles. I just want to welcome home the Gorillo family. It was good to see Brother Franco and Sister Amy and Pipa as well as Maria and Vidy. Amen. They were away in Italy and so we're so glad to have them home. And uh I told Brother Franco, I can't wait to say, "Brother Franco, bring up my PowerPoint." Amen. It'll just feel good to have him back in place. Amen. We also want to say we enjoyed the wedding very much yesterday and thankful all to you who were able to make it and so happy for the Bartum family and for what God has done for them and that was quite a blessing. Also, we've got quite a few visitors here today. So, we want to make sure you all are welcome and we want to make you feel welcome. There's a group of saints here from Omega Tabernacle and that's in D, Ohio. That's the church that brother Steven Gby's pastoring. Brother Steven and a portion of the church had to go to a funeral. So instead of having a service with just a small portion left, uh he suggested that as the rest of the congregation travel over here to join us in the service. So God bless you all. It's so good to have you with us. We just ask that the Lord will bless you. Also, uh it's good to have brother Don and sister Lauren Gurgle with us from South Carolina. God bless you. They were here Wednesday, but they slipped in and after the service started and I I miss greeting them. So God bless you. And I saw Brother Paul and Sister Norah come in. God bless you. It's good to have you guys back with us again. Also, just want to say it's been a pleasure to have brother Michael and Sister Mary and Quinland with us. They go home on Tuesdays, so we'll greatly miss you, but it's been good to have you. I mean, when they say they're coming for three, four or five weeks, it's like, oh, we got plenty of time, and before you know it, it's over with, but we've enjoyed the time that we got to share together. And I think this is Brother Aaron Yes. Am I right? God bless you, brother Aaron. It's good to have you and your family up with us as well. and anybody else who's visiting, God bless you. We want you to feel right at home. See, brother Arley and brother Andy, God bless you. It's good to see you guys again. Amen. So, it feels like a homecoming. Amen. It feels like family is here. So, praise the Lord. It's a good day to be together. I just want to let you know also that we've got the communion and feet washing this afternoon. And so, we'll announce that again at the end of service. Uh while we're standing together, let's open our Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11. Hebrews chap 11 and we will go to verse 24. Amen. Just want to share with you this message came to me in a unique way sometimes and I love it like this when God interrupts our plans. You know I had another plan and that plan got interrupted and the interruption of the plan sometimes causes you to lose sleep. you know, you're up in the middle of the night and I was up in the night a couple nights ago and then all of a sudden things began stirring and God put a scripture in my mind and no matter which way I rolled over to sleep, all I could see was that scripture. And so I tossed and turned for a bit, but it God just started working that scripture in my heart and my mind. And so I just want to share with you the things that that God was sharing with me. So just be pulling and receive and then what God has. Uh Hebrews 11:4 says, "By faith, Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt, for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward. By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king. For he endured as seeing him who is invisible. May God bless you as you take your seats. May God bless us as we look into the word. So this is the scripture that kept coming to me in the night in the early early hours of the morning. And and as I began to look at that, there was just almost like it began to highlight just a portion there that we knew. We all know we know this scripture. We've read it so much, but there's just a part that became magnified to me. So, I just want to look at it again. Hopefully, you have your Bible still open. He said, uh, verse 24, "By faith, Moses, when he was come to yours, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter." Listen, that's a pretty prestigious title. That's a pretty good place to be. If you were in Egypt in that day when Egypt was the world power and Pharaoh's Pharaoh was the richest and most powerful man in the whole world at that time. Amen. To be the son of Pharaoh's daughter and have Pharaoh as a grandfather. Hey, that that would be a wonderful thing. But he refused that, &gt;&gt; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season. I think what becomes amazing in this scripture is the contrast. &gt;&gt; And God does these things on purpose to draw our attention. It's not contrasting between, let's just say, an average Joe who's decided to give up a a a median wage earning job to go and do something for the kingdom or somebody who's just, you know, not well known and doesn't really he's just the average Joe, the regular guy on the block and all of a sudden he decides to change his course of life. And amen. This is not the contrast that the scripture is showing us. is showing the contrast from somebody who's going to the top all the way to the top as high almost as high as you can possibly go in this world and now he's choosing to suffer affliction with the lowest of the lowest the slaves. &gt;&gt; And he's refusing this to take this. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God, friends. I mean, God does this. God lays these things in the scriptures for a purpose. Amen. to get our attention so we can see these things. Now it says now in verse 26, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure in Egypt, for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward. Now, thank you, Franco, for bringing up my PowerPoint. I didn't get the chance to say bring up my PowerPoint. He ruined it. Thank you for bringing up my PowerPoint, Brother Franco. Amen. So I want to talk about the subject the value of Christ to me. The value of Christ to me &gt;&gt; and look at the scriptures as we go. This word reproach he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater treasure. The reproach means shame, disgrace or disapproval that is often directed at God's people or Christ stemming from a broken covenant, unfaithfulness or contempt for God's people and their righteousness. It can also mean the act of expressing such contempt such as through slander, mockery, mockery, uh reviling language. So if we look at this, there's a couple reasons that you can have a reproach. You can be a reproach against Christ because you reproach his word. You broke the covenant or you've been unfaithful. But in this situation, it's contempt for God's people in their righteousness. And it's the act of expressing such contempt. Amen. Through slander, mockery, or reviling language. This was the reproach of Christ. And Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater treasure. I want to read that together because I want to get the language right. Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure in Egypt. Brother Brandham says it this way in the message leadership. He says, "Esteeming the reproach to be called a fanatic, holy roller," or something like that, you know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And listen, I when I come back to the scripture, here's the part that that that that dropped into my heart that I couldn't get away from. It did not say that that Moses esteemed Christ greater riches. &gt;&gt; It wasn't that he esteemed Christ greater riches than all the treasured Egypt. He esteemed the reproach of Christ. Listen, that's a big statement, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because most of the people in the world can esteem God and esteem Christ greater riches than anything else. But it wasn't that he esteemed Christ greater riches. He esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches. He thought it was so much better to be mocked for following Christ than anything else. and he esteemed that mocking that making fun of that being identified with the lowest of the lowest that to him was greater riches. &gt;&gt; I mean that's what I was rolling around in my bed thinking it dropped in my heart. It was I mean we I've always looked at that scripture and thought yeah he he he loved Christ better than he loved the riches he loved he love and not that's all true statement there's nothing wrong with that but that's not what the Bible said exactly it didn't say he esteemed Christ greater riches he esteemed God greater he didn't he he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches &gt;&gt; oh praise God and listen he forsook everything &gt;&gt; brother Brenham says in the message leadership. He said Moses was a rich young ruler to become Pharaoh. He was Pharaoh's son and was heir to the throne. And he looked out to the impossible, a bunch of mudbers, a bunch of slaves. But by faith, he saw the promise of God through the word that his people would sojourn in a strange land for 400 years, but would be brought out by a mighty hand. And he esteemed that. What did he esteem? that promise that they would be brought out with a mighty hand. And he esteemed that brother says, "Hallelujah, greater riches than all the treasure of Egypt. For he forsook Egypt, not knowing where he was going. He was led by Christ. He forsook and he had his foot on the throne." And he could have been the next Pharaoh in Egypt, but he esteemed the reproach of Christ. the reproach to be called that odd one, to be called that fanatic, to take his place with the mudbers and the fanatics because he seen that the hour that the scripture was promised to be fulfilled was there then. And oh church, wake up. Can't you see the same thing tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The hour that's been promised is on us. &gt;&gt; Esteem the reproach of Jesus Christ greater riches than all the fellowship of anything. It takes father and mother, church, anything else. Follow the leadership of the spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He says, "What what was there in that day is here now." Amen. What were they coming to? They were coming to the promise of the word being fulfilled. And he looked out Oh, praise God. He looked out at a bunch of people that were part of the promise. And everybody else saw them as slaves, but he saw them as part of the promised word. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you could turn with me, uh, turn with me to Exodus chapter 2. Exodus chapter 2 verse 11. Exodus 2:11. And it came to pass in those days when Moses was grown that he went out into his brethren and looked on their burdens. And he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren, and he looked this way and that way. And when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. I want to go back to verse 11. And it said, "It came to pass in those days when Moses was grown." That word grown does not mean he reached adulthood. &gt;&gt; Uh I'll pull it up here in the concordance. That word grown means to become great or important, to promote, to make powerful, to praise, to magnify, to do great things. So when Moses had become a great man, when he had moved into a powerful position, not grown as he's an adult, grown that he's come to a status of position and power and greatness, that's when he went to go look upon his brethren. And and it says and and when Moses was grown, he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens. When Moses come to the height, &gt;&gt; when he come to position and power and prestige and glory, when he came to that, he didn't go out and look at slaves. &gt;&gt; He went out and looked at his brethren. He didn't identify himself with Egyptians. He identified himself with the people of the promise. &gt;&gt; And the people of the promise were beat down and rejected and cast away and slaves. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he called them brethren, not the Egyptians that he had lived with all of his life and grown up in their house. Amen. And had the power and had the prestige and had the money and had everything. He looked upon his brethren. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he decided that that reproach, that mockery, that being made fun of, that being cast down, because they were in the promise and covenant of Abraham and the promise of redemption, he he viewed that reproach greater treasure than everything he had. Now that he was grown and come to wealth and power and prestige and magnificence, he wanted that. I want I want to be identified with the slaves. I want to be identified with the castaways. I want to be identified. Why? Because they're part of the word. They're part of the covenant. They're part of the promise. And listen, friends, I don't think that was Moses humanity that made him want to take that position. There was something inside driving Moses that was greater than humanity. cuz show me a human being. Amen. That wants to go from the pinnacle of human life down to the lowest of human life and says this down here is more valuable to me than this up here. That's not a human being. That's a seed gene of God on the inside that's got an attraction to the word of God. He may not have understood it himself. Nobody around him may have been able to understand or comprehend. Why would you throw away so much? But to him, he was throwing away nothing because he esteemed the reproach. greater riches than the treasure. &gt;&gt; Listen, we are not perfect people. &gt;&gt; We're all the perfect people. Please stand up. But you know what? They're the people of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses goes out to his brethren, the people of the promise, the people of God. and he defends one who's being beaten by an Egyptian. And the next day, another one of his brethren is beating on another one of his brethren. And he smites him. He goes to correct them and he says, "Who made you ruler over us?" And listen, they they these probably weren't easy people to deal with. &gt;&gt; But they were his brethren, &gt;&gt; and he wanted to be identified with them, and he wanted to bear the same reproach that they bore. Oh, praise God. Help us to see what God sees. &gt;&gt; That's my desire, friends, is to see what God sees. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's Let's go on. I think I don't know. I got to go back and see where I'm supposed to be. Oh, God is so good. &gt;&gt; Let Yeah. Let's go over here. Turn with me to 1 Corinthians 10. 1 Corinthians chapter 10 in verse one. Moreover, brethren, I would not that you should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink. For they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But with many of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness. Now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil's things as they lusted. So now we we we come here to the the Apostle Paul writing to the Corinthian church and he begins to tell them he says what was going on in the wilderness. What what were they partaking of in their journey through the wilderness? And he begins to show, amen, that they they were they were in the realms of Christ, that they were following after Christ, that they were feeding on Christ, and they were drinking from Christ. &gt;&gt; Let's look at this again. He says verse two, "And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea." &gt;&gt; Amen. What does that cloud represent? &gt;&gt; That cloud was Christ. the logos, the pillar of fire, cloud by day, fire by night. Amen. That was Christ and he was the one leading them along. They were baptized in the sea. Amen. They they were those were the waters of separation separating them from the land of Egypt and crossing. Amen. What's he talking about? He says they had their baptism. They were baptized in the cloud. Amen. And they were baptized in the sea. Amen. Listen. They didn't know they were being baptized. They didn't know what was going on. They just knew the supernatural was happening in their life. Amen. But what was overshadowing them? Christ. Who parted the waters? Christ. Amen. What was happening? They were being baptized, separated, washed away from Egypt, and brought into Amen. the journey to a promised land. And then it says, let's let's keep looking now. And they did all eat the same spiritual meat. &gt;&gt; He's not talking about the physical mana. That's right. He's not speaking of the mana that they gathered and ate. That mana was representing something. What was mana representing? The mana was representing Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The cloud represented Christ. The mana represented Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We got it. &gt;&gt; Verse four. And did all drink the same spiritual drink. He's not talking about literal water. I mean, going down uh their throat. He says spiritual drink, not natural drink. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The natural drink was representing spiritual drink. And they did all drink the same spiritual drink. For they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them. And that rock was Christ. &gt;&gt; Is it What kind of rock is he talking about? A spiritual rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A spiritual rock that followed them through the wilderness. A spiritual rock. Amen. It It wasn't as though, Amen. that this rock had legs and this big boulder. Amen. That was split with a cleft in it. Amen. H kept getting legs and crawling out in the night. He's saying this was a spiritual rock that followed him. The real rock represented Amen. The the the natural rock represented the real rock. This was a representation. Amen. And they had the natural form. And the natural form was smitten. And in the in the smitten place, and the cleft of the rock came lifegiving water, testifying that Jesus Christ would come, the rock, the true revelation of God himself, and would be smitten. Amen. And where he was smitten would outflow. Amen. Water and blood, lifegiving flow would come out of that rock. Amen. And they were all drinking, testifying of a rock that was coming. But because this was representing that, Amen. When they were walking through the natural walk spiritually, this was all Christ manifesting. Christ manifesting, Christ manifesting, Christ manifesting. &gt;&gt; Christ was the rock that followed them. Amen. And and you we begin to look at this and what Paul's saying, Paul is telling us that Christ was in the Exodus journey. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ was in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Is that right? right now. &gt;&gt; How else could Moses bear the reproach of Christ if Christ wasn't there? Amen. Christ was there and he wanted to bear the reproach of Christ. Amen. And and I'm I just want to tell you Christ is here today. Amen. And what's most valuable to us, friends, what is becoming the most valuable thing to us? Don't say the most valuable thing to me is Jesus Christ, but I want the reproach of Jesus Christ to be more valuable than anything else I can put my hands on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That the worst of the worst and the lowest of the lowest and the rejection and the mockery and the misunderstanding and everything that goes with serving Christ in this day. I want to value that more than I value anything that I can have in this world. &gt;&gt; Anybody can say I value Christ more. But can you value the reproach of Christ &gt;&gt; more? Amen. Amen. So the the the spiritual meat, the food was Christ. It was represented by mana. But the real spiritual food that they were eating was Christ. &gt;&gt; They the real spiritual water they were drinking was Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. In in most of the world, uh, the Christian world, they begin to look back at Jesus Christ, the man of Nazareth, the body that was born through the Virgin Mary, and they put all of Christ into that package. Well, that's true. All of Christ was in that package. But don't fail to see, Christ was before that manifestation, and Christ is still here today. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what Jesus says in John 6. Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven, but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world. Jesus is telling them that bread was natural bread. Amen. But my father giveth you the true bread. And the true bread is he that cometh down from heaven, which is Christ, and giveth life unto the world. In John 6:41, the Jews then murmured in him because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am the bread. You're looking back at mana and you're rejoicing. But listen, you're missing what it really represents. I am the bread. &gt;&gt; And and and listen, just like mana, oh, praise be to God. Just like mana, Amen. was a bread that you had to eat in the day it fell. Amen. Jesus Christ is the bread that came down from heaven. And he's the bread that you have to eat in the day that it falls. Amen. You couldn't carry it over from one age to another, from one dispensation to the next because it would spoil. Amen. There was only one place, amen, that that word would keep for eternity, and that's in the presence of shikina glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. When it came into the earth to be manifest day after day after day, amen. at the rising of the sun, they would recognize that new mana had come down from heaven and they would collect a day's worth and eat that, but they couldn't keep it over. Amen. So, he is the bread that came down from heaven. That representation was there to show us that you must eat Christ in the day the bread falls. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not worm eating maggoty bread from a previous day, but today's bread. Amen. And when you eat today's bread, Amen. God brings us into a higher order and a higher relationship and sustains our life. Amen. And if if if you're one of God's children, then by his spirit, you're made a king and a priest. And if you're made a priest, then you can go in behind the veil. And when you go behind the veil, you can eat the eternal portion of Christ that's never spoiled. The thought of God from before the foundation of the world, and you can feast on that. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. I am the bread which came down from heaven. Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; They were they were eating bread, but that bread was representing Christ, and they were eating the spiritual bread. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In verse 48, he says, "I am the bread of life. Your fathers did eat mana in the wilderness and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I am the living bread which come down from heaven. If any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world. &gt;&gt; Oh man, this this is amazing because now he's starting to break it down and says, I listen, I'm the bread. They're their their human minds could not understand. How are you the bread that came down from heaven? How how are you the true bread? We don't understand what's happening. We've heard the stories all of our life. We know the word to mean this. And Jesus is taking deeper in the word and say, "You saw the representation, but you didn't catch the meaning. You didn't catch the real life behind the manifestation in the wilderness." Cuz the life behind that was Christ, the word coming to fulfillment. &gt;&gt; And then they're like, "What? What does this mean? What does this mean that he's the bread?" And then he he goes further. I am the living bread. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Which I will give for the life of the world. You talk about a mental short circuit. &gt;&gt; All the fuses popped right then because they're looking at a human being. They're looking at God in flesh, the man form, and he's telling them, "Listen, the word th this bread that I give is my flesh." Amen. which I will give for the life of the world. And you've got to eat that. Eat what? Eat me. How am I going to eat him? Amen. The Bible forbids this kind of fortaking. understand what's going on because right in front of them is Christ. They see a man, but there's Christ. &gt;&gt; John 1:14, he says, "And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us." &gt;&gt; What did he say that he would give for the life of the world? He would give his flesh. &gt;&gt; And his flesh is the bread. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And what is his flesh? His flesh was the word that was made flesh. &gt;&gt; See, this is where the the communion service in the Catholic realms, amen, begin to fail because they see this as literal. And now they have to make some way that if you eat bread, you eat his flesh, you can live. So they have to have a ceremony in which the priest under certain incantations and certain orders, he can he can have the power to literally transform the little wafer and bread into the physical body of Jesus Christ. So that when you eat that bread, Amen. This is Catholic doctrine. When you eat that bread, you're actually eating a part of Christ and Christ is becoming one with you. That's why you got to continually go back to the priest and go back to mass. That's why they have mass every time because mass is where you go and partake of Christ. And if you don't have the church and you don't have the priest, you can't have the bread. &gt;&gt; And they've turned it into something literal and begin to control the people by that. Amen. But they missed the whole point. Amen. There's not a priest who can do a little ceremony and say some words in Latin and ring a little bell and turn this wafer that man made into the literal body of Jesus Christ that if he comes and puts it on your tongue and you take it in yourself, now you've got Christ abiding in you. Amen. That's wrong. Amen. It wasn't flour mixed with water. Amen. And a little oil. That's not what that wafer is all about. Amen. It's the word. It was the word that was made flesh. Amen. And it was the flesh of the word. When the word, all that God was, he poured in the Christ. When the fullness of the thought became word and the word all became a man, it was the flesh of Jesus Christ. And he said, "Unless you eat my flesh," what is his flesh? It's the manifested word on display so that we can still eat his flesh, friends. Amen. Not going to a church and taking a wafer that a priest prayed over. Amen. but taking the word, the mana that's falling in our day and receiving it into ourselves because his word is still being made flesh in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bearing the reproach of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 6:52. The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you." Oh my, it just keeps getting worse. &gt;&gt; For the intellectual believer, it just keeps getting worse. &gt;&gt; And except you eat the flesh of the S and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Who so eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood dwelleth in me, and I in him. &gt;&gt; Not a wafer from a Catholic priest. &gt;&gt; But if you eat his flesh and you drink his blood, then then you dwell in him and he dwells in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; As the living father sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. This is that bread which came down from heaven, not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead. He that eateth of this bread shall live forever. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; How many want to eat this bread &gt;&gt; and drink this blood? &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to I just want to take you back to the scripture in 1 Corinthians 10. In 1 Corinthians 10, they ate his flesh and drank his blood. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let's go back to 1 Corinthians 10. Verse 2, 10 and two. And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and that all eat the same spiritual meat, and that all drink the same spiritual drink, for they drank of that spiritual walk rock that followed them. And that rock was Christ. &gt;&gt; They were feeding on Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Spiritually they were receiving the word for their day. They were walking in the word for their day. They were feasting on the mana that was falling as that word was becoming flesh. Amen. God says, "I will I will come and I will bring them out with a mighty hand. I'll be their redeemer." And there was a promise of a redeemer. And he comes down to Moses and he says, "Moses, I've heard the cry of my people and I've come down to deliver them. Now come, I'm sending you." Amen. And he was he was now what was Moses? Moses was fleshing out the promised word that God was going to be a redeemer. And how was God going to be a redeemer? He was being a redeemer in Moses. And Moses was becoming the flesh of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why God punished him so much. Every time they rejected Moses, &gt;&gt; his sister and brother, there was a punishment. When Cora, Dayan, and Abram, there was a punishment. Why? Because Moses became the word fleshed out in his human flesh. That promise of a redeemer, that promise of a mighty God coming to deliver, it was all wrapped up in working through Moses. And Moses was calling for flies. It wasn't Moses's power calling for flies. That was Christ working through Moses calling for flies. Christ through Moses calling for frogs. Christ through Moses bringing the plagues. Christ through Moses lifting the rod. That wasn't a man. That was God working through the man. &gt;&gt; And it was the word becoming flesh. And now they were walking in the promise of the word, going to the fulfillment of the promise, which was a promise that they would inherit the land that was promised to Abraham and to his seed. And now they're walking in the wilderness journey, walking as a manifestation of the word because this word has to come into manifestation. There has to be a seed of Abraham that will go in and possess the land because it was promised. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when they were walking and receiving the word made flesh, they were drinking a spiritual drink. And they were eating a spiritual meat. Amen. And they were drinking from that rock. And that rock was Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We want to bear the reproach of Christ. But that's not friends in our day. is not just believing that Jesus Christ came 2,000 years ago, died on Calvary, shed his blood for our redemption. Amen. That the world believes &gt;&gt; there's not a reproach in believing that. &gt;&gt; If you go to work and say you believe that, who mocks you and makes fun of you? &gt;&gt; Who calls you ridicul? I mean, it happens in certain pockets, but not not worldwide. Amen. Not that's not that's not made. But you go tell them that you believe God sent a prophet in our day to fulfill Malachi 4 and the revelation of Luke 17:30 and that we believe that the opening of the seals, Amen, brought Christ back to earth. And now he's dwelling in a many member body called his bride. And it's those people who have received this message have received Christ for their day. And that's where Christ is working. That's where Christ is tabernacle. That's where the proper place of worship now is in Christ and Christ is in his people. You start sharing that and there's a reproach for Christ. &gt;&gt; They'll start calling you a brandite and they'll call you following a man and they'll tell you and then you tell them, "We don't believe in the traditional Trinity doctrine as as as propagated by the Catholic Church, but we believe God is one and he operates in three manifestations. We baptize in the proper Christian baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ and no baptism outside this is recognized in the scripture." Then you'll start bearing a reproach for Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not by saying I'm a Christian. There's not a great reproach for that. But you start telling them that I'm feasting on the mana falling from heaven today and I'm believing the word for my day. The word that's fleshed out in this hour. And there's a reproach. &gt;&gt; There's a reproach for that Christ. &gt;&gt; And friends, I count that greater riches than anything in this world. Amen. to be mocked for believing the word to be rejected. Amen. When we come to the message, we were rejected by family. We were misunderstood. We were separated from the ones we loved. But I count it a blessing in my life to have found Christ. &gt;&gt; And if it brought separation, I didn't want separation. But with separation come, I would rather have this than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. We left jobs. We left home. We moved. Many of us move to places and we can't understand why we're moving, why we're selling out, why we're getting rid of properties and beautiful homes and the things that we had known and the places that we had grown up. Amen. What were we moving for? Amen. Christ was drawing us. &gt;&gt; We wanted to drink from the well. We wanted to eat from the from the fresh mana that was falling. &gt;&gt; And how many times you tell people that I'm moving? What are you moving for? I'm moving to go to church. And they say, "What's wrong with you?" &gt;&gt; Brother Chad Gaines works in Columbus. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he decided to live halfway between Mary'sville, could commute to work, but he still couldn't have the fellowship with the living word, &gt;&gt; the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; So, he made a decision a couple years ago to move to Lima and drive to work. every day. &gt;&gt; Why did he come? He wanted to be where the word was fleshed out. &gt;&gt; He told me, he said, "I can either drive to work or drive for fellowship. I'd rather live where there's fellowship and drive to work." I say, "God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; I'd rather to me the reproach of Christ, I esteem it greater riches than than saving gas money and saving my time on a commute and saving all of that." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We got Anna and Wesley Godfrey here. Ann, she's she's left home. She's left the place she grew up. She's left Connecticut that she knows so well. Amen. She's left the convenience of going to have coffee with a friend. Why did she leave that? Because of Wesley. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not us, friends. Don't Don't get confused. She didn't come here for us. She came here for him. &gt;&gt; But she esteemed life with him. greater riches than everything she had to leave. &gt;&gt; Proving her love for this man &gt;&gt; and all. Can I do that for Christ? Amen. Can I give up and separate Amen from the things that I that were dear to me once? Can there become something that becomes more dear to me than anything else? &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Brother Paul then comes and tells us what Jesus had said the night of the Passover. He said, "When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. &gt;&gt; This do in remembrance of me." &gt;&gt; After the same manner also, he took the cup when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This to you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me." I never intended to preach this because this is communion Sunday. It just happened, friends. Thank God. We take the word as it comes as God gives it to us. &gt;&gt; But Jesus is taking the bread and breaking it. And he's breaking that bread and said, "This is my body which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Bam said when we come to communion and we take that broken bread, it reminds us of Christ's body. Amen. The word made flesh being broken and torn for you and I. Amen. Because he's paying the price of redemption as he's laying down his life for our salvation. and we come in remembrance, but we come to where the bread is broken and the bread is torn. And he said, "This bread is me." &gt;&gt; He's doing it symbolically, friends. He's not doing it literally. He said, "I, my body, the the body of the word, the word made flesh, the word of God that's made flesh in my body is going to be bruised and torn and broken for you." &gt;&gt; Amen. Then I want you to come together and I want you to take bread and tear it to remember what I've done for you. And if you feast, amen, not on the bread, amen, the literal bread, but you feast on the bread of my body, which is the word made flesh. Amen. Do this. Amen. Because then you have life. &gt;&gt; Then he took the cup. He said, "This cup is a new testament in my blood." Because without the shedding of blood, there's no remission of sins. He had to have a blood to seal the covenant. But now it had to be human blood because it was a man who fell, Adam. It had to be a man who could restore and shed blood. But that blood, the Bible tells us, the blood represents the life. Amen. And he says, "Now take this, take this uh uh blood, this great this wine. Take this is the blood. This you do as often as you drink it in remembrance of me." And now he tells us to come together and take the wine. And brother Brandham said, "We don't do grape juice. We don't do this and that and the other." Amen. We take real wine because real wine has a preservative. Amen. It can last. It gets better with age. It doesn't get weaker. It gets stronger. And it's got life in it. &gt;&gt; And it's a representation of receiving the life of Christ. Amen. We feed on his word and we receive his life. And as we feed on his word and receive his life, we have his life. And when we come to communion, it's representing that that we are continually feeding on the word and we're continually receiving of his life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Continually. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just a one-time event, not just one something that happened a long time ago, not just something that happened 2,000 years ago. Amen. But I'm still feeding on the word. I'm still receiving this spiritual meat. I'm still receiving this spiritual drink from the spiritual rock which is Christ that is still following his people today. Don't you think that rock disappeared in the wilderness journey? That rock is still following his children today because it's the rock that supplies everything you need. It's the rock of revelation that gives you the drink. It's the rock of revelation that sustains us along the journey. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; That rock hasn't went anywhere. &gt;&gt; No, sir. because it's a spiritual rock &gt;&gt; and that rock is Christ &gt;&gt; and that rock is every bit here today in our journey as it was in that day. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; He comes in invisible union that he says what is sin? Sin is unbelief. Unbelief in what? The word. Unbelief in God which is the word pure, unadulterated. Oh hallelujah. Leaving soon for the skies. Amen. standing ready. Think your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word. &gt;&gt; The word became blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When did the word become blood? When it was made in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Jesus's flesh. The word bled for you and you were washed in bleeding word. The word bleeding. The life of God in the word. And the word was bled for you. what you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleaned and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stayed on God and on his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the word is still washing us in the blood. &gt;&gt; It's still cleansing us from sin. We're still receiving the blood as we receive the bleeding word. What is the bleeding word? The fresh kill for today. &gt;&gt; The fresh meat, the fresh mana that's falling from heaven day by day. The portion for this hour, that portion has life on the inside. And that life on the inside is the blood. And the life is cleansing us and washing us and washing all our sins away by what? By Christ today. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. How is he the same yesterday, today, and forever? What has Jesus Christ been? How was he Jesus Christ yesterday? He was Christ in the wilderness journey. &gt;&gt; And what he was there, he's the same today. But in the wilderness journey, we saw a pillar of fire and we saw a cloud and we saw a prophet. We saw all of that. Amen. But now today, he's Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. And then we saw that same Christ in one man, Jesus of Nazareth. Amen. The the the lamb of God. We saw him there. Amen. But we're still seeing Christ today &gt;&gt; cuz he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. How is he the same yesterday, today, and forever? Noah did something different than Moses. Abraham's manifestation was different than Moses's. Amen. Solomon's was different. What? How is he the same? Because he's always been and always will be. The word made manifest in every day. That's how it was. Christ in Noah, Christ in Jeremiah, Christ in Moses, Christ in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's wherever that man is falling fresh. It's wherever that bleeding word, that fresh word is producing the life of Christ. Amen. That's where he's at. That's where you come in contact with Christ. That's where you feed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why God sent a prophet. That's why God brought us the message. That's why these things have happened in this day. Amen. So we can come back in contact with a living Jesus Christ today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so now we're feeding &gt;&gt; on the spiritual meat. &gt;&gt; As we feed on the word, we're eating the mana &gt;&gt; and we're feeding on Christ. &gt;&gt; When we're drinking, Amen. from the fountain of revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Christ pouring out his life unto us and we're receiving the life of the word. Amen. As we're receiving that, we're receiving Christ. We're eating and drinking Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it, brother. &gt;&gt; Because in Moses's day in the Exodus journey, they ate and drank Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for the word of God. &gt;&gt; So thankful for this message. &gt;&gt; In the message, we would see Jesus. He says now but we have to find his nature. I'm sorry. Yeah. We have to find his nature. What he was. No. I'm sorry. Don't read that. Stop. Yeah. Okay. Now I know where I'm at. It's okay. Now you can read. Now, but we have to find his nature and what he was. Now, we all know and all Bible readers will agree that the pillar of fire that followed Israel in the wilderness or they followed the pillar of fire rather that that was the angel of the covenant that talked to Moses in the burning bush. That same pillar of fire, you agree with that? We all do. Well, who is the angel of the covenant? Christ. Moses forsook Egypt, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater treasure than that of Egypt. See, and now when he was here on earth, that pillar of fire was made flesh, dwelt among us. When he was here on earth, he said, "I come from God and I go to God." &gt;&gt; Now, remember yesterday, today, see, he come from God from the pillar of fire. He goes back to God. Now, after his death, burial, and resurrection, Saul of Tarsus on his road down to Damascus to arrest the Pentecostal people on his road down there. What happened? a pillar of fire, a light struck him down. Nobody else saw it. He saw it, but his eyes out out of uh out for a season. It was so real to him when the rest of them standing there couldn't see a thing. But it was so bright to him, it put his eyes out. And he said, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" And he said, "Who are you, Lord?" Now listen, I am Jesus. &gt;&gt; I am Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's hard for you to kick against the pricks. You remember that? Well, here he is. That same pillar of fire that was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon brings it right to his day. Amen. Amen. He brings it right. Amen. He brings it right to the baptism on on the on the Ohio River in 1933 when the pillar of fire came down. Amen. The picture in Houston, Texas, where the pillar of fire came down. night after night when the pillar of fire would move around and the pillar of fire was seen and photographed and witnessed to and moving amongst them. He's saying he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. And here Paul gets an amazing lesson as he saw going down to persecute the church and all of a sudden he sees the pillar of fire and brother Brandham said he called it Lord because he would have never called anything that wasn't God Lord and he recognized that pillar of fire is the same thing from the Old Testament and he knew it was God. &gt;&gt; And that pillar of fire spoke to him and said Saul Saul why persecutest thou me? And he said who are you Lord? He said I am Jesus whom you persecute. And Paul wasn't touching the man that was born from the Virgin Mary. He wasn't touching that body, that form, but he was persecuting Jesus just the same. Because in that day, Jesus was in a many membered body. Then when he was persecuting the many membered body, he was fighting the word, arresting the word, rejecting the word, &gt;&gt; the word that was being made flesh. And Jesus come to identify who it was he was persecuting. &gt;&gt; He thought it was men and women of various ages and degrees and status in life and and then the households and different ones and ignorant and some learned and some priest and he didn't realize it was Jesus. That's right &gt;&gt; in another form. &gt;&gt; But the pillar of fire came to him to awaken him to the fact of who this was. And then Paul, amen, was converted. His natural eyes were closed so his spiritual eyes could come open &gt;&gt; and he began to eat of this spiritual meat and drink of this spiritual water. &gt;&gt; That's how Paul could know who Christ was. That's why Paul could identify him in the Exodus journey because of this encounter he had on the road to Damascus. He understood who it was &gt;&gt; and how it worked. Amen. Brother Brandon makes this statement here in the anointed ones at the end time said, "I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river." Well, it appeared down on the river when he's baptizing the 17th person. And now a ball of fire comes down and rest over him and makes a declaration just as John the Baptist was sent to forrun his first coming that your your message will forrun his second coming. And he said, "I wasn't the one that appeared down in the river. I was only standing there when he appeared. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect they are. I'm only one that's near when he does it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I was only a voice that he used to say it. It wasn't what I knew. It's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through. It isn't me. It wasn't the seventh angel. Oh no. It was the manifestation of the son of man. It wasn't the angel. his message. It was the mystery that God unfolded. It's not a man. It's God. The angel was not the son of man. He was the messenger from the son of man. The son of man is Christ. &gt;&gt; He is the one that you're feeding on. &gt;&gt; Are you still eating spiritual meat? Are you still eating Christ? When Christ looked at his disciples when he looked in John chapter 6 and said, "Unless you eat my flesh, you have no life in you." Amen. What are you feeding on? You're feeding on He Christ is the one that you're feeding on. &gt;&gt; You're not feeding on a man, a man, his words will fail. But you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man. &gt;&gt; What does the term body word mean? It means all the way back in John 1. Amen. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. It was the fleshing out of the word and that become the body word that that they were to feed on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in this day, the word has become flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And brother Benham said, "The son of man is Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the one you're feeding on." &gt;&gt; So, what do I need to be eating? This word, &gt;&gt; this message of the hour, &gt;&gt; this word that's been delivered through a prophet in the end time that's been given to us is Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It is our meat. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It is our drink. &gt;&gt; It sustains us in our journey. It gives us overcoming life and ability. This is the word. This is Christ that we're feeding on. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the reproach of that, &gt;&gt; yes, sir, &gt;&gt; is greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt. &gt;&gt; It's greater to me. You know, it's amazing that they'll call us Branommites. And that doesn't offend me one bit &gt;&gt; because I never met a Wesleyan who gets offended being called a Wesleyan. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Never met a Lutheran that was really mad cuz you called him a Lutheran. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, Brandomite is not a derogatory term &gt;&gt; when you know who he is. We don't consider ourselves Brandommites. We're Christians. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if somebody calls me a brand, I'm not going to get all hot under the collar and correct them and tell them you're all wrong. Is it wrong? I mean, you're not mad if I say you're a Lutheran. You're a Lutheran. Because the Lutheran recognized God was leading them into something else. &gt;&gt; Problem is they stopped with Luther. &gt;&gt; Problem is they stopped with Lesie. And many times the problem is we stop with brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; But we're supposed to go on into Christ. Amen. And feed on this word that was brought through that vessel. &gt;&gt; But I would rather bear that reproach. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Than anything else in life. &gt;&gt; I I I had a minister one time call me. Amen. We we had a homeschool group that was uh using a church facility. Amen. And that somebody uh uh got a church age book and the church age book got to the pastor and the pastor called me and he says, "I'm troubled about the things that I'm reading here and what I'm learning about uh William Brandom and we don't want you to use our facility anymore." So I started talking to him. He says, "Listen, I'm not at all shy to tell you that what you believe by most of the Christian world is considered heresy. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he was talking about baptism in Jesus' name and oneness to the Godhead. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Yeah, I've heard that before." &gt;&gt; And Paul said, "In the way that is called heresy is the way that I worship the God of my fathers." So call it heresy all you want. They did to Paul. And that didn't trip up Paul. He said, "In the way that's called heresy, it's not heresy, but they call it heresy." But he knew what ground he was standing on and he knew who he was feeding from. And he wasn't ashamed to bear the reproach. &gt;&gt; He wasn't ashamed of his chains &gt;&gt; because his chains, he was chained for the testimony of Jesus Christ. Amen. Because he was bearing the word and it didn't bother him a bit. And he even commended one church. Amen. He says, "You haven't been ashamed of me in my bondage. &gt;&gt; I would I would rather bear the reproach." Listen, that day that was a reproach against the church. Amen. All of a sudden, Paul, Amen, Paul is now in prison. He's been imprisoned. He's been jailed. And before he was jailed, there was all kinds of rumors about him from from all kinds of different groups. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, he winds up in jail. And all the believers don't know what to do. Listen, that was a scandal in that day. &gt;&gt; But there were people there that were willing to bear the reproach of Paul. There were those who sent him funds. There were those who stood by him. There were those who received his letters. There were those who still believed he was the messenger of the age and the apostle to the Gentiles. Regardless of what the world labeled him and the bondage he was in and the prison sentence he was in, they were willing to bear the reproach &gt;&gt; esteeming the reproach of Christ. Why? Because Paul was fleshing out that word &gt;&gt; and they were willing to stand with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To me, you can call brother Ben whatever you want to call him. You can say he made up stories that he wanted people to like him. You can say he got birthdays wrong and details wrong. I don't care. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's not that I don't care. It hurts me that you you you know, people will defame somebody, a man of God, but I'm willing to bear that reproach. &gt;&gt; I'm willing to bear the reproach. You you you may think, Amen, that we're uneducated and we don't know the Bible very well and we listen to a man who can't pronounce the long words in his Bible. I'm willing to bear that reproach and I esteem that greater riches. I'd rather stand beside, Amen, that ministry. Amen. And I'm not talking about the flesh, man. I'm talking about the ministry that came through. I'd rather stand alongside that and be called whatever I'm going to be called than to be the king of the whole wide world and have every bit of wealth. Amen. Because that is all that matters to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, when Christ is made flesh and dwelling in a many membered body, listen, he's in a ragtag bunch of people from every walk of life. Amen. And some of us are good-looking and some of us are not. &gt;&gt; Some of us are educated, some of us are not. Some of us are witty, some of us are not. &gt;&gt; Some of us have a good personality, some of us don't. Yes. &gt;&gt; Some of us are easy to get along with. Some of us are not easy to get along with. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of us just skip through life barely making mistakes. Some of us are constantly falling into mistakes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But I'd rather stand with you than any people on this earth. I'd rather tell you I love you. I love you. I love you and you I love you in all your flaws. &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses is out. Amen. walking with these people and and and and and and Balam takes Baleo takes Balam around to the backside and starts criticizing and pointing out and he finds the backside of the camp and he says, "Look what they're doing over there. Look what they're doing over there. Look what they're doing over there. There's no way God can bless this if I point out enough flaws among the people. Surely you can give them a curse." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, he pointed out all the flaws among the people. And listen, that wasn't hard to do. That's right. I &gt;&gt; mean, God points them out in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Points out all the f Listen, that's easy work. &gt;&gt; If you just stand with a tablet of paper in the back of the church for a couple services, &gt;&gt; I bet you can fill it up. &gt;&gt; They go to the bathroom too many times. They don't have their children under control. He fell asleep. &gt;&gt; He doesn't say amen loud enough. He says amen too loud. He's trying to get attention. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all of that may be true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But after he pointed all out, Ba Balam who had a true gift but was a false vessel. When that gift went into operation, all he could say was, "How glorious are thy tents, oh Jacob. How beautiful thou are." Amen. The star shall rise out of Judah. All he could say was what God saw. Amen. And it wasn't that God was blind to their faults and their failures, but God was looking at something else. And it was the promise of his word and it was the word in them. And God was looking at something more than just the tangible flesh. &gt;&gt; It is so easy to p point out flaws in any group of people on the planet. &gt;&gt; Go to any group where human beings are gathered and it doesn't take long. No sir. &gt;&gt; They may seem like angels on your first visit. &gt;&gt; Right, brother Paul? &gt;&gt; But you visit about five or six times and you'll see a backside to Israel. Can you testify that's true, brother? &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't name any names. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. It's easy to be a critic. &gt;&gt; Yes. But you know, it takes a different set set of eyeballs &gt;&gt; to see what's behind the veil &gt;&gt; to see what is it that's the attraction. Listen, Moses wasn't a perfect person either. And it looks like Moses, he he forsook Egypt. He's a hero. Now listen, Moses has faults and failures and got upset and drew attention to himself. And Moses did all kinds of things that he could do. But there was another force inside Moses driving him to this word. Amen. Driving him to his brethren, driving him back. Amen. And he didn't want to go. and he met the pillar of fire, but there was something in him that was moving him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And listen, we make we make mistakes and and we got all kinds of things that I there there's I wish that God would allow me to reshape myself. &gt;&gt; But I don't have that option. &gt;&gt; I got to deal with it. &gt;&gt; You've got to deal with it. &gt;&gt; And I've got to deal with you. &gt;&gt; But I'm happy to. Amen. &gt;&gt; I consider it a privilege. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if this is where God wants to manifest himself in a people upon the earth, then I want to be identified them and their faults, their foils, their failures, their successes, the highs and the lows. I want to be where God is working. I want to be where there's a people feasting on the lamb. I want to be where Christ is honored, where his word is respected, where he's wanted above everything else. That's where I want to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can we bear the reproach &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; of one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That might just be part of the reproach of Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise God. What is it we're feeding on, friends? &gt;&gt; The body word. &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; The word. The body word of the Son of Man. We're feasting on it. We love it. We want it. &gt;&gt; Others will throw it in a rubbish bin, but we want it. &gt;&gt; Others will reject it and call it unsaavory names, but we want it. &gt;&gt; Others will chalk it up as a bunch of strange people with strange ideas, but I want it. &gt;&gt; And if I have to be labeled strange person with strange ideas, then so be it. cuz this is worth more to me than a a title &gt;&gt; than the respect of man than than fellowship with the world. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. We're going to be outcast eventually anyway. So, praise God. Now, that's the introduction. Preaching. But after I was meditating on all that, I started getting into this that I'm going to start sharing with you now. And this is why I I titled this the value of Christ to me to me personally. Said, I'm asking you as an individual, what do you do with the blood of Jesus Christ? What will you do with this anointed word of God that's right before us today that we know is to be is the Christ, the promise of the hour? What will you do with it? That's the question. Now it's identified. We know what it is. But what will we do with it? That's the question. And the message is what shall we do with this Jesus called Christ? That's a good question. Says, "And Christ is the word, the anointed word made manifest." That way nobody has any misunderstanding to what Christ is. Christ is the word, the anointed word made manifest. So if I'm going to bear the reproach of Christ, then I need to find the anointed word made manifest. &gt;&gt; If I'm going to feed on Christ and drink from Christ, I need to find the anointed word made manifest. &gt;&gt; He says, "And so is he on your hands." See, you know what I'm talking about. Not only you, but this tape, he's on your hands. What are you going to do with him? This Jesus called Christ. Christ is the anointed word. See, what are you going to do with it? It's the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; This message is Christ. &gt;&gt; It's not books. It's not recordings. All of that contains the word of the Lord. Amen. But the word of the Lord is Christ. &gt;&gt; It's the anointed word. Amen. being fleshed out in this hour coming into a manifestation in people. That word was brought from the mind of God, brought through the lips of a prophet to be the spoken word of God. But that spoken word of God had to go to a resting place. It had to find a place. And remember Isaiah spoke the word of God. The thought of God came into Isaiah and spoke through Isaiah's lips, "A virgin shall conceive." And brother Brandham said that word circled and circled the earth waiting to find a place to land. And finally it found a place in the virgin womb of Mary. Amen. And then that word became a manifestation inside of her and produced the son of God. &gt;&gt; But this message is the spoken word of God. Amen. And it may be going round and round the earth for the last 50 or 60 years looking for a place to land. But I want to be the place for it to land. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's Christ. Amen. It's the word for today. And it's landing in the hearts of his children. Yes, &gt;&gt; it's the message of the hour. And that the the the children of God are receiving that spoken word. And when they receive the spoken word, they're eating the lamb. They're feeding on Christ. They're they're eating his body word. &gt;&gt; The word that's been made flesh, the word that's come, amen, and been spoken. Now, they're taking and eating that word. And as they eat that word and they drink that blood, receive the life of the word, now that word comes into them and becomes their life. And when it hits their soul, amen, it begins to grow the seed gene of God that's on the inside. And it begins to reproduce that word again in human form in bodies. And that's the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; That's Christ in you, the hope of glory. He's coming through a spoken word to find a resting place in a virgin womb that's been washed by the water of the word and brought back to a virgin condition so that you can feast on the lamb to receive the seed and bring forth what? The word into manifestation &gt;&gt; when you ladies choose to dress like a Christian to represent Christ in female form and not dress like the world and get rid of the fashions of the world but dress as a Christian woman. That's the word in this hour made flesh. When you men take the leadership over your homes, amen, and you train up your children the way they should go and you bring your home and subject to the word, that's the word being fleshed out in this hour. &gt;&gt; What is that? That's Christ. &gt;&gt; The message. &gt;&gt; Christ is the message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. and we're feeding on it, receiving it, becoming one with it so that it can bring us into the manifestation of Christ &gt;&gt; in our lives. &gt;&gt; And the reproach of that is greater riches to me than all the treasure of Egypt. &gt;&gt; To be misunderstood because of that. &gt;&gt; That's right. Listen, it doesn't mean because we are willing to bear the reproach of Christ versus anything in the world, it doesn't mean that we say it feels good or it's nice. I like that. Do that again to me. I don't think any of us as human beings feel that way. We get we get hurt. We get stepped on. Sometimes we get offended. Sometimes we we we we are so misunderstood. But don't ever forget Jesus was misunderstood &gt;&gt; when he was on this earth. They didn't understand him. They didn't understand what he's talking about. They didn't understand his life. And they falsely accused him of so many things. &gt;&gt; And if they did that to my Lord, why can't why wouldn't I expect them to do it to me? &gt;&gt; He said, "If they call the master be elabove, what will they call the servants? I say, "Lord, if that's a reproach I have to bear, then I bear it." &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't bear it begrudgingly, but I count it greater riches. &gt;&gt; Greater riches. &gt;&gt; I'll take the disrespect for the word &gt;&gt; versus respect for anything else. &gt;&gt; Because the examples in the contrast The contrast is bearing the reproach of Christ versus the riches, the treasures of Egypt. Now, how big is that contrast, friends? I'm thinking Moses day. &gt;&gt; How rich was Egypt? &gt;&gt; What did Egypt have? Egypt had everything. But he would take the reproach of the lowest over the riches of the highest. And that's the contrast. I would rather be mocked. I would rather somebody say what you believe is heresy. I'd rather take that than somebody say, "I really respect you because you're really good at this task or that task." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which would you rather have? I'll take the reproach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is good, friends. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bram asked the question. We know what Christ is. We know what the body word of the Son of Man. We know how to eat Christ and drink Christ, the spiritual drink and the spiritual food and be partakers of it. And we know that it's the message of the hour. But now he says, "What are you going to do with it? &gt;&gt; What is the value of it?" That's what Moses expressed. Moses expressed the value of the word to him. The value of the word to him was more valuable than riches and prestige and power. So the question is, what is the value of Christ to me? What is it more valuable than to me? In Mark chapter 10, he says, "And when he's gone forth into the way, there came one running, kneelled to him, and asked him, good master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? And Jesus said unto him, why callst thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God. Thou knowest the commandments, do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness, defraud not, honor thy father and mother." And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth. When Jesus beholding him, loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest. Go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come, take up the cross, and follow me." And he was sad at the saying, and went away grieved, for he had great possessions. We know this story is the story of the rich young ruler. And brother Brandham preaches it several places, but one is leadership. And he contrasts Moses' life with the life of this rich young ruler. And this young man comes to him uh and and he says, "I've done all the deeds and I've I've done everything the religion requires and my priest has said and what Moses I've done all of that." But it says Jesus beholding him loved him. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what Jesus is getting ready to tell him is love. &gt;&gt; But the rich young ruler didn't receive it as love. &gt;&gt; Jesus beholding him loved him and said, "One thing thou lackest, sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven." &gt;&gt; And then he says, "Take up thy cross and follow me." &gt;&gt; That is another contrast. &gt;&gt; Amen. from a rich young ruler to a criminal crucified on a cross to sacrificing your life, from living your life to sacrificing your life, from the top to the bottom. And Jesus is asking this man to make that transition and make that choice from the top to the bottom. That's what he's asking him. Sell all that thou has and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven. This man, no matter what he said, he called Jesus good and master, but no matter what he says to Jesus, he shows how much he values the word. &gt;&gt; His actions declare the value he has on Jesus Christ, the word made flesh. Because when Jesus says this, you ask me what to do, this is what you need to do. Sell all that you have, give to the poor, and you'll have treasure in heaven. Listen, if this man loved God, loved the word, loved heaven, he would sell everything for heaven &gt;&gt; because heaven's more valuable than anything on the earth. But he valued the earth more than heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then on top of all of that, take up your cross, bear a reproach &gt;&gt; and follow me. And he was sad at the saying and went away grieved because he had great possessions. This is a sad story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz the man has come to God in flesh. &gt;&gt; He's come to the fresh mana to the word for his day through the through the rock where water can flow out. He's come to this point &gt;&gt; and he says, "What must I do to inherit eternal life?" And Jesus tells him exactly what he must do. He has the ticket. He has the answer. There's no question mark. If he does what God tells him to do, he will have the results Jesus promised him. Amen. And so this man, he left sad. Oh my goodness. How could he leave sad? I would leave so happy. Amen. I now know what I got to do. And all I got to do is give up the world and have him. All I got to do is give up my life and sacrifice myself. And if I'll do that, I can have him and I can have eternal life and I can be where he is. Why was he sad? He should have been running away, clicking his heels, calling an auctioneer on the way. Will you come and help me sell everything I've got? Call the Salvation Army and say, "I need you to help me distribute these goods because I found the way to have what my heart's craving." Amen. &gt;&gt; He went away sad because he gave lip service to loving God, lip service to wanting heaven. But what he really wanted more, he valued more his fleshly carnal life than eternal life. &gt;&gt; God help me never to find myself in this place where I value something of this world more than I value eternal life, more than I value Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Because remember, eternal life is not a reward. Eternal life is a person. &gt;&gt; It's the person of God himself because only God has eternal life. Zoe life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God be praised. Be praised. Be praised. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us Lord is all I can say. &gt;&gt; We're going to find as we carry on. &gt;&gt; Yes. This man, though he's a rich young ruler, though he was a good boy all of his life, though he looked good in the community and had a good reputation and good good, he had a good reputation at church and he had a good reputation in business. He had a good reputation everywhere. &gt;&gt; But he wasn't willing to bear the reproach of poverty in the cross &gt;&gt; for Christ. To me, it shows there was nothing inside to drive him &gt;&gt; because he the decision he made was the most logical decision to a carnal mind that doesn't have eyes to see eternal. &gt;&gt; In Philippians 3, Paul says, "But what things were gained to me? Those I counted lost for Christ. Yay doubtless and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I've suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ. Here's another rich young ruler. Amen. But when he come in contact with the pillar of fire and the pillar of fire told him what he must do. He did it exactly as he said because he was willing to count everything else that he lost as dung &gt;&gt; that he might win Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. to him. It all of a sudden everything that was important to Saul, his prestige, his reputation, his education under Galio, his letter from the high priest, whatever his ambition was in the church and amongst the Jews for leadership, whatever it was that he had, whatever was important to him, when he met the living word, the present tense Jesus Christ, Amen, displaying himself to him, he was willing to give up all of this for this because there was something down inside of him. He was a predestinated seed of God. It wasn't logic. It wasn't mental powers. It wasn't sitting down on a calculator and saying, "Well, if I do this and I'll have this and this is worth more than that." He wasn't calculating, friends. There was something inside of him that said, "That's what I want. That's what I want. That's what I want." &gt;&gt; And it drove him all of his life &gt;&gt; to take the way with the Lord's despised view. It drove him all of his life to rejection and heartache and pain and a cross every day of his life. He said, "I die daily." &gt;&gt; What was driving him? It wasn't a man's mental powers. It was something of God on the inside that when he came in contact with the living word, he began to feed from that spiritual rock. Drink from the rock. Feed from the word. And it transformed his life. And all he wanted was that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To win Christ. And everything became the equivalent of dung &gt;&gt; manure, &gt;&gt; waste. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What an example we have, friends. &gt;&gt; Colossians 3 says, "If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ siteth on the right hand of God. Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. That's what I want. Set my affections on things above, not on the Listen. Listen. I'm not preaching this to talk you into something. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to get you to behave better. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to get you to not focus so much time on work before. Listen, that's a drive that comes from inside. That's something that God placed there before the foundation of the world. I'm only reminding you of who you are and telling you what God's done and showing you what's the most important things in life to snap us back to our real understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not preaching a message for somebody to conform to. It's impossible for you to conform, amen, to the preaching. Amen. You have to be transformed by the preaching. It has to be something inside that comes to life. I'm not telling you this to shape you up. Amen. And make you something that you're not. I'm here to bring to life what's on the inside so that something inside of you begins to bubble up and say that's exactly what I want. That's exactly what I want. &gt;&gt; I want Christ and I want everything else to become dung to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. To me, that's what this message did to me. When I heard this message, it made everything else secondary. It made everything else uh unimportant to me. The only thing that mattered now was this message. I had found God. I found the truth. I knew what was real. I knew what was right. And I come in contact with the living Jesus Christ. And nothing else mattered. &gt;&gt; God, help me stay in that first love. That's my prayer. Let me stay right there where I was willing to give up anything, be called anything, talk to anybody about the word, no matter what the reaction was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, forgive us for becoming lazy. God, forgive us for becoming comfortable. God, help us to stay in that place. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. That's my prayer for me. &gt;&gt; That's why this message is what is the value of Christ to me, &gt;&gt; to me personally. In Philippians 3 says, not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ. Brethren, I counten on myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, I reach forth into those things which are before. I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Listen, Paul never lost his first love and his first desire. Here he is all the way in the book of Philippians and he's still saying, "Listen, everything that's before I count it loss. I'm pushing it to the back, but I'm striving for Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded. &gt;&gt; If in anything you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you. &gt;&gt; Do you see it, friends? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, listen. It doesn't mean that we get this perfect. If in anything you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you. Oh, God comes along and has a way of bringing us back to attention, bringing us back to our first love, waking us back to our real desires. &gt;&gt; It's not that we don't get distracted from time to time and we get distracted. Amen. Things happen to us. But I'm so thankful that Paul said, "Amen. As those that are perfect, mature, let's be thus minded." And if in any if in anything, any little detail, any area of life, you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nevertheless, where until we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule. Let us mine the same thing. &gt;&gt; So in any area you've already attained, you just keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; Amen. No sitting down, no resting, no giving up. Now, I want to take us back to the book of Deuteronomy. I've got a slide here I'm going to show you. And there's something that Moses said that was so astounding to me. Moses keeps telling the children of Israel over and over. He says, "Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul." And he tells them two, three, four times that you are to love, keep his commandments and love him. Love him and keep his commandments. Love him with all your heart and with all your soul. &gt;&gt; And he's commanding them to love the Lord. But listen to what he says in this commandment in Deuteronomy 30. And the Lord thy God will bring thee into a land which thy fathers possessed. And thou shalt possess it, and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers. And the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart &gt;&gt; and the heart of thy seed to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, that thou mayest livest. &gt;&gt; He's commanded them, love God with all your heart. Love God with all your soul. Love God and keep his commandments. But he gave them a promise that when you come into this land, the Lord, the Lord thy God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your seed to love the Lord with all thine heart, with all thy soul. Hey, listen. If you're struggling with the world, you're struggling with the things of the world. Come into the land. The land is the word. Amen. That's been open to us. Come into your possession. come into the land and raise your hands to God and say, "Circumcise my heart and the heart of my sin that I might love you with all my heart and with all my soul." &gt;&gt; This isn't something we do by ourselves. This isn't something we do by our own strength. But we're dependent on God to come with the power of circumcision. Amen. Which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which will cut away the flesh of our lives and bring us into new life. &gt;&gt; Amen. so that we can that so that we have the ability, the capability to love him with all of our heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With all of our soul. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I say, God, circumcise my heart. &gt;&gt; Circumcise it aresh today. Circumcise it every morning when I rise, Lord, because I need that power. Amen. Of circumcision to bring out of me that love &gt;&gt; for you. take away. &gt;&gt; Matthew 22 says, "Master, which is the greatest commandment in the law?" &gt;&gt; Jesus said unto him, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment." &gt;&gt; So what is the greatest commandment? To love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy mind. He He told you what the greatest commandment was. The problem is in your flesh, you can't keep that commandment. &gt;&gt; But you need a circumcision of the heart. &gt;&gt; And if the Lord will circumcise when we come into the land, it will circumcise our heart, &gt;&gt; we'll be able to love him with all of our heart &gt;&gt; and with all of our soul. &gt;&gt; That's what I want, friends. I want that fresh circumcision every day of my life. &gt;&gt; Listen, the world is grabbing at you. &gt;&gt; Well, it's grabbing at me. Maybe it's not grabbing at you. But brother Bam said we have a sticky cocker burn nature that comes from hybridization. &gt;&gt; And that spirit that's of the world and a sticky cocka burn nature. Amen. It gets sticky. Things want to stick to it. It wants to cling to things of the world and things of the world want to cling to it. And he says you'll have a sticky cocker nature that will bother you all of your life. And so we have to be aware of that. But oh, I thankful that there's a genuine wheat seed down on the inside and there's a circumcision of the heart. Amen. That can shed off the things that are sticking to me. Amen. And something else sticks to me. May God bring that to my attention. Amen. So that I'm not otherwise minded. So that God will reveal even this to me. So that I can shake off something else that's trying to stick to me. So that everything else becomes dung and he becomes everything to me. &gt;&gt; That I might win Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to look at this scripture here as well. Oh my goodness, this is one of my favorites. 2 Samuel 24:24 says, "And the king said unto Aaron, black screen, I want to set up this story. This is where David numbers the people and brings a curse upon the people. And the angel of the Lord's going out with a pestilence, killing 70,000 of the Israelites. And and finally, he stops him over Israel. And David begins to repent. And he throws himself in the breach. And he says, "Lord, let this be upon me and upon my house, but not upon these sheep. What have they done wrong?" And God sends Gad the prophet to him and says, "Now go over to the stretching floor where the angel stopped and and offer unto God a sacrifice there and it'll appease God." So he comes to this man and this man, I can't pronounce his name, Aronah or whatever. He comes to him and he says, "I've come to offer sacrifice to the Lord. I'm here to buy of you the threshing floor and all of that." And Areron says, "No, my lord, take it of me. I give it to you as a gift. Take it and offer it." And this is what David says. David says, "Nay, but I will surely buy it of thee at a price. Neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing." &gt;&gt; So David bought the threshing floor for an auction for 50 shekels of silver. Listen, this was the problem with the rich young ruler. &gt;&gt; He He wanted to offer to God what he already had. He already had the He had a good temperament. He had a good understanding. He knew the law. He was good in church. He was already able to keep the commandments. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he wanted to offer to God what he was already able to pay. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But didn't cost him everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. He wanted worship that was easy. Service that was easy. Eternal life that was easy. &gt;&gt; But when God says, "No, lose your life. Give up everything. Take up your cross. Take the way of the despised view. Come by the way of reproach." He said, "No, I don't want that." And he went away sad because he had great possessions. Amen. But here here comes Moses along and Moses has everything and more that this rich young ruler ever had. But he's willing to give it all up that he might bear. He might he might esteem the reproach of Christ's greater riches. Praise God. &gt;&gt; I love that. That's a child of God. &gt;&gt; That's Listen, that's not a great man. That's not a superhuman being. That's a child of God. &gt;&gt; That's as simple as an offspring of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And here comes David. Now, David has this plague breaking out and God comes to him. The seer says, "Listen, what you need to do is just offer an offering to God. And if you if you go and build an altar and offer an offering, God will stay his hand. And so he goes to this man who owns the threshing floor. And listen, this is uh what a trap. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What a trap in life. &gt;&gt; The trap in life is all you have to do is this. &gt;&gt; Just take what I hand you. It's easy. Just take this and offer that to the Lord. That was a trap for David. It didn't look like a trap. It looked like the generosity of this man. &gt;&gt; It looked like piety. But David said, "God forbid that I would ever offer a sacrifice to God that cost me nothing. &gt;&gt; Oh, let me be let that be the way that I serve God." Amen. I don't want to give him what cost me nothing, but let me give him my whole life. Let give him something that cost me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you know that we offer to God the sacrifices of praise from these lips? &gt;&gt; But you know there's days in your life that you're having the worst day of your life and everything goes wrong and you're depressed and you're in the dumps and you feel miserable and you want to die and go on to the sixth dimension. Has anybody lived in a day like that where you wish God just let me leave the earth today? &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. When you come to church and the music's good and the song is good and everybody's clapping their hands and you sing, that's one thing. But when you get to the lowest of the lowest of the lowest that you've ever felt and you say, "Hey, God is good &gt;&gt; and worthy to be praised. Your name is high above all names." That's a sacrifice of praise, friends, because you praised him not because you felt like praising him. You didn't praise him because everything was going right. You didn't praise him because he gave you good gifts. You praised him because he was worthy to be praised. And that's a sacrifice of praise. I don't want to give God something that cost me nothing. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Malachi together. Turn with me to Malachi. Malachi chapter 1. My goodness. Malachi chapter 1 verse 6 says, "A son honorth his father and a servant his master? If then I be a father, where is my honor? And if I be a master, where is my fear? Sayeth the Lord of hosts unto you, oh priests that despise my name." And you say, "Wherein have we despised thy name?" You offer polluted bread upon my altar, and you say, "Wherein have we polluted thee?" In that ye say, the table of the Lord is contemptable. And if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And if you offer the lame and the sick, is it not evil? Offer it now unto thy governor, will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person, sayeth the Lord of hosts? Jesus is saying to them, "Listen, you give your father's honor. You give fear to your masters, but you give to me leftovers. &gt;&gt; You give to me bread that is corrupt, bread that is stale, bread that is going old, and you offer it to me on my tables." &gt;&gt; He said, "Here, you offer the blind for sacrifice." What was their offerings in that day? Their offerings were a lamb, a goat, a turtle dove, an oxen. And instead of bringing God the very best animal that they could produce, they started taking what they wanted to call out of their herds, what wasn't very good anymore. Amen. This one's blind. &gt;&gt; Let's go sacrifice that to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because in that day, it was an agricultural society. Everything was based off the strength, the genetic strength of your herd. And you always wanted good genetics to make good genetics to have strong healthy animals. That's where wealth came from in that day. Amen. And all of a sudden he says, "You offer to me the blind." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he says this, "You offer the lame and the sick." He said, "Go to your governor. Go to the magistrate in the city. go to the governor and you offer him a sick lamb or a lame lamb or a blind lamb and see if he's pleased with you. &gt;&gt; What were they doing? They lost heart for God. They were going through the ritual by commandment and they were taking the least of what they had. What cost them the least is what they were giving to God. What was worthless in their heart and what was no good and liable to die, they went ahead and offered that because we have to give something to God. So I'll give them what? &gt;&gt; This was the condition they were in when Malachi was speaking to them. He said, "Now verse 9, and now I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us. This hath been by your means will will he regard your person, sayeth the Lord of hosts. Who is there even among you that would shut the door for not? Neither do you kindle fire on my altar for not. I have no pleasure in you, sayeth the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. For from the rising of the sun, even to the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering. For my name shall be great among the heathens, sayeth the Lord of hosts. But ye have profained it, and that you say, The table of the Lord is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even as meat, is contemptable. You said also, "Behold, what a weariness is it?" &gt;&gt; What was wearing them? Having to serve the Lord, having to go to the temple, having to take a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; It became weariesome. You have snuffed at it, sayeth the Lord of Hosts. You brought that which was torn and the lame and the sick. Thus you brought an offering. Shall I accept this of your hand? Sayeth the Lord. But cursed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male and voweth and sacrifice unto the Lord a corrupt thing. For I am a great king, sayaeth the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen. &gt;&gt; What a deceiver. You make a vow and you pledge your vow. You go and bring an animal and you've got a worthy male sitting there. Amen. You've got a nice handsome animal. You've got something that can bring bring forth godly pro or good progeny. It's strong. It's male. It's in its strength. And you won't take that. But you'll bring a corruptible thing. You'll bring something that's sick and lame. What is this? This is a religious work that cost them nothing. &gt;&gt; Expecting to get something back from God. &gt;&gt; And David had enough wits to say, "How dare I make a sacrifice that cost me nothing?" Right. &gt;&gt; The whole way. You know, God in his great mercy, he set up a tabernacle. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to do that. &gt;&gt; He did it because of love. He wanted to dwell in their midst. And he made a way for them to have forgiveness of their sins even before Christ came. &gt;&gt; And that forgiveness of sins would come by bringing a sacrifice to atone for their sins by bringing a lamb or a goat or a turtle dove. Amen. bringing something that would becomes their substitute and they can make sacrifices and peace offerings and transgressions offerings and offerings for iniquity and offerings on feast day. And it was God's grace and God set up the three main feasts that they all had to gather around Jerusalem for. And those feast days were a time for them to feast with God. &gt;&gt; It wasn't God's feast. God listen, they would bring their sacrifice on those feast days. They would give their sacrifice. Part of it would be burnt on the altar. Part of it would go to the priests and part of it they would take back to their camp and they would all sit around Jerusalem and they would all feast on the sacrifice and it was symbolic that they were feasting with God himself in their midst and he gathered them to a feast day so that he can join them in their feast. &gt;&gt; What a blessing. &gt;&gt; No other nation had this. Nobody had this opportunity but to them it became &gt;&gt; weariesome. We got to go back to the feast of Passover. &gt;&gt; We got to do it every year. &gt;&gt; We got to find another lamb. What lamb should we take? Dad, that one over there, it's had a limp for a while and it's probably not going to get any better. &gt;&gt; I was going to put it down anyways. &gt;&gt; That's what they started offering him. And the feast became a weariness and they become tired of serving the Lord. And this was the grace of God in their lives. and they they didn't value the thing that God had gave them. &gt;&gt; God forbid we treat the message this way. This is the greatest thing that God could have given us. Amen. The opportunity. Amen. The opportunity to hear the pure word of God. Amen. And what do we give it? Amen. Uh do we worship God with no sacrifice? Do we give it five minutes a day, 10 minutes a day, Sunday, Wednesday, when we're not tired? &gt;&gt; Do we come to hear the live preaching of the word? the preaching of the message. Has it become weariness? &gt;&gt; Has Wednesday become wearing to you? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Has Sunday become exhausting? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Has daily devotions and prayer time in the morning become we weariesome? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; God help me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm standing in the need of prayer, friends. I want to go back to my first love where nothing on this earth matters. If I lose friends, if I lose jobs, if I lose reputation, this is the most precious thing that God has ever given to me. And everything else is done compared to this. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God tell God tells us, "Don't forsake the assembling together of yourselves." &gt;&gt; Do you know what a privilege it is just to keep his word? &gt;&gt; But for some, it's become wear. Yes. &gt;&gt; God gave us three sacraments. &gt;&gt; Only three. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, look at what they had. &gt;&gt; Offerings of this and offerings of that and feast days of this. Three sacraments. &gt;&gt; Water baptism in Jesus name. Communion and feet washing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's only asked us to do three things. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To keep three ordinances. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you know what a privilege it is to keep those? That's right. &gt;&gt; Has it become weariness? Has it become too hard to come together once a month and take communion, &gt;&gt; feet washing? I say, "God, help us. &gt;&gt; Help us. I'm not going to offer to him what does cost me nothing. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter if I'm tired. I'm coming anyways. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter if I feel out of sorts. I'm coming anyways." Amen. What if I got something in my life, amen, that's keeping me from communion? then let's deal with it and not let it keep us &gt;&gt; from one of the things that God told us to do. &gt;&gt; Listen, has serving the Lord in this message become weariness? &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; No way, friends. Let's not let it become weariness. Amen. If we're any other minded, may God bring this revelation to our hearts anyways. But there's nothing more precious than serving God. There's nothing more wonderful than knowing what he wants us to do and doing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care if it cost me. Let's do it. &gt;&gt; There's been people who have taken jobs. Amen. Knowing that's going to take them out of church or move them where there's no church. They'll do that because the job has become more important than keeping the commandment. &gt;&gt; And and I hear it all the time. People tell me, "Well, I don't have to go to church to be saved." No, you don't have to go to church to be saved. God saves you by faith and faith alone. Nothing else, no works. &gt;&gt; That's right. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But if he says, "Forsake not the assembling together yourselves," what does your heart want to do? Where is the seed driving you? &gt;&gt; Amen. To the word. To the word. To the word. &gt;&gt; ABC's one, two, threes, algebra, calculus, all of it. I want to live and I don't want any of it to become weariness to me. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Listen, I don't want to get tired of dealing with you &gt;&gt; and I don't want you to get tired of dealing with me &gt;&gt; because God put us together for iron to sharpen iron. Amen. And let's just love one another more. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to get weary and being part of a body. Weary and being in fellowship, weary and having to repent, and weary and having to forgive. &gt;&gt; How are you going to have a family? How are you going to have a marriage? Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't get weary in repentance and weary in forgiveness and wearing and dealing with one another. &gt;&gt; I don't want to offer to God something that cost me nothing. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be the rich young ruler and looking for the easy way. But oh God, help me to give whatever of myself I can give. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For you. &gt;&gt; I want to be like David. You may say, "Oh, well, all you have to do is this, brother. Just believe this and just do this and do." I don't want all I have to do. I don't want Aaron to hand me everything on a platter and just do this and you've got it. &gt;&gt; I want to be like David. I don't want to serve God with something that cost me nothing. &gt;&gt; I want to give my life to this gospel. &gt;&gt; And listen, don't think I'm I'm talking about creating trouble. Don't go create trouble. That doesn't make any sense. &gt;&gt; But it comes. There's difficulties. There's weariness. There's depression. There's setbacks. There's times that you get floored. There's times you get disappointed. There's times you get hurt. But I want to serve God anyhow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to keep his word anyways. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I want to show him not with a lame sacrifice, but I want to take the best I got out of my flock and give it to him. &gt;&gt; Not if I have spare time, if I'm not busy, if I'm not already tied up, if I haven't made other plans. &gt;&gt; No, I want to give him the best that I got &gt;&gt; because I'm honored that he would even tell me what he wants and give me the opportunity to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm honored that he gave me three sacraments. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; At least there's something I can do to show you I love you. &gt;&gt; I'm honored that he told me not to forsake the assembling together. I'm honored that I have something I can do to show that I love him and reverence him. &gt;&gt; I'm just privileged. I'm honored to do something for my Lord. Brother Ram tells this story. He says, "Oh man, in the message forsaking all, he says, I read a little article in the paper the other day where an old man, he was both deaf, dumb, and blind, and he went to Sunday school every Sunday." And they asked him in Braille, said, "Why do you go to church? You can't hear what the preacher said. You can't hear none of the songs. Why do you go to church?" He said, "I just want to let everybody know what side I'm on. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I just want to let the devil and everybody else know that he what side he's on. I think that's good. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Listen, this man didn't go to church to get something out of church. &gt;&gt; Cuz he didn't get anything out of it. He went to prove his love for God and prove to devil he loves God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; New side he's on. &gt;&gt; You know, we go through slumps and I've heard it so many times. I'm not going there cuz I'm not getting fed. So you quit following the word because you're not being fed. &gt;&gt; So who are you serving? &gt;&gt; Yourself or God. &gt;&gt; If you're not being fed, find a place that you're being fed. Go to church. But don't forsake the word because you don't feel like it that day &gt;&gt; because then who becomes God? My feelings become the God I worship. Because I'll lay down the word for my own feelings. That means I worship my feelings more than I worship God. Right. &gt;&gt; This man wasn't getting something out of it. He was giving something. &gt;&gt; Amen. We go to church so many times selfishly to get something. Amen. Why don't we come to give something? Amen. I'm here to give praise to God. I'm here to give worship to God. I'm here. Hey, listen. If I have to suffer through a bumbling, fumbling preacher who can't do anything, it doesn't matter. I'm going to say amen. If the only thing I can say amen to is when he reads the scripture, I'll say amen when he reads the scripture. Because I want God to know I love him and I love his word and I'm here in obedience to his word. I'm not here because this delighted me. I'm not here because it's the greatest thing that ever happened to me. I'm here in obedience to this word as a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm not just preaching on church attendance. I'm preaching on life, friends. &gt;&gt; So many people get upset at this kind of preaching. But why do we come to church? Brother Brennham said to see our bad parts. We come to get a checkup. We come to find out where the devil's taking advantage of us. We come to find out where we're sulking and sucking our thumb and being babyed and babying ourselves and get back to being rugged Christians that can take the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. When did we become lazy, soft? &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. Don't think I'm preaching to you. I'm preaching to me, too. I get embarrassed of myself. &gt;&gt; Why can't I get out of bed when I want to get out of bed to prayer? Why do I give myself extra time? Why don't I give him extra time? &gt;&gt; Oh, I need to come back to my first love and get my priorities right again and find out who's God and who I am. I'm nothing. He's everything. &gt;&gt; My comfort's nothing. My pleasure is nothing. His pleasure is everything to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we come to church so we we can tell everybody how good you are. &gt;&gt; You're so good. You're so nice. You're so lovely. You're so sweet. You're doing a good job. Thank you for coming today. Why should you be thanked for coming? &gt;&gt; You should be thankful you can come. &gt;&gt; Thankful you have health. Thankful you have a place. Thankful the doors are open. Thankful they haven't closed them yet. Thankful that there's brothers and sisters that want to hear the word. We should be thanking God we get to come. Not being thanked because you showed up today. I'm so glad you're here. Oh, it was so nice for you to come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got the picture completely backwards. &gt;&gt; I want God to be up here and everything about me to be down here. &gt;&gt; I want to take the reproach. Amen. I want to take the low place. &gt;&gt; I want to become nothing &gt;&gt; so he can become everything in my life. &gt;&gt; We get an American leodyian spirit and it creeps into our sticky cobburn nature. And we need broke out of that spirit. &gt;&gt; We all need it. Every one of us need broke out of that every once in a while. &gt;&gt; We need God to come and tell us what's real and what's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What matters the most. &gt;&gt; Quit giving God what's easy. &gt;&gt; Give him what he deserves. &gt;&gt; Get him what he's worthy of. &gt;&gt; Man, we wouldn't give our bosses what we give to God. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Somehow I can't seem to find a way to get to church on time. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it's a good idea to come 30 minutes early and get quiet. Can't do that. &gt;&gt; But yet we'll show up at work on time &gt;&gt; every time because my paycheck depends on that. My performance review depends on that because it serves me. It's the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life. And I'll sacrifice for work. But will I sacrifice for the word of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. How can we give an earthly job more than we give God? &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; God help us. How many want to say, "God, circumcise my heart. &gt;&gt; Circumcise it fresh today that I can love you the way you deserve to be loved. I can love you with all my heart and all my soul and that you can have the first place in my life." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, God is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And instead of going home today and saying that was rubbing, you should go home to say, "Thank you, God. That was exactly what I needed." &gt;&gt; And don't tell me you don't need it because I need it. You need it. Every one of us need it. Cuz we live in Leodysia and a sticky cocker bird nature. And we need to hear what's real. &gt;&gt; We don't need petted and stroked. We need to hear what's real, what's true. Amen. And we need that truth to strike our soul and something inside go ding ding. That's nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; I may not be measuring up and I may be embarrassed about myself right now, but that's still the truth. &gt;&gt; God circumcised my heart. &gt;&gt; Circumcised my heart. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam tells a story and I'm going to finish with this story. says, he says, she gets her coin and stays with it. I can see her put it in her sock. She's talking about a harlot woman, little harlot woman who's trapped in in prostitution and she wants to get out and she's saving all of her money so that she can buy her way out of prostitution. She was sold into it because she was abandoned and sent on the street when she was a little girl. We find her in the Bible and Brother Ben tells us the background of her story. She's got a little sock and she's got a little hidden place there in her room where she hides this sock and she's been dropping these coins in. And how did she earn the coins? By prostitution, but it's the only thing she had is the only choice that she had. And she's saving it up to buy herself a better life and an escape out of this life. And he says, I can see her put it in her sock. She gathered up her clothes, put them around her, and on the street she goes. She goes into a perfume shop, and there's an old Jew fellow sitting there saying, "My why, the business has been bad today. I haven't even made rent." Here comes this woman in he comes out. He doesn't act nice. He says, "And how do you He doesn't say, "How do you do? What could I do for you?" He says, "Well, what do you want?" She said, 'I want the best spike nerd box you've got. Listen to the words. Best. &gt;&gt; Not good, not nice, not precious. &gt;&gt; Best. I want the best spike nerd spike nerd box you got. And she lays the money down. When he hears the clink of the money, oh, that's different. So he said, see how much you got. and he counted out 280 Roman daenery and it's just enough. So he gives it to her. I can hear him say, "Wonder where she's going. Wonder what she's going to do with that." That was the last penny she had and she knew it. She dropped her last penny on this box of ointment. And she knew he was deserving the best. She never said, "Give me a good one." She didn't say, "Give me a good ointment." She said, "Give me the best you got." Praise God. That's what we ought to do. Give him the best there is. &gt;&gt; The youth of our life, the best of your life, the praise of your lips. &gt;&gt; We know this is the woman who anointed Jesus' feet in Simon's house. &gt;&gt; But tells us more of her life. Amen. We know that she was a sinner and she had many sins and and and she saw Jesus there invited but unwelcome &gt;&gt; sitting there. They had done the minimum they could do for him. They had invited him. Sure. They had brought him in and allowed him inside and they had allowed him a seat at the table. That was the minimum that they could do. That's right. &gt;&gt; They didn't anoint him with perfume. They didn't wash his feet. They they didn't embrace him and kiss him. They didn't do any of that. They just did the minimum. And she saw him sitting there with dirty feet, having been received into a home and invited into a home, but nobody served him like he deserved to be served. And this harlot woman, something inside of her, listen friends, this isn't something you teach. this isn't something you're trained into. There was something inside of her that said, "I've got to do him a service. &gt;&gt; I He deserves better than this. He can't sit there like that. I can't allow this to happen." &gt;&gt; She runs back to her room and she takes out the money that she was hoping to change her life with the money that would be her redemption out of prostitution. And she takes and she dumps the whole sockload, every penny, to the last penny to buy the very best ointment that's in that store. and she runs into where Jesus is quickly before they could stop her. Amen. There was something pushing her from within. There was a motivation beyond her brain. There was something in her. She had to get to Christ and she had to give her best to him. And he deserved more than he was getting. &gt;&gt; Listen, he deserves more than he's getting in this world, friends. &gt;&gt; But his name will be greatly declared amongst the heathen. Amen. Amongst the Gentiles. That's us. Amen. And his name's going to be glorified amongst us. She drops at his feet. She begins to weep all over his feet to wash his feet with tears. And she breaks the box open and pours out. I love this scripture. She didn't open it in the corner and dip it out. She broke that thing and poured out everything she had. She gave to Christ to what? To anoint his feet with oil. Oh my goodness. They were sitting in the room and they were saying what a waste this was. This was an absolute waste. That was so expensive. There's so many poor. She's wasting everything. And Jesus said, "She's not wasting anything. &gt;&gt; She's giving me her best." Amen. All that she has, her whole life, and her hope for a future, she's pouring it out at Jesus's feet. And Jesus didn't stop her or call it a waste. I don't think we can ever waste our life serving the Lord. Waste him, waste our time, waste our efforts, waste our money, waste our mind on God. It's a waste. You gave up your job. You refused a promotion because it would take you away from church. You refused this. And you've wasted your opportunity. You've wasted your life. We've wasted nothing. &gt;&gt; Nothing. Never have I wasted one drop that I've poured out in love to God. Amen. To sacrifice for him. And I don't want to give him that which cost me nothing. She pours it out. Brother Ben uses this story again. He says, "He's worthy of the best." What do you do for him? Give him the leftover. Oh yes, you run around all day and give him three minutes at night before you go to bed. He deserves your best, friends. &gt;&gt; He deserves everything you got. But what do you do about it? You give him just anything. Listen, he takes it. He takes it anyhow. This breaks my heart. Let me fix this. He takes it anyhow. Simon invited him to his house. He came anyways. He didn't welcome him with ointment. He didn't welcome him with perfume or feet washing or embrace. But he came anyways. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He came to his house anyways. He was stuck in the corner. He sat there anyhow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They only gave him partial, but he took it. And I think, what a gentleman Christ is. There's so many times I gave him little, but he received it. &gt;&gt; He took it. A gentleman like that is drawing the best out of me. I don't want to give him little anymore just because he'll take it. &gt;&gt; Said he takes it. But she said, "I want the best." And it cost her everything she had to get the best. That's what you ought to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give your best to give him your best. Give him the best of your life. Give him the best of your songs. Give him all of your talent. Give him everything you got. Give him your feet. Give him your hands. Give him your eyes. Give him your mouth. Give him your ears. Give him your soul. Give him your heart. Give him your praise. Give him everything you got. Hallelujah. He deserves the best. &gt;&gt; How many can say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; He deserves the best of my time. He deserves the best of my mind. He deserves the best of whatever that I can give. He deserves the best. &gt;&gt; In this message here, Brother Bam says she poured the oil upon his feet. The whole room lit up with it. It was costly. There's nothing too good for Jesus. Give him your best. Give him everything you got. Your life, your soul, your being, your time, all that you have. Give it to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know how you feel. But after going through this note, I feel ashamed of myself. &gt;&gt; I feel like I want to do more. &gt;&gt; I feel like I need my heart to be circumcised once again. I feel like the things of the world have gotten too much of my attention and I don't want them to take my attention away from my Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be weariesome in serving God. I don't want it to be tiring. Listen, brother Bam says, "A a Christian prays and reads his Bible every day." Amen. I don't want that to be wear, &gt;&gt; a task on my check off list, something I got to do so I can go on to the rest of my day. I want it to be the greatest pleasure of my life. I want it to be the time that I give to him first before I give to anybody else. I want him to occupy my mind before my phone occupies my mind. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I want to. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because that's the value of Christ to me. &gt;&gt; If you don't want to, that's fine. But I want to. &gt;&gt; I want to give him my first is the first place. I want to give him the best, the most. I want to give him what he deserves. So the value of Christ to me, what's the value of Christ to you? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's the question. &gt;&gt; Brother B said, what will you do with this Jesus called Christ? &gt;&gt; What will we do with him? &gt;&gt; Will we sit him in the corner of our house, invite him, but not really serve him, ask him to come because we want him there because of who he is? That's what Simon wanted. Simon wanted him to come because of his name, because of who he was, and he wanted to brag that he had Jesus in his house. Amen. But he didn't want to serve him. He didn't want to love him. He didn't want to give him the best that he had. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be a Christian because of his name. I don't want to ask him in my life because of who he is. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I want to love him because he deserves it. I want to give him the best because I love him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother said, "Oh, that's what God expects you to give him your best. Not just a little time on the side, but he wants your best. He must have the best." Look at what he wrote in Malachi. Do you think it matters to him? If you don't think it matters, go back and read Malachi 1 &gt;&gt; 6-14. It matters to God. It matters how we love him and how we serve him and how we give to him. It matters to God. And if it matters to him, I want to give him all my love and all my time and all my attention. And if I get out of sorts, I need a redirection. God, redirect me. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying I let's let's think of Paul. I'm not saying that I've already attained, &gt;&gt; but I'm reaching forth &gt;&gt; for that which I'm striving for. &gt;&gt; I'm forgetting the things that in past I'm reaching forward, reaching higher for the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus. And if in anything I'm otherwise minded, may God even reveal this to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to leave you with this. Said, "We are saved by grace." Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; And that through faith, not by works. Works shows that you have been saved. &gt;&gt; But what saves you is the grace of God. Grace saves you. Grace is what God does for you. Works is what you do for God to show appreciation of what God did for you. &gt;&gt; Do we have appreciation for what he did for me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we understand what grace has done for me? Listen, you don't have to come to church to be saved. &gt;&gt; You don't have there. There's nothing you have to do. The only thing you have to do is believe. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But if you believe, your faith will move you to the word of God. &gt;&gt; And because you believe, &gt;&gt; you can't help it. You just believe. &gt;&gt; And faith begins to act and works. And it's our appreciation. Listen, when that little woman come and wash Jesus's feet with that precious ointment, Jesus never looked at her and said, "Your deed has saved you." What did he say? He said, "Your faith has saved you." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She wasn't saved because she poured out the oil. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; That was not her salvation. She was saved because she believed this was Messiah. the present tense word made flesh and that was her salvation. And that's salvation today. &gt;&gt; It's just the same as it was then. &gt;&gt; So why did she pour out the oil? &gt;&gt; Because she believed he was the Messiah and worthy of that kind of worship. &gt;&gt; Are you getting it? &gt;&gt; It wasn't because she gave her money. It wasn't because she pushed her way in. Amen. Through the shame as she felt at all the eyes staring at her and knowing that they were judging her for what she was, but she went through the reproach. That wasn't what saved her. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; The money she spent, the the tears she poured out, the the oil she poured, that was not her salvation. &gt;&gt; Her salvation was that she believed this is the truth. &gt;&gt; He's the one. This is the word. That's what saved her. &gt;&gt; So why did she do all of that? Because she believed this was the one. &gt;&gt; This is him and he's worthy to be praised. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your church attendance won't save you. &gt;&gt; Your taking the sacraments won't save you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You can come to church every time the doors are open. That won't equal salvation. &gt;&gt; You can take the sacraments every chance you get. That won't equal salvation. &gt;&gt; You can dress right, talk right, live right, do right. You can have morning devotions for an hour and a half every morning. That won't save you. &gt;&gt; Salvation is faith alone &gt;&gt; in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we believe that? &gt;&gt; But if I believe that this is Christ, how can I not serve him? &gt;&gt; How can I not give my best? How can I not read his message? How can I not listen to it? How can I not read his Bible? How can I not pray to him? How can I not gather with the saints? &gt;&gt; Brother Beam said, "If God is in your heart, you can't wait for them doors to open." &gt;&gt; And he says, "If you don't feel that way, you better get to praying." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe the prophet was right. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't feel that way. That's true. That's time to get to praying. &gt;&gt; Say, "God, let me see a picture different than what I'm seeing now. Let me see the privilege that I have, the blessing that I have, your goodness in my opportunity just to do one little service to you. One little sacrifice of my time, one little thing you've asked for that I have the privilege to do. Let me see it as a great opportunity to express love back to you. Let me not be weary. Let it not become weariesome to me, but it may become my pleasure to give whatever I can give. Whatever I can do because you're worthy. &gt;&gt; Why? So that he'll save me. No. Brother Bram says you wasn't saved on any day. You was always saved. &gt;&gt; Your name was sealed in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. Good, bad, or indifferent, it was there. &gt;&gt; But I want to do it in appreciation. of what you did for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand together. Musicians, if you'll come. Brother Blake, if you'll make your way up. I pray that I never get so spiritual that I forget to serve him. I pray that I never get so revelated that I don't have to sacrifice my life for him anymore. &gt;&gt; I pray that I never get to that place where I have such a mind of understanding that I fall back on predestination but no longer have a desire to sacrifice my life for him to give him back what he's asked for because I have a revelation of predestination. I don't have to do these things. Well my that's true. You know what? You don't have to. But oh, I think I get to. &gt;&gt; I thank God for whatever it is that I can do. Bear a reproach. Testify of his word. Stand for the truth. Stand with my brother and sister. Fellowship. Whatever it is that I can do, I want to do it with all my heart &gt;&gt; for him. &gt;&gt; Not for me. For him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads together. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, Lord. So thankful, God, that you're still a God who corrects your children. And Lord, as I was awake all night, Lord, thinking of these things, I realized my lack, Lord, where I failed, where I've been distracted, where I've been caught up. And Lord, I'm sorry, Lord. You deserve better than what you've been getting out of me. And I want you to have more. Lord, I pray you come and circumcise my heart again. Lord, circumcise it aresh that I could love you with all my heart and all my soul and all my mind. For God, I need your help, Lord. And God, what I want is you to have my life. I want to take the attitude of Moses. I want to take the approach of the Apostle Paul. I want to follow after the prophet in this age where we sacrifice, where we'll bear reproach, where we'll take being called names. We'll give up our reputation and give up our time. Give up whatever we have to give up for you, Lord. God, I pray you'd come across this congregation. And Lord, if there's any that's found themselves in a place they don't want to be, I pray you'd come and circumcise their heart. A fresh God, as they just pour their heart out to you, Lord, I pray you'd come and pour back into us, Lord, a a ferveny, a first love, a desire, and an opportunity, Lord, that we can see around us to serve you better, Lord Jesus. I don't want to give you what cost me nothing, but I want to give you my life. &gt;&gt; You've given me everything, Lord, and I'm so privileged. I don't want to become nor negligent. And I don't want to become, Lord, dilatory, but I want to be faithful back to you, &gt;&gt; God. There's a desire in my heart, Lord. I feel it bubbling up into the preaching of the word. I don't want to be the rich young ruler. I want to be the Apostle Paul. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be those that walked away when you said, "Eat my flesh and drink my blood." But I want to be of your disciples that said, "To whom will we go? Thou alone has the words of eternal life." God, I don't want to be as the one like Simon who invited you to the house but didn't serve you. I want to be like that harlot who gave everything. It's in my heart, Lord. It's bubbling up. It's my desire. Would you come, Lord, and help me, God? Move away all the trash that's in my life. And awaken me, Lord. Freshen inside of me by that fresh circumcision of my heart. May I give back to you what you deserve, for you deserve it all, Lord, and you deserve much more than I can give. If I had 10,000 lives to serve you and I gave them all for you, it wouldn't be enough for what you deserve. &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord. May you become the object of our worship and the greatest thing in our lives. I ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Help us now, Lord. Amen. Amen. May God bless you. Just want to remind you of communion this afternoon at 4 if you want to come back for that and say, God bless you all. like worthy. You are worthy. King of kings, lord of lords. You are worthy. Worthy. You are worthy. King of kings, Lord of lords, I worship you and worthy. You are worthy, king of kings. Lord of lords, you are worthy. Worthy. You are worthy. King of kings. Lord of lords. I worship you. Holy and holy. You are holy. King of kings, Lord of lords. You are holy, holy. You are holy. King of kings, Lord of lords. I worship you. Amen. Let's sing that other song. And Lord, you are more precious than silver. And Lord, you are more costly than Lord. You are Lord. Beautiful and diamonds and nothing I desire compares with you. Sing it again. And Lord, you are more preious than silver. And Lord, you are more cost than gold. And Lord, you are more beautiful than nothing I desire compares with you. &gt;&gt; Sing it one more time. And Lord, you are more precious than silver. Lord, you are more costly than gold. Lord, you are more beautiful than diamonds. And nothing I desire compares with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'd like to sing that one more time. But let it be a heart craving. Let it be a prayer, Lord, that I recognize there's nothing I desire more than you. And I know in some ways I'm preaching to the choir. You drive hour, 2 hours, 2 and 1/2 hours to come to church. You've sacrificed. You've moved. You've you've given up jobs and families. And I know. And in the past, we did. We drove almost two hours to come to church for years and years with we we did it because something inside of us was driving us, friends. Something was pushing us. It wasn't cuz we had to. It's because we could not help it. We wanted to be there. But I know what it's like to be driven. And I know what it's like to cool off. I know what it's like to that drive then to begin to cool and and have to be revived again. I know what it's like to get weary and get battle scarred and get beat up. And I know what it's like to draw back. I've done it. And sometimes my heart draws back and I don't want it to draw back. Man, I come to church. I have no choice. Amen. Thank God he's taken away my choice cuz it's helped me so much. But I know we all we all go up and we go down and we have good days and bad days. But all friends, there's nothing like serving God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's nothing like giving him our all. There's nothing like worshiping him. There's nothing like going from weeping cuz you're heartbroken and forcing yourself to put a song of praise on your lips and lift your hand. Not because you feel good, but lift your hand and say, "God, you are good." Because he is good. On my worst day, he's worthy of my praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I know what it's like, friends. I know. But oh, may God help us with a fresh circumcision. And may this song become a prayer. It may listen, if things have grown cold, if things have become a little indifferent and if life has knocked you around a bit and you've lost focus a little bit. Amen. Let this be the day that your focus comes back into view and you realize, "Oh, God, don't ever let this slip away. this love for you, this desire to serve you, this ferveny in my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Never let it slip, man. I just encourage you to sing it as a prayer and then pray. Just tell God you love him more than anything. Man, that's my desire. Let's sing this together. will Lord you are more preious than silver Lord. You are more costly than gold. Lord, you are more beautiful than diamonds. And nothing I My desire compares with you. And Lord, you are more precious than silver. And Lord, you are more costly than old and Lord, you are more beautiful than diamonds. Nothing I desire with you. &gt;&gt; Well, now I'm giving my life away. Lay it down the altar. Lord, I'm giving my life away. The very least I can offer is my hope. So here I stand today giving my life away once more. Oh now I'm giving my life away. Lay it down on the altar. Now I'm giving my life away. Oh, the very least I can offer is my hope. And so here I stand today giving my life away too. And no earthly price could be too great. And no sacriice too much to make. No way. Measuring the cost next to the blood of Calary's cross. And so if I live, I live for him. For if I die, I count it gain. My life is not my own, but his from this day on. And now I'm giving my life away. Laying it down on the altar. Now I'm giving my life away. The very least I can offer is my own. So here I stand today giving my life away. I'm giving my life. And now I'm giving my life away. Lay it down on the altar. Lord, I'm giving my life away. Oh, the very least I can offer is my all. So here I stand today giving my life away.
