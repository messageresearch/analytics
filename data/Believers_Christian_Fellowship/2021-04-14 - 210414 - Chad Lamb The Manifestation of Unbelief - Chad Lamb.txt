TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so much to thank him for so much to praise him for you see god has been so good to me and when i think of what he's done and where he's brought me from i've got so much to thank him for well i've got so much to thank him for so much to praise him for you see god has been so good to me and when i think of what he's done and where i've got so much to thank him for one more time well i've got so much to thank him for so much to praise him for you see god has been so good to me and when i think of what he's done and where that he's brought me from i've got so much to thank him [Music] in this we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus christ and we've been made more than conquerors we're overcomers in this life [Music] and we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus christ in this we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus christ he's my lord there is no other one who can calm the storms of life like my lord you'll give rest to the weary give new life to the whole there's no doubt [Music] who can calm the storms of life like my lord there's [Music] [Music] god bless you it's so good to see you this evening and while we're standing together let's take our bibles and turn to first john it's always a pleasure to be here and it's always wonderful to get to worship together amen what is so good to us first john chapter 4 and i'd like to begin at verse 17 for a text tonight i'd like to take a title the manifestation of unbelief and we like to talk about the manifestation of unbelief but i'm going to start with a very odd scripture for that reading but i hope by the time we're done that it it makes good sense to you first john 4 17. hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us let us bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this privilege to be here and god as we've gathered lord we've gathered to worship you to sing your praises to glorify your name and also lord defeat from your word lord you've brought us to your supper table lord may we come now and dine and i pray god that you would break the bread and may our eyes be opened and may we see you as you are may we eat from your hand lord as your lambs may we gain strength lord and may we go out and serve your purpose in this life in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can have your seats amen turn with me to mark chapter four quite a few scriptures we're going to read and again the title is the manifestation of unbelief and we're just going to take it from this angle and keep moving and and ask the lord just to give us some wisdom and revelation in the word as we move forward mark chapter 4 verse 35 in the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and they were also with them other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him master carest thou not that we perish that's a big statement see there was a problem they were having a problem but jesus had already spoke the word he said let us go into the other side so the word had already given the word let us go into the other side so their arrival at the other side was secure by the word the regardless of what the circumstances arose between the fulfillment of the word and the giving of the word never changed the outcome was secure because he said let us go on to the other side and he was the word amen and he was giving the word and they should have been able to rest in that but he was training his disciples through all of these things and so they arose and they asked the pivotal question and i want you to lock onto this question carest thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him so when when jesus told him to go to the other side he knew what was going to happen no doubt he was training his disciples and in their and in the way the storm becomes so bad that they fear for their lives and they wake up the master and and jesus preaches our brother ben preaches on this and he says you know he was in the boat the whole time you know nothing was going to happen they they they failed to recognize in whose presence they were whose presence was among them amen just because he wasn't active and he wasn't animated didn't mean he wasn't still there and sometimes in our lives amen there's times when when god is very active in taking a very active part but there's also quiet times amen and he's going to see what we'll do in the situation and it doesn't mean he's not there just because he's not animated and active to where we can see and tell that he's moving maybe he's just resting for a little piece to see what we'll do but but when they woke him up they insulted him when they woke him up they called him lord and master he had fed them and he had cared for them and he had worked miracles in their lives and he had healed their family members and and he had done all kinds of supernatural things to care for them and to take care of them and to protect them and when they got into the middle of a very very difficult trial amen and they forgot whose presence was with them they woke him up and said don't you even care we could look at those disciples and say you geyser but we do the exact same thing don't you even care that we perish don't you even care that this is happening don't you even care and i would say amen we love him because he first loved us he's already proven his love to us and fear will cat love perfect love will cast out fear and he that feareth is not yet made perfect in love and he hasn't yet realized who it is that loved him first and they woke up jesus christ and insulted him by saying don't you even care that we perish i say when we go to prayer let's not insult god god don't you even care don't you even see what's happening to me of course he sees what's happening to you of course he's present with you of course he cares and jesus turned and he rebuked the wind and the waves and he said peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said to them why are you so fearful now we would look at them in the same situation and say they have every right to be fearful but jesus does not excuse their fear we with human reasoning in a human mind with human emotions we would look at their situation if we had it on camcorder you know if we could go back and watch the whole scene play out we would say i don't fault them enough for being afraid i would have been afraid too amen but jesus didn't excuse it jesus says why were you so fearful he gave them no right and no reason to be so afraid and look what he links it to how is it that you have no faith why were they fearful because they didn't have enough faith and when i talk about the manifestation of unbelief i would like to give as one of the manifestations but the manifestation of unbelief as fear fear as a manifestation of unbelief because that's what jesus tied it to why are you so fearful and how is it that you have no faith because if you had faith you wouldn't be fearful brother brahma says in the message be not afraid 1961 now i thought i thought on tonight a subject of a testimony meeting out of the bible and i want to read for a text out of saint matthew the 14th chapter the 27th verse and straightway jesus spoken to them saying be of good cheer it as i be not afraid now i want to take a subject for this testimony meeting of be not afraid there's two elements that control the entire human race in the world one of them is fear and the other's faith now it's either fear or faith controls every nation every denomination every individual you're either fear or faith that controls you and i don't know about you but i don't want fear to ever control me again i want to be controlled by faith but if i'm going to be controlled by faith then i have to get rid of fear and the only way to get rid of fear is perfect love because perfect love cast out fear and if i can get rid of fear and understand god's love for me amen then i can have faith let's turn to matthew chapter six we want to just read a few examples here and lay these out matthew chapter 6. now when we were looking here in mark chapter 4 we say why were they why were they so fearful and you realize that you know it might have been in the beginning of the storm that they weren't that afraid they had been through storms before they knew jesus was with them and he told them to go to the other side and this is the way it always starts for us you know it's not that bad and we can still handle this and we still have faith amen but but then as the as the storm increased and as the trial got worse amen they begin to have more fear built up inside of them amen and to fear the fear got to a place where the fear brought torment and overrode the love amen until they begin to question whether or not he loved them boy isn't this classic they began to question whether or not he loved them amen and and whether or not he even cared that they were going to perish and so many times that the trip the the trip the the trap i'm sorry that the devil lays for us he brings us into a situation and at first it's okay it'll be all right god will take care of it we even speak positive things like that but as it gets worse and worse and worse amen what happens is as fear builds what's what's happening is the fear is beginning to diminish the love because perfect love cast out fear until we begin to question whether he loves us or not now you may not say that you may not verbalize it but that's what's going on inside and in matthew chapter 6 verse 25 it says therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat in the body more than raiment so in the first mark four when we read we were talking about a very terrifying situation amen and they begin to doubt and they begin to fear and they had anxiety anxiety turned to fear but now we're talking about a different kind of situation this is everyday life he says therefore i send you take no thought for your life don't even worry about what you eat or what you'll drink take notes off of your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you should put on is not the life more than meat in the body more than raiment behold the fowls of the air for they so not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are you not much better than they your heavenly father feedeth them do you realize the statement he made you're you have a heavenly father the same one that feeds the sparrows is the same one that's promised to take care of you amen but yet we're worried when the work begins to slow down or or they're calling about layoffs or or a potential slowdown in the economy all of a sudden we get nervous or how are we going to pay our bills how will we make our mortgage how will we buy this and how will we do that and jesus already told us do not worry about any of that because your heavenly father the same one that can feed a sparrow who has no soul how can he not take care of his own child remember you see these things begin to creep in amen and we've got to let perfect love drive that fear out and say i have a heavenly father he sees me he knows me if he sees the sparrow that falls to the ground not one falls that he doesn't know it and take knowledge of it and see it fall how much more so does he watch over you and i [Music] so this this is you say well i'm not afraid but when we begin to wring our hands and worry about do i have enough saved up for retirement am i going to be able to make it or or what if they what if they cancel the next contract what if my job lays off what if what if the economy goes bad again if we begin to wring our hands in worry and anxiety and fear over that i tell you what we're doing is we're becoming an offense to our heavenly father who has already promised to take care of all of our needs and i don't want to either with words or with actions ask him do you even care do you even care that i perish you even care that i don't have enough in the account do you even care that i can't take care of the bills amen we may not say that we may know better than the saiyan but our very actions prove that we're concerned whether or not he cares for us amen verse 27 which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto your stature and why take you thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spend and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith here comes this statement again this is an issue of faith what's the issue of faith based off your worry and your fear over everyday living oh you have little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith all shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly your heavenly your not the sparrows but your heavenly father not just jesus's heavenly father but your heavenly father your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his raiment and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the moral for the moral shall take thought for the things itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof he's saying let's just overcome today don't worry about overcoming tomorrow god's already taken care of them let's look at matthew chapter 7 now in verse 9. or what manner is there or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent if you then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him pretty simple now let's turn to philippians chapter 4. philippians chapter 4 and i would like to read verse 6 chapter 4 verse 6. be careful for nothing this word careful in the greek means to be anxious to be troubled with cares so he's saying be anxious be troubled with cares be anxious for nothing so be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be known unto god do you read that right with prayer and supplication with thanksgiving you have to ask believing that he'll give it and you ask with thanksgiving at the time of the request this is not this is not begging this is not do you care do you even see would you please take everybody god i know that you see me and i know you're my father and i know you have my need and i'm asking for this and i'm thanking you for meeting my need now because i believe it because not one sparrow will fall to the ground that you don't know it and you can clothe the lilies you can take care of me so be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your request be known unto god and the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus i say that's a good promise let's just make our supplication let's not care be anxious or worry about anything but let every request be known with prayer and supplication with thanksgiving and you'll have peace in your heart now let's go to matthew 14. i just want to lay in several of these things in as we move forward matthew 14 and verse 22 matthew 14 and 22 and straightway jesus can train us constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him and to the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitude away he went up into a mountain apart to pray when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when peter was coming down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus and when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore did thou doubt and when they were come into the ship the wind ceased so here we know the story really well we've talked about it a lot and brother brennan preaches on it a lot but but but jesus comes walking on the sea and they said if it's you let me come and peter begins to step out and peter begins to be afraid when he looks about at the circumstances he begins to be afraid and sing and he cries out for help and the lord helps him amen the lord helps him but he says oh thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt and i just want to show the the the bible didn't say that that peter was doubting the bible said that he was afraid but when he was afraid jesus knew that he was doubting and sometimes i think we need to recognize what's going on inside of ourselves in times of trial in times of difficulty and sickness or strife or our family situations when we begin to see that and feel that fear begin to creep in amen we need to realize that that is doubt friends and we need to put that thing to rest quickly before it gets out of control because doubt left unchecked amen is going to go into panic amen when we begin to panic we're going to act in ways that's contrary to the word and we're going to forget that we have a heavenly father and so doubt brings fear and when we begin to see fear it's a manifestation of unbelief and when we begin to when we begin to see fear that's not the time to pretend that's not the time to fake but that's the time to get on our knees and say god would you please forgive me for being fearful right now it's time to check up with the lord and say lord would you please forgive me amen i'm feeling fear and i know that that's coming from doubt but i believe your word and i know you're my heavenly father and i'm asking for you to take care of this and i'm thanking you for taking care of it now give me the peace that passes all understanding we need to bring that thing into check amen we need to bring that thought captive to the obedience of christ and say this is not what i've been taught this is not what i've been trained to do i'm a more mature believer than this i'm not a little baby believer anymore but i've been taught not to doubt not to fear not to fret not to be anxious not to worry but i've been told to be careful for nothing i think if we just get honest with what's happening amen we can have a greater victory faster not justify our fear because the first thing we want to do is justify our fear like peter could justify his fear nobody had ever walked on water before there was no scientific evidence there was no experiments there was no records that he could go on he was walking on water and the waves were crashing all around him and it was a dangerous life-threatening situation he could justify his fear but god didn't justify his fear and when jesus was asleep in the boat amen and all the waves were crashing in and the boat was now full and they were despairing of their lives amen we you know we could justify that fear but jesus didn't justify their fear and we have to stop justifying our fear we have to stop when we are worrying and worrying and fretting and worrying we have to stop saying well that's just my nature that's not the nature of the holy ghost amen that's not the nature of christ amen that's a wrong nature and you may be susceptible to that because of your nature and your genetics and your upbringing but it doesn't mean that you have to give in to it it doesn't mean you have to live with it it doesn't mean you have to let it rule and reign amen if you're susceptible to worry if you're acceptable susceptible to anxiety and fear you need to take that thing for what it is it's an evil spirit it's of the devil it does not come from god and not justify and say well my mom was this way my dad was this way amen there's a power here to break the family chain amen there's a power here to break the yoke of bondage that have come through hybridization we've got the word of god we've got the promises of the hour and we've got instructions and it's been demonstrated before us that all things are possible to them that believe there would be anxious for nothing when he said it he meant it but we cannot justify our fear we cannot say well it's okay it's not okay it's something we need to take to the lord and say lord i want to die to this i do not want to be anxious because anxious comes from doubt because peace comes from perfect love and i know you love me and i know you love me and i love you give me that peace that passes all understanding and the message god's covenant with abraham and his seed from 1956 prophet of god says unbelief can do nothing for you but damn you that's all it can do is destroy you and faith is the only thing that can help you so unbelief if there's no value in unbelief at all an unbelief accompanies fear unbelief accompanies fear when you go to reasoning and wondering then you begin to fear so unbelief companies fear that's why jesus said when the bible said that peter looked around and was afraid jesus said why did you doubt because fear accompanies unbelief or unbelief accompanies fear and so we as mature believers as the bride of jesus christ need to reflect his nature and understand that these things are not just part of our makeup i mean it's part of the human experience absolutely part of the human experience is to be fearful because as soon as adam fell adam when he heard the voice of the lord come walking in the in the garden he hid himself because he was afraid god said where are thou and he said i hid myself because i was afraid i was naked and i was afraid and so fear amen was an emotion that came with the fall and part of the human experience is fear but we've not been given that spirit we've been given the holy spirit which has the power to cast out fear and the message expectation from 1961 he says now fear has no value in it none whatever so i want to when i look at this and i believe the words of the prophet because it matches the scripture when it says fear has no value in it at all i don't want to waste one fraction of a second entertaining it because it has absolutely no value to it at all none whatever it's perfectly endless it doesn't it hasn't got one good thing about him if i was to be shot in the morning was going to be shot what good would it do to have fear what good would it do me you say well what good would have faith do you faith could deliver me but fear won't help me a bit you just get yourself all worked up and more nervous than ever when it comes time for the gun to fire so let's have faith faith could deliver me but if it doesn't what good would fear do anyhow just stay right with faith and hold on to it take god's promise and remain with god praise be to god this is good advice let's go to numbers 13. i look here in the exodus journey numbers 13 and verse 21 at this point moses had sent out 12 spies one from each tribe to go and spy out the land they were here at kedis barnea about ready to cross over he sent out the spies to bring back a report now verse 21 so they went up and searched the land from the wilderness of zen into rehab as men came to hamath and they ascended by the south and came into hebron where ahiman and telmai the children of anak were now hebron was built seven years before zoen in egypt and they came into the brook of eshkolen cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bare it between two upon a staff and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs the place was called the brick of eschko because of the cluster of grapes which the children of israel cut down from thence and they returned from searching out the land after 40 days and they went and they came to moses and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of peron to cadish and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the lamb and they told them and said we came unto the land whether thou sent us thus and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it now i want to stop for just a moment that when when they were back in egypt the god sent them a prophet and that prophet come to them and told them that is now is the time for your deliverance what was prophesied to abraham is now it's time to come to fulfillment amen and god is going to deliver you with a mighty hand as he told abraham our father and he's going to take you to the land of promise and he's going to establish you in that land and that is a land that floweth with milk and honey so now they go into the land and they bring back the evidence of the land and now they confess part of the word and by their confession they say surely it is a land that floweth with milk and honey so they're confessing that what moses told them is true moses had given the word of the lord and what moses told them is true and then they said this is the fruit of it now verse 28 nevertheless they made a mistake right there first they were quoting the word and they were showing the evidence of the word now they're going to contradict the word nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of enoch there the amalekites the malachites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the canaanites dwelled by the sea and by the coast of jordan and caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it you have two different types of believers here amen you have partial believers amen they were going along amen this is the same kind of believers that were going along with moses amen and they were singing and dancing when they had the great spoil of the land of egypt and when their children were robed in new garments that they borrowed from their neighbors and they had bracelets on them and earrings about them and necklaces and when they went out with a mighty host they were singing and dancing amen but when they came to to the red sea and they could not cross and pharaoh's army were coming behind this is the same crowd now that lost all faith and quit being believers and then after they crossed the red sea it's the same ones who started singing again and they became believers again until they ran out of bread amen when they ran out of bread they were not believers anymore and now they begin to cry unto the lord and say hey we should have stayed in egypt where at least there was leaks and garlic's aplenty and then the manna began to fall and they were believers again and then they come to where there was no more water and the water that they were brought to was bitter water and they stopped being believers then until moses turned the water from bitter to sweet by throwing the branch in and then they were believers again you see the problem amen the problem is when it was good they had faith when it was difficult or bad they lost all the faith that's not the believers that he's looking for he's looking for a believer who have just as much rejoicing just as much joy in their heart just as much faith amen when god is heaping blessings as when they get into a tight spot and it seemingly there is no more blessing amen and the diagnosis is negative and the treatments are obscure but he's looking for somebody who can take the faith of caleb amen and say yes i mean they're walled cities and they're giants and they're strong but we're more than able to take it let us go at once why because he believed amen he believed he believed all the way back in egypt he believed when they came out with a mighty hand he believed through the red sea crossing he believed the word of god amen when he saw the land and he saw the grapes and he saw the fruit and he knew that it was a a land that floweth with milk and honey he was willing to go all the way in the word and all the way with the prophecy regardless of the obstacle sometimes you have believers and friends and those that we know they're willing to go along for so long but when it gets really rough when it gets really difficult amen they can't go along anymore verse 30 again and caleb still the people before moses he said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome him but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched and to the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof i want you to focus on that that term it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof because i want you to know that god is listening to this and all the people that we saw in it were men of a great stature and there we saw the giants the sons of anec which came of the giants and we were in our own site as grasshoppers and so were we in their sight 14 1 and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would god that we had died in the land of egypt or would god we had died in this wilderness and wherefore hath the lord brought us unto this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children shall be a prey were not better for us to return into egypt they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into egypt what a shame france after all that they've seen and all that they've been through and all that they've been delivered from what a shame but i'd like to take and turn the table to ourselves what a shame after all we've seen and all we've heard and all the testimonies we've heard and all the deliverance we've had and all that's god done for me what a shame amen to get into another situation and say god don't you care god we're not able we're not what do you mean you're not able you weren't able from day one when you were in egypt as a slave you weren't able but god is a boy man and with god we're more than able i mean shame on us amen for acting like the unbelieving israelites shame on us i said god let me have the faith of caleb amen let me stand and say the word says it has to be according to the word i don't know how amen caleb wasn't depending on his strength he meant he wasn't pretending on his arm or he had none he wasn't depending on his weapons he didn't have any he was depending on the word amen the prophecy said that they're going to go into the land he will drive out the inhabitants of the land he will give them the land for possession it didn't matter how all that mattered was the same one who who spoiled pharaoh the same one who destroyed egypt was the same one that would take him into the land they could believe in the spoiling of pharaoh because it was past but they had trouble believing in the destroying of the inhabitants of canaanland because it was present and as always just like with the disciples in the storm the visible physical circumstances was bringing fear and fear was bringing doubt and doubt was manifesting unbelief they were not believing the prophecy anymore let's go down here to verse six and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jefferna which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake unto all the company of the children of israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good land if the lord delighting us then he will bring us into this land listen to what he's saying he's going back to the love of the god he's going back to what god has done for them he's going back for the deliverance of the lord he's looking back to the love of god and he's saying if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us a land which floweth with milk and honey he wasn't talking about tactics of war he wasn't talking about a game plan for overcoming the enemy he was talking about a lord who delights in us will give us this land it had to do on the merit of god's love for him not their ability to overcome the land i hope that goes deep deep deep in your heart it has nothing to do with their ability amen to overcome they're looking at god's love and affection for them as the source for the prophecy as the source for the power that will give them the land and establishing them lamb it's because the lord delights in them not because they've done anything special or are capable of doing anything special let's read verse 8 again if the lord delighted us then he will bring us into the land and give it us a land which floweth with milk and honey only rebel not ye against the lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bred for us their defense is departed from them and the lord is with us fear them not oh what was caleb depending on he was depending on a god that loved him and had already proved his love for them they had forgot that there was a god and they had forgot that god loved them and then they forgot that they were the chosen of the lord and they were a delight in his eye amen they were just looking at themselves and that's dangerous friends to look at yourself let's go to chapter 14 verse 26. but i want you to remember what they said they said this is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and that our wives and our children will be a prey let's go to verse 26 now and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying how long shall i bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel which which they murmur against me say unto them as truly as i live saith the lord as ye have spoken in my ears so will i do to you now i want you to recognize that when they went back if you go back and you look at their murmurings and their complainings they never blamed god they they chided against moses and against aaron and they said why did you bring us up but we're better if we never come out of this land they never blamed god amen but god when he saw what they were doing say they murmur against me and i wonder how many times we've murmured against the lord amen we didn't say god this is your fault god why did you do this but when you say why is this happening to me why is my life falling apart amen you're just testifying that you don't have a god who loves you and watches over you more than the sparrows and the lilies it's a murmuring against god verse 28 say unto them as truly as i live saith the lord is ye have spoken in mine ears so will i do to you your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from 20 years old and upward which have murmured against me doubtless you shall not come into the land concerning which i swear to you to make you dwell therein save caleb the son of jeff and joshua the son of nun but your little ones which you said should be a prey them will i bring in and they shall know the land which you have despised but as for you your carcasses they shall fall in this wilderness and your children shall wander in the wilderness 40 years and bear your whoredoms until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness after the number of days in which your search the land even 40 days each day for a year shall your shall you bear your iniquities even 40 years and you shall know my my breach of promise i the lord have said i will surely do unto all this evil congregation that are gathered together against me in this wilderness they shall be consumed and there they shall die he's going to give them exactly what they heard he heard from them in his ear they said this land god called it a good land they brought an evil report against what god called good god called it a good land god called it their inheritance his chosen piece of land and it was god's land it was his land that he was giving to them and they bring an evil report against god's land that god called good and they said it's a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and so god had heard that amen and he had told them you shall die in this wilderness and your carcasses shall rot in this wilderness and now the land that was going to eat them up now they were free from that land but the wilderness they were in was going to eat them up one by one as they got buried in the land bury this one and bury this one and bury this one they said that land eats them up but it was going to be this land that was going to eat them up and saying our wives and our children shall be afraid he said the very ones that you say will be a prey the weak amen the incapable the ones that you feared for those are the ones that i'm going to raise up and they're the ones that i'm going to take in to possess the land what you thought was impossible is what i'm going to use what you thought was vulnerable what you thought was in danger amen i'm going to make strong see it's always the opposite of what we think they thought that they were going to protect their wives and protect their children and men and protect themselves but they were all going to die but the very ones that they thought needed protection were the ones that are going to take the land god was going to prove that he didn't need them they needed him let's go to hebrews chapter 3. hebrews chapter 3 and verse 17. this is referring to the same event he says but with whom was he greed forty years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness how did they sin they disbelieved and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief but i want to ask you a question how was their unbelief expressed their unbelief was expressed in fear they were afraid of the inhabitants of the land they were afraid to take the land they were afraid for their wives they were afraid for their children they were afraid that the land would eat up the inhabitants thereof they were fearful they were afraid and being afraid amen caused them to disbelieve the bible says that they didn't believe the bible says why couldn't they inherit the land because of their unbelief is that right but they expressed it as fear so fear and unbelief go together let's go to mark chapter 8. mark chapter 8. we've read this many many times but i want to go through it because of i've never went the next step and showed what he says next this is mark chapter 8 verse 31 and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again and he spake that saying openly and peter took him and began to rebuke him but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples he rebuked peter saying get thee behind me satan for thou savers not the things that be of god but the things that be of men peter was trying to get him to save himself but we went through all this before peter was really interested in his position in the kingdom and then he called verse 34 and then he called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose him but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it for what shall a man what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul so we know peter and peter's dilemma and peter's rebuking the lord and we know that the lord what the lord was saying amen was not what peter wanted to hear because peter had his own idea he had his own ambitions amen and and and he was telling the the the the lord that this is not surely going to happen to you you're not going to die and tricking him into believing he's going to preserve his life and he turned around and says get thee behind me satan for thou don't care about the things that pertain to god but the things that be of men and then he gathered him all together and when he gathered him all together he made this next statement he that will lose his life whosoever come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me whosoever will save his life shall lose it that's what peter was trying to do that's what the israelites were trying to do at candice barnea but when trying to save their life they lost it but he said if you'll lose your life for my sake in the gospels you shall save it see when we get into trouble trials and tribulations and hard things come we're really trying to save our life instead of just submitting and surrendering our life and saying whatever god wants if god wants me to die right here in this airplane i'll die right here in this airplane but i've lost my life i've been bought with a price i'm not my own i don't belong to myself i'm not here to save myself or to provide for myself amen if god amen when god saw fit that the apostle paul was destitute he was destitute when he saw fit that he abounded he abounded when he saw fit that he was blessed in a city he was blessed in his city when he saw fit to have him persecuted he was persecuted because paul lost his life so that he could find it but if we try always to preserve our life and we're always worried about preserving our life we shall lose it friends amen you cannot save yourself you cannot preserve yourself you cannot provide for yourself you might as well just turn the whole care of your whole being over to your heavenly father and as he desires as he sees fit whatever he deems necessary is what i will praise him for we have our own ideas of what would be right in each situation and what deliverance would look like and how god should answer our prayers and how he should save us and how he should deliver us and how i mean we always think we need more money but sometimes god says what you need is less money sometimes we think we need more opportunity but what we need is less opportunity sometimes we think we need we need more deliverance and we need to feel better and sometimes what we need for a season is to feel worse and so if you seek to save your life you'll lose it so let's just decide today to lose it let's lose my life amen let's go to john chapter 11. john chapter 11 verse 47 i want to show this example in the scripture then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees at council and said what what do we for this man do with many miracles if we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the romans shall come and take away both our place and our nation and one of them named caiaphas being the high priest that same year said unto him you know nothing at all nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not so here the chief priests gathered together and the elders and what are they trying to do they're trying to protect their place and their nation they're going to try to save their place what is their place it's their position amen they they have a position under the roman authority and they don't want to lose their position as high priest and elders and they don't want to lose the nation amen so they go about with their own mind and their own accord to try to do what they believe will save them from the romans coming in and taking their place and they believe if if all them follow after jesus and and they make him a king and it'll cause a big stir and our political situation will get ruffled amen and so we'll lose our place in our nation so we've got to get rid of jesus so that we can preserve our place in our nation so they went about with their own plan and they got rid of jesus and just a few years later titus comes marching in and they lose their place and their nation it's just evidence again you cannot save yourself if you try to save yourself you will lose yourself if you just lose your life you shall find it praise god let's go to galatians chapter 3. galatians 3 verse 2. now the apostle paul in galatians here he's having a problem with the judaizers these have converted to christ seemingly but they want to keep the law and they want to make the keeping of the law a requirement for following christ they want to make it a requirement to the gentiles and and he's in this strife and he's in this debate with the judaizers and this is going to be the fight with legalism and and i i want you to just think of this for a moment don't leave it back 2 000 years but but let's bring it up today because what's happening is they could not just accept by faith they could just not accept the grace of god by faith alone that they could be children of abraham according to faith without keeping the law they had been taught so much that they had to have something to do with it that you have to secure your own salvation and you have to secure your own salvation by being circumcised and by keeping the law and by doing a certain minimum set of requirements and if you do all of this then you can find security in keeping the law and you realize that this is rooted in unbelief because christ come to fulfill the law to pay the price to set you free from the bondage of the law because by keeping the law no man can be justified you can only be justified by faith because the law is pointing out your flaws the law is pointing out your failures the law is pointing out the hybridization that you can't get rid of so now he's in this contested fight because what it is it's unbelief but it's religious unbelief it's religious unbelief saying that you have to do something that you yourself have to save yourself you have to be circumcised you have to be careful what you eat you have to and if we're not careful that same old pentecostal mentality can creep in and we begin we begin to find faults within ourselves and and we find little problems and we begin to doubt our own salvation because we're not able to keep every ordinance when it was based on faith to begin with this is what paul's dealing with now look at what he says here in galatians 3 verse 2. this only would i learn of you receive you the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith how did you get the holy ghost by your works or by the hearing of faith how do you receive the spirit by your works of the law or by the hearing of faith are you so foolish having begun in the spirit you are now made perfect by the flesh oh bring that home friends amen god god has called me and god has given me a seed of faith amen when i heard the message by hearing of faith amen i believed and received the spirit amen and now how am i going to top that how am i going to approve improve upon that how am i going to do better amen by by certain works or if i fail to do something how am i going to lose that but you see the same old mentality comes in if we fail here then i must not have it i'm not it i'm not one of god's i it was based on faith let's skip over to galatians 5. there's something very specific i want to get to here galatians 5 verse 1. it says galatians 5 1 says stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not a tangled again with the yoke of bondage he's speaking on the same subject behold i paul say unto you that if you be circumcised christ shall profit you nothing for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law christ has become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law you are fallen from grace for we through the spirit for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in jesus christ neither circumcises and availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love what does faith work by love perfect love cast out fear this faith worketh by love what kind of love the love that god had to you when you realize that we love him because he first loved you and now faith worketh by love ephesians chapter 2 now if you're concerned about what i'm saying about works don't worry because faith worketh by love and love produces works you'll keep the law if you love him if you love him you'll keep his commandments but it will be by love amen not by works and works will not produce faith and won't produce the spirit amen but faith will produce works and faith workers by love and love comes by a revelation of who you are and who you are in christ now ephesians chapter 2 verse 4 but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus now i want to ask you why did he already quicken you with christ and why did he already seat you in heavenly places because of the great love we're with he loved us because of the great love we're with he loved us he has quickened you together with christ and seated you in heavenly places this is all past tense it's already done it's already finished it's a finished work with god because of the great love we're with he loved you he has quickened you with christ jesus he has seated you on heavenly places with christ amen and how can we now come to a situation in our lives and begin to question his love for us because of a difficult situation and say god why are you letting this happen to me he already proved his love to you he already proved it when he caught you up with christ amen when he set you in heavenly places in christ jesus and by faith he revealed it to you by his grace amen so you know that you're seated in heavenly places how can we offend so great a god who loved us so much by saying why god have you don't you care that i perish of course he cares he cares more than we could ever imagine sometimes when we get into these situations we need to go back to this that before i was born before jacob was born and esau was born before ether could choose he said jacob have i loved and he saw have i hated him before you were born before you could have good conduct or bad conduct he already raised you up with christ jesus and set you with him in heavenly places what do you mean does he not care does he not see does he not love of course he does he saw you before you were here he saw you in the trial before you entered the trial he already has the outcome and determined of course he loves you don't question that love let's read it again but god who is who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead and sins hath quicken us together with christ by grace you're saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through christ jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god if he's given you the gift of faith to believe he loves you with a great love and that love will never cease and that love will never stop and that love never needs to come into question in our hearts let's go to second corinthians chapter 11. see friends i believe this word that we've been given brings in maturity and it brings us unto christ-like ripeness do you believe that and christ-like ripeness is not only understanding a revelation of the mysteries of god but the revelation of the mysteries of god should produce something in our lives not an intellectual with an intellectualism so that we know something that's debatable we can debate and know something more than somebody else that's not the reason that he tore the seals off he meant so that he could show us the great mystery of god but he gave us the revelation of his great mystery because the revelation was to produce something and what was that revelation amen it was the rising of the sun amen and the rising of the sun was here to bake all the greenness all the immaturity out so that we can bake into the likeness of jesus christ as mature seed and so the revelation amen of predestination the revelation of our position with god coming from god returning to god being seated in heavenly places the election of the bride the calling out of the bride the bride at the end time all of these revelations should produce something in us and it shouldn't have us running around saying god where are you don't you recognize god can't you see what's happening don't you care there should be another revelation and say god i know you know me and i know you know where i'm at and i know you had a plan before the foundation of the world and i know i'm here as an instrument that you can work through and i'm trusting you in the middle of this trial because you're my heavenly father and you've deemed fit for me to walk this let me walk as an overcomer lord forgive me for forgive me for being fearful forgive me for my anxiety amen let me recognize your love from you lord let me see the seals torn away afresh right now in this triad he may not tell you the next step or how he's going to get you out of it or how deliverance will come but it doesn't matter if we can just go back and see what we were with him before the foundation of the world where we're going to what his purpose is right now then doesn't matter anymore what's happening will it be difficult yes will the flesh not like it of course not amen will the circumstances make you weary make you tired absolutely but those are things for us to overcome because he has already proved his love for us second corinthians chapter 11 we're going to look at the apostle paul as a mature believer he says of the jews five times received thy forty stripes save one and he didn't doubt his sonship or whether or not god loved him i want you to think about these things not just read them as little sentences but to deduce five times he was taken prisoner by the jews five times he was taken into captivity and received 39 stripes five times he was can you imagine what it would be like for the guard to come and get you amen to pull you away from the marketplace where you're speaking pull you out of the synagogue to take you down to the prison amen to strap you amen to strap your hands over the log and strip you down bare naked to the waist knowing that they've got a straw a strap there that they're going to stripe you down 39 times with the whip and not doubt who he was and not doubt whether god loved him or not and not doubt whether he was a son of god or not and the company says that they're going to lay us off and we wonder if god knows where we're at paul was strapped over a block amen five times by the jews and beaten 39 times and never doubted whether he was a son of god or whether god loved him or whether god knew where he was at and he didn't take the bait well if you were a child of god he wouldn't let these things happen to you i think paul was a child of god you agree and god let all these things happen to paul verse 25 thrice was i beaten with rods and never doubted his sonship or whether god loved him or not once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night in the day i've spent in the deeps in journeyings often in perils of water and barrels of robbers and perils by my own countrymen and perils by the heathen in perils in the city and peris in the wilderness and perils in the sea and perils among false brethren and this is destroying all the pentecostal characteric faith preaching that god wants to bless you and god wants to give you money and god wants to did god not want to bless the apostle paul was the apostle paul not a son of god was he not in the will of god was he not doing what god wanted amen he never he wasn't questioning lord am i in your will why was i shipwrecked three times why do i have perils of robbers amen why are you letting me get robbed i'm in a missionary journey why did you let the ship wreck three times do you get the point just because all these things happen to us let's look back at the bible and say there's nothing out of the ordinary here there's nothing contrary to what was normal amen amen if we're going to have another book of acts then we're going to have a whole book of acts the good and the bad and all of it together god was not i mean god it wasn't evidence that the apostle paul was a child of god amen only in the good things he was still a child of god when he was shipwrecked when he's in perils of robbers when he's buried in the city perils of his country meant perils of the heathen what was he he was still the son of god when he was beat with rods when he was stoned once when he was beaten five times amen with 39 stripes what was he he was a son of god where was he in the will of god and did god love him every bit as much as he always had i hope the devil's getting a black eye tonight i hope he's losing his foothold i hope all his lies are being exposed and i hope they're crumbling right now because if god could love the apostle paul and let that happen in his life and paul could rejoice amen he could rejoice in his weakness he could rejoice in his sufferings and glorify god and then we absolutely have nothing else to do but say god you're wonderful you're beautiful and everything that you've ever done in my life has been perfect verse 27 in weariness and painfulness and watching's often in hunger and thirst and fasting often in cold and nakedness prosperity preaching doesn't have a lot to do with this scripture beside these things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches who is weak and i am not weak who is offended and i burn not if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concern my infirmities the god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessed which is blessed forevermore knoweth that i lie not in damascus the governor under eredus the king kept the city of damascus with garrisons desiring to apprehend me and threw a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and escaped his hands this is the same god who opened the prison doors for peter to go out the same god who when a viper was fastened to paul's hand shook it off into a fire was the same god who let paul get shipwrecked three times and god didn't love him anymore one time under any lesson another time god's love was fixed and perfect love casteth out all fear when troubles come and difficulties come and situations come up the devil comes right there to try to build worry anxiety and fear because fear had torment and fear and unbelief go together what's he trying to get us to do he's trying to get us to express unbelief but what is god looking for he's looking for a child of god to stand on his word and overcome by faith it's the trial of our faith friends being more precious than gold let's go to romans chapter 8. these are things we must be reminded of romans chapter 8 verse 31 what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died ye rather that has risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also make inner intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord and perfect love cast out fear fear has torment i'm going to read something from the prophet here real quickly out of the easter seal from 1965. he's talking about the time that little sharon rose was dying he says i know that day when i walked into that hospital when i had my great challenge i seen my wife die me calling for her life and what have i done to stand on the street corner preach and pray for the sick and then satan said well he won't answer your prayer i seen her die but i know that in her was that resurrection power then bone shall rise again i see my little baby lay there and i lay my hand on say god don't take it look like he pulled the curtain down said i won't even hear you no more satan said there it is just one word he knowed better than to tell me that there was no god because i knowed that now catch this brother branham and another sermon calls this his gethsemane because this time his hardest trial he calls this is gethsemane he said he know better than to tell me there was no god because i know that but he said he don't love me he don't care for me cares not that we perish cares not that my little sharon road has meningitis and is dying you see the temptation friends even our prophet had to face this temptation in his gethsemane but he said he don't love me he don't care for me see every reason thing said you're just a young man yet 20 years old there lays your wife laying down there in a morgue here's your baby going in there you said he was a great healer and he's all this and look what does he do one word he wouldn't even have to speak it just look down there and say just nod his head that's all would take place and it'd be healed but you see he don't love you he don't care for you letting your baby die right there now and even refuse to hear your prayer in this dark hour everything he said was absolutely the truth so what have you done work all day long until you couldn't hardly stand up and then sit up all night till 12 and 1 o'clock standing on the street corners preaching making calls to hospital just come in and sit down in a chair sit there and sleep an hour or two and go back to work again next night the same thing and here you are about 21 22 years old every friend every young lady every young man that you ever associated with call you a crazy crank what have you done you made a fool out of yourself don't you see it i was just about ready to agree with him i was just about ready to agree with him see you had you would have to be there to know it you would have to have just had your baby die or your wife die and you'd have to be standing over a bed looking at a little 18 month old baby that you loved dearly that used to run to you when you come off work and wrap your little chubby arms around your neck and and cool over you and love you you have to look down in her suffering so bad her eyes crossed and swatting the flies away from her little eyes you'd have to be there to know that this is a gethsemane you'd have to be there to know what a trial this was because everything the devil was telling him was true and at that moment brother bannon was not feeling like god loved him he was not feeling emotional about god he wasn't feeling a tenderness of love and all he was feeling was heartbreak and despair and loss his feelings amen were were aligning with what the devil was telling him and the devil was saying now he doesn't care for you now he doesn't love you which is absolutely a lie but standing there looking in that baby begging god not to take this little baby in another place brother bam says she favored her mom and i wanted to keep her and raise her because he just lost his wife talk about heartbreak talk about agony and at that moment when the devil said he don't care for you don't love you that seemed true emotionally speaking that seemed true because he went to pray to god who healed vast amounts of people amen in his ministry now he's begging and he's asking god to heal her and god just put a black sheep down and refused to hear his prayer rejected his prayer rejected his calls and it felt like god didn't care and it felt like god didn't love him and i was just about ready to agree with him and something down in me that was quickening power said the lord gave and the lord take away blessed be the name of the lord amen what did he do he cut through the lie amen he cut through the emotion he cut through the despair he cut through it all and went back to a god that was greater than him that loved him and he said god give god taketh away blessed be the name of the lord because god reigns on high and he's just and he's right and everything he does is good it doesn't feel good it didn't feel good to brother branham even when he was saying that i doubt that he went on a shouting spree and then all of a sudden that he you know he had tinglies all over he just made the statement and then he said i begin to feel better he said in the message communion talking about the same thing he said then the tempter came to me there was the one time in all my life that i can call was the crucial moment my gethsemane and what was jesus doing in gethsemane amen jesus was wrestling with himself and overcoming his flesh and jesus was dying to himself in gethsemane and here brother branham said this was his i've ever had a trial if i've ever had a gethsemane this was his gethsemane and what was he doing he was dying out to himself when i was just barely holding on to the bed the devil said there you are that's the reward for trying to serve him you mean that he'll take that young 22 year old mother and lay her yonder as a corpse in the morgue and will take the precious baby your own flesh and blood and slam your prayer right in your face and then you mean to say that you'll serve him i was standing between opinions i had to decide then i put my hand over on her little head and i said the lord gave and the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord i felt relief and one more quote he says in the message he careth for you in 1960 and then satan came to my side he said and then you'd serve him here you are nothing but a boy and you mean what what have you done stood on the street corner everywhere you could and fasted until you was so weak you couldn't climb a telephone pole to do your work and what have you done but preach and cried and prayed and one word from him would change the whole picture but would he do it no he wouldn't do it he'll let her die and then you'll turn around and serve him i come almost in that hour when my legs wouldn't hold me up no longer i lean on the bed i said sherry you know daddy and she heard wheezing like and she looked and i know she was dying i thought just one word he wouldn't even have to speak he'd just look his own mind would just change the picture the meningitis would leave her and she'd be well just one word but yet he won't do it satan said then you'll continue on to serve him and i thought where would i go what would i do who would i go to where's my hope something happened to me i said a few years ago down here and i know that i love him what held in that hour it was love amen it was god the prophet said something happened to me and i know i loved him and you can only love him if he first loves you i walked over to the bed put my hands on her little head i said darling god gave you and god's taking you away blessed be the name of the lord though you slay me yet i'll trust you amen that's mature faith brother braham goes on to say in the church age book and the smyrna church age he says the cloudy skies and storms of life are no sign of god's disapproval neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so not because everything works out not because it's always easy not because we're delivered from every trial the apostle paul wasn't delivered from every child brother branham wasn't delivered from every child but how shall we know because he said so and manifest that he did love us for he bought brought us to himself and gave us of a spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come my path come come to pass how do i know he loved me because he said so and he gave me of his spirit but how shall i prove my love to him by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allow to come to pass let's turn to ephesians chapter 3. i want to read just two more scriptures and we'll close ephesians chapter 3. verse 14. ephesians 3 and 14 for this cause i bow my knees into the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ might dwell in your hearts by faith that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto him be glory in the church by jesus christ throughout all ages world without end amen paul is praying that you'll be able to comprehend that christ may dwell in your heart by faith that you may be grooted and grounded in love what are you going to be rooted and grounded in in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god that's why when we talked about manifestations of unbelief doubt is a manifestation of unbelief and doubt comes with fear fear brings on doubt but perfect love will cast out fear a revelation of his love for us will cast out fear a revelation of the mysteries that we're laying under the seals and the mystery of the seventh seal that that revelation of that love that god has for the attributes that revelation is perfect love and it will cast out fear it'll cast away doubt it'll cast away unbelief it'll cast away all those things and we will know him who loved us and chose us and gave himself for us and will sustain us and keep us through every trial what did the apostle paul had that will keep him when he was on a block being beat it was the love of christ it was the revelation that christ died for him personally it was the revelation that god loved him so much through christ that he would come and he would die in his place so that he could be free and be united back to him that love held him on the beating block that love held him when he was beat with rods that love held him when he was stoned and when he was shipwrecked and when he was abused and when he was cast out and rejected it was that love that kept him not because god answered every prayer immediately and because everything worked out the way he thought it was going to work out that wasn't that wasn't the love that held it was a love that came from revelation that he loved me first and he chose me and i'm his bride by his choosing and his love for me won't change let's go to first corinthians 13. this will be our last scripture that we read first corinthians chapter 13. and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is love charity is the word for love in the bible faith hope and charity but the greatest of these is charity god has built up his church through seven church ages but he capped it off with the capstone of love divine love god when he opened the seals when he come himself to open the seals what was he doing he was opening the love letter and what was he opening the love letter for he was opening the love letter so that you could see your name was there so that you were the recipient of the love letter so that his love for you would be secure and you would be secure in his love and that perfect love would cast out fear and fear wouldn't bring any doubt and there would be no more unbelief in the bride now we're not secure because of legalism we're not secure because of what we know we're not secure because everything works out we're not secure because there's never any trouble never any trials never any forsaking that's not what gives us security but our security comes in the mystery that was in the love letter and then the love letter was the mystery that you're mine no matter what happens your mind before you took one action on earth you were mine amen no matter what happens at the end you'll still be mine you come from me you're coming back to me i chose you for this purpose you're mine so what shall separate us from the love of god shall persecution shall tribulation shall strive shall sickness shall abandonment shall anything separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus i'm persuaded that nothing amen shall separate us from the love of god your hardest trial can't separate you from the love of god and all the devil's lies can't separate you from the love of god and your own mistake can't separate you from the love of god that's what the blood is for amen no more fear not because i have a bumper sticker that says no fear but because of the revelation of his love because of the great capstone that's come down this earth god himself in christ himself the bridegroom in love to come to show us his love to come to give us his love to be united with us in love so that perfect love will cast out fear i don't know about you but i'm thankful for that love let's all stand musicians if you'll come by the blake if you'll come next time things begin to get chaotic in life and seemingly they go out of control things come in such a wave sometimes they come so fast and they sum in such cycles that you can go from everything being okay and under control to having a feeling of absolute chaos breaking out your life and no control anymore but that's just a feeling that's not the reality and you can get to a place where you can the devil can bring questions in your mind question your sonship and question your faith and if you really have faith would you be sick right now if you really have faith with this happening if you really have faith amen when you have this trial if you really had faith and if you really were a bride wouldn't he deliver you from this and you really were his child wouldn't he keep you from this i would just tell the devil was the apostle paul his child can you deny that devil too late amen it's been recorded in the book was brother brennaman's child too laid you can't convince me otherwise none of these things shall separate me from his love none of these things shall separate me from the love of god that is in christ jesus i'm secure in his love my security comes from his love if i never feel secure in the flesh if i never have another day's peace i'm still secure in his life don't let the devil play games with us anymore we have the word don't let his voice amen become a voice of truth it's a lie and no matter how much what he says feels right it's not right amen we've got to deny the feeling and take the word and say get thee behind me satan for thou carest about the things that be of man not the things that be of god does god allow loved ones to die yes does god allow does god take babies yes do we understand it no does god allow troubles to come yes do we understand why no but does it change his love for us never does it change who we are no i say god i thank you for what you've done in this hour and your ways are perfect god your plan is perfect what you do with me is perfect help me to love you more amen let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you lord lord i thank you for the revelation of your love for us for the fact lord that in this earth we have a father we're not going in in our own we're not here abandoned and left to our own vices but we have a father who watches over us god you've promised that you're our father the same one who watches over the sparrow and the same one who closed and adorns the lily you're my same father and i'm not here just trying to scrub out life on my own but you're here watching over me and caring for me and protecting me and guiding me god every trial is for my education and every obstacle is for overcoming god help me lord not to doubt forgive me lord for allowing doubt to enter my mind forgive me lord for allowing fear to move but god we resist all those things now in the name of jesus christ satan we recognize you in all your ploys and all your schemes to cause us to be fearful to cause us to doubt but perfect love is casting out fear and god we're taking you at your word and believing you god you who loved us with an everlasting love that'll never fail away fall away lord we love you back because we love you because you first loved us and if we love you this much how much more you must love us if you love us that much how much you must care for us god help us to never question your care and love for us again but help us always in every trial to move forward with faith knowing that you watch over us oh how we love you lord we ask your blessings to be upon us and guide us as we go from here may the things that we've heard may these things from your word may they not depart from us when we walk out those doors and face our next trial but may they go deep into our hearts and become a natural response that comes out of us that we can in the hour of temptation like the prophet say the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord god we love you we just want to say that we trust you lord god we want to put our confidence in you and leave it there and not take it back god we trust you in all things and ask your blessing to be upon us in jesus name we pray amen well friends when we come into trials and we come into difficulties in our response is such a matter of trust like we know god is real we all know god is real and we know god is capable we know god's a miracle worker and we know he's a deliverer we know he's we know all of these things but when it really comes down to the trial it's a matter of trust it's a question of do i trust him do i trust him in this do i trust him in everything do i trust him in the path he's led me down do i trust him through these difficult circumstances do i trust him and i want my answer to be i trust you lord i don't understand it doesn't make sense i don't want to walk down this road but i trust you and i walk wherever you lead me because i know whatever you do for me is right and i know whatever you do for me is good and i know that all things work together for good amen let's sing my boat of life sails on
