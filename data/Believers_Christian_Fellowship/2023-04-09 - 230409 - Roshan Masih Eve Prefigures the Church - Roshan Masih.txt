and I've had prayer I've had people pray for me I tried to believe you know and listen to messages and different things and and just kept leaving but nothing ever happened and last Sunday when my dad was reading the scriptures preparing for communion I was just sitting there and he talked about healing in the cup and it just seemed like it was my time and it just dropped down my heart it was like God just said it's over you're healed and I just I it's done I didn't you know you can't bring that to pass you can't give it to somebody else God just absolutely and I just really so thankful and I left here and when we left of course I've been an asthmatic I've had asthma since I was a child and so my breathing is really deteriorating the last year or two and get short of breath a lot and on

and went home and Sunday night Monday Tuesday Wednesday never coughed at all Harley coughed one time and I went to the doctor I already had a doctor's appointment scheduled and so I went to the doctor

up felt real good and Thursday afternoon I got a cough and spell again just cough coughed couldn't stop and Bessie said what's going on I said I'm just being tested it's just the death test in me and

when you wake up and it's getting warm and the sun is shining that seems like the right kind of weather for Easter amen praise the Lord so it's a wonderful time to be here with you all and we're blessed to have brother Rashaan Missy with us from India many of you know I was just there just a few months ago at the at the last part of last year me and brother Joe were there together and it was really a blessing to see the brother his church his family his ministry God has really blessed our brother and used him for a long time to do a great work over there he has a tremendous gift and he's a tremendous anointing and I'm so excited about the word this morning and that we have an opportunity to hear from my brother and that God can use that vessel and we can benefit from it amen this suit that I'm wearing my brother bought for me when I was in India I told him it's the first time anybody's ever bought me a suit amen so I thought it'd be fitting to wear it today and it's and it it's nice it was a nice suit and I was really blessed to have it so he'll be ministering this morning and also on Wednesday evening as well he'll be taking that service for us I just want to say I appreciate it brother Dave's testimony amen and I appreciate his willingness to come up and share it amen it's encouraging to know no matter how long we deal with something God knows and the promise I'll never never delay it'll always be on time amen so it was encouraging to me also I heard from Sister Nancy Morrow this week and the Lord supernaturally came and touched her in a very special way amen she's still weak she's still recovering but she's feeling better day by day and she knows that she's going to be fine amen she doesn't know you know if she'll need help with it from a doctor or not she doesn't know but she knows that she's healed by the grace of God because God came down and she had a visitation from the Lord and I was so excited and so encouraged to hear that as well I also want to let you know that brother Emmanuel sabasu is out of town he's away preaching for Brother Rich Cobb so our brother's been quite busy lately so keep him in prayer and they'll be traveling back I don't know if it's tomorrow or Tuesday but remember to keep them in prayer and I just wanted to I wanted to share a quote a scripture and a quote with you I woke up this morning and was just meditating because I didn't have the service on my mind as far as preaching I was just meditating and I got so super inspired just thinking about the resurrection and the Resurrection season and I started thinking about how for the rest of the world they're looking at a historical event and for us the historical event is priceless because without the Redemption that took place at Calvary there was no Redemption for us we would remain lost amen so for us it has a two-fold joy in our hearts it was the resurrection that was and the resurrection that is together amen is not only the historical event that purchased our Redemption but is the resurrection Ministry in this day that is bringing us to fullness of life and to the fullness of what that Redemption purchased for us so we can celebrate and have joy like nobody else they can Rejoice that Christ died but we can Rejoice that he lives amen I'd like to read just a scripture to you out of Ephesians chapter 2 this morning and then read something that brother Branham said Ephesians chapter 2 verse 1. and you hathy quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins now we're talking about our personal Resurrection and then you were dead and what trespasses and sins and the greatest sin of all was unbelief stuck in denominationalism separated from the understanding and knowledge of God Amen but you have to be quick and who are dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and we're by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so I don't have to wait to go to Heaven by grace and by faith in Christ I'm already seated there in Christ Jesus amen I just wanted to read something for you out of the rising of the Sun and Christ is the mystery of God revealed remember said Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waived over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism that's our Resurrection season will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waived over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because I live ye live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power we don't just look back we look to today and we know what that purchase it purchased for us this Redemption amen Christ The Mystery of God are revealed he says when we see him coming down and living amongst the church that's his victory shows that he he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us that's right and we're already potentially raised because we've been raised from dead unbelief in his word from denominational Creeds to an eternal word of the Eternal God which is him himself working through US manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever again it arrives in the sun he says now you see now you are already resurrected when God raised him up he raised you the son is just now on you and now you're growing into a blossom life like he was to be resurrected completely in the last day your potentials you have now why do you know your soul changed didn't it your body comes in obedience to it didn't it in obedience to what a church the word which is the life then you are now resurrected from the dead how many is resurrected from the dead unbelief in his word from dead denominationalism into newness of life amen now this is the last sentence this is what he said the last thing I'm going to leave with you it's Easter with Jesus and I it's Easter with you and Jesus it's Easter with you I and Jesus is it Easter with you and Jesus amen is it a resurrection it's not one day this is the season this is our life he has resurrected us from dead denominationalism he's he's taken way the barrier that separated us from God and now he's come in full measure to reunite with the individual amen with you and I this is our Resurrection season what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is praise be to God I'm happy to be here today I'm excited to worship God whatever whatever the rest of the world has we should have doubles amen whatever Joy whatever satisfaction whatever celebration for us it should be double amen for then and for now not just for them God is so good amen let's all Stand Together just want to say I appreciated that special this morning thank God for the young sisters who sang sister Heidi and sister Amanda God bless you amen I'm so excited to see that there is a life available to the children of God and not like in ages before but whether it was partial life now the fullness of life and that's what I want I want to empty everything of me out so everything of him can come in and have full Reign and I want it to be all him and me and that's the potential for this day we're not limited by a a poor and partial Revelation we're not limited by just a dip in the spirit we live in the day of no limitation for the seals to be taken off the book the full revelation of Christ is unveiled and the full measure of Christ is here to indwell each one of us who will empty out of everything else and oh that's my desire just to empty out and empty out and empty out so I can fill up and fill up and fill up and now this morning as the words coming forth amen let's let's just Envision ourselves emptying out and filling back up with him so now it's no longer me but it's him in me amen God bless you I'm so excited to have her brother here just if I could just express to you what a what a precious valuable soul that this brother is to me what a friend he is but also the work that he does in his homeland if you could go and see the respect the ministers have for him the the work that he's labored in for so long amen it just helps you have such a tremendous respect for what God has done through our brother in an appreciation so I encourage you pull from the gift amen pull and receive amen what's amazing to me is how somebody can come from the other side of the world Amen in just a short period of time a few phrases a few sentences you got oh aha he's tapped into the same thing he's drinking from the same will I'm drinking from so let's look Beyond the Veil of the Flesh and pull through the channel that God has provided this day and receive our portion may God bless you let's sing together here I am [Applause] to thee Lord he is here [Applause] here I am here I am let your spirit Lord hear here here I am here I am here I am here I [Applause] [Music] am holy Lord here I am [Music] [Applause] here I am I here hear us speak to me speak to me Lord [Music] we [Applause] [Music] [Applause] to the Lord speak to me please speak to [Music] Lord Street to [Music] to me Lord speak to you thank you God bless you all good morning and may the Lord bless you I bring greetings from the church and the family back home and they all are praying for these meetings so I counted a great privilege once again that the Lord has brought me among you and I appreciate your help for the building project and which is almost done and within couple of months we will be able to move there but before that we want to have a dedicational service so keep in prayer so I appreciate you and thank you once again amen so let's go in the word of the Lord and then we will pray Genesis 20 6 I mean chapter 1 26 verse the Book of Genesis we are going to read 26 27 verse of chapter 1. amen and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creeped upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created hidden amen so let's pray our gracious Heavenly Father we thank thee today from the depths of our hearts for the privilege that we have of calling the Our Father and we are so happy this morning that we have been included in this great number of the redeemed and we are here this morning for no other purpose but worship thee to read Thy word and to find out how we could be better believers and to live a closer creation why walk for you and with you Eminence Among Us and we pray that you me you will meet with us around the world and will give to us that deep desire that we so want in our hearts because you have promise with us that whatsoever you will ask in my name it shall be given unto thee and also you said we are ever two or three gathered in my name I will be there we thank you for your unfailing promises that you are with us to guide us and to lead us because you said I will not leave you I will be with you even in you and we thank you for this Lord and if there is a special need in the body Lord and we know that you are here to meet that need and we thank you for that give us your word and put me aside Lord I have limited word but me the great Holy Ghost come down and give me utterance to speak and may your word come in and the power of the Holy Ghost we give you thanks praise and glory and commit everything into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ I pray amen thank you you may be seated so I would like to speak on Eve prefigures the church and as brother Chad told that what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is and we would like to talk about the Resurrection Life because he Jesus Christ has done more after his death amen he came as a son of man and purchased us redeemed us but paid the price and after that he changed his ministry and went to his Priestly Ministry meditorial work and since this last 2000 years during the seven churches amen he has done lot more and now he's doing in our lives amen so we would like to talk about these things amen because of his death amen we are gathered here so we have recently uh printed a book time tested Memorials of God in that merciful Branham said Christ has a slap established a memorial of his death that's his church we are the memorial amen Hallelujah so we see we have read here in the Book of Genesis which is the seed chapter and Prophet said you cannot understand the Book of Revelation until you know you are seen so this is the seed chapter and everything Prophet told us that which is in the Book of Genesis you will find in the Book of Revelation because Revelation is your crop amen so we are going to see uh in the Book of Genesis why God created a man why God created women what was his purple amen what was his purpose in creating man and woman amen so why did God create a man what was his purpose in creating man and God has given us this answer in these verses we have read here Genesis 1 26 and 27 amen and these two verses are of great significance amen because they revealed to us that God's creation of man was indeed and exceedingly special one so it says before God created a man he said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the future of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth amen and then he said and over every creeping thing that creeped upon the Earth amen so this was God's plan creating man and that planet let him have dominion over all the Earth so when God created man to rule when God created a man immediately he disclosed his purpose so the man is created to rule amen and then also God said what kind of man he wanted he wanted a man after his own image and likeness amen and the Bible says God created man a male and female created he them amen and and verse 28 says so I am going to read these verses chapter 1 Genesis again and again so please bear with me amen again and again the same words amen 28 God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the art and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea so that is 28 27 I mean he said the same thing have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over every living thing that moved upon the Earth amen from these verses we see the man that God desired God desire a ruling man amen a man who would rule upon this Earth then God would be satisfied amen so God's heart desired is that man May rule over his creation whatever God created after that he created a man amen and when God created man everything was already in existence and then God said rule over everything amen Hallelujah so God wanted a man like himself God wanted a man who who rule on the Earth amen it is very clear that man's position in God's creation is entirely unique for among all of God's creatures man alone was created in God's image amen the man that God 's heart was set upon was completely different from all other created beings he was a man in his own image amen because 27 verse says let us so God created man in his own image amen so when we see these verses we will realize the preciousness of man and we will rejoice whenever man is mentioned in the Bible amen so when we see the value of man in the sight of God then we can easily take burden for The Lost One because God has a great value for men even God himself became a man amen God's plan is to gain man when man is gained by God God's plan is accomplished but Branham said he need only one man who is completely totally surrendered to him and with that one man he can accomplish everything amen so it is by man that God's plan is fulfilled and through man his own need is met amen so what then does god require from the man whom he created it is that man should rule amen when God created man he did not predestine man to fall God made him eternal God made him ruler amen there was no sin no fall nothing because Genesis 1 Prophet told us that God made original man was a spirit man amen so in God's plan to create man man was ordained to rule amen so this is revealed to us in Genesis 1 26 when he said God where God unveils his his will his desire and tells us that his secret amen that let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth so this is God's purpose in creating man that man May rule amen and in the Millennium we are going to rule amen that's why we are here on the Earth because God is building a character in US and without character if the power comes it is satanic amen so we are here for tests and trials amen and his building us amen so why God has such a purpose it is because why God wanted us to rule why God has this purpose why God desired us to be a ruler because an angel of Light rebelled against God before man's creation and he became devil God Satan sinned and fell the day start became the enemy of God is you can read Isaiah 14. God therefore withdraw his authority from the enemy and put it instead into the hand of man the Reason God created man is so that man May rule in the place of Satan so that is why the battle is going on that is why the Satan is always after us because God took everything from him and give this in the hand of the man amen what abounding Grace we have in God's creation of a man so not only God desire that man should rule but he marks out his passive specific area for men to rule amen so Genesis 1 26 says let them have dominion over the fish over the of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth all the Earth is the domain of man's rule the area where God desired man to rule is the Earth and man is especially related to the Earth when God created Earth he gave the Earth to man as his permanent abort make shall inherit the earth amen the heaven is temporarily up there so all the heaven will be emptied out we all will come on Earth because Prophet told us that we are going to spend eternity on this Earth amen so Earth is related to man is given to him for eternity amen so now God created two person one is Adam and one is Eve amen both were created human beings but each tapify something different because the Old Testament is types and shadows I mean everything because the real thing the New Testament is the reality but everything how he told us in the book in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed whatever God had in his mind he started to reveal things through the types and shadows in the lives of the Believers the prophets all were typed amen So Adam was a type he was a type amen and both that be buying something different First Corinthians 1520 says that Adam was a type of the Lord Jesus and then Romans 5 14 says that Adam was a figure of the man who was to come man second man second Adam Christ amen Adam then foreshadowed Christ he portrayed Christ in figure or type in other words all that God purposed in Adam was achieved in Christ but beside Adam in the creation there was also the women if God very carefully recorded the creation of this woman in Genesis 2 and when we come to Ephesians 5 we clearly told that Eve is a type of the church amen therefore we can see that God's Eternal will is achieved partly through Christ and partly through the church Amen in order of us to understand how the church can achieve God's will on Earth we must learn from Eve because if is a type of the church so I'm taking this the message Christ is the mystery of God he was the pre-figure of the church amen so the purpose of this message is to discuss about Eve amen so we are not going to uh emphasizing on the work of Christ because we all are the work of Christ amen Eve so we are going to talk more on Eve the church second Eve amen Jesus Christ is the second Adam amen Hallelujah so when we read Genesis 2 18 to 24 and Ephesians 5 22 to 32 we find that women is mentioned in both places in Genesis there is a woman and in Ephesians 5 there is also a woman the first woman is a sign that Define the church the second woman is the first woman the second woman is Ephesians 5. and first woman is Genesis chapter two amen the first woman was planned by God before the foundation of the world and that first woman also was created before the war amen and Paul took place later he was already in existence so Eve came on the scene before the fall amen so God created Adam to 35 church and also God created Eve to tampify the church amen so God's purpose did not only accomplished by Christ but is also accomplished by the church amen amen Genesis 2 18 says the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him a help meet for him amen so God's purpose in creating the church is that she may be the help meet of Christ because he was a helpmate of Adam so Christ Alone is only half amen there must be another half which is the church do you remember said we are the another half of the Chinese ticket this is another half and we are the other half of the Chinese taker we are the part of this word but Branham said when a man received the Holy Ghost he becomes the part of the Bible when we eat the book we become the part of the book amen amen so Christ Alone is only half there should be another half which is the church so God said let it is not good that a man should be alone this means that it is God's in God's Society Christ Alone is not good enough they should be help meet for Christ so Genesis 2 18 24 amen mention all these things when God created Adam after a period of time amen Adam we don't know for how many years because God showed his loneliness in Adam because Adam was amen so after a long period of time God created Eve after a long period of time God said it is not good it is not good that the man should be alone therefore he created Eve for Adam amen amen so I want this that should not be missed amen God said it is not good Eve should Adam should be alone but before that God said it is very good because God completed all of his creation so when we amen read Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter 1 ends when this ends with this record 31 is the last verse of Genesis 1. and it says and God saw everything that he made and behold it was very good so in Genesis God completed his creation and he created everything amen and when God saw everything was completed by that time and when God saw his complete creation which he created he saw it is very good amen from this we are allies that had having Adam alone or we may say having Christ Alone is not enough to satisfy God's heart because everything was created and God already said it is very good but now God said it's not good that man should be alone so God made a help meet for him amen so with God there must also believe that is there must also be the church then his heart will be satisfied amen so when Eve was there Adam was there when male and female was there God rested rested mean he was not tired amen rest means he was satisfied like when you have children and they help you in the work amen and you know that my son or my daughter is going to finish this work and you are at rest you are satisfied it does not mean you are tired so God was not tired he was satisfied because now man is there we manage there amen they are there to rule over his creation and he is satisfied he is resting amen the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone God desired to have both Adam and Eve his purpose is to have a Victorious Church Victorious Christ plus a Victorious church amen a Christ who has overcome the work of the devil plus a church which has overthrown the work of the devil amen his purpose is to have a ruling Christ and a ruling Church amen a ruling judge but Branham said a sin preacher amen Hallelujah this is what God planned for his own pleasure and he has performed it foreign his own sassification amen so God desired to have Christ and God desired to have a church which is exactly like Christ God not only desire that Christ would have dominion he also want the church to have dominion amen God allows the devil on Earth because he said let them have dominion let them have dominion Christ and the church have dominion both of them amen God purpose that the church as Christ counterpart should take part in dealing with Satan if the church does not match Christ God's purpose will not be fulfilled God is not satisfied in Warfare Christ need a help need and even in glory he also need to need help me amen God requires that church to be the same as Christ in every respect it is God's desire that Christ should have a helpmate two words in Genesis very meaningful one is Genesis 1 28 God says subdue that stabbed you is like conquer subdue is conquer amen God said to them conquer the Earth subdue it amen subdue with power or whatever and then the other word is keep Genesis 2 15. keep the Earth which is subdue it and then God because Satan was there amen we see from this Versa that God ordained a man to conquer and guard amen subdue and keep that so God's original intention is give the Earth to man as a place to dwell God desired through man to not allow Satan to introduce upon that amen so God give this in the hands of man that he may overthrow Satan and have dominion amen amen so then what Garden because God do not want that man should be alone so then how God created Eve how Eve came on the scene amen because we know now see that Adam need help me amen because God said it's not good after completing completing everything amen what did God do to beat this need so Genesis 2 19 to 23 says and all of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every form of the ear and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called f every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fall of the air and to every beast of the field but Adam there was not found a help meet for him God brought every kind of living creature before Adam but Adam could not find his help meet among them amen therefore the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead it off and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man amen this was Adam's help me and pre-figure of the church according to Ephesians chapter 5 the Bible says very clearly that all of the things made of Earth all the fall of all creature everything made God made out of the Earth amen we just read the scripture amen so all the creatures came from the Earth and then the Bible says there was not any help meet porn for Adam from the Earth from anything God created from the Earth was not helped me to Adam because the things made of Earth all those things were made of Earth and not taken out of the body of Adam which is not taken out of Adam's Body could not be his help me amen all the beasts of the pill the cattle and the birds of the air were made of Earth they were not taken out of Adam therefore they could not be the help meet to Adam we must remember that Eve was formed out of a rip taken from Adam therefore he was the constituent of Adam amen this means that the church comes out of Christ amen anything that is not of Christ is not the church the church is only that part which comes out of Christ anything which is not art of Christ cannot be the church cannot be his help meet amen we need to note a few more words in Genesis 1 26. and 27. God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them amen the man what is singular but immediately following the plural pronoun is them it's used the same pattern is used in verse 27. amen which says to God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them amen God created one man singular amen but we can also say that he created to one is to and Jetta two are one because he was in Adam amen so notice further verse 27 says God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them the way God created man is the same way he created them Eve was not taken from the Earth he was taken from Adam amen from this verses we see that if the church is not in a state which corresponds with Christ God will not rest and his work will not be completed not only is Adam in the image of God so also is if because in the image of God God created them amen so not only does Christ have the life of God the judge also has God's life amen so we see that the church comes out of Christ we should ask what is the church the church is the bad part which is taken out of Christ amen the church is the part anything Jesus said I came from the father and I go back in the father's bosom because he came out of gospel amen I think I'm pronouncing right amen and who does not come from heaven cannot get back to heaven because we are the continuation of the life which was in the mind of God as an attribute and then God created a body for us and that body we received from our parents but the life was in God Jin and then God put that Gene Soul a part of the Eternal World in our life I mean in our body and when we if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved so we will be the continuation of the same life in other side amen I mean if we have not come from God we cannot go back to God so the church is the part which comes out of Christ Adam is a type of Christ the fact that he was made from Adam signifies that the church is made from Christ remember the eve was made out of Adam's Rib since e y Eve came out from Adam she was still Adam amen Christ is the mystery of God revealed she was a part of Adam she was the rib of Adam and she was the body of Adam the Bible says Genesis 5 2 male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created so now we have to Adam one is male and one is female and this female is a help me to Adam the male so now two person one person in two body [Applause] but Branham said this is the great mystery that God divide himself in the believer and still he remains the perfect omnipotent amen Hallelujah so then what is the church the church is another form of Christ just add just as it was another form of Adam that's why we cannot come to church by joining church or by sheikhan said we have to born amen it is a birth in the family of God amen because when the birth is like our children are part of us the parent they are the extension of the same life I mean same life but now extended another body amen so the church is another form of Christ now Christ is in two bodies one is church and one is he himself I think that is a good message for Easter Good Friday amen and that's where he paid the price amen and he died for us and that that direction life amen is in the church you know same Christ Holy Ghost boy another in another body so now I would like to read quote couple of quotes but Branham said and now notice as God opened up the side of Adam and took Eve took out Eve by his own flesh and blood and divided his Spirit from masculine to feminist and put it in eve took the reap from under his side and made Eve out of it so God did the same thing taking out of the sight of Christ the blood and the water and Christ is the word and taking the word and making our pictures if see where Branham said God is taking Christ which is the word and making up his church if amen another quote the same I'm quoting Christ is the mystery of God will what happened in the pre-figure now he opened Adam's side and took part of his flesh which was Adam to make Eve the bride has to be the word for he is the word amen so that church is only that portion which has been taken out of Christ so the material of the church is Christ bridegroom and the bride are from the same material amen another quote the message is it's the rising of the Sun so I wonder brother Chad quoted from all these two messages amen so it shows us the Holy Ghost how the Holy Ghost is working in a simple way in US amen everywhere the Holy Spirit in the world saying the same thing amen when God made his first bridegroom he made the bridegroom first and he was both men and women in a spirit formed him in the dust of the earth to make him material and what is when he made Eve from Adam he took not another piece of clay he took from the same piece of clay I mean the same word for Adam was a spoken word so Brahman said when God created Eve he did not take clay but he took Adam because Adam was a part of the word the spoken word so the bride must also be flesh of his flesh and born of his born amen it is rising of the sun message amen the way he makes his bride is the way he makes his individual made out of same material like he was made out of Adam a rip from the side blasphemius name I quoted from that message I mean another quote the elements that came from the body is what makes his body it come it come from the body is the material that takes to make his bride because Adam had his bride taken from his body Christ has his bride taken from his body another quote birth pain she is to be the same bride the same kind built out of the same kind of material that she was in the first place amen so bre Branham talked about it many places bright and bright bloom are of the same material so without Christ the church has no opposition no life no living no existence without him we are nothing because the church comes out of Christ the church is the Christ in you Christ in me the Christ in him Christ in her amen and the Christ in all the Christians around the world the church is composed of that which is out of Christ which is not of Christ cannot be Church should be the same material man's Talent ability strength and all that he has are outside the church everything that comes from the carnal or natural life is outside the church and anything that is brought into the Church of the uh Church of the natural life will only result in trading Dawn not building up because that's carnal only that which comes out of Christ is in the church he was not made from clay amen Eve was made out of Adam and Eve is the type of the church amen so only that which came out from Adam not from clay can not be called Eve that's why the cattle the birds different things when God brought before Adam and God gave names to all of them and the Bible says but Adam has not found helmet for himself so when Eve came on the scene amen even the very meaning of Eve is taken out of man and Adam said she shall be called woman in Hebrew says Isha because she's taken out of each she shall be called Isha so the woman meal is taken out of man taken out of Adam and only that which comes from Christ can be called The Church whatever is not from Christ has nothing to do with the church he was constituted only of that which came out of Adam and the church likewise is constituted only of death which is ought of Christ whatever is of man himself is not the church nothing which comes out of human nature is the church anything out of the man himself the human nature the carnal mind it is something of the flesh that which is odd of Christ can be the church whatever is of man is not of the church amen Hallelujah only that amen which formed from the Resurrection Life of Christ is the church Adams help meet is also Adam's Body amen since the source of Eve's life was his very born amen So Adam was the basis of her existence no Adam Noe amen she could exist only because a part of Adam was in her it is the same with the church without him we have no life no existence we are nothing amen we are part of him only the life which Christ says imparted into US makes us a part of the church amen the basis of our being a part of the church is our new birth that's how he comes in the church by the new birth since it is then that Christ imparts himself into US amen therefore there is a need for us to live behave and act according to this life The Life of Christ the token amen the life of Jesus Christ has come back in the church God cannot do anything more for us than to impart his son into us that we may share the Life of Christ there is a great pleasure within us the hope of glory Christ Jesus Holy Ghost the life of God in us is everything we do based upon Christ or based upon ourselves anything based upon ourselves which is not of Christ if we have that we cannot accomplish God's purpose amen the church is the church only because there are many people who all share the same life you have a part of Christ I have a part of Christ that life amen and when we all comes together amen you have the portion of Christ and he has the poor has a portion of Christ each one of us has a portion of Christ when all of this portion of Christ are put together there is the church that is the church amen you have Christ's life I have all have amen because the church is a continuation of the same life same word same power everything same amen amen the Bible says God created man male and female the male is singular and the female is also singular a man Christ is singular and the church is also singular because in the sight of God there is only one Christ and only one church that is universal Body of Christ amenam said God has only one Church that is a journey word sleep one body of Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah so now we saw God created a man to rule the Earth amen and then in type God showed it is not good that man should be alone so God made Eve help me for him and where that help it came from Adam's Body anything which is not of Adam's Body cannot go back to Adam amen that's how God broad Eve from his rape from his body moonoff is born Adam said when he saw Eve amen she is born of my born Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called Eve I mean woman not him amen woman because she is taken out of man Adam amen Adam was the material of which Eve was made likewise Christ is the material for the church God use Christ to make the church amen amen now we will see how he was made amen then we can understand how the church is made when we read Genesis 2 21 and 2 to 23 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep so we saw Eve came from Adam but now we are going to see how he became how God brought him amen 21 221 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept Adam slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the reap which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is the now born of my wounds and Flesh show my flesh she shall be called woman why because she was taken out of man amen amen so we now see how Eve came out God put deep sleep on Adam when Adam was in deep sleep amen then God brought Eve God brought forth the church out of the death of Christ amen when we read here Genesis 2 it says the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam the verse does not say that God caused Adam to die but says he calls him to fall into a deep sleep if death had mentioned then sin would be involved because death and sin are related so death is not mentioned there amen Adam's asleep type defines the child uh typifies the aspect of Christ's death which was not related to Redemption only but in the death of Christ there was an aspect which was not related to Redemption only but to the release of himself amen we are not saying that the death of Christ is not for Redemption we truly believe that his death involved amen his death is for our Redemption through his death we we are reamed he purchased us he redeemed Us by his death amen but there is another aspect of his death that is the releasing of himself for the creation of the church and when Christ released himself as his life to the church so there is nothing to do with the sin his death is the penalty for sin his death is redemption but after his death blood and water came after his death amen sin question is already solved price the penalty is already already been paid amen so God is taking something out of Christ and choosing it to create the church therefore sleepy Jews to testify his death through which men receive life amen Redemption and the deceiving of Life are to distinct things amen redempt we have Redemption through his blood but there was not only blood king water was also there Redemption involves and in aspect of dealing with our sin we have sinned and deserved to die therefore Christ came to bear our sin his death accomplished Redemption this aspect of his death is related to sin but there is another aspect of his death it is the imparting of himself to us so that through his death we may receive life remember Branham said the blood cell was broken and the dead blood cell when it was broken released a life amen and that life he imparted in US that day on Calvary amen so Eve could have was able to receive life because Adam slept amen Adam's sleep was not for Eve's Redemption because there was a man no fall that time it was so that a rib could be taken out for her creation that why Adam slept in the same manner and aspect of the death of Christ is for the imparting of life to the church blood cell was broken life was released amen death that life may come in the Believers in the church when Adam fell into Deep Sleep God took a rib from him likewise when Christ died something happened to his rib his side he's died already amen his side was not built for Redemption because the piercing occurred after his death amen so the problem of redemption had already been sold according to Jewish custom whoever was crucified had to be taken away Before Sunset if they were noted the soldiers would come and break their bones to speed their death and in Jesus Christ Our Lord's case when the soldier looked at the Lord Jesus and saw that he was already dead they did not break his bones amen his wounds cannot be broken that is his body that is the church amen instead they appears the side with the spear and blood and water flowed out this signifies that when his side was pierced the work of redemption had already been accomplished amen it reveals that the work of Christ not only involved the shedding of his blood to redeem us from sins but also the flowing Out of Water typeifying the imparting of his life to us amen the blood deals within as I told you this is what his wounded side speaks to us amen we all need to understand two aspects of Christ's death he died for our sin but then when he died that blood cell was broken to release the life the same life amen the same life amen blood and water came out it was the releasing of his life that his life may be imparted into US therefore the water terrifies the Lord himself he is the water of life amen so if came she came when God caused a deep sleep on Adam and he took his dream so Eve came out of Adam when he was sleeping Church came out of Christ when he slept I mean death because now death is necessary because the vases of sin is death and he took our sins and died amen amen so now before closing we see in God's side the church is sinless that's what he showed what he showed in the type amen when we read Ephesians 5 25 we find the same meaning it says husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself up for her amen so Christ loved the chair and give himself amen so first thing we see Christ gave himself up for us because we are the church amen and second Christ came give himself for us because he loved us a man not because we have sinned the Bible says Christ loved the church and gave himself for it the church he gave himself because of love I mean not because of our sin because somewhere in the Scripture it says he girl Christ loved us God loved us yet we were sinners because of love he gave himself amen for us Christ the Bible says also love the church and give himself to the church I mean notice Adam imparted his born to Eve Christ imparted himself to us as well we have him within us because he died he has already entered into us in the form of the spirit amen because he died we now have his very life within us he himself has been imparted to us amen that is the purpose she was if you remember he was created made before sin occurred so that all is type of pranam said if is a pre-figure I mean Prophet said of the church amen Eve came out of Adam and was holy for Adam completely totally for Adam not for anything else amen even so the church comes out of Christ and is completely for Christ the church in God's Force side has no history of sin because Church comes before the fall amen God when God saw us see us he see us under the blood and brother Branham said when you look red thing under amen under the red so you see white Justified so in God's side he had no desire to sin but but we trapped into sin we caught up but that seed Soul attributes Jin always longing for something eternal that's why he sent the Holy Ghost and quickened that seed and when that seed is quickened we recognize the part of the scripture for this day because we are the part of that scripture deep was calling to the Deep and when deep cold there was something deep in us to respond that call amen because the same part was here we are that's all is a part of the word amen so when Jesus came he said I will build my church no man I will build so the church is not something who comes accidentally amen church is worth in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and Bob Branham said that is his great Secret the mystery threefold what God was he poured himself into Christ and what Christ was he poured himself into the church and no both together amen God had preem Eminence in the Sun the same preeminent son has in the church in the bride no both together restored going back in the Garden of Eden amen go together same material everything same it is the rising of the sun brother said if right from it 16 cylinders so the bride amen seeing words John 14 12. same life amen everything seemed same body but in another form but both are Adam both are Christ amen so the church in God's forethought has no history of sin but in God's eyes the church has never been touched by sin the church is the part order of Christ which has never been touched by sin and known sin amen Romans 8 30. moreover whom he had predestined them he also called and whom he called then he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified amen he already glorified amen Justified meaning but Branham said you never you never sin it is like when in the garden Garden of Gethsemane soldiers please came to uh to find Jesus to arrest him and Peter took his sword and cut the year of priest's servant so Peter is guilty can be condemned because he cut the air how Jesus Justified him he took the year and put that back on the servant no body can prove nobody can prove that Peter is guilty so that's why Branham said when God sees us in God's side we never had sin we are pure virtuous Justified [Applause] amen so that's why the eve comes before the fall amen before the fall and to whom he justified then he also glorified that which is completely without sin is called Eve and that which is holy art of Christ is called the church that which is entirely from Christ and will be solely for Christ is Eve the church if typifies a corporate man made of God because we are many but one body amen One Church universally one body the church is the portion which is Art of Christ Alone not something else Christ Alone amen we must see that the church is the vessel chosen by God to manifest his son Christ in US and to achieve his eternal purpose through us through the church that's why I said cry Christ one Victorious Church ruling church with him we will rule with him reign with him amen so this is God's Eternal purpose God desires to obtain a child a corporate man in whom everything is order of Christ and for Christ Christ in all guys all in all everything cried amen as Bob Branham said Angel is Christ cherubim means Christ to set up him Christ and everything in the nature types Christ the church is Christ in another body amen there is that's God's external purpose amen church is not comes as an accident but that it was planned by God in a eternity past amen the church is eternal because it is God's Eternal plan and of Gods economy amen church is eternal because it was in his eternal thought amen Genesis 2 18 says and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him a help me for him the creation of Eve was for law gods hearts desire because everything was completed and God said it is very good but after that God said it's not good that's why vibranam said besides salvation the greatest the best thing amen God could give to man is women his wife a man because God had such a desire he performed it God's creation of Eve in Genesis 2 shows how God purpose to have the church from eternity to Eternity amen God is after such a church to satisfy his heart after he made male and female he entered into rest amen God was satisfied because he obtained obtained such a church so Man was created for God man was to be the temple of God the place of God's rest we are the temple of God there God made dwelling in a dwell in Us in the form of Holy Ghost amen to have rest that now we do amen it's like adoption now the sun can sign the check amen everything belonged to him so in God's purpose so God God want wanted to achieve his goal so then God made Administration and that Administration on the earth is his church now man so through the church Amen to us he is doing and we are Branham said cause of his death he died for us to bring the church amen so in God's side we are seen free Justified even glorify amen that's why he said wish Christians should be the happiest people on the Earth nothing to worry their ups and downs are there battle is there amen but according to God's Eternal plan amen we will be victorious amen we are his victory may the Lord bless you as worshiper musician comes and I call the pastors so let's pray let's pray thank you dear heavenly father we thank you for your word when we see this great Plan of Redemption

why she has no sin because sin has already been taken care of before the church came out of Christ oh I absolutely love that amen it gives us the strength to overcome because we were born in the hybridization and stuck in this body of nature with a sticky cucumber nature but that's not we're looking at that's not the part it's the seed on the inside amen and it's that Life of Christ that's been imparted into us and brought us a new birth and now we can say we look in the mirror and we see faults amen but when we look in the mirror of the word and see Christ there is no fault [Music] that's why there has to be a new birth and the new birth is not the flesh remember I mean as Nicodemus said must I return into my mother's womb and he wasn't talking about this this will be fixed later amen but he was talking about the New Birth that seed coming to life on the inside oh praise God and by that that's the impartation of Christ's life into us and now the life we live we no longer live but he comes in and lives through us oh what are we called to do Just Surrender and just yield and just let him have his way it's all him I'm so glad that the sin question was answered first before the bride came out she was birthed with no sin Eve was birthed with no sin the church was birthed with no sin and that's what we've been restored back to in this end time it's why the prophet of God could preach his Thanksgiving message not an Easter message but a Thanksgiving message he goes I'm so thankful for this that use the Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ amen now she was what she was birthed The Man was created to rule on the Earth and now I say she's been created to rule with him and we know that it'll be fully restored in the Millennium but now I think it's time for Christ and his bride to rule the Earth and I say he can rule this earth right here how about your Earth amen can Christ and his bride together rule that portion of Earth and have dominion oh praise God just want to say God bless you I enjoyed the word this morning so glad that because he lives she lives also without Adam Eve had no existence the woman had no existence because she came out of him
