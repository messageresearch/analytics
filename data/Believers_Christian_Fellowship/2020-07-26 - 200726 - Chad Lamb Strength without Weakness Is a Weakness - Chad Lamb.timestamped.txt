[8:13] praise the lord
[8:16] praise his name
[8:17] amen while we're standing when we take
[8:19] our bibles and turn to second
[8:21] corinthians
[8:22] while we're turning there i'd like to
[8:23] welcome a very special member of the
[8:25] congregation
[8:27] god bless you sister tanya godfrey it's
[8:28] good to have you in church today
[8:34] amen praise be to god for what he's done
[8:37] amen we're so happy to see you here and
[8:40] see your smiling eyes
[8:42] [Laughter]
[8:44] praise be to god
[8:46] god is certainly good to us friends
[8:49] amen
[8:51] before we read the scripture i got
[8:52] another announcement to make uh
[8:55] brother dean hatfield got a call
[8:57] from the lake placid christian
[8:59] conference center we're gonna have our
[9:00] camp in october and they've canceled the
[9:03] the camp and they've closed down the
[9:04] campground for the rest of the year
[9:06] which will be terminating our camp our
[9:09] october so
[9:11] it's disappointing but i guess not
[9:12] surprising
[9:14] and so we'll just
[9:16] uh take it as from the lord and look to
[9:18] the following year and see if we're here
[9:21] and what we want to do then so just be
[9:23] praying for us that we can make some
[9:24] decisions like some dates open in 2021
[9:27] we could reserve or let it go for now
[9:28] and so the trustees are discussing uh i
[9:32] and the trustees are discussing what we
[9:33] ought to do but just give us uh just
[9:35] pray that god will give us wisdom amen
[9:38] but so you know i know many of you have
[9:40] taken some vacation time and set aside
[9:42] time and money and things for that so i
[9:44] want to let you know as soon as we were
[9:45] able to that they canceled that so
[9:49] praise the lord anyhow
[9:51] god has good things in store for his
[9:53] bride
[9:54] let's look at the second corinthians
[9:56] chapter 12 together
[10:06] second corinthians chapter 12
[10:08] and verse 9.
[10:13] and he said unto me my grace is
[10:16] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[10:18] made perfect in weakness
[10:20] most gladly therefore i rather glory in
[10:22] my infirmities that the power of christ
[10:24] may rest
[10:26] upon me
[10:27] therefore i take pleasure in infirmities
[10:29] and reproaches and necessities and
[10:31] persecutions and distresses for christ's
[10:33] sake for when i am weak
[10:36] then am i strong
[10:38] amen let's bow our heads and pray
[10:41] lord jesus we thank you for your word
[10:43] for god it is our guiding light is the
[10:45] only thing we have to go by in this dark
[10:47] world
[10:48] no we know we can't trust our own
[10:50] thinking we can't trust our own
[10:52] reasoning
[10:53] we can't trust the news we can't trust
[10:55] governments we can't we can't trust any
[10:57] other voice lord but the voice of your
[10:59] word
[11:00] we thank you for this word and that lord
[11:02] you've come in yourself in this
[11:04] generation and spoke it to us so clearly
[11:07] so that we would know it lord and that
[11:08] we could live by it we pray god that you
[11:10] would take preeminence among us this
[11:12] morning lord that you would move
[11:14] everything out of the way that would
[11:16] hinder you would bind every wrong spirit
[11:19] that would try to hinder and that your
[11:21] holy ghost can move freely lord through
[11:23] this place that you can take your word
[11:25] and mold character in your children that
[11:27] we can become more like you word by word
[11:30] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[11:34] you can all have your seats
[11:36] i want to just
[11:38] continue moving forward with the
[11:39] thoughts the the way the lord's leading
[11:42] and the title today is an unusual title
[11:45] but it's strength without weakness
[11:48] is a weakness
[11:50] so you might want to write that down let
[11:52] that soak in strength without weakness
[11:55] is a weakness
[11:57] praise be to god
[11:59] let's run to first corinthians chapter
[12:01] one
[12:06] first corinthians chapter one
[12:10] verse
[12:11] 25
[12:14] because the foolishness of god is wiser
[12:16] than men and the weakness of god is
[12:19] stronger than men
[12:20] for you see your calling brethren how
[12:23] that not many wise men after the flesh
[12:25] not many mighty not many noble are
[12:27] called but god hath chosen the foolish
[12:30] things of this world to confound the
[12:32] wise and god has chosen the weak things
[12:34] of the world to confound the things
[12:36] which are mighty and base things of the
[12:38] world
[12:40] and the things which are despised have
[12:42] god chosen yea and things which are not
[12:44] to bring to not things that are
[12:46] that no flesh should glory in his
[12:48] presence
[12:50] so it's amazing when we read this
[12:51] scripture we know these things to be
[12:53] true
[12:54] but but in our own human pride we have
[12:57] such a hard time being something that's
[12:59] despised
[13:01] to be to be
[13:03] something that's weak something that's
[13:05] not noble that's not strong that's base
[13:10] you know we in in human we're talking
[13:13] the human side of us we don't want to be
[13:16] known as weak
[13:18] we don't want to be known as base
[13:20] despised rejected nothing
[13:23] we all want to be somebody we want to be
[13:27] something
[13:28] but god chose not the somebodies or the
[13:31] some things to confound the wisdom of
[13:34] the wise but god has chosen the things
[13:36] that are not to bring the not the things
[13:39] that are and so then now all of a sudden
[13:42] it's like everything in our human
[13:44] understanding flips upside down and so
[13:46] now it's not that i want to be the man i
[13:49] want to be nobody
[13:51] it's not that i want to be respected or
[13:53] well thought of
[13:54] that's a dangerous place to be i would
[13:57] rather be the one who's rejected and
[13:59] downcast and nobody and not without
[14:01] wisdom without understanding without
[14:03] finances without resources without any
[14:06] way to help myself because if i can be
[14:08] in that place amen then then everything
[14:11] is on god and god can take nothing amen
[14:14] and do something with nothing
[14:17] that's what he chooses to do and so so
[14:19] many times in our lives you know we've
[14:21] always strived for this next level of
[14:24] whatever we're chasing after and that's
[14:26] just the human side no next level of
[14:29] finances next level in job next level
[14:31] and this and that and and we don't
[14:33] realize that sometimes amen those next
[14:36] levels of accomplishment
[14:38] put us in another level of danger
[14:43] and and we feel that it's security or or
[14:47] uh a greater more secure position but
[14:50] sometimes that greater more secure
[14:52] position in the flesh amen brings a
[14:54] weakness to us that will cause us to
[14:57] stumble into fall
[14:59] and so god is good to his children
[15:02] he's good to us
[15:04] that he keeps us
[15:07] he keeps us endowed with troubles
[15:10] he keeps us showered with tribulations
[15:13] he keeps us in this place where you know
[15:17] i don't know how it's been for you but
[15:18] for me all of my life every time i'd get
[15:21] a little bit of money
[15:23] something would happen
[15:26] something would break the car would
[15:28] engine would lock up the the appliances
[15:31] would go bad and something would happen
[15:34] and that little bit of money i had would
[15:35] disappear
[15:37] it would take wings like an eagle and
[15:39] fly away
[15:40] and then i would be so disheartened and
[15:42] so upset and so sad you know what what
[15:46] has happened
[15:47] but now i look back on my life and i
[15:48] realized that was god's grace and mercy
[15:50] to me
[15:52] that he would keep me in a place of
[15:54] dependency and and i don't know why it
[15:57] was it's always so hard in a trial that
[15:59] when i'd finally get a little bit of
[16:01] money tucked away and saved up and then
[16:04] something would happen and for me it
[16:06] would seem like it was often car trouble
[16:08] you know
[16:08] something would happen with the car and
[16:10] then you would drain out all of that and
[16:13] instead of rejoicing that i had the cash
[16:18] instead of rejoicing at god's provision
[16:20] ahead of time instead of being excited
[16:22] and seeing the hand of god and making
[16:24] sure i had what i needed to meet the
[16:26] challenge that was coming i would feel
[16:28] dejected and cast down and i would feel
[16:30] despondent because i just lost all my
[16:33] money
[16:36] because money to me was equaling
[16:38] security
[16:40] but our security is in christ
[16:43] and so god for me knew that i couldn't
[16:46] handle that
[16:48] at that time in my life i couldn't
[16:50] handle that kind of false security so he
[16:52] would never let me have the false
[16:54] security so that i would always rely on
[16:56] the true security
[16:59] that's why so often you see people who
[17:01] struggle all through life and god will
[17:03] shower blessings upon them later in
[17:05] their life amen and they'll have
[17:06] resources but it was because of the
[17:08] trials and the tribulations and they
[17:10] learned not to trust the resources that
[17:12] god could give them resources but if
[17:14] your heart is bent on trusting resources
[17:17] god if you're a child of god he'll not
[17:19] let you have too many
[17:23] because he loves us
[17:25] and then the devil will come and whisper
[17:27] in our ear at the love of god amen and
[17:30] we'll turn it into something other than
[17:31] the love of god
[17:33] will turn it into you know god must not
[17:36] like me
[17:38] why does this always happen to me why me
[17:41] and but it's the love of god friends
[17:44] it's god's mercy to us if we could turn
[17:46] to second samuel
[17:48] i want to take a look
[17:50] uh through a few scriptures
[17:53] at the life of david and the sons
[17:57] and we know that these things were
[17:59] written for our examples
[18:01] these things that happened or for us
[18:04] so that we might learn how to live
[18:08] and they're written for this day
[18:11] but i want to look at second samuel
[18:12] chapter 3
[18:16] verse 2.
[18:20] ii samuel chapter 3 verse 2.
[18:25] and unto david were sons born in hebron
[18:28] and the firstborn was abnon
[18:30] of
[18:32] a high no no you know what
[18:34] this is not fun
[18:36] i know i'm so glad brother branham had
[18:39] to have his girlfriend read his
[18:40] scriptures
[18:42] when he started in the ministry amen
[18:44] makes me feel good when i have to read a
[18:46] heinous
[18:47] the jezreelites in his second chiliad of
[18:51] abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite
[18:53] and the third absalom the son of macau
[18:56] the daughter of taumayi king of gesher
[19:00] and the fourth adonijah the son of
[19:02] hageth and the fifth
[19:05] shafatiya the son of abbatol and the
[19:08] sixth
[19:09] by ingla david's wife these were born to
[19:12] david in hebron
[19:14] so he starts speaking of these first six
[19:16] sons and when you look at the first six
[19:18] sons that were born to him in hebron
[19:21] there's one that stands out i mean
[19:23] there's a few that stand out for
[19:24] different reasons but there's one here
[19:26] that stands out to me for the purpose
[19:28] that i want to use today and it's in
[19:30] verse three and it says in the third
[19:32] absalom the son of maraka the daughter
[19:34] of taumay king of gesher
[19:37] and so you find out that absalom comes
[19:40] from good stock
[19:43] absalom's mother
[19:45] is a daughter to the king of gesher
[19:49] and gesher was a strong kingdom on the
[19:53] north side of israel and at this time
[19:56] there was some relations between
[19:58] israel and and gesher but this is the
[20:01] king of gesher and the king of gesher's
[20:04] daughter is married to david who's king
[20:06] of israel so you have an alliance of two
[20:08] strong kingdoms
[20:10] and in the alliance of two strong
[20:12] kingdoms they produce absalom so in in
[20:15] the birth and the birth of these first
[20:17] six sons this is the first one that
[20:20] comes from royal stock
[20:23] like they all come from david we know
[20:24] that's real stock but on the mother side
[20:27] is the first one we have mentioned that
[20:28] comes from royal stock and so already
[20:32] absalom if you if you just look at the
[20:34] way he's born and who he comes from in
[20:36] his in his lineage absalom already is in
[20:40] an exalted position in his birth
[20:44] and we know the story of absalom that's
[20:46] not a good thing let's turn over to
[20:48] verse 14.
[20:54] verse 14
[20:57] or chapter 14. i'm sorry
[20:59] second samuel chapter 14.
[21:05] ii samuel 14 and 25
[21:14] but in all israel there was none to be
[21:17] so much praised as absalom
[21:20] uh-oh
[21:23] uh-oh
[21:26] see when we're born
[21:28] in this fallen condition with the human
[21:30] nature
[21:32] that's what we want to have said about
[21:34] us
[21:35] right
[21:37] and our fallen nature when we're born
[21:39] and not i'm not talking about an evil
[21:42] wicked nature that wants to murder and
[21:44] i'm just talking natural your natural
[21:46] birth the way you're born when you're
[21:48] born you want somebody to say this about
[21:50] you
[21:52] that's what we want i
[21:54] i mean it's a good thing right
[21:56] but for absalom it's a bad thing
[21:59] verse 25 but in all israel there was
[22:01] none to be so much praised as absalom
[22:03] for his beauty
[22:05] from the soul of his foot even to the
[22:07] crown of his head there was no blemish
[22:09] in him i love the way the bible is
[22:12] written i love i love the way god makes
[22:15] it so distinctly clear amen what the
[22:18] problem is the problem with absalom is
[22:20] his perfection
[22:22] the problem with lucifer was his
[22:24] perfection his wisdom his beauty amen
[22:26] his revelation his brightness and he was
[22:29] corrupted by his brightness by his
[22:32] understanding and knowledge of god he
[22:33] was corrupted he was full of wisdom
[22:35] perfect in beauty and he was corrupted
[22:38] by those very gifts
[22:42] amen
[22:44] gifts can cause a man's pride to come to
[22:46] the surface
[22:50] like nothing else can gifts can cause a
[22:52] man's pride to come to service and can
[22:54] lead to
[22:55] self-exaltation above the most high god
[22:59] and you say no i'm not seeing that above
[23:02] listen
[23:04] you say this is self-exaltation above
[23:07] the most high god
[23:09] but i want to remind you god is his word
[23:13] so the moment a moment a human being
[23:16] becomes exalted above the word he has
[23:19] exalted him above the most high god
[23:24] and now he has taken the same nature as
[23:26] lucifer
[23:29] because lucifer said i will exalt my
[23:30] throne above the stars of heaven i will
[23:32] be like the most high god and so the
[23:35] minute that that that a human being can
[23:38] exalt his own will his own desire above
[23:42] the word of god he is exalting himself
[23:46] above the most high god
[23:48] and you would never get the man to say
[23:50] that out of his lips he would never say
[23:52] that but that's exactly what's happening
[23:56] and so absalom was born
[23:59] in a danger zone
[24:01] i say absalom was born
[24:06] i mean the whole kingdom should have
[24:08] bowed down and prayed for him
[24:10] because he was set up for disaster
[24:15] from the soul of his foot even to the
[24:17] crown of his head there was no blemish
[24:19] in him this is what every woman that's
[24:22] ever been born once
[24:26] perfect in beauty not a blemish from the
[24:29] soul of his foot through the crown of
[24:31] his head not one blemish
[24:35] and you know
[24:36] when when those girls start moving into
[24:38] those teenage years that natural desire
[24:40] to be pretty which is not wickedness in
[24:43] itself but a natural desire to be pretty
[24:45] all of a sudden if somebody would say
[24:48] that about you when you hit 14 15 16
[24:50] you'd be like oh
[24:52] praise the lord
[24:57] not knowing
[24:59] that that could be the very thing that
[25:00] brings your destruction
[25:04] it'd be better to be born with a giant
[25:06] birthmark right in the center of your
[25:08] face
[25:10] than to have things too perfect
[25:14] and this is i mean this is not labor to
[25:16] see in preaching friends
[25:20] but it's the truth and now we understand
[25:22] our lives
[25:23] if we understand these things out of the
[25:25] scriptures and the way the way it works
[25:27] and the way it's always worked now we
[25:28] understand why god allows things to
[25:31] happen and why god keeps us and he keeps
[25:33] knocking us down and when we begin to
[25:35] prop something up god will knock our
[25:37] props out and sometimes it seems like
[25:40] the very god of heaven is against us
[25:43] i mean we know he's not we would never
[25:45] say he was but sometimes like everything
[25:47] i try fails and every time i try this it
[25:50] fails every time i go this direction it
[25:52] fails and
[25:53] i would say i would say you're only
[25:55] partially right amen the god of heaven
[25:57] is against your plan for self-security
[25:59] and self-exaltation but he's very much
[26:02] for you
[26:05] he may be against your pride but he's
[26:07] for
[26:08] you so
[26:10] so let's keep reading
[26:14] so from the soul of his foot even to the
[26:16] crown of his head there was no blemish
[26:18] in him
[26:20] and when he pulled his head for it was
[26:21] at every year's end that he pulled it
[26:23] because the hair was heavy on him there
[26:25] he pulled it he weighed the hair of his
[26:27] head at a 200 shekels after the king's
[26:30] weight
[26:31] praise the lord he had a big mop of hair
[26:35] and it was beautiful and he was
[26:38] beautiful and he was perfect amen and
[26:41] when we read this now we can we can read
[26:44] this and
[26:45] you can say who wants to be lucifer
[26:47] nobody puts their hands up
[26:49] who wants to be absalom nobody puts
[26:51] their hands up but the but but what was
[26:54] the description of lucifer perfection
[26:56] what was the description of absalom
[26:58] perfection
[27:00] but who did god choose to carry forth
[27:02] his program amen he would choose the
[27:04] imperfect he would choose to cast away
[27:06] he would use the nobodies he would use
[27:09] the ones with a tainted path with a
[27:11] tainted reputation with a question mark
[27:13] around their life
[27:15] because that is the one that god can
[27:17] take amen because they've already been a
[27:20] base they've borne a base they're born
[27:21] rejected and he can exalt them amen and
[27:24] if anybody god wanted to use was already
[27:26] in an exalted position like moses and
[27:29] like paul god knew how to break them out
[27:31] of that and bring them to nothing amen
[27:34] so that he could begin to use them for
[27:36] his kingdom work
[27:38] and that is the grace of god
[27:42] amen let's look at
[27:44] chapter 15 verse 1 now
[27:48] and it came to pass after this that
[27:50] absalom prepared him chariots and horses
[27:52] and 50 men to run before him and absalom
[27:55] rose up early and stood beside the way
[27:57] of the gate and it was so that when any
[28:00] man that had a controversy came to the
[28:02] king for judgment then absalom called
[28:04] unto him and said of what city art thou
[28:07] and he said i servant as of one of the
[28:08] tribes of israel and absalom said unto
[28:11] him see thy matters are good and right
[28:13] but there is no man deputed deputed of
[28:16] the king to hear thee
[28:18] absalom said moreover oh that i were
[28:21] made judge in the land that every man
[28:23] which hath any suit or cause might come
[28:25] unto me and i would do him justice
[28:29] and it was so that when any man came
[28:31] nigh to him to do him obscenes he put
[28:34] forth his hand and took him and kissed
[28:35] him
[28:36] and on the manner did absalom to all
[28:39] israel that came to the king for
[28:40] judgment so absalom stole the hearts of
[28:43] the men of israel
[28:46] absalom
[28:48] i'll say this way
[28:49] absalom was no dummy
[28:52] he was wise
[28:54] absalom was crafty
[28:57] he was subtle
[28:59] he was beautiful
[29:01] he he had everything going for him and
[29:03] in fact you know absalom also conspired
[29:06] to have his brother killed because his
[29:07] brother
[29:08] had raped his sister and absalom's full
[29:11] sister and he hated him and he had him
[29:13] killed and he was exiled and he left the
[29:15] kingdom but when he was exiled and left
[29:17] the kingdom he went to gesher to his
[29:19] grandfather's kingdom
[29:22] and was in gesher as a grandson of the
[29:24] king so i want to ask you what was that
[29:27] what was that exile like
[29:30] was it the back side of the desert
[29:32] where god molds character into men when
[29:35] he was exiled and put out from david he
[29:37] went to another strong kingdom and to
[29:39] the house of another strong king and he
[29:42] was there treated as royalty in the
[29:44] house of another strong king
[29:46] see there was nothing that would bring
[29:48] character to absalom
[29:50] even in his exile amen there was no
[29:53] punishment even in his exile i mean
[29:55] there was no abasing amen in his exile
[29:58] maybe maybe this is just me but maybe in
[30:01] his exile some of those lessons that he
[30:03] had learned about his perfection and his
[30:05] wisdom were reinforced not tore down
[30:09] maybe in gesher you know now all of a
[30:11] sudden he he
[30:13] he himself absalom
[30:16] is the one
[30:18] who can bridge these two mighty kingdoms
[30:22] he has a foot in each stronghold
[30:26] i should say
[30:28] putting him in a stronger position than
[30:30] all the other king's sons
[30:33] because he's got an ally to the north
[30:35] he's blood relation to the king
[30:39] so who knows what was going through his
[30:41] mind but you can see that the exile
[30:44] didn't change absalom in in his
[30:47] self-exaltation and his uh reflection of
[30:50] himself and his thoughts of himself so
[30:52] then through septility he begins to win
[30:54] the hearts of the people by just being
[30:57] overly kind to them
[30:59] and and
[31:00] showing love and affection and in wisdom
[31:02] he was stealing the hearts the
[31:04] scriptures as he was stealing the hearts
[31:06] of all of israel
[31:08] let's go to ii samuel 18.
[31:17] i'm just pulling little points we know
[31:19] there's a there's a long story here but
[31:20] i don't want to read through the whole
[31:21] story i just want to pull points out
[31:24] and then ii samuel 18 verse 18 i'd like
[31:27] to read now absalom in his lifetime had
[31:30] taken and reared up for himself a pillar
[31:32] which is in the king's dale for he said
[31:34] i have no son to keep my name in
[31:36] remembrance and he called the pillar
[31:38] after his own name and it is called into
[31:40] this day absalom's place
[31:43] praise god
[31:45] he's exposing his own nature
[31:48] he he he reared up a pillar unto himself
[31:53] and called it by his own name
[31:57] i said god that's dangerous
[32:00] dangerous that he thought himself worthy
[32:04] to have a monument erected after his
[32:06] name
[32:07] the fact that he thought that was a good
[32:09] idea is dangerous
[32:12] the fact that he thought that that was a
[32:15] good thing to do showed where his mind
[32:17] was and showed that he was absolutely in
[32:19] danger of destruction
[32:22] and we know he got his destruction his
[32:24] destruction came he tried to overthrow
[32:26] his father's kingdom and it's amazing
[32:28] how is as much as absalon had going for
[32:31] him as much as he had the love and
[32:33] affection of the people he had beauty he
[32:35] had perfection he had power and two
[32:37] kingdoms he had all of these things but
[32:39] it's amazing he was never satisfied with
[32:42] the portion that he had
[32:44] and where was absalom lacking where was
[32:47] absalom's need where where was he where
[32:49] was he in need for more i mean he had
[32:52] everything that he needed or wanted amen
[32:55] but it's never enough amen that
[32:57] self-exaltation is never satisfied
[32:59] enough
[33:01] and so absalom erected for himself a
[33:03] pillar he needed the notoriety he he
[33:05] needed the accomplishment he needed he
[33:08] felt himself worthy to have a monument
[33:10] erected after him and i say that's a
[33:12] disgrace
[33:14] first corinthians 10 12 says wherefore
[33:17] let him that thinketh he standeth take
[33:19] heed lest he fall
[33:22] let him that thinketh he standeth take
[33:23] heed lest he fall it's better to be flat
[33:26] on your face knowing that you can't
[33:28] stand
[33:30] it's better to know that you're not able
[33:32] you're not capable you you can't do it
[33:34] than to think
[33:35] i'm standing
[33:38] you know it's better to say without god
[33:40] there's no way i could stand
[33:44] now i want to we've looked at
[33:46] absalom
[33:47] now i want to look at solomon
[33:49] let's look at second samuel chapter 12.
[33:52] we'll go back a couple chapters here to
[33:54] chapter 12.
[33:57] and we know how samuel came about
[34:01] samuel was the product of david and
[34:04] bathsheba and we know that bathsheba was
[34:07] another man's wife bathsheba was the
[34:09] wife of uriah the hittite
[34:12] so she was the wife of a gentile
[34:16] a hittite
[34:18] and a hittat's wife and now now david
[34:22] when he's when when there's when we come
[34:24] to the season where kings go out to
[34:26] battle david was so secure in his
[34:28] kingdom and not in danger that he didn't
[34:30] have to go himself to fight the battles
[34:33] he had other people that he could send
[34:34] himself and so now you begin to see the
[34:36] danger of security
[34:40] and in his security he walking at the
[34:43] house top and begins to see bathsheba
[34:45] and he's tempted by her amen and because
[34:47] he's not out defending the kingdom
[34:49] because he has no immediate threat you
[34:52] realize that if if david had an
[34:54] immediate threat if there was somebody
[34:56] besieging the the the walls of jerusalem
[35:00] he would have never fell with bathsheba
[35:03] if he would have had a mighty kingdom
[35:05] that was in resurrect
[35:06] insurrection against his rule amen and
[35:09] threatening to come and fight him on his
[35:11] own land david would have went to battle
[35:13] amen but but god had got david into such
[35:17] a place under such blessings amen that
[35:19] david could relax back and it was in the
[35:21] relaxing back that david fell
[35:24] and so when you find yourself with demon
[35:27] powers beating on your walls and hurling
[35:29] stones over your wall every day of your
[35:31] life you can say thank you lord jesus
[35:34] for that that is your mercy and grace to
[35:36] me then i'm not going to relax back but
[35:38] i'm going to stay in the fight and i'm
[35:40] going to stay on guard and i'm going to
[35:42] stay vigilant and watchful because i've
[35:44] i've hardly been free from a battle
[35:48] my whole christian life
[35:51] and you say why why is it you know i
[35:54] used to live under the realm of
[35:55] self-deception
[35:56] that when i get through this it'll be
[35:58] better
[36:01] now as soon as i get through this it'll
[36:03] smooth out and be better once this is
[36:05] over amen everything will start to get
[36:07] better and then you realize it's not
[36:09] getting better that issue gets better
[36:11] and something else goes sour amen
[36:13] something else happens there's another
[36:14] problem there's another trouble amen
[36:16] there's things that you caused you've
[36:18] done things that you've not caused or
[36:20] not done but still affect you
[36:24] and and you begin to realize after a
[36:26] while
[36:27] these are good things
[36:30] we thought
[36:33] we can get the wrong notion
[36:36] that to be the bride of jesus christ
[36:39] means that god will treat me like
[36:42] absalom
[36:46] you understand
[36:48] but god might treat you like david
[36:55] david had struggles and troubles all the
[36:57] way through
[36:59] we think to be a child of god
[37:02] means that god will pick us up and set
[37:05] us on a pedestal and and and no troubles
[37:08] will come and there'll be no
[37:10] complications in life and i'll never
[37:12] have to deal with an issue
[37:14] and if anything comes against me
[37:16] lightning bolts from heaven will come
[37:17] down and strike it because i'm a child
[37:19] of god
[37:21] and we get the complete wrong
[37:24] understanding of what god is trying to
[37:27] do in his grace and mercy in our lives
[37:30] to keep us in trouble
[37:33] to keep us in the fight to keep us
[37:36] dependent and needy and watchful
[37:40] every hour of the day
[37:42] and and so we get the wrong notions and
[37:45] then sometimes we think when when so
[37:46] much trouble happens that why is this
[37:48] happening to me i'm a child of god and
[37:51] i'd say it's happening to you because
[37:53] you're a child of god
[37:56] because when god opened the book in this
[37:58] hour when he opened the word amen he
[38:00] unlocked a power and authority that i
[38:03] don't we haven't even fully realized yet
[38:06] he has taken the the title deed book of
[38:09] redemption amen and he has and he is
[38:12] he's taken the book and he's passed it
[38:15] down to his seventh church age messenger
[38:16] seven church age messengers turned and
[38:18] given it to the church now we have taken
[38:20] and eaten this book and what is this
[38:23] book it's the title deed of all of
[38:25] redemption everything that adam lost has
[38:27] been restored back to mankind amen and
[38:30] even if we haven't fully realized the
[38:32] full benefit of that and fully express
[38:34] and manifest the full benefit of it the
[38:36] truth is it's in the bride
[38:39] and how can god put that kind of power
[38:43] inside human flesh amen and let the
[38:46] human flesh live in such a realm of
[38:48] perfection that that power will go rogue
[38:51] on him
[38:57] say god thank you for what you've done
[38:59] for me
[39:03] i've never went without
[39:05] and i've never had too much
[39:08] and that's a good thing
[39:13] you see sometimes
[39:16] you know i use the financial example but
[39:19] you'll see sometimes somebody's blessed
[39:21] with finances
[39:23] and their health is an absolute wreck
[39:26] and they would trade their finances for
[39:28] health
[39:29] and you have some people that would
[39:30] change their health for finances
[39:32] those are the people who are really
[39:34] messed up
[39:40] you see god always has something
[39:43] to keep his children in check
[39:46] you see somebody with blessings on one
[39:48] hand but their family is a wreck
[39:52] they have a child that is just hurting
[39:54] them so bad
[39:55] and causing such pain and grief
[39:58] houses paid for
[39:59] enough finances for everything health is
[40:01] good
[40:03] but i've got this heartbreaking
[40:05] situation in my life that keeps me on my
[40:07] face before going
[40:11] see
[40:12] none of the children of god are free
[40:13] from this
[40:15] and it's his love and mercy to us
[40:17] if we could just see it that way it
[40:19] would change our attitude
[40:21] it would change the way we perceive the
[40:23] world around us if we could just see
[40:25] what god's doing
[40:27] so
[40:29] david in a relaxed state when when he
[40:32] come to a certain security in his
[40:34] kingdom
[40:36] he was set up to fail
[40:38] and he fell of his own accord he fell of
[40:41] his own lust
[40:43] he took bathsheba unto himself and had
[40:46] uriah the hittite killed
[40:49] and so this is this is this this becomes
[40:52] a public disaster
[40:54] and nathan the prophet comes and and he
[40:57] and he explains the situation and and
[40:59] david repents but
[41:00] but from that union comes a child and
[41:02] that child is cursed by god and that
[41:04] child dies and then you know once uriah
[41:08] is dead god takes beth or
[41:10] david takes bathsheba to himself and he
[41:12] marries bathsheba and after the first
[41:14] child dies amen now the the second child
[41:18] or the first child of their marriage
[41:20] union after they're married
[41:22] comes solomon
[41:24] now if you just contrast solomon with
[41:26] absalom
[41:28] how did absalom come into this world he
[41:30] come in this world destined to be a
[41:32] powerful king
[41:35] solomon comes into this world through a
[41:37] tainted
[41:38] story
[41:40] that's not pleasant to read
[41:43] that's not pleasant to talk about that
[41:46] isn't you know isn't the greatest
[41:49] accomplishment in david's life
[41:52] and through this disaster through this
[41:54] horrible family situation through the
[41:57] through the trouble it caused the
[41:58] kingdom through the shame that it and
[42:00] reproach it brought against david
[42:02] through all of that comes solomon
[42:06] and we pick it up in second samuel 12
[42:09] and 24
[42:11] at the birth of solomon and it says and
[42:13] david comforted bathsheba his wife and
[42:16] went under her and lay with her and she
[42:18] bear a son and he called his name
[42:19] solomon and the lord loved him
[42:23] and he went by the hand of nathan the
[42:25] prophet and he called his name jedediah
[42:28] because of the lord and jedediah means
[42:30] beloved of jehovah
[42:34] and you think to yourself
[42:35] how could god love this
[42:39] this was never said about absalom
[42:42] david loved absalom and david's heart
[42:44] cried for absalom after he died but we
[42:46] never have god say this about absalom
[42:49] but we have god himself say this about
[42:51] solomon that he loved him amen and had
[42:54] nathan the prophet named him jedediah
[42:56] means beloved of jehovah amen god loved
[42:59] him amen because god has chosen the base
[43:02] things
[43:03] the things that are not amen to bring
[43:06] them not the things that are amen for
[43:08] for whatever reason amen this is what
[43:11] god wanted to use when he was going to
[43:12] display amen the kingdom of christ and
[43:15] the reign of solomon the millennial
[43:17] reign the golden age he had amen to take
[43:20] that vessel and start him has nothing
[43:23] amen with a coming through a bad union
[43:26] amen that came a bad way amen and he had
[43:28] to bring solomon up through that so that
[43:31] he could have a vessel that he could use
[43:33] because that ministry was going to be
[43:36] the type of jesus christ in the
[43:37] millennium
[43:39] see god
[43:40] doesn't doesn't work everything through
[43:42] perfection amen because that's
[43:44] detrimental to us as human beings but
[43:47] god will bring down the lowly and if
[43:49] it's high he'll bring it low so that he
[43:51] can bring it back up to something he can
[43:53] use
[43:55] and then you realize the whole thing
[43:57] this whole thing is for god to have
[43:59] vessels he can use
[44:02] it's not about my money it's not about
[44:04] my health it's not about my family it's
[44:06] not about my church it's not about my
[44:08] happiness not about my pleasure not
[44:10] about what i accomplish in this life
[44:12] amen really when it comes down to it
[44:14] when you get down to the nuts and bolts
[44:16] it's all about god having a tabernacle
[44:19] and flesh that he can express his word
[44:21] through that he can move his program
[44:23] that he can display himself that he can
[44:25] tell his story that he can act out his
[44:27] drama
[44:32] and then you then you begin to look at
[44:34] your life differently
[44:36] god just wants a vessel
[44:39] that's all he wants he just wants a
[44:41] vessel a vessel that he can use
[44:46] a vessel where he'll get the glory
[44:50] let's turn to first kings
[44:56] first kings chapter 3.
[45:09] when god was going to fulfill the
[45:11] prophecy of isaiah and come through a
[45:13] virgin
[45:14] he did it in such a way
[45:16] that that he would choose a virgin
[45:20] from a base city
[45:22] in israel from nazareth
[45:25] not from jerusalem from nazareth
[45:29] and he would do it in such a way it
[45:30] would be stunts in private with gabriel
[45:33] privately visiting her
[45:35] that god
[45:36] god would would send uh to the uh
[45:40] officials to the priest to the the
[45:42] rabbis and to the religious leaders and
[45:44] political leaders god would not send
[45:47] them the confirmation that her story is
[45:49] true
[45:50] not in a way they could accept he sent
[45:52] it to the wise men but they didn't
[45:53] accept that and he sent it through
[45:54] shepherds but they didn't accept that
[45:56] either
[45:57] but god would choose this little virgin
[45:59] girl from nazareth
[46:01] and
[46:02] and he would tell her something
[46:04] privately
[46:07] and nobody else heard the conversation
[46:10] there were no witnesses to that
[46:12] conversation
[46:14] and he would bring it through a
[46:16] reputation and through gossip and
[46:18] through a lie that said that she had
[46:21] been unfaithful to her promise to her
[46:23] husband
[46:24] and that she was impregnated while she
[46:26] was betrothed to another
[46:29] and god wouldn't stop the lie
[46:33] and god amen would not prove it wrong to
[46:36] defend mary in her telling of the story
[46:39] because god wanted it this way
[46:45] because he comes through humility he
[46:47] comes through the low he comes to the
[46:48] base he comes through the knot
[46:51] the nothings
[46:54] and that's how god works
[46:58] first kings three and five
[47:01] solomon has now become king
[47:04] and now in in first kings chapter three
[47:07] verse five he says in gibeon the lord
[47:08] appeared to solomon in a dream by night
[47:11] and god said ask what i shall give thee
[47:13] and solomon said thou has shown unto thy
[47:15] servant david my father great mercy
[47:17] according as he walked before thee in
[47:19] truth and in righteousness
[47:21] and in in an uprightness of heart with
[47:23] thee and thou has kept for him the great
[47:26] kindness
[47:27] that thou has given him a son to sit on
[47:29] his throne
[47:30] as it is this day
[47:32] i want you to look at the humility in
[47:34] solomon's words
[47:36] solomon didn't see in himself any merit
[47:38] for the throne
[47:41] how do you think absalom what would his
[47:43] conversation be like to god
[47:48] but solomon says
[47:50] this day you have showed great kindness
[47:52] and mercy to my father and keeping your
[47:54] promise to him that he would have a son
[47:56] on the throne it wasn't solomon's merits
[47:58] it wasn't solomon's effort it wasn't his
[48:00] birth it wasn't the power in his lineage
[48:02] amen amen solomon had nothing amen to
[48:05] boast about about this position that god
[48:07] had put him but he recognized it had
[48:09] nothing to do with him it had everything
[48:11] to do with a promise that god promised
[48:13] to david and god was using him to keep
[48:16] his word
[48:20] amen if god
[48:22] has called you as the bride of jesus
[48:24] christ he's doing it to keep his word
[48:30] amen
[48:32] he goes on to say
[48:38] verse 7 and now o lord my god thou has
[48:40] made thy servant king instead of david
[48:43] my father and i am but a little child
[48:46] and i know not how to go out or come in
[48:49] and thy servant is in the midst of thy
[48:51] people which thou has chosen a great
[48:53] people that cannot be numbered nor
[48:55] counted for multitude
[48:57] give therefore thy servant an
[48:59] understanding heart to judge thy people
[49:01] that i may discern between good and bad
[49:03] for who is able to judge this thy so
[49:06] great a people
[49:08] oh this is what god wants friends
[49:13] this is exactly why he loves solomon
[49:16] this is exactly why solomon was born the
[49:18] way he was born this is why solomon was
[49:20] put into this position because of this
[49:23] attitude right here this is the attitude
[49:25] god wants amen solomon saw the people as
[49:29] greater than himself
[49:32] amen he wasn't exalted above the people
[49:35] because he was the greatest among the
[49:37] people that was absalom absalom i don't
[49:40] know what the conversation would have
[49:42] been like but god come to absalom amen
[49:44] absalom would have said hey god you made
[49:46] a good choice
[49:48] this is just me there's no bible for
[49:50] this
[49:52] i mean there's examples but
[49:54] you made a good choice
[49:56] you did a good job thank you i got it
[49:59] from here
[50:02] what would you like
[50:03] um
[50:04] a little more of what you've already
[50:06] done would be sufficient
[50:08] a little more money a little more
[50:09] prestige a little more honor
[50:13] but solomon's attitude is totally
[50:15] different he says i'm but a little child
[50:21] i'm but a little child and i don't know
[50:24] how to go out or to come in before so
[50:26] great a people
[50:28] i don't know how to act like a king i
[50:30] don't know how to be a king i i don't
[50:32] know how to judge rightly i don't know
[50:34] how to take care this is so great of
[50:36] people god i'm going to mess this up if
[50:39] you don't help me
[50:45] god you've called me to be a king and a
[50:47] priest
[50:48] but i feel like a little child
[50:52] you've said that i am now a king and a
[50:54] priest that's what your word says i
[50:56] believe it you have taken me from the
[50:58] miry clay you have taken the lowly
[51:00] you've taken the base you've taken the
[51:02] nothing and you have lifted me up far
[51:04] above what i deserve lord and you have
[51:06] called me your bride and you've called
[51:08] me your child but god i'm such a little
[51:10] town and i don't even know how to talk i
[51:13] don't know how to be a king and a priest
[51:18] god you've called me bride but i don't
[51:20] know how to be a bride
[51:24] can we say that can we be honest and say
[51:27] i don't even know i the world is so
[51:30] crazy and changing moment by moment that
[51:32] i have nothing figured out anymore
[51:36] i don't even know how to be a bride in
[51:38] this next situation i don't know how to
[51:39] be a bride when things change i don't
[51:41] know how to be a king and priest in this
[51:43] situation i don't i know what you said
[51:45] and i believe it and i know who i am
[51:47] because you've called me amen but i
[51:49] don't know i don't know how to do this
[51:51] lord i don't know what you want in this
[51:53] hour i don't know what you want to come
[51:55] out of my mouth i don't know how to
[51:57] think right how to talk right how to be
[51:59] right i need something from you
[52:07] i think if we could pray like that
[52:08] that's exactly what he wants and that's
[52:10] why he's chosen us who doesn't know
[52:12] anything
[52:15] that's why he's chosen amen that's why
[52:18] he's chosen the things that are not the
[52:20] things that are average or below average
[52:27] amen
[52:28] and now all of a sudden
[52:30] the the fact that we're nothing
[52:32] has become better
[52:35] has become reassuring
[52:37] has become comforting
[52:40] solomon had the right attitude
[52:48] verse 8 again
[52:50] and thy servant is in the midst of thy
[52:51] people which thou has chosen a great
[52:54] people
[52:55] that cannot be numbered nor counted for
[52:56] multitude give therefore thy servant an
[52:58] understanding heart to judge thy people
[53:01] that i may discern between good and bad
[53:04] for who is able to judge this thy so
[53:06] great of people
[53:09] and the speech pleased the lord that
[53:12] solomon had asked this thing
[53:15] and god said unto him because thou has
[53:17] asked this thing thou has not asked for
[53:19] thyself long life neither has thou asked
[53:22] riches for thyself nor has asked thy the
[53:24] life of thine enemies but has asked for
[53:27] thyself understanding to discern
[53:29] judgment behold i have done according to
[53:31] thy words lo i have given thee a wise
[53:34] and an understanding heart so that thou
[53:36] was so that there was none like thee
[53:39] before thee neither after thee shall any
[53:41] arise like unto thee
[53:43] and i've also given thee that which thou
[53:45] has not asked both riches and honor so
[53:48] that there shall not be any among the
[53:50] kings like unto thee all the days of my
[53:52] life
[53:54] all the days of thy life
[53:57] see
[53:59] if you want
[54:03] if if you want the blessings of god to
[54:05] remain in your life
[54:08] then don't ask for the blessings of god
[54:13] ask for an understanding heart
[54:16] that i can conduct myself
[54:18] the way i should and the position you've
[54:21] put me in
[54:23] that you've raised me up
[54:25] you've pulled me up out of the earth
[54:28] you've dusted me off you've washed me in
[54:30] sanctification amen you've cleansed me
[54:32] by your blood you've filled me with your
[54:34] spirit you've called me a king and a
[54:36] priest you've called me a bride
[54:40] but god i need an understanding heart
[54:42] how to act in this position you've put
[54:44] me in
[54:48] you know it's
[54:50] dangerous it's dangerous when we
[54:55] begin
[54:56] to think
[54:57] that god did a good job when he picked
[54:59] me
[55:02] because i've got the tools that he needs
[55:06] that i can see why he picked me for this
[55:08] i can see that because i've got this and
[55:09] i've got that
[55:15] when we become when we begin to feel in
[55:17] our flesh
[55:18] and our human side
[55:20] worthy
[55:22] are capable of the calling
[55:26] i think that's the time to go back down
[55:28] to our knees and say god
[55:31] i'm just a
[55:32] child i'm just a human being
[55:36] i'm just in human flesh like all other
[55:38] human flesh
[55:40] this dirt
[55:41] is no better wiser capable than any
[55:45] other pile of dirt
[55:48] but yet god you've put something on the
[55:50] inside that you're calling to come forth
[55:52] in this life
[55:53] you're calling for your queen to rise on
[55:56] the scene and unite with you you're
[55:58] calling for for
[56:00] see this day is calling for a display of
[56:03] jesus christ in the formation of his
[56:05] bride
[56:06] that's what this hour is calling for it
[56:08] is calling amen for the rising of the
[56:11] bride to her position not because she's
[56:13] special not because she's able but
[56:16] because that's what the word says
[56:19] the word calls for jesus christ to be in
[56:22] the formation of his bride in this hour
[56:24] that we're living and in order to do
[56:26] that he has got to take lumps of clay
[56:29] that he has dropped attributes of
[56:30] himself in and he has got to call them
[56:33] back by the calling of his word and he
[56:35] has got to wash them with the water of
[56:37] his word and he has got to fill them
[56:38] with his own life to quicken that seed
[56:40] on the inside and he's got to lift that
[56:43] bride up into a position where he can
[56:45] display himself through that bride
[56:50] but that's what he's doing
[56:52] that's his work and that's his purpose
[56:55] and that's for his glory
[56:58] and on the human side we've got to
[57:01] recognize that this is an impossibility
[57:04] if he doesn't give me something if he
[57:06] doesn't do something for me there is
[57:08] absolutely no way the only thing i can
[57:11] do is mess this up
[57:15] the only thing that i can do is ruin
[57:18] what the good thing god wants to do if
[57:20] i'm left to myself god i need something
[57:23] i need something for you i'm but a child
[57:26] i'm but a human i'm just incapable as
[57:29] incapable can be god i need you to give
[57:31] me a heart of understanding i need you
[57:33] to give me wisdom from your word i need
[57:35] you to give me your spirit amen to pull
[57:38] out everything that you've put inside
[57:40] because me as a human being i don't know
[57:42] what to do next
[57:45] and most decisions that i've made have
[57:47] been wrong
[57:51] oh if we could just be honest
[57:54] we could just be honest
[58:01] see
[58:04] let's look at first samuel i want to
[58:06] look at david
[58:10] we're going to find out
[58:12] as solomon starts off here
[58:15] he has the nature of his father
[58:20] but you realize
[58:22] absalom didn't have the nature of david
[58:28] absalom had a different nature
[58:31] and absalom's mother
[58:33] i don't remember how to pronounce her
[58:34] name but her name means oppression
[58:40] amen
[58:42] so absalom was a product of the
[58:44] oppressive church
[58:50] but david was a product
[58:54] of the shamed humble
[58:56] wife of a gentile
[59:01] and they
[59:02] expressed two different natures but
[59:04] solomon was able to express the nature
[59:06] of his father david
[59:08] let's look at first samuel 24 and 4.
[59:13] this is after david has been anointed by
[59:15] samuel to be king over israel the
[59:16] anointing always been poured over him he
[59:19] has showed up and killed goliath
[59:21] he has been a mighty man in the army of
[59:23] saul and served the king
[59:25] but now saul's heart is turned against
[59:27] him and he's chasing him he's chasing
[59:29] him from cave to cave from wilderness
[59:32] spot to wilderness spot
[59:34] and now they find themselves in a cave
[59:36] together david and saul and saul lays
[59:38] down to sleep
[59:40] we pick it up in verse 4 it says in the
[59:42] men of david said unto him behold the
[59:44] day of which the lord said unto thee
[59:46] behold i will deliver thine enemy into
[59:48] thine hand that thou mayest do to him as
[59:50] it shall seem good unto thee
[59:53] then david arose and cut off the skirt
[59:55] of saul saul's robe privately
[59:58] and it came to pass afterward that
[1:00:00] david's heart smote him because he had
[1:00:02] cut off saul's skirt
[1:00:05] you realize
[1:00:06] his friends were telling him to kill
[1:00:08] saul
[1:00:11] you should kill him
[1:00:12] you this is your chance god and listen
[1:00:15] god has delivered him into your hand
[1:00:21] david is in the cave hiding amen saul's
[1:00:25] chasing after them david's in there with
[1:00:27] some of his mighty men and
[1:00:29] and and saul comes in and lays down the
[1:00:32] sleep at his feet basically
[1:00:35] and his men says get him get him now
[1:00:38] this is your time amen obviously god has
[1:00:41] brought him to your feet
[1:00:46] see how see how diabolical human
[1:00:49] reasoning is
[1:00:50] because it sounds so good
[1:00:54] i mean of all the caves he could have
[1:00:56] went into he come into this one it's god
[1:00:59] it's got to be god
[1:01:04] and i say it is god
[1:01:06] it absolutely is god but not for the
[1:01:09] destruction of saul but for the
[1:01:11] perfection of david
[1:01:15] but the human reasoning amen will now
[1:01:18] take the human will and human desire and
[1:01:20] take the circumstances and evoke the
[1:01:23] human will into god's will
[1:01:26] and through reasoning make human desire
[1:01:29] god's will
[1:01:35] and david compromised
[1:01:39] he didn't kill saul but he just went
[1:01:41] over there
[1:01:43] to teach him a lesson
[1:01:45] to prove a point
[1:01:47] he took out his sword and he cut part of
[1:01:49] his skirt off
[1:01:51] to shame him to prove something to make
[1:01:53] a point
[1:01:55] took part of his skirt off
[1:01:58] and after he had done it his heart smote
[1:02:00] him
[1:02:04] how many of us in the same situation
[1:02:06] would be proud at the at the perfection
[1:02:09] of our character not killing him
[1:02:14] you see the reality here friends
[1:02:19] we'd have walked out of there yeah god
[1:02:22] delivered him into my hands and they
[1:02:24] were trying to get me to kill him but i
[1:02:25] knew that would be wrong so all i did
[1:02:27] was just prove a point and shame him a
[1:02:28] little bit
[1:02:34] bible's so beautiful friends
[1:02:36] it just takes and unravels us layer by
[1:02:38] layer until you're just exposed before
[1:02:41] god
[1:02:45] so
[1:02:47] so david
[1:02:48] verse 5 and it came to pass afterward
[1:02:50] that david's heart smote him because he
[1:02:52] had cut off saul's skirt
[1:02:54] and he said unto his men the lord forbid
[1:02:56] that i should do this thing unto my
[1:02:58] master
[1:02:59] the lord's
[1:03:00] anointed to stretch forth my hand
[1:03:03] against him seeing he is the anointed
[1:03:06] of the lord
[1:03:10] this saul anointed to the lord
[1:03:13] was wicked
[1:03:14] it was doing wicked deeds
[1:03:17] for no reason he was trying to murder
[1:03:19] david
[1:03:20] he had thrown a javelin at him he got so
[1:03:23] angry at throwing a javelin at his own
[1:03:24] son jonathan for defending david
[1:03:27] he was chasing david and david was also
[1:03:30] god's anointed
[1:03:33] right
[1:03:34] and so you have one anointed
[1:03:36] of the lord chasing another anointed of
[1:03:38] the lord
[1:03:43] and
[1:03:44] and he's and he's running him down and
[1:03:46] he's breathing threats against him and
[1:03:49] and and david is and david is trying to
[1:03:52] stay out of trouble
[1:03:55] fleeing running away not fighting back
[1:03:57] amen and then saul winds up right at his
[1:04:00] feet and all of his friends are saying
[1:04:02] get him get him get him get him get him
[1:04:03] it's the lord it's the lord it's the
[1:04:05] lord and it looked like it could be the
[1:04:06] lord
[1:04:09] and david does this little thing that
[1:04:12] that seemingly wasn't anything
[1:04:14] didn't really harm him didn't really
[1:04:16] hurt him never really touched him just a
[1:04:18] small thing but as soon as he did it his
[1:04:20] heart smote him and he told his friends
[1:04:23] i i shouldn't have done that
[1:04:26] because that's the lord's anointing
[1:04:29] see once god had sent a prophet to pour
[1:04:31] the anointing on samuel
[1:04:33] or in saul
[1:04:36] saul was god's anointed
[1:04:39] and david
[1:04:42] listen i i hope we can catch this
[1:04:46] david wasn't respecting saul
[1:04:50] david was respecting god
[1:04:54] saul wasn't worthy in himself of respect
[1:04:58] saul didn't deserve
[1:05:00] if saul got what he deserved he should
[1:05:02] have got a knife to the throat
[1:05:04] but david david's oh david's heart smote
[1:05:08] him not because of his love for saul or
[1:05:11] his reverence for saul's character
[1:05:16] but his reverence for god
[1:05:19] if god anointed that vessel
[1:05:21] i'm not touching that vessel no matter
[1:05:24] how bad that vessel is god anointed that
[1:05:26] vessel
[1:05:31] now let's take it down to god's anointed
[1:05:33] people
[1:05:36] god has anointed his bride in this day
[1:05:38] and it doesn't matter amen what what
[1:05:41] somebody else is doing how you could say
[1:05:44] it's wrong and they shouldn't do that
[1:05:45] they shouldn't say those things amen but
[1:05:47] we've got to have enough respect for god
[1:05:49] not to touch god's anointed
[1:05:52] if that's a child of god children of god
[1:05:54] can do wrong
[1:05:56] children of god can do wicked and be
[1:05:58] evil
[1:05:59] die not be evil but do evil
[1:06:01] you understand children of god can do
[1:06:03] evil deeds children of god can do wrong
[1:06:06] amen anointed of god can persecute other
[1:06:08] anointed of god it can happen and they
[1:06:10] can still be children of god
[1:06:16] and god will let it happen
[1:06:19] to perfect us
[1:06:22] and say i will not touch god's anointed
[1:06:27] we read wednesday michael when he was
[1:06:30] disputing with the devil
[1:06:33] over moses's body
[1:06:35] he did not bring a railing accusation
[1:06:40] he said the lord rebuke you the lord
[1:06:41] deal with you
[1:06:43] i'm not
[1:06:44] i'm just doing what i'm told to do the
[1:06:46] lord will deal with you
[1:06:48] why can't we do that for each other
[1:06:51] this was the devil
[1:06:54] not even a brother
[1:06:56] it was a devil
[1:07:00] see david
[1:07:02] one thing about david that was david's
[1:07:06] david's mark of david's character is
[1:07:08] david loved the lord
[1:07:11] and wanted to please the lord
[1:07:16] let's look at second samuel chapter 12
[1:07:18] again
[1:07:20] back to second samuel 12.
[1:07:24] this is after david's evil deed
[1:07:26] and having uriah kill
[1:07:29] committing adultery with bathsheba
[1:07:33] nathan the prophet comes to him and
[1:07:34] speaks to him second samuel 12 and 9.
[1:07:41] he says wherefore hast thou despised the
[1:07:43] commandment of the lord to do evil in
[1:07:45] his sight thou has killed uriah the
[1:07:47] hittite with the sword and has taken his
[1:07:50] wife to be thy wife and has slain him
[1:07:52] with the sword of the children of ammon
[1:07:54] now therefore the sword shall never
[1:07:55] depart from nine house because thou has
[1:07:58] despised me
[1:08:02] let's go back up and read verse nine
[1:08:04] again a slow down
[1:08:07] wherefore has thou despised the
[1:08:09] commandment of the lord
[1:08:12] what was the commandment of the lord
[1:08:13] thou shalt not commit adultery
[1:08:16] one of the ten commandments
[1:08:18] first you despise the commandment of the
[1:08:20] lord
[1:08:21] but then god says
[1:08:23] he has despised me
[1:08:27] see david
[1:08:29] in his own willful desire and his own
[1:08:31] lust took another man's wife and killed
[1:08:34] that man but it wasn't that he despised
[1:08:37] the man god didn't see david despising
[1:08:39] that man
[1:08:41] he saw david despising him
[1:08:46] so if we want god's view on our sin this
[1:08:48] is it right here
[1:08:50] on our willfulness and on our sin
[1:08:58] now therefore the sword shall never
[1:09:00] depart from thine house because thou has
[1:09:02] despised
[1:09:03] me
[1:09:04] and has taken the wife of uriah the
[1:09:06] hittite to be thy wife
[1:09:10] verse 13
[1:09:11] and david said unto nathan i have sinned
[1:09:14] against
[1:09:16] uriah
[1:09:18] bathsheba the people
[1:09:21] my family
[1:09:23] i have sinned against
[1:09:25] the lord
[1:09:30] see this brings gravity to the situation
[1:09:34] when we do wrong
[1:09:38] we fail to keep the word of the lord
[1:09:41] we haven't just hurt whoever was hurt
[1:09:47] but we have despised
[1:09:50] when when
[1:09:52] when david failed to keep the
[1:09:53] commandment god said you despised my
[1:09:55] commandments
[1:09:59] when
[1:10:00] then he says when you despise my
[1:10:02] commandment you despised me
[1:10:07] and david had enough sense to say i
[1:10:09] sinned against the lord
[1:10:11] what i did in not keeping his
[1:10:14] commandment i sinned against the lord i
[1:10:18] i
[1:10:18] am sorry
[1:10:20] that
[1:10:21] it was against the lord that i had
[1:10:23] sinned
[1:10:26] see
[1:10:28] david was a man after god's own heart
[1:10:32] and david honored and respected and
[1:10:35] loved the lord
[1:10:36] he didn't just love his position david
[1:10:38] was a king but he was a king who was
[1:10:40] able to repent
[1:10:42] he was a king who was able to say he was
[1:10:43] wrong he was a king he was able to stand
[1:10:45] in the gap he was a king who was able to
[1:10:47] weep
[1:10:49] do you realize david was the great
[1:10:51] leader and king of mighty men
[1:10:55] i can imagine if i could dramatize
[1:10:58] david is anointed to be king
[1:11:02] anointed by samuel the prophet you'll be
[1:11:04] a king
[1:11:06] and under the revelation that anointing
[1:11:08] he goes and with great faith he kills
[1:11:10] goliath
[1:11:13] he fights many a battles until the
[1:11:15] people would sing
[1:11:16] saul has killed us thousands but david
[1:11:18] has killed his ten thousand a mighty
[1:11:19] warrior mighty leader mighty king mighty
[1:11:22] anointed of god amen to be amen to to
[1:11:25] bring the kingdom into a place where god
[1:11:27] wants it to come mighty things were
[1:11:29] happening amen can you imagine he's he's
[1:11:31] running from he's running from uh a saul
[1:11:35] and saul's chasing him and and he's
[1:11:36] running like a scared rabbit from place
[1:11:38] to place to place not because he can't
[1:11:40] destroy saul not because he's not a
[1:11:42] mighty word not because he can't i mean
[1:11:44] i believe david could have went
[1:11:45] toe-to-toe with saul and destroyed saul
[1:11:49] it wasn't fear of saul that had him
[1:11:51] running from cave to cave it was fear it
[1:11:53] was fear of god that had him running
[1:11:55] from cave to cave to cave
[1:11:58] he didn't want the confrontation with
[1:12:00] saul he didn't want the fight he did not
[1:12:02] want it to come to a battle on the
[1:12:04] battlefield because he did not want to
[1:12:06] touch the lord's anointed
[1:12:09] so he would run away so that there was
[1:12:11] never a battle
[1:12:16] i wonder how many times we show up
[1:12:22] how many times do we show up to a place
[1:12:27] hoping
[1:12:28] somebody will just say the right thing
[1:12:34] we show up
[1:12:35] ready for the fight we show up looking
[1:12:37] for the fight we show up to prove a
[1:12:39] point to make a point there
[1:12:44] but david
[1:12:46] because he loved the lord and he
[1:12:48] respected what the lord had done
[1:12:50] was running from cave to cave to cave
[1:12:53] not because he was afraid of saul
[1:12:57] not because he didn't know who he was
[1:13:01] because he wasn't going to have that
[1:13:03] confrontation with saul
[1:13:06] saul
[1:13:07] was god's responsibility
[1:13:09] god had anointed him god had placed him
[1:13:11] as king god was in charge
[1:13:14] david it wasn't david's job
[1:13:19] david had respect to god and respect to
[1:13:22] his word
[1:13:23] and he was a man after god's own heart
[1:13:26] and i tell you friends that's the way i
[1:13:28] want to live
[1:13:30] i'm ashamed of myself for showing up
[1:13:32] wanting the fight
[1:13:34] i've done it
[1:13:36] i've showed up hoping the conversation
[1:13:38] would go this way
[1:13:41] because i had all my bullets loaded
[1:13:43] click
[1:13:45] all my quotes click
[1:13:47] i had them in a speed file i could pull
[1:13:49] them up on my phone
[1:13:53] i had the places marked in my bible
[1:13:56] click
[1:13:58] click
[1:14:05] you see banaya
[1:14:07] the gentile warrior who had went into a
[1:14:09] pit on a snowy day and killed a lion
[1:14:13] the other one who
[1:14:14] who had killed 300 standing in a field
[1:14:17] of lentils filled 300 philistines and
[1:14:19] wouldn't give up the lentil field
[1:14:22] these are mighty men mighty warriors
[1:14:25] they come into the cave one day
[1:14:26] following a mighty leader an anointed of
[1:14:28] the lord amen following the one who's
[1:14:30] going to be king amen the mighty man
[1:14:34] where's david
[1:14:35] oh
[1:14:36] he's back in the back playing the harp
[1:14:38] crying again
[1:14:39] he's been crying for three days
[1:14:48] you walk over and you see david the
[1:14:49] killer of goliath the mighty mighty
[1:14:52] warrior the anointed of the lord
[1:14:54] and he doesn't know what god wants him
[1:14:56] to do
[1:14:57] and he's strumming on a harp crying
[1:15:00] writing poems
[1:15:02] singing to the lord
[1:15:04] lord rescue me in my affliction lord
[1:15:07] lift me out of the miry pit lord
[1:15:12] what would you think
[1:15:13] if you had just went to a snowy pit
[1:15:16] a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion
[1:15:20] and your great leaders over there
[1:15:21] strumming a harp crying
[1:15:23] for day after day after day
[1:15:30] that's what god liked
[1:15:33] god liked having a man
[1:15:35] who was weak
[1:15:37] who was needy
[1:15:39] who was humble
[1:15:40] who would weep before the lord and say
[1:15:42] lord i i need you to rescue me i can't
[1:15:45] rescue myself i need you to deliver me
[1:15:47] lord everybody's against me they're all
[1:15:49] coming after me lord i'm looking to you
[1:15:51] to deliver me god
[1:15:54] to cry and to say i have no answer i
[1:15:58] don't know what to do next i don't know
[1:16:00] i don't know where we're going from here
[1:16:01] can you imagine the 400 warriors that
[1:16:04] have gathered to david saying david what
[1:16:05] are we doing next i don't know what
[1:16:07] we're doing next lord hasn't told me yet
[1:16:11] brothers let's sing a song
[1:16:12] [Laughter]
[1:16:19] my strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:16:22] the way up is down
[1:16:24] i mean god has a different desire than
[1:16:26] ours
[1:16:27] let's go to philemon chapter one
[1:16:33] when i was a little boy i wanted to be
[1:16:34] david
[1:16:43] giants falling people singing songs to
[1:16:46] you
[1:16:51] i never thought about david hiding in a
[1:16:53] cave weeping before the lord
[1:16:55] crying day after day because he didn't
[1:16:58] know why his life was in the mess he
[1:16:59] didn't know why these things were
[1:17:00] happening he didn't know why saul hated
[1:17:02] him so bad and he didn't know why he was
[1:17:04] so afflicted
[1:17:06] i didn't see that part
[1:17:08] i didn't see the part where god loved
[1:17:10] him so much that he got away with
[1:17:12] nothing
[1:17:13] every move he made brought a heavy rod
[1:17:17] of correction upon david
[1:17:20] that wasn't the part i was looking at
[1:17:21] when i was a little boy
[1:17:23] i just was looking at the shepherd boy
[1:17:25] who shocked them all
[1:17:27] right
[1:17:27] showed up to the show and took over
[1:17:31] but i didn't realize what it took
[1:17:34] to have that success
[1:17:36] to have that victory
[1:17:38] that wasn't david who killed goliath
[1:17:40] that was god who killed goliath he just
[1:17:43] used david
[1:17:45] that wasn't david who killed his ten
[1:17:47] thousand that was god who killed the ten
[1:17:49] thousand but he was using david because
[1:17:52] he had a vessel that he could use
[1:17:56] and you know why they could sing the
[1:17:58] accolades of david above the accolades
[1:18:00] of saul
[1:18:01] because saul was working for saul
[1:18:06] but david was working for god and when
[1:18:08] god got a man in his hand under his
[1:18:11] control he could do more with that man
[1:18:13] amen than saul could do with his whole
[1:18:15] army
[1:18:18] saul was fighting for his notoriety
[1:18:21] saul was fighting to hear the ladies
[1:18:23] sing the song
[1:18:26] david wasn't fighting for the song david
[1:18:28] was fighting for the word
[1:18:34] saul was fighting to hold on to what god
[1:18:36] had given him amen david had nothing to
[1:18:39] hold on to he was fighting for god
[1:18:45] and that's why god could do more with
[1:18:47] david than he can do with saul
[1:18:51] i said god make us
[1:18:53] humble
[1:18:55] make us
[1:18:56] more like david
[1:18:59] philemon
[1:19:00] i said philemon right
[1:19:05] chapter 1 verse 1. paul
[1:19:09] a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:19:13] paul was not a prisoner of rome
[1:19:17] paul was in a roman prison under roman
[1:19:20] care
[1:19:21] but he wasn't a prisoner of rome paul
[1:19:23] was a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:19:27] brother brahm says in the message christ
[1:19:29] the mystery of god revealed
[1:19:32] another one the night if you don't get
[1:19:33] it on tape i preached here one night on
[1:19:35] a prisoner of jesus christ paul a
[1:19:36] prisoner when god gets you to be his
[1:19:39] prisoner then you can't do nothing but
[1:19:41] what the spirit says do
[1:19:43] paul with all of his great intellects he
[1:19:46] was taught by gamaliel to be a great
[1:19:48] priest or rabbi someday and he had high
[1:19:50] ambitions he was intellectual great man
[1:19:53] great authority great man in the nation
[1:19:55] but he had to sacrifice every bit of it
[1:19:58] seed to become part of the word to
[1:20:00] express jesus christ
[1:20:02] so god took paul who had it all figured
[1:20:04] out and then paul lost it all
[1:20:08] and went to the backside of the desert
[1:20:10] to relearn unlearn everything that he
[1:20:13] had learned so that he could call it
[1:20:14] dung so god could give him the correct
[1:20:15] revelation
[1:20:17] and paul now come out of that experience
[1:20:20] a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:20:25] brother abraham says in the message the
[1:20:26] comforter
[1:20:29] now we have a sacred trust you know what
[1:20:31] a trust is and we have an inheritance a
[1:20:33] heritage that we inherit as believing
[1:20:35] children
[1:20:36] it's a sacred trust and that
[1:20:38] that sacred trust and our sacred
[1:20:40] heritage is the word of god that's been
[1:20:41] given to us the full word of god the
[1:20:44] word itself is the vitamin the word
[1:20:46] itself god's word
[1:20:48] that's where reason that's the reason
[1:20:50] i'm so dogmatic as i would call it on
[1:20:52] standing on this word no matter what
[1:20:54] anything else says if it's not with the
[1:20:56] word then i don't believe it
[1:20:58] if you don't believe it it's all right
[1:20:59] but to me it takes the word because
[1:21:01] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:21:03] word shall never fail therefore it takes
[1:21:05] the word i live by the word jesus said
[1:21:07] it's written man shall not live by bread
[1:21:09] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:21:11] out of the mouth of god and this is it
[1:21:13] and that is given to us as a heritage
[1:21:15] it's our inheritance the word oh god let
[1:21:18] us think of it in deepness of it
[1:21:20] it's our privilege it's this sacred
[1:21:22] trust that god has put to his church
[1:21:25] god gave his word to his church and that
[1:21:27] sacred heritage is ours it's a gift from
[1:21:30] god not to just compromise on this and
[1:21:32] cut this out and throw this out and add
[1:21:34] this in to suit our own taste but to
[1:21:36] preach the full word the whole gospel we
[1:21:39] are duty bound as christians to take it
[1:21:41] and believe it when we know if our
[1:21:43] hearts condemn us not then we know we
[1:21:45] have favor with god
[1:21:49] the reason i
[1:21:50] i wanted to read that i want to bring it
[1:21:52] to this point
[1:21:54] david honored the word of god
[1:21:58] saul
[1:21:59] honored his own will
[1:22:02] saul
[1:22:04] saul was able
[1:22:08] when
[1:22:09] when the commandment of god didn't fit
[1:22:11] his personal desire
[1:22:14] saul was always willing to take his own
[1:22:17] idea over what samuel the prophet had
[1:22:19] said
[1:22:25] and saul
[1:22:27] was sure anointed of god
[1:22:29] and god called him to be king and god
[1:22:32] placed him in a position of power and
[1:22:34] authority and was it was building in him
[1:22:36] a great kingdom amen but he got so
[1:22:38] exalted in himself that he thought that
[1:22:41] what samuel said was a suggestion
[1:22:45] or at least he treated it as such
[1:22:47] because when samuel said i'll come to
[1:22:48] you this day and wait till i get there
[1:22:50] and sacrifice to the lord and when
[1:22:51] samuel delayed his coming amen saul took
[1:22:55] it upon himself to begin offering
[1:22:57] sacrifices
[1:23:00] and he did this another time when he
[1:23:02] when he told saul you know samuel said
[1:23:05] the lord has sent thee to go after the
[1:23:07] sinners the amalekites kill everything
[1:23:08] they have save nothing amen and samuel
[1:23:11] shows up and he says you know
[1:23:14] saul comes out and says i did what you
[1:23:15] said to do.
[1:23:19] he said what is this bleeding of sheep
[1:23:20] that i hear
[1:23:22] he said oh well you know the people said
[1:23:25] and we were going to save the best to
[1:23:26] make an offering to the lord now that
[1:23:28] sounds religious
[1:23:32] but throw religion out the door
[1:23:34] it looked good it sounded good but it
[1:23:36] wasn't what god said it wasn't what the
[1:23:38] prophet had said and so it got to the
[1:23:41] point he was so lifted up amen he was so
[1:23:44] exalted in himself because of what god
[1:23:46] had done for him somehow maybe he
[1:23:49] thought that he had done these things
[1:23:51] maybe he thought he had lifted himself
[1:23:53] he had won the battles he had fought the
[1:23:55] fight that he was a great man i don't
[1:23:57] know what it was but somehow he was able
[1:24:00] to take a direct commandment from the
[1:24:02] lord through a prophet and he was able
[1:24:04] to
[1:24:05] twist that to his own desire in his own
[1:24:08] interpretation and modify
[1:24:11] what the prophet
[1:24:14] said i said oh it's a dangerous position
[1:24:17] to be in when we think
[1:24:19] because god has anointed us and called
[1:24:21] us and gifted us and placed us that
[1:24:23] we've come to a position where we think
[1:24:25] we can modify what the prophet said
[1:24:30] because if you despise the commandment
[1:24:32] if you despise the word you despise him
[1:24:37] because he is the word
[1:24:41] what has been opened to us this day the
[1:24:42] word
[1:24:45] and to despise that is to despise him
[1:24:50] it doesn't matter how gifted
[1:24:52] we are
[1:24:54] it doesn't matter how much god has done
[1:24:57] from through us in the past
[1:25:00] we can never get to a place where we can
[1:25:02] start
[1:25:03] modifying
[1:25:04] the word of the lord to our own
[1:25:06] understanding
[1:25:09] let's go to ephesians chapter 5.
[1:25:17] ephesians chapter 5 verse 25.
[1:25:28] those husbands love your wives even as
[1:25:30] christ also loved the church and gave
[1:25:31] himself for it
[1:25:33] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:25:34] with the washing of water
[1:25:36] by the word
[1:25:38] that he might present it to himself a
[1:25:40] glorious church not having spot or
[1:25:41] wrinkle or any such thing but that
[1:25:44] should be holy and without blemish
[1:25:49] god has chosen his own church
[1:25:52] is that true god has chosen his own
[1:25:55] church chosen of the lord
[1:25:57] but that church that he's chosen
[1:26:00] needs washing
[1:26:06] that makes sense
[1:26:08] he chose it
[1:26:09] so to be chosen of the lord is a
[1:26:11] wonderful thing but to be chosen of the
[1:26:12] lord is not the end of god's desire for
[1:26:15] us because even though you're chosen of
[1:26:17] god elected and predestinated chosen of
[1:26:20] god what he has chosen he now has to
[1:26:23] wash
[1:26:25] and he is going to wash her by the
[1:26:27] washing of the water of the word
[1:26:32] brother bam says an invisible union your
[1:26:35] first wedding was annulled it was you
[1:26:37] never done it in the first place because
[1:26:39] there's only one thing could do it that
[1:26:41] would be god come down himself and took
[1:26:43] your place in the form of the son of god
[1:26:45] jesus christ and washed you by the water
[1:26:47] of the washing of the water by the word
[1:26:50] the word not the denomination the word
[1:26:52] washed you but if you won't stand in the
[1:26:54] water of the word how you're going to be
[1:26:57] washed you're still as spotted as eve
[1:26:59] was
[1:27:01] so you can't do what saul did
[1:27:04] we got to do what david did and even
[1:27:05] when david failed to keep the
[1:27:07] commandment amen when nathan come to him
[1:27:09] and says you know and begins to speak on
[1:27:11] behalf of the lord and says why have you
[1:27:13] despised the commandment why have you
[1:27:14] despised me david immediately says i
[1:27:17] have sinned against the lord
[1:27:20] why because i did something contrary to
[1:27:23] his word
[1:27:26] and if we won't stand in the water of
[1:27:28] the word how are we going to be washed
[1:27:30] if we won't stand under the water of the
[1:27:32] word that's pouring out in this hour how
[1:27:34] are we going to be cleaned amen amen
[1:27:37] brother baby says you're still as
[1:27:38] spotted as eve is but we've got to come
[1:27:40] to the washing of the water of the word
[1:27:42] that's been revealed in this hour amen
[1:27:44] we've got to stay with that word full
[1:27:47] obedience
[1:27:49] full surrender
[1:27:51] full acknowledgement of the word of god
[1:27:53] and that word begins to wash us it's not
[1:27:56] just the choosing alone but it's the
[1:27:58] choosing and the washing.
[1:28:02] so he chooses us he gives his word to us
[1:28:05] he reveals to us our position as his
[1:28:07] bride he brings us into the fold and
[1:28:10] then he brings us into the message but
[1:28:12] then now this word that's been poured
[1:28:14] out in this day is what god is using to
[1:28:17] wash all the spots of denomination wash
[1:28:20] all wash everything away and we've got
[1:28:22] to stay still under the word and let the
[1:28:25] word have a full effect and if brother
[1:28:27] branham said don't do it don't do it
[1:28:30] if he said kick it out kick it out
[1:28:34] if he said do this do it
[1:28:38] do we understand we've got we've got we
[1:28:41] want to be the bride but we don't want
[1:28:43] to be washed by the water of the word
[1:28:45] the word was sent to wash his bride
[1:28:48] it wasn't said to wash a denomination or
[1:28:50] wash this the word was sent to wash his
[1:28:52] bride and his brides got to stay under
[1:28:54] the washing of the water of the word and
[1:28:56] let it wash everything out
[1:29:04] but the man said
[1:29:06] in the token
[1:29:08] he said the new testament means the new
[1:29:10] covenant blood life
[1:29:12] now life token in us where the old blood
[1:29:15] stood for a simple sign of the chemistry
[1:29:16] the old blood of a lamb that was applied
[1:29:18] it was a simple a sign of the chemistry
[1:29:21] that a lamb had died the holy ghost is
[1:29:23] the life that was in the person of jesus
[1:29:25] christ that's displayed in you and i
[1:29:28] tonight outside of that there is no
[1:29:31] mercy
[1:29:32] only when i see the blood i'll pass over
[1:29:35] you
[1:29:36] now
[1:29:37] brother iran in the token message he's
[1:29:39] saying something very very crucial for
[1:29:41] us
[1:29:42] he's saying in the old testament when
[1:29:44] they took the paschal lamb and the
[1:29:46] passover and then they dipped that blood
[1:29:48] and they applied it the way god told
[1:29:51] them to apply it like they couldn't
[1:29:52] apply it their own way they had to apply
[1:29:54] it you know with the with the the plant
[1:29:58] that he said take and the way he said
[1:30:00] take it and strike it the places he said
[1:30:02] strike it amen it was a complete
[1:30:04] obedience and a reverence to god in the
[1:30:06] applying of the blood
[1:30:09] it wasn't just take the blood and if you
[1:30:11] get it on there you're fine
[1:30:13] that's not what he said
[1:30:14] he's very specific in the way you apply
[1:30:17] the blood strike the lentil strike the
[1:30:18] doorpost take the hyssop take this do
[1:30:21] this
[1:30:22] slay it at this time take the blood in
[1:30:24] this way and take this hiss up and apply
[1:30:26] it here
[1:30:29] and when the death angel came
[1:30:31] he says i will pass over you
[1:30:35] when he came and he saw the right token
[1:30:39] applied the right way
[1:30:42] he would pass on
[1:30:45] and brother branham said in this day he
[1:30:48] said the token is no longer the
[1:30:50] chemistry of the blood
[1:30:52] but it was the life that was in the
[1:30:54] blood the literal life of jesus christ
[1:30:57] and that literal life of jesus christ
[1:30:59] must now come into you but that's not
[1:31:02] enough
[1:31:04] it's got to be applied on the outside of
[1:31:07] the house the way he said to apply the
[1:31:10] life
[1:31:12] and when i see that life
[1:31:15] you know you can say all you want i've
[1:31:18] got it down in my heart but that's not
[1:31:20] what brother bannon preached in the
[1:31:21] token message he didn't preach what you
[1:31:23] had down in your heart he preached what
[1:31:25] you had on display on your house
[1:31:28] and how it was applied matters
[1:31:31] it all matters everything matters amen
[1:31:35] it is and he says when i see that i'll
[1:31:37] pass over you amen not not say well i'm
[1:31:40] eating on the lamb inside it wasn't the
[1:31:42] eating on the lamb inside alone that
[1:31:44] would do it they had to eat on the lamb
[1:31:46] that was the word on the inside of their
[1:31:47] house but there had to be an application
[1:31:50] of the life blood on the outside the way
[1:31:53] he said so that that death angel would
[1:31:55] know there is a lamb on the inside of
[1:31:57] that house
[1:31:58] how did he know because he could see on
[1:32:00] the outside what was being fed upon on
[1:32:02] the inside and that is the exact same
[1:32:04] way in our lives amen god wants this
[1:32:07] life the life the token the life the
[1:32:10] life of jesus christ on the outside of
[1:32:13] the house on display applied the way he
[1:32:16] said to apply the life
[1:32:22] he didn't call for us to be saul and
[1:32:24] says well you know in this situation and
[1:32:26] under this application and i don't think
[1:32:28] god would mind because of this this and
[1:32:30] that
[1:32:34] and when you sometimes you go to talk to
[1:32:35] somebody
[1:32:36] you know the prophet said this and
[1:32:38] they'll be like yes but that was then
[1:32:40] and under those circumstances and now
[1:32:46] that saul
[1:32:48] that's the wrong nature
[1:32:52] well you know the prophet of god said
[1:32:55] this the scripture says yes but i you
[1:32:57] know god knows my heart
[1:33:03] that's a true statement
[1:33:05] but that doesn't make what you're doing
[1:33:06] right
[1:33:09] just by telling the truth doesn't make
[1:33:11] you right
[1:33:13] god knows your heart
[1:33:15] but he told us to apply the token on the
[1:33:17] outside
[1:33:20] and the token was to be
[1:33:21] on display
[1:33:24] not hid in your heart
[1:33:26] on display
[1:33:31] he says again in the token
[1:33:34] when god places his holy spirit in you
[1:33:36] which is god
[1:33:37] and when god places himself within you
[1:33:39] you're as eternal as god is because
[1:33:41] you're a part of him because you become
[1:33:43] a son or daughter of god and you are
[1:33:45] displaying his word
[1:33:50] see we're not supposed to be displaying
[1:33:52] our
[1:33:53] will
[1:33:56] oh this hurts
[1:33:58] this hurts because this is my failure
[1:34:01] we're not supposed to display our will
[1:34:04] but we're disposed to display his word
[1:34:11] he goes hallelujah i feel religious
[1:34:13] that's true god identifies it himself
[1:34:16] you've got eternal life and that's god
[1:34:17] in you and this word is god and that
[1:34:20] word lives and produces itself just
[1:34:23] exactly what god has ordained for this
[1:34:25] age you have it amen the holy ghost the
[1:34:27] holy spirit being displayed the life of
[1:34:30] jesus christ on display amen that's why
[1:34:33] when when when when somebody come to
[1:34:36] david and says this is this is this and
[1:34:38] this is that david didn't make an excuse
[1:34:41] like saul did amen when when samuel the
[1:34:44] prophet come to saul and told him you
[1:34:46] know what's the lowing of sheep why
[1:34:48] haven't you kept the commandment of the
[1:34:49] lord he said i did keep the commandment
[1:34:50] only i did this for this reason
[1:34:53] only i kept back the choices to
[1:34:56] sacrifice to the lord and thanksgiving
[1:34:58] for and delivering but god didn't want
[1:35:00] the choices god didn't want you to do
[1:35:01] that that's your own willfulness on
[1:35:04] display
[1:35:06] but it was religious it was a religious
[1:35:09] reason
[1:35:10] oh i want this to come home to us so
[1:35:12] much all of our religious reasons don't
[1:35:14] mean nothing
[1:35:17] what does god want what is he looking
[1:35:19] for he's looking for somebody that loves
[1:35:21] him so much that they will surrender
[1:35:22] their will their wants their desires
[1:35:24] their thoughts and just take his simple
[1:35:26] word and just believe it and act on it
[1:35:29] if he said do this we'd do it if he said
[1:35:31] don't do this we don't do it amen not to
[1:35:34] reason it out and i did it yes i did it
[1:35:37] i did exactly what he said only i didn't
[1:35:39] do this for this reason but it's okay
[1:35:44] who says it's okay
[1:35:48] i want to be like david
[1:35:51] i want to be like solomon lord i'm just
[1:35:52] a child
[1:35:54] i'm not a smart assault i can't figure
[1:35:56] out that you would want me to keep some
[1:35:58] best back and and and give you an
[1:36:01] offering when the prophet didn't tell me
[1:36:02] to
[1:36:05] you see where saul put himself
[1:36:08] you see how well he thought of himself
[1:36:11] that he could do something above and
[1:36:13] beyond the commandment of the lord
[1:36:16] because somehow maybe he knew what was
[1:36:18] best
[1:36:22] i don't want to get to the place where
[1:36:24] where i'm going to go above and beyond
[1:36:26] amen what the prophet told us because i
[1:36:29] know best
[1:36:36] i just want to be like david
[1:36:39] i want to have a heart
[1:36:41] that wants to honor god
[1:36:44] and the only way i know to honor god is
[1:36:45] to honor his word
[1:36:47] that's the best way i know just to honor
[1:36:49] his word
[1:36:50] just do he says
[1:36:52] isn't
[1:36:53] obedience better than sacrifice well
[1:36:57] samuel tells the saul
[1:36:59] wouldn't obedience have been more
[1:37:00] pleasing to god than your
[1:37:02] fat of rams
[1:37:04] then all your religious
[1:37:06] services that you're giving to god
[1:37:09] wouldn't it be better just to obey him
[1:37:12] just to be simple and to be childlike
[1:37:15] to pull yourself down
[1:37:17] and when somebody you know no doubt
[1:37:19] somebody may have said to saul hey don't
[1:37:21] you think it'd be a good idea let's save
[1:37:22] these and save these and
[1:37:25] but if he could just take solomon's
[1:37:27] attitude if he could have said
[1:37:29] i don't know
[1:37:31] i mean you might be right you may not be
[1:37:33] right i don't know
[1:37:36] all i know is this is what the lord said
[1:37:39] and i'm going to stay with this until
[1:37:40] the lord says something else
[1:37:46] simple
[1:37:49] why is it we have such a hard time being
[1:37:50] simple
[1:37:54] he said
[1:37:57] in the token
[1:38:00] he said when you recognize the token the
[1:38:01] life that it took for the blood to speak
[1:38:04] you say blood speak wait a minute
[1:38:06] brother branham the blood speaks the
[1:38:08] bible says it does
[1:38:10] and the blood speaks remember the
[1:38:11] covenant blood is not recognized without
[1:38:13] the token now the did you catch that
[1:38:16] statement
[1:38:18] oh that can go by so fast
[1:38:21] the covenant blood what is the covenant
[1:38:23] blood the blood of jesus christ that was
[1:38:25] shed for our redemption
[1:38:28] the covenant blood is not recognized
[1:38:31] without the token
[1:38:34] what's the token the word on display in
[1:38:38] our lives the life of jesus christ
[1:38:40] living through us is the token and the
[1:38:42] blood of the covenant the blood of the
[1:38:44] cross of calvary is not recognized
[1:38:47] without the token
[1:38:52] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:38:54] which is the spring into life of the
[1:38:56] eternal seed gene of god which is the
[1:38:57] life of jesus christ springing forth out
[1:38:59] of you and living itself in obedience to
[1:39:02] the word that is the token amen in the
[1:39:04] blood of the covenant is not recognized
[1:39:06] without the token
[1:39:10] so we can't be compromising on the word
[1:39:11] and living any way we want and think
[1:39:14] amen that we've got amen the blood of
[1:39:16] the covenant atoning for us because it's
[1:39:18] not recognized without the token
[1:39:29] the blood speaks remember the covenant
[1:39:30] blood is not recognized without the
[1:39:32] token now the word assures us of the
[1:39:33] promise the token is the sign that the
[1:39:36] purchase has been made for us and god
[1:39:38] has accepted it
[1:39:40] now when you want eternal life you
[1:39:42] receive a token showing that the price
[1:39:44] has been paid it isn't the blood but
[1:39:46] it's the token of the blood it's the
[1:39:49] life itself
[1:39:52] it isn't the blood it's the token of the
[1:39:54] blood which is the life that was in the
[1:39:56] blood which is the literal life of jesus
[1:39:58] christ now and you and i
[1:40:00] does that mean brother chad i'll never
[1:40:02] mess up that doesn't mean that at all
[1:40:04] because i believe brother branham had
[1:40:05] the token life
[1:40:07] and how many mistakes did he tell us
[1:40:09] about from the pulpit
[1:40:11] it's not that it's a life that trumps
[1:40:14] your life and whenever your life rises
[1:40:15] it's the life that brings it back into
[1:40:17] subjection
[1:40:18] it's the life that lives the line up to
[1:40:20] the word and time there's not alignment
[1:40:22] to the word amen it's the very thing
[1:40:24] that brings us into repentance into
[1:40:26] obedience and the line back to the word
[1:40:28] it's the life of jesus christ that's
[1:40:29] constantly pulling us in line with the
[1:40:31] word
[1:40:32] so that our life becomes more word life
[1:40:34] and more word life and more word life
[1:40:37] because it's the life of jesus christ
[1:40:41] he says again in the token the blood is
[1:40:42] not the token now
[1:40:44] the life is the token
[1:40:51] he says again in the token paul tells us
[1:40:53] talking about speaking of blood paul
[1:40:55] tells us that the blood speaks you
[1:40:57] believe the blood speaks in genesis 4 1
[1:41:00] or 4 10 god told cain he said where is
[1:41:02] your brother he said his blood his voice
[1:41:04] the blood of the voice of his blood
[1:41:06] calls out against you
[1:41:09] now we also find in hebrews the 12th
[1:41:10] chapter
[1:41:12] 24th verse in the new testament the
[1:41:14] blood speaks better things the blood is
[1:41:17] speaking then the blood has got a voice
[1:41:20] and the voice of the blood is the word
[1:41:22] hallelujah that's what makes it whether
[1:41:24] it's right or wrong the word is
[1:41:25] identified by the voice of the blood the
[1:41:28] voice of the blood is the holy ghost
[1:41:30] that brings life it is life and it
[1:41:33] brings life to the word and quickens it
[1:41:35] amen amen amen
[1:41:38] you know what the blood has a voice
[1:41:41] today
[1:41:42] and that voice is speaking and where is
[1:41:44] that voice speaking i hope is speaking
[1:41:46] in my life
[1:41:48] i hope that the life that i'm living in
[1:41:50] in
[1:41:51] in obedience to the word of god and
[1:41:53] subjection to the will of god i hope
[1:41:56] that that life is a voice speaking of
[1:41:59] the blood
[1:42:01] that there is a life on display
[1:42:06] bible says in the token again we're not
[1:42:09] come together to talk about the message
[1:42:14] really
[1:42:17] we are come together to get in the
[1:42:19] message
[1:42:22] and the message is christ
[1:42:24] he is the
[1:42:26] word that's right
[1:42:30] we are to get into it get beneath it yes
[1:42:32] sir that's what we're supposed to do
[1:42:34] he was not responsible for any person
[1:42:36] out from under the blood not one no
[1:42:39] matter who he was he was not responsible
[1:42:41] all had to take not only himself but his
[1:42:44] whole family they're only safe when the
[1:42:46] token was displayed
[1:42:48] we cannot feel safe until this token is
[1:42:50] displayed that's right you must come
[1:42:53] under this token god's holy spirit and
[1:42:56] it displays to you jesus christ because
[1:42:58] it comes and lives in you
[1:43:02] that's it
[1:43:05] how can that happen
[1:43:08] if we're refusing his word
[1:43:11] because he is the word
[1:43:13] he's the life of the word
[1:43:16] how if we keep refusing his word
[1:43:20] see the token on display
[1:43:23] will take this word and make it live in
[1:43:25] our lives
[1:43:28] and we find areas in our life where
[1:43:29] we've compromised or let down or disobey
[1:43:33] amen when that comes to our attention we
[1:43:35] can do like david and says i've sinned
[1:43:38] against the lord
[1:43:40] you know what nathan says next
[1:43:42] and your sin is put away from you
[1:43:47] he doesn't say go give me 50 jumping
[1:43:50] jacks and 40 push-ups and
[1:43:54] pay alms to all the poor come back and
[1:43:57] give me your progress report we'll
[1:43:58] decide whether we're taking you back or
[1:44:00] not
[1:44:02] when david was faced with his rejection
[1:44:04] of the word
[1:44:06] when it came to him and he realized he
[1:44:09] had despised the lord he said i have
[1:44:11] sinned against the lord
[1:44:13] very next statement
[1:44:15] and the lord has put your sin away
[1:44:21] i say god forgive me
[1:44:24] forgive me i didn't know i was despising
[1:44:27] you
[1:44:29] i thought i was just wanting to have my
[1:44:30] own way
[1:44:34] but in wanting to have my own way i was
[1:44:36] loving myself more than i was loving god
[1:44:39] amen
[1:44:41] the word is not negotiable
[1:44:44] the word is not flexible
[1:44:46] but god is so humble
[1:44:49] he comes in humility
[1:44:52] that god doesn't force anything in
[1:44:54] humility he'll he will
[1:44:58] subject himself
[1:45:00] to your willfulness
[1:45:03] in his humility he lets you make the
[1:45:06] choice
[1:45:09] and your willfulness
[1:45:11] he he lets you exalt yourself above him
[1:45:15] and he allows it to happen
[1:45:20] and in his mercy
[1:45:23] he'll bring it to our attention out of
[1:45:24] the word
[1:45:27] and in his mercy he'll put in us a heart
[1:45:30] that'll say i sinned against the lord
[1:45:33] i'm sorry god
[1:45:36] and in his mercy and grace will say and
[1:45:38] i've put your sin away
[1:45:41] keep walking my son
[1:45:43] what is this it's the life on display
[1:45:49] everyone goes on to say
[1:45:51] in christ the mystery of god revealed he
[1:45:52] said he has to have the preeminence
[1:45:55] and he is the word
[1:45:57] we talk over and over about he'll have
[1:45:59] the preeminence he wants the preeminence
[1:46:00] he wants the preeminence but what is the
[1:46:02] preeminence it's when the word has
[1:46:05] preeminence in our lives that's him
[1:46:07] having the preeminence
[1:46:10] he says and
[1:46:12] further on the same message so all
[1:46:14] things was made by him
[1:46:16] and since he was made all things made
[1:46:17] for all of us and all things were made
[1:46:19] for by him
[1:46:21] then since that is true we should make
[1:46:23] our identification should be with him we
[1:46:26] should be identified ourselves with him
[1:46:27] because he has identified himself with
[1:46:29] us
[1:46:30] we should be identified with him how by
[1:46:32] living for him not just confession
[1:46:35] so many people take a confession they
[1:46:37] say i say it's got to the place now are
[1:46:39] you a christian i'm methodist well
[1:46:40] that's a long ways from being making
[1:46:42] yourself known as a christian
[1:46:44] well look what the methodist does i'm
[1:46:46] baptist well look what the baptist does
[1:46:47] i'm catholic look what the catholics
[1:46:49] does see but the only way that you can
[1:46:51] actually be a christian is for christ to
[1:46:53] identify himself in you
[1:46:58] then he says how we got some stinger
[1:47:00] there
[1:47:02] i hope everybody on tape gets that too c
[1:47:05] c i'll read it again the the only way
[1:47:07] that you can actually be a christian is
[1:47:09] for christ to identify himself in you
[1:47:13] is that what he's doing
[1:47:15] when we're calling people names
[1:47:18] speaking evil
[1:47:19] about dignitaries
[1:47:24] gossiping and
[1:47:26] having strife and contention and
[1:47:28] arguments and
[1:47:29] speaking evil of his anointing
[1:47:35] is that the life of jesus christ on
[1:47:37] display
[1:47:40] see it's time that we say god forgive me
[1:47:44] i sinned against you
[1:47:46] when i spoke evil of that brother i
[1:47:47] sinned against you
[1:47:49] when i spoke evil
[1:47:52] of that government official
[1:47:58] because who put him there
[1:48:01] like i said before this is not saying i
[1:48:03] disagree or i think that's wrong or that
[1:48:04] man did wrong
[1:48:07] when we begin to call names
[1:48:11] mock
[1:48:12] make fun
[1:48:14] i think it's time to say lord i sinned
[1:48:15] against you
[1:48:17] help me lord not to do it again
[1:48:21] i've resisted your will in my life help
[1:48:23] me not to do it again
[1:48:26] the only way that you can actually be a
[1:48:27] christian is for christ to identify
[1:48:29] himself in you
[1:48:31] you say i'm pentecost pentecostal that
[1:48:34] don't mean a thing it's christ
[1:48:36] identified in you that's when he has
[1:48:37] recognized you say i spoke with tongues
[1:48:40] devils does too i shouted the
[1:48:41] mohammedans buddhists and everything
[1:48:43] shouts the indians scream at the snake
[1:48:44] dance see sure they all do cults cleanse
[1:48:46] and everything else scream holler they
[1:48:48] holler or shout at a baseball game but
[1:48:50] when christ is identified in you
[1:48:52] identifying himself then you are
[1:48:54] christ-like
[1:48:58] which the word christian means to be
[1:49:00] christ like
[1:49:02] what's brother brandon preaching christ
[1:49:04] the mystery of god revealed christ in
[1:49:06] you the hope of glory amen the whole
[1:49:08] unfolding of the seventh seal now in the
[1:49:10] bride now in you and what does it come
[1:49:12] down to it comes down to christ being in
[1:49:14] you and you being like christ
[1:49:19] super simple
[1:49:21] there is your identification all right
[1:49:23] now and since he is our identification
[1:49:24] then we should be identified with him by
[1:49:27] living for him
[1:49:29] let's go to first corinthians 13 and i
[1:49:31] want to read this as the last scripture
[1:49:33] i want to read
[1:49:35] first corinthians 13.
[1:49:43] verse 1
[1:49:48] though i speak with the tongue of men
[1:49:49] and of angels and have not charity i
[1:49:52] become as a sounding brass or a tinkling
[1:49:54] symbol
[1:49:55] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[1:49:57] and understand all mysteries and all
[1:49:59] knowledge and though i have all faith so
[1:50:01] that i could remove mountains and have
[1:50:03] not charity
[1:50:04] i am nothing
[1:50:06] charity is love agape
[1:50:10] love god is love
[1:50:12] god is the word
[1:50:14] christ is the word
[1:50:16] christ is love
[1:50:18] christ is the holy ghost the holy ghost
[1:50:20] is the word the word is love the word is
[1:50:22] god god is love
[1:50:25] you got it
[1:50:27] that means if we don't have first
[1:50:28] corinthians 13 we don't even have what
[1:50:29] we think we have
[1:50:33] we can have miracles and signs and
[1:50:35] wonders
[1:50:36] and not have god
[1:50:38] because god is love
[1:50:40] he said we don't have these verses in
[1:50:42] our lives
[1:50:43] we can have miracles
[1:50:46] we can shout and dance
[1:50:50] but if we don't have this we don't have
[1:50:52] god
[1:50:54] because god is love
[1:50:58] see the whole mystery
[1:51:01] of the seventh seal
[1:51:03] to me comes down to this
[1:51:07] can we be like god on this earth
[1:51:11] yeah i can be like god i cannot no no
[1:51:13] can you be like god on this earth like
[1:51:15] when he came on this earth
[1:51:18] born in a manger
[1:51:20] born to parent a mother out of nazareth
[1:51:24] born in obscurity
[1:51:26] raised in bethlehem
[1:51:28] okay can you can you be mocked and
[1:51:31] scourged and can you be made fun of and
[1:51:33] can you be ridiculed and laughed at and
[1:51:35] can you walk around in weakness and
[1:51:36] humility for 30 years
[1:51:41] remember jesus ministry
[1:51:44] was only three and a half years
[1:51:47] the demonstration of power
[1:51:49] the manifestation of the of the spoken
[1:51:52] word the third pool was only three and a
[1:51:54] half years he had 30 years
[1:51:58] of what subjection
[1:52:00] humility
[1:52:02] learning
[1:52:04] he learned obedience by the things he
[1:52:05] suffered
[1:52:06] he grew and increased
[1:52:09] he meant his stature with god and with
[1:52:10] man
[1:52:12] 30 years of molding character 30 30
[1:52:16] years of god's training 30 years of
[1:52:18] obscurity 30 years as a carpenter's son
[1:52:25] i want to be like god can we be like god
[1:52:28] can we walk in humility and obscurity
[1:52:31] and be nothing
[1:52:34] because jesus had to be nothing in this
[1:52:36] earth
[1:52:38] for 30 years
[1:52:40] and then god would pick him up and do a
[1:52:42] work with him after 30 years that would
[1:52:44] marvel and astound the people but even
[1:52:47] in their marvel in the astounding
[1:52:48] astonishment of his ministry he would be
[1:52:50] rejected he would be called names he
[1:52:53] would be laughed at and he never called
[1:52:55] names back
[1:52:57] he never mocked back
[1:52:59] he was struck and never struck back
[1:53:02] can we be like god
[1:53:06] can we be like christ
[1:53:08] and the answer is yes
[1:53:10] because that's what he's called for in
[1:53:12] this day this is the hour of this
[1:53:14] manifestation of the bride we can do
[1:53:16] this but it's going to have to take a
[1:53:17] death to self it's going to have to say
[1:53:19] lord i have sinned against you when i
[1:53:21] said that i sinned against you when i
[1:53:23] said that about that but i sinned
[1:53:24] against you
[1:53:26] when i spoke evil to this preacher i
[1:53:28] sinned against you
[1:53:31] god let me die to myself
[1:53:34] and live like you
[1:53:38] let's keep reading
[1:53:40] verse 2 again
[1:53:42] though i have a gift of prophecy and
[1:53:44] understand all mysteries and all
[1:53:45] knowledge and though i have all faith so
[1:53:47] that i could remove mountains and have
[1:53:48] not charity i am nothing
[1:53:51] and though i bestow all my goods to feed
[1:53:53] the poor and though i give my body to be
[1:53:54] burned and have not charity it profiteth
[1:53:57] me nothing
[1:53:59] charity suffereth long
[1:54:04] in these next few verses he's getting
[1:54:06] ready to tell you
[1:54:07] another description of the divine nature
[1:54:11] he gives it in peter but here's another
[1:54:14] description of the divine nature
[1:54:17] charity suffers long
[1:54:19] and is kind
[1:54:22] this is love god is love
[1:54:25] can you draw can you connect the dots
[1:54:28] charity suffers long and is kind
[1:54:31] charity envieth not charity wanteth not
[1:54:33] itself it's not absalom
[1:54:37] is not puffed up
[1:54:39] does not behave itself unseemingly
[1:54:42] seeketh not her own
[1:54:44] is not easily provoked
[1:54:46] thinketh no evil
[1:54:49] rejoice is not an iniquity but rejoices
[1:54:52] in the truth
[1:54:53] beareth all things believeth all things
[1:54:56] hopeth all things
[1:54:58] endureth all things
[1:55:00] charity
[1:55:01] never
[1:55:02] faileth
[1:55:07] that
[1:55:09] is my calling
[1:55:11] in life
[1:55:14] and whenever i fail this
[1:55:17] it's always by willfulness
[1:55:20] it's always by self
[1:55:23] and i want to die to myself and say lord
[1:55:26] there's many times i sinned against you
[1:55:28] i thought i was just saying something
[1:55:30] mean about somebody
[1:55:32] i thought i was just
[1:55:34] making a little compromise
[1:55:36] i thought it was just me and i thought
[1:55:38] it was just me and the person i was
[1:55:39] talking with
[1:55:43] but i realized lord i was sinning
[1:55:44] against you
[1:55:46] and i was offending you and i was
[1:55:48] despising you and anytime i let down on
[1:55:50] your word i was despising you
[1:55:53] and anytime i i would touch your
[1:55:55] anointed i was despising you and i want
[1:55:57] to say god forgive me for that
[1:56:00] but let me live this life
[1:56:04] but abraham says in
[1:56:05] christ the mystery of god revealed oh if
[1:56:07] god can get him prisoners like that
[1:56:10] now that's when he can express the
[1:56:11] preeminence you see he's he's got the
[1:56:14] man or the person so that he knows
[1:56:16] nothing but christ
[1:56:19] solomon
[1:56:21] lord
[1:56:22] i'm just a child
[1:56:25] how many today would like to say lord
[1:56:27] i'm just a human being
[1:56:30] i'm a human being with a c gene on the
[1:56:32] inside i don't want to say just a human
[1:56:34] being and the fact that i'm not
[1:56:35] predestined like i don't mean it that
[1:56:36] way but in my human self lord i'm
[1:56:39] completely childlike
[1:56:45] i i i don't know what to do next
[1:56:49] lord the world's changing
[1:56:51] what's going to happen next is going to
[1:56:52] require a response from your bride i
[1:56:54] don't know what the right response is
[1:56:56] lord you've got to show me in your word
[1:56:58] i don't know what to do without your
[1:56:59] word i'm not wise enough i'm not smart
[1:57:02] enough every time i think i'm smart i
[1:57:04] found out that i did something wrong i
[1:57:06] don't know what to do lord would you
[1:57:09] show me your word
[1:57:15] you've got a prisoner he's got to get a
[1:57:16] prisoner
[1:57:17] so he knows nothing but christ
[1:57:20] you get what i mean
[1:57:22] what is christ the word
[1:57:25] first to express himself completely this
[1:57:28] is the threefold purpose
[1:57:30] first to express himself completely god
[1:57:32] in christ
[1:57:34] second to have the preeminence by this
[1:57:36] in his church which is his body the
[1:57:38] bride till he could have the preeminence
[1:57:41] to express himself through them
[1:57:44] what does god want the preeminence for
[1:57:46] so that he can express himself the token
[1:57:49] the life on display to the world that's
[1:57:52] why he's trying to get the preeminence
[1:57:54] and what is the preeminence the
[1:57:56] preeminence is when the proper headship
[1:57:58] comes and the headship is the word and
[1:58:01] when we completely obey the word then
[1:58:04] we've got the right headship and that
[1:58:07] gut that's what gives him preeminence
[1:58:11] there's no way god can have preeminence
[1:58:13] unless we line up with the word
[1:58:15] there's no way he can have premise
[1:58:16] unless we fully obey the word
[1:58:21] in the token
[1:58:24] he says your life is gone and you're
[1:58:25] dead
[1:58:27] and your life is dead
[1:58:28] you're hidden god through christ and
[1:58:30] sealed in there by the holy spirit the
[1:58:32] mind that was in christ is in you and
[1:58:34] christ and the bible and the word is the
[1:58:38] same
[1:58:40] the love of christ i have to love the
[1:58:42] word
[1:58:43] i love the word i love the bible you
[1:58:45] understand there's no wiggle room for us
[1:58:47] to change it by our likes
[1:58:50] christ and the bible and the word is the
[1:58:51] same in the beginning was the word and
[1:58:53] the word was with god and the word was
[1:58:54] god now listen he says next
[1:58:57] then you
[1:58:59] you
[1:59:01] raise your hand he's talking about me
[1:59:02] now
[1:59:04] then you
[1:59:06] and the word
[1:59:07] and god
[1:59:08] and christ
[1:59:10] are the same
[1:59:13] what is that that is his desire for this
[1:59:16] hour that we're living in
[1:59:18] the token on display
[1:59:20] first corinthians 13 on display amen the
[1:59:23] the divine nature of god on display the
[1:59:26] statue of a perfect man on display what
[1:59:29] does he want he wants me to surrender my
[1:59:31] will and die to myself and he wants me
[1:59:33] to come up like solomon amen come up out
[1:59:35] of trash and out of a mess and out of
[1:59:38] brokenness and out of failure amen
[1:59:41] i've come out of failure friends i
[1:59:43] didn't come out of successes brother
[1:59:44] branham came out of what did he come out
[1:59:46] of
[1:59:47] i mean his natural birth what did he
[1:59:49] come out of
[1:59:50] a 16 year old mother
[1:59:54] part cherokee indian
[1:59:56] an alcoholic father 18 year old
[1:59:58] alcoholic father
[1:59:59] who's irish
[2:00:01] living amen in the deep woods in
[2:00:04] kentucky
[2:00:05] in poverty and in a base totally a base
[2:00:08] why did god bring a prophet that way the
[2:00:11] same reason he brought solomon the way
[2:00:13] he brought solomon and why is it we're
[2:00:15] nothing special
[2:00:17] why do we come the way we come and why
[2:00:19] do we keep getting broken in the way
[2:00:20] we're getting broken and why do we keep
[2:00:21] getting humbled in the way we get
[2:00:23] humbled because that's what god that's
[2:00:25] the recipe that's the ingredients that's
[2:00:27] what's necessary for god to come up and
[2:00:30] lift up vessels that he can glorify
[2:00:32] himself in
[2:00:35] he doesn't want us to erect monuments to
[2:00:37] ourselves
[2:00:39] he doesn't want us amen to manipulate
[2:00:41] his word based off our own religious
[2:00:43] ideas
[2:00:45] he he just wants humility and obedience
[2:00:49] and a full surrender so he can have the
[2:00:51] preeminence by his word amen when he has
[2:00:54] the premise by his word then he can
[2:00:55] display himself in this world today
[2:01:01] guess what
[2:01:04] he's predestinated to do it in me now
[2:01:08] what gives me hope and what gives me
[2:01:10] courage is the fact that before the
[2:01:12] foundation of the world he chose me to
[2:01:14] come into this vessel of clay so he
[2:01:16] could take that life on the inside and
[2:01:18] bring this vessel subject and display
[2:01:20] himself to this world and he's raised up
[2:01:23] a bride that will not fail not because
[2:01:27] of her merit but in her humility she
[2:01:30] recognizes his purpose is bigger than my
[2:01:34] plan she said all she has to do is
[2:01:38] surrender
[2:01:40] all he's looking for
[2:01:41] is a childness
[2:01:44] like solomon had
[2:01:46] all he's looking for is a surrender and
[2:01:49] a humility and a need
[2:01:58] brother branham would preach before
[2:02:00] thousands tens of thousands of people
[2:02:03] and he would operate a gift so
[2:02:05] beautifully that thousands upon
[2:02:07] thousands of times you would see the
[2:02:08] miraculous before human eyes
[2:02:15] but in all of that
[2:02:19] he would stand there
[2:02:21] he would call for a line
[2:02:23] people would be standing there
[2:02:26] and he would just start
[2:02:27] stalling and talking
[2:02:31] and in front of tens of thousands of
[2:02:33] people
[2:02:35] who were claiming to him to be a great
[2:02:37] religious figure to be a great man
[2:02:40] and he would just start talking and
[2:02:43] then he would just start saying you know
[2:02:45] friends and god has commissioned me and
[2:02:47] start telling stories and he says now
[2:02:49] you know i'm waiting for something
[2:02:55] this is what god wants
[2:02:57] this is what he wants
[2:02:59] you know i'm waiting for something
[2:03:02] i'm waiting for him
[2:03:05] and he starts him hauling around and
[2:03:08] telling stories and stalling because he
[2:03:10] can do nothing
[2:03:13] he can do nothing in himself
[2:03:15] brother branham wasn't there for the
[2:03:17] show he wasn't there for the accolades
[2:03:19] he wasn't there to build himself a
[2:03:21] monument
[2:03:22] he was there to be a tool in god's hand
[2:03:26] and god would choose the humblest of the
[2:03:28] humblest
[2:03:31] see now you know i'm waiting for
[2:03:33] something
[2:03:35] i'm waiting for him
[2:03:37] then look what he does next
[2:03:39] now if i've said anything wrong
[2:03:45] now if i've said anything wrong god
[2:03:47] forgive me and if i and if i said
[2:03:48] anything i've hurt you if i've done
[2:03:49] anything wrong
[2:03:54] my goodness friends
[2:03:56] can't we see what god is like
[2:03:59] god has given us
[2:04:00] on tape and in a couple videos god has
[2:04:04] given us
[2:04:05] a mature son of god on display
[2:04:09] with the token on display
[2:04:12] so that we can see what it's like
[2:04:14] he didn't work up a crowd
[2:04:17] he didn't start beating up the music he
[2:04:19] didn't start trying to force things to
[2:04:21] happen
[2:04:23] he didn't try to make himself the the
[2:04:26] great gifted one
[2:04:28] he was the one with a great gift but he
[2:04:30] couldn't do anything without god
[2:04:33] and he wasn't ashamed to tell thousands
[2:04:35] of people who were treating him like
[2:04:37] jesus christ he wasn't ashamed to tell
[2:04:39] thousands of them now you know i'm
[2:04:40] waiting for something i i can't do
[2:04:42] anything without him
[2:04:45] and on top of that when the when he
[2:04:47] doesn't feel the presence of the lord
[2:04:48] and doesn't feel that that anointing
[2:04:50] kicking the gear he starts humbling
[2:04:52] himself and repenting before the people
[2:04:55] for anything he might have said or done
[2:04:57] that would be wrong and after he begins
[2:04:59] to humble himself he says he's here
[2:05:03] he's here
[2:05:05] why did god make that video for me
[2:05:08] because i needed to see that that's that
[2:05:11] is the life of jesus christ
[2:05:15] you may have fantastic gifts
[2:05:17] you may you may have you may you know
[2:05:20] have the gift of tongues and
[2:05:21] interpretation or have the gift of
[2:05:23] visions and dreams and interpretation of
[2:05:26] dreams and vision you may have
[2:05:28] supernatural ability and ability with
[2:05:30] healing in your hands you may have all
[2:05:32] kinds of dynamic powerful gifts but if
[2:05:35] you don't have that humility that i saw
[2:05:37] on brother branham i'm not interested
[2:05:42] i
[2:05:44] we're not to be chasers of gifts
[2:05:48] we're to be a lover of the giver
[2:05:51] and if god does anything through us
[2:05:53] through a gift through a ministry gift
[2:05:55] through songs or through the ability to
[2:05:58] write songs through the supernatural
[2:05:59] things that happen through supernatural
[2:06:01] sensitivities
[2:06:02] if god if any of those gifts are
[2:06:04] operating in our life it has nothing to
[2:06:07] do with us it's something that he's
[2:06:09] wanting to do but the best way to get
[2:06:11] that gift to operate is to humble
[2:06:13] ourselves and realize that we are
[2:06:15] nothing
[2:06:16] and we can do nothing without him
[2:06:19] and in humility
[2:06:21] let god
[2:06:22] take a child
[2:06:24] in solomon
[2:06:27] lord i'm but a child
[2:06:29] i don't know how to go out come in
[2:06:31] before these people
[2:06:34] and god would take that child
[2:06:36] and give him a kingdom like it's never
[2:06:38] been before
[2:06:40] and give him wisdom that nobody before
[2:06:43] and nobody after has had sense until
[2:06:46] jesus christ come on the earth
[2:06:51] why because he could be a child
[2:06:54] jesus when they're disputing who's the
[2:06:56] greatest among the kingdom who will be
[2:06:58] number one who'll be number two who'll
[2:06:59] be on the right hand and the left hand
[2:07:01] jesus grabs a little child and he brings
[2:07:03] a little child into their midst and says
[2:07:05] unless you humble yourself and become
[2:07:07] like this
[2:07:08] you'll not even see the kingdom
[2:07:13] the way up is down
[2:07:16] you could take solomon
[2:07:18] and build a kingdom
[2:07:19] that'll be a type of jesus christ
[2:07:21] millennial reign
[2:07:23] why because he could start like a child
[2:07:25] and he could come from humble origins
[2:07:28] absalom god could have never used
[2:07:30] absalom
[2:07:33] i want god to use me
[2:07:36] not for
[2:07:38] me realize how many times we've wanted
[2:07:41] god to use us for us
[2:07:47] how many times have we wanted god to do
[2:07:49] the supernatural so that we can get
[2:07:52] credit so that our church will be right
[2:07:55] so that we'll be vindicated
[2:08:01] god help us
[2:08:03] i want to serve god for god not for me
[2:08:07] and i want god to use me for him not for
[2:08:09] me
[2:08:11] and i want god to be glorified not me
[2:08:17] if he's going to have a bride
[2:08:19] in this end time and he is
[2:08:21] if he's going to have a bride that he's
[2:08:23] going to do supernatural things through
[2:08:25] it's going to be that kind of bride
[2:08:30] i say god the way up is down
[2:08:32] lord i can do nothing without you
[2:08:35] i'm just a child
[2:08:37] and i don't want to be above that
[2:08:40] i
[2:08:41] i'm just a child but i'm not asking you
[2:08:42] make me not a child i'm just asking use
[2:08:44] me like a child
[2:08:46] use me as i am lord i'm not asking you
[2:08:48] to get make me wise i'm not asking you
[2:08:50] to make me rich i'm not asking for
[2:08:51] anything i'm just telling you what i am
[2:08:53] i'm just a child and i don't know how to
[2:08:54] do that would you please help me
[2:08:57] if we could stay there friends we'll see
[2:08:59] mighty things
[2:09:01] we'll see mighty things because god
[2:09:03] wants to show himself mighty this is the
[2:09:06] hour for his life to be on display
[2:09:10] this is the this is the time
[2:09:12] when he's going to show
[2:09:14] himself
[2:09:15] in bride form
[2:09:18] but the way up is down
[2:09:20] it's not what we think
[2:09:22] it's what he wants to do through us
[2:09:25] let's all stand
[2:09:27] musicians and like if you can come
[2:09:34] i just want to make a statement to you
[2:09:36] that the prophet made over and over and
[2:09:37] over again
[2:09:42] if i could just say it this way
[2:09:46] a greater than solomon is here
[2:09:51] do you believe that
[2:09:53] a greater than solomon is here
[2:09:58] he was there when brother branham
[2:10:00] announced it he's here this morning a
[2:10:02] greater than solomon is here
[2:10:06] solomon in his kingdom was the greatest
[2:10:07] solomon in his wealth was the greatest
[2:10:09] solomon in his wisdom was grace and
[2:10:11] there's a greater than solomon here
[2:10:14] but what he's looking for he's looking
[2:10:16] for that nature
[2:10:19] where paul could say i count it all but
[2:10:21] dung
[2:10:22] where moses could leave
[2:10:24] all the all the riches of egypt and
[2:10:27] forsake it for the reproach of christ
[2:10:30] for those that can be born humble and
[2:10:32] below and be nothing and recognize
[2:10:34] through nothing and stand before their
[2:10:36] brothers and sisters and say i don't
[2:10:38] have answers i can't tell you i don't
[2:10:40] know
[2:10:43] who can sit in the corner of a cave
[2:10:46] after having a reputation of being a
[2:10:48] giant slayer
[2:10:50] and pluck a stringed instrument
[2:10:52] and weep to the lord
[2:10:54] and say lord save me i cannot save
[2:10:56] myself
[2:10:58] deliver me o lord because i have no way
[2:11:00] to deliver myself
[2:11:02] that's what god loves
[2:11:04] that's the kind of warrior he's looking
[2:11:06] for that's the kind of bride he wants to
[2:11:08] have
[2:11:13] this is what we want
[2:11:15] this is what we want
[2:11:18] i just want to be whatever he wants me
[2:11:20] to be
[2:11:22] let's bow our heads and pray
[2:11:26] lord jesus we thank you father for your
[2:11:29] word
[2:11:32] god we recognize lord through your word
[2:11:35] the nature that you have used
[2:11:38] all through your bible lord the men that
[2:11:40] you've chosen
[2:11:43] lord they've been men that were
[2:11:45] rejected
[2:11:47] outcasts
[2:11:49] trodden down
[2:11:51] marginalized
[2:11:53] but god that's what you wanted
[2:11:56] they were men who had to be abased
[2:11:59] who had to unlearn things that they had
[2:12:01] learned wrong
[2:12:03] they had the forsake fineries and riches
[2:12:06] [Music]
[2:12:08] lord so that you could use them
[2:12:12] men who had to die to their own wills
[2:12:14] and their own selfishness
[2:12:17] god you're so good to us that you come
[2:12:19] in our day in our generation when we can
[2:12:21] have audio recordings in video
[2:12:24] and you brought another one of those men
[2:12:26] up lord
[2:12:28] out of humility
[2:12:30] out of poverty
[2:12:32] but with no connections
[2:12:35] nor with no resources
[2:12:38] you grabbed a man and our brother
[2:12:39] brother branham lord
[2:12:41] and you raised him up before us to show
[2:12:43] what it's like to be a son of god
[2:12:46] to have the token on display to have
[2:12:48] christ live his life through a human
[2:12:50] vessel
[2:12:52] and god you showed it to us so that we
[2:12:54] wouldn't be mistaken lord so that we can
[2:12:56] identify the counterfeit
[2:12:58] the counterfeit comes in eric can see in
[2:13:00] pride
[2:13:02] it may be gifted
[2:13:04] it may have gifts lord that far outshine
[2:13:06] any gift we may have
[2:13:08] but lord it's a counterfeit if it
[2:13:10] doesn't have that life
[2:13:13] god i pray that you would make me match
[2:13:17] that life lord
[2:13:19] that there would be no counterfeit on
[2:13:21] display here but there would be a
[2:13:22] genuine dollar bill
[2:13:25] lord that you would mold me
[2:13:28] in your great meant lord
[2:13:30] you would make me what you want me to be
[2:13:34] lord we as your children we want to say
[2:13:36] we're just children lord we're just but
[2:13:37] children
[2:13:39] we don't know lord
[2:13:41] we don't know which way the world will
[2:13:42] turn
[2:13:43] we don't know what direction things will
[2:13:45] go and we don't know what we'll do about
[2:13:46] it when we get there
[2:13:49] but god i know one thing you put a
[2:13:51] desire in my heart for you
[2:13:53] you put a love in there that didn't come
[2:13:55] from my human birth
[2:13:57] you put a seed in there and you've
[2:13:58] brought it to life
[2:14:00] for your purpose and i want to surrender
[2:14:02] to that
[2:14:04] god show us in your word
[2:14:06] keep revealing your word to us so that
[2:14:08] we might take your word
[2:14:10] above our thinking that we might take
[2:14:12] your word above our will that we might
[2:14:13] take your word and surrender to that
[2:14:15] word so you can have preeminence because
[2:14:18] that word is our headship
[2:14:21] and gone by our simple humble submission
[2:14:25] to that word
[2:14:27] we pray god that you would lift this
[2:14:29] vessel up for your glory
[2:14:31] and use it to magnify your name
[2:14:34] and to show your great purpose in this
[2:14:36] age
[2:14:38] god forgive us for offending you
[2:14:41] forgive us for despising you in our
[2:14:43] actions and in our words
[2:14:46] make us true oh god
[2:14:48] make us right
[2:14:50] lord burn out the dross
[2:14:52] and cleanse our heart let your love
[2:14:54] abound in us
[2:14:56] god i love you
[2:14:58] i thank you god for your word
[2:15:00] i thank you that you love us enough to
[2:15:02] expose us
[2:15:04] that we might forsake our sins and
[2:15:06] forsake ourselves and follow after you
[2:15:09] oh you're precious to us
[2:15:12] we love you lord in jesus christ's name
[2:15:14] we pray
[2:15:15] amen
[2:15:18] you know the word of god says the bride
[2:15:21] has made herself ready
[2:15:24] how did she make herself ready
[2:15:27] she took this word
[2:15:29] and she dressed herself in it
[2:15:32] what is it addressing the word
[2:15:33] it's the life of christ on display
[2:15:37] it's the presentation to the world of
[2:15:39] the word
[2:15:41] alive
[2:15:42] not the word in here
[2:15:44] the word living out here
[2:15:48] amen let's sing the song

[2:18:40] i love you all
[2:18:42] thankful that we get to serve the lord
[2:18:44] together
[2:18:45] thank for what he's doing in our lives
[2:18:48] i say as we leave
[2:18:51] don't be ashamed
[2:18:54] if it looks like
[2:18:55] the bride begins to get weaker
[2:18:59] that's perfect
[2:19:00] [Music]
[2:19:04] the crowning of brother branham's
[2:19:05] ministry is when ten thousand of his
[2:19:07] friends left him
[2:19:09] and the big meetings had died down
[2:19:12] the accolades and the articles and the
[2:19:14] paper and and all of the fanfare and
[2:19:17] hype had diminished
[2:19:20] and they the full gospel businessman was
[2:19:22] trying to pull away from him they
[2:19:24] wouldn't even had him anymore if it
[2:19:26] hadn't been for brother carl williams
[2:19:30] his friends were pulling away and
[2:19:32] thinking that he had went off and now he
[2:19:34] was washed up and his ministry was over
[2:19:36] and he begins to talk all about this
[2:19:40] and it was god bringing the crowning of
[2:19:43] the ministry in the revelation of the
[2:19:44] seventh seal
[2:19:47] paul looked like he was washed up
[2:19:50] he was sick and the lord wouldn't heal
[2:19:52] him he was in prison and the lord
[2:19:54] wouldn't deliver him
[2:19:56] gave demas the right to leave him
[2:19:58] because of the weakness that paul had
[2:20:00] but in his weakness we have a bible
[2:20:03] [Music]
[2:20:05] and what some thought was the
[2:20:06] diminishing of his ministry
[2:20:10] was the bible that we carry with us
[2:20:14] it looked like david was washed up when
[2:20:17] he left jerusalem a defeated king
[2:20:20] [Music]
[2:20:23] say don't
[2:20:25] don't try to look good anymore
[2:20:29] don't worry about what other people
[2:20:30] think and what other people say
[2:20:33] don't worry about trying to present a
[2:20:34] certain image or being vindicated or
[2:20:36] justified
[2:20:39] don't worry about trying to say you know
[2:20:41] we have this many healings proving that
[2:20:43] we're right or we have this we've had
[2:20:45] this america we've had that don't worry
[2:20:46] about any of that don't try to prove
[2:20:48] anything
[2:20:51] just watch
[2:20:52] watch what god will do
[2:20:55] watch him bring things
[2:20:56] humble lower
[2:20:59] smaller
[2:21:01] broken
[2:21:02] just watch him do it
[2:21:04] and don't be surprised
[2:21:07] if if it looks like things are
[2:21:10] diminishing in the bride
[2:21:12] she's getting weaker
[2:21:14] [Music]
[2:21:16] she's getting pushed around
[2:21:18] by the government
[2:21:19] [Music]
[2:21:21] she's being backed into a corner and
[2:21:23] marginalized and losing privileges and
[2:21:26] losing this and god's letting it all
[2:21:28] happen don't get nervous don't get one
[2:21:31] drop nervous
[2:21:34] just relax
[2:21:37] do you know why david
[2:21:39] ran away from jerusalem
[2:21:43] it wasn't because he was scared of
[2:21:44] absalom in his army
[2:21:47] he left because he knew absalom was
[2:21:49] coming and that absalom would smite the
[2:21:52] inhabitants of jerusalem with the edge
[2:21:54] of the sword and so in order to spare
[2:21:56] the people david humbled himself and
[2:21:58] left his throne and left his kingdom
[2:22:03] david wouldn't stand and fight because
[2:22:06] david knew if this is god's will and god
[2:22:08] gave it to me god will keep it for me i
[2:22:11] can walk away for the sake of everybody
[2:22:13] else i can leave
[2:22:15] [Music]
