[15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together this
[15:55] evening.
[15:57] there. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful,
[15:59] Father, that you have gathered us
[16:01] together once again. And we are here,
[16:04] Lord. We're here at your bidding. We're
[16:06] here, Lord, in our obedience to your
[16:08] word. We're here because of the love
[16:10] that's in our heart. Because your grace
[16:12] is in our life that's extended to us,
[16:14] Lord, and brought us, Lord, to this
[16:17] place once again. And God, we've sung of
[16:21] your glory and your majesty, and our
[16:23] gratitude is great in our hearts for
[16:25] you, Lord. And now we've come to hear
[16:27] your word. And we anticipate hearing it.
[16:30] Lord, we want to receive more from you
[16:32] as you unveil yourself to us, as you
[16:34] instruct us yourself. May Lord, your
[16:37] word be meat to us, Lord. May it sustain
[16:40] us and strengthen us and give us life.
[16:42] And God, may we yield to it and
[16:44] surrender, Lord, and open ourselves to
[16:46] you that you may have full access to us.
[16:49] Then might you use us that you could use
[16:51] us for your glory and the finishing of
[16:53] your purpose on this earth. Pray you
[16:56] take this vessel of mine under your
[16:57] control now, Lord, by the anointing of
[17:00] your Holy Spirit. May you speak words of
[17:02] life. May you take control, Lord, and
[17:04] guard me against anything that be wrong,
[17:06] but use this lips for things that are
[17:08] right and true, Lord, and helpful, Lord,
[17:11] and encouraging and strengthening and
[17:14] correcting. Whatever it is you want to
[17:15] do, we give you the place to do it,
[17:17] Lord. We pray you would take preeminence
[17:19] among us now. For we love you, Lord, and
[17:21] we're thankful for this opportunity. We
[17:24] ask that you would bless us now as we
[17:25] look into your word. In Jesus Christ's
[17:28] name we pray. Amen.
[17:31] Amen. God bless you all. Amen. As you
[17:34] know and you heard and you received, I'm
[17:36] sure the email and the text that uh
[17:38] Sunday afternoon our sister Nancy
[17:40] Marorrow passed away. And uh and we're
[17:43] very thankful for Sister Nancy. Amen.
[17:46] She had lived 85 years upon this earth.
[17:49] She had been healthy and strong all the
[17:50] way up till the last two years. and her
[17:52] body just began to wear out and it was
[17:54] just time for her to go home and we're
[17:57] so thankful that she passed peacefully
[17:59] without struggle just in her sleep at
[18:02] home with her family around. So, we're
[18:04] thankful for that. And so, just want to
[18:06] let you know that there'll be a memorial
[18:07] service here this Saturday at 11:30 a.m.
[18:11] here in the sanctuary. So, if you're
[18:13] able to join us for that, that'll be
[18:14] nice as we remember the life of our
[18:16] sister. Uh also, there'll be a
[18:18] fellowship dinner to follow over in the
[18:19] fellowship hall. Uh wanted to also let
[18:22] you know that the sanctuary will still
[18:24] be open for prayer time Saturday as well
[18:27] uh from 3 to 10. So we'll keep that as
[18:29] regular. Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles
[18:32] now to Genesis chapter 22. Let's go
[18:35] there together.
[18:39] Just want to uh uh greet Sister Joanne,
[18:42] Sister Rebecca's mom. God bless you,
[18:44] Sister Joanne. It's good to have you
[18:45] here from Edmonton. I'm glad she gets to
[18:47] stay. She's going to be here for a few
[18:49] more weeks and it's always nice to have
[18:50] her come and visit with us. She's
[18:52] certainly not a stranger to us. Amen.
[18:55] So, we we're glad to borrow her from
[18:57] Edmonton for a little while. So,
[18:59] hopefully it's a little warmer here than
[19:00] it is there, so you can at least enjoy
[19:02] that. Amen. Praise God. Genesis 22
[19:06] verse1
[19:09] it says and it came to pass after these
[19:11] things that God did tempt Abraham and
[19:14] said unto him Abraham and he said behold
[19:17] here I am and he said take now thy son
[19:20] thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest
[19:22] and get thee in the land of Mariah and
[19:24] offer him there for a burnt offering
[19:26] upon one of the mountains which I will
[19:28] tell thee of. Amen. May the Lord bless
[19:31] you as you have your seats. May the Lord
[19:33] bless us as we look into his word this
[19:35] morning. If we could bring up the
[19:36] PowerPoint, please. I want to take for a
[19:39] subject this afternoon. I say this
[19:40] morning, but I mean this afternoon. Uh I
[19:43] want to take for a subject reverential
[19:45] trust. So hopefully that comes up there,
[19:48] reverential trust. And you'll see where
[19:50] I get this title in just a moment. Uh
[19:52] but when I when I look at this uh
[19:55] scripture, this is the scripture that we
[19:56] just read. It came to pass after these
[19:58] things that God did tempt Abraham. This
[20:01] is Genesis 22. And we're going to spend
[20:03] some time in Genesis 22. We'll start
[20:05] there, take a couple scriptures, and
[20:07] then we're going to back up and then
[20:08] we'll we'll come back to it after a
[20:10] little while. But when he says he did
[20:12] tempt him, this word means to test, to
[20:15] try, to prove, to tempt, to assay, to
[20:18] put to the proof test. And brother
[20:20] Brandham said God loves to test his
[20:22] children. He loves to prove his
[20:24] children. Amen. Because because God
[20:26] knows what's on the inside and he loves
[20:28] to put it to the test. Amen. to
[20:31] demonstrate what's on the inside. And so
[20:33] God did tempt Abraham. And how did he
[20:36] tempt him? By asking him to offer Isaac.
[20:40] And then uh in Genesis 18, we have this
[20:43] statement about Abraham that is to me
[20:45] very profound. In in 18:18 he said,
[20:48] "Seeing that Abraham shall surely become
[20:50] a great and mighty nation, and all the
[20:52] nations of the earth shall be blessed in
[20:54] him, for I know him that he will command
[20:57] his children and his household after
[20:58] him, and they shall keep the way of the
[21:00] Lord to do justice and judgment, that
[21:03] the Lord may bring upon Abraham that
[21:05] which he hath spoken of him." God knew
[21:08] what Abraham was. God knew about
[21:11] Abraham. God understood Abraham. God
[21:13] knew it was in Abraham. And he knew he
[21:16] could put his trust in Abraham. God knew
[21:18] who he called.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; He knew who he called before he called
[21:21] him. Amen. And and God was working with
[21:23] Abraham through his life to develop
[21:25] Abraham and to bring out of him certain
[21:27] virtues and characteristics. Amen. But
[21:29] he says, "For I know him that he will
[21:32] command his children and his household
[21:33] after him." God knew he would. It wasn't
[21:36] a question. God knew he will. And he's
[21:38] speaking of the future. He will command
[21:40] his children in his household after him
[21:41] to do what? and they shall keep the way
[21:44] of the Lord to do justice and judgment.
[21:47] Amen. That the Lord may bring upon
[21:50] Abraham that which he has spoken of him.
[21:52] So God, it's an amazing statement that
[21:55] he makes. God says, I know that he'll do
[21:57] this. I know he'll command his children
[21:58] in his household. I know that he'll lead
[22:01] them in the way of the Lord to do
[22:03] justice and judgment that the Lord may
[22:05] bring upon Abraham that which he hath
[22:07] spoken of him. God chose him because
[22:10] this was who Abraham was. This was his
[22:12] nature. This was inside of Abraham. But
[22:14] God needed Abraham to display this so
[22:17] that God could fulfill all that he had
[22:19] spoken of Abraham. So God knew it was
[22:20] Abra in Abraham. But God needed it to be
[22:23] expressed in Abraham. So that God could
[22:25] keep his word in Abraham.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; So God had to develop these things in
[22:30] Abraham and draw them out of Abraham
[22:32] because God wanted to fulfill his
[22:34] promise in Abraham. He already knew that
[22:36] Abraham would do it. He knew it was in
[22:37] Abraham, but he needed Abraham to do it
[22:39] so that he could confirm his word to
[22:41] Abraham.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And guess what? We're seed of
[22:44] Abraham.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; So when we look at Abraham's life, we
[22:47] can start to see the way God is dealing
[22:48] with us. He already knows what we're
[22:51] going to do. He's ordained us into good
[22:52] works, which he has ordained before the
[22:54] before the foundation of the world. He
[22:55] before ordained that we should walk in
[22:57] them. So God already knows what we're
[22:59] going to do. He knows what's inside of
[23:00] us, what's in the seed. Amen. But God
[23:03] needs those characteristics to come on
[23:05] display so that he can perform his word
[23:07] that is promised to us. He needs us to
[23:09] live this life.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; But he knows we will. But he needs us to
[23:13] so that he can.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; So God is working with us. Amen. Because
[23:19] he knows the potential that lays in us
[23:21] and all the circumstances on our life
[23:23] are God working with us to bring that
[23:25] out so that he can fulfill his word.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Thank God. Amen. Life is not just
[23:31] treasury. Life is not just going through
[23:33] the motions. Not life is not just
[23:34] getting up and going to work and doing
[23:35] that and and I do that. That's part of
[23:38] my life. And then I serve God. That's
[23:39] another part of my life. No. All of life
[23:41] is God working with us. Amen. To draw
[23:44] these things out of us.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's nothing mundane. There's
[23:48] nothing routine. There's nothing without
[23:50] significance.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He says this of David in
[23:55] Acts 13. And he says, "And when he had
[23:57] removed him, he raised up unto them
[23:59] David to be their king, to whom also he
[24:01] gave testimony and said, I have found
[24:03] David, the son of Jesse, a man after
[24:05] mine own heart, which shall fulfill all
[24:08] my will." We talked about this before.
[24:10] What made David a man after God's own
[24:12] heart? Because God knew he shall fulfill
[24:14] my will. And we already talked about
[24:16] this. David wasn't a perfect man and he
[24:18] didn't do everything right. Neither was
[24:19] Abraham a perfect man and did everything
[24:21] right. But God knew that he would do
[24:23] this right. And God knew that David was
[24:25] a man after his own heart that would do
[24:27] all of his will.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Even if he would do things that were
[24:30] wrong, he was correctable. He would come
[24:32] to line up with the word again. And God
[24:34] knew that he shall fulfill all my will.
[24:36] And that was a man after God's own
[24:38] heart, one that should fulfill his will.
[24:41] And his will is his
[24:43] &gt;&gt; word.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; He knew David would keep the word in
[24:46] line to the word.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then when we go to Genesis 22:11
[24:51] and 12, we had just read 22:1 and2 when
[24:54] God did tempt Abraham. And now he says
[24:58] in 11, and the angel of the Lord called
[25:00] unto him out of heaven and said,
[25:02] Abraham, Abraham, and he said, here am
[25:04] I. And he said, lay not lay not thine
[25:08] hand upon the lad, neither do thou
[25:10] anything unto him. For now I know that
[25:13] thou fearthst God, seeing thou hast not
[25:16] withheld thy son, thine only son from
[25:18] me. Amen. God already knew in Genesis
[25:21] 18, he's going to he's going to command
[25:23] his household and command his children,
[25:25] amen, to keep them in the way of the
[25:26] Lord, to do justice and judgment. He
[25:28] already knew what was in Abraham. And
[25:30] and God already knew that Abraham fears
[25:33] him. When he came to this place of
[25:34] offering Isaac, there was something
[25:37] about it that so moved God that God
[25:39] said, "For now I know that thou fearest
[25:41] God, seeing that thou has not withheld
[25:44] thy son, thine only son from me." And I
[25:46] want to look at this word fear. When we
[25:49] we've talked about it, and I think
[25:50] you've heard brother Ram talk about it.
[25:52] We know the fear of the Lord, the fear
[25:54] of God. Thou fearest God. Amen. I want
[25:56] to look at this term for a minute. This
[25:59] word here it's used is is this word uh
[26:03] uh yre. It means fearing, reverent, and
[26:06] afraid. And it can mean all of these
[26:09] things. And in the context that it's
[26:10] used, it can it can it can hold uh
[26:13] different meaning. So the one that I'm
[26:16] looking at right now is reverent. I want
[26:19] to look at this word reverent. It's not
[26:22] necessarily to be afraid. Although this
[26:24] word means to be afraid. It can be used
[26:27] in a way that you're terrorized by
[26:29] something. You're fearful like in in
[26:31] great terror and fear, but it also can
[26:34] mean you're aed by something and
[26:35] mesmerized by it and give reverence to
[26:37] it. It's the same word. It can mean both
[26:40] things depending on how it's used. The
[26:43] the Hebrew word, Amen. When I looked it
[26:45] up, began to study it, it's really
[26:46] interesting. The Hebrew word is based
[26:50] off an emotional response. It's it's a
[26:53] Hebrew word is an emotional response
[26:55] that has the core or root to to to to to
[26:59] have your inward spilling out. Something
[27:01] like that. It means this is a reaction
[27:04] to something. You have an inside
[27:06] reaction. You're moved on the inside.
[27:08] And that can be fear as in terror, but
[27:11] can also be reverential awe and
[27:13] amazement.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; It can be both. Amen. So, it depends on
[27:18] on the way that the word is used. But
[27:20] here we're looking at the word reverend.
[27:22] You see here where it says that it comes
[27:25] from 30 3372.
[27:28] You see this is 3373. This is just a
[27:31] number reference in the in the Strong's
[27:33] concordance. So if we go to the word
[27:35] 3372,
[27:36] it's this word. It's the the same word
[27:38] in a different tense. Yay. to fear, to
[27:42] revere, to be afraid, to fear, be
[27:45] afraid, to stand in awe, be aed by, to
[27:49] reverence, to honor, to respect. Amen.
[27:52] So when he feared God, it wasn't that he
[27:55] was afraid of God's punishment. He was
[27:57] afraid of God's terror. Amen. But it was
[28:00] this use of the word to stand in awe of,
[28:03] to be awed, to reverence, to honor, to
[28:05] respect. It's a high degree of reverence
[28:08] and respect because of awe and amazement
[28:11] and the worthiness of God.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a word like it that's used
[28:16] in the Greek and we find its use in the
[28:18] New Testament. And I'm going to share
[28:20] that with you so we can get an
[28:21] understanding of its use. In 1 Peter 3,
[28:24] it says, ' Likewise, you wives, be in
[28:26] subjection to your own husbands, that if
[28:28] any obey not the word, they also may
[28:30] without the word be won by the
[28:32] conversation of the wives, while they
[28:34] behold your chase conversation coupled
[28:36] with fear.
[28:38] That word fear is not women who are in
[28:40] terror of abuse by their husbands,
[28:43] &gt;&gt; but women who reverence and respect and
[28:46] honor their husbands, and that will be a
[28:48] a a means by which their husbands can be
[28:51] converted. Yeah.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; All right. So, this is the same. This is
[28:54] a Greek word, but it's it's the it's the
[28:56] same meaning. It means the same thing.
[28:58] It's used in very much the same way.
[29:00] Look how it's used here in Job. Job 1:8.
[29:04] And the Lord said unto Satan, "Hast thou
[29:06] considered my servant Job, that there is
[29:08] none like him in the earth? A perfect
[29:10] man?" That means complete or fully
[29:12] mature. An upright man means that one's
[29:15] correct. One that fearth God, same word
[29:18] used the same way. and escueth evil.
[29:21] That means one who turns away from evil
[29:23] or rejects evil. Amen. So this is this
[29:26] is uh uh this is God speaking of Job.
[29:30] This is this is his his description of
[29:33] Job. Amen. Job is a perfect man, an
[29:35] upright one. Man of fear of God. He
[29:37] wasn't cowering in the corner waiting
[29:39] for God to throw stones at him. He had a
[29:40] great deal of reverence and respect for
[29:42] God.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; That's this fear of God. He was awed by
[29:45] God and he reverenced the amazing God.
[29:48] Amen. And so that's that's the way the
[29:50] word is used. Amen. There is a there's a
[29:54] definition in the the Skullfield Bible.
[29:57] I read a Scullfield Bible. And when I
[29:59] looked at this word, it referenced me
[30:01] over to Psalms 19:9. So I'm just going
[30:03] to turn over there real quick and read
[30:05] that to you and read the note that's
[30:06] there. Psalms 19:9.
[30:11] It says, "The fear of the Lord is
[30:14] clean." The fear of the Lord is clean,
[30:16] enduring forever. the judgments of the
[30:18] Lord are true and righteous altogether.
[30:20] But then Scoffield uh puts a note down
[30:23] here and he puts in he says the fear of
[30:26] the of the Lord a phrase of the Old
[30:28] Testament means piety meaning
[30:31] reverential trust with hatred of evil.
[30:34] That's where I got the title reverential
[30:36] trust. When I looked at that, it was
[30:38] amazing to me. It's a great deal of
[30:40] reverence, but it's a reverence in a
[30:42] perfect God. It's a reverence in an
[30:44] amazing God. It's a reverence that
[30:45] brings trust in God.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; And I think that's what Abraham was able
[30:50] to manifest. Amen. There when he obeyed
[30:53] the Lord, he had a trust and a
[30:55] confidence in this perfect God and this
[30:57] amazing God. And he had such reverence
[30:59] and honor that he could trust him. Amen.
[31:01] The same thing in a in a woman for her
[31:03] husband can have the same kind of
[31:05] reverence. So I took for a title tonight
[31:08] the reverential trust. Amen.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we want to look at that as the
[31:13] fear of the Lord. Uh I want to look at
[31:16] this scripture as we begin and then I
[31:18] I'll start to explain. Hebrews chapter 6
[31:21] verse 13. It says, "For when God made a
[31:23] promise to Abraham because he could
[31:25] swear by no greater, he swore by
[31:28] himself."
[31:29] &gt;&gt; That's how sure this promise is. God
[31:31] swore by himself,
[31:33] &gt;&gt; saying, "Surely blessing I will bless
[31:35] thee, and multiplying I will multiply
[31:37] thee." And so after he had patiently
[31:39] endured, he obtained the promise. For
[31:42] men verilely swear by the greater and an
[31:44] oath for confirmation is to them an end
[31:46] of all strife. Wherein God willing more
[31:49] abundantly to show unto the heirs of
[31:51] promise the immutil immut immutability
[31:55] of his counsel confirmed it by an oath
[31:58] that by two immutable things in which it
[32:00] was impossible for God to lie, we might
[32:03] have a strong consolation who have fled
[32:06] for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
[32:08] before us. Amen. This is a wordy.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Does anybody agree?
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Okay. I hope it wasn't just me. I hope
[32:16] you're not all like perfectly sens
[32:18] sensible to me, Chad. What's wrong with
[32:19] you?
[32:21] But I want to break it down just a
[32:23] little bit. He says, "Men, when they
[32:25] make an oath, what they they they swear
[32:27] by the greater, right? And but God could
[32:30] swear and by none greater or nothing
[32:32] else, so he swore by himself." Amen. So
[32:34] he could cons he he secured the promise
[32:37] by his own reputation. Yeah.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:42] And so uh uh he promised this to Abraham
[32:46] that surely blessing I will bless thee
[32:49] and multiplying I will multiply thee.
[32:51] And he secured this promise by his own
[32:53] nature by his own self, his own person.
[32:56] And and after Abraham had patiently and
[32:58] dirty obtained the promise for men
[33:00] verilely swear by the greater and an
[33:02] oath for confirmation is to them an end
[33:05] of strife. That means an end of
[33:07] striving, an end of trying, an end of
[33:09] pressing. There's an oath of
[33:11] confirmation. God made the promise and
[33:13] he based it upon himself. And he said,
[33:15] "So Abraham's striving was over and he
[33:18] ever was over. It's confirmed. It's
[33:20] sealed. It's done. You've got it."
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Then wherein God willing more abundantly
[33:28] to show unto the heirs of promise. So
[33:30] this is not just for Abraham also, it's
[33:32] for the heirs of the promise. Who's the
[33:34] heir of the promise? I'm an heir of the
[33:37] promise.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; So he wanted to show the heirs of the
[33:40] promise the immobility of his counsel.
[33:44] Immability means unchanging. It cannot
[33:47] change. It cannot under any
[33:49] circumstances change for no reason.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; That's imu immutability of his counsel
[33:55] confirmed it by an oath that by two
[33:57] immutable things in which it was
[33:58] impossible for God to lie. So this word
[34:01] counsel, amen, means God's counsel or
[34:05] his will or you could say his purpose.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; So, so the immobility of his purpose.
[34:13] Amen. God, listen, brother Benham, when
[34:16] he goes to the seventh seal of Christ is
[34:18] the mystery of God revealed. He says God
[34:20] had one purpose in the whole Bible. The
[34:23] mystery in the back part of God's mind
[34:25] was God's purpose. Amen. And everything
[34:27] that's been revealed to us and
[34:29] everything we understand and all the
[34:30] doctrines that have been tied together
[34:32] was to show us one thing. God's great
[34:34] purpose. Why did God do all of this? Why
[34:37] did God to begin to bring forth from
[34:39] himself in creation? Why did the logos
[34:41] come out? Then after that, why did the
[34:43] heavenly host? Then after that, why
[34:44] creation on the earth? Why did he put
[34:46] man? All of this was God's purpose. And
[34:48] it's a the immutability of his purpose.
[34:52] Nothing will stop or defeat God's
[34:53] purpose. God had a purpose in it all.
[34:57] in all of it and nothing's going to stop
[34:59] the immut immutability of his purpose.
[35:02] And that's what the seventh seal has
[35:04] brought us back in contact with is God's
[35:06] original purpose. And God's original
[35:08] purpose was to become a family. All of
[35:11] his attributes made in the flesh upon
[35:13] the earth with fellowship one amongst
[35:15] another.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; So God willing to show unto the heirs of
[35:21] promise us the the the immobility of his
[35:25] purpose confirmed it by an oath
[35:29] by his word
[35:32] &gt;&gt; that by two immutable things. This is
[35:36] number one and this is number two.
[35:41] By two immutable things. His purpose and
[35:45] his word. Amen.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Do you see the two immutable things?
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; His counsel and his oath.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; That by two immutable things, his
[35:57] purpose can't change and his word cannot
[35:59] change.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; By two immutable things in which it is
[36:04] impossible for God to lie. that we not
[36:08] Abraham we
[36:10] &gt;&gt; might have strong consolation who have
[36:12] fled for refuge to lay hold upon the
[36:15] hope that is set before us
[36:17] &gt;&gt; and that hope which enterth in beyond
[36:19] the veil is what it goes on to say amen
[36:21] so that's our hope and our purpose so so
[36:24] God when he made this promise amen to
[36:27] Abraham he made the promise because of
[36:29] his purpose amen the reason he called
[36:31] Abraham he didn't call Abraham because
[36:33] he felt sorry for Abraham he didn't call
[36:35] Abraham Because Abraham was somehow
[36:37] living a superior life to everybody
[36:39] else. He went and found Abraham because
[36:41] he had a purpose for Abraham.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; And that purpose was going to be
[36:46] performed. And then he confirmed the
[36:49] promise to Abraham because of his
[36:50] purpose. And because he had a purpose
[36:52] and he had a promise, he confirmed it
[36:54] with an oath. Amen. So that by these two
[36:56] immutable things, we understand that
[36:58] God's purpose cannot change and his word
[37:00] cannot change. And if he promised it to
[37:01] Abraham, it's going to happen.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:04] and that so that he could show us the
[37:07] immobility of his counsel and that he we
[37:10] might have strong consolation so that we
[37:12] can rest because God purposed it and he
[37:16] promised it and nothing's going to stop
[37:18] it to the heirs of Abraham.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Which is us.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; So we're included in this.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; And I say that for this for this next
[37:26] reason. Brother Benham said, "Now we
[37:29] find that his royal seed is travels the
[37:32] same journey. That's bride of Christ
[37:34] travels the same journey that Abraham
[37:36] did." And so brother Benam is showing us
[37:39] in Abraham's life and he's typing
[37:41] Abraham's life and his journey through
[37:43] life with the with the journey of the
[37:46] bride. And we know this because he shows
[37:47] us the plains of memory. The plains of
[37:49] memory is when God comes down in flesh.
[37:51] Amen. And he discerns Sarah's heart and
[37:53] the tent behind him and a time to
[37:54] confirm the promise. And and brother Bam
[37:56] shows that that happens in the day that
[37:58] the prophets here. He said he said God
[38:00] is using my body.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. God just stepped into a temporary
[38:05] body on the plains of memory to come
[38:07] down to confirm the promise. Amen. With
[38:09] his back turned to the tent, discern
[38:11] Sarah's heart. And the prophet of God
[38:13] showed us the exact same thing that God
[38:15] temporarily stepped into a body. With
[38:17] his back turned to the crowd, discern
[38:18] the hearts of the people. He's showing
[38:20] us we're walking the same journey
[38:22] Abraham's walking. Abraham, amen, is a
[38:25] type of the believer. The promise was to
[38:26] Abraham and to his seed. And he said
[38:29] that seed was one, not many. And that
[38:31] seed was Christ.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; So everybody is part of Christ is part
[38:35] of this promise.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; So the bride, bride of Christ travels
[38:40] the same journey that Abraham did. So,
[38:42] now that we've been in Genesis 22, when
[38:45] God was going to test Abraham and that
[38:47] Abraham passed the test and that God was
[38:50] so pleased with him, he says, "Now I
[38:52] know that thou fearest me. I want to go
[38:54] back and follow Abraham's journey with
[38:56] all of this in inside." Okay? And we're
[38:59] going to do it quickly. It's not going
[39:00] to take long. Praise God. I don't think
[39:04] Amen.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; You guys didn't say amen.
[39:09] That means you didn't believe it or
[39:11] agree with it or something. I'm going to
[39:13] have to start doing a better job.
[39:15] Genesis 12. Let's turn there together.
[39:33] I just want to note and remind ourselves
[39:36] that God knew Abraham before he chose
[39:38] him.
[39:40] before he called him. I mean, God knew
[39:42] Abraham.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; Before Abraham's first encounter with
[39:45] God, God knew Abram.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; He knew what he would do with him. He
[39:49] knew what his purpose was for him. He
[39:51] knew the promise he would give him. He
[39:52] knew what he was going to accomplish in
[39:53] his life.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; But God
[39:57] God works with Abraham to get Abraham to
[40:01] a certain point.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want us to see. God
[40:05] labored with Abraham. He was patient
[40:07] with Abraham. He built Abraham and
[40:09] brought Abraham to a place.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Every time Abraham messed up or didn't
[40:15] quite get the message right or didn't
[40:16] quite fulfill it right, God didn't cut
[40:18] him off and throw him away and start
[40:19] over.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; God was working with him.
[40:24] When we get here to chapter 12 verse 1,
[40:28] it says, "Now the Lord had said unto
[40:32] Abram, get thee out of thy country, and
[40:34] from thy kindred, and from thy father's
[40:36] house, into a land that I will show
[40:38] thee, and I will make of thee a great
[40:40] nation, and I will bless thee, and make
[40:42] thy name great, and thou shalt be a
[40:44] blessing, and I will bless them that
[40:46] bless thee, and curse them that cursth
[40:48] thee, and in thee shall all the families
[40:51] of the earth be blessed." God starts off
[40:54] with a promise to Abraham. In his first
[40:57] meeting with Abraham, he starts off with
[40:59] a promise. And he he first he gives him
[41:01] a c commandment. He said, "Get thee out
[41:04] of thy country and from thy kindred and
[41:06] from thy father's house and to a land
[41:08] that I will show thee." Amen. Then he
[41:10] then he confirms the promise and I will
[41:13] make of thee a great nation and a bless
[41:15] thee and I will do all of these things.
[41:17] But when we go back to the first line
[41:18] here in verse one, he says, "The Lord
[41:21] had said,
[41:23] you had said past tense." When we get to
[41:26] Genesis 1, he's referring to something
[41:28] he had said in the past.
[41:31] And that's important because if we back
[41:33] up and go to uh 11:31
[41:37] 31 it says, "And Tara took Abra Abraham
[41:41] his son and Lot the son of Heron his
[41:43] son's son and Sarai his daughter-in-law
[41:46] his son Abram&lt;unk&gt;'s wife and they went
[41:48] forth with them from of the Chaldes to
[41:51] go into the land of Canaan. And they
[41:53] came into Heron and dwelt there." And
[41:56] the days of Terara were 205 years. and
[42:00] Terara died in Heron. So when we look at
[42:03] this, Amen. Now Terara has died. The
[42:06] next thing he says, now the Lord had
[42:08] said, God had already told Abraham to
[42:12] get thee out of the country, out from
[42:14] that country and from thy kindred and
[42:16] from thy father's house into a land that
[42:18] I will show thee. And God was going to
[42:20] send him where? To Canaan land. Where
[42:23] was Terara on his way? To Canaan land.
[42:26] He had taken Abraham and he had taken
[42:28] Lot and he had taken them all from south
[42:31] Mesopotamia all the way down from
[42:33] southern Mesopotamia and he moved them
[42:35] all the way up to Heron which is all the
[42:36] way up to the top of Mesopotamia right
[42:38] over where you cross into Syria. It's on
[42:40] the edge of Syria actually part of Syria
[42:43] crossing down into Canaan land. Amen.
[42:45] This is where brother Brandham said God
[42:47] had told him to separate from his nation
[42:49] from his kindred. But he took his dad
[42:50] along.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[42:53] &gt;&gt; right. He took his dad along. Amen. No
[42:55] doubt there was maybe some conversation.
[42:57] He said, "Dad, I've got to go to Canaan
[42:59] land." I don't know what the
[43:00] conversation was like, but whatever it
[43:02] was like, Terara said, "Okay, son, let's
[43:04] go." But God didn't say, "Let's all go."
[43:07] He told Abraham, "I want you to
[43:08] separate," Amen. "From your country and
[43:11] from your kindred."
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; From your family. Amen. And God was
[43:15] calling him for total separation. But
[43:17] Abraham wasn't beginning with perfect
[43:19] obedience to total separation. He was
[43:22] going along with a group of family.
[43:24] Amen. They were separating from their
[43:26] country from all the other
[43:27] &gt;&gt; kindred but he was still there with dad
[43:29] and he was still there with Lot.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Y amen.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Then when Terara died.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we read here what God had
[43:38] already told Abraham. God had already
[43:41] told him. And so now when we come to
[43:43] verse four it says we go back to chapter
[43:46] 12:4.
[43:48] It says, "So Abram departed as the Lord
[43:51] had spoken unto him, and Lot went with
[43:54] him. And Abram was 70 and5 years old
[43:57] when he departed out of Heron. And Abram
[43:59] took Sarai his wife, and Lot his
[44:02] brother's son, and all their substance
[44:03] that they had gathered, and the souls
[44:05] that they had gotten in Heron, and they
[44:07] went forth to go into the land of
[44:09] Canaan. And unto the land of Canaan they
[44:12] came." And brother Ram makes this
[44:14] statement here in the message absolute.
[44:17] So the Bible said when this when it when
[44:19] his orbituary was written he said Abram
[44:22] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[44:24] God through unbelief but was strong
[44:26] giving praise to God. Why did you ever
[44:30] think why he was absolute positive and
[44:34] the only thing he had to do was separate
[44:36] himself from his people and God never
[44:38] did bless him until he did. He took his
[44:40] daddy his daddy died. He took Lot. Then
[44:42] after Lot separated from Abraham, then
[44:44] God came to them and said, "Now walk
[44:46] through the land. See, obedience,
[44:48] promise under conditions always goes
[44:51] with God and his word." So, brother Ram
[44:54] is showing us that that that Abraham,
[44:56] although he believed the word of God, he
[44:58] believed the promise, he believed what
[45:00] God told him, he was in motion, he was
[45:02] moving over to Canaan. Amen. He wasn't
[45:05] fully obeying the word,
[45:08] &gt;&gt; but he believed it.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Oh, I hope you can see
[45:12] yourself. I hope you can look back over
[45:14] your journey, seed of Abraham, and say,
[45:16] "Listen, I believe the word of God, but
[45:19] I didn't always obey it fully, and there
[45:21] was things I might have been confused
[45:22] about, and I didn't see it the way I see
[45:24] it now."
[45:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; But God's been working with me all
[45:28] along. God's been leading me on the
[45:30] journey step by step. God's never
[45:32] forsaken me, and he never changed his
[45:34] mind about me. And there I look back now
[45:36] then, you know, I look back now over my
[45:38] journey of truth and I'm ashamed at some
[45:40] things I allowed and things I permitted
[45:42] and things that still hung on to me. But
[45:44] praise God, I never doubted that this
[45:46] message was true. I never doubted the
[45:48] word of promise that he gave to me. I
[45:50] may have been confused about and
[45:51] misunderstood parts and didn't fully
[45:53] obey. But praise God, he never gave up
[45:56] on me. The promise was for me. He knew
[45:58] what I would be and he knows what I'm
[46:00] going to be and he's willing to work
[46:02] with me to get me there. Amen.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; And so he Abraham didn't do exactly
[46:09] right, but Abraham believed.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; We go over to Genesis 13 now verse 5. Go
[46:20] to chapter 13:5.
[46:23] And Lot also which went with Abram had
[46:26] flocks and herds and tents. Now we're
[46:27] still dealing with Lot. and the land was
[46:30] not able to bear them that they might
[46:32] dwell together for their substance was
[46:34] great so that they could not dwell
[46:35] together. And there was a strife between
[46:38] the herdman Abram&lt;unk&gt;s cattle and the
[46:40] herdman of Lot's cattle. And the
[46:41] Canaanite and the parizzite dwelt in the
[46:44] then in the land. And Abram said unto
[46:46] Lot, "Let there be no strife, I pray
[46:48] thee, between me and thee, and between
[46:50] my herdmen and thy herdmen, for we be
[46:53] brethren. Is not the whole land before
[46:56] thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee,
[46:58] from me. If thou will take the left
[47:00] hand, then I will go to the right. Or if
[47:03] thou depart to the right hand, then I
[47:05] will go to the left. So now God, listen,
[47:09] God promised Abraham, and God's going to
[47:12] keep the promise.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Abraham believes God's promise, but he's
[47:17] not in full obedience. There's either a
[47:20] misunderstanding or he has a lack of
[47:22] character at this point. There's
[47:23] something going on to where Abraham's
[47:25] not able to fully separate from his
[47:27] kindred.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; He's separated now from his nation, but
[47:30] he hasn't separated from his kindred. So
[47:32] God allows circumstances to build.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Has God ever allowed circumstances
[47:38] to build in you to push you to more of
[47:40] his word? Oh, the grace of God, the
[47:43] abundant grace of God to allow the
[47:45] strife amongst the herdsmen to create
[47:47] tension. Amen. It's all bad. No, it's
[47:50] all good, friends. It's all been good.
[47:52] It all is good. It all will be good.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Now, the strife. And Abraham has to deal
[47:59] with the strife. And how is he going to
[48:00] deal with? He just says, "You know what,
[48:02] Lot? We're brethren. Let's have peace.
[48:04] You get to pick wherever you want to go.
[48:07] And wherever you want to go, I'll go the
[48:08] other way. Let's separate now for
[48:10] peace."
[48:12] &gt;&gt; So, we know what what Lot chooses, but
[48:15] but now there's a separation. And I just
[48:17] want you to see that God, Amen, never
[48:19] gave up on Abraham saying, "Well, he
[48:21] still got Lot with him. I'm going to go
[48:23] find somebody else." God knows how to
[48:25] deal with all circumstances in our life.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; He's, if you're heir of the promise,
[48:30] you're heir of the promise. He's not
[48:32] going to change. Who's heir of the
[48:34] promise? You are heir of the promise.
[48:36] So, he's going to work with you.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so thankful God didn't leave me
[48:42] alone. I'm so thankful God didn't see me
[48:45] in my disobedience and in my error and
[48:46] in my confusion and say he ain't getting
[48:49] it. I'm going to go find somebody who
[48:50] will. But God made circumstances rise up
[48:53] in my life that caused me to wake up.
[48:55] Amen. And even if I don't fully wake up
[48:57] immediately, God works something in my
[48:59] life and later I come too.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, thank you, God.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; I didn't realize what that was hindering
[49:06] me. I didn't realize that was holding me
[49:09] back." Amen.
[49:11] So Abraham so kindly, Amen, gives him
[49:14] the first choice, the best choice. And
[49:16] brother Rem says, Abraham was changed.
[49:19] And look, when a man got God called
[49:22] Abraham and he and he told him he wanted
[49:24] him to separate himself from all of his
[49:26] unbelieving kindred. And when God calls
[49:28] a man to work for him, he calls you from
[49:30] total annihilation, from all the things
[49:32] of the world and the sins of the earth.
[49:34] Separation. God never did bless Abraham
[49:37] till he fully obeyed him.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. He took his father. The old man
[49:41] was always a hair in the soup or excuse
[49:43] that expression.
[49:44] But he was always wrong. And Abraham and
[49:47] then he got Lot. And then he finally
[49:49] went down there. And after Lot separated
[49:51] himself, then God said to Abraham, "Rise
[49:54] and walk through the land. I've give it
[49:56] all to you. It's all yours." See?
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; He never fully blessed him till Abraham
[50:02] fully obeyed. And you'll never be able
[50:05] to get anything from God and have favor
[50:07] with God, my brothers and sisters,
[50:08] wherever you are, until we fully obey
[50:11] the word of God. You make yourself
[50:13] miserable by just half-heartedly
[50:15] approaching it.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, that was a good statement.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; We make you make yourself miserable by
[50:23] just halfhearted
[50:25] approaching it.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it doesn't work out. And
[50:29] and things don't work out and and why
[50:31] isn't it working out? and and we don't
[50:33] understand, but we become miserable
[50:35] ourselves because we don't just throw
[50:37] ourselves all the way into the word and
[50:39] just give everything for it.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; After he separated, let's look at verse
[50:44] 14, chapter 13:14.
[50:47] And the Lord said unto Abram after that
[50:49] lot was separated from him, "Lift up now
[50:52] thine eyes, and look from the place
[50:53] where there are northward, and
[50:54] southward, and eastward, and westward.
[50:57] For all the land which thou seest to
[50:58] thee will I give it, and to thy seed
[51:01] forever. and I will make thy seed as the
[51:03] dust of the earth, so that if a man can
[51:05] number the dust of the earth, then shall
[51:07] thy seed also be numbered. Arise, walk
[51:10] through the land in the length of it,
[51:12] and in the breadth of it, for I will
[51:14] give it unto thee. Before this point,
[51:17] God had said, "I'm going to give you a
[51:18] land. I'm going to make you a nation,
[51:21] and all the nations of the earth are
[51:22] going to be blessed in you. I'm going to
[51:23] make you a people." Amen. But that's the
[51:25] farthest his revelation went until God
[51:28] brought him to another level of
[51:30] separation. And when he came to another
[51:32] level of separation from unbelief. Amen.
[51:35] Then all of a sudden said God says now,
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; I want to show you something else.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Not a new word, not a new promise. This
[51:44] is the same word, the same promise, a
[51:47] greater revelation, a further unveiling
[51:49] of the same promise. He said, "Now look
[51:51] to the north and to the from where you
[51:53] are right now." Where was he right now?
[51:56] He was in total separation from
[51:58] unbelief. Amen. And he had come to he
[52:00] had come to fully obey the first
[52:02] commandment. And how did he get to that
[52:04] point? Listen, it wasn't his own
[52:06] strength. It wasn't his own willpower.
[52:08] It wasn't his own might. God helped him
[52:10] get there.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Because God knew what was in him. And
[52:15] God needed him there.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; And God couldn't give him another
[52:22] revelation until he come to this point.
[52:24] So something was hindered in Abraham's
[52:27] walk and in Abraham's life. He was the
[52:28] recipient of the promise. Amen. The
[52:30] promise rested upon him. He was in the
[52:32] land in Canaan land, but he didn't know
[52:35] which portion was his. He didn't know
[52:37] how much was his. He just know he's
[52:38] giving him a country and he's walking
[52:40] around all over the place that's his,
[52:43] &gt;&gt; but he doesn't yet know because he
[52:45] doesn't know the further unfolding of
[52:47] the prophecy. And then all of a sudden,
[52:49] when God, amen, allows circumstances and
[52:52] circumstances wrought their purpose. And
[52:53] in the purpose, amen. He so willingly
[52:56] separates from Lot and gives Lot the
[52:58] best of everything. Now, as soon as Lot
[53:00] separates, he says, "Now look around.
[53:02] It's all yours. As far as you can see
[53:04] this way, as far that way and to the
[53:07] east and to the west, it's all yours.
[53:09] Now rise up and walk in it, for I've
[53:11] given it all to you."
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[53:20] He will never fully bless until Abraham
[53:23] fully obeyed.
[53:24] Abraham needed help getting there.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; We've needed help getting there.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; I've needed some help getting there.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; I believed his word. Love God with all
[53:37] my heart, but certain things were were
[53:39] were either blind spots or trappings or
[53:43] things that were so hooked into me I
[53:45] didn't realize what they were doing to
[53:47] me. But God in his great mercy allowed
[53:50] circumstances to rise up that would
[53:52] force a level of separation from
[53:54] something of the world world or or
[53:56] whatever that it might be. But after the
[53:58] separation comes, amen, it was God's
[54:01] mercy and grace to allow the strife, to
[54:03] allow the tension, to allow the problem,
[54:05] to allow the sickness, to allow the
[54:07] layoff, to allow whatever it was that
[54:10] happened to us. It was the grace of God.
[54:12] And then in separation, amen, all of a
[54:14] sudden God says, "Now look, Amen.
[54:16] There's more that I want to show you
[54:18] about what you already know.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, God's so good.
[54:25] But then when brother Benham says,
[54:29] uh, you'll never be able to get anything
[54:31] from God until we fully obey the word of
[54:34] God. I'm so glad God is helping with
[54:37] this. Hallelujah. If
[54:39] &gt;&gt; this was just left to us only, friends,
[54:43] you know, I I would like for you to come
[54:46] to me tonight and explain to me where
[54:47] all your blind spots are.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Because if you can explain them to me,
[54:55] they're not blind spots. They're just
[54:56] complexes. They're just besetting sins.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; But we probably still have blind spots.
[55:03] Oh yeah.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; So as God begins to reveal and God
[55:09] begins to speak through the preaching of
[55:11] the word, through the message, through
[55:12] circumstances in life, and we begin to
[55:14] separate and and move away and get rid
[55:17] of these things or let them fall away
[55:18] from us or separate from us or whatever,
[55:22] then we're coming into a greater
[55:24] obedience all the time. And we're doing
[55:25] so with joy. And we're doing so
[55:26] willingly. When Abraham finally got to
[55:28] it, he was willing.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; He was willing. very willing. Willing.
[55:33] So much willing he would take the worst
[55:35] property, the worst land, the worst
[55:37] grazing ground. And and and and Lot took
[55:40] the best.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; But by the time separation came, he was
[55:43] so willing for separation. He was
[55:46] willing to sacrifice the better of the
[55:48] land. He was willing to sacrifice
[55:50] himself to have this separation.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; That he would take the he would take the
[55:55] low end. He would take the bad end of
[55:58] the deal and give Lot the best end of
[56:00] the deal. Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; And then God blessed him.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; When Abraham came to this place of
[56:08] separation, he made himself vulnerable.
[56:14] He come to a place where he said you
[56:16] take whichever place you want.
[56:19] And when he says you take the place you
[56:22] want, it left Abraham vulnerable
[56:25] &gt;&gt; because Abraham was going to get
[56:26] whatever was left over.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said that Lot
[56:32] looked to the land of Sodom and Gomorrah
[56:35] because it was well watered.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; And the reason they had strife is
[56:39] because of all their herds and all their
[56:41] cattle and everything that needed to
[56:43] graze.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; And the problem was over grazing land.
[56:47] And what did Lot take? Lot took the best
[56:50] grazing land. What did he leave Abraham
[56:52] for? Brother Bam said he left Abraham
[56:54] back up in the rocky land where his
[56:56] cattle were starving to death.
[57:00] Oh, I love it when God gets us to the
[57:03] place where we're willing to make
[57:04] ourselves vulnerable for separation.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; I'll take the worst.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; If I have to give up the job, God, I'll
[57:10] give up the job.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; I'll take the lower job to be in church
[57:15] instead of the higher job and be
[57:16] separated from your promise.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; I'll take the low land. I'll take the
[57:22] rocky land. I'll take whatever.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Just so I can have Amen. so I can be in
[57:28] the right position, in the right place,
[57:30] and do the right thing.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; I love it when God finally gets us to us
[57:34] where we're willing to sacrifice
[57:35] ourselves. When we're willing to lay it
[57:37] down, when we're not fighting for the
[57:39] best, and we're not fighting to be
[57:40] first, and we're not fighting for self-p
[57:43] protection. We're not fighting for
[57:44] self-promotion, but we're willing to
[57:46] separate from whatever so that we can
[57:48] stay in the word of God.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, God knows how to get us there,
[57:52] friends. But he knows what's in us. And
[57:53] he knows when we get there, we'll say,
[57:55] "Yes, Lord. That's what I want. Amen.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; So you make yourself miserable by just
[58:02] half-heartedly approaching it.
[58:05] What a statement, friends.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; This is true today.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; This is true every day. Just whether
[58:11] we're in or out, half this, half that,
[58:13] committed, not committed. Listen, we
[58:15] make ourselves miserable by a
[58:17] halfheartedly approach to it.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; When God did things in the kingdom of
[58:23] God, he needed people who gave all.
[58:26] Amen. Last Wednesday we were speaking
[58:29] about three different women. We talked
[58:30] about Ruth, we talked about Tamar, and
[58:32] we talked about Mary. When we look at
[58:35] Ruth, Ruth, I want to read here from
[58:36] Ruth chapter 3 verse 6. And she went
[58:39] down into the floor and did according to
[58:42] all that her mother-in-law bade her. And
[58:44] when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his
[58:46] heart was merry, he went to lie down at
[58:48] the end of the heap of corn. And she
[58:50] came softly and uncovered his feet and
[58:52] laid her down. And it came to pass at
[58:54] midnight that the man was afraid, and he
[58:56] turned himself, and behold, a woman lay
[58:57] at his feet. And he said, "Who art
[59:00] thou?" And she said, "I am Ruth, thine
[59:01] handmmaid. Spread therefore thy skirt
[59:03] over thine handmmaid, for thou art a
[59:05] near kinsman."
[59:07] We've talked about this before, but I
[59:09] want to bring it to your attention
[59:10] again. When Ruth went that day, she
[59:13] prepared herself according to the way
[59:15] Naomi said. She dressed herself, bathed
[59:17] herself, prepared herself, and she knew
[59:20] what she was going to do. And what she
[59:22] was going to do was put herself in a
[59:24] very risky position.
[59:26] She was going to go in a way that seemed
[59:32] really terrible and risky. She was going
[59:35] to offer herself to a man.
[59:39] And she was going to she was going to
[59:41] offer herself to this man for
[59:43] redemption,
[59:45] for redemptive purposes because this man
[59:47] was the kinsman redeemer.
[59:50] And when she went, you know, in the
[59:52] morning, he said, "Go out while it's yet
[59:55] early." So nobody knows a woman was at
[59:56] the threshing floor. She shouldn't have
[59:58] been there.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Are we clear? She's dressed. She's
[1:00:02] prepared. Boaz is Mary. He makes himself
[1:00:04] merry. He lays down at the heap of corn.
[1:00:07] And there's a moment, if I could just
[1:00:09] dramatize it, there's a moment in time
[1:00:12] where she's waiting for Boaz to fall
[1:00:14] asleep. She's waiting for his breath to
[1:00:15] get heavy. She's in between time. She's
[1:00:18] here. She's at the point of decision.
[1:00:20] She's heard what Naomi said. We need
[1:00:22] redemption. There's no other option. I
[1:00:24] can give myself to this man. She doesn't
[1:00:26] know what Boaz will say. She only knows
[1:00:28] what the law is of kinsman redeemer. She
[1:00:31] knows who she is in this whole program.
[1:00:33] What Naomi's told her. And she knows who
[1:00:35] Boaz is, but she doesn't know how Boaz
[1:00:38] will react to her. And she gets to this
[1:00:40] place where she comes to the point of
[1:00:43] all or nothing.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Right. You don't do this half-heartedly.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; You don't bump into him at the dinner
[1:00:51] when everybody's gathered around say,
[1:00:53] "Hey, you know, what do you think? Um,
[1:00:54] can we be friends?"
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; There's no halfway to do this, friend.
[1:01:00] There comes a time in Ruth and Ruth's
[1:01:02] life. There comes a moment in time where
[1:01:04] now she's waited long enough. It sounds
[1:01:06] like he's asleep. Everybody else has
[1:01:08] fallen asleep. It's now or never. But
[1:01:10] when she goes into that place she's not
[1:01:13] supposed to be and the privacy of the
[1:01:15] hidden inner chamber and she uncovers
[1:01:17] his feet and she lays down at his feet.
[1:01:20] Listen, she's in the hands of Boaz from
[1:01:22] that moment on. She has to trust in the
[1:01:25] integrity of the kinsman redeemer
[1:01:26] because there's no turning back from
[1:01:28] this point. If he wakes up and sounds
[1:01:30] the alarm and why are you here?
[1:01:32] Everybody come here. They're going to
[1:01:34] take her out and stone her as an
[1:01:36] unrighteous, unholy woman, unworthy
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; because of what she was trying to do.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; So Ruth can't do this half-heartedly.
[1:01:46] When she gives herself to Boaz, it's all
[1:01:48] or nothing. And now she's dependent on
[1:01:51] the integrity of somebody else, which is
[1:01:54] Boaz. She had enough experience with him
[1:01:56] and knows who he is in the community and
[1:01:57] seen his character. She must have some
[1:02:00] confidence in Boaz and his position as
[1:02:03] kenan redeemer or she would never be
[1:02:05] able to throw herself at his feet not
[1:02:07] knowing what the outcome would be.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Listen, this is what Christ is looking
[1:02:13] for. Do you know enough about him? He's
[1:02:15] our kinsman redeemer. Have you seen his
[1:02:17] character enough that you can trust him
[1:02:19] with your life, with your reputation,
[1:02:21] with your honor, with everything you've
[1:02:23] got? She's giving up her honor, her
[1:02:25] reputation. He says, "All the villages
[1:02:28] know you're a virtuous woman." If he
[1:02:30] says the wrong thing at that moment,
[1:02:31] they'll all know she's not a virtuous
[1:02:33] woman. She's worked hard to uphold her
[1:02:35] reputation. She's been faithful to
[1:02:37] Naomi. She's kept her integrity, and
[1:02:39] she's giving it all to him.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the only way to serve God,
[1:02:49] friends.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; This is the only way to come to this
[1:02:52] message. You don't come halfway. This
[1:02:54] message is Christ. This is the headship.
[1:02:56] This is the bridegroom looking for a
[1:02:57] bride to marry. You don't come with one
[1:02:59] foot in, one foot out, waiting for
[1:03:01] something to go wrong. You This is all
[1:03:03] or nothing, friends.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; This is either the fullness of
[1:03:06] redemption or it's not. It's either
[1:03:08] truth or it's not. We don't come
[1:03:10] halfway. But I've seen enough of the
[1:03:12] integrity of Christ in this message to
[1:03:14] know I can trust the kinsman redeemer. I
[1:03:16] can lay myself down at his feet and he's
[1:03:19] the one who's got to guard my reputation
[1:03:21] and declare me virtuous and get give me
[1:03:23] my honor.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; I can't do it for myself anymore. I've
[1:03:27] given myself away to a kinsman redeemer.
[1:03:29] Now I trust him.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; When Tamar, amen, put on the the veil
[1:03:37] and the and the clothes of harlotry and
[1:03:39] she went to do what she felt like she
[1:03:41] needed to do for redemption for the seed
[1:03:44] line. Amen. She went to play the harlot
[1:03:46] with Judah. You realize she come to a
[1:03:49] point of no turning back.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; She come to a place when she made up her
[1:03:54] mind and made her decision. That was not
[1:03:56] a halfhearted decision. There's no way
[1:03:58] to do that half-heartedly.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; You can't do that halfway. That was a
[1:04:03] fullon 100% commitment. I'm going all
[1:04:07] the way. This is the only hope for me.
[1:04:09] This is the only chance that I've got.
[1:04:10] If it's not this, then I'll be left
[1:04:12] destitute and I've got a right
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; to that seed line.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; She went. Amen. She did what she had to
[1:04:22] do. She asked for the tokens that she
[1:04:23] asked for. Amen. But when it came time
[1:04:25] for judgment to be passed three months
[1:04:27] later, word had come. She's a harlot.
[1:04:30] She's going to be stoned. Judah
[1:04:31] pronounces judgment. Bring her here and
[1:04:33] burn her.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; I mean, she comes to Judah.
[1:04:38] Listen, all she does is lay out the
[1:04:41] tokens.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; She doesn't argue. She doesn't persuade.
[1:04:46] She doesn't beg. She doesn't do
[1:04:48] anything.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; She said, "I'm pregnant by the man who
[1:04:52] owns these. You discern whose these
[1:04:55] are."
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Basically saying, "You decide whether
[1:04:59] I'm righteous or not."
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; She had to trust in Judah to be a
[1:05:04] righteous judge.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because if Judah protected himself
[1:05:08] and he covered it up and he lied, she
[1:05:11] was being burnt.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; But Judah is the judging tribe. Judah is
[1:05:17] the king tribe. Amen.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is the lion of the tribe of
[1:05:22] Judah, the judge, the righteous judge.
[1:05:24] And here I in the story of Ruth, Boaz is
[1:05:27] playing the part of Christ.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; In the judges here, Judah is playing the
[1:05:32] part of Christ as the judge to judge
[1:05:33] righteously. Amen. And he looks at the
[1:05:36] tokens and he realizes, amen, this woman
[1:05:38] is more righteous than I. And he
[1:05:40] declares her virtuous. He declares her
[1:05:42] sinless. He declares her right. Amen.
[1:05:44] Why? She came. What? What was her s
[1:05:47] salvation? She came to the point of no
[1:05:49] return.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; This is the way I believe this message,
[1:05:54] friends. It's the point of no return.
[1:05:56] There is no halfway believing the truth.
[1:05:59] Amen. Brother BM's a prophet. He's right
[1:06:00] about this, but he's wrong about this.
[1:06:02] and he got some of these dogs right, but
[1:06:03] I don't understand about that and I'll
[1:06:05] still take my own idea on these things
[1:06:06] and I want to mix it with what I feel
[1:06:08] about that. Hey, that's going to make
[1:06:10] you miserable.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; But if we come to this message, we got
[1:06:15] to come like Ruth coming to Boaz and we
[1:06:17] got to come like Tamar giving herself
[1:06:19] completely up. Amen. Her reputation and
[1:06:21] everything giving it completely up for
[1:06:23] redemption, for the right to receive the
[1:06:25] seed from the seedgiver himself.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you. trusting in his character,
[1:06:32] not mine.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Trusting in the character of Boaz,
[1:06:37] trusting in the character of Judah, and
[1:06:40] now I trust in the character of Christ,
[1:06:42] who is the messenger, who is the
[1:06:44] bridegroom, who is the headship, who is
[1:06:46] the word that's been restored. I've seen
[1:06:48] enough to know he's trustworthy.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] So important, friends.
[1:07:01] Mary was the third we looked at. Mary
[1:07:04] said, "Behold, the handmade of the Lord,
[1:07:06] be it unto me according to thy word."
[1:07:08] And the angel departed from her. Mary,
[1:07:12] when she receives conception, it's the
[1:07:15] point of no return.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; How do you on all three of these women?
[1:07:19] How do you back up from this?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; How do you explain it away?
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Hey, it's a one-way street, friends. and
[1:07:27] coming to Christ for me is a one-way
[1:07:29] street.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; God was looking for Abraham to keep
[1:07:36] moving into the promise and separate and
[1:07:38] move and separate and move. I'm going to
[1:07:42] go back to this quote here. He says,
[1:07:43] "Now, as we notice going just a little
[1:07:47] further, we find that when Abraham had
[1:07:49] separated himself from Lot, and I want
[1:07:51] you to notice the Christian act in
[1:07:53] Abraham, he said, Lot, you take the
[1:07:54] choice." Lot being backsliden in his
[1:07:56] heart, he looked, he took the
[1:07:58] well-watered plains of Sodom and
[1:07:59] Gomorrah. But Abraham had to take the
[1:08:01] poor. He had to take the barren ground.
[1:08:03] He was satisfied. No matter what his
[1:08:06] estate was, he was satisfied that God
[1:08:09] was with him.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my f my friends, my friends. No
[1:08:14] matter what his estate was, he was
[1:08:17] satisfied with God. I am an heir of
[1:08:20] Abraham. I'm Abraham's seed. I'm part of
[1:08:22] this promise and I'm satisfied. If I've
[1:08:25] got to miss out on the promotion, if
[1:08:27] I've got to miss out on the extra this
[1:08:29] or the inh
[1:08:31] the the reputation of that, if I've got
[1:08:33] to miss out on something, I am satisfied
[1:08:36] in my estate because I am satisfied that
[1:08:39] God is with me.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; And I'd rather have him than have all
[1:08:44] the gold in the world. I'd rather have
[1:08:46] him than have the best reputation.
[1:08:48] Amen.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; I remember there was a I was reading the
[1:08:51] biography of Charles Spurgeon. I was
[1:08:53] just telling my wife this yesterday.
[1:08:54] Charles Spurgeon. Amen. He was a young
[1:08:56] preacher. He was converted at 7 or 15,
[1:08:59] started preaching at 17. By 19, he was
[1:09:01] the pastor of a of a large congregation
[1:09:04] in in the metropolitan area of London.
[1:09:08] And he got notoriety and fame. He had a
[1:09:10] booming voice. He he he he was a gifted
[1:09:12] preacher and he started getting popular
[1:09:14] and people started moving in. And when
[1:09:16] he did, jealousy creeped up and all of a
[1:09:18] sudden the the the newspaper started a
[1:09:21] smear campaign against him and the
[1:09:22] cartoonist started drawing very
[1:09:24] unflattering pictures of him with
[1:09:27] captions and articles that really spoke
[1:09:29] evil of him, right?
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; And and Spurgeon went through this time
[1:09:34] of great depression. He was rattled when
[1:09:36] all of this stuff happened and and the
[1:09:38] papers were writing this and they were
[1:09:40] smearing him and other ministers were
[1:09:41] saying things to him. And in the
[1:09:43] biography, I he got to this place and it
[1:09:45] really moved me. It touched me in
[1:09:49] depression and agony. He was praying and
[1:09:51] praying day after day. He couldn't
[1:09:52] understand why they were doing this to
[1:09:53] him and what it all meant. And he made
[1:09:56] this statement is something like this.
[1:09:58] It's not an exact quote, but something
[1:09:59] like, "God,
[1:10:01] the most precious thing I have to me is
[1:10:03] my reputation."
[1:10:06] And he said, "It's the only thing I have
[1:10:08] that is mine alone."
[1:10:12] Think about that. It's the only thing I
[1:10:15] have that is mine alone. His reputation
[1:10:18] and his reputation he had earned.
[1:10:22] Are we together?
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; What he would think is his good
[1:10:26] reputation. The reputation he wanted to
[1:10:28] honor and uphold. And you don't share
[1:10:31] your reputation with anybody else.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; He's the only thing I have that's mine
[1:10:36] alone.
[1:10:38] He said, "But God, if you want it, I
[1:10:40] give it to you
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; for Christ's sake."
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; And he was willing to go right back. His
[1:10:47] depression ended. He came out of it. He
[1:10:48] went right back and kept preaching like
[1:10:50] he always preached. And they kept the
[1:10:52] smear campaign. And they kept all the
[1:10:53] evil. And they did all the things that
[1:10:55] they did before, but he kept on
[1:10:57] preaching and hammering away.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes the separation we have
[1:11:03] to go through is not people, is not
[1:11:05] jobs, is not physical. Sometimes the
[1:11:07] separation we have to go through is our
[1:11:09] own reputation.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; What people think of us and how they
[1:11:13] view us and what they say about us or
[1:11:15] how we want to be viewed ourselves. We
[1:11:17] need to separate from that.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; And unify with Christ.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; And and all three of those situations we
[1:11:27] talked about with those women, they were
[1:11:29] willing to give up their reputation and
[1:11:31] what people thought of them and risk it
[1:11:33] all to be a further part of the word.
[1:11:36] And are we willing to do the same thing?
[1:11:41] Let's go to Genesis 17. We're going to
[1:11:43] keep picking up the story and following
[1:11:45] Abraham through
[1:11:47] Genesis 17
[1:11:50] and we're going to go to verse 18.
[1:11:56] And I want you to see something here.
[1:12:00] And Abraham said unto God, "Oh, that
[1:12:02] Ishmael might live before thee." And God
[1:12:06] said, Sarah, thy wife shall bear thee a
[1:12:08] son indeed, and shall and thou shalt
[1:12:11] call his name Isaac, and I will
[1:12:12] establish my covenant with him for an
[1:12:14] everlasting covenant, and with his seed
[1:12:16] after him. And as for Ishmael, I have
[1:12:19] heard thee, behold, I have blessed him,
[1:12:21] and will make him a fruit, will make him
[1:12:23] fruitful, and will multiply him
[1:12:25] exceedingly. 12 princes shall he beget,
[1:12:27] and I will make him a great nation. But
[1:12:30] my covenant will I establish with Isaac,
[1:12:32] which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this
[1:12:34] set time in the next year. And he left
[1:12:37] off talking with him, and God went up
[1:12:39] from Abraham. So I I read that because I
[1:12:42] wanted you to see how dear Ishmael is to
[1:12:46] Abraham.
[1:12:47] When we talk about Ishmael, we talk
[1:12:49] about him as a renegade, as a problem
[1:12:52] maker for Isaac, for the fighting
[1:12:54] between the seed. But that's not how
[1:12:56] Abraham viewed him. Right.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; This was Abraham's son through Hagar.
[1:13:00] And Abraham had raised him to this
[1:13:02] point. He was 12 or 13 at this point.
[1:13:04] And Abraham loved him. And no doubt they
[1:13:05] spent a great deal of time together. And
[1:13:07] he had affection for for Ishmael. And
[1:13:09] Ishmael was his son.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Carrying his genetics, maybe some of his
[1:13:15] likeness. Amen. Maybe some of his
[1:13:17] characteristics. And he loved him
[1:13:19] dearly. And when God come to confirm the
[1:13:21] promise to him that he was going to have
[1:13:23] a son by Sarah, he said, "Oh, that
[1:13:25] Ishmael might live before thee. Oh, God,
[1:13:27] could you spare Ishmael, too?" And God
[1:13:30] says, "It's going to be Isaac."
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Clearly, it's going to be Isaac, but
[1:13:34] don't worry about Ishmael. I will bless
[1:13:36] him, too, because he's your seed. I'll
[1:13:37] make a nation out of him, and 12 princes
[1:13:39] shall come out of him. But my promise is
[1:13:41] going with Isaac. Yeah.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; So, we see the love that that Abraham
[1:13:46] has for Ishmael. Cuz I don't like to
[1:13:48] read the Bible and go through these
[1:13:50] things and and miss how important
[1:13:52] certain things are and miss the
[1:13:54] relationship and the love Abraham had
[1:13:56] for Ishmael. We all look at Ishmael and
[1:13:58] kind of smile when we think of Ishmael.
[1:14:00] That is not what Abraham thought of
[1:14:01] Ishmael.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; They got they had morning breakfast
[1:14:05] together. They did chores together.
[1:14:06] Ishmael sat on his knee. He told him
[1:14:08] stories. He told him about Jehovah. He
[1:14:10] sowed into him good things because he
[1:14:12] wanted him he wanted him to carry on. He
[1:14:15] wanted him to to be saved. We could say
[1:14:17] he wanted him to love God. He wanted to
[1:14:18] put into him all these good
[1:14:20] characteristics. He wanted to set him
[1:14:21] up. He wanted him to be blessed. He was
[1:14:23] proud of him. He laughed at his jokes.
[1:14:25] He was proud of him when he won the foot
[1:14:27] race against the servants. This is what
[1:14:28] Abraham thought of Ishmael.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Amen.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Just like you would
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; if you had a son.
[1:14:37] Genesis 21.
[1:14:40] Let's read from verse 9. Genesis chapter
[1:14:43] 21
[1:14:46] and verse 9.
[1:14:50] And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the
[1:14:52] Egyptian, which she had borne unto
[1:14:54] Abraham, mocking.
[1:14:56] Wherefore she said unto Abraham, cast
[1:14:58] out this bond woman and her son, for the
[1:15:00] son of the bond woman shall not be heir
[1:15:02] with my son, even with Isaac. And the
[1:15:05] thing was very grievious in Abraham's
[1:15:07] sight because of his son. Do you feel
[1:15:10] Abraham's pain?
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Do you see why it would be very
[1:15:13] grievious in his sight? And God said
[1:15:17] unto Abraham, "Let it not be grievious
[1:15:19] in thy sight because of the lad and
[1:15:21] because of the bond woman." And all that
[1:15:23] Sarah has said unto thee, hearken unto
[1:15:26] her voice, for in Isaac shall thy seed
[1:15:28] be called. And also of the son of the
[1:15:31] bond woman will I make a nation because
[1:15:33] he is thy seed. And Abraham rose up
[1:15:36] early in the morning and took bread and
[1:15:38] a bottle of water and gave it unto
[1:15:40] Hagar, putting it on her shoulder and
[1:15:42] the child and sent her away. And she
[1:15:45] departed wandering in the wilderness of
[1:15:47] Beersa.
[1:15:51] We thought separation from Lot was hard.
[1:15:59] when he separated from Lot and he just
[1:16:01] couldn't bear the thought after Tara
[1:16:04] died, his dad died. Now Lot doesn't have
[1:16:06] anybody because Lot's dad was already
[1:16:09] dead, which was Abraham's brother. He
[1:16:12] had already died. So Tara had taken Lot
[1:16:14] under wing. Now Tara, which would have
[1:16:16] been Lot's grandpa, now he dies. So
[1:16:19] Abraham has a feeling for Lot and he
[1:16:20] takes Lot along and he can't bear the
[1:16:22] thought of leaving Lot behind and all
[1:16:24] the things they go through and finally
[1:16:25] God works the circumstances where he has
[1:16:28] to separate from Lot and then God
[1:16:29] confirms the promise. But you think God
[1:16:32] surely wouldn't ask for more.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Surely God wouldn't ask for more
[1:16:38] separation.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Surely not. Surely that was enough. But
[1:16:43] sure enough God had a purpose.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God had a plan and God had a
[1:16:48] promise and God had his word.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; And now he asked Abraham to send Ishmael
[1:16:54] away.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; And Ishmael takes the bond woman, takes
[1:16:58] the lad, takes Ishmael, he would have
[1:17:00] been 13 approximately at this age,
[1:17:03] and he gives him bread and a bottle of
[1:17:06] water and sends them away.
[1:17:09] And can you imagine what was happening
[1:17:11] in his heart
[1:17:13] when they walked away?
[1:17:16] didn't know what would happen to him.
[1:17:18] Didn't know. And you say, "Surely God
[1:17:22] wouldn't ask for more separation."
[1:17:26] And the answer says is, "If it serves
[1:17:30] his immutable purpose,
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; he will."
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; He told Abraham because he knows
[1:17:38] Abraham's love for the boy. And God was
[1:17:40] good to Abraham. God didn't know Ishmael
[1:17:43] anything. But because of Abraham, he
[1:17:44] says, "I'll make a nation out of him."
[1:17:46] And God protected him when he's at the
[1:17:47] point of death, the angel of the Lord
[1:17:49] heard his prayer. And because of the the
[1:17:51] prayer of the Lad, not the bond woman's
[1:17:53] prayer, but the prayer of the lad. He
[1:17:54] saved him and built him up and he became
[1:17:56] a nation and 12 princes. And he got all
[1:17:58] that God promised he would have. That's
[1:18:00] God's mercy and goodness because of
[1:18:02] Abraham.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Abraham loved Lot. That's why that's why
[1:18:07] God went and sent a rescue mission in
[1:18:09] the into Sodom and brought him out by
[1:18:11] the hand. When Lot delayed, he took him
[1:18:13] by the hand, the angel did, and brought
[1:18:15] him away. Not because of Lot. Because
[1:18:17] the Bible said God remembered Abraham
[1:18:20] and brought Lot out of Sodom. He didn't
[1:18:22] do it for Lot. He did it for Abraham
[1:18:23] because Abraham loved Lot. Listen, God
[1:18:26] is not unfaithful. He may ask for
[1:18:28] separation. We may separate from family.
[1:18:30] We may separate from friends, but don't
[1:18:32] stop loving them and interceding for
[1:18:34] them because Abraham never stopped
[1:18:36] interceding for them. Your love for them
[1:18:38] may mean their salvation.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; So don't think God is hard-hearted. He's
[1:18:44] not. God's loving and tender and
[1:18:46] merciful. God didn't know Lot anything
[1:18:48] and he didn't know anything to Ishmael.
[1:18:50] But he did it because of Abraham.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So keep loving the ones you love
[1:18:57] and keep interceding for the ones you
[1:18:59] love. Amen.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; God is kind. God is good. God is just.
[1:19:02] But God has a purpose. And his purpose
[1:19:05] is immutable. And his purpose is
[1:19:06] perfect.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; And all things work together for good.
[1:19:10] And we have to believe that. Amen.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God
[1:19:18] had asked
[1:19:21] Moses
[1:19:23] or Abraham, I'm sorry, asked Abraham to
[1:19:26] send Ishmael away. And you think, my how
[1:19:30] how
[1:19:32] much could one person suffer?
[1:19:35] And that's only one side of the equation
[1:19:37] because we're not seeing what God wants
[1:19:40] to do for Abraham.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; All of this is because God wants to
[1:19:45] confirm the promise. God wants to bring
[1:19:46] forth the promise. God wants to manifest
[1:19:49] the promise.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; And he's doing great things through
[1:19:52] Abraham. But it's going to take total
[1:19:54] separation from all unbelief.
[1:19:57] And so he sends him away
[1:20:01] and and let's go to uh now let's go to
[1:20:04] chapter 22. Let's go back where we
[1:20:06] started.
[1:20:08] All of these things happen. He he has to
[1:20:11] separate from his home country and his
[1:20:14] kindred and he goes and then he is
[1:20:17] separate from his father. God takes him
[1:20:18] in death. Then he goes with Lot. Then he
[1:20:21] has to separate from Lot because of the
[1:20:23] circumstances.
[1:20:25] And then circumstances rise in his own
[1:20:27] house between Sarah and between the bond
[1:20:29] woman and between the seed of Sarah and
[1:20:31] the seed of the bond woman. He's mocking
[1:20:33] and her strife. And Sarah's upset. And
[1:20:35] now all the circumstances in his home
[1:20:37] press him into a position. And in the
[1:20:40] press, God confirms to him that send
[1:20:42] Ishmael away. And and and he sends
[1:20:44] Ishmael away. And after all of these
[1:20:47] things, you say, Abraham's done good. We
[1:20:51] come to chapter 22.
[1:20:54] And it came to pass after these things
[1:20:56] that God did tempt Abraham and said unto
[1:20:58] him,"Abraham,"
[1:21:00] and he said, "Behold, here I am. Here I
[1:21:02] am." And he said, "Take now thy son,
[1:21:04] thine own thine only son Isaac, whom
[1:21:07] thou lovest, and get thee into the land
[1:21:09] of Mariah, and offer him therefore a
[1:21:12] burnt offering upon one of the
[1:21:13] mountains, which I will tell thee of."
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:16] He had already separated from his
[1:21:18] father, from Lot, from Ishmael, and now
[1:21:23] Isaac.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; And now Isaac.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; I believe all of that was God's
[1:21:33] training,
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; working with Abraham, bringing and
[1:21:38] developing Abraham, bringing faith in
[1:21:40] Abraham, character in Abraham, a
[1:21:42] willingness in Abraham to obey the word
[1:21:44] of God. Because as Abraham moves on his
[1:21:46] journey, you see the testing gets
[1:21:48] harder, but the obedience becomes more
[1:21:50] deliberate, more instant.
[1:21:53] God is working with Abraham because
[1:21:54] Abraham's the recipient of the promise,
[1:21:55] but God needs him to get to a place of
[1:21:58] total obedience and total surrender so
[1:22:00] that God can perform his word.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; And it says, "Now, I want you to think
[1:22:05] of this. After all that Abraham's been
[1:22:08] through, it looked like a lot, but it
[1:22:10] was all training. And the training all
[1:22:13] came to this point.
[1:22:17] It came to pass after these things.
[1:22:20] God tempted him. Now he said, "Take thy
[1:22:23] son
[1:22:25] Isaac, thy only son Isaac, whom thou
[1:22:27] lovest." It's amazing how the scripture
[1:22:30] added this
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; for emphasis. Whom thou lovest. You
[1:22:34] could just, we could take that as it
[1:22:35] being inferred, but no, God stated it
[1:22:37] clearly. whom thou lovest, and get thee
[1:22:40] into the land of Mariah, and offer him
[1:22:41] therefore a burnt offering upon one of
[1:22:43] the mountains, which I will tell thee
[1:22:44] of. Now look at verse three. It's the
[1:22:47] most astounding verse in all, one of the
[1:22:49] most astounding in all the Bible to me.
[1:22:52] And Abraham rose up early in the morning
[1:22:54] and saddled his ass.
[1:22:57] No conversation, no delay, no questions,
[1:23:02] nothing. Amen.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Not a but God. But every other time it
[1:23:09] was a delay in action. It was but Lot,
[1:23:12] you know, and Lot my this and this and I
[1:23:14] take him along and I can't just leave
[1:23:16] him abandoned. He's an orphan. And and
[1:23:18] then then there's Ishmael, but God that
[1:23:20] Ishmael might live before they know my
[1:23:22] promises with Isaac. I'll do something
[1:23:23] good for Ishmael, but it's Isaac. And
[1:23:25] then the strife comes and Sarah says,
[1:23:26] "Send him away." But God, oh, it grieves
[1:23:29] him terribly. And God says, "Don't be
[1:23:30] grieved because of the lad." Amen. send
[1:23:32] him away. And there's always this back
[1:23:34] and forth. There's always this inward
[1:23:36] struggle. There's always this
[1:23:37] questioning God delay in response, delay
[1:23:39] in action until God finally gets Abraham
[1:23:42] to a place through the training that he
[1:23:44] trained Abraham. Abraham learns to
[1:23:46] respond to the voice of God because
[1:23:48] there's nothing better than responding
[1:23:50] to the voice of God.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what we think. It
[1:23:53] doesn't matter how we feel. We can feel.
[1:23:56] It's good to feel. We can have thoughts.
[1:23:58] That's fine. We have thoughts. Amen. But
[1:24:00] Abraham got to the place of obedience.
[1:24:02] And that's where God wants to get us to
[1:24:04] where we see the word, we say amen to
[1:24:06] the word, regardless of the
[1:24:08] consequences.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; I just can't imagine coming to a place
[1:24:15] where God tells him, "Now, you sent one
[1:24:18] son away. So your your c your your
[1:24:20] cousin's gone. Lot's gone. Your nephew's
[1:24:23] gone. Your dad's gone. Everybody's gone.
[1:24:25] You separated from everything. Now, this
[1:24:27] son that's so dear to you that you love,
[1:24:29] I want you to offer that son to me. And
[1:24:31] he wakes up in the morning with no
[1:24:33] rebuttal, no conversation, no butts,
[1:24:36] nothing.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; And he loads up the car.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Let's go, son.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; God, help me get to this place.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; This is the destination for the bride. I
[1:24:47] believe this with all my heart. Brother
[1:24:49] Bham said, we're following in the
[1:24:50] journey of Abraham. This is where we're
[1:24:53] coming to, friends. Amen.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; And Abraham rose up early in the
[1:24:58] morning, saddled his ass, and took two
[1:25:00] of his young men with him. And Isaac his
[1:25:02] son, and claved the wood for the burnt
[1:25:04] offering, and rose up, and went into the
[1:25:06] place of which God had told him. Then on
[1:25:08] the third day, Abraham lifted up his
[1:25:10] eyes, and saw the place a far off. And
[1:25:13] Abraham said unto his young men, "Abide
[1:25:15] ye here with the ass, and I and the lad
[1:25:17] will go yonder and worship, and come
[1:25:19] again to you." Yeah,
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; we know why he says this because he's
[1:25:23] got faith that God's going to raise him
[1:25:24] up.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; He doesn't know what's going to happen.
[1:25:28] He doesn't know how it's going to
[1:25:29] happen. But he's seen God confirm this
[1:25:32] promise over and over in every way. God
[1:25:34] can't lie. He's immutable in his purpose
[1:25:37] and he's immutable in his oath.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; God said Isaac and he moved everything
[1:25:43] away. I tried it this way. Didn't work.
[1:25:46] Separate all this. But Isaac, it's going
[1:25:48] to be because God said it's going to be
[1:25:50] Isaac. And I don't care if he has to
[1:25:52] raise him from the dead. He's coming
[1:25:54] back. We're going to go and we're going
[1:25:56] to come back. There was in my in my
[1:25:58] opinion, there was no doubt in Abraham's
[1:26:00] mind that he was going to slay his son.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Not a not a doubt, not an inkling of
[1:26:06] doubt. He claved the wood.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; He took the knife.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; He bundled the sticks. He was going to
[1:26:13] slay him and he was going to burn him.
[1:26:16] Amen. But one thing Abraham had come to
[1:26:18] terms with in his life and come to an
[1:26:20] absolute perfect faith and if God said
[1:26:22] it, it will be. And he said, "My seed
[1:26:25] will be in Isaac, and in Isaac will my
[1:26:27] seed be. There's no other option. It's
[1:26:30] going to be Isaac. I don't know how
[1:26:32] God's going to do it. I don't know what
[1:26:33] way he's going to perform it, but
[1:26:35] Isaac's going to live again."
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; And he told him, "We're going to worship
[1:26:41] and come again." Come again. Who? We,
[1:26:44] the we who go, the we who come.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; And Abraham took the wood of the burnt
[1:26:49] offering and laid it upon Isaac his son.
[1:26:52] And he took the fire in his hand and a
[1:26:54] knife, and they went both of them
[1:26:56] together. Friends, this is the point of
[1:26:58] no return.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; He's going all the way with the word,
[1:27:04] trusting in the integrity of the one who
[1:27:06] gave him the promise that he'll keep the
[1:27:08] promise. And he doesn't have to
[1:27:09] understand why God is doing this, why
[1:27:11] God is asking this. He doesn't need to
[1:27:13] have those questions answered. All he
[1:27:15] needs to know is that God promised it
[1:27:18] and he cannot lie.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; And Isaac spoken to Abraham his father.
[1:27:27] He said, "My father."
[1:27:30] And he said, "Here am I, my son." And he
[1:27:33] said, "Behold the fire and the wood, but
[1:27:36] where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
[1:27:39] Now listen carefully, friends. And
[1:27:41] Abraham said, "My son, God will provide
[1:27:45] himself a lamb for a burnt offering."
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; So they went both of them together.
[1:27:53] Who had provided Isaac? God.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Who had promised it'd be Isaac? God. Who
[1:27:59] had to restore Isaac? God.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't know.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; He didn't know what was going to happen.
[1:28:04] He didn't know how it was going to
[1:28:05] happen. He knew one thing. God made the
[1:28:08] promise. So God's going to have to
[1:28:09] provide for himself. Yeah,
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; he's going to provide himself a lamb
[1:28:14] because God said it's going to be Isaac,
[1:28:16] but he told me to slay Isaac. I'm not
[1:28:18] here to figure out which is right and
[1:28:20] which is wrong. I'm only here to obey
[1:28:22] and believe and I don't care how it's
[1:28:24] going to happen. But it's up to God now
[1:28:26] for a son. God's going to have to
[1:28:27] provide himself a lamb
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; for a burnt offering.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's exactly what God did.
[1:28:35] He provided himself in Jesus Christ as
[1:28:38] the lamb for the burnt offering. Why?
[1:28:40] Because of the immutability of his
[1:28:42] purpose that he would have a race of
[1:28:44] himself on this earth and fellowship
[1:28:47] together. Because of that, he provided
[1:28:49] himself a lamb for a burnt offering.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; He had to because his purpose is
[1:28:54] immutable. He has to have his children
[1:28:57] on this earth and fellowship together.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; So what did he do? He provided himself a
[1:29:03] lamb.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; He became Isaac.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't know all of that at this
[1:29:11] point.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; He just knows he's going to obey.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; And they went both of them together.
[1:29:19] Verse 9. And they came to the place
[1:29:20] which God had told him of. And Abraham
[1:29:23] built an altar there and laid the wood
[1:29:24] in order and bound Isaac his son and
[1:29:27] laid him on the altar upon the wood. And
[1:29:29] Abraham stretched forth his hand and
[1:29:31] took the knife to slay his son. And the
[1:29:34] angel of the Lord called unto him out of
[1:29:36] heaven and said,"Abraham, Abraham." And
[1:29:39] he said, "Here am I." And he said, "Lay
[1:29:42] not thy hand upon the lad, neither do
[1:29:44] now neither do thou anything unto him.
[1:29:47] For now I know that thou fearest God,
[1:29:50] seeing that thou hast withheld thy son,
[1:29:52] thine only son from me." Oh, God stops
[1:29:56] him dead in his tracks. Said, "Stop."
[1:29:58] Amen. Stop. Now I know thou fears me.
[1:30:01] And you get in this language. You get in
[1:30:03] this description from God that God is so
[1:30:05] super pleased with this. At no point did
[1:30:08] Abraham back down. At no point did he
[1:30:10] back out. At no point did he come up
[1:30:12] with a compromise. That's what they did
[1:30:14] with Hagar. Amen. That's what he did
[1:30:16] with Lot. That's what he did with his
[1:30:17] dad. But he finally comes to the place
[1:30:19] he's not fixing a workaround. He's not
[1:30:21] compromising. He's not playing with the
[1:30:23] promise or the word of God. He's just
[1:30:25] taking it straight down the middle as it
[1:30:27] was. And this was the hardest
[1:30:28] commandment of them all. Yeah.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; But God had grown him into a position of
[1:30:33] faith through all the experience he's
[1:30:35] had and got him to this place where when
[1:30:37] he said, "Take thy son." He woke up in
[1:30:39] the morning, he packed a car, he took
[1:30:41] his son, and they were off without
[1:30:43] further discussion.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; That's where we're coming to, friends.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Ben makes this statement. The
[1:30:56] comforter said that old Job said this
[1:30:58] time, "Though he slay me, yet I'll trust
[1:31:01] him." He's anchored in the word. He
[1:31:04] knowed what the word said and that was
[1:31:05] his comfort. That was his faith to
[1:31:07] receive him, to hold him. And Abraham
[1:31:09] knew that he was gone. So of his son, he
[1:31:12] was dead. Sarah's wound was dead. His
[1:31:14] manhood was dead. And yet God give him
[1:31:16] this boy because that he promised him
[1:31:18] that. And if the same one that promised
[1:31:20] him that told him to sacrifice the son,
[1:31:23] he knowed that God was able to raise him
[1:31:25] from the dead. Everything he was telling
[1:31:27] me, oh, I'm sorry, this is a different
[1:31:28] quote. He He was able to raise him from
[1:31:31] the dead. This comes from Hebrews. He
[1:31:33] knew that he was able to raise him from
[1:31:34] the dead because he received him from
[1:31:36] the dead. Abraham's life stream dried
[1:31:39] up. He was dead. Sarah's wound was dead.
[1:31:41] It was an impossibility. Everything was
[1:31:43] dead. But he received him as a figure
[1:31:45] from the dead. And if God could do that,
[1:31:48] what's raising a dead? What's raising a
[1:31:50] charred body back to life? Nothing to
[1:31:52] God.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; He could slay him, burn him, and sit
[1:31:55] back and wait for God to raise him up.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Cuz God's word is immutable. His oath is
[1:32:01] immutable. His purpose is immutable.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; If God ever loved you, he always loved
[1:32:07] you. If God thought of you standing in
[1:32:10] flesh, amen, in the millennium in joint
[1:32:12] air with Jesus Christ, nothing's going
[1:32:14] to stop you from getting there. And who
[1:32:16] cares if you get sick here? Who cares if
[1:32:18] you die here? Who cares if you lose your
[1:32:20] wealth here? Who cares if you lose
[1:32:22] everything? That's my promise. And
[1:32:24] nothing will stop it.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; If I wind up, Amen. the only one who
[1:32:29] still believes this message. God, help
[1:32:30] me to hang on to this message because
[1:32:32] it's immutable. It's unmovable. It's the
[1:32:35] word of God. There will be a change of
[1:32:37] the body. There will be a millennial
[1:32:38] reign. There will be glorified sons and
[1:32:40] daughters of God in a millennium with
[1:32:42] him. They will be there. And I believe
[1:32:44] I'll be there. And so what what happens
[1:32:46] to me now? I've got a promise.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; It's immutable. His purpose about me is
[1:32:51] immutable. His oath to me is immutable.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter the circumstances, highs,
[1:32:57] lows, good, bad, success, failure,
[1:33:01] health, sickness. What does it change
[1:33:03] the word of God and the purpose of God?
[1:33:05] Nothing.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; I loved when we were at the retreat.
[1:33:08] Amen. And and and brother Daniel White
[1:33:10] said, he said, "If it's 2,000 years from
[1:33:13] now, somebody will be preaching the
[1:33:15] message.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; We'll still be believing it because it's
[1:33:18] still every word the truth. It doesn't
[1:33:19] matter if it happens the way we think or
[1:33:21] some way we didn't think. If we
[1:33:23] understand or don't understand, I don't
[1:33:25] have to understand. I only have to
[1:33:27] believe." And the immutability of his
[1:33:29] purpose.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; And that's what God revealed through the
[1:33:33] seventh seal. His purpose. One purpose,
[1:33:36] one goal, one thing God wanted to
[1:33:38] achieve.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, God be praised.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; I want to share one quote with you as we
[1:33:49] finish. This is when brother Ben's
[1:33:51] staying at the hospital bed where his
[1:33:53] baby girl is dying.
[1:33:55] Said, "Everything was telling me was the
[1:33:57] truth. Satan was speaking to him.
[1:34:00] Everything that he would say just fall
[1:34:01] right in line. say here I was just then
[1:34:04] about ready to say then that's the way
[1:34:06] he has to act and I won't serve him just
[1:34:08] as I said that there was something came
[1:34:10] from somewhere else way down on the
[1:34:13] inside said who are you to begin with
[1:34:17] the Lord gave and the Lord taken away
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; see that's the inside man don't reason
[1:34:22] at all
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; I looked back and I thought how did I
[1:34:26] get on earth I come from a bunch of
[1:34:28] drunkers how did I get there who gave me
[1:34:30] life who gave Give me that wife who give
[1:34:33] me that baby. Listen, brother Brandham
[1:34:35] is going through the same inward
[1:34:36] conversation that Job went through when
[1:34:38] God came down and spoke to him. He said,
[1:34:40] "Gird up thy loins like a man I'm going
[1:34:41] to talk to you. Who do you think you
[1:34:43] are? Who created the earth? Who are you
[1:34:45] giving counsel to? Who are you giving
[1:34:47] advice to? Who are you going to ask
[1:34:48] questions to, Job?"
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Who are you going to ask if we're doing
[1:34:53] right or wrong? I mean, who set the
[1:34:55] bounds of the heavens? Amen. Who put the
[1:34:57] heavens in place? Who put the earth in
[1:34:58] its place? Who set the bounds of the
[1:35:00] sea? who created all these things? And
[1:35:02] Job, you know what Job said? I spoke
[1:35:04] once, I'll never speak again. I spoke
[1:35:05] twice. I'll put my hand over my mouth
[1:35:07] lest I should speak again.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; He learned who he's talking to. Now,
[1:35:11] brother Benham gets in the same spot.
[1:35:13] And he starts going to the same thing.
[1:35:14] Who am I anyways?
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Who gave me that wife? So, what am I to
[1:35:19] say he was wrong for taking my wife
[1:35:20] away? He gave me the wife. He has every
[1:35:22] right to take her away. Who gave me the
[1:35:24] baby? He gave me the baby. He's got
[1:35:26] every right to take it away. And brother
[1:35:28] Bam starts to come back into the right
[1:35:30] frame of mind.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Where did my wife come from? Where did
[1:35:35] my life come from? I said, "Though he
[1:35:37] slay me, yet I'll trust him." He goes
[1:35:40] right to where Job went.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; I said, "Get away from me, Satan." I
[1:35:46] laid my hand over on the baby. I said,
[1:35:47] "Sharon, honey, I'll lay you on your
[1:35:49] mother's arms in a few minutes when the
[1:35:50] angels of God come to take you away. But
[1:35:53] one day, Daddy will see you again. I
[1:35:55] don't know how it's going to be, honey.
[1:35:57] I can't tell you how when he turns his
[1:35:59] back upon me won't even hear for you. He
[1:36:02] let my wife die. Me holding her by the
[1:36:04] hands crying for her. My daddy in his
[1:36:06] arms died on his arm right there looking
[1:36:08] up at me trying to get his breath. And I
[1:36:10] prayed as hard as I could. How could I
[1:36:12] face the public again to preach divine
[1:36:14] healing?
[1:36:16] How could I preach he was a good God and
[1:36:18] let my daddy die a sinner? How could I
[1:36:20] preach that? I don't know how, but I
[1:36:22] know he's right.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; The word of God shall never fail. It'll
[1:36:26] triumph. No matter what that is, then I
[1:36:28] know there was something inside of all
[1:36:30] reasoning, something inside of all
[1:36:32] emotions, everything else like that.
[1:36:34] There was a inside man that held in that
[1:36:36] hour. Nothing else could have done it.
[1:36:39] Every reason, everything could be
[1:36:40] showed. Everything could prove that I
[1:36:43] was wrong and I was in the wrong. But
[1:36:45] the word of God that was predestinated
[1:36:48] before the foundation of the world held
[1:36:50] on the inside.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad it held on the inside,
[1:36:55] friends.
[1:36:56] I'm so glad God knows where his seed is
[1:36:58] and he knows what's in his seed and he
[1:37:00] knows what his seed is capable of. And
[1:37:02] I'm so glad God is working with us to
[1:37:04] bring that life to the forefront.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; God knows, amen, that that seed will
[1:37:10] keep with the word. He knows it won't
[1:37:11] forsake the word. He knows that word
[1:37:13] that that life inside of us is willing
[1:37:15] to separate. It's the predestinated seed
[1:37:17] word from before the foundation of the
[1:37:19] world. It will come to obedience to the
[1:37:22] word.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:27] When you look at Mary,
[1:37:30] I want to we looked at Abraham's journey
[1:37:32] and we see where he got to in this last
[1:37:35] temptation.
[1:37:38] To me, it was such a strong temptation,
[1:37:40] but where God had brought him to, he
[1:37:42] passed with flying colors.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Every other stage in the journey, there
[1:37:47] was this back and forth, this missteps.
[1:37:49] But when he got to this stage of the
[1:37:51] journey, he come to the place he said,
[1:37:53] "So be it. So be it."
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; That's the way it'll be. He didn't doubt
[1:37:59] the promise. It didn't change what he
[1:38:01] believed about Isaac, but he just did
[1:38:02] what God said.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; You realize when Abraham got to this
[1:38:08] place, there was no external pressure.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; There was no strife between herdsmen.
[1:38:16] Yeah. Right.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; God didn't take his dad away to make it
[1:38:21] easier for him to make the decision.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; God did that in his baby phase. Let's
[1:38:25] say,
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; As he grew now, there was a strife
[1:38:29] between herdsmen that made it expedient
[1:38:32] for separation. God used the
[1:38:33] circumstances to help Abraham along. And
[1:38:37] even when he had to separate from
[1:38:38] Ishmael, Amen. There was strife within
[1:38:40] his home and tension within his home.
[1:38:42] But when he came to this place, there
[1:38:44] was zero external pressure.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; There was nothing pushing him to take
[1:38:51] this action.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; There was nothing demanding he take this
[1:38:55] action. There was nothing. There was
[1:38:57] nothing, no pressure. He was going to
[1:38:59] relieve by taking this action.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; God didn't have to coersse him. God
[1:39:04] didn't have to push him. God didn't have
[1:39:06] to make him uncomfortable. God didn't
[1:39:08] have to do anything. By the time Abraham
[1:39:09] got here, all God had to do was speak
[1:39:12] and be quiet.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; God help us. This is why when you read
[1:39:24] here when when the angel of the Lord
[1:39:25] says,"Abraham, Abraham," he watches
[1:39:28] Abraham. Amen. I don't know what was
[1:39:30] going through God's mind. I don't want
[1:39:32] to I I don't want to falsely portray it,
[1:39:34] but can you imagine? Amen. He's watched
[1:39:36] Abraham. He knows what's in Abraham. He
[1:39:38] knows what Abraham's capable of. He
[1:39:39] knows his immutable promise and and his
[1:39:42] purpose. Amen. He's watching Abraham and
[1:39:44] he's worked with him all these years.
[1:39:45] And finally, he says, "I'm going to test
[1:39:47] Abraham." The Lord tempted.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; The Lord did tempt Abraham. One more
[1:39:52] test, Abraham. I got another test for
[1:39:54] you.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Take thy son, thy only son, the one that
[1:39:57] thy love.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Take him to the place where I tell you,
[1:40:00] and and offer him as a burnt offering.
[1:40:04] and and God's omnipotent. God knows all
[1:40:08] things. So, there's no God waiting. But
[1:40:10] let's just say in the drama, God's
[1:40:11] waiting. I wonder what he'll say this
[1:40:12] time.
[1:40:14] And Abraham doesn't say anything.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Abraham doesn't pray.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Doesn't fast.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Doesn't ask for anything.
[1:40:24] Watches him as he wakes up in the
[1:40:25] morning. He wakes up in the morning.
[1:40:26] What's he doing? What's he doing? He's
[1:40:29] splitting wood.
[1:40:32] Can you imagine God as a father saying,
[1:40:36] "That's my boy."
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; He's splitting. God knows what he's
[1:40:40] going to do. God's not nervous.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Splitting his wood. Look, he's packing
[1:40:46] the car.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Look, he's got wood. Look, he he's Look,
[1:40:50] he's sharpened his knife.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; He believes me.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; He's got confidence in me. He's putting
[1:40:58] his trust fully in me.
[1:41:01] No coercion, no outside circumstances,
[1:41:04] no pressure.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Just obedience to the simple commandment
[1:41:09] of God. Amen.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; He goes all the way through the motions,
[1:41:14] all the way to separation from the
[1:41:15] servants, all the way to Mount Mariah,
[1:41:17] all the way to binding his son, all the
[1:41:20] way to building building an altar,
[1:41:22] laying out the wood, tying up his son,
[1:41:25] laying his son down, unchaththing the
[1:41:27] knife, raising it up. The whole thing is
[1:41:30] proving that he believes God's word. He
[1:41:33] trusts in God. He put all his trust in
[1:41:36] God and none of his trust in himself.
[1:41:38] And just before he plunged a knife into
[1:41:40] his throat or his heart, the angel of
[1:41:41] the Lord says, "Stop. Stop. I can't take
[1:41:44] no more. Now I know you fear God. Now I
[1:41:47] know you're everything I knew you were.
[1:41:49] You just demonstrated what I knew was
[1:41:51] inside of you. What I knew you were
[1:41:53] capable of, what I placed you here for,
[1:41:55] and what I called you for."
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We think we've got troubles. God
[1:42:00] is standing on the sidelines saying,
[1:42:02] "That's my boy. That's my girl." They're
[1:42:04] believing despite the circumstances.
[1:42:06] Look, they're moving forward. They're
[1:42:08] not begging me to change the
[1:42:09] circumstances. They've resolved and
[1:42:11] they're moving on.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, this bride is going to come, amen,
[1:42:16] to the full image of Christ. Amen.
[1:42:18] Christ after he r battled out
[1:42:20] Gethsemane, he walked silently,
[1:42:23] willfully all the way to Calvary. Amen.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; He let him spit on him and mock him and
[1:42:29] accuse him and do all those things and
[1:42:30] never said anything back because he knew
[1:42:32] the immutability of God's purpose and
[1:42:34] the immutability of God's promise.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:40] There was another little lady who didn't
[1:42:43] need any pressure.
[1:42:46] Ruth was under pressure.
[1:42:48] There was a winter coming and there was
[1:42:50] no food. There was starvation. There was
[1:42:52] poverty. She was moved. Tamar was under
[1:42:55] pressure. She was destitute and had no
[1:42:58] no inheritance and nobody to take care
[1:43:00] of her.
[1:43:02] But Mary was fine.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Mary had no trouble.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; We don't think we don't know that she
[1:43:09] was destitute. She had parents. She was
[1:43:11] engaged. She was about to be married.
[1:43:13] She was going to begin her family. She
[1:43:15] had somebody that loved her. Somebody
[1:43:16] that was going to take her. God used no
[1:43:20] external circumstances or pressure to
[1:43:23] get Mary to submit to his word.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; And Mary is a type of the bride.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; The angel came to her when life was
[1:43:34] good.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Came to her when she had no need.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "Mary,
[1:43:42] would you give yourself to me and give
[1:43:44] your life to me
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; and be fulfill the purpose that I have
[1:43:48] for you?"
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; He didn't say those words exactly, but
[1:43:51] they're all implied.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Said, "Behold, thou are highly favored
[1:43:55] of the Lord. God has favored you.
[1:44:00] You're going to conceive in your womb,
[1:44:01] and you're going to bring forth, and
[1:44:02] you're going to do, and you're going to
[1:44:03] do." And she's got a question. How's
[1:44:05] that going to be? I don't know a man.
[1:44:06] And he says, "The Holy Ghost is going to
[1:44:07] overshadow you. thing formed in you. And
[1:44:10] besides this, Elizabeth is pregnant. And
[1:44:12] she just says, "Be it unto me according
[1:44:15] to your word."
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to coersse her. He didn't
[1:44:18] have to set the circumstances around
[1:44:20] her. He didn't have to get her to the
[1:44:21] place where she's going to have to say
[1:44:23] yes or bad things were going to happen.
[1:44:25] She could say no and nothing was going
[1:44:27] to happen perceivably. He didn't get her
[1:44:29] backed into a corner. He didn't get her
[1:44:31] against the Red Sea. He didn't get her
[1:44:33] into starvation. He didn't get her
[1:44:34] anywhere. He come to her when life was
[1:44:37] good and things were going fine and she
[1:44:38] could have just continued on down the
[1:44:40] road the way she was. But she was able
[1:44:43] to say, "Be it unto me according to your
[1:44:46] word. I want to give my life, my flesh,
[1:44:49] my being, my reputation, everything to
[1:44:51] that word."
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Listen, when this message came my way,
[1:44:55] everything was fine. Me and my wife were
[1:44:57] happy. We were early married. We just
[1:44:58] had a baby. Everything was going fine.
[1:45:01] and the word of God come and turn my
[1:45:02] life upside down, caused family
[1:45:04] separation, all kinds of separation,
[1:45:06] caused everything. I mean, all kinds of
[1:45:08] chaos broke out in my life. But I'm here
[1:45:11] now a little down the road from the
[1:45:13] journey. And I say, "Thank God for the
[1:45:15] separation. Thank God for the
[1:45:16] circumstances. Thank God for the
[1:45:18] pressure. Everything was fine until the
[1:45:20] word come and I said yes to the word and
[1:45:22] everything fell apart. Praise God. Let
[1:45:25] it fall apart. The thing I said yes to
[1:45:27] first is the thing I still say yes to.
[1:45:29] Be it unto me according to that word.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; I love this word. I love this message. I
[1:45:35] love this Christ.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; And God shamefully has had to use a lot
[1:45:40] of pressure along the way
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; to get me to pop into his plan.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; But oh, how I want to come to this
[1:45:48] picture
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; where the word of God can say this and I
[1:45:52] say yes. And God can lead me this way
[1:45:56] and I'll say yes, Lord, if that's what
[1:45:57] you want. But how does that work
[1:45:59] compared to I don't know how it works
[1:46:01] compared to anything. All I know is what
[1:46:02] the word says
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; and I'll do it.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not external pressure, not
[1:46:10] circumstances.
[1:46:12] Listen, I don't want to wait for a a
[1:46:15] squeeze and a persecution to get serious
[1:46:17] about God. I want to wake up in the
[1:46:19] morning and seek him early
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; with no pressure.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; You know when prayer gets the best when
[1:46:26] troubles happen. You know when church
[1:46:28] attendance improves? When trouble
[1:46:29] strikes your home.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; I don't want to live like that anymore.
[1:46:34] I want to give him my best. I want to
[1:46:36] serve his word regardless high, low,
[1:46:38] good, bad, anything going on. I want to
[1:46:41] follow the word and obey the word. I
[1:46:44] want to pray because I love him, not
[1:46:45] because I need him to come and rescue
[1:46:47] me. I want to tell him I love him in the
[1:46:49] morning. I want to read his word, not
[1:46:51] because I'm desperate for an answer. I
[1:46:52] want to read his word because I love his
[1:46:54] word, because he's told me to stay in
[1:46:56] his word.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; I want to come to church not because I'm
[1:47:00] going to get some great thing out of it
[1:47:01] or because I I have a great need. I want
[1:47:03] to come to church just because his word
[1:47:05] said come to church.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; I want without external pressure,
[1:47:12] without coercion. I just want to obey
[1:47:15] the word.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; I believe that's what God's growing.
[1:47:18] That's why he's worked with us.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Has he worked with you?
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Like you did Abraham.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Do you see yourself in the story?
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; I see myself in the story.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; I want to leave you with three quick
[1:47:30] scriptures.
[1:47:32] Trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[1:47:34] and lean not into thine own
[1:47:36] understanding. In all thy ways
[1:47:37] acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
[1:47:40] paths.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; No understanding trusting the Lord.
[1:47:45] Amen.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Ye that fear the Lord, this is the same
[1:47:48] word, fear, reverence, and awe. Ye that
[1:47:52] fear the Lord, trust in the Lord.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; If you fear the Lord, trust in the Lord.
[1:47:59] He is their help and their shield. This
[1:48:02] is the last one I'll leave you with.
[1:48:04] They that trust in the Lord shall be as
[1:48:06] mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but
[1:48:09] abideth forever.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; I want that to be me. Amen.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the promise is for you?
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Are you an heir of the promise of
[1:48:20] Abraham? Are you seed of Abraham?
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Is your journey somewhat like Abraham's?
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, may all of our destination be
[1:48:28] Abraham's.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; May with the things God taught us and
[1:48:31] trained us bring us to this place of
[1:48:33] obedience where God can get his purpose
[1:48:36] out of our lives and be so pleased
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; with that purpose.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Can I Can we read one more scripture?
[1:48:43] Amen. Amen.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Are you in Genesis 22 still? I hope so.
[1:48:47] Genesis 22.
[1:48:56] Verse 12 again, 22 and 12. And he said,
[1:48:59] ay not thy hand upon thy lad, neither do
[1:49:01] thou anything unto him. For now I know
[1:49:03] that thou fearthst God, seeing that thou
[1:49:05] hast withheld thy son, thine only son,
[1:49:07] from me. And Abraham lifted up his eyes.
[1:49:10] He saw a ram. He went and and all of
[1:49:13] that. Now, let's go to verse 15. And the
[1:49:15] next thing God says, "And the angel of
[1:49:17] the Lord called unto Abraham out of
[1:49:19] heaven the second time, and said, By
[1:49:22] myself have I sworn, sayaeth the Lord,
[1:49:26] for because thou hast done this thing,
[1:49:27] and hast not withheld thy son, thine
[1:49:29] only son, that in blessing I will bless
[1:49:32] thee, and in multiplying I will multiply
[1:49:35] the thy seed, and as the stars of the
[1:49:37] heaven, and as the sand which is upon
[1:49:39] the seashore, and thy seed shall possess
[1:49:41] the gate of his enemy. and in thy seed
[1:49:43] shall all the nations of the earth be
[1:49:45] blessed because thou hast obeyed my
[1:49:48] voice.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; We are still benefiting from Abraham's
[1:49:54] obedience.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; God just confirmed the promise he
[1:49:58] already made, but he confirmed it with
[1:50:00] such strong language.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; When Abraham got to this level of
[1:50:05] maturity into this place of obedience,
[1:50:07] God reconfirmed what he had already told
[1:50:09] him all the way through. But he
[1:50:11] confirmed it with such joy, with such
[1:50:14] strong language, with such a covenant,
[1:50:16] by swearing by himself.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; He confirmed the covenant.
[1:50:23] What is it that pleases God?
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, only faith
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; pleases God.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; But faith is in believing something. And
[1:50:33] the action of faith is to do what we
[1:50:35] believe.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when Abraham by faith moved,
[1:50:39] God was pleased.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; And I want my faith. Amen. To please
[1:50:45] God.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Man, let's all stand together.
[1:50:47] Musicians, if you'll come. And Blake, if
[1:50:49] you'll come.
[1:50:51] Amen. I love that little Bible study on
[1:50:54] Abraham.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Now, tomorrow, if something happens and
[1:51:00] pressure comes and we have to move to
[1:51:02] the word, Amen. and you have to make a
[1:51:04] choice or separation or some difficulty,
[1:51:06] just say, "Praise God. God's training me
[1:51:08] like he did Abraham."
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; God's teaching me that only obedience to
[1:51:13] his word is the only thing that'll work
[1:51:15] because word God's word can't fail. And
[1:51:18] his promise to me is sure. I can't lose.
[1:51:21] I can't be defeated. I can't miss out
[1:51:23] because of the immutability of his
[1:51:26] counsel.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; No matter what happens, friends, we
[1:51:30] can't lose. That's right.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what we see or what we
[1:51:33] feel. What matters is what he promised.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; We must stay with that. When when
[1:51:40] Abraham woke up in the morning and
[1:51:41] loaded the car and loaded it up and got
[1:51:43] Isaac, he felt, I'm sure, a lot of
[1:51:45] things. Amen. But one thing he knew for
[1:51:47] sure, God's word can't fail.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; And I believe God's word can't fail.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Lord
[1:51:54] Jesus, we thank you. Thank you so much
[1:51:57] for a sure word. There's been a sure
[1:52:00] word of prophecy that we've received and
[1:52:02] you've opened up the veil of your word
[1:52:04] and you've showed us who you are and
[1:52:06] what your purpose is, but you've also
[1:52:08] revealed to us who we are. And God, in
[1:52:11] all of that, Lord, you've been training
[1:52:13] us and teaching us and working with us
[1:52:15] like you did Abraham.
[1:52:17] You brought him to a point in life where
[1:52:20] he could fully surrender to your will,
[1:52:23] where he could lay it all down and he
[1:52:24] could give up all reasoning and all
[1:52:27] emotions. He had to give up emotion. He
[1:52:30] had to give up reasoning. He had to lay
[1:52:32] it all aside to follow your word.
[1:52:35] And God, we believe you're growing us in
[1:52:37] the same way. And God, may you help us
[1:52:40] to get to the place, like your prophet
[1:52:42] said, standing by the bedside of a dying
[1:52:44] baby. He said, I found there was
[1:52:46] something inside of emotions, something
[1:52:49] deeper than reasonings, and that was a
[1:52:52] seed of faith that you planted there.
[1:52:55] God, may we learn to rely on that faith
[1:52:58] in your word, Lord, and that picture
[1:53:00] you've painted for us of who we are and
[1:53:01] your purpose in our lives. And may that
[1:53:04] become the ultimate truth that guides
[1:53:06] us, Lord. May our faith in that give us
[1:53:08] the ability to weather every storm, to
[1:53:11] cross every sea, to go through every
[1:53:13] obstacle. May it hold us in every trial
[1:53:17] because nothing that you said in your
[1:53:19] promise can change. Lord, bless your
[1:53:22] people. Help us to grow into your
[1:53:24] likeness, into a perfect faith, into a
[1:53:28] place, Lord, where we don't need to
[1:53:29] reason. We don't need to feel. We just
[1:53:32] see according to your word and we obey.
[1:53:36] God, I pray that you would move on
[1:53:37] everyone that's here. If there's anyone,
[1:53:40] Lord, that's miserable because of a
[1:53:42] half-hearted commitment.
[1:53:44] God, would you get them out of their
[1:53:45] misery? Would you encourage them, Lord,
[1:53:49] through circumstances, through the word
[1:53:51] to move out of a half-hearted commitment
[1:53:54] and move into a full surrender
[1:53:57] to move out of one foot in, one foot out
[1:54:01] partial belief that they would move into
[1:54:03] a full commitment and a surrender to
[1:54:05] your word for this hour. May they give
[1:54:08] up reasonings, give up thoughts, give up
[1:54:10] emotions, and jump in with all their
[1:54:13] being into the revelation of the hour.
[1:54:16] And may they find you faithful and them
[1:54:18] able to put their confidence in you. For
[1:54:21] you're the high priest. You're the
[1:54:24] intercessor. You're the kinsman
[1:54:26] redeemer. You're the judge. And God, we
[1:54:29] can lay ourselves at your feet trusting
[1:54:32] in you. we can give ourselves to you
[1:54:34] wholly trusting in you, God. If there's
[1:54:38] anyone here that's not fully trusted in
[1:54:40] you yet,
[1:54:42] may they not stay on the edge, but they
[1:54:45] may they come all the way to the
[1:54:46] threshing floor and lay at your feet.
[1:54:50] May they stop playing church and moving
[1:54:53] around the edges of truth, but may they
[1:54:55] fully commit themselves to your word,
[1:54:59] God. May they find you faithful and able
[1:55:01] to redeem and to uphold and to judge
[1:55:03] righteous.
[1:55:05] May they find you able to keep your word
[1:55:07] and keep your promises and keep your
[1:55:09] covenants. May they put their trust holy
[1:55:12] in you and commit all the way. Draw them
[1:55:15] in. Bring them according to your word
[1:55:17] and according to the seed in their life.
[1:55:19] Bring them all the way to the full
[1:55:21] commitment to where there's no more
[1:55:22] misery. There's only life and life
[1:55:25] abundantly.
[1:55:26] But I pray that you'd seek them out and
[1:55:28] find them. Give them courage. And for
[1:55:32] the rest of us, would you continue to
[1:55:33] teach us and work with us, Lord,
[1:55:35] forgiving us, Lord, of our failures and
[1:55:37] where we m make mistakes and where we're
[1:55:39] blind. Would you continue to draw us
[1:55:42] nearer to you and work with us along the
[1:55:44] way and train us and teach us until we
[1:55:47] can come to a place of perfect faith?
[1:55:50] Help me Lord I pray commit myself to you
[1:55:53] and I commit this congregation to you
[1:55:56] and this service to you. May it have a
[1:55:58] long effect in our lives Lord as your
[1:56:01] word unfolds within us. We ask your
[1:56:03] blessings over all these things in Jesus
[1:56:06] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:56:16] Oh, how I long to be in love with you.
[1:56:23] Till all the world just fades
[1:56:26] from
[1:56:28] you. A deep calling to the deep.
[1:56:33] Hurrying inside
[1:56:36] is my heart's cry.
[1:56:42] to have the word made manifest
[1:56:47] in me.
[1:56:49] Living pure and holy
[1:56:53] unto thee. This longing in my heart.
[1:56:59] Only you can sine.
[1:57:08] Oh, how I long to be in love with you
[1:57:15] till all the world is f
[1:57:19] from you.
[1:57:22] Calling to the king
[1:57:26] inside
[1:57:28] is my heart.
[1:57:34] To have the word made
[1:57:39] in me,
[1:57:41] living pure and holy
[1:57:44] unto thee. this longing in my heart that
[1:57:51] only you can satisfy
[1:57:56] once more.
[1:58:00] How I long to be in love with you till
[1:58:07] all the world just fades
[1:58:10] from you. My deep calling to the deep
[1:58:17] Burning inside
[1:58:20] is my heart's cry.
[1:58:26] To have the word made
[1:58:31] in me,
[1:58:33] living pure and holy
[1:58:36] unto
[1:58:38] thee. This longing in my heart.
[1:58:43] Only you can satisfy
[1:58:52] pleasing.
[1:58:57] Let me be pleasing
[1:59:02] to you.
[1:59:05] Let everything
[1:59:08] I do
[1:59:12] be pleasing
[1:59:15] to you.
[1:59:19] Praying.
[1:59:24] and everything
[1:59:27] I pursue
[1:59:31] be pleasing,
[1:59:35] oh Lord,
[1:59:37] unto
[1:59:38] you,
[1:59:45] pleasing.
[1:59:50] Let me be pleasing
[1:59:54] to you.
[1:59:58] Let everything
[2:00:01] I do
[2:00:04] be pleasing
[2:00:07] to you.
[2:00:11] Praise
[2:00:23] Be pleasing,
[2:00:27] oh Lord,
[2:00:29] unto
[2:00:30] you once more.
[2:00:35] Oh, pleasing.
[2:00:42] Let me be pleasing
[2:00:46] to you.
[2:00:49] Let everything
[2:00:52] I do
[2:00:56] be pleasing
[2:00:59] to you.
[2:01:02] Praise.
[2:01:08] And everything
[2:01:10] I pursue
[2:01:15] leading,
[2:01:18] oh Lord,
[2:01:20] my
[2:01:27] all that I am,
[2:01:33] all that
[2:01:35] I am,
[2:01:38] All I shall ever
[2:01:44] be.
[2:01:49] It cannot
[2:01:51] repay
[2:01:54] the love that I know.
[2:01:59] I
[2:02:01] surrender
[2:02:04] to thee.
[2:02:10] All that I am.
[2:02:15] All that I am,
[2:02:21] all I shall live.
[2:02:31] It cannot
[2:02:34] repay
[2:02:36] the love that I hold.
[2:02:42] I
[2:02:44] surrender
[2:02:47] to thee.
[2:02:52] I stand in awe within the presence of
[2:02:58] the Lord.
[2:03:01] In whom the wisdom of the ages
[2:03:06] come.
[2:03:09] Whom the raging of the sea
[2:03:13] subsides,
[2:03:16] the living sacrifice,
[2:03:20] the only source
[2:03:22] of life.
[2:03:25] Our Lord
[2:03:27] is in the Lord.
[2:03:32] This time on
[2:03:35] and ever more.
[2:03:38] Oh my hope
[2:03:42] is in the Lord
[2:03:46] forever more.
[2:03:51] His
[2:03:54] tender mercies come with every rising
[2:03:59] sun
[2:04:01] to meet the sinner in his brokenness
[2:04:08] to offer healing and forgiveness.
[2:04:16] And those who trust in him will find
[2:04:20] their hearts
[2:04:22] at rest. My faith.
[2:04:25] Oh, my faith is in the Lord.
[2:04:31] This time on
[2:04:34] and ever more.
[2:04:38] My faith
[2:04:41] is in the Lord
[2:04:44] forever more.
[2:04:51] I stand in awe within the presence of
[2:04:59] who the wisdom of the ages.
[2:05:06] Whom the raging of the sea
[2:05:10] subides.
[2:05:13] Living sacrifice.
