[0:00] the fful ministry is here to
[0:03] stabilize the
[0:05] church so every new thought that comes
[0:08] in doesn't send us
[0:11] running every new teaching every new
[0:15] idea amen we the ministry is here to
[0:18] bring a stabilization amen the ministry
[0:21] shouldn't be the ones bringing
[0:25] instability they should bringing us a
[0:27] stability Amen to where now every thing
[0:30] that sweeps through it doesn't it
[0:32] doesn't scatter it doesn't cause us to
[0:33] run it doesn't cause us to get tossed to
[0:35] and fro amen we're already stabilized we
[0:37] already know who we are in Christ we
[0:39] already know that we have been chosen by
[0:41] God and God is revealing himself to us
[0:44] and every new thing that comes down it
[0:46] may be a direct Revelation from God it
[0:48] may be another wind of Doctrine that's
[0:50] moving through amen but I don't have to
[0:52] be shaken if it's God who reveal it to
[0:55] me because I'm stable in who I am I am
[0:58] his bride he will reveal the truth to me
[1:01] I don't need tossed around like a child
[1:04] because of every new teaching that comes
[1:06] I can hold steady amen what's going to
[1:08] Help Me Hold Steady this is the purpose
[1:10] of the five-fold ministry so you have a
[1:12] true identification of who you are
[1:13] coming into a maturity so you don't get
[1:16] knocked around every time something new
[1:17] sweeps through because something new may
[1:19] be absolutely genuine from God another
[1:22] level he wants to take us through it
[1:24] could be another mixed idea of man amen
[1:26] and we don't know we could get tossed
[1:28] and Scattered and run about and arguing
[1:30] and fighting with who's right and who's
[1:32] wrong what we need to do is be stable
[1:34] and not be like children and Hold Steady
[1:36] if it's of God it'll ring true it'll
[1:38] ring true it'll ring true it'll stay
[1:40] it'll grow and it won't change amen but
[1:43] I don't need to worry about it if half
[1:45] my brother see it and I don't see it
[1:47] that shouldn't change my identification
[1:50] with who I am I need to wait till God
[1:52] shows me
[1:54] amen way I don't need to pretend I see
[1:57] something I don't
[1:58] see that means I don't need to go with
[2:01] the crowd because this is the more
[2:03] spiritual
[2:06] crowd I don't need to give up my my my
[2:10] own discernment amen because this is a
[2:12] more senior brother amen no I'm not
[2:15] getting tossed by every wind of Doctrine
[2:16] a true fold ministry will establish the
[2:18] bride so they're not getting tossed
[2:20] about they're not immature they've come
[2:22] into a place where they know who they
[2:24] are and when something new comes they
[2:26] can say praise the Lord if this is from
[2:28] God it'll ring true let's just wait I
[2:30] don't see it yet but let's just
[2:33] watch tell you something else that it'll
[2:36] do amen they'll just watch until they
[2:39] see the nature of that
[2:42] thing sounds good it sounds
[2:46] good but what life is it
[2:50] producing what's the nature of that
[2:53] thing I'm not getting tossed about by
[2:56] everything that sounds good but behind
[2:58] it comes an arrogant spirit and behind
[3:00] it becomes a nasty attitude and behind
[3:02] it becomes
[3:05] division no I think I'll just wait
[3:08] because I'm not going to lose my
[3:12] sunship I'm not going to lose my
[3:14] position with Christ I'm not rejecting
[3:16] the word I'm just not jumping
[3:21] in
[3:23] amen the ministry should be making the
[3:26] Believers
[3:27] stable mature
