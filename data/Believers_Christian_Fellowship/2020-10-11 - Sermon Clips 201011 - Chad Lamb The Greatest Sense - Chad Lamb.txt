TRANSCRIPT
========================================
why do you believe you were predestinated to believe the ingredient was placed inside of you why do you have eyes to see and ears to hear because you've got another set of eyes that can see the father's face you've got another set of ears that can hear the father's voice it's more than what you've got in your physical makeup there's more to you than meets the eye why is it when you see that cloud amen you see the bridegroom when you see the cloud you see your invisible union others see the physicals others hear what the prophet said others can pass the test but to you it's more than a cloud it's your lover it's your bridegroom it's your mate it's the invisible union it's him here receiving you it's the fullness of the word it's the headship uniting with you the body why because there's an angel who's beholding the father's face that can hear what's going on in the throne room and it's connected to you through the soul somehow i don't know how but it's there that's why there's things that you just know to be the truth prove it i can't prove it but it's the truth why is it the truth why was that little samaritan woman who was on her sixth husband coming to the well living a bad life a dirty life amen why was it she was hungering and thirsting for god why was it she wanted to know the proper place of worship why was it when she met a man that could tell her about her husband's she didn't say can you show me where to get a good job and can you tell me where i lost my money nope she says sir i perceive that you're a prophet the elders say worship here and you say worship there where can i worship god where did that come from that wasn't anything in the natural part of that woman that was something from the sea down on the inside and brother banham said she could receive his word because she had representation in heaven because their their angels always behold the father's face why is it you can believe why is it you can see because you got more eyes than the ones that are in your head and you have more ears than the ones that are attached to the side of your head you've got eyes and ears that can access the throne room of god how does it work i can't tell you how all i can tell you is it works because the sixth sense in me knows it's the truth knows it works knows it's real i i've experienced it i've seen it i've stood on the word i was given something that i didn't have in myself an understanding i couldn't understand a willpower i didn't have an overcoming deliverance that wasn't coming from the flesh there was something coming from the sixth sense something more than what was happening in this flesh and it's a living reality to me how do you know it i know it prove it just wait just wait and he will prove it by changing my atoms
