[0:00] we always talk about sister ahati right
[0:04] we always say she say the right thing
[0:08] but sometimes we don't talk about before
[0:12] she said the right thing what was going
[0:15] on in your life for example
[0:18] we can see that the church was a
[0:21] building they're building a new place
[0:24] they they want to build a new building
[0:26] if i can say that and then since i had
[0:29] ride took five uh she took
[0:32] uh fifty dollars to give
[0:36] for the building and the deacons all the
[0:40] trustees say no no sister you cannot do
[0:42] that
[0:43] this is six months of your salary how
[0:45] can we do this
[0:46] she he she forced she ended up
[0:50] giving twenty dollars it's still a lot
[0:52] like
[0:53] two months of her salary she gave it for
[0:56] the building and
[0:57] and when brother brown heard it he had
[1:00] money in his
[1:00] pocket he want to give her back that
[1:04] money
[1:06] and when he tried to give to her god
[1:09] said
[1:09] don't you do that
[1:13] but that night he said the right thing
[1:16] amen oh we don't talk about that he was
[1:20] real that's sincerity
[1:25] god is moved but that that
[1:28] real life god is moved by it
[1:31] yes amen but when we do things in the
[1:35] group
[1:38] how can you obtain favor by just
[1:41] following the group i'm not saying
[1:42] following what the other people do is
[1:45] necessarily wrong
[1:46] but usually we find that is we taking
[1:50] other people's spirit on ourself
[1:56] instead of the holy ghost we taking
[1:58] other people's spirits
[2:00] on ourself and we don't have favors with
[2:03] god
[2:04] i found that every many things that we
[2:08] hear by the problem third pool this
[2:11] happened that's happened before that
[2:14] happened it is always
[2:15] something and when you watch it it's
[2:18] people being more real in the devotion
[2:22] passionate about god then god does it
