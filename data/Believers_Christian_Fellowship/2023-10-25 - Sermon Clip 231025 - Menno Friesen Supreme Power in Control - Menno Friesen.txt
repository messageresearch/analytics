TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you know when you have Fellowship sometimes you read certain things said oh said you know like that little boy said Mama that's me that's how I feel so many times when I'm reading said oh that's me he talking about yes sir I identify myself right there in the word this message is me that's right we've had all kinds of confusions all kinds of people rising up and and challenging the message I tell you what I've challenged myself too I believe the message I'm challenging myself every day Lord not just believe in it but it manifests itself in my life the walking word The Living Word the reality of God in every manner the worshiper once Pur has no more desire of sin that's where I look at myself now I look one thing well I might get a lot of mistakes but I have no desire for unbelief and sin in my life no sir no more conscious in the Old Testament of course the worshiper offered and he goes back a little bit let me take a little time with that and he he went back and but what the Old Testament we know what happened under the blood of bulls and gos they were sorry for their sins they knew they're Sinners went and made the thing right offered came back with the same desire but it's not so with the blood of Jesus Christ once baptized into that Kingdom once filled with the Holy Ghost you walk away your desire for sin is gone you don't want to disbelieve the word of God the only sin that really is unbelief in the word drinking smoking gambling the prophet said adultery so that's not sin that's attributes of unbelief so if you if you're born of the spirit of God I don't mean to hurt anybody but if you're born of the spirit of God those things are dead in your life so well I'm still tempted yes as long as you're in this body you will be that doesn't mean you're not a Christian being tempted right that just means you're a part of the Overcomer we're talking about Overcomers here people that's overcome all the Creeds and the dogmas that tries to attach itself to the word that's right there's a lot lot of denominational Spirits trying to attach thems to this word and use the power of God to verify their Vindication that's listen we're not interested in that we're interested in one thing Lord you said it and I believe it whether even I understand it or not how many could have how which one of us could say I understand God it's impossible as long as we're in this finite body how can the finite identify it with the infinite you know he's it's so beyond us but something drops way down said but by faith Noah by faith Abraham by Faith by Revelation every one the Church of Jesus Christ is built all the way through she is the revelation of Jesus Christ
