[17:00] the word of the lord in the book of john
[17:04] and wishing you all for my heart god's
[17:06] blessings
[17:07] and uh
[17:09] john chapter 18 verse 28
[17:11] that is the
[17:13] uh the scenery is
[17:15] jesus
[17:16] right before pilate
[17:20] and here we see a a a a a tragedy and we
[17:23] see some kind like a drama verse 28
[17:26] eight sorry
[17:28] then let the jesus from caithus unto the
[17:31] hall of judgment
[17:33] and it was early
[17:35] and they themselves went not into the
[17:38] judgment hall that is a critical point
[17:40] the jews
[17:41] lest they should be defiled
[17:43] but that they might eat the passover
[17:46] pilate then went out unto them and said
[17:48] what accusation bringing you against
[17:50] this man they answered and said unto him
[17:54] if he were not a manufacturer we would
[17:56] not have delivered him unto thee
[17:58] then said pilate unto them take you him
[18:01] and judge him according to your law
[18:03] the jews therefore said unto him it's
[18:05] not lawful for us to put any man to
[18:08] death
[18:09] that the saying of jesus might be
[18:11] fulfilled which he spake signifying what
[18:14] death he should die
[18:15] then pilate entered into the judgment
[18:18] judgment hall again and called jesus
[18:22] and said unto him art thou the king of
[18:24] the jews
[18:25] jesus answered him
[18:27] say thou this thing out of thyself or
[18:30] did others tell thee of me
[18:32] pilate answered am i a jew thy own
[18:35] nation and the chief priests have
[18:37] delivered thee unto me what hast thou
[18:39] done jesus answered
[18:41] my kingdom is not of this world
[18:43] if my kingdom were of this world
[18:46] then would my servants fight that i
[18:48] should not be delivered to the jews
[18:51] but now is my kingdom not from hands
[18:54] pilate therefore said unto him art thou
[18:56] are killing them
[18:58] jesus answered thou sayeth that i am a
[19:01] king
[19:02] to this end was by born and for this
[19:04] cause came i into the world that i
[19:07] should bear witness unto the truth
[19:09] everyone that's of the truth here is my
[19:11] voice
[19:13] pilates
[19:14] said unto him what is truth
[19:16] and when he said this he went out again
[19:20] unto the jews and said unto them
[19:23] i find no thought at all
[19:25] may the lord add his blessing to the
[19:26] reading of his word we may be seated
[19:30] now i greet you all in the house of the
[19:32] lord for this evening and
[19:34] it's a great honor for me
[19:36] to be here and so our brother from
[19:38] michigan is here
[19:40] we have time a little bit to fellowship
[19:41] after church but before the preparation
[19:44] i think you know how it is then you're
[19:45] concentrating on the word of the lord
[19:48] and i just want to say it's a great
[19:49] honor it's a great pleasure pleasure and
[19:51] privilege for me to be
[19:53] among you
[19:54] and uh to really have these kind of
[19:56] meetings and we were greatly blessed
[19:58] already this morning and uh
[20:00] really
[20:01] wonderful uh
[20:02] the way how it is expressed and and you
[20:06] see everybody is his original we cannot
[20:08] copy one another
[20:09] we are originals ourselves god wants us
[20:12] to be that way
[20:13] god have different flowers in the garden
[20:15] and we must be ourselves
[20:18] and that is the best way how we can be
[20:19] and and
[20:21] uh blessed be the name of the lord and
[20:23] uh just wonderful thought was very very
[20:25] truly blessed this morning
[20:27] and so um we wish our brother well and
[20:30] wishing god's blessing for tomorrow
[20:32] morning service
[20:33] now i will continue and especially the
[20:35] end of the service of this morning i
[20:37] thought it would be matching perfectly
[20:39] in the thoughts that i was preparing
[20:42] for these meetings
[20:44] and
[20:45] it really fits it seems that we have the
[20:47] same father
[20:48] same inspiration
[20:50] somehow it works together huh
[20:52] and uh yes i i i would i would like to
[20:55] make a drama and i would like to
[20:58] for you to relax and sit down
[21:02] listen especially to the first part
[21:04] because there are some things that
[21:06] can be controversial or it can be touchy
[21:09] but it's not touchy at all but it thinks
[21:10] reality
[21:12] that we are
[21:13] have to deal with and
[21:15] we will deal with it one of the aspects
[21:18] in
[21:19] the third poll is we recognized our own
[21:23] nature
[21:24] we recognized from where we came
[21:27] the opening of the word was not just
[21:28] some information about luther about
[21:30] wesley but the seals was taken away from
[21:33] around us
[21:35] and it needed the opening of the word
[21:37] and so we understand
[21:38] once we understand who we are we
[21:40] understand our actions and we understand
[21:43] others
[21:44] and we are faced in the future with with
[21:48] with difficult and complex situations
[21:51] and sometimes we try to handle them with
[21:54] methods from the last century
[21:57] but it will not work we need the methods
[21:59] of today
[22:00] because it's a new challenge
[22:02] and when the enemy and the enemy
[22:04] comes in like a flood then the lord will
[22:07] raise up a standard against it
[22:10] so the challenge of today needs the
[22:13] answer of today
[22:15] exactly so if not we will be defeated
[22:18] and in that question i would like to to
[22:20] title that subject for this evening
[22:23] spiritual relationship between god and
[22:26] man
[22:28] and we see clearly
[22:31] in this scripture that we are reading
[22:34] that jesus is brought before
[22:37] pilate
[22:39] if you read that scripture again you
[22:41] will see we have two sceneries
[22:44] one is in the hall
[22:46] and one is outside
[22:48] because the bible always said um
[22:51] therefore he went out to the jews
[22:54] the jews that did not went did not went
[22:56] in into the hall
[22:58] so we have two sceneries the same person
[23:01] but we have a communication which is
[23:03] outside to the jews
[23:05] and we have a communication between him
[23:07] and pilate
[23:09] so outside of the jews out there where
[23:12] the jews were it was shouting it was
[23:14] just accusation it was just it was just
[23:17] slow guns
[23:18] it was just uh
[23:20] it was not an intense debate
[23:23] jesus couldn't even say something they
[23:24] had made their mind up they had they had
[23:28] already their their conclusion they were
[23:30] just shouting crucify him
[23:32] but here in that hall is quite a
[23:36] discussion going on
[23:38] something
[23:39] in that little room
[23:41] something that is now between two men
[23:45] pilate
[23:47] he knew how to deal with
[23:49] noble people
[23:50] with kings with
[23:52] uh
[23:53] pilate took care of that part of
[23:56] palestine
[23:58] he knew how to deal with this and
[24:00] you could feel pilate
[24:02] he could not
[24:03] bring it to the point but he felt this
[24:06] man is special
[24:08] i mean he could feel it
[24:11] he could not bring it because he didn't
[24:12] know jewish doctrine but he could sense
[24:15] this man is different
[24:17] so he now starts a conversation and you
[24:20] have to see that jesus he was he was
[24:22] completely bound
[24:23] uh and here comes pilate
[24:26] and he asked him
[24:28] are you a king
[24:30] and jesus answer questions back
[24:33] i mean this is pure rhetoric
[24:36] amen you ask a question you answer give
[24:38] the question back
[24:40] um did you tell it by yourself but in
[24:42] other words do you have revelation who
[24:44] you are
[24:46] or did somebody tell you where
[24:49] a man
[24:50] so so the more he is questioning back
[24:53] the more pilots get insecure
[24:57] because in that little
[24:59] situation you find out jesus is the one
[25:02] who's bound he's ready for crucification
[25:04] but it's him the master of the situation
[25:09] it's not pilates leading jesus was jesus
[25:13] now leading him
[25:16] once you know who you are you take every
[25:18] spirit under your control
[25:21] and spirit taking spirit under your
[25:22] control means you understand if you
[25:24] cannot change anything you have to wait
[25:26] until god changes it
[25:29] faith in god means patience to until god
[25:34] facing god is not is not
[25:36] it's not a little child stamping on the
[25:38] with his foot on the ground until god
[25:40] has to do something god has to do
[25:42] nothing
[25:44] i mean we're not children we're not
[25:46] toddlers we're not uh have you ever
[25:48] little seen seen a little child that
[25:51] that he's in a supermarket and he wants
[25:53] to have some chewing gums and the
[25:54] parents and no no chewing gum and he
[25:56] just throws himself on the on on the
[25:59] face and just i want i want you know
[26:03] the church is not like this
[26:05] we're not like this this is pentecostal
[26:07] babies
[26:09] no we have grown a little bit into a
[26:10] maturity
[26:12] knowing my father knows best
[26:14] sometimes god's no is better than our
[26:17] yes
[26:19] once we understand who we are and that
[26:20] our father cares we can take things how
[26:23] they come
[26:25] that's so important because jesus
[26:27] now he was asked a question and he goes
[26:30] back and forth and backs it and in the
[26:31] meantime
[26:33] pilate's wife come and say look i had a
[26:34] dream about that man he's a just man you
[26:36] better have nothing to do with him
[26:38] so the more evidence has come the more
[26:41] pilot now understand i'm in a real bad
[26:43] situation right now
[26:46] i want to release this man but once i
[26:48] release him and that's the problem of
[26:50] politics
[26:52] therefore be always a free man of god
[26:56] amen you don't have to stand before your
[26:58] brother you have to stand before god for
[26:59] your fault be a free man of god because
[27:02] here is pilate and again and he goes out
[27:06] and there is just shouting and crying
[27:08] and this is
[27:10] and he comes back and he speaks to him
[27:12] again
[27:13] so we have two two setups
[27:16] and it comes to the point that
[27:18] he asked him a question
[27:20] are you a king
[27:22] and the thing is this
[27:24] we are americans i i just say we okay
[27:27] let me let me be an american for some
[27:29] time okay
[27:30] let me give give me a green card for two
[27:33] hours okay
[27:34] okay let us be americans okay because
[27:37] you are americans are germans anyhow
[27:40] what are you french english what are no
[27:44] what is your doctrine brother marcus no
[27:46] taxation without representation that
[27:49] okay
[27:50] i'm in
[27:54] but we are americans
[27:56] and even this church sometimes people
[27:58] just say
[27:59] the law
[28:00] has nothing to do in the church
[28:03] no we are still on american grounds
[28:05] do you understand this all our finances
[28:08] are controlled by the estate and it's
[28:10] good to be that way
[28:12] we have to be under law we have to be
[28:14] americans if we have a problem here we
[28:17] call the american police
[28:19] if somebody has a heart attack we call
[28:21] american doctor
[28:22] so we are part of the society don't
[28:24] forget this
[28:25] we are not in heaven yet we're in
[28:27] america
[28:28] but our kingdom is not here
[28:31] at the same time we have a
[28:32] representation up in the other dimension
[28:35] so if you become mature you learn to
[28:37] live in both worlds
[28:39] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[28:42] because you have your manage you have to
[28:43] manage your life here
[28:45] if not you have to go on an island
[28:48] at the same time you have to understand
[28:50] you're not belonging to america
[28:52] you come from another country and you
[28:53] will go back to that same country
[28:55] can you say amen so he asked him the
[28:58] question
[28:59] are you a king he says yes
[29:01] but this is not my country here
[29:04] my country doesn't belong to this earth
[29:06] i come from another country
[29:08] and i hope i can talk this evening to a
[29:10] bride who says i don't belong here i
[29:13] come from another kingdom
[29:15] i'm just a pilgrim
[29:17] i'm a just just a representative on this
[29:20] earth can you say amen
[29:23] so we see
[29:24] a case
[29:26] and therefore i said
[29:28] would you will you open it brother
[29:30] franco
[29:32] is that fine yeah
[29:34] therefore i said i'm i'm i'm i'm not
[29:37] sad if you don't tell too much aim
[29:38] eamonn especially in the beginning
[29:42] this is a little girl
[29:43] who
[29:46] they you can find them on youtube
[29:49] as i'm dealing a lot with people who
[29:51] left the message and who left
[29:53] the church who left christianity
[29:56] i have i heard sometimes
[29:59] brother marcus we were in a sect
[30:02] so here we have on youtube especially
[30:05] people who come out of uh organizations
[30:08] like the jehovah witness
[30:09] or the
[30:11] hormones for an example
[30:13] and these people explain
[30:16] why they left
[30:19] it's heartbreaking
[30:20] because for all of them it's very very
[30:22] difficult because the church became a
[30:23] family for them
[30:25] but the pressure became so big
[30:28] that they couldn't stand it anymore
[30:31] now we have a big responsibility i'm a
[30:34] minister in this message i'm a just
[30:36] small a small hillbilly that nobody
[30:39] knows i know this i'm aware of this or
[30:41] some people know me
[30:43] but we have a responsibility to lead the
[30:46] people in the right direction
[30:48] and the question of us is do we want to
[30:50] make a cult
[30:51] or do we want to grow in christ
[30:55] do we want to have a health
[30:56] healthy growth or do we just want to be
[30:59] church members
[31:00] of some idea
[31:02] so some of these young people when they
[31:05] when they came the the the the the
[31:07] subject or the the nature of a of a sect
[31:12] is you can do whatever you want but you
[31:14] cannot ask questions
[31:17] they don't like questions
[31:18] and we have to understand we have a
[31:21] message which is waterproof
[31:25] we cannot fear questions
[31:28] in fact we must allow our young people
[31:30] to ask
[31:32] to be critically
[31:34] or to be skeptically
[31:36] because if the law cherries they would
[31:38] take the batoon
[31:40] and you can only stand for something
[31:42] that you fully grasp
[31:44] the young generation cannot live by
[31:46] slogans
[31:48] they must get the vision
[31:50] catch that vision
[31:52] we must allow them to ask
[31:54] once we are afraid of this it means we
[31:56] are not sure about ourselves
[31:58] if you're sure ask
[32:00] if i cannot answer please i cannot
[32:02] answer yet
[32:04] what happens and i make some the service
[32:06] that i have i was preaching different
[32:08] times already is sometimes young people
[32:11] have questions about strange ideas
[32:14] that comes up
[32:16] um i just take it from the world
[32:19] we have now a new
[32:21] thought
[32:22] which goes about uh which says about the
[32:24] what they call the flat
[32:26] earth so i'm not interested i know
[32:29] there's some questions some some some
[32:30] quotes of brother brandon about this
[32:32] about that and people say
[32:34] brother marcus what do you think about
[32:35] this what we think about that i always
[32:37] say look i don't have time for these
[32:39] things
[32:40] i will never my major on a minor
[32:43] i'm we preach about the gospel we preach
[32:45] about things that change our life and
[32:47] the flat earth will never change my life
[32:50] we think about things with substance
[32:52] essential things but it's there and the
[32:55] question of the flat earth
[32:57] is not a it's not a message problem it
[32:59] is a problem worldwide
[33:01] since a couple of years outside of this
[33:03] message there's conventions in america
[33:05] about the thought the earth is flat
[33:07] right fine
[33:08] okay that can be like this i'm i
[33:12] couldn't say but uh
[33:14] these people
[33:15] completely unbelievers they were asked
[33:17] the question
[33:19] and look why it's so dangerous and why
[33:21] we need the mind of christ like the
[33:24] sister was singing
[33:25] they asked the question they would ask
[33:27] the question
[33:28] yes
[33:29] look we have a lot of astronomers went
[33:32] up
[33:33] americans
[33:35] you know
[33:36] baldwin and how the
[33:38] armstrong and we had russians
[33:41] all of them looked out of the window and
[33:43] all of them said the earth is a globe
[33:47] what are you doing about that and these
[33:49] people
[33:50] they say honestly all these astronomers
[33:53] are
[33:54] or astronauts they were all lying
[33:57] they were lying so the russians were
[33:59] lying like the americans
[34:01] so in other words they said nobody flew
[34:04] up until now i said okay
[34:08] that means we have what you i think you
[34:10] call it the nasa
[34:12] nasa is not correct over there in
[34:13] houston that means we have thousands of
[34:15] people working for the nasa
[34:18] and in the morning it is said to these
[34:19] people look uh
[34:21] you don't exist
[34:24] you get your pay bill you do as if we
[34:26] are working here
[34:28] but when you come home
[34:29] [Music]
[34:30] we had we were working on a rocket but
[34:32] we don't exist in reality
[34:35] that means it has nothing to do with the
[34:37] message of the hour but once you follow
[34:40] conspiracy theories
[34:43] you see the world through that
[34:46] glass and then what you see is the world
[34:51] and is the center of the world and all
[34:53] the rest are lying
[34:55] once you enter in this you will never
[34:58] have a true perspective about things
[35:02] therefore we need the mind of god
[35:04] therefore you have three sources of
[35:06] information one is the news and you can
[35:08] be skeptical
[35:10] second is conspiracy theories and there
[35:12] you should be skeptical
[35:14] and the third one is the open word
[35:18] it comes from the throne of god
[35:20] can you can you say amen
[35:22] it's a it it it's a mindset
[35:25] of seeing the world as somebody wants
[35:28] you to see it but we have the mind of
[35:31] christ
[35:33] and we're thankful for a message
[35:35] which shows the balance in all things
[35:38] then what is always the same for these
[35:41] kind of groups
[35:42] they claim for eternal destination and
[35:45] we heard yesterday
[35:46] extra ecclesia la salus means outside
[35:50] the church there is no salvation
[35:53] now brother branham explained to us
[35:55] outside of christ
[35:57] there is no salvation
[35:59] that's a big difference
[36:01] because they claim eternal destination
[36:04] to their group
[36:06] because when they say
[36:07] outside of the church there's no
[36:09] salvation that means outside of our
[36:11] church
[36:13] you so you're binding people to a system
[36:17] to a building
[36:18] to a doctrine to a ministry and this
[36:21] message to came
[36:23] to
[36:24] set us free from all those things
[36:26] so we are so we are respecting everyone
[36:29] but we are family of god
[36:32] therefore all these groups they think in
[36:34] in in local church terms we think in a
[36:38] family coming from this from the
[36:40] foundation of the world
[36:42] can you say amen
[36:43] so what happens is this
[36:45] is
[36:47] they put up a setup as if the church is
[36:49] the family
[36:52] and there's a truth behind that
[36:54] but you will see once you leave the
[36:57] church you will see how your family
[36:59] works
[37:00] because people will let you down
[37:02] um and and sometimes it's ridiculous
[37:05] that for example you are in a group
[37:07] and all these young people that said
[37:09] these things in the moment when we were
[37:11] questioning them the moment we were not
[37:13] any more accepted you know
[37:15] we could have come with all kind of
[37:17] immoral problems they would have said uh
[37:20] no problem the blood of jesus christ has
[37:21] a way but no questions about authorities
[37:25] so and it makes it dangerous because
[37:28] these young people say we were raised up
[37:30] in the mormon church
[37:32] we went to sunday school all our friends
[37:35] are there all our our our our family is
[37:38] there we went to youth camps we loved it
[37:41] but once we had the question we were out
[37:44] and the third was this you are in such a
[37:45] group and people say ah
[37:48] you are an eagle right we come from the
[37:50] foundation of the world we were always
[37:52] together and you are theophany here and
[37:54] mighty of an idiot and once you leave
[37:56] the same people would say okay they left
[37:58] us because they were never part of us
[38:01] once after years they come back and
[38:03] people say people would say oh wonderful
[38:06] my brother who was always a brother
[38:08] before the foundation of the world i
[38:10] mean i mean who wants to believe that
[38:12] who wants to believe that that is
[38:14] cultish
[38:15] if somebody is a brother is a brother
[38:18] maybe he doesn't know who he is he's in
[38:20] complete spiritual amnesia but he's a
[38:22] brother
[38:23] he's a sister jesus sister so what
[38:25] happens is these young people observe us
[38:29] and they have a right to do they must do
[38:31] because we have nothing to hide
[38:33] there's nothing to hide
[38:35] and i remember that that i was asking
[38:37] brother lonnie many many years ago it
[38:39] was some clash in a church
[38:42] and i asked him when we were younger we
[38:44] were more militant about certain things
[38:46] today we're trying to find solutions you
[38:48] know before we were more
[38:50] we were not yet mature
[38:52] and he said something i never forgot and
[38:54] i said brother mark brother lonnie what
[38:56] is about this ministry
[38:58] he said brother marcus look a
[39:00] a minister especially a pastor he makes
[39:02] a lot of decisions
[39:04] he says
[39:06] in all his life hundred of his decisions
[39:08] will be very very important
[39:11] with repercussions
[39:14] 100 of all his decision will be very
[39:16] important he will find out later that
[39:19] ten of the of his hundred decisions were
[39:22] wrong
[39:23] they were not sin but they were wrong
[39:25] completely wrong
[39:26] exactly why should i reject a man who
[39:29] make made 90 good decisions
[39:31] if he just made 10 big mistakes
[39:34] exactly
[39:35] so we do these things
[39:37] and the faster we see them
[39:40] the faster we we we acknowledge it the
[39:42] faster we brings it back
[39:44] on track
[39:46] the faster we are back on our own track
[39:49] so it's so important but there is a
[39:51] generation that is watching us
[39:53] as i said i was on a minister's meeting
[39:55] in in north carolina you see a minister
[39:58] making a mistake and you see the other
[40:00] ministers just shunning the men
[40:02] once i understand the man is a good man
[40:04] of god
[40:05] he's my brother he's a good ministry
[40:08] if he does a big mistake
[40:10] then my duty is to be with him
[40:13] not to avoid him
[40:15] i mean because i'm not like kane who
[40:18] says uh uh uh uh am am i am i the
[40:22] shepherd of my own brother
[40:24] no we are
[40:26] family of god
[40:28] and family of god shows itself
[40:31] when when things go wrong
[40:34] when mistakes are making then the family
[40:36] of god shows their quality the rest is
[40:39] just
[40:40] you are accepted as long as you are
[40:42] fitting in our system
[40:44] amen these young people were suffering a
[40:46] lot among this so as i said on the
[40:49] minister's meeting sometime even in the
[40:51] message of the hour
[40:52] we we come into problems and then we
[40:55] live what we call cold war
[40:58] we isolate and we ignore it's just the
[41:01] expression that we don't know who we are
[41:03] we cannot handle that situation that's
[41:05] the problem therefore we make cold war
[41:08] you are there i'm here but family of god
[41:10] must have
[41:12] feeling for one another
[41:14] you cannot live in eternal cold war
[41:16] because what do you do in the rapture
[41:19] well you're saying the reps okay cold
[41:20] war is over
[41:22] we must grow into a statue that we can
[41:25] handle situations
[41:27] that you know who you are and you know
[41:28] who's your brother your sister
[41:31] exactly so so sometimes we make some
[41:34] some some turns and we are we are we are
[41:36] observed
[41:38] by a generation who wants not only to
[41:40] see if we can preach
[41:41] because preaching is a gift but can we
[41:44] solve problems
[41:46] it takes more than good preaching this
[41:48] takes the holy spirit
[41:49] in his time
[41:51] so in all these groups they are creating
[41:53] images
[41:55] i always say this they sing uh it's so
[41:58] i'm so glad being part of the family of
[42:02] god but once a person has a problem he's
[42:04] not anymore part of that family
[42:07] it these songs
[42:09] have a value when you're down
[42:11] not when everything is working perfect
[42:13] but when we make big mistakes then the
[42:16] family of god shows who they are
[42:18] exactly so i was a couple of weeks ago
[42:21] in peru there was a split of a church
[42:23] it's a long story and they told me
[42:25] brother marcus you're the only minister
[42:26] coming to this place we asked different
[42:28] when they don't want to come because
[42:29] they know if they enter in that problem
[42:31] they are part of
[42:33] they will be made responsible for their
[42:35] problem
[42:36] they it seems that they that that that
[42:39] they are
[42:40] afraid of their reputation i think
[42:41] that's wonderful
[42:42] nothing to lose i have no
[42:45] i have no name i've know nothing so we
[42:46] jump into the problem because problems
[42:48] need solutions
[42:50] and god will will bring more complex
[42:53] problems in our life
[42:55] not to not to chasing us but to prove us
[42:59] the holy spirit is more than good
[43:00] pitching preaching not more than i love
[43:02] the message i love this i love god
[43:04] brings situations where we can see where
[43:06] we are and how we handle situations can
[43:09] you say amen
[43:11] that means
[43:12] we are we are facing
[43:14] problems a brother said to me
[43:16] the minister
[43:18] he said brother marcus i have five
[43:20] children in reality i have four the
[43:22] fifth one is a homosexual it's not my
[43:24] child
[43:25] i said certainly we're against
[43:26] homosexuality that's sure
[43:28] but it's still your child
[43:30] because he has a soul
[43:32] and you stand before god and god placed
[43:34] that church that that child in your
[43:36] family
[43:37] sometimes we think is is just kick him
[43:40] out is the solution kicking up puts him
[43:42] out of our sight
[43:44] but there's no solution
[43:46] i think if there is a solution we must
[43:48] have a solution
[43:49] can you say amen i said no no you have
[43:51] five children one is homosexual
[43:54] amen not only those who function
[43:56] perfectly perfect are our children
[43:58] they're all our children
[44:00] and they need an intercessor
[44:03] they need many situations in this
[44:04] message need a man who is standing in
[44:07] the gap
[44:08] standing in the gap
[44:10] knowing that the situation has no
[44:12] solution but jesus is the way
[44:14] can you say amen
[44:16] it takes more
[44:18] than than than just doctrine
[44:21] therefore
[44:22] we we see these things
[44:24] pure in
[44:26] therefore we have to pay attention what
[44:28] they say
[44:29] is we were indoctrinated we were
[44:31] influenced
[44:34] i will not make the same parallel but
[44:36] you know what the jesuit's saying what
[44:38] what hitler said
[44:40] and what they call the hitler use they
[44:42] said give me a child for five years
[44:46] we will mold them for the rest of their
[44:47] lives
[44:49] so we have to pay attention not to
[44:51] indoctrinate
[44:52] so they become ambassadors of our
[44:54] doctrine
[44:56] of our standard uh we are this and we
[44:59] are that brother we are responsible that
[45:01] these youngsters find christ
[45:04] not just to be
[45:06] so they said we were we were quite
[45:08] indoctrinated
[45:10] i give
[45:10] i give an example we cannot radicalize
[45:13] them
[45:14] there's a nice song that we have in the
[45:15] message of the hour it says push play
[45:18] and obey
[45:21] i i accept anyone who doesn't accept
[45:23] ministers okay somebody says i believe
[45:26] just in tapes i say god bless you that's
[45:28] fine go on i said i believe in tapes
[45:30] plus ministry
[45:32] amen where's the problem if you believe
[45:33] just in this god bless you i respect you
[45:35] please respect me too
[45:37] but if a youngster sings
[45:39] uh
[45:40] i say my own words if they tell us any
[45:42] lies
[45:43] we just push play on the oblate obey we
[45:46] have to it has to be identified as a
[45:49] propaganda song
[45:51] this is not a song for the love about
[45:53] the love of christ
[45:55] about what jesus means to me
[45:58] this is pure propaganda this is
[46:00] indoctrinating the children already for
[46:03] an idea that i have
[46:05] it can happen more easy than we think
[46:08] that's it be the name therefore the
[46:10] message that we believe
[46:12] is not a denomination
[46:14] but we have denominational spirits in it
[46:18] the message that we believe is not a
[46:20] cult
[46:21] but something we have cultish elements
[46:24] and it takes
[46:26] a good balance to take people into the
[46:29] right direction
[46:31] we should never radicalize them
[46:33] or are are
[46:35] bring some kind like an in in in
[46:38] introduct indoctrination um
[46:42] brother branham preaches a message
[46:45] he says he says taking sides with jesus
[46:50] that means not taking sides for marcus
[46:52] becker
[46:53] taking side
[46:55] taking side for jesus
[46:57] not taking side are you for this group
[47:00] are you against this truth we take side
[47:02] with jesus
[47:03] so we see god in this group and in this
[47:05] group and we we see a family
[47:08] can you say amen
[47:10] that's so important here we have the
[47:12] next picture
[47:14] that shows
[47:15] um
[47:16] this is a picture which was done by the
[47:20] um by the holiness movement it's
[47:22] shalotta
[47:23] from germany i think it was 1870
[47:26] it is called the broad way and the
[47:29] narrow way
[47:31] and the situation was very very clear
[47:33] there's two ways in life and
[47:35] we accept this from the bible and there
[47:39] is two ways either you're on this way
[47:41] and on that way there's
[47:42] only two choices this way or that way
[47:45] okay
[47:47] so
[47:49] we believe we are all on the narrow way
[47:52] but we have to understand some of our
[47:53] youngsters they go to broadway
[47:56] and the message of the hour showed us
[47:58] that somebody can be predestinated seed
[48:00] and being long on the broad way
[48:04] we see even the family of brother
[48:06] branham i mean his own son seeing the
[48:07] angel of the lord and needed his time
[48:11] and we see how brother brahma had that
[48:13] sovereignty of waiting until god calls
[48:16] him back
[48:17] if we believe
[48:19] that god calls people we can rest
[48:22] somebody leaves us never never throw
[48:24] dirt
[48:25] throw blessings
[48:27] yes but and what throw blessings
[48:30] amen never throw dirt because this will
[48:33] hinder him to come back easier
[48:35] these youngsters who go in the things of
[48:38] the world they need an intercessor they
[48:40] need an ester
[48:42] they need for somebody standing in the
[48:44] gap and says maybe they don't know who
[48:47] they are but i know who they are
[48:50] that is the way how god dealt with us
[48:53] when we were in the world god said
[48:55] alright that's my boy
[48:57] blessed be the name of the lord you see
[48:59] therefore we are not a cult we are
[49:01] church of the living god
[49:03] if we are church of the living god let
[49:05] us live like this
[49:06] let us act like this let us put all
[49:09] cultish nonsense away
[49:11] we have a message
[49:13] coming from the presence of our father
[49:15] blessed be the name of the lord so we
[49:17] have these two these two lines and
[49:20] imagine what happens
[49:22] is if a boy or girl leaves the message
[49:24] of the hour in between of or leaves the
[49:27] church in between of a very short time
[49:29] becomes completely worldly
[49:32] i mean we have a young girl in our in
[49:35] our little village coming with blue hair
[49:38] blue hair
[49:40] and one of the older sister was so
[49:41] shocked blue hair blue hair i said yes i
[49:44] mean
[49:45] she's a sinner therefore she she wears
[49:47] things like a sinner what do you want
[49:50] i mean she's just expressing what is
[49:53] she needs christ
[49:55] who who do you think will give her
[49:56] christ you
[49:58] do you think that the catholic church
[50:00] will have an answer for that girl
[50:02] or or any kind of occultism or whatever
[50:05] you're the answer for that girl
[50:06] so if you don't give a hand nobody can
[50:08] give in because you're the christ for
[50:10] your area but but sometimes
[50:13] we fear that i understand that that that
[50:16] that that uh that we're fearing there's
[50:19] an influence coming upon us if we but i
[50:21] mean don't we know who we are
[50:24] i understand we have some young people
[50:26] and here's what the bible says and i
[50:28] understand this because what happened
[50:30] is this when you leave a cult
[50:35] when you leave a cult
[50:40] it says if there if there come any unto
[50:42] that second john and bring not destruct
[50:45] him doctrine receive him not unto your
[50:47] house neither beat him god speed
[50:50] amen
[50:51] don't greet
[50:52] him this is biblical
[50:56] but you have to make it fit for the
[50:57] things of this world if somebody comes
[50:59] with a doctrine and he is telling let me
[51:02] talk about against the message of the
[51:04] hour you have to stop him
[51:06] just
[51:07] not here
[51:09] not here
[51:10] talk
[51:11] to your dentist
[51:13] talk to your dentist
[51:17] if you have a possibility yeah
[51:20] i had my the uncle of my my wife was a
[51:22] thing he was an unbeliever he always
[51:24] tried to evangelize me when i was and i
[51:26] was ah and they said yeah you know about
[51:28] this girlfriend
[51:32] but not here
[51:34] but you understand these youngsters said
[51:36] the moment we left the church if you are
[51:39] a jehovah witness
[51:40] and you leave the church you are not
[51:42] allowed anymore to see your family
[51:46] the moment's the same you're not allowed
[51:48] anymore if you will not see your
[51:50] grandchildren you will not see your
[51:51] children that is the spirit of fear to
[51:55] keep them in some kind like a group
[51:57] brother god beware
[51:59] that we ever enter in such a thinking
[52:02] because these ones if you know who you
[52:04] are you can give a hand to somebody who
[52:06] fell down
[52:08] brother brahm said these pharisees that
[52:10] would would never go into that stable in
[52:12] jerusalem
[52:13] because it was too much stinking
[52:16] they
[52:16] would look at that so god had to call
[52:20] shepherds
[52:22] sometimes i think we
[52:24] we have to pay attention not to become
[52:26] pharisees by saying oh i cannot deal
[52:28] with that
[52:29] no no
[52:30] no hey
[52:32] sinner needs a hand
[52:35] standing in the gap somebody who said
[52:38] brother you are stinking
[52:40] but you're my brother
[52:42] sister you're stinking but i see
[52:45] something more than your stinking body i
[52:47] see an element of god
[52:50] if somebody once loved god i believe
[52:53] there's some speck of life still in them
[52:56] they don't want to know
[52:57] and they don't want to accept something
[52:59] they are in complete amnesia but you are
[53:02] not an amazing amnesia
[53:04] i give you an example therefore what is
[53:06] hurting people who are leaving
[53:08] christianity is they walk on the street
[53:10] and here you have a precious sister or a
[53:12] precious brother and he sees somebody
[53:14] was formerly in the in the sunday school
[53:16] and now he comes as a sinner he walks as
[53:19] a sinner and here and here comes the
[53:20] precious sister
[53:26] you understand this hurts the feeling
[53:29] because they say for many many years i
[53:31] was precious so-and-so precious sister
[53:33] so and now i'm nothing
[53:37] i mean if somebody is your brother your
[53:39] sister he stays your brother and your
[53:41] sister
[53:42] keep him as your brother your sister in
[53:44] your heart you might disagree a hundred
[53:46] miles
[53:48] but if you're keeping up in your heart
[53:49] you will always have a feeling for that
[53:51] person
[53:52] i'll give you an example
[53:53] now now
[53:55] look for example the jehovah witness
[53:57] and it's tragic but we have to see these
[54:00] things you will be confronted if there
[54:02] is another generation you will be
[54:04] confronted as us
[54:06] in some cases that people say we were in
[54:08] a sect and you have to have an answer
[54:11] and then we have to say look maybe you
[54:12] maybe that was your impression maybe we
[54:14] did things
[54:16] a little bit out of balance maybe you're
[54:17] right maybe you're not right maybe it's
[54:19] just your excuse for your worldly living
[54:21] we have to see
[54:22] but there is a case that i heard
[54:25] about abuse child abuse over there and
[54:28] that one of these girls gave her
[54:30] testimony you see
[54:32] so she is abused by her sunday school
[54:34] teacher he's an older man she's just a
[54:37] young girl
[54:39] so she goes to the elders he said here
[54:41] he abused me with words
[54:43] with deets with uh
[54:46] whatever happened there
[54:48] and they say okay
[54:49] the bible says they have their
[54:53] handbook how to react on situation and
[54:56] you cannot bring accusation against an
[54:59] eldest
[55:00] if
[55:02] without two or three witnesses
[55:04] that's the bible
[55:06] but
[55:07] you will never have a child abused with
[55:09] two or three witnesses
[55:12] no will never work because if it's in
[55:14] the church these people know how to
[55:16] react easily
[55:17] they know how to they know how to
[55:19] maneuver these things that there is no
[55:21] witness
[55:22] okay so we have to update these things
[55:25] for our time
[55:27] so what happened this was
[55:29] given in the bible to to to protect the
[55:32] ministry
[55:33] but we have to protect the young
[55:34] children the same way today different
[55:36] it's another age it's a sexual age an
[55:38] immoral age so what happens is they said
[55:41] the girl says now i come before some
[55:44] kind like a tribunal
[55:46] ten eldest no woman i'm the only woman
[55:49] now i have to give all details what
[55:51] happens i have to tell the whole story
[55:54] intimidated just by 10 older brothers
[55:57] they are the eldest in the local church
[55:59] and here comes the brother who is the
[56:01] offender he is he he's the
[56:03] he does these things
[56:05] and you just have to say no
[56:07] this is a lie so
[56:09] and they asked the girl do you have
[56:11] witnesses no so
[56:15] case is settled
[56:17] and then that girl said this and they
[56:19] came to me and i said you cannot talk to
[56:22] nobody about this because you put blame
[56:24] and shame on the name of jehovah
[56:30] and so she had to carry that burden
[56:31] first
[56:32] if we do this do you understand that
[56:35] then we protect the church protects the
[56:38] offender
[56:40] but the church has to protect the victim
[56:43] do you understand that and somebody
[56:45] leaves they don't leave because of the
[56:46] doctrine because they understand have no
[56:48] protection
[56:50] they are so religious that they don't
[56:51] understand their case bring it in our
[56:53] life
[56:54] can you say amen
[56:56] so so there's a lot of things
[56:58] these these kind of thoughts come from
[57:00] calvinism
[57:02] calvinism he come is a is a further form
[57:05] from reformation
[57:08] and
[57:09] calvin was a man who was very strict
[57:12] and he wanted to establish his
[57:16] the city of geneva to be a pure city
[57:20] if you want or not
[57:22] but you have to understand
[57:25] if if you want to force holiness on
[57:28] people
[57:29] they become religious but not free
[57:32] you cannot reform an unbeliever
[57:36] you have first they need a new birth and
[57:39] then let's start with that kind of
[57:41] change in their life if not they become
[57:43] miserable message believers
[57:47] i mean calvin uh his the calvinistic
[57:51] doctrine i have a presentation but i
[57:53] will go in another subject today is this
[57:56] we are predestinated
[57:58] and we are predestinated to have success
[58:02] with god and for god
[58:04] the calvinistic idea
[58:07] was the
[58:08] base
[58:09] for the success of capitalism
[58:12] because
[58:13] calvinists know two things in their life
[58:17] praying and working
[58:20] there's no other thing going to holidays
[58:23] is already sin
[58:25] it's wasting god's time
[58:27] so you pray
[58:29] there's two there's two situations in
[58:31] life you're in church or you are
[58:33] at work
[58:35] the rest is wasting god's time so they
[58:37] become wealthy healthy
[58:39] pure
[58:41] precious
[58:42] uh
[58:43] if you're working 12 12 hours per day
[58:45] that's fine
[58:47] but it has it has nothing to do with the
[58:49] gospel
[58:51] therefore you see it became
[58:53] successful
[58:55] so that all protestant countries became
[58:57] rich
[58:59] amen and
[59:00] there's a there's a book about it the
[59:03] the the the basis of protestantism is or
[59:06] the basis of capitalism is protestantism
[59:09] because their mindset was if we have
[59:11] success god is pleasing we're pleasing
[59:14] god
[59:15] and we invest that money back
[59:18] all catholic countries are poor
[59:20] countries
[59:22] i mean even america is founded by the
[59:24] pilgrim fathers they were coming out of
[59:27] calvinism
[59:28] pure holiness movement
[59:30] you know
[59:31] holy
[59:32] uh how do you say
[59:34] liking to work
[59:36] no idle time
[59:38] disciplined
[59:39] all these things but that it has nothing
[59:42] to do with gospel
[59:43] gospel is heart and soul gospel is
[59:46] relationship to god
[59:48] i mean therefore brother branham picks
[59:51] it up
[59:52] and the calvinism and his strictness
[59:55] he speaks about sardis and he said he
[59:57] was nothing else than angry men
[59:59] worshiping god
[1:00:01] he said now let me read it out of the
[1:00:03] greek listen how it reads therefore
[1:00:06] leaving the principles of the doctrines
[1:00:08] of christ the atoned one we should push
[1:00:11] towards now i can read it he's reading
[1:00:14] hebrews chapter four i think it's
[1:00:16] brought out
[1:00:17] and not laying again the form here we
[1:00:20] are
[1:00:21] not laying again the form of reformation
[1:00:23] from the works causing death
[1:00:27] now this is lexicon it's absolutely not
[1:00:29] an interpretation at all it's just a
[1:00:32] greek word for what the english says and
[1:00:33] it says no we don't want to listen here
[1:00:37] not laying down foundations of
[1:00:39] reformations from works
[1:00:41] causing death now i will get it in your
[1:00:43] mind that's what i'm speaking here forms
[1:00:45] of reformation
[1:00:47] causing death paul said leaving the
[1:00:49] principles going to perfection third
[1:00:52] pull
[1:00:52] not laying again the foundation of
[1:00:54] repentance from that works faith towards
[1:00:57] god doctrines of baptism laying on our
[1:01:00] hands resurrection of the dead eternal
[1:01:02] judgment reformation causing death was
[1:01:05] the right word that's actually what paul
[1:01:07] wrote see what he's trying to do
[1:01:10] now brother brandon warns us
[1:01:12] there is a religion that looks good
[1:01:15] but it's dead
[1:01:18] therefore sardis was the time of the
[1:01:21] reformation and brother ramsey said it
[1:01:23] you have the name of the bible say that
[1:01:25] you live but you're dead
[1:01:28] amen
[1:01:29] you can have all these things
[1:01:32] but the most important thing that we
[1:01:34] have relationship with god
[1:01:37] can you say amen
[1:01:39] i mean
[1:01:40] therefore the things that i was that i
[1:01:42] was you make next one please that i was
[1:01:45] preaching until now
[1:01:48] do you see
[1:01:50] the claim for eternal destination these
[1:01:52] strange ideas the young people creating
[1:01:54] an image pure influence indoctrination
[1:01:58] is not a relationship between god and
[1:02:00] the man it's just a group
[1:02:04] listen sometimes people our group and
[1:02:06] our group
[1:02:08] and our church is is the best of the
[1:02:10] world and who do you want to talk about
[1:02:12] who's your father god
[1:02:15] or do we speak about another group
[1:02:17] can you say amen and our organization
[1:02:20] that we have we are we are sober we have
[1:02:22] a thousand people in this message
[1:02:25] um it's your organization your father i
[1:02:27] feel sorry for you
[1:02:29] we preach about heavenly things
[1:02:31] and then we preach about another another
[1:02:33] thing that we are here on earth but we
[1:02:35] have a heavenly family we are part of it
[1:02:37] can you say amen
[1:02:39] therefore you see sometimes people
[1:02:41] become ambassadors of a doctrine
[1:02:45] i have to
[1:02:46] to come to bcf to really let them know
[1:02:48] what the true word is
[1:02:51] you can sometimes see you are on a
[1:02:52] convention you see when people say amen
[1:02:54] or not i mean this is now only bcf but
[1:02:57] how they play around
[1:02:58] and you say for example i want to say
[1:03:01] one thing the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:04] is a
[1:03:05] definite experience
[1:03:12] and then he says but at the same time
[1:03:15] you receive the holy ghost without
[1:03:16] sensation amen wonderful amen
[1:03:19] and people think they can now applause
[1:03:22] to a preacher
[1:03:24] so that their opinion now is winning the
[1:03:27] the contest
[1:03:28] but we are too long on the way about
[1:03:30] this
[1:03:31] don't be an ambassador for a doctrine
[1:03:35] be an ambassador of christ
[1:03:37] give your brother give a hand if you
[1:03:39] even if you think he's wrong but if he
[1:03:41] loves the message who will now decide
[1:03:43] when the voice comes to brother branham
[1:03:46] all that you loved
[1:03:48] and all that you loved you will be there
[1:03:50] who is now deciding who is in or out
[1:03:53] who's the one who wants to decide
[1:03:55] amen
[1:03:57] amen keep these people as the family of
[1:03:59] god said i'm not agreeing but hey
[1:04:01] he let my heart be in the right tune for
[1:04:04] you
[1:04:05] if not you will make a circle where at
[1:04:07] the end only you yourself be the rest
[1:04:09] the only one
[1:04:10] amen and your children they come out of
[1:04:12] a sect you can be in a healthy church
[1:04:14] but your family is in a sect
[1:04:17] never compare families my children and
[1:04:19] your children in my yeah because of my
[1:04:21] forget these things
[1:04:23] amen we're individuals before god
[1:04:26] and brother we do our best to serve the
[1:04:28] lord
[1:04:29] and if you see if you feel sorry for
[1:04:31] your brother marcus just pray for him
[1:04:34] amen just saying mention brother mark is
[1:04:36] a nice boy good boy not nice boy by the
[1:04:38] good boy
[1:04:39] i mean he gets a haircut from jeremy so
[1:04:41] he's a little bit handsome
[1:04:43] in in that way
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:46] so here we go
[1:04:48] the family of god this was one part and
[1:04:50] now
[1:04:50] now do you understand why we are
[1:04:53] preaching what we are preaching the
[1:04:55] opening of the word the third pull
[1:04:58] your identification
[1:05:00] amen therefore you need
[1:05:02] if we don't grow in the world
[1:05:05] sooner or later we fall into any kind of
[1:05:08] a doctrine
[1:05:09] so there is no stand still in the
[1:05:11] message of the hour you have to go
[1:05:14] forward
[1:05:15] if not you will come into
[1:05:17] denominationalism
[1:05:19] with the picture of brother branham at
[1:05:21] the wall
[1:05:22] and we think we are better because we
[1:05:24] know more brother
[1:05:26] it never worked until now it will not in
[1:05:28] the future
[1:05:29] or we are better because we have more
[1:05:31] miracles he said then better go to benny
[1:05:33] hinders than most
[1:05:34] miracles we are better because we are
[1:05:37] have a father
[1:05:39] can you say amen
[1:05:41] so here we have
[1:05:42] uh a precious man by the name of
[1:05:44] constantine and we go now in the
[1:05:46] positive side
[1:05:48] constantine he was one of these
[1:05:51] caesars one of these rulers
[1:05:53] over there in rome and rome was divided
[1:05:55] into two parts
[1:05:57] so human nature never likes an opponent
[1:06:02] therefore that's what i said
[1:06:04] many people in this message cannot
[1:06:06] handle opposition
[1:06:09] and god gives us opposition he wants to
[1:06:11] sh
[1:06:12] he wants to draw out of us what's in us
[1:06:15] many people cannot so they enter into a
[1:06:17] cold war but cold war is not the answer
[1:06:20] man exactly so and you say okay
[1:06:22] everything is said we will we will put
[1:06:24] brother so-so out we will never invite
[1:06:26] him uh we will put the family out the
[1:06:27] problem is finished god sends another
[1:06:29] problem
[1:06:30] because he wants to train us
[1:06:33] amen exactly so
[1:06:35] so here he we have the human nature of
[1:06:38] two opponents
[1:06:40] and constantine says look in this saloon
[1:06:42] is no room for two
[1:06:46] make a shootout
[1:06:47] okay billy the kid against the daltons
[1:06:50] okay here's here's a shootout billy the
[1:06:53] kid and the dolphins we were now
[1:06:54] tombstone we are back in tombstone
[1:06:56] because here is now some great fight
[1:06:59] between two roman emperors
[1:07:03] god is thinking in his mind that
[1:07:05] christianity will take over now for the
[1:07:07] next two thousand years the middle of
[1:07:08] europe
[1:07:10] and
[1:07:11] he is inspiring constantine constantine
[1:07:14] was a pure
[1:07:15] heathen
[1:07:17] he was not a christian
[1:07:19] he was a deal maker
[1:07:21] you make a deal tremendous tremendous
[1:07:23] deal
[1:07:25] so when he was going into that battle
[1:07:31] he he the night before or the day before
[1:07:34] he saw a cross over the sun and he hears
[1:07:37] these words
[1:07:39] hawk signal vince's in this sign you
[1:07:41] will win
[1:07:43] and he doesn't know that god
[1:07:46] but he thinks that sounds good
[1:07:48] so he puts the cross upon all the
[1:07:50] shields of his
[1:07:51] soldiers
[1:07:53] and they fight against maxenzius at the
[1:07:56] milivian bridge in rome and they win
[1:08:01] so from that time on constantine is not
[1:08:05] a
[1:08:06] believer
[1:08:07] but he is now propagating that god who
[1:08:10] gave him that victory he doesn't know
[1:08:12] who that god is called they call him
[1:08:14] christian christian
[1:08:16] but he seems to be very very powerful
[1:08:19] so we will
[1:08:21] make him our god for our our god
[1:08:23] protector instead of soul invictus
[1:08:26] now we have now two churches and these
[1:08:28] two churches have two big schools
[1:08:32] the two big schools in east rome and
[1:08:34] restroom
[1:08:36] is the divinity of jesus christ because
[1:08:39] with something he is just a man he's
[1:08:42] created and something he's part of god
[1:08:46] and both have their scriptures
[1:08:48] some said yes jesus said himself me and
[1:08:50] the father are one and the other one
[1:08:52] said yes but uh at the cross he said my
[1:08:55] god my god why did you forsake have you
[1:08:57] forsaken me
[1:09:00] so there were two big schools and you
[1:09:02] understand the problem when now rome
[1:09:05] rome
[1:09:06] turns to be one to be one kingdom
[1:09:09] and the christian doctrine the christian
[1:09:12] religion shall be states religion
[1:09:15] uh it is important that the leaders of
[1:09:17] that religion understand their own
[1:09:19] doctrine
[1:09:20] because you have to explain to all
[1:09:23] these
[1:09:24] other religions what they now have to
[1:09:26] believe and if they're not sure of
[1:09:27] themselves what do you explain to them
[1:09:29] you say it's a tremendous god but he
[1:09:30] doesn't know his own doctrine
[1:09:32] so therefore constantine he brought them
[1:09:36] together
[1:09:38] on that consul of nicaea
[1:09:41] that was the original brother bram said
[1:09:43] they should not have gone there
[1:09:45] exactly but they came together and and
[1:09:48] constantine was a deal maker he said
[1:09:50] look gentlemen
[1:09:52] i'm not interested in the solution but
[1:09:54] we'll have one solution if this consult
[1:09:56] is over we have one solution either
[1:09:59] jesus is eternal
[1:10:01] or he is just created like an angel that
[1:10:04] was the purpose of the nazi encounter
[1:10:06] constantine was not interested in the
[1:10:08] result he wasn't unbelievable he was an
[1:10:10] emperor
[1:10:11] exactly so
[1:10:13] the question is quite interesting
[1:10:16] because here we have that council and
[1:10:18] brother blame said and that is what
[1:10:20] constantine his successor did and i see
[1:10:22] an afternoon i see here they invite
[1:10:23] invited the people of god to convention
[1:10:26] and when the church sat down to eat and
[1:10:28] rose up to play partaking of church from
[1:10:30] ceremonies and pagan feasts named after
[1:10:32] christian rights she was trapped she had
[1:10:35] committed committed fornication and god
[1:10:37] walked out
[1:10:38] now the question was this and i want you
[1:10:40] now to put on your spiritual jacket to
[1:10:42] understand what our brother was
[1:10:44] preaching this morning
[1:10:45] there is a big difference between
[1:10:48] created
[1:10:49] and begotten
[1:10:51] or birthed
[1:10:53] created means i'm manufacturing anything
[1:10:57] i'm doing thing
[1:10:59] but birthing means
[1:11:00] part of me comes out of me
[1:11:04] i created many things i built many
[1:11:06] things but i have one daughter
[1:11:09] my daughter was not created my daughter
[1:11:11] was begotten
[1:11:13] and part of me of my dna is in my
[1:11:16] daughter
[1:11:17] that's the difference
[1:11:19] between
[1:11:20] something which is created and something
[1:11:23] which is begotten
[1:11:25] it's part of me the greek word is homo
[1:11:28] uzios means of the same nature
[1:11:32] as of the father
[1:11:35] therefore brother abraham said god in
[1:11:37] the beginning created the angel it was
[1:11:39] the first thing that he did
[1:11:42] and then he says the first thing that
[1:11:43] came out of god was the logos and i
[1:11:45] never understood what was now first but
[1:11:47] it's clear both are right
[1:11:48] because one was a creation and another
[1:11:51] thing was the birth
[1:11:53] exactly so
[1:11:54] so we see
[1:11:57] that brother brahm says he says he first
[1:12:00] was god jehovah and out of him let's
[1:12:02] just picture now a little drama so you
[1:12:05] can get it let's see coming out of space
[1:12:07] where there's nothing let's make it a
[1:12:09] little white light a little mystic light
[1:12:11] like a halo that was the logos that went
[1:12:13] out of god in the beginning that was the
[1:12:16] son of god that came out of the bosom of
[1:12:18] the father that was what was in the
[1:12:20] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:12:21] with god and the word was god and the
[1:12:23] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:12:25] in the beginning was god and then out of
[1:12:28] god came the logos a part of god that
[1:12:30] went out of god
[1:12:32] rather it was not a second
[1:12:35] it was the same person
[1:12:38] we don't have two gods
[1:12:40] we don't have a father and
[1:12:42] a son the son is the father
[1:12:45] and you say amen
[1:12:47] so there is no not two souls and not two
[1:12:49] gods and not two lords
[1:12:51] amen you can have two opinions
[1:12:54] you can have a spiritual nature and a
[1:12:57] human nature
[1:12:59] as we always say
[1:13:00] you you take two jews and you have three
[1:13:03] opinions
[1:13:05] oh as they told me in south africa they
[1:13:08] said brother mark is in south africa
[1:13:09] they need only four persons
[1:13:12] four persons all no matter if male or
[1:13:15] female
[1:13:16] to start four churches
[1:13:19] and five political parties
[1:13:23] because many people are double-minded
[1:13:27] to choose three opinions
[1:13:29] you can have it but you will not have
[1:13:31] two persons in the godhead
[1:13:34] that logos was not created it was
[1:13:37] birthed out of god
[1:13:39] can you say amen
[1:13:42] so
[1:13:43] then brother brahman says this
[1:13:45] and the eternal thoughts of god let me
[1:13:48] ask you are the thoughts of god eternal
[1:13:50] if you can see it this will then you
[1:13:52] will see many things god is unchangeable
[1:13:55] in both essence and behavior
[1:13:57] we have studied that and proven that
[1:13:59] already god is infinite in his ability
[1:14:01] so therefore his god must be omniscient
[1:14:04] if he is omniscient then he is not now
[1:14:06] learning nor is taking counsel even with
[1:14:09] himself nor he at any time adding to his
[1:14:12] knowledge if he can add to his knowledge
[1:14:14] he is not omniscient the best way we
[1:14:16] could say that sometimes he will be
[1:14:20] but that's not scripture
[1:14:22] he is omniscient he has never had a new
[1:14:25] thought about anything because all his
[1:14:27] thoughts he always had always will have
[1:14:31] he knows the end from the beginning
[1:14:32] because he's god does
[1:14:35] the thoughts of god are eternal
[1:14:37] they are real
[1:14:39] and now you put on your spiritual jacket
[1:14:41] they are not simply like a man with a
[1:14:44] blue plant he has drawn out which one
[1:14:46] day will be translated into substance in
[1:14:49] form but they are already real and
[1:14:51] eternal and part of god
[1:14:55] [Music]
[1:14:57] i mean the family of god now i tell you
[1:15:00] one thing brother brahm said so often
[1:15:03] god was alone with his thoughts
[1:15:05] is that correct
[1:15:07] that means he was not alone
[1:15:12] he was never wrong
[1:15:14] he was alone with his thoughts
[1:15:18] amen
[1:15:19] and if it's if it is so
[1:15:22] in what form ever there's no time no not
[1:15:24] for me but he was not alone
[1:15:26] he was alone with his thoughts
[1:15:29] so you're beginning you come from very
[1:15:31] very far away
[1:15:33] very far away amen um how do you see how
[1:15:36] it matches with this morning you see i
[1:15:39] mean look at this
[1:15:40] so one thing is here
[1:15:43] if according to what brother brandon
[1:15:44] said if the bride was in adam or eve was
[1:15:49] in adam
[1:15:50] and the bride was in christ
[1:15:54] part of christ really part of christ
[1:15:57] when god took made eve he took part of
[1:15:59] adam
[1:16:01] it's the same substance
[1:16:03] it's like when when when when when
[1:16:05] michelangelo had that little statue of
[1:16:08] moses and was hitting with the hammer
[1:16:10] brother said that was a true masterpiece
[1:16:12] because that was calvary and he said and
[1:16:15] when he was hitting it he was part of
[1:16:16] his knee was just flew away
[1:16:19] but you understand the substance of the
[1:16:22] statue
[1:16:23] and the statue of that little piece is
[1:16:25] the same substance
[1:16:26] [Applause]
[1:16:28] therefore
[1:16:29] we were reading what we were reading
[1:16:31] this morning he calls us brothers
[1:16:35] because we come from a royal family
[1:16:38] amen amen so so what happens is if the
[1:16:42] bride was in christ was in him
[1:16:46] and christ was melchizedek in theophany
[1:16:49] form in the old testament that means the
[1:16:51] bride was in melchizedek
[1:16:53] [Applause]
[1:16:55] and if and and before there was
[1:16:57] mercastic it was the pillar of fire that
[1:16:59] means the bride was in that logos
[1:17:02] and if the logos comes out of god that
[1:17:04] means the bride was in god
[1:17:06] [Applause]
[1:17:08] nobody can preach you out
[1:17:11] nobody can preach you
[1:17:13] do you understand this message is not a
[1:17:16] sect
[1:17:17] cannot be
[1:17:18] cannot can because it speaks of the
[1:17:20] family in heaven
[1:17:22] it speaks of your theophany
[1:17:24] it speaks of more than membership and be
[1:17:26] a nice person here no no i was born to
[1:17:29] be a bride
[1:17:34] even if you leave bcf you still are
[1:17:36] bright
[1:17:37] or if you come to bcf you are bright
[1:17:40] [Applause]
[1:17:41] nobody can preach you out
[1:17:43] you are not part of a system
[1:17:46] your joy doesn't come everybody in bcf
[1:17:49] loves me
[1:17:51] your joy comes from your father
[1:17:53] [Applause]
[1:17:55] as a minister
[1:17:57] my joy is not that everybody's tapping
[1:17:59] on my shoulder because sometimes we have
[1:18:02] to say things to correct that's so
[1:18:04] the joy is if my father is happy about
[1:18:06] what i said
[1:18:08] but if god is in you i'm i i know there
[1:18:11] is some kind like a connection of yes it
[1:18:13] fits
[1:18:14] you remember brother branham
[1:18:16] he brother branham brought the gospel to
[1:18:19] our hearts
[1:18:21] because martin luther was a typical
[1:18:23] german
[1:18:24] amen
[1:18:25] more on military things
[1:18:31] [Applause]
[1:18:34] but brother branham was a melancholic
[1:18:36] man
[1:18:37] was
[1:18:38] writing poems
[1:18:40] even about his fault
[1:18:44] he was asked by by the christian prison
[1:18:47] please please read the poem about the
[1:18:49] fault brother ramsey i couldn't do it
[1:18:51] but that was the man writing a poem
[1:18:52] about his automobile
[1:18:54] that was our messenger
[1:18:56] the two sides
[1:18:58] so so he tells that story you have to
[1:19:00] make life to these things what the
[1:19:02] brother was preaching this morning how
[1:19:04] it fits together
[1:19:05] he said
[1:19:06] he said here is a young man he just
[1:19:08] plays violin you know and he gives his
[1:19:11] first concert and the people are so
[1:19:13] enthused they stand up and they're
[1:19:15] singing in uh they're shouting bravo
[1:19:17] which means great or bravissimo that
[1:19:19] means
[1:19:20] very wonderful and brother ram said this
[1:19:23] the boy is not interested what the
[1:19:24] audience is but right up there is his
[1:19:27] master
[1:19:28] and if his master applause the voices
[1:19:31] [Applause]
[1:19:33] brother we do not think that we're
[1:19:35] tapping one another's shoulders
[1:19:37] you are maybe not a preacher nobody
[1:19:39] knows your name
[1:19:40] but
[1:19:41] god knows your name
[1:19:44] all heaven knows who you are
[1:19:46] let your words be born
[1:19:50] in a manger of my heart
[1:19:53] you are more than just a bcf
[1:19:57] yen
[1:19:59] that is already much bcf is much
[1:20:02] you're more than just i'm a message
[1:20:04] believer you're more than this
[1:20:07] before there was a message you were
[1:20:08] there
[1:20:09] [Applause]
[1:20:11] and by no means we are branhamites
[1:20:14] by no means we are fans of anything in
[1:20:17] this message
[1:20:18] we come from god
[1:20:21] but as we are coming from god we
[1:20:23] understand god's voice to the messenger
[1:20:27] blessed be the name of can you say amen
[1:20:30] so
[1:20:31] so you understand
[1:20:33] and i give you some examples and i would
[1:20:34] like to make it for the young people to
[1:20:36] make tangible some of the things
[1:20:39] do you understand if we are children of
[1:20:41] a father
[1:20:43] we have to act like our father we cannot
[1:20:46] stay pentecostal babies in this message
[1:20:49] and he said this and he said this and
[1:20:52] i'm giving up a hey
[1:20:54] we had this time
[1:20:55] and god said to all of us
[1:20:58] marcus stand before me like a man
[1:21:01] stop being childish
[1:21:03] stop being over sensitive
[1:21:05] stop these things where were you man
[1:21:08] when the sons of god were shot in such a
[1:21:10] way
[1:21:12] he said do you understand there's even
[1:21:14] many people that cannot forgive
[1:21:17] they cannot forget
[1:21:19] um it's because they don't know exactly
[1:21:20] who they are
[1:21:22] it's still pentecostal baby with a very
[1:21:24] nice stock train but brother god calls
[1:21:26] us to go higher than this
[1:21:29] blessed be the name in a maturity
[1:21:32] here is the man
[1:21:33] uh
[1:21:34] here we know that these pictures
[1:21:37] uh that was done by by 1950 houston
[1:21:41] coliseum
[1:21:42] we see how reverend best comes to to to
[1:21:46] uh to to now
[1:21:47] blast against the healing ministry of
[1:21:50] brother branham we see how rf f bosworth
[1:21:52] comes and now matching him
[1:21:55] ff bosworth he is a doctor he comes out
[1:21:58] of the baptist church he knows their
[1:21:59] doctrine
[1:22:00] so what happens is this that that when
[1:22:04] ff boss was comes brother bryan said i
[1:22:06] allow you to go only if you don't make
[1:22:08] any kind of a fuss
[1:22:10] so the debate starts and f boss was just
[1:22:13] says one said do you reverend best do
[1:22:15] you believe that the seven compound name
[1:22:18] of jehovah referred to jesus christ and
[1:22:20] that was all and brother blame said this
[1:22:22] i even never thought about that
[1:22:24] [Laughter]
[1:22:26] so he learned the lesson brother brown
[1:22:28] was great enough
[1:22:30] to learn from his brothers and from his
[1:22:32] sisters
[1:22:33] once you see a man you know who thinks
[1:22:35] he's the man of the hour you know he
[1:22:36] didn't understand very much
[1:22:38] exactly so
[1:22:40] so so when this happens was too much i
[1:22:42] always said this reverend best was not
[1:22:44] good enough
[1:22:48] reverend beth was not good enough
[1:22:51] he was the best for the baptist church
[1:22:52] but not for the message
[1:22:54] amen
[1:22:56] so so when he was blowing up he was
[1:22:58] making some pictures
[1:23:00] uh with his fist
[1:23:03] under the the the chin of ever boss what
[1:23:06] here because what brother abraham says
[1:23:08] he says and god did not allow
[1:23:11] that these pictures were developed
[1:23:14] god had so much respect for a baptist
[1:23:17] minister
[1:23:19] brother don't you think that we have to
[1:23:20] think twice if we talk anything about
[1:23:23] ministers in this message
[1:23:26] we have no right to expose anything god
[1:23:28] is exposing
[1:23:30] amen we have no right to talk things
[1:23:33] to to to put assumption or whatever
[1:23:37] god
[1:23:38] in his way
[1:23:40] will have
[1:23:41] great respect for his family
[1:23:44] many times we mean well
[1:23:47] therefore i'm so against all these chat
[1:23:49] rooms and so forth i always tell our
[1:23:51] young people no comment
[1:23:53] because one day you stand before god
[1:23:56] no comments about nothing keep a man of
[1:23:59] god in the hands of god you are not his
[1:24:02] boss
[1:24:03] if he feels to be this way let him go
[1:24:06] i'm a traveler i go to many churches
[1:24:08] there's many things that i don't agree
[1:24:09] very much with it whatever kind of
[1:24:11] things but i said look that man is
[1:24:13] placed here for his church if he feels
[1:24:15] that way let him go
[1:24:16] if he asks me i give him a i can deal
[1:24:19] with it but if i'm not asked i'm not
[1:24:21] have no right now to
[1:24:23] renovate the whole church
[1:24:27] amen
[1:24:28] god did not allow that
[1:24:30] how many so what happens the the man who
[1:24:33] made this picture was a critic of
[1:24:35] brother branham
[1:24:36] and he thought it is just psychology
[1:24:40] and and and was not a believer anyhow
[1:24:42] and we know and i believe that was
[1:24:45] really the starting point of our most
[1:24:46] number brother chair to show
[1:24:48] how brother branham was
[1:24:50] hunting and he went over to to to to set
[1:24:54] this boy free from the electric chair
[1:24:56] and one week later he came and he met
[1:24:58] those angels very clear from the bible
[1:25:00] because the bible said it that way
[1:25:03] the boy who was
[1:25:06] now on in the death row
[1:25:08] was the son
[1:25:10] of the critic who made the picture of
[1:25:12] the pillar of fire
[1:25:13] that was his son
[1:25:15] and now i want to show you one thing
[1:25:16] about the patience of god
[1:25:19] we say
[1:25:20] we know
[1:25:21] that brother brain said to i think to
[1:25:23] fred softman he said these angels were
[1:25:25] waiting for me here all week
[1:25:28] so first of all we say what a noble man
[1:25:31] william branham was the man who was
[1:25:33] criticizing him
[1:25:35] he's going to save his children his
[1:25:38] child
[1:25:39] going there for a whole week by car to
[1:25:41] to to to to houston
[1:25:44] speaks to the governor
[1:25:47] convincing the governor showing the
[1:25:49] governor
[1:25:50] mr governor
[1:25:51] i don't know if the boy was guilty but
[1:25:53] he said god did not kill someone in in
[1:25:57] the god never killed cain
[1:26:00] who are you to kill that boy
[1:26:02] and the governor understood and and
[1:26:04] pardoned the boy
[1:26:05] so the father was so enthused about
[1:26:08] brother branham he said the very man
[1:26:10] that i was criticizing is now coming
[1:26:13] saving my son
[1:26:16] do you understand how far we are
[1:26:18] sometimes away
[1:26:21] that
[1:26:22] way of dealing with things how far away
[1:26:25] we are
[1:26:27] but here comes something greater
[1:26:29] not only brother branham waited six days
[1:26:31] the angels waiting
[1:26:35] for what for a boy who was an unbeliever
[1:26:40] do you understand this
[1:26:42] the angels waiting six days so that this
[1:26:45] boy could be saved from the electric
[1:26:46] chair
[1:26:47] god is interested in life
[1:26:50] we say this is just sawdust no message
[1:26:53] no nothing stameron
[1:26:56] god thinks different
[1:26:58] and the more we enter into maturity we
[1:27:01] think different
[1:27:04] become we are less judgmental and more
[1:27:06] helpful
[1:27:07] because we know one thing if god doesn't
[1:27:09] help the person nobody will help him
[1:27:12] you understand you will become queen
[1:27:14] esther
[1:27:15] amen can you say amen
[1:27:17] amen
[1:27:18] here is here is eric liddell
[1:27:21] let me put this on again because can you
[1:27:24] say amen so far
[1:27:26] i mean here's eric liedell
[1:27:29] eric liddell was a runner in the in the
[1:27:31] beginning of last century they call him
[1:27:33] the scottish locomotive
[1:27:38] he was having he was
[1:27:40] heading to the olympic games for two
[1:27:43] finals
[1:27:44] in the first one i think it was 400
[1:27:46] meters he was the favorite the second
[1:27:49] one
[1:27:50] he just entered into the final
[1:27:52] so
[1:27:53] he was a preacher in some kind like a
[1:27:56] anglican church
[1:27:58] and he was a runner and a football
[1:28:00] player at the same time
[1:28:02] what happened is this
[1:28:04] his final where he was the favorite
[1:28:08] started on a sunday
[1:28:11] and he refused to run
[1:28:13] though the gold medal was our issue and
[1:28:16] even the the the minister the prime
[1:28:18] minister tried to intervene because he
[1:28:20] was running for england was quite an
[1:28:22] expensive thing to to to to to bring
[1:28:24] these sporters in this place but he
[1:28:26] refused he said sunday
[1:28:28] will not run he said sunday is the day
[1:28:31] of the lord
[1:28:33] so
[1:28:35] during the week he never had another
[1:28:37] final but
[1:28:38] he was not at all the favorite for it so
[1:28:42] when he was
[1:28:43] uh right preparing for the for for for
[1:28:46] that run for that race
[1:28:48] the american trainer so there's many
[1:28:50] good things in america the american
[1:28:52] trainer came and gave him a leaflet just
[1:28:55] a piece of paper
[1:28:56] and he put it
[1:28:58] in his pocket
[1:29:00] and he was running that race
[1:29:02] and he was winning
[1:29:05] as a great surprise
[1:29:08] so when he was getting his price
[1:29:11] uh his gold medal whatever he's pulling
[1:29:14] out that little piece of paper that the
[1:29:16] american trainer the coach
[1:29:18] gave it to him
[1:29:19] and it was a
[1:29:21] leaflet out of the bible
[1:29:23] in the first book of psalms
[1:29:25] where it is written those who honor me
[1:29:28] i will honor
[1:29:32] brother it matters to serve the lord
[1:29:35] amen
[1:29:36] it matters to honor god because god will
[1:29:38] honor you
[1:29:40] god will not forget
[1:29:42] because god is a gentleman
[1:29:45] god
[1:29:46] loves to bless people
[1:29:48] brother if somebody is in the world and
[1:29:50] he is he knows nothing about the gospel
[1:29:53] and he just gives you a glass of water
[1:29:55] god says in my mind he will get his
[1:29:56] reward for this
[1:29:58] that's our father
[1:30:00] so christians are generous people
[1:30:03] christians therefore i was i was new in
[1:30:06] the church and i came
[1:30:08] and here come this youngster into sunday
[1:30:10] school i came in like this

[1:30:17] i found out who their parents were
[1:30:19] because the couple came in like this
[1:30:24] brother the way they came the children
[1:30:25] came
[1:30:27] you honor god sometimes people come into
[1:30:29] the church like like they want to go to

[1:30:35] volleyball you don't have to change even
[1:30:36] it's wonderful
[1:30:39] brother you honor god in many ways
[1:30:42] by your clothing
[1:30:44] by being early enough
[1:30:46] by praying
[1:30:47] by praising by being there not sleeping
[1:30:50] in the church but being there said i
[1:30:53] always say sleep in bed and pray in
[1:30:55] church
[1:30:56] don't pray in bed and sleep in church
[1:30:59] amen amen have you have you ever seen
[1:31:01] some

[1:31:18] and then you see people sleeping
[1:31:21] and there's only wait one way to wake
[1:31:23] them up this is my last thought
[1:31:27] and then at the at
[1:31:30] at the end of the church they come and
[1:31:31] shake your hands brother marcus
[1:31:33] it was such a blessing such a blessing
[1:31:36] what did you dream of a mercedes benz or
[1:31:40] [Applause]
[1:31:43] but we have to understand when we come
[1:31:45] to church we are in a spiritual warfare
[1:31:49] amen do you understand this you will
[1:31:51] never sleep in a soccer game in a
[1:31:52] football game never but once the word of
[1:31:55] god starts i mean

[1:32:04] example winston you were sick
[1:32:07] and just a little flu just a little
[1:32:12] and then you hear a voice you cannot go
[1:32:13] to church
[1:32:15] you will cross a pandemia right with
[1:32:17] your flu
[1:32:18] no don't you no no no have you ever
[1:32:21] heard that voice
[1:32:22] that means that voice speaks english and
[1:32:24] german
[1:32:26] [Applause]
[1:32:28] do you understand
[1:32:30] do you
[1:32:31] know if satan tells you no no you better
[1:32:34] stay home and you say to say no you stay
[1:32:36] home
[1:32:37] you stay
[1:32:38] home you get it
[1:32:41] i mean the way
[1:32:42] these
[1:32:43] these little things
[1:32:46] pleasing god
[1:32:48] pleasing god little things
[1:32:51] the more sacrifice you bring the more
[1:32:54] god blesses you
[1:32:56] brother if our attitude is right god
[1:32:59] takes care of the doctrine
[1:33:01] but if our attitude is wrong then our
[1:33:04] doctrine can be fine it is just
[1:33:06] knowledge nothing more to puff us up and
[1:33:08] think where this where it is forget it
[1:33:11] if your heart is right with god the holy
[1:33:13] spirit will bring that doctrine in its
[1:33:15] time
[1:33:17] can you say amen
[1:33:19] blessed be the name of the lord here we
[1:33:20] have brother brahm he is he is that
[1:33:22] great man of of donovan words it
[1:33:25] happened i looked over to his ear i seen
[1:33:27] his ear all swallowed up it said what's
[1:33:29] the matter donovan that ear he said
[1:33:31] brother branham he has been there all
[1:33:33] long time i don't know i just miss
[1:33:35] caught him by the hand there was a big
[1:33:37] cancer on his here never said one word
[1:33:39] just held it it was off my brother in a
[1:33:42] day or two after that there wasn't even
[1:33:43] a scar left
[1:33:45] it was his respect to the god of heaven
[1:33:49] by the quickening power killed the
[1:33:51] cancer and spared the life of donovan
[1:33:53] words brother if you want to teach your
[1:33:56] children something is to respect god
[1:33:59] and he respect his family
[1:34:03] first the preachers
[1:34:05] not because they are preachers but
[1:34:06] because they are always visible whatever
[1:34:08] they do
[1:34:10] and then respect the family of god if
[1:34:13] it's a sister if it's a brother if it's
[1:34:15] an older one if it's a young one brother
[1:34:17] even our children we have to respect
[1:34:20] them
[1:34:21] because our children are our brothers
[1:34:23] and sisters
[1:34:24] because if we are both having a car
[1:34:26] accident we have the same theophany
[1:34:29] the same age
[1:34:31] our
[1:34:32] children are not our little animals
[1:34:35] they belong to god
[1:34:37] they are just under our care for some
[1:34:39] time
[1:34:40] but our children our brothers and
[1:34:42] sisters
[1:34:43] can you say amen
[1:34:45] so all these things god for god they are
[1:34:48] important
[1:34:50] we think we just honor the great
[1:34:52] preachers but i believe god is in in the
[1:34:56] behind the flesh of a little sister
[1:34:59] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:35:01] can you say amen
[1:35:03] amen here's brother branham come and as
[1:35:06] i said we should have come directly into
[1:35:08] our theophany although in that sentence
[1:35:11] there is a contradiction a very nice
[1:35:12] contradiction brother brahma said we
[1:35:14] should have come in our theophany and
[1:35:16] and and we came like adam now adam was
[1:35:18] first in a theorem
[1:35:21] exactly so so we leave these kind of
[1:35:23] schools there but here we bypass let's
[1:35:26] say we bypassed our theorem
[1:35:28] and we landed in north carolina
[1:35:31] god never asked us do you want to be
[1:35:33] white or black male or female god never
[1:35:35] asked us
[1:35:36] and god puts us in the body that we
[1:35:38] don't like
[1:35:42] i mean if if if we would have been asked
[1:35:47] who should be your father i would say mr
[1:35:50] rockefeller
[1:35:53] but god puts us in simple situations
[1:35:56] god puts us in minds
[1:35:59] where we are we are standing in our own
[1:36:00] way
[1:36:01] now i want you to put on your spiritual
[1:36:03] jacket
[1:36:05] you must see both sides if not you get
[1:36:08] frustrated
[1:36:09] we are
[1:36:10] heavenly beings
[1:36:13] but still we are living in america
[1:36:16] we are in revelation chapter four that
[1:36:19] is very very clear
[1:36:21] absolutely taken up
[1:36:23] but at the same time tomorrow morning
[1:36:25] you go to work
[1:36:27] you work for general motors
[1:36:30] you are not dancing around the throne
[1:36:32] you work for general motors
[1:36:35] you have a family
[1:36:36] you create the children
[1:36:38] if you want to have a new baby you do it
[1:36:40] the
[1:36:40] conservative way
[1:36:43] you don't you don't you don't speak it
[1:36:45] into existence you have to do it the
[1:36:47] natural way
[1:36:48] can we say it like this
[1:36:50] amen
[1:36:51] you live in this world
[1:36:53] but at the same time you have to manage
[1:36:55] your life on this earth
[1:36:58] if not we can become a cult
[1:37:01] here's brother branham and put on the
[1:37:03] spiritual jacket brother branham
[1:37:04] receives the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:37:07] as a young boy
[1:37:08] but in the message on the wings of a
[1:37:10] snow white dove he says i was a neurotic
[1:37:12] all my life
[1:37:15] that means before his conversion
[1:37:18] with his conversion and after his
[1:37:20] conversion he was a neurotic
[1:37:23] okay he says i was a melancholic all my
[1:37:26] life
[1:37:27] exactly that means we have
[1:37:30] a new body which is growing into us our
[1:37:32] own theophany but at the same time we
[1:37:34] are still living in these elements
[1:37:38] therefore one of the pentecostal wrong
[1:37:41] doctrines was the perfection of our body
[1:37:44] we will never perfect it
[1:37:46] because we will leave it one day and go
[1:37:48] into our eternal body
[1:37:51] therefore i always say this i'm a very
[1:37:52] sympathetic person but you don't know me
[1:37:54] i live in a german tent
[1:37:57] i mean but if this earthly tabernacle
[1:38:00] will be dissolved
[1:38:01] that is for me the tenth vision
[1:38:03] if this earthly tabernacle will be
[1:38:05] dissolved i will enter into my real body
[1:38:07] in my real in my real being
[1:38:10] so here we have brother branham the
[1:38:12] seals are open he is full of the holy
[1:38:14] ghost and he wants to give up
[1:38:17] whenever brother branham wants to give
[1:38:19] up god comes on the scene
[1:38:22] and he takes him up onto a higher level
[1:38:25] he comes in the cave and says i explain
[1:38:27] to you your peculiar birth
[1:38:29] brother brahm is down he's he he is
[1:38:32] depressed and god says if i show you
[1:38:35] behind the curtain of time will it help
[1:38:37] you he said it will help him he brings
[1:38:39] him up he sees these people brother bram
[1:38:40] said i'm not the same anymore he comes
[1:38:42] back two years later
[1:38:45] he preaches the present stage of my
[1:38:47] ministry he said everybody has forsaken
[1:38:49] me all forsaking me this and this and
[1:38:51] this you understand
[1:38:53] he's a man who was so much in his men
[1:38:55] and colleagues thinking
[1:38:58] god comes again says i have to cheer up
[1:39:00] my messenger
[1:39:01] he says here he is in clifton's
[1:39:03] cafeteria the boy says
[1:39:05] he brings a prophecy because thou has
[1:39:08] chosen the way you will have
[1:39:11] and which portion of heaven is
[1:39:13] god doesn't say and we will see
[1:39:18] therefore what about our theophany if
[1:39:20] you will have it theoretically you have
[1:39:22] it already
[1:39:23] god will not say just before your death
[1:39:25] ah what about brother sons was he always
[1:39:28] in church
[1:39:29] did you always pay his thai things
[1:39:32] maybe he gets a theophany theory is not
[1:39:34] a reward it's your true body
[1:39:37] your geophone is older than your your
[1:39:39] natural body
[1:39:41] because it's an eternal body coming from
[1:39:43] the presence of god
[1:39:45] amen so so here we have the man he gives
[1:39:48] up in his mind
[1:39:50] but part of eternity is in him
[1:39:53] there's something in you that cannot
[1:39:54] give up anymore
[1:39:56] can you say it's not here but it's here
[1:39:59] amen so so so so so whenever god comes
[1:40:03] he brings him on a higher level
[1:40:06] and here here comes that voice
[1:40:08] he says look to the west and what does
[1:40:10] god say to brother bran that's your life
[1:40:13] what does it mean that's
[1:40:15] your
[1:40:16] life i ask you the question
[1:40:19] when were these mountains
[1:40:21] when were they created
[1:40:23] 1963
[1:40:25] they were created when god formed the
[1:40:27] earth
[1:40:29] knowing that his seventh angel will be a
[1:40:31] melancholic type of a person
[1:40:33] and then god says no it doesn't say look
[1:40:36] you have the open word you have this he
[1:40:38] said let that stand if there is ever a
[1:40:41] doubt in your mind remember this place
[1:40:46] do you understand
[1:40:48] we have these things in us but still in
[1:40:50] our mind we can be completely in amnesia
[1:40:54] and god all therefore it's so good to
[1:40:57] come in the house of the lord because
[1:40:58] god always remembers us
[1:41:01] of our true identity therefore we should
[1:41:03] not preach trump
[1:41:05] we were preaching about the blood moons
[1:41:06] or no blood moons there was nothing
[1:41:08] wrong with but it never helped nothing
[1:41:10] we have to preach about things with
[1:41:12] substance
[1:41:13] preach about covet no kuwait and trump
[1:41:15] and we preach about biden or whatever
[1:41:17] these things we will never change let's
[1:41:19] speak about things
[1:41:20] [Music]
[1:41:22] amen can you say amen can you say amen
[1:41:25] so one thing is sure amen god says to
[1:41:28] brother branham this
[1:41:30] is
[1:41:31] your life and i tell you one thing as
[1:41:35] much as the spoken word is in your heart
[1:41:37] but this
[1:41:39] is
[1:41:40] your life
[1:41:42] can you say amen
[1:41:44] so there's one thing sure
[1:41:46] if you are on the mountaintop
[1:41:49] never become arrogant
[1:41:51] oh that family and their children yeah
[1:41:55] only believe only believe that something
[1:41:57] is wrong because god says okay we will
[1:41:59] send you the next valley
[1:42:03] but if you are in the valley never give
[1:42:05] up
[1:42:07] never give up because one thing is
[1:42:08] arriving the next mountain is coming
[1:42:12] can you say amen god has a vision about
[1:42:15] our life
[1:42:16] god is not nervous when we become
[1:42:18] nervous
[1:42:19] because we have a representation
[1:42:22] can you say amen
[1:42:24] therefore that is the story behind
[1:42:27] israel
[1:42:28] god is placing
[1:42:31] everything in his mind
[1:42:33] according
[1:42:34] to his plan
[1:42:38] i mean
[1:42:39] so even theodore herzl you know whenever
[1:42:42] a nation was destroyed they never came
[1:42:45] back
[1:42:46] you take the at stakes
[1:42:48] you take the incas you take the mayas
[1:42:51] you take the
[1:42:52] mongols you take the assyrians the
[1:42:54] persians the egyptians whenever a
[1:42:56] supernation was destroyed they never
[1:42:58] came back
[1:43:00] but only one nation that's israel
[1:43:03] and brother brahman said it like this he
[1:43:05] said if a revival ever dies it will
[1:43:07] never come back
[1:43:09] so don't waste your time trying to bring
[1:43:11] a pentecostal revival in a church
[1:43:14] this thing is over we have more than we
[1:43:16] ever had
[1:43:18] amen because brother bram said we live
[1:43:20] on the ashes of the revival at the same
[1:43:22] time he says the bride did not have her
[1:43:24] revival yet
[1:43:26] that means it's another revival then we
[1:43:27] had it in the former ages another form
[1:43:31] so god
[1:43:33] thought about israel being in their
[1:43:34] place even theodor herzl we go to
[1:43:37] argentina or we go to uganda but god let
[1:43:40] them that they were right in palestine
[1:43:43] and god was leading even the second
[1:43:45] world war so they had to go back into
[1:43:47] their homelands
[1:43:49] and brother abraham said this in the
[1:43:50] seventh seal he said there will be 12
[1:43:53] 000 of all nations of all tribes he said
[1:43:57] they don't know who they are
[1:43:59] but god knows them
[1:44:01] that means in 2000 years god was always
[1:44:04] watching their families
[1:44:07] the same for you
[1:44:09] do you remember you have a theophany
[1:44:12] and you are theophany has a certain look
[1:44:14] but the brahman said meter had the same
[1:44:16] black hair over there as she had here
[1:44:19] so god had to form your image according
[1:44:22] to your own theophany
[1:44:24] you cannot have a theoretical with black
[1:44:25] hair and blonde here on this side
[1:44:28] because it matches so god had to put
[1:44:30] over many generations
[1:44:32] the father and mother together that you
[1:44:34] have the look that you are
[1:44:36] can you say amen brother blame said in
[1:44:38] the message things that are to be god
[1:44:40] was planning our birth for many
[1:44:43] generations
[1:44:46] we are not here by accident
[1:44:48] we are here because we are ambassadors
[1:44:50] you can say
[1:44:52] i came into this world to be a light
[1:44:55] can you say amen
[1:44:57] you are a light at that place where you
[1:44:59] are nobody can take your place
[1:45:02] don't you understand how we have to grow
[1:45:04] to become that light
[1:45:06] how that church has to leave childish
[1:45:09] things
[1:45:10] unmuch immature thing to come into the
[1:45:13] position that we have that we should be
[1:45:15] can you say amen
[1:45:17] so look at this finishing
[1:45:19] amen man
[1:45:22] when
[1:45:23] we were talking about that young girl
[1:45:26] we cannot help somebody who comes out of
[1:45:28] the jehovah witnesses we cannot help god
[1:45:31] has to call that person to the message
[1:45:33] of the hour
[1:45:35] but we can do a lot of things for our
[1:45:36] own young people
[1:45:38] to be very much aware do we lead them
[1:45:40] into a cult
[1:45:42] or into the freedom of christ
[1:45:44] that is our great responsibility
[1:45:46] amen
[1:45:48] here is a young man and
[1:45:50] he is
[1:45:52] i got many of those some of these cases
[1:45:55] and brother i want to tell you one thing
[1:45:57] the message that we believe has a
[1:45:59] transforming power
[1:46:01] but it is it takes time
[1:46:03] the time is over that we make a prayer
[1:46:05] line and santa claus comes
[1:46:08] and prayers
[1:46:09] and and puts all our problems away it is
[1:46:12] a process
[1:46:14] every church service that we have is a
[1:46:16] therapy
[1:46:18] amen
[1:46:19] because we were born the wrong way
[1:46:21] and we are molding more in the image of
[1:46:23] our true being who we are really it's a
[1:46:25] process it's a dying
[1:46:27] it's not only being baptized at baptist
[1:46:29] with the holy ghost no then it's a dying
[1:46:32] from day to day from situation and god
[1:46:34] puts more possibilities to die
[1:46:37] we ask for a picnic god brings problems
[1:46:41] because he's not interested in us being
[1:46:42] blessed and going to the tribulation
[1:46:44] god sponsor takes us home but he needs
[1:46:46] to find character
[1:46:48] here's a young man and
[1:46:50] this is just an
[1:46:52] example he's way overweight we're not
[1:46:55] not we're not talking now about the
[1:46:57] physical
[1:46:58] we talk about the natural the spiritual
[1:47:01] okay
[1:47:02] because i see a lot of people here they
[1:47:03] are overweighted so don't feel
[1:47:06] don't feel attacked right now okay
[1:47:11] we speak about the spiritual.
[1:47:13] but brother
[1:47:15] and i and i got several cases
[1:47:17] here's a boy
[1:47:19] he has given up
[1:47:20] okay that way he cannot work
[1:47:23] he's just he just hangs around i always
[1:47:25] call him the couch potato
[1:47:28] a true couch potato
[1:47:30] cannot work
[1:47:31] cannot stand up he's just hanging around
[1:47:35] the question is how can i help this
[1:47:36] brother how can i help the boy if i love
[1:47:39] him i want to help him
[1:47:40] i can tell him
[1:47:42] and i hope i'm not finding the right
[1:47:43] words i can tell him you are just a fat
[1:47:46] loser
[1:47:47] that's true but does it help him
[1:47:51] we can't tell him the truth but does
[1:47:53] that true help truth help that boy will
[1:47:55] not help it it will just bring a bigger
[1:47:57] complex
[1:47:59] so his father comes you're you're worthy
[1:48:01] for nothing man in your age i was
[1:48:03] building already two houses
[1:48:06] you are hanging just around so he will
[1:48:08] become more and more introverted
[1:48:11] his mother comes oh the poor boy
[1:48:14] he he cannot he cannot move anymore so i
[1:48:17] have to bring him back breakfast to
[1:48:18] bread
[1:48:20] she's not helping neither
[1:48:24] because because if that boy finds out
[1:48:26] the only thing that i have to do is just
[1:48:28] lay down and somebody comes and brings
[1:48:30] it to me i will lay down more and he
[1:48:32] brings more
[1:48:34] that is the problem in when people have
[1:48:36] to come out of their couch
[1:48:38] but that boy has to find out now the boy
[1:48:40] comes into the prayer line
[1:48:42] and he says
[1:48:43] pray for me that i will lose weight
[1:48:48] spiritual
[1:48:50] that will not work
[1:48:51] that will not work
[1:48:53] the thing that he has to do he has to
[1:48:54] move
[1:48:56] and he has to eat less
[1:48:59] and has to eat the right thing
[1:49:01] but he wants to go from prayerland to
[1:49:03] prayerland thinking santa claus comes
[1:49:05] and takes his problem away
[1:49:06] [Music]
[1:49:08] i told you many times we were
[1:49:10] unbelievers
[1:49:11] and and what happens i was fan of arnold
[1:49:15] schwarzenegger and sylvester stallone so
[1:49:17] we were watching those films
[1:49:18] and and i remember that arnie he was
[1:49:20] just making his breast mess
[1:49:23] and i was just a young boy so we were
[1:49:25] making bodybuilding
[1:49:27] and i went before the mirror and nothing
[1:49:28] moved
[1:49:32] but what i learned is this if you want
[1:49:34] to have muscles
[1:49:35] you need
[1:49:36] have to eat a steak
[1:49:38] you cannot eat mcdonald's
[1:49:41] and if you want to have spiritual
[1:49:43] muscles you cannot eat facebook
[1:49:46] you need spiritual food in due season
[1:49:48] [Applause]
[1:49:50] that boy
[1:49:52] needs somebody who loves him
[1:49:55] he must find a friend
[1:49:58] somebody who read because love is not
[1:50:00] words love you you feel if a person
[1:50:03] loves you you feel it
[1:50:05] if he just wants to correct you you feel
[1:50:07] but you if if somebody loves you you
[1:50:09] feel it
[1:50:12] he first needs a friend
[1:50:14] he first needs the content and one thing
[1:50:17] is sure
[1:50:18] superman is in that boy
[1:50:21] he just needs training
[1:50:23] and he just have to change his diet
[1:50:26] and you tell him look
[1:50:28] if we make our training together in one
[1:50:30] year from now you are a runner
[1:50:34] he doesn't believe but he needs somebody
[1:50:36] who paints that picture
[1:50:38] for his eyes
[1:50:40] that's how it works in the natural
[1:50:43] and the first thing he will not even
[1:50:45] come out of his couch and he needs
[1:50:47] someone who puts him
[1:50:50] the sports shoes on his feet
[1:50:52] that's that's our ministry brother
[1:50:54] that's our ministry helping him out
[1:50:57] and he cannot run he will just walk for
[1:50:59] 100 yards and he goes back on his couch
[1:51:01] and we say the training of today is
[1:51:03] finished great done wonderful tomorrow
[1:51:06] we make 10 yards more
[1:51:08] and he has
[1:51:10] but he can only start
[1:51:13] if he has a vision
[1:51:15] that it works
[1:51:16] that
[1:51:17] superman lays in me
[1:51:20] i make it
[1:51:21] i can't make it if i have the discipline
[1:51:24] do you understand what brother brandon
[1:51:26] did with us when he said quickening
[1:51:28] power brought us behind brought me
[1:51:30] behind the curtain of time and i see all
[1:51:33] of you there
[1:51:35] he shows no matter how much you are
[1:51:37] standing in your own way
[1:51:39] but you're there already
[1:51:42] how may no matter how much you suffer
[1:51:45] with with with
[1:51:46] whatever it is traumatizer child abuse
[1:51:50] uh your own no matter what you're
[1:51:52] suffering with but you're already there
[1:51:56] and the thing that you do is you watch
[1:51:58] now that picture of that perfect person
[1:52:00] and you are now developing into that
[1:52:02] same picture
[1:52:03] [Applause]
[1:52:04] do you understand what this message
[1:52:06] makes with us
[1:52:07] and brother ram said if you want to get
[1:52:09] healing he said you must see yourself to
[1:52:11] be a healed person and you're walking
[1:52:14] into that image
[1:52:16] step by step
[1:52:18] do you understand how important is that
[1:52:20] we are not preaching a complex to the
[1:52:22] people what they are not
[1:52:24] but we have to tell the people who they
[1:52:25] are
[1:52:27] because we did not know who we were
[1:52:29] and then our father came down
[1:52:32] and said you are not from georgia
[1:52:34] you are not from ohio you live in an
[1:52:36] ohio tent
[1:52:38] but your true being comes from another
[1:52:40] dimension
[1:52:42] you did not know who you are but i know
[1:52:44] who you are
[1:52:45] because i play i place part of me in you
[1:52:49] and then this message starts slowly but
[1:52:51] surely to form us
[1:52:53] not to reform us
[1:52:56] but by the opening of the word we find
[1:52:58] out who we are truly
[1:53:01] can you say amen
[1:53:03] blessed be the name of the lord here's
[1:53:04] what brother abraham said
[1:53:06] it's such a wonderful blessing to know
[1:53:08] the lord jesus as our savior to know him
[1:53:11] as our healer and looking for him to
[1:53:13] come as our kingdom to set up a kingdom
[1:53:16] on earth that we shall rule and reign
[1:53:18] with him for a
[1:53:19] thousand years with him
[1:53:22] he said and i told you last time here
[1:53:24] there was a new ministry coming
[1:53:28] i spoke with some of the brethren today
[1:53:30] i was telling them about what happens
[1:53:32] just remember that's the first time i
[1:53:34] was here you remember the lord had told
[1:53:35] me something was going to happen
[1:53:37] changing in the ministry it happened
[1:53:40] said another one is going to happen and
[1:53:41] it happened now there is another one
[1:53:44] greater far greater than all the rest of
[1:53:46] them put together
[1:53:48] already confirmed and ready i hope it
[1:53:51] happens tonight i just might say that i
[1:53:53] don't have time to explain it to you but
[1:53:56] to the president who doesn't know about
[1:53:58] it it's wonderful it's such a great
[1:54:01] thing for the people and i am grateful
[1:54:03] to god that our is soon at hand when god
[1:54:06] is going to help his children
[1:54:08] especially it will be for those who
[1:54:11] can't muster the faith to raise up and
[1:54:13] get a hold of god like they should i
[1:54:16] believe the lord is doing providing a
[1:54:18] way for us now to take care of them also
[1:54:23] some runs into faith that they just can
[1:54:25] reach over and receive anything that's
[1:54:28] great faith some of them has mustered
[1:54:30] seed faith
[1:54:31] and has wait so long to get through i
[1:54:34] believe the lord is making a way for
[1:54:36] those people now i don't know when it
[1:54:39] will be but it will be just as certain
[1:54:41] as i'm standing i it will be
[1:54:45] his brother brahmi speaks about the
[1:54:47] changing in his ministry
[1:54:50] and it doesn't deal any more with
[1:54:51] william brennan but god will change his
[1:54:53] ministry to help those who are weak in
[1:54:55] faith
[1:54:57] those who want to make it but they
[1:54:59] cannot make it
[1:55:00] those
[1:55:02] who are weak in themselves and god says
[1:55:04] i come down myself personally
[1:55:07] i will be your faith
[1:55:09] i will be your rapture
[1:55:11] blessed be the name of the lord so he
[1:55:13] reveals our true identity
[1:55:16] he says we shall rise
[1:55:18] in him we become part of him the easter
[1:55:20] the revealed secret of god like it was
[1:55:23] then life after death we are now alive
[1:55:25] who were once dead in sin and trespasses
[1:55:28] the true easter seal has broken death
[1:55:30] from around me
[1:55:33] and i'm alive the easter seal at the
[1:55:35] beginning broke the seal of the roman
[1:55:36] seal the easter seal that was that he
[1:55:39] was sealed up a man when he died was
[1:55:41] gone but broke the seal and revealed the
[1:55:43] secret and now god by his holy spirit
[1:55:46] has broke the seal from around our lives
[1:55:50] and christ is revealed as he lives in us
[1:55:53] for now we are quickened with him
[1:55:56] the opening of the seed is not a
[1:55:58] doctrine that we know it's revealed who
[1:56:00] we are
[1:56:01] and once you know who you are you know
[1:56:03] you made it already there
[1:56:05] once you know you made already there you
[1:56:07] understand
[1:56:09] this is human nature
[1:56:11] and you leave human nature like this
[1:56:14] because some of the things you will
[1:56:15] never change we always thought the new
[1:56:18] birth takes everything out of it but
[1:56:20] reality found us
[1:56:22] if this is so i believe there's no one
[1:56:24] here who is born again because i know
[1:56:26] you too well
[1:56:29] inclusive your precious brother mark
[1:56:31] because we know one another too well
[1:56:32] that we're not living on slogans
[1:56:35] but i believe here's a lot of people
[1:56:37] born again but we still have
[1:56:40] that old nature
[1:56:41] but we have something in us which is
[1:56:43] greater than that old nature
[1:56:46] takes it in his control
[1:56:48] we have that black dog and we have that
[1:56:50] white dog
[1:56:51] can you say amen
[1:56:52] so therefore we see the picture here
[1:56:55] and we see and brother branham this
[1:56:57] picture was made in 1959
[1:57:00] and brother bryan refers it to the book
[1:57:02] of ezekiel
[1:57:03] and to revelation chapter four
[1:57:07] so here's the grace of god he said we
[1:57:10] say the church has to go up yes but what
[1:57:13] about god coming down
[1:57:16] in our dimension
[1:57:18] amen
[1:57:19] amen
[1:57:21] god coming down helping his children so
[1:57:24] these things that we see the revelation
[1:57:26] 3 4 is reality for us
[1:57:30] brother when we come into the house of
[1:57:32] the lord believe that the angels of the
[1:57:34] lord are there
[1:57:36] believe that the pillar of fire is there
[1:57:38] but ah that means brother marcus we are
[1:57:41] past the rapture spiritually we are in
[1:57:44] raptured condition absolutely but isn't
[1:57:46] it true we are still in revelation 3
[1:57:48] from our normal living because general
[1:57:50] motors is not around the throne
[1:57:55] amen your working place on monday
[1:57:57] morning is not around the throne it is
[1:57:59] in lima ohio
[1:58:02] so we are living here but at the same
[1:58:04] time we are already in
[1:58:06] revelation chapter four
[1:58:08] can you say amen
[1:58:10] lester be the name of soul so once we
[1:58:13] understand we are we can now grow
[1:58:15] because we know we have our earthly
[1:58:18] being
[1:58:18] but we have our true identity is now
[1:58:21] influencing us more and more and more
[1:58:24] that she becomes him
[1:58:28] can you say amen
[1:58:29] so therefore that's what i said this
[1:58:31] morning
[1:58:32] everybody who does not want to grow you
[1:58:33] will end up in a sect
[1:58:36] some guru is waiting for you
[1:58:40] who wants your money who wants your
[1:58:41] membership
[1:58:43] wants to have him in his place he wants
[1:58:44] to manipulate you
[1:58:46] he wants to correct you he wants to rule
[1:58:48] over you he wants to reign over you
[1:58:51] somebody will get you
[1:58:54] amen but if you're in christ nobody gets
[1:58:56] you
[1:58:58] amen you have a father
[1:59:00] and then you go to a church you are
[1:59:01] subject to the church it's not a problem
[1:59:03] for you at all but your but but but your
[1:59:06] identity is your father
[1:59:08] you don't have to fight for a doctrine
[1:59:10] you don't have to fight for ideas you
[1:59:12] don't have to fight for conspiracy
[1:59:14] theories if covet comes from this does
[1:59:17] it come from a monkey or does it come
[1:59:18] from a laboratory that no matter where
[1:59:20] it comes from god allowed it
[1:59:22] it's here we have other problems in just
[1:59:24] kovitz my soul is more important than my
[1:59:26] kovic
[1:59:27] we preach about other things we bring
[1:59:29] people into another dimension
[1:59:31] can you say amen
[1:59:33] at the same time we know how to rule our
[1:59:35] families
[1:59:36] a young boy came to me he said brother
[1:59:38] marcus i'm not working anymore not
[1:59:39] working that's fine because we have a
[1:59:41] social system and so it's we have a
[1:59:43] social system in germany which allows
[1:59:46] you not to work
[1:59:48] he said i'm not working i'm a christian
[1:59:50] that's fine
[1:59:51] he said no because in millennium we are
[1:59:52] not working
[1:59:54] so i feel that we're already portraying
[1:59:56] what is million we're not working there
[1:59:58] so i'm not working here brother i think
[2:00:00] that is the false interpretation of that
[2:00:02] whole thing
[2:00:04] um we have to work we do things we have
[2:00:05] family
[2:00:06] we have headaches we have things we go
[2:00:09] to the dentist we go everywhere
[2:00:14] but at the same time there's some part
[2:00:16] of us already in that other dimension
[2:00:19] we're feeding not from a man with
[2:00:20] freedom from the body word of the son of
[2:00:22] man
[2:00:24] we are not a sec this message is not a
[2:00:25] sect

[2:00:54] away go on
[2:00:55] let nothing stop you
[2:00:57] can you say amen you must handle both
[2:01:00] dimensions if not you become cultish
[2:01:04] we have seen these people
[2:01:06] amen they cannot even say goodbye oh
[2:01:08] hello
[2:01:10] shalom

[2:01:19] yourself
[2:01:20] ridiculous you must be a man's man you
[2:01:23] must stand on this earth
[2:01:25] and at the same time no i have a
[2:01:26] connection in the other dimension
[2:01:28] i'm i'm not a hillbilly from lima ohio
[2:01:33] i'm part of the family of god
[2:01:35] my true identity is there i'm waiting
[2:01:38] for my body change
[2:01:40] can you say amen
[2:01:41] amen finishing amen amen here's what i
[2:01:45] wanted to read two two two more that i'm
[2:01:46] leaving can you say amen
[2:01:48] do you understand we're just what we
[2:01:50] heard this morning putting into
[2:01:51] practical
[2:01:52] things
[2:01:53] into a practical here's what brother
[2:01:55] blame the resume of the ages
[2:01:57] not for one moment i do bring a message
[2:01:59] to the people that made that they may
[2:02:01] follow me or join my church or start
[2:02:04] some fellowship or organization i have
[2:02:06] never done it will never do that is the
[2:02:08] last page of the church books
[2:02:10] i have no interest in those things but i
[2:02:13] do have an interest in the things of god
[2:02:15] and people
[2:02:16] and if i can accomplish just one thing i
[2:02:18] will be satisfied that one thing is to
[2:02:21] see establish a true spiritual
[2:02:23] relationship between god and man
[2:02:27] that is a true minister of god he's not
[2:02:30] putting people to himself but just make
[2:02:33] a relationship between god and man
[2:02:35] once once that ministry of eliezer
[2:02:38] brought rebecca to isaac when when when
[2:02:40] when rebecca saw isaac brother that is
[2:02:42] the problem too much people in this
[2:02:44] message they want to marry eliza
[2:02:47] they fall in love with eliezer
[2:02:49] but rebecca just falls in love with
[2:02:51] isaac
[2:02:53] amen in the evening time and they went
[2:02:56] in their mothers attend the tent vision
[2:02:59] exactly so and what did eliezer do which
[2:03:01] was withdrawing himself
[2:03:03] my time is over my ministry is over amen
[2:03:08] amen
[2:03:09] this is the last one hallelujah
[2:03:12] amen this is made by by national
[2:03:15] geographics
[2:03:18] i mean
[2:03:19] this is an eagle attacked by a craw or
[2:03:21] some kind like an animal okay this is an
[2:03:23] unbeliever and he made a little film but
[2:03:25] one of the pictures out of it
[2:03:27] so the crow is sitting on the back of
[2:03:29] the eagle and just hitting him on the
[2:03:32] head
[2:03:33] and
[2:03:35] that eagle when he was attacked that way
[2:03:37] did not do anything
[2:03:38] was just flying okay
[2:03:40] was not fighting that bird on this back
[2:03:43] but at certain time that eagle just
[2:03:45] rised up
[2:03:48] and went up and up and up and that eagle
[2:03:50] knew one thing
[2:03:51] hey my friends
[2:03:54] if you you better you better lose your
[2:03:56] grip because i go now
[2:03:58] in a region
[2:04:00] if you want to follow me brother you got
[2:04:02] a problem man
[2:04:04] you got that he was not fighting that
[2:04:06] thing he just went up
[2:04:10] you will not fight the devil
[2:04:13] you're not you will not change politics
[2:04:15] you will not change your country the
[2:04:16] thing that you have to do is rising up
[2:04:20] into another dimension
[2:04:22] right around the throne knowing who you
[2:04:24] are really
[2:04:26] even if you see weaknesses in your life
[2:04:28] you can say this is not my true being
[2:04:30] this is this is the body that i live in
[2:04:33] if god doesn't change i will die with it
[2:04:36] what can you do if you're sitting in a
[2:04:37] wheelchair if god doesn't deliver you
[2:04:39] you're the same eagle
[2:04:42] has nothing to do with your inner being
[2:04:45] god allows many many things in our life
[2:04:48] so don't never look on your own on your
[2:04:50] outside body look on the on the eternal
[2:04:53] part which is right in here
[2:04:56] can you say amen
[2:04:57] and therefore we come to church always
[2:04:59] oppressed and depressed amen and here if
[2:05:02] god allows then we just take that okay
[2:05:04] brother you want to make a right with me
[2:05:07] [Music]
[2:05:10] and we go up in regions where he doesn't
[2:05:12] understand anything
[2:05:15] if the musicians would come blessed be
[2:05:17] the name of the lord
[2:05:19] this message i want to repeat myself
[2:05:22] is not a cult it's not a sect it's not a
[2:05:23] denomination we are not supposed to do
[2:05:26] anything about that this message is
[2:05:28] god's plan for his children
[2:05:31] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:05:33] i mean maybe you have a nice song like
[2:05:35] do you have the song as the deer pants
[2:05:37] for the water i mean let me finish
[2:05:40] with that little with that little
[2:05:41] thought
[2:05:42] i mean i hope that somebody comes out of
[2:05:45] these meetings and says from my outside
[2:05:49] i'm just a hillbilly from lima ohio
[2:05:52] but i'm but i'm more than this
[2:05:55] what is your purpose to criticize around
[2:05:57] in the no my purpose is to be a light
[2:06:00] for my father
[2:06:01] on my job where nobody else you are an
[2:06:05] intercessor
[2:06:07] absolutely so because people will be
[2:06:10] judged one day the way they treated you
[2:06:14] this changes our attitude on work
[2:06:18] amen we know how to behave ourselves
[2:06:20] amen we know what one thing
[2:06:23] nobleness
[2:06:25] obligates
[2:06:27] nobleness no bless oblige
[2:06:29] nobleness obligates amen
[2:06:32] and if we say
[2:06:34] if we're really mispleasing god by being
[2:06:37] childish there's something in us that
[2:06:39] says i have to make these things right
[2:06:41] it's not correct
[2:06:42] because i'm i'm a child of a of a mighty
[2:06:45] king
[2:06:46] this bride has a high calling brother
[2:06:49] one day she will stand and what she will
[2:06:51] judge things
[2:06:52] how can we judge eternal things if we
[2:06:54] cannot even judge our marriage
[2:06:56] little things in the church
[2:06:58] so god wants a church to really become
[2:07:01] in becoming mature
[2:07:04] if you play softly the song amen
[2:07:06] [Music]
[2:07:09] david
[2:07:10] if everything is closed don't fear that
[2:07:12] you that want to make it longer but
[2:07:14] again putting a little bit heart and
[2:07:16] soul to that thing i mean maybe that's
[2:07:18] my ministry to put heart and soul to the
[2:07:20] doctrine
[2:07:22] man
[2:07:24] but
[2:07:25] all the bible is the revelation of our
[2:07:27] father we find ourselves in that
[2:07:29] brother bran speaks about
[2:07:31] david and his gallant soldiers
[2:07:34] mighty man
[2:07:36] he calls him brother brandon refers to
[2:07:38] them in
[2:07:39] the message
[2:07:41] there's a man who can turn on the light
[2:07:44] david was such a tremendous king
[2:07:48] and these people they loved that man so
[2:07:50] much when david was in bethlehem or in
[2:07:52] that cave
[2:07:55] and the man were around him david had
[2:07:57] just a wish just a desire
[2:07:59] [Music]
[2:08:01] just a fresh string from the well in
[2:08:04] bethlehem
[2:08:05] amen and these men and brother brahms
[2:08:07] said this this man so much love david
[2:08:12] love is not a feeling
[2:08:14] they so much love that man
[2:08:17] that the least of his wishes were
[2:08:19] command for them
[2:08:22] love is mortar
[2:08:25] i hope that we can talk to somebody who
[2:08:27] disagrees with us that we give them a
[2:08:29] call and said hey brother one thing i
[2:08:30] want to say you i love you brother
[2:08:33] honestly not just blah blah blah blah
[2:08:35] blah brother i really love you we
[2:08:37] disagree but i want to say i want to do
[2:08:39] nothing in my life to hurt your feelings
[2:08:41] because i know who you are
[2:08:43] and if i did please forgive me i mean
[2:08:46] well
[2:08:47] i mean i hope we tell sometime our wife
[2:08:49] hey honey
[2:08:51] after all this year i'm still loving you
[2:08:53] they're loving you you say do you do it
[2:08:55] brother marcus no i don't do it
[2:08:57] no i should do i know i should do but
[2:08:59] but i'm i'm in my own way i need god
[2:09:03] i need god to change things in my life i
[2:09:05] need god but i won't be changed
[2:09:08] because we're children of a father
[2:09:10] but what i'm doing is calling some time
[2:09:12] brother and saying hey brother i want to
[2:09:13] tell you one thing i'm just thinking
[2:09:15] about you
[2:09:16] i'm a little bit over this guy but just
[2:09:18] want to say i will i'm just praying
[2:09:19] right now for you that you know he is a
[2:09:21] brother on the other side of the ocean
[2:09:23] thinking about you
[2:09:24] and you see how that blessing always
[2:09:26] comes back to you
[2:09:28] sometimes we should more express these
[2:09:29] things
[2:09:31] so these men they were just fighters but
[2:09:33] the brahms said they were man that not
[2:09:36] no they know they did not knew what what
[2:09:39] what fear was
[2:09:40] they said that general squatskopf
[2:09:43] in the iranian war that was the type of
[2:09:45] a man he did not know what fear was so
[2:09:47] he was i think was the first parachutist
[2:09:50] over there
[2:09:51] in in the iraq war
[2:09:53] fighters you know you can see them all
[2:09:56] these tattoos
[2:09:59] he said and they went out
[2:10:01] to take their sword one took the bucket
[2:10:08] you touched my bucket smack your face
[2:10:11] man
[2:10:11] [Music]
[2:10:13] 14 miles
[2:10:15] through philistine countries just
[2:10:17] because of the wish of the king
[2:10:20] he did not the king didn't say you you
[2:10:21] you that is how sects work they command
[2:10:25] you
[2:10:26] they tell you what to do you you you you
[2:10:28] do this but in the house of god is
[2:10:31] different
[2:10:32] if it's not love it must be your our own
[2:10:35] will
[2:10:36] not somebody telling us always what to
[2:10:38] do
[2:10:39] like the jehovah witnesses and you go
[2:10:40] now evangelizing this in this street no
[2:10:42] we're different we do things as a spirit
[2:10:46] tells us no we're not we're not an
[2:10:48] organization we're a family of god
[2:10:51] okay you give me my liberty and you have
[2:10:53] your liberty okay i'm not your commander
[2:10:55] god must be your commander okay
[2:10:57] so when they came back
[2:10:59] and gave that to david they were so
[2:11:01] touched
[2:11:02] and he took that water as a water
[2:11:04] offering before the lord
[2:11:07] said that was the blood of these men
[2:11:09] do you see how the blood becomes water
[2:11:11] and the water becomes blood
[2:11:14] and when david became king at that same
[2:11:17] time
[2:11:18] this man came into their position
[2:11:21] [Music]
[2:11:22] same time no matter what the world tells
[2:11:26] about the message we know what it is
[2:11:30] we're not interested what somebody
[2:11:32] writes in any kind of crooked website
[2:11:35] about the messi we know what it is
[2:11:39] so don't waste your time
[2:11:42] i mean we understood that's our father
[2:11:45] talking to us
[2:11:46] and brother brahm said this
[2:11:49] he said
[2:11:50] these men knew that david one day will
[2:11:54] come into power they knew it
[2:11:56] by revelation
[2:12:00] so you know
[2:12:02] who will come into power jesus christ
[2:12:04] and when he comes into power we come
[2:12:07] into our position
[2:12:08] everything is a big love letter of god
[2:12:11] god and his children the bridegroom and
[2:12:13] his bride and we are part of that whole
[2:12:16] picture
[2:12:17] this bride is not manhandled
[2:12:20] she's in the hand of almighty god
[2:12:23] so let us sing the song and let us pray
[2:12:25] together
[2:12:28] god bless you all
[2:12:30] [Music]
[2:12:34] deer
[2:12:35] panties fall
[2:12:38] the water sold my soul
[2:12:42] longer than
[2:12:45] [Music]
[2:12:55] [Music]
[2:13:04] [Music]
[2:13:13] [Music]
[2:13:28] [Music]

[2:13:51] and you are
[2:13:54] my brother
[2:13:56] [Music]

[2:14:07] want you to
[2:14:20] [Music]

[2:14:59] [Music]
[2:15:03] i
[2:15:04] want you
[2:15:06] more
[2:15:12] you
[2:15:14] can say
[2:15:18] [Music]
[2:15:27] joy
[2:15:30] [Music]
[2:15:39] me
[2:15:44] [Music]
[2:15:55] me
[2:16:05] [Music]
[2:16:13] now while the music is softly playing i
[2:16:15] know i'm over time i beg you really
[2:16:17] pardoned for this
[2:16:20] but
[2:16:21] i make an altar call but the altar is in
[2:16:23] your heart okay
[2:16:25] but i don't want to have that we're just
[2:16:27] raising hands by raising hands
[2:16:29] i think we don't want to get to enter
[2:16:31] into a sector
[2:16:33] as a chair we don't want to have a cult
[2:16:35] no the brothers brother stephen
[2:16:37] we want the people really
[2:16:40] but it takes you yourself
[2:16:42] to really say heavenly father let me
[2:16:43] grow
[2:16:45] let me grow into that image
[2:16:47] let me be pleasing to you
[2:16:50] many of our reactions that we've showed
[2:16:52] in the past were just human
[2:16:55] nice
[2:16:56] nice
[2:16:58] nice
[2:16:59] message believing human people acting
[2:17:03] and reacting
[2:17:04] god sees it he overlooks their children
[2:17:07] that's fine but hey we have to come up a
[2:17:09] little bit higher is that okay for you
[2:17:12] amen if you really feel it in your in
[2:17:14] your heart you say lord even if it takes
[2:17:16] pressure even if it takes molding and
[2:17:18] training
[2:17:19] even if i have to come out of my
[2:17:21] comfortable couch
[2:17:23] my couch potato thinking of just going
[2:17:26] to church and but lord let me be
[2:17:29] what you desire
[2:17:30] for me to be before the foundation of
[2:17:32] the world
[2:17:33] let me be a true bride let me walk like
[2:17:36] it talk let it dress like it
[2:17:39] react like it take all these
[2:17:42] green things out of me and let me ripen
[2:17:44] in the sun and if you really feel it on
[2:17:46] your heart you can raise your hand or
[2:17:47] you can even stand up
[2:17:49] i mean ask brother franco not to fail
[2:17:51] into the audience because i believe
[2:17:53] these are holy moments that we should
[2:17:55] never interfere
[2:17:56] this is between each and everyone i will
[2:17:58] close my eyes the same way
[2:18:00] but my desire is really to live for the
[2:18:03] honor and the glory of god
[2:18:07] being a message minister not to act like
[2:18:10] a denominational pentecostal baby
[2:18:14] but being a man of god who understood
[2:18:17] things in life
[2:18:18] let me have patience with me myself and
[2:18:21] let me have patience with others let me
[2:18:24] have grace for those who criticize me
[2:18:28] let me have a feeling for those who
[2:18:29] doesn't have feelings
[2:18:31] let me have an open hand for those
[2:18:34] who don't see the light anymore
[2:18:36] let me have grace let me be
[2:18:38] a person who can
[2:18:40] stand in the gap because i understand
[2:18:43] the need of my brother in need of my
[2:18:45] sister
[2:18:46] lord
[2:18:48] don't let me be just a
[2:18:51] giving just commands what is wrong we
[2:18:54] all see what's wrong
[2:18:55] it's not very difficult to see what's
[2:18:57] wrong but let us be men and women
[2:19:00] standing in the gap
[2:19:02] and if we see something wrong and our
[2:19:03] brother or sister stand before the
[2:19:05] throne and ask for mercy
[2:19:07] and take the position of those angels as
[2:19:10] we heard this morning and so help my
[2:19:12] brother help my sister
[2:19:14] and help me myself to always keep my
[2:19:16] heart clean
[2:19:18] loving before you father
[2:19:21] lord and if there is something that is
[2:19:22] mispleasing you i don't speak about the
[2:19:24] things of the world of television
[2:19:26] whatever
[2:19:27] that's bad but don't
[2:19:30] let even worldly thinking political

[2:19:36] free man of god
[2:19:38] following
[2:19:39] let me never be intimidated by nobody
[2:19:43] but let me stand before you that when
[2:19:45] pilate came and said are you a king and
[2:19:47] you can say yes i'm the son of a king
[2:19:51] just in earthly vessels but in me i'm a
[2:19:54] son of the almighty
[2:19:56] father take our hands

[2:20:10] presence
[2:20:11] to act like you to think like you
[2:20:14] and heavenly father i'm so
[2:20:16] minded about that
[2:20:18] fact that even the angels were waiting
[2:20:21] for six days
[2:20:23] until that boy who was an unbeliever
[2:20:26] who was set free from the electrical
[2:20:28] chair that was your spirit
[2:20:31] you were commanding those angels waiting
[2:20:33] on the prophet heavenly father let us
[2:20:35] have
[2:20:37] that same attitude for those
[2:20:40] who don't know who they are maybe they
[2:20:42] are
[2:20:43] very nasty to us but don't let us be
[2:20:45] back nasty we're sons of a king we're
[2:20:47] different
[2:20:48] so we ask your father for the service

[2:23:22] he's
[2:23:23] [Music]
[2:23:36] amen
[2:23:39] amen how many been encouraged by the
[2:23:40] word
[2:23:42] and also challenged by the word
[2:23:45] amen it's a challenge to come up higher
[2:23:47] in the life of christ
[2:23:49] amen
[2:23:50] what good is the word if it doesn't
[2:23:52] change our lives
[2:23:54] what was the point of the message to
[2:23:56] bring us an identification so we could
[2:23:58] keep acting the way we always acted
[2:24:00] and continue on acting the way we acted
[2:24:03] in denominations but
[2:24:05] i believe it was to reproduce the life
[2:24:06] of jesus christ in bright form
[2:24:09] that she becomes a reflection of him
[2:24:12] and all we can say is god help us
[2:24:14] [Music]
[2:24:16] god help us
[2:24:17] what we desire is to be your
[2:24:20] representation on the earth the
[2:24:22] ambassador from heaven lord but god we
[2:24:25] need your help amen
[2:24:27] come into the life born wrong
[2:24:30] raised in what we were raised in heard
[2:24:32] what we've heard experienced what we've
[2:24:33] experienced
[2:24:35] but all we can say is god help us
[2:24:38] this is our desire
[2:24:40] but i believe one thing for sure
[2:24:42] if our desire matches his desire
[2:24:45] we can have what we ask for amen
[2:24:48] amen how many believe that's his desire
[2:24:51] to have himself manifested in a
[2:24:52] mini-membered bride
[2:24:54] so i believe our desire matches his
[2:24:57] desire
[2:24:58] and i'd like to say lord manifest
[2:25:00] yourself in me
[2:25:02] knock off those parts that need knocked
[2:25:04] off lord
[2:25:06] amen bring out the parts that need
[2:25:08] brought out but lord don't let me
[2:25:10] continue on
[2:25:12] in a way that's not pleasing to you
[2:25:15] amen the bible said jesus christ went
[2:25:17] about doing good
[2:25:18] [Music]
[2:25:21] so jesus christ is
[2:25:22] is on earth again in a many bitter body
[2:25:25] what should she be doing amen going
[2:25:28] about and doing good
[2:25:30] amen
[2:25:31] i say god i'll give you this body if
[2:25:32] you'll take it amen
[2:25:34] i'll give you my life if you'll take it
[2:25:36] you've got some work to do amen i can't
[2:25:39] do it only you can do it there's a work
[2:25:41] cut out for you lord but if you want
[2:25:42] this body you can have it amen if you
[2:25:45] want this life you can have it and i
[2:25:47] don't know how you'll do it there's a
[2:25:48] lot of work yet to be done but if you
[2:25:50] want a vessel to live through i'll give
[2:25:52] you this one amen but you've got to do
[2:25:54] the work i can't do it amen all i can do
[2:25:56] is give it to you you're going to have
[2:25:58] to supply your spirit
[2:26:00] and manifest your word amen
[2:26:03] and i believe if that prayer matches
[2:26:05] god's heart
[2:26:07] and
[2:26:08] two desires match his and yours
[2:26:11] i believe he'll give us what we ask for
[2:26:13] amen
[2:26:15] amen god's been good to us friends
[2:26:18] i love the word of the lord i love when
[2:26:20] the word
[2:26:21] corrects i love when it admonishes i
[2:26:23] wonder i love it when it encourages i
[2:26:24] love it when it calls us the eagles to
[2:26:26] fly a little higher
[2:26:29] god is so good amen when you start
[2:26:31] flying he said that's good you're flying
[2:26:33] praise god i'm proud of you you're
[2:26:34] flying now let's come just a little bit
[2:26:36] higher amen
[2:26:39] and we thought we were already flying as
[2:26:41] high as we could fly we thought we made
[2:26:43] it to the top
[2:26:44] but then god always raises the top and
[2:26:46] says okay now fly a little higher
[2:26:49] and he's proud of us each time we move
[2:26:51] amen
[2:26:53] but i think god for us i think what
[2:26:55] we're seeing
[2:26:56] is he's raising the top again
[2:26:59] and he wants us to fly a little higher
[2:27:02] and i say god

[2:27:51] to see you in the morning
[2:27:53] amen let's just bow our heads and thank
[2:27:55] the lord for his word
[2:27:59] lord jesus i thank you for your word
[2:28:01] lord
[2:28:02] i thank you god on how you take a vessel
[2:28:05] of clay and you use it lord in such a
[2:28:07] supernatural way
[2:28:09] for god we can realize it's not the clay
[2:28:11] it must be you
[2:28:13] nor we just ask god that you would help
[2:28:15] us to match
[2:28:17] the picture you've painted in your word
[2:28:20] god you were so good to us that when you
[2:28:22] brought a wave sheath on the earth in
[2:28:23] our day
[2:28:25] you plucked up the first part of the
[2:28:26] word to come to harvest maturity and
[2:28:29] that part of the word came to maturity
[2:28:31] in a vessel that was the prophet of the
[2:28:33] age and you waved it over the
[2:28:35] congregation
[2:28:36] and you didn't wave it over as to say
[2:28:38] here's what you must be you must be
[2:28:40] perfect see if you can attain to this
[2:28:41] but you waved it over showing that the
[2:28:44] same word that brought this to maturity
[2:28:46] will bring the rest of the crop to
[2:28:48] maturity
[2:28:49] so god you've already shown that you can
[2:28:52] live your life and man you've already
[2:28:54] showed that there can be human flesh
[2:28:56] that can reflect your very life your
[2:28:57] very nature your very power commit and
[2:29:00] can be the word made flesh in their day
[2:29:02] and you did it in our brother william
[2:29:04] branham and you waved that before us to
[2:29:06] show us not that we have to climb to
[2:29:08] this but to show us that whatever
[2:29:10] brought him here will bring you here too
[2:29:13] and we believe that lord we have
[2:29:15] confidence in that process that by the
[2:29:17] bright shining light of this august sun
[2:29:19] you will bring us into rapture maturity
[2:29:22] lord
[2:29:24] god i pray that you'd help us lay in the
[2:29:26] presence of this son and bake all the
[2:29:28] greenness out of us lord
[2:29:31] that we might be all that portion of the
[2:29:33] word you've predestinated for this day
[2:29:36] to manifest your life
[2:29:38] we believe it we accept it by faith we
[2:29:41] allow the process to work in us lord and
[2:29:44] we have confidence that you will do what
[2:29:45] you said you will do
[2:29:48] oh how we love you lord how much you
[2:29:50] have blessed us lord
[2:29:52] help us god to just keep continually
[2:29:54] giving you our lives that you might take
[2:29:57] us in your hand
[2:29:58] and do with us things beyond what we
[2:30:00] could do ourselves
[2:30:02] we trust in you we pray you bless us as
[2:30:04] we go from here may the things that
[2:30:06] we've heard the things you've shared
[2:30:07] with us may they not fade away from us
[2:30:09] when we walk out those doors but may
[2:30:11] they become part of who we are lord and
[2:30:13] may we carry this with us for the rest
[2:30:15] of our lives
[2:30:17] dear heavenly father we just pray that
[2:30:19] you would bless us if there is a
[2:30:21] tomorrow and you ordain it so may we
[2:30:22] come back tomorrow lord to hear your
[2:30:24] word again
[2:30:25] may we continue lord to walk with you

[2:30:31] we love you father we thank you for your
[2:30:33] goodness
[2:30:34] we give you glory and honor and praise
[2:30:36] for it all

[2:30:40] amen
