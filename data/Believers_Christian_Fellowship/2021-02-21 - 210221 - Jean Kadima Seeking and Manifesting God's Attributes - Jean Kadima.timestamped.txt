[6:54] of prayer
[6:57] heavenly father we thank you
[7:02] that we can approach you this morning
[7:05] speak about your father you could let
[7:09] the moon preach
[7:10] the stars the trees but you decided
[7:14] you will use a man father i
[7:17] feel very little and no matter how
[7:21] i can prepare father i never felt
[7:24] feel good enough
[7:28] so just come down in your power of
[7:31] resurrection and speak to your children
[7:33] father when you do it is
[7:38] better so i ask you to
[7:43] guide us to be with us rather to uh
[7:46] feed us yourself from the manner the
[7:50] manner from above
[7:51] granted father i commit myself to you
[7:55] in jesus christ's name amen
[8:00] as we are standing up let's go to
[8:03] bible thank you musicians um brother
[8:06] franco
[8:07] if i can have the
[8:10] powerpoint colossians chapter 3
[8:16] verse 1
[8:24] if ye then be risen
[8:27] with christ seek those things which
[8:30] are above where christ
[8:33] sitteth on the right hand of god
[8:38] set your affection on things
[8:41] above not on things
[8:45] on the earth
[8:50] for ye are dead and your life is hid
[8:55] with christ in god when christ who is
[8:58] our life
[8:59] shall appear then shall he also appear
[9:02] with him
[9:03] in glory may god at his blessing to the
[9:06] reading of the word
[9:08] you may be seated
[9:17] i want to talk this morning about
[9:20] seeking and manifesting god's attribute
[9:26] seeking and manifesting god attributes
[9:31] um maybe let me read something that
[9:34] brother branham says
[9:35] in
[9:36] [Music]
[9:38] a message the the questions and answers
[9:41] in 1962
[9:45] but when you raise above
[9:49] that to heavenly things
[9:52] then set your affections on things above
[9:55] because
[9:55] you are reason with christ and now sit
[9:59] sit it together in heavenly places just
[10:02] rest assured not a
[10:04] thing can harm you not a thing even
[10:07] death itself
[10:08] has no can do a thing to you you already
[10:12] anchored in christ the assurance that
[10:14] the earnest
[10:16] the down payment's already been brought
[10:19] you've been
[10:20] you've accepted it uh what did you do
[10:23] raise up with him
[10:25] in resurrection
[10:28] that's where i'm gonna focus a lot of
[10:31] things
[10:31] come to my mind let's just god um
[10:35] pick what you want for his children
[10:38] this morning yeah it looks like
[10:42] a we have a dual life
[10:45] we are you are a dual being
[10:48] because uh when you look at it the
[10:51] scripture shows that
[10:52] everything that christ did you did it
[10:55] too
[10:57] when you die you die when you went to
[11:00] the grave you went to the grave you rise
[11:03] up you did
[11:04] rise up and uh
[11:09] then he say that these cities on the
[11:11] right hand of
[11:12] god the power of god you sitting
[11:16] with him he says
[11:19] so he say well if that's the case then
[11:22] set your affection from the things above
[11:25] because you are
[11:26] above and that brings us
[11:29] to recognize that
[11:32] we are a dual being
[11:37] one portion of us is on the earth that
[11:39] what you see
[11:42] the other portion is up there
[11:45] i am up there that makes me a
[11:49] mystical being
[11:53] one day i am one day i'm gone
[11:57] when he gives me the body change i'm
[11:59] gone who am
[12:00] i you've never seen me i never seen you
[12:06] duo being
[12:10] and when you are you being
[12:14] so and that's the that's why the
[12:17] scripture now say that
[12:19] being duo you will have to lean
[12:22] on one world or the other
[12:26] and he say well that one is the most
[12:30] important because
[12:34] over there you have your theophany that
[12:36] is
[12:37] looking straight at god
[12:40] is in the presence of god here this life
[12:43] is important we have
[12:45] things that we love we find dear
[12:49] but it's not really about the this
[12:53] earth it's more about the
[12:56] cosmos the system
[12:59] of this world so turn your affection to
[13:03] the
[13:03] system of above the kingdom of god that
[13:08] is above
[13:09] and the kingdom of god is made of the
[13:11] world
[13:13] and the strength of the earth are the
[13:16] cosmos the world
[13:18] system you live in it you have your
[13:21] filial love here then then i will say to
[13:24] you
[13:25] that set your affection
[13:28] uh above means uh
[13:31] lean more towards the kingdom above
[13:36] and this at the kingdom here
[13:40] will be neglected a little bit
[13:46] amen
[13:50] so how are we going to do that
[13:54] because it's attainable not because it's
[13:58] our effort to learn
[14:02] to all the other kingdom the kingdom of
[14:05] god
[14:06] it's not through our efforts
[14:09] it's attainable not by effort but
[14:12] because
[14:13] god has made provision
[14:17] is not a merit we heard it for the last
[14:20] two weeks two months is wonderful
[14:24] it's not on the merit basis
[14:28] it is already there potentially like a
[14:32] mother ego
[14:33] is calling his children or is the child
[14:36] that was
[14:37] uh forgotten the egg that was forgotten
[14:40] in the barnyard
[14:42] you know the story she's screaming
[14:46] to her say you are from above
[14:51] come up higher and the child said how
[14:55] can i do it
[14:56] but you say you have everything you need
[14:59] to do it you have two wings just to use
[15:03] them
[15:04] the potential is already there
[15:07] just use it that's what preachers do
[15:11] preachers preach that they are just
[15:14] like transmitters brother badam says we
[15:17] just trust me just to tell you what
[15:19] the mother ego is saying
[15:22] all right so we don't have our own
[15:26] message
[15:28] but we just say uh we transmit like
[15:31] for the engineers here it will be like a
[15:34] signal boosters that's what preachers
[15:38] are
[15:40] all right we just make the signal to get
[15:44] far enough but the signal is not
[15:48] generated by
[15:48] us and we just tell people what they
[15:53] already have
[15:55] you know you can do it you can use it
[15:58] not by
[15:58] effort because it's there we're just
[16:01] reminding you that you have it already
[16:05] you have two wings
[16:09] yes you can live a little bit on earth
[16:11] but your life is
[16:12] up there and you have a
[16:16] a big a strong beak
[16:19] you can eat meat actually you playing
[16:23] with
[16:23] these chickens in the back barnyard
[16:27] in a few days they will be your dinner
[16:34] and
[16:37] and the little ego say yeah that's funny
[16:40] you say that
[16:40] the other day i was dreaming eating a
[16:43] chicken
[16:45] i thought something is wrong with me
[16:50] that i'm some sort of a cannibal
[16:54] but church is true that if you look in
[16:57] your life
[16:59] you see something you see something that
[17:02] was there
[17:04] even though you were living all kind of
[17:06] things
[17:07] but there was just something that was
[17:09] crying out
[17:11] so then when the mother say yes you have
[17:14] a big you have
[17:15] wings she he just say yes
[17:19] yeah you just respond to the world
[17:22] because you are you are of the nature
[17:26] of the word yes
[17:31] and not by an effort not by merit
[17:36] even when we preach and we give the
[17:40] impression of we give the perception
[17:43] that
[17:43] his salvation is a merit it's it's awful
[17:47] oh god help me never never
[17:51] i'll pay attention but it's not about
[17:54] me pay attention paying attention is the
[17:56] holy ghost
[17:57] help me is not god has
[18:00] put everything already in us
[18:04] the fin in the back of a fish
[18:07] was there because god knew there would
[18:09] be water
[18:12] do you believe that yes we don't have to
[18:15] manufacture
[18:17] when you say come up higher
[18:20] we go higher we just respond to the
[18:24] mother ego
[18:27] lean toward one kingdom because if you
[18:30] set affection toward one you will
[18:33] neglect the other
[18:35] jacob did it right when jacob
[18:39] affection was set to rachel
[18:42] guess what happened to leah and that's
[18:45] what we're talking about now we need
[18:49] to eat more of the word of god
[18:53] the more we eat then there is no room
[18:57] for other things
[18:59] then when the weather comes and say room
[19:02] for
[19:03] dessert we say oh too late
[19:08] so because i already ate the most
[19:11] nutritive how can you say that
[19:14] food so i don't have a room for the uh
[19:19] delicious evil dessert
[19:25] it's just me who sometimes loves just to
[19:28] eat those desserts
[19:32] that cream sugar
[19:35] so good i can just spend
[19:38] one day thinking maybe spend one day
[19:42] not eating the real food just
[19:45] those delicious kind of evil
[19:50] the way to ask do you have a room not
[19:52] too late i'm full
[19:55] if we keep eating the word and the word
[19:58] and the word then there is
[19:59] no there is less room for this
[20:02] other kingdom so you see it's not
[20:06] our effort it's just if we love him we
[20:09] love him
[20:10] we eat his word we consume absorb it
[20:14] keep going keep going the rest the world
[20:17] this other world will start
[20:20] deeming
[20:25] that's right that's what he's saying
[20:31] remember the devil will never let you do
[20:34] that
[20:36] it's a it's a battle it's going to bring
[20:38] all kind of
[20:40] things all kind of work
[20:43] destruction and things but he's doing
[20:46] what he's supposed to do
[20:48] it is a formidable
[20:51] adversary yeah
[20:55] and we have to do what the lord asked us
[20:57] to do
[20:58] i want to talk uh
[21:02] i want to focus today on on an attribute
[21:05] of
[21:06] god because if
[21:09] we we turn
[21:12] our love our affection we set them on
[21:15] things of above
[21:17] which is the word
[21:21] we will start displaying the things of
[21:25] the above
[21:26] amen we will start to displaying
[21:31] god's attributes they will just come
[21:34] because
[21:35] the word god is the word
[21:38] so if you are with god you
[21:41] display his attributes i don't know how
[21:44] well to say
[21:45] this okay and
[21:48] many times when we think about god
[21:50] attributes
[21:51] we think about attribute of love and
[21:55] attribute of salvation
[21:58] and and all this is really good
[22:02] i want to talk about the attribute of a
[22:04] judge
[22:07] we don't talk about that um
[22:12] because you know i can just
[22:15] see you all quiet yeah
[22:18] that's exactly right because who does
[22:21] talk about judge
[22:23] or god being a judge or supreme judge
[22:27] it's kind of scary because when we look
[22:30] ourself
[22:31] we don't measure up okay so
[22:34] why do i have to talk about the judge i
[22:37] want to talk about salve
[22:39] the savior the redeemer
[22:42] the healer the sacrifice
[22:46] don't talk to me about the judge
[22:50] because when i when you talk about the
[22:52] judge i see myself already
[22:54] condemned so it's normal we get
[22:57] a little quiet and a little wary where
[23:00] is he going
[23:04] we we want to talk about god's mercy and
[23:07] his love
[23:09] and we truly want to do that
[23:12] but the attribute of the judge
[23:16] if you dig a little bit at least the way
[23:20] i received it um it's good
[23:23] because when we we fear the judge
[23:27] because we have also loved ones
[23:30] that are not safe is that right so when
[23:33] you talk about judgment or the judge you
[23:37] feel like
[23:37] oh i have loved one that are not saved
[23:40] and don't bring up that subject
[23:43] i've been praying all every day for
[23:46] for them and you know i was actually
[23:49] listening to brother brennan
[23:52] um not long ago maybe i was coming to
[23:55] church
[23:56] and he talked about the loved one being
[23:58] saved he said
[23:59] in a message in 62 a testimony on the
[24:04] the sea he said now if you want to save
[24:08] your husband or
[24:09] your wife just keep praying for them
[24:12] just keep praying
[24:13] that's all you have to do just keep
[24:15] praying and believing if there's
[24:17] any spark of life there at all
[24:21] god will put something across the path
[24:24] that they will
[24:25] see it i was when i get
[24:29] i read this or listen to this i was like
[24:32] god will stop the course of
[24:36] the life the way the life has been
[24:39] going god will stop it and then
[24:42] god will do something tremendous
[24:46] maybe the thing that made them go away
[24:49] from the message
[24:51] god will correct it
[24:55] and show them clearly
[24:58] and at that point they will have to make
[25:01] a decision
[25:02] so your prayers will make
[25:05] that happen so keep praying keep praying
[25:08] and one day god
[25:10] will actually stop the course of the
[25:13] life
[25:14] and answer the question and then at that
[25:18] point they will make a decision
[25:20] and and pray that they don't reject it
[25:24] because this is what i'm saying then if
[25:26] they reject it that's up to them
[25:29] you see maybe god will take that
[25:33] burden from you
[25:37] after they have been placed in front
[25:40] of the true clearly you say brother
[25:44] how is it possible the burden will never
[25:46] go away
[25:50] but god is always right
[25:53] do your part and god will bring the word
[25:56] to them
[25:57] so but
[26:00] judgment is not always
[26:05] maybe not what we always hear when we
[26:08] talk about
[26:09] attribute of a judge
[26:13] don't you know that you want to bring
[26:16] your enemy to the judge
[26:20] is that right okay and you want the
[26:23] judge
[26:24] to uh give you a victory right
[26:28] right so that aspect of the judge
[26:32] don't you love it i want to bring my
[26:36] enemy to him
[26:40] and that's what david i think when you
[26:42] read it it's like
[26:43] i am i'm a righteous
[26:46] give me victory upon my enemy
[26:50] now we know that we have
[26:53] two type of enemy one enemy
[26:58] satan lucifer is
[27:01] actually the smallest enemy because
[27:04] brother bynum says you can defeat him
[27:08] in anywhere any place anytime
[27:13] using the word of god so he's not the
[27:16] biggest
[27:17] enemy formidable adversary
[27:20] adversary but is not the biggest
[27:25] but the enemy that i want to bring to
[27:27] the judge
[27:28] is this person
[27:31] are you with me i want to bring that
[27:34] this uh this person who's standing god
[27:37] way i want to bring
[27:39] him to the judge and say god
[27:42] give me victory upon this enemy
[27:48] amen so
[27:52] remember taro is uh seeking to uh
[27:57] attribute of god and manifesting them
[28:02] god one of the god attributes is the
[28:04] judge
[28:05] first corinthians chapter 6 says do we
[28:09] do ye not know that the saints shall
[28:12] judge the world
[28:13] and if the world shall be judged by you
[28:16] i are ye unworthy to judge the smallest
[28:20] matters
[28:23] not knowing not that we shall judge
[28:26] angels
[28:27] how much more things that pertain to
[28:30] this life
[28:33] so the thing is if we
[28:36] are risen of christ hidden in
[28:39] our life hidden with him
[28:43] what he is we are
[28:46] if he's a judge we are judges
[28:49] so we will not wait until
[28:53] the end then he start handing out
[28:56] certificate you are a judge now
[28:59] so one day as our pastor used to say
[29:03] one day we will become judges
[29:07] or do we want it now
[29:11] the attribute of judge
[29:14] have to manifest now
[29:18] not one day i will be this
[29:25] do we agree or not
[29:26] [Music]
[29:28] so because we will judge even angels
[29:32] so how can we do that again there is
[29:36] nothing
[29:37] that i will bring to you that is new
[29:40] is continue getting the word of god
[29:43] in the word of god are the attributes of
[29:52] god let me just
[29:54] go uh this way
[29:58] a good judge discerned you know in
[30:01] israel kings
[30:05] were also judges do we agree
[30:09] if you're a king you judge your people
[30:12] so to be a good judge you have to
[30:15] discern
[30:16] the case and say
[30:19] there's something wrong here and that's
[30:22] what the
[30:24] solomon asked god and say god
[30:27] give me that uh
[30:31] give me wisdom so i can judge your
[30:34] people and brother abraham turns
[30:37] around and say that gift that solomon
[30:40] had
[30:40] was to discern what gives us a
[30:44] discernment
[30:45] is the word of god because it's like a
[30:49] a sharp two aged sword if we have the
[30:52] word of god then we will have a
[30:54] discernment
[30:55] then we will discern things that are
[30:57] happening in our own life
[31:00] things that happen in our homes you know
[31:04] we can discern that oh i can see
[31:07] through this movies that are start
[31:10] coming in my house i'm opening the door
[31:14] to satan
[31:16] your discernment from the word of god
[31:18] tells you
[31:19] don't do that you are opening the door
[31:23] actually you you are on the door as a
[31:26] father
[31:27] to protect the whole family but
[31:30] suddenly you lack uh discernment
[31:34] and you let think inside the house
[31:37] amen a good judge will discern that this
[31:42] spirit is uh the spirit of the devil is
[31:45] attacking this family so
[31:49] those when i think about these things
[31:52] other things come to me this you can see
[31:55] brother branham
[31:57] is his daughter two years old
[32:00] she's crying screaming all the time they
[32:03] cannot sleep and all that
[32:05] then i don't think that i don't remember
[32:08] that it was a discernment by
[32:11] by a gift or something but it's just a
[32:14] discern
[32:15] that the devil is attacking his ministry
[32:19] two years old child crying
[32:22] is actually the devil attacking his
[32:25] ministry
[32:26] that's what we need we need that
[32:28] discernment
[32:30] and it is an attribute of god
[32:34] and we get it by receiving the word
[32:37] without
[32:40] restriction
[32:42] amen we just yield
[32:46] your yield yielding is giving the right
[32:49] of way
[32:50] for cars right you see the sign
[32:53] you just yield it's not a big deal
[32:57] and that's how it should be when the
[32:59] word says we just yield it
[33:02] and we show our love to it and it gives
[33:05] us discernment to see
[33:06] faith because when you get to you get
[33:10] the word of god
[33:11] even your eyes the way you see things
[33:14] is like a god it starts becoming like
[33:17] god
[33:18] you see i say this because we're still
[33:20] human
[33:22] so so the more you get to the word of
[33:25] god your eyes
[33:26] keep changing amen
[33:30] then you start discerning things better
[33:34] when people don't see anything you see
[33:37] it
[33:38] because you are an eagle your eyes can
[33:40] see where
[33:42] normal eyes don't see
[33:46] do we agree
[33:51] actually discernment is very important
[33:56] whatever i'm saying in discerning the
[33:58] body of
[33:59] the lord you say in 1959
[34:02] now our eternal destination is not all
[34:05] together determined by what we
[34:08] see and what we hear but it's determined
[34:11] on what discernment we have of what we
[34:14] see and what we hear
[34:18] actually will determine where we go oh
[34:22] we heard something we came to church
[34:27] and we went back and he didn't do
[34:30] anything
[34:32] oh my i don't want to praise our church
[34:36] or do something but you come here
[34:39] spend a month too and go and say
[34:43] it's just the same no
[34:47] no i've been in this message for many
[34:49] years
[34:51] now god has been gracious to us
[34:56] he has raised our level amen
[35:00] it's for a purpose not for us to go
[35:02] around
[35:05] no is
[35:08] to give us the god's attributes
[35:14] amen display them his reason is sitting
[35:17] on the right hand
[35:19] the bible even say that it will be
[35:22] revealed
[35:24] and we will also be revealed
[35:29] we he has revealed himself
[35:33] now hallelujah
[35:37] we have to display those attributes
[35:41] now amen
[35:44] the world is waiting for those
[35:46] attributes to be manifested
[35:48] the nature is screaming crying oh where
[35:51] are the sons of god
[35:53] i want them now display the attributes
[35:57] of god
[35:58] amen can i become religious a little bit
[36:02] amen you know
[36:08] like army in the army they say
[36:10] permission
[36:11] to speak sir say go ahead
[36:19] sorry i gotta do that
[36:24] ah wow after this
[36:28] i won't need to run on my treadmill
[36:33] all right hebrews 4
[36:37] 12 for the word of god is quick
[36:41] and powerful and sharper than any
[36:44] two-edged sword
[36:45] piercing even to dividing asunder
[36:48] of soul and spirit and of the joints and
[36:52] marrow and is the discern of the
[36:55] thoughts and intents of
[36:57] the heart ah
[37:00] a judge has a spirit of
[37:03] discernment it can discern things that
[37:07] people don't see
[37:11] the world is praising this but
[37:15] the discernment of the word tells you no
[37:17] that's not that
[37:23] do we agree amen
[37:26] let me move on a a good judge is
[37:30] no respecter of persons
[37:34] is that right that's what makes them the
[37:36] good
[37:40] the more you get the word of god
[37:45] you get that that attribute
[37:48] is my brother is my sister maybe we're
[37:51] not always
[37:52] together but it's my brother is my
[37:55] sister i hear that
[37:56] they got a problem are gonna pray about
[37:58] it
[38:00] sincerely no respecter
[38:03] of persons that's what the scripture
[38:06] says
[38:06] act chapter 10 34
[38:10] then peter opened his mouth and said
[38:13] of truth i perceive that god is no
[38:17] respecter
[38:18] of persons but in every nation
[38:21] he that fear him and worketh
[38:25] righteousness is accepted with him
[38:30] yes that's
[38:33] god is not so
[38:38] god doesn't say well you are
[38:41] young therefore what do you have to
[38:44] say no oh you are a woman
[38:48] god doesn't even do that actually when
[38:51] you talk
[38:51] men and women is in in in term of
[38:55] the order in term of
[38:58] odor god does that you can take
[39:03] god has an order in the house god has an
[39:05] order in a church
[39:07] but as to
[39:10] respect of people no
[39:14] i was i was actually uh
[39:17] looking at this aspect of things you
[39:19] know brother bernhard had
[39:20] thousand thousand of visions he saw the
[39:23] angel in in person he saw he
[39:27] he went through a lot of things but i
[39:29] realized that when
[39:30] brother bran someone a brother
[39:34] comes to him and tell him something that
[39:36] god told him
[39:38] he appreciated very much
[39:42] when he comes from somebody else than
[39:45] himself he appreciated very much
[39:50] and then i i saw that he was sick you
[39:53] know how brother brennan went in a
[39:54] cycle of sickness seven days is sick
[39:58] seven years every time he's sickened
[40:01] is so emanciated he's
[40:04] is so you know has this burned his
[40:09] in this praying and god is
[40:13] answering his prayer for other people
[40:15] but not for him
[40:18] he needs somebody to he needs
[40:22] comfort he need and then god
[40:25] chooses who to tell him about it
[40:29] a woman
[40:32] a sister she come to church she she
[40:36] she's sick verbum lays hand on her
[40:40] and then as whatever is
[40:43] living she sees the man
[40:48] in a white robe
[40:52] and the men look at uh at her and say oh
[40:56] let me just go to it the angel of god
[41:01] 19 when when you was praying this is the
[41:05] husband telling brother brandon what
[41:06] happened that day
[41:07] she seemed like she was in a trance
[41:10] until we got home and she asked me
[41:13] who was that other man that came
[41:17] come down there with you when you were
[41:20] praying for her
[41:24] and i said there was no other man say oh
[41:26] yes
[41:27] the woman said yes a man
[41:31] with the white robe on with dark and on
[41:35] with dark hair i say say say
[41:38] that again brother i say that's brother
[41:41] branham say that again again
[41:42] say that again brother and he say it
[41:45] again
[41:45] i say that is the angel of the lord that
[41:49] appeared
[41:50] see she said why it was
[41:53] looking down upon brother branham when
[41:56] he was praying
[41:58] and said he talked to me and he said now
[42:03] you are looking for healing say brother
[42:05] brahms
[42:06] prayer will be answered you will be
[42:08] healed
[42:10] but say doesn't brother branham look
[42:12] awful
[42:14] frail say
[42:16] but you will be strong after a while so
[42:19] that give me encouragement
[42:21] see he will be strong after a while
[42:24] a woman it should be by the both
[42:27] worlds by the baxter brother
[42:32] lindsey lindsay or any
[42:36] big minister no
[42:39] a sister because god is no respecter of
[42:44] people
[42:45] if you serve him you'll be blessed by
[42:47] him
[42:49] amen do we agree
[42:52] yes that's true it is no respect
[42:59] amen he's a good judge
[43:02] and he say we will manifest those
[43:05] attributes
[43:07] god granted to me
[43:10] to manifest those attributes
[43:16] a good judge is fair
[43:20] he has a fairness
[43:23] is that right yeah
[43:26] this is not an attribute we go to god
[43:29] and say to god
[43:33] god be fair
[43:37] no i know why i say this you will see it
[43:40] in a while
[43:42] when god says
[43:49] god's love is uh elective love we don't
[43:53] go and pick it on his door and say how
[43:56] can you say that
[43:59] because when we hear god love is
[44:01] elective we say
[44:02] amen
[44:06] we don't say that's not fair
[44:10] we say amen to that
[44:14] i'm saying this because
[44:17] not everybody does that you remember
[44:20] brother
[44:21] billy paul testimony where a man brought
[44:24] to his boss
[44:27] brother message book and the boss
[44:30] read and say this man is calling me
[44:33] a buzzard and the men
[44:37] say but it's calling me an ego
[44:41] is that right
[44:45] so oh my yeah
[44:51] i was in a charlotte not long ago
[44:54] and the pastor was preaching and saying
[44:57] he caught by the venomous say eight
[44:59] people maybe
[45:01] saved and he says he's not even sure
[45:04] that handful will be
[45:06] and the pastor say okay well
[45:10] uh eight people of course brother barum
[45:12] talks about
[45:13] a lot of things about that he said eight
[45:16] people he count himself his wife
[45:18] his children his
[45:21] father uh his son-in-law
[45:28] then account he was eighteen he said
[45:30] what that
[45:31] leaves you
[45:32] [Music]
[45:34] where that leaves you and
[45:38] but the reality is when the prophet said
[45:40] to us if it's one
[45:42] you must say it's me therefore you
[45:46] cannot say to god
[45:47] that's not fair i won't go to church
[45:49] because eight people
[45:50] that will be almost a pastor's family
[45:56] with sister emily sorry sister
[46:03] and he did not say that he said you
[46:05] gotta put yourself in
[46:07] let god do is mathematic because god is
[46:10] the one who creates mathematic
[46:12] so if the if we say one
[46:16] i go because actually the problem is him
[46:19] with
[46:19] himself if i'm not with him
[46:23] is not complete therefore i don't care
[46:26] about numbers
[46:28] i care to be found in faith
[46:33] faith of the word of god in this time
[46:40] amen now
[46:44] what i'm when i was talking about
[46:48] fairness all that i was thinking about
[46:50] satan
[46:52] and his children those are the ones
[46:55] always go to god as a judge
[46:59] but for fairness yeah
[47:05] that's how they that the they are the
[47:07] one
[47:08] look genesis chapter 4 verse
[47:11] 13 and cain said unto the lord after he
[47:16] slew
[47:16] abel now he's in the presence of god you
[47:19] and i after we did anything we go into
[47:23] the presence of god
[47:24] oh my the first thing is god be merciful
[47:28] to me
[47:30] i know i did it last time i'm doing it
[47:34] right now but be meant for to me that's
[47:37] the first thing
[47:39] but you see cain comes in the presence
[47:42] of god
[47:43] you remember i am i the keeper of my
[47:46] brother
[47:48] they have such a courage
[47:51] and when when when john sees the prank
[47:55] god he falls down like a dead
[48:00] his majesty how
[48:03] great that was
[48:06] but look a king i don't know where my
[48:10] brother is
[48:11] liar am i the keeper of my brother
[48:15] liar how much how can you have such a
[48:19] courage in the presence of
[48:22] the almighty god
[48:26] and when he goes there is concern
[48:30] about himself is
[48:33] self preservation
[48:37] and can say unto the lord my punishment
[48:40] is greater than i
[48:41] i can bear it's not fair isn't fair
[48:45] i wish i could speak better english like
[48:49] southern english in fair
[48:54] that's why he said he's calling upon the
[48:57] attribute of
[48:58] god as a judge
[49:02] but since he's already condemned
[49:06] he wants fairness
[49:12] behold thou has driven me out this
[49:15] day from the face of the earth and from
[49:17] the
[49:18] thy face shall be shall i be healed
[49:21] and i shall be a fugitive and a vegan
[49:25] in the earth and it shall come to pass
[49:28] that
[49:28] everyone that findeth me shall slay me
[49:34] i need self-preservation you must
[49:36] protect
[49:37] me and the lord said unto him therefore
[49:40] whosoever slayeth
[49:41] cain vengeance shall be taken on him
[49:45] sevenfold you see loving
[49:49] judge oh my
[49:52] and the lord set a mark upon cain lest
[49:55] any finding him should kill him god put
[49:59] the mark on cain and his
[50:03] children
[50:06] and cain went out from the presence of
[50:09] the lord
[50:10] and he just left
[50:14] no forgive me lord no and dwelt in the
[50:17] land of node
[50:18] on the east of eden
[50:21] it came to
[50:25] what i'm going to call it came looking
[50:28] for the
[50:29] rules of engagement
[50:33] the people that have been in the army
[50:35] may tell you about that
[50:38] one once one army defeated the other
[50:42] army
[50:43] there are some rules that apply
[50:46] you know so if you
[50:50] get some prisoners there are rules of
[50:53] geneve rules whatever the conventions
[50:57] and hague so what is coming to us
[51:00] god is the rules of engagement for
[51:03] self-preservation
[51:05] how can i survive live
[51:16] the rules of engagement when two armies
[51:19] before starting the war the two armies
[51:22] have to declare war and if they are
[51:26] children and civilians
[51:29] oh you gotta protect them
[51:34] that rules of engagement is that why he
[51:37] came
[51:37] he said i'm a defeated army
[51:41] i'm wounded you gotta protect me
[51:51] you and i
[51:54] our life is already hidden in christ
[51:58] yes oh my
[52:03] cain my punishment is
[52:06] greater so basically say to god
[52:09] your judgment was not fair
[52:16] what a courage they have
[52:19] no wonder god say don't lean
[52:22] toward that kingdom lean toward
[52:26] this kingdom
[52:30] rules of engagement
[52:35] treatment of prisoners of war that's why
[52:38] i say i'm a prisoner of
[52:39] war
[52:42] you had to protect me
[52:47] i have the right not to believe the
[52:50] revelation
[52:53] i have the right to reject revelation
[52:56] i have the right to sin disbelief
[53:01] yes cain the right for to sin
[53:04] is one of the most protected right
[53:08] you have under the law in this country
[53:12] but the right to serve god and worship
[53:16] him
[53:16] you know according to the revelation
[53:20] ah brother banana pray that that's right
[53:25] let it last long whatever i'm saying
[53:29] lord let it last long
[53:33] and we will do the same we do the same
[53:36] prayer this
[53:37] this morning let it last long
[53:46] are you with me on this
[53:54] job chapter 1.
[54:01] job chapter 1 verse 9 then set an answer
[54:04] to the lord and
[54:05] say dost job fear god for nothing
[54:10] has not now made an age
[54:14] about him and about his house and and
[54:16] about all that he had
[54:18] on every side thou has to bless the work
[54:21] of his hands
[54:22] and the substances increase in his
[54:25] his land ain't fair
[54:30] you gave him all that's why he serve you
[54:34] but put forth thine hand now and touch
[54:37] all
[54:38] that he had and he will curse thee to
[54:41] thy face
[54:46] church when you look at
[54:49] the children of lucifer
[54:53] cain
[54:57] and so on it's when they approach
[55:01] god is about fairness
[55:07] you didn't give me a chance to touch job
[55:11] same thing happened to peter but take
[55:14] this scripture
[55:15] and match it with when satan told the
[55:19] satan came to god and say i want to sift
[55:23] peter sift him
[55:26] like a grain yeah he says it was the
[55:30] same thing he went there and said
[55:32] well he never been tested that peter
[55:35] has never been tested i want to test him
[55:39] it's always about fairness be careful
[55:42] church we love
[55:43] fairness but uh be careful
[55:48] amen the fairness is about
[55:51] self-preservation
[55:57] john chapter 12 i want to read much of
[55:59] it
[56:00] 12 is about the woman that brought this
[56:04] big perfume to i known to jesus
[56:09] and guess who saw it a problem
[56:14] 12 4 then sayeth one of his disciples
[56:18] judas is scared
[56:19] simon's son which should betray him
[56:23] why was not this anointment
[56:26] sold for 300 pence and given to the poor
[56:33] [Music]
[56:36] he has more love than god is that true
[56:40] no he doesn't it basically saying it's
[56:43] not
[56:43] fair to take all this perfume
[56:46] and use it for one man
[56:50] fairness they go to the judge for
[56:53] fairness
[56:54] but i was actually this is say not uh
[56:58] that he cared for the poor but because
[57:00] he was a thief
[57:02] and had the bag and bare what was put
[57:04] there
[57:06] it was taking the money oh
[57:10] but god is so god obey
[57:13] to his own laws
[57:19] he always has the fairness you saw how
[57:22] he treated cain
[57:23] he said i will protect you yeah
[57:28] and he does everything with that
[57:31] model in mind we kept the door of the
[57:36] ark for seven days
[57:39] he knew that nobody will get in but you
[57:42] could not
[57:42] accuse him of lack of fairness
[57:46] seven days the ark is open but nobody
[57:49] gets in
[57:50] there'll be a time like that
[57:53] but he will never be declared
[57:59] he does always things like that
[58:03] because he's a fair judge how can
[58:07] he get his children to recognize the
[58:11] world
[58:12] and give the opportunity to other
[58:15] children too so he is
[58:19] fair do you understand
[58:22] yeah that's why he has 1200
[58:25] messages on the internet
[58:30] everybody can read it because god is
[58:34] fair
[58:36] even our sermons in this church they are
[58:39] on the internet
[58:41] you think you are being blessed and all
[58:43] that but you know the lord
[58:46] whosoever wants can just go to archives
[58:51] but guess what they won't because
[58:56] god is hidden in the plain view
[58:59] because the judge it doesn't want to be
[59:01] blamed for
[59:02] anybody the message is there
[59:06] we preach openly
[59:09] but only his children will see others
[59:13] won't see
[59:15] but he's in a plain view
[59:18] how did god heed christ
[59:22] in the eyes of israel by putting
[59:26] god in a man and when israel saw a man
[59:31] there is a man
[59:34] how god is hiding christ from the
[59:38] gentiles church
[59:40] by putting in a man god in plain
[59:45] god view plain view okay let me change
[59:47] the gesture
[59:49] god in plain view god in plain view
[59:58] amen
[1:00:00] how does he do it
[1:00:04] oh okay should not
[1:00:08] read a lot of things because i'm slow
[1:00:12] i i i just read the bottom there it's
[1:00:15] some it's
[1:00:16] uh it's uh the thing sometimes
[1:00:19] we have to say things the church a way
[1:00:21] that it might
[1:00:22] thin down it might bring some to go out
[1:00:25] some to live and some to ponder over
[1:00:29] same message some take it
[1:00:33] stay with it and some will leave
[1:00:37] that's how it works but is there in the
[1:00:40] open
[1:00:42] open competition that's what cain is
[1:00:44] asking
[1:00:46] open competition shenanigans
[1:00:50] i'm so sorry i i'm still learning
[1:00:52] english so if i say a word that is not
[1:00:54] right
[1:00:57] all right
[1:01:02] but that's done god done that
[1:01:05] purposely it must be done that way then
[1:01:08] it might be that
[1:01:10] some would say you mean god will purpose
[1:01:13] to do a thing like that
[1:01:15] he certainly did he does yet
[1:01:18] he said one day when he was thousand
[1:01:20] around him he said except
[1:01:22] you eat the flesh of the son of man
[1:01:26] or son of god or son of man and drink
[1:01:28] his blood you have no life in you
[1:01:32] i was a message preached to everyone at
[1:01:34] the same time
[1:01:35] some say where can we go
[1:01:38] others say i'm not going to drink
[1:01:41] anybody's blood
[1:01:45] plain view that is fairness actually
[1:01:49] a big portion of my
[1:01:52] thought was on this because i came
[1:01:55] across
[1:01:55] this whoa look what
[1:01:58] satan looks for when you go to the lord
[1:02:02] it's a deep adoration
[1:02:06] sincere god i love you
[1:02:10] god you always forgive me without your
[1:02:13] grace where could i be
[1:02:16] you you appreciated him
[1:02:19] when they go he's like it's fair
[1:02:27] you don't treat me right
[1:02:38] same message that's what the gospel
[1:02:41] always
[1:02:41] does it opens the eyes of some reveals
[1:02:45] the truth to some
[1:02:46] why it blinds the others has a
[1:02:49] four twofold meaning uh
[1:02:53] some can take that sun and look straight
[1:02:56] into it and and go blind others can
[1:03:00] take it and walk out with it
[1:03:03] is the difference
[1:03:10] do we now agree god the judge
[1:03:14] he has a fairness amen
[1:03:17] amen therefore those we love we just
[1:03:21] keep praying for them
[1:03:22] god will put that on their path
[1:03:26] something would happen reclaim
[1:03:30] them the prophet says and the prophets
[1:03:33] say
[1:03:33] confession and committing
[1:03:38] are two powerful tools
[1:03:41] we can keep just confessing about it
[1:03:44] and committing it to him it will do
[1:03:48] that
[1:03:52] i want to bring you attention to some
[1:03:54] some
[1:03:56] more thing here luke chapter 17.
[1:03:59] i'm not going to read it i just took
[1:04:02] the resume of it i mean just looking at
[1:04:06] luke 17 i jesus is talking
[1:04:10] and he starts 17 22 you say
[1:04:14] there will be days where the son of man
[1:04:16] will be manifest on earth
[1:04:18] we know this day right
[1:04:21] then he goes 1724 is coming can be
[1:04:24] compared to a lightning
[1:04:27] then he goes to 17 26 he said the
[1:04:29] conditions on
[1:04:30] the earth will be like in the days of
[1:04:33] noah
[1:04:34] then he goes and he says in 1728
[1:04:38] he said the condition on earth will be
[1:04:40] also like
[1:04:41] in sodom and where you know lot was in
[1:04:44] sodom and abram
[1:04:45] was in the mountains and he goes in 1730
[1:04:50] a son of man will reveal the son of man
[1:04:55] is that right and then 17 35 you say
[1:04:59] two together ah one will be taken
[1:05:03] one will stay rapture time and that
[1:05:06] rapture is happening every
[1:05:08] day it's alright we were
[1:05:11] all in that world of uh
[1:05:14] world systems the church systems one is
[1:05:18] taken the other is left
[1:05:20] yes how do we found that
[1:05:24] the ego will be where we'll gather egos
[1:05:28] plural sorry we'll gather where the body
[1:05:32] is
[1:05:34] is that yes that's how you find uh
[1:05:37] you find him is when he reveal himself
[1:05:43] when he comes you find
[1:05:46] him where the egos gather together
[1:05:49] where the the egos will not just gather
[1:05:52] together for a meal
[1:05:54] which is great but for the body
[1:05:58] the meal the spiritual meal yes
[1:06:02] in the message the anointing of end time
[1:06:04] he said the angel was not this
[1:06:06] the son of man he was the messenger from
[1:06:09] the son of man the son of man is christ
[1:06:11] he is the one that you are feeding on
[1:06:13] you are not feeding on a man
[1:06:15] a man his word will fail
[1:06:19] but you are feeding on the unfailing
[1:06:21] body word of the son of man
[1:06:24] you want to find the eagles go where the
[1:06:28] body word is the unfailing one
[1:06:33] hey man amen
[1:06:37] so i brought all this story because
[1:06:40] of what comes next look
[1:06:44] 18. now jesus is talking about
[1:06:48] prophecy things that will happen
[1:06:51] one day you will want to see one of the
[1:06:53] days of the son of man
[1:06:56] are you you know he said there will be a
[1:06:58] day where
[1:06:59] son of man christ will be on earth
[1:07:03] yeah that's what he said and one son
[1:07:07] of man will reveal the son of man
[1:07:11] and then when the son of man is
[1:07:14] gone when a son of man is gone
[1:07:18] is the ministry of the son of man
[1:07:22] finished still here
[1:07:27] he's still here so then then
[1:07:30] jesus continues in
[1:07:33] the next chapter 18 is that a story
[1:07:37] what we will say out of the blue
[1:07:42] i start the story and people and he
[1:07:46] speak a parable
[1:07:47] unto them to this end that men are
[1:07:49] always to
[1:07:50] pray and not to faint
[1:07:53] saying that was in the city a judge
[1:07:56] judge which fear not god not a good
[1:08:00] judge
[1:08:01] neither regarded man and there was a
[1:08:03] widow in that city
[1:08:06] she came unto him saying he avenged me
[1:08:08] of my
[1:08:09] adversary and he will not
[1:08:13] for a while but afterward he say
[1:08:16] within himself though i fear not god no
[1:08:20] nor regard man verse five
[1:08:24] yet because this widow troubles me
[1:08:27] i will avenge her lest by her continue
[1:08:30] coming she worry me
[1:08:34] and the lord say hear what the unjust
[1:08:37] judge saith
[1:08:38] and shall not god avenge his
[1:08:41] own elect which cry day
[1:08:45] and night unto him though he bear long
[1:08:48] with
[1:08:48] them i tell you that he will
[1:08:52] avenge them speedily nevertheless this
[1:08:55] is where i want to go back
[1:08:56] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:08:59] shall he found
[1:09:00] find faith on earth well the story was
[1:09:04] really out of the blue then he
[1:09:07] he tied it to the coming of the lord
[1:09:12] did you notice he started the story of
[1:09:16] a a judge a woman that was a a
[1:09:20] widow
[1:09:23] could that just be it was continuing the
[1:09:27] same story
[1:09:30] that day in the end time in the time
[1:09:34] of the revelation and the coming of the
[1:09:36] son of man
[1:09:39] christ will come as a judge
[1:09:44] with a winged white wing of the judges
[1:09:47] in
[1:09:48] england is that right
[1:09:53] to give back to this woman
[1:09:56] her properties and rights
[1:10:03] amen for people
[1:10:06] for years people looked at her as a
[1:10:09] widow
[1:10:11] because they say her husband jesus
[1:10:13] christ died
[1:10:15] and was buried therefore whatever she
[1:10:18] says doesn't matter
[1:10:20] she must be a widow
[1:10:24] if you are not the widow where is your
[1:10:26] husband they say
[1:10:28] they mistreat her
[1:10:32] but the bad by by the adversary
[1:10:38] the formidable adversary me treats her
[1:10:41] this great adversary
[1:10:45] this big one mistreat her
[1:10:49] and she's asking god
[1:10:53] for judgment she's going to
[1:10:57] ask god for avenge for victory upon
[1:11:02] her
[1:11:05] her enemy
[1:11:08] that's not that tells you
[1:11:12] what happened in our time when the cloud
[1:11:15] came
[1:11:17] what was it it was the judge himself
[1:11:22] brother branham saw the vision of it
[1:11:26] he saw a big bro
[1:11:29] he told the people when he went to
[1:11:33] sunset monkey
[1:11:34] he saw it again it happened
[1:11:37] he told the people when the picture was
[1:11:40] taken
[1:11:42] he told people turn the picture to the
[1:11:45] right
[1:11:46] why people hate it so much
[1:11:50] then they attack it
[1:11:54] the judge is back to
[1:11:57] give to the bride her
[1:12:00] rights what she deserves
[1:12:06] her title deed
[1:12:09] amen no wonder they attack it
[1:12:14] but is uh to avenge her to give her
[1:12:19] her place the word is calling us
[1:12:22] to place us positionally in
[1:12:26] what we supposed to have
[1:12:31] that's why the judge came
[1:12:34] amen he came in a cloud
[1:12:38] the picture was taken
[1:12:42] it's time to go back to our property
[1:12:45] the word of god
[1:12:49] the judge has come it's wonderful
[1:12:54] amen when the judge comes
[1:12:59] he gives us what belongs to us
[1:13:03] it judges our enemy
[1:13:07] again i'll go back to say the enemy is
[1:13:09] this
[1:13:11] human spirit that we bear
[1:13:15] the enemy satan is the enemy but
[1:13:19] he works through a human mind
[1:13:23] and yet god say that
[1:13:26] i will restore
[1:13:29] i will install these days he came
[1:13:33] back to restore what was taken
[1:13:37] what belongs to us
[1:13:43] i can see him here there is
[1:13:46] this woman her life is
[1:13:50] a mess as we can say
[1:13:54] and she goes to
[1:13:57] to brother branham to pray for her
[1:14:01] just to see how much has been
[1:14:05] taken to us
[1:14:08] how much this world the nature
[1:14:11] the the trees the all the nature are
[1:14:15] screaming
[1:14:16] crying where are the sons of god
[1:14:23] they crying out the manifestations of
[1:14:28] son of god because when the sons of god
[1:14:31] get their attributes their whole nature
[1:14:35] is restored
[1:14:43] i saw this story in god revealing
[1:14:46] himself to his people
[1:14:49] it's in a 50
[1:14:56] god uh he say he's talking to a
[1:14:59] woman by the brand i'm
[1:15:03] wary and the sun
[1:15:06] looks gloomy
[1:15:11] is discerning your life
[1:15:14] is contacting this human spirit
[1:15:18] that you and i have and everything like
[1:15:21] that
[1:15:23] she's gloomy what does that mean
[1:15:26] anxiety what is it
[1:15:30] [Music]
[1:15:35] and everything limbs seems like a phobia
[1:15:39] what is it a fear that
[1:15:42] you can't control
[1:15:46] you get scared at things
[1:15:49] a phobia a fear that she has
[1:15:54] she realized that is not normal
[1:15:57] she has to go to him the word
[1:16:01] and the word will discern
[1:16:04] what is going on now
[1:16:08] it's it's not no more it's not that
[1:16:10] right
[1:16:11] now standing longer and longer you just
[1:16:14] make it just keep in thinking you you
[1:16:17] want him to get
[1:16:19] well i'm going to ask jesus now to heal
[1:16:21] you
[1:16:22] i believe he will do it don't you sister
[1:16:26] all right you come just
[1:16:29] a little closer now you've had
[1:16:32] quite a struggle in life anyhow
[1:16:36] isn't that you know what i'm speaking of
[1:16:39] i don't have to say it
[1:16:43] oh must be hard it must be
[1:16:46] terrible thing something that comes from
[1:16:50] phobia
[1:16:54] but you know what i'm speaking of
[1:16:58] the word discern anything the body
[1:17:01] the spirit and the soul
[1:17:05] when you got the word you got everything
[1:17:09] east esther made the right choice
[1:17:12] she went to the word and the word
[1:17:15] comes with gifts she did not go after
[1:17:18] gifts
[1:17:19] she went after the giver so she can have
[1:17:23] the gifts
[1:17:24] the word comes with deliverance
[1:17:28] praise god for that how many people
[1:17:32] go through a lot of things and nobody
[1:17:34] knows
[1:17:35] and barabam says even doctors don't know
[1:17:38] what's going on
[1:17:39] but here is the word i don't want to say
[1:17:42] brother planet
[1:17:43] i'm saying the word discerning
[1:17:47] this woman that she had phobia i don't
[1:17:50] know if that phobia was when she was
[1:17:52] younger i don't know she had this
[1:17:56] phobia she has some sort of maybe
[1:17:58] anxiety for something
[1:18:01] and but doesn't want to say what that's
[1:18:03] what
[1:18:04] that does to her
[1:18:07] it's it cannot tell everything
[1:18:11] because it's her problem so it must be
[1:18:14] between her and god
[1:18:17] and then you say our heavenly father by
[1:18:20] your spirit
[1:18:21] look down through the stream of time oh
[1:18:24] you are here dear jesus you are so
[1:18:27] lovely and kind
[1:18:28] and we love you with all our heart
[1:18:32] and our sister standing here has been
[1:18:34] bound by an
[1:18:35] oppression of satan foul
[1:18:39] spirits have tried to pray to put
[1:18:42] pride upon her
[1:18:45] oh phobia
[1:18:48] depression or anxiety
[1:18:52] then pride the prophet
[1:18:55] is connecting the guts
[1:19:00] is discerning if we love the word
[1:19:04] we absorb the word we keep eating the
[1:19:06] word
[1:19:08] it will discern what is in us
[1:19:11] what we need to do where we need to go
[1:19:15] what do we need to be done the word is a
[1:19:18] designer
[1:19:20] he will give us a solution to things
[1:19:22] that we we don't understand what to do
[1:19:26] you will discern that this is
[1:19:30] had some strange things happening in
[1:19:33] your life
[1:19:35] could that be that she if you have
[1:19:38] phobia you feel something that that
[1:19:41] phobia gives you
[1:19:42] pride
[1:19:45] it doesn't seem to be connected but it
[1:19:47] is connected
[1:19:50] and then and it does give you something
[1:19:53] that brother branham cannot
[1:19:56] talk about in the audience
[1:19:59] what that means is it a bad atmosphere
[1:20:03] in your life
[1:20:04] around you around people that are with
[1:20:07] you it creates some atmosphere that
[1:20:10] atmosphere
[1:20:11] comes from a phobia and that
[1:20:14] create pride because when somebody steps
[1:20:17] on your way
[1:20:18] your pride comes in
[1:20:24] but what did she do she went to the
[1:20:27] judge
[1:20:28] and say i want justice
[1:20:32] i come here to sue to accuse
[1:20:36] this enemy this is not
[1:20:39] me this is not my idea
[1:20:43] i create an atmosphere maybe it's an
[1:20:45] atmosphere of
[1:20:46] rage that people can't
[1:20:50] stand
[1:20:53] because of phobia because of
[1:20:57] pride who brings pride who start
[1:21:00] pride satan lucifer himself
[1:21:04] and all this better banner let me just
[1:21:07] say again
[1:21:08] the world connects the dots
[1:21:12] it will connect that in our lives
[1:21:16] who thinks that don't make sense if
[1:21:19] god wanted to make sense he will do it
[1:21:22] it will give us the discernment because
[1:21:25] the word
[1:21:26] is like a two egg sword
[1:21:29] amen
[1:21:35] are you angry
[1:21:41] all right no i i get
[1:21:44] i came across this without knowing it
[1:21:47] that's how it works
[1:21:48] ask preachers yeah
[1:21:53] now what did she do
[1:21:56] she's not identified by her human spirit
[1:22:01] she's deeper than her
[1:22:04] human spirit and she knows where the
[1:22:07] solution is
[1:22:09] the judge supreme judge
[1:22:12] is able to remove this the word of god
[1:22:17] is a discerner of the thoughts
[1:22:20] and prabhanam pray for her he say that
[1:22:24] but
[1:22:25] thou where was i
[1:22:29] actually reading and our sister
[1:22:33] standing here has been bound by no prey
[1:22:37] oppression of satan far
[1:22:41] spirit have tried to put
[1:22:44] pride upon her but thou art here
[1:22:48] to remove this curse of the enemy
[1:22:52] for you say the last word from your
[1:22:55] sacred
[1:22:55] lips that you were living the world you
[1:22:58] say
[1:22:59] this signs shall follow them in my name
[1:23:02] they shall cast out
[1:23:04] devils help me dear lord destro
[1:23:08] faith against the enemy
[1:23:14] so after this hopefully after this
[1:23:18] you will when you hear god is a judge
[1:23:20] you won't
[1:23:21] feel wary you will bring your enemy
[1:23:27] that person facing the mirror
[1:23:31] to him because you always stand in god's
[1:23:35] way
[1:23:36] so you cannot serve him as you wish
[1:23:43] you go and say i want justice
[1:23:46] and he will give you justice
[1:23:50] do you believe that
[1:23:56] overcoming means recognizing the devil
[1:23:59] in
[1:23:59] every one of his tricks a lot of people
[1:24:02] they
[1:24:04] says there is no devil it's just a
[1:24:06] thought
[1:24:07] don't you believe that there is a real
[1:24:09] devil is just as real as you are
[1:24:12] and anybody a real devil and you must
[1:24:15] recognize him real you must
[1:24:18] is a devil

[1:24:26] to you you
[1:24:27] recognize him you know he's the devil is
[1:24:29] against you then
[1:24:31] to overcome you must recognize that god
[1:24:34] is greater and mightier than he
[1:24:38] is that the one that is in you has
[1:24:41] already overcome
[1:24:42] him and by his grace you are more than a
[1:24:46] match for him
[1:24:47] amen there is real overcoming when you
[1:24:51] recognize
[1:24:53] amen how can i overcome
[1:24:57] 1963
[1:25:00] the thing you have to overcome is
[1:25:02] yourself your idea
[1:25:05] your thing surrender yourself to him
[1:25:10] he over he overcome for you he knows the
[1:25:13] way
[1:25:14] we don't
[1:25:18] amen how can i do it
[1:25:21] take the word heck the word
[1:25:24] brother branham questions and answer
[1:25:27] 1964
[1:25:29] how can a christian get deeper in the
[1:25:31] love of god
[1:25:33] read the word and pray read the word and
[1:25:37] pray
[1:25:39] the preacher is a transmitter a signal
[1:25:42] booster
[1:25:43] read the word of god and pray
[1:25:48] amen it will give you strength
[1:25:51] now guess what the devil doesn't like
[1:25:53] that
[1:25:54] he never wants us to have time even to
[1:25:57] pray
[1:25:59] and he uses something
[1:26:02] that he uses the insecurity
[1:26:09] living in this flesh the words say to
[1:26:12] turn our affection to set our affection
[1:26:15] on high
[1:26:17] but yet because of
[1:26:20] this humanity this enemy
[1:26:24] we don't want to talk much about him i
[1:26:26] agree
[1:26:27] because we don't want to focus on him
[1:26:30] right
[1:26:31] but we have to recognize his tactics
[1:26:33] anyway
[1:26:34] then move on
[1:26:38] read and pray will the devil let you
[1:26:41] pray
[1:26:43] i am guilty for that
[1:26:46] i'm i can be on my computer
[1:26:52] that's not right hopefully by preaching
[1:26:57] it
[1:26:57] i'll be aware of it
[1:27:04] but yet god has always always
[1:27:08] provided even when i was
[1:27:12] unable to even speak the language right
[1:27:15] i could not even
[1:27:19] i could not even ask somebody something
[1:27:22] he was always protecting the feeding the
[1:27:24] family
[1:27:25] taking care of the family what is wrong
[1:27:28] but i'm saying man stop man
[1:27:32] after men stop walking with god
[1:27:38] he now has to shift himself
[1:27:42] that's the word barbara use is a very
[1:27:44] good word
[1:27:45] very good english for me
[1:27:49] if i can say that he
[1:27:52] shifts himself now he has to fight
[1:27:55] you see him suspicious here
[1:27:59] uh it's not me actually it's very very
[1:28:01] name i just
[1:28:02] don't have the coat here it's suspicious
[1:28:07] but he got take care that's why we don't
[1:28:10] spend
[1:28:10] time like the pastor was saying that
[1:28:15] give him time give him time
[1:28:18] but you got to take it back go to the
[1:28:21] judge and say
[1:28:22] i want my time back
[1:28:25] because he always provided
[1:28:31] he always take care of his children is
[1:28:34] all over the
[1:28:35] world i i remember even
[1:28:39] we just fight to get to keep our jobs
[1:28:43] that's why we do all this we spend all
[1:28:45] these times i want to keep my job
[1:28:48] i have a mortgage i have children
[1:28:54] guilty
[1:28:58] the time is when the time is left
[1:29:01] then i give you so
[1:29:04] that's a basic gospel i'm sure
[1:29:08] but this is a reality in my life i i saw
[1:29:11] him in a time where i could not qualify
[1:29:13] for anything
[1:29:14] almost he was always taking care of me
[1:29:19] where is this anxiety i gotta keep my
[1:29:22] job
[1:29:25] you know instead of spending more time
[1:29:29] with him
[1:29:31] do the job because the prophets say that
[1:29:33] you got to be the best at your work
[1:29:36] is the word too but you have
[1:29:39] determined hours and things you can do
[1:29:42] that
[1:29:44] i even remember a time where
[1:29:50] uh
[1:29:52] i had a manager that was not very very
[1:29:54] good
[1:29:55] to me he made my
[1:29:59] you know work really hard screaming
[1:30:02] yelling whatever
[1:30:06] and god has a sense of humor you know
[1:30:08] that
[1:30:10] they demoted her
[1:30:14] and made me a manager
[1:30:19] there was a group there they gave me
[1:30:21] manager a few years later
[1:30:25] she i went to a different company
[1:30:28] she came looking for a job so
[1:30:32] where i was asking me a job
[1:30:37] those are little things that tells you
[1:30:41] god cares but yet
[1:30:46] because our affections sometimes turn to
[1:30:49] this system
[1:30:51] sometimes all our debate that we do
[1:30:55] is just because we are insecure we're
[1:30:58] thinking about the children
[1:31:01] our grandchildren our argument
[1:31:04] should be upon the word of god
[1:31:08] if the argument is upon our ideas our
[1:31:12] insecurity god will not
[1:31:14] back the map are you with me
[1:31:18] the kingdom of god backs only his
[1:31:21] own word
[1:31:25] sometimes in a short run it looks like
[1:31:28] you are defeated
[1:31:30] but in the long run it's good to stay
[1:31:34] with the world
[1:31:38] when we talk to our children
[1:31:41] grandchildren whatever it is
[1:31:44] let our argument if we can say argument
[1:31:48] i know christians don't argue but you
[1:31:50] understand
[1:31:52] let it be the word of god
[1:31:59] i remember bringing the word to my
[1:32:03] my children constantly constantly then
[1:32:07] one day one went to college
[1:32:09] my first daughter rebecca she went to
[1:32:11] college the challenge of her
[1:32:14] now i was like i never seen
[1:32:17] children rejecting the word
[1:32:25] church seriously was a big problem for
[1:32:28] me
[1:32:28] i even called by the lonely jenkins
[1:32:32] he said to me in some way is healthy
[1:32:36] that the
[1:32:36] children question what they believe he's
[1:32:40] saying
[1:32:40] you are not stronger than the holy ghost
[1:32:44] but you know what happened is what i
[1:32:47] told her was not a mix
[1:32:49] of word and wisdom
[1:32:54] it was the word therefore when they
[1:32:57] challenged her it was
[1:32:59] the kingdom of god had to fight the
[1:33:01] fight not me
[1:33:05] and then they challenge
[1:33:08] her she's in a college and she has all
[1:33:11] this
[1:33:12] uh healthy department college where all
[1:33:16] the kids that don't want to drink don't
[1:33:18] want to go out they all gather together
[1:33:20] and they have like a denominational
[1:33:23] services where they
[1:33:24] read the bible and they challenge her
[1:33:28] she's always in dress and
[1:33:31] skirts and you know
[1:33:37] when we take our ideas the idea we took
[1:33:40] in the media here
[1:33:41] in the internet and we mix them together
[1:33:43] we give to children
[1:33:45] one day they will be challenged then
[1:33:46] they will reject the whole thing
[1:33:50] but if you stay with the world they can
[1:33:52] challenge it they can
[1:33:54] throw it reject it but at the end you
[1:33:57] will have victory because
[1:33:59] the whole kingdom of god is behind you
[1:34:04] that's what happened that those days
[1:34:07] were gloomy days and she received the
[1:34:10] holy ghost
[1:34:12] praise god now i can rest
[1:34:18] then a few times maybe a few months
[1:34:21] later
[1:34:22] to me god show me
[1:34:26] priscilla and enoch receiving the holy
[1:34:28] ghost
[1:34:29] i don't like to talk about that but it
[1:34:32] was
[1:34:32] tremendous it was amazing
[1:34:36] because the devil was so angry
[1:34:39] that that day i had a terrible nightmare
[1:34:43] i saw
[1:34:44] a master coming to swallow me
[1:34:48] just i look at the scriptures
[1:34:51] that the devil does that is like a lion
[1:34:55] going around
[1:34:58] and when i woke up i told my wife
[1:35:01] sister jose i say i had a terrible
[1:35:05] nightmare today
[1:35:07] it was awful she said don't tell me
[1:35:10] i will tell you what i saw exactly the
[1:35:14] same monster
[1:35:17] why it doesn't want to let go
[1:35:20] and that week they had special meetings
[1:35:23] something changed in their life
[1:35:29] but sometimes christian we found
[1:35:31] ourselves with all kind
[1:35:33] of argument deaths and that
[1:35:36] but god will not back the map
[1:35:40] he will only back his word
[1:35:44] and after he lost his fellowship that's
[1:35:46] the basis of fellowship
[1:35:50] after he lost his fellowship with god
[1:35:53] he became become a wanderer
[1:35:56] had to shift for himself god taken care
[1:35:59] of him
[1:36:00] before then but now he finds
[1:36:04] he has to shift for himself it's a
[1:36:07] pretty hard
[1:36:08] thing so he doesn't have a loving father
[1:36:12] to watch over him and protect him and
[1:36:15] guide him and direct
[1:36:16] him and feed him and clothe him
[1:36:20] and care for him like he did
[1:36:23] so instead of coming back he tries to
[1:36:26] find his own way he wants to make his
[1:36:30] own way back
[1:36:32] man wants to make his own way he's
[1:36:35] always
[1:36:36] had always he will i suppose try to find
[1:36:39] his own way
[1:36:41] and every time you make his own way as
[1:36:43] always it gets wrong
[1:36:47] only the word of god
[1:36:50] we try to shift ourself
[1:36:54] yeah god doesn't back anything that is
[1:36:57] not
[1:36:58] his word our argument
[1:37:02] is better that i say i say to it's
[1:37:05] better i said to my children that
[1:37:06] this is my opinion this is why i say but
[1:37:09] this is the word of god
[1:37:12] and you may not have
[1:37:16] you may not understand it just like
[1:37:18] brother brenham talks about
[1:37:20] the two brothers god told them to build
[1:37:22] a house
[1:37:24] uh the church somewhere and
[1:37:27] they brought them to the court because
[1:37:30] they want to build something maybe
[1:37:32] public something that will give money to
[1:37:34] the
[1:37:35] to the town or whatever they say they
[1:37:38] have to sell their
[1:37:39] property and they say we won't do that
[1:37:42] because
[1:37:43] god told us that they brought them to
[1:37:46] the court
[1:37:47] and the attorney or the prosecutor
[1:37:50] was just attacking them and say
[1:37:54] why do you no one do this and they say
[1:37:56] oh
[1:37:57] god told us leave god out of that
[1:38:02] we don't want any god in this
[1:38:06] emo ridicule them
[1:38:10] it doesn't matter the kingdom of
[1:38:13] god is behind you when you repeat the
[1:38:16] word and you
[1:38:17] love the world
[1:38:27] god is not obligated to back you
[1:38:32] when you talk about your own stuff so
[1:38:35] church let's
[1:38:37] last minute i wrote this down
[1:38:41] okay okay i'm i'm finishing now let's
[1:38:44] just
[1:38:44] read that uh 1959 f
[1:38:47] 59 joe fajara we are glad to have a real
[1:38:51] god
[1:38:52] a real bible and god that stays behind
[1:38:56] his word
[1:38:57] and backs up every word he says i'm so
[1:39:00] happy to know that
[1:39:02] if he's his word he's going to back it
[1:39:04] up if his
[1:39:06] word is going to impact your life
[1:39:09] if his word is going to generate
[1:39:12] god's attributes one of our attributes
[1:39:16] of god
[1:39:16] is the judge the discerner
[1:39:19] of the thoughts discern of confusion
[1:39:23] discern leads a guide
[1:39:29] it directs you
[1:39:32] the word of god is full
[1:39:36] with all the vitamins and minerals and
[1:39:40] proteins and everything that
[1:39:43] when they come in our body we don't know
[1:39:45] how this
[1:39:46] works we don't know the mechanism
[1:39:49] but it works
[1:39:53] therefore we stay with the word
[1:39:57] and turn our affections
[1:40:00] toward that kingdom the kingdom of god
[1:40:04] [Music]
[1:40:06] how just loving more
[1:40:10] then you start displaying because this
[1:40:13] time is the time where christ is
[1:40:16] revealed then you will start displaying
[1:40:20] him because of
[1:40:21] what you have absorbed
[1:40:24] god help us help me
[1:40:30] stay with the world and you will display
[1:40:35] those attributes that's why the reason
[1:40:38] why
[1:40:39] you are in this world is to display
[1:40:42] those
[1:40:43] attributes may god help us musicians if
[1:40:46] you can come
[1:40:47] little stand and
[1:41:07] if he then
[1:41:10] if then be risen with christ seek
[1:41:13] those things which are above
[1:41:17] where christ sitteth
[1:41:20] on the right hand of god
[1:41:24] set your affection on things above
[1:41:28] not on things of the earth how
[1:41:34] the more you eat it the more you don't
[1:41:37] have room for others
[1:41:40] the more you eat it it becomes part of
[1:41:44] you
[1:41:46] if it becomes part of you
[1:41:49] what is you are
[1:41:53] is attributes are you attributes
[1:41:56] god has so many attributes was thinking
[1:42:00] about
[1:42:00] attributes of love we don't even have
[1:42:04] understood the attribute of love at
[1:42:07] least to me
[1:42:09] i look sometimes we we see it as empathy
[1:42:13] because you can see brother branham
[1:42:15] looking at this mexican man
[1:42:17] before he prays for him he check
[1:42:20] if he can give him his suits
[1:42:24] he put himself in his literally in his
[1:42:28] issues
[1:42:30] he put his shoes close to his and say
[1:42:34] he feels about him
[1:42:37] that's still human but it's
[1:42:40] important to say i cast out demons
[1:42:44] by love oh my
[1:42:50] and then there is a love that he
[1:42:52] understands
[1:42:53] the anger of the bulls or the harness
[1:42:58] you understand i disturb you this is
[1:43:00] your territory
[1:43:02] god-given place i disturb you
[1:43:05] that's another love i mean a
[1:43:07] manifestation of love
[1:43:10] but then he says that that something
[1:43:13] comes on me the bull
[1:43:16] will kill me because i have no weapon
[1:43:21] but suddenly something comes over me
[1:43:25] i don't fear anymore
[1:43:29] church i want to get to that love where
[1:43:31] there is no
[1:43:33] self-preservation
[1:43:35] i want to protect myself my life is
[1:43:37] important no
[1:43:38] self perservation but i'm got this twice
[1:43:42] no fear we gotta get that it's
[1:43:46] god's attributes we will get that
[1:43:50] but we have it now amen
[1:43:54] the word that we have has
[1:43:57] all this potential in them
[1:44:00] but we we accept it live it
[1:44:04] go with it work with it it will start
[1:44:07] just
[1:44:07] manifesting i want to manifest that love
[1:44:11] where
[1:44:11] i don't care about self-preservation
[1:44:15] and that's what causes all kind of
[1:44:18] things that we have today people
[1:44:20] want to self-preserve preserve and they
[1:44:23] are
[1:44:23] fearing the fear for the future for the
[1:44:27] children the grandchildren
[1:44:28] and they try to shift themselves here
[1:44:30] and there compromise here and there
[1:44:34] but if you lean
[1:44:38] onto that kingdom
[1:44:42] that's what we need god help us i don't
[1:44:45] say have
[1:44:46] attained if we have the world
[1:44:50] then this other kingdom will decrease
[1:44:54] the other kingdom will increase
[1:44:58] god bless you thank you for
[1:45:01] listening for me to me for so long

[1:50:26] this hybrid flesh that i come to
[1:50:30] and no fault of my own that's what
[1:50:32] brother madam said no fault of your own
[1:50:34] you were trapped into it it's causing me
[1:50:36] problems and i ask that you judge
[1:50:38] it and make it match your word
[1:50:41] amen how about saying it this way
[1:50:45] lord jesus this body that you bought
[1:50:47] [Music]
[1:50:49] that you own that you possess amen i'm
[1:50:52] not my own i've been bought with the
[1:50:53] price
[1:50:54] lord this body that you paid for is
[1:50:56] causing me problems would you please
[1:50:58] help me because my desire is to match
[1:51:01] your word my
[1:51:02] longing is to match your nature my
[1:51:04] greatest desire
[1:51:05] is to manifest you amen but this flesh
[1:51:08] this body
[1:51:09] this mind whatever it is is holding me
[1:51:11] back i pray that you judge it and you
[1:51:12] correct it by your word
[1:51:14] and help me to overcome
[1:51:18] it's not it's not just when we sing this
[1:51:21] song to be like jesus
[1:51:22] it's not just our desire i mean we could
[1:51:25] never have that desire if it wasn't his
[1:51:27] plan
[1:51:28] and if it didn't serve his purpose if it
[1:51:30] wasn't first god's idea
[1:51:32] it would never be our desire it's our
[1:51:34] desire because first it was his idea
[1:51:37] and as much as we want to be like him it
[1:51:40] proves that he
[1:51:41] more it's a greater desire for him at
[1:51:44] the desire of the word because he had
[1:51:45] the desire
[1:51:46] first so what do we do what brother
[1:51:49] kadima said
[1:51:50] just yield focus on things that are
[1:51:53] above
[1:51:54] and just heal he says the bride becomes
