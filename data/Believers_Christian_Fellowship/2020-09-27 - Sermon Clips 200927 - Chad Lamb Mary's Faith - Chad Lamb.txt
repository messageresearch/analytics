========================================

so there's a spoken word but when the spoken word goes it goes and goes and goes looking for a lodging place and there's got to be a predestinated lodging place and that word is moving now there's been a prophet messenger in our day spoke the word of god and that word is moving amen and that word has a predestinated lodging place in the elect predestinated seed of god and that word is moving looking for somebody who will say be it unto me that's the truth i believe i am what you say mary wasn't just saying you're a good messenger you are gabriel amen you are and it's time for that that's not what she was saying friends it wasn't saying you're malachi 4. this is luke 17 30. you're the elijah that's not what she was agreeing to friends amen zacharias wasn't doubting gabriel he wasn't doubting that he was an angel come from the presence of the lord he was doubting his part in the mystery so when mary said amen be it unto me according to my words she wasn't saying i agree you're gabriel i agree you're the messenger and i agree the word you say is true she was saying i agree i am the fulfillment of isaiah's prophecy it was a big statement you see friends it wasn't just something that said oh yeah that sounds good amen amen that's the truth amen that's good but she was absolutely actually accepting the fact that when god spoke a word that was in his mind before the foundation of the world that she was the recipient of that word amen this is not agreeing with the message agreeing with the messenger agreeing that brother bran look at those miracles look at those signs obviously he's elijah he did everything he was supposed to be that's the son of man ministry amen that's not the faith that god's looking for in this day he's looking for the faith that mary had that would say you call me bride you say i'm sinless you say that god's gonna bring forth the manifestation of jesus christ through me i'm saying that's the truth and i receive it in the name of jesus it's a much bigger statement than just recognizing that what the messenger says is true
