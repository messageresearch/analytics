[0:00] so the mystery of god will be finished
[0:02] as the
[0:03] revelation coming through christ is
[0:05] being completed
[0:06] it is finishing the mystery of god
[0:09] because there's been a mystery about god
[0:11] and god's been portraying this mystery
[0:14] when we come to the end time he's going
[0:16] to he's going to begin to reveal the
[0:18] mystery
[0:19] what's been a mystery will become a
[0:21] secret
[0:23] what's been a mystery to everybody will
[0:24] become a secret to his bride
[0:26] and the reason we're going to this is i
[0:28] want to focus our glasses now
[0:30] on what is our purpose as individuals
[0:34] and the message christ is the mystery of
[0:35] god revealed prophet of god says
[0:39] now god had a purpose and a hidden
[0:42] mystery
[0:44] what are we going to talk about now
[0:46] god's purpose
[0:48] we get so distracted by
[0:51] all the things in the world so
[0:53] distracted by all the things we go
[0:55] through daily
[0:57] that we need to get our glasses focused
[0:59] again
[1:01] we have difficulties and we have strife
[1:03] and we have hardship and we've got
[1:05] all kinds of up and downs and this is
[1:07] just part of living in this life
[1:08] you know that god as we lived in this
[1:10] life he never took away
[1:12] all of the effects of the curse when he
[1:14] put us in this life
[1:16] he called us he quickened us to life but
[1:18] he never
[1:19] he didn't take away aging
[1:24] he didn't take away amen the fact that
[1:26] sickness will still come
[1:28] and difficulties upon this earth we
[1:30] still suffer with many things like the
[1:32] rest of the world suffers
[1:33] but they suffer with no purpose we
[1:35] suffer with a purpose
[1:39] there's no direction for them the only
[1:41] purpose they have is a self-purpose amen
[1:43] but we have a different purpose and all
[1:45] of these things we may have the same
[1:48] things happen to us to happen to the
[1:49] world
[1:50] amen but our reaction should be
[1:52] different than the world's reaction
[1:54] because our glasses are focused to god's
[1:56] purpose
[1:58] and god's purpose is to live his life in
[2:00] individuals amen
[2:02] and so don't don't don't let me as i
[2:05] talk
[2:05] don't let me use terms that cause you to
[2:08] think bride
[2:08] i want to use terms that cause you to
[2:10] think me amen i want you to raise your
[2:12] hand and say he's talking about me amen
[2:14] let's focus our glasses down so you can
[2:16] see god's purpose is you amen
[2:18] god's purpose is realized in you god's
[2:21] purpose is displayed in you
[2:22] and the mystery of god is being revealed
[2:24] in you
[2:27] as an individual this is finishing the
[2:29] mystery of god
