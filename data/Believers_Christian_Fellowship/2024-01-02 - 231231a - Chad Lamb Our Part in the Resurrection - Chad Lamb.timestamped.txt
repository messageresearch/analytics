[17:03] in time past you walked according to the
[17:05] course of this world according to the
[17:06] prince of the power of the air the
[17:08] spirit that now worketh in the children
[17:10] of Disobedience among whom also we all
[17:13] had our conversation in times past in
[17:15] the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[17:17] desire of the Flesh and of the mind and
[17:19] were by Nature the children of Wrath
[17:21] even as others but God who is rich in
[17:25] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[17:27] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[17:29] hath quickened us together with Christ
[17:31] by Grace you are saved and he hath
[17:33] raised us up together and made us sit
[17:35] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[17:38] Jesus amen praise God Amen God bless you
[17:40] as you have your seats
[17:45] amen man I just remembered as I looked
[17:47] back I looked for brother Ben to thank
[17:48] him for service and I realized he's away
[17:50] preaching this weekend he's down in I
[17:52] believe it's Virginia he's preaching uh
[17:54] for his brother-in-law down there so
[17:57] please remember them and prayer but as
[18:00] we look at this scripture we realize
[18:02] that we were dead in sins and trespasses
[18:05] remember uh uh a little more than a week
[18:07] ago I don't remember when it was we
[18:08] preached on true life and true death
[18:10] what death really is brother bham taught
[18:11] us death is separation amen and we were
[18:14] born and we were separated alienated
[18:16] from the things of God having our mind
[18:18] darkened Amen to the things of God we
[18:20] were dead amen though we were breathing
[18:22] oxygen and out we were dead amen dead in
[18:25] sins and trespasses amen but God ha
[18:28] quickened us amen he brought us out of
[18:30] that dead condition and quickened us to
[18:32] life why because there was a seed of
[18:34] eternal life already on the inside amen
[18:37] and not just quickened us but raised us
[18:39] up together and SE and we're seated
[18:41] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[18:44] Jesus praise God we can rejoice in that
[18:49] for this morning I'd like to take a
[18:51] subject on our part in this Resurrection
[18:54] our part in this resurrection and I'm
[18:57] going to take my uh that this U title
[19:00] comes out of this next
[19:02] quote from the message it is the rising
[19:04] of the sun brother M says as Christ was
[19:07] the first one to raise from all the
[19:09] prophets and so forth although typed in
[19:12] many places he was the first fruits of
[19:13] those that slept in the bride coming of
[19:16] Christ coming out of the church they'll
[19:18] have to be a sheath waved again in the
[19:20] last days oh my waving of the sheath
[19:22] what was the sheath the first one that
[19:24] come to mature the first one that proved
[19:26] it was a wheat that proved it was a
[19:28] sheath Hallelujah I'm sure you see what
[19:31] I'm talking about it was waved over the
[19:33] people and the first time there will
[19:34] come forth for the bright age for a
[19:37] resurrection out of dark
[19:39] denominationalism will be a message amen
[19:42] so what's going to be the first thing
[19:43] that comes when it's time for a
[19:45] resurrection amen that's why I said our
[19:47] part in this Resurrection what is this
[19:49] Resurrection it's a resurrection out of
[19:51] dead
[19:53] denominationalism amen so I'll read that
[19:55] again and for the first time there will
[19:57] come forth for the bright age for a
[19:59] resurrection out of dark denomination
[20:01] what is the bright age it's a
[20:02] resurrection out of dark
[20:05] denominationalism will be a message that
[20:07] the full maturity of the word has turned
[20:08] back again in its full power and being
[20:10] waved over the People by the same signs
[20:12] and wonders that he did back there
[20:14] because I live ye live also speaking to
[20:17] his wife who was he speaking to he was
[20:20] speaking to his wife amen because I live
[20:24] you live also what a resurrection that
[20:26] was and what a resurrection this is to
[20:30] be quickened from the dead to be made
[20:32] alive in Christ Jesus by God's
[20:35] quickening power amen further down in
[20:38] the rising of the sun he goes on to say
[20:41] and the sun has got to be revealed again
[20:43] in the bride in the last day where is
[20:46] the Sun going to be revealed in the
[20:48] bride amen the sun has got to be
[20:51] revealed again in the bride in the last
[20:53] day the quickening power has got to come
[20:57] Quicken them out of these dead
[20:58] denominations and Creeds to a Living
[21:01] Word of the Living God Amen we were
[21:04] stuck in darkness amen but the
[21:07] quickening power has come amen what has
[21:09] come the wave sheath has come proving it
[21:11] was the first one to mature the first
[21:13] one what the first part of that end time
[21:16] word to come to maturity amen it came to
[21:18] maturity in our brother amen but what
[21:20] was it it was the Life of Christ it was
[21:23] Christ who come to maturity in that
[21:25] vessel and that gift was taken and
[21:26] weighed before us what was weigh before
[21:28] us the word was weighed before us not a
[21:31] human being amen the word come to
[21:33] maturity in a vessel absolutely was
[21:35] betrayed through a vessel but it was the
[21:37] word amen that was waved over the people
[21:40] seeing that the time of the prophecy was
[21:43] nigh and the Word was waved over the
[21:47] people praise be to
[21:49] God and then it brought the quickening
[21:52] power amen the opening of the word
[21:54] brought the quickening power The Life of
[21:56] Christ amen back to the the church to
[21:58] Quicken us out of denominations and
[22:01] Creeds into the
[22:03] word amen Quicken them out of these dead
[22:07] denominations and Creeds to The Living
[22:08] Word of the Living God oh what a
[22:11] resurrection that was what a
[22:13] resurrection this
[22:15] is at the end of the church ages Amen to
[22:19] bring us up out of the Creeds and ideas
[22:21] and the Darkness of man into the
[22:23] fullness of the light I want to turn to
[22:26] John 11
[22:28] we're going to spend a lot of time in
[22:29] the Book of John so keep your Bible
[22:31] handy and keep your place here in
[22:35] John and remember I want to look at our
[22:37] part in this resurrection and and we see
[22:40] now that the what a resurrection that
[22:42] was what a resurrection this is this is
[22:45] a resurrection that's going on
[22:47] resurrecting God's bride his true elect
[22:49] seed he's quickening them out of the
[22:51] deadness of denominations out of the
[22:53] darkness of denominations and Creeds and
[22:55] Quicken him into the fullness of Life In
[22:57] Christ because the son has got to be
[22:59] revealed again in the bride amen so he's
[23:02] got to bring them out of the trappings
[23:04] of denominations got to bring them out
[23:06] of the darkness of man's Creeds and
[23:07] man's interpretation of the word and
[23:09] bring them to the fullness of life so
[23:11] that they can manifest the sun
[23:13] again
[23:15] amen so in John chap 11 I want to look
[23:18] at The Story of Lazarus and I want to
[23:20] take this subject through this
[23:22] story and in John chap 11 we we've
[23:25] preached on this I want to just St a
[23:27] claimer I've preached done all of this
[23:28] before but my goodness it's come to life
[23:30] to me on a whole new level amen and so
[23:33] amen so don't expect it to be brand new
[23:35] just expect me to be excited about it
[23:37] amen amen in John 11 verse1 it says now
[23:42] a certain man was sick named Lazarus of
[23:44] Bethany the town of Mary and her sister
[23:47] Martha and it was that Mary which
[23:49] anointed the Lord with ointment and
[23:50] wiped his feet with her hair whose
[23:52] brother Lazarus was sing therefore his
[23:54] sisters sent unto him saying Lord behold
[23:57] he whom thou lovest is
[23:59] sick when Jesus heard that he said this
[24:02] sickness is not unto death before the
[24:04] glory of God that the Son of God might
[24:07] be glorified thereby now Jesus loved
[24:09] Martha and her sister and Lazarus when
[24:12] he had heard therefore that he was sick
[24:14] he Abode two days still in the same
[24:16] place where he was then after that saith
[24:19] he to his disciples let us go into Judea
[24:22] again so we find that word comes to
[24:24] Jesus that Lazarus is sick amen
[24:28] and it says the message says Lord whom
[24:31] the the one whom thou lovest is sick and
[24:34] so there was a acknowledgement that God
[24:36] loved Lazarus and the name Lazarus which
[24:39] I think is important in the story the
[24:41] name Lazarus means whom God helps whom
[24:44] God helps amen but it's amazing how God
[24:47] helps Lazarus amen it's not God's ways
[24:50] are not like our ways God's mind is not
[24:52] like our mind God doesn't think amen the
[24:54] way that we in human flesh think his
[24:56] thoughts are so much higher higher than
[24:58] ours when word comes that Lazarus thy
[25:00] friend is sick amen the one whom you
[25:02] love is sick Jesus doesn't jump up and
[25:05] run immediately to the word to go spare
[25:08] Lazarus from this trial and take away
[25:10] all his problems he delays two
[25:12] days amen and he makes a statement he
[25:15] says he says this sickness is not unto
[25:18] death but for the glory of God Amen that
[25:20] the Son of God might be glorified
[25:22] thereby amen Jesus is not jumping up to
[25:26] take away all of the pain and suffering
[25:28] and misery and sickness from Lazarus
[25:30] whom he loves because God knows that
[25:32] there's a greater purpose in this trial
[25:35] amen then if he would just take it away
[25:37] it wouldn't have come there's something
[25:38] greater coming to Lazarus and he's got
[25:41] to endure just a little bit longer so
[25:43] Jesus delays and his delay sometimes is
[25:46] so misinterpreted amen sometimes for us
[25:49] God delays we call and he doesn't come
[25:52] we call and he doesn't respond
[25:53] immediately we cry out God don't you see
[25:55] I'm sick I'm in need and all the a
[25:57] sudden there's a delay and all and the
[25:59] devil begins to work in the delay like
[26:02] well I thought that he loved him I
[26:03] thought that that you were the Beloved
[26:05] of the Lord I thought that his promises
[26:07] were to you and in the delay we can
[26:10] begin to misinterpret the
[26:14] delay amen it was no sign that he had
[26:17] lost love for Lazarus it was no sign
[26:19] that his affection had changed it was no
[26:21] sign that he had lost his
[26:23] power but he clearly stated that this
[26:26] sness he knew knew amen that this
[26:28] sickness was not unto death but for the
[26:30] glory of God that the son of man might
[26:34] be glorified thereby
[26:36] amen why was Lazarus
[26:39] suffering for the glory of God that's
[26:42] right why was Mary and Martha grieved
[26:45] for the glory of God why was Devastation
[26:49] hitting their house so that the son of
[26:51] man might be glorified
[26:55] thereby oh I pray that God is bringing
[26:57] us to another level of maturity amen
[26:59] where we start to see things the way God
[27:01] sees them and quit panicking every time
[27:03] something happen and say I don't
[27:05] understand it but there's a purpose
[27:07] behind it I don't know why it's delayed
[27:09] but he does everything well amen he
[27:11] hasn't changed his mind about me amen as
[27:13] we heard Wednesday night that was set in
[27:15] the mind of God before the foundation of
[27:17] the world he's not changing his mind
[27:19] he's not like a man who changes his mind
[27:21] brother man said he's not ever learning
[27:23] amen he knew from the beginning all
[27:24] things and God delays because the for
[27:27] the glor of God that the son of man
[27:29] might be glorified
[27:30] thereby let's not misinterpret amen the
[27:34] delay let's go to verse
[27:38] 11 these things said he and after that
[27:41] he saith unto them our friend Lazarus
[27:43] sleepeth but I go that I may wake him
[27:45] out of sleep then said his
[27:48] disciples then said his disciples Lord
[27:51] if he sleep he shall do well how be it
[27:53] Jesus spake of his death but they
[27:55] thought that he had SP spoken of taking
[27:57] of rest and sleep then said Jesus unto
[28:00] them plainly Lazarus is dead and I'm
[28:02] glad for your sakes that I was not
[28:06] there I thought he loved him I thought
[28:09] he loved Martha and Mary I thought he
[28:10] loved Lazarus and he and he says uh
[28:13] Lazarus is dead why did he say Lazarus
[28:16] was dead because first he told them the
[28:18] truth Lazarus sleepeth amen they didn't
[28:20] understand the language that he was
[28:22] speaking so he brought it down to a term
[28:23] they would understand Lazarus is dead
[28:26] and I'm glad for your sakes that I was
[28:28] not
[28:30] there amen what the disciples were going
[28:33] to benefit from this delay disciples
[28:35] were going to benefit amen from the
[28:37] situation going from bad to worse amen
[28:40] it went from bad to worse in the eyes of
[28:43] the human beings that were all around
[28:45] amen it went from bad to Impossible it
[28:48] went from bad to finish it went from bad
[28:50] to completely over amen but in the eyes
[28:53] of God there was nothing finished
[28:55] nothing over amen he already had a plan
[28:58] so the delay was perfect and Jesus tells
[29:01] his disciples amen I Lazarus is dead
[29:05] okay what you understand to be dead he's
[29:06] not breathing anymore the body's
[29:08] inanimate he's laid in the grave so so
[29:10] according to your language he's
[29:12] dead and I am glad I'm happy yeah for
[29:17] your sakes that I was not there to the
[29:19] intent that ye may believe nevertheless
[29:22] let us go unto
[29:24] him oh this is for the glory of God amen
[29:27] that the son of man might be glorified
[29:32] thereby man I don't know about you but
[29:35] as I stand and read this scripture I'm
[29:37] glad he didn't go
[29:40] amen because we know the rest of the
[29:42] story I'm glad he didn't go you know
[29:44] what I'm also glad that he didn't heal
[29:46] the prophet and me when the prophet had
[29:48] a stomach condition that cycled every
[29:50] seven years I'm glad he didn't heal him
[29:51] all along the way because along that
[29:53] he's showing his glory his strength his
[29:55] ability and at the End Amen when it
[29:57] comes into the eighth cycle then God
[29:59] shows him a vision and finishes I'm glad
[30:01] amen that there was somebody to show us
[30:03] the love of God continues through trials
[30:05] and God uses it for his
[30:09] purpose that was for my
[30:13] sake I'm glad for the trials that they
[30:16] all went through in the Bible it was for
[30:17] my I'm glad amen I'm glad for my sake
[30:21] that he didn't sh save them from all
[30:22] trouble I'm glad for my sake that he
[30:24] didn't keep them from ever having harm
[30:26] or any difficult ulty I'm so thankful
[30:29] now that I saw the hand of God come
[30:31] through trial and tribulation and
[30:32] hardship amen and it never changed God's
[30:35] love it never changed God's purpose amen
[30:37] it worked perfect according to his
[30:39] purpose and I'm glad for my
[30:41] sake that I might
[30:45] believe Amen brother Bram says amen you
[30:50] say brother Bram I'm a Christian and I
[30:52] got sick now I wonder why it
[30:54] come God may be purging you give you
[30:57] some trials make you draw a little
[30:58] closer to him pray a while then heal you
[31:01] that you can have a
[31:04] testimony amen you know anytime we come
[31:07] and ask somebody to share a
[31:10] testimony I I don't remember ever
[31:12] hearing a testimony that says I had no
[31:15] trouble I lived a perfect life I never
[31:18] suffered a day nothing ever went wrong
[31:21] and I just want to share that as a
[31:26] testimony our testimonies always start
[31:28] with
[31:30] trouble what we declare to our neighbors
[31:32] what we declare to our families what we
[31:34] declare to show the word of God is still
[31:36] in effect is when everything goes wrong
[31:38] and sometimes from bad to worse amen and
[31:41] then God comes on the scene and brings
[31:42] us amen from bad to worse to Impossible
[31:45] and brings a solution supernaturally all
[31:48] of a sudden now we've got a testimony
[31:50] for the glory of God so the son of man
[31:52] might be declared
[31:55] amen amen
[31:59] so let's go down to verse 17
[32:02] now then when Jesus come he found that
[32:05] he had Lain in the grave 4 days already
[32:08] now remember I remember when the
[32:10] prophecy went forth from David he said
[32:12] he not shall not let his holy one see
[32:14] corruption and the prophet of God brings
[32:16] us that verse over and over and shows
[32:18] see corruption sets in after 72 hours
[32:21] and so it shows it was a prophecy
[32:22] showing he would rise within 3 days he
[32:25] wouldn't let that body see corruption
[32:26] and now now we see here that he led in
[32:28] the grave four days already showing that
[32:30] corruption had already set into the
[32:32] flesh brother B said it already begin to
[32:34] rot amen Martha already says but by now
[32:37] Lord he
[32:39] stinketh amen you mean it went from bad
[32:43] to worst to impossible to finished yeah
[32:46] that body is now Rotten amen you think a
[32:49] rotten Body Matters an ounce to the
[32:50] person who created the body to begin
[32:52] with am me he created every cell created
[32:55] every atom created the DNA created the
[32:57] elements that he took your body out of
[32:59] Amen before there was anything you were
[33:00] in his mind and when he laid out the
[33:02] material on the earth your body was
[33:04] already laying there as a great
[33:05] Carpenter he laid out the material that
[33:07] would make you do you think a rotten
[33:09] body amen can stop it do you think a
[33:11] cancer cell do you think a perverted a
[33:13] perverted Life coming into your life to
[33:15] bring sickness would ever stop him
[33:17] there's nothing
[33:18] impossible it's never gone too
[33:21] far brother BR said there's a spoonful
[33:24] of Ashes he'll resurrect it in the end
[33:26] time
[33:27] [Music]
[33:28] amen and that's true for this
[33:30] Resurrection here how can our life get
[33:32] so degraded so cast down so far away
[33:35] from God that God can't raise it back
[33:37] amen by the quickening power of this
[33:40] word praise
[33:43] God praise
[33:46] God he laying in the grave four days
[33:49] already now Bethany was n into Jerusalem
[33:52] about 15 furlongs off and many of the
[33:55] Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort
[33:57] them concerning their brother then
[33:59] Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus
[34:01] was come went and met him but Mary sat
[34:04] still in the house then said Martha unto
[34:06] Jesus Lord if thou H has been here my
[34:09] brother had not
[34:10] died but I know that even now whatsoever
[34:13] thou will ask of God God will give it
[34:15] thee Jesus said unto her thy brother
[34:18] shall rise again Martha said unto him I
[34:21] know that he shall rise again in the
[34:22] resurrection at the last day Jesus said
[34:25] unto her I am the resurrection
[34:29] am I just want to say something if
[34:32] you're looking for the resurrection you
[34:34] can find it
[34:36] today he is the
[34:38] resurrection oh we're looking for a
[34:40] resurrection when all the Sleeping
[34:42] Saints through the seven Church ages
[34:43] will rise Amen in glorified bodies
[34:45] absolutely that still lays ahead of us
[34:47] but if you're looking for that
[34:49] Resurrection you can find it now today
[34:51] CU he is the resurrection and the
[34:55] life amen I am the resurrection and the
[34:58] life he that believeth in me though he
[35:00] were dead yet shall he live and
[35:03] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[35:05] shall never die believest thou this she
[35:09] said to him yay Lord I believe that thou
[35:11] art the Christ the son of God which
[35:12] should come into the world Amen Martha
[35:16] is not an unbeliever but she's a
[35:17] Believer
[35:19] amen amen so let's go to verse 33
[35:25] now
[35:29] verse
[35:30] 33 when Jesus therefore saw her weeping
[35:33] and the Jews also weeping which came
[35:35] with her he groaned in the spirit and
[35:37] was troubled and said where have you
[35:39] laid him they said unto him Lord come
[35:41] and see Jesus wept then said the Jews
[35:44] behold how he loved him and some of them
[35:47] said could not this man which opened the
[35:50] eyes of the blind have caused that even
[35:51] this man should not have died Jesus
[35:54] therefore again groaned in himself
[35:56] cometh to to the grave and it was a cave
[35:59] and a stone lay upon it Jesus was was
[36:04] groaning within himself and they they he
[36:08] saw the suffering he saw the Weeping and
[36:10] and they they they claimed that they
[36:12] believed whatever he said would happen
[36:14] and and now they're weeping CU Lazarus
[36:16] is gone and he's overcome with the with
[36:19] the whole scene amen and now they
[36:21] questioned they said look how he loved
[36:23] him if this man who loved him so
[36:25] couldn't he have prevented
[36:27] him from
[36:28] dying that's a good question if God
[36:31] loves you so much couldn't he have
[36:32] prevented all the hardship trials and
[36:34] troubles that were in your
[36:36] life the the truth is he could
[36:39] have but why didn't he maybe those
[36:42] trials are for the glory of God that the
[36:45] son of man might be glorified glorified
[36:48] thereby let's let him get glory in it
[36:52] all so then he he wants to know where
[36:55] they're laid where they've laid him and
[36:57] in verse 38 it says Jesus therefore
[36:59] again groan and himself come to the
[37:01] Grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon
[37:05] it where did they put him they put him
[37:07] in a cave and they rolled a big Stone
[37:10] across the face of it and I love what
[37:12] brother bam says in the restoration of
[37:14] the brid tree he makes a statement about
[37:16] the inment of Jesus Christ he says now
[37:19] to rid him out of their sight they hated
[37:21] him so bad because he tore up their
[37:24] organizations to rid him out of their
[37:26] sight they buried him and rolled a great
[37:28] big denominational Stone over the door
[37:31] so he'd be sure not to rise again amen
[37:35] what did they do to Christ amen what was
[37:37] Christ Christ was the anointed word for
[37:39] the day what did they do to Christ they
[37:41] took the word They Crucified the word
[37:44] they buried the word and they rolled a
[37:46] big denominational Stone over the door
[37:48] to make sure that the word didn't rise
[37:51] again that's exactly what denominations
[37:55] have done to this precious word it came
[37:57] forth on the day of Pentecost the
[37:59] promise came forth and what did they do
[38:01] immediately amen the devil got to work
[38:03] through the white horse rider amen and
[38:05] and the the red horse rider what's he
[38:07] doing he was trying to bury that word
[38:10] amen and roll a big denominational Stone
[38:12] over the door Amen to make sure it
[38:14] didn't Rise
[38:16] Again further in in the restoration of
[38:18] the Bride tree says then they didn't
[38:20] like it so many people standing there
[38:22] crying about it so they took him off
[38:24] they said well we'll make our denom
[38:26] Nation so tight that they'll never get
[38:28] them holy rollers in here so they scoot
[38:31] him back in a hole of Joseph of arthea
[38:34] and they rolled a great big Stone took a
[38:37] century of men to roll it up there did
[38:39] you ever see the other night in the
[38:40] picture the big path they rolled the
[38:42] stone up weighs tons rolled their big
[38:45] organization Stone up there so he could
[38:47] not raise up but did that hold him no
[38:51] but I will restore sayeth the Lord look
[38:54] what he goes to he doesn't just leave it
[38:56] there to ,000 years ago he comes right
[38:58] back to the church in the dark age but I
[39:00] will restore what's he preaching the
[39:02] restoration of the brid tree but I will
[39:05] restore sayeth the Lord let's hit that
[39:07] text now and drive it I will restore
[39:09] sayith the Lord I'll restore him three
[39:11] days I'll raise him back up they
[39:14] couldn't hide him in that
[39:17] rock what is what was that grave amen it
[39:21] was Rock Amen Rock symbolizes the word
[39:24] and rock symbolizes the Revelation but
[39:26] what they had done is they carved them
[39:28] out a hole and they took the word and
[39:30] they made a grave out of it man dug it
[39:33] out himself he chiseled out and dug it
[39:35] out and he made a man-made Stone amen
[39:38] and he shaped it to roll in front of the
[39:40] door amen what did he do they tried to
[39:42] take the word to bury the
[39:45] word what has denominations done what
[39:49] book do they use Amen to stop the word
[39:51] they use the same word amen that's
[39:53] supposed to bring life and they bring
[39:55] the same word in add their own
[39:56] interpretation to it and twist that word
[39:59] to bring
[40:01] death that's what serpent did to Eve
[40:03] amen all the way in the beginning he
[40:05] twisted the
[40:07] word and now their man-made ideas have
[40:09] dug out a grave and they take the word
[40:12] amen crucify the word and bury the word
[40:15] in their man-made cave and roll a
[40:17] man-made door over it to ceal him out
[40:19] and on top of that they have fixed the
[40:21] seal on Jesus Christ amen tomb and it
[40:24] was a Roman seal praise God amen why
[40:27] because on Easter morning he broke the
[40:29] Roman seal and rolled the stone away and
[40:32] the word came forth
[40:35] again the same things happened through
[40:37] the church ages amen he broke the Roman
[40:40] seal he rolled the stone away and Christ
[40:43] the word has returned to the
[40:45] church they couldn't keep him down under
[40:48] their man-made
[40:49] Stone right praise be to God this is
[40:54] just what man does he takes what was
[40:57] meant for life and he twists it into
[41:00] death and serves his own
[41:02] purpose because they love Darkness
[41:04] greater than
[41:06] light
[41:09] amen it was a misuse of the
[41:12] word how did they condemn Jesus they
[41:15] used they tried to use the law of
[41:20] Moses same thing with the disciples they
[41:22] they tried to condemn them using the law
[41:25] they tried to condemn Paul using the
[41:28] law they could justify killing them
[41:32] because of their Twisted understanding
[41:34] of the
[41:37] word
[41:39] amen don't think that spirit's
[41:42] gone still here trying to condemn
[41:45] crucify bury and keep buried the Living
[41:49] Word because it exposes the darkness of
[41:52] denominations exposes the darkness of
[41:54] religion in man's ideas that's right
[41:56] amen they would love to kill it put it
[41:58] in the grave and roll their own big
[42:01] understanding Rock right over it yeah
[42:03] but the Roman seal couldn't hold that
[42:07] stone and the Roman seal amen is a seal
[42:10] denominationalism because the first
[42:12] denomination is the Roman Catholic
[42:13] church amen that same Roman system that
[42:16] that was a pagan system moved to a paple
[42:18] system amen and it began the whole
[42:20] sequence of events that would end up
[42:22] where we are now with tens of thousands
[42:24] of denominations and what are they they
[42:26] are the harlots they are the daughters
[42:28] of the the great is the
[42:29] Catholic church but that church has
[42:31] daughters and those daughters are
[42:33] churches and those churches are the
[42:34] Protestant movements amen that have gone
[42:36] right back into the same
[42:38] denominationalism with taking man's
[42:39] ideas on the word amen and and and and
[42:42] hemming it down and pushing out the
[42:45] light they done the same
[42:48] thing so here we find Lazarus and where
[42:50] is Lazarus amen Lazarus was sick Hey
[42:53] listen I'll tell you we were all born
[42:55] sick in hybrid
[42:56] ization and Lazarus was sick we were
[42:59] born sick and why did God let this
[43:02] sickness come to this this sickness of
[43:03] hybridization the sickness of a mind
[43:05] darkened and alienated from God Amen why
[43:08] did we come this is for the glory of God
[43:11] also amen God didn't prevent it amen it
[43:15] happened that sickness came and that
[43:16] sickness moved into death and when when
[43:19] Lazarus died they stuck him in a
[43:21] man-made cave and they rolled a man-made
[43:23] rock over the
[43:24] door and they buried him under the
[43:30] stone but in Psalms 41 verse one it says
[43:34] I waited patiently for the Lord and He
[43:37] inclined unto me and he heard My Cry he
[43:39] brought me up also out of the horrible
[43:41] pit out of the my clay and he set my
[43:43] feet upon a rock and established my
[43:45] goings what does God do with the rock
[43:48] God doesn't stick you under the Rock and
[43:50] seal you away under a man-made Stone but
[43:53] God sits you upon the rock the rock
[43:55] becomes the foundation of the Believers
[43:57] a firm foundation that makes them
[44:00] unmovable amen it's the foundation stone
[44:03] in Christ was the Chief Cornerstone the
[44:05] foundation that the apostles and
[44:07] Prophets built off of to make a
[44:09] foundation of the word to do what to
[44:11] lift his children higher in Revelation
[44:13] not put them under the ground but the
[44:16] systems of man take the word to bury the
[44:20] Believers buried in denomination buried
[44:22] in Tradition buried in Dogma buried in
[44:25] Creed
[44:27] but God takes us out of the grave and
[44:30] sets us upon the
[44:33] rockah in Psalms
[44:36] 27 which is the psalm brother bham goes
[44:38] to in the Rapture in verse 5 he says for
[44:41] in a time of trouble he shall hide me in
[44:43] his Pavilion in the secret of his
[44:45] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[44:47] me up upon a rock and now shall my head
[44:51] be lifted above mine enemies around
[44:53] about me therefore will I offer in his
[44:55] Tabernacle Le sacrifices of Joy I will
[44:58] sing yeah I will sing praises into the
[45:00] Lord when is he going to sing praises
[45:02] into the Lord in the time of
[45:05] trouble why can he sing praises into the
[45:07] joy why can he be joyful because God has
[45:10] set him up upon a rock and lifted his
[45:13] head up above and this doesn't just mean
[45:15] amen that he's a physically higher than
[45:17] all of his all of his enemies when he
[45:19] set him on the Rock and lifted his head
[45:22] he brought his Revelation and
[45:24] understanding higher than all of his en
[45:25] enemies and he could realize though a
[45:27] host to Camp about me they won't destroy
[45:30] me though they all gather they won't
[45:32] defeat God's purpose inside of me
[45:34] because he has set me on this rock of
[45:36] revelation of his word and now my head
[45:38] is higher than all my
[45:45] enemies that's what God does the for
[45:47] with the rock for the
[45:49] Believers man's constantly trying to put
[45:52] get you in the system and Under The Rock
[45:54] and trap you
[45:56] yeah with the
[45:58] word but God is freeing us with the word
[46:02] and the same rock that the denom are
[46:04] trying to put us under Christ is taking
[46:06] us out and putting us on the
[46:09] Rock and it becomes the foundation stone
[46:12] for us remember the rock that was cut
[46:14] out of the mountain without hands Amen
[46:16] in Daniel's Vision That Rock Amen
[46:19] whomever that rock fell on it crushed
[46:21] him and ground the powder amen but
[46:23] whoever fell on the Rock Amen was broken
[46:26] and rebuilt amen I want to fall on the
[46:28] Rock Amen I want to fall on that
[46:30] foundation stone amen The Rock when when
[46:33] Jesus was giving the parable and said
[46:35] two men build a house one in sand one on
[46:37] the Rock Amen and the storms came amen
[46:41] listen in both of their lives storms
[46:43] came neither one was spared the storm
[46:46] right the Christian or the make believer
[46:49] they both had the same storm amen and
[46:52] against the both houses the storm and
[46:55] the wind and and the waves beat
[46:58] vehemently Hey listen just because one
[47:01] person had chose the better place to
[47:02] build his house didn't mean he had any
[47:04] less of a
[47:05] storm than the foolish man the wise man
[47:08] and the foolish man had the same storm
[47:10] the same trial with the same
[47:14] intensity the difference was the
[47:16] foundation amen one was on the sinking
[47:19] sand of man's ideas and traditions and
[47:21] dogmas increase the other one was
[47:22] planted on the Firm Foundation of the
[47:24] revelation of Jes Jesus
[47:26] Christ and it became unmovable no matter
[47:30] what storm came it was
[47:33] unmovable that's what the word is to the
[47:36] believer the foundation the support the
[47:38] underg guarding that lifts us up amen
[47:41] even the scripture says uh Jesus is a
[47:44] our Lord is a strong tower the name of
[47:46] the Lord is a strong tower that the
[47:47] righteous run into in our safe a strong
[47:50] tower is not a dungeon a strong tower is
[47:52] Stone built together that lifts you
[47:54] higher above the storm
[47:58] praise God so when you see a system of
[48:00] man amen I don't care where it's at when
[48:03] they try to keep people under the word
[48:05] and pushed down and locked down by the
[48:07] word I would flee from that because this
[48:10] word is supposed to put us on a
[48:11] foundation stone amen and Lift Us higher
[48:14] not push us
[48:17] lower praise be to
[48:19] God
[48:22] Amen then we come to John
[48:28] 11:38 verse 39 I
[48:31] mean Jesus said take ye away the
[48:38] stone Martha the sister of him that was
[48:40] dead sayith in him Lord by this time he
[48:43] stinketh for he has been dead four
[48:48] days Jesus said to
[48:54] them take ye away the
[48:58] stone Jesus wasn't going to take it
[49:01] away he know he knew what God would do
[49:05] he knew the sickness was not unto death
[49:07] before it
[49:09] started he knew that there'd be a
[49:11] resurrection because he says Lazarus is
[49:12] asleep but I go to wake him he knew he
[49:15] was coming in a resurrection Ministry in
[49:18] the resurrection phase of his ministry
[49:20] he knew he was coming Amen to speak the
[49:22] word that would resurrect
[49:24] Lazarus
[49:26] but Jesus wasn't going to do it all by
[49:32] himself he come and he says ye take away
[49:36] the
[49:37] stone amen and brother Bram tells us God
[49:41] always works through man man is God's
[49:44] agency amen he says he says they went
[49:48] down to the Grave there stood a man
[49:49] there stood God in flesh that could have
[49:51] said to the stone dissolve and it would
[49:54] have dissolved this man who could walk
[49:56] on water he could break bread and
[49:58] multiply amen he could speak to the
[50:00] storm and the winds and the waves and
[50:01] they ceas he could have spoke that that
[50:03] stone right out of existence he could
[50:05] have rolled it away with his word amen
[50:07] whatever he wanted to do he could have
[50:08] done but he did exactly what he wanted
[50:10] and intended to
[50:12] do he could have dissolved it but he
[50:15] said to them women them Poor Little
[50:17] Women little young woman said take away
[50:19] the stone you got something to do too
[50:22] amen they rolled away the stone praise
[50:25] God Amen we want God to do all the work
[50:28] amen but there's something for us to do
[50:30] too we've got to testify we've got to
[50:33] declare we've got to roll the stone away
[50:35] amen so that somebody can hear the voice
[50:38] of God in this Resurrection season cuz
[50:40] what a resurrection that was what a
[50:42] resurrection this is this is the
[50:45] Resurrection season this is resurrection
[50:48] out of Dead denominationalism Rising to
[50:50] the fullness of Christ in the bright a
[50:52] to the full risen son this is the
[50:55] resurrection this is the season of
[50:57] Resurrection but in the season of
[50:59] Resurrection somebody's got to roll the
[51:01] stone
[51:02] away who's going to do that I say God
[51:05] help me amen give me strength give me
[51:08] wisdom give me the understanding to roll
[51:10] people Stones away brother Jad how you
[51:12] do that I don't know how to do it I
[51:14] don't know how they did it all I know is
[51:16] he said roll the stone away and if I can
[51:18] expose denomination if I can tell people
[51:20] that that stone is holding you down but
[51:22] there's more to this word there's more
[51:24] to this life if if I can roll that
[51:26] denominational Stone off the mouth of a
[51:28] cave amen then he can speak to them and
[51:32] they can be
[51:35] resurrected
[51:36] amen he says the prophet again says
[51:39] remember God only works through man he
[51:41] chose man he could have he could have
[51:44] had the gospel preached through the
[51:45] stars or through the trees or through
[51:47] the wind but he chose man amen
[51:53] amen we'll see the this as we keep
[51:56] moving let's look at verse
[51:59] 41 then they took away the Stone from
[52:02] the place where the dead was laid and
[52:05] Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father
[52:08] I thank thee that thou has heard me and
[52:11] I knew that thou hearest me always but
[52:13] because of the people which stood by I
[52:15] said it that they might believe that
[52:17] thou Hast sent me and when he had thus
[52:19] spoken he cried with a loud voice
[52:21] Lazarus come forth and he that was dead
[52:23] came forth bound handed foot with grave
[52:26] clothes here he speaks to Lazarus amen
[52:30] they they rolled the stone away you know
[52:33] it's amazing Jesus had the power of
[52:39] Resurrection but he didn't speak until
[52:41] they got into action and rolled the
[52:43] stone
[52:46] away what's the point of resurrecting
[52:49] Lazarus to keep him behind the
[52:51] rock
[52:54] right Lord to keep him trapped in man's
[52:57] Traditions to keep him trapped amen
[52:59] behind the rock of false revelation of
[53:02] denominationalism why resurrect him to
[53:04] keep him behind the we got to move that
[53:06] stone away amen so they can come to life
[53:08] and recognize that they're free they
[53:09] don't have to stay there you don't have
[53:11] to stay in all these Traditions you
[53:12] don't have to stay in all these ideas of
[53:14] men but you can come
[53:16] out when you hear his
[53:19] voice and this is this is a this quote
[53:22] that I want to get to and it was so
[53:23] astounding me amen because I knew that I
[53:26] wanted the preest this more than a week
[53:27] ago amen so when brother brother Ben
[53:29] came and used this quote I was I was
[53:31] sitting in my study watching the Serv I
[53:33] was like oh man they got my
[53:39] quote he said Is it true that every Jew
[53:42] born since Christ that come into the
[53:43] world is to be saved this is questions
[53:45] and answers on the seals said no nothing
[53:47] will be saved only those whose names are
[53:49] put on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[53:50] the foundation of the world Jew or
[53:52] Gentile see that's all the book holds
[53:54] the mystery and the book is only
[53:56] unfolding it now not each one's name but
[54:00] what the mystery of the book is while
[54:01] it's calling those
[54:04] names you understand now see the book
[54:08] doesn't say now le Veil is to be saved
[54:10] in the time of this church age or or man
[54:13] Neville or whoever no it don't say that
[54:15] it just shows the mystery unfolds the
[54:17] mystery of what the the thing is but we
[54:20] ourselves by faith believe
[54:23] it amen what is it what is called the
[54:27] resurrection in this season it's the
[54:29] voice of God Amen it's the voice of
[54:31] Christ calling out to us how is he
[54:33] calling our name remember when he says
[54:35] he he didn't say come forth because if
[54:38] he would have hollered come forth
[54:39] brother Braham said everyone that had
[54:41] been laying there dead would have come
[54:43] cuz he's the voice of the Resurrection
[54:45] he is the resurrection and the life and
[54:47] if he would have screamed with a loud
[54:48] voice come forth everybody would have
[54:50] come forth but he was specific amen he
[54:53] wasn't calling everybody forth in this
[54:55] this Resurrection he was only calling a
[54:57] certain one forth in this Resurrection
[54:59] he was calling the one whose name was
[55:00] Lazarus whom God helps amen and Lazarus
[55:04] needed God's help CU he was dead in sin
[55:06] and trespasses he was locked behind
[55:08] denominational walls amen but he needed
[55:11] God's
[55:12] help and he was looking for somebody
[55:15] specific to resurrect in this age and he
[55:17] said Lazarus come forth amen and and how
[55:20] is he calling your name today brother
[55:23] man says he's not saying leave
[55:25] or or Orman Neville what he's doing is
[55:27] he's unfolding the mystery that was
[55:29] trapped behind those seals The Mystery
[55:31] of the entire book The Mystery of God
[55:33] and as he unfolds the mystery it calls
[55:36] your name amen because your name is
[55:39] Jesus Christ amen when it comes down to
[55:41] it you're part of Christ the whole
[55:43] family in Heaven and Earth is named
[55:45] Jesus Christ you're part of that word
[55:49] when the word unfolds it calls your name
[55:51] because it's word coming to word and
[55:54] there's a connection of of life to life
[55:56] and the word Springs forth responding to
[56:02] itself what's the voice calling you what
[56:05] called you amen did you hear your name
[56:08] no well you didn't hear the Earthly name
[56:10] you have with the pronunciation and
[56:11] whatever your mother tongue was amen you
[56:14] realize it's not that kind of language
[56:16] it's a language of Revelation it's a
[56:18] language of the word it transcends vocal
[56:21] language amen we may use vocabulary we
[56:25] may use the vocal cords to declare it
[56:27] but there could be a man standing here
[56:28] in this pull pit preaching but you're
[56:30] not hearing a man what wakes that seed
[56:33] up is the very voice of God speaking to
[56:35] you and that voice of God may come
[56:37] through human lips but the voice of God
[56:39] is the manifested word for this day it
[56:43] is the word amen that has been locked up
[56:46] in the mind of God separated from the
[56:48] understanding of man behind those seals
[56:50] that has come forth that is the voice of
[56:52] God in this day and it's calling a resur
[56:54] Resurrection not for all to come out of
[56:56] the grave but only for his
[56:59] bride he's calling Bride come out of the
[57:03] Grave Mrs Jesus Christ
[57:07] arise and if you're Mrs Jesus Christ you
[57:10] hear your name
[57:16] Co let's turn back to John chapter 5 for
[57:19] just a
[57:23] minute
[57:25] John chapter 5 verse
[57:32] 24 says verily verily I say unto you
[57:36] this is John 5:24 verily verily I say
[57:38] unto you he that heareth my word and
[57:41] believeth on him that sent me hath
[57:43] everlasting life it shall not come into
[57:45] the condemnation but is passed from
[57:47] death into life verily verily I say unto
[57:50] you the hour is coming and now is amen
[57:55] yeah when the dead shall hear the voice
[57:57] of the Son of God and they that hear
[57:59] shall
[58:00] live amen I'm telling you the
[58:03] resurrection is on now amen there's
[58:06] those that are dead in sin and
[58:07] trespasses I was dead in sin and
[58:09] trespasses amen but that the hour is
[58:11] coming no for me the hour was
[58:14] now when though I was dead and separated
[58:17] from God Amen alienated from the things
[58:19] of God but I Heard a Voice amen I heard
[58:23] a voice and it may been on a magnetic
[58:25] tape because back then I still listen to
[58:28] tapes but I listened to a tape and I
[58:31] heard a voice of a man from Kentucky but
[58:33] there was something behind the voice
[58:35] that struck something in me and it
[58:38] wasn't just a human lip to a human ear
[58:40] but it was lip of God to ear of my soul
[58:43] and there was a connection made and I
[58:45] come out of that dead denominationalism
[58:47] I awoke out of the darkness of
[58:50] [Music]
[58:52] man so the hour is coming and now now is
[58:56] cuz this is the Resurrection
[58:59] season when those that are dead shall
[59:02] hear the voice of the Son of God then
[59:04] they that hear shall
[59:09] live they that
[59:11] here brother bam told
[59:14] us we you go to John or I'm sorry you go
[59:17] to Revelations chapter 2 and chapter 3
[59:20] the spirit now saith to him that hath an
[59:22] ear let him hear
[59:25] amen you realize everybody that's born
[59:28] has
[59:30] ears and by and large the majority can
[59:33] hear out of those ears there are some
[59:34] that are born deaf but the normal is
[59:36] people are born than they can
[59:38] hear but this is speaking about a
[59:40] different kind of
[59:42] hearing he that hath ears let him hear
[59:45] amen and Jesus says all that hear the
[59:49] voice of the son of man amen that that
[59:52] that is not just vocal cords hitting
[59:54] this amen but if you hear the voice with
[59:56] the same ears the spirit was speaking to
[59:59] the church in Revelations 2 and 3 that
[1:00:01] same ear can hear the same voice
[1:00:05] today and if that ear hears that voice
[1:00:09] it brings a
[1:00:12] resurrection but somebody has to roll
[1:00:15] the stone
[1:00:16] away somebody's got to be willing to say
[1:00:19] you
[1:00:20] know those denominations aren't right
[1:00:24] yeah you know God never
[1:00:27] ordained
[1:00:29] that you know you can be free you don't
[1:00:32] have to stay stuck in a tradition you
[1:00:33] don't have to stay stuck you can believe
[1:00:35] all the
[1:00:36] word and all the word can work in your
[1:00:39] life amen somebody's got to roll the
[1:00:42] stone
[1:00:44] away let's go back to John chapter
[1:00:51] 11 John Chapter
[1:00:53] 11
[1:00:55] in verse
[1:01:02] 44 and he that was dead came forth bound
[1:01:05] hand and foot with grave clothes and his
[1:01:08] face was bound with a napkin Jesus said
[1:01:10] unto him loose him and let him
[1:01:14] go amen it's
[1:01:17] amazing that he's resurrected from the
[1:01:21] dead the stone was rolled away
[1:01:24] the voice of the Resurrection called his
[1:01:27] name and he come to life but he came out
[1:01:31] of the Grave still Bound in Graves cloth
[1:01:34] amen he was alive he was resurrected
[1:01:38] amen he he had heard the voice the stone
[1:01:41] was rolled away light struck the seed
[1:01:43] the voice of the Resurrection struck the
[1:01:45] seed inside he come to life but he's
[1:01:49] limited he can't see clearly cuz there's
[1:01:52] a napkin over his face so maybe the
[1:01:54] light coming through he could walk out
[1:01:55] of the Grave cuz he could see the light
[1:01:57] and walk towards the light he could hear
[1:01:59] some things through the napkin he was
[1:02:00] moving amen but he was limited Amen in
[1:02:03] his movement he was obstructed amen why
[1:02:06] because before they stuffed him in a
[1:02:08] man-made cave they wrapped him in grave
[1:02:10] clothes to keep him Bound in death they
[1:02:13] clothed him for death they did not
[1:02:15] clothe him for
[1:02:17] life he had grave clothes not Life
[1:02:19] clothes amen because the dirty rags of
[1:02:22] man's denomination and man's right is a
[1:02:25] grave clothes that's wrapped around a
[1:02:26] many a human being and when he come
[1:02:29] forth Jesus had did his part the voice
[1:02:31] of the resurrection and woke him up and
[1:02:33] now Jesus says loose
[1:02:36] him you loose him amen you take those
[1:02:39] dirty rags off of him you tell him the
[1:02:41] truth you show him the word teach him
[1:02:44] amen take those grave clothes off of
[1:02:50] him amen what is our job in this
[1:02:53] Resurrection amen he's showing us what
[1:02:55] our job is amen we're here amen as
[1:02:58] agents of God on this Earth amen and we
[1:03:00] can roll that Big Stone of denomination
[1:03:02] away and let the revelation of the word
[1:03:04] strike somebody's heart and they come to
[1:03:06] life but when they come up it's not an
[1:03:08] instant Freedom amen they're still
[1:03:10] dragging along the baggage from
[1:03:12] denomination dragging along Baptist
[1:03:14] Theology and Pentecostal Theology and
[1:03:17] all Catholic theology and they're all
[1:03:19] bound up and tight but God wants us set
[1:03:21] free amen and so what does he say he
[1:03:23] speaks to his agents that are around him
[1:03:25] he said loose him and let him go free
[1:03:28] teach him the truth show him the word
[1:03:31] free him from all of those
[1:03:32] denominational systems from The Works of
[1:03:35] man from The Bondage of misunderstanding
[1:03:37] free
[1:03:38] him Jesus said our Creeds and
[1:03:40] denominations has bound many of our
[1:03:44] people that's true and they come forth
[1:03:48] even coming to the message they're
[1:03:49] sometimes still
[1:03:51] bound amen abely that's why sometimes it
[1:03:55] takes some
[1:03:56] patience you realize what's wrong with
[1:03:59] you didn't you hear the voice of yeah I
[1:04:00] heard the voice of the
[1:04:05] Resurrection amen why there's still
[1:04:08] people they've heard the voice of the
[1:04:09] Resurrection they've come to life but
[1:04:11] they're still Bound by Traditions amen
[1:04:13] and what's it going to take it's going
[1:04:15] to take the brothers and sisters that
[1:04:16] are around Amen to loose them from the
[1:04:19] bondage of denominational thinking
[1:04:21] because it's been entrained in them
[1:04:22] since they were children amen I have to
[1:04:24] do this to have the Holy Ghost I've got
[1:04:26] to do this to please God to be a
[1:04:28] Christian I have to do this if this
[1:04:29] happens God's mad at me amen we got to
[1:04:31] loose them from all of those grave
[1:04:34] clothes so that they can go free and
[1:04:37] what do we loose them with the word of
[1:04:38] God that's been revealed in this hour
[1:04:40] this message that's put in our hands
[1:04:42] amen it's the scissors that cut the
[1:04:44] grave clothes and unwinds them from all
[1:04:46] the the false teaching over 2,000
[1:04:49] years
[1:04:52] amen amen amen and John chapter 8 flip
[1:04:56] back there with me for just a
[1:04:58] minute John chapter
[1:05:02] 8 verse
[1:05:07] 31 then said Jesus to those Jews which
[1:05:10] believed on him if you continue in my
[1:05:13] word then you are my disciples indeed
[1:05:15] now listen he didn't say if you follow
[1:05:18] me right now yeah
[1:05:22] amen they were disciples right then but
[1:05:24] many of them wouldn't be disciples
[1:05:28] later if you continue in my
[1:05:32] word why because in order to prove that
[1:05:35] you're seed you've got to go all the way
[1:05:37] to the end Judas went far he made it to
[1:05:41] the Last Supper he went through feet
[1:05:44] washing he went through communion but he
[1:05:46] didn't make it to
[1:05:48] Pentecost if you continue in my word
[1:05:50] then you are my disciple indeed and ye
[1:05:53] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[1:05:56] make you
[1:05:58] free what what will make them free and
[1:06:00] listen I love the next statement they
[1:06:03] answered him we be Abraham's seed and
[1:06:05] we're never in bondage to any man how
[1:06:07] sayest thou you shall that that ye shall
[1:06:10] be made free they're all of a sudden
[1:06:12] confused we're Christians yeah
[1:06:16] right what do you mean we're in bondage
[1:06:19] we're
[1:06:20] Christians and and he goes on he says
[1:06:22] Jesus answered them verely verily I say
[1:06:24] unto you whosoever committeth sin sin is
[1:06:26] unbelief amen is the servant of sin and
[1:06:29] the servant abideth not in the house
[1:06:31] forever but the son abideth ever if the
[1:06:33] son therefore shall make you free ye
[1:06:35] shall be free indeed I know that you're
[1:06:38] Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me
[1:06:40] because my word hath no place in you I
[1:06:43] speak that which I have seen with my
[1:06:45] father and you do that which you have
[1:06:46] seen with your father all of a sudden
[1:06:48] they're all kinds of confused because
[1:06:50] Jesus says if you if you continue in my
[1:06:53] word amen men then you shall be my
[1:06:55] disciples indeed and you shall know the
[1:06:57] truth and the truth shall make you free
[1:06:59] what makes us free the truth makes us
[1:07:01] free Hey listen it doesn't matter what
[1:07:04] your situation is the truth makes you
[1:07:06] free you say I'm I'm in a bad situation
[1:07:10] at work I'm in a bad situation in my
[1:07:11] home I'm in a bad situation in my family
[1:07:14] you are free if the truth has set you
[1:07:17] free amen because what is the real
[1:07:19] bondage in this life it's not even being
[1:07:21] in prison it's not even being sick amen
[1:07:23] that's not the real bondage the real
[1:07:25] bondage is having your mind alienated
[1:07:27] and darkened against the things of God
[1:07:29] and and absolutely being separated from
[1:07:31] the life of God what is freedom when
[1:07:33] that truth sets us
[1:07:36] free that's the real freedom and the sun
[1:07:39] shall make you
[1:07:41] free you'll be free indeed let's go back
[1:07:44] to John chapter
[1:07:49] 11 see as we follow the
[1:07:51] Story of Lazarus
[1:07:56] we find in the Resurrection
[1:07:58] season Jesus Christ the manifested word
[1:08:02] for his day was in
[1:08:05] partnership with the people in that day
[1:08:08] and I believe he's in partnership with
[1:08:09] his
[1:08:11] bride amen the prophet of God told us
[1:08:14] that the the the voice of God is in the
[1:08:18] bride she is the mouthpiece of God she
[1:08:21] is the one declaring the word she is one
[1:08:24] propagating the message she is one who's
[1:08:25] been given this
[1:08:28] treasure and God is in Partnership he is
[1:08:31] the voice of the
[1:08:32] Resurrection bringing life but he's
[1:08:35] asking us to roll away the
[1:08:39] stone he's asking us when somebody goes
[1:08:42] free would you take a little
[1:08:44] time and loose
[1:08:48] them I mean would you I I imagine that
[1:08:51] process wasn't quick or easy easy they
[1:08:55] were bound and wrapped in grave
[1:08:57] clothes right and when when Martha said
[1:09:02] surely Lord when he said roll away the
[1:09:03] stone he stinketh by now though Lazarus
[1:09:07] was completely restored inside those
[1:09:09] grave clothes I'm sure those grave
[1:09:11] clothes still
[1:09:14] sankk I'm sure they were a little
[1:09:17] corrupted and a bit
[1:09:20] nasty but somebody had to go take those
[1:09:23] off of Lazarus so that he could go
[1:09:26] free am mean can we be patient enough to
[1:09:28] draw alongside somebody and unwrap
[1:09:32] them amen although the clothes May stink
[1:09:35] and though we may not like it and it's
[1:09:37] foul in many ways can we take a little
[1:09:39] time and unbind them to say oh praise
[1:09:43] God yeah yeah you you heard the truth
[1:09:45] you come to life and there's yeah I'm
[1:09:50] alive and we don't want to be partially
[1:09:52] Unbound I don't want to be partially
[1:09:54] Unbound I want to be completely set
[1:09:57] free amen I don't want to be dragging
[1:09:59] around old grave clothes old stinky
[1:10:01] nasty Creeds and dogmas of man amen
[1:10:04] still wrapped around my leg still tied
[1:10:05] around my ankle still inhibiting my
[1:10:07] movement I don't want any grave clothes
[1:10:09] on me and we realize friends when we
[1:10:11] come out of the darkness of denomination
[1:10:13] sometimes it takes a long time for the
[1:10:15] word to wash that stuff out of us but oh
[1:10:18] our brothers and sisters can help us go
[1:10:20] free amen we can recognize in one
[1:10:22] another hey brother have youever ever
[1:10:23] thought about this or or when somebody
[1:10:25] comes and they say we have to do this
[1:10:27] and we have to do that you can say why
[1:10:29] do you have to do this and why the
[1:10:31] prophet said this the scripture says
[1:10:34] this amen Let's help each other get free
[1:10:37] from our own grave
[1:10:38] clothes I want to be completely free in
[1:10:41] this day of
[1:10:42] Resurrection don't want to be inhibited
[1:10:45] or limited or still with the stink of a
[1:10:48] Creed amen that's right that had been
[1:10:51] wrapped for death yeah
[1:10:54] don't want it still tied to me in any
[1:10:56] way but I want to go free amen it's why
[1:11:00] I love so much the preaching of the word
[1:11:02] man I can sit under the preaching of the
[1:11:04] word and God can use a vessel to start
[1:11:06] pulling more of those threads
[1:11:08] away
[1:11:10] amen
[1:11:12] amen let's now go to let's go to John 12
[1:11:22] now this is after the
[1:11:25] resurrection of Lazarus and he's
[1:11:27] restored he's
[1:11:29] freed says verse one chapter 12:1 then
[1:11:32] Jesus 6 days before the Passover came to
[1:11:34] Bethany where Lazarus was which had been
[1:11:37] dead whom he raised from the dead so he
[1:11:40] comes back to the same place now only
[1:11:43] Lazarus is very much alive restored to
[1:11:45] his
[1:11:46] sisters and let's go to verse
[1:11:50] n says much people of the Jews therefore
[1:11:52] knew that he was was there and they came
[1:11:55] not for jesus' sake only but that they
[1:11:58] might see Lazarus also who him whom he
[1:12:01] had raised from the
[1:12:02] dead but the chief priest consulted that
[1:12:05] they might put Lazarus also to death
[1:12:08] because that by reason of him many of
[1:12:10] the Jews went away and believed on
[1:12:14] Jesus oh praise
[1:12:17] God when Jesus says this sickness is not
[1:12:21] unto death he knew knew what he was
[1:12:23] talking about this sickness is not un
[1:12:26] death but for the glory of God that the
[1:12:28] son of man might be glorified thereby
[1:12:30] because now Lazarus was the one who was
[1:12:33] called from the grave Lazarus was the
[1:12:35] one who was set free Lazarus was now
[1:12:37] resurrected and Lazarus was testifying
[1:12:40] of Christ amen now they didn't want to
[1:12:42] just kill Jesus but now they had to kill
[1:12:45] Lazarus because Lazarus was the reason
[1:12:47] people were
[1:12:49] believing why did God bring you to life
[1:12:52] why did he bring you out of the
[1:12:53] denomination why is he cut the grave
[1:12:55] clothes off of you so that somebody else
[1:12:57] can believe in this resurrected Christ
[1:12:59] in our day the one who has the voice of
[1:13:02] the Resurrection the one who is the
[1:13:03] resurrection and the life today amen the
[1:13:05] resurrection and the life is here today
[1:13:08] and who's testifying of it who's giving
[1:13:10] witness of it amen there's been
[1:13:12] lazarus's Lazarus is he whom God helps I
[1:13:15] was a Lazarus but I'm one who God helped
[1:13:17] he brought me out of the Grave amen
[1:13:19] there was somebody that he could tell to
[1:13:21] roll the stone away and when I was
[1:13:23] trapped in darkness God would send a
[1:13:25] friend along who would begin to testify
[1:13:27] of the truth and say God sent a prophet
[1:13:29] and these denominational systems are a
[1:13:31] man and somebody rolled the doorway for
[1:13:33] me and gave me some tapes and I heard
[1:13:36] the voice
[1:13:37] myself and I came to life but I'm so
[1:13:40] thankful there was a body of Believers
[1:13:42] around who were patient and kind and
[1:13:44] endured all my foolishness as a young
[1:13:46] believer so that they could help unwrap
[1:13:48] all the grave clothes off of me so that
[1:13:50] I could go free and what was the purpose
[1:13:52] of all of it amen amen for the glory of
[1:13:54] God Amen so the son of man can be
[1:13:56] glorified
[1:14:00] thereby this sickness is not unto death
[1:14:04] this sickness of hybridization that we
[1:14:05] all fell into this sickness is not unto
[1:14:09] death amen God could have stopped it
[1:14:12] amen but he didn't stop it because it's
[1:14:14] for the glory of
[1:14:15] God Amen the Fall In the Garden of Eden
[1:14:18] amen it's for the glory of God and that
[1:14:20] the son of man might be glorified
[1:14:22] thereby amen our hybridization the fall
[1:14:25] of the world Amen the earth going into
[1:14:27] chaos what's it for it's for the glory
[1:14:29] of
[1:14:32] God this sickness was not unto
[1:14:35] death amen even though I was trapped in
[1:14:38] the deadness of denominationalism and
[1:14:40] dead and separated from God the purpose
[1:14:44] was not for death but the purpose was
[1:14:46] for life so that he could come in the
[1:14:50] end time the voice of the resurrection
[1:14:51] and bring me out of of the Grave
[1:14:55] amen so that now they don't just have a
[1:14:58] problem with Jesus they have a problem
[1:15:01] with he whom God
[1:15:06] helps I'm telling you it's a good thing
[1:15:08] when they have a problem with
[1:15:12] you why because you're testifying of the
[1:15:15] Resurrection this is for the son of man
[1:15:18] to be glorified
[1:15:21] thereby amen
[1:15:25] they knew they came to Jesus at Martha
[1:15:30] and Mary and lazarus's house not just
[1:15:33] because Jesus was there but because
[1:15:35] Lazarus whom he raised from the dead was
[1:15:37] there right why cuz Lazarus had a
[1:15:40] testimony that I was dead but now I'm
[1:15:43] alive all his family around him knew he
[1:15:46] was dead he was buried he was
[1:15:49] stinking you know some of us were dead
[1:15:52] and we were stinking
[1:15:54] already our lives were in chaos and in
[1:15:57] ruin and even we were trying to be
[1:15:58] Christians we were doing a lousy job of
[1:16:01] it our hypocrisy was bleeding through we
[1:16:04] had stinky grave clothes of
[1:16:06] denominational Creeds and dogmas trying
[1:16:08] to live a life with no Holy Ghost to
[1:16:10] live no new birth but with an old nature
[1:16:12] trying to live a Christian Life and we
[1:16:13] were wrapped in death garments and we
[1:16:15] were stinking
[1:16:16] already and our family knew it and there
[1:16:19] was plenty around that could testify of
[1:16:20] Lazarus Resurrection amen you could say
[1:16:22] I live such a horrible life I was such a
[1:16:24] hypocrite I did so many wrong things
[1:16:26] that just means there's plenty of people
[1:16:28] around to witness that you were
[1:16:29] resurrected from the dead there's plenty
[1:16:31] of people to testify that you heard the
[1:16:33] voice of resurrection and you come to
[1:16:35] life and now they're testifying you're
[1:16:37] testifying and everybody's testimony is
[1:16:39] collaborating that they were this way
[1:16:41] but something miraculously changed in
[1:16:43] their life and now look at them they're
[1:16:45] free they're alive they're healthy
[1:16:47] they're vibrant they're serving God and
[1:16:49] what are they doing they're testifying
[1:16:51] that Christ is alive and Christ is is
[1:16:53] here and he has the power of
[1:16:57] resurrection and now they don't just
[1:17:00] want to kill
[1:17:02] Jesus they want to kill
[1:17:06] Lazarus is it any wonder why brother bam
[1:17:08] said they're going to have a cowardly
[1:17:10] plot to try to shut down the bride but
[1:17:12] they'll never stop her she'll be caught
[1:17:17] up why because as we begin to testify
[1:17:21] and manifest the life and roll Stones
[1:17:23] away remove grave clothes and testify
[1:17:26] and testify and testify it's going to
[1:17:28] create a big problem in the religious
[1:17:30] world and I I I'm Duty bound to create a
[1:17:32] big problem in the religious world not
[1:17:34] because I want a problem in the
[1:17:35] religious world but because I'm here to
[1:17:37] testify that he lives I'm here to
[1:17:39] testify there's resurrection power in
[1:17:41] this message I'm here to testify that
[1:17:43] Christ is here the voice of the
[1:17:44] Resurrection is here and he's calling to
[1:17:47] individuals that are in grav and I'm
[1:17:49] here to roll away as many stones as I
[1:17:51] can roll away by proclaiming claiming
[1:17:53] the
[1:17:54] truth so somebody can hear his
[1:17:57] voice
[1:18:00] amen Jesus told his disciples when he
[1:18:03] was praying over them in John 4 17 he's
[1:18:05] saying God I don't pray for them
[1:18:07] alone but for them also which Shall
[1:18:10] Believe on believe on me through their
[1:18:14] word amen how are they believing after
[1:18:17] Jesus left through their word how are
[1:18:19] they believing now through your word you
[1:18:23] who've been resurrected you who've come
[1:18:25] out of dark denominationalism you who've
[1:18:27] had the grave clothes taken off of you
[1:18:29] amen you're a testimony amen and many
[1:18:32] will believe amen not just because of
[1:18:34] Jesus but they believe now because of
[1:18:37] Lazarus am let's go to John chapter
[1:18:51] 7 John chapter 7:
[1:18:55] 37 listen just is just set the stage
[1:18:58] because it's so beautiful we've talked
[1:19:00] about it before but I can't not talk
[1:19:01] about it here we are at the Feast of
[1:19:05] Tabernacles what is the Feast of
[1:19:06] Tabernacles it's the seventh feast and
[1:19:09] brother brandham said we're feasting now
[1:19:11] under the Feast of Tabernacles the
[1:19:12] seventh Church age says in future home
[1:19:16] so now we're feasting under the Feast of
[1:19:19] trumpets or I'm sorry Feast of
[1:19:21] Tabernacles the seventh feast and Jesus
[1:19:23] is now he's coming to the feast listen
[1:19:26] his Brethren said why don't you go up
[1:19:28] into the feast and declare yourself
[1:19:29] because nobody declares himself a
[1:19:31] prophet and stays at home go declare
[1:19:32] yourself and he says it's not my time to
[1:19:34] go to the feast
[1:19:37] yet I love the language of the Bible
[1:19:39] it's so perfect it's not my time to go
[1:19:41] to the feast but then the Bible says
[1:19:44] that he came to the feast in the midst
[1:19:47] of the feast he comes somewhere in the
[1:19:48] middle of the seventh Church
[1:19:51] age not at the beginning in 1906 but
[1:19:54] somewhere in the middle he comes along
[1:19:56] and he says he did so secretly amen he
[1:20:00] secretly comes into the seventh feast in
[1:20:02] the midst of the feast he comes secretly
[1:20:05] into the seventh feast and he begins to
[1:20:07] teach and they don't know who he is and
[1:20:09] they start to question say who is this
[1:20:11] and what is he saying and is this the
[1:20:13] Christ is this the one that they're
[1:20:14] looking for and there's a big confusion
[1:20:17] over him why because he came secretly in
[1:20:19] the midst of the seventh Feast this
[1:20:21] message Christ came sec secretly in the
[1:20:23] midst of the seventh Church
[1:20:27] age then it says verse 37 and the last
[1:20:33] day the great day of the feast what is
[1:20:37] the great day of the seventh Feast this
[1:20:39] is one of those special feasts that have
[1:20:41] two
[1:20:42] sabbaths this is a special Feast that
[1:20:45] doesn't just go seven days this Feast
[1:20:47] goes eight
[1:20:48] days amen the beginning of the feast is
[1:20:51] a sacred Sabbath amen and the beginning
[1:20:54] of this seventh Feast was the sacred
[1:20:55] Sabbath of the day of
[1:20:57] Pentecost and then you have a week you
[1:21:00] have seven days amen but at the end of
[1:21:02] seven days you go to the eighth
[1:21:05] day and this is what it talks about in
[1:21:07] Leviticus 23 and on the eighth day now
[1:21:10] there's a holy convocation now there's
[1:21:12] another sacred Sabbath amen and brother
[1:21:14] Brenham says eth is not another number
[1:21:17] he says 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 is completion
[1:21:20] eight is a new day eight is eternity
[1:21:22] eight is back to the beginning and what
[1:21:24] happens in this great day of the seventh
[1:21:26] Feast amen this bride goes back to the
[1:21:28] Virgin she was at Pentecost it's a it's
[1:21:31] a return back to the
[1:21:34] beginning and here he is in the great
[1:21:37] day the last day the great day of the
[1:21:41] feast Jesus stood up and cried oh my
[1:21:44] goodness have you heard his voice in the
[1:21:46] great day of the seventh Fai have you
[1:21:48] heard it amen in the eighth day amen he
[1:21:50] says if you heard this amen you you've
[1:21:52] broke into the eternity you've come into
[1:21:54] the Eighth Day your soul is
[1:21:57] raptured in the last day the great day
[1:21:59] of the feast Jesus stood up and cried
[1:22:01] saying if any man thirst let him come to
[1:22:04] me and
[1:22:05] drink he that believeth on me as the
[1:22:07] scripture has said out of his belly
[1:22:10] shall flow rivers of Living Water but
[1:22:12] this spake he of the spirit which they
[1:22:15] that believe on him should receive for
[1:22:16] the Holy Ghost was not given because
[1:22:18] that Jesus was not yet glorified so what
[1:22:21] is Jesus saying he laying down a
[1:22:23] prophecy he's showing that if any man
[1:22:25] come unto me and drink out of his
[1:22:28] belly shall be what flow rivers of
[1:22:32] Living
[1:22:34] Water listen when we look at the the
[1:22:36] great baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:22:39] spirit of God coming and moving into man
[1:22:42] we always look at it at the beginning as
[1:22:45] receiving receive ye the Holy Ghost he
[1:22:48] spoke of the Holy Ghost which they
[1:22:49] should receive for he had not yet been
[1:22:51] glorified but but when Jesus describes
[1:22:53] this holy ghost He describes it as a
[1:22:56] River of Life flowing out from your
[1:22:58] belly not receiving but flowing amen you
[1:23:02] have to receive it so it can flow but
[1:23:04] the purpose was for it to flow rivers of
[1:23:07] living water coming out of your bellies
[1:23:09] you're the one now amen to give life
[1:23:11] you're the one dispersing truth you're
[1:23:13] the one shedding the light amen this
[1:23:15] Holy Ghost is not just for you to
[1:23:17] receive you receive but this Holy Ghost
[1:23:19] is to flow through you now you drink and
[1:23:22] then you become a well amen this is what
[1:23:25] happened to the woman at the well the
[1:23:27] woman at the well in John chapter 4 she
[1:23:29] comes to the well carrying her little
[1:23:31] pot the same well she's come to all of
[1:23:33] her life and she tells Jesus didn't
[1:23:35] Jacob our father dig this well she's
[1:23:37] going back to the traditions of the
[1:23:39] father she's going back to where her
[1:23:41] ancestors had dipped for water for Life
[1:23:44] to Live amen but that water in that
[1:23:46] little vessel never changed her life cuz
[1:23:49] now she's stuck in a cycle of adultery
[1:23:51] that she doesn't have the power power to
[1:23:52] break and the water in this well is not
[1:23:54] breaking that amen
[1:23:58] right going back to the tradition of the
[1:24:00] father going back to the same old well
[1:24:02] and dipping her pot in the same old well
[1:24:05] again and again but one day when she
[1:24:07] goes back to that same well there's
[1:24:09] another man another vessel sitting on
[1:24:11] the well and that man sitting on the
[1:24:13] well says hey if you would ask me for a
[1:24:15] drink I would give you Waters that you
[1:24:17] thirst no more and neither come back
[1:24:18] here to draw and she says give me those
[1:24:21] and then she says hey where are you
[1:24:23] going to get it from the well is deep
[1:24:24] and you have nothing to draw she didn't
[1:24:26] realize that sitting on the well was a
[1:24:29] [Applause]
[1:24:30] well that she could drink
[1:24:33] from and what was in him was living
[1:24:36] water amen the word Living Water of
[1:24:41] Life and Jesus told her if you drink of
[1:24:45] this
[1:24:46] well it'll be inside of you a Fountain
[1:24:50] of Living Water springing up the
[1:24:54] amen a fountain
[1:24:57] friends it's not a stagnant pool it's
[1:25:00] not something that drops in and
[1:25:01] disappears but if you drink of this this
[1:25:04] Same Spirit will start flowing out of
[1:25:06] you
[1:25:10] amen Lazarus was resurrected for a
[1:25:13] purpose for the glory of God so that the
[1:25:16] son of man can be glorified
[1:25:19] thereby Jesus told his disciples you
[1:25:22] wait in Jerusalem until you be endued
[1:25:24] with power from on high and then you
[1:25:27] shall be my
[1:25:29] Witnesses when you drink of this water
[1:25:32] it'll be in your belly a water a living
[1:25:34] Water of Life flowing
[1:25:37] out and they Spilled Out of the upper
[1:25:39] room and they started gushing water
[1:25:43] everywhere it wasn't I received I
[1:25:45] received I received yeah they received
[1:25:46] but what do you do after you Reed then
[1:25:47] you give and you give and amen amen
[1:25:52] let's go to John chapter 4 and just read
[1:25:54] the end of this story with this woman at
[1:25:56] the
[1:25:57] well we know that the woman at the well
[1:26:00] she wasn't a
[1:26:02] heathen she was a Samaritan there was
[1:26:05] questions locked deep inside of her
[1:26:06] heart and as she's going to this well
[1:26:08] amen an outcast from society separated
[1:26:11] from the norm because of her adultery
[1:26:13] amen she has a question in her heart and
[1:26:15] as soon as Jesus discerns her life she
[1:26:18] says I perceive you're a prophet and
[1:26:19] when she perceives he's a prophet she's
[1:26:21] got a question for that prophet and that
[1:26:22] question isn't what's my future hold and
[1:26:25] how's everything no the question is
[1:26:27] we've been
[1:26:29] told that we have to worship this way
[1:26:31] the Jews say you have to wor the
[1:26:33] Catholics say this and the Baptists say
[1:26:34] this and I'm in the Pentecostal church
[1:26:36] but my Baptist friend says sh what's her
[1:26:38] question her question is how do I
[1:26:40] worship God what's the proper way to
[1:26:42] worship God what does God want in My
[1:26:44] Worship I'm confused by all of these
[1:26:48] Traditions amen she wasn't she wasn't a
[1:26:51] heathen she wasn't a ranked sinner she
[1:26:53] was trapped in a life of adultery had
[1:26:56] five husbands the one she's with now is
[1:26:57] not her own the religion that she is has
[1:26:59] no power to break it but she's got a
[1:27:01] desire in her heart to worship God the
[1:27:04] right
[1:27:05] way but she has never heard the right
[1:27:08] way yet but now she comes to the well
[1:27:10] she meets the
[1:27:13] well then she drinks from the
[1:27:17] well because she says he says woman let
[1:27:20] me tell you something we know what we
[1:27:23] worship you don't know but neither in
[1:27:24] Jerusalem in this mountain shall you
[1:27:25] worship God but the day coming and now
[1:27:28] is I love that phrase now for me that's
[1:27:31] present tense truth now
[1:27:34] is that the father seeketh such to
[1:27:37] worship Him in spirit and in
[1:27:41] truth and she says when Messiah
[1:27:45] comes he'll teach us these
[1:27:48] things she wasn't a zealot looking for a
[1:27:51] a king and a a a general to drive out
[1:27:55] the
[1:27:56] Romans she was looking for somebody to
[1:27:59] teach her the way to God Amen the proper
[1:28:02] way to worship and what God wants and
[1:28:04] how to please the Lord what did she want
[1:28:06] the Messiah she wanted the Messiah for
[1:28:08] the right reasons there was others who
[1:28:10] wanted the Messiah because they hated
[1:28:11] the Romans amen she didn't hate the
[1:28:13] Romans she wanted God Amen so when
[1:28:16] Messiah comes he'll teach us these
[1:28:18] things and he said I that speaketh unto
[1:28:20] thee am he he didn't go around telling
[1:28:22] anybody who he was they said tell us
[1:28:24] plainly are you the Christ said I've
[1:28:25] told you before you didn't believe me
[1:28:26] why would you believe me now they said
[1:28:28] who are you and he wouldn't answer their
[1:28:30] questions he said if you answer mine
[1:28:31] I'll answer yours and then they were
[1:28:32] afraid to answer his so he didn't answer
[1:28:34] he said neither will I answer you theirs
[1:28:36] but here comes a little woman why
[1:28:38] brother Braham said there was a
[1:28:39] predestinated seed down there in Samaria
[1:28:41] that he needed to go to amen that's why
[1:28:43] she hungered to worship God that's why
[1:28:45] she wanted to know the proper way to
[1:28:47] worship that's what was driving her all
[1:28:49] along and here she comes and he says
[1:28:51] Messiah was teaches these things and
[1:28:53] what does he do he becomes the voice of
[1:28:55] the resurrection and he gives her a
[1:28:57] personal revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:29:00] her
[1:29:02] individually I that speaketh unto you am
[1:29:08] he she drank from that well she received
[1:29:12] that
[1:29:16] word let's look at verse
[1:29:19] 27 and upon this came his disciples and
[1:29:22] marveled that he talked with the woman
[1:29:26] yet no man said what seekest thou or why
[1:29:28] talkest thou with her the woman then
[1:29:31] left her water pot this is one of my
[1:29:34] favorite parts of the
[1:29:38] scriptures the woman then left her water
[1:29:41] pot why did she leave her water pot she
[1:29:43] didn't need it no
[1:29:45] more because he said if you drink of the
[1:29:48] water that I'll give you it'll be in you
[1:29:50] water springing up into ever ever
[1:29:52] lasting life and the scripture says she
[1:29:54] left her water pot her Traditions her
[1:29:57] attempt at religion her trying to follow
[1:29:59] the tra she left that water pot she
[1:30:01] didn't need that water pot
[1:30:03] anymore and the woman left her water pot
[1:30:06] and went her way into the City and saith
[1:30:08] unto men saith to the men come see a man
[1:30:11] which told me all things that ever I did
[1:30:14] is not this the Christ then they went
[1:30:17] out of the city and came unto him my
[1:30:21] goodness listen this woman was just
[1:30:23] barely making it she was living uh uh
[1:30:25] spiritually crippled amen but there's a
[1:30:27] desire in her heart she came to an old
[1:30:29] traditional well when she came to the
[1:30:31] traditional well she met the Living Well
[1:30:34] when she drank from the living well she
[1:30:36] dropped the pot she ran into the city
[1:30:38] now she was the
[1:30:40] well because in her was Water of Life
[1:30:43] springing up into everlasting life now
[1:30:45] she goes into the City and she starts to
[1:30:47] declare the truth of the word amen
[1:30:49] there's a man told me everything is this
[1:30:51] not this the C Christ this is the one
[1:30:52] we've been looking for and this is a
[1:30:54] woman with a bad reputation this is a
[1:30:56] woman who cannot go to the well with the
[1:30:58] other women she has to go alone because
[1:31:00] she's an outcast in society she comes
[1:31:02] down into the city now she's got water
[1:31:05] of living Living Water of eternal life
[1:31:07] springing up inside of her she's now an
[1:31:10] artisian well as the prophet would say
[1:31:12] and she runs into this city this Outcast
[1:31:15] of society and says come see a man who
[1:31:17] told me everything that I ever did is
[1:31:19] not this the Christ and then
[1:31:22] they followed
[1:31:27] her they followed her why because she
[1:31:30] was leading them in the way of life she
[1:31:33] had the Water of Life she had come in
[1:31:35] contact with life she had drunk from The
[1:31:37] Well of life and now she was a fountain
[1:31:39] of
[1:31:41] water verse
[1:31:44] 39 says and many of the Samaritans of
[1:31:46] the city believed on him for the saying
[1:31:49] of the woman which testified he told me
[1:31:51] all I ever did so when the Samaritans
[1:31:53] were come unto him they besought him
[1:31:55] that he would t with them and he Abode
[1:31:57] there two days and many more believed
[1:32:00] because of his own word and said unto
[1:32:03] the woman now we believe not because of
[1:32:06] thy saying for we have heard him
[1:32:07] ourselves and know that this is indeed
[1:32:09] the Christ the savior of the
[1:32:13] world I think she rolled the stone
[1:32:16] away so that they could hear for
[1:32:19] themselves they believed because of her
[1:32:23] they believed her testimony they
[1:32:24] believed because they saw a change in
[1:32:25] her they believed because something had
[1:32:27] transformed her life they believe
[1:32:29] because Lazarus was dead but now he's
[1:32:31] alive but when they come amen it's not
[1:32:33] just for Lazarus but they're coming in
[1:32:35] contact with Christ now they're not
[1:32:37] coming toward the woman the woman's
[1:32:38] leading them back to the source of
[1:32:42] life and then they say we don't just
[1:32:45] believe now just because of what you
[1:32:46] said but now we believe because we've
[1:32:48] heard him
[1:32:50] ourselves
[1:32:52] what are we here to do we're here to let
[1:32:54] the water out friends be a well amen if
[1:32:57] anybody drinks lead them back to the
[1:32:59] source so that they can drink and become
[1:33:01] a well amen this is our life this is why
[1:33:06] we're here amen what is our role in the
[1:33:09] resurrection to
[1:33:11] drink become a Fountain of Life to roll
[1:33:15] the stone away off these denominational
[1:33:17] Graves so that they can hear the voice
[1:33:19] of the
[1:33:20] Resurrection amen what is the voice of
[1:33:23] the Bride speaking in the end time
[1:33:25] Revelation chap 17 the spirit I'm sorry
[1:33:28] 22:17 the spirit and the bride say
[1:33:33] come what do they say come to come to
[1:33:37] our church come to our
[1:33:39] denomination they say come and drink of
[1:33:43] the Water of Life
[1:33:47] freely we' discussed this before but
[1:33:50] when you tell somebody to come it's
[1:33:52] different than saying
[1:33:56] go so if I tell you go there I'm not
[1:34:01] there but if you go there you can find
[1:34:04] life but if I've already come to the
[1:34:07] River of Life if I already drunk from
[1:34:10] the Fountain of Life if I've already
[1:34:11] connected with the stream of Life coming
[1:34:13] from the Throne of God I'm now standing
[1:34:16] in
[1:34:17] life in the Water of Life by the River
[1:34:20] of Life and calling out
[1:34:23] come come brother brandom said the
[1:34:26] prophet amen the the prophet and the
[1:34:28] spirit and the bride they'll all be
[1:34:30] speaking the same thing and what they'll
[1:34:32] be speaking will have already been said
[1:34:33] in the word come out from among her my
[1:34:35] people and be ye separate what are we
[1:34:37] doing calling out of the graves calling
[1:34:40] out of denominationalism Rolling Stones
[1:34:42] away letting people hear the voice of
[1:34:43] the resurrection and then come where
[1:34:45] come and drink of the Water of Life
[1:34:48] freely so that you can become a well of
[1:34:51] living Living Water springing up into
[1:34:53] eternal life so that you can go back to
[1:34:56] your village to your town to your
[1:34:58] workplace to wherever you are and spray
[1:35:00] out the water of life this is our role
[1:35:03] in the
[1:35:04] resurrection and then when they come out
[1:35:06] of the graves amen Jesus said loose
[1:35:10] them loose them this is why we have
[1:35:14] Fellowship this is why we have Bible
[1:35:15] studies this is why we get together this
[1:35:17] is why we have Services amen this is why
[1:35:20] we constantly come back why so that we
[1:35:21] can be loosed from the grave clothes so
[1:35:24] we can be set free so that we can help
[1:35:26] one
[1:35:27] another you roll the stone away you
[1:35:31] loose them from the grave clothes I say
[1:35:34] God help me I don't know how in myself I
[1:35:37] can't tell you I can't do a 10-part
[1:35:40] class on removing grave clothes let's
[1:35:42] all get together in the fellowship hall
[1:35:44] now we're going to go through all the
[1:35:45] tools and all the instruments and
[1:35:46] there's a 10-step program to removing
[1:35:48] grap clothes we don't know how to do it
[1:35:50] we don't have the intelligence to do it
[1:35:52] but what we have to do is drink of the
[1:35:53] Water of Life and become a Fountain of
[1:35:55] Life and say God I'm here use me God I
[1:35:58] don't know the answer I don't know how
[1:35:59] to do it I don't know how to roll a
[1:36:00] stone away Amen brother B said he could
[1:36:03] have dissolved that stone but he asked
[1:36:04] those two little
[1:36:06] women I don't know how they did it I
[1:36:08] don't know if they got help I don't know
[1:36:09] if they used levers I don't know if you
[1:36:10] used crowbar I don't know what they did
[1:36:12] but he used those two women somehow they
[1:36:14] had to catch some inspiration some way
[1:36:16] to roll that stone away and I feel just
[1:36:18] as inept as those two little women to
[1:36:20] roll the stone away I don't know what to
[1:36:22] do all I know to do is proclaim the
[1:36:24] truth share the truth go as I'm inspired
[1:36:26] to go witness and testify and say God
[1:36:29] give me the strength and wisdom to roll
[1:36:31] Stones off of
[1:36:33] Graves and then when I see my brothers
[1:36:35] come to life God equip me use me uh
[1:36:39] inspire me to remove their grave clothes
[1:36:42] I don't know how to do it amen and I
[1:36:44] don't have a textbook on it and I'm not
[1:36:45] about to write a textbook on it I'm just
[1:36:47] here to say that's our job amen and if
[1:36:50] he's given it to us do he's got to give
[1:36:52] the inspiration behind it to get it done
[1:36:54] we're dependent on him Lazarus was one
[1:36:56] whom God helped I believe after the
[1:36:58] resurrection he was still helping
[1:37:01] Lazarus how many people came to Lazarus
[1:37:05] and said I want to hear the story
[1:37:08] again how many of you have been asked to
[1:37:10] share your
[1:37:11] testimony how many you been asked more
[1:37:13] than once hey man you know why some
[1:37:16] people are gathering around and saying
[1:37:17] Lazarus tell me again I want to hear it
[1:37:20] again it's such a tremendous story it's
[1:37:22] so marvelous it encourages me so much oh
[1:37:25] man it makes the gospel so real to me
[1:37:27] amen it makes the message come alive
[1:37:29] amen would you tell me Lazarus tell me
[1:37:32] again how many times had Lazarus had
[1:37:35] people sit around his table how many
[1:37:37] times did Martha make another batch of
[1:37:43] tea what did Lazarus do he testified to
[1:37:47] the glory of
[1:37:48] God and his testimony was so the son of
[1:37:51] man could be
[1:37:53] glorified why did God save you that's
[1:37:57] why did he pull you out of a tomb why
[1:37:58] did he send somebody your way one day to
[1:38:00] roll a stone off of your grave why did
[1:38:03] you get a book why did you get a tape
[1:38:05] why when others heard noise You Heard a
[1:38:09] Voice why is it when others heard a man
[1:38:11] from Kentucky in the 50s and 60s
[1:38:14] preaching you heard Jesus Christ calling
[1:38:16] your
[1:38:18] name cuz the spirit saith to him that
[1:38:21] has ears let him
[1:38:23] hear amen why did God fill you with the
[1:38:26] Holy Ghost so you could say I come out
[1:38:28] of the
[1:38:30] Grave My Grave clothes have been removed
[1:38:32] and I now receive no he did it so you
[1:38:34] could be like that little woman who run

[1:41:07] truth of the promise of the word in her
[1:41:10] alone they don't have the answer when
[1:41:12] Jesus come why didn't those Pharisees he
[1:41:14] said if I cast out Devils by the Finger
[1:41:16] of God who do you cast them out by see
[1:41:18] he stood alone in his church stands
[1:41:21] alone she's not hooked with nothing but
[1:41:23] he was identified by God being the body
[1:41:25] that God dwelt in and the church is
[1:41:28] identified by his body doing the same
[1:41:30] thing she is his body and the manifested
[1:41:33] truth of his promised word for the last
[1:41:36] days and she and she alone stands by him
[1:41:40] that's why the devil is howling these
[1:41:42] great organizations to set up something
[1:41:44] to close her up they'll never do it
[1:41:46] she'll be taken up not closed up she is
[1:41:49] now

[1:42:07] taken
[1:42:08] up I don't think they ever shut Lazarus
[1:42:11] up I don't think they ever shut that
[1:42:13] little woman that was at the well that
[1:42:15] little Samar I don't think they could
[1:42:16] ever shut her up and I don't want them
[1:42:17] ever to shut me
[1:42:19] up
[1:42:21] CU there was a man who told me
[1:42:23] everything that I've ever done and
[1:42:24] explained to me all the confusion in my
[1:42:27] life I listened to anointed ones at the
[1:42:29] end time and absolutely unraveled the
[1:42:31] mystery of my childhood growing up in
[1:42:33] the Pentecostal
[1:42:34] Church what was that that was Christ
[1:42:38] that man from Kentucky didn't know those
[1:42:39] things they were revealed by Christ they
[1:42:41] were sent down for us through a prophet
[1:42:44] but they were sent to us to unravel the
[1:42:46] mystery amen and I can say come see a
[1:42:48] man who told me everything that I've
[1:42:50] ever done and all that I've ever been
[1:42:51] through and all the confusion I've been
[1:42:52] in and who called me by his voice out of
[1:42:55] the
[1:42:56] grave and who sent his servants to me to
[1:42:58] unwrap the grave clothes from around me
[1:43:00] come and see that
[1:43:02] manen come and taste and see that the
[1:43:05] Lord is
[1:43:08] good Jesus says to his disciples in
[1:43:10] Matthew 10 verse 40 he that believeth
[1:43:14] you that he that receiveth you receiveth
[1:43:16] me amen and he that receiveth me
[1:43:19] receiveth him that sent
[1:43:21] me amen you're the tool in his
[1:43:25] hand this Resurrection is for a reason
[1:43:28] and we're here for a reason so God help
[1:43:32] me I don't
[1:43:34] know you know sometimes I I tell you
[1:43:37] friends when I travel sometimes I sit in
[1:43:39] an airport I'll sit in an international
[1:43:41] airport somewhere Atlanta or sometimes
[1:43:44] in Paris or sometimes in uh Amsterdam
[1:43:48] huge airports and planes you watch the
[1:43:50] board planes coming from everywhere
[1:43:52] around the world Landing every few
[1:43:55] minutes they're coming from Asia they're
[1:43:56] coming from Africa they're coming from
[1:43:58] America they're coming from Mexico
[1:43:59] they're coming all over and you see
[1:44:01] people passing through the corridors as
[1:44:03] they go from one plane to the next as
[1:44:04] they travel and when I'm in those
[1:44:07] airports sometimes I'm absolutely
[1:44:09] overwhelmed by the abundance of people
[1:44:11] and how few the bride
[1:44:13] is and sometimes I sit there and I watch
[1:44:16] the people crisscross the corridors
[1:44:18] coming to and fro over the Earth and I
[1:44:20] said God God how will it's like a needle
[1:44:23] in a hay stack how do you find the seed
[1:44:25] of God in this and that airport is just
[1:44:28] a small representation of the whole
[1:44:31] world God how and sometimes I'm
[1:44:34] absolutely overwhelmed if it was my
[1:44:36] effort I would fail there's no possible
[1:44:38] way but I thank God he knew how to find
[1:44:40] me the needle in the Hy stack he knew
[1:44:43] how to find you amen and we've come from
[1:44:45] all kinds of different places we've come
[1:44:47] out of all kinds of different churches
[1:44:48] in all kinds of different situations and
[1:44:50] and he knew how to come to that one and
[1:44:52] he knew where that one was he knew where
[1:44:54] the woman at the well was and when she
[1:44:56] would come for water he knew how to bump
[1:44:58] into you he knew where your grave was
[1:45:00] and he knew what your name
[1:45:03] was how does he do it I don't know can I
[1:45:06] do it absolutely not but I'm the
[1:45:08] instrument in his hand and I say God if
[1:45:11] you need somebody to roll a stone away
[1:45:13] I'm giving you these two hands I'm
[1:45:14] giving you this mouth I'm giving you
[1:45:16] this body I don't know where it is and I
[1:45:18] don't know how to do it but God if
[1:45:19] you'll equip me I will give all my heart
[1:45:22] to roll the stone away I will help my
[1:45:24] brother get unwrapped from his grave
[1:45:25] clothes but God you've got to come and
[1:45:27] help
[1:45:29] me and I want there to be lazarus' all
[1:45:32] over the
[1:45:33] world where people will come and they'll
[1:45:37] believe because of Lazarus testimony and
[1:45:40] then they'll meet Christ I want all
[1:45:43] kinds of woman that the well that'll
[1:45:45] drink from the fountain and go and tell
[1:45:47] others come see a man amen and they'll
[1:45:50] say now we believe not just because of
[1:45:52] your word but because we've heard him
[1:45:56] ourself what's our role in the
[1:45:57] resurrection I think we got a lot of
[1:45:59] work to
[1:46:00] do I think there's a lot of work for us
[1:46:03] to do but I think the spirit of God is
[1:46:06] present to give us the ability to do the
[1:46:08] work and I'm relying on him but I want
[1:46:12] to be
[1:46:13] awake I want to be tuned in and I want
[1:46:16] to be
[1:46:17] available are you with me amen CU this
[1:46:21] is our role in the resurrection let's
[1:46:23] all Stand
[1:46:26] Together amen as we end one year and
[1:46:29] look at the next year listen friends I
[1:46:32] think we got a lot of work cut out for
[1:46:34] us I think there's a lot of people stuck
[1:46:36] behind
[1:46:38] gravestones rocks that are rolled over
[1:46:41] tombes I believe there's a lot of people
[1:46:43] trapped in systems and going back to Old
[1:46:45] Wells trying to find enough water to
[1:46:47] survive for another
[1:46:48] day I believe there's more there there
[1:46:51] may not be the last one may have already
[1:46:52] come in the door may be shut and we're
[1:46:54] we're exiting but I just don't
[1:46:56] know but I believe there's more to come
[1:46:59] in we've seen God draw he draws from
[1:47:02] wherever he wants to draw he pulls
[1:47:04] people in and brings them to the truth I
[1:47:05] say praise be to God the voice of the
[1:47:09] Resurrection is still going
[1:47:11] on and I want to be a partner in the
[1:47:14] Resurrection season amen I don't want to
[1:47:17] be a
[1:47:18] bystander I don't want to be somebody
[1:47:20] who just talks about what I want to be a
[1:47:23] partner of his in the Resurrection
[1:47:25] season if I can do that through sharing
[1:47:27] my testimony if I can do that through a
[1:47:28] witness if I can do that through the
[1:47:30] life that I live however God wants to
[1:47:32] use this vessel I want to be available
[1:47:34] to be used and that's why I want to
[1:47:36] start
[1:47:38] 2024 I know God doesn't count time like
[1:47:40] man counts time God has a different
[1:47:43] calendar alog together but for us these
[1:47:45] are transition times and in transition
[1:47:47] time I want God to be the central focus
[1:47:49] of every
[1:47:50] transition so I don't miss what he wants
[1:47:53] me to
[1:47:54] do time is winding down it's winding to
[1:47:57] the Finish I say God help us finish
[1:48:01] strong help us call out that last

[1:48:18] to us he said I come that you might have
[1:48:20] life and you might have it more
[1:48:23] abundantly whatever life I had before
