[4:20] you all know that one of our sisters has
[4:22] crossed over to the other side this
[4:24] morning our sister Lily Bond trigger
[4:27] passed away early this morning at 98
[4:30] years of age and I I was notified that
[4:35] she passed away and I was also told that
[4:37] she passed away peacefully and without
[4:39] any sign of struggle and apparently in
[4:42] her sleep and I say thank God
[4:45] 98 years old God was good to her she was
[4:48] healthy she had a clear mind all and
[4:51] strength all the way to the end and my
[4:54] wife and I had the opportunity to pop in
[4:56] and see her Saturday at the end of
[4:58] David's graduation party just for a few
[5:00] minutes and the last words I heard
[5:03] sister Lily say was I'm ready to go
[5:07] she wanted to go on she was ready to go
[5:09] on to her reward and I thank God that
[5:12] she has been permitted her request and
[5:14] she's moved on to the sixth Dimension
[5:16] where she's now young and free and
[5:20] joined with loved ones in that beautiful
[5:23] land that brother Branham could not
[5:24] describe with any Earthly words I'm
[5:28] happy for her we just ask that you
[5:30] remember the family especially sister
[5:31] Elsie and her family and and brother
[5:34] John his family she was a mother a
[5:37] grandmother a great grandmother and a
[5:39] great great grandmother to many that are
[5:41] in the assembly so and many in the area
[5:43] so just remember the family they're
[5:46] happy for her that her days of toil are
[5:48] over and that she was permitted to pass
[5:50] so peacefully but also they're grieving
[5:52] the loss of one they love so much so
[5:55] remember them they set the arrangements

[23:09] way we know why we are here and we know

[23:19] say they don't understand what the
[23:21] pastor is they don't understand what the
[23:24] home church is also they think it is
[23:27] just a gathering praise the Lord so how

[24:08] want to be a blessing okay praise God
[24:11] now so we we know we are in we are in
[24:15] the end time
[24:17] and I believe myself this is the last
[24:19] generation seeing that we don't need
[24:23] that's why the prophet said we don't
[24:25] need anyone to write
[24:27] our history praise God our history has
[24:31] been written we are just fulfilling what
[24:34] has been written for us
[24:36] praise the Lord say hallelujah and last
[24:40] Sunday I told you we are in the head
[24:43] say we are in the Ice Age
[24:45] say and we are in the mind age say
[24:49] that's why everything that's happening
[24:51] in our surrounding has something to do
[24:54] with your eyes with your ear and with
[24:56] your mind
[24:58] right praise God that's why all this of
[25:01] the the Facebook the tick tock
[25:05] I don't know you know I only have
[25:07] messenger okay I don't know about this
[25:10] praise God say hallelujah
[25:14] what is the purpose of that for you to
[25:17] see for you to hear
[25:20] praise God because they want to control
[25:22] your mind same praise God that's why we
[25:26] have so many conspiracy theories in our
[25:29] time
[25:30] say like uh you know when this pandemic
[25:33] hit uh hit us you know they said brother
[25:37] Leinster we do not want to be vaccinated
[25:40] because that is the mark of the beast I
[25:42] said what where can you find that in the
[25:45] scripture
[25:47] where can you find that in the message
[25:50] say that the vaccine is
[25:53] 666.
[25:55] praise God you know the Mark is on the
[25:58] forehead not not in the shoulder if you
[26:03] will be vaccinated on the forehead maybe
[26:05] I will consider it okay but no right
[26:09] praise God that's why where did you
[26:13] where did you get the teaching
[26:16] in the f b
[26:18] right
[26:20] we have m b
[26:23] see they had the Facebook we have the
[26:27] message book
[26:29] saying praise God because they want to
[26:32] control your mind
[26:33] praise God
[26:35] see
[26:37] just listen everything that's happening
[26:40] today is already been written right
[26:44] praise God when this covet come they
[26:46] don't know the name they don't know what
[26:49] it is that's why they call it novel
[26:51] praise God but they said you know when I
[26:54] studied the the virus only six virus
[26:58] SARS bar
[26:59] um copied virus they have named but this
[27:02] servant they have no name but it comes
[27:04] from the six
[27:06] praise God say it's a hybrid that's why
[27:10] the prophet called it gem germ warfare
[27:13] see
[27:15] how do you know that brother Nestor
[27:17] because he said people will do this they
[27:20] will they will going to have a face mask
[27:23] they use sanitizer they go into the cave
[27:26] they will not go up see and they will go
[27:29] to okay to the hospitals see Dr so and
[27:33] so is that what we did
[27:36] say so it only fulfilled what the
[27:39] prophet said so we know
[27:44] I've been telling it to them don't you
[27:46] worry
[27:47] praise God say don't you worry
[27:51] see
[27:52] because Hallelujah
[27:55] we have a protection
[27:57] you know we have double protection right
[27:59] praise God we have I'm vaccinated all my
[28:03] people got vaccine praise God then my
[28:06] people said is that our protection no
[28:09] that our protection is the Holy Ghost
[28:12] see we are protected by the vaccine one
[28:15] portion and then we also protected by
[28:17] the Holy Ghost another portion always
[28:20] double
[28:22] see praise God hallelujah there was
[28:26] sister told me Pastor they said if I got
[28:28] vaccinated after two years I'm going we
[28:31] are going to die I said
[28:33] praise God
[28:35] can they do it earlier
[28:41] who wants who wants to live in this kind
[28:44] of world right
[28:46] praise God
[28:47] I said where where whoever it is
[28:51] same that's why I told them saying when
[28:55] when when it is still in in the original
[28:58] Hobbit 19 I told them it will mutate
[29:02] because it is hybrid
[29:05] see
[29:06] praise God it will mutate up to the
[29:09] fourth generation but when it comes to
[29:11] the third and fourth generation see the
[29:13] strength will subside
[29:15] see
[29:17] praise God
[29:19] that's you know
[29:21] in the beginning Abraham's blood they
[29:25] can mix with the rare relatives but in
[29:28] the time of Moses you cannot marry your
[29:31] relatives up to the fourth generation
[29:33] because the blood become weak
[29:36] praise God so same thing Hallelujah same
[29:41] I've been telling it to the church you
[29:43] know don't you worry the Delta will come
[29:45] into our country even even if we close
[29:48] our door the almightron also come see
[29:52] when our door is closed I told them
[29:54] because the
[29:56] it's it is not original
[29:59] see that's why your government is trying
[30:01] to find where it come from okay because
[30:04] that virus cannot enter
[30:07] to the human it needs something to pass
[30:10] through okay
[30:12] Alleluia but this conspiration you know
[30:15] that's why I told you just read the
[30:17] message and you will understand what's
[30:18] happening in our surrounding this is
[30:21] just very mild what's happened to us is
[30:23] mild because the prophet said say praise
[30:27] God there is more horrible thing will
[30:30] come
[30:31] he will he will tell to do he will tell
[30:34] to the fall of the air praise God to to
[30:37] eat the Flesh of the people then then he
[30:40] said that is airborne disease
[30:43] while they are standing praise God this
[30:46] this fall of the earth air will eat
[30:50] their flesh and they will not die
[30:53] they want to die they they will not die
[30:56] because Satan
[30:58] uh the Dead
[31:00] he is in quarantine
[31:02] his implications
[31:05] Hallelujah
[31:08] praise God say that's why I've been
[31:11] telling it to the people this is just
[31:13] mild if if these things you know the
[31:16] mild things you are already full of fear
[31:20] then what will the you know the next day
[31:23] this is just you know this uh something
[31:26] like uh Prelude you know to the taste
[31:29] more greater things that will happen see
[31:33] nobody you know when I'm reading the
[31:35] scripture nobody in his right mind
[31:39] um praise God will accept the mark of
[31:41] the beast praise God say
[31:45] that and then they they know they will
[31:47] go to hell once they had the mark right
[31:50] but when these things happen the
[31:52] government now can control the people in
[31:54] our country you cannot buy you cannot
[31:57] sell
[31:58] without
[32:00] that
[32:01] certificate okay
[32:04] Hallelujah
[32:06] see that's how the message is because

[47:10] the foundation of the world hallelujah
[47:13] praise the Lord
[47:14] see now
[47:16] we know it if it's a mother of High
[47:19] breathing praise God say so when the
[47:23] woman fall
[47:24] Adam went into transgression okay he is
[47:28] not in sin Adam believed believe believe
[47:31] the message say but during the time of
[47:34] Adam all the things that they have is
[47:37] the right thing
[47:39] there is no wrong thing
[47:42] say the right thing but then they
[47:46] disobeyed the right thing that's why it
[47:48] was called transgression
[47:51] praise God until when the when when the
[47:54] law come in now they know the right they
[47:56] know the wrong
[47:57] if you know the wrong thing and then you
[47:59] do it
[48:00] if you know the right thing and then you
[48:02] don't do it then we call it iniquity
[48:05] praise God Hallelujah then if we
[48:09] disbelief then we are in sin
[48:12] Hallelujah say so Adam went into
[48:15] transgression Hallelujah
[48:18] see
[48:22] God did not blame the woman
[48:26] okay
[48:29] because God
[48:32] can create another woman
[48:35] see when the woman fell in sin you know
[48:39] Adam can just tell to God God father
[48:44] just pull another ribs so it will be
[48:47] balanced okay create a new woman for me
[48:51] this woman is really stiff naked you
[48:54] know
[48:55] praise God but no he he did not do it he
[49:01] take the responsibility
[49:04] see that's why I'm always telling it to
[49:08] the church you know in a family okay I
[49:12] don't believe in divorce
[49:14] praise God divorce
[49:17] is not of God
[49:19] praise God we don't believe divorce in
[49:21] the message say hallelujah see there is
[49:26] no such thing as divorce in the message
[49:28] praise God hallelujah
[49:31] see
[49:40] every time something happened in the
[49:42] house okay so you brother praise God you
[49:46] better
[49:49] pray and ask yourself okay that's why we
[49:53] live in the young young sister a young
[49:55] boy you know when they have this kind of
[49:57] uh we call it in the Philippines we have
[50:00] what we call the courtship you know here
[50:02] I don't know how they do it praise God
[50:05] see if something went wrong you know the
[50:09] prophet said this okay say once once the
[50:13] boy once once that boy proposes to the
[50:17] sister
[50:19] will you marry me
[50:21] and then the sister answer yes
[50:25] okay potentially
[50:27] potentially I'm not saying they are
[50:29] married potentially they are married
[50:32] praise God hallelujah so it's so hard to
[50:36] break that vow
[50:37] okay Allelujah in all your pastor don't
[50:42] ask me okay if you have some question go
[50:45] to your pastor huh praise God in our
[50:48] place Hallelujah if something happened
[50:51] you know I always I know you know
[50:56] the boy
[50:58] is always the man you know the boy you
[51:01] know praise God say praise God because
[51:05] he is the one that who carried the
[51:08] responsibility okay
[51:10] hallelujah
[51:12] praise the Lord
[51:18] same
[51:20] now when Adam says Adam is the Sid
[51:24] carrier
[51:25] she's not the woman okay praise God
[51:28] that's why all the responsibility is in
[51:31] Adam so when Adam went into
[51:34] transgression
[51:36] all his oldest generation
[51:40] all his children
[51:42] fall into sin
[51:45] praise God
[51:47] say that's why we are Sinner by
[51:52] representation we are condemned
[51:55] we did nothing wrong
[51:58] praise God someone did it
[52:02] not me not you it's Adam it's Adam's
[52:06] fault that's why the scripture said
[52:08] through one man through the name Adam
[52:11] praise God say we are condemned
[52:16] praise God that come in we die because
[52:19] of one man
[52:21] okay
[52:23] praise God
[52:24] Hallelujah
[52:26] say so when when you read the the Book
[52:29] of Genesis when God separated the land
[52:32] and the water praise God say then the
[52:35] vegetation they did the plant appear you
[52:38] know praise God when the plant they they
[52:40] put praise God say one plant here
[52:45] another plant here praise God but every
[52:48] plant they only represented by one name
[52:53] say even how many fruits you have the
[52:56] apple tree you put it in 10 basket full
[52:59] of Apple you call all that you call them
[53:03] all Apple
[53:05] only one name
[53:07] praise God
[53:09] same even the animal
[53:12] Alleluia all lion they only have one
[53:15] name they are represented by one name
[53:18] lion
[53:20] see the elephant is the same
[53:23] praise God hallelujah
[53:26] so same thing with us as a sinner we are
[53:29] represented by one name
[53:31] Adam
[53:33] say
[53:34] praise God hallelujah then God did
[53:37] something to redeem us
[53:40] right
[53:42] Jesus
[53:44] he went to the cross
[53:46] paid the debt that he did he did not own
[53:51] praise God
[53:53] see
[53:54] we did nothing also
[53:57] to be saved
[53:59] praise God by one name again we are
[54:02] represented
[54:04] to be saved
[54:06] saved by representation again
[54:09] Hallelujah
[54:11] so it's so easy right
[54:13] Hallelujah
[54:15] we did nothing we become sinner
[54:18] by representation
[54:21] we are saved we are so we did all we did
[54:23] nothing also
[54:25] by representation
[54:27] okay Hallelujah now
[54:31] we are where we will go in now to our
[54:33] the home Church
[54:37] amen I love the subject but uh praise
[54:42] the Lord
[54:43] so again
[54:46] this is a little bit uh you know
[54:49] sometimes so hard the prophet said when
[54:51] you go on the teaching message is very
[54:54] tricky okay you are you are walking on
[54:57] the thin ice okay I'm glad you have a
[55:01] good pastor here okay so if anything
[55:04] that uh a problem or you have some
[55:08] question you ask it don't ask me
[55:14] that then if the pastor think that's uh
[55:17] praise God hallelujah
[55:19] you know so the the prophet said so we
[55:23] believe the prophet okay praise God
[55:26] hallelujah he says here and now tomorrow
[55:28] is Sunday and there will be Sunday
[55:30] school the churches the reason we have
[55:33] our services in the afternoon on Sunday
[55:36] is so we won't interrupt any service at
[55:39] all
[55:40] even the prophet you know he's I mean
[55:43] his famous is a lot of people follow him
[55:46] but he still respect
[55:49] The Fellowship of the other churches
[55:52] praise God because he said we believe
[55:55] that every Christian
[55:57] ought to have a home church that they go
[56:00] to every Christian ought to meet
[56:03] somewhere with Believers and wherever
[56:05] you meet that's the church
[56:10] the whole purpose of redemption is
[56:13] fellowship
[56:15] then you don't want to Fellowship
[56:18] I don't understand you
[56:22] praise God you know in this pandemic
[56:25] when this uh praise God hit us I'm
[56:28] telling you

[58:09] the you know
[58:11] so how much the rent is very expensive

[58:25] of God they are sending you know their
[58:27] tightings through the the bank account
[58:30] to bank transfer and everything I said I
[58:33] think this is good
[58:36] see
[58:39] but then you know the Bible is not the
[58:42] Bible don't teach at like that
[58:45] we need to come to the church praise God
[58:48] hallelujah
[58:50] say that's why the prophet said you must
[58:52] have we believe that every Christian
[58:55] ought to have a home Church praise God
[58:57] that they go to
[59:00] praise God then it says in the
[59:02] discernment of the spirit a new
[59:04] testament Prophet is a preacher we all
[59:07] know that just any Minister that
[59:10] preaches pre that's a preacher is a
[59:13] prophet a new testament Prophet if we
[59:16] prophesying preaching not to try to
[59:18] edify himself to make a big name or to
[59:21] edifice Organics organization which he
[59:24] should be in our organization here I am
[59:28] without one but yet preaching you should
[59:31] be that's right everyone
[59:34] ought to have a church home
[59:36] you ought to have a place not just to
[59:39] float about from pillar to pause but
[59:42] have somewhere that you go to church and
[59:45] you call it your church someone you pay
[59:48] your tithes and somewhere you help
[59:51] support the cause
[59:53] take your choice
[59:57] take your choice
[59:59] if you think
[1:00:01] in my church okay I I always tell it to
[1:00:05] the people if you are not growing in
[1:00:07] this church is spiritually then find a
[1:00:10] church that you will grow
[1:00:13] praise God
[1:00:15] see because we are talking about your
[1:00:19] soul
[1:00:21] I will die
[1:00:25] and you will die also now the problem if
[1:00:28] he is your soul
[1:00:30] praise God coming to church is not
[1:00:33] because you praise God I I like that
[1:00:36] Pastor
[1:00:37] he looks good Hallelujah
[1:00:42] no
[1:00:44] no see
[1:00:46] praise God
[1:00:48] nothing about
[1:00:50] nothing about emotion okay
[1:00:53] Allelujah you need to make sure you make
[1:00:56] your choice praise God say when you make
[1:01:00] your choice
[1:01:01] then he says then don't never
[1:01:03] disfellowship the other man because you
[1:01:06] don't belong with your group see
[1:01:10] but then discern his spirit and see and
[1:01:14] see if he's got the same purpose in
[1:01:16] heart then you got Fellowship one with
[1:01:19] another you are working for one great
[1:01:23] great cause that's the cause of Christ
[1:01:27] see
[1:01:30] you need to have a home Church
[1:01:35] you know we call it home Church like the
[1:01:37] prophet said you know when if I am in my
[1:01:41] home church or church home he said I
[1:01:44] feel I feel free it is like uh when you
[1:01:47] go home then you you you pull off your
[1:01:50] tie something like that when I'm in my
[1:01:53] church home praise God I can do that I
[1:01:55] can say what I want I'm free
[1:01:58] I'm relaxed
[1:02:00] see
[1:02:02] it's your home spiritual home
[1:02:05] your church your home church is a
[1:02:08] spiritual home
[1:02:10] the pastor praise God it is like
[1:02:14] husband and wife

[1:02:18] congregation is is the wife is
[1:02:21] spiritually speaking okay

[1:02:34] that's why this is our spiritual family
[1:02:38] in our church I become their spiritual
[1:02:41] father and they all are my children
[1:02:46] see
[1:02:48] that's why in the book of Ephesians Paul
[1:02:51] said
[1:02:52] respect
[1:02:54] your parents in the Lord
[1:02:56] see
[1:02:58] and who is your parents in the Lord
[1:03:02] Hallelujah
[1:03:04] say praise God
[1:03:07] that's why the prophet said now he says
[1:03:09] here thirsting for life that's why I
[1:03:11] think about sometime God's Little Deer
[1:03:14] sometimes wander off from the fold
[1:03:17] there might be some here tonight that's
[1:03:20] wander away from the protection of the
[1:03:23] church so the church is our protection
[1:03:27] praise God
[1:03:28] see
[1:03:30] and protection of the love loved ones
[1:03:32] who prayed for you and help you to come
[1:03:35] back to God keep you straight come to
[1:03:38] the church and listen at the gospel

[1:03:47] Wi-Fi that's wandered away
[1:03:50] okay

[1:04:00] assembling of ourselves together
[1:04:03] as the manner as the manner of Psalm is
[1:04:07] but exhorting one another
[1:04:09] is so much the more as she see the day

[1:04:16] in the end time

[1:04:41] going to hold we are going to rent a big
[1:04:43] hole and then we are going to have our
[1:04:46] face-to-face meeting but God God

[1:04:52] that is not the way

[1:07:29] the word of the Prophet you can
[1:07:33] the Bible said that forsake our assemble
[1:07:36] ourselves together
[1:07:37] and that's much more as we see the time

[1:07:44] if you are a Christian okay
[1:07:47] you long to go over other Christians are
[1:07:50] and fellowship with other Christians
[1:07:55] so you cannot stay away from church and
[1:07:58] live the same life you can do it
[1:08:04] see

[1:09:09] ought to have a home Church
[1:09:12] find it
[1:09:13] praise God hallelujah say discern
[1:09:18] praise God you need to discern the
[1:09:20] pastor that preaching in that church
[1:09:22] praise God hallelujah if you think that
[1:09:26] he is a servant of God then you better
[1:09:28] respect him
[1:09:30] okay praise God
[1:09:32] Hallelujah
[1:09:34] see now I'm going to the pastor
[1:09:38] just hold your seat
[1:09:43] in Hebrew 13 17 it says obey them that
[1:09:48] have the rule over you and submit
[1:09:50] yourselves for they watch
[1:09:54] for they watch for your souls
[1:10:00] as they that must give
[1:10:03] account
[1:10:04] they will watch your soul and they are
[1:10:07] the one who will give account
[1:10:10] to your soul
[1:10:14] that they may do it with joy and not
[1:10:16] with grief
[1:10:17] for that is unprofitable for you
[1:10:22] praise God
[1:10:24] Hallelujah
[1:10:28] that's why Paul said in 37 remember them
[1:10:31] which have the rule over you who have
[1:10:34] spoken unto you the word of God whose
[1:10:36] Faith follow considering the end of
[1:10:38] their conversation
[1:10:40] see now
[1:10:43] the prophet said you never you cannot
[1:10:45] live higher
[1:10:48] than your pastor
[1:10:50] say now
[1:10:51] the hidden manna a little special a
[1:10:56] little something special what is this
[1:10:59] special not something too the blessing
[1:11:02] of the Holy Ghost oh no
[1:11:04] that's for the whole congregation
[1:11:07] but the hidden manner was a special
[1:11:10] Revelation because he had to teach the
[1:11:13] others say praise God
[1:11:17] the the only one that can break the
[1:11:21] hidden manner
[1:11:24] praise God none other than the pastor
[1:11:29] even if you read the message book
[1:11:35] back to back
[1:11:38] see
[1:11:41] that's why the prophet said this see but
[1:11:44] the hidden manner was a special
[1:11:46] Revelation because he had to teach the
[1:11:48] others see was a little more more
[1:11:52] knowledge of the scripture that he could
[1:11:54] teach others he's supposed to be is that
[1:11:58] right
[1:11:59] you'll never live no higher than your
[1:12:02] pastor
[1:12:03] you cannot have more Revelation than
[1:12:06] your pastor
[1:12:07] if you have more Revelation that's why
[1:12:10] in our church I've been telling it to
[1:12:12] the people if your Revelation in my
[1:12:14] Revelation is not the same I am not your
[1:12:17] pastor
[1:12:19] that's right
[1:12:20] see
[1:12:22] the anointing during the time of the
[1:12:25] high priest of Aeron it will hit the
[1:12:27] head
[1:12:28] first then it will go down
[1:12:31] to the body
[1:12:34] spiritually speaking this is the head
[1:12:37] and this is the body
[1:12:40] praise God
[1:12:42] Hallelujah
[1:12:44] say
[1:12:52] you'll never live no higher than your
[1:12:54] pastor you just remembered that see so
[1:12:57] because he's the Shepherd that feeds you
[1:13:00] if he is the shepherd he's got to know
[1:13:03] where the Mana is
[1:13:05] to feed the sheep is that right
[1:13:09] now a little special
[1:13:11] and watch this just a minute the
[1:13:15] Revelation the hidden Mana
[1:13:18] praise God
[1:13:20] like I told you last Sunday
[1:13:24] say this message is different
[1:13:27] we are in a different season we are not
[1:13:30] in the planting season we are not in the
[1:13:33] growing season we are not in the just in
[1:13:37] the you know in maturing season we are
[1:13:39] in the ripening see you soon
[1:13:42] no more growth
[1:13:45] praise God
[1:13:46] see like with the wheat
[1:13:49] Hallelujah
[1:13:53] it will just it will just stop growing
[1:13:57] it only need to receive
[1:13:59] light
[1:14:01] stronger light is stronger light
[1:14:05] praise God
[1:14:07] the seed cannot be ripened
[1:14:12] be the light of justification
[1:14:16] with the light of the sanctification
[1:14:18] okay again
[1:14:21] I don't want you to biscote it misquote
[1:14:23] me see we still need it okay but what
[1:14:27] I'm trying to tell you
[1:14:29] the moonlight
[1:14:31] cannot Harden
[1:14:34] cannot ripen the sin
[1:14:37] we need a very strong light praise God
[1:14:40] that's why the prophet said when the sun
[1:14:43] appeared we don't need the Moon
[1:14:47] Hallelujah
[1:14:53] we are not eating the Heavenly manner we
[1:14:56] are not eating the unleavened bread we
[1:15:00] are eating
[1:15:01] he did Mana
[1:15:05] praise God
[1:15:07] Hallelujah
[1:15:09] that's why the bride cannot rejoice
[1:15:13] with the Heavenly Mana
[1:15:15] with the unleavened bread
[1:15:17] she will only rejoice in eating the
[1:15:20] hidden manna
[1:15:22] praise God but there is somebody
[1:15:26] got appointed you know Hallelujah
[1:15:30] with a special something like this like
[1:15:33] what he said
[1:15:35] praise God so he can break that he then
[1:15:38] mother
[1:15:39] say
[1:15:41] praise the Lord
[1:15:44] a little special said
[1:15:50] and the pastor is God's angel to the
[1:15:53] church
[1:15:56] see
[1:15:57] he says here
[1:15:59] your pastor when he stands here on the
[1:16:02] platform ministering the word of God he
[1:16:06] is God's angel
[1:16:08] to the church
[1:16:10] Messenger to the church therefore a
[1:16:14] pastor should never leave the world
[1:16:16] but stay straight with the world
[1:16:20] praise God the pastor need to stay with
[1:16:23] the world
[1:16:25] see because he's feeding the Shepherds
[1:16:29] place because the word pastor means
[1:16:32] Shepherd look it up find out if ain't
[1:16:36] right a pastor is a shepherd
[1:16:40] and the Holy Ghost has made him overseer
[1:16:42] of a certain flock to feed them
[1:16:47] praise God
[1:16:48] with what made the word of God
[1:16:51] hallelujah
[1:16:54] say now he says here
[1:16:57] in the message the question in answer
[1:17:00] the book of Hebrew praise God it's in
[1:17:03] 1957 he said if you are LED if you are
[1:17:06] spirit-led
[1:17:08] by God you become a messenger of God or
[1:17:12] an angel
[1:17:14] God's messenger God's angel is the very
[1:17:18] same word
[1:17:21] can separate it God messenger or God's
[1:17:25] angel and which has the greatest
[1:17:29] Authority
[1:17:31] an angel from heaven or an angel at the
[1:17:35] pulpit
[1:17:36] which has it
[1:17:39] we have angel from heaven with capital A
[1:17:42] we have angel on Earth with a small a
[1:17:46] then the prophet asked which has more
[1:17:51] greatest Authority
[1:17:54] the angel on the pulpit or the angel on
[1:17:56] the heaven
[1:17:58] he says the angel at the pulpit
[1:18:05] why
[1:18:07] that's why Paul said even an angel he
[1:18:10] said
[1:18:11] if an angel from heaven comes and
[1:18:14] preached any gospel to you then
[1:18:16] I the angel of the earth preach let that
[1:18:20] Heavenly Angel be a curse
[1:18:24] see
[1:18:25] so the angel Anointed with the Holy
[1:18:28] Spirit and with the word stands next to
[1:18:30] God
[1:18:31] in heaven
[1:18:35] listen
[1:18:36] your angel on the pulpit is done next to
[1:18:40] God
[1:18:41] see that's why I told you when you read
[1:18:44] that message influence there is a share
[1:18:47] of him
[1:18:48] what is the purpose of the share of him
[1:18:53] see
[1:18:56] to make you holy
[1:19:00] praise God
[1:19:02] Hallelujah
[1:19:04] say just fine
[1:19:07] where God is then you will understand
[1:19:11] where the seraphim is
[1:19:15] Between Heaven and Earth the prophet
[1:19:17] said this is the closest place
[1:19:21] between the Heaven and Earth
[1:19:24] Hallelujah
[1:19:26] say
[1:19:27] that's why the angel is standing behind
[1:19:30] this pulpit
[1:19:32] the prophet said here
[1:19:34] praise God
[1:19:36] Hallelujah
[1:19:38] he stand next to God
[1:19:42] in the heaven
[1:19:43] is Authority
[1:19:46] then the next paragraph says all powers
[1:19:49] in heaven
[1:19:51] and Earth is given into my hand go and
[1:19:55] I'll go with you
[1:19:57] whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in
[1:20:02] heaven what you lose on Earth I will
[1:20:04] lose in heaven John 20 23 who so so ever
[1:20:10] since you remit
[1:20:13] they are remitted
[1:20:16] and whosoever since you retained
[1:20:20] they are retained
[1:20:24] you understand what the pastor is
[1:20:29] Hallelujah
[1:20:32] see
[1:20:34] that's why the prophet said the Pastor
[1:20:36] you need to stay with the world
[1:20:39] that's why
[1:20:41] you need to have a general discernment
[1:20:45] if the pastor leave the world if the man
[1:20:48] leave the word
[1:20:50] leave the man
[1:20:52] follow the word
[1:20:54] say
[1:20:57] praise God it's very clear that's why I
[1:21:00] said
[1:21:02] it's not hard
[1:21:05] the only thing that we need to do you
[1:21:08] know
[1:21:08] say just humble ourselves okay if he
[1:21:12] will humble ourselves then you will
[1:21:13] understand what is the home Church
[1:21:16] what is the pastor
[1:21:18] praise God

[1:29:28] we will go in according to your teaching
[1:29:36] Jesus Will Come
[1:29:39] he will come to you

[1:30:06] praise God
[1:30:09] Hallelujah
[1:30:15] when I read that
[1:30:18] the prophet never said
[1:30:21] after Jesus judged me
[1:30:26] then they will he will judge you he did
[1:30:29] not say that
[1:30:31] he said
[1:30:33] so in the rejected Kings dancers this is
[1:30:37] the time he keeps saying it the same
[1:30:40] thing
[1:30:42] Jesus will come first to him
[1:30:45] and he will judge him
[1:30:48] praise God
[1:30:50] say
[1:30:51] if we pass
[1:30:53] the test
[1:30:55] than him
[1:30:58] praise God
[1:30:59] he says here
[1:31:01] whether they go in whether his people
[1:31:04] will go in or not
[1:31:06] will go we will go in according to your
[1:31:09] teaching
[1:31:10] and I said oh I'm so glad did Paul does
[1:31:13] he did did Paul that she have to stand
[1:31:17] like this does Peter have to stand like
[1:31:19] this yes I said then I preach every word
[1:31:22] that they preach I never deviate from it
[1:31:25] one side to the other were they baptized
[1:31:28] in the name of Jesus I did too where
[1:31:31] they taught the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:32] Ghost I did too whatever they thought I
[1:31:35] did too and then people and then people

[1:31:44] Earth said Jesus again Jesus will come
[1:31:48] and you will be judged according to the
[1:31:50] word that you preach
[1:31:53] that you preach us and then if you are
[1:31:56] accepted at that time which you will be
[1:31:58] and said then you will present us to him
[1:32:01] as your trophies of your ministry
[1:32:06] and you will guide us to him and all
[1:32:09] together will go back to the Earth to
[1:32:11] live

[1:32:41] but also by one man
[1:32:44] we got saved
[1:32:47] okay
[1:32:48] that's why the scripture is very clear

[1:32:54] when the Jailer in the time of Paul
[1:32:57] right
[1:32:59] he says here and they said and Paul said
[1:33:02] the Jailer ashim and brought them out
[1:33:04] and said search what must I do to be
[1:33:07] saved and they said believe on the Lord
[1:33:10] Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved and

[1:33:19] you believe
[1:33:20] all your people believe
[1:33:23] your family and and they will be saved
[1:33:28] the only requirement is somebody to
[1:33:30] believe
[1:33:32] in your house
[1:33:34] like Rahab
[1:33:37] praise God
[1:33:38] only rehab believe the two the two spies

[1:36:31] the inheritance how did to us that an
[1:36:34] inheritance in the land that no one else
[1:36:36] but a close kissman could redeem that
[1:36:39] inheritance now let me just drop on a
[1:36:42] little token
[1:36:44] year that I touched on the other night
[1:36:47] to you mothers how many has prayed for
[1:36:51] your loved ones lost all right there you

[1:36:59] Paul told the Roman said believe on the
[1:37:02] Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thou how
[1:37:05] shall be saved
[1:37:07] see the prophet Paul is quoting again
[1:37:11] the scripture
[1:37:13] if you have faith enough for your own
[1:37:16] self to be saved have faith enough no
[1:37:18] matter how wayward
[1:37:22] that boy is or that girl is they will be
[1:37:27] saved anyhow
[1:37:31] because they are your inheritance
[1:37:35] see
[1:37:37] praise God
[1:37:39] this church is your home
[1:37:41] the pastor is your representation
[1:37:45] praise God see the this the message said
[1:37:50] his son
[1:37:51] next to God
[1:37:55] Hallelujah
[1:37:57] the only thing God needs to do
[1:38:00] is to judge his teaching
[1:38:03] is he teaching the right thing
[1:38:06] praise God
[1:38:08] if your pastor passed that test
[1:38:12] then he will come back to you
[1:38:16] and then he will present you as his true
[1:38:20] peace
[1:38:21] see
[1:38:23] Allelujah
[1:38:30] I don't want to eat it hard okay
[1:38:33] but I think you know what I'm trying to
[1:38:35] say okay he is the door
[1:38:38] praise God one time in one place you
[1:38:41] know they have a lot of Fellowship
[1:38:45] but they have no pastor
[1:38:47] I don't understand it
[1:38:50] praise God
[1:38:53] then one time I say
[1:38:58] how can you be in the rapture
[1:39:00] without a pastor
[1:39:03] will you be in the Rapture without a
[1:39:05] pastor
[1:39:08] I said you cannot
[1:39:11] see
[1:39:13] because you cannot be perfected
[1:39:17] you need the faithful Ministry
[1:39:21] you need the pastor
[1:39:23] evangelist Prophet teacher
[1:39:25] apostle
[1:39:27] praise God
[1:39:29] say but the pastor is a special kind of
[1:39:33] man
[1:39:34] praise God
[1:39:36] Hallelujah that's why you need to choose
[1:39:39] very very carefully
[1:39:42] official Pastor praise God
[1:39:46] if he's teaching the right message
[1:39:50] Hallelujah then you need to respect him
[1:39:54] praise God see
[1:39:58] and they ask me
[1:40:00] and I asked them
[1:40:01] see you cannot be perfected
[1:40:05] because a lot of message people you know
[1:40:08] they don't believe in Pastor I said you
[1:40:10] cannot be perfected without a pastor
[1:40:12] whether you like it or not
[1:40:14] even brother Branham as a pastor
[1:40:18] praise God see that's why I said you
[1:40:21] cannot be you know the mechanical
[1:40:23] equipment
[1:40:26] say
[1:40:28] it won't it won't work you need a pastor
[1:40:31] praise God so when you have a pastor
[1:40:34] like the prophet said love him give him
[1:40:37] the double respect praise God I'm not
[1:40:39] lifting up anybody I'm also a Pastor
[1:40:42] Brian Chad is a pastor but I'm not
[1:40:44] lifting it up but I'm just telling it to
[1:40:46] the people what the pastor is he is the
[1:40:49] door to heaven
[1:40:51] okay
[1:40:53] praise God that's why sometimes we have
[1:40:56] a big problem we have a problem in the
[1:40:59] church you know brother has problem
[1:41:01] praise God that cannot be fixed cannot
[1:41:05] be sold
[1:41:07] but he still wants to come to the church
[1:41:09] with the repentant heart
[1:41:12] halleluia
[1:41:14] see
[1:41:18] then he asked me
[1:41:20] what is the solution
[1:41:22] remember this that's why I keep on
[1:41:24] telling to the people
[1:41:26] if your problem has no more solution the
[1:41:29] only solution is the pastor
[1:41:33] how can that be
[1:41:36] follow the message
[1:41:39] anybody that will love the pastor
[1:41:44] that's why that's why the prophet said
[1:41:47] those who love you
[1:41:50] those you love
[1:41:52] God will give it to you
[1:41:56] see
[1:41:57] that's how important the pastor is
[1:42:01] praise God he is God's angels to you
[1:42:05] praise God to guide you
[1:42:08] he will be accountable
[1:42:11] to your soul
[1:42:12] see that's why I'm very careful even in
[1:42:16] our church I'm very careful when I
[1:42:19] started a message when I started
[1:42:21] scripture before I give it to the people
[1:42:23] praise God see
[1:42:26] because that is the the last
[1:42:29] commandments of Jesus to the apostles if
[1:42:33] you love me
[1:42:35] feed my lamb
[1:42:37] Peter if you love me feed my sheep be
[1:42:40] there if you love me feed my sheep
[1:42:44] say if you love the Lord if the minister
[1:42:47] is a pastor love the Lord he will find
[1:42:51] he will find the food
[1:42:53] for God's children for the ship of God
[1:42:56] for the Lamb of God
[1:42:58] Hallelujah
[1:43:00] see
[1:43:03] that's why in the message you cannot
[1:43:04] feed the flocks in your wishy washy
[1:43:06] message you know
[1:43:09] praise God you cannot do that to the
[1:43:12] message believer
[1:43:14] say in the church that's why I've been
[1:43:16] telling you to the people read the
[1:43:18] message read the message in that way you
[1:43:21] will understand what I am saying
[1:43:23] I give you the quotation but if you
[1:43:25] don't read the message you don't know
[1:43:28] praise God the holy story
[1:43:32] Hallelujah
[1:43:34] say even if you read the message if you
[1:43:37] have no Pastor you will be like the
[1:43:39] eunuch
[1:43:40] remember that in the book of Acts
[1:43:43] then there is one unlearned man
[1:43:47] Phillips
[1:43:49] he said how how do I know if nobody
[1:43:52] explained it
[1:43:54] but he is a smart man
[1:43:58] Hallelujah that is what I'm telling to
[1:44:01] the people
[1:44:03] you need Pastor praise God you need home

[1:53:49] foreign
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:54:05] [Music]
[1:54:16] to be free
[1:54:31] I'll pray
[1:54:36] there
[1:54:39] we are
[1:54:42] here
[1:54:45] [Applause]
[1:54:52] oh
[1:54:54] love
[1:54:55] me through Grace
[1:55:05] yes I want
[1:55:12] [Music]
[1:55:19] us
[1:55:27] [Music]
[1:55:33] together
[1:55:37] [Music]
[1:55:40] aren't you thankful for Grace
[1:55:43] remember we were stuck
[1:55:45] in condemnation by representation
[1:55:48] he freed us
[1:55:50] by representation
[1:55:53] tell you this was a this is a very
[1:55:55] strong sermon tonight
[1:55:58] strong meat
[1:56:00] many of these things I've studied many
[1:56:02] times in the scriptures and read there
[1:56:03] was many more quotes he could go into
[1:56:06] and I know many of the things he said to
[1:56:09] be true firsthand
[1:56:10] but what the prophet said
[1:56:13] amen but it's not something I would ever
[1:56:16] feel comfortable preaching myself
[1:56:19] so it's the grace of God
[1:56:21] and there's some things maybe we didn't
[1:56:23] understand
[1:56:25] there's always difficulty in expressing
[1:56:27] everything and finding every detail and
[1:56:30] balancing everything
[1:56:31] but the principle remains true
[1:56:34] study the message and study the
[1:56:36] scripture you'll find that the principle
[1:56:38] is true
[1:56:39] and if that principle be true then I ask
[1:56:43] you for your prayers
[1:56:46] that you would pray for me
[1:56:48] you'd pray for the other ministering
[1:56:49] brothers and the officers in the church
[1:56:51] because now we find that every gift and
[1:56:54] every position God will use
[1:56:56] it has something to it
[1:56:59] if if God gave gifts unto men and he
[1:57:03] sent a five full ministry for the
[1:57:04] perfecting of saints then that means we
[1:57:07] must have them must absolutely be there
[1:57:10] but oh how difficult it's going to be we
[1:57:14] need each other we need to pray for one
[1:57:17] another
[1:57:18] to say you pray for me and I'll pray for
[1:57:20] you
[1:57:21] I don't know how you felt during the
[1:57:24] sermon but I know how I felt I felt oh
[1:57:26] God you're going to have to help me
[1:57:29] I felt the weight of responsibility I
[1:57:31] felt the heaviness that comes with it
[1:57:33] and I feel it all the time and all I can
[1:57:36] say is would you pray for me and I
[1:57:39] certainly pray for you
[1:57:41] and will labor together and let God
[1:57:43] accomplish what he wants to accomplish
[1:57:45] in this day
[1:57:47] if we can just respect his way and
[1:57:49] respect and honor his word he'll take
[1:57:52] care of the rest
[1:57:54] no no people are perfect I'm not perfect
[1:57:56] you're not perfect we're here not
[1:57:58] perfect but if we can honor and respect
[1:58:00] God's way and honor and reverence his
[1:58:02] word and the way he set things up he'll
[1:58:05] take care of everything
[1:58:06] if we can just submit ourselves to him
[1:58:08] and trust him and put all of our trust
[1:58:10] in him and honor and respect him
[1:58:14] I've never seen it failed to honor God
[1:58:16] and respect him I've never seen him fail
[1:58:20] to keep his word
[1:58:22] everything brother Nester said it's far
[1:58:25] beyond human
[1:58:27] it's beyond the capabilities of human it
[1:58:29] has to be God
[1:58:31] it has to be God working
[1:58:34] or else we'll all find ourselves in
[1:58:36] trouble amen
[1:58:39] let's go from here prayerful and
[1:58:42] reverent
[1:58:44] our heads together
[1:58:46] let's give ourselves to God the heavenly
[1:58:48] father
[1:58:50] Lord you've given us
[1:58:53] strong meat tonight
[1:58:56] well but we see your word
[1:58:59] see what your Prophet told us Lord we
[1:59:01] know there's a truth here
[1:59:03] that we must honor in reverence
[1:59:05] help us father help us in all of our
[1:59:09] infirmities and all of our negative
[1:59:11] thinking
[1:59:12] all of our personalities
[1:59:15] God help us go beyond all of those
[1:59:17] things
[1:59:18] help us pass beyond our preferences and
[1:59:21] our likes and help us recognize your way
[1:59:26] God the way that you set things up the
[1:59:29] way you've designed them the way you've
[1:59:30] laid them in your word
[1:59:32] they are correct
[1:59:34] the way your Prophet taught it and laid
[1:59:36] it out it is correct Lord it is the only
[1:59:39] way
[1:59:40] sometimes it goes even against our
[1:59:42] preference or
[1:59:44] the personalities that we would prefer
[1:59:46] the way we would see something in
[1:59:48] ministered but God this is bigger than
[1:59:50] that
[1:59:51] this is bigger than all the the The
[1:59:54] Superficial elements of personal like
[1:59:57] and taste
[1:59:58] but God this is your ordination these
[2:00:00] are your gifts these are your placings
[2:00:03] these are your sheep lord it's all yours
[2:00:06] and help us to move Beyond these
[2:00:09] superficial carnal things
[2:00:12] help us to recognize your word in your
[2:00:14] way
[2:00:15] help us to submit and reverence
[2:00:17] ourselves to your way
[2:00:19] we're laying ourselves at your feet
[2:00:21] totally vulnerable to your word
[2:00:23] what can we do but obey your word what
[2:00:26] can we do but give reverence to your way
[2:00:29] and we make ourselves vulnerable Lord
[2:00:31] but we're trusting not in ourselves
[2:00:33] we're trusting in you to be our wall of
[2:00:35] protection if we stand behind your word
[2:00:38] your word will defend as your word will
[2:00:40] watch out for itself your word will
[2:00:42] manifest itself
[2:00:44] help us God to surrender to your way
[2:00:47] God help us as a body of Believers Lord
[2:00:50] to protect the home Church to respect
[2:00:53] and reverence one another and help one
[2:00:55] another to love one another
[2:00:57] God I prayed you bless every Ministry
[2:01:00] gift every officer in this place that we
[2:01:02] might administer the gift according to
[2:01:04] your way led by your spirit that we
[2:01:06] would reject all our own thinking and
[2:01:08] come your way Lord
[2:01:10] and I pray God that you would help me
[2:01:12] Lord
[2:01:12] you've placed me in this position and I
[2:01:15] surrender to it Lord but we need your
[2:01:17] help we need Supernatural guidance and
[2:01:19] Leadership we need your Holy Spirit to
[2:01:22] take control help me God I submit I
[2:01:25] surrender as we all do tonight

[2:01:31] what humans can't do

[2:01:35] than we're able in ourselves as we
[2:01:38] surrender and submit we're asking you to
[2:01:39] come and do the supernatural you would
[2:01:42] perform the word perfectly
