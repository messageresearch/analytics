well and also I saw a special friend of mine sister Dolores God bless you back there it's good to have you here last time I saw her she wasn't doing so well she was in the hospital and very sick and my wife and I were visiting someone else in the hospital and we looked down at the end of the hall and I saw our granddaughter walking around on the phone so I just went down to say hi and she said Grandma's not doing well so we stepped in and we had a word of prayer together and so it does my heart good to see you sitting there this morning may God keep continually blessing you amen anybody else is visiting may God bless you you're welcome to be here we're very glad to have you and we just want God to be welcome in our midst we want the Lord Jesus to find welcome in this place amen amen let's turn to the Book of Romans together while we're standing I intend to continue on with the thought we've had on unveiling the amateur gods and uh I'd like to take as a subtitle agents of change and um we'll hopefully be able to uh understand why that's on my heart that way and we'll see how that goes also as you're turning there I want to remind you that we do have the fellowship dinner after the service in the fellowship hall today everyone who's here is welcome to come we'd love for all the visitors to join us and have a time of Fellowship together so we're looking forward to that as well if we could turn to Romans 8:1 15 now verse 15 it says for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then HS Heirs of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together man God bless you as you take your seats so the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God we've got a witness in our heart the spirit bearing with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then were heirs HS of God and Joint HS with Christ that means what inheritance Christ gets we get we're in air with him because we're children of God Amen he is he is called our brother amen because we are children as well we have the same father and so that that puts us in a I would say a very special place and and it's something we don't have to worry or fret about it's a guaranteed position that we'll be we are joint HS with Christ I want to read just two quotes as a review from what we've been looking at and the message as the eagle stirs her nest he says he is messiah messiah is the anointed one and we are his children which have a lesser anointing so as Jehovah Eagle is Great Eagle and we are eaglets he's Messiah and we with the same anointing are Messi amen anointing Messiah means the anointed one are you anointed amen what with the same spirit that he was anointed with we have it in measure he has it without measure he was God manif In the Flesh and we're sons of God parts of him coming on yes sir the very works that I do shall you do also and then he goes to the analogy of a spoonful of water you take the Spoonful out of the ocean and what you have is a portion of the ocean with the same quality as what's in the ocean with a different quantity and he begins to show that the spirit of God that's deposited us and the life of God is deposit in US is a portion Jesus had it in fullness amen but we have a portion and it's not an inferior quality it's a less quantity it's part of God Amen and so then again in the message the Messiah says now that's is true God called Messiah called God called us and we become Kings and Priests unto God Like Jesus was God's high priest we become a lesser priest and that's what we focused on uh this past Wednesday God in fullness dwelt in him to shine forth the expression of God to the world world for God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and as God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself God comes into his church and anoints him some messes oh my do you see it the same things he did is is in his church the same power he had is in his church and his church becomes his dominion and he's King over the Dominion and we are Kings in Priest offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name amen oh my there you are messet messet little Messiahs little anointed ones anointed off of what the main one anointed off that great one so now we're looking at our position in God and our true identity and one thing the message did that was so marvelous for me is it took away my false identity the lie that i' had been living on my life and it brought the truth of a true identity because identity amen changes is everything about us you remember how brother B said how important it is to name your child to give your child a good name yes is that right brother B goes in and many times he explains that and we see that God many times will change the name of his children and major events in their life when they're getting when they're meeting God or something in their life is about to change he changes their name because the change of by name changes identification and brother R tells us when you have a a name if you name your child something you've placed an identification on them by that name because that name means something and that meaning begins to identify them and they begin to respond to the name that you call them because an identity is so important amen and so this message came to to to tell us who we really are Amen to tell us that you're a bride amen that you're Messiah that you're Lesser God became it gave us identification and tell us that we came from God and we go back to God Amen and that we're the apple of his eye the love of his life we're the portion of the word that's to be fulfilled in this day what's he doing he's the message is bringing us a true identification because identification has to do with positioning and the positioning has to do with power we're going to get into that as we go so we'll see how important it is to have the right identification we are all born under a lie we grow up we have a birth certificate and we look at the birth certificate and said this is my origin this is my mother this is my father this is my name this is my birthday this is when I began existence this is where I began existence and and and that is all a lie because in reality I began long before I was in the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world Amen so this was just the beginning of an Earthly dispensation for me an Earthly Journey a plan that God had a temporary position that he put me in to accomplish his purpose this birth certificate I have is not my identification it is only a placing where God placed me to do something for his kingdom for a short period of time but this is my birth certificate this is my true identification this is who I really am where I came from and where I'm going amen Because unless I know who I am and what my purpose is I'll constantly be be wasting energy and time chasing the wrong things in life going down the wrong roads trying to accomplish the wrong things putting the wrong emphasis in the wrong places and wasting the time that God's given me amen because I in order for me to do what God's called me to do I need to know who I am and what it is he wants me to do praise God and so when we when we look here at this uh uh title agents of change in the message perseverant brother B said God always works through agents men man is God's agent always not Creed not denomination but man so God brother man said God is on partnership with man he does nothing unless he works through a man man is God's agent upon the Earth and when brother R talks about this he tells us he uses the example of uh Jesus standing one day looking out over the multitudes and he says Behold The Harvest is ripe and the the the field is ripen the Harvest pray to the Lord of the Harvest that he'll send laborers into the Harvest and and brother said he was the lord of the Harvest he was looking at the Harvest he knew the need but yet he's asking them to pray pray at that to the lord of the Harvest so he's saying you pray to me so that all sin labors because because you can see that laborers are needed well Jesus himself could see that laborers were needed but God has set up his program where it doesn't move without you and I he has to have agents on the earth to move things amen there there's uh there's when I looked at this title of I was looking at agents and agents of change I titled that for a reason because my son Blake's last job that he just had before he he took a new position was the change agent I said well what's a change agent you know but it was somebody who when they needed to make changes for Improvement somebody had to be an agent to facilitate that change or to work in it or talk to everybody and bring it about and he was a change agent well well I wonder if our purpose here isn't to make changes amen if we can be agents of change if we're God's agents on the earth and and so God uses man and we understand that and I want to talk about that but there's many things that I've been uh uh looking at meditating on so I just pray you have you bear with me and just pull I'm asking you to you always pull but just for me put in a little extra tug because I've been looking at a few things and for me you know sometimes you look at things and I don't understand how they correlate I can't seem to make them line up amen it's like scattered shot uh for me on paper but I know they go together somehow because God's laid it on my heart and sometimes I just have to come to the pull pit and Trust amen that under the anointing and under the inspiration of the word God will line it up and this morning happens to be one of those days so I pray that you just give a little extra tug on the other side of the Rope for me please you may have to pull me through a little bit amen uh let's turn together to 2 Corinthians chapter 5 2 Corinthians chapter 5 in verse 18 2 Corinthians 5 we'll begin at Verse 18 and all things are of God who ha reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and ha given to us the ministry of reconciliation to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ dead be reconciled to God so God was in Christ reconciling the world and to himself not laying to them the the charge of their transgressions amen but now he's given to us the word of reconciliation so now the work that Christ was doing now falls upon us for we're ambassadors for Christ so an ambassador is an agent yes you can see he he's representing something else in a foreign land and we're here in a foreign land representing Christ amen and we're here as ambassadors for Christ with a word of reconciliation because his ministry was a Reconciliation to God but he's given us the word of reconciliation and now as ambassadors we're carrying on the work of reconciling man back to God that's what we're here for and so we are agents we are ambassadors and I'm going to go into a story this story is not directly related but it I I believe it's going to be related if you'll just bear with me now we know that God sent the prophet to us amen and brother Brenham came and and listen it wasn't his choice to come it wasn't his choice to be a prophet of the age it wasn't his choice to be born in poverty it wasn't his choice to to have a gift in his life amen God did that amen God did that because he placed him as an agent on the earth for you and I he was an ambassador amen an ambassador with the word of reconciliation and so we know his life we we we've been privileged to see and to watch and to hear and to hear testimonies and know so so much about his life and and there's so many things that are striking in it but this is one that I want to uh draw our attention to and this comes from the fifth seal but brother benam mentions it in several places and it's the time that he went beyond the curtain of time and he begins speaking about this in 1960 where he goes beyond the curtain of time and and all that transpired there but here in the fifth seal I'm just going to pull a a small portion he says oh and then I said well isn't this wonderful and then I thought isn't that Wonder wonder and I I heard something nicker like a horse and I looked in my little saddle horse that I used to ride Little Prince I thought so much of him here he was standing there by me and put his head over on my shoulder to hug me like I used to give him sugar you know and I put my arm around him said Prince I know you'd be here here he is in the sixth Dimension with theophanes beyond the curtain of time and and God transports him there he said you know a voice says to him would you like to see beyond the curtain of time would that help he said oh it would help me so much and so God what is God trying to do with this transporting be on the curtain of time is to encourage his Prophet so would that encourage you he said yes that would encourage me so much so in the encouragement he sees all the people and they're running up to my precious brother he sees the woman that was saved past 90 now young and vibrant in in the peak of health and and now all of a sudden as he's taking all of this in he hears a little nicker and over his shoulder comes the head of a a horse a little saddle horse he had and he says I thought so much of him and then he goes on he said I felt something lick my hand there was my old dog and when Mr short down here poisoned him I swore I'd kill Mr short for it I was about 16 years old he poisoned him give him a dog Button my daddy caught me with a rifle going down to shoot him right in the police station and I said I'll kill him I went over to the dog's grave I said Fritz you've been like a companion to me you clothed me and sent me to school when you got old I was going to take care of you now they've killed you I said I promise you Fritz that he won't live and I said I promise you he won't live I'll catch him on the street sometime walking then I'll run right over him see I'll I'll get him for you but you know what I led the man to Christ baptized him in jesus' name and buried him at his death I got converted about a few years after that I seen things different then I loved him instead of hating him so then but however there was Fritz standing there licking me on the hand I looked I couldn't cry nobody could cry it was all joy you couldn't be sad cuz it was all happiness you couldn't die cuz it was all life you couldn't get old cuz it was all youth it was just perfect I thought oh isn't this wonderful and oh my I was right at home see and just then I heard a voice and it cried out out and said all that you ever loved then in parenthesis it says reward for my service I don't need no reward he said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given to you man that's such a an amazing story I I've meditated on that a lot and thought about it a lot there's many things about it I can't correlate there's many things about it I can't comprehend and a natural human mind kind of comp apprehension uh but nonetheless it's the truth when he went beyond the curtain of time there was his saddle horse that he thought so much of and threw and he threw his arm around him and he patted him and and it made him feel so good and then he felt a lick on his hand and there was a dog his old dog and you're thinking of all the things that this man could experience beyond the curtain of time of all the things that he could come back and tell us of all the important information you could glean from that realm and all the important things that can happen and all the things that matter the most amen when he comes back he begins to tell us of the people he saw and the experience he had and the position that he has and we learned so much from this this uh this translation that he had but one thing that is in there that is so astonishing to me is that God had placed in there a reward for a servant for service because he was faithful to his Call of Duty and he was faithful to his position on the earth and when he when he went beyond the curtain of time there was a reward there for him and that reward was a horse and a dog I started asking myself questions like do we all get a horse and a dog do I even want a horse and a dog some of you would be upset if you had a old dog like I don't want an old dog do you get the animal of your choice do you get you know these are just the questions I ask I just meditate on this cuz it's in the message for a reason it's and God told us and showed it to us for a purpose there's a purpose behind everything this isn't just trivial bits of information but he had this tremendous experience to come back not just to encourage him but I believe to encourage you and I and so now I I'm sitting there thinking why a horse and a dog and and what dog would I want and I'm thinking I wouldn't really want to be bothered with a dog but this wasn't just any horse or any dog this just wasn't a horse and a dog what what I begin to meditate on is we this was a a lonely little boy rejected coming up in in poverty and through rejection and in isolation and he had a gift in his life that made him a little odd even to his family he come in a status in life that made him a little odd and rejected and society and and he had something that he loved think about this there was something he loved as that struggling boy and listen God had to allow him to come the struggling way because he had a gift in his life that he had to use and there had to be character built there had to be a life of difficulty he had to go through training for his position because he was going to be an ambassador an agent of God and God had to send them this way he had to have the alcoholic father he had to see all the wrong he had to be rejected he had to have all of that but because he was doing all that to serve God's purpose there was some things in his life when he was struggling so much that he loved that he said frit you were a companion to me this wasn't a dog this was a lonely little boy who had a companion that would be alone with him out in the woods when he was trying to get away from the world and the rejection and the pain and everything else God had provided for him this little dog may not been little it could have been a big dog I don't know the whole point is to me when I began to meditate on this and think about it it was more than a horse and more than a dog it doesn't mean that I'm going to have a horse and have a dog or you're going to have a horse and have a dog that don't think that's what this means but he says it's reward for your service and brother I don't need a reward but yet God gave him something and what did God give him God gave him something that he loved that horse and that dog in the sixth Dimension were a product of his love and they were there as a result of his love that's just this just my observation and he said it's a reward for your service if you'll turn with me to Hebrews please I'm laying this in here I I I trust for a reason I believe for a reason but let's look together at Hebrews chapter 11 and let's go to verse 6 Hebrews 11 and 6 says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him I never looked at this verse quite the same as I do now after going back and reading brother brenham's uh experience from The Fifth Dimension when he gives his experience beyond the curtain of time says but without faith it is impossible to please him you can't please God by works you can't please God by Church attendance you can't please God by intellectually knowledge of his Bible it's the only way to please God Is by faith am and faith in what faith in God what is God God is the word amen what word the word that's presented to you in your day that's the portion of God presented to you that's what we have to believe and without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is not was or will be present tense You Must Believe in a present tense God so those that come to God Must Believe in a present tense God you must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so now all of a sudden for me to come to God I it's without faith is impossible to believe impossible to please him so I have to have faith faith in what faith in God the god that's presented to me in the day that I live which is the anointed word that's presented to us in this day which is the message of the hour so in order to please him I must believe him amen and if I believe him I also must I also must believe I'm sorry for he that cometh to God must believe that he is but I also must believe that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him it's important for me to believe that he's a rewarder and that's what I I I'm going to begin to talk about I hope that it comes together as clear as it is in my heart I hope it comes out and God makes it clear in your heart because there's something about coming as an agent of God as an ambassador where you're going to have to sacrifice yourself for the cause of God you're going to have to give up your preference and your wants and you're going to have brother Benham had to sacrifice to do his job he had to give up on friendship he had to give up on popularity he had to give up on many things and some of those things he didn't even ask to give up on but God put him in a position that was going to train him for where he would come and he would have to come through alcohol parents Our Father he'd have to come through rejection he'd have to come through poverty he didn't volunteer for that but yet that was also part of his life so that he could come and do the job God called him to do then he would have to voluntarily give up friendship give up popularity give up opportunities for wealth he would have to give up all of that to be what to be an agent for change on this Earth to be an ambassador of Jesus Christ on this Earth and so doing so Amen in order to come to God by faith and to please God am and to know you have to know that he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him because if you know he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him you can give everything up to follow him to be an agent to serve him to be an ambassador because God's going to take care of it in the end he didn't make it optional in verse 6 without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him for us to do the job that God's called us to do we must believe that he's a rewarder amen of those that diligently seek him because for us to do what he's called us to do we're going to have to give up surrender sacrifice because we're not here for ourselves we're not here for our reputation we're not here to serve our purpose we're here as ambassadors for Christ we're here as agents of God that he's put into the Earth to accomplish his purpose we're not here for our own self-gratification we're not here to build wealth we're not here uh uh to to gain what we can gain out of this life materially we're actually been placed here to be an agent for him and to be an agent for him I've got to give up many of those things I've got to give up I mean there's some Ambitions we just have to give up amen when they come to you and offer you a promotion and you're going to get a lot more money but you're going to have to move away from the church God placed you in and where there's no Fellowship amen you're going to have to surrender that to stay an agent amen praise God Amen when they want to give you a scholarship to go to school but they're going to send you somewhere where you have no Fellowship you can't serve God you can't go to church you can't be in fellowship and you say I'm turning down the scholarship because I'm an agent for Jesus Christ I'm an ambassador amen you have to believe that he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him so that you can surrender your life and let God handle it all let God keep the records he's a rewarder I don't have to worry about it I want to look at a story here that brother M tells in many places but in this place I'm looking at is to look away to Jesus he's talking about sister Hatty Wright and sister Hattie Wright was her maiden name she was have the family she had been married and her husband passed away she had a different last name but I don't recall what that is but we all know where his had he right and we know the story of Howdy write how she was in poverty she was a widow she had two teenage boys she was Raising and brother man said she was scratching out a living with a hoe and a shovel and a little piece of land and and didn't have hardly anything and brother bam goes to the wri house brother and sister Wright and they're all gathered in the house and and he tells the story many times and he gives all these little details H Hattie was sitting off to the side she wasn't even the main part of the conversation she was sitting in the back off to the side keeping real real quiet brother B said she wasn't saying anything she wasn't the center of attention she was just kind of on the outside of the circle there at the house at her parents' home and her boys were there they were sitting off to the side as well and brother B starts to relay the story of the creation of squirrels how God came to him in the woods and and began to speak to him and and and told him that you have need of squirrels and he spoke and they come this way and and this one crossed the field and climbed the tree and shot it out he's going through the details of this creation and he's talking about how God had commanded him to speak and whatever he said would come to pass and brother benham's words now became the spoken word and that spoken word Had Creative power and it create a squirrel where there was no squirrel right so we we want to I I want to uh understand the magnitude of this story listen you and I have heard that story how many times we've heard it we've heard it on tape we've heard other people talk about hearing the brother tell the story we we we've come to accept it as a fact but this was the first time the right family ever heard it this was their first time and listen put yourself in their place Amen in that day they loved brother bam they appreciated him they knew he had a gift in his life but yet the full realization of who he was in the scripture was not made known at that day that's when he began to tell this in the I think it was 59 or 60 or something like that he begins to talk about this experience amen they didn't know amen that he was Revelation 10:7 they didn't know that he was the seventh angel these things were just beginning to come to light but they knew that he was a man of God they knew that that he loved him and they knew he had a gift in his life and they knew he was a prophet but the full magnitude of who this was sitting in their living room had not sunk in yet and so now this is their brother in church just like one of your brothers here in church is over at your house and they're telling you I was in the woods the other day I was hunting up against a tree and the squirrels weren't moving and I couldn't find a squirrel anywhere and I hunted all morning and I was just sitting there and and all of a sudden The Voice come down through and and said speak and whatever you say it'll be and and and and I said what God he says what do you what I speak for what do you have need of you're hunting aren't you and he said I then then you know brother is telling the story listen this is a this is a brother in your church this is your pastor who's come to dinner saying I said this squirrel will come down here and run across the field run up there and the nest one will be in in a in a locust tree which they never in a locust tree this will will climb a sycamore they don't like to climb a Sycamore and all of these things and he tells them about shooting them and about going and getting them and they're bleeding and a vision doesn't bleed and all and and he tells this story and off in the back to the side and the Outer Circle of the fellowship that's taking place little Hattie he said this is what brother B says and little Hattie said the right word she said that's nothing but the truth brother baham started relating this story to Abraham amen uh offering Isaac and Jehovah Gyra providing a ram in the thicket and where there was no Ram God created a ram and he's starting to tie that scripture to this experience in the woods and he's starting to to to to to talk about Jesus said and you'll do the Greater Works and and he and he's tying these scriptures but had he right amen when she was hearing him describe this and hearing the story in inside of her she knew that was nothing but the truth it was nothing but the truth but he didn't point to a scripture and say that William Brenham will speak squirrels to existence or that anybody will speak squirrels into existence or that anybody will speak anything into existence he's relating it to the scriptures to the promise in the Church of Greater Works he's tying it together to the nature of Jehovah Gyra amen he's doing all that but he's not telling her the Bible said someday there'll be a man that comes to Earth that's given the power of the spoken word amen to manifest the the the third pool the Redemptive Rights of Man coming back into man and he's going to speak and God's going to create squirrels she couldn't base this Faith Off reading something she couldn't base this Faith off an intellectual argument where things are put tightly together this was something that came from her soul this was something she knew that this man is telling the truth what he said happened in the woods is nothing but the truth that came from the depths of a soul that came from a c Gene of God that didn't come from a mind because the mind wasn't being titillated with facts and figures and documents and and and paper amen that was something she was hearing for the very first time that she never even knew needed to be done by man that wasn't a scripture verse saying that that exactly thing would happen but inside of her she knew that this is God what was she doing she was believing that God is amen this is a present tense God working right now through the Flesh of this man right here that's nothing but the truth that's nothing but God that's absolutely right you're not making it up this is the truth and somebody could have said Hade what Bible verse are you referencing she I don't even know what Bible verse I'm referencing there's something inside of me that's referencing back saying that's the truth you must believe that he is am brother B says and when she said that brother Banks Woods here is one that was present the room felt like it was coming apart prise God and the Holy Spirit said the voice the same voice that spoke about this girl said give her what she asked for give her what she asked for amen and she looked around and said what shall I say brother brandham I said say what your desire is think of your greatest desire and say it brother B was saying that he himself the man who just told the story about creating squirrels in existence and having the power of the spoken word he's telling her maybe ask for healing for your sister maybe ask for $10,000 whatever you want God will give it to you so here the man who told the story and the man who gives the promise is trying to qux her I'm just not qux her he's just he's just throwing out ideas maybe this maybe that whatever you ask for amen and there's something whatever whatever it was that stirred her to believe that was nothing but the truth was still stirring inside of her and brother said and her boys was even snickering and laughing and she said the greatest desire I have is the Salvation of my two sons and I said I give them to you in the name of Jesus Christ and there they went brother B said they those boys were even snickering and laughing and in the side and joking and all of a sudden immediately when he says that they fall on their mother's lap weeping and repenting they come to church they baptize him he said later in a message they're even participating in feet washing amen what was it amen he that you cannot please God yes without faith amen and he that cometh to God must believe that he is present tense God she you know what she didn't say hadie Wright was not saying I believe in you brother bam she's saying that's nothing but the truth what you said is the word it's truth it's God it's right it's absolutely true she was recognizing God in her midst when Millions would scratch their heads when Millions would say I that story I don't know I need to know a little more show me a little bit where does it tie in the scriptures there was something in that woman that could believe now don't get me wrong I'm not I'm not saying we don't look in the scriptures we we must find everything we believe in the word of God that's why God's given it to us but this woman had Faith genuine Faith from a seed of God Amen and God was so pleased with her response God didn't say Haddie you're little reckless you may want to be careful pray about this first and go search it out you're being just a little bit irresponsible Hattie God didn't say that because God knew it was truth and she knew it was truth and she was in alignment with God God was so pleased with her faith what pleased what was God pleased with her faith he was so pleased with her faith he told his Prophet give her whatever she wants and she's wondering this and that what should I do and all of a sudden she said the greatest desire of my heart is the Salvation in my two boys and he said listen brother Ben said I give them to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen those boys were saved not on the Merit of their actions but on the faith of their mother and her love for them she received a reward praise God Amen she received a reward what was that when God told Propet give her whatever she asked for that's a reward those boys salvation was not because they were repentant they were over in the corner snickering not because they were interested in the things of God they were disinterested in the things of God but they were her reward and they could not resist the hand of God when the presence of God fell and the hand of God fell they couldn't hold back anymore and it brought them to weeping and to repentance and the baptism in Jesus name and all of that and and and it was because of a mother's Faith she was she she was a a an agent of God she was standing on the earth she had a c Gene of God she had Faith genuine faith in the word of God a god that is and when she expressed that brother B said she said the right word and when she said the right word God was so pleased to give her what she wants said what I want is the Salvation of my boys and God didn't say if you can get them to repent if you can get them to straighten up their life if you can get them to start coming to church he just said I give them to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen without faith it is impossible to please God and those that come to him must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him it's important to understand that God is a rewarder amen of those that diligently seek seek Him amen as we move from there I want to keep moving down this line of being agents of change or ambassadors for Christ let's go to Matthew chapter 7 now there's one thing that I would like to address while we're here is I don't want to draw any conclusions by what I just said I mean I shouldn't say any conclusion everybody's going to draw conclusions but I don't want you to think that I'm saying that all of our loved ones and all of our children and everybody we know will be saved because somebody and ask brother Brown that question somebody come in 1964 questions and answers and they say well all the children of believer in parents be saved and brother B said no said no so I don't want you to take what I'm saying further than what the prophet took it and what the truth really is but I do believe he's a rewarder how he M meets it out and in what measure I cannot control I cannot dictate to God I cannot control I cannot force I cannot make but one thing I can do is I can believe believe that he's a rewarder I can have faith in his ability to reward I can have faith in his goodness and his righteousness and his understanding and if he could understand the love a prophet had for a horse and a dog he can understand the love that I have the situations I come through the the the needs that I had amen the people who met those needs I believe God can reward for all of that I don't know how I don't know how it all work I'm not here to explain it all I cannot explain it all I don't know how all of that worked but I know for a fact that it worked and so don't don't get carried away too far because if you I'm we're going to read here we're going to find out if we take the wrong understanding and the wrong thinking it's going to produce the wrong actions let's go to Matthew chapter 7 Matthew 7: 7 says in Matthew chap 7:7 he said ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened or what or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent if you then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him these scriptures must become a reality this has to move from that's a nice scripture to that scripture is for me amen and I believe it to be true in the message the token of been reading in the token uh all day yesterday and brother B makes this statement he says now watch fully now full fully obedience to the whole word of God entitled us to the Token then when we pray we we must have the token to present with our prayer if you say I pray Lord but really I I haven't well you don't just might as well stop go ahead first get the token because that token is what he'll recognize see yes sir we're going to talk in a minute on what the token is when we pray then we must present the token Lord I have obeyed you fully I have repented of my sins I feel you have forgiven me I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ the holy spirit is upon me now I have need of a certain thing for your glory Lord I ask for it it's mine now then there is something anchors back here and he says it's yours that does it then it's all over it's all over it's settled I ask for this I ask for it I must have it I want it For Your Glory see well that's it then he just gives it to you then you know it's yours that's the way it is our children so forth we apply the blood believe it that's all so brother Benham is saying listen he saying now you must apply the token in your prayer what is the token and we'll read a quote in a minute but what is the token he said it's the literal life of Jesus Christ the same life that was released at Calvary when the blood cell was broken that same life is now back in The Believer it's the life of Jesus Christ it's the power that changed you it's the thing that opened the word to you amen and when you pray you present that token back because what is the token that token is the life of God and in your prayer you're saying Lord I have received this life this life that changed me this life that birthed me this life that brought me into your word and I'm presenting my request with your life back to you and you said if I ask for anything I can have it and I'm asking for this because listen he says I need it for your glory what brother bam showing us is he's checking the motive checking the objective asking for the right reasons and presenting the token the token remember when we spoke about priest I believe it was Wednesday maybe I've got that wrong by now but when we spoke about the priest the priest every priesthood must have blood to present as they intercede because with intercession has to come blood amen for an atonement to cover the sins and so we as a a royal priesthood we're under the order of MDC and ELC was not an ordinance after Cardinal ordinances but after an everlasting life it was the ordinance of life life in the high priest of of of mzc who Jesus Christ now took on that high priest role of mzc so we are priest under the high priest which means what we are priest with life amen the everlasting life eternal life and that's the life of the blood that we present with our request which is God's own life that he shed amen for you and I now we're recipients of that life and when we come to God it's not just with a request but it's a request with a token we've got the we're interceding now for something or somebody God because we've got life to present to you we're recipients of Life here's the sacrifice here's the life here's where it abides and now I'm doing my role as a priest and interceding for somebody else am it's really important that we come the right way brother B said that's the way we come and when we come by faith listen brother B say it's not words this is not just a a a Rec writing of words and then walking away and saying I've applied the token no it's Faith it's an operation of faith believing who you are in the life that's in you and it's desperation and intercession and requesting before God and when you do that he said all of a sudden as you're doing that the something anchors back here what is that that's a revelation that God's answered your prayer something anchors and then you have it then it's settled brother Brenham never made it an act verbalization and walking away and saying I applied the token now I have it no he said you apply it by faith and then something anchors back here all of a sudden you know he's answered your request you know you contacted God and you know he heard and you know he answered then you can walk away and say thank you God you're going to have whatsoever you asked for amen until that happens you just keep interceding you keep reminding God I'm still believing in this I'm still holding on to the promise I'm still standing in the Gap I'm still believing but when when it anchors in your soul it's yours it's finished and so we realize as agents on the earth as ambassadors for Christ we hold a special role of intercession that most of the world doesn't have we know who we are and where we came from we know our relationship to God we also know what he's done for our life and what he's given to us of his own life we're recipients of the life we're carriers of the life and so that puts us in a different position alog together now this is why I went into the things that I went into with hadie Wright and brother Brenham beyond the curtain of time is because if we know our position and that we're here as ambassadors and we we have resources the world doesn't have we have a position the world doesn't have and we have a life the world doesn't have then that means our life should be a life of love and service because no one else in the world can do it we have to sacrifice and give and project love because if we don't do it who else is going to do it if we don't stand in the Gap who else is qualified to stand on the Gap if we don't intercede who else is qualified to intercede am but in order for me to do that means I'm going to have to give I'm going to have to give him myself I'm going to have to give sacrificially I'm going to have to love first so there going to be love in return I'm going to have to stand in the Gap and when spit on I can't spit back when ried on I can't RI back amen when when Jesus was hanging on the cross he was in this position of intercession he was interceding for the sins of the people and they were mocking him making fun of him laughing at him spitting on him amen they they humiliated him by stripping him naked they falsely accused him they did everything they could possibly do to him and what was he doing he was standing there wide open Bare before them humiliated degraded abused beaten within a a few inches of his life and now they're walking by wagging their heads making fun of him making false claims about what he claimed you know what he says father amen praise God forgive them but they don't know what they're doing amise God how can you stand in that position unless you know that he's a rewarder he's a rewarder friends he doesn't miss anything nothing goes unnoticed God will take care of it all you can give up yourself cuz he's a rewarder you can sacrifice yourself cuz he's a reward you can give your time your energy you can give your reputation you can give your health you can give you can give your time and go pray why cuz he's a rewarder I don't have to preserve myself preserve my time preserve my reputation I don't have to provide for myself or make sure that I get what I have do me at the end of The Journey he's a rewarder I can be an ambassador I can give and give give and give and give because he's a rewarder not that we even feel like we deserve a reward brother B didn't feel like he deserved a reward but I'm telling you something God is so gracious so go loving so merciful that when brother bren's beyond the curtain of time there is a horse oh let that sink in there's a dog a dog beyond the curtain of time that's the luckiest dog that has ever lived [Applause] of the billions of dogs that's been on the face of the Earth that's the luckiest dog that I know God is so mindful so thoughtful so understanding he saw he saw the sacrifice of that little boy he saw the pain he saw the suffering he was going to bring it for good he saw it all amen he knew he knew all that he was going to suffer with and all he was going to go go through but God is a rewarder friends he's a rewarder we don't have to worry about it he's going to take better care of us than we expected I don't think the prophet of God brother bam never I don't believe now I can't say never but we don't ever hear him say I never hear Brother B say I always prayed that my horse would be in heaven I always wanted Fritz to be with me in heaven he believed you'd be there he he told Fritz if there's a a place in heaven for dogs you'll be there but God was taking care of it for him because God's a rewarder sometimes we worry so much about preservation we worry so much about our reputation our feelings our heartaches our sacrifices when somebody else ask us of us something and we've already given we start to get frustrated the problem is we're we're frustrated because we're trying to preserve some more of our time or more of our energy and there's times that you have to preserve or else you'll collapse I mean but there's times that we just get offended because I want to keep my time and I don't want to sacrifice and I don't want to surrender but if we continually reward ourselves where will our reward be we're here not for ourselves but we're here as agents and there's a benefit for that I would like to turn to Genesis 18 together Genesis Chapter 18 and let's begin with verse 20 we find before this that God comes to Abraham in flesh from The Plains of man and he begins to explain to him that Sodom and gomorah are going to be destroyed and Abraham begins to barter with God for the lives of the people in Sodom and he and he and he says here seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him and the Lord said because the Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very Grievous I will go down now and see whether they have done all together according to the Cry of it which is come unto me and if not I will know and the men turned their face from hence and went toward Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the Lord and Abraham Drew near and said wil thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked per Adventure there be 50 righteous within the city wil thou also destroy and not spare the place for 50 righteous that are therein he begins to talked to God and said would you destroy would you and he in what what Abraham is doing now is he's standing in the Gap he's beginning to intercede with God and he's praying to God he's talking to God about would you is there any way you could spare it would you destroy it if there's righteous if there's 50 and he said I wouldn't for 50 then he goes I think to 45 or 40 and 30 and 20 and he works his way down amen but but but Abraham is concerned amen Abraham has a family on his mind he's concerned about somebody in Sodom he's concerned a uh he's concerned about life and he's standing in the Gap to preserve life and we know that Abraham has a nephew down there that he loves and love is compelling Abraham to stand in the Gap God would you destroy it now don't destroy what about 50 what about this and he keeps coming back to God and he keeps working until finally God stops and God leaves the conversation Abraham would have went down to one if God stayed there would you destroy it if there was one righteous and and so we know that it was lot that he was concerned for and when we look at Genesis 19 verse 27 it says and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord and he looked towards Sodom and gor and toward all the land of the plain and behold and lo the smoke of the country went up as the the smoke of a furnace and it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which lot dwelt God did not remember lot God remembered Abraham God saved lot although lot was righteous and Sodom vexed his righteous Soul the sins that were there there was something good about lot also but the scripture says it didn't say God remembered lot's righteousness and sent him out it says God remembered Abraham and sent out lot amen Abraham's intercession listen he didn't get an answer God didn't say don't worry lot's going to be okay because he woke up in the morning and he went and stood in the spot and he looked and he saw the smoke and the fire coming up who knows what he felt on the inside but God knew what was inside Abraham and Abraham had left all and separated all and given up and been mocked and r for a stand on the word and God remembered Abraham and he brought lot out he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him I believe it amen man let's go to Joshua chapter 2 Joshua chapter 2 verse 12 this is the story of Rahab and Jericho and she had received the spies and hid the spies and and now the spies are going to go off and this is her conversation with them before they they leave says now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token and that ye will save alive my father and my mother my brethren my sisters and all that have all they have and deliver our lives from Death now this is Rahab Rahab had Faith Rahab pleased God because she believed in God and she believed that God is amen what was Rahab believing when those two spies came she believed the god that is in her day she believed that this is God this is God's representation this is God's move amen and she believed that they were going to come and sweep through the land why she was believing in the present tense word of God she was believing in present tense [Applause] God she her her fa her faith went into action and she preserved the life of the two witnesses and and now she's sending them off and and she's saying but now listen she's she's got a concern in her heart she's got a she's got faith to believe amen now her faith goes into action but she's got a concern in her heart she says give me a true token and that ye will save alive my father my mother my brethren my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from Death she wasn't just concerned for herself she was concerned for her family Joshua 2:17 let's go down to verse 17 and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou has made us swear behold when we come into the land Thou shalt bind this line of scarlet in the window which thou did let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy Brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be Guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our heads if any be upon him now they promised a Salvation to her family if she if Rahab could get her family under the token that they gave her amen she had a token if she could get her family under the token they could be saved amen what was the salvation of her family first it was rahab's faith and then it was her love rahab's Faith Made A Way made a token that was rahab's faith God rewarded her with a token because she believed the god that is amen but what was what was the open door of Salvation to her father and her mother and her Brethren and her sisters and all her family it was her love love for them that opened the door because her faith gave her a token her love gave them an Open Door praise God God is always saving by faith and love Faith and love Faith and love Faith and love and if we have faith who do we love if we have faith who do we love wonder my goodness we're agents for God we're ambassadors for God we're on Earth for a reason how he writes boys were saved by faith and Love A Mother's Love brother brandham brother bram's horse and his dog were in heaven well he said what in heaven of sixth Dimension his horse and his dog are in a sixth Dimension why because of his faith and his love oh my goodness God is so good in the message desperation brother benam says this he's going to describe to us what the token is so now we have sometimes allowed it the Lutheran allowed it to accepting the word accepting Christ as personal savior the Methodist said when you get happy enough to shout that's it the Pentecostal says speak in tongues then you got it and we find out that all of it was wrong the token is the token it's you and Christ as persons together it's the Holy Spirit his life in you working his own life through you and it's for the rich the poor and whosoever will receive receive it that's the token the token is the holy spirit it's the life of God in you now a little further down just a couple paragraphs lower he says now just not no certain evidence because he's still people are still questioning How Will I Know What's the evidence so not just no certain evidence you say brother bam I he goes I felt it in your mind you see why will we know look what you were and what you are amen there is how you know what was you before the token was applied what are you after it's applied what was your desire before and what is your desire after then you know whether the token is applied or not and these other things just automatically go with it what he's talking about he's talking about there was a change inside of you your desires your thinking your everything about you changed on the inside amen it may took a while for the outside to catch up with the inside but there was a change by the baptism of the Holy Ghost a new birth where the seed that could receive God's word sprung to life and changed you on the inside and your whole desire everything you wanted changed what were you before what were you after amen what was your desire before what was your desire after what is it that's the Holy Ghost inside of you that's the token that's the life that you present with your request that's what makes us ambassadors on this earth now brother B comes to the message The God Who is rich in Mercy this is from 1965 he said I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are you're not going to be but now you are the sons of God see you always were the sons of God God Amen brother B said he's trying to get over get us over a fear and a scare a fear that we won't make it or we're not good enough or we're trying to get over all of that it's not that you you've all always been Sons and Daughters of God you've just come to the realization of your position and who you really are amen so you don't know who you are so there there comes a power and an understanding a power that comes with understanding and positional placing he says for when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God before there well then before he even become material here on the earth before there was anything but God you were one of his attributes you know what your name would be he know the color of hair you would have he knowed all about you he know I'd be placed on this Earth he knows what I would have to sacrifice he knows where I would go he knows who I would influence he knows all about my life amen and he knows whether I believe him or not and if he knows if I believe that he's a god that is amen and in the uh adoption message the first adoption message in 1960 brother man says this the Bible teaching is usually a little treacherous a little you know kind of walking out on thin ice we call it but we just feel that maybe at this point at this time it might be good to kind of bring the church to what I think a complete understanding positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus and sometimes I think that preaching is a wonderful thing but I believe sometimes brother beer that teaching goes beyond that a especially to the church now preaching usually catches The Sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places a man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are amen that's what this message has done for us it is positionally placed us brother brandham said I mean how many times did he come uh to the to the platform he said now I'm not preaching this morning I'm teaching a Sunday school lesson so that we'll get it he's trying to bring the teaching the understanding the positional placing of the Bride so that there's no more scare and toss to around but she can hold steady be an ambassador be an agent for God and understand who she is on this Earth and what God can do through her amen and not be scared and not be nervous and not back down and so that's what the teaching does is positionally placed what a man is and so some of the struggle we have as we we don't really fully realize what we are cuz if we realize what we were what we're here for amen it would be so much easier to sacrifice to give our lives to surrender all to stop trying to save ourselves and preserve our reputation and preserve our life and make it easier for ourselves we would understand I'm here I'm a continuation of the ministry of Jesus Christ and Christ came to give himself for Redemption and salvation and for the work of God I'm here to continue that let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 7 now as I get into some things I just confess to you right up from the from the very beginning I don't really understand always how everything works I have ideas but my ideas are still stuck in a carnal human mind I can't explain to you some things but all I can do is point you to them and tell you that they're real amen 1 Corinthians 7:13 says 1 Corinthians 7:13 and the woman which hath a husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him for the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy see brother Chad explain that to me I can't all I know is it's true amen all I know is that your position in Christ is actually covering for error covering for bad marit covering for your spouse because of who you are not because of who they are for the unbelieving spouse is Sanctified the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife the unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the believing husband why because that believer has faith in a god that is Amen in their position in Christ is covering for a lack in the unbelieving spouse what all does that mean I don't know what does it mean in eternity I don't know I can't explain it I can't understand where how far that goes but I know one thing Amen in the Earthly Journey the believing wife is sanctifying the unbelieving husband why because she's a Believer it's her faith and her love that is doing something for the unbeliever because God works by faith and love Faith and love Faith and love oh praise God I have a million questions on that would that mean salvation would that mean that they can't be seed if they're not seed with I don't know don't ask me those questions I don't know why don't we all just believe God and keep pressing on and understand it truth and let God be a rewarder and find out in the end how good he is and how loving he is how gracious he is how understanding he is amen because those that come to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those who diligently say it's important you have to understand that he's a rewarder or we can't live this life too many hazards too many heartbreaks too many disappointments too much sacrifice we have to know that he's a rewarder in the token message again he says get ready apply it it's talking about the token believe it clean up let your children let your family let your loved ones see it in you that's right it'll take effect yes sir then apply the token in prayer with consideration with believing apply it with such love and so forth till you know it's going to take it's going to take place that's all apply it in confidence believe it's going to help when you talk to that child when you talk to your husband talk to your wife talk to this loved one believe that it's going to help just stand there and say Lord I've claimed them they're mine I'm getting them for you Lord apply it and create that atmosphere around you that they'll just drop right into it why because when you apply the token the tokens is the Life of Christ that creates the atmosphere creat the atmosphere in your home that creates the atmosphere around you that they can come in contact with said oh you are if you got the token you create a spirit around you a power that when you walk people know that you're a Christian they love for you to say something to them listen this atmosphere of the token that he's t talking about this atmosphere of the token must be applied cuz the life of Jesus Christ will clean up your life it'll kick out this and kick out that and cause us to live holy and clean and righteous lives before the people and it'll create an atmosphere around us that they can step into amen and then they know you're a Christian and they love for you to say something to them that means this atmosphere is not arrogant this atmosphere is not boastful this atmosphere is not irritating this atmosphere is not amen it's the atmosphere of Christ the same one the little kids wanted to run up to and he took them up in his arms it's an atmosphere of love an atmosphere of forgiveness an atmosphere of righteousness Holiness sanctity we apply this we believe that it's going to work why because I'm an agent for Jesus Christ I'm here for a reason I have to believe that the life in me is going to work they love for you to say something to them they believe your word what you say they hold on to it that's it apply the token then walk with it claim your household you must do it now this is evening time now you've been listening a long a long time now this is the evening time it's applying time now the Wrath will strike one of these days it might be too late then apply the token with confidence Amen brother M said when you apply the token you have to believe that it's going to work yes like it can't be a mental exercise there's got to be something in you that believes I believe with all of my heart that God can touch my family I believe with all my heart when I request because of who I am because of what he's called me to be because of the life that he's placed on me I believe I'm here for a reason and I believe with all my heart he's going to change the life of my family that's how you have to apply it you have to believe it's going to work you can't just try it and say well I hope that works that's not going to go anywhere it can't be half-hearted it can't be words only it can't be an incantation or a magic spell that we just say and hope that it works it's got to be applied with faith believing that God's a rewarder this is my family God I want them I've applied the token I've obeyed your word I've surrender to you I believe in you and I believe that you're a God that is and I'm standing here in the gap for this one and for that one and for that one would you move on their lives would you touch them would you change their lives this is the way we pray am brother said in the message absolute he's still the same Jehovah God that he always was we like the Apostle Paul can realize the same God lives today yesterday today forever the same then Christians can hold to God's unchanging hand and change the whole situation Prayer Changes Things amen why cuz you're an agent for change amen you're here for a reason to pray Amen to intercede to stand in the Gap Amen to be an ambassador for Christ because the word of reconciliation been given to you remember I want to draw your attention to something brother bam starts in the 60s I can't remember I should have checked the date when he had this experience of going beyond the curtain of time and when he has this experience and man I know it's 1960 or before and and then he comes out and he knows he's got a dog over there and he's got a horse over there and God said to him all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you you will be here is that what he said you know brother Brenham never stopped praying for his children and interceding and imploring God to change their lives that that what the angel of the Lord told him there what that voice told him did not take away his desperation for Souls did not give him a guarantee that would cause lethargy laziness you never saw that in the prophet you never saw him saying well God told me all that ever loved me listen in order for you to understand how that verse is applied you have to know what or not verse that statement you have to know what God means by everybody you love and everybody loves you and I'm not going to try to interpret that because I would have to get into the mind of God and know exactly what God meant with what he said but what whatever God meant is exactly what will happen but brother brandham never took it for granted he never took it for granted that his children would be saved he comes to the end of souls that are in prison now and he's wrestling with the fact that the lamb has taken the book and is Mercy over is there no more chance for mercy and and at the end he saying God don't let it be so it looks very much like it is but God I've got children that aren't saved God saved my Becky God saved Sarah God Sav what's he doing he's still interceding he's still imploring God he's not saying well God's a rewarder if I can have a a horse if I can have a dog I'll have my sons and daughters he never draws that conclusion amen he never he stays in desperation for Souls because love is projecting love is moving him to stand in the gap for his children till he knows that they're secure that's the problem if we preach a Doctrine like this and you preach it too hard one way amen all of the sudden you got all the parents doing nothing for their children interceding applying no token just saying will they all be there anyways amen you don't have a guarant of that you better get on your knees and use your position with God and say God I'm standing in the gap for my son and daughter I know you hear my prayers I know you answer I know you love me and God if you can give me what I want I love them so much would you would you save my son and daughter amen it matters the way we present truth because they asked brother brandham will every child of a Believer be saved sa and he said no when you hear that quote that's from 1964 when you hear that quote you can drop your head and say oh no but then you could see brother Brandon and the token says apply the token it'll take an effect on your children it'll take an effect claim your children claim your family get them under the token apply the token create an atmosphere they'll step into believe that it'll work that next time I talk to them it'll take an effect and then he says will every child of no you know what that should do to you and I it should create desperation if not every child of a Believer will be saved I'm going to stand in the Gap till mine are my children my family my loved ones the ones I care about if God's put me here as an ambassador and I've got the word of reconciliation and I've got the life of Jesus Christ I'm standing in the gap and I'm asking God who's a rewarder and knows how to give good gifts to those that ask I'm asking for my children my wife my loved ones whoever comes on my heart I'm not taking it for granted because desperation moves God desperation moves things and he said Christians can hold to God's unchanging hand and change the whole situation Prayer Changes Things you know what you are as an angent of God you're an agent of change you can change things on this Earth because of who you are you can change circumstances you can change attitudes you can change atmospheres because of who you are praise God Amen remember the life of Joseph Joseph amen was a little boy born for a season amen born for a purpose amen and as a young man he has a vision a series of two visions amen of dreams that he interprets and he tells them that this is going to be the the situation in the future all of you are going to bow down to me I mean that's putting it in shell they didn't like it they got upset they sold him in the slavery so now he's being taken by the moabites and moved on down to slavery and and things get bad for Joseph but the prophecy never changes who Joseph is never changes God's purpose for him never changes and what's inside of him never disappears regardless of the circumstance amen and he moves him from from Palestine from Canaan land down to Egypt and he becomes a slave purchased by Piper the gift in Joseph's life blesses everyone around him because he has the power within him to change things because he's a Son of God Amen he changes the atmosphere in Piper's house yeah he he he brings wealth and prosperity to Piper while he himself is in bondage because he was a Son of God there was an atmosphere around him there was a gift in his life and it was affecting wherever he was our workplaces should be different because we're there Hallelujah yes it should be different cuz we're there amen wherever we associate wherever we go it should be different cuz we're there our apartment complex should be different our neighborhood should be different our our stretch of the road should be the best amen yeah why cuz we're there praise God because a Christian holds the God's unchanging hand and can change the whole situation Prayer Changes Things see the problem is we don't have confidence in who we are yet but God's bringing us there Joseph now in Piper's house blessing potier to the to the point where potier doesn't even have a clue how much is in the bank Joseph set him up on allowance so he can go and have fun with his buddies and he's enjoying it Joseph is managing everything until parer's wife amen put comes up with a scheme and tries to have Joseph Joseph stays in his righteousness amen and he gets falsely accused falsely accused lied about and sent to a dungeon it just got worse for for him but Piper's house was blessed now he goes to the dungeon and guess what happens in the dungeon his presence changes the whole atmosphere in the prison until Piper was the luckiest man in all of Egypt now the Jailer is the luckiest man in all of because his life is a vacation Joseph is taking care of the prison and while he's down there he's interpreting dreams and he's he's serving the gift that is him is giving out giving out giving out giving out he's giving out in Piper's house he's giving out he was giving out in his father's house he's giving out in Piper's house he's giving out in the dungeon why because he's a child of God he can change the atmosphere he's got a power inside of him to change things who he is never changes by his circumstances or the location or the place where he's at can't stop the life that's on the inside of Joseph and so we have the story with the Butler and the Baker and then there's a promise and a betrayal of promise and a betrayal of trust because now whoever it was that was restored forgot all about Joseph he's left in the prison but you know what he is he's an agent wherever he goes it's good it's blessed it's better he's not better everything else is better remember brother brother brandham standing in the pull pit so weak he has to grip the pull pit to stand on his feet so sick he can't hardly stand but everybody coming through lines getting healed because the gift was to go out amen not for him and Joseph's gift was was changing circumstances all around him but his circumstance was getting worse listen we're not on this Earth for ourselves we're here as ambassadors agents for change amen but God is a rewarder and God never forgot where Joseph was and what Joseph went through and what Joseph sacrificed and who Joseph loved because at the end of the story he gets taken right to the place that he was destined to go to the right hand of pharaoh and what does God give him he gives him his whole family back god listen sometimes we just don't know who we are we have to recognize who we are let's go to John chapter 15 let's just read a couple more scriptures as we wind down here John chapter 15: 16 says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you that's a promise yes I need to ask I have the power to change situations because he promised me verse 23 uh chapter 16 sorry chapter 16 verse 23 in chapter 16: 23 he says and in that day he shall ask me nothing verily verily I say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give it you hither to have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full anden when you ask to receive that your joy may be full you have to actually believe you're going to receive what you ask if you don't believe what you're going to receive what you ask then don't start asking don't start asking till you start believing and when you believe apply the token in prayer and believe that God I'm here serving your purpose I believe you with all of my heart I've surrendered to your word and I've given up everything to follow after you and you promised even the disciples if they give up houses and lands and homes and spouses and children that you'll give back to them in this life and the life to come and God I have sacrificed for you God would you hear my request and save my friend save my child work in my life praise God we have the power to make changes and let's go to James chapter 5 now James chapter 5 James chapter 5:1 16 he said confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much this isn't lazy prayer this isn't half-hearted prayer this is the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much we have to know who we are and then we have to go to labor in prayer to move things we have to believe that our prayer will move things we have to believe that the life inside of us we can project back to God and we can have what we request and we have to labor we have to we have to believe we have to stand on the promise and move things on earth amen by believing the word of God and the message the token I'm going back to the Token he says what does he do then when you you can present the token with your prayer it shows that you are fully come to obedience to the whole word of God when you've got the token it shows that you have obeyed every word then you and the word are one you're only asking for the thing that you are amen God Amen this this is understanding our position I I I'm just here I'm as a partner with you God but as a partner you said you have no eyes but my eyes no ears but my ears no mouth but my mouth when you told the disciples look onto the Harvest see that is a need pray to the Lord of the Harvest to sin and meet the need well if he has no eyes but mine no ears but mine no mouth but mine who's supposed to see the need who's supposed to hear the need then who's supposed to ask for the need to be met that's my job as an agent on the earth I have to see the need I have to hear the need then I have to ask the lord of the Harvest would you please come and meet this need Hallelujah he's he's got to have somebody on the earth as the ACT an agent to move heaven to change things on earth amen you're you're only asking for the thing that you are if you say this hand you obey me reach out for that handkerchief now brother R's going to give us some good instruction here reach out for that handkerchief it does it see hand obey me why it's part of me then when you and the word becomes one every promise glory to God every promise is yours it obeys you then you want to watch what you want to do now he's going to give us a word of caution because of the power that's inherent here he said you wouldn't put your hand in a fire just to say see me do it oh no no see but if there is something in that fire I got to reach for it'll obey me amen see that's right see you want to watch what you're doing that's the reason the Holy Spirit listen that's the reason the Holy Spirit sparingly give out and things you know what I mean CU you don't a real servant of God don't show off with it you see that's making a show this isn't about making show I did this and I prayed and they moved and this that's not it at all it's understanding who you are and saying God you said if we'll see if we'll ask if we'll and intercede and God I'm coming to the position you put me in an earth you need an agent I'm willing to be that agent amen and I'm asking that you change this circumstance you heal my neighbor you heal my friend you heal my mother you heal my father you open their eyes because you need somebody to ask and I'll be that somebody to ask amen let's go to acts 27 I preached on this once several years ago I used this example but I want to bring it fresh to your mind and memory again because it's such a powerful example of what I'm trying to say in Acts chapter 27 Paul and his Shipmates are on a journey he's a prisoner on a prison ship uh going to Rome but they're in a storm and the storm has lasted a long time and they Des sparing of life and throwing out the tackle the light in the ship and they're having all kinds of trouble but Paul's on the boat all kinds of issues all kinds of trouble but there's a Son of God on the boat and let's look at uh verse 20 and when neither son nor stars and many days appeared and no small Tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away there wasn't a hope that they were going to make it the only hope was an agent amen praise God Amen it says now verse 21 but after a long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said s you should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from CRE and to have gained this harm and LA and now I exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am and whom I serve saying fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar and lo God hath given thee all them that sail with thee wherefore sir be of good cheer for I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me Hallelujah he never required they believe God but he said you be of good cheer because I believe God and I believe because of faith faith will bring this to pass and because I believe God there'll be no loss of life only of the ship don't worry I believe praise God it says now listen the the angel of the Lord said Don't Fear because th have to go to Caesar the Apostle Paul already knew he was going to stand before Caesar God had already told him when he was arrested early on in his arrest that he had to go to appear before Caesar so he was on this journey to go to appear before Caesar the Apostle Paul believed the word of God he knew the prophecy was true if he was going to go see Caesar he was going to go see Caesar regardless of what happened to the ship but he was away in a long abstinence the Bible says he was hidden away where was he I'll tell you what I believe amen this is me I believe he was praying a prayer of intercession for everybody else on that boat because look at the answer he got don't be any fear for surely you're going to go to see Caesar but I have given you all the souls that are on this ship who did he give them to he gave him to an agent that was on the earth standing in the Gap a Son of God that was going to go to Caesar anyways he had no doubt he was going to go to Caesar so what's he need he he's saying God what about all these Souls on this boat what about all of these lives and he says I've given them to you [Music] hallelujah amen what would have happened to that ship if Paul wasn't on that ship what would happened to those lives if Paul hadn't interceded for those lives and what would happen to all the people around us if there's not an agent on earth right in their midst in your workplace and in your family am mean they may not be seen they may never be able to receive the message but my can you bring healing to their life amen can you bring comfort and peace to them can they be preserved in time of sickness all of these people on this boat most of them were prisoners I doubt all of them were C Gene of God Amen but their life was saved from that shipwreck because there was somebody standing in the gap for them 200 and something Souls amen praise be to God thank you Jesus if GE if brother brandham healed more people than just the elect and I believe Jesus healed more people than just the elect what should we be doing on this Earth if people can't find help from you and I where are they going to find it if they can't have an advocate in you and I who will advocate for them if somebody if we won't stand in the Gap who will what does it mean it means we have to give and give again in amen and give some more amen and engage in love and sacrifice amen and give even when your act of Love isn't received In Love sometimes it's received in hostility or misunderstanding or mocking but it doesn't matter God loved anyways somebody's got to stand in the Gap somebody's got to be an Agent of Change Jesus Christ must be on Earth again in the form of his bride in the message expectation brother V said prayer is the key that's the answer Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in control of human beings there's no atomic bomb or no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of God amen amen I I listen I don't want to get so locked down Amen in in predestination that we don't realize that part of God's predestinated plan is to have people on the Earth that will intercede for others and change things on the earth and be amateur Gods on this Earth agents of God that can affect the change around them because of who they are and who's living on the inside of them too many times with an understanding that God listen and it's the absolute truth we understand that God knew every Gat that would fly on this Earth and and how many times it would bat its wings and how much Tallow it would generate that's the absolute truth but he also knew how much trouble and struggle would be on this earth and the heartache that sin would cause and he also knew who would be his agents and what they would do to represent him on the Earth We're his representation amen we're here for healing and for life and for changes not to sit on our Lazy Boy and then our sofa is saying oh it's all worked out already yeah it's all worked out in the mind of all already the mind of God has little Gods on this Earth that are making changes little gods that are taking Dominion amateur Gods little messes that are here affecting the lives of the people around them that are loving so that he can move amen that are projecting love so Grace can take its place he knew he'd have an army of messes praise God Amen who would stand in the Gap who would give again who would be rejected and spit upon and ridicule but not ridicule back not spit back amen that's why he said you pray to the Lord of the Harvest you pray yeah I mean can you imag sitting there well you're the lord of the Harvest you already know what do I need to pray for you pray do to the lord of the Harvest prise god let's turn to John 17 thank you how many of you believe that Jesus would L by Vision oh yes amen you know brother B dramatizes things for us to bring it into perspective so that we understand said the vision led him to the pool of Bethesda one day where they were sick and INF and infirmed all around the pool of Bethesda they were waiting it was the season where the angel would come down and Trouble the waters and the first one in would be healed so there was a great mob there with anticipation because they all wanted to be healed but God led by vision and God LED Jesus to one man so he had to step around and step over and walk through a crowd of sick to go and heal one person and when he healed that person he didn't even really pray for them he said would you be well yeah take up your bed and walk am yeah brother bam said and and when you have a vision you don't even need to pray it's finished just declare it but if you watch the gospels Jesus was all the time praying he was praying Jesus who was godm made flesh who knowed all things was led by Vision he was asking God for things not just saying well I'll just wait here for God give me a vision when I get Vision I'll go and do it but he was an example to you and I he was the god man and when he was on Earth you know what he was doing he was interceding he was praying he was asking the father to do things John 17:8 is one of those he says 17:8 he says for I have given unto them The Words which thou gavest me he's praying to God and they have received them and have known surely that I come from thee and they have believed that thou did send me I pray for them amen I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name those which thou Hast given me that they may be one as we are one listen Jesus knows all things right and he knows God has put all things in his hand but Jesus doesn't sit back and say the father's got it all figured out before time all have to do is go through the motion no Jesus is saying father would you keep them I love them what what is moving Jesus to pray this prayer because of his love for his disciples is causing him to stand in the gap between him and the father and saying father would you keep them through thy love keep them Lord I'm leaving but they have to stay would you keep them what is moving him faith and love praise God let's look at verse 24 now he said father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou Hast given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world what's he praying for he's saying God I want these disciples to be with me I want them to be my reward I want them I want these to be with me he's asking the father father for their for them to be with him wherever he is Luke 22 let's turn that let's turn there real quick Luke chapter 22 see friends this isn't taking something for granted this isn't just letting whatever happens happens this is understanding who we are and why we're here and what life is in us and what power resides in us and what promises have been given to us and if God has put his life in me and God has promised that he'll hear my prayer and God has told me to ask in in his name so that my joy might be full then when I see and I hear and I love and I want why can't I go into intercession and say God would you just save my brother save my sister save my mom save my dad heal my coworker would you help us in our company Lord I know all of these people and they've got kids they're supporting if we lose this contract amen there's going to be suffering God would you help us to win this contract for the sake of all my friends remember wherever Joseph was he affected everything around him our lives should have an effect Amen on the places we work the places we go the associations we're in Luke 22 verse 31 and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee Hallelujah that thy faith fail not and when th are converted strengthen the Brethren I can't tell you what that scripture does to me right now Jesus didn't say Peter you're going to be sifted by wheat but I've already seen it in a vision don't worry you got it you got this no Satan is desired to sift You by weat but I have prayed for you that your faith fail not if Jesus didn't take these things for granted should we if he injected himself into the situation and he stood in the Gap and he asked the fathers to preserve his disciples shouldn't we if he asked God to keep Peter's Faith from failing shouldn't we we shouldn't sit back and say well it's all going to be what it's going to be no no no it's going to be whatever we make it because that's the way God ordained it because God put us here to make changes God put us here to affect change to bring change to do to make things go in a different direction that's how God does it that's how he foresaw it he foresaw it because he had sons and daughters on the earth just like Joseph was there amen just like Abraham was there just like Paul was on that ship and you and I are here amen amen now I don't suggest you go to work Monday and say I'm here they may never fully comprehend in their lives what you being there means for them but someday they might find out just how critical it was and I don't want to miss my opport opportunity now brother R's going to say a statement and this statement is going to seemingly contradict the statement he just made that we just read he says 1960 from that time but I'll tell you a little secret the most powerful force in the world isn't speaking with tongues or interpreting tongues or being honored by God to be a minister or to be an evangelist or to be a prophet the most powerful weapon that I've ever found in my life is love am what was the contradictory statement because before he said the most powerful weapon that's ever put in the hands of man is prayer but what motivates prayer is love and when you take Faith and love and you put it together in prayer that changes [Applause] things why are we who we are and why are we where we are maybe to bring a change we've quoted this several times but I'm just going to read to you out of 1 John 4 beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love let's go to Galatians 5 and I'm going to end with this verse in Galatians 5 it'll be our last verse we read Galatians 5 and 6 Galatians 5 and 6 for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love how does faith work by love what availeth much faith that worketh by love brother Ben said in desperations he said I believe that the reason we don't have desperation is because it's a lack of love God the love of God when we take the attitude uh all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you will be there no desperation but said that actually shows a lack of love but because brother B loved his children after he heard a declaration like that in the sixth Dimension after he loved his children he's saying oh God in desperation oh God save my Becky save my Sarah save little Joseph Lord I want to see them filled with the Holy Ghost God please don't let me lose my children what's he doing what's causing desperation love amen because of love he has desperation he can't stand the thought of them not being there he can't stand the thought of them not being save not loving the Lord not serving God so he as a father as a Son of God Is Standing There imploring God God saved my Becky God saved my Sarah God saved Joseph oh my how can we sit idly by as the world is Fading Into ruin and say well whoever's supposed to be there but no I'm here to infect the change amen God change the situation around me change the situation with that person and that person and that person cuz you've put me here for a reason and you told me to ask that my joy might be full and now I'm coming to you with my token saying God save my Becky save my Joseph why cuz love brings desperation Jesus when he was going to Calvary the last moments on Earth just before he goes to Calvary he's saying father keep them I'm leaving them keep them do you think Jesus doubted God's ability to keep them what was being expressed in his cry his love the reason we don't have desperation because it's a lack of love the love of God I think that the love of God causes desperation if God is in you the token inside of you and you see the condition of the times and the people waiting in sin the way they are it will throw you into desperation I believe it will now the world the word plainly states if if you want to put it down as Galatians 5:6 is what we just read Faith worketh by love see Faith worketh by love and the only way that you can have faith is to have love first because after all faith is Love's incentive incentive that's exactly what faith is it's an incentive to love now if you don't have love you can't have Faith how did God save hady r two boys by faith and love when they came together how did he save all those people on the ship with Paul faith and love how did he save Fritz and Prince faith and love how did he save Lot Faith and love amen how did he save rahab's Family Faith and love and how will he save the ones we love Faith and love they work together and as they work together they create desperation because we know that prayer changes things we know we can intercede we know we have the ministry of reconciliation we know where Christ is we know we have the token we know we have an access to God we know we can ask for whatsoever we want and it'll be given to us we know that he hears our prayer that puts us in desperation because we know we can ask we know we can pray and we love and believe and when those two come together it brings a desperation in us to stand in the Gap to intercede to love I just want to leave you with this thought and please don't ever believe on I'm drawing conclusions don't go farther than what the prophet did with these things cuz sometimes I don't know how to extrapolate these thoughts out I only know that they're true the only reason the sixth Dimension contains a horse named prince and a dog named frce is because a Son of God loved them it's the only reason they're there as far as my understanding is I can learn more tomorrow I may be wrong from the way I see it the only reason that there's a horse named prince and a dog dog not just a dog a dog named Fritz in the sixth Dimension is because a Son of God loved them I don't know what all that means in in all ways that that applies and how to extrapolate that I don't know but I do know one thing I'm a Son of God and I love and I believe he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him I don't know how to sort it all out I don't know how I don't know what but I know this if prayer can change things I'm going to pray amen and if I have the token and it must be presented with my prayer then I'm going to present my token and I'm going to pray and if I can intercede I'm going to intercede if I have the ministry of reconciliation I'm going to practice the ministry of reconciliation I don't know how everything will work out but I know who I am I don't know how God will sort it all out but I know who I am and I know I know one thing's for sure if I can be his agent and sacrifice my life and give myself to him and do what he's called me to do I know beyond a shadow of doubt that I believe he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him I know that for a fact can't tell you what it all looks like for sure and how it will all be meet out but I know it'll be meet out perfectly and I know one thing when brother bandam got to the sixth Dimension he was pleasantly surprised and I just pray that someday I'm pleasantly surprised and you're pleasantly surprised because faith and love work together to bring a change man let's all stand together there's so many things that we see in the scripture and that we see in the message that are so absolutely profound I don't know how to sort them out intellectually I don't know how to categorize them I don't but when you see the potential it moves you into desperation if you can do that for Paul you can do that for me if you can do that for Rahab you can do that for me if you can do that for Abraham you can do that for me and it moves us into desperation saying God I've seen you do it you can do it if you can do that for brother bam you can do it for me God do it for me amen and we must believe we must believe that he hears our prayer and we must believe that'll answer our prayer because of who we are because it's faith that moves things man God bless you all I I hope I pray that God will take what's I've done my best to present and he puts it together the right way I pray that he sorts it all out because it can leave a lot of holes and gaps and understanding because I have holes and gaps and understanding but I pray that God comes and starts to line it up and show you that in you and around your life is potential for change that you're an agent for Change and that God's put you here for that Amen to affect change to pray to intercede to move things around you for the grace of God Amen God bless you let's just bow our heads together and pray de heavenly father I thank you God God as you continually taking the veil off of who we really are God it comes off layer by layer Lord there's been so much darkness in our mind minds and in our lives because of lies because of natural things because of environment and education and our upbringing but God you're taking your word and you're peeling away layer upon layer to show us who we really are God we're not great because we're great people we're not anything in the flesh because we're just common flesh human beings it's not the flesh we're talking about that has to be changed but God way down in our souls you've planted a seed before the foundation of the world and that seed is our true identity who we really are and Lord by your grace you've brought that seed to Life by the washing of the water the word and the outpouring of your Holy Spirit you've quickened that seed to life and that life is taking over our life and you from the inside growing out God now we realize that what we saw in the mirror wasn't all there was to the story what was on our birth record wasn't all of our history but God you've put us here for a season and for a purpose you've poured your life into ours so that we can be your agents on this Earth you showed it through Paul through Peter and through James through John we saw in Abraham Lord we saw it in Jacob we saw it in Rahab we saw it in all of these how you change circumstances we saw in Daniel when he prayed it moved Heaven God if you've called us in the same line that you've called them then the same power resides within us Lord to change things to bring about your purpose on this Earth to see that things move in accordance with your word God you've put people in our lives and you've given us love for them your love not just a human emotion but something deeper than that because you want us to bring the change you want us to pray the prayer you want us to live the life you want us to intercede you want us to stand in the Gap God help us not to miss our opportunities and to understand what a power you've placed in our hands Lord your Prophet told us the most powerful weapon ever placed in the hand of man is prayer prayer changes thing it even changes the mind of God lord I can't fully qualify that statement and understand it but it's true it changes things then he come and told us the most powerful weapon that he knows of his love so God may we take these two powers and merge them together that we can have faith and love and prayer to be a dynamic power powerful force that you've put in our hands and put in our mouth and may we use it for your glory may we use it for the benefit of those around us God help us to stay desperate by having genuine love and Lord help us to stay confident because of your placing May that confidence Lord be in what you have done and what you have said not any Earthly fleshly thing that we have but just the position youve put us in may we be confident that we're your children confident we're your bride and confident you placed Us in this Earth at such a time as this to be agents and bassadors for you and God May that confidence build faith that when we request when we see when we hear when we request that you'll move for faith is what moves the mountains God we're trusting in you and asking God that you would just help us to stay out of the way our own flesh our own carnality God we get tired we suffer rejection we get heartbroken God we want to run away sometimes sometimes we want to break sometimes we want to serve ourselves but God help us to recognize that you're a rewarder of those that diligently seek you that our rewards will come later Lord may we stay engaged keep us forgiving surrendered sacrificing the same way you lived on this Earth may we live on this Earth God I pray that you would help us to be your ambassadors help us to be better ambassadors than we've ever been help us to move more circumstances than we've ever moved help us to exercise the authority and the power you've placed in our hands help us to exercise it more than we have in the past and help us to do so with faith knowing god God that you've called us to this purpose finish your work through our flesh give us Lord the understanding of how to move and how to react and how to pray that we might be vessels that you can use for this end time mission for this last day's work we surrender to you aresh we love you Lord we ask God that you would use our mouth use our eyes use our hands use our feet use us Lord as we go I pray that you would bless us as we part may we go from here having been changed by degrees with a fresh vision and a clearer understanding Lord as we move to the fellowship Lord I pray that you bless our fellowship may we encourage one another as we ruminate on the things that you've given to us may you bless the meal and the hands that prepared and all that labored to make it happen bless them Lord and bless us as we share in time and love for one another may we leave your encouraged ready to go back and face the world as agents for change we love you God we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you brother Ben no one to do thy will oh Lord I want to do do thy will oh Lord take me break me m me and make me I want to do I will oh Lord oh I want to do thy will oh Lord oh I want to do thy will oh Lord take me break me mold me and make I want to do I will oh oh one more time oh I want to do I will oh Lord [Music] oh I want to do th oh oh oh take me break me mourn me and make me I want to do thy will oh [Music]
