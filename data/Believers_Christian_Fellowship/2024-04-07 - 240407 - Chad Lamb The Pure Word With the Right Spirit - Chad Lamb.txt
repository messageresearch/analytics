it's your grace in our lives and God we're so privileged just to be standing here amongst the Saints with your children Lord just we're we're thankful to be included in the number Lord that you've allowed us this opportunity and God may we just pour our hearts completely out to you and surrender to you greater than we ever have before May our Thanksgiving for your mercy and Grace be a life dedicated back to you God we come Lord to hear your word we pray God that you would speak to us we know the mechanism you've chose for the foolishness of preaching Lord and we recognize that and we surrender to it we ask now you would come and operate according to your word and that you would take this vessel of clay and that you would move the man out of the way and that you would come down by the power of your Holy Spirit and Minister your word to your children and Lord that you would give us ears to hear eyes to see and a heart to perceive all that you have and God may we just give you the preeminence Lord as you come and feed need your sheep we love you Lord we want to glorify your name and Lord we want to grow into your very likeness help us Lord God give us the Sheep food that we need give us the rain and the water that we need from your word and your spirit to bring us into your very image in this end time for that's our desire and I know it's your desire cuz it's your word and God we're yielding to that in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all amen while we're standing why we take our Bibles and go to third John the third Epistle of John I just want to welcome all our visitors I know we've got several visitors and we're glad to have you I know the simonsons were coming so it was good to have Jordan and Rebecca again and I know different ones have traveled from different areas we want to say God bless you it's very good to have you here with us also want to say it's really good to have sister Joyce God bless you Sister Joyce amen God's been really good to her and it's good to have her here with us amen it's exciting that makes it a special service already amen also want to remind you that today will be communion and feet washing so we'll meet back here in the afternoon for that and also I heard it's brother Mike Bower's birthday is that right brother happy birthday brother Mike God bless you amen May the Lord's blessings be on you amen happy birthday praise the Lord God is good let's read here in uh third John chapter 1 thirr John chapter 1 and I'd like to read verse three and four for I rejoiced greatly when the Brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children Walk In Truth amen God bless you as you take your seats uh also wanted to make an announcement on behalf of the trustees the the trustees have decided that because of the eclipse coming tomorrow that they're going to rope off the the front of the property down through the front of the property and across the driveway because uh if you notice we got this giant parking lot in the back of the church that is open to I75 and we just don't want anybody driving by thinking that looks like a good place and and then uh and and so we don't know you just have no idea and rather than dealing with the liability that comes with that they've decided just the Rope it off so all that being the case we're all asking that nobody else come up here to to view the eclipse tomorrow because one car attracts two cars attracts three and then it becomes an attraction so we're going to try to keep the parking lot empty and keep that roped off so they'll they'll finish roping that off after the second service and uh and that way we don't have any issues not that we know that we would but it's a good way to eliminate the possibility we have no idea how many people are coming to the area there's been all kinds of numbers thrown out upwards of 100,000 and and I was thinking don't they know that it gets cloudy in April and I mean we hardly ever have the sunshine in the spring but amen God is good hopefully that we have a an opportunity to view it they say it's a once-in-a-lifetime event and it's quite remarkable to see so we thank God that hey we don't have to go anywhere it's easy for us so it comes right our way so that's good and I I was going to speak on the eclipse for just a minute because I get asked a lot of questions anytime there's a an event like this there's always questions and always speculation and and and I had different ones mentioned things to me and I hadn't really paid close attention to it so I got on the internet and looked and I was blown away there's video clips and pictures and the Earth is exploding and mushroom clouds and all this other stuff and I thought oh my goodness there's clickbait all over the place trying to get people just to click click click click click amen but I thank God God's given us a word amen and we can stay focused on the word of God and stay focused on the message and uh and I want to uh just speak about astronomical events for just a minute because we know that brother brandham said he declares in the heaven first before he does it on Earth and me so we know that that's absolutely true the problem is there's no Prophet here to tell us this equals that that's where that's where we get into trouble and that's where speculation becomes I think really really dangerous but but just in reference to this so we see the truth of it I went back to 1962 to the beginning of 1962 and brother brandham he lays out a pattern and it's so marvelous he comes in January uh of 1962 and we know 1962 is a pivotal year for the prophet because he's going to preach in the spring spoken word is the Original Seed then he's going to come into a present stage of my Ministry at the end of 62 he's going to have the series of six visions that are given to him plus he's going to have the tearing out of his gate knowing to go west and all of that's going to bring bring him into 63 where there's the visitation of the Angels first The Sword in the hand and so it's a pivotal time and and there's also something happening in the heavens and he says this here he says as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man it's evening time where is God if God is with us where is the Miracles Hebrews 138 said Jesus Christ is same yesterday today and forever then he goes into the prayer he said let us bow our heads Heavenly Father such a wonderful group of people to speak to and may I never get this privilege again I may never be here again oh God we may never see morning come science is trying to tell us that these five stars going to fall together that's why they say all the world and Nations they're froze up on this side of the Earth the continent here's Phoenix with pouring rains and weathers that they're never seen they claim that five stars are moving together out yonder some says the world will burst like a watermelon we don't believe that Lord there's there's to be a millennium yet but some says there'll be earthquakes that'll Shake That houses all over some of them says the great tidal waves will go 300 ft in the air in the next few days the worlds are trembling there's there'll be fearful signs you said in the last days sights signs in the heaven and in the earth fire Vapor pillars of smoke earthquakes in diverse places perplexity of time distress between nations man's heart failing for fear but that time Lord you said lift up your head your Redemption draw us nine so brother B's looking at this uh there's a a lot of news let's say in his day about these alignment he says five stars here but later he says it's alignment of five planets and he refers to a couple scriptures and let's look at those together Luke 21 if we could turn to that Luke 21 and I'm going to read verse 10 and 11 Luke 21:10 then said he unto them Nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and great earthquakes shall be in diverse places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and Great Signs shall there be from Heaven let's go down to verse 25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and the Moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's heart failing them for fear and for the looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with great power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh amen for us there's not perplexity and fear amen there's a great anticipation because we know amen we know the day that we're living in we know because the word has been fulfilled now brother that was January we just read January 24th of 62 now we come to February 4th in the message communion he says we see that the astronomers are predicting something in this early part of the first part of the month beginning on the 2nd or the 5ifth or somewhere along this month the Indian astronomers predict the world to blow to pieces and the American newspapers make fun of it I do not believe the world's going to blow to Pieces but I do say it's wrong to make fun of it because something's fixing to happen one of these days something similar to that when these five planets when these five plants Mars Jupiter Venus and so forth come into their they never had did it oh they claimed maybe 25,000 years ago but who was back there now to know it I pr predict that this has a spiritual application I believe it's the coming in of the issue of God that the great Revelations of the world will be open during the word will be open during this time remember they claim it was three stars that came into their orbits when Jesus was born and this is five and five is Grace the number of Grace Three is the number Perfection five is the number of Grace so brother RS looking at this coming in January and February of this year of the year and and we know that the Stars according to Genesis 1 account the stars were given for signs and for seasons and days and for years and brother M told us the first Bible was written in the heavens and so then he comes down he preaches uh uh spoken word is the Original Seed and then the next message he preaches is the end time sign seed and in that message he says three is the number of perfection we all know that three is God's number in his numerology God is known by his numbers three is perfection seven is worship 24 is worship 40 is Temptation 50 is Pentecost Jubilee and so forth all of his numbers and numerals of God is perfected is imperfection now three is his number Perfection and he says now listen now uh listen now close when the little baby Christ was born three stars went together and made the one star that reflecting the coming of an infant Christ a perfect one now what's happened we see a roar in the paper across the television out across the Nations where five stars just fell in line with the world what's five a number of Grace every time those stars come then something happens on the earth what taking place five stars fell in what is it an introduction of what say siten just look what's taking place Germany almost washed off the map some of the Magi said that the world would burst like a watermelon every distressful thing prophesied by them for the last day days look what's taking place England the other day had a storm that blowed away 70,000 houses one day disasters California Los Angels like to wash into the ocean what is it beginning of Sorrows earthquakes has picked up everywhere what is it five stars come in line God's grace what happened an infant Church a bride infancy that the power of God has begin to fall on her she's taken form him a bride for his bridegroom that three stars meant his Perfection of the heavenly father a trinity coming in one on the earth Among Us God's office is becoming one office what happened now it's the Church of the Living God coming together under the word of God and the astronomic heaven is announcing her approach amen praise God you know if there wasn't a prophet standing on Earth there's no way we could have come to that conclusion we could have speculated and guessed but but by the grace of God he had a prophet here who could say this is that and I'm so thankful because we can to look at it and say this is that amen but but the issue now is without that Prophet on the scene who has the authority to say this means that everybody's trying and and every denominational Prophet has a prophecy concerning uh uh what's happening amen and and brother B said I don't believe they should make fun of it because it means something so I say the same thing it means something but what does it mean I don't know I don't know what it means neither do I want to speculate let's go to Jeremiah chapter 10 Jeremiah chapter 10 verse 1 Jeremiah 10:1 hear ye the word which the Lord spake speaketh unto you oh House of Israel thus sayith the Lord learn not the way of the Heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of Heaven for the Heathen are dismayed at them so these aren't to dismay us trouble us or worry us nothing's changed in God yeah his time piece ticks on it doesn't take him by surprise he knows exactly what it means cuz he wrote The Heavens to begin with and they declare his glory amen and he knows what he's doing amen but you know what we don't need to know amen we don't need to know cuz everything we need to know has been given to us in the message everything now I'll ask you a question you can say well brother Brandon pointed to five stars a line and he showed when Jesus came three stars a line now five stars a line and that meant the brides coming forth I and I thank God for that Revelation I'm glad a prophet could point to that it's so exciting and so encouraging but here's the thing if the prophet never pointed that out and you never knew that would that have changed anything it would have changed nothing the bride would have still come forth the message would have still open he would have still called his bride together you would still believe the message nothing would have changed whether you knew that or didn't know that if you if you never knew what those five planets meant it would change nothing in the program of God and the reality is we don't need to know God has come and opened his word and given us the Revelation out of the word that we need and we everything we need's been given to us in the message and so we need to go guard against some of this uh making speculations and things like that and and I can say that because I've been guilty of doing it so many times like I've I I hope that I've learned my lesson by now because I've fallen prey to this trap several times things are happening you search it out and then you run the numbers and then you run the dates and then you piece this together and brother Brenham said that and at the end of it all what does it mean anyways amen at the end of it all what was the conclusion I remember I I just was reflecting and and thinking I remember about 20 years ago uh there was an alignment of seven planets I don't know if everybody remembers that and it was preached on and many people preached on the alignment of seven planets and the seven planets lined up and it's been about 20 years ago and nobody knew what it meant but there was all kinds of inferences it it could be and maybe this and it shows the end of the seven Church ages and but when it was all said and done it's been 20 years since and what did it actually mean am I I still don't know remember I remember when uh the the Gulf War was going on and and and and uh the war out of Baghdad and Saddam Hussein and he believed he was a descendant of uh of Nebuchadnezzar and he was going to restore the old Babylonian Kingdom and all of a sudden all kinds of things went out that this is the end they're going to march across the Euphrates this is the resurrection of Babylon and and it was being preached and I don't fault anybody cuz I would have done the same thing like I it looks so much like this is that and scriptures were being attached to it and here we are 30 years or so later or 20 some years later what did it actually mean what did it actually mean I don't know did it have sign significance yes is it affecting things yet today yes is it all working in the end time sequence yes does it have to do at the end times absolutely yes but what specifically doesn't mean and one of the reasons that I wanted to share this because I I'm just hoping that that that we can mature I'm hoping that I can mature I don't know if you remember several years ago we had a series of four blood moons and the four blood moons fell on Jewish holidays and I come and preached a sermon on it and showed the dates and all that and tied it all together and I and I was so sure it meant something big was coming and I do believe something big was coming I believe it meant something but what did it actually mean here we are four or five years later what was it and I have to say I don't know but I still believe it was something important I still believe it had something to do with the Earth it probably had something to do with the Jews it had to do with Redemption it had to do with the end times it had to do with the sequence of events the wrapping up I believe all of that but I cannot say it was this particular event or it meant this or this was because of that the prophet of God could do it if he was here amen and God would give him the Revelation he would be able to come and say this means that and it would be absolutely spot-on correct but I can't do that and so I I to this day I regret coming and preaching that not that I preached anything false but what I did was I built an anticipation and we were looking and projecting and and something big but in the end it just it it Fizzles it's like lighting a firecracker and you see the sizzle go down and go down and go down and you're waiting for the boom and where's the boom and so some of these lessons we have to learn and some of these lessons I have to learn and and I just I just I feel sorry for you all I'm sorry that you have to endure my training I don't know how else to come to maturity and have experience without having experiences and making mist mes I don't know how to do it so I'm really sorry but you guys are wonderful people you've been good to me even through it all God bless you we love you but we have to grow up together and we have to we have to stop chasing after different things and and speculating and here's the real issue that I that I have I take with speculation and and I wrote it down so I wouldn't forget what I was looking at when when we declare this is that this event equals this thing in scripture or this this thing happening the problem is is when we do that and we begin to believe that I now believe that this event equals this scripture so that's fine as long as that's correct but if that proves to be incorrect but God has a different fulfillment of that scripture or that something brother brandham said then what I've done is my speculation will attach me or somebody else to this event as the Fulfillment when actually this event is the Fulfillment and when this event comes I won't believe it therefore my speculation led to unbelief amen because when God does bring it to pass and it is God now I don't believe it because I've already accepted something else as being the Fulfillment let's take for example the coming of Elijah the prophet in Malachi 4 how many of you believe that You' you've witnessed the coming of Malachi of Elijah the prophet of Malachi he'll come before the great and Dre day of the Lord and turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and fathers to the children and we believe that was fulfilled in the ministry of brother brandham and because of that I cannot believe in any other fulfillment of that scripture No matter how many people come along and no matter what they do I can't believe in that because I already believe it's fulfilled amen how many believes you've heard the voice of the seventh angel so we already believe that so now I can't believe it in any other way because I already believe it and because it's the truth and been Vindicated by God we're protected against believing false because we received the truth but the problem is if I start making speculations and guessing on different things then I'll take my guess and attach it to a scripture or something brother Brenham said and if I move belief and Faith over to this and it's not actually the Fulfillment my speculation will actually lead to unbelief when the Fulfillment comes so it's actually a lot more dangerous than I I used to realize I thought it was kind of harmless we could just throw stuff out and speculate and and we still love talking about things and talking about the word and and we look at modern events and current events and We Know It All ties into the plan of God but speculation is not as innocent as I used to think it was it has a very uh dangerous side to it and so is there war in Europe yes is Russia fighting Ukraine yes what does it mean I don't know yeah does it mean we're in the end times well of course but we already knew that that's right like what does it tell me that I didn't already know maybe the maybe the maybe the the darkening of the sun is a sign of judgment maybe that the the the eclipse is a sign of judg it's a second one in a cycle of two that crossed the nation and made an X right over the middle of the nation and maybe that's where the bomb's going to fall and maybe it's the destruction of the of the US but the reality is I didn't need to know that cuz a prophet already told me the US will be destroyed by a nuclear bomb and he already said it'll be ashes and crater and debris from coast to coast so it I don't need to interpret this sign because a prophet already told me America's going to be destroyed so whether this means that or not it's inconsequential because we've already been told everything we need to know in the message am so we just need to stick with the message stick with the message and I'm probably the guiltiest Among Us of trying to tie things together and figure out current events and what this means and what is you know when Russia went to Ukraine was that Russia going after the oil maybe maybe not I don't know this war now in Israel Israel's in war and does that mean this and is it tied to this scripture maybe maybe not when they went into Gaza the first time uh back in 2015 not the first time but 2014 or 15 I thought that was it this is it it's all started and here we are how many years later right when they went and took Jerusalem Amen in the in the yam kapore war or 1967 war whatever that was when they went and took Jerusalem now Israel's back in Jerusalem it's all over that was 19 1967 you see all of these things they all mean something and they all have to do with the end times and all has to do with God moving his plan along amen but how in the world are we going to interpret that without a prophet on the scene how are we going to say this is that and if we do say this is that and we may not have the boldness to say this is that but we'll say it kind of looks like this is that and I'm thinking it could be this way but if we get somebody's mind WRA around that look at how dangerous that is we may be able to jump out of that later and say no that wasn't it but what if we persuaded somebody else to believe that that's why I'm sorrier than ever that I've ever went down that path I said God forgive me and God help me how many you remember about two years ago Venus and Jupiter had a convergence the closest they've come in tens of thousands of years and where did they converge they converged in the sign of Virgo the Virgin right where her w would be the sign of ver Virgo the Virgin you have Venus the Queen the Queen of Heaven and Jupiter the king Planet came together in Virgo the Virgin my goodness I mean it's startling it's amazing you could preach just that but what did it actually mean on the earth what was the event that it triggered what transpire well it shows that the queen and the King are coming together and they're coming together in the Virgin we already knew that that's why that thing makes us so excited because the prophet already told us that's what's happening in this end time so I didn't need to know that to know that I already knew that we already know it's the end times because Daniel was asking to understand the vision that he didn't understand and God said go your way Daniel for it's that is sealed until the time of the end well now that vision's been unsealed through the ministry of of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10:7 it's been unsealed and the unsealing of the mystery marks the end of time I knew this was the end of time before any CL cataclysmic event took place but brother Chad it shows there's judgments coming I knew there was judgments coming when brother bham threw a rock in the air and that started a whirlwind and went over in the west coast almost fell into the ocean and he says judgments beginning on the earth amen said Mercy has been spurned I knew then that we were entering into a cycle of judgments the Sorrows had begun moving towards the tribulation period I didn't need stars to align to tell me that I didn't need planets I didn't need eclipses none of that I needed to know amen because God already showed us through a prophetic Ministry tying it to the word showing the day we lived in so we know it's the end time we know it's time for earthquakes and floods and fires and pestilence and War among nations we already know that because we're in the end times right so none of these things actually change what we know so we just look at it and say praise God God wrote his first Bible in heaven second Bible in the pyramid third Bible he wrote out and this Bible that was wrote out he took the seals off of it so that we could understand so I shouldn't try to understand the stars and I shouldn't try to understand the pyramid I should try to understand the third word he wrote that he took the seals off of this one can be understood the other ones are still a bit in obscurity so you know what I wish I wish the prophet of God could come here and tell us what was going to happen tomorrow and what it meant and if he did I'd say Amen he'd show it to us in the word it'd be vind ated by coming to pass and we say praise God there's a prophet among us but for me I say God help me I don't want to go down that path I've done it I've done it time and time again and I just don't want to do it again amen praise God Amen God is good I hope I hope we're coming to maturity I hope we are brother Venom says and the me in questions and answers on the seals and this is after he's preached six of the seals he comes in the morning and and uh he preaches questions and answers in the morning service and this is what he says now take my advice as your brother don't put your own interpretation to anything you just go on and live a good Christian Life CU you'll only wind yourself away from the real thing when you do it see you'll only wind your way again away from the thing and all of you are conscience and know that there's something mysterious happening and it's happening and I know what it is now I'm not saying that it's the grace of God that lets me know that what it is it's something that's tremendous and it's gone right now and there's not a way in the world for you to see it but so help me with this Bible in my hand I know what it is it's been told to you before so just don't try to put an interpretation but just believe me as your brother we're living in a great hour We're living in a time well will ju well you just be real humble be a Christian and try to live for God and live honest with your fellow man and love those who don't love you to make any see you see you do you only make it a mysterious something and mess the real program of God up brother I'm I'm coming to the seals to the opening of the seventh seal and he says don't try to interpret anything don't try to figure anything out but here's his instructions you just be real humble be a Christian try to live for God and live honest with your fellow man and love those who don't love you so I've been given a task to do and that's my task and once I complete that I'll start figuring out everything else because I haven't completed this task yet I haven't come to the end of being humble living for God and living honest with your fellow man and loving those who don't love me I haven't I haven't perfected that phase yet so I I can't move to the next one where I can make prediction and interpretations and come up with my own understanding I'm still trying to do what he told me to do and along the way God has marvelously opened his word to us and continues to open it and brings Revelation upon Revelation upon Revelation but the Revelation is what brother R already told us it's always something he already said it's always something that's already in the message we were just blind to it amen and God keeps peeling it away and peeling it away and we're going deeper and deeper in the Revelation but we're not interpreting anything he's interpreting it he's bringing it to past he's making it happen I don't have to interpret one astronomical event because whether I interpret or not or understand it or not or even see it happen or not it makes no difference it'll still come to pass on this Earth but brother said we need to know what's happening we know what's happening but there's a conspirac yes there's a conspiracy who's behind it all the Catholic Church what did it has to do with money and power and we know the whole system is going to God already told us all of this who holds the gold who has the Paper Bond amen there I don't need a conspiracy theory I've been brought into the greatest conspiracy that's going on I know what's happening but how will it happen I don't know what will it look like I don't know what news event will let you know that this is the I don't know I just know it's happening and that has nothing to do with me anyways before because before that goes into full-blown action I'm out of here amen so I already know but shouldn't we be pre prepared how am I going to prepare am I going to what am I going to do buy Fuel and get an extra generator and put enough that's all self-preservation that's all me trying to protect myself when I have a heavenly father and I'm married to a bridegroom that can take care of me and provide everything I need to Everything I Need is provided for me he has given me everything I need amen and even godone amen he begins to show us he's so merciful to us that he even begins to show us a supernatural provision through the spoken word as directed by God I don't need to take care of myself whatever I have need of my heavenly father will provide my bridegroom will provide it for me I don't need to figure out should I keep gold bars downstairs and paper money won't be worth anything and I don't want anybody track me on the internet and I need some fuel and I need a generator and I need at least a year supply of few food honestly when it all falls apart who wants to be here anyways why do you want to preserve your life and come out of your bunker to what why save ourselves why prepare what are we preparing for I don't know there was a lot of rice after Y2K people had rice and beans in abundance help us Lord what I don't want to do is I don't want to complicate what God has given us I want to add to there's so many ways to add to or take away and it doesn't necess necessarily mean you add words and you change the scripture and you change the quote you can read the quote correctly but you can add to or take away in the way that you use it we know that we don't want to hybridize the word none of of us want to hybridize the word I don't you don't nobody who believes God wants to hybridize the word but you know I I believe this is me personally I'm just speaking from my own heart I believe that you can there's more than one way to hybridize the word because if I manipulate that word to match my own desire and try to accomplish my own goal with it I may not misquote it but I have misused it I've used it for self and I've used used it for selfish purposes and I've used it for pride and I've used it for envy and I've used it for lust and I may not quote it wrong but I have used it wrong and I brought the wrong spirit and maybe we can maybe we can hybridize the word by H by attaching the wrong Spirit to the word not changing the words and I want to get to a place where God has absolute control in my life and that it's not me anymore it's him I don't want to mix myself into this and that is the hardest thing we can say it all the time it's the hardest thing in the world to keep from doing and so we just need God's help we need God's spirit let's go to Genesis chapter chapter 3 together and when you go home you have to explain to your kids what Y2K was Genesis chapter 3 verse 4 and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you should be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did eat my brother R said Satan this deceiver spoke in Matthew 24:24 with so much deceit now we find that by his gospel program of knowledge better education higher ethics civilization and so forth has Bewitched the people that wants to serve God into believing his lie Eve did not want to do that but he showed her it was a it was more wisdom in it she didn't know she wanted to know she didn't understand but she wanted to understand and God told her not to try to understand how can I understand any of these things I cannot understand them I believe them I don't have to understand them God is faithful and and not God is faith God is faith not understanding we just believe what he said this is all this has been the Temptation from the garden from the very beginning the Temptation is to figure it out the Temptation is to understand that Eve didn't know but she wanted to know she didn't understand but she wanted to understand and what the devil had to do you I go back and I meditate on this because sometimes the simplest things are the most profound and God showed us what what happened in Genesis was the seed and everything will come from that seed until it comes to to full fruition in the Book of Revelation so everything began here in Genesis and in Genesis God had his son and his son's wife in Eden in pleasure in the Garden of Eden walled in amen and garden means an enclosure so God had them walled in with his word they were protected in this place of safety amen and they were given the word to stand behind and and she was told not to eat of this tree but the serpent comes along anointed by the devil and and begins to it begins to speak to her and and when we realize Eve literally and she wasn't Eve at that time she was the woman because her name is the name that was given to her after the fall but at this point she's Adam yeah right she's the woman is her title her name is Adam and here she is she actually has need for nothing she needs nothing she she's living in Perfection she has a perfect body that won't die uh she's made perfect in Beauty brother B said she was beautiful she was the most beautiful woman she was perfect she she had perfect love Perfect Harmony perfect perfect relationship with her husband everything was in Perfection she actually didn't need anything when she was hungry she ate when she was tired she slept if the wind was blowing too much she told Adam and Adam moved a tree to block the shade of the give her shade and told the wind to stand still like there was no need she had no need so the Devil Couldn't control her the only way the devil can control her is first he has to create in her a need so when he creates in her a need then he can begin to control her by her need yeah listen if you don't need anything nobody can manipulate you if you don't need acceptance if you don't need popularity if you don't need finances if you don't need government support if you don't need everybody around you to tell you you're right and your friend and give you security if you don't need anything nobody can control you you know why they couldn't control Jesus cuz Jesus needed nothing he had a heavenly father he didn't need their system he didn't need the government he didn't need friends he didn't even need his disciples because they all abandoned him and he was fine without them amen that's right Jesus needed nothing because he had a Heavenly Father the woman in the garden needed nothing and when she needed nothing you can't be manipulated this bride is going to come to where her full Reliance is on Jesus Christ I believe that with all my heart I don't know what it will take to get us there and I don't know how and I feel myself far from that Des ation but I know that's the destination amen where we can't be intimidated we can't be frightened we can't be manipulated to ever deviate from this word because he's promised that he'll have a bride that'll stand the test because he predestinated to be so not because she's super strong it's not because you and I are super bright or super strong are we no it's because God determined that he would have a bride in this generation that wouldn't fall she wouldn't fall the way the the woman fell Eve fell she wouldn't fall the way the first church fell he's already pred destinated in his plan that he will have a bride that will stand face to face with the same temptation as in the garden only this one won't fall because he's provided his word and he's come himself to dwell in her so we've got to get to the place where I don't need anything but Christ it's got to be that way I don't need my church say brother Chad how can you say that because brother B said they're going to lock the doors of this church someday so we better get to the place well I I I should practice that now and not go to church that's that's off the word so don't don't get ahead of schedule don't worry you don't have to make anything come to pass it will come to pass you don't have to make it happen and you don't have to preempt what God's going to do just hold steady it's going to happen and if you believe you're one of them and God has called you for this day and he's called you as one of his elect it's going to happen to you and it's going to happen in you why because he determined it so so the the the devil has to First create a need in the woman now he he's creating a longing she doesn't need anything he says you'll be like God on the earth she was already a god yep she just didn't have knowledge of Good and Evil she only had knowledge of good so he offers her or begins to tell her that there's more than what you have God does know in the day you eat there of your eyes will be open and you'll be as God's knowing Good and Evil all of a sudden he offered her more than what she had you know how amazing it is when somebody will offer offer you more Revelation on the message and what's really happening they're creating a need inside of you because you need this Revelation to go in the Rapture you need this Revelation you know what the truth is we need Revelation and every time God opens the word and gives more re we need that Revelation and we need to move into it the the the the the problem is when somebody comes along and now they have the Revelation you need and what's happening the devil once again is creating in the woman a need she she's lack you're lack that see nobody says this but what they're implying is you're lacking something you need I have or our church or our camp or our ministry has what you need right and all of a sudden it becomes a manipulation tactic because now you need what I've got now need to come under my heading you know what the real revelation of being bride all you need is him and he supplies all your needs if he if you need a revelation to go higher he'll give you that Revelation how will he give it through Fellowship through a church through preaching of the word through a pastor absolutely those are all God's mechanisms and there's nothing wrong with any of it but it's him giving it to you it's your husband supplying it it's God delivering it to you all you need is him and he supplies everything you need am amen so in order to manipulate the woman now he creates a need and now she needs to know she didn't know but now she wanted to know and now she she didn't understand but she wanted to understand and now when she when when this need when this there's a need there's something more she has everything what does she need more now the need begins to cause her to reason now when she looked at the tree she saw that it was good for food was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make all of the sudden she starts looking at this tree like she's never looked at it before and she's analyzing the tree it it it looks good it's Pleasant it'll make make one wise and when she analyzed the tree with her own intellect she couldn't see the problem with the tree but it didn't matter whether she could see the problem with the tree or not God said don't partake God knew what was there and he knew the end result she didn't so she thought that she needed to understand she didn't need to understand what she needed to do was obey because God had provided everything she needed even the Commandment to not touch was God's provided way so for us God has given us this message God has given us his word he's given us Revelation he's given us a heart to perceive he's given us the faith it's a gift the faith to believe he's given us every element we need it was God sent the prophet we didn't figure anything out God Vindicated the prophet with signs and wonders God moved the heavenlies and get had a prophet to say this means that and tied it all together and vindicate improved his presence God did all of that we didn't have to provide anything for ourselves when I needed Malachi 4 God provided it when I needed Revelation 10:7 and the opening of the seals God provided it when I needed a greater revelation God gave it God so we don't have to go find it does that mean I don't study study the message oh my goodness study because it's your bridegroom because it's your love because it's your passion read it study it uh absorb it feed on it constantly but you're not going to figure anything out by that don't dare think that the more you read the more you'll understand amen the more you read amen God May Quicken more to you but if he doesn't quick it it's not going to help it takes God is it wrong to read and study no read and study constantly constantly be in the word constantly be in that atmosphere in that environment feed on it because it's right feed on it because it's true feed on it because it's the word of God feed on it because it's your life don't feed on it so you can understand something better than somebody else amen amen just feed on it cuz it's life it is our life it is everything to us let's go to 1 Timothy 1 1 Timothy 1 verse one says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the Commandment of God Our Savior and Lord Jesus Christ which is Our Hope unto Timothy my own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ Our Lord as I besought Thee as I besought Thee to abide still in Ephesus when I went into m cedonia that thou mightest charge some that teach no other do that they teach no other Doctrine neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than Godly edifying which is in faith so do now the end of the Commandment is Charity which that's love that's agape love the end of the Commandment is love out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of Faith un Fain from which some having swerved have turned a side into vain jangling Desiring to be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm Paul sent Timothy and he was asking Timothy in this scripture to go and remind them to teach no other Doctrine and neither give heed to fables and endless gen genealogies this is what he said which minister questions rather than Godly edifying which is in faith so what should the min be doing Godly edifying which is in faith because he said this is the whole purpose because the end of the Commandment what is the goal what are we trying to achieve is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and a faith and Fain what's the target what are we aiming at what is the end of the commandment and end of the word and end of the preaching and the goal of everything this is the goal am till till till we come to love what is the Capstone on the stature of a perfect man charity love agape love what is what are we building unto love the Capstone of love what is God the Bible says God is love amen and brother B said Jesus Christ was God's love give to man he was expression of of love to mankind so Christ is the express is love expressed amen what are we growing to we're growing to the stature of Jesus Christ we're growing to his same image what's the destination the destination is perfectly love and brother brenon when he went beyond the curtain of time he was told am me when when he got there the voice said amen only perfect love will enter in there so what is the goal of it all to figure something out to understand something no the goal of it all is to come to the stature of the fullness of Christ to move into the image of love the person of love the capping of Love The Headstone of love until we all come to to to to love from a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned unfeigned means without pretense or hypocrisy you're not faking anything it's genuine to the core of who you are this is what you are and this is what you believe that is why the preaching is to the edifying of Faith amen it's not just to know facts and figures amen those facts and figures are supposed to point us to what to Christ the word the message the the end time Revelation that builds us Faith to come to this place to what to love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith un fed the other things will end up just being a waste of time or worse or Worse yes see if if I take the message and I have my own ambition and I start to attach quotes to my ambition and I start preaching from an an ambition to achieve something to prove something and I put Pride behind the quotes I don't care how many scriptures you stack on top of Pride amen it still can't offset Pride Underneath It All is pride if if I use the scriptures because of my Envy towards another and no and I'm justifying my envy and I'm justifying my actions I'm justifying my frustration towards them and anger towards them and I stack together quotes and I put together scriptures to show that I'm right it doesn't matter how right you are underneath it is Envy yes you may be able to prove this is exactly what the Pharisees were trying to do they were envious of Jesus he was getting the popularity the whole world was going after him they were losing all of their status and because of Envy pilate said the Bible said pilate knew because of Envy they delivered him to him not because of anything they' done because of simple envy and they had to shut him down and they started using scriptures no Prophet comes out of uh uh out of Nazareth and and and they start they start tying the scriptures together and they start pointing to the priesthood and they start pointing out all kinds of things to show that they were right and Jesus was wrong it didn't matter how many scriptures they used and it didn't even matter if they quoted them correctly they may have said them verbatim exactly as Moses wrote them but it didn't matter it mattered for not because what was underneath was Envy amen envy and pride and and and ambition and self- motivation and I say God help us I want to get that all washed out of me I I want to come if God has ever called me to preach the gospel I want to preach it in its Purity and not hybrid it with my own ambition and my own pride and my own mixed mix and match I don't want to do that to this precious glorious word that's so precious and perfect I don't want to taint it I don't want to uh ruin it I don't want to present it in the wrong way because I'm mixing myself and with it I want to die to myself and you say well praise God you want to die to yourself I want to die to myself but I'm failing in it miserably every day I've got to have God come on the scene and rescue me from me I got to I I got to actually take time Amen to judge my motives I got to actually stop in prayer once in a while and say God show me show me where I'm at let's go to Ephesians chapter 4 talk about making a preacher tremble this makes me tremble and it should it absolutely should because if I've taken the word of God that's so perfect and precious and I lay it over to my pride but I Minister it for self-purpose and in self-will for self- glorification and exaltation then what have I presented to the people have I presented them the holy ghost or have I presented my pride say God please help us all we can do is get on our knees and say God please help us and I believe he will because he's he's going to have a church without spot a wrinkle he's going to have a true fful Ministry he's going to have ministers and people and officers and a church he's got he's got to it's his word he's got to produce his own word so what do I do the only thing I can do is lay flat on my face and say God help me save me keep me rescue me stop me whatever you have to do Lord I want to surrender myself to you in Ephesians chapter 4 I want to go to verse 10 says he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above heaven that he might fill all things and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature the fullness of Christ henceforth that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slide of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love what's he doing he's building a body into the very image of Jesus Christ what's he using he's using every joint and he's using a fful Ministry but it says in verse 15 but speaking the truth in love to me this is the key what is this fivefold ministry going to do speak the truth and love what's the motivation behind it love what kind of love agape love which is what God what's it going to take it's going to take God in the word it's going to take God behind administering his own word it's going to be by the Holy Spirit not by the spirit of a man that doesn't mean God doesn't use man brother B said God's in you with your temperament God uses those things but it can't come from the man it's got to come from God or else it'll be tainted it'll be corrupted it'll be polluted and it's got to stay pure because there got to be a washing of the Water by the word so that there's a bride without wrinkle or any such thing so it's going to have to be by the spirit of God and we have to speak the truth in love not speak the truth in Envy not speak the truth in Pride not speak the truth truth and hatred the discip the Pharisees use some scriptures and the scriptures is the truth but they spoke those scriptures because they hated Christ so they spoke the truth for hatred it doesn't correlate it doesn't match you know when we think of this speaking the truth in love it's it's such a simple statement like it's so easy speaking the truth in love you realize that that word love is agape and that Agape it it doesn't mean something that's emotional emotion can come with it but it's not motivated by emotion it's motivated by Revelation and understanding because God is love Christ is love the Holy Ghost has shed the love of God and brought our hearts it's speaking the truth in love it's speaking the truth with the very motive of God in giving the word because God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever should believeth in him shall not be condemned but have everlasting life amen is that what he said amen the next verse he sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but the world through him might be saved amen am amen so what was his motive in sending Jesus Christ his motive was love and his motive was salvation when somebody rejected that they're already condemned they're condemned already because they received not the Son of God they're already condemned he didn't send the son to condemn the world they were already condemned by the Fall In the Garden of Eden he sent the son into the world for salvation love sent Jesus Christ he was an expression of God's love Jesus died motivated by love so now how should I administer this message with the same motive that God gave it how should I minister to the scriptures with the same motive God gave it amen how should I witness I should witness to others with the same motivation behind me that motivated God to send Jesus Christ into the world Amen that they might be saved but I have failed so many times in witnessing because many times in witnessing I was using the word to condemn somebody else and to vindicate myself as knowing what the Bible said and being right and somehow being holy and you're not holy and you're wrong and you're condemned and I used the wrong motive with the word the word was pure but my heart was evil I want wanted to prove I was right and they were wrong is that why Jesus that is that why Jesus came into the world is that why God sent his son is that why God gave us a message is that why he gave a love letter to the bride will there be judgment absolutely anytime you spurn Mercy there's judgment Mercy's been Stern but that wasn't the purpose the world was already in judgment he didn't have to send it for judgment he sent it for mercy and when they spurn Mercy there's not nothing left but judgment so in witnessing my motive now needs to be love it needs I say God put a love in my heart and honestly I'm to the point where if God doesn't give me a supernatural Love and Desire for that person I better shut my mouth and not say anything to them because I need the right motivation with the word to get the right results and if they if they spurn Mercy then that's between them and God but my motive has to be love and salvation and and because there's a soul at stay and that's got to be my whole Vision not whether I'm right or wrong I can prove it by the Bible and show you that I know something and I'm righteous and you're not that's all got to die and we got to go back to a basic love of souls amen a basic desire to say there's a way out of this trap friend there's a way of Salvation there's an assurance amen you can have what God has given in this day because of love and a desire for Souls not for condemnation self- glorification envy and strife you're ha hatred for the Catholic church does not justify your costic attitude amen when taking the word amen I shouldn't say yours I should say mine I said things so wrong so many times and I I realize now where I am in my journey I look back and I say that was shameful and I'm ashamed I'm ashamed because it was motivated by self love of self defending self when we see the word as Jesus Christ it's the most precious thing in the world to us when somebody rejects it it Grieves us it it Grieves us and it should be grieved because they've rejected my Lord but also they've rejected their own salvation that should grieve me but it shouldn't make me angry when it makes me angry it's because I got myself mixed in right you know how many times s we thought we were defending the word and we were only defending our reputation and I would sing swing the sword harder than anybody and what it was was a spirit of Vengeance because I had been offended say God you have to help us when it comes down to it this is going to be real it's not going to be Church right not going to be religion it's going to be reality it's going to be what the apostles had when they came stumbling out of the upper room and they went moving through the Earth spreading the gospel it's going to be the same thing only this one's going to go on and finish the purpose and move to the full revelation of the word it's not going to be all mixed up with ourselves and our own ideas and our own offenses and our own wounds and our own complexes and God heal us of all of that so that we can Minister the speak the word in love amen and if I can't speak the word in love God help me to put my hand over my mouth and walk away and pray till my heart changes I think one of the most marvelous messages brother brandom ever preached was standing in the Gap it's helped me so many times if he hadn't preached standing in the Gap out of already left the ministry I'd already hung it up because all we can do is fail all we can do is make mistakes but thank God God showed that Prophet there was a mountain range that had success and failure already baked into it had highs and lows had valleys and had frustrations and and had everything already yeah was it cast in stone so thankful amen the prophet comes back and he says now I'm going to go back I I was trying to get away he said I'm going to go back but I can't go like I am now even though he had to go back he couldn't go like he was now he said cuz I still feel like they should have heard the message so there was still an offense there was still a hurt and he said I can't go am I can't go back the way I am now feeling this way something's got to happen to me to change me said God something's got to happen to me to change me change me God and then I I I'm Marvel at the mercies of God brother B preaching and opening his heart and he's pouring out where he's been and what he's done and where his failure was and why he wanted to take the action it was all for self he was justifying it by scripture by Bible types it was all for self comes to the end of it he he's repenting before his church he's repenting before God he's declaring it all and he's saying there's still something has to change in me I can't go that way and lo and behold at the end of service a man right in the front drops dead brother way Falls dead and brother brandham in the midst of explaining his failure where he's failed in the ministry where God corrected him where he's going to have to still have a change in his life life he's still not right he steps down and he goes and he lays hands on the brother and calls for his life back and God raises a brother from the dead oh my goodness he's in the midst of explaining I'm still not right I still need God to do something and God's still using the man because God knows and he understands and he's bringing us to a higher level God's still been using us and he's still by his own Grace by his own Mercy he's still doing something in our lives but he wants us to come to another place we're moving to the Capstone friends to perfect love to be the reflection of Jesus Christ on the earth I just when I see what God did right there at the end of service and brother B said I can't go back I can't go back I and then at the end of service he says I'm going back now I don't know how God did it I don't know how God changed his feeling in his heart but God did amen praise God let's go to Second Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter 1 verse 2 said Grace and peace be multiplied in you through the knowledge of God and of Jes Jesus Christ Our Lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain into life and godliness through the knowledge of him that ha called us to glory and to Virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now you go on he starts talking about the the stature of a perfect man and the divine nature I'm not going to go into that but I want to take this last statement into our Focus escaping the corruption that is in the world through lust how did the corruption come into the world through lust Eve lusted she lusted for knowledge she lusted for something he he the the servant beged her and she began to Crave or desire or want something more than what God had given her and that's lust so I've explained it before but I'll explain it again many times we use commonly we use the term lust only to mean sexual lust sexual desire wrong sexual desire but but that's not what lust means in the Bible that's certainly part of it but lust means a want yes just anything you want you're lusting for right so at the at the end of church you'll be lusting for your lunch right it's normal it's it's it's a normal thing so don't when you say lust don't put it off on the something something else just realize what it is corruption entered the world through what through lust she wanted something she that self she wanted something he he began to show her that she needed another knowledge another position she needed to know she didn't know and it created a lust and when a lust came she could be manipulated she could be deceived and she could fall amen but all of that comes from self it's a want that's why I said God help us help us to get to the place where all I want is Christ I I where I you know there's nothing wrong with wanting we we we want a nice yard and and we want to take a vacation and that's all fine but make sure that all of our wants amen are way below the first one and the first one is him all I want is him I want to please him and let everything else die let everything else fall away and if anything hinders this let it fall away my job relationships let everything else I want him I don't want a lust for anything else because that's how corruption enters even us is when we begin to want we want Prestige we we want money we we want honor we want something and when we want that's where corruption gets in and that's where the devil has easy access to us and begins to manipulate us because he creates a want amen you could have this and you could have honor and you could have money and you could have this job and you can have whatever you can have and all of a sudden he offers this amen and creates in you a desire for this and then all of a sudden you have to start lacing together scriptures and quotes to justify your action and really all it has to do is his lust yes God help us die to self let's look over at second Timothy while we're here at the end of the New Testament let's jump over to Second Timothy 2 Timothy 4 1 in 2 Timothy 4:1 he says I charge thee therefore before God and and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead it is a appearing in his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine for after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itchy ears they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned to fables you say oh those those poor people were deceived no they got exactly what they wanted amen they got exactly what they wanted let's go to acts before I comment on that let's go to acts turn to Acts chapter 20 I want to lay this scripture in too in Acts chapter 20 Paul has gathered the Elders of the churches together and he's speaking to the Brethren and he's warning them because he's soon to depart and he says in in Acts 20 and verse 28 he says take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievious wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves who he's speaking to his Ministerial Association the ones that were partners with him in Ministry he said also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them so why did these men come bringing their own doctrines and their own teachings because they wanted to bring disciples to themselves why for their own lust but in second Timothy we find that the people were having itching ears heaping to themselves teachers so that they could have their own lust amen so so there's there's wrong on both sides but these two have a magnetism they come together we say poor deceived people maybe it was the people who were heaping to themselves teachers having itchy ears they wanted to hear something that allowed them to stay in their own lusts and then you have a Ministry amen who will speak perverse things amen because they're bringing disciples to themselves and the whole thing is corruption through love L and me it doesn't matter it doesn't matter how much you say I believe the prophet I believe the Bible I'm using the scriptures if that's the motivation behind it how do you think it's going to come out what do you think the result's going to be say God give us pure hearts on both sides remember nanism is impossible unless there's a people who want to be ruled over by the leoty we say those dirty rotten those those priests back in that day they took authority over those poor people and some of that's true some were just caught up in the mix but there had to be a majority there had to be a people that allowed it and wanted it and permitted it or it would never happen the error is on lust on both sides because people didn't want to take responsibility for their own spiritual well-being they didn't want to have to pray they didn't want to have to seek God they didn't want to have to repent what they want to do is come and be part of the system be told they're okay have some holy water sprinkled on and a guarantee they're going to heaven you know what the same thing can happen today amen I want to go to a good church with a good Ministry and there may be nothing wrong there but you're still responsible for your own soul we can never turn over our responsibility to somebody else that's the other half of nianis then you have to have a a a rulership you have to have an authority that wants to dominate wants to control for their own glory and for their own lust and those two entities come together to create nianis am and the whole thing's based on lust on self when brother Bram set up when when he said the only way up is down ah my goodness I thought that was a simple statement it's becoming the greatest truth in Philippians 1 I'm just going to read this Philippians 1:15 Paul says some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife yes so you can preach Christ of envy and strife they did in Paul's day some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife and some also of Goodwill the one preach Christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add Affliction to my bonds but the other of love knowing that I am set for the defense of the Gospel so one preaches for love the other preaches for Envy Strife but you know what Paul said at the end at least Christ has preached he wouldn't he wouldn't even con he wouldn't even condemn it and tell them to stop but at least Christ has preached but some are doing it for envy and strife to add afflictions to the bonds of Paul because they're jealous of him and have a hatred towards him and they're preaching a gospel a word because they don't like Paul what a poor motivation for preaching yeah God help every one of us amen but let's turn to John 15 together John 15 John 15 verse 26 but when the comforter is come whom I will send unto from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me what is the spirit it's the spirit of Truth and what will the spirit of Truth do he will testify of Christ amen not the spirit of Truth is not coming into a man to draw disciples into himself to feed his pride to promote even his Lust For filthy lucer that's not what the Holy Ghost comes for but when he comes he he shall lead you into all truth and he will testify of me amen my what are we supposed to be doing I think we're supposed to be presenting the word with love for souls for salvation preaching for the edification unto Faith till we all come into the stature of a perfect man to the unity of Faith to the headship of of Christ to the very likeness of Christ to the end of the Commandment is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and Faith unfeigned till we keep our goal our Target in mind what's our Target the Capstone love even in teaching our children there so many times that we inject our own pride in our teaching to our children and we instruct them in the ways of the the word because we want to keep them looking good for our image amongst the Brethren and the it's not wrong what we taught them because what we taught them is the word what was wrong was the spirit behind it was my pride I didn't want to lose face in front of my brothers and sisters so I attached my pride to this beautiful word and when I put that on my children you know many times our children haven't resisted the word they've resisted the underlying Pride because they're sensing something this not right because it's not about my soul this is not about love this is not about you loving me and caring about my soul and wanting me to grow in righteousness this is about you wanting me not to embarrass you and what's happened is we're not speaking the truth in love we're speaking it in Pride yes we want we want to stay our image intact that's Pride we want to hold ourselves in a certain way in front of other people and that's not speaking the word in love and there's nothing wrong with keeping a standard in your home and tell the people this is my home and this is what I believe and this is the way it's going to be here because I'm honoring God and I believe the word but just as soon as Pride's attached to that that th those senses of those kids are going to start catching there's something else motivating this and many times they have not run away from the word or the message they've run away from pride and envy and strife and they've gotten away from those things that are wicked and evil not from the right of the word so God help us to be pure in our hearts and pure with this word and I want to be right in my heart that's why brother B said I would rather be wrong in my Doctrine and right in my heart instead of wrong in my heart and right in my Doctrine because if I'm wrong in my heart and right in my Doctrine I'll take a right Doctrine with a wrong heart and I'll use it for manipulation and control for my own pride and my own envy and for my own purpose says and I will actually take the Glorious word of God and Destroy lives because of what's wrong inside of me and that's not why God sent the word let's turn to Psalms 33 if we could together Psalms 33: vers 4 the scripture means so much to me now for the word of the Lord is right and all his works are done in truth the word of the Lord is right and all his works are done in truth God never did anything for vain glory for Pride for Envy for Strife for hatred his word is right and all of his works are truth what do you think our work should look like our work should be done in truth Jesus he looked at the Pharisees and he said you're whiteed seers you're all polished and clean on the outside but inside you're full of dead men's bones you you broaden your floras you give great swelling words of praise you blow a trumpet and you put money in you're doing all of that for pride and Jesus could look Beyond it and said with the condition really was but all his works are done in truth when that little widow woman didn't blow a trumpet she didn't make a sign she just slipped over and dropped all she had into the treasury her Works were truth the Pharisees works when he blew the trumpet so everybody would watch him drop in his bag of money his Works were evil they did the same thing brother Chad they put money in the Treasure y same work one was done in truth one was a pretense it was hypocrisy so the work was a lie because the work was saying I do this because I love God and actually I'm doing this because I want the people to love me amen I stand on the street corner and give great swelling words and pray loud prayers brother B said to be seen of men that work is not a work in truth that is deception on display that's a lie because you're showing the world that you love God and you're singing praises to God and really what's happening is you love yourself and you want people to admire you right amen but God's word is right and his works are in truth God help me I want my Works to be in truth it's all I can say is God help me that's what I keep saying the further I go the more I say God help me you remember the story of we talked about this a few weeks ago but remember the story of the the woman caught in adultery and they brought her to Jesus and they're saying Moses says in the law this woman she's caught in the very Act of adultery she should be stoned what do you say and he said they did this tempting him you know how deplorable this is yeah they have no desire to keep the word right their whole motivation is not works and Truth the whole motivation is tempting him so they have reason to find fault yes the whole thing's a setup because if they wanted to keep the camp clean they would have brought the man she committed adultery with because they said she was caught in the very act how are you caught in the very Act of adultery if there's no man the Bible say she's caught in the very Act and so there was a man present and and their their whole action proves their motive their motive is not pure this is not a work in truth because if they were doing this according to Moses to keep sin out of the camp to keep the camp clean they would have brought the man to this had nothing to do with the truth of the word it had everything to do with their envy and jealousy and hatred towards Jesus and now they're manipulating the word to try to set a trap for the word how Wicked to use God's glorious word in such an evil way to just justify self to justify your reason for condemning a man for hating him all because you can tie together something and you can lay a trap and you can make him say the wrong thing so that you can test to everybody he's a false minister or a false brother cuz he didn't believe this maybe he just sens that the whole thing was a big setup anyways and you weren't even honest in your question Jesus I'm so thankful he didn't take the bait found a way to keep the word and to let the woman go and it's not that he didn't know she was guilty she was guilty was she worthy of death according to law she was worthy of death according to the law but that woman was part of a manipulation scheme and Jesus knew it y she was guilty yes she was guilty but she was being used for another purpose and the Lord discerned it and in his in his great wisdom he let the woman go free because this isn't about righteousness this isn't about keeping the law this isn't about purity this is pure simple jealousy let's not take the message and attach it to jealousy Envy hatred let's be motivated by love same reason he sent it he sent the message to call his bride to himself because he loved her he sent the message for grace and mercy and love that's why he sent it if it's rejected will it bring judgment sure it will but that's not why he sent it let's come with the same motive behind it all remember when Judas this story takes place in John chapter 12 when Judas sees Mary break the alabaster box of ointment anoint Jesus's head and his feet and Judas says what a waste says and listen what he says this money should have been sold this should have been sold in the money given to the poor Judas you know what you're a good guy thinking of the poor and loving the poor and worried about the poor and the Bible said he said that not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and he carried the money back he covered he covered his greed with piety but what was behind it was greed but what was on the outside was piety and godliness and care for others Aiden didn't care one drop about the poor all he cared about was getting the money in the bag CU he carried what was there and he lifted it out of there for himself CU he was a thief doesn't matter what we say what matters is what we are in our hearts we can make a pile of mistakes that's not even what's important what's important is what's our motivation what are we trying to do what what are we moving in love are we trying are we trying to represent Christ on this Earth and you can make a pile of mistakes and it still be right that's right but you can have the wrong motivation and make no mistake lace the message together so perfectly quote it just exactly have the scriptures just right and never be off in the word at all dress just right act just right go to church every time pay the tithes and do the offering but it can never cover for a corrupted heart the heart has to be right and all of those works are right and all of those works are the word but let's do the works in truth like God does his works all of his works are truth let all of my Works be truth no more pretense when we're faking brother bam said and Satan zeden makes a statement he said I heard brother Neville say this morning someone might have been asking him why didn't I preach on the Holy Ghost why didn't I do this said here it is the Holy Ghost is the action in you amen it's a life not an emotion not some sort of a fleshly evidence but it's a person Jesus Christ the word of God established in your heart to Quicken every word of the age watch the Holy Ghost In Action not so much in demonstration but in action what it does according to the word the Holy Ghost is the life to do what to keep the word watch it in action he said remember brother bam told us that this bride will be the final voice and the final age she's predestinated to be the final voice in the final age but he says she under her Messenger will be the final voice to the final age under her messenger staying subject to the message we be subject to the word not having her own that's right remember after she eats the book in Revelation 10 she us to prophesy again that prophesy again means a repeating not her own prophecies not her own interpretation not her own Revelation but she's to prophesy again that's what's already been prophesied we're here to preach the message not our own ideas we're not here to build our own platform we're not here to glorify ourselves we're here to glorify Christ we're not here to present ourselves to the people we're here to present Christ to the people it's going to take a pure heart brother B says she'll be the final voice to the final age but in Revelation CH 4 he makes this statement he says now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice and if you can't preach the people a sermon if you're a preacher you called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of God that will bring reproach to them who reject him no one can put a finger on his or her life they're sweet loving if there ever was a man of God is that man or that woman see live your sermon and brother B says that's the Thunder that shakes the devil he don't care how loud you shout and how much you jumping down but when he sees that life that our life is testifying of Christ Our Life that we live our subjection to him our works that are done in truth amen and then when the words match our life and our life match the words and there's a unity and a Harmony between what's in our heart and what our motive is between what we say Amen that brings life am that will bring life it has life in it and it's come through the right channel the right way anointed by the Holy Ghost let's go to Galatians 5 I want to read just I think just one or just two more scriptures Galatians chapter 5 Galatians chapter 5 and verse 22 522 he says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law you can't even write a law against it because this is all the purpose of the law was to bring man to this kind of Life they asked Jesus what's the greatest commandment he said love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy strength with all thy mind with all thy Soul that's the greatest commandment amen he said and the second is like unto the first love thy neighbor as thyself he said on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets the whole Bible was wrapped up in what you trying to give your whole life to God and give him preeminence and you live your life to others the way he would that was the purpose of the whole Bible the whole law on the prophets was trying to get a people who would surrender completely to God and operate towards other people the same way God would operate towards other people that was the whole purpose of the law so what is the end of the Commandment love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and Faith unfeigned what is the goal in this day the stature of a perfect man what is it it's climbing up through faith meekness Temperance kindness brotherly love all the way to God himself God love the Capstone capping off our lives Vulcanizing it all together and displaying the life of Jesus Christ that's the end game God purify my heart purify my heart amen praise God I'm going to read this last scripture 2 Corinthians while we turn here maybe the musicians would like to come brother Blake would like to come second Corinthians chapter 3 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 3 says for as much as ye are manifestly decare declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart amen the final voice to the final age that's what this is the final voice to the final age the Epistle of Christ when you read through the Epistles you have the Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians the Epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians the Epistle of Peter the Epistle of John the Epistle of James you have all kinds of Epistles which just means letters it's a letter that is a letter that Paul wrote to the Corinthians it was a letter that Peter wrote to the church but he says you're Christ's letter to the world you're his letter not written with ink and not chiseled in stone you're a living letter and it's engraved in your heart oh praise God let's become this for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not by might not by power not by Church orders not by a super anointed preacher not by human effort not by rules and regulations but by my spirit sayeth the Lord the only way to get this right is by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the indwelling of God his very life the very one that anointed the writing of the word the very one that was alive in Jesus Christ the very life that's in the church now to manifest the word and keep it pure the fruits of the spirit are these meekness Joy Temperance Faith against such there is no law the never the law was never written against the spirit the law was always written against our nature amen but the spirit is supposed to work us against our nature back into the word of God not written with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart amen say God write your word in my heart amen make me that epistle that Living Word I can't make myself what I can do is recognize that I need God and I can Surrender by the grace of God he's given me something that can recognize under the preaching of the word that I need more of him that I'm not where I ought to be and that I need him to come and wash me out and burn me out and I need him him to take over but that's Grace that allows us to come to that recognition and all I can do is say I surrender all all I can do is say it's me Lord but I'm here and I believe that you called me for this purpose and I want to be surrendered to this purpose make my heart true and make my Works truth man let's all Stand Together praise God you know what this message wasn't another move of God although it was a move of God it was more than that it was Christ coming to manifest himself in flesh so much more than another Revival so much more than another move so much more than another exciting set of circumstances that come to the church it's more than that friends It's the Return of the fullness of Christ into his people amen so that he can finish the work that he left to do in and through the bride in this day oh we just have to surrender to him friends we have to recognize that we need him how do you surrender when you don't know you need to surrender when you feel like I'm good and I've got this wrapped up and I've got it all under how do you know that there's still more need for surrender oh God I hope he opens our heart and so we can recognize our need and ask him to come in wash us out Lord and fill us with yourself let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus Lord we need you God I God you know my heart and my repentance and where I'm ashamed of myself so thankful Lord that you didn't let me continue walking in blindness that you're opening my eyes God I pray you take that eyes saav and continue to wash our eyes that we can see God may we never lose sight of our great need for you may we never get comfortable in ourselves may we never get laxed we still need you Lord every hour we need you God we need you God to do surgery in our hearts we need you God to come and wash Us by the washing of the water of your word we need the sanctifying power of your blood your life to come and cleanse us so that you can dwell in us and have full control God we want you to go to the doors in the doors in the doors we want you to have access to every part of us Lord God we want to surrender to you in a greater way than we've ever surrendered that you might come and bring a greater reality than we've ever experienced a reality in our heart a reality in our life and May It Go Lord flow from out of the inside of us into a life lived for you an obedience to the word a demonstration of your word that we might be written Epistles Lord and that your word might be declared in our actions and our conduct and our thoughts and our words in our lives God all your words are good and true and your works are truth God make our works truth as well may we become just like you little sayet may we be the children of God upon the Earth and if your works are true make make our works truth that we might be pleasing to you and put inside of us a love Lord the same love you had when you sent your son into the world well the same desire that you had for salvation give us that same desire towards others forgive us Lord for our self motivation for our lust God I want to die to that that thing Lord I want so bad that my only need is you I want to come to a place where all I need is you and you're the supplier of all my needs Lord help me to get to that place where I don't look for help from outside I don't look for anybody else to support Lord I'm looking to you alone to be my husband help me God to get to that place where I can truly surrender all R I pray that you would meet all of our needs according to your promises you would deliver us Lord you would heal us you would use us for we want to be empty vessels for you to use God have your way with us as we go from here bless us in every effort keep us on the straight and narrow by your grace Be Our Shepherd and lead
