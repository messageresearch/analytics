[0:00] is it possible that this whole book amen
[0:03] is a veiled mystery that unveils Christ
[0:05] but that I find that I'm part of the
[0:07] mystery amen and it unveils me and I
[0:10] find out amen every Spirit that's ever
[0:12] been alive is still alive Spirits don't
[0:15] die amen whatever Spirit they were
[0:17] fighting before they're fighting now and
[0:19] I'm fighting those same spirits and
[0:21] everything that has been is now but
[0:24] Solomon said there's nothing new Under
[0:26] the Sun but everything that has been is
[0:29] now
[0:32] amen man now I know what happened to the
[0:34] churches I know about the white horse
[0:36] rider I know about the red horse I know
[0:37] about the black I know about the pale I
[0:40] know all of these stuff the problem is
[0:42] we know it all but we don't know it
[0:44] because we keep falling under the
[0:45] influence of the horse
[0:47] riders and God has to continually come
[0:50] to our
[0:53] rescue I mean it's not like we've walked
[0:55] a glorious perfect life friends we we're
[0:58] born again receive the Holy Ghost we
[0:59] have the the message and we never made a
[1:01] misstep after that we've fallen into all
[1:03] kinds of self-deception I mean self-pity
[1:06] and all kinds of sad games and and
[1:09] stories and made mistakes and walked
[1:11] contrary and failed
[1:15] and what was it deception where was the
[1:18] deception the deception was right
[1:21] inside amen because there's two Nations
[1:25] yeah at
[1:26] War if I've
[1:28] conceived if this is God why is this
[1:33] so let's go inquire of the
[1:36] Lord and they'll say Hey listen here's
[1:38] the mystery yeah there's two peoples in
[1:42] you two
[1:43] Nations
[1:45] amen but I love how he says but the
[1:48] younger Shall Serve the
[1:51] Elder because for us the elder brother
[1:55] was the sin nature the one that come to
[1:57] expression first we were born in sin
[1:59] shape and iniquity amen the natural
[2:01] birth came first and we're born all the
[2:03] carnal side all the carnal things listen
[2:06] you don't have to teach your baby to
[2:07] steal you don't have to teach your baby
[2:09] to bite you don't have to teach your
[2:10] baby to
[2:13] lie I mean I don't want to upset you all
[2:15] of you are holding those sweet little
[2:16] babies but but they're born in sin
[2:19] shaped into iniquity amen they come into
[2:21] this world speaking lies amen they're
[2:23] Fallen creatures and you don't have to
[2:25] teach them any of the evil or any of the
[2:26] wicked they pick up on that super fast
[2:29] yeah
[2:30] we spend all of our time trying to keep
[2:32] them going the right way and me we get
[2:34] none of our time trying to teach them
[2:35] the wrong way but yet they always find
[2:37] the wrong way and not the right way and
[2:39] we're exhausting
[2:41] ourselves do we we get
[2:44] it so the elder brother the Esau came
[2:47] first amen but what comes second is the
[2:50] new birth amen the Jacob the Israel side
[2:52] comes second but he said in this
[2:55] prophecy that the Elder Shall Serve the
[2:58] younger amen there's going going to come
[3:00] a submission there's going to come a
[3:01] servant toe and by the grace of God
[3:04] according to the prophetic word of God
[3:06] that I know by the new birth and by the
[3:08] spirit of God that that old nature is
[3:10] going to have to serve the younger going
[3:12] to have to serve this new
[3:15] birth amen and I thank God for that and
[3:19] so now this this this elder brother if
[3:22] we should say this elder part of me it's
[3:25] going to have to come subjection and
[3:26] come into servant toe Amen to this new
[3:29] birth
[3:31] praise be to God
