[0:00] and so now this is a this is a quote
[0:02] that I want to start laboring on because
[0:04] we've got this balance that's all the
[0:05] way off and I don't know how I'm going
[0:07] to ever become worthy amen I know all
[0:10] the kind of things that make me not
[0:12] worthy there's a whole pile of that make
[0:14] me not worthy amen but what is going to
[0:16] make me worthy what's going to make my
[0:18] life worthy of the Gospel what's going
[0:20] to make me worthy of
[0:22] Christ and he says again in the same
[0:24] message a Christian is not a tool or
[0:26] some kind of mechanical wrench to a
[0:28] great big religious regime
[0:30] that's right a Christian is not some
[0:32] kind of a tool that keeps a religious
[0:33] organization moving a Christian that is
[0:36] not a Christian a Christian is to be
[0:38] Christlike amen and a Christian cannot
[0:41] be a Christian until Christ comes into
[0:43] the man the Life of Christ in him then
[0:46] it produces the life that Christ lived
[0:49] and you do the things that Christ
[0:51] did what am I talking about personal
[0:54] relationship to Christ what is it is
[0:57] your life worthy of the Gospel amen when
[1:00] brother Ben starts laying this out in
[1:01] your life worthy of the Gospel he starts
[1:03] talking about the way we Act and the way
[1:05] we dress and the compromise on the word
[1:07] and taking our our parents religion and
[1:10] staying in the denominational system and
[1:12] being attached to the things of the
[1:13] world and not for he goes to all of that
[1:16] to show how many ways we're not worthy
[1:18] of the Gospel but I want to know how am
[1:20] I going to be worthy of the Gospel how
[1:22] am I going to have a life worthy of the
[1:24] Gospel I know all the things I do wrong
[1:26] and I know all the things that will keep
[1:27] me from it but there's got to be
[1:29] something that will measure up and level
[1:31] up my
[1:33] life and there's only one thing I know
[1:35] of because the the these Deeds aren't
[1:38] going to do it none of them I can pile
[1:40] them on all day long I can go to church
[1:42] I can pay great M sums of money I can do
[1:45] all kinds of things it's not going to
[1:47] level it up but the only way it's going
[1:48] to level it up if I can get what's over
[1:51] here over here and when that comes in
[1:55] place now all of the sudden we've got
[1:57] Christ over here and we have Christ over
[2:02] here and that'll bring a balance in my
[2:04] life and make my life worthy of the
[2:08] [Applause]
[2:08] [Music]
[2:09] Gospel hallelujah it's not something I
[2:13] can just put on and do but it's
[2:14] something I surrender to but what's
[2:17] hindering Christ in my life all of these
[2:19] other things that are making me not
[2:21] worthy not taking up my Christ loving my
[2:24] life wanting to try out my yoke of oxen
[2:26] wanting to stay with my field wanting to
[2:28] stay with my family
[2:31] that's all hindering the move of Christ
[2:33] in my life and keeping me off
[2:37] balance God but what's it going to take
[2:40] an absolute complete surrender to the
[2:42] will of God and a laying down of my life
[2:45] completely and taking up my cross and
[2:47] following him so that the life that's on
[2:49] one side of this equation can move to
[2:51] the other side of the equation and bring
[2:54] a balance and now my life can be worthy
[2:57] of the Gospel why because of good Deeds
[3:00] because of good character because no
[3:02] because Christ in me the hope of glory
