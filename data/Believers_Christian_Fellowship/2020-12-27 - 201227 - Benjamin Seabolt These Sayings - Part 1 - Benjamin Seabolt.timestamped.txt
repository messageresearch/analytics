[4:10] let's just pray together
[4:13] precious lord jesus
[4:15] [Music]
[4:17] lord we just want to thank you for this
[4:19] opportunity that you've given us once
[4:20] again lord
[4:23] to come and to gather ourselves
[4:27] together around you lord
[4:30] the revealed word for our age
[4:33] lord we don't gather here around a man's
[4:37] idea or
[4:38] as a social event lord but we
[4:42] come to sing
[4:45] praises and to worship
[4:48] the one and the true living god
[4:52] lord and we're so grateful that the
[4:54] revelation that you
[4:55] have provided to us that we cannot come
[4:59] in vain and
[5:00] that we cannot just come blindly but we
[5:02] can
[5:03] come knowing what form
[5:06] you have chosen to appear in our age and
[5:09] that we can
[5:10] worship you truly in spirit
[5:13] and in truth lord we count that a great
[5:16] privilege and i pray that we would
[5:18] not take it for granted lord we would
[5:20] ask now as we would come to this part of
[5:22] the service that
[5:24] you would just come lord and do only
[5:27] that that you can do lord for the
[5:30] scripture says that no man
[5:33] was found worthy to take the book and to
[5:35] loose the seals
[5:37] lord but only little m was worthy father
[5:41] and we would ask now that you would come
[5:42] and you would take the book and that you
[5:45] would
[5:45] break the seals and feed your sheep lord
[5:48] we just commit all things into your
[5:50] hands in the name
[5:52] of the lord jesus christ amen
[5:55] god bless you if you have your bibles
[5:57] we'll turn to the book of john chapter
[6:00] 10
[6:01] and just greet you in the name of the
[6:02] lord jesus christ it's a
[6:04] privilege to be here with you this
[6:06] morning
[6:08] we're definitely sorry our pastor and
[6:10] his family
[6:11] could not be here we'll miss them dearly
[6:14] and we just pray that god will touch
[6:15] each and every one of them and restore
[6:17] them and
[6:18] just resolve that situation there that
[6:21] they can be back with us very very
[6:23] quickly
[6:25] just pray for remember brother emmanuel
[6:28] as well i'm assuming he'll be
[6:30] on his way back shortly from his trip so
[6:33] we just want to remember him
[6:35] and hold him up in prayer as well
[6:38] as we look here in the book of john
[6:42] chapter 10 we're going to start with
[6:45] verse number 1.
[6:48] jesus speaking he says verily verily i
[6:52] say unto you he that entereth not
[6:56] by the door into the sheepfold but
[6:59] climbeth up
[7:00] some other way the same as a thief
[7:03] and a robber then if we'll skip to verse
[7:06] 7
[7:08] then jesus said unto them again verily
[7:10] verily i say unto you
[7:12] i am the door of the sheep and skipping
[7:15] to verse 15
[7:18] jesus still speaking as the father
[7:21] knoweth me
[7:22] even so know i the father and i lay down
[7:25] my life
[7:26] for the sheep skipping to verse 19.
[7:31] there was a division therefore again
[7:33] among the jews
[7:35] for these sayings
[7:38] and that's what i want to talk on this
[7:40] morning
[7:41] is these sayings as you would have your
[7:44] seats
[7:49] if we'll continue down farther in that
[7:50] chapter we'll go to verse 24.
[7:54] then came the jews round about him and
[7:56] said unto him
[7:57] how long dost thou make us to doubt if
[8:00] thou be the christ
[8:02] tell us plainly jesus answered them
[8:05] i told you and you believe not the works
[8:08] that i do in my father's name
[8:10] they bear witness of me but ye believe
[8:13] not because you're not of my sheep
[8:16] as i said unto you my sheep hear my
[8:19] voice
[8:20] and i know them and they follow me and i
[8:23] give unto them eternal life and they
[8:25] will never perish
[8:27] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[8:29] my hand
[8:30] my father which gave them to me is
[8:33] greater than all
[8:34] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[8:36] my father's hand
[8:38] i and my father are one
[8:42] then the jews took up stones again to
[8:45] stone him
[8:48] so as we would come to this portion of
[8:50] scripture
[8:52] we can see in the early part in
[8:55] verse 19 that jesus is telling them that
[8:59] i
[8:59] am the door to the sheepfold and there
[9:02] is division
[9:04] from that saying and then as he moves
[9:06] farther down in the same
[9:08] in that chapter verse 30 he proclaims
[9:11] that i and my father are one
[9:13] and there's an immediate reaction to
[9:15] that
[9:17] and it's not a good one it's not
[9:21] let's debate this farther let's argue
[9:24] with this
[9:25] um let's see what angle you're saying
[9:28] that from
[9:29] but jesus proclaims a statement i and my
[9:33] father are one and the immediate
[9:36] reaction is to take up stones and kill
[9:38] him
[9:42] first john chapter four if you'll turn
[9:44] there with me
[9:50] first john chapter 4.
[10:00] beginning in verse 1 it says beloved
[10:03] believe not every spirit but
[10:06] try the spirits whether they are of god
[10:10] because many false prophets are going
[10:12] out into the world
[10:15] hereby know ye the spirit of god
[10:20] every spirit that confesseth that jesus
[10:24] christ
[10:25] is come in the flesh
[10:29] is of god and every spirit that
[10:32] confesseth
[10:33] not that jesus christ is come into flesh
[10:38] is not of god
[10:41] there's no wiggle room there
[10:46] you can have all the spiritual
[10:48] discernment in the world
[10:51] and it's all lame right here in three
[10:53] verses
[10:54] how to discern what is of god and what
[10:57] is not of god
[10:59] if it is a spirit that proclaimeth that
[11:01] jesus christ
[11:02] is come in the flesh that is
[11:05] of god if it would take away from that
[11:09] or
[11:09] deviate away from that in the slightest
[11:12] it is not of god very clear definition
[11:20] going back to the book of john chapter 7
[11:26] verse 37 john 7 37
[11:32] in the last day that great day of the
[11:34] feast jesus stood and cried saying
[11:36] if any man thirsts let him come unto me
[11:39] and drink
[11:40] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[11:42] hath said out of
[11:43] his belly shall flow rivers of living
[11:46] water
[11:47] and skipping to verse 43 so there was a
[11:51] division
[11:52] among the people because of him and
[11:55] some of them would have taken him but no
[11:58] man
[11:59] laid hands on him
[12:03] so i want to take those scriptures that
[12:05] we just read
[12:06] i want to talk i want to tie them to
[12:09] this quote
[12:10] out of the sea does not air with the
[12:12] shock 1965.
[12:15] brother branham said speaking here says
[12:18] jesus
[12:18] told us what would be in the last day it
[12:21] would be
[12:22] so close that they would deceive the
[12:23] very elected if possible
[12:25] but then the seed comes forth from there
[12:28] and the life leaves the shock
[12:32] and the shock is a carrier and that's
[12:35] just exactly what our denominations has
[12:37] been
[12:38] a carrier luther
[12:41] wesley pentecostal
[12:44] may i say message
[12:48] and now it's time for the seed to come
[12:51] forth
[12:52] mary was not the seed just
[12:55] a shuck tassel and stalk
[12:58] carriers of part of the word not all the
[13:02] word
[13:03] luther had justification
[13:07] wesley had sanctification pentecostals
[13:10] had the restoration of the gifts
[13:12] so you can see as brother branham
[13:14] speaking he's saying that they are
[13:16] shuck because they did not have all of
[13:18] the word
[13:22] luther wesley pentecostal
[13:26] if we don't think that there's been a
[13:28] message movement that does not have
[13:30] all of the world we're simply fooling
[13:32] ourself
[13:37] we have to understand
[13:40] the brother branham says every revival
[13:43] produces twins the bride's revival is
[13:47] included in that
[13:49] what is the bride's revival based around
[13:51] the message
[13:54] so we have to allow brother branham to
[13:57] say what brother branham says and
[13:58] whether it
[13:59] whether it's palatable or whether it
[14:01] fits our little
[14:03] box that we have or not we have to allow
[14:07] him to say these things and define these
[14:10] things
[14:13] so he's saying here that if you do not
[14:15] have all of the word
[14:17] you are shocked and he starts putting
[14:21] names to that
[14:22] luther wesley pentecostals but the
[14:25] definition that he gave to that was they
[14:27] did not have
[14:28] all of the word
[14:36] now they could produce that
[14:37] justification will save a man
[14:39] you believe that sure it was a carrier
[14:42] of the word
[14:43] just the same as i believe the stalk is
[14:45] part of the wheat
[14:46] sure it is but it's the carrier it ain't
[14:50] the life
[14:51] then along comes sanctification how many
[14:54] believes in sanctification
[14:55] you believe the bible you have to sure
[14:58] so
[14:58] still that's not it but then came the
[15:01] pentecost the restoration of the gifts
[15:04] speaking in tongues there they called
[15:06] that the initial evidence which brought
[15:08] forth what
[15:09] the shock but they denominated
[15:13] but when you come to say i
[15:16] and my father are one and these
[15:19] other things then the shock pulls away
[15:23] from it
[15:24] but the real genuine bride church will
[15:27] bring forth the
[15:28] entire word of god in its fullness
[15:32] and in its strength for he's the same
[15:34] yesterday
[15:35] today and forever
[15:39] so brother branham is is preaching here
[15:41] and he is laying down
[15:43] definitions of what is seed and what is
[15:46] shuck
[15:47] what is seed and what is shock and he's
[15:50] given us a definition here that shuck is
[15:52] anything that is not all of the word but
[15:55] he also comes along and he says but the
[15:57] real
[15:58] genuine bride church will bring forth
[16:00] the entire word of god
[16:02] and the sentence that he said right
[16:04] before that
[16:05] is when you come to say that i and my
[16:08] father
[16:09] are one and these other things then the
[16:12] shock pulls away from it
[16:14] so that very very clearly
[16:18] identifies that the shock is incapable
[16:21] of the revelation i and my father are
[16:24] one
[16:35] i should have warned you before i
[16:36] started but i intend to go very slow
[16:38] today
[16:40] i intend to take my time and we're going
[16:43] to
[16:44] nail this down we're not going to get
[16:46] done today
[16:48] but my intention is to lay a very wide
[16:51] firm foundation
[16:53] we'll touch on a couple things and then
[16:55] we'll pick this up some other date lord
[16:57] willing
[16:58] but it's imperative that i lay this
[17:01] foundation because without it the rest
[17:03] of
[17:04] anything that i'm going to say is
[17:05] totally in vain
[17:09] in the church age book brother random
[17:11] says very familiar quote
[17:13] very familiar he knows speaking of satan
[17:17] he knows that if the people get the true
[17:20] revelation of the true church and what
[17:25] she is
[17:28] what she stands for and that she can do
[17:30] the greater works
[17:32] she will be an invincible army if they
[17:34] get a true
[17:36] revelation of the two spirits within the
[17:39] framework
[17:41] of the christian church shuck
[17:44] and seed and by god's spirit
[17:47] discern and withstand the antichrist
[17:50] spirit
[17:51] satan will be powerless before her he
[17:54] will be as
[17:55] definitely sordid today as when christ
[17:58] withstood his
[17:59] every effort to gain power over him in
[18:01] the desert
[18:03] yes satan hates revelation but we love
[18:06] it
[18:06] with true revelation in our lives
[18:10] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[18:13] us but we will prevail
[18:16] over them
[18:19] the key to that was if they get the true
[18:23] revelation of the two spirits within the
[18:26] framework
[18:28] of the christian church
[18:33] this is the point that i want to make
[18:36] usually you save your point for last
[18:38] but i have to give my point first
[18:40] because if i don't give my point first
[18:41] anything that i say you're going to take
[18:43] it wrong
[18:46] the two spirits within the framework
[18:50] of the christian church is what we must
[18:53] be able to discern
[18:55] the question is what is the framework
[18:59] of the christian church and where
[19:03] do we put that at because here's what
[19:06] i'll tell you
[19:07] if you put that anywhere besides where
[19:11] you're sitting at this morning
[19:13] you've missed it
[19:17] and you'll continue to miss it if you
[19:20] put that antichrist
[19:22] spirit in another message church
[19:25] somewhere else because they don't preach
[19:26] a doctrine exactly like you see it
[19:28] you've missed it if you put that
[19:31] antichrist spirit somewhere in the
[19:33] economical
[19:34] world if i can see good working here bad
[19:36] working here
[19:37] you've missed it if you can put that in
[19:40] the political world
[19:41] of this person stands for this this is
[19:43] true this is right but this is
[19:45] antichrist because they're standing
[19:46] against this
[19:47] you've missed it if you can see that in
[19:50] the denominational realms
[19:55] you've missed it if you can see that
[19:59] in the ranks of the message
[20:01] congratulations
[20:02] you've still missed it if you can see
[20:06] that in the person sitting beside of you
[20:09] that's great it's still pointless
[20:13] you say well i would like some authority
[20:15] of that okay
[20:16] there were 12 disciples one of them was
[20:19] a devil
[20:20] two of them knew who that devil was the
[20:23] scripture says
[20:25] they all forsook him
[20:29] peter and john knowing who judas was
[20:33] still did not keep them
[20:37] the only thing that will keep you is the
[20:40] only thing that would have kept
[20:41] them and the only thing that would have
[20:43] kept them is what they got at pentecost
[20:46] a true revelation of themselves
[20:52] they got a true revelation of the
[20:55] antichrist spirit working in the
[20:57] framework
[20:58] of their church your framework is
[21:02] your soul your spirit and your flesh
[21:05] that is the framework within that
[21:08] framework
[21:09] there is seed and everything else is
[21:11] shock
[21:12] your hybrid spirit and your hybrid flesh
[21:15] is
[21:16] shuck one has to go and be no more
[21:19] one the atoms have to change the only
[21:23] part of you that is seed is the seed
[21:27] that is in your soul
[21:30] your hybrid spirit and your flesh
[21:34] will spend every waking and every
[21:36] sleeping moment of its
[21:38] life contradicting what your soul and
[21:41] what your seed is telling you
[21:44] that's its job it's hybrid
[21:47] it's of its father the devil it is the
[21:51] author of lies
[21:55] it is so crafty that it will do the same
[21:57] thing that the serpent did
[21:59] and the serpent when it came to eve
[22:01] remember it didn't come with a lie
[22:02] first what it did is it started building
[22:05] her confidence in him
[22:07] by telling her the truth telling her the
[22:09] truth telling her the truth
[22:10] and then there was a slight deviation
[22:14] your spirit realm will do the exact same
[22:18] thing to you
[22:20] it will agree with this message it will
[22:22] agree with this scripture it will agree
[22:24] with this spirit
[22:25] and it will agree with things for six
[22:27] days in a row
[22:28] just for one opportunity on day number
[22:30] seven to bring a slight deviation to
[22:32] that
[22:35] and if you have your eyes focused on
[22:39] trying to discern the antichrist spirit
[22:41] in the person beside of you within the
[22:44] ranks of the message
[22:45] within the ranks of the denominations in
[22:48] the political realm and the economic
[22:50] realm at the people at work
[22:53] you will totally miss
[22:56] that trap when it comes your way
[23:00] we have to bring the focus where it
[23:04] needs to be
[23:07] and in all reality just think about it
[23:09] for a second
[23:12] say you are able to discern all of that
[23:15] in all of those other ranks and in all
[23:17] of those other realms
[23:19] what good does that do you
[23:22] if you don't at the end of the day know
[23:25] who you are
[23:27] and if you can't say
[23:31] i and my father are one
[23:36] see you can say
[23:39] that person and his brother and his
[23:43] pastor
[23:43] and his mother they are not of the
[23:46] father
[23:49] and you may be right you may be right
[23:53] but how does that change your atoms
[23:57] what does that profit you what good
[24:01] does that really do you at the end of
[24:02] the day
[24:04] at the end of the day what good did it
[24:07] do
[24:07] john and peter to know who judas was
[24:12] they still forsook him judas went and
[24:15] hung himself
[24:16] it took care of itself it never profited
[24:19] john
[24:19] or peter to know who it was did jesus
[24:22] reveal it to him sure he revealed it to
[24:24] him
[24:25] but just because he revealed something
[24:27] to him doesn't mean that we need to
[24:29] hinge on that
[24:30] doesn't mean that that is the focus
[24:31] doesn't mean that that's the most
[24:33] important part
[24:36] what they needed to know
[24:40] was who they were that's what they
[24:43] needed to know and that's what we need
[24:45] to know
[24:46] because if we're going to
[24:49] do the greater works if we're going to
[24:53] be
[24:53] an invincible army if we're
[24:57] if we're going to do that it's going to
[25:01] be because we
[25:02] have a true revelation of the two
[25:05] spirits
[25:06] within our own framework
[25:13] we have to have god's spirit
[25:16] to discern ourselves
[25:20] you cannot use your own spirit to
[25:22] discern yourself because as i just said
[25:24] it will spend
[25:24] six days in a row discerning things
[25:27] correctly
[25:28] just to set you up for a slight
[25:29] deviation one day
[25:32] we have to allow god's spirit to discern
[25:36] the antichrist spirit within our own
[25:38] framework
[25:39] see if you had if you had just a
[25:42] pure human spirit there wouldn't be an
[25:45] issue with your
[25:46] with your discernment but we don't have
[25:49] a pure
[25:50] human spirit it's a hybrid human spirit
[25:53] it's already mixed brother branham said
[25:56] it
[25:56] it came and it came with a sensual
[25:58] nature
[26:02] your spirit realm your memory your
[26:04] reason your conscience imagination and
[26:06] affection
[26:08] is the author of lies it's
[26:11] of the father the devil it
[26:14] will deceive you every opportunity that
[26:18] gets
[26:19] and i assure you one thing that it will
[26:21] never say
[26:23] it will never say is that you and your
[26:26] father are the same
[26:30] it will never declare that to you
[26:35] your flesh will definitely never declare
[26:36] that to you
[26:41] romans 7 verse 12 paul speaking
[26:46] wherefore the law is holy and the
[26:48] commandment holy and just and good
[26:51] was then that which is good made death
[26:53] unto me
[26:54] basically saying that the word is true
[26:56] but i can't keep the word so it's
[26:58] nothing but death to me
[27:00] he says god forbid but sin
[27:03] that it might appear sin worketh death
[27:05] in me by that which is good that
[27:07] sin by the commandment might become
[27:09] exceedingly sinful
[27:12] meaning the word is going to reveal sin
[27:14] making it very clear
[27:16] this is sinful for we
[27:19] know that the law is spiritual but i am
[27:22] carnal sold under sin
[27:24] for that which i would do i allow not
[27:28] for what i would that do i not
[27:32] but what i hate that i do sounds like
[27:35] paul has a problem
[27:37] sounds like paul had a hybrid human
[27:39] spirit
[27:42] same as me and you if then i do that
[27:46] which i would not i consent unto the law
[27:48] that it is good
[27:50] now then it is no more i that do it but
[27:53] sin that dwelleth in me
[27:55] sounds like paul is discerning the
[27:57] antichrist spirit within the framework
[27:58] of the church
[28:01] for i know that in me that is in my
[28:04] flesh
[28:05] dwelleth no good thing for to will is
[28:08] present with me but how to perform that
[28:10] which is good i find not
[28:12] for the good that i would do i do not
[28:15] but the evil which i would do that i
[28:18] that i would not do that i do
[28:22] now if i do that i would not
[28:25] it is no more i that do it but sin
[28:28] that dwelleth in me sounds like paul is
[28:31] coming to a revelation that his soul was
[28:34] not lining up with his spirit
[28:37] and he's got a problem with that and
[28:39] he's recognizing
[28:40] i want you to take another angle when
[28:42] we're reading the scripture this is not
[28:44] about
[28:44] conduct i'll say this
[28:47] this is not just about conduct
[28:50] this is about paul's revelation paul
[28:54] is wanting to have a revelation of
[28:56] something of himself
[28:58] and he's saying my hybrid spirit and
[29:00] flesh is not lining up with that
[29:03] because what my soul declares is good
[29:06] but my hybrid spirit and flesh is not
[29:08] lining up with that does that manifest
[29:10] itself in conduct sure
[29:12] but it has to start in the inner man
[29:15] for if i do that i would not it is no
[29:18] more
[29:18] i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
[29:21] i find then a law that when i would do
[29:24] good
[29:24] evil is present with me
[29:28] for i delight in the law of god after
[29:30] the inward man
[29:31] but i see another law in my members
[29:33] warring against the law of my mind
[29:35] and bringing me into captivity to the
[29:38] law of sin which
[29:39] is in my members notice where paul is
[29:42] placing this
[29:43] he is not placing this in the pharisees
[29:45] or the sadducees or the scribes or the
[29:47] whoever paul is saying
[29:50] i have got a problem i paul
[29:54] have got a problem
[29:58] o wretched man that i am
[30:02] who shall deliver me from this body of
[30:04] death
[30:06] i thank god through jesus christ our
[30:08] lord
[30:09] so then with the mind i myself serve the
[30:12] law of god but with the flesh
[30:14] the law of sin moving to chapter 8
[30:18] there is therefore now no condemnation
[30:20] to them which are in christ
[30:22] jesus who walk not after the flesh
[30:25] but after the spirit sounds like the
[30:27] light is starting to shine with paul
[30:29] he's starting to discern the within the
[30:32] framework of the christian church
[30:35] the two spirits for the law of the
[30:38] spirit of life in christ jesus hath
[30:40] made me free from the law of sin and
[30:42] death
[30:43] for what the law could not do in that it
[30:46] was weak through the flesh
[30:47] god sending his own son in the likeness
[30:50] of sinful flesh
[30:51] and for sin condemned sin
[30:54] in the flesh that the righteousness of
[30:57] the law might be fulfilled in
[30:59] us who walk not after the flesh but
[31:02] after the spirit
[31:04] for they that are after the flesh do
[31:06] mind the things of the flesh
[31:07] but they that are after the spirit the
[31:09] things of the spirit
[31:11] for to be carnally minded is death
[31:14] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[31:17] peace
[31:18] because the carnal mind is enmity
[31:21] against god notice it does not say the
[31:25] evil mind
[31:27] or the wicked mind or the satanic mind
[31:30] it says the carnal mind
[31:32] your hybrid human mind
[31:37] that will lead you at work every day
[31:40] allow you to work allow you to reason
[31:44] and fought and solve problems
[31:47] allow you to have a memory so that you
[31:50] don't make the same mistakes again or
[31:52] that you know how to do something
[31:54] the next time that you are presented
[31:55] with that
[31:57] see it works it works good things all
[32:01] the time
[32:03] just so you'll start trusting it
[32:06] the same way satan says is it not
[32:08] written
[32:09] is it not also didn't he also didn't he
[32:11] say that you could eat of every tree
[32:16] it will build your trust in it
[32:20] just to let you down
[32:24] even if it's one time in your life
[32:28] even your hybrid spirit
[32:32] will allow you to place trust in it
[32:35] by acting correctly by acting good and
[32:38] by doing good things
[32:41] it will allow you to place trust in it
[32:44] all the way up until the point that you
[32:46] want to say i and my father are one
[32:49] even if it never even if it never lets
[32:51] you down before that
[32:52] if you're like me it lets you down way
[32:54] before that
[32:55] many many times but even
[32:59] if it would act let's say it this way
[33:03] even if it would be a good boy up until
[33:05] that time
[33:07] when it comes to that time it will let
[33:09] you down
[33:10] and that's the only time that it really
[33:12] cares about
[33:13] because it does not care what other
[33:16] revelation you have
[33:18] until you begin to have the revelation
[33:20] that i
[33:21] and my father are one that's when it
[33:24] realizes it has a problem
[33:26] and that's when it'll start saying
[33:28] things like well
[33:29] surely you won't die
[33:34] sure surely not surely you won't die
[33:38] because the carnal mind is enmity
[33:41] against god we just have to come to
[33:44] terms with that
[33:45] we have just got to become comfortable
[33:47] with that
[33:49] that within me lays no good thing
[33:55] for it is not subject to the law of god
[33:58] neither
[33:58] indeed can be
[34:02] quit trying to convert your your hybrid
[34:05] spirit
[34:06] it's not going to happen brother brandon
[34:09] says it has to go and be no more
[34:12] it is not convertible it is hybrid
[34:15] it is of the father the devil and it
[34:18] will it is the
[34:19] author of lies
[34:22] so now i want to go back to where we
[34:24] started
[34:27] in john 10 verse 19 it says there was
[34:29] division
[34:31] therefore among the jews for these
[34:34] sayings this is immediately after jesus
[34:37] told them
[34:37] i am the door to the sheepfold
[34:41] now there's a division there wasn't a
[34:44] division before that
[34:46] and look at all the miraculous
[34:46] miraculous that jesus was doing
[34:50] look at everything that he said before
[34:51] that but now when it comes to john
[34:54] chapter 10
[34:55] jesus makes a declaration and this
[34:58] declaration causes division
[35:02] all he said was i am the door to the
[35:03] sheepfold
[35:05] i mean that's a pretty simple statement
[35:07] he never even said anything about them
[35:09] he just said i am the door to the
[35:10] sheepfold
[35:12] but you see what happens is when you
[35:14] begin to say that
[35:16] you say the same thing that abel said to
[35:18] cain in the garden
[35:21] abel just told cain who he was
[35:25] and cain recognized that if what he's
[35:28] saying is true
[35:32] that means we don't have the same father
[35:37] and i would venture to say there was a
[35:38] bit of a division in the garden
[35:41] there was a division and i know there
[35:43] was a division because the reaction was
[35:45] the exact same
[35:46] to what jesus had as soon as jesus
[35:50] said this i and my father
[35:53] are one the reaction is always
[35:56] the same they pick up a
[36:00] stone and try to kill you
[36:04] that's what happened in the garden
[36:07] i would say after they got that's what
[36:09] happened when they got kicked out of the
[36:10] garden we know
[36:11] you understand what i'm saying that i'll
[36:12] put it this way that's what happened in
[36:14] genesis
[36:16] that's what happened in genesis that's
[36:19] what happened
[36:20] when jesus was here on the scene and
[36:22] that's what's going to happen in the
[36:24] book of revelation
[36:28] now we can know that and we can see that
[36:30] and we can say amen
[36:31] but unless you realize that your
[36:34] human your hybrid spirit and your flesh
[36:37] does the exact same thing to you it's
[36:40] pointless to see the rest of that
[36:43] because when you come to say i
[36:46] and my father are one your hybrid human
[36:50] spirit will immediately do the same
[36:52] thing
[36:53] and it will pick up a stone of its own
[36:55] revelation
[36:57] usually out of your memory and it will
[37:01] kill that revelation it will
[37:04] stone it to death
[37:07] and if it don't pick it up out of its
[37:08] memory back it will pick it up out of
[37:10] its reasoning back
[37:12] and it will reason that to death with
[37:15] its
[37:16] own stone of revelation from your
[37:18] reasoning
[37:19] if that doesn't work it'll go over to
[37:21] its little bag of conscience
[37:23] and it'll pick up a big rock out of
[37:25] there and it will kill
[37:27] that revelation that you and your father
[37:29] are one
[37:33] see you can see it back in genesis
[37:36] you can see it when jesus was here
[37:39] you can see it in the book of revelation
[37:43] but unless we can see it right here
[37:47] it does us no good
[37:50] we brother branham says said
[37:54] when you begin to say i
[37:57] and the father are one and these other
[38:00] things
[38:02] the shock will pull away
[38:06] now i'm not
[38:09] i'm not so naive to try to tell you all
[38:13] that there's not a denominational shock
[38:15] that there's not shock within the ranks
[38:17] of the message i mean we've seen those
[38:18] movements we've seen those things
[38:21] who cares who cares
[38:25] if the church down the road or if the
[38:26] church across the state or the church
[38:29] across the country is wrong who cares
[38:34] if you yourself are wrong
[38:37] what good does it what good does it do
[38:39] us to know if somebody else is wrong
[38:41] if we can't discern that we're wrong
[38:44] because brother branham says
[38:47] when you begin to say i and the father
[38:48] are one
[38:50] and these other things the shock will
[38:51] pull away and if we
[38:54] don't have the right definition of
[38:58] shock
[39:00] then the whole point the whole thing is
[39:02] pointless
[39:05] what difference does it matter if you
[39:07] say i and my father are one
[39:09] and the church down the road don't
[39:10] believe that if the church across the
[39:12] state doesn't believe that
[39:14] if the church across the country doesn't
[39:15] believe that if you're if the guy at
[39:17] work doesn't believe that
[39:20] what good does that do if you really
[39:22] don't believe it
[39:25] if your hybrid human spirit can talk you
[39:27] out of that can
[39:28] can reason that away from you can pick
[39:31] something up out of your memory and
[39:32] cause you to doubt that
[39:35] what good does it do you to know and
[39:37] discern everywhere else
[39:40] none so when we read that quote
[39:44] and we get excited yeah when i begin to
[39:46] say i and my father are one the shucks
[39:48] going to pull away
[39:49] yeah they're going to be exposed they're
[39:51] really going to get it then
[39:53] you've missed it i've missed it
[39:58] that's not the shock that we're
[39:59] concerned about pulling away
[40:02] because all of that can pull away and it
[40:05] still doesn't change your atoms
[40:08] just because everybody else falls away
[40:10] does not mean that your atoms change
[40:12] the only thing that will change your my
[40:14] atoms is the revelation that i
[40:16] and my father are one without doubt but
[40:19] a
[40:19] perfect revelation of that
[40:24] so when we read that quote and he says
[40:27] when you begin to say i and my father
[40:29] are one of these other things and the
[40:30] shock will pull away
[40:33] we have to bring that home and we have
[40:35] to make sure that we're putting that
[40:37] shock where that shuck is supposed to be
[40:39] and where it will do us some good
[40:47] going back to first john
[40:52] chapter 4 beloved believe not every
[40:54] spirit
[40:55] but try the spirits whether they are of
[40:57] god
[41:00] don't put those spirits somewhere else
[41:06] beloved believed not everything
[41:09] your spirit tells you
[41:12] believe not everything your mind tells
[41:15] you
[41:18] try your spirit try your mind
[41:21] try your thoughts
[41:24] whether they are of god because
[41:27] many false prophets many false sayings
[41:33] are going out through your mind
[41:37] they are going out into the world hereby
[41:40] know ye the spirit of god
[41:42] every spirit that confesseth that jesus
[41:45] christ
[41:46] is come in my flesh is of god
[41:51] and every spirit that confess confesseth
[41:54] not
[41:54] that jesus christ has come in my flesh
[41:57] is not of the is not of god
[42:01] that's the discernment that we must have
[42:06] john chapter 7.
[42:10] we just read this i want to reread verse
[42:13] 43
[42:15] early emphasis on verse 43 john chapter
[42:18] 7 the last day of the feast jesus stood
[42:20] and cried saying if any man thirst let
[42:23] him come unto me and drink
[42:26] he that believeth on me this scripture
[42:28] hath said out of
[42:29] his belly shall flow rivers of living
[42:32] water
[42:33] and then in 43 so there was division
[42:36] among the people because of him watch
[42:39] the reaction
[42:41] and some of them would have taken him
[42:45] but no man laid hands on him they
[42:48] weren't taking him to take him out to
[42:50] lunch
[42:52] they weren't wanting to lay hands on him
[42:54] to say
[42:55] good message they weren't wanting to
[43:00] take him to invite him over for some
[43:02] fellowship
[43:03] he made a statement that if you're
[43:05] thirsty if any man thirst let him come
[43:07] to me
[43:13] by default what does that mean of them
[43:18] they've got no water
[43:22] see they didn't they wouldn't have had a
[43:24] problem
[43:26] if he would have said
[43:29] if any man thirst come
[43:32] but he said come to me
[43:37] they didn't have a problem if jesus
[43:38] would have said
[43:40] i am a way i am
[43:43] a truth i am a light
[43:47] that wouldn't have been a problem
[43:50] but that's not what he said and that's
[43:53] not what we can say
[43:56] you saying that will never convert
[43:58] anybody
[43:59] but when you come to say i and the
[44:01] father are one
[44:03] and these other things the shock will
[44:06] pull away
[44:08] not only will it pull away in your life
[44:13] but if you are trying to convert
[44:15] somebody at work
[44:17] at school at home you will never convert
[44:21] that person
[44:22] with any other revelation with
[44:25] i am a truth i am a
[44:28] way i am a life
[44:32] never work it is the way
[44:36] the only way the only truth and the only
[44:40] life
[44:41] that's what they had a problem with
[44:42] jesus saying and when jesus stood and
[44:44] said if any man thirst let him come to
[44:46] me
[44:49] that was the same thing as telling them
[44:51] who their father was
[44:53] and they had the same reaction we're
[44:56] going to lay hands on him
[44:57] we're going to take him out
[45:10] so now that we have what i would feel is
[45:14] a proper understanding
[45:16] of what we need to focus on where we
[45:19] need to focus
[45:21] [Music]
[45:23] where and who we need to be saying these
[45:26] other things too
[45:29] we can move forward but if we move
[45:32] forward
[45:33] without truly understanding without
[45:36] truly comprehending
[45:37] and without the focus being where it
[45:39] needs to be
[45:41] we're going to find ourselves in the
[45:43] same place that john and peter did
[45:45] even knowing who judas was
[45:48] we're just going to forsake our
[45:49] revelation we're going to flee from it
[45:52] we have to put the emphasis and the
[45:55] focus
[45:56] where it needs to be greatest battle
[45:58] ever fought brother branham says this
[46:00] first great battle
[46:01] that was ever fought began in heaven
[46:02] when michael and his angels fought
[46:04] against lucifer and his angels
[46:06] it first started the first battle was in
[46:08] heaven so sin did not originate on earth
[46:10] it originated in heaven we're very
[46:12] familiar with this
[46:13] and then it was thrown down from heaven
[46:15] cast out of heaven to the earth and fell
[46:17] on human beings
[46:18] then the battle from angels became human
[46:20] battles
[46:21] and satan came to destroy god's creation
[46:24] what god had created to be for himself
[46:27] he had satan came to destroy this
[46:30] that's what his purpose was was to
[46:31] destroy it then the battle began
[46:34] here on earth and begin in
[46:37] us and has been raging ever since
[46:41] it came from heaven came to earth and
[46:44] ended up
[46:45] where not in the political realm
[46:48] is it there sure do we care about that
[46:51] no
[46:52] not in the denominational realm is it
[46:54] there yes do we care about that
[46:56] no is it in the ranks of the message
[46:59] sure do we care about that no he says
[47:02] it begin in us
[47:07] and has been raging ever since the last
[47:10] place that the prophet put this battle
[47:12] was in me and you and he never said it
[47:14] went anywhere else
[47:18] don't by our own revelation and by our
[47:22] own
[47:22] knowledge that this message has given us
[47:24] don't try to take that and put the
[47:26] battle somewhere else
[47:27] it doesn't matter the prophet put it in
[47:32] me and you
[47:33] and that's where we have to leave it
[47:35] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[47:37] brother brandon says it's an
[47:38] individual one person all hell is
[47:41] against this teaching
[47:42] what teaching
[47:46] it's an individual one person
[47:49] all hell is against this teaching all
[47:52] hell is against this truth but it
[47:54] is the truth jesus never said now peter
[47:57] and john and all the rest of the people
[47:58] you've got the revelation
[48:00] now the whole church is saved no it was
[48:03] to
[48:03] him personally i say unto
[48:07] thee not them to thee
[48:10] thou art peter and upon this rock i'll
[48:12] build my church
[48:13] there it is the revelation not to them
[48:17] but to him an individual
[48:20] not a group an individual all
[48:24] hell is against it
[48:28] bring that present tense
[48:32] peter could have had the revelation of
[48:34] who was right and who was wrong within
[48:35] the ranks of the message
[48:37] who was right and who was wrong within
[48:39] the pews of your local church
[48:41] who was right and who was wrong within
[48:42] your own little house
[48:45] at home hell don't care
[48:50] hell does not care
[48:54] the revelation that hell cares about
[48:59] is in you as an individual
[49:04] ephesians two verse one and you hath he
[49:07] quickened who were dead in sin and
[49:08] trespasses
[49:10] wherein time passed ye walked according
[49:12] to the course of this world according to
[49:14] the prince of the power of the air the
[49:15] spirit that now worketh in the children
[49:17] of disobedience
[49:18] among whom also we had our conver we all
[49:21] had our conversations in times past
[49:24] in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the
[49:26] desires of the flesh
[49:28] and of the mind where's the battle at
[49:32] in the flesh and in the mind and we're
[49:34] by
[49:35] nature the children of wrath even as
[49:38] others but god who is rich in mercy
[49:43] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[49:46] even when we were dead in sins
[49:48] hath quickened us together with christ
[49:51] by grace
[49:52] are ye saved so if you can see
[49:55] the antichrist spirit working in the
[49:57] economical realm and in the political
[49:59] realm and in the denominational realm
[50:00] and in the ranks of the message
[50:02] and in the pubic side of you and in your
[50:03] own local house congratulations
[50:11] it's only by grace you're saved and not
[50:14] in those realms
[50:16] don't get lifted up in that revelation
[50:19] because it's by grace you can see that
[50:22] and if you can see all of that and you
[50:24] still don't have enough grace to see it
[50:26] within yourself it will do you no good
[50:31] i have a certain amount of times that i
[50:33] have to say that i'm keeping count
[50:38] first corinthians 9 verse 26
[50:43] i therefore so run paul speaking not as
[50:46] uncertainty
[50:47] so fight i not as one that beateth the
[50:50] air
[50:51] paul's saying i am very focused on what
[50:54] i'm fighting here
[50:55] i'm very focused on this race that i'm
[50:58] running
[51:00] but i keep under my body
[51:04] and bring it unto subjection lest that
[51:06] by
[51:07] any means when i have preached to others
[51:11] i myself should be a castaway
[51:16] even the apostle paul was preaching this
[51:19] get your eyes off everybody else get it
[51:23] to where the real battle is
[51:25] and fight that battle with certainty
[51:28] deal
[51:28] with your hybrid human spirit and deal
[51:30] with your flesh
[51:32] and quit worrying about anything else
[51:35] that's the shock that needs to pull away
[51:39] that's what matters
[51:43] all right we're 44 minutes in i've met
[51:46] my quota of saying
[51:47] that it will do you no good let's begin
[51:50] with
[51:51] with the first thing that
[51:55] that lays in the scriptures because
[51:56] brother branham says
[51:58] when you come to say i and my father are
[52:00] one
[52:01] and these other things
[52:05] the shock will pull away and we
[52:08] were very familiar with this quote and
[52:11] our pastor actually preached a message
[52:13] on these other things
[52:16] but it was several months ago he was
[52:18] ministering not not in that
[52:20] message that he titled these other
[52:21] things it was a different message but
[52:23] he's ministering he's preaching and he's
[52:24] and he reads this quote
[52:27] and he's he makes the statement he says
[52:28] i wish i would have he would have
[52:30] expounded and told us what those other
[52:32] things were because that's what i would
[52:33] be preaching
[52:35] and i'm sitting in my seat and i was
[52:36] like yes me too wouldn't that be great
[52:38] if he just gave us a list
[52:39] because that's what i would preach to
[52:41] and as i was sitting there
[52:43] i would just say a voice spoke to me it
[52:45] wasn't audible but a voice spoke to me
[52:47] and says he's already preaching it and
[52:49] he doesn't realize it
[52:52] and i know that wasn't my thought
[52:54] because my thought was saying yes i wish
[52:56] he would have left me a list that way i
[52:58] could preach it too
[52:59] and as that thought is coming this
[53:01] thought if you want to say overrides
[53:03] that and it says he's
[53:04] already preaching it and doesn't realize
[53:06] it
[53:07] no i don't say that so that you think
[53:08] i'm spiritual then i hear voices
[53:10] or whatever i'm sure we've all
[53:13] experienced those
[53:14] things but to me it was significant
[53:16] because god was trying to draw my
[53:18] attention to something
[53:19] we are doing something and not even
[53:22] realizing that we're that we're doing it
[53:26] but he's wanting us to realize what
[53:29] we're doing now
[53:30] he's wanting us he's wanting to draw
[53:33] attention to
[53:33] what are we really doing but that
[53:37] happened during that service and that
[53:38] was all that happened during that
[53:39] service he never gave me the list
[53:41] and he never told me how he was doing it
[53:42] and not realizing it so i was just as
[53:44] clueless as
[53:45] basically before i heard the voice
[53:48] but i just began pondering on that and i
[53:50] knew that if god
[53:52] would say something like that that there
[53:54] was a purpose for it
[53:55] and he's wanting to reveal something but
[53:58] god will do that this is just a little
[53:59] sidebar but
[54:01] i'm sure you all have experienced this
[54:02] god will do that in our lives
[54:04] and he will drop a revelation in there
[54:06] of something just to see what we'll do
[54:08] with it and
[54:10] most of the time this is just my opinion
[54:12] you take it for what it's worth
[54:14] most of the time i believe he's laying
[54:16] that there to
[54:17] see if we will force the issue
[54:20] he's laying that there to see if we will
[54:23] interpret
[54:24] that or if we will figure try to figure
[54:27] that out or if we
[54:28] will put our own definition to that
[54:32] because it would have been very easy for
[54:34] me to say okay well god said chad was
[54:36] already doing it he just doesn't realize
[54:37] it so let's go pull all the messages
[54:38] that chad
[54:39] has preached and let's figure out what
[54:40] he's what he's preached that are these
[54:42] other things
[54:44] see you can take a humanistic effort
[54:46] towards it
[54:47] and it'll do you no good but i didn't i
[54:50] just said well
[54:51] praise god he's doing it he doesn't
[54:53] realize it and i don't realize it
[54:54] but praise god we're doing it and if god
[54:57] wants us to realize something then he'll
[54:58] reveal it
[55:00] but several weeks went by and then
[55:03] i don't remember what i was doing but it
[55:04] just hit me
[55:06] brother branham says that when we when
[55:09] you begin to say
[55:11] i and the father are one and these other
[55:15] things
[55:15] the shock will pull away and when he
[55:18] says i am the father of one and these
[55:20] other things
[55:22] that is that is implying
[55:25] similar things
[55:29] it's implying similar things a similar
[55:32] statement i and the father are one and a
[55:35] similar statement the shuck will pull
[55:37] away
[55:39] it was just like a light bulb went off
[55:40] what else
[55:42] did jesus say that caused division
[55:45] and when that went off then it was right
[55:46] there it's all through the scriptures
[55:48] it was it was just like a flow chart
[55:52] number one luke 2 verse 46.
[56:03] when you begin to say i and the father
[56:05] are one
[56:07] and these other things the shuck will
[56:09] pull away
[56:11] we've properly identified what
[56:14] the real shock is that we need to be
[56:17] concerned about
[56:18] and this is not somebody else saying i
[56:20] and the father one but this is
[56:22] you saying i and the father are one
[56:26] that will and these other things that
[56:29] will cause your hybrid human spirit
[56:31] and your flesh to pull away from that
[56:34] seed
[56:36] luke 2 46 and it came to pass that after
[56:39] these days they found him in the temple
[56:40] speaking of jesus
[56:42] sitting in the midst of the doctors both
[56:44] hearing them and asking them questions
[56:48] and all that heard him were astonished
[56:49] at his understanding and answers
[56:52] and when they saw him they were amazed
[56:53] and his mother said unto him
[56:55] son why hast thou thus dealt with us
[56:59] behold thy father and i have sought thee
[57:02] sorrowing
[57:04] and he said unto them how is it
[57:07] that ye sought me
[57:11] wisty not that i must be about my
[57:13] father's business
[57:15] from what i can tell these are the first
[57:18] recorded words of jesus christ that we
[57:20] have in the scripture
[57:21] of the human jesus christ from what i
[57:24] can tell
[57:24] this is the first words recorded that we
[57:27] have of him
[57:29] and in jesus's first words that are
[57:31] recorded in the scripture
[57:34] he says how is it that ye
[57:38] sought me
[57:42] he immediately corrects the error as
[57:44] brother branham told us
[57:46] he immediately corrects the error now
[57:48] here's what i want to tell you
[57:50] don't let my really large 45-minute
[57:53] foundation go to waste
[57:55] and leave this at mary
[57:58] or i'll go back and lay another
[58:00] 45-minute foundation
[58:04] and make you do jumping jacks while
[58:05] we're doing it
[58:07] don't leave this at mary
[58:11] he said unto them how is it that ye
[58:14] sought me
[58:18] know you not that i must be about my
[58:20] father's business
[58:23] brother brandt says what is the father's
[58:24] business we're going to get to that here
[58:26] in a second he says what is the father's
[58:27] business
[58:28] is to seek and to save the lost sheep
[58:32] and here comes me and you to jesus
[58:37] lord why is this happening to me
[58:41] don't you know that i believe your
[58:43] prophet don't you know that i've stood
[58:45] for your prophet
[58:46] don't you know that i believe this
[58:48] message and i've stood for it
[58:52] he says hang on
[58:56] how how is it that ye sought me
[59:00] this is not this is not what you have
[59:03] done
[59:05] you you've stood for my for my prophet
[59:08] you've stood for my message
[59:10] how do you even think you were able to
[59:12] stand for my prophet and for my message
[59:16] let alone the revelation that me and you
[59:18] are one
[59:20] how do as as we would say time out
[59:25] just time out for a second how
[59:28] is it that ye sought me
[59:33] no no
[59:36] know you not that i was about my
[59:38] father's business
[59:40] when i allowed you to have the
[59:42] revelation that i have sent a prophet
[59:44] when i allowed you to have the
[59:45] revelation of this message being true
[59:48] when i allowed you to have the
[59:49] revelation that me and you were together
[59:51] before the foundation of the world
[59:54] know ye not that i was about my father's
[59:58] business
[1:00:00] see we brother branham said when mary
[1:00:02] did that
[1:00:05] she denied her own testimony
[1:00:09] for the nine months before that or for
[1:00:12] however long before that
[1:00:13] i think he was what 12 years old at that
[1:00:15] time she come to that point
[1:00:17] see how i told you what your hybrid
[1:00:19] spirit will do to you
[1:00:23] for 12 years mary's hybrid spirit
[1:00:28] laid in agreement with that revelation
[1:00:30] that he was deity
[1:00:32] virgin born but then it saw an
[1:00:36] opportunity
[1:00:39] and it created a situation to where she
[1:00:41] was pressured
[1:00:44] she was a mother looking for a lost
[1:00:46] child
[1:00:47] there was pressure it was intense she
[1:00:50] was frantic
[1:00:51] she was rushed and it saw an opportunity
[1:00:56] i am the father of lies
[1:00:59] now i am going to have her run her
[1:01:03] entire testimony for the last 12 years
[1:01:06] of this being a virgin born
[1:01:08] son of god and i will make her run in in
[1:01:11] here and declare that joseph is really
[1:01:13] the father
[1:01:17] just like that most of the time when we
[1:01:20] deviate away from our revelation it's
[1:01:21] because we're under pressure and it's
[1:01:23] because we're rushed
[1:01:26] just like mary
[1:01:30] that's how deceptive your hybrid human
[1:01:34] spirit is remember it was the tree of
[1:01:37] the knowledge of
[1:01:38] good and evil it will
[1:01:41] lay in agreement of something for years
[1:01:45] just to wait for an opportunity to
[1:01:48] shatter the entire thing
[1:01:50] why does the devil care if you have the
[1:01:53] proper revelation for 20 years
[1:01:55] if he can get you to a moment before a
[1:01:58] crowd of people
[1:02:00] before the scribes and the pharisees and
[1:02:02] then
[1:02:04] manipulate your hybrid human spirit to
[1:02:06] make you confess something different
[1:02:10] you you think he won't wait 20 30 years
[1:02:13] for that one opportunity
[1:02:16] that's how fickle and how much
[1:02:20] distrust we have to put in our hybrid
[1:02:23] spirit and in our flesh
[1:02:25] none zero
[1:02:28] it will always lie to you every attempt
[1:02:32] that it gets
[1:02:32] that shock cannot handle the revelation
[1:02:36] that i
[1:02:36] and the father are one
[1:02:40] and that's the revelation that mary was
[1:02:42] declaring here
[1:02:44] because if she would have declared that
[1:02:47] jesus was virgin born
[1:02:48] what option do they have because it
[1:02:51] lays there in the scripture when jesus
[1:02:53] came and he says i'm
[1:02:56] that i'm born to my father they they
[1:02:59] knew what that meant they knew what that
[1:03:02] meant
[1:03:04] they knew that that meant he was god
[1:03:09] and that's what mary had the opportunity
[1:03:12] to declare here
[1:03:14] but her hybrid human spirit would not
[1:03:16] allow her to do it
[1:03:18] it will never allow you to do it it
[1:03:21] must come from the seed within
[1:03:26] and he said unto them how is it that ye
[1:03:28] sought me
[1:03:30] wist ye not that i must be about my
[1:03:32] father's business
[1:03:34] so it did two things it immediately
[1:03:36] corrected the error
[1:03:38] and told me and you we had nothing to do
[1:03:40] with this
[1:03:43] and then it told us who had something to
[1:03:45] do with it
[1:03:49] questions and answers on hebrews 1957
[1:03:52] father it is noted that when you were 12
[1:03:54] years old you were found in the temple
[1:03:56] with the scribes and the sages
[1:03:57] discussing within the scriptures
[1:03:59] and they were astonished to see a little
[1:04:01] boy of about 12 years old explaining the
[1:04:03] scriptures
[1:04:04] you was about your father's business
[1:04:09] remember what we're dealing with here
[1:04:12] these
[1:04:12] other sayings
[1:04:15] the first one jesus declared
[1:04:20] you did not look for me i was looking
[1:04:22] for you
[1:04:23] and i am about my father's business now
[1:04:26] it's real easy to put a superficial
[1:04:28] revelation
[1:04:28] or a superficial interpretation of what
[1:04:31] the father's business
[1:04:32] is oh it's seeking and saving the lost
[1:04:33] sheep of israel
[1:04:35] but let's allow a prophet to tell us
[1:04:38] what the father's business
[1:04:40] is
[1:04:44] you was about your father's business you
[1:04:46] said to your mother
[1:04:47] knowest thou not that i must be about my
[1:04:49] father's business
[1:04:51] to explain the scriptures with their
[1:04:55] spiritual
[1:04:56] meaning
[1:05:05] your coworkers your friends your family
[1:05:10] they're okay with a superficial
[1:05:13] speaking of the scriptures
[1:05:19] god became flesh in the form of jesus
[1:05:23] he died for us on a cross
[1:05:27] we accept him as our savior we're now
[1:05:29] good to go
[1:05:33] but you realize that he was actually the
[1:05:34] word when he came there
[1:05:38] and it was the word that died for us
[1:05:42] and now in this day if we want to have
[1:05:45] that covering for a sacrifice of sins
[1:05:47] we have to accept the word
[1:05:50] have that conversation
[1:05:55] see if there's not some shock that pulls
[1:05:56] away
[1:05:58] see they're okay with a superficial
[1:06:01] interpretation
[1:06:03] but when you allow a prophet to
[1:06:05] interpret
[1:06:07] what that means it's totally different
[1:06:10] and now a prophet comes and says the
[1:06:12] father's business
[1:06:14] is to explain the scriptures with their
[1:06:18] spiritual
[1:06:19] meaning not just a superficial
[1:06:24] intellectual conception but
[1:06:27] to be about the father's business
[1:06:30] is to explain the scriptures
[1:06:33] with their spiritual meaning
[1:06:38] but i thought you said that brother
[1:06:40] branham says that
[1:06:41] the father's business is to seek and to
[1:06:43] save that which was lost
[1:06:45] he did how else
[1:06:49] do you think you are going to seek and
[1:06:52] save that which is lost without giving
[1:06:55] them
[1:06:55] the proper interpretation of the
[1:06:58] scriptures
[1:07:00] can't do it you may play on their
[1:07:04] emotions you may get a response you may
[1:07:06] make them cry you may
[1:07:07] make them jump you may make them scream
[1:07:10] he says to seek and to
[1:07:12] save that which is lost
[1:07:17] you cannot save that which is lost
[1:07:20] without explaining to them
[1:07:22] the spiritual meaning of the scripture
[1:07:27] can't do it it's one and the same thing
[1:07:31] i'm not just making that up saints what
[1:07:32] did peter do at the day of pentecost
[1:07:35] there's 3 000 of them there and he came
[1:07:38] out
[1:07:39] and he says this scripture right here
[1:07:43] is that that you're seeing what did he
[1:07:46] do
[1:07:48] he gave the spiritual meaning to the
[1:07:51] scripture
[1:07:52] and what was the outcome 000 conversions
[1:08:00] peter did not even tell them to go back
[1:08:02] up into the upper room
[1:08:05] he did not point them back to a cross to
[1:08:07] go dig up some dirt and get some blood
[1:08:10] peter took the scripture
[1:08:13] and gave the proper interpretation to it
[1:08:17] and they were converted
[1:08:21] don't think we're going to convert
[1:08:22] somebody any other way
[1:08:26] it's not going to happen and if we're
[1:08:28] doing it some other way
[1:08:30] it's not my father's business
[1:08:36] brother branham says if we discern the
[1:08:38] two spirits within the framework of the
[1:08:41] christian
[1:08:41] church
[1:08:45] if one of those spirits is god's
[1:08:48] what's the other spirit
[1:08:52] there is only two spirits
[1:08:56] don't sugarcoat it any
[1:08:59] other attempted method of conversion
[1:09:02] without the proper
[1:09:04] explanation and revelation of the
[1:09:06] scriptures for
[1:09:07] our day is anti-christ
[1:09:10] it is of the fought of their father
[1:09:14] the devil
[1:09:17] any other method any other way
[1:09:22] it is of the father of the devil
[1:09:25] because the father's business per the
[1:09:28] prophet
[1:09:30] is to explain the scriptures with their
[1:09:32] spiritual meaning
[1:09:34] 1964 they identified christ of all ages
[1:09:37] he said
[1:09:38] don't you know that i must be about my
[1:09:39] father's business see
[1:09:42] see if he had been about his father
[1:09:44] joseph
[1:09:45] business if joseph had been his father
[1:09:48] he'd have been making cabinet doors and
[1:09:50] things see
[1:09:51] but he was about his father's business
[1:09:54] straightening out the word for the
[1:10:01] come day you say well they're passing
[1:10:03] out bibles
[1:10:04] in africa they are doing mission trips
[1:10:07] in philippines
[1:10:08] they are
[1:10:12] that's wonderful that's good
[1:10:15] i'll say it like the prophet said it
[1:10:17] they're a good shuck
[1:10:20] leave them alone i don't and
[1:10:23] i know we chuckle with that but i i say
[1:10:25] that in all honesty
[1:10:26] i don't condemn them for that i do not
[1:10:29] condemn
[1:10:30] the shock for being a shock because the
[1:10:32] scripture told me it's only by the grace
[1:10:34] of god that i can even recognize that
[1:10:36] i'm not shocked
[1:10:39] so let the shock be a shock if there
[1:10:42] wasn't shock me and you wouldn't be
[1:10:43] standing here or sitting here this
[1:10:45] morning
[1:10:46] but
[1:10:50] if they're not straightening out the
[1:10:52] word for their day
[1:10:53] they are not converting people and they
[1:10:56] are not about the father's business
[1:11:00] the true father's business
[1:11:04] but if a shock is being a shock let it
[1:11:07] be a shock
[1:11:08] because that's a direct quote brother
[1:11:10] branham said that it was a good
[1:11:12] shuck you can't just do away with the
[1:11:15] shuck if you plant corn and cut
[1:11:17] sale of that coming up that shot kill it
[1:11:19] you're never going to have any corn
[1:11:22] let it be what it is and that's what i
[1:11:25] say we can recognize good and bad within
[1:11:27] the economical realm
[1:11:28] within the political realm within the
[1:11:30] denominational realm within the ranks of
[1:11:32] the message
[1:11:33] i'm not fighting against that if it's
[1:11:36] shuck
[1:11:37] let it be shuck
[1:11:40] if it's seed let it be seed it will
[1:11:42] manifest itself
[1:11:43] but that's what i say our focus has got
[1:11:45] to be off of
[1:11:46] fighting and discerning what is shock
[1:11:49] outside of the real shock that we need
[1:11:50] to deal with
[1:11:51] [Music]
[1:11:53] that's what we have to deal with that's
[1:11:55] what we need to focus on
[1:11:59] he was about his father's business
[1:12:02] straightening out the word for that day
[1:12:08] who's to say that they're shocked
[1:12:12] doing a work right now laying a
[1:12:15] foundation
[1:12:16] for somebody to go and to straighten out
[1:12:19] the word for the day
[1:12:20] to that individual who's to say that
[1:12:22] that the shock hasn't
[1:12:24] given that person a bible to where they
[1:12:26] have a mechanical understanding of the
[1:12:28] scriptures
[1:12:29] and of who jesus is and of the history
[1:12:31] so that you have something to work with
[1:12:33] when you get there to straighten out the
[1:12:35] scriptures for the day
[1:12:36] leave the shock alone saints
[1:12:39] leave it alone it is a good shock
[1:12:44] as paul said you know they they got on
[1:12:46] the paul you know there's these other
[1:12:47] people over here they're preaching the
[1:12:48] gospel but they're doing it for filthy
[1:12:50] luker
[1:12:51] he said leave them alone just leave them
[1:12:53] like if they preach the gospel leave
[1:12:54] them alone
[1:12:55] if they're not fighting against us
[1:12:56] they're for us just leave them alone
[1:13:00] leave them alone
[1:13:03] if they want to preach the message and
[1:13:04] put their own interpretation to it
[1:13:06] leave them alone maybe somebody will
[1:13:08] just hear that there's a message
[1:13:11] maybe somebody will hear that there's
[1:13:12] god has sent a prophet
[1:13:14] maybe they don't come to the fullness of
[1:13:16] the revelation maybe they don't preach
[1:13:18] the fullness that i and my father are
[1:13:20] one
[1:13:20] leave them alone let them preach what
[1:13:23] they're going to preach
[1:13:25] it's not going to hurt a seed
[1:13:28] it's not going to hurt a seed and who's
[1:13:30] to say
[1:13:31] that there's not shuck laying a
[1:13:33] foundation
[1:13:34] for another seed to come along and
[1:13:36] straighten out the scriptures to that
[1:13:38] seed
[1:13:39] don't fight that battle saints it's
[1:13:41] worthless it's pointless
[1:13:42] it's i'm going to go over my quota but
[1:13:46] i'm going to say it again there's no
[1:13:47] point in that
[1:13:49] that's not the battle that's not where
[1:13:51] it's at
[1:13:52] it did john and peter no good it'll do
[1:13:55] you no good
[1:13:57] deal with this shock
[1:14:00] straighten straighten out the scriptures
[1:14:03] with this shock
[1:14:05] and then worry about the other shock
[1:14:11] watch the word is always corrective 1964
[1:14:13] the voice of the sun
[1:14:14] that little 12 year old boy never a day
[1:14:16] in school as we know of just a child he
[1:14:18] never knowed it
[1:14:19] he never know he said it perhaps this
[1:14:21] was so profound to me i'm not going to
[1:14:23] take a lot of time on it but brother
[1:14:24] brandon says when jesus made that
[1:14:26] statement he may not even know what he
[1:14:27] was saying
[1:14:29] he's just a 12 year old boy he never
[1:14:31] knowed it
[1:14:32] he said it perhaps but watch what he
[1:14:34] said know ye not that i must be about my
[1:14:36] father's business
[1:14:37] and he is the word today he is the same
[1:14:41] yesterday
[1:14:42] today and forever no ye not
[1:14:45] if he had been about joseph business
[1:14:48] he'd have been making carpenter business
[1:14:50] but he was about the father of the
[1:14:52] heavenly father's business
[1:14:54] he was out there another definition
[1:14:56] coming
[1:14:58] he was out there busting up them
[1:15:01] organizations they had out there
[1:15:03] and all that scrupled it he was tearing
[1:15:07] it to pieces
[1:15:10] well brother benjamin you just told us
[1:15:11] not to worry about busting those up not
[1:15:13] to be worried about fighting them not to
[1:15:15] be focused on them
[1:15:16] yes live the life
[1:15:19] it'll bust them up every day live the
[1:15:22] life
[1:15:23] deal with this shock get the revelation
[1:15:26] i and the father are one and these other
[1:15:28] things in here
[1:15:30] it will bust up your own denomination it
[1:15:33] will tear it to pieces
[1:15:36] so yes by all means deal with the the
[1:15:39] denominational spirit
[1:15:40] but deal with it in yourself tear it to
[1:15:43] pieces
[1:15:44] bust it up with the appropriate
[1:15:46] revelation for the word of your day
[1:15:51] he was about the heavenly father's
[1:15:53] business he was out there busting up
[1:15:54] them organizations
[1:15:56] they had up there and all that scrupled
[1:15:59] it up
[1:16:00] he was tearing it to pieces
[1:16:03] now like i said i'm not so naive to
[1:16:05] believe that there's not repercussions
[1:16:07] and there's not things that happen when
[1:16:09] we live a life
[1:16:10] and when we say things and when we just
[1:16:13] deal with ourself
[1:16:14] there are repercussions and there are
[1:16:16] ripple effects to that
[1:16:18] god sent a worldwide ministry through a
[1:16:20] prophet that tore those denominations to
[1:16:22] shreds
[1:16:23] and he did not mince words about it
[1:16:26] but don't think for a second that that
[1:16:28] was his focus
[1:16:30] and that's what he cared about what he
[1:16:32] cared about
[1:16:33] was the sheep in there and the only way
[1:16:36] to get the sheep
[1:16:38] in there was to bust up everything that
[1:16:41] was around them so that they would
[1:16:42] recognize the fallacy in it
[1:16:44] he wasn't doing it so that he could say
[1:16:46] you're wrong i'm right
[1:16:48] he was not don't think that he was
[1:16:50] taking any glory in that
[1:16:53] don't think that he would enjoy that
[1:16:55] process he would preach as hard as he
[1:16:57] could and then he'd be bawling at the
[1:16:59] end of the service
[1:17:01] but he knew the only way to get to a
[1:17:03] sheep in there
[1:17:04] was to bust that up
[1:17:07] so we have to make sure our motive and
[1:17:09] our objective is right when
[1:17:11] even when we're going after a seed and
[1:17:13] that's why i spent 45 minutes laying
[1:17:15] that foundation
[1:17:16] is i can come here and i can preach this
[1:17:18] and it will be true
[1:17:20] but if i preach it with the wrong spirit
[1:17:22] and with the wrong motivation
[1:17:24] and i preach it with the motivation to
[1:17:26] show somebody else is wrong and that i'm
[1:17:28] right
[1:17:28] or that we as a church are right and
[1:17:30] there's another church that's wrong
[1:17:31] you've missed the boat saints we have
[1:17:33] missed the boat
[1:17:36] you can say what is right and what is
[1:17:38] true and what is actually
[1:17:39] and even be according with the
[1:17:41] scriptures and if you say it with the
[1:17:42] wrong spirit and with the wrong
[1:17:43] motivation
[1:17:44] you're wrong you're wrong
[1:17:49] that's why we have brother bran says all
[1:17:52] hell is against the revelation to the
[1:17:54] individual
[1:17:56] we have to deal with the individual we
[1:17:59] have to deal with ourselves
[1:18:00] and then whatever god chooses to have as
[1:18:03] ripple effects from that then so be it
[1:18:06] but if that's our focus and that's our
[1:18:08] motivation is to deal with somebody else
[1:18:10] or deal with another church or
[1:18:12] deal with the person sitting beside of
[1:18:13] us we've missed the boat
[1:18:18] we have to say what's right with the
[1:18:21] right spirit and with the right
[1:18:24] motivation
[1:18:27] the seed is not air with the shock 1965
[1:18:31] or just proving the denominations has
[1:18:33] been carriers
[1:18:35] that's another one of the father's
[1:18:36] business
[1:18:38] to prove and the father's business now
[1:18:41] is to show you that them denominations
[1:18:44] is not
[1:18:45] his they're a man-made
[1:18:48] system that denies the word don't
[1:18:51] put that out there the father's business
[1:18:56] is to show you that your own mind
[1:19:00] your own man-made thoughts and
[1:19:02] interpretations is not
[1:19:06] his
[1:19:08] they are man-made and they will deny the
[1:19:10] word
[1:19:11] even if it agrees with it for years
[1:19:14] intellectually
[1:19:16] when this pressure comes and when when
[1:19:19] it gets intense and when you get in
[1:19:21] a rush it will wait for that opportunity
[1:19:24] to deny the word
[1:19:26] brother branham says his business is to
[1:19:28] show that those are just carriers
[1:19:31] they're just carriers what is your flesh
[1:19:33] what is your
[1:19:34] your spirit it's a carrier of the seed
[1:19:37] if you did not have your flesh
[1:19:39] and you did not have your your spirit
[1:19:42] what's going to pack your seed around
[1:19:46] i it's just that simple saints
[1:19:50] it's a good shock it's been permitted by
[1:19:54] god
[1:19:54] not his perfect will his permissive will
[1:19:57] but it's a
[1:19:58] good shock
[1:20:01] it has to be there to carry the seed
[1:20:05] but as paul said i die daily and
[1:20:08] i bring into subjection this body and
[1:20:11] this
[1:20:11] mind this spirit to the true
[1:20:14] interpretation of the word
[1:20:15] so it's a good shock it'll carry this
[1:20:18] seed
[1:20:19] brother around says he's got no hands
[1:20:20] but my hands no feet but your feet no
[1:20:23] mouth but our mouth
[1:20:24] it's a good shock if
[1:20:28] if it's about the father's business
[1:20:32] and your seed your seed the
[1:20:35] true you your heart your soul your seed
[1:20:38] whatever
[1:20:38] the germ of life of god so
[1:20:42] zooey life the holy ghost within you
[1:20:44] whatever terminology you want to put on
[1:20:46] it
[1:20:48] that has to bring your shock into
[1:20:50] subjection
[1:20:51] and all brother bran says all of the
[1:20:54] life has to be
[1:20:55] sapped out of that shock and go into the
[1:20:58] seed
[1:20:59] for it to be worth something
[1:21:04] all right here comes the bombshell quote
[1:21:07] 1965 the seed does not air with the
[1:21:09] shuck
[1:21:11] the word yet young spake for itself
[1:21:14] and know not that i must be about my
[1:21:17] father's business
[1:21:18] quoting jesus there is the secret of the
[1:21:21] message now
[1:21:23] wouldn't that make a title
[1:21:27] there is the secret to the message i
[1:21:29] know i've got everybody's attention now
[1:21:31] i am about to tell you the secret of the
[1:21:33] message
[1:21:37] there is the secret of the message now
[1:21:40] just exactly the father's
[1:21:43] business what
[1:21:47] is the father's business
[1:21:51] this is a good question right this is
[1:21:54] the secret of the message
[1:21:55] you say well i thought the thunders were
[1:21:56] the secrets of the message they are
[1:21:58] they're the father's business i i
[1:22:01] thought the seals and the trumpets and
[1:22:03] they are they're the father's business
[1:22:07] what's the father's business revealing
[1:22:10] you to you
[1:22:12] he says what is the father's business
[1:22:14] could you think of what the father's
[1:22:16] business was in him
[1:22:18] speaking of jesus to fulfill
[1:22:21] what isaiah said
[1:22:25] think hard brother branham says the
[1:22:28] father's business which is the secret of
[1:22:32] the message
[1:22:33] the father's business to jesus
[1:22:37] was to fulfill what isaiah said about
[1:22:40] him
[1:22:42] a virgin shall conceive fulfill what
[1:22:46] isaiah said again the lame shall leap as
[1:22:49] a heart
[1:22:51] and all these things that would take
[1:22:52] place like moses said
[1:22:54] the lord your god shall raise up a
[1:22:56] prophet among you
[1:22:58] liken unto me it was the father's
[1:23:01] business to fulfill the word
[1:23:06] [Music]
[1:23:09] that's the secret of the message
[1:23:12] so you can have whatever whatever
[1:23:15] intellectual conception and knowledge
[1:23:17] store up you want to have about the
[1:23:19] message
[1:23:20] and you can quote whatever you want to
[1:23:21] quote and verbatim
[1:23:23] not verbatim page number paragraph
[1:23:26] message here whatever
[1:23:29] if you're not fulfilling the word
[1:23:33] you're not about the father's business
[1:23:36] and you
[1:23:36] don't have the secret of the message
[1:23:40] that's the prophet's definition not mine
[1:23:43] it was the father's business to fulfill
[1:23:46] the word
[1:23:48] well if that came down through them
[1:23:50] stalks of those natural women
[1:23:52] speaking of the natural lineage of jesus
[1:23:54] tamar and
[1:23:55] uh down through down through mary that
[1:23:57] natural energy says if it came through
[1:23:59] them
[1:24:00] what about the stalks of these spiritual
[1:24:03] women
[1:24:04] church women luther methodist
[1:24:08] wesley pentecostal you understand
[1:24:13] we must be about the father's business
[1:24:16] the wheat would cry back to the grain
[1:24:20] the wheat would cry back to the grain
[1:24:23] who is he speaking of here us and the
[1:24:26] father
[1:24:28] the wheat would cry back to the grain
[1:24:31] what must it do
[1:24:33] now watch what he does here
[1:24:36] vindicate malachi 4
[1:24:39] vindicate luke 17 30. vindicate hebrews
[1:24:43] 13
[1:24:43] 8 vindicate saint john 14 12
[1:24:46] vindicate all of his word
[1:24:50] vindicate revelation the 10th chapter
[1:24:52] the opening of the seventh seals and the
[1:24:54] mysteries of god
[1:24:57] what is the secret of the message to be
[1:25:00] about the father's business
[1:25:02] what is the father's business to fulfill
[1:25:04] the word
[1:25:05] what would the wheat cry back to the
[1:25:08] grain
[1:25:08] what must we cry back to the father we
[1:25:12] must
[1:25:12] vindicate malachi 4. luke 17 30
[1:25:16] hebrews 13 8 watch what he did there he
[1:25:19] changed his terminology he went from
[1:25:22] fulfill to vindicate
[1:25:26] he's not playing with words saints
[1:25:29] there is a huge difference between
[1:25:31] fulfillment and vindication
[1:25:34] he says what must we do
[1:25:38] we must vindicate malachi 4.
[1:25:43] i thought malachi 4 was brother branham
[1:25:45] it was
[1:25:46] in fulfillment but we must vindicate
[1:25:50] that
[1:25:51] we must vindicate luke 17 30.
[1:25:55] you say well i thought that was the son
[1:25:56] of man ministry and brother random it
[1:25:58] was
[1:25:58] but we must vindicate that not
[1:26:01] re-fulfill it
[1:26:04] not re how many ministers have we seen
[1:26:08] try to re-fulfill malachi 4 and be that
[1:26:11] messenger
[1:26:12] that's not the father's business brother
[1:26:14] branham says the father's business was
[1:26:16] to
[1:26:16] vindicate malachi 4. not re-fulfill it
[1:26:22] i'm going to read you these definitions
[1:26:24] so you can see where i'm going
[1:26:26] fulfill means to bring to completion or
[1:26:30] reality
[1:26:33] fulfill to bring to completion
[1:26:36] or reality to vindicate something
[1:26:40] is to clear something or someone
[1:26:45] of blame or suspicion
[1:26:49] to show and to prove to be
[1:26:52] right reasonable and justified
[1:27:00] brother branham said the secret of the
[1:27:02] message
[1:27:03] was to be about the father's business
[1:27:05] and the father's business
[1:27:08] was to fulfill the word of god
[1:27:11] and then he gives us our instructions
[1:27:14] of what we must do to be about the
[1:27:18] father's business
[1:27:19] and he says our instructions are to
[1:27:22] vindicate malachi 4.
[1:27:26] to vindicate luke 17 30.
[1:27:29] to vindicate hebrews 13 8 saint john 14
[1:27:32] 12
[1:27:33] all of his word revelation 10 7 the
[1:27:36] opening the seals and the mysteries of
[1:27:38] god
[1:27:38] i'm going to make it real plain for you
[1:27:40] saints we know there's an attack on this
[1:27:42] message
[1:27:43] we know there's an attack on the prophet
[1:27:44] there's an attack on the cloud there's a
[1:27:46] tackle on this vision there's a tackle
[1:27:47] on that vision there's attacked on this
[1:27:49] situation
[1:27:52] we are not to try to re-fulfill those
[1:27:55] things
[1:27:57] we are to vindicate and to clear
[1:28:01] and remove all suspicion or false blame
[1:28:05] and to show and to prove that which has
[1:28:09] been said
[1:28:10] to be right reasonable and justified
[1:28:15] and here's the thing we're to do that
[1:28:19] without ever
[1:28:19] uttering a word
[1:28:23] because if you utter a word they can
[1:28:25] utter more words
[1:28:27] if you argue they can argue back if you
[1:28:30] get
[1:28:30] facts and figures and clippings and
[1:28:32] whatever else
[1:28:34] they can get more
[1:28:37] what they can't argue with is the
[1:28:40] vindication
[1:28:42] of a lived life
[1:28:46] because deep down in their heart
[1:28:49] they will know i can argue all that i
[1:28:52] want to
[1:28:53] but you know what they'll never say this
[1:28:56] they're incapable of saying this because
[1:28:59] if they say this they declare that you
[1:29:00] and the father are one
[1:29:01] and if they say that then they are to
[1:29:03] automatically declare what their father
[1:29:04] is but what they will never tell you is
[1:29:07] you know what
[1:29:08] that person's got something i don't have
[1:29:12] and it lines up with what that man said
[1:29:14] that they call as a prophet
[1:29:17] and when you vindicate that
[1:29:21] you remove all suspicion and blame from
[1:29:24] that ministry
[1:29:25] that god sent us
[1:29:28] is there blame on that ministry
[1:29:30] absolutely is there suspicion about that
[1:29:32] ministry absolutely don't kid yourself
[1:29:36] are you going to intellectually ration
[1:29:38] uh rationalize that and figure that out
[1:29:40] with those people that are unbelievers
[1:29:42] no they're unbelievers saints that's
[1:29:44] what they do they unbelieve
[1:29:46] we're believers we believe brother
[1:29:48] branham did not tell us that we needed
[1:29:50] to re-fulfill those things
[1:29:52] he did not tell us that we needed to go
[1:29:54] get facts and figures
[1:29:56] to show that the fulfillment of those
[1:29:58] things were accurate
[1:29:59] he said vindicate it
[1:30:03] vindicate it how do we vindicate it we
[1:30:08] live it and when we live it even if
[1:30:10] they'll never acknowledge it
[1:30:12] they will know deep down inside they've
[1:30:15] got something i don't have
[1:30:18] and it matches what that man said and it
[1:30:20] matches what those scriptures say
[1:30:23] but if they are who they say they are
[1:30:26] and i don't line up with that
[1:30:29] i don't like the position that puts me
[1:30:32] in
[1:30:34] when you begin to say i
[1:30:37] and the father are one and these other
[1:30:39] things what are these other things
[1:30:42] we're only going to get to one or two
[1:30:43] out of 20.
[1:30:45] what are these other things to explain
[1:30:47] the scriptures
[1:30:50] with their appropriate spiritual meaning
[1:30:52] i challenge you to do that without
[1:30:54] uttering a word
[1:30:57] i challenge you to do that without
[1:30:59] uttering a word
[1:31:00] be about the father's business
[1:31:03] bust up your own denominational thinking
[1:31:07] tear it to pieces be about the father's
[1:31:10] business
[1:31:11] vindicate revelation 10 7. we've talked
[1:31:13] about revelation 10 7 for how long
[1:31:16] for how many years how many services how
[1:31:18] many messages have we preached about
[1:31:19] revelation 10
[1:31:20] 7 why don't we vindicate revelation 10
[1:31:22] 7.
[1:31:24] we don't need to refulfill revelation 10
[1:31:27] 7
[1:31:27] we don't need to reemphasize who
[1:31:29] revelation 10 7 was
[1:31:31] we need to vindicate it with a lived
[1:31:33] life
[1:31:38] vindication is much much different
[1:31:41] than fulfillment and
[1:31:45] vindication is required by god
[1:31:52] the fourth seal 1963
[1:31:57] vindication is so important
[1:32:01] vindication of the scriptures is so
[1:32:04] important to god that he
[1:32:05] ensures he has it himself
[1:32:09] god vindicated brother branham
[1:32:13] we know that god vindicated him
[1:32:17] but what brother branham said has to be
[1:32:20] vindicated by a people
[1:32:22] that he said it too and
[1:32:26] god cares about this so much watch what
[1:32:28] brother branham says
[1:32:30] 1963 fourth seal life
[1:32:33] followed the rider on the white horse
[1:32:36] speaking of the truth of the true horse
[1:32:39] the true white horse rider
[1:32:41] christ who was the word
[1:32:44] life vindicated by his
[1:32:47] resurrected saints that he had with him
[1:32:51] he says when christ comes riding on that
[1:32:54] white horse
[1:32:55] not exactly horses
[1:32:59] his name is the word of god and he is
[1:33:01] life he's bringing life with him
[1:33:04] and he is vindicated it does him no good
[1:33:08] to have the title of the word of god if
[1:33:10] there's no vindication
[1:33:11] but it's so important to christ that he
[1:33:14] is vindicated as the word of god
[1:33:16] that he comes with his vindication
[1:33:19] his resurrected saints
[1:33:26] your lived life is so important to god
[1:33:29] that that is what he
[1:33:31] rides on when he returns as
[1:33:34] his vindication
[1:33:39] don't put that future tense
[1:33:45] are you allowing him to vindicate the
[1:33:48] true and accurate interpretation of the
[1:33:51] scriptures that we know as this message
[1:33:54] through your lived life by having a
[1:33:57] perfect revelation that
[1:33:58] i and the father are one and these other
[1:34:01] things
[1:34:02] and causing your own shuck to pull away
[1:34:06] destroying your own ideas in your own
[1:34:08] mind
[1:34:11] are we allowing him allowing him to
[1:34:14] ride in our life by doing that
[1:34:19] don't put that future tense he's come
[1:34:22] riding on that right now he's looking to
[1:34:25] ride on that right now
[1:34:27] he is looking for vindication you say
[1:34:29] well he's god he's who
[1:34:30] what does he care he's god he don't care
[1:34:32] whether somebody believes him or not no
[1:34:34] god cares god cares about vindication
[1:34:41] i'll say that that's what he cares about
[1:34:43] most
[1:34:45] and he's not needing to vindicate it to
[1:34:47] make himself feel good saints
[1:34:50] he's not doing it for self-esteem
[1:34:56] but that's his business is to explain
[1:34:59] the scriptures
[1:35:01] to live the scriptures with their true
[1:35:03] spiritual meaning
[1:35:05] he cares about that so much so
[1:35:09] that he would choose that as his vehicle
[1:35:12] to come in in this last day
[1:35:18] not coming in to come in
[1:35:21] present tense
[1:35:26] resurrected saints that he had with him
[1:35:29] now
[1:35:30] how is the battle to go
[1:35:36] jesus said he that believeth in me
[1:35:39] though he were dead yet shall he live
[1:35:42] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:35:44] shall never die
[1:35:48] what did he just say before that how is
[1:35:51] this battle to go
[1:35:56] are we catching at saints where are the
[1:35:59] battles at
[1:36:02] where he's wanting to ride at
[1:36:05] where he's riding at is the same place
[1:36:07] that the battle is taking place
[1:36:09] it's in me and you
[1:36:13] how is this battle to go and then he
[1:36:15] starts quoting scriptures
[1:36:17] he that believeth in me
[1:36:20] though he were dead yet shall he live
[1:36:23] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:36:25] shall never die again he said
[1:36:27] he that believes in me i will give him
[1:36:29] eternal life i will raise him up in the
[1:36:31] last days
[1:36:32] that's his promised scripture here comes
[1:36:34] satan with all
[1:36:36] four corners of the earth with his
[1:36:37] protestants and with his catholics
[1:36:40] and all together mark
[1:36:44] with his protestants and his catholics
[1:36:48] don't leave it all in catholics
[1:36:51] remember what i said earlier any type of
[1:36:54] attempted conversion without the
[1:36:56] appropriate interpretation of the
[1:36:58] scripture
[1:36:59] is not of christ call it protestant if
[1:37:02] you want
[1:37:04] you may be protesting the catholic
[1:37:06] church but you're still in line with
[1:37:07] protesting christ
[1:37:11] don't tell them they're okay saints
[1:37:13] they're not okay
[1:37:15] just because you define withstand and
[1:37:17] don't agree with the catholic church
[1:37:18] does not make them okay
[1:37:21] tell them the truth explain
[1:37:24] the scriptures with their appropriate
[1:37:26] meaning
[1:37:29] or they're just going to be a protestant
[1:37:32] and look who satan's writing
[1:37:35] protestants and catholics
[1:37:39] there's no gray area it's either christ
[1:37:43] or it's antichrist
[1:37:44] it's either i and my father are one or
[1:37:46] it's serpent seed
[1:37:48] it's it's not i don't want to make that
[1:37:51] statement it's not surprising we know
[1:37:52] there's a group that's granted in
[1:37:54] it's antichrist you understand
[1:37:59] the true interpretation of the scripture
[1:38:02] for our day
[1:38:03] is not a gray area and nothing else will
[1:38:06] work
[1:38:07] not for us not for anybody else
[1:38:10] satan is riding on protestants he is
[1:38:16] riding on catholics
[1:38:20] and altogether marching right up to the
[1:38:22] battle of armageddon all right
[1:38:24] and here comes jesus coming down from
[1:38:26] heaven
[1:38:27] with resurrected saints vindicated
[1:38:31] word
[1:38:36] what is the secret of the message
[1:38:39] to be about the father's business what
[1:38:42] is the father's business
[1:38:44] to vindicate malachi 4. if you look real
[1:38:47] closely in that chapter
[1:38:49] there's more than i will send you a
[1:38:50] prophet there's some children in that
[1:38:52] chapter
[1:38:55] who's those children who's going to
[1:38:57] vindicate the children
[1:38:58] we spend so much time focusing on
[1:38:59] vindicating the messenger we forget to
[1:39:01] vindicate the children
[1:39:05] with resurrected saints vindicated
[1:39:09] word i said if god speaks
[1:39:13] continuing in the fourth seal if god
[1:39:15] speaks or sends you he backs up what you
[1:39:17] say
[1:39:18] see notice if you're an ambassador from
[1:39:20] heaven all heaven is behind you
[1:39:22] and heaven is consisted of the word
[1:39:25] notice
[1:39:26] now he's come
[1:39:29] he said it not me he did not say he's
[1:39:31] coming
[1:39:32] he said notice now he's come
[1:39:35] with resurrected saints vindicating
[1:39:39] that his word is true
[1:39:45] there's two errors that we can make with
[1:39:47] that
[1:39:48] we can make those we can make that
[1:39:51] future tense
[1:39:52] that he's coming with resurrected saints
[1:39:55] that's one
[1:39:55] error and we can make those resurrected
[1:39:58] saints people that have already died and
[1:40:00] are coming back if you do that you're in
[1:40:03] error
[1:40:04] and you will never be able to declare
[1:40:05] that you and the father are one
[1:40:09] he's come
[1:40:13] right now with
[1:40:16] resurrected saints you say well i
[1:40:17] haven't died yet that's your problem you
[1:40:19] haven't died
[1:40:21] if you'll die he can resurrect you and
[1:40:23] then he can ride on you and he can
[1:40:25] vindicate and prove his word
[1:40:26] [Applause]
[1:40:28] let the shock pull away you say well i
[1:40:30] see the fallacies and denominations nope
[1:40:33] wrong shock
[1:40:37] i'm not going to rehash that i think you
[1:40:38] all get the point
[1:40:43] number two we're going to stop with this
[1:40:45] one
[1:40:46] because we're already an hour and a half
[1:40:48] in
[1:40:50] but if i can get two then like i said
[1:40:51] we've we'll deal with the rest some
[1:40:53] other
[1:40:54] time lord willing luke 5 17
[1:40:57] and it came to pass you don't have to
[1:40:58] turn there you can just listen
[1:41:00] luke 5 17 and it came to pass on a
[1:41:03] certain day as he was teaching that
[1:41:05] there were pharisees and doctors of the
[1:41:06] law
[1:41:07] sitting by which were come out of every
[1:41:09] town of galilee in judea and jerusalem
[1:41:11] and the power of the lord was present to
[1:41:13] heal them and behold
[1:41:15] men brought in a bed a man which would
[1:41:17] take which was taken with a palsy
[1:41:19] and they sought means to bring him in
[1:41:20] and delay him before him
[1:41:23] and when they could not find by what way
[1:41:25] they may bring him in the house of the
[1:41:26] multitude they went up on the housetop
[1:41:27] and let him down through the
[1:41:29] the tiling with his couch in the midst
[1:41:30] of before jesus
[1:41:32] and when he saw their faith he said unto
[1:41:35] him
[1:41:35] unto him man thy sins
[1:41:39] are forgiven thee watch the reaction
[1:41:44] and the scribes and the pharisees begin
[1:41:46] to reason
[1:41:50] don't leave it in the scribes and
[1:41:51] pharisees
[1:41:53] reasoning you pack that around with you
[1:41:56] every day
[1:42:01] and your mind begin to reason
[1:42:04] saying who is this
[1:42:07] which speaketh blasphemy who can forgive
[1:42:11] sins but god alone but when jesus
[1:42:15] perceived their thoughts he answered
[1:42:16] said unto them
[1:42:17] what reason ye in your hearts whether is
[1:42:20] easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee
[1:42:21] or to say rise up and walk
[1:42:24] but that ye may know see god cares about
[1:42:28] vindication
[1:42:31] and watch who he uses to vindicate it
[1:42:34] a man
[1:42:38] but that ye may know what i just said is
[1:42:40] true
[1:42:42] i'm going to pick up this man and
[1:42:44] manifest it in his life
[1:42:46] so that you can't argue with it
[1:42:49] don't leave it back there but when jesus
[1:42:56] perceived their thoughts he answered and
[1:42:58] said to them what reason ye in your
[1:42:59] hearts whether is it easier to say thy
[1:43:01] sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up
[1:43:03] and walk
[1:43:03] but that ye may know that the son of man
[1:43:06] hath power up
[1:43:07] on earth to forgive sins he said unto
[1:43:10] the sick of the palsy
[1:43:11] i say unto thee arise and take up thy
[1:43:13] couch and go into the house
[1:43:15] and immediately he rose up before them
[1:43:17] and took up one
[1:43:18] took up that whereon he lay and departed
[1:43:21] to his own house glorifying god
[1:43:24] and they were all amazed and they
[1:43:25] glorified god and were filled with fear
[1:43:27] saying we have seen strange things
[1:43:31] today this is the second instance in the
[1:43:35] scripture where jesus speaks
[1:43:39] and he says
[1:43:42] man thy sins
[1:43:46] are forgiven thee
[1:43:50] who is this the response is
[1:43:53] who is this that speaketh blasphemies
[1:43:58] who can forgive sins but god alone
[1:44:03] jesus's response but that
[1:44:06] ye may know that the son of man hath
[1:44:09] power upon earth to forgive
[1:44:11] sin he said unto the sick of the palsy i
[1:44:15] say unto thee arise and take up thy
[1:44:17] couch and go into thy house
[1:44:22] but that ye may know this is the second
[1:44:26] thing that jesus says
[1:44:27] after he corrects mary and says
[1:44:31] you didn't have anything to do with this
[1:44:34] was me
[1:44:35] i'm about my father's business the
[1:44:37] second thing recorded in the scripture
[1:44:38] that he says
[1:44:39] the son of man hath power
[1:44:43] on earth to forgive sin
[1:44:50] when you begin to say i
[1:44:54] and the father are one and these other
[1:44:57] things
[1:45:00] the shuck will pull away
[1:45:05] when you begin to say you have the power
[1:45:09] to forgive sins
[1:45:13] the shock will pull away you can tell
[1:45:16] your co-worker
[1:45:17] at work all the time that jesus christ
[1:45:20] 2000 years ago had power to forgive sins
[1:45:24] no argument tell them you have power on
[1:45:27] earth to forgive sins
[1:45:30] watch the shuck pull away and
[1:45:33] then deal with the real issue
[1:45:37] that every time that you even think that
[1:45:39] let alone mutter it your human
[1:45:41] hybrid spirit says no no no no
[1:45:44] no hang on hang on
[1:45:48] bag of memory last tuesday
[1:45:51] 1 15 at walmart all three
[1:45:58] remember then and you think you have
[1:46:01] power to forgive sins no
[1:46:03] no deal with the real issue
[1:46:08] the son of man in me
[1:46:12] i and my father have
[1:46:15] power on earth right now to forgive sins
[1:46:19] how by being about the father's business
[1:46:24] live the life and if needed explain the
[1:46:28] scriptures to them
[1:46:31] and by explaining the scriptures what
[1:46:33] will you do
[1:46:34] two responses there is only
[1:46:38] ever two responses to the true
[1:46:40] interpretation of the scriptures
[1:46:43] you will either set that person free
[1:46:46] from their sins
[1:46:47] or they will be judged by that
[1:46:49] [Music]
[1:46:51] it was the only responses in jesus day
[1:46:53] it was the only response in genesis
[1:46:55] it's the only response in revelation
[1:46:57] there is only two responses
[1:47:02] how are you going to forgive somebody's
[1:47:05] sins
[1:47:05] on earth today you live
[1:47:09] the life and then when they realize
[1:47:12] there's something different
[1:47:13] you explain the appropriate spiritual
[1:47:16] meaning of the scriptures to them
[1:47:18] and when they get a revelation that that
[1:47:20] is correct
[1:47:21] their sins which are many shall be
[1:47:23] forgiven
[1:47:25] how were your sins forgiven saints it's
[1:47:28] not some magic wand we're going to wave
[1:47:30] over
[1:47:30] it's the same way you were converted
[1:47:32] that they'll be converted
[1:47:33] the same way your sins will be forgiven
[1:47:35] is the same way theirs are
[1:47:36] forgiven don't
[1:47:40] don't sugarcoat it with them tell them
[1:47:43] the truth
[1:47:46] tell them the truth did sugar coating
[1:47:48] work for you
[1:47:52] how do we expect sugar coating and
[1:47:54] making the mallet
[1:47:55] message water down and palatable to save
[1:47:58] somebody from their sins
[1:48:00] it didn't work for you don't give
[1:48:03] somebody
[1:48:04] something to eat you wouldn't eat
[1:48:08] don't give them something that will do
[1:48:09] them no good give them the word
[1:48:12] live the life don't back up on it
[1:48:16] tear your shuck away let the seed shine
[1:48:19] forth
[1:48:20] and if necessary explain the scriptures
[1:48:22] to them
[1:48:26] but that ye may know that the son of man
[1:48:28] hath power upon earth to forgive sins
[1:48:32] i say unto thee arise take up thy couch
[1:48:36] and go into the house
[1:48:41] first john 1 verse 5 then this
[1:48:44] is the message which we have heard of
[1:48:46] him and i declare unto you that
[1:48:48] god is light and in him is no darkness
[1:48:50] at all if we
[1:48:51] say that we have fellowship with him and
[1:48:53] walk in darkness we lie
[1:48:54] and do not the truth but if we walk in
[1:48:58] the light as he is in the light
[1:49:00] we have fellowship one with another and
[1:49:02] the blood of jesus christ his son
[1:49:04] cleanses us from all sin very common
[1:49:08] scripture
[1:49:08] very familiar scripture scripture put it
[1:49:11] in context here
[1:49:13] don't put it in history don't put it in
[1:49:15] future tense
[1:49:16] if we are walking in the light how many
[1:49:19] are walking in the light
[1:49:22] we have fellowship one with another who
[1:49:25] has fellowship one with another in this
[1:49:27] truth that we have revealed to us
[1:49:29] then why would we back up on the fact
[1:49:32] that we
[1:49:32] have the blood of jesus christ and we
[1:49:35] can cleanse people from sin
[1:49:37] did it cleanse you from sin why wouldn't
[1:49:40] it cleanse somebody else from sin
[1:49:43] if that power lays in you to cleanse
[1:49:45] your life why wouldn't it lay in you to
[1:49:47] cleanse somebody else's life if you tell
[1:49:48] it to them
[1:49:50] don't back up on that
[1:49:54] first corinthians 6 verse 9 know ye not
[1:49:57] that the
[1:49:58] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:50:00] kingdom of god
[1:50:01] but be not deceived neither fornicators
[1:50:04] nor adulterers
[1:50:06] sorry nor idolaters nor adulterers nor
[1:50:09] effeminate
[1:50:10] nor abusing abusers of themselves with
[1:50:12] mankind
[1:50:13] nor thieves or covenants or drunkens or
[1:50:15] revilers or extortionists
[1:50:16] shall inherit the kingdom of god and
[1:50:19] such were some of you
[1:50:21] but ye are washed we
[1:50:24] are sanctified but ye are justified
[1:50:28] in the name of the lord jesus and by the
[1:50:32] spirit of our god
[1:50:34] that sounds like forgiveness of sins to
[1:50:37] me
[1:50:39] how ye are washed you
[1:50:42] are sanctified you are justified in the
[1:50:45] name of the lord jesus
[1:50:47] and by the spirit of our god john
[1:50:50] 6 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth
[1:50:54] the flesh profiteth nothing the words
[1:50:57] that i speak
[1:50:59] to you are spirit and our
[1:51:02] life back to verse 11.
[1:51:06] in first corinthians 6 and such were
[1:51:09] some of you but ye
[1:51:10] are washed ye are sanctified ye are
[1:51:13] justified in the name of the lord jesus
[1:51:15] and by the spirit of our god
[1:51:17] what is the spirit of our god
[1:51:22] the words that i speak unto you
[1:51:26] are spirit and they are
[1:51:30] life how are you how
[1:51:33] am i going to forgive somebody of their
[1:51:36] sins
[1:51:37] on earth i am going to give them the
[1:51:40] spirit of christ
[1:51:41] how am i going to give them the spirit
[1:51:43] of christ i'm not going to carry it
[1:51:45] around in a little bucket and dish it
[1:51:47] out i'm going to
[1:51:48] speak the word
[1:51:52] when you begin to say i and my father
[1:51:55] are one and these
[1:51:56] other things the shock will pull away
[1:52:00] i'm getting ahead of myself but one of
[1:52:02] these other things
[1:52:05] is unless you believe the words that i
[1:52:07] speak unto you
[1:52:09] you will die in your sin
[1:52:12] tell that to your hybrid human mind
[1:52:17] it'll take you way past walmart last
[1:52:19] tuesday in aisle three
[1:52:24] tell that to your hybrid human mind
[1:52:28] the words that you speak
[1:52:33] don't back up on that revelation saints
[1:52:37] if your hybrid human mind disagrees with
[1:52:39] it that probably tells you you should
[1:52:41] agree with it
[1:52:44] when you wake up and you look in the
[1:52:45] room in the mirror and you say these
[1:52:47] other things and you repulse
[1:52:49] and you want to put something over the
[1:52:51] mirror that probably tells you there's a
[1:52:53] truth there
[1:52:55] he's the father and author of lies he
[1:52:58] will resist that revelation every time
[1:53:00] that it comes
[1:53:02] unless you believe the words that i
[1:53:04] speak unto you say that to a co-worker
[1:53:08] they're okay with you talking about
[1:53:10] jesus saying that 2000 years ago
[1:53:12] tell them unless you believe the words
[1:53:14] that i speak i had a man ask me that
[1:53:15] point blank one day
[1:53:18] you're saying that if i don't believe
[1:53:19] like you believe that i'm not going to
[1:53:21] make it
[1:53:24] answer it truthfully saints don't back
[1:53:26] up on it
[1:53:28] don't wishy-washy with it it's either
[1:53:30] true or it's not true
[1:53:32] and it's not that you have to believe
[1:53:34] like me it's that you have to believe
[1:53:35] the truth
[1:53:38] it's not that you have to believe
[1:53:39] because this is what i say but search
[1:53:41] the scriptures
[1:53:43] see if they be so maybe that's one of
[1:53:45] those other things
[1:53:47] search the scriptures if i do not the
[1:53:50] works
[1:53:51] don't believe me you may not want to say
[1:53:54] that to your co-workers
[1:53:58] maybe they'll look at the works
[1:54:03] is it true or is it not true can we say
[1:54:06] these things are we ashamed to say these
[1:54:09] things
[1:54:11] your spirit and your flesh will make you
[1:54:13] ashamed to say that
[1:54:14] every time and if you
[1:54:17] if your own spirit and your own flesh
[1:54:20] will make you
[1:54:21] ashamed to say that every time don't
[1:54:23] think the person
[1:54:24] at the grocery store or your co-worker
[1:54:26] is not going to try to make you ashamed
[1:54:27] to say it
[1:54:29] but it's true saints and if we say it
[1:54:32] with the right spirit and with the right
[1:54:35] motive
[1:54:37] and it crosses a seed
[1:54:40] i'll say it like brother branham said it
[1:54:42] quickly it will spring to life
[1:54:46] because if somebody
[1:54:49] has the same father as you
[1:54:52] they have no problem with you saying i
[1:54:55] and my father are one
[1:54:59] because they just say oh yeah me too
[1:55:04] but if they have a different father
[1:55:06] they're going to have a problem with
[1:55:07] that saints
[1:55:08] i'll even say it this way if they just
[1:55:11] don't even have a true revelation of who
[1:55:12] their true father is they're still going
[1:55:14] to have a problem with it
[1:55:15] because i wake up and look myself in the
[1:55:16] mirror and i still have a problem with
[1:55:18] me saying that
[1:55:20] but that's why we have to let our shock
[1:55:21] pull away and we have to declare those
[1:55:24] things
[1:55:26] do not be afraid to say that i and my
[1:55:27] father are one do not be afraid to say
[1:55:30] those other things
[1:55:32] we are washed we are justified we are
[1:55:34] sanctified
[1:55:35] in the name of the lord jesus and by the
[1:55:37] spirit of god
[1:55:38] john 6 63 gives us the definition of
[1:55:41] what the spirit of god is
[1:55:42] the words that i speak to you are the
[1:55:45] spirit of god
[1:55:47] they are life
[1:55:51] as we come to a close psalm 103 1-3 says
[1:55:54] bless the lord on my soul and all that
[1:55:56] is within me bless his holy name
[1:55:59] bless the lord o my soul and forget not
[1:56:01] all his benefits
[1:56:03] who forgiveth all thine iniquities
[1:56:06] who healeth all thy diseases
[1:56:09] see the person at work is okay with you
[1:56:11] praying for their disease
[1:56:15] they will recognize something in your
[1:56:16] life that you can pray for them if
[1:56:18] they're sick and they will be healed
[1:56:20] how many how many can witnesses that we
[1:56:22] know that to be true
[1:56:23] the prayer requests come across the the
[1:56:25] desk all the time they recognize there
[1:56:27] is power
[1:56:28] there to forget to heal what is in their
[1:56:31] body what is wrong in their body
[1:56:35] but the first part of that verse says
[1:56:37] who forgiveth all thine iniquities
[1:56:40] who healeth all thy diseases
[1:56:44] huge step between somebody having
[1:56:48] faith in you to pray a prayer and touch
[1:56:50] the throne
[1:56:51] and heal their body but now the words
[1:56:54] that you speak unto them
[1:56:56] are going to forgive them of their
[1:56:57] iniquities
[1:57:02] it's the same power it's the same blood
[1:57:04] it's the same word it's the same spirit
[1:57:06] one goes right with the other isaiah 53
[1:57:10] but he was wounded for our
[1:57:11] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:57:13] iniquities
[1:57:16] they go together saints you cannot have
[1:57:19] the healing of the body
[1:57:21] outside of the same power that can
[1:57:23] forgive somebody of their sins
[1:57:25] it's the same atonement it's the same
[1:57:28] word it's the same spirit
[1:57:30] don't get hung up on that the
[1:57:33] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:57:35] upon him and by his stripes we were
[1:57:38] healed
[1:57:40] church age book the roman church we're
[1:57:43] still dealing with this second
[1:57:44] saying of jesus christ that the son of
[1:57:46] man hath power on earth that forgives
[1:57:48] sin
[1:57:49] the roman church now has become a false
[1:57:51] prophet to us
[1:57:52] to the people because she has taken away
[1:57:54] the word of the lord
[1:57:56] she has taken away the word of the lord
[1:58:00] from the people and given her own ideas
[1:58:02] as to what
[1:58:04] constitutes forgiveness of sins
[1:58:07] she has taken away the word of the lord
[1:58:10] and she has
[1:58:10] given her own idea of what constitutes
[1:58:13] forgiveness of sins
[1:58:15] what brings the blessing of god and the
[1:58:17] priests have gone so far
[1:58:20] as to state categorically that they have
[1:58:24] power not only in life but in death
[1:58:30] notice he did not say that there is not
[1:58:32] a truth to the forgiveness of sins
[1:58:34] he simply said that they have taken the
[1:58:36] word of god away
[1:58:39] this is so simple saints catch it
[1:58:43] how do you forgive sins he says that
[1:58:46] they have given their own idea as to
[1:58:50] what constitutes forgiveness of sins
[1:58:52] but what did they do first they took
[1:58:55] away the word of god
[1:59:00] i'm not the sharpest tool in the shed
[1:59:02] but if they're taking away
[1:59:04] something and putting something in place
[1:59:07] and he's saying
[1:59:08] that's wrong then chances are what they
[1:59:10] took away is the answer
[1:59:13] how do you constitute forgiveness of
[1:59:16] sins by
[1:59:17] giving the word of god how else is the
[1:59:20] word of god
[1:59:21] going to be dispensed in this day and in
[1:59:24] this age
[1:59:26] how else give me another option besides
[1:59:29] you and me
[1:59:31] give me another option besides the
[1:59:33] revealed truth
[1:59:34] as we have it from a vindicated prophet
[1:59:38] give me another option of the word of
[1:59:40] god
[1:59:41] to forgive sins not their saints
[1:59:45] he says we do not look for nail scars
[1:59:49] we look for the word made manifest
[1:59:57] why do we look for that because that's
[1:59:59] what forgives us of our sins
[2:00:02] why would we try to give somebody else
[2:00:04] something else to forgive them of their
[2:00:06] sins
[2:00:07] besides the true word of god it puts us
[2:00:10] in the same category the roman church
[2:00:12] does is in we're taking away
[2:00:15] the truth and we're giving them some
[2:00:17] idea we can't do that
[2:00:20] philadelphian church age he speaks of
[2:00:22] this catholic preached
[2:00:24] he says a catholic priest told me one
[2:00:26] time didn't jesus say whoever sent you
[2:00:28] remit that they're remitted
[2:00:29] i said he said it whosoever sends you
[2:00:32] retain to them they're retained
[2:00:34] that's whosoever you forgive they're
[2:00:36] forgiven whosoever you don't forgive
[2:00:37] they're not forgiven i said that's
[2:00:39] correctly what it said
[2:00:41] he said then didn't christ give his
[2:00:43] church
[2:00:44] which we are his church the power to
[2:00:46] forgive sins on earth
[2:00:47] he certainly did i said now if you'll
[2:00:51] forgive them the same way that they
[2:00:52] forgave them i'll go with you
[2:00:55] yeah he said yes he said how did they
[2:00:58] how did they forgive them did they tell
[2:01:01] them go do anova or something or the way
[2:01:03] you do it
[2:01:04] no sir peter said repent
[2:01:07] amen there's the key repent every one of
[2:01:10] you and be baptized in the name of the
[2:01:11] lord jesus christ for the remission of
[2:01:13] your sins
[2:01:14] and you shall receive the gift of the
[2:01:16] holy ghost
[2:01:18] he did not deny that the power to
[2:01:21] forgive sins was
[2:01:22] present on earth today he says you
[2:01:24] simply have to do it the same way peter
[2:01:25] did it
[2:01:27] it's there it's true it's accurate and
[2:01:29] it's by the spirit of god it's by the
[2:01:31] true revealed word of god
[2:01:33] for your day again as i told you before
[2:01:37] we know these things these things have
[2:01:39] been preached
[2:01:42] we understand the truth behind these but
[2:01:45] let's make it to an individual
[2:01:50] you say oh yeah well if people will come
[2:01:52] to the knowledge of the truth if they'll
[2:01:53] see the truth no
[2:01:54] what if people will see you
[2:01:57] what if people will see you
[2:02:01] will they be forgiven of their sins
[2:02:04] do you live a life do i live a life
[2:02:08] that when people see me they can be
[2:02:11] forgiven of their sins
[2:02:13] or judged by what they've seen do we
[2:02:16] live that life
[2:02:18] do we recognize that we have that power
[2:02:20] it's not a fairy tale we
[2:02:22] literally have that power
[2:02:25] in a lived life and in an appropriate
[2:02:29] explanation of the scriptures for our
[2:02:31] day
[2:02:32] we literally have that
[2:02:37] 1956 jesus christ the same yesterday
[2:02:40] today and forever brother
[2:02:41] says now let's go back and find out
[2:02:43] what's right and what's wrong
[2:02:44] the bible ought to be the solid
[2:02:46] foundation and i believe with all my
[2:02:48] heart
[2:02:48] that this is the unadulterated word of
[2:02:50] god and i believe that anything that's
[2:02:52] contrary to this
[2:02:53] is an error everyone understand that
[2:02:56] i do not believe now listen carefully i
[2:02:59] do not believe
[2:03:00] that there's any person in earth today
[2:03:03] that has power to heal the sick i do not
[2:03:07] believe it
[2:03:08] i do not believe there is a person on
[2:03:10] earth today
[2:03:11] can forgive sin as god would
[2:03:14] he said well that kind of just throws a
[2:03:16] wrench in what you just said for the
[2:03:17] last 10 minutes
[2:03:20] and god doesn't forgive your sins now
[2:03:24] and god doesn't heal you now he's
[2:03:27] already
[2:03:28] done it it's a finished work at calvary
[2:03:31] and our faith rests in what god has
[2:03:34] already done for us
[2:03:37] he's saying as paul said within me there
[2:03:40] lays no good thing
[2:03:42] i look how many people were healed with
[2:03:43] his ministry but yet he would come and
[2:03:45] say there's no man that has the power to
[2:03:47] heal you or forgive your sin
[2:03:48] okay well brother branham what have you
[2:03:50] been doing thousands and thousands and
[2:03:52] thousands of cases
[2:03:53] of people being healed with his ministry
[2:03:57] what he's declaring is i and my father
[2:03:59] are one
[2:04:00] and within me there is no good thing and
[2:04:03] it is what he has done it's what the
[2:04:04] spirit of christ has done
[2:04:06] it is what the word has done there is
[2:04:09] not a man me or you have no ability to
[2:04:12] forgive somebody or to heal somebody
[2:04:14] but the revealed word that is in us
[2:04:18] has that power don't let your
[2:04:21] shuck talk you out of that
[2:04:25] as the musicians would come 1963 the
[2:04:28] fourth seal
[2:04:32] paragraph 291 the antichrist
[2:04:39] the true bride doctrine
[2:04:44] and therefore he takes his own bride now
[2:04:49] and builds her up under a creed
[2:04:52] of his own i want to go really slow on
[2:04:55] this so that you'll catch it
[2:04:57] the antichrist refuses the true bride
[2:04:59] doctrine
[2:05:00] so we have a true bride doctrine and
[2:05:03] therefore he takes his
[2:05:05] own bride now and builds her up
[2:05:09] under a creed of his own so now i've got
[2:05:12] to switch these
[2:05:14] true bride doctrine creed of his own
[2:05:22] he makes her a denomination he gives
[2:05:25] birth to other denominations
[2:05:27] as quoted in this holy scriptures he
[2:05:29] gives birth to daughters
[2:05:31] she became just like her mother natural
[2:05:34] worldly denominational
[2:05:36] opposing the spiritual bride
[2:05:40] the word
[2:05:45] the antichrist refuses the true
[2:05:49] bride doctrine how many wants to have
[2:05:52] the true bride doctrine
[2:05:54] so now if you'll go back to paragraph
[2:05:57] 285 when you're reading this
[2:05:59] he'll tell you what the true bride
[2:06:01] doctrine is
[2:06:02] the paragraph just prior to that now the
[2:06:05] battle started in heaven
[2:06:07] it'll be finished on earth in the form
[2:06:09] of armageddon
[2:06:11] now let's watch and see it unfold
[2:06:14] and maybe we can unfold it what's he
[2:06:17] unfolding the true bride doctrine
[2:06:19] the battle of armageddon
[2:06:23] the lord help us right now to do this
[2:06:25] now
[2:06:26] watch it unfold the mysterious
[2:06:29] writer watch what he does now he opposed
[2:06:36] he refused to repent
[2:06:39] and go back to the original blood
[2:06:43] word
[2:06:48] the word became blood
[2:06:51] and flesh see he refused
[2:06:55] to go back to it it's antichrist
[2:06:58] he is opposed to the true
[2:07:02] word bride takes his
[2:07:05] own bride of creed and denomination
[2:07:08] let's back up and rehash this it's very
[2:07:11] simple
[2:07:12] we have a true bright doctrine
[2:07:16] the true bright doctrine is the word
[2:07:18] became
[2:07:20] blood and flesh don't put that two
[2:07:24] thousand years ago
[2:07:26] the true bride doctrine is the word
[2:07:30] became blood and flesh
[2:07:33] he says that's what satan has refused to
[2:07:36] go
[2:07:37] back to satan can
[2:07:40] go back to everything up
[2:07:43] to that and still be satan
[2:07:50] satan can go back to serpent seed
[2:07:54] satan can go back to water baptism in
[2:07:55] jesus name satan can go back to the
[2:07:58] oneness of the godhead
[2:07:59] satan can go back
[2:08:03] but and when he hits this true bride
[2:08:07] doctrine
[2:08:08] he opposes it what does he oppose
[2:08:13] the word became flesh
[2:08:16] and blood he is opposed
[2:08:20] to the true word bride and he takes his
[2:08:24] own he takes his own what he takes his
[2:08:27] own hybrid mind and flesh
[2:08:29] he takes his own shock he takes his
[2:08:33] own creed and denomination he takes his
[2:08:35] own intellectual conception
[2:08:37] don't leave it on him bring it home if
[2:08:40] we take anything other than jesus christ
[2:08:44] is come in my flesh we have accepted
[2:08:48] the satanic doctrine and we are opposing
[2:08:52] the true bride doctrine which
[2:08:55] is jesus christ is come
[2:08:58] in the flesh i and my father are one
[2:09:02] and these other things number one to
[2:09:05] straighten out the error and explain the
[2:09:06] scriptures with their true spiritual
[2:09:08] meaning
[2:09:09] number two i do have the power on earth
[2:09:12] to forgive sins
[2:09:13] by by proclaiming with a
[2:09:16] lived life the true unadulterated word
[2:09:19] of god
[2:09:22] don't back up on those things
[2:09:25] don't allow your shock to take that away
[2:09:27] from you separate from that shuck
[2:09:30] make sure our focus is on the right
[2:09:32] chuck
[2:09:35] make sure that we're not so busy dealing
[2:09:37] with other
[2:09:38] people or other things or other systems
[2:09:41] that doesn't see this true bright
[2:09:43] doctrine
[2:09:43] that we fail to be this true bright
[2:09:45] doctrine
[2:09:46] that we fail to walk with a perfect
[2:09:49] understanding
[2:09:50] that i and my father are one if you'll
[2:09:53] just play something softly please
[2:09:54] if you'll stand with me i want to read
[2:09:56] this last scripture before we close
[2:09:58] i want to watch i want you to see
[2:10:02] this is not a game saints there is
[2:10:06] no gray area there is not
[2:10:10] any room for kinda and sorta and maybe
[2:10:14] it's either you and your father are one
[2:10:16] or you're not
[2:10:18] right you have to have a father
[2:10:23] it's either one or the other
[2:10:28] first john 4 1-6 we've read part of this
[2:10:32] as we get we begin the service but i
[2:10:34] want to read the last two verses of that
[2:10:35] last three verses beloved
[2:10:39] believe not every spirit
[2:10:43] remember don't put that out there
[2:10:46] put it in here do not believe
[2:10:49] everything that comes through your mind
[2:10:53] but try the spirits whether they are of
[2:10:56] god
[2:10:56] because many false prophets are going
[2:10:59] out into the world
[2:11:00] hereby know ye the spirit of god
[2:11:05] every spirit that confesses confess it
[2:11:07] that
[2:11:08] jesus christ is come in the flesh is of
[2:11:11] god
[2:11:12] and every spirit that confesseth not
[2:11:14] that jesus christ has come in the flesh
[2:11:16] is
[2:11:16] not of god and this is the spirit of
[2:11:22] antichrist
[2:11:24] where did he say the battle was
[2:11:28] in us
[2:11:32] where do you think these spirits are
[2:11:34] going to be saying these things
[2:11:36] in us he said don't believe
[2:11:40] every spirit that speaketh to you check
[2:11:43] it by the word
[2:11:45] and every spirit that confesseth
[2:11:48] that jesus christ is not come in my
[2:11:51] flesh
[2:11:52] is not of god and it is the spirit of
[2:11:55] antichrist
[2:11:58] wherefore ye have heard that it should
[2:12:00] come
[2:12:01] and even now is
[2:12:05] it in the world how could paul say that
[2:12:08] it's here
[2:12:08] and the seals weren't going to be broke
[2:12:10] for thousands of years to tell us who
[2:12:12] that white horse
[2:12:13] writer was because paul
[2:12:16] recognized it writing in himself
[2:12:21] he recognized it in himself that's
[2:12:24] he did not declare it's there
[2:12:28] he declared that it's here it's
[2:12:31] here he didn't declare it's there he
[2:12:33] declared it's here
[2:12:35] and now already is in the world
[2:12:40] ye are of god little children and have
[2:12:42] overcome them
[2:12:43] because greater is he that is in you
[2:12:46] that it he that is in the world
[2:12:49] they are of the world who is they
[2:12:52] who are they your spirit realm
[2:12:55] your flesh realm they are of the world
[2:13:00] therefore speak they of the world and
[2:13:03] the world heareth them
[2:13:05] now when i say they are of the world
[2:13:07] they are in the world that doesn't mean
[2:13:08] that your soul the seed the word that is
[2:13:10] in you cannot resurrect them out of that
[2:13:12] but what i will say it's going to be on
[2:13:14] a daily basis
[2:13:15] because soon as you resurrect them out
[2:13:17] of that and bring them subject to the
[2:13:18] word
[2:13:18] they're going to try to go right back to
[2:13:20] laodicea
[2:13:22] it's a daily occurrence
[2:13:25] with me it's an hourly occurrence and i
[2:13:27] won't even say that with me it's a
[2:13:28] minutely occurrence
[2:13:30] they are of the world therefore they
[2:13:33] speak of the world and the world heareth
[2:13:34] them
[2:13:35] we are of god he that knoweth god
[2:13:39] heareth us he that is
[2:13:42] not of god heareth not us
[2:13:46] hereby know we the spirit of truth
[2:13:51] the true bride doctrine and the spirit
[2:13:54] of error
[2:13:54] the antichrist doctrine
[2:13:59] how do we know that
[2:14:02] hereby know ye the spirit of god every
[2:14:05] spirit that confesseth
[2:14:06] that jesus christ is come
[2:14:10] in the flesh is of god anything
[2:14:14] that will tell you or try to convince
[2:14:16] you otherwise
[2:14:17] through your memory your reason your
[2:14:18] conscience your imagination and your
[2:14:20] affections and your hybrid flesh
[2:14:22] is of the devil and must be resisted
[2:14:27] the same way we resisted him back there
[2:14:29] in heaven and kicked him out
[2:14:30] the battle is now here in us and we
[2:14:34] have to kick him out the same way
[2:14:37] how do we talk about that battle in
[2:14:39] heaven and all i wonder how it would
[2:14:40] have been and what did with you
[2:14:41] since they weren't up there with swords
[2:14:45] they weren't up there with swords the
[2:14:47] battle in heaven
[2:14:49] begin with a jealous spirit you don't
[2:14:52] kill a jealous
[2:14:53] well i guess you could kill a jealous
[2:14:54] spirit with a sword people do it all the
[2:14:56] time
[2:14:57] that's not what they were doing in
[2:14:58] heaven they combated
[2:15:01] an antichrist spirit with the
[2:15:04] true spirit the true bride doctrine
[2:15:08] that when this jealous spirit of i will
[2:15:11] build a kingdom
[2:15:12] greater than that of michael that of
[2:15:14] christ
[2:15:15] when that spirit came in they resisted
[2:15:18] it
[2:15:18] with the true word of god no
[2:15:22] i and my father are one and these other
[2:15:25] things
[2:15:25] and that doesn't match these other
[2:15:27] things
[2:15:29] that's how we kicked him out there
[2:15:31] that's how we'll kick him out here
[2:15:36] you say well that's really shallow
[2:15:37] narrow and just leaves it all with me
[2:15:40] you're right don't put it anywhere else
[2:15:45] when you begin to say i and my father
[2:15:49] are one and these other things
[2:15:52] your shock cannot handle it
[2:15:55] and that's the only time that's the only
[2:15:58] shock that me and you need to be worried
[2:16:00] about
[2:16:01] praise the lord right i laid a really
[2:16:04] loud or a really long foundation
[2:16:06] there's many other things that he says
[2:16:08] we'll get to those some other time lord
[2:16:09] willing but that's two of them
[2:16:11] if you'll go and you'll look at the
[2:16:12] scriptures i'm sure you can find the
[2:16:13] other things
[2:16:15] but remember what those other things are
[2:16:18] they are things that declare i and my
[2:16:20] father are one
[2:16:21] and that causes a division
[2:16:24] from your soul and your
[2:16:28] spirit because your spirit is fallen
[2:16:32] what does the word of god do it divides
[2:16:36] asunder
[2:16:37] between the soul and the spirit
[2:16:42] let's keep the focus there
[2:16:46] and the rest of the shock will take care
[2:16:48] of itself
[2:16:49] don't even worry about it let's pray
[2:16:51] together precious lord jesus as we would
[2:16:54] come to this close of the service lord
[2:16:56] we've been lengthy father
[2:16:59] lord i pray that you would just bless
[2:17:01] the people for their patience and their
[2:17:03] attentiveness lord and
[2:17:04] their pulling on the word lord and i

[2:17:09] be able to take these things that you
[2:17:11] have laid
[2:17:12] so graciously and given us from a
[2:17:15] prophet to
[2:17:16] define and make clear
[2:17:20] these scriptures that we can apply them
[2:17:23] to our daily
[2:17:24] individual life i pray that we would
[2:17:27] take those
[2:17:29] and make them a reality lord that our
[2:17:31] focus would be where it
[2:17:33] needs to be lord and not trying to
[2:17:36] figure out
[2:17:37] something else or someone else but lord
[2:17:41] focusing on us
[2:17:45] the revelation to the individual of the
[2:17:48] individual
[2:17:49] may you give us the grace to do that
[2:17:51] lord we pray that as we would go from
[2:17:54] here that your spirit
[2:17:55] your word your your protection would
[2:17:59] just be upon us your blessing would be
[2:18:01] upon us

[2:18:03] that need healing
[2:18:05] lord that you would find those lost
[2:18:08] sheep of yours that need found
[2:18:10] we would just send your word and your
[2:18:12] spirit to do that which only you can do

[2:18:17] lord and maybe they just
[2:18:19] manifest in our life we give you the
[2:18:22] glory
