[15:47] morning you know I just been thinking
[15:49] about that portion of scripture David
[15:52] says my cup over
[15:55] floweth the more of Christ we can pour
[15:57] into the cup the more of our elves flow
[16:00] out and the more of ourselves that flow
[16:02] out the more we see a reflection of him
[16:05] in our lives cuz that's the goal that's
[16:09] the goal why did Enoch
[16:12] translate
[16:13] completion right I said one time too
[16:17] much word and that was that was a
[16:18] question mark at first and I said no you
[16:20] have to understand so much word the
[16:23] flesh can't hold you back anymore that's
[16:25] my desire that's been my desire since a
[16:28] a young man and uh was baptized at at 9
[16:33] years old and and uh you know as a
[16:35] teenager so you had to remember
[16:37] teenagers don't always
[16:38] know what's going on
[16:41] themselves but I thank the Lord I always
[16:44] cherish the word which is why I ran from
[16:46] being a preacher for so long because the
[16:49] word is such a sacred responsibility
[16:51] amen so we thank you for having us here
[16:52] bring greetings from our pastor brother
[16:54] Paul and Grace Tabernacle and of course
[16:57] greetings from the dean hearts they said
[16:59] oh they there's we love those people so
[17:01] much tell them we said hello so uh we
[17:04] make sure we are responsible for that
[17:06] passing that greetings on Amen thank you
[17:08] brother Blake and musicians just enjoyed
[17:11] that this morning if you have your
[17:12] Bibles and you wouldn't mind turning
[17:14] with me to Isaiah chapter
[17:18] 35 amen like brother Chad said my wife
[17:22] is here and um back there in the corner
[17:26] with her son Alistair and
[17:29] so happy that she could come with me
[17:34] and we're just we just love the Lord we
[17:38] love the word I mean we really love the
[17:40] word I can't think of anything better to
[17:43] do than I my and we'll read here so you
[17:47] can be seated but my
[17:49] greatest uh what what makes me so happy
[17:53] for eternity is the fact that for
[17:56] eternity Christ will be revealing
[17:58] himself because the the the most
[18:01] precious moments in my life is when I
[18:02] open the book and God shows me another
[18:05] part of himself I hadn't seen before
[18:07] nothing gets me more excited nothing
[18:09] gets me more inspired than that and
[18:11] realizing that that get going to happen
[18:13] for
[18:14] eternity I think that's what what heaven
[18:16] means to me Isaiah CH 35 verse one we
[18:21] are going to read the the whole chapter
[18:23] here the Wilderness and the solitary
[18:27] Place shall be glad for them and the
[18:30] desert shall rejoice and Blossom as the
[18:33] rose it shall Blossom abundantly and
[18:36] rejoice even with joy and singing The
[18:39] Glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it
[18:42] the Excellency of Carmel and Sharon they
[18:45] shall see the glory of the Lord and the
[18:47] Excellency of our God strengthen ye the
[18:51] weak hands and confirm the feeble knees
[18:54] say to them that are of a fe fearful
[18:56] heart be strong and fear not behold your
[19:00] God will come with vengeance even god
[19:03] with a recompense he will come and save
[19:05] you then the eyes of the blind shall be
[19:07] opened and the ears of the death death
[19:10] shall be unstopped then shall the lame
[19:13] man leap as an heart and the tongue of
[19:15] the dumb sing for in the wilderness
[19:17] shall Waters break out and streams in
[19:20] the desert and parched ground shall
[19:22] become a pool and the Thirsty land
[19:25] Springs of water in the habitation of
[19:28] dragon dragons where each lay shall be
[19:30] the grass with reeds and
[19:32] rushes and in Highway shall be there and
[19:35] a
[19:36] away and it shall be called the way of
[19:39] Holiness the unclean shall not pass over
[19:41] it but it shall be for those the
[19:43] wayfaring men though fools shall not he
[19:46] therein no lion shall be there nor any
[19:49] ravenous Beast shall go up thereon it
[19:51] shall not be found there but the
[19:53] redeemed shall walk there so it's hidden
[19:56] amen and The Ransom of the the Lord
[19:59] shall return and come to Zion with songs
[20:01] and everlasting Joy upon their heads
[20:04] they shall obtain joy and gladness and
[20:06] sorrow and sighing shall flee away let's
[20:09] bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord you
[20:11] know our desire this
[20:13] morning Father though we are from
[20:17] different places Lord we we all have the
[20:19] same father we all have the same
[20:21] original position in you Lord and we
[20:24] just want you to come this morning and
[20:27] speak to our hearts Lord Jesus as your
[20:29] word would be broken in our midst may
[20:31] you just feed our souls Lord may you may
[20:34] you lift us to a higher plane Lord A A
[20:37] Closer Walk with You Lord that we would
[20:40] see you father again today we ask we
[20:43] love you Lord we commit all these things
[20:44] into your hands Lord may you have your
[20:46] way we pray in jesus' name amen you can
[20:49] be seated
[20:59] so I wanted to take my textt this
[21:01] morning from verse 8 says and a highway
[21:05] shall be there and a way and it shall be
[21:09] called the way of Holiness the unclean
[21:12] shall not pass over it but it shall be
[21:13] for those the wayfaring
[21:15] men and brother bam says that in the
[21:18] unfailing realities of the Living God he
[21:20] says it it does in you just like it did
[21:23] in
[21:26] Christ I love that
[21:29] because that was his purpose of coming
[21:32] to bring God to man and made God and man
[21:37] one that's the message but we took
[21:42] denominations and run him
[21:44] out see too much of man pushes God
[21:49] away that's why the the key to to
[21:53] Christ's Ministry on Earth the key was
[21:55] he was completely harnessed to the will
[21:57] of the father
[22:00] that's all he
[22:02] did he walked into the the pool of
[22:05] Bethesda I believe it was hundreds of
[22:08] people there Desiring to be healed and
[22:11] the disciples no doubt thought this is
[22:12] the moment we'll show the world who this
[22:15] man really is and he goes and he heals a
[22:18] man who who was sick and he he you know
[22:21] was sick for years but he wasn't on
[22:24] death's
[22:25] door he goes he heals him and he walks
[22:30] out Jesus was a man of
[22:33] compassion do you think that was
[22:37] easy you see but he was perfect in flesh
[22:40] because he was not born of a man born of
[22:43] a woman so he couldn't fail but he knew
[22:47] the pole he felt the pole the struggle
[22:49] of those Desiring they a lot of them
[22:51] probably heard the news about Jesus
[22:54] heard people being healed and here he
[22:56] was and he goes just to the man because
[22:59] that's what the father
[23:01] wanted the perfect will of God is the
[23:04] the best place that we can
[23:07] be the perfect will of God is a the
[23:10] manifestation of God's word in flesh
[23:14] because his word is his will that's what
[23:17] the prophet says
[23:20] so he took denominations and run him out
[23:23] he goes on to say took Creeds and run
[23:25] him out now we're on the bypass over
[23:28] here
[23:28] but there's a real true highway so
[23:31] there's a real Highway we can all agree
[23:33] there's a real Highway he says it goes
[23:35] deeper than that he says and a way in
[23:39] the
[23:40] highway so there's a road there's a road
[23:43] that is is right but there's a way in
[23:46] that road that is pure there's a way in
[23:50] that road that is perfection so my title
[23:53] this morning is to walk the narrow road
[23:56] I'd like to take the subject of a
[23:57] transition from church to
[24:01] bride and so the Lord just help us and
[24:03] we'll just Feast around his table this
[24:05] morning and and
[24:07] uh we'll hear what he has to say he goes
[24:10] on to saying the same quote a little bit
[24:12] further down same message he says when
[24:14] Jacob and Esau was born they were both
[24:16] born of a Holy Father and a holy mother
[24:19] but they were twins one a carnal man
[24:22] religious went to church was a good man
[24:25] very good Jacob was a little
[24:28] Shyer but he had his mind on one thing
[24:32] so God never excused Jacob's Behavior he
[24:36] had to pay for his behavior we have to
[24:38] pay for our
[24:39] Behavior but it's not the the Perfection
[24:43] of the conduct or the Perfection of how
[24:45] we how we look and how we know the
[24:47] quotes and we can we can act the part
[24:49] it's what is inside of our soul in our
[24:52] hearts that's what God's God is looking
[24:55] at when Samuel goes to choose the next
[24:58] King The King that God chose he goes
[25:01] through all of the men the of David's
[25:03] Brothers surely one of these is you know
[25:05] tall strong handsome you know this this
[25:09] guy he's a good leader he's got a strong
[25:11] arm and Jesus Christ spoke to said nope
[25:14] none of those because only one of the
[25:17] brothers had what brother was going to
[25:19] say here had on his mind one
[25:23] thing you see you can't you can't give
[25:26] that you are you are destined with that
[25:32] to to have one thing that you desire
[25:34] above above that's what that's what that
[25:37] was the heart of Christ of Jesus he had
[25:39] one
[25:40] thing and you see that at the at the at
[25:44] the the peak the the the the Crux of his
[25:47] life he says not my will Lord but yours
[25:50] be done if I will bear I will drink the
[25:54] cup and that every every believer we
[25:57] have to come to that
[25:59] point a
[26:01] lot over and over and over again and and
[26:05] the deciding factor or the or the the
[26:07] the the the portion that that separates
[26:11] the elect from God from non-elect is
[26:13] they had in their mind that one
[26:17] thing that one
[26:20] thing he says he says that Birthright
[26:23] meant everything to him no matter how he
[26:26] had to get it yeah so so his flesh
[26:30] wasn't manifesting a Son of God his
[26:33] behavior was wasn't was was wrong you
[26:35] know I mean he just his father-in-law
[26:37] cheats him so he cheats his
[26:38] father-in-law back and and th and then
[26:41] this is the man that that had respect
[26:44] for the birthright but God knew he would
[26:47] straighten up that's right God knew that
[26:50] that one thing that he had would begin
[26:53] to to Bud forth would begin to to push
[26:56] out on now getting somewhere begin to
[27:00] push out see you can't you can't hold
[27:02] that
[27:03] back because do you know do you know
[27:06] that Darkness isn't a
[27:08] thing it's not a substance fear is not a
[27:12] substance faith is a
[27:15] substance light is a
[27:18] substance so as light comes forth
[27:21] Darkness has but no choice to move
[27:25] away so God took Jacob and he grinded
[27:28] him down he put a man before him who was
[27:31] just like
[27:34] him we say that all the time he says boy
[27:37] this this brother just man I just I I
[27:40] want to love him and I want but and it
[27:42] your wife's or you know somebody who's
[27:44] real close to you it's say well you know
[27:45] you act just like him see God will put
[27:48] somebody before you that's a mirror to
[27:49] show you that's that's your behavior
[27:51] that's right and when you look in the
[27:54] glass Darkly you don't want to see Jacob
[27:57] you want to see Israel
[27:59] you want to see a man of God you want to
[28:00] see a sister of Christ right you want to
[28:03] be in that position so Jacob had to God
[28:06] put him through the the pressure put him
[28:09] through this to
[28:11] manifest what was inside of him that
[28:13] desire for the birthright that desire to
[28:17] hold
[28:18] that to hold that position in the family
[28:21] of God he says because the Bible said
[28:24] that he was elected before the
[28:25] foundation of the world to look to that
[28:29] cuz predestination is is goes back to
[28:31] for knowledge so God knew the choices
[28:34] you were making you would make and
[28:37] that's
[28:38] predestination he knew you would go for
[28:40] that because he put something in you to
[28:41] go for
[28:42] that he says and today there's people I
[28:46] don't care how much popularity they have
[28:48] to to use or how much they have to lose
[28:51] is what he's saying or what they have to
[28:53] do makes no difference to them if
[28:55] they're called old-fashioned no mother
[28:58] no matter what they are they got their
[29:00] eyes on Christ because they were elected
[29:03] to eternal
[29:05] life and they plant right there on that
[29:09] if it takes everything if it takes
[29:11] everything they got they plant right
[29:15] there is it is it a is it a location on
[29:17] planet
[29:18] Earth right no it's it's a it's a it's a
[29:23] resting place of your faith in God's
[29:26] word all that that rock which is
[29:29] revelation of who Christ is so he says
[29:32] the other is a nominal man he goes to
[29:34] church and he feels just as good as the
[29:36] rest of them goes home see that's that's
[29:40] the Esau
[29:41] like see and the other one is Jacob like
[29:44] now there you are both
[29:49] sides and he says something a little
[29:51] further
[29:52] down and and to me the last few line few
[29:55] words of this line just really spoke to
[29:57] my heart when I was in study stud
[29:59] night inside of me I was running around
[30:01] in
[30:02] circles he says what I can't understand
[30:05] it is why would people want to get some
[30:07] old ecclesiastical weeds but he says
[30:10] when the rock is full of
[30:14] honey I mean I wanted to to write that
[30:16] on the walls of my office when the RO
[30:18] the rock is full of Honey to me that
[30:21] just that's just a bomb on my soul the
[30:24] that the rock is full of
[30:26] honey so
[30:28] so we see here that within the highway
[30:33] there's there's a way there's a there's
[30:35] a higher way and and
[30:38] and the desire that we have in
[30:42] us to to reach Perfection we're not
[30:46] perfect you know we're are we still here
[30:48] okay we're still here so we haven't
[30:50] reached that point uh that point but
[30:52] that's our goal and and and Perfection
[30:55] is our is our goal Perfection meaning
[30:57] the full manifestation of the word of
[31:00] God in our lives
[31:02] and there there's a road you can walk
[31:05] you can you Esau was there he was
[31:07] walking he was he was partaking but
[31:09] there's something
[31:11] deeper in the word there's there's a
[31:15] there's more to the word and Christ came
[31:18] in in in our day and in his in his
[31:22] revealing of himself there was a there
[31:24] was a transition right and and what he
[31:29] was doing was he was transitioning and
[31:31] and for brother brandham being here when
[31:34] he was
[31:35] here that message was was for a later
[31:39] people and he Faithfully stood there he
[31:41] taught that but what what is God doing
[31:44] God's Desiring to bring a
[31:46] bride from the
[31:49] church so there's a highway and there's
[31:52] a way so there has to be a separating
[31:55] point and and you can the simple the
[31:59] simple part of that is that separation
[32:01] is the is the desire for the one thing
[32:04] the desire for the birthright and what
[32:07] that desire does is it pulls you it it
[32:11] pulls you right into the way but as you
[32:16] pull into the way you you you you you
[32:20] have says the road the W rain washes the
[32:23] trash on either side so you have things
[32:25] on either side that are distracting
[32:27] that's right and sometimes sometimes we
[32:31] we stop
[32:32] looking down down the road my wife my
[32:34] wife gets me for this all the time
[32:36] because we do a lot of traveling in by
[32:38] by car and you're not looking at the
[32:40] road you hit the rumble strip right but
[32:44] sometimes you get your eye off of where
[32:45] you're going but but the desire in your
[32:49] heart for that thing for to line up with
[32:52] God's word it's that desire that pulls
[32:56] you into the way
[32:58] and we are called to walk the narrow
[33:00] road and
[33:02] but this the so the disciples here we'll
[33:05] go to Luke
[33:07] 24 verse 13 and the
[33:14] disciples here they are they they they
[33:16] have this this this man Jesus you who do
[33:20] who do men say that I am but who who do
[33:22] you say that that I am Peter says Thou
[33:24] Art the son of God
[33:28] they were
[33:30] testifying there there was Miracles I I
[33:32] want you to put yourself in their shoes
[33:35] which technically in this day and age
[33:37] you are in their
[33:39] shoes but really think about this
[33:41] because I think by God's grace we we can
[33:44] bring
[33:45] this down home to an important part of
[33:48] our
[33:49] lives this here's the Messiah and and
[33:52] people are starting to realize it's the
[33:56] Messiah 5,000 are fed and I think it was
[33:59] 7,000 or another another many thousands
[34:01] fed Miracles and and and you can read
[34:04] you can find it in the early which I
[34:06] don't remember which gospel it was but
[34:07] you can find it brother or brother
[34:09] brandom Jesus had a prayer line and just
[34:11] healed all the sick it said that came to
[34:13] him so this this is going out and I know
[34:16] there's so much in here we could hit but
[34:18] we're we're trying not to get too too
[34:20] far down a money Trail but this is the
[34:23] man then there's I mean there's 70 or
[34:25] more walking with him and and the
[34:28] disciples and and they're going and then
[34:29] they go he Jesus sends the disciples to
[34:33] go preach and and heal and and deliver
[34:35] and all this and they come back saying
[34:38] my goodness the devils are subject to us
[34:41] and he says he says no no no no no he
[34:43] says Rejoice cuz your name's written in
[34:45] heaven okay so there was something about
[34:47] them and he's he's he's trying to point
[34:49] them and and he begins to work on them
[34:52] right through the word he drops things
[34:56] to them along the way and they're
[34:59] oblivious that's
[35:02] right because God has a God's Will has a
[35:05] time and the season that's right so they
[35:08] come and and here's
[35:10] Jesus then then all of a sudden he says
[35:13] unless you eat my flesh or drink my
[35:14] blood you have no part with me
[35:18] right now there's a
[35:20] separation so the 70 said we you know we
[35:23] can't do this anymore and and and Peter
[35:26] is probably there thinking man this is
[35:27] really bad for the campaign we're going
[35:29] to lose a lot of reviews that's
[35:33] right and and and it was a struggle from
[35:36] then you know he couldn't even go to
[35:38] Jerusalem and then when it came time he
[35:42] went and he goes and the disciples are
[35:44] are saying you know I don't think this
[35:45] is a good idea they want to kill you
[35:47] because the disciples had a a vision
[35:51] right you see we we we'll get to a place
[35:53] we got a vision is that vision
[35:58] wrong in in in its motives maybe not but
[36:02] the objective was Christ had something
[36:05] he needed to do that's right he needed
[36:08] to pull a bride from the church that's
[36:11] right and in order to do that he had to
[36:14] lay himself completely down he had to he
[36:18] had to fulfill redemption's plan he he
[36:21] could hear Adam
[36:23] calling he he thought of Eve he thought
[36:26] of you but the joy that was set before
[36:28] him amen but the disciples were very
[36:32] confused and he has a Passover with them
[36:36] and and he breaks bread and he and he
[36:38] and he and they have communion the first
[36:40] communion and they they wash the he
[36:42] washes their
[36:44] feet and and they go to the Garden you
[36:46] know he goes to the
[36:49] cross and he and he dies on the cross
[36:52] and he's buried in the Tomb
[36:59] and you we've all been there on our
[37:02] Christian walk where God begins to
[37:03] reveal something to
[37:05] us but other things around us pull from
[37:10] that and if we're not careful we we
[37:12] start to question it because of the
[37:14] outside
[37:15] pressure but God is so faithful and he
[37:19] keeps pointing you back this this this
[37:24] and everything you know disagrees with
[37:28] this but there's something in your heart
[37:30] that says I can't let it go so here the
[37:34] disciples are
[37:36] and they they're they they're sitting
[37:40] around saying they're afraid you know
[37:42] we're
[37:44] next and they're sitting around and and
[37:46] they're saying woman were we wrong no
[37:49] Peter Noah we were right I I know this
[37:52] man is is who he said he was and and and
[37:56] and then the outside world saying look
[37:59] just another crazy prophet and he's dead
[38:02] everything the church you have to
[38:03] remember that they grew up with the
[38:05] church they they were there they were so
[38:07] it's it's really
[38:09] close it's a Razor's Edge right so there
[38:12] they are and and but something in their
[38:14] heart keeps
[38:15] saying it's it's I I just I thought it
[38:18] was a truth it's got to be the truth you
[38:21] know one side of their flesh says look
[38:23] buddy you lost your mind go back to the
[38:25] fish but some in his in their hearts
[38:28] kept testifying back
[38:31] saying it's
[38:33] true it's true and you would think you
[38:36] know in that process that that somehow
[38:38] they would go back to what Jesus said I
[38:40] mean he was pretty pointed the son of
[38:43] man will go on the earth three days rise
[38:45] again and you think they would go back
[38:47] but you see what happens is is the devil
[38:50] first of all just so you remember the
[38:52] devil can't do nothing that God doesn't
[38:54] allow that's right cuz God loves to put
[38:56] the pressure on his people he sees your
[38:59] faith and he tests your faith he saw
[39:02] job's Faith so he tested job to the
[39:06] Perfection of job not to prove a point
[39:08] to the devil but to bring a perfection
[39:11] in job even more see job thought he was
[39:13] we would look at job's life and we would
[39:15] say my goodness what a man of God but
[39:17] God said no there's more to bring out in
[39:20] job so here the disciples are and and um
[39:28] more to more to bring I went on the
[39:30] story of job and I don't remember where
[39:31] I was but so Luke Luke 24 we'll just
[39:35] jump right back to my notes and and then
[39:36] God will bring it back to us Luke
[39:40] 24:13 so here do you have here you have
[39:43] the disciples and and two of them decide
[39:45] you know we're going to we're going to
[39:46] walk down to
[39:48] emus which is from Jerusalem about three
[39:50] score furlongs verse 14 and they talked
[39:53] together of all these things which had
[39:54] happened and it came to pass that while
[39:56] they commun together and reasoned Jesus
[39:59] himself Drew near and went with
[40:03] them but their eyes were Holden that
[40:05] they should not know him and he said
[40:08] unto them what manner of communications
[40:11] are these that you have one to another
[40:14] as you walk and are
[40:16] sad and one of them whose name was
[40:19] Copus answering said unto him art thou
[40:21] only a stranger in Jerusalem and Hast
[40:24] not known the things which are come to
[40:25] pass there in these days
[40:28] and he said unto them what
[40:31] things and they said unto him concerning
[40:34] Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet
[40:37] Mighty indeed and word before God and
[40:39] all the people and how the chief priests
[40:41] and our rulers delivered him to be
[40:43] condemned to death and have crucified
[40:45] him but we trusted that it had been he
[40:48] which should have redeemed Israel but we
[40:52] trusted so so here they are in this
[40:54] place and and sometimes you just you
[40:56] just you need a you you need a you need
[40:57] to take a
[40:58] walk you need to take a drive or you
[41:01] know you need you need to you need to
[41:03] you need some movement you need some
[41:05] Direction so they said well we'll go
[41:08] down to emus why I don't know because as
[41:10] soon as Jesus broke bread they went back
[41:13] so what they were doing down there I'm
[41:14] not sure but maybe amas had a nice a
[41:16] nice coffee shop you maybe they had a
[41:19] world class cinnamon roll or something
[41:20] and so they they were walking just let's
[41:22] just you know hey you know Copus let's
[41:25] let's go for a walk let's walk on down
[41:27] and you see God is is is the the amazing
[41:32] part to me is how faithful God is
[41:33] because these are his children but he's
[41:36] putting them to the test and and and and
[41:38] Jesus who they
[41:40] thought you see have to remember who
[41:43] they thought but they still knew they
[41:45] thought we we trusted that this was the
[41:47] man but there was still something in
[41:48] their heart that couldn't let go of it
[41:51] if it was they would have just been like
[41:52] the 70 and be like wow we were really
[41:54] wrong let's go find something else to do
[41:56] but they couldn't let Let It Go that's
[41:58] right Jacob he couldn't let the he
[41:59] couldn't let it go he had to get the
[42:01] birthright by whatever means necessary
[42:03] and so here are these men and they're
[42:05] call of God and and they're on the road
[42:07] which is kind of where our text comes
[42:08] from too they're on the road and it's
[42:10] and it's on the road that that Jesus
[42:12] comes now now they had already heard
[42:15] Peter had ran to the selr and there was
[42:17] a the sisters that come back and said
[42:19] you know he's alive Peter and John they
[42:21] run to the SRE and the body's not
[42:24] there and and they're still confused
[42:27] that's right they're still confused
[42:29] because the only
[42:31] way that you can understand amen that
[42:34] you can have Revelation is when God
[42:37] speaks to
[42:38] you that's why he had to come back come
[42:42] back to them he could have just
[42:43] resurrected and went into Glory you see
[42:45] he doesn't need to prove
[42:47] anything but he needed he had some some
[42:50] some men and some Women of Faith who
[42:53] needed a
[42:55] revelation see so he he completed
[42:57] redemption's plan and he went back to
[43:01] them he came to them and he said look he
[43:05] he says well you know he walks up to
[43:06] them why are you sad and you see I love
[43:09] this because he didn't just walk up and
[43:11] say it's
[43:12] me he himself God in flesh used his own
[43:17] word to reveal himself to
[43:20] them see God doesn't break his
[43:23] pattern God doesn't you're you're
[43:25] looking at the word in flesh I'm looking
[43:28] at the word in flesh but how are you
[43:31] revealed through the
[43:33] word not you coming and saying look at
[43:38] me by your fruits you shall know them
[43:42] it's a fruit of the mouth the fruit of
[43:43] the life what it what what identifies
[43:46] you is your word who you are is
[43:49] identified by Your Word so Jesus he's
[43:52] standing there and he begins to speak to
[43:54] them and and I would have loved to sit
[43:58] in on that sermon he started in he
[44:01] started
[44:02] in oh help me where's my
[44:08] spot he says oh fools verse 25 oh fools
[44:11] slow of heart to believe all that the
[44:12] prophets have spoken on not Christ to
[44:15] have suffered these things and to enter
[44:17] into his glory and beginning at Moses
[44:20] and all the prophets he expounded unto
[44:22] them in all the scriptures the things
[44:24] concerning himself so Jesus in flesh
[44:28] Christ in flesh goes to the word and
[44:31] from the word begins to speak to them
[44:35] and from the word begins to open up
[44:37] himself to them you know that you they
[44:41] were the first
[44:43] ones and and and and and it comes to
[44:46] this place where they they get to where
[44:47] they're going and and he's he fakes like
[44:50] he's going to go on they said no no no
[44:52] or he acts like he's going to walk on he
[44:53] says no no no come have come sit with us
[44:55] and what does he do he breaks
[44:58] bread
[45:02] sir Passover he broke the
[45:05] bread with the two on the road to maze
[45:08] he broke the bread and in our day how do
[45:11] you how do you come to that position
[45:13] it's a Breaking of the bread it's an
[45:16] opening of the word because he says I am
[45:18] the bread of life and we know that if he
[45:21] says he's the bread of life we can go to
[45:23] John where says in the beginning was the
[45:24] word the word is with God and the word
[45:26] was God so the word of God is the bread
[45:29] of life but unless it's broken you see
[45:31] they didn't slice bread back then they
[45:33] broke it open unless it's broken open
[45:36] then their eyes were
[45:39] opened you see God had the desire to to
[45:42] he he saw you he saw you in this place
[45:45] of of
[45:46] confusion he saw you with a desire to to
[45:50] to go deeper be see they were already
[45:51] followers of
[45:53] Jesus they were already followers of
[45:55] Jesus
[45:57] so they're already walking along the
[45:59] highway but there was a way in the
[46:03] highway and and and so God wanted to
[46:05] transition them to this position this
[46:10] position this this this place on the
[46:12] highway called the way why did he need
[46:15] them
[46:17] there he needed them there because
[46:20] there's that's the way to Christ that is
[46:24] the way to eternal life that is the way
[46:27] and he wants he wants us more than we
[46:30] want him he wants us to be a part of him
[46:33] to to spend eternity with him more than
[46:36] we even want
[46:38] that and the way is how you get there
[46:43] the way is and and it and it's it's it's
[46:45] a narrow way it's a straight
[46:49] way it's a hard way the disciples they
[46:52] had to go against everything he was
[46:54] asking them to believe something that
[46:56] was impossible
[46:57] that's
[46:58] right they didn't understand it break
[47:01] eat my flesh drink my
[47:04] blood I don't know but this is the thing
[47:08] this is the one thing that speaks to my
[47:10] heart this man holds the truth I don't
[47:13] understand what you're saying but I hold
[47:15] to the fact that you are the
[47:17] truth and then God then he comes and he
[47:21] reveals himself through them or into
[47:24] them through them
[47:25] too but you see he he he was he was he
[47:28] was asking them they're they're in the
[47:30] upper room they're on the road to EMAs
[47:32] he's he's asking them believe I have
[47:34] come back to life believe that I that I
[47:37] am returned believe that and to them it
[47:40] seemed
[47:42] impossible it seemed impossible but you
[47:45] see God comes in that
[47:48] transition and he showed himself
[47:51] personally to all of them to the two on
[47:54] the road to emus and he comes back and
[47:56] and he's there in the room with
[47:58] them and
[48:03] um it's in it's it's that it's that
[48:06] period of time where where there's where
[48:07] there's where that there's a transition
[48:10] and and sometimes in that space of time
[48:14] we we know it's the truth things are
[48:16] pulling back from it but something in
[48:18] our heart says I think no this is this
[48:21] is the truth and in that moment God
[48:24] comes directly to you
[48:28] lest you lest you falter or lest you
[48:30] miss the mark he comes directly to you
[48:32] and shows himself to you personally so
[48:36] in in in Matthew
[48:39] 3:3 we're going to read here I just it's
[48:41] just this scripture here you can turn if
[48:43] you'd
[48:47] like I'm sorry I go through a lot of
[48:49] water when I
[48:50] preach says for this is he that was
[48:52] spoken of by the prophet Isaiah saying
[48:56] the voice of one crying in the
[48:58] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[49:02] Lord and make his path
[49:07] straight so there had to
[49:10] come
[49:11] preparation for the transition there had
[49:15] to come a Ministry to point to prepare
[49:20] the way not the highway the
[49:24] way you see there's always you see God
[49:27] but there's always more of God there's
[49:30] always a deeper part of
[49:34] God like the back part of his mind right
[49:37] that's a deep that's a deeper place and
[49:39] and when you say deeper not more
[49:43] complicated further
[49:46] in the more you go into Christ the
[49:49] simpler Christ
[49:51] becomes you go
[49:54] deeper not more mysterious not more
[49:57] mystical but further into Christ because
[50:01] the goal is to what the more Christ you
[50:04] get the less flesh you deal
[50:08] with that's why he said the rapturing
[50:11] faith is laying in the word because it
[50:14] is a word himself word himself revealing
[50:16] to you and as it reveals to
[50:20] you one day there's not going to be any
[50:23] room for anything but word
[50:26] and we are creatures of light time and
[50:30] matter and word is
[50:34] eternal
[50:37] so you can't
[50:39] hold this Dimension Can't Hold Back
[50:43] eternity right now we're we're holding
[50:45] you know we're holding it back if you if
[50:47] you could say that you understand God
[50:49] has his
[50:50] plan so the more you the more you take
[50:53] of the Eternal the less
[50:56] finite you
[50:58] become which the world says that's
[51:01] pretty
[51:03] strange but brother re says there's an
[51:05] eternal quality to the
[51:08] elect so something inside of
[51:11] you something inside of you
[51:14] grows well that's that's eternity
[51:16] growing inside of
[51:18] you because you have an eternal quality
[51:21] so there's something already in you that
[51:24] can connect to Eternity right you see
[51:26] your theophany is your Eternal version
[51:29] of
[51:32] yourself and so much word light light
[51:36] word is light the word of God is the
[51:38] light of
[51:40] Life did you know that light if you
[51:42] could speed up to the to the speed of
[51:44] light time would stand still it's a
[51:46] theory of
[51:48] relativity but light itself the
[51:51] particles of light photons they never
[51:54] die
[51:57] in this world we live in light the
[51:59] photon particle of light according to
[52:02] science and I and I quote has an
[52:05] existence of an eternal
[52:08] now and he says I am the light of life
[52:14] and you are the light of the world right
[52:17] sir so there's an eternal quality to the
[52:20] elect that's right not only spiritually
[52:23] but
[52:25] physically cuz you're you're a creature
[52:26] of
[52:27] light so as the word comes and energizes
[52:31] that something begins to speed up the
[52:34] Bible says Redeeming the time you see
[52:37] God is outside of time God is not bound
[52:39] by time and we say we say oh we are the
[52:42] thoughts of God
[52:46] expressed but Mar says the thoughts of
[52:48] God are not like a man's blueprint where
[52:51] he says okay now it's time to put the
[52:54] banister there he says God
[52:57] thoughts and I paraphrase are not
[52:59] potentially substance they are currently
[53:04] substance so when we say you are the
[53:07] thought of God
[53:09] expressed we're saying now the thought
[53:12] of God has been manifested in time
[53:15] that's
[53:16] right so his thought was always there
[53:19] you were always there in him that's
[53:20] right I mean the world is time is
[53:24] unfolding beneath Vis it that way maybe
[53:27] that's not correct but just God looking
[53:30] at time and time is manifesting and then
[53:33] he puts you into a
[53:35] spot you always were a thought right
[53:40] your life with him eternally is
[53:42] currently substance that's right because
[53:45] eternity and you being the bride sitting
[53:48] up there with Christ on the
[53:50] throne is a thought of God but it's not
[53:53] potentially substance it is currently
[53:56] substance
[53:58] right the sons of God were gathered
[54:00] around and the the Lord asks the devil
[54:03] what have you been doing job up there
[54:06] with them sons of God and job manifested
[54:09] in time so while there Devil's looking
[54:12] over there and you think he would catch
[54:14] a clue and say well I don't got a chance
[54:15] cuz there's job
[54:17] already you see but the devil's going to
[54:19] try his hard as he can any any being
[54:22] that will fight against God himself you
[54:24] know there's there's something not quite
[54:26] right
[54:27] upstairs but but you see you you your
[54:30] your position in Christ is not
[54:33] potential it is current in God's
[54:36] mind and and and in order for you to
[54:39] reach that point I and sometimes I feel
[54:42] like to get to the point of a sermon
[54:45] it's almost like it's a little bit hid
[54:47] sometimes and you can't quite say it
[54:49] exactly verbatim how you want to because
[54:51] God wants you to catch a revelation of
[54:53] it so we just yield to the anointing of
[54:56] the Lord and he'll speak to you and
[54:57] he'll deal with you and you will hear
[54:59] what you need to hear to go further on
[55:01] in your
[55:03] journey so it's it's it's a position you
[55:06] hold right now you say but I'm in a dead
[55:09] body doesn't matter that's right doesn't
[55:12] matter if you are a part of God you hold
[55:15] that position already so your theophany
[55:16] is waiting for you he's uh you speed up
[55:20] the next Dimension is just a little bit
[55:21] faster right well if you speed up to the
[55:23] speed of light time is relative it it
[55:26] just just
[55:27] stops so even in God's Universe there's
[55:30] a
[55:32] way there's a way for the finite to
[55:34] become
[55:37] infinite and the way to get there is to
[55:40] walk the way John came to prepare the
[55:44] way of the Lord what was he doing he was
[55:47] getting a people ready he was giving a
[55:50] message out saying sometime along the
[55:53] way you're going to along the highway
[55:55] you're going to see something
[55:56] that's going to feel
[55:58] impossible but it's the
[56:01] way it is the narrow way and and even
[56:04] even even even those around you the
[56:06] church might not might not might resist
[56:11] that might resist that but there's a
[56:15] way and it is the way of the pure and
[56:19] the holy the unclean shall not pass
[56:22] there through you see that scripture in
[56:24] Isaiah I just love that because to me
[56:27] that's my life when Christ came inside
[56:29] the Wilderness and the solitary Place
[56:31] shall be glad the desert shall rejoice
[56:33] and Blossom as a rose see what what is
[56:36] it that manifests the word inside of you
[56:39] is when you come up and you line up in
[56:40] the
[56:42] way and and that transition to the way
[56:46] that transition is God calling you
[56:48] calling you from the world then calling
[56:50] you even higher I I tried to find it but
[56:53] I couldn't remember how many of you have
[56:54] read the higher calling that's right
[56:57] he's in there I can't remember the
[56:59] missionary that wrote that I I kept
[57:01] thinking William Tindell but it's not
[57:02] him it's it's somebody else and he says
[57:05] you will try to make a success but God
[57:08] won't let you that's right so you see
[57:11] you see you have something inside of
[57:13] you you have something inside of you you
[57:16] you you you you have this desire for the
[57:18] word this desire for Christ to manifest
[57:21] himself in you to to to fully Express
[57:24] himself through you and and and
[57:26] sometimes we're afraid to make a step in
[57:28] a direction sometimes we're afraid to
[57:30] make a choice but I say this are you not
[57:33] a son of God is God not true is his word
[57:37] not true you step and it's wrong he'll
[57:39] turn your
[57:41] foot you see we must walk with humble
[57:44] confidence he say how do you do that how
[57:47] do you not walk arrogant you see what is
[57:49] arrogance it's the devil's perversion of
[57:50] what God's called his people to right
[57:53] God wants you to walk and saying I'm a
[57:55] son of God God's word is true all right
[57:59] here I go yeah now what are you doing as
[58:01] you walk can I walk down the steps as
[58:04] you walk down and you step and and the
[58:07] Way's over there and you're walking
[58:09] along and you think serpent seed wow
[58:12] right the ways right there and you
[58:15] think man Christ God the
[58:18] godhead now you step a little bit closer
[58:20] in the whole time Gods corre you ever
[58:22] had drive a car with lane lane assist
[58:26] God's saying hey you're going one lay or
[58:28] the other beep beep beep beep hand on
[58:30] the steering wheel put your hand on the
[58:33] steering wheel he says oh God's in
[58:35] control brother put your hand on the
[58:37] steering
[58:38] wheel God wants you to he says he says
[58:41] those that hear my word and do them yes
[58:45] we have been given a power in the word
[58:46] of God to do them and we say power and
[58:49] we can we can think of of of crazy
[58:51] mystical things but you know what the
[58:53] power is to overcome the flesh
[58:56] that is your
[58:57] goal and you need the
[59:00] flesh you couldn't be perfected without
[59:02] it you see we always say oh I can't wait
[59:04] to lay this flesh down and and get rid
[59:06] of this robe of Flesh why don't you just
[59:08] get into subjection get the flesh into
[59:11] subjection and watch what happens in
[59:12] your life the Perfection of that the
[59:15] Perfection of the finite subjected to
[59:18] the word of God is an eternal transition
[59:26] when you catch the power of the word of
[59:28] God and how Eternal it the Eternal
[59:30] quality that it holds you'll never put
[59:33] the book
[59:35] down what do you what do we need we
[59:37] we're hungry where we want to be fed we
[59:40] got to eat and eat and eat and eat and
[59:44] and and and the word of God is so pure
[59:46] you you never get
[59:48] stuffed you never get
[59:51] sick you just get stronger and stronger
[59:54] in God's word and and you get
[59:58] humbler he says in the evidence of the
[1:00:00] Resurrection little did I know as the
[1:00:02] angel spoke down here at the river
[1:00:04] before you all and said as John was sent
[1:00:06] as a forerunner of the first coming
[1:00:08] you'll send a message around the world
[1:00:09] it's
[1:00:12] happened every nation even up into
[1:00:14] Russia yes sir everywhere healing
[1:00:16] Services going on would have died down
[1:00:19] now there's something greater
[1:00:21] moving I'm waiting to hear the sound of
[1:00:24] the rushing of the mberry leaves I'm
[1:00:26] going on pray for me
[1:00:30] 1958 so the Disciples of John are there
[1:00:34] and now here is the
[1:00:37] way manifested in flesh before them and
[1:00:40] they had heard the highway John the
[1:00:44] Baptist preaching of that to come and
[1:00:48] and they're still following
[1:00:50] John so they're still on the
[1:00:53] road but there's a way
[1:00:57] he came to prepare the way you know the
[1:00:59] pavers they go out there they pave the
[1:01:00] road they're not responsible for where
[1:01:03] you drive on that road but they pave the
[1:01:06] way they PVE the road but there's a way
[1:01:10] there's the center line in that road so
[1:01:13] they come to Jesus and John's John's
[1:01:15] questioning his position you know do we
[1:01:18] seek for another but there was and not
[1:01:21] to make that to go on that point but
[1:01:23] there there was this this is evidence
[1:01:25] that there were these people people they
[1:01:26] were back there with John but
[1:01:27] then there was a transition and then
[1:01:30] those they heard the message of John and
[1:01:32] and and Paul comes to them and says have
[1:01:34] you been baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:01:35] Christ and they says we know not of any
[1:01:38] baptism because we were baptized in unto
[1:01:41] John un repentance I can't remember
[1:01:42] exactly how the scripture goes and Paul
[1:01:45] came to show them you're on the highway
[1:01:47] but there's a
[1:01:49] way you see there's always a higher
[1:01:53] plane there's always another level on
[1:01:56] the Statue of a perfect man there's
[1:01:58] always a deeper part of God we must
[1:02:00] attain to we must move
[1:02:02] to and so he says he says in leaty and
[1:02:06] church age so we can well see from these
[1:02:09] scriptures that the prophet in Malachi 3
[1:02:11] who was John was not the prophet of
[1:02:13] Malachi 4 though indeed both John and
[1:02:15] this last day Prophet have upon them the
[1:02:17] same Spirit which is upon Elijah and I
[1:02:20] understand you are all aware of this
[1:02:21] stuff let me make a point now this
[1:02:23] messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelations
[1:02:25] 10:7 is going to do two things one
[1:02:28] according to Malachi 4 he will turn the
[1:02:30] hearts of the children to the fathers
[1:02:32] two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:02:34] seven thunders in Revelations 10 which
[1:02:37] are the revelations contained in the
[1:02:39] Seven
[1:02:40] Seals it will be these divinely revealed
[1:02:43] mystery truths that literally turn the
[1:02:45] hearts of the children to the
[1:02:46] Pentecostal fathers exactly so so in our
[1:02:50] day in their day the way was Christ
[1:02:54] resurrected the day of Pentecost walking
[1:02:56] in the word and they were the
[1:02:59] original there was a transition period
[1:03:01] and that was that was their calling but
[1:03:02] then those Divine truths became a
[1:03:06] mystery
[1:03:08] amen and so now today we we have we have
[1:03:13] the word of God and we and we have it
[1:03:15] open but do you
[1:03:18] know God came and he opened it brother
[1:03:21] man's Ministry paved the
[1:03:23] way but have you found the way
[1:03:26] the road is there the highway is there
[1:03:28] and you're you're walking on it but have
[1:03:30] you found the way have you reached that
[1:03:33] position in Christ because God has a
[1:03:35] goal that is to pull a bride from a
[1:03:37] church he's not calling for status quo
[1:03:41] that's he's calling for a surrender you
[1:03:43] see
[1:03:46] everything a lot of times we we will
[1:03:49] hear it and we'll even lie lie to
[1:03:50] ourselves and say well I just can't see
[1:03:52] it that way really what it is is you
[1:03:55] just won't surrender that
[1:03:57] way many times you situations in our
[1:04:00] lives we know the word we just don't
[1:04:03] want to surrender to it but you see
[1:04:06] we're not called to walk the
[1:04:08] highway nobody's going to forget this
[1:04:10] line we're called to walk the way so in
[1:04:14] other words there is perfection within
[1:04:15] the word more than just the word a
[1:04:19] deeper part of God that he wants us to
[1:04:22] see because everybody not me more than
[1:04:23] the word but more than just the Bible
[1:04:26] the whole world has the Bible and
[1:04:28] they're more heathenistic than they were
[1:04:31] before and they're reading from the
[1:04:33] Bible because there's a way in the
[1:04:35] highway there's a way there that God
[1:04:37] wants you to see but the only way to
[1:04:39] reach that is is not to have a a mental
[1:04:42] you know like like understand the
[1:04:44] doctrine by knowledge but is for the
[1:04:46] doctrine for the truth of the word to go
[1:04:49] down into your heart you see you're
[1:04:51] sitting here and your brain is hearing a
[1:04:53] voice spoken and it's transmitting that
[1:04:55] to your brain and your brain is
[1:04:56] formulating thoughts and then God gets a
[1:04:58] hold of those thoughts and now it goes
[1:05:00] into your heart and it begins to change
[1:05:02] you yes sir what is happening eternity
[1:05:05] is growing inside of
[1:05:07] you God is manifesting inside of you and
[1:05:11] you look back and you say I used to do
[1:05:13] that and I don't anymore what
[1:05:16] happened sister when did you get the
[1:05:18] Holy
[1:05:20] Ghost but I'm acting like it when day
[1:05:24] which day I don't know but I'm not who I
[1:05:27] was the things that I found too hard to
[1:05:29] do I do the things I found too
[1:05:33] challenging I I just accept them that's
[1:05:35] right but God always has
[1:05:38] more God always has more for you to come
[1:05:42] to because there is a way and but the M
[1:05:44] says it is a Razor's
[1:05:46] Edge can anybody hear walk on the edge
[1:05:49] of a
[1:05:50] razor I can't neither can us we neither
[1:05:53] can we walk on water
[1:05:56] unless God calls us from the boat yes
[1:05:59] sir Peter called out says God I desire
[1:06:01] you he says come to me you called out
[1:06:05] how did you call out because you already
[1:06:06] recognized Peter already recognized
[1:06:08] Jesus for who he was so he called out to
[1:06:11] him go God Gave You revelation of who he
[1:06:13] was before the foundation of the world
[1:06:14] and when you saw him on the water you
[1:06:16] said called out to him and said God I
[1:06:18] want to come to you and he said come and
[1:06:20] now you walked in the impossible that's
[1:06:22] right walking according to the word of
[1:06:25] this hour is
[1:06:26] impossible but not with God you will the
[1:06:30] most miserable place a Christian can be
[1:06:32] is trying to serve God outside of Christ
[1:06:35] that's right trying to line up to a
[1:06:37] church order a church doctrine a church
[1:06:40] system outside of Christ it's a
[1:06:43] miserable
[1:06:45] existence but you get
[1:06:47] Christ you find yourself walking in the
[1:06:50] way of the divinely revealed mystery
[1:06:53] truths they're not mystery is
[1:06:56] anymore they're attributes of Christ and
[1:07:00] they're manifesting themselves in you
[1:07:03] you see it's not just it's not just a
[1:07:05] dress and it's not just a uh the Bible
[1:07:09] not just listening to
[1:07:10] tapes it's
[1:07:12] Perfection I I've only heard P bits and
[1:07:15] pieces I haven't seen Wednesday nights
[1:07:17] yet but 3% ain't good
[1:07:21] enough it's Perfection you say I want to
[1:07:24] I I want my life to to to resonate
[1:07:27] Christ Perfection says well it's
[1:07:30] impossible to be perfect no it's not
[1:07:33] it's impossible with with man it's
[1:07:35] impossible with the flesh but with
[1:07:37] Christ
[1:07:38] himself you see we we we there's a
[1:07:41] higher
[1:07:42] calling and and it's and and it starts
[1:07:45] to get you know you get down to to
[1:07:46] building a statue
[1:07:48] and never done
[1:07:50] it but I've heard you take big chunks
[1:07:54] off first yeah big pieces off of this
[1:07:59] big block of marble but then then you're
[1:08:02] you're with a small chisel putting the
[1:08:04] eyes in little pieces maybe just even
[1:08:07] dust as you as you grind you know
[1:08:09] nowadays we have Sanders and stuff like
[1:08:11] that and as you're sanding this
[1:08:14] out just dust is coming off not even
[1:08:17] chunks dust but unless that's sanded it
[1:08:21] doesn't look right that's
[1:08:23] right you get down you know i' I've seen
[1:08:26] it where you do like a statue of a bear
[1:08:28] saying it's epoxy and wood mixed epoxy
[1:08:31] has to be sanded down to like 600 grit
[1:08:35] or further than that and it takes hours
[1:08:38] upon hours to get the shine to come in
[1:08:42] and then a a final coat has to be wiped
[1:08:45] over it an oil has to be wiped over it
[1:08:49] you see God is down I believe with all
[1:08:51] my heart God is down to the place with
[1:08:53] the bride he's
[1:08:56] sanding and we're all in different
[1:08:58] places in our life but we we we can't
[1:09:00] settle for the
[1:09:02] highway we've got to attain to the way
[1:09:05] the the Perfection of God the the the
[1:09:08] the higher calling what in your life can
[1:09:09] you lay aside what what in your life and
[1:09:12] I'm talking down to the little things
[1:09:14] that's right yes Pride whether Ben seil
[1:09:19] here no I don't know I watch that sermon
[1:09:21] and God bless you for preaching that
[1:09:23] brother amen but it's that kind of stuff
[1:09:27] it's not brother Ben it's the word of
[1:09:28] God saying look you got to stop worrying
[1:09:30] about oh well I don't do the big stuff
[1:09:33] get down to the nitty-gritty get down to
[1:09:36] the way because the way is a Razor's
[1:09:39] Edge so what do you have to do somebody
[1:09:42] come to me the other day says brother I
[1:09:44] thought I had dealt with the
[1:09:46] bitterness of this with this person but
[1:09:50] something will come up a reminder of
[1:09:52] something will happen and I'll feel that
[1:09:54] bitterness raise back
[1:09:56] up and uh brother Chad well knows
[1:10:00] sometimes you don't have any words you
[1:10:03] go to
[1:10:04] God and the Lord began to speak and
[1:10:08] and just in my own in my own heart I was
[1:10:12] thinking man this is wow Lord this I
[1:10:15] never saw it in your word this
[1:10:16] way but I I I
[1:10:19] said don't try to attack bitterness
[1:10:23] don't don't try to go after bitterness
[1:10:24] and and remove bitterness said
[1:10:27] bitterness is is really just iniquity
[1:10:29] you know you shouldn't be bitter but you
[1:10:33] are and I said all you need is more
[1:10:38] word I said because the more word you
[1:10:40] pour into your
[1:10:42] vessel the more the iniquity flows
[1:10:45] out and I said and how you know because
[1:10:48] I know this is this is a hard part
[1:10:50] sometimes especially with young people
[1:10:51] how do you know that you've been
[1:10:53] delivered how do you know that that that
[1:10:55] God has given you power over the flesh
[1:10:58] it's when that thing Rises up and you're
[1:11:00] tempted but the Holy Spirit comes right
[1:11:02] behind and grabs a hold of that and puts
[1:11:04] it back into subjection the Temptation
[1:11:07] is not the
[1:11:09] desire it's God it's the devil tempting
[1:11:11] you and the Temptation doesn't mean your
[1:11:13] heart hasn't changed you just say God I
[1:11:16] need you and God comes with the Holy
[1:11:17] Spirit comes and takes a hold of that
[1:11:19] because you've given it to him already
[1:11:21] you've given it into his
[1:11:24] hands so the more that we take the word
[1:11:27] the less of us there is the less
[1:11:29] bitterness there is the less Pride there
[1:11:31] is the less reasoning there is and the
[1:11:34] more surrender we have to God the more
[1:11:39] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[1:11:41] become you and
[1:11:43] flesh Christ is a mystery of God
[1:11:46] revealed then come back in the last days
[1:11:48] and picked up all these Mysteries and
[1:11:50] clearly explain it reveal
[1:11:54] it why it's all the last days when this
[1:11:58] great mystery that God had in his heart
[1:11:59] is being revealed do you get it if you
[1:12:03] fail come back to this tape again don't
[1:12:05] know how much longer I'll be with you
[1:12:07] remember this is the truth of thus
[1:12:09] sayith the lord it's the truth it's the
[1:12:10] scripture like the seven Mysteries of
[1:12:12] the seven last seals the mysteries of
[1:12:14] them the seals has done been broken
[1:12:16] every age had come down and there they
[1:12:18] left a lot of scattering and God not
[1:12:21] willing that it should be scattered he
[1:12:22] comes back and picks up those things
[1:12:24] those doctrines they started and brought
[1:12:26] it on out and revealed the whole thing
[1:12:29] same thing he's doing now in revealing
[1:12:31] the mystery of Christ how he was God's
[1:12:34] three-fold purpose for the church now
[1:12:37] all that to get down to this letting
[1:12:40] letting them out revealing
[1:12:42] so the breaking of the bread again we
[1:12:46] walked on the road we walked on the road
[1:12:49] but then there came time for communion
[1:12:51] with Christ
[1:12:56] came time to communion with Christ and
[1:12:58] when were our eyes when were our eyes
[1:12:59] open when he broke the bread and then
[1:13:02] our hearts went back to what we had
[1:13:05] heard along the way says didn't our
[1:13:08] hearts burn within us didn't we know
[1:13:11] this was the truth but then God opened
[1:13:12] her eyes and how do we always say it it
[1:13:16] became a brand new
[1:13:18] book When God reveals something to you I
[1:13:21] I look at it this way at least for me
[1:13:23] personally God reveals something to me
[1:13:25] it's like I have a nude Looking Glass
[1:13:27] and I go back and I look through every
[1:13:29] scripture again because you see it
[1:13:30] different than you did before because
[1:13:32] you understand more of who Christ
[1:13:37] is so this this this this this communion
[1:13:40] this breaking of the bread that is the
[1:13:42] sign of the
[1:13:43] way the two on the road to emus what was
[1:13:46] the sign that they were on the way with
[1:13:48] Christ he broke the bread communion with
[1:13:51] Christ the breaking a revealing of
[1:13:53] Christ and it's necessary
[1:13:55] it's necessary for the bride to make
[1:13:58] that transition for us to make the
[1:14:00] transition in our personal lives we must
[1:14:02] come to that communion with Christ but
[1:14:05] you see we have to have the backstory we
[1:14:08] have to have the ministry along the way
[1:14:11] you're Faithfully taught here you take
[1:14:13] it home with
[1:14:15] you meditate on it until it becomes a
[1:14:18] broken bread to
[1:14:19] you the word is not it is not just your
[1:14:22] responsibility to sit here and hear the
[1:14:24] word preached there is more to it God
[1:14:27] wants you to go home and say what was it
[1:14:28] that I heard today God break the bread
[1:14:30] to me help me to have communion with you
[1:14:32] because oh brother and sister as you
[1:14:34] well know when you have communion with
[1:14:36] Christ you are never the
[1:14:38] same and sometimes you and and and
[1:14:41] anytime God has more of himself to
[1:14:42] impart to you you need that closeness
[1:14:44] with him again amen and I feel like
[1:14:47] every day there's more and more and more
[1:14:49] where you just want to slip away and
[1:14:51] talk to him and spend time with him cuz
[1:14:53] you say God I am a man I am dumb I don't
[1:14:57] know anything I can't speak when I say
[1:14:58] dumb Ian can't speak I I don't have I I
[1:15:01] have nothing of myself I have nothing of
[1:15:04] myself to give but God I know if I can
[1:15:07] get you you make all the difference in
[1:15:10] the world you will make the difference
[1:15:11] in this situation and he'll and and and
[1:15:14] God's in the business of revealing
[1:15:15] Mysteries amen say what's the mystery of
[1:15:18] this situation Lord I don't understand
[1:15:19] it and God will reveal it directly to
[1:15:21] you that's right Lord what's a what's a
[1:15:23] mystery I see this in your word and
[1:15:25] brother Chad has been preaching it and
[1:15:26] and the brothers have been ministering
[1:15:28] on it and I've heard it over and over
[1:15:29] again my whole life and I I hear Brother
[1:15:31] brandom talking about it but I'm missing
[1:15:33] something God reveal this this to me
[1:15:35] open it up to me and once he does guess
[1:15:38] what you will never be able to not see
[1:15:40] that and then he says wait there's
[1:15:45] more wait there's
[1:15:48] more so this way calls You Higher One
[1:15:52] Last One Last Point here as we close
[1:15:56] go tell my my
[1:16:02] disciples if there ever was a time and
[1:16:04] this brings us right back down to our
[1:16:06] point about the separation if there ever
[1:16:08] was a time that the Church of Christ
[1:16:10] needs its eyes opened it's today some
[1:16:14] more breaking bread their eyes were open
[1:16:16] and they recognized that it was him oh
[1:16:20] friend has he ever opened your eyes that
[1:16:22] way has he ever blessed you in such a
[1:16:24] way
[1:16:25] has he ever broke you apart from the
[1:16:27] things of the world because we are to be
[1:16:30] a type of Christ so we must be
[1:16:34] broken we must be
[1:16:37] broken go go back and listen to
[1:16:40] Masterpiece he has ever broke you apart
[1:16:42] from the things of the world separated
[1:16:44] you a breaking and an opening time
[1:16:48] that's what the church needs today is a
[1:16:49] breaking and an opening time you see it
[1:16:52] was twofold the breaking of the bread
[1:16:54] and and the opening of their eyes if you
[1:16:57] go back and you and you listen to
[1:16:59] brother Bram the angel begins to tell
[1:17:00] him before The Reeling of the seals you
[1:17:02] need to be more
[1:17:04] sincere you see the seals and the
[1:17:06] opening of the word and those final
[1:17:08] years of his ministry that was the
[1:17:10] transition that was the word for the
[1:17:12] transition to move the bride from the
[1:17:14] church that's right that's why it had to
[1:17:16] be recorded because we needed it this
[1:17:18] day that that transition in order to
[1:17:21] reach that he's the wave sheath right
[1:17:24] he's the one there first if you will so
[1:17:27] he what is whatever he needed to do be
[1:17:30] more sincere than you must as well God
[1:17:33] is calling us to be more sincere to let
[1:17:36] go of the apathy of the age that we live
[1:17:38] in I mean everywhere you look it's
[1:17:40] laziness just just laziness unconcerned
[1:17:43] brother preach that message
[1:17:44] unconcerned you must be convinced and
[1:17:47] then concerned because something inside
[1:17:48] of you says this is really really really
[1:17:50] really important right I I this is very
[1:17:53] important the angel tell tells him
[1:17:55] you've got to be more sincere you're
[1:17:57] talking about the prophet amen what a
[1:18:00] position we have to attain to and I
[1:18:02] don't say that to discourage you I say
[1:18:04] that to encourage you to inspire you if
[1:18:06] you will just be more sincere that thing
[1:18:08] in your life that you want to take care
[1:18:10] of that that even your church friends
[1:18:12] say what's the big deal with that but
[1:18:14] God's calling you to let it go he's
[1:18:17] calling you higher because there's a
[1:18:19] highway and there's a way there's a way
[1:18:22] and that way leadth unto
[1:18:26] somebody say it unto
[1:18:28] life there is a way and that way leadth
[1:18:31] unto life he is the way the truth and
[1:18:34] the life and the truth shall set you
[1:18:37] free amen that is our desire this
[1:18:40] morning let's bow our
[1:18:48] heads Lord Jesus

[1:19:17] as we face this this higher calling that
[1:19:20] you've put in our lives Lord
[1:19:23] Jesus that that's where the battle
[1:19:25] really comes down that's where we really
[1:19:28] must stand with the belt of Truth The
[1:19:32] Shield of
[1:19:33] Faith the sword of the word of God we
[1:19:37] must stand to fight and when the Devil
[1:19:40] comes with different tactics and says
[1:19:42] well they don't find it concerning over
[1:19:44] there so why are you worrying about it
[1:19:47] you're you're becoming too legalistic
[1:19:50] you're becoming too concerned than that
[1:19:53] father in those moments we can
[1:19:55] discern that that's the enemy
[1:19:58] speaking we can discern that that's the
[1:20:01] discouragement speaking but Lord we ask
[1:20:03] that you'd walk with us along the way
[1:20:06] Lord that you would open yourself up to
[1:20:07] us Lord Jesus in these moments father
[1:20:10] where we begin to see a higher calling
[1:20:12] in your word and we desire to attain to
[1:20:15] that Lord help us father to reach for
[1:20:17] that to not be dis pers uh dissuaded on
[1:20:20] either side Lord to not be distracted
[1:20:23] Lord Jesus but to with vengeance with
[1:20:25] with passion with inspiration with with
[1:20:28] with with just a with just so much
[1:20:30] concern and sincerity reach for that and
[1:20:33] say God if this really is you and more

[1:20:58] to me I've heard the word Lord the word
[1:21:01] has been spoken father it's here and

[1:24:51] believe you are too it's so encouraging
[1:24:53] to know know that we didn't get on this
[1:24:56] way by ourselves but God placed
[1:24:58] something in us that would draw us amen
[1:25:00] that he could draw amen because he can
[1:25:02] draw he can pull but if there's nothing
[1:25:04] there to respond to the pull we'll never
[1:25:06] get on the way but God had something he
[1:25:08] placed with inside of us that he could
[1:25:10] draw by his word to pull us on the way
[1:25:14] so thankful for that and now that I know
[1:25:17] God's brought me he's he's brought me to
[1:25:19] the way I want to head down that way and

[1:25:23] distracted by by by what the brother was
[1:25:25] saying everything to the right or to the
[1:25:27] left and bouncing back and forth but oh
[1:25:29] God help me to stay focused you brought
[1:25:31] me here for a
[1:25:33] reason you want to bring me there's a
[1:25:37] destination friends and we know
[1:25:39] according to the word we have
[1:25:41] destination in Millennium we have a
[1:25:42] destination amen uh in new heavens and
[1:25:45] new earth but I believe in this
[1:25:46] manifestation we have a destination and
[1:25:49] the destination is to reflect his very
[1:25:51] image on Earth I believe it's his goal
[1:25:53] for the end time bride that we're here
[1:25:55] to be him on this Earth amen and he's
[1:25:58] brought us on the way to move us down to
[1:26:00] hit that
[1:26:02] destination I've been encouraged to be
[1:26:04] more focused to be more sincere to ask
[1:26:08] God to to Center my focus and stay
[1:26:11] focused on him and head down this way
[1:26:15] it's a narrow way we would have missed
[1:26:19] if we weren't predestinated to get on it
[1:26:21] it's a hard way we would have quit if he
[1:26:23] hadn't predestinate we'd have never
[1:26:25] found it we' never got on it we would
[1:26:27] have we would have been on the highway
[1:26:29] thinking we were on the way but God
[1:26:31] brought us from the highway to the
[1:26:33] way that's his grace in our
[1:26:36] lives I just want to stay focused I'm
[1:26:41] encouraged that there's a purpose in it
[1:26:43] all and we know the purpose but oh
[1:26:47] there's a million
[1:26:48] distractions but I don't want to be
[1:26:50] distracted by
[1:26:52] distractions these breaking the bread
[1:26:54] and opening more of himself to me I want
[1:26:56] to feed on it to have strength to move
[1:26:59] down this way what a good lesson
[1:27:03] amen amen let's just bow our heads and
[1:27:06] thank him for the
[1:27:08] word de Heavenly Father we thank you God
[1:27:11] for the word that you brought to us God
[1:27:14] how you've encouraged us Lord and in
[1:27:17] many ways you've corrected us Lord to
[1:27:20] get our attention back on you once
[1:27:22] again God we realize the world is
[1:27:25] riddled with all kinds of distractions
[1:27:28] and flashy things confusing
[1:27:32] things God your children have suffered
[1:27:34] with it Lord for thousands of
[1:27:37] years but God you have brought us by
[1:27:40] your own Grace to this Narrow
[1:27:44] Path and God you've given us a word like
[1:27:47] has never touched this Earth
[1:27:50] before God you've also used that word to
[1:27:53] place in this generation an
[1:27:56] isav Lord I pray that we would receive
[1:27:58] the isav and you'd give us Clear Vision
[1:28:02] by this end time message and God that we
[1:28:05] can walk down this way that we can move
[1:28:07] Lord down the road you have for us this
[1:28:10] specific way this Narrow Path this
[1:28:12] harder way Lord that we can yield and
[1:28:15] surrender to that that we can do it of
[1:28:17] our own choosing Lord that we can move
[1:28:20] Lord and make progress Lord in what
[1:28:23] you're calling us to to which our
[1:28:25] brother Lord is so so clearly spelled
