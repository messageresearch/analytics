[5:35] bibles and look at first corinthians
[5:37] chapter 11. say i appreciate the
[5:40] atmosphere this evening
[5:42] thank god for a place to come and
[5:43] worship
[5:45] with like-minded believers and brothers
[5:47] and sisters in christ
[5:49] to share our little licks of fire amen
[5:53] first corinthians chapter 11. i want to
[5:56] read just one
[5:57] verse here first corinthians 11 verse 1
[6:01] be followers of me even as i also
[6:05] am of christ let's bow our heads and
[6:08] pray
[6:08] lord jesus we ask that you would lord
[6:11] bless the reading of your word
[6:13] i pray god you would take control of
[6:15] this vessel for your glory
[6:17] may you speak your words of eternal life
[6:19] lord and may we hear it
[6:20] and receive it lord may you grant us
[6:23] lord the spirit of revelation that we
[6:24] might catch
[6:25] what you're trying to speak to us in
[6:27] this day and that that word will be more
[6:30] than word but it'll become a
[6:31] manifestation lord
[6:33] to become a living word living out
[6:34] through our flesh by your spirit
[6:37] god have your way with us move upon us
[6:39] and have preeminence in jesus christ's
[6:41] name we pray
[6:42] amen you can all be seated
[6:46] amen i want to um just speak for a
[6:49] moment on
[6:50] on this says be followers of me even as
[6:53] i
[6:54] also am of christ and i want to refer
[6:57] back to uh something that took place
[6:59] on sunday this past sunday i made a
[7:02] statement
[7:03] and as soon as i made the statement
[7:05] something checked me the spirit checked
[7:06] me
[7:07] not something it was the spirit of god
[7:08] checked me hard and i began to repent
[7:10] and you guys might know that and caught
[7:12] that
[7:12] i've had a few people ask me what did
[7:14] you even say i missed it amen and
[7:16] and it wasn't it wasn't that i was
[7:19] saying wrong or preaching wrong doctrine
[7:21] but
[7:22] the way i said it god didn't like he
[7:24] wasn't pleased with that
[7:25] and and so i wanted to address that and
[7:27] apologize for that but
[7:29] uh first we you know we were talking
[7:31] about the denominational attitude and
[7:33] the approach to the word and
[7:35] and tr keeping god back 2 000 years ago
[7:38] and not bringing present tense and
[7:39] that's the great fallacy of
[7:41] denominationalism
[7:43] but when i made the statement and i
[7:44] don't even remember i didn't go back and
[7:46] check
[7:46] word for word what i said but it was on
[7:48] this wise that
[7:50] uh preaching all you have to do is
[7:52] believe jesus christ died on calvary
[7:54] 2000 years ago and that's it
[7:56] and i said something like dead dung i
[7:58] called that that nung and all the sudden
[8:00] something in me just
[8:02] grabbed my heart and stopped me in my
[8:05] tracks
[8:06] because there's no believing no part of
[8:09] the word is wrong
[8:11] there's nothing that you can believe out
[8:12] of the word that is wrong or would be
[8:15] evil
[8:16] or can or any way make you wrong or make
[8:18] you evil
[8:19] amen believing any part of the scripture
[8:22] is not wrong it's clean
[8:25] believing in calvary is clean and pure
[8:27] and the foundation for our belief
[8:29] because there's the price of our
[8:30] redemption
[8:31] was paid amen so it wasn't so much that
[8:34] my point was wrong the point was not
[8:36] wrong the doctrine that was being taught
[8:37] was not wrong
[8:38] but but brother brahm says sometimes you
[8:40] have to drive a nail to it clenches
[8:43] but sometimes you drive a nail too hard
[8:45] and too fast
[8:46] and then you're working fast to try to
[8:48] dig it up but it's already dug
[8:50] down amen so more than anything it was
[8:53] that what god checked me on was the
[8:54] approach
[8:55] it was too strong of a statement it was
[8:57] too firm and
[8:59] in it and and i had gotten in the way
[9:01] and god checked me and after that i had
[9:03] a little bit of difficulty getting my
[9:04] footing because i had lost confidence
[9:07] amen because you know i got in the flesh
[9:10] but
[9:10] praise god he helped us anyways the word
[9:12] was good and the word was true
[9:14] and i just wanted to bring that to your
[9:15] attention because you know it
[9:17] matters what we say and what we do
[9:20] matters
[9:20] and you can have the right word preached
[9:22] the wrong way
[9:23] and bring the wrong spirit and that's
[9:26] not what we want amen
[9:28] we want the right word with the right
[9:29] spirit to bring the right response and
[9:31] the right attitude
[9:32] we can carry the word with a wrong
[9:34] attitude and make it wrong
[9:37] brother said in doors and doors from
[9:39] 1965 he said you go into a church and
[9:41] watch the pastor
[9:43] if he's real wild and carries on the
[9:45] congregation will be the same see
[9:47] they take the spirit of one another
[9:48] instead of the holy spirit
[9:51] and that's the thing we have to guard
[9:52] against i have to guard against it you
[9:54] have to guard against
[9:55] it we have to be very on guard amen and
[9:57] i thank god
[9:59] i thank god that he checked us so fast
[10:01] on that
[10:02] and that we had an opportunity to say
[10:04] something right away that wasn't right
[10:05] because we don't want to sow the wrong
[10:07] attitude in the wrong spirit
[10:09] amen because we have to recognize amen
[10:13] recognize the word for what it is and
[10:15] make sure that we don't take our own
[10:17] approach
[10:18] amen so we have to be careful that what
[10:20] we're presenting to the people is the
[10:21] holy ghost
[10:22] and what we're receiving is the holy
[10:24] ghost not the spirit of a man
[10:26] let's turn to mark chapter nine i'm
[10:29] gonna just talk about this for a minute
[10:30] and then get into what i what what god
[10:32] has laid on my heart
[10:34] mark chapter 9.
[10:48] mark chapter 9 verse 38 and john
[10:51] answered him saying master
[10:53] we saw one casting out devils in thy
[10:55] name and he followeth not us
[10:57] and we forbade him because he followeth
[10:59] not us
[11:01] but jesus said forbid him not for there
[11:03] is no man which shall do a miracle in my
[11:05] name
[11:06] that can lightly speak evil of me for he
[11:08] that is not against
[11:09] us is on our part so here
[11:12] you know john is is getting the wrong
[11:15] idea he's following christ and
[11:19] and he's he's in the inner circles close
[11:21] to christ and
[11:22] now somebody else is taking the name of
[11:24] christ and and
[11:26] they're doing a work and he forbids them
[11:28] because they were not following us
[11:30] they're not part of our group so we
[11:31] forbid them
[11:32] and jesus said don't forbid them if
[11:34] they're not against us they're on our
[11:35] part amen
[11:36] don't just because they're not with us
[11:37] don't assume they're they're on the
[11:39] other side amen
[11:40] and so jesus uh in this he really paints
[11:44] the right approach and the right
[11:45] attitude for us john had the wrong
[11:47] attitude
[11:47] jesus had the right attitude of course
[11:50] and brother bam says in 1964 god's word
[11:52] calls for a total separation from
[11:54] unbelief
[11:55] said all these believers as we could go
[11:57] on for hours all these are like a bunch
[12:00] of change out of your pocket
[12:01] in god's hands you pull out a bunch of
[12:03] change there's pennies nickels dimes
[12:05] quarters half dollars
[12:06] dollar all in coins now that's what the
[12:10] world
[12:10] the world is in god's hand look at this
[12:13] that's what the world is in god's hand
[12:16] there are some people that just can have
[12:18] a pennies worth of it
[12:19] and god can only use them in a penny way
[12:22] that's all they can buy
[12:23] don't reject them if they can't believe
[12:26] the real truth don't turn them down
[12:28] don't kick them out and say they're not
[12:30] in it because god uses pennies sometimes
[12:34] this is really important what we want to
[12:36] do is we want to back
[12:37] up on what we drove too hard and
[12:39] actually bring the right attitude in the
[12:41] right approach
[12:42] lot was just a penny abraham was a
[12:44] silver dollar so it taken a hundred lots
[12:47] to make an abraham
[12:48] and so will it take a hundred carnal
[12:50] believers will never stand in the
[12:52] presence of a genuine christian
[12:54] that's separated from the carnal things
[12:55] of the world living in christ jesus
[12:57] where the word can flow through him
[13:00] he can only take a penny's worth that's
[13:02] all he's got so you see people that say
[13:04] i don't believe in healing i don't
[13:05] believe in these things just
[13:06] know it's a penny but just let let him
[13:09] alone see just a penny's worth
[13:10] and so that's all he can buy don't stop
[13:12] him just let him alone remember
[13:14] that's just all the farther he can go
[13:18] brother rem says in 1960 the message as
[13:21] i was with moses so i will be with thee
[13:23] or how can you try to make all the
[13:25] lutheran see it all the baptists see it
[13:27] all the presbyterians and nazarenes and
[13:29] pilgrim holiness
[13:30] don't condemn them that's all they know
[13:32] that's all that's in them
[13:34] brother said don't condemn them that's
[13:37] all they know
[13:38] if his opinion's worth leave them alone
[13:39] amen it doesn't make them bride
[13:41] you can't change somebody's position in
[13:44] predestination and election
[13:46] they meant so by a pervasive persuasive
[13:49] speech or
[13:50] by a bold rejection you can't change
[13:52] anything
[13:53] so if they cannot receive the word you
[13:55] might as well just leave them alone
[13:56] and be whatever god ordained for them to
[13:59] be
[14:00] see the problem is not being able to see
[14:02] the word there's no problem in that
[14:05] the problem is rejecting the word when
[14:07] it's presented to you and calling it
[14:09] something evil that jesus didn't go
[14:13] around
[14:14] all of israel condemning every person he
[14:16] come in contact with
[14:17] but who did he call children of the
[14:18] devil those that stood and called him
[14:20] beelzebub
[14:22] they looked at the word made flesh and
[14:23] they rejected him called it evil names
[14:25] and they sought to destroy it and stop
[14:26] it
[14:27] amen those were the ones that were
[14:28] children of the devil
[14:31] amen so we've got to make sure that
[14:33] everybody who can't see the message
[14:35] doesn't become children of the devil
[14:38] that god can have a purpose even for
[14:41] that amen because we realize
[14:43] when we get over to new heavens and new
[14:44] earth amen when we dwell in the city
[14:46] the city dwellers are the elect
[14:48] predestinated chosen amen
[14:50] living in the city and only they can
[14:52] live there but the rest of the world is
[14:54] inhabited by
[14:55] millions billions i don't know how many
[14:57] people and those people
[14:58] amen what they're doing over in the in
[15:01] eternity in new heavens and new earth
[15:03] is they're serving and working for the
[15:05] city they're bringing their tithe and
[15:07] offering into the city
[15:08] bringing their stores and their foods
[15:10] and their grains into the city
[15:12] and in exchange for their service to the
[15:14] bride
[15:15] and the king amen they get a leaf off
[15:17] the tree of life for peace
[15:19] perpetual peace perpetual life because
[15:22] amen they they were a pennies worth on
[15:24] earth to serve
[15:25] something in god's kingdom to do
[15:27] something to create a christian economy
[15:30] maybe
[15:30] maybe their only portion is the decreed
[15:32] a christian economy amen that helps
[15:34] keeps the doors of this church open just
[15:36] a little bit longer in this nation
[15:38] and they couldn't receive the word they
[15:39] couldn't do anything else but they could
[15:41] they could do
[15:42] something amen to help the bride in some
[15:44] way even indirectly
[15:47] the further the calls of christ amen so
[15:49] don't frustrate
[15:50] individuals like that don't call them
[15:52] names amen amen we
[15:54] shouldn't amen we shouldn't evil speak
[15:56] we should just recognize
[15:57] if they can't receive it they can't
[15:58] receive it the problem
[16:00] is open rejection the problem is
[16:04] turning down christ not saying i don't
[16:06] see it
[16:07] i don't understand i can't see that it
[16:09] doesn't make sense to me
[16:11] amen that's fine leave that alone but
[16:13] the
[16:14] evil is in the open rejection the
[16:16] antichrist spirit that would fight
[16:17] against
[16:18] truth or call it blasphemy or false
[16:20] doctrine or
[16:21] false prophet so we want to have the
[16:24] right attitude and the right approach
[16:26] amen because there's rewards coming for
[16:28] some of those individuals who could only
[16:29] to put hold a portion of the word
[16:32] there's still a reward coming to them at
[16:34] the great white throne judgment
[16:36] so we don't want to go too far off the
[16:38] right
[16:39] too far off the left so the point that
[16:42] we were making was true the point that i
[16:44] was driving was true
[16:45] amen but you can't just hold the one
[16:48] portion of the word
[16:49] and believe that that one portion of the
[16:50] word will get you through if you're
[16:51] rejecting this other portion of the word
[16:53] because that portion of the word is
[16:54] christ and this portion of the word is
[16:56] christ and if you reject christ you
[16:57] reject christ
[16:59] the point is still true but somebody who
[17:01] has no capacity to see
[17:03] no way no ability to catch the word
[17:06] because there's nothing in them to catch
[17:07] the word
[17:08] amen god is going to judge them based
[17:11] off what they did with the light that
[17:13] they had
[17:15] there's only this much light will george
[17:17] judge him according to that
[17:18] but remember god's great economy he's
[17:20] doing something
[17:21] and everything he's doing is working
[17:24] towards the benefit of the elect
[17:25] even indirectly praise god
[17:29] maybe there has to be a whole lot of
[17:31] pennies in the nation
[17:33] so there's freedom of religion so we can
[17:34] keep printing books and passing them out
[17:36] and maybe that's the only thing they're
[17:38] there to do
[17:40] go to church stand for fight for rights
[17:43] keep keep things going just so we can
[17:45] find that last predestinated seed
[17:48] and so praise god may god give him a
[17:51] reward for that
[17:52] because we benefited from that and if
[17:54] you're the last one to come in
[17:56] you'll thank god for every baptist that
[17:58] petitioned the government
[18:00] to keep freedom of religion keep the
[18:02] doors open because they were doing
[18:03] that they were doing what they could
[18:05] with what they had and they were serving
[18:07] god's economy in some way
[18:09] and guess what when when we in the in
[18:12] the city as city dwellers amen the bride
[18:14] of jesus christ is those that are
[18:16] outside the city come in
[18:17] they're going to be our friends and our
[18:19] associates and it's not going to be like
[18:20] oh here comes those people coming into
[18:22] the gay
[18:23] i wish the king would shut the gate
[18:26] when they walk in it's going to be ah oh
[18:28] how are you doing how are things going
[18:32] there's going to be a love there's going
[18:33] to be a respect there's going to be an
[18:35] appreciation
[18:36] it's not going to be first class second
[18:38] class it's going to be the bride
[18:39] amen and the king the predestinated
[18:42] chosen elect of god
[18:43] and then all outside and there's going
[18:45] to be a great fellowship and a
[18:47] tremendous love and a tremendous joy
[18:50] amen praise god
[18:54] brother baby said don't condemn them
[18:56] that's all i know
[18:57] that's all that's in them but to you who
[19:00] believe
[19:00] to you who know to you that's got
[19:02] something in you that's calling to the
[19:04] deep
[19:05] if all the deep you've got's been
[19:06] satisfied then stay where you are
[19:09] but for me in my house for me there's
[19:11] something more that
[19:12] than what i what he sees there's a land
[19:14] beyond the river somewhere there's still
[19:16] a deep calling to the deep
[19:17] i cannot be satisfied with theology i
[19:20] cannot be satisfied with good a good
[19:21] church
[19:22] i cannot be satisfied with good a good
[19:24] campaign i cannot be satisfied with a
[19:26] little healing service
[19:28] there's something beyond that that's
[19:30] calling
[19:32] so just let them alone go on through
[19:34] don't argue with them
[19:35] but we're passing to another land they
[19:38] wasn't ordained to go with you
[19:41] but i was ordained to go on amen
[19:44] amen and if you can just fly a little
[19:46] higher and see things for what they are
[19:48] it takes all the argument and all the
[19:50] bickering and all the
[19:52] fighting out of it amen you see somebody
[19:54] amen they just have no capacity to
[19:57] receive the message no capacity in them
[19:59] to see it
[20:00] but they live true to what they see they
[20:02] honor and respect they speak no evil of
[20:04] the bride they speak no evil of the word
[20:06] of the revelation
[20:07] amen you can just say go on friend i'll
[20:09] see you on the other side
[20:12] because they may be one who receives
[20:14] entrance into eternal life
[20:15] for just not condemning not rejecting
[20:18] not disrespecting
[20:19] the bride but showing respect and love
[20:21] and holding their portion
[20:22] and being a penny
[20:25] so may we see many of those
[20:29] on the other side remember
[20:33] abraham was friends with abimelech
[20:36] that's right and bemalek wasn't a real
[20:38] israelite david was friends with hiram
[20:41] of tyre they were good friends and he
[20:43] wasn't an israelite
[20:44] he wasn't part of the chosen nation and
[20:46] solomon continued that friendship
[20:48] amen that's all through the bible
[20:50] friends
[20:51] so may god bless all those that are
[20:54] around us
[20:56] amen and may we have the right approach
[20:59] and the right attitude and be
[21:01] christ-like in all things
[21:03] and if we ever step to the right or left
[21:04] may god's hand of correction come down
[21:06] fast
[21:07] even if it's in the middle of a sentence
[21:09] in the middle of preaching in the pulpit
[21:11] i'm still thankful that god corrects his
[21:13] children
[21:14] and keeps us straight amen if you could
[21:17] turn with me to romans i want to go into
[21:18] another thought
[21:20] there were some things that i didn't
[21:21] finish on sunday
[21:23] because my cage was rattled
[21:26] and so i'd like to share some of those
[21:28] thoughts i'd like to take a
[21:30] text of eve restored eve restored and
[21:33] talk about that today
[21:34] and go to romans chapter 8. we've been
[21:36] reading this scripture quite a lot
[21:37] lately
[21:38] romans 8 and verse 29 some of the the
[21:42] beauty and joy of being able to preach
[21:44] sunday and wednesday and sunday and
[21:46] wednesday
[21:47] is when you when you get on something
[21:48] you can just stay on it amen
[21:50] and you keep thinking you're going to
[21:51] move off and you just don't move off and
[21:53] god
[21:54] and god amen keeps giving more out of
[21:57] the same scriptures
[21:59] romans 8 and 29 for whom he did for know
[22:02] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[22:04] to the image of his son
[22:06] that he might be the firstborn among
[22:07] many brethren
[22:09] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[22:11] he also called
[22:12] and whom he called them he also
[22:14] justified and whom he justified
[22:16] then he also glorified
[22:20] if you find yourself in that scripture
[22:22] then don't worry you're already
[22:23] glorified
[22:25] we're traveling through amen we're
[22:26] traveling through the manifestation in
[22:28] this dimension
[22:29] in flesh we're doing the part that he's
[22:31] called us to do to display the portion
[22:32] of the word for our day
[22:34] but in the great plan of god in god's
[22:36] mind he sees it finished he sees
[22:38] us finished he sees the whole works done
[22:40] from the beginning
[22:41] amen and he knows amen that we are
[22:43] already glorified in his mind
[22:45] there is no chance of us not making it
[22:50] if that doesn't bring peace to our
[22:51] hearts there's nothing that's going to
[22:52] bring peace to our hearts
[22:53] amen and so many times there's so much
[22:55] pressure to perform and i got to be the
[22:57] bride and i got to do these things
[22:59] amen and then under that pressure every
[23:01] time we fail
[23:02] amen we go back to zero and say well
[23:04] maybe i'm not and i'm not sure
[23:05] amen friends the god has sent a message
[23:08] to break us
[23:09] out of that pentecostal idea amen the
[23:11] armenianism amen that was rampant in the
[23:14] previous age
[23:16] he come to break us out of that because
[23:18] if if god
[23:19] if you were ever chosen of god and for
[23:21] ordained amen you were always
[23:23] chosen and foreordained and so the
[23:26] security that that brings
[23:28] gives a release amen not a pressure
[23:31] amen not a pressure to be something but
[23:34] a release to be what's inside
[23:37] it's not an outside pressure it's not a
[23:39] confirmation
[23:40] amen that's pushing us into something
[23:43] but it's actually a revelation that
[23:45] takes
[23:45] all the bonds off all the chains all the
[23:48] limitations that limit
[23:50] us in the flesh removes that so that we
[23:52] have the freedom to be what's on the
[23:54] inside
[23:55] it's the opposite and brother bam said
[23:57] in spiritual amnesia from 1964
[24:00] he said you that wants the holy spirit
[24:02] you that wants that experience
[24:04] not an emotional excitement you want the
[24:06] holy ghost the life
[24:07] the germ of life inside you and you want
[24:10] to get rid of that amnesia that makes
[24:12] you you can't identify yourself
[24:13] you don't know where you stand you don't
[24:15] know what you are let's get rid of it
[24:18] right now
[24:19] there is a new birth here for you a real
[24:21] genuine
[24:22] new birth so when brother brown says
[24:25] this you realize
[24:26] that the the new birth amen is here to
[24:28] take away my spiritual amnesia
[24:31] the new birth is here to reconnect me
[24:33] with what was in the mind of god before
[24:35] my true identity who i really am
[24:37] the new birth is here to unlock the
[24:40] mystery inside of me
[24:41] [Music]
[24:43] let's look at first peter together
[24:49] first peter chapter 1.
[24:57] first peter 1 and 23.
[25:01] i've read this several times but it's
[25:02] always striking to me
[25:04] being born again not of corruptible seed
[25:07] but of
[25:07] incorruptible so the new birth is
[25:10] by the incorruptible seed not the
[25:13] corruptable seed but
[25:14] incorruptible by the word of god
[25:17] so it takes the word of god amen to
[25:20] bring the new birth of the incorruptible
[25:22] seed
[25:23] but of the incorruptible by the word of
[25:25] god which liveth and abideth
[25:27] forever
[25:30] brother ben says in the god who is rich
[25:32] in mercy
[25:33] i'm only saying this not to mix up
[25:36] doctrine
[25:37] but to straighten it out that we might
[25:39] get away from this fear and scare you
[25:40] don't know who you are
[25:42] you are not going to be but now are you
[25:44] the sons of god see
[25:45] you always were the sons of god for when
[25:48] god had you in his thinking at the
[25:49] beginning you had to be some part of you
[25:51] your life that's in you now what was
[25:54] that the incorruptable seed
[25:56] that life that's in you now had to be
[25:58] with god before
[26:00] there well when when he before he even
[26:03] became material on earth before there
[26:04] was anything
[26:06] but god you were one of his attributes
[26:08] he knowed what your name would be he
[26:10] knowed the color hair you would have
[26:11] he knowed all about you so there's
[26:15] nothing to worry about
[26:17] amen and when i say this i always feel
[26:20] compelled
[26:21] amen to qualify some certain statements
[26:24] amen god
[26:25] no he knew he knew before the foundation
[26:27] word you were chosen you were you were
[26:29] called you were justified
[26:30] you were glorified all before in this
[26:32] thinking your place is secure your
[26:34] position is
[26:35] is stable it's not moving but yet in
[26:38] this flesh we're still a given
[26:40] opportunity to make choices
[26:41] amen and while we're in this journey
[26:44] amen those
[26:45] choices will have repercussions so
[26:48] there is still a law of sowing and
[26:50] reaping that takes place
[26:52] but that law of sowing and reaping is in
[26:54] the flesh
[26:55] not in the soul in the flesh we make
[26:59] choices in the flesh
[27:01] amen we get chastised we have we have
[27:03] ups and we have downs amen
[27:05] but god's plan is still secure none of
[27:07] that is changing his plan
[27:09] none of that is changing his idea none
[27:11] of that is changing his purpose for your
[27:13] life
[27:15] those are just those are part of our
[27:17] experience here to learn
[27:20] we're here don't forget we're here on
[27:21] this earth for two things
[27:23] we're here to fulfill his purpose to
[27:25] manifest his word
[27:27] in due season and we're here to learn
[27:30] what we could not learn in perfection
[27:34] so god sets up his laws in the fact that
[27:36] he foreknew us and choses and glorified
[27:38] us so that he would never lose any
[27:40] portion of himself
[27:41] the plan is secure and he made it by
[27:44] faith so that it could be by grace amen
[27:46] because that's his love it's his love
[27:47] for himself
[27:48] it's his love for his elect it's his
[27:49] love for his portions of himself
[27:52] and that grace is secure and he made it
[27:53] by faith because he knows the seed when
[27:55] it comes in contact with the word will
[27:56] believe the word
[27:58] because there are two parts of the same
[27:59] thing
[28:01] but yet for us to learn the things that
[28:03] we couldn't learn in glory glory
[28:05] also gives us free moral agency so that
[28:07] we can make choices and by those choices
[28:09] we can make wrong choices
[28:12] and so in those wrong choices amen we
[28:14] can have a rod of correction and we can
[28:16] begin to realize
[28:17] well after time after time after time we
[28:20] begin to realize
[28:21] that the only thing that works is the
[28:23] word
[28:24] i've tried it by reasoning i've tried it
[28:26] and by group consensus i've tried it
[28:28] every which way i can try it i've let my
[28:30] passions run me i've followed the leader
[28:33] amen i've listened to ministers i've
[28:35] done everything but at the end of the
[28:37] day i realized that the only thing that
[28:39] works is stay with the word
[28:42] because every time i venture from it i
[28:44] get i get spanked i get chastised
[28:46] and i reap consequences that can
[28:48] sometimes last a
[28:50] lifetime and god's not going to change
[28:53] that because you're the elect
[28:54] predestinated seed
[28:56] that's part of the training but it
[28:59] doesn't
[29:00] change who we are
[29:04] when moses was he was born a proper
[29:06] child he was ordained
[29:07] before the foundation of the world to be
[29:09] the deliverer amen that was a
[29:10] fulfillment of the
[29:12] prophecy given to abraham that was
[29:15] when moses was born he was born with
[29:17] that portion of god to manifest that
[29:19] word
[29:20] inside of him already
[29:23] and when he by his own choosing chose to
[29:26] get ahead of god's program and do by his
[29:28] own will
[29:28] what he thought was right he failed
[29:31] miserably and ran into the wilderness
[29:32] for 40 years
[29:33] amen but he could never change what was
[29:36] already in him and who he was ordained
[29:37] to be
[29:38] god had no option but to chase him down
[29:41] in the wilderness and find him and bring
[29:43] him back
[29:44] that's why god has no option but to
[29:46] chase you down in your wilderness and
[29:48] find you and bring you back
[29:49] he had no option but to prepare a fish
[29:51] to swallow jonah
[29:52] no option but to come in a burning bush
[29:54] to get the attention of moses
[29:56] no option but to come as a still small
[29:58] voice to get elijah
[30:00] because nobody else will do it was the
[30:02] portion of himself ordained for that
[30:04] time
[30:04] and that vessel and he had to use that
[30:07] one
[30:08] and he's done the same thing for you and
[30:10] i am no matter how many times we've
[30:12] failed
[30:13] backslid run away he's chased us down
[30:16] he spoke to us in our cave amen he
[30:19] swallowed us up
[30:20] he brought a storm that would get us out
[30:21] of the boat and swallowed us up and
[30:23] bring us back to the commission amen
[30:26] he found us back on the backside of the
[30:28] desert hiding out from the believers
[30:29] hiding from the message
[30:32] and he does something supernatural to
[30:34] get our attention and bring us back to
[30:36] our commission
[30:39] amen he's not going to lose one amen
[30:43] amen amen
[30:46] now you know why life is so hard
[30:51] now you know why every time
[30:55] every time i do wrong every time i get
[30:58] off the path
[30:59] it's the repercussions are so severe
[31:03] it's seeming like others can just move
[31:05] on amen but you're the bride of jesus
[31:07] christ you're the elect of god
[31:09] you're a portion of that life that's the
[31:11] the word to be manifested today
[31:13] amen if you get out of god's will he's
[31:15] gonna find a way to bring you back in
[31:19] and we love that my rod and thy staff
[31:23] they comfort me
[31:26] brother ram says in the message
[31:27] communion i finished with this
[31:29] on sunday now then one day as i walked
[31:32] on the voice talking don't never smoke
[31:34] drink so forth
[31:35] and the young fellas and and all got
[31:37] older see there was something moving
[31:40] but yet all at once i looked up and i
[31:41] said i'm not the son of charles and elle
[31:43] branham
[31:44] what's happening is amnesia's lifting
[31:48] there's something calling like my little
[31:49] eagle i'm not a chicken there's
[31:50] something up yonder somewhere
[31:52] oh great jehovah whoever you are open up
[31:54] i want to come home
[31:56] there's something in me calling there
[31:58] was a born again
[31:59] that little life was laying there the
[32:01] life of water was poured upon it
[32:03] then it began to grow now that old life
[32:05] was forgiven
[32:07] put in the sea of god's forgiveness to
[32:09] never be remembered
[32:11] against me no more
[32:14] the old life the way i was born the
[32:17] wrong nature through hybridization
[32:19] amen through the new birth when i
[32:21] recognized who i was when i
[32:23] recognized the word and i called out to
[32:25] god there was a new birth and the
[32:27] old life was forgiven and put in the sea
[32:30] of god's forgiveness
[32:31] never to be remembered no more and we
[32:33] become a new creature in christ
[32:35] and as a new creature in christ amen in
[32:37] the flesh you can still fail god and
[32:39] make a mistake
[32:40] it will chastise you but you'll never go
[32:42] back to being what you were before
[32:44] that old life you're divorced from that
[32:46] old life it's put in the sea of god's
[32:48] forgiveness
[32:49] never to be remembered no more god
[32:51] doesn't see you as hybrid god doesn't
[32:53] see you as fallen he sees you as
[32:54] redeemed he sees you as
[32:56] perfect he sees you as his bride he'll
[32:58] take care of the errors in the flesh and
[33:00] the wrong thoughts in the spirit he'll
[33:02] correct that and get that out but
[33:03] there's
[33:04] you've changed something has changed
[33:06] you're not what you were
[33:07] you're a born-again son and daughter of
[33:09] god never to go back to what you were
[33:11] before
[33:16] that old life is forgiven put in the sea
[33:18] of god's forgiveness
[33:19] never to be remembered against me no
[33:21] more
[33:22] see now we stand justified as though you
[33:26] never
[33:26] had sinned in the presence of god
[33:31] brother man says christ in the message
[33:33] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[33:35] i'm going to read several quotes quite a
[33:36] few quotes out of this message
[33:38] and it's a message that just continues
[33:40] to unfold for me all the time
[33:42] it says you think i'm beside myself i'm
[33:43] not we've got the devil's answer
[33:48] let me now not me that liveth but
[33:51] christ the word living in me
[33:54] it's not my idea it's his power
[33:57] not my idea it's his word he promised it
[34:00] here it is
[34:01] he said it would be here and here it is
[34:03] we god is answering
[34:05] christ is risen and has paid the price
[34:07] for our redemption
[34:09] what god in christ manifested he gave
[34:11] that flesh that
[34:12] and blood that in the blood might come
[34:14] the life
[34:15] and the flesh be redeemed that god and
[34:18] his redeemed flesh could manifest
[34:20] his word for the day as he did in that
[34:22] day
[34:24] listen this is the answer to the devil's
[34:26] question
[34:28] the answer to the devil's question has
[34:30] everything to do with your position in
[34:31] christ
[34:33] let's just keep reading that then we
[34:36] stand justified in the presence of god
[34:38] as a drop of ink dropping into a tub
[34:40] full of bleach you've never
[34:41] you'll never find the stain in the ink
[34:43] no more it went somewhere
[34:45] it'll never come back again and when a
[34:47] man is truly redeemed that predestinated
[34:49] seed that sees it and accepts it
[34:52] his sins are demolished i'm going to
[34:55] read that sentence again
[34:56] because we're going to talk about what's
[34:58] not in this sentence
[35:00] and when a man is truly redeemed that
[35:02] predestinated seed
[35:03] that sees it and accepts it and then
[35:07] changes his behavior
[35:08] and starts acting right and comes to
[35:10] church every service
[35:12] that's not in there friends it says that
[35:15] predestination that sees it
[35:16] and accepts it his sins are
[35:19] demolished by what
[35:22] seeing the truth and accepting it seeing
[35:25] jesus christ and recognizing for who he
[35:27] is the present day jesus christ
[35:29] you see it your sins are demolished amen
[35:31] but then you say what about all the
[35:33] habits of my flesh and the actions and
[35:34] the lies and the smoking
[35:36] amen let him who purchased you take care
[35:39] of the thing he's purchased
[35:41] believe amen believe your sins are
[35:43] demolished believe you're born again by
[35:45] the spirit of god
[35:46] and let him that's on the inside be the
[35:48] control tower
[35:49] to bring the outside man subject to the
[35:51] inside
[35:52] [Applause]
[35:54] you have to have faith in who you are
[35:55] amen if you're in one day and out the
[35:57] next day in one day now
[35:58] you're never going to kick a smoking
[36:00] habit you're never going to kick a lust
[36:02] habit amen
[36:03] because you're in and out in and out no
[36:05] confidence in the plan of god
[36:06] no confidence in the redemption of jesus
[36:08] christ
[36:10] that's the truth amen you have more
[36:12] confidence you have more
[36:13] faith in your in your inability to keep
[36:16] the word than in his ability to keep his
[36:18] promise
[36:20] it's showing a lack of faith in god a
[36:23] lack of confidence in his blood
[36:28] but we're going to believe the word and
[36:30] let the word wash us
[36:33] and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[36:38] christ is risen and has paid the price
[36:40] for our redemption
[36:41] what god in christ manifested he gave
[36:43] that flesh
[36:45] that and blood that in the blood might
[36:46] come the life and the flesh be redeemed
[36:49] he's not talking about jesus's flesh and
[36:51] his first coming
[36:53] talking about our flesh
[36:56] that god in his redeemed flesh could
[36:59] manifest his word for the day as he did
[37:00] in that day
[37:02] amen i will read this last sentence
[37:06] again when the man is truly redeemed
[37:08] that predestinated seed that season
[37:10] accepts it his sins are demolished
[37:13] it's gone it's separated it's dropped
[37:16] into the ink of the blood of jesus
[37:17] christ and it's
[37:18] never to be remembered god forgets it
[37:21] and he stands as a son and daughter of
[37:22] god in the presence of god
[37:23] amen amen now we are sons of god not we
[37:27] will be we are
[37:28] now we are redeemed we have satan's
[37:30] answer god has vindicated himself god
[37:32] proves himself to his promise in this
[37:34] day
[37:35] hallelujah the headship is here amen
[37:37] christ the risen lord is here
[37:39] in the same power of his resurrection
[37:41] that he that he ever was
[37:43] manifesting itself there's the devil's
[37:46] answer it's not me devil it's him
[37:50] it's not my word it's not my idea it's
[37:53] not my choosing
[37:54] it's his his word his choosing his idea
[37:56] his plan
[37:57] and he's here
[38:00] praise god again in crisis the mystery
[38:04] says predestinated
[38:05] there's the mystery he before christ or
[38:08] anything else was ever on earth you see
[38:09] his great mystery that he chose the
[38:11] bride
[38:12] knowing eve would fall oh this is so
[38:15] good friends
[38:16] he chose the bride knowing eve would
[38:19] fall amen
[38:20] it didn't say he chose eve he chose the
[38:22] bride amen because
[38:24] the heart purpose of god is to have a
[38:26] bride after his own choosing
[38:27] the heart purpose of god is to have you
[38:30] and me
[38:32] amen what he was doing in the garden of
[38:34] eden was displaying or foreshadowing or
[38:37] portraying his heart's purpose
[38:38] he knew that would fall because his
[38:41] heart's purpose
[38:42] amen was not that that was expressing
[38:44] his heart's purpose
[38:45] his heart's purpose was to have a bride
[38:47] of his own choosing
[38:51] let's keep going knowing he would fall
[38:54] from disbelieving the word knowing that
[38:56] she would fall
[38:57] but he would choose a bride that would
[39:00] not fall now listen he chose a bride
[39:04] he didn't choose that bride after you
[39:06] come to the earth and he watched your
[39:08] characteristics and he decided
[39:09] i think that's going to be a pretty good
[39:11] one they're going to keep my laws and
[39:12] understand
[39:13] no he chose the bride before the
[39:15] foundation of the world
[39:17] when you were glorified so
[39:20] so he chose a bride but when he chose a
[39:24] bride he chose a bride that would not
[39:26] fall
[39:30] you cannot become the bride
[39:35] by a good life
[39:38] you cannot become you cannot be thrown
[39:40] out of the bride by a bad life
[39:45] brother chad you mean we can do anything
[39:49] we want
[39:50] yes
[39:54] be born again by the spirit of god let
[39:56] that incorruptible seed come to life and
[39:57] do whatever you want
[39:59] because what that seed wants to do is
[40:00] keep the word love the lord it's part of
[40:02] god there's a natural attraction to the
[40:04] word
[40:05] and a desire to fulfill all of it if
[40:07] you're the bride of jesus christ do what
[40:09] you want
[40:12] and in the deepest depths of your heart
[40:14] amen if you want lust amen and you want
[40:16] cigarettes and you want alcohol
[40:17] go get it friends because i promise you
[40:20] if you're a predestinated seed of god
[40:22] you're going to hit a dead end road amen
[40:24] and you're going to wake up one day in a
[40:26] hospital on your back in a car wreck
[40:28] somewhere
[40:28] because he's not going to lose you
[40:30] anymore he's going to lose jonah or
[40:31] moses or elijah he will get you
[40:33] back to where you need to be until you
[40:36] have that new birth experience and
[40:38] awakened to the real you and then when
[40:40] you do what you want you do what you
[40:41] want from the life that's in the seed
[40:43] and what the life and the seed wants is
[40:45] him wants him
[40:46] all of him all i can give him i want
[40:48] more of him i want more tomorrow than i
[40:50] had today
[40:51] amen i want to live a greater life i
[40:53] want to be more pleasing to him i want
[40:54] to know him better and see him more
[40:56] unveiled
[40:57] that's all we want friends that's it
[41:01] are there desires in this flesh yes
[41:03] wrong desire still wrong actions lust
[41:05] and
[41:05] selfishness and all of that but there's
[41:07] a love on the inside that's greater than
[41:09] the hybridization
[41:10] there's something growing on the inside
[41:12] that wants him
[41:14] more than this flesh amen wants all the
[41:16] things of the world
[41:20] amen let the bride come to a new birth
[41:22] and let her have what she wants
[41:24] because she wants him
[41:29] he would choose a bride that would not
[41:32] fall
[41:33] that would hold on to that word
[41:34] regardless of what all the rest of the
[41:36] world had to say about it
[41:38] they would hold on to that word they are
[41:39] predestined to stand there
[41:41] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[41:43] predestinated the church
[41:45] to that great glorious stand
[41:48] now you see a secret what too to restore
[41:52] fallen eve as she was a prefigure of the
[41:54] church
[41:57] that whole story in genesis adam
[42:00] son of god amen in him being male and
[42:03] female coming out
[42:05] man two manifestations of flesh united
[42:07] back together as one
[42:08] what was that that was a pre-figure
[42:12] of what god was going to do to restore
[42:15] fallen eve as she was the pre-figure of
[42:17] the church
[42:18] so what's his plan been all along and
[42:21] then his great masterpiece that he put
[42:23] the pre-figure masterpiece
[42:24] the masterpiece family in the garden of
[42:26] eden it was marred and it fell
[42:28] and he went right away back to work to
[42:30] remake it he didn't just say
[42:31] oh well that didn't work no he had a
[42:34] plan
[42:34] all along and it was all part of the
[42:36] plan
[42:38] that's why he knew he knew amen that eve
[42:41] would fall
[42:42] amen because he was going to have a
[42:44] bride after his own choosing
[42:47] so what was he going to do with this
[42:48] bride he was going to restore her
[42:50] back fallen eve coming back and then
[42:53] when eve comes
[42:54] back he's not talking about that same
[42:57] flesh amen eve
[42:58] that came out of the flesh of adam when
[43:00] that eve comes back
[43:02] he's talking about whatever that eve
[43:03] prefigured when it's standing here on
[43:05] the earth today
[43:06] he's bringing that back
[43:12] what's the secret he said that's the
[43:14] secret now you see the secret
[43:17] what too to restore fallen eve as she
[43:20] was a prefigure of the church
[43:22] and now notice as god opened up the side
[43:24] of adam and took out eve by his own
[43:25] flesh and blood
[43:27] and divided his spirit from masculine
[43:28] and feminist to feminist and put it in
[43:30] eve
[43:31] took the rib from under his side and
[43:32] made eve out of it so god did the same
[43:34] thing taking out of the side of christ
[43:36] the blood and the water
[43:38] and christ is the word and taking the
[43:40] word and making up his church
[43:42] eve see back to himself again
[43:45] redeemed by the blood that was coming
[43:47] from his body you see it now
[43:50] god's great mystery now being unfolded
[43:53] that's been hid
[43:54] since the foundation of the world but
[43:56] prefigured
[43:57] all the way down through now watch we
[44:00] find that
[44:01] that he did that and here he here in
[44:04] ephesians and many other places
[44:06] but that will give you enough you know
[44:08] now down through the ages
[44:09] he has been slowly unfolding this
[44:11] mystery can you see it now
[44:13] now down through the how did he what
[44:16] happened in the pre-figure now
[44:17] he opened adam's side and took part of
[44:19] his flesh which was adam to make eve
[44:21] the bride has to be the word for he is
[44:24] the word
[44:26] she cannot stand on creeds she cannot
[44:28] stand on the nomination
[44:30] she cannot stand on good behavior she
[44:32] has to stand alone
[44:34] on the word because she is part of it
[44:36] she was taken from christ
[44:40] again further down in christ is a
[44:43] mystery
[44:44] but god's great mystery what the eternal
[44:47] god had as a mystery
[44:48] has now been unfolded in jesus christ
[44:52] then give right down to his church what
[44:54] was once in god's mind
[44:56] is now in the body of christ
[45:00] what's the body of christ the church
[45:03] the believers the bride is the body of
[45:05] christ what was once in god's mind is
[45:07] now in the body of christ jesus making
[45:10] love to the church his bride
[45:12] whispering secrets to her
[45:15] is he making love to you amen is he
[45:18] telling you
[45:18] who you are and what you are and how
[45:20] much you mean to him and what his plans
[45:21] for the future are
[45:24] amen what's he telling you what was in
[45:26] the mind of god
[45:27] and the great mind of god prefigured it
[45:30] and he figured in such a way it was a
[45:32] mystery they didn't understand the story
[45:34] of adam and eve
[45:34] they didn't understand amen well they
[45:36] didn't understand what's going on
[45:38] it was a neat story and for thousands of
[45:39] years it's been a creation story
[45:41] amen but it's not a creation story amen
[45:44] it's a redemption story
[45:46] amen it's a christ in bride's story
[45:51] that's been the secret prefigured all
[45:53] the way down through that's been the
[45:55] secret amen what was fallen has to be
[45:57] restored amen so there's got to be a
[45:59] second adam come to restore all that the
[46:01] first adam lost
[46:03] and he did that in jesus christ but
[46:05] there's got to be a last eve
[46:07] amen because until eve is restored there
[46:09] can never be
[46:10] amen a restoration to eden
[46:15] we cannot there's no way to go to the
[46:18] millennium
[46:19] until the woman is restored
[46:23] and the restoration has to be complete
[46:25] and has to be finished
[46:26] every predestination like seed has to
[46:28] come in to this
[46:30] before we can ever go
[46:34] to any other place
[46:41] praise god christ is mystery of god
[46:45] revealed again notice
[46:46] one liked that first adam and eve before
[46:49] sin separated them in death
[46:51] now christ the second adam in life
[46:53] redeems his bride from death
[46:55] and now on his way back to the original
[46:57] eden
[46:58] restoring back his bride and fellowship
[47:01] back with god as husband and wife in the
[47:04] garden of eden sure
[47:05] christ and his bride so what's happening
[47:08] what's going on all around us what's
[47:10] happening amen the second adam
[47:12] in life redeems his bride from death and
[47:15] now on his way back to the original eden
[47:18] re what's he doing restoring back his
[47:20] bride in fellowship
[47:22] what's he doing the two are becoming one
[47:25] they're being united to get in
[47:26] fellowship to go back to the original
[47:28] eden
[47:30] so there's no going back to eden until
[47:33] you have a fully restored
[47:36] event
[47:38] it's important to know
[47:41] again he says it's a revelation it's as
[47:43] eternal as god's word is eternal look
[47:46] but the threefold purpose of god's great
[47:48] mystery is revealed
[47:49] god manifests in christ christ
[47:51] manifesting the church
[47:52] in order to redeem the lost eve back to
[47:55] the original condition in the garden of
[47:58] eden
[47:59] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[48:01] get he wanted a bride of his own
[48:04] choosing
[48:04] he foreshadowed it it fell he's been
[48:07] bringing it back amen
[48:08] what's he been bringing back he's not
[48:10] been bringing back
[48:11] the original adam and eve that was the
[48:14] foreshadow
[48:14] he's been bringing back what they
[48:17] foreshadowed
[48:19] he's been bringing back what's he been
[48:21] bringing back christ
[48:22] and the bride of his own choosing that's
[48:24] what he's bringing back and he's
[48:26] restoring
[48:27] eve he's restoring who he's restoring
[48:29] the bride in this day
[48:30] restoring her back to what restoring her
[48:33] back to an
[48:34] eden condition what was her eden
[48:36] condition
[48:37] sinless spotless virtuous bride of the
[48:41] son of god
[48:43] god in this day by the washing of the
[48:45] water of the word is restoring this eve
[48:47] back to her eden condition
[48:52] my brother chad quit looking in the
[48:55] mirror
[48:56] and start looking in the mirror
[48:59] the inward man the real you is restored
[49:02] back to an eden condition
[49:04] you never did it in the first place why
[49:07] you is he talking to
[49:08] not the outer man he's talking to the
[49:10] inner man
[49:11] you've never did it in the first place
[49:14] amen and when that revelation
[49:16] then it comes to a place where we know
[49:18] what we are who we are
[49:19] every elections come in and the
[49:21] revelation rises
[49:22] the part that's binding us down still
[49:24] will be changed amen
[49:25] to a glorified condition so don't worry
[49:29] about that
[49:30] focus on the reality the reality is not
[49:33] out here the reality is in here
[49:36] and what has he done he's pronounced it
[49:38] already
[49:39] you who's standing with the word on the
[49:41] word with the word amen if you believe
[49:44] every word every jot and every tittle
[49:46] you're standing
[49:47] justified as if you've never done it in
[49:50] the first place
[49:51] what is that that's an eden condition
[49:54] friends
[49:55] the bride is being restored by the word
[49:57] by faith in the word
[49:59] by the blood of jesus christ and faith
[50:01] in that amen she's being restored
[50:03] by the washing of the water of the word
[50:05] back
[50:06] to an eden condition how could brother
[50:09] branham
[50:10] look at a people just like us
[50:14] say you're the sinless spotless
[50:18] virtuous bride of jesus christ
[50:24] oh god i want a faith in me that says
[50:26] that's nothing but the truth
[50:28] not because i made it happen. because
[50:30] i'm worthy of it happening
[50:32] it's nothing but the truth because
[50:33] something in me knows that's the truth
[50:35] i know that's my full ordained position
[50:37] i know i've been justified i know i've
[50:39] been glorified
[50:40] i know he's called me to this glorious
[50:42] stand i know
[50:43] that i was part of him before the
[50:45] foundation of the world i can't show it
[50:47] to you in the flesh
[50:48] i can't make you believe it but
[50:50] something in me knows it's a reality
[50:53] and i could say if he if that prophet
[50:55] can declare amen me
[50:57] believing all of this word totally
[51:00] justified
[51:01] then i can accept it by faith there's
[51:04] nothing for me to fear
[51:10] praise god in order to redeem that lost
[51:13] eve
[51:14] back to the original condition
[51:17] in the garden of eden because that has
[51:19] to come back
[51:20] before they can go back to eden she's
[51:23] got to be restored
[51:24] back to an eaten condition before she
[51:26] can go back to eden
[51:29] that means all of our sin has to be
[51:31] washed away
[51:35] again in crisis of mystery says watch
[51:38] redeemed by christ the second adam
[51:40] you believe he was going back home to
[51:42] eden with his fallen wife redeemed back
[51:45] home again
[51:46] that's christ in the church today taking
[51:48] his wife back
[51:50] what's he doing he's in the church today
[51:53] taking us back
[51:56] see the threefold mystery now god
[51:58] manifested in christ christ manifested
[51:59] in the church
[52:00] all together to bring back the original
[52:03] adam
[52:04] and eve again man and woman which are
[52:06] one made out of the same blood and same
[52:08] spirit
[52:09] and everything else whatever he is
[52:13] she is what's he doing today
[52:16] it's christ manifested his church all
[52:19] together to bring back the original
[52:21] adam and eve again
[52:26] now remember
[52:31] what did eve fall from
[52:35] she fell from disbelieving the word
[52:39] so if you're going to restore eve back
[52:43] first you have to bring the word back
[52:47] right if there's going to be a
[52:48] restoration of the woman of eve to the
[52:50] original eaten condition
[52:52] then in the original eden condition they
[52:54] had the word of god
[52:56] unperverted unpolluted
[52:59] unchanged they had the original word
[53:03] the perfect word they had the original
[53:05] commandment from the lord
[53:06] amen and then that got perverted and
[53:09] then she fell by disbelieving the word
[53:11] and taking satan's lie
[53:12] and then after that she manifest in the
[53:14] flesh what had already happened on the
[53:16] inside
[53:18] so now if we're going to bring her back
[53:20] to an eden condition
[53:22] you have to bring the word back to an
[53:24] eden condition
[53:25] you have to bring a word back to its
[53:26] original word in its original form and
[53:28] its original purity without perversion
[53:30] amen without corruption of man without
[53:33] reasoning without all that
[53:34] if you bring the word back amen then you
[53:37] can bring
[53:37] eve back to the word she fell by
[53:40] disbelieving the word
[53:42] amen she's still falling amen by
[53:44] disbelieving the word
[53:45] because she doesn't have the word she's
[53:47] believing in trinitarian baptisms and a
[53:50] trinity doctrine of god
[53:51] and believing in all kinds of false
[53:53] ideas and then in order to get her back
[53:55] to an even condition
[53:57] you've got to bring the word back for
[53:58] her to believe so she can come back to
[54:01] faith in the word
[54:02] to come back to the purity she was in in
[54:04] the beginning
[54:07] not by her conduct by her faith
[54:13] now you see why god sends a prophet why
[54:15] god restored his word
[54:16] why did god restore his word so you can
[54:18] say i know the truth on servant seed and
[54:19] i know this and i know
[54:20] to know so he could restore you he has
[54:22] to restore the word so he can restore
[54:24] you
[54:25] amen the husband has to come so you can
[54:26] unite with your mate
[54:28] amen the revealed word he's got
[54:31] i mean the whole the whole ministry of
[54:33] the prophet amen was not to say
[54:35] hey look at what we know and
[54:36] denominations are wrong this doctrine's
[54:39] wrong
[54:39] that doctrine's wrong let's have
[54:41] doctrinal debates because now we're
[54:42] right
[54:43] that wasn't the purpose it was to
[54:45] restore the word
[54:46] so when he restores the word there's
[54:48] going to be a seed on the earth that
[54:50] will
[54:50] believe that fully restored word so the
[54:53] full word
[54:54] in its original form is back in an eaten
[54:56] condition
[54:58] the tree of life restored
[55:02] and the tree of life restored can now
[55:05] restore the bride tree
[55:07] which will be the tree of life restored
[55:08] back to himself again
[55:13] god sent his prophet to restore his word
[55:17] back to purity so that he can raise up a
[55:21] bride that would believe that word and
[55:22] be purified by faith in that word
[55:25] to come back to an eden condition again
[55:27] so the two could unite
[55:30] all friends it was more than saying i
[55:32] believe god sent a prophet
[55:34] i do believe god sent a prophet what was
[55:36] that prophet here to do what was his
[55:37] purpose for coming
[55:38] because god always sends a prophet with
[55:40] a purpose moses came to lead him out of
[55:43] egypt and to take him to the promised
[55:44] land not so they can say moses was a
[55:46] prophet
[55:47] yeah he was a prophet what was the
[55:48] purpose of the prophet
[55:53] to do the work of the lord what was the
[55:54] work of the lord
[55:56] to unite the two together
[55:59] in the token he says then you are
[56:01] subject for the resurrection
[56:03] because the resurrection power is
[56:05] already in you
[56:06] the token is the resurrection power
[56:09] showing that jesus raised up from the
[56:11] dead
[56:11] and you are raised up from the dead the
[56:14] dead
[56:15] things of unbelief amen eve has come
[56:18] back to life again
[56:20] you're raised from the dead being the
[56:22] bride of his own choosing
[56:24] what dead the dead of unbelief how can
[56:26] you come back from the dead of unbelief
[56:28] unless the word has first been restored
[56:30] for you to believe in
[56:33] you are raised from the dead the dead
[56:35] things of unbelief and have been made
[56:36] alive in the word of jesus christ
[56:39] you believe it and the word lives
[56:40] through you
[56:42] let's turn to ephesians chapter 2
[56:44] quickly
[56:52] ephesians chapter 2
[56:56] verse 1 and you hath he quickened who
[57:00] were dead in trespasses and sins
[57:03] where in time past you walked according
[57:05] to the course of this world according to
[57:06] the prince of the power of the air
[57:08] the spirit that now worketh in the
[57:09] children of disobedience
[57:11] among whom also we all had our
[57:13] conversation
[57:14] we were all in that miserable shape in
[57:18] times past in the lust of our flesh
[57:19] fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[57:21] and of the mind and we're by nature the
[57:23] children of wrath even as others now i
[57:24] want you to read that scripture
[57:26] carefully i don't want to go too fast
[57:28] among them also we all had our
[57:29] conversation in times past
[57:30] fulfilling the lust of our flesh outer
[57:32] man fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[57:35] outer man
[57:36] and of the mind outer man and we're by
[57:39] nature outer man
[57:42] children of wrath even as others
[57:46] that's the hybridization that's the
[57:48] wrong birth that's coming the wrong way
[57:50] but in order to change that amen he's
[57:53] got to bring the new birth out of the
[57:54] incorruptable seed
[57:57] but god who is a rich in mercy for his
[57:59] great love wherewith he loved us
[58:01] even when we were dead in sins and it
[58:03] hath quickened us together with christ
[58:05] by grace you're saved and have raised us
[58:08] up together and made us sit together in
[58:09] heavenly places
[58:10] in christ jesus that in the ages to come
[58:13] he might show
[58:14] the exceeding riches of his grace and
[58:16] his kindness towards us through christ
[58:18] jesus
[58:18] for by grace are you saved through faith
[58:20] and that none of yourselves it is the
[58:22] gift of god
[58:23] not of works lest any man should boast
[58:25] for we are his workmanship
[58:27] created in christ jesus unto good works
[58:29] which god hath before ordained that we
[58:31] should walk in them
[58:34] you were born the way others were born
[58:37] you fulfilled the lust of the flesh the
[58:39] way others fulfilled the love to the
[58:40] flesh
[58:41] you fulfilled the desires of the mind
[58:44] with a corrupt mind like everybody else
[58:46] but god who is rich in mercy love
[58:50] that he loved us already loved us amen
[58:52] for by grace you are saved
[58:54] amen through faith and that not of
[58:56] yourselves it is a gift of god
[58:58] god had already pre-wired you to receive
[59:01] his word
[59:01] that's his grace that's his love
[59:08] let's go to colossians chapter 1.
[59:14] colossians 1 and verse 18.
[59:19] and he is the head of the body the
[59:20] church who is the beginning the
[59:22] firstborn from the dead
[59:24] then in all things he might have
[59:26] preeminence
[59:28] brother ben says back in christ is the
[59:30] mystery god revealed
[59:31] he is the head of the church which is
[59:33] his body and he wants
[59:34] the preeminences listen now listen close
[59:37] what we're going here
[59:38] what he is to be the head of the body
[59:41] his bride body
[59:42] which is taken from him flesh and bone
[59:44] like adam see brian
[59:46] born from the dead see that's born from
[59:49] the dead sin of
[59:50] unbelief what killed eve unbelief is
[59:54] that right
[59:55] their unbelief in what the unbelief in
[59:58] god
[59:59] no she had faith in god sure did she
[1:00:01] there isn't
[1:00:02] she didn't say there is no god no sir
[1:00:04] she wasn't an infidel
[1:00:05] she said you know i don't believe in in
[1:00:07] the word at all no
[1:00:09] she believed all but one little thing
[1:00:12] now you see why the word has got to be
[1:00:15] restored in this day
[1:00:17] and then it's got to come back to the
[1:00:19] full revelation of jesus christ
[1:00:21] it can't have parts missing and it can't
[1:00:22] have parts that are wrong
[1:00:27] because she wasn't a disbeliever of god
[1:00:30] she wasn't a disbeliever of all the word
[1:00:33] but she lost that part of the word
[1:00:34] through reasoning that part of the word
[1:00:36] and because of the lie of the devil
[1:00:39] and she was deceived she disbelieved and
[1:00:42] the church ages has been deceived
[1:00:45] by the same thing amen but he's got to
[1:00:48] bring
[1:00:48] back that word so she can believe it
[1:00:51] so she can be restored now didn't the
[1:00:53] bible say over in the book of revelation
[1:00:55] jesus said himself
[1:00:56] as jesus sent my angel to testify of
[1:00:58] these things unto you whosoever shall
[1:01:00] take
[1:01:00] one word from it or add one word to it
[1:01:03] and if all this
[1:01:04] heartache and sorrow had to come because
[1:01:05] a woman doubted one word of god
[1:01:08] will he let you back doubting one word
[1:01:10] he would be unjust
[1:01:12] see that wouldn't be right be condemned
[1:01:15] skip down a paragraph he says now no
[1:01:17] notice now he is the head of the body
[1:01:19] that's born that's born from the sin of
[1:01:22] unbelief in god's word
[1:01:26] she was dead but she's
[1:01:29] resurrected now she's born from the dead
[1:01:33] born from the dead sin of unbelief in
[1:01:35] god's word
[1:01:36] what what is the bride she's born from
[1:01:38] the dead she's coming
[1:01:39] back to her eden condition to be united
[1:01:43] with the headship to go back to eden
[1:01:47] that excuses every denomination every
[1:01:49] crete see unbelief in the word
[1:01:51] which is himself the word of life the
[1:01:54] word only has life
[1:01:56] any other word is hybrid no matter how
[1:01:57] much it looks like it it isn't the word
[1:01:59] the word produces its own life and eve
[1:02:02] swapped for personal knowledge
[1:02:04] the the eve swapped it for her own
[1:02:07] knowledge
[1:02:07] and her own life amen but the word
[1:02:10] produces its own life
[1:02:11] amen so if we can get the word back the
[1:02:14] word produces its own life
[1:02:16] when eve swapped it for knowledge it
[1:02:18] brought death amen and now this bride
[1:02:20] has been laying dead but she's born
[1:02:22] again
[1:02:22] from the dead amen quickened from dead
[1:02:25] from sins and trespasses quickened from
[1:02:27] unbelief
[1:02:28] brought back to life again brought back
[1:02:31] to her eating condition
[1:02:34] and when she comes back to the word the
[1:02:37] word produces its own life
[1:02:40] it's not a life you live it's a life he
[1:02:42] lives through you
[1:02:46] again in christ as the word of god
[1:02:47] revealed he is the first fruits of the
[1:02:49] resurrection
[1:02:51] is that right watch then what is he he
[1:02:54] is the head of the body
[1:02:55] which is his church then the bride buddy
[1:02:57] body must
[1:02:58] follow the head for it as part of his
[1:03:00] resurrection
[1:03:01] and part of the mystery the bride body
[1:03:05] is part of the resurrection and part
[1:03:08] of the mystery and god has had a mystery
[1:03:12] he's been unfolding it down through the
[1:03:14] ages amen and the bride body
[1:03:16] is part of that mystery and so when when
[1:03:18] christ
[1:03:19] comes to the fullness when the full word
[1:03:21] comes back amen is resurrected out of
[1:03:23] dead denominations and comes back to its
[1:03:25] full power
[1:03:26] the body must resurrect with the head
[1:03:29] when the word comes
[1:03:30] back the bride comes back
[1:03:35] praise god i'll read that sins again
[1:03:37] then the bride
[1:03:38] body must follow the head for it as part
[1:03:39] of his resurrection and part of the
[1:03:41] mystery
[1:03:42] it's impossible for it not to go oh my
[1:03:44] it's part of god's mystery
[1:03:46] how god revealed himself here and raise
[1:03:48] it up by the word
[1:03:49] so he reveals his church and raises it
[1:03:51] up by the same word
[1:03:53] it's part of the threefold mystery as
[1:03:56] the head was took from the grave
[1:03:57] so must the body follow him back to eden
[1:04:01] where the head of the family the man the
[1:04:03] bridegroom the bride being the body of
[1:04:05] the bridegroom must follow
[1:04:07] the bride because that's the head and
[1:04:09] the head is revealed and come back with
[1:04:11] eternal life
[1:04:12] and the body must follow that because
[1:04:14] it's husband and wife again
[1:04:15] amen and as long as you're pregnanted
[1:04:18] with the same word
[1:04:19] which is his body you've took his body
[1:04:23] become in him when you took the word
[1:04:27] amen you become one with him when you
[1:04:29] took the word
[1:04:30] what were not yesterday's word but
[1:04:32] today's word the full word that's come
[1:04:34] back to the original
[1:04:37] not the creed the word let's turn to
[1:04:41] first corinthians
[1:04:45] first corinthians 15.
[1:04:50] first corinthians 15 and 20.
[1:04:58] in first corinthians chapter 15 verse 20
[1:05:01] but now is christ risen from the dead
[1:05:03] and become the first fruits of them that
[1:05:05] slept
[1:05:06] for since by man came death by man came
[1:05:08] also the resurrection of the dead
[1:05:11] president adam all die even so in christ
[1:05:13] shall all be made alive
[1:05:15] but every man in his own order christ
[1:05:17] the first reads afterward
[1:05:18] they that are christ at his coming
[1:05:26] let's read this again i like to read it
[1:05:29] again
[1:05:30] for as an adam all die even so in christ
[1:05:33] shall all be made alive
[1:05:35] but every man in his own order christ
[1:05:37] the firstfruits
[1:05:38] afterward they that are christ at his
[1:05:41] coming
[1:05:43] when the word resurrects the bride
[1:05:48] resurrects
[1:05:50] let's read this verse again 23 but every
[1:05:52] man in his own order christ the first
[1:05:53] roots afterward they that are christ
[1:05:55] that is coming
[1:05:56] then cometh the end
[1:06:02] when he shall have delivered up the
[1:06:03] kingdom to god even the father
[1:06:05] when he shall put down all rule and all
[1:06:07] authority
[1:06:08] and power for he must reign until he
[1:06:10] hath put all enemies under his feet
[1:06:12] the last enemy that he shall destroy is
[1:06:16] death
[1:06:19] praise be to god he's taking us back
[1:06:23] to an eaten condition he's taking us
[1:06:26] back in spirit
[1:06:27] and he's going to take us back in flesh
[1:06:32] and the seventh seal prophet of god says
[1:06:34] it's an old battle that started way back
[1:06:36] beyond time
[1:06:38] and there was satan and his angels was
[1:06:40] kicked out and then they come to earth
[1:06:41] and the battle set in again because eve
[1:06:43] broke down the barrier from where she
[1:06:45] was isolated
[1:06:46] behind the word of god from that very
[1:06:49] hour
[1:06:49] satan won the battle over god's word
[1:06:51] because one of his subjects the weaker
[1:06:53] let down the bar and that's exactly how
[1:06:57] he's won the battle
[1:06:58] every time has been because one of his
[1:07:01] subjects let down the bar from the word
[1:07:05] so how is he going to restore it back
[1:07:08] when the subjects
[1:07:10] take all the word and believe the word
[1:07:15] now eve brother brethren said eve was
[1:07:18] fortified behind the word
[1:07:21] but now adam and eve in the garden of
[1:07:24] eden were a foreshadow of what god
[1:07:25] really wanted because god created them
[1:07:27] and knew that they would fall
[1:07:29] because his heart his his heart purpose
[1:07:32] was have a bride of his own choosing
[1:07:34] so he set this up as a foreshadow
[1:07:36] declaring from the end from the
[1:07:37] beginning from the beginning what he did
[1:07:39] then is declaring what will be at the
[1:07:40] end
[1:07:42] so now he set this up to foreshadow it
[1:07:44] fell he created in a way that he could
[1:07:45] fall knowing it would fall although he
[1:07:47] didn't will it to fall he knew it would
[1:07:48] fall
[1:07:49] and it would fulfill his great purpose
[1:07:51] and his great plan because what he
[1:07:53] wanted was he wanted a bride you and me
[1:07:55] to be restored back so he hid her
[1:07:58] behind the word and and the security of
[1:08:02] adam and his wife
[1:08:03] was to stay behind the word but
[1:08:06] something's
[1:08:07] changed something's different
[1:08:10] now now brother branham
[1:08:14] let's just read what he said i'm not
[1:08:15] going to ruin it by saying it
[1:08:17] in the identified masterpiece of god in
[1:08:19] december of 1964
[1:08:21] he says when he made his first
[1:08:23] masterpiece he put him behind the word
[1:08:26] when he made his second masterpiece he
[1:08:28] was the word
[1:08:31] big difference there's a real big
[1:08:34] difference
[1:08:34] from being behind the word and being the
[1:08:37] word
[1:08:38] because adam and eve were protected
[1:08:40] behind the word as long as they stayed
[1:08:42] behind the word
[1:08:43] the devil couldn't get to them amen so
[1:08:45] if they would step around from this word
[1:08:47] amen then they were open game for the
[1:08:49] devil and that's how they fell
[1:08:50] by moving out from behind the word amen
[1:08:53] but what if there's nothing to be behind
[1:08:55] anymore
[1:08:56] amen it's not the thing that was
[1:08:58] protecting them was separate from them
[1:09:00] but now the thing that's protecting us
[1:09:02] is who we really are
[1:09:03] we are the word amen that's why she
[1:09:06] can't fall
[1:09:06] she's predestinated not to fall because
[1:09:09] she's not behind the word
[1:09:10] she is the word and the devil couldn't
[1:09:14] go through that word to get to them
[1:09:16] amen but now we are the word and he
[1:09:18] can't break the word
[1:09:20] [Applause]
[1:09:22] it's different god protected them behind
[1:09:24] the wall of the word because it was a
[1:09:26] foreshadow but when the reality comes
[1:09:28] it's not behind the word
[1:09:29] it is the word you can no more fail than
[1:09:32] god can fail
[1:09:33] amen you are the living word amen jesus
[1:09:36] christ
[1:09:36] manifested in the flesh body of his
[1:09:38] bride amen
[1:09:39] how is the devil he can circle all
[1:09:42] around today man
[1:09:43] but he cannot penetrate that word
[1:09:45] because we are the word the living word
[1:09:48] restored back to the word the word come
[1:09:51] to the word
[1:09:52] the body and the headship the capstone
[1:09:54] is united together
[1:09:56] and when we take him his word amen when
[1:09:58] we take his body the word we become in
[1:10:00] him
[1:10:01] the word
[1:10:04] amen cannot be defeated cannot fail amen
[1:10:08] why
[1:10:08] because the word has been restored to
[1:10:10] the original condition
[1:10:12] the bride has been united with that word
[1:10:14] and come in the word to be part of the
[1:10:16] word and she's not
[1:10:17] hiding behind anything she doesn't have
[1:10:21] to hide behind
[1:10:22] anything there's nothing to hide behind
[1:10:25] jesus christ when he came in flesh two
[1:10:27] thousand years ago he wasn't hiding
[1:10:29] behind
[1:10:30] anything he was the word made flesh he
[1:10:32] didn't have to hide he didn't need
[1:10:34] protection
[1:10:34] he was the word and he could not be
[1:10:37] defeated
[1:10:39] amen we're not hiding worried if i step
[1:10:42] over here if i step over
[1:10:44] here i'll be lost oh i've got to be so
[1:10:46] careful
[1:10:47] no you are the word
[1:10:50] the very plan of god the very heart
[1:10:52] purpose of god
[1:10:53] is taking place in our lives right now
[1:10:55] and it cannot fail it's predestinated
[1:10:58] not to fall amen
[1:11:01] when he made a second masterpiece he was
[1:11:04] the word
[1:11:05] he was the word not behind the word but
[1:11:08] he was
[1:11:09] the word god never changes the plan
[1:11:12] that's exactly what he started off to do
[1:11:14] his first church with the word
[1:11:18] a few paragraphs down it says now we
[1:11:21] noticed that god began to make a bride
[1:11:23] for christ
[1:11:24] and the bride must be identified with
[1:11:26] him and in him
[1:11:28] because it's part of him now the
[1:11:30] brightest part of him she is part of him
[1:11:32] the word for that day the bride becomes
[1:11:35] part of the word for its christ
[1:11:38] now you believe that we have to be in
[1:11:41] christ
[1:11:41] in christ we have to be of christ in
[1:11:44] christ
[1:11:44] part of christ what is a woman when she
[1:11:47] takes a man or a man takes a woman
[1:11:49] the woman has to be part of him they're
[1:11:51] no longer two they're one
[1:11:52] and when god and christ become one they
[1:11:54] were one
[1:11:55] because god was the word and the word
[1:11:57] was made flesh
[1:11:58] the flesh and the word become one and
[1:12:00] when the church becomes christ's bride
[1:12:03] she and the gospels are the same
[1:12:09] i want to ask you what the gospels are
[1:12:11] brother ben and brandon say she and the
[1:12:13] gospel are the same she and the gospels
[1:12:15] are the same
[1:12:16] if you look at the gospels matthew mark
[1:12:17] luke and john what are they
[1:12:20] they're a record of something what do
[1:12:22] they record
[1:12:23] the son of man ministry
[1:12:27] that's the record of the son of man
[1:12:28] ministry and we know the son of man
[1:12:31] ministry has returned
[1:12:33] the son of man is here and i'll read
[1:12:35] that sins again and when the church
[1:12:37] becomes christ's bride
[1:12:39] she and the gospels are the same
[1:12:43] that was the record of the son of man
[1:12:44] misery and now she's declaring the son
[1:12:46] of man
[1:12:48] ministry
[1:12:51] in the easter seal he says his messianic
[1:12:53] anointed ones believe that
[1:12:56] what is the messiah what is the messiah
[1:12:59] messiah's anointed one and now if he was
[1:13:02] the messiah by being the anointed one
[1:13:03] for
[1:13:04] that day to fulfill the word of god to
[1:13:06] be the redeemer
[1:13:07] and the anointed one and god raised up
[1:13:09] that body
[1:13:10] his bride is the anointed one for this
[1:13:13] day
[1:13:15] she and the gospels become the same
[1:13:19] it's already raised with him in the
[1:13:20] resurrection because these
[1:13:22] these two are one
[1:13:26] when the word come back to original the
[1:13:29] predestinated seed that
[1:13:30] sees it and accepts it moves back to
[1:13:33] original eden condition
[1:13:37] you never did it in the first place
[1:13:42] back in christ as the mystery of god
[1:13:44] revealed he says what is it not them
[1:13:45] people the headship and the body has
[1:13:47] become one unit
[1:13:49] it's god manifested in his people that's
[1:13:52] the reason the husband and wife is no
[1:13:53] longer twained there one god in this
[1:13:55] church is one
[1:13:56] christ in you god's great revelation
[1:13:58] glory to god
[1:13:59] even bearing his name his name is jesus
[1:14:01] the anointed
[1:14:03] the reason he's called jesus he is the
[1:14:04] anointed it's the anointed body of
[1:14:06] christ
[1:14:07] proving manifesting god like that body
[1:14:10] did
[1:14:10] and that body redeemed every of this
[1:14:13] these bodies
[1:14:14] and through there god works his
[1:14:15] threefold manifestation
[1:14:17] going to the kingdom risen paid the
[1:14:20] price we're redeemed
[1:14:21] god has provided proved it vindicated it
[1:14:24] see
[1:14:25] and we stand justified in christ before
[1:14:28] him because he cannot pass judgment
[1:14:30] for he's already judged that body in
[1:14:32] which i am a part of
[1:14:34] what how am i a part of it here it is
[1:14:36] it's me
[1:14:38] if ye abide in me and my words in you
[1:14:39] then ask what you will ask the father
[1:14:41] anything in my name it will be done
[1:14:42] because it's there
[1:14:43] justified glory to god oh if i could get
[1:14:46] the world to see that why
[1:14:48] there you are there is the body of
[1:14:50] christ living
[1:14:51] standing redeemed redeemed
[1:14:56] he says it with emphasis if i could get
[1:14:57] the world to see this you're not going
[1:14:59] to be redeemed
[1:15:00] by accepting the redeemer in this full
[1:15:02] measure you
[1:15:03] are now redeemed
[1:15:06] god was working through the church ages
[1:15:08] amen as a redeemer redeeming redeeming
[1:15:11] amen but at the end of the church ages
[1:15:12] amen he has redeemed amen he's redeemed
[1:15:15] the church he's redeemed his bride
[1:15:17] and now he's come to unite with what
[1:15:19] he's redeemed
[1:15:20] we are already redeemed now uniting with
[1:15:23] christ
[1:15:26] so there's no hoping it's going to work
[1:15:28] out it's already worked out
[1:15:32] and we stand justified oh praise god
[1:15:35] justified in his sight
[1:15:36] why are we justified that's a good
[1:15:39] question why are we justified
[1:15:41] listen the way he says we are his
[1:15:45] victory why are we his victory
[1:15:49] because the heart purpose of god was to
[1:15:52] have a bride of his own choosing
[1:15:55] and in the in the pre-figure that bride
[1:15:58] fell
[1:15:58] by disbelieving the word but
[1:16:01] god before the foundation of the world
[1:16:04] portioned himself out to ensure that the
[1:16:07] bride of his own choosing
[1:16:09] will not fall by disbelieving the word
[1:16:12] and he's been bringing it back word by
[1:16:14] word word by word word by word
[1:16:16] until finally he builds it all the way
[1:16:19] back to the capping off
[1:16:20] and brings the full word back amen and
[1:16:22] he's already
[1:16:23] seen down through time that there'll be
[1:16:25] a portion of myself that will be my
[1:16:27] bride of my own choosing
[1:16:28] and when i bring the word back to its
[1:16:30] original condition there'll be a
[1:16:32] there'll be a bride there that'll say
[1:16:34] that's nothing but the truth and when
[1:16:36] they say that's nothing but the truth
[1:16:37] that that brings her into her original
[1:16:40] condition
[1:16:41] sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus
[1:16:43] christ
[1:16:44] by what by the same measure amen that
[1:16:47] abraham was
[1:16:48] imputed with righteousness by the same
[1:16:50] measure amen that there's always been
[1:16:52] salvation down through time because they
[1:16:54] see the word and they receive the word
[1:16:57] and when the word come back in fullness
[1:16:58] it brought the redemption in fullness
[1:17:02] there's now no partial there's no you've
[1:17:05] got all this
[1:17:06] but i'm still covering for this amen no
[1:17:08] he brought all the word back
[1:17:10] and the bride says i believe it all
[1:17:13] amen i believe but i believe the
[1:17:15] predestination i believe the serpent
[1:17:16] seed i believe water baptism
[1:17:18] i believe i was in the mind of god
[1:17:20] before the foundation i believe it all
[1:17:23] i may not explain it well i mean i may
[1:17:25] not be able to put it in terms of your
[1:17:26] understanding
[1:17:27] but something in me says everything that
[1:17:29] prophet said is nothing but the truth
[1:17:35] redeemed not redeeming
[1:17:38] redeemed redeemed
[1:17:44] the decide why are we justified we are
[1:17:47] his victory
[1:17:49] redemption is not our victory i got
[1:17:52] redeemed
[1:17:54] i went to the altar and i heard that
[1:17:56] preacher and i said he's right
[1:17:58] and i went up there and got redeemed
[1:17:59] it's not your victory it's his victory
[1:18:04] we are justified we are his victory the
[1:18:06] church is his victory
[1:18:08] we come forth in his last days with this
[1:18:09] glorious gospel showing
[1:18:11] his victory he died for this purpose and
[1:18:13] we are proof of his victory
[1:18:16] amen we see him coming down and living
[1:18:19] among the church
[1:18:20] that's his victory shows that he
[1:18:22] couldn't keep him in the grave neither
[1:18:23] can they keep us
[1:18:25] and we're already potentially arise
[1:18:28] because we've raised from the dead
[1:18:30] unbelief in his word what is it eve is
[1:18:33] raised from her dead condition again
[1:18:35] and being restored back to her eating
[1:18:37] condition
[1:18:38] because we're raised from the dead
[1:18:39] unbelief in his word from denomination
[1:18:41] creeds to an eternal word of the eternal
[1:18:43] god
[1:18:44] which is him himself working through us
[1:18:47] manifesting himself
[1:18:48] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:18:51] forever
[1:18:53] and then there there would be a time
[1:18:54] come forth when he would express himself
[1:18:56] this is christ as the mystery god
[1:18:58] revealed
[1:18:59] there would be a time he could express
[1:19:01] himself in fullness of his godhead deity
[1:19:03] through his church
[1:19:05] have the preeminence in his church oh my
[1:19:07] what the anointed man
[1:19:09] now the anointed people oh my
[1:19:12] to bring back the anointed bride and
[1:19:15] bridegroom
[1:19:18] anointed by why accepting what eve
[1:19:21] turned down
[1:19:22] what did he have turned down the
[1:19:23] original word and its purity she turned
[1:19:25] it down
[1:19:26] amen but now we've accepted what eve
[1:19:28] turned down
[1:19:30] you realize that was a foreshadow of
[1:19:32] four days it wasn't that we said
[1:19:34] oh yeah i'm not going to eat of that i
[1:19:36] mean if i was ever in the garden of eden
[1:19:37] i wouldn't eat that fruit whatever that
[1:19:39] fruit was
[1:19:39] it's not that that was a foreshadow she
[1:19:42] left the original word in its original
[1:19:44] condition and for reasoning she took her
[1:19:46] own mind by her own lust
[1:19:48] and that's been the failure of mankind
[1:19:50] from that day on
[1:19:52] but there's coming a time when he's
[1:19:54] going to bring the full word back
[1:19:56] and that full word is coming back and
[1:19:58] declaring itself and showing itself and
[1:20:00] it's saying i'm here
[1:20:02] i'm here
[1:20:06] i'm here
[1:20:09] amen listening for a voice to say
[1:20:12] i see you
[1:20:16] i see you i see you you're here
[1:20:20] you're here you're here in all your full
[1:20:22] glory you're here in all your power
[1:20:24] you're here in all your fullness he's
[1:20:26] going i'm here and there's a people
[1:20:28] predestined on the earth that says
[1:20:30] i can see you and the world's blind to
[1:20:34] it
[1:20:34] but there's a predestined bride that's
[1:20:36] called to go back to an even condition
[1:20:38] he's calling i'm here do you see me in
[1:20:40] the cloud do you see me in the son of
[1:20:42] man
[1:20:43] and a son of man do you see me in the
[1:20:45] bride do you see me in the word and
[1:20:47] there's a bride here saying
[1:20:48] i see you i see you i see you
[1:20:55] and that revelation is bringing her back
[1:20:58] to her original condition we've accepted
[1:21:02] what eve turned down
[1:21:03] the original word in its full
[1:21:05] manifestation in its original form
[1:21:08] and we've accepted what eve turned down
[1:21:10] and we accepted what eve turned down
[1:21:12] we've reversed the curse that was upon
[1:21:14] eve
[1:21:14] and we've come back into an eden
[1:21:16] condition
[1:21:18] that's why brother branham could look at
[1:21:19] the the church and say
[1:21:21] you are the sin if you're standing on
[1:21:23] this word with this word
[1:21:24] every jot every tittle where are we
[1:21:27] standing i'm trying to tell you as we
[1:21:29] close
[1:21:29] you're standing on god's word and with
[1:21:31] god's word you're the sinless
[1:21:33] spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ
[1:21:35] you're totally justified
[1:21:37] you never did it in the first place
[1:21:38] because you can accept him you can see
[1:21:40] him amen you recognize him for who he is
[1:21:43] amen and you can come to that
[1:21:45] manifestation and become one with that
[1:21:47] you are back in your original eden
[1:21:49] condition
[1:21:53] will i make the body change i already
[1:21:55] did
[1:21:57] i already have i've been changed and
[1:22:00] then i've been brought back from the
[1:22:01] life
[1:22:02] i've been resurrected from the dead
[1:22:04] deadness of unbelief i've been
[1:22:06] resurrected into the newness of life
[1:22:08] i've already got a body change on the
[1:22:10] inside
[1:22:10] i'm just waiting for the outside to
[1:22:12] catch up with the inside
[1:22:14] i've already been brought back to what i
[1:22:16] fell from i've already manifested the
[1:22:18] purpose that he had from before the
[1:22:19] foundation of the world
[1:22:21] now we're just waiting for that last one
[1:22:22] to recognize their place amen
[1:22:24] and then the outside is going to catch
[1:22:26] up with the inside
[1:22:27] i'm not afraid of not making the body
[1:22:29] change i've already made it
[1:22:32] when did you make it before the
[1:22:33] foundation of the world when i was in
[1:22:34] the mind of god that's why the sons of
[1:22:36] god clapped together and shouted for
[1:22:38] joy but the person why because they saw
[1:22:41] the plan of redemption
[1:22:43] and they began to shout and rejoice at
[1:22:45] the plan of redemption
[1:22:47] i was shouting then that's why i'm
[1:22:49] shouting now i was saying hallelujah
[1:22:51] then
[1:22:52] when he showed it to me in a foreshadow
[1:22:54] amen and now i'm saying hallelujah now
[1:22:56] when i'm down in this condition amen
[1:22:58] spiritual amnesia is being
[1:23:00] broken away and i can rejoice over the
[1:23:02] same thing i rejoiced over back there
[1:23:04] his plan of redemption for me not
[1:23:07] redeemed
[1:23:07] not being redeemed not going to be
[1:23:09] redeemed i am redeemed amen
[1:23:12] the word has come back amen christ is
[1:23:14] here in fullness the words in its
[1:23:16] original condition
[1:23:17] and i've united as a husband with a wife
[1:23:19] with the original word
[1:23:20] bringing me back to my original
[1:23:22] condition
[1:23:25] hallelujah what are we afraid of nothing
[1:23:28] how will he lose that he never will
[1:23:32] friends
[1:23:34] anointed by why accepting what eve
[1:23:37] turned down
[1:23:38] and adam coming back with the anointing
[1:23:41] of the word because he said my word is
[1:23:43] spirit
[1:23:44] see anointed with the word what eve
[1:23:46] turned down
[1:23:47] oh listen close what eve turned down
[1:23:51] he comes back
[1:23:55] what did eve turn down christ
[1:23:59] the word the original word
[1:24:03] the anointed word the word in that day
[1:24:07] the original word in the original form
[1:24:11] before any pollution or hybridization
[1:24:14] it said he said my word is spirit see
[1:24:18] anointed with the word what eve turned
[1:24:19] down
[1:24:20] he does not say it comes back
[1:24:23] he said he comes back
[1:24:27] and we accept it he has come back
[1:24:32] and we've accepted it it couldn't be
[1:24:36] accepted until this day because it
[1:24:37] couldn't be unfolded in his fullness
[1:24:38] till this day
[1:24:40] but when it's unfolded in its fullness
[1:24:42] god knew you would be here to accept it
[1:24:45] and by accepting that the washing of the
[1:24:47] water of the word the blood of jesus
[1:24:49] christ all the power that was in calvary
[1:24:51] is now made effect in a living bride
[1:24:54] standing at the end time
[1:24:55] and she's declared sinless spotless
[1:24:58] virtues bride of jesus christ
[1:24:59] not because she never makes a mistake
[1:25:01] not because she doesn't still have a
[1:25:02] temper sometimes
[1:25:03] not because she doesn't stress the truth
[1:25:05] but because she's accepted him
[1:25:06] he's come back and she accepted it
[1:25:13] see how that hybrid condition again just
[1:25:15] exactly what he'd done eve
[1:25:16] he told eve don't you do this don't you
[1:25:18] do that and you can do this and that and
[1:25:20] satan said oh you know
[1:25:22] and she turned around and listened to
[1:25:23] him but the even the last day
[1:25:26] is not going to do it because she's
[1:25:28] predestinated
[1:25:29] not to do it yes sir god's going to do
[1:25:32] it he knows
[1:25:33] he'll have it he said it church would be
[1:25:35] here without spot or wrinkle
[1:25:37] she's going to stand there in the
[1:25:39] splendor of him
[1:25:41] his word made manifest
[1:25:46] if he predestinated a bridegroom
[1:25:50] he's predestinated a bride
[1:25:53] and the two have come together
[1:25:56] to do what to restore back to eden
[1:26:04] i'd like to close by quoting the
[1:26:05] scripture colossians 1
[1:26:07] 26 even the mystery which had been hid
[1:26:11] from the ages and from generations
[1:26:13] but is now made manifest to his saints
[1:26:16] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:26:18] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:26:19] among the gentiles
[1:26:21] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:26:26] we've quoted that scripture 20 30
[1:26:29] 40 50 years but it's becoming more of a
[1:26:31] reality every day
[1:26:34] more of my life more of my identity more
[1:26:36] of who i am
[1:26:37] it is setting the stage for who i really
[1:26:39] am and it's bringing me
[1:26:40] out of amnesia back to my original
[1:26:42] condition
[1:26:44] i hope it's doing the same for you
[1:26:47] he did in such a way he guaranteed
[1:26:50] results
[1:26:51] because now it's not going to be a man
[1:26:54] standing behind a lutheran doctrine for
[1:26:56] protection or standing behind a
[1:26:57] pentecostal doctrine for protection
[1:26:59] amen are trying to keep commandments and
[1:27:01] stay behind no
[1:27:02] he made sure that you're not going to
[1:27:04] stand behind anything amen
[1:27:06] but the thing that was protecting them
[1:27:08] you've become
[1:27:09] the thing that was keeping satan from
[1:27:11] these children you have become
[1:27:13] that thing that was the wall
[1:27:17] impenetrable unchangeable undefeatable
[1:27:20] word of god made manifest in this day
[1:27:24] not because you earned it not because
[1:27:26] you're good not because you look nice
[1:27:28] done nice acting nice but because he
[1:27:30] predestinated before the foundation
[1:27:32] of the world and he's got a solution for
[1:27:34] the hybrid condition we were born in
[1:27:36] and he's not looking at that because
[1:27:38] that life is put away in the sea of
[1:27:39] forgetfulness
[1:27:40] never to be remembered no more and he
[1:27:42] sees you as he always intended for you
[1:27:44] to be
[1:27:47] that's how a prophet of god can look at
[1:27:49] a people with problems and faults and
[1:27:51] complexes
[1:27:52] in all kinds of marriage situations said
[1:27:54] you're the sinless
[1:27:55] spotless bride of jesus christ
[1:28:00] why because you're justified by faith
[1:28:04] justified what is justified just as if
[1:28:06] you've never done it just by faith
[1:28:08] faith in what faith in the full measure
[1:28:11] of the word that's been restored in this
[1:28:12] day bringing me back to a full
[1:28:14] revelation
[1:28:15] of justification praise be to god
[1:28:18] friends
[1:28:19] that should do something to us that
[1:28:21] should release us
[1:28:22] free us and from the bondage of trying
[1:28:24] and failing and hybridization and
[1:28:26] confusion in our mind it should free us
[1:28:28] to say god whatever you intended me to
[1:28:30] be is what i want to be
[1:28:32] god i'm yielding i'm giving myself i'm
[1:28:34] relaxing i'm all yours
[1:28:36] do with me what you want i'm not going
[1:28:38] to try i'm not going to press i'm not
[1:28:39] going to push
[1:28:40] i'm just going to submit and let you do
[1:28:42] what you always intended to do
[1:28:46] because i'm not going to fail i'm not
[1:28:47] afraid of failing satan's not going to
[1:28:49] slip around behind the word and get me
[1:28:51] and i'm not going to step out from
[1:28:52] around it
[1:28:53] but because i've taken him i've become
[1:28:55] him
[1:28:56] and he is the word and now that is the
[1:28:58] wall
[1:28:59] [Music]
[1:29:02] i'm not afraid not in jeopardy
[1:29:07] i'm not in jeopardy i'm not on trial
[1:29:11] i've passed from death into life there
[1:29:13] is now no condemnation
[1:29:15] to them that are in christ jesus in the
[1:29:17] wall
[1:29:20] those scriptures have got to become a
[1:29:22] living reality
[1:29:24] no more fear no more manipulation
[1:29:29] from churches and systems and dogmas no
[1:29:32] more manipulation
[1:29:33] no more fear mongering amen you've
[1:29:36] you've been declared
[1:29:37] by a prophet in this age that if you're
[1:29:40] standing on the word and standing with
[1:29:42] the word and believe every jot and every
[1:29:43] title
[1:29:44] where are you standing you're standing
[1:29:46] justified back in your original
[1:29:48] condition
[1:29:48] in the mind of god what he intended for
[1:29:50] you to be and there's nothing for you to
[1:29:52] fear
[1:29:55] praise be to god the question is can we
[1:29:57] have mary's faith
[1:30:00] can he say something that he's never
[1:30:03] said before
[1:30:05] can he do something that he's never done
[1:30:07] before
[1:30:09] can he make a declaration on the earth
[1:30:11] that's never happened you're going to
[1:30:12] conceive a child knowing no man
[1:30:14] it's going to be the fulfillment of the
[1:30:15] word it's never been it's never been
[1:30:18] done
[1:30:18] amen it's never been said to a to a
[1:30:20] human before
[1:30:23] and how how is it going to happen what's
[1:30:26] going to be the holy ghost
[1:30:29] the thing in you is going to be formed
[1:30:30] of the holy ghost and she's going to say
[1:30:32] amen be it unto me according to the word
[1:30:35] amen
[1:30:36] he's saying something that's not been
[1:30:37] said to the church jesus never been said
[1:30:39] before
[1:30:40] amen he's saying it now in the end time

[1:31:45] this earth
[1:31:46] religion has bound people for thousands
[1:31:48] of years man's ideas put men in bondage
[1:31:51] and when jesus christ came they kept
[1:31:53] trying to put him in bondage by their
[1:31:55] law
[1:31:55] by their laws he was the word and he
[1:31:58] came to bring freedom and liberation
[1:32:00] and they kept saying your disciples ate
[1:32:02] with unwashed hands they picked corn on
[1:32:04] the sabbath
[1:32:04] they did this and they did that and
[1:32:06] they're trying to bring the word
[1:32:08] back into their bondage but jesus christ
[1:32:10] was there to free them from the bondage
[1:32:16] and then he goes to the gentiles and
[1:32:17] they do the same thing we repeat the
[1:32:18] same pattern
[1:32:19] by their traditions make the gospel of
[1:32:21] no effect and take the word and filter
[1:32:23] it through human reasoning
[1:32:24] and bring the people back into bondage
[1:32:26] of a religion

[1:32:29] it's got to come a certain way you got
[1:32:31] to go to a certain church you got to
[1:32:32] believe a certain set of doctrines

[1:32:34] and if you don't act right you got to go
[1:32:36] back

[1:32:40] christ has come just like he did then
[1:32:43] he's come
[1:32:44] and we accept it and what has he come to
