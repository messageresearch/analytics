[0:00] calling jesus on the scene he says we
[0:02] need a book of acts again
[0:04] but the only way you'll do it is to get
[0:06] back to the bible
[0:10] how many wants a book of acts
[0:13] how many wants manifestations and gifts
[0:16] and a book of acts
[0:19] he says the only way you'll produce that
[0:21] is if you get back to the bible if you
[0:23] get back to the word
[0:25] see i fear sometimes that we're seeking
[0:28] things that are not evil that are not
[0:29] sinful they're actually of god and
[0:31] worthy of seeking
[0:34] but we're seeking the wrong thing in the
[0:36] wrong way
[0:38] we're seeking to produce something
[0:40] ourselves we're seeking a manifestation
[0:42] to produce within ourself instead of
[0:44] seeking the word and allowing it to
[0:47] produce something so we're trying to get
[0:49] the cart before the horse
[0:53] he says get back to the bible and away
[0:56] from some of this hybrid religion
[0:59] you're a christian because you are born
[1:02] in the spirit of christ and the word of
[1:04] god lives in you
[1:09] i fear that that definition of the book
[1:11] of acts
[1:12] would differ from some of the
[1:14] definitions of the book of acts that
[1:15] i've heard taught
[1:18] because he's saying you want to get back
[1:19] to a book of acts we need a book of acts
[1:22] and then he says you're a christian
[1:24] because you're born of the spirit of god
[1:26] and the word of god lives in you
[1:29] see there's lots of things that go on in
[1:31] the book of acts and a lot of them are
[1:33] very dynamic
[1:35] and don't think for a second that i
[1:37] don't want those
[1:40] i want them i want them all i want more
[1:42] of them
[1:43] but what i don't want is all of them and
[1:46] miss the word of god living in me
[1:52] that is the main point of the book of
[1:54] acts remember the book of acts is based
[1:57] upon what peter had to say when he came
[1:59] out of the upper room and what peter had
[2:01] to say is this word of god right here
[2:04] is what you're seeing right here this
[2:06] word of god that you see in job that's
[2:08] what you're seeing right here
[2:10] that's the book of acts now as that
[2:13] progressed there was multitudes of
[2:15] manifestations from that
[2:18] but if they ever deviated away from the
[2:20] point of being able to say this right
[2:22] here that you see
[2:24] is this right here
[2:26] they've missed the book of acts
