[0:00] when philip needed to get from one place
[0:02] to another to to call out a
[0:03] predestinated seed
[0:05] he could walk down there but when he was
[0:06] done he could vanish and disappear
[0:08] and show up hundreds of miles away why
[0:10] because that was the need for the hour
[0:12] amen in the manifested word for the hour
[0:14] will take care of itself
[0:18] we just need to stick in the vineyard
[0:21] stay with the word
[0:23] have confidence in what god has given us
[0:26] quit trying to figure things out
[0:29] we need to i say we need to
[0:34] stay off youtube unless you're watching
[0:37] sermons
[0:41] and stay in the word
[0:44] the hours that are spent chasing
[0:46] conspiracy theories
[0:51] the economy is failing they're going to
[0:53] take away paper money
[0:56] so what i said this one time
[1:00] so you figured out the illuminati's
[1:02] behind it all
[1:03] right what does that change
[1:09] did it change your life did it protect
[1:12] you or somehow you immune to what's
[1:13] happening next
[1:15] it means nothing i figured this plot and
[1:18] it's this one and
[1:19] it's that one it means nothing it
[1:21] changes nothing
[1:22] it gives you no power to overcome all it
[1:26] does is bring
[1:26] fear and tension and anxiety and now you
[1:29] know there's there's a secret society
[1:31] that's out to ruin everybody but you
[1:33] have no power to do a thing about it
[1:37] who cares
[1:41] but i know a secret that almost nobody
[1:44] else in the world knows
[1:45] and i didn't get it from an alternate
[1:47] news site i didn't get it from youtube
[1:49] i didn't get it from the dark web i tell
[1:51] you where i got this secret i got it
[1:53] from the message
[1:54] of the hour and that secret tells me
[1:56] that just when he's about to accomplish
[1:58] their cowardly plot
[1:59] amen he'll gather the wheat into the
[2:01] garner and that secret is what's keeping
[2:03] me friends
[2:04] i know a secret do you know a secret
[2:07] that's the only secret you need to know

[2:12] vineyard be

[2:16] us amen
