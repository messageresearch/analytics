[1:32] tonight and i wish
[1:34] i was sitting there but brother chad
[1:37] since he has a wedding coming up
[1:39] so i said thank but not thanks so
[1:44] all right so we're going to be
[1:47] musicians thank you we want to have a
[1:50] little
[1:50] just a little thought and little
[1:53] bible study a few verses we're going to
[1:55] read together and see how the lord would
[1:57] lead us
[1:58] into that and let's just go to
[2:01] the book of genesis
[2:05] the book of genesis chapter 3
[2:10] verse 22 324
[2:14] so excuse me my eyes sometimes are bad
[2:17] with
[2:19] you know i'm using here if it's flickers
[2:27] as we go read the word of god genesis
[2:32] chapter 3 verse 22 to
[2:36] 24 in heaven myself
[2:41] it says in the lord god
[2:44] said behold the man is become
[2:48] as one of us to know good and evil
[2:54] and now lest he put
[2:57] forth his hand and take also of the tree
[3:01] of life
[3:02] and eat and live forever
[3:05] therefore the lord god sent him forth
[3:08] from the garden of eden
[3:11] to till the ground from whence he was
[3:14] taken
[3:15] so he drove out the man and he placed
[3:20] at the east garden of eden
[3:23] cherubims and a flying sword which
[3:27] turned
[3:27] every way to keep the way of the tree of
[3:30] life
[3:33] it's about our heads and about a prayer
[3:37] precious loving father
[3:41] we are here lord as your
[3:44] children and father we have gathered
[3:48] with one motive
[3:50] that you will speak to us and father
[3:53] although tonight you might be
[3:55] using this vessel of clay
[3:59] father we depend upon you myself lord
[4:02] waiting to hear from you along with my
[4:05] brothers and sisters
[4:07] as we have read these words lord our
[4:10] little mouth can
[4:11] read it and with a literal knowledge we
[4:13] have of
[4:14] the vocabulary and reading the phrases
[4:16] and sentences
[4:18] but it takes the holy spirit to bring
[4:21] the breath of life to
[4:22] us and father we ask that you will bless
[4:25] this
[4:26] gathering how long it will take lord a
[4:28] few minutes or
[4:30] we depend upon you we just ask that you
[4:32] will come and
[4:33] nourish it and feed us in jesus christ
[4:36] then we pray
[4:37] you may be seated
[4:41] i told you my laptop is
[4:44] dying on me
[4:57] so after we read the scriptures
[5:01] in the book of genesis chapter 3 22 3
[5:05] 24 it's the saddest
[5:10] place to read when you start reading the
[5:13] book of genesis
[5:15] i remember i don't know how most of you
[5:17] grew up but some of
[5:19] some of the children here the grown-up
[5:21] have been in the message for a long time
[5:24] i had a catholic background so as i was
[5:28] becoming a teenager growing up and
[5:31] having the opportunity to read the word
[5:33] of god
[5:35] to find the bible because in the
[5:37] catholic church you don't have the bible
[5:40] you have catechisms there is a book
[5:43] written with mind of man
[5:45] and brother friend god might need if you
[5:47] need some help
[5:48] and as i was getting
[5:52] to come to the knowledge of what
[5:55] what is god who is he what is he doing
[5:58] just opening up the book of genesis
[6:01] i started reading how god was
[6:04] the creator how he created he could
[6:07] speak there was nothing to begin with
[6:10] everything from the beginning was void
[6:14] empty our mind could not even grasp
[6:17] what void means because there's no eye
[6:20] to see anything there
[6:22] there's no understanding no mind there
[6:24] but the mind of god just god himself
[6:27] and this just starting reading that
[6:30] beautiful story
[6:32] on how he was opening up
[6:37] speaking light into existing and he was
[6:40] able to see the light
[6:42] and he saw that he was good and that
[6:45] that gave
[6:46] me just another a joy to keep reading
[6:49] the word of god from genesis
[6:51] and you go on to how he after creating
[6:54] speaking the lights he would create the
[6:56] firmaments
[6:58] he would divide the waters he would dry
[7:00] the land
[7:01] and as he was going through those steps
[7:04] he was naming giving the names to those
[7:09] luminaries and lights and the lesser
[7:12] light the
[7:12] the bigger lights and as he was naming
[7:15] them he was positioning them
[7:17] and as you go through the reading how
[7:20] god is just
[7:20] bursting and just creating and setting
[7:23] everything in place from
[7:24] from nothing
[7:27] in going in and then coming to
[7:31] creating man
[7:36] giving man an opportunity created him in
[7:38] the in the
[7:40] the the first chapter
[7:44] we saw that the prophet of god said that
[7:45] when he created man man was just
[7:48] man was it let's let's go to that
[7:51] uh genesis one yes
[7:54] uh pray for me my my laptop is
[7:58] is bothering me it's getting me nervous
[8:01] and then in genesis 1 26 god he goes
[8:05] and god said let us man in let us
[8:08] make man in our image after our
[8:12] likeness and let them have dominion over
[8:15] the fish
[8:16] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[8:19] and over the cattle and over all the
[8:21] earth and over the
[8:22] ever creeping thing that creepeth upon
[8:24] the earth
[8:26] in 27 he goes so god created man in his
[8:29] own
[8:29] image in the image of god created he
[8:32] male and female created he
[8:36] them in 28 in 28 god is giving
[8:40] them a commission
[8:44] god is giving them a commission he
[8:47] first he blesses them and god said unto
[8:50] them be fruitful and multiply and
[8:52] replenish the earth
[8:53] and subdue it and have the dominion over
[8:56] the fish of the sea
[8:58] and over the fall of the air and over
[9:00] every
[9:01] living thing that moveth upon the earth
[9:05] and after reading as i was just coming
[9:07] to
[9:08] the reading of this beautiful book about
[9:11] god
[9:11] and how he started creating
[9:14] the universe creating the heaven the
[9:17] earth and
[9:18] the trees and the fruits and the the the
[9:21] birds and
[9:22] so reading that from genesis 1 and then
[9:26] we come into genesis
[9:27] 2 finding that after creating men in
[9:31] genesis 1
[9:32] just in genesis 2 we're finding that
[9:34] there was no man to tilt the ground
[9:37] he said but he just created men in
[9:39] genesis 1.
[9:41] and the prophet of god said
[9:45] say that the man was created in genesis
[9:48] 1
[9:48] was the spiritual spirit man
[9:52] he could not tell the ground he was a
[9:55] spirit man that could not die they could
[9:57] not
[9:57] they could not fall so he was
[10:00] commissioned to lead the earth
[10:02] to be a lesser god on earth and for that
[10:06] god had to put him into a body closer to
[10:10] the the kingdoms that he was overseeing
[10:14] and after reading that you were reading
[10:16] that okay man is
[10:18] now being formed by god he's being put
[10:21] on earth
[10:22] now god is waiting for men to as the
[10:25] bible says that
[10:26] he has he did not have his uh the help
[10:30] meet
[10:31] his wife and as the story was unfolding
[10:34] that okay god reformed
[10:36] now he took a rib out of man he is now
[10:39] bringing to adam and the saddest of the
[10:42] story
[10:42] starts in genesis chapter 3 1.
[10:47] i wish when i read that since i was a
[10:50] kid
[10:51] i said why would this happen just so
[10:54] soon
[10:56] the god i know that god is almighty god
[10:59] is full of love
[11:00] i just read the entire book of genesis
[11:02] just a chapter 1
[11:04] and chapter 2. now the saddest of
[11:07] all stories starts in genesis 3 1.
[11:12] it bothered me as uh as i was growing up
[11:15] in my teens and growing up into even my
[11:18] 20s
[11:19] before coming to this message
[11:22] said why why would god how how could
[11:25] this happen so genesis
[11:28] if genesis 3 1 did not
[11:32] occur probably the remaining of the
[11:35] bible would not have
[11:36] would have been written differently or
[11:38] maybe the bible would have stopped in
[11:40] just genesis 1 and
[11:42] genesis 2. but as i was asking myself
[11:45] those questions i said how would could
[11:47] this
[11:48] almighty god this whole loving god
[11:55] leaves such something as this in the
[11:58] bible
[11:59] is this to happen to his creation
[12:04] and i said not only if you go into
[12:14] i cannot use my uh my my laptop anymore
[12:18] just keep praying for me yeah he praying
[12:21] for me it's uh
[12:22] so it's it's it's like you you have a
[12:25] book
[12:26] you are reading a book and then the book
[12:28] is
[12:29] telling you the good stories and when
[12:32] you come to the anticipation that
[12:34] the story is about to to start
[12:37] they don't tell you that hey find
[12:39] another book find the
[12:40] the volume too so it it
[12:44] it bothered me a lot and and not only
[12:47] that
[12:48] if we go so not only that let me use
[12:53] just my notes here
[12:55] so god who was almighty why didn't he
[12:58] stop the serpent
[13:02] i said why didn't he stop the serpent
[13:06] how could why didn't kevin prevent all
[13:08] those things because he was so mighty
[13:12] why he was so loving and then
[13:15] even sending them nicely out of the
[13:17] garden of eden
[13:19] he's not even doing that he sent them
[13:21] out
[13:22] and he's driving them out driving them
[13:26] out
[13:27] and even placing cherubims these are
[13:31] mighty angels trained angel to protect
[13:34] the tree of life
[13:35] so giving no room no way for men ever to
[13:39] come back to him
[13:47] as i'm still going here so fighting with
[13:49] my
[13:50] uh my my laptop
[13:53] laptop and not only
[13:57] only sending driving them out
[14:02] putting cherubims there he didn't only
[14:05] stop
[14:06] there he's even putting a flaming a
[14:09] flaming sword
[14:10] to keep from the way the tree of life
[14:14] from his only presence and if you go in
[14:16] the book of exodus
[14:17] you know that when god asked moses
[14:20] to to mimic from from the vision he gave
[14:24] him of the tabernacle where he wanted to
[14:26] come and dwell among them to
[14:28] to to commune with them so remember that
[14:31] he asked them he asked moses to have an
[14:34] ark and on top of the ark of the
[14:36] covenant
[14:37] he would he would put the mercy seat
[14:40] and then those cherubims would have
[14:42] those wings and covering the mercy
[14:44] seat which and then god said that
[14:47] when he would come he would be above the
[14:49] mercy seat
[14:50] meaning that those cherubims not only
[14:53] were keeping the way of the tree of life
[14:55] from the tree of life
[14:56] they were keeping men from the very
[14:58] presence of god
[15:01] and it i could not reconcile
[15:05] this almighty god
[15:08] in this loving god letting his children
[15:12] go through that way it was for four
[15:15] years it was a shock
[15:16] after he left the catholic church it was
[15:18] a shock i said
[15:20] how could this happen how would this god
[15:22] how would i know this
[15:24] and then the message come our way
[15:28] and when the message came away
[15:31] my way so the prophet of god says that
[15:35] just coming back to what i was referring
[15:38] earlier
[15:40] he said before this in the resurrection
[15:43] of
[15:43] lazarus 53 so i might back up some of
[15:45] the things since my laptop is
[15:47] kind of acting good now he said before
[15:50] he was this man
[15:51] he was a spirit man so the man of
[15:54] genesis 1 27
[15:56] 28 before this he was this man he was a
[16:00] spirit man
[16:02] god made the first man in his own image
[16:05] how many how many says that's right
[16:09] well what kind of image has god got
[16:13] he is a spirit is that right
[16:17] and we say right so he made a spirit
[16:21] man before he made a flesh man
[16:24] so that that makes me understood now
[16:28] okay from genesis 1 it's the spirit man
[16:31] in genesis 2 is the man that was in
[16:34] flesh
[16:34] then he put five senses to contact his
[16:38] earthly
[16:39] earthly home and we know that
[16:43] god now commissioned men in in genesis
[16:46] chapter two if you have that we can
[16:47] go along said little study here
[16:51] chapter 2
[17:02] 15.
[17:04] keep praying for me that's this laptop
[17:06] made me
[17:07] so nervous just the enemy
[17:11] but but we're here to hear from him
[17:15] amen and 15 said and the lord god took
[17:17] the man
[17:18] and put him into the garden of eden to
[17:21] dress it and to keep it
[17:23] so we hear that there is a commissioning
[17:25] there there's a commission there that
[17:27] god is giving to man the man he created
[17:29] now he couldn't find a man to take the
[17:32] ground he formed this man
[17:34] now he's commissioning man to keep to
[17:37] dress
[17:37] and to keep the garden 16 and the lord
[17:41] god commanded the men
[17:42] saying of every tree of the garden
[17:45] thou may may freely eat
[17:48] now in here the prophet of god it says
[17:50] that this is
[17:52] the beginning of the law he said this
[17:56] was the law
[17:57] and you will see what the law can
[17:59] produce the law can only produce death
[18:02] but as we proceed he said but one of the
[18:05] true seventeen
[18:07] one of the tree of the knowledge of good
[18:08] and evil
[18:10] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[18:12] and evil thou shalt not eat
[18:15] or shall not eat of it for in the day
[18:18] that thou
[18:19] eateth thereof thou shall surely die
[18:22] and the lord god said it is not good
[18:26] that the man
[18:26] should be alone i will make him a help
[18:29] myth
[18:30] there was a promise there given to man
[18:33] and then in 19 and out of the ground the
[18:37] lord god formed every beast of the field
[18:40] and every fowl of the air and brought
[18:42] them on to adam to see
[18:44] what he would call them and whatsoever
[18:47] adam called
[18:48] every living creature that was the name
[18:50] of
[18:51] so we see here the harmony between the
[18:54] lesser god
[18:56] and the great god the great god is
[18:58] asking adam
[19:00] to name the animals and adam is doing
[19:03] exactly the way
[19:04] the greater god gave him but if you read
[19:08] the 20
[19:09] 20 said and adam gave names to
[19:12] all cattle's cattle into the fall of the
[19:16] air
[19:17] into every beast of
[19:20] of the field but adam for adam that was
[19:23] not
[19:24] found and helped meet for him seems like
[19:26] there was
[19:28] an ask from god
[19:31] in all in an open test
[19:35] test to see because god wanted to see
[19:37] how he would name them
[19:38] but in the in the same time there was a
[19:41] an unveiled or covered a a
[19:45] veiled or covered test if from
[19:48] those cattle beasts
[19:52] adam would find a helmet because in
[19:56] twenty he's
[19:57] read it again and adam gave names
[20:00] to all cattle into the fowl of the air
[20:03] and to every beast of the field
[20:07] but for adam there was not found
[20:11] and helped me for him did he mean that
[20:14] adam was to search first
[20:17] and see if we would find something
[20:20] someone similar to him
[20:24] something hid there so there was a test
[20:27] but adam passed the test because
[20:31] adam as we heard last sunday
[20:34] did not rely on his five senses
[20:37] if he would have relied on his five
[20:39] senses
[20:40] there were a couple among those
[20:44] animals very very close to him
[20:50] very very close to him and the prophet
[20:52] god
[20:53] goes and tells us that just remember
[21:01] just remember the bible said the prophet
[21:04] declared that
[21:06] this is about the serpent seed he said
[21:09] now let's watch this a minute he's he's
[21:12] describing the serpent
[21:14] he's smart crafty
[21:18] yet he is called the serpent but
[21:20] remember he was the smartest thing
[21:23] there was and the more like the human
[21:26] being than
[21:27] anything else that was on the field
[21:31] closest to a human being
[21:34] he was not a reptile the curse made him
[21:38] a reptile and he was the bible said he
[21:41] was the most
[21:42] beautiful of all now the prophet is
[21:45] talking about the male now
[21:48] mr serpent he's calling him mr serpent
[21:52] so mr serpent was the most beautiful how
[21:55] about the mrs sir miss serpent
[21:58] she was there too because when
[22:02] adam was naming them let's just just put
[22:05] that
[22:06] those animals could be all over the
[22:08] place in the garden of eden
[22:09] maybe one would have been in crydosville
[22:12] maybe miss serpent and quite as well
[22:14] miss the serpent maybe
[22:15] bill fountain now as adam was calling
[22:18] them was bringing them together he would
[22:20] say
[22:21] you your speech is there you are of that
[22:24] specie you or miss
[22:26] serpent you are missing putting them
[22:30] together it seems like he
[22:31] it seems like he was marrying them
[22:34] because himself he couldn't find
[22:36] a health meet in whatever pertains is
[22:40] applied to
[22:40] mr serpent is also applied to miss
[22:44] serpent she must have been beautiful
[22:47] crafty and even the curse didn't take
[22:51] all his beauty away
[22:53] yet the glorious colors of the snake is
[22:55] beautiful
[22:57] and his grace and his sureness
[23:00] now this is not the grace of god
[23:03] the prophet of god is saying and his
[23:06] grace the serpent's
[23:07] grace and his sureness
[23:10] even the curse did not move it off but
[23:13] you remember
[23:14] god told him that his legs would come
[23:17] off
[23:18] and he'd he would go on his belly and
[23:20] you can't find one bone
[23:22] in a snake that looks like a human being
[23:25] and that's the reason
[23:26] science lost it but there it is
[23:30] but before we continue that the grace
[23:33] means
[23:35] commonly it refers to a smooth
[23:38] and pleasing way of moving
[23:41] this is what the word grace means
[23:45] because we know it is unfavorable
[23:48] unmerited favor
[23:49] that's the religious reminder the
[23:51] religious way of what grace mean
[23:53] but grace you that the prophet is
[23:55] referring to is
[23:57] the smoothness and the pleasing way of
[24:00] moving
[24:02] or a polite and thoughtful way of
[24:05] behaving
[24:07] the serpent was a very polite
[24:12] very smooth pleasing now if this is a
[24:16] this applies to mr serpent he must have
[24:19] applied
[24:20] applied also to mrs serpent insuredness
[24:24] as you know what english is your
[24:26] language means the quality of
[24:29] having or showing good powers of
[24:32] judgment
[24:33] now this beast was the closest to man
[24:38] they could have a good power
[24:41] of judgment so meaning the test of
[24:46] adam was not just an easy test of naming
[24:49] animals
[24:50] even to see if mrs serpent could
[24:54] could could convince him but
[24:57] he didn't rely on this five senses
[25:00] that's what
[25:01] when the supersense kicked in he knew
[25:04] that this is not of my race
[25:06] and the prophet of god says that god hid
[25:09] it from the eyes of the boys and
[25:10] prudents
[25:11] and promised to reveal it to the sons of
[25:14] god
[25:15] in the last days so if this
[25:18] is revealed to us we're living in the
[25:21] last days
[25:23] when the sons of god would be made
[25:26] manifest
[25:28] when god's a son that rejoiced with him
[25:30] before the foundation of the world
[25:33] when the great revelation of the godhead
[25:36] and things
[25:36] would be brought down in the last days
[25:39] this
[25:40] is the day we're living in the greatest
[25:42] day that
[25:43] when god's sons are rejoiced with him
[25:46] before the foundation of the world
[25:49] when this great revelation of godhead or
[25:51] all things would be brought down in this
[25:54] last day
[25:55] he said he would manifest these things
[25:57] to the sons of god
[26:00] that's the reason he's manifesting it to
[26:02] us he said that's the reason that god is
[26:04] opening these things to us god is
[26:07] bringing his sons
[26:09] into manifestation
[26:13] then reading the first the first part of
[26:16] the the
[26:17] of the book of genesis seeing how from
[26:21] the great creation the majestic and
[26:24] creations of god and how he was speaking
[26:27] creating and then men come into
[26:29] existence and
[26:30] seeing that the enemy came and marred
[26:34] this couple in the garden of eden
[26:38] i thought it was the end of it i said
[26:39] why would god let
[26:41] let this just happen and stop all the
[26:43] anticipations
[26:46] but let's read in the book of
[26:49] genesis chapter 12
[27:00] just a little bible study tonight and
[27:03] god will
[27:04] speak to us genesis 12 just
[27:07] two verses there and then we'll go to 15
[27:11] 12 1-2 now the lord had
[27:15] said unto abram get thee out of thy
[27:18] country and from thy kindred
[27:21] and from thy father's house unto a land
[27:24] that i will
[27:25] show thee and i will make thee
[27:29] a great nation and i will bless thee
[27:32] and make thy name great and thou shalt
[27:35] be
[27:36] a blessing and even the little uh
[27:39] thought a title of our thought tonight
[27:41] is um
[27:44] thou art a blessing and i am that shield
[27:48] let's go to genesis
[27:51] 15 1 through
[27:55] 7 or 8.
[27:59] and this will make more sense as we read
[28:01] it
[28:04] we know that after reading chapter 1
[28:06] chapter 2 of genesis
[28:09] all anticipations were up reading
[28:12] chapter 3 verse 1
[28:15] the saddest story ever started there
[28:20] and then god is bringing coming back now
[28:22] in genesis 12
[28:23] giving a promise to abraham calling him
[28:26] in
[28:27] 5 15 after these things
[28:31] the word of the lord came unto abraham
[28:34] in a vision
[28:35] saying fear not abraham i am thy shield
[28:39] and thy exceeding great reward
[28:43] and abram said lord god
[28:47] what will thou give me seeing i go
[28:50] childish
[28:52] childless childless and
[28:55] the steward of my house is this eliezer
[28:58] of damascus
[29:01] and abraham said abram said behold to me
[29:05] thou has given no seed and lo one born
[29:08] in my house
[29:09] is mine heir and behold the word of the
[29:12] lord came unto him saying
[29:14] this shall not be thine air but he shall
[29:18] he that shall come forth out of thine
[29:21] own bowels shall be
[29:22] thine air and he brought him forth
[29:25] abroad and said
[29:26] look now towards heaven and tell the
[29:29] tell the stars if thou be able to number
[29:32] them i'm pretty sure he saw the stars
[29:34] sitting here in lima today
[29:43] and he said unto him so shall thy seed
[29:45] be
[29:46] and he believed let's let's not read
[29:50] that over again
[29:50] and he believed in the lord and he
[29:53] counted to him
[29:54] for righteousness and he said unto him
[29:58] i am the lord that brought thee out of
[30:00] error
[30:01] of the chaldees to give thee
[30:04] this land to inherit it so we see
[30:08] god shifting now after man
[30:13] has fallen man that was created
[30:19] to take care to lead the earth
[30:23] with his bride they fell
[30:30] was that the end of the story no we're
[30:33] going to be seeing how god
[30:35] is going to be rebuilding the same man
[30:38] to bring him back to eden again
[30:42] and the prophet of god said this this is
[30:44] in the identified
[30:45] a masterpiece the prophet of god said
[30:49] see the love of god because when i
[30:52] read chapter one in chapter two seeing
[30:55] the great things he was doing and then
[30:57] the
[30:57] enemy came to cut short his work
[31:01] i wandered and said
[31:07] almighty how his might could not have
[31:10] stopped this enemy
[31:12] how his love could not even for have
[31:14] forgiven or
[31:15] protected his children but god was so
[31:19] loving that he had a plan
[31:21] for me and you and the prophet of god is
[31:24] bringing this plane he said
[31:25] see the love of god after man had fallen
[31:28] and deliberately opened the door to the
[31:31] enemy
[31:33] and he had come in and marred him and
[31:36] set
[31:36] death in him still god was not willing
[31:39] to be defeated
[31:43] he came down and started all over again
[31:47] so god is again what seemed to have been
[31:51] fallen in the book of genesis one and
[31:54] two
[31:55] god is rebuilding he's determined and
[31:58] the prophet of god says
[31:59] he was going to make that man again
[32:04] that gave me hope said he put adam on in
[32:08] a covenant if when we read in
[32:10] chapter 2 you remember he put adam
[32:14] on a covenant do this and not this
[32:19] this and not that touch not handle not
[32:22] taste not but we find out when he
[32:24] started again
[32:26] he started with abraham
[32:29] and in abraham he started him on an
[32:32] unconditional covenant
[32:36] the first man adam was given a law to
[32:39] live by
[32:41] do not touch that touch not
[32:44] but the second man god is rebuilding
[32:52] he's starting him on an unconditional
[32:54] covenant
[32:55] not if you will i have already done it
[32:59] i've blessed you and you you and your
[33:03] seed and so forth after you
[33:05] it was an unconditional covenant that he
[33:08] started with abraham
[33:11] and the reason he starting with abraham
[33:14] giving him
[33:14] an unconditional covenant is because god
[33:17] found that
[33:18] man cannot keep a covenant
[33:21] you and i we cannot keep a covenant
[33:26] he takes god himself to keep his own
[33:28] covenant
[33:29] and when he called abraham just think
[33:31] about abraham like you and me
[33:33] maybe maybe a farmer a hunter
[33:37] when he called him what he expected and
[33:40] wanted from abram
[33:41] was for abraham only to believe
[33:46] and he gave him that opportunity that
[33:49] that that ability to believe him
[33:52] because he was not going to force him
[33:54] and by simply
[33:56] believing what he called him he called
[33:59] him for
[34:00] the rest was upon god
[34:04] he was determined as we believe his word
[34:08] the remaining of what he will do with
[34:10] this bride
[34:11] that's god's determination he will
[34:14] accomplish it without your
[34:16] input and my input
[34:20] in the same uh quotes we're going to
[34:22] have a
[34:23] couple of quotes here and there and in
[34:25] scriptures
[34:27] in the masterpiece now we find that the
[34:30] entire dilution world come along and
[34:33] destroy the whole thing
[34:35] because the covenants that was made was
[34:38] made conditionally if you will not do
[34:41] this
[34:42] or if you will do that god the great
[34:44] sculptor
[34:45] seemed that men could not keep a
[34:47] covenant
[34:49] he just can't do it there's just no way
[34:54] and then bro the prophet of god is
[34:56] sneaking in something
[34:58] and i'm leaving it this inside when i
[35:01] read it it's applying to
[35:03] probably some of us here but it's
[35:05] applying it to me first
[35:06] and he said on an interview a few months
[35:09] ago
[35:09] a few moments ago i was speaking to a
[35:12] person in the room
[35:14] that's present now said but brother
[35:17] branham
[35:18] i have so many things that i know that's
[35:20] wrong
[35:22] and a godly little woman
[35:27] i think the same about myself and i know
[35:31] some of us here think about themselves
[35:32] the same way
[35:34] that brother rehm i have so many things
[35:38] that i know that's wrong
[35:41] in a godly little woman i said but look
[35:44] sister
[35:45] you don't look at yourself it's just
[35:49] what you desire
[35:51] what your desire is and what you try to
[35:54] do
[35:55] and if you really love the lord you try
[35:57] to serve him with all your heart
[36:00] and all your mistakes is hid in the
[36:03] blood of the lord
[36:05] see he made a way
[36:08] and remember in the book of genesis 3 24
[36:12] there was no way back they were driven
[36:15] out driven out the cherubims were there
[36:18] the flaming sword was there but we see
[36:21] that god is going to me
[36:22] making a way to go back to to
[36:26] to the garden of eden the prophet of god
[36:30] continues
[36:30] so he begin now taking men from his
[36:33] covenants
[36:34] of saying that if you will and he begin
[36:38] with the man
[36:38] called abraham and gave to abraham a
[36:42] covenant unconditionally
[36:44] every time he would start a massacre
[36:47] peace
[36:48] satan would get it but when he started
[36:51] with
[36:51] abraham he said i have already done it
[36:55] now this is unconditionally not that you
[36:58] will i will but i've already done it
[37:01] now this sculptor which is god himself
[37:06] is determined to have his masterpiece
[37:10] if god is determined to have his
[37:13] masterpiece
[37:14] who's going to stand against it now god
[37:16] is going to be showing
[37:18] to the devil to the enemy that the first
[37:21] one
[37:22] you marred it but this second one you
[37:25] were not
[37:25] married and the prophet of god is going
[37:28] to be telling us how he's going to be
[37:30] building rebuilding this mass of peace
[37:33] that was fallen
[37:35] he said he was going to be calling
[37:37] abraham starting with
[37:39] faith after abram he has isaac
[37:42] with love after love he has jacob
[37:46] with grace after grace he says joseph
[37:49] joseph is the perfection so he's going
[37:51] to be first
[37:53] rebuilding the foundation
[37:56] to put this masterpiece on and he said
[37:59] the masterpiece
[38:00] the bodywork the masterpiece had two
[38:02] portions
[38:03] if you remember the first portion was
[38:06] the foundation
[38:08] which had faith love grace
[38:11] and perfection all of them of god the
[38:14] faith of god not my faith
[38:16] not the faith of abraham the love of god
[38:20] the grace of god the perfection of god
[38:23] not your perfection
[38:25] and then the body work was to be
[38:28] by the prophets which are the word
[38:32] so this the re the man that god is
[38:35] rebuilding
[38:36] was to be the word himself as we know
[38:39] that the first
[38:40] couple was kept behind the word
[38:44] and when they just moved a bit satan
[38:47] found a way to to go back in
[38:49] to destroy them but this last
[38:52] this last masterpiece will be the word
[38:55] himself
[38:57] so the prophet of god says
[39:00] in abraham was the foundation of faith
[39:03] now watch
[39:03] every masterpiece is put on a foundation
[39:08] angelo's monument of moses is on a three
[39:11] or four foot piece of marble
[39:15] it's got a foundation so god in
[39:17] preparing this masterpiece
[39:19] he put it on a foundation of the
[39:21] patriarchs
[39:23] in the patriarchs foundation first we
[39:25] have abraham
[39:27] isaac jacob and joseph
[39:30] the four corners and now abram was the
[39:34] foundation of faith
[39:36] the foundation laid we have as he goes
[39:38] again
[39:40] and he said the work the body work
[39:43] to defeat this enemy was to be
[39:46] the eyes of the prophet meaning the body
[39:50] word
[39:50] the body work of this masterpiece of
[39:53] this
[39:54] man that he was rebuilding rebuilding
[39:56] the man of genesis 2
[39:58] was to be on the foundation and built
[40:02] with the word himself
[40:09] in the book of ephesians churchill he
[40:11] said to him that overcometh
[40:14] and this is in revelation 7
[40:17] let's read revelation 7 first
[40:20] revelation 2 7 sorry
[40:40] 2 7 he said he that hath an ear
[40:44] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[40:46] the churches
[40:48] to him that overcometh will i give to
[40:51] eat
[40:52] of the tree of life which is in the
[40:54] midst of
[40:55] of the paradise of god meaning that
[41:00] the way to the tree of life that was
[41:03] blocked from men to go to return
[41:07] back to now that way
[41:10] is going to be open and given to the
[41:13] overcomers
[41:15] and the prophet of god said that what a
[41:17] thrilling
[41:18] thought this is that tree of life in the
[41:22] garden of eden
[41:24] which could not be approached unto
[41:26] because of
[41:27] the fall of adam is now given to
[41:30] overcomers the flaming sword of the
[41:34] guardian
[41:35] guarding cherubims has been sheathed
[41:40] but it was not sheathed here air
[41:43] its blade was bloody
[41:46] with the blood of the lamb let us
[41:49] meditate upon this truth a world
[41:51] as we consider why the tree was denied
[41:54] to
[41:54] adam and his descendants but
[41:58] now aloud again to you and me
[42:05] he goes again the foundation was laid by
[42:07] the patriarch
[42:09] but the body was built by the word
[42:13] which was the prophets and here comes
[42:16] the head of it
[42:17] jesus came on the scene there when this
[42:20] head piece was put on it we find in him
[42:23] the entire handiwork of god
[42:27] we find in him the perfect reflection of
[42:30] the word
[42:31] he was the word the fullness of the word
[42:34] now again god has the perfect
[42:37] masterpiece again
[42:38] as isaiah said behold my servant my
[42:42] masterpiece
[42:43] i have portrayed through all the ages of
[42:46] this perfect coming one
[42:51] so coming back to the man that was
[42:54] in the genesis 2 that man
[42:57] when he fell there was no way back
[43:03] probably all the generation thought that
[43:05] there was no way to go back to the tree
[43:07] of life
[43:07] no way to go back to the presence of god
[43:10] not knowing that god had a plan
[43:12] that he would it would he would take 4
[43:15] 000 years
[43:18] to rebuild that man and he started with
[43:22] the foundations as we mentioned here
[43:25] faith and goes into love into grace into
[43:28] perfection and then the word comes
[43:30] and then we saw that word that man
[43:33] standing on earth
[43:35] after four thousand years of the fall of
[43:37] adam
[43:39] and from that man because the man that
[43:42] was in
[43:43] in the garden of eden was also
[43:46] smitten when god put adam to sleep
[43:51] to take a rib out of him and to form
[43:55] his bride the bride that fell
[43:59] the prophet of god goes that now we
[44:02] could go on
[44:04] go on and on with that but i believe you
[44:06] have the picture of what i mean now
[44:09] god building back his masterpiece
[44:12] let us not forget that in the beginning
[44:14] when he smote the side of adam
[44:17] he took something from his side now the
[44:21] smiling of
[44:22] christ was for a cause
[44:30] was for a cause
[44:34] that he might take from him want
[44:37] to be a family the bride
[44:41] so as the first adam
[44:44] was smitten to take a bride out of him
[44:48] this second adam was to be smitten on
[44:52] calvary
[44:53] that you and i can come can come forth
[44:57] so when his masterpiece was perfected
[45:00] then he had to smite it to take
[45:04] from him not another peace not another
[45:06] creation
[45:08] but of the very same creation
[45:11] my brother don't think bad at this but
[45:14] think a minute if he took from him
[45:18] the original creation to make the bride
[45:21] for him
[45:22] he's never made another creation he took
[45:25] a part of the original creation
[45:29] then if he was the word what must the
[45:32] bride be
[45:36] so the bride must be the original word
[45:39] the living god in the word now there's
[45:42] some qualifications for the masterpiece
[45:49] adam within the spirit of genesis 1 28
[45:53] 27-28 he was both male and female
[45:56] that was the adam the spirit man
[46:00] that man was perfect but that that man
[46:04] could not be masterpiece
[46:07] so to be a masterpiece it takes the
[46:10] perfection
[46:11] living in the clay your clay in my clay
[46:14] that's what jesus had to come and be
[46:17] born in a body like you and me to be
[46:20] that masterpiece
[46:22] that obeyed all the word of god
[46:27] and remember that man that was created
[46:29] in the image of god in genesis was the
[46:31] spirit man
[46:33] who both was both male and female that
[46:35] could not fall
[46:37] because the spirit cannot die but he
[46:40] takes
[46:41] the spirit living in the body of the
[46:45] human body in the clay
[46:47] to qualify for the masterpiece
[46:51] so you are here to be the masterpiece
[46:55] that masterpiece of
[46:57] jesus of christ on earth because his
[47:00] word is living within you and me
[47:07] and in the same same same method i've
[47:11] been uh
[47:12] showing in and i had something that i
[47:14] would have brought here but
[47:16] things shuffled last last night
[47:20] his life matched all the peoples it
[47:22] pleased god to
[47:24] smite him and now why did he smite him
[47:28] for the same cause he had to smite adam
[47:32] now we seem stricken smitten of god and
[47:36] afflicted
[47:37] the perfect lamb of god
[47:41] for sinner slain a perfect masterpiece
[47:44] it has taken him four thousand years to
[47:46] make this masterpiece
[47:48] now he's been for nearly two thousand
[47:51] years
[47:52] making another peace a bride for christ
[47:55] and other peace and that's you and me
[47:58] and what is the method he's been using
[48:00] to make another and
[48:01] a masterpiece he uses
[48:05] first the foundation with four corners
[48:10] and we see that the first the
[48:11] masterpiece the the rebuilt man of
[48:14] genesis 2 when he came
[48:15] living in flesh jesus christ the second
[48:18] adam the foundation was prepared by the
[48:21] patriarchs
[48:24] and then the body work was his own word
[48:28] prophets upon prophets this second
[48:31] masterpiece that is smith that is pulled
[48:34] out after he was smitten on calvary it
[48:37] has also four corners
[48:39] has the four gospels and also
[48:43] through the churches the prophet the
[48:45] word it's
[48:46] built word upon word and he had to be
[48:49] the prophet of god said that this mass
[48:51] of peace was to be
[48:53] cut that's smiling
[48:56] he calls this the cut he said it's like
[48:58] a diamond cut
[49:00] that can only be the diamond can only be
[49:02] cut by another diamond
[49:09] he said she is smitten from the church
[49:12] now this is almost isaiah 53 when we go
[49:16] to isaiah 53 it says
[49:18] he is despised and rejected of man a man
[49:21] of sorrow
[49:22] and acquainted with grief and we hid as
[49:25] it were
[49:26] our faces from him he was despised
[49:29] and we esteemed him not surely he has
[49:33] borne our griefs
[49:34] and he carried our sorrows yet we did
[49:37] esteem
[49:38] him stricken smitten of god and
[49:40] afflicted now the prophet of god is
[49:42] taking this
[49:43] is on the the mayor
[49:46] on the second adam when the the bride
[49:50] was
[49:50] pulled out of him after he was smitten
[49:53] the prophet of god is applying the very
[49:55] same scripture
[49:57] that was that's applied to jesus christ
[49:59] is applying it to
[50:00] the bride saying that she is smitten
[50:04] from the church
[50:06] from the church body smitten with her
[50:09] master
[50:10] for the same purpose she is the word
[50:14] just the same as joseph who was joseph
[50:17] joseph was one of the foundation
[50:19] the perfection of the foundation
[50:23] smitten just the same as joseph was
[50:26] smitten for his
[50:27] uh from his brethren because he was the
[50:30] word
[50:32] and jesus who was the entire the
[50:35] the entire fullness of the word of god
[50:38] was smitten for his brethren
[50:40] because he was the word the bride
[50:44] is smitten from the church because
[50:47] he is the word there are your stages
[50:50] again
[50:51] one two three see just exactly
[50:55] the word living in action
[50:58] the bride the bible bride not some men
[51:01] made bride
[51:03] the bible bride smitten and afflicted of
[51:05] god
[51:06] no beauty we should desire her that's
[51:10] isaiah 53
[51:11] so everything he was you
[51:14] are whatever he is this bride is
[51:18] she is him as the prophet says the
[51:21] prophet of god is
[51:22] applying isaiah 53 the same it was
[51:25] applied to
[51:26] jesus himself it's applied to his bride
[51:29] today
[51:31] no beauty we should desire her but yet
[51:34] we
[51:34] we did esteem her smitten and afflicted
[51:37] of god
[51:38] that's right she stands alone she's
[51:41] smitten from all the denominations
[51:44] according to to revelation 3
[51:47] she's smitten out of the laodicean
[51:50] church age
[51:51] that's that she was raised up in
[51:57] she was raised up in in the laodicean
[52:00] churches
[52:01] but now she's smitten from her from
[52:04] there
[52:05] what was it the word of his mouth
[52:09] identifying his bible bride to her groom
[52:18] is him
[52:21] so wherever he was you were there
[52:25] you were wherever he
[52:28] is you are you are at the store
[52:32] any place you might be he is there with
[52:35] you
[52:35] because you are one with with christ
[52:37] with your mail
[52:39] she stands alone as the prophet says
[52:44] like the bridegroom rejected of man
[52:46] despise and reject of the churches
[52:49] the bride stands that way what is it
[52:53] it's his masterpiece see
[52:56] it's the word that cannot go through
[53:00] make the it's the word that he can work
[53:04] through
[53:05] to make manifest and in the again
[53:08] in the same message he said so i told
[53:11] you that it was just
[53:17] bible study tonight and quotes
[53:22] the word has become flesh exactly like
[53:24] he promised in luke 17
[53:27] malachi 4 and all c that's right
[53:30] revelations all true life that was in
[53:33] the stark
[53:34] castle and husk is now gathering in the
[53:37] seed
[53:38] ready for the resurrection ready for the
[53:41] harvest
[53:42] the alpha has become omega
[53:47] the first became last and the last
[53:50] is the first the seed that went in has
[53:53] come through
[53:54] a process and become the seed again
[53:58] say the seed that fell in the garden of
[54:00] eden
[54:02] there was a seed that fell there when
[54:04] men died
[54:07] and died there come back again
[54:10] from that imperfect seed that died there
[54:15] that's the prophet saying it from that
[54:17] imperfect
[54:18] seed that died there come back the
[54:21] perfect seed
[54:22] the second adam and in one in
[54:25] corinthians
[54:26] 15 4 45 you don't have to turn it says
[54:29] and so it is written the first man adam
[54:33] was a living soul
[54:36] the last adam was made a quickening
[54:40] spirit
[54:41] so the first adam did not have the
[54:44] quickening spirit
[54:46] it was made a living soul that's how he
[54:48] could die
[54:49] because in revelation 16 3 says and the
[54:52] second angel poured out his vowel
[54:54] upon the the sea and he became as the
[54:57] blood as the blood
[54:59] of the dead man and every living soul
[55:02] died in the sea but the quickening
[55:06] the quickening spirit cannot die
[55:09] so god has to take from the foundation
[55:12] from the word
[55:13] to build the man that would be the
[55:16] quickening spirit
[55:18] in not only the living soul
[55:22] he says the first eve that fell and was
[55:26] using the second reformation
[55:31] the second coming as bringing forth a
[55:34] child and now
[55:35] now has become the true bride again the
[55:38] seed
[55:38] right back with original word again
[55:42] so when the prophet god says the first
[55:44] eve that fell
[55:46] was used in the second reformation that
[55:48] this reformation not
[55:50] reforming its forming for the second
[55:53] time
[55:54] forming one more time
[55:58] so the first eve that fell was
[56:02] used in the second coming in the second
[56:05] formation that's the one
[56:08] that's the reason the prophet of god
[56:09] will always say that the reason he said
[56:13] that his bride
[56:16] that that that he has come in the
[56:19] formation of his bride
[56:21] because he's coming in the second
[56:23] formation
[56:25] meaning the the first formation of of
[56:28] of eve of the the woman out of
[56:31] man was in the garden of eden the second
[56:35] formation is when he's bringing because
[56:38] the first man jesus the second
[56:40] adam came jesus is bringing the first
[56:43] the
[56:44] the bride in the formation the second
[56:46] coming of jesus
[56:48] is the formation of the bride the coming
[56:51] in the second formation of eve let me
[56:53] read it here
[56:56] the prophet of god said that it in the
[56:59] messy things that are to be
[57:01] to clarify this you at one time was in
[57:04] your father
[57:05] in the gene of your father now he didn't
[57:08] know
[57:09] you at that time neither did you know
[57:12] him at that time
[57:14] but you see then you were put in the
[57:16] bedding ground
[57:17] in the womb of mother through a holy
[57:21] wedlock
[57:22] and when you become a person expressing
[57:25] the image like your
[57:26] father then there's a fellowship
[57:29] now the only way you can be a son a
[57:31] daughter
[57:32] of god because you have to have eternal
[57:35] life
[57:36] and there's only one form of eternal
[57:39] life and that's
[57:40] god's life only one form of eternal life
[57:43] that's that was god
[57:45] there to be a son of god you had to be
[57:48] in him
[57:49] always the gene of your life
[57:52] spiritual life tonight was in god the
[57:55] father
[57:57] before there was even a molecule see and
[58:00] you are nothing
[58:02] but the manifestation of the gene of
[58:04] life that was in god
[58:06] as a son of god now you are expressed
[58:11] after his word has come into you
[58:14] to light up the age you are expressing
[58:18] god's life in you because
[58:20] you are a son or daughter of god
[58:23] therefore you get what i mean you are
[58:26] now
[58:27] made you are
[58:30] sitting in this church tonight because
[58:32] your duty is to express god
[58:35] to this nation to the to and
[58:38] this people in this neighborhood where
[58:41] you associate
[58:42] he was the fullness of god bodily
[58:45] therefore
[58:46] when he came to the earth and was
[58:47] manifested in flesh
[58:49] you were here in him because he was the
[58:53] word
[58:54] in the beginning the word was god the
[58:55] word was the word
[58:59] was with god and the word was god
[59:02] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[59:04] among us the word was made flesh
[59:06] therefore you walked with him when you
[59:08] were in him
[59:10] when you he was on earth you suffered
[59:13] with him and you died with him
[59:17] he was buried with him and you are now
[59:19] risen with him
[59:21] and manifested attributes of god
[59:24] now if you if we are those
[59:27] attributes of god we cannot live by
[59:31] creed
[59:32] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[59:35] must live by the word
[59:37] because the bride is a part of the
[59:39] bridegroom like any wife is a part of
[59:41] her husband
[59:43] therefore we must be that word bride
[59:48] and what is that word right the
[59:49] manifestation
[59:51] manifestation of this hour the bride not
[59:54] a creed
[59:55] or a denomination but a living oracle
[59:59] a living attributes of god displaying to
[1:00:02] the world the attributes of god
[1:00:05] in the formation of the bride that's to
[1:00:08] be
[1:00:08] expressed in this hour that we're living
[1:00:11] in
[1:00:12] meaning that the second coming of christ
[1:00:15] it's within the formation of his bride
[1:00:18] on earth
[1:00:19] this formation is his second coming
[1:00:22] when we see the bride being formed with
[1:00:24] the same spirit
[1:00:25] with with the same word
[1:00:32] so you are now the sons of god in the
[1:00:35] redemption by power
[1:00:37] now we are sitting together in heavenly
[1:00:39] places
[1:00:40] not we will be in the millennium we are
[1:00:43] now
[1:00:44] right now with the sons of god right now
[1:00:47] we're sitting together
[1:00:48] in heavenly places in jesus christ not
[1:00:51] just in the church
[1:00:53] we are in christ the resurrected lord
[1:00:56] jesus is here
[1:00:58] he's here in his power he's here in his
[1:01:01] redemption power
[1:01:03] he's here for the exodus and here to
[1:01:06] bring
[1:01:06] every church member into fellowship with
[1:01:10] him
[1:01:11] so his word is being ministered his
[1:01:14] revelation has come
[1:01:16] to bring every church member to bring
[1:01:18] every church member into the fellowship
[1:01:20] with him he's here to bring every sinner
[1:01:25] no matter how how low you are he is to
[1:01:28] bring the power
[1:01:30] of the resurrection into your life
[1:01:33] and make you a new creature
[1:01:37] so we see that the first the first man
[1:01:39] fell
[1:01:40] but god has the plan the plan was to
[1:01:43] rebuild
[1:01:44] the same man to give him the opportunity
[1:01:46] to give him the way
[1:01:48] give him the way to the tree of life
[1:01:50] where he will never
[1:01:52] die and he sent his word he built that
[1:01:55] going through the foundation of faith
[1:01:58] his own faith
[1:02:00] of his love of his grace in his own
[1:02:03] perfection and then he gave his children
[1:02:06] the word
[1:02:09] the prophet of god says again the spoken
[1:02:11] word so
[1:02:13] still good on time the first son was
[1:02:17] spoken seed word of god
[1:02:19] he was given a bride
[1:02:22] i'm just reviewing the spirit now is
[1:02:24] picking it up
[1:02:25] picking up what i said see a bride to
[1:02:28] produce himself
[1:02:30] she felt see that's what the bride was
[1:02:33] given to produce himself again
[1:02:35] another son of god but she fell by high
[1:02:38] breeding see
[1:02:40] produced himself but she fell caused him
[1:02:43] to die
[1:02:44] the second son was the second son a
[1:02:46] spoken seed word of god
[1:02:48] was given a bride like adam but before
[1:02:52] he could marry her
[1:02:53] she had fallen also for she was put to a
[1:02:56] free moral agency
[1:02:57] like adam's wife was to believe god's
[1:03:00] word and live
[1:03:02] or doubt it and die and she did
[1:03:06] then from a little group of the true
[1:03:09] seed of the word god will present
[1:03:12] christ a beloved bride a virgin a
[1:03:16] version of his word
[1:03:18] and through them and by them will be
[1:03:20] fulfilled
[1:03:21] all that has been promised for his word
[1:03:24] in the virgin
[1:03:26] who knows no man-made creeds or dogma
[1:03:30] dogma the word of promising himself
[1:03:33] like it was in mary god himself made
[1:03:36] manifest he will act himself
[1:03:40] by his own word of promise so to fulfill
[1:03:44] all that has been written of him and he
[1:03:46] did when he came from the virgin womb
[1:03:49] type of the spirit womb now so will the
[1:03:52] virgin now
[1:03:53] accepting his word be it unto me
[1:03:56] as thou has said they will love
[1:04:00] this group the prophet of god says this
[1:04:02] group will
[1:04:03] love him they will love him they will
[1:04:06] love his word
[1:04:07] and will have his potentials for he is
[1:04:10] their head and they are his subject
[1:04:14] subject to his head headship of christ
[1:04:17] was his
[1:04:19] notice what harmony jesus never did
[1:04:22] anything
[1:04:22] until the father showed him first
[1:04:25] harmony between god and christ see john
[1:04:27] 5 19
[1:04:28] so will the bride and he shows her his
[1:04:32] word of life
[1:04:33] he shows her and she received it she
[1:04:36] receives it
[1:04:38] she never doubts it nothing can harm her
[1:04:42] not even death for if the seed be
[1:04:45] planted
[1:04:46] the water will raise it up again
[1:04:49] and here is the secret
[1:04:52] here is the secret the word is in the
[1:04:55] bride
[1:04:57] and the mind of christ
[1:05:00] so once you receive that word it grows
[1:05:04] as
[1:05:04] you feed upon it you grow into his image
[1:05:08] and you grow into the mind of christ
[1:05:11] because remember
[1:05:13] elisha elash had faith
[1:05:16] and he followed the elijah he got even
[1:05:19] the double portion
[1:05:20] which was the the type of the word the
[1:05:22] double portion
[1:05:24] of the spirit of elijah
[1:05:27] but when he got tested by the children
[1:05:34] his word the word within him has not
[1:05:36] matured yet
[1:05:38] because he did not have the mind of
[1:05:39] christ
[1:05:41] if he had the mind of christ he would
[1:05:42] not have pronounced death on
[1:05:44] the children so this bride not only she
[1:05:47] has his word
[1:05:48] she is growing and maturing with the
[1:05:50] word of god
[1:05:51] to have the full mind of god within her
[1:05:54] because with the mind of god she will
[1:05:57] know what to do with the word
[1:06:00] and here is the secret the word is in
[1:06:02] his bride in the mind of
[1:06:04] christ to know what he wants done with
[1:06:06] the word
[1:06:08] and he does it in his name she has
[1:06:12] thus saith the lord
[1:06:15] they do only his will no one can
[1:06:18] persuade them
[1:06:19] different they have thus saith the lord
[1:06:23] or they keep still then they will
[1:06:27] do the works of god for it is himself in
[1:06:30] the continuing
[1:06:31] in them continuing continuing his word
[1:06:34] to fulfill
[1:06:36] as he did complete in his day
[1:06:40] just think of abraham when god called
[1:06:44] him
[1:06:46] as he he responded
[1:06:50] and believed that the promise that god
[1:06:52] gave him
[1:06:53] garu now was determined to fulfill
[1:06:56] to bring to start rebuilding that man
[1:07:00] that was lost in genesis 2. he was
[1:07:03] rebuilding that man
[1:07:06] so it was no longer abraham abraham
[1:07:11] works or accomplishment it was god who
[1:07:14] was determined
[1:07:15] who was setting the tone so the man
[1:07:18] that was to be rebuilt was hinging
[1:07:22] upon the life of abraham
[1:07:25] and today the god is rebuilding
[1:07:29] is building his bride that has has
[1:07:31] pulled from the body of christ
[1:07:33] and that work is hinging
[1:07:36] upon you by taking his word
[1:07:40] excuse me i uh let's let's stand i had
[1:07:43] broken up
[1:07:44] my computers and things changed but
[1:07:50] and the prophet of god said this is
[1:07:52] brother chad will be
[1:07:53] coming getting ready
[1:08:01] give for the broken up and musicians you
[1:08:03] might come as well
[1:08:06] in the message of perseverance
[1:08:10] if men and women could only think that
[1:08:13] tonight
[1:08:15] that the word of the lord is truth
[1:08:20] there's nothing else all eternity
[1:08:24] hinges on the word of god it hinges upon
[1:08:28] you
[1:08:29] you taking the word of god and believing

[1:11:51] bride that you are now rebuilding
[1:11:54] by the same method
[1:11:58] father we thank you we know that you are
[1:12:00] here lauren
[1:12:03] and we thank you that that story did not
[1:12:05] end up justin
[1:12:07] in chapter 3 lord is a sad story
[1:12:10] but we see the beauty of it father as we
[1:12:13] we can see through the ages
[1:12:15] that you were rebuilding that man the
[1:12:18] quickening spirit
[1:12:20] not only the soul
[1:12:24] but father the quickening spirit when we
[1:12:26] we thank you we we love your father we
[1:12:28] commit
[1:12:29] the servant in your hands let your name
[1:12:31] be
[1:12:32] glorified in jesus christ samuel
[1:12:35] amen amen thank you
[1:12:40] how many are glad he determined to have
[1:12:43] a masterpiece
[1:12:45] amen i appreciated the thought i
[1:12:48] appreciated
[1:12:49] my brother emmanuel sharing his burden
[1:12:51] in his heart it just struck me
[1:12:53] so much the unconditional covenant
[1:12:56] was because god determined
[1:12:59] it wasn't just because we were failures
[1:13:03] it wasn't just because we were failures
[1:13:05] but it was
[1:13:06] we were failures but god determined he
[1:13:09] was going to have a masterpiece
[1:13:11] he could have given it up on the fact
[1:13:13] that man's a failure he's never going to
[1:13:14] get it right
[1:13:15] we're finished we're doomed there's no
[1:13:17] way back to the tree of life
[1:13:18] but he determined he's going to have a
[1:13:21] masterpiece and because he determined
[1:13:24] who could resist his will amen
[1:13:27] who can resist his will you know that
[1:13:31] in romans it talks about how can the he
[1:13:33] that is created say to him to create it
[1:13:35] why
[1:13:35] thou made me thus and in that notion you
[1:13:37] take it as a negative notion you know
[1:13:40] why have you made me uh uh you know and
[1:13:42] the evil way
[1:13:43] not to believe but let's take it on the
[1:13:47] positive
[1:13:47] [Music]
[1:13:48] he's made me a believer he's put
[1:13:52] inside of me his predestinated sieging
[1:13:55] of eternal life
[1:13:56] i'm a believer and who am i to say why
[1:13:59] hast thou
[1:14:00] made me thus why even speak back
[1:14:03] just accept it and say god i believe it
[1:14:05] and i receive it in jesus name
[1:14:07] lord i'm as unworthy as anybody else is
[1:14:10] unworthy
[1:14:11] i mess up just as much as anybody and
[1:14:13] fail like anybody else but
[1:14:15] the desire of my heart is something you
[1:14:17] put there it's
[1:14:18] your determination not mine
[1:14:21] where did that desire in your heart come
[1:14:23] from his determination to have a
[1:14:25] masterpiece to have a bride
[1:14:27] not our willpower not not our
[1:14:29] determination but his determination
[1:14:32] and who can resist his will and who can
[1:14:35] say why has you made me thus
[1:14:37] might as well just say i accept it
[1:14:41] i accept what you've done and i believe
[1:14:43] it
[1:14:44] in jesus name let's sing brother ben
[1:15:00] [Music]
[1:15:08] myself
[1:15:12] show me myself
[1:15:28] [Music]
[1:15:35] and let
[1:15:50] live
[1:15:55] [Music]
[1:16:04] myself
[1:16:09] show me myself
[1:16:24] [Music]
[1:16:31] and let
[1:16:41] there's one quote that brother manuel
[1:16:43] read from that was so notable to me
[1:16:46] i know it i've heard it but i wanted to
[1:16:48] go back and study and read it again
[1:16:51] but it shows brother brenna's mentality
[1:16:53] about the word bride what he thinks
[1:16:55] about the word bride
[1:16:56] and how much she is him because in this
[1:17:00] quote brother branham is referring to
[1:17:02] revelation chapter three
[1:17:04] and in revelation chapter three it says
[1:17:05] behold i stand at the door and knock
[1:17:07] and brother ben over and over says see
[1:17:09] he's outside of his own church he's been
[1:17:12] cast out
[1:17:12] he's been kicked out of his own church
[1:17:14] but in this quote that our brother read
[1:17:16] tonight
[1:17:17] brother brother uh brother manuel read
[1:17:19] that brother branham says
[1:17:21] now look look she's in revelations
[1:17:25] chapter three
[1:17:26] she's kicked out of the church she's
[1:17:28] smitten out of the church
[1:17:30] who was spitting out of the church jesus
[1:17:32] christ the word
[1:17:33] who is the bride the word if the word
[1:17:35] was kicked out
[1:17:36] amen she's the word she's smitten
[1:17:39] outside of the church
[1:17:42] brother brother branham's mentality so
[1:17:45] ties the bride and groom together as one
[1:17:48] when he saw revelation 3 that jesus
[1:17:50] christ is on the outside knocking
[1:17:52] he realizes that the bride also in
[1:17:54] laodicea
[1:17:55] is smitten outside of the church
[1:17:59] amen i think our brother brother branham
[1:18:01] finally came to the revelation not
[1:18:03] finally but he came to the revelation in
[1:18:04] the end time
[1:18:06] the same revelation that god had when he
[1:18:08] made adam in his bride
[1:18:10] and he looked down and he said i'll call
[1:18:12] their name adam
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:15] that the word has been so restored and
[1:18:17] so brought back under a prophetic
[1:18:19] ministry
[1:18:19] that what god saw in the beginning when
[1:18:21] he made adam and drew out his wife and
[1:18:23] united the two as one
[1:18:24] and called their name adam at the end
[1:18:27] time he's repeated the same cycle
[1:18:29] and come back so much so that in
[1:18:31] scriptures in isaiah 53 referring to
[1:18:33] jesus christ he refers him to the bride
[1:18:35] and and revelations chapter 3 referring
[1:18:39] to laodicean church a jesus christ on
[1:18:41] the outside he'll refer it to the bride
[1:18:45] let's not in our minds put ourselves in
[1:18:47] a place the prophet didn't see us and
[1:18:49] the word doesn't put us
[1:18:51] if isaiah 53 applies to him it applies
[1:18:53] to me
[1:18:54] if revelation 3 applies to him it
[1:18:56] applies to me
[1:18:58] because god has taken what was once two
[1:19:01] and he's put them back together and made
[1:19:03] them one
[1:19:06] and it's not for us to say why have you
[1:19:07] done this why me
[1:19:09] why this festival i mixed with me it's
[1:19:11] not up to me to say why have you made me
[1:19:13] thus
[1:19:13] it's up to me to say you did a good
[1:19:15] thing you did it of your own choosing
[1:19:17] you did it of your own determination
[1:19:18] i could never do it i could never get it
[1:19:21] right but because you
[1:19:22] determine i believe it and i accept it
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:26] quit questioning why just receive what
[1:19:28] he's done
[1:19:30] what's your desire where is your heart
[1:19:32] what do you believe
[1:19:33] and why do you believe it
[1:19:36] because he determined that he was going
[1:19:39] to have a masterpiece
[1:19:41] and she was going to be him
[1:19:46] can we comprehend it not with these
[1:19:48] minds
[1:19:50] when we look in the mirror does it
[1:19:52] always make sense
[1:19:54] no but it's what he determined
[1:19:58] and i believe it and i receive it
[1:20:02] that's his plan it's his will
[1:20:05] and i say be it unto me according to thy
[1:20:09] word
[1:20:10] it says bow our heads and pray lord
[1:20:13] jesus we thank you for your word
[1:20:16] we thank you lord for our brother
[1:20:17] emmanuel and the thought you placed in
[1:20:19] him and the word you delivered through
[1:20:20] him
[1:20:22] god how how closely
[1:20:25] you see your bride to your bridegroom
[1:20:27] how effective your uniting work was your
[1:20:30] masterpiece the second building
[1:20:32] of the masterpiece that had fallen lord
[1:20:34] you've completed your work lord you're
[1:20:36] displaying it now
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:38] help us to get so in tune with it lord
[1:20:41] that we don't question it anymore we
[1:20:43] just receive it lord
[1:20:44] we just receive it in your name we
[1:20:46] believe it lord like abraham believed
[1:20:48] when you promised him your seed shall be
[1:20:50] like the stars in heaven
[1:20:52] how could a man comprehend that amen
[1:20:54] looking up at stars amen
[1:20:56] and comprehend that his seed will be as
[1:20:58] the stars in heaven
[1:20:59] but he believed you and it was imputed
[1:21:01] unto him for righteousness
[1:21:03] and just as unbelievable as that was to
[1:21:06] a carnal mind
[1:21:07] now the carnal mind you're speaking a
[1:21:09] perfect word amen we may not be able to
[1:21:11] figure it out any more than abraham
[1:21:13] could figure out how his seed will be
[1:21:14] like the stars of heaven
[1:21:16] but god may my response be just like
[1:21:19] abraham's response
[1:21:20] may i just believe you and take you at
[1:21:22] your word
[1:21:24] if you said it in your word your prophet
[1:21:26] brought the revelation of it
[1:21:28] let me just receive it like abraham
[1:21:30] received the promise
[1:21:32] and may you do the same thing for me you
[1:21:34] did for abraham may you
[1:21:35] imputed unto my righteousness
[1:21:39] because i believe you lord god we thank
[1:21:42] you for giving us faith we thank you for
[1:21:44] being determined lord
[1:21:46] you were more determined than we were
[1:21:48] you were more determined than our
[1:21:49] willpower you were more determined than
[1:21:51] our strengths enabled us
[1:21:52] you were more determined lord you
[1:21:56] were so determined you made a way that
[1:21:57] would overcome every one of our failures
[1:22:01] so it wasn't based on us it was based on
[1:22:03] your word
[1:22:05] let your promise be manifest in us now
[1:22:08] lord
[1:22:09] let it live in us let it live through us
[1:22:12] lord
[1:22:12] let us be the fulfillment of that
[1:22:14] promise
[1:22:16] of that word we ask it lord as we go
[1:22:19] from here
[1:22:20] let us live that life by faith let us
[1:22:23] walk every day
[1:22:24] in that word let us not question anymore
[1:22:26] but accept it and move forward and allow
[1:22:28] you the preeminence that you deserve
[1:22:30] may your word live through us may your
[1:22:33] word rule every moment of our life
[1:22:36] we ask it lord in jesus christ's name as
[1:22:38] we part
[1:22:39] keep us lord use us for your glory
[1:22:43] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[1:22:47] god bless your friends
