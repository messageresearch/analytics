[5:33] amen praise the lord god bless you it's
[5:36] good to see you this evening
[5:37] and while we're standing let's take our
[5:38] bibles and turn to ezekiel
[5:41] we're going to continue on with the same
[5:43] line of thinking we've been on
[5:45] and asked the lord to continue to unfold
[5:47] his word to us
[5:49] amen but we're going to look at ezekiel
[5:51] 28
[5:53] and verse 12. and as you're turning
[5:56] there
[5:56] i had a couple people ask me about the
[5:58] watch night service
[6:00] and the curfew that the governor has
[6:02] extended till
[6:03] january second but there's an exemption
[6:06] in the curfew
[6:07] for religious observances so we are
[6:10] under an exemption so we are not
[6:11] the curfew does not apply to us for our
[6:14] watch night service so in case you were
[6:15] wondering
[6:16] now everybody knows amen i also want to
[6:18] remind you if you want to sing a special
[6:20] for that to please get with brother mike
[6:22] that'll be thursday december 31st at 8
[6:24] 30.
[6:25] so we're looking forward to that let's
[6:28] look at ezekiel chapter 28
[6:30] and verse 12.
[6:34] son of man take up a lamentation upon
[6:36] the king of tyrus and send him
[6:38] thus saith the lord god thou seallest up
[6:41] to some full of wisdom
[6:42] and perfect in beauty thou has been in
[6:45] eden the garden of god
[6:46] every precious stone was thy covering
[6:48] the sardis
[6:49] topaz the diamond the barrel the onyx
[6:52] the jasper the sapphire the emerald and
[6:54] the carbuncle and gold
[6:55] the workmanship of thy tabrts and of thy
[6:57] pipes was prepared in thee
[6:59] and the day that thou was created thou
[7:01] art the anointed cherub that covereth
[7:04] and i have set thee so thou wast upon
[7:06] the holy mountain of god thou
[7:08] hast walked up and down in the midst of
[7:10] the stones of fire that was perfect in
[7:12] thy ways from the day that thou was
[7:14] created
[7:14] till iniquity was found in thee and
[7:17] let's bow our heads and ask the lord to
[7:19] bless the reading of his word
[7:21] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[7:23] jesus for your word
[7:25] we ask lord that you would just come now
[7:28] break the bread of life with your own
[7:29] hands lord and
[7:31] feed it to us your sheep i pray you
[7:33] would take over this vessel lord as i
[7:35] yield it to you and
[7:36] that you administer through a gift
[7:37] you've placed in this vessel of clay
[7:40] by the power of your holy ghost may you
[7:41] bring us your word lord
[7:43] may we see lord with clearer vision than
[7:45] we've ever seen before
[7:47] may you lift us up on high lord and may
[7:49] we be all that you've called us to be in
[7:51] this hour
[7:52] we ask you to preeminence among us and
[7:54] take your liberty here tonight in jesus
[7:56] christ's name we pray
[7:58] amen you can have your seats
[8:02] we want to continue on uh
[8:06] the way we've been discussing and
[8:08] talking about this great battle and
[8:09] these forces and these armies and
[8:11] our position and i titled this tonight
[8:13] changing positions
[8:15] and as we go i hope you understand this
[8:17] i think a year or a little more over a
[8:19] year ago
[8:19] i ministered in this line of thinking
[8:21] and i was breaking down this subject but
[8:23] i want to address it again
[8:25] with what we've been talking about let's
[8:27] turn quickly over to isaiah 14 and catch
[8:30] another scripture
[8:31] here in isaiah isaiah
[8:34] chapter 14 and verse 12.
[8:40] isaiah 14 and 12 how art thou fallen
[8:42] from heaven o lucifer
[8:44] son of the morning how art thou cut down
[8:47] to the ground which did weaken
[8:49] the nations brother branham begins to
[8:52] talk about this in the message greatest
[8:53] battle
[8:54] ever fought he said the great first
[8:56] battle that was ever fought began in
[8:58] heaven
[8:59] when michael and his angels fought
[9:01] against lucifer and his angels
[9:03] it first started the first battle was in
[9:04] heaven so sin did not originate on earth
[9:07] it originated in heaven i mean that's so
[9:10] important to recognize
[9:11] amen that's why heaven has to be
[9:13] reconciled heaven
[9:15] and earth and so we go on it says and
[9:17] then it was thrown down from heaven cast
[9:19] out of heaven to the earth
[9:20] and fell on human beings then the battle
[9:23] from angels became human battles
[9:25] and satan came to destroy god's creation
[9:27] what god had created to be for himself
[9:30] he had satan came down to just come down
[9:33] to destroy this
[9:34] that's what his purpose was was to
[9:35] destroy it then the battle began here on
[9:38] earth and begin in
[9:39] us and it has been raging ever since
[9:42] so we want to recognize that this is the
[9:44] same war like we've been talking about
[9:46] this is not a new war
[9:48] this is a continuation of the heavenly
[9:50] war
[9:51] and i would say it's still a heavenly
[9:53] war
[9:54] but it's taking place in us amen
[9:58] and that's why you know brother branham
[9:59] told us he says you're going to find out
[10:02] someday
[10:02] that when you go to heaven you don't fly
[10:04] off somewhere far away heaven's right
[10:06] here just moving at a faster speed it's
[10:08] another dimension
[10:09] so we say it's a heavenly war we're not
[10:11] talking about here we're here on earth
[10:13] and
[10:13] way way way up there is heaven somewhere
[10:16] no heaven is here
[10:18] it's another dimension amen it's moving
[10:20] faster but it's having influence over
[10:22] what's happening here
[10:23] amen and so there's still this battle is
[10:26] still taking place
[10:27] in the heavenlies we know that by the
[10:29] scripture because we wore not against
[10:30] flesh and blood but against
[10:32] principalities powers
[10:33] and and high places and and now high
[10:35] places is in heavenly places
[10:38] so we know that the battle was still
[10:40] going on the heavenlies amen but it's
[10:41] taking place in
[10:42] us and it's the heavenly realms and
[10:44] influences that are working in us
[10:47] so i'd say that we are the battleground
[10:50] amen
[10:51] and instrumental in what's taking place
[10:54] is taking place in us amen let's turn to
[10:57] revelation chapter 12.
[11:02] so i hope that we realize as we talk
[11:04] about this
[11:06] that we don't start looking back at what
[11:08] happened and forward at what will happen
[11:10] but we are always tuned and recognizing
[11:12] what is going on right now
[11:14] it's not like we can say well there was
[11:16] a battle in heaven and
[11:17] there will be another battle a great
[11:19] battle at the end of all things but you
[11:21] have to realize that that battle is
[11:22] going on now
[11:24] and if we don't realize that we start
[11:26] looking back and looking forward and we
[11:28] start getting lazy and we start missing
[11:30] the whole
[11:30] and we miss the whole point we miss
[11:32] what's going on all around us and in us
[11:34] and through us
[11:35] and all about us amen and what the
[11:37] struggles are in life and what they're
[11:38] all about
[11:39] so we've got to stay tuned in revelation
[11:42] chapter 12 verse 7
[11:46] and there was war in heaven michael and
[11:49] his angels fought against the dragon and
[11:51] the dragon fought in his angels
[11:53] and prevailed not neither was their
[11:55] place found anymore in heaven
[11:57] and the great dragon was cast out that
[11:59] old serpent called the devil
[12:01] and satan which deceiveth the whole
[12:03] world he was
[12:04] cast out into the earth and his angels
[12:06] were cast out with him
[12:07] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[12:09] heaven now has come salvation and
[12:11] strength
[12:12] in the kingdom of our god and the power
[12:14] of his christ for the accuser of our
[12:16] brethren is cast down
[12:17] which accused him before our god day and
[12:20] night
[12:21] and they overcame him by the blood of
[12:23] the lamb and by the word of their
[12:24] testimony and they loved not their lives
[12:27] unto death so now
[12:30] we when we look back at ezekiel and
[12:32] ezekiel 28
[12:34] in ezekiel 28 lucifer had a title
[12:38] and that title was the anointed cherub
[12:40] and the cherub that covereth so he was
[12:42] the
[12:42] anointed covering cherub over the mercy
[12:45] seat
[12:46] so he had a title and he had a position
[12:48] but we know when the war broke out in
[12:50] heaven that he lost that position
[12:52] he was cast out and he was cast down he
[12:55] went from being the mighty angel he was
[12:56] cast down
[12:57] he was cut down but then we find him
[13:00] over here
[13:01] in revelations chapter 12 and he has a
[13:04] new title
[13:06] and over here he's not called the
[13:08] anointed cherub that covereth but over
[13:10] here he's called the accuser of the
[13:11] brethren
[13:13] so we look he's he's changed position
[13:15] he's no longer the anointed chair of
[13:17] that covered
[13:18] but now we find him back in heaven he's
[13:21] been cut down and cast out but now he's
[13:24] back there
[13:24] as the accuser of the brethren and we
[13:27] know that he's not going to stay there
[13:29] there's going to come a time that he'll
[13:31] be cast out of that position
[13:34] and that has everything to do with you
[13:36] and i
[13:37] and that's what we want to talk about
[13:38] tonight that that next casting down
[13:42] but before that i want to turn to job
[13:45] if we can go all the way back to job
[13:46] again
[13:49] job chapter 1.
[13:56] job chapter 1 and verse 6.
[14:03] in job chapter 6 it says now there was a
[14:07] day when the sons of god came to present
[14:09] themselves before the lord
[14:10] and satan came also among them now
[14:14] this is after the war in heaven when he
[14:16] was cut down
[14:18] and he and brother baby tells us he was
[14:20] cast out and we'll read those quotes in
[14:21] just a second he was cast out and cast
[14:23] into earth
[14:24] and then the war broke out in eden and
[14:26] he came into the to the serpent to
[14:27] deceive the woman in eden and
[14:30] now after that this is after that in the
[14:32] book of job
[14:33] now that there's a day when the sons of
[14:35] god come to present themselves before
[14:36] the lord and satan
[14:38] come also among them and we know what is
[14:41] satan's title
[14:42] in revelation chapter 12 his title is
[14:44] the accuser of the brethren
[14:47] amen and so don't forget that we're
[14:49] going to hold on to that and talk about
[14:51] that more
[14:52] let's let's read a few more verses here
[14:54] and the lord said unto satan
[14:55] when's cometh down then satan answered
[14:58] the lord and said
[14:59] from going to and fro in the earth and
[15:01] from walking up and down in it
[15:03] and the lord said unto satan hastil
[15:05] considered my servant job
[15:07] now now this is interesting we've talked
[15:09] about this a lot and brother bannon
[15:10] speaks a lot about job
[15:12] but now the the devil has been roaming
[15:14] to and fro
[15:15] up and down in the earth and now there's
[15:17] a day that the sons of god present
[15:19] themselves and satan comes among them
[15:21] also
[15:21] and god asks satan what have you been
[15:23] doing well i've been going to and fro
[15:25] and i've been looking and inspecting
[15:27] and god says have you considered job
[15:31] i want you to look at job amen why what
[15:34] is the devil's title
[15:35] he is satan is no longer he's no longer
[15:37] lucifer he's lost that position now he's
[15:39] got a title of devil
[15:41] or satan and he's the accuser of the
[15:43] brethren and god is saying
[15:44] hey you accuser of the brethren check
[15:46] out job
[15:49] let's what have you considered job amen
[15:51] what about job
[15:52] and here's what he goes on to say
[15:56] he says and lord said unto satan has
[15:57] thou considered my servant job that
[15:59] there is none like him
[16:00] in the earth a perfect and upright man
[16:03] one that feareth god and askew with evil
[16:06] then satan answered the lord and said
[16:08] does joe fear god for naught
[16:11] has not thou made a hedge about him and
[16:13] about his house and about all that he
[16:14] hath on every side
[16:16] thou has blessed the work of his hands
[16:18] and his substances increased in the land
[16:20] but put forth thine hand now and touch
[16:22] all that he hath and he will curse thee
[16:24] to thy face
[16:25] and the lord said unto satan behold all
[16:27] that he hath is in thy power
[16:29] only upon himself put not forth thine
[16:31] hand so satan went forth from the
[16:33] presence of the lord
[16:35] and we know what happens in the book of
[16:36] job he goes down and he smites him with
[16:38] boils he takes
[16:40] first he takes away all of his goods and
[16:42] all of his children
[16:43] and then he comes the second time before
[16:44] the lord and the lord says have you
[16:46] considered
[16:47] job amen so so the satan is still he's
[16:50] right here the accuser of the brother
[16:52] he's there he's presenting himself he
[16:54] has access to the throne of god
[16:56] he's back in heaven and he's there as
[16:58] accuser of the brethren and god is now
[17:00] saying
[17:01] what about job go look at job and he
[17:03] accuses job
[17:05] he says is job serve you for not amen
[17:08] you've got a hedge of protection you've
[17:09] blessed his way
[17:10] that's why he serves you if you take
[17:12] away his blessings he'll stop serving
[17:14] you
[17:15] because this is who he is he's the
[17:18] accuser of the brethren and god
[17:20] takes up the challenge amen because he
[17:22] knows what's in job
[17:24] because job is representing you and i
[17:26] job is representing the believer that'll
[17:28] go through trials it'll be tested we'll
[17:30] go through hardship
[17:31] but will not sin against god with their
[17:33] mouth
[17:34] will not disbelieve so we have this
[17:38] whole
[17:39] scenario that takes place and we can see
[17:41] what satan is now
[17:42] doing amen in his new position as
[17:44] accuser of the brethren
[17:46] brother brahm said in the first seal now
[17:49] notice
[17:49] at the end time at the end of the church
[17:51] ages now he is called
[17:54] he and his children are called the
[17:55] antichrist because anything that's
[17:57] against christ is antichrist
[17:59] and anything that's against the word is
[18:01] against christ because christ is the
[18:03] word
[18:03] now he's antichrist then in revelation
[18:06] 12
[18:06] 7 and 9 when satan has cast out the
[18:09] accuser
[18:11] i want to put that down because i want
[18:12] to read it when we we haven't got time
[18:14] now because it's
[18:15] 25 till 10 or 15 till 10 but in
[18:18] revelation 12 7 and 9
[18:20] satan the spirit the devil which is up
[18:22] there now accuser of the brethren all
[18:24] right
[18:24] the church is taken up and satan is cast
[18:27] out
[18:28] when the church goes up satan comes down
[18:31] then satan incarnates himself in the
[18:33] antichrist and is called
[18:35] the beast so let's let's keep that in
[18:37] your mind
[18:38] when the church goes up satan comes down
[18:42] so i think it's important that the
[18:44] church goes up
[18:46] and then the church is being called up
[18:47] higher and keeps going up because when
[18:49] when the church goes up satan comes down
[18:52] because
[18:52] satan is the accuser of the brethren and
[18:54] when did he become the accuser of the
[18:56] brethren
[18:56] when he deceived eve and when adam and
[18:58] eve fell
[18:59] now he had an accusation against the
[19:02] children of god
[19:03] and that accusation against the children
[19:05] of god somehow
[19:07] gave him access to heaven as an accuser
[19:11] there's something going on and i'm not
[19:13] going to claim to know it i can't put
[19:15] terms to it i don't i don't say i can
[19:16] comprehend all of this but he's got
[19:18] access in the heaven he's returned back
[19:21] into the heavenlies and he's there when
[19:22] the sons of god present themselves to
[19:24] god
[19:24] and he's there as an accuser of the
[19:26] brethren amen and god
[19:27] and job is showing this whole
[19:29] relationship in job
[19:31] as the accuser of the brethren but we
[19:33] find he couldn't
[19:34] accuse job because job believed god amen
[19:38] now let's turn to john chapter 8 i'm
[19:40] still trying to lay foundational pieces
[19:42] here and well hopefully by the grace of
[19:43] god tie them together
[19:45] john chapter 8 and verse 46.
[19:56] john chapter 8 and verse 46
[20:01] which of you convinces me of sin
[20:04] and if i say the truth why do you not
[20:06] believe me
[20:08] he that is of god heareth god's word you
[20:10] therefore heareth them not because you
[20:12] are
[20:12] not of god and jesus is looking at them
[20:14] he says who of you convinces me of sin
[20:16] this word convinced means to reprove
[20:18] rebuke to convict
[20:20] to tell one's fault amen to to find
[20:22] fault with or correct
[20:24] and jesus says who can who which one of
[20:26] you can accuse me of sin
[20:28] because the pharisees were on earth they
[20:31] were playing the part of the accuser
[20:35] accusing jesus but jesus says you can't
[20:37] accuse me of sin
[20:38] because jesus knows what sin is
[20:41] the brother of him tells us sin the only
[20:43] sin is unbelief
[20:44] amen all the actions that we call sin
[20:47] are
[20:47] attributes of unbelief but the real sin
[20:50] is unbelief
[20:51] and jesus knew where he stood on the
[20:53] word and he said which one of you can
[20:54] accuse me of sin
[20:56] and brother brahman says this in in the
[20:58] message identification he says
[21:00] he was god's word expressed and properly
[21:03] vindicated
[21:04] identified when he stood here on earth
[21:06] he said if i do not the works of my
[21:07] father then don't believe me
[21:09] and he said which one of you can accuse
[21:11] me of sin
[21:13] i would like to open that just a little
[21:14] bit for you if it be permissible
[21:16] you see sin is unbelief there's only two
[21:18] things two channels that you can live by
[21:21] one of them is faith and the other is
[21:22] unbelief he that believeth not is
[21:25] condemned already
[21:26] smoking drinking committing adultery
[21:28] lying stealing
[21:29] carnal impersonations those things are
[21:31] attributes of unbelief
[21:32] if you was a believer you wouldn't do
[21:34] those things no you do that because
[21:36] you're not a believer
[21:38] and we we all of us we all realize that
[21:41] that
[21:41] our flesh is not yet a believer
[21:44] and the human spirit is not yet a
[21:46] believer but we've been born again
[21:48] the life on the inside has been
[21:50] quickened to life and it becomes the
[21:51] control tower that control the outer man
[21:54] and the outer man will still crave
[21:55] things that are wrong amen but there's
[21:57] something on the
[21:58] inside that won't let it continue on
[22:00] amen we'll say no we won't go that far
[22:02] what is that
[22:03] that's the believer on the inside and
[22:06] the believer on the inside says
[22:07] no we're not going to be an unbeliever
[22:09] we're not going to have attributes of
[22:11] unbelief
[22:11] and it doesn't mean we won't fail it
[22:13] doesn't mean we won't fall it doesn't
[22:15] mean the outer man won't be tempted to
[22:16] do wrong
[22:17] but there's a believer on the inside
[22:19] that says we're not going to do that
[22:20] amen
[22:21] we're not going to lie we're not going
[22:22] to steal we're not going to cheat we're
[22:24] not going to lust we're not going to do
[22:26] those things
[22:28] and why don't we do that because we're
[22:30] believers
[22:31] because we believe god and the believer
[22:34] is on the inside
[22:35] and the message go wake jesus he says oh
[22:38] we need deepness of sincerity
[22:40] we need something back we don't need so
[22:42] much showmanship we need the holy spirit
[22:45] living among us
[22:46] to where men can say who can accuse me
[22:48] of sin
[22:50] sin is unbelief this brother bam says we
[22:53] need the holy ghost amen where men can
[22:55] say
[22:56] who could accuse me of sin amen that's a
[22:58] bold statement when you can come to the
[23:00] place where you can say
[23:01] who can accuse me of sin because you can
[23:04] follow
[23:04] somebody around with a tape recorder or
[23:06] video them all day and you can probably
[23:08] find infractions in their character
[23:11] let's just say if i followed you all day
[23:14] i get a week and i got you on camera all
[23:17] day for a week
[23:18] and i say i'm going to check every
[23:20] infraction and everything that is
[23:21] against the nature of christ or contrary
[23:23] to the word
[23:24] i want to ask you would i have something
[23:26] to report
[23:29] if you followed me i would you would
[23:31] have something to report i'll just tell
[23:32] you that way
[23:34] but that's not what we're looking at
[23:36] we're that's not what god is looking at
[23:39] god is looking at the faith on the
[23:41] inside there's something in you that was
[23:42] before the foundation of the world that
[23:44] could believe the word
[23:45] amen the way he's given the word in this
[23:47] age amen
[23:48] not to have to change it or manipulate
[23:50] but to receive it the way he's given it
[23:52] through a prophetic message
[23:54] through the messenger and now
[23:57] there's only one sin that's unbelief and
[24:00] when we can get to this place where he
[24:01] can say
[24:02] who can accuse me of sin you can accuse
[24:04] me the outer man of failing you can
[24:06] accuse me of saying something harsh
[24:08] or maybe having a a wrong attitude or
[24:11] saying something wrong or doing
[24:12] something wrong but you can't accuse me
[24:14] of disbelieving this word
[24:17] because there's something in me that's
[24:18] the believer amen it's not my intellect
[24:21] amen it's not the outer man
[24:22] it has nothing to do with the outer man
[24:24] there's a believer in me that's been
[24:26] born again by the spirit of god
[24:27] that always believes the word that
[24:29] cannot disbelieve this word
[24:30] despite what goes out in the honor man
[24:32] the inner man is a believer
[24:35] and who can accuse me because this outer
[24:37] man is going to change
[24:38] this isn't me amen i'm not identifying
[24:42] with this anymore
[24:43] this isn't me that's why when brother
[24:45] branham says you know you've really
[24:47] never seen me
[24:48] i can shout hallelujah because you've
[24:50] really never seen me
[24:52] and i say who can accuse me of sin i'm
[24:54] not talking about this tent that i'm
[24:56] living in
[24:57] i'm talking about the genuine me on the
[24:59] inside
[25:02] so as we as we look deep into the word
[25:06] we have to start we have to start
[25:08] separating
[25:10] the flesh and go a little deeper
[25:14] by the word and separate the the
[25:17] spirit and the soul like the bone and
[25:19] the morrow
[25:22] and not identify with the outer man
[25:25] now that doesn't give us any license
[25:29] because there's nothing in us that wants
[25:30] to do wrong
[25:32] there's nothing deep inside of us that
[25:34] wants to sin or displease
[25:36] god amen the unbelievers on the outside
[25:39] so if we
[25:39] if we want to if we take that as a
[25:41] license to do what we want then we
[25:42] haven't been born again that's what the
[25:44] prophet tells us
[25:46] so he goes on and says there's only one
[25:49] sin
[25:50] that's unbelief that's faith or unbelief
[25:54] he that believeth not is condemned
[25:56] already you can smoke
[25:57] drink and do those things because you
[25:59] don't believe but if you do believe
[26:01] you'll do
[26:01] otherwise it's because either faith or
[26:04] unbelief
[26:04] is in you now i'm laying all this down
[26:08] as a foundation because i want to tie
[26:09] some things together
[26:11] in the seventh seal
[26:14] in the seventh seal brother graham says
[26:16] it's an old battle
[26:18] that started way back beyond time it's
[26:21] amazing how much brother ram talks about
[26:23] this
[26:24] that there is only one war that's taking
[26:26] place and the war is over god's word
[26:29] and it's an old battle that started way
[26:31] back beyond time
[26:33] and then there was satan and his angels
[26:35] was kicked out
[26:36] and then they come to earth and the
[26:38] battle set it again
[26:40] because eve broke down the barrier from
[26:42] where she was isolated behind the word
[26:44] of god
[26:45] and from the very hours satan won the
[26:47] battle over god's word
[26:49] because one of his subjects the weaker
[26:51] let down the bar
[26:53] listen to this sentence and that's
[26:55] exactly how he's won the battle every
[26:57] time
[26:58] has been because one of his subjects let
[27:00] down the bar
[27:01] from the word
[27:05] that's what the devil wants
[27:09] he wants one subject to let down the bar
[27:12] on the word
[27:14] because that's how he's had victory from
[27:16] the very beginning when one subject
[27:18] let down the bar on the word when eve
[27:20] disbelieved the word
[27:22] and was seduced by the devil and left
[27:24] the word and took the lie
[27:25] amen he got victory there and that's how
[27:28] he's had victory every time
[27:29] and that's why this bride must be a word
[27:32] bride and she must stand on the word
[27:34] and the word only that's why god's given
[27:37] us such a word in this day
[27:38] because that's exactly how he's won the
[27:40] battle every time
[27:42] has been when because one of his
[27:44] subjects has let down the bar from the
[27:46] word now let's go to romans
[27:49] i want to read several scriptures in a
[27:51] row here
[27:53] romans chapter 4.
[28:07] romans chapter 4 and verse 9.
[28:12] come this blessedness then upon the
[28:14] circumcision only
[28:15] or upon the uncircumcision also for we
[28:18] say that faith was reckoned to abraham
[28:20] for righteousness
[28:21] how was it then reckoned when he was in
[28:23] circumcision or in uncircumcision
[28:25] not in circumcision but in
[28:27] uncircumcision
[28:28] and he receiveth the sign of
[28:30] circumcision a seal of the righteousness
[28:32] of the faith which he had yet being
[28:33] uncircumcised
[28:35] that he might be the father of all them
[28:37] that believe though they be not
[28:38] circumcised that righteousness might be
[28:40] imputed unto them also
[28:42] and the father of circumcision to them
[28:45] who are not of circumcision only
[28:46] but who also walk in the steps of that
[28:49] faith of our father abraham
[28:51] which he had being yet uncircumcised
[28:54] so he's telling us is he's the father by
[28:56] faith and faith
[28:58] was righteousness was imputed to him by
[29:00] faith
[29:01] amen it's faith in the word of god that
[29:03] wins the day and it's considered
[29:05] righteousness and our justification
[29:07] and i want to read that in several
[29:08] places so that we can move forward
[29:10] romans chapter 5 let's go over here to
[29:12] rome chapter 5 verse 1
[29:15] therefore being justified by faith
[29:19] being justified by it didn't say
[29:21] justified by
[29:22] actions it said justified by faith
[29:26] therefore being justified by faith we
[29:28] have peace with god through our lord
[29:29] jesus christ
[29:30] by whom also we have access by faith
[29:32] unto his grace
[29:33] wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of
[29:36] the glory
[29:37] of god galatians chapter three let's
[29:40] jump over the galatians and
[29:41] read two scriptures there and then we're
[29:45] going to come back
[29:46] to romans for one more
[29:50] galatians chapter 3 and 11.
[29:56] but that no man is justified by the law
[29:58] on the side of god it is
[30:00] evident for the just shall live by faith
[30:03] so how do we live we live by faith how
[30:05] do the just live
[30:06] by faith now verse 24
[30:11] wherefore the law was our schoolmaster
[30:13] to bring us unto christ
[30:15] that we might be justified by
[30:18] faith now let's go back to romans
[30:23] chapter 8.
[30:29] and verse 31.
[30:38] romans 8 31 what what shall we then say
[30:40] to these things
[30:42] if god before us who can be against us
[30:46] he that spared not his own son but
[30:48] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[30:50] not with him also freely give us
[30:52] all things who shall lay anything to the
[30:56] charge
[30:56] of god's elect it is god
[31:01] that justifieth who is he that
[31:03] condemneth it is christ that died ye
[31:05] rather that has risen again
[31:06] who is even at the right hand of god who
[31:08] also maketh intercession for us
[31:10] i want to i want to focus on that verse
[31:12] 33 who shall lay anything to the charge
[31:14] of god's elect
[31:16] what is the devil's what is satan's
[31:17] title in heaven the accuser of the
[31:19] brethren
[31:20] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[31:22] god's elect why because he justified by
[31:26] faith and by faith amen
[31:29] he can only accuse us for unbelief
[31:32] but there's no unbelief in the bride
[31:37] i'm not talking about what we look at on
[31:39] the outside but i'm talking about that
[31:40] predestination see that's on the inside
[31:42] that was predestinated to come forth in
[31:44] this day amen it's not to come forth in
[31:46] unbelief it's not to come forth in a
[31:48] denominational age
[31:49] where the truth has not been restored
[31:51] amen it's not come and
[31:53] limited in growth because there's
[31:54] there's only so much light there's only
[31:56] so much of a portion
[31:57] but we've come to the hour of unlimited
[31:59] growth we've come into the hour of
[32:01] unlimited maturity
[32:02] we've come into the hour of unlimited
[32:04] light an unlimited word we've come to
[32:06] the full measure of the full word
[32:08] with the full revelation of christ the
[32:11] mystery of god
[32:12] revealed in this day under the seventh
[32:15] angels ministry
[32:16] so there's no more limiting factor on
[32:18] faith there's no more limiting factor on
[32:20] obedience through the word there's no
[32:22] more limiting factor on this bride to
[32:24] hold her back from being all that she's
[32:26] predestinated to be
[32:27] amen there's no more deception to keep
[32:29] her from coming to the full truth
[32:32] so there's going to be if there's
[32:33] there's a bride in this day
[32:35] that can accept the word of this age and
[32:37] as he reveals that word she keeps
[32:39] stepping forward in that word
[32:40] amen who can accuse her of sin who can
[32:43] lay anything to the charge of god's
[32:45] elect in this hour
[32:46] that'll take the full word of this hour
[32:49] and the full measure the word was
[32:50] delivered
[32:51] and say i believe it in the name of
[32:53] jesus christ i believe it
[32:58] who can lay anything to her charge amen
[33:00] who could accuse her of sin
[33:02] amen you may follow her around and say
[33:04] you know what the other day she said
[33:05] something against her husband and she
[33:07] got a little cross with her children
[33:08] and praise god
[33:12] amen
[33:15] you're not justified by works amen works
[33:17] are an expression of your faith but it's
[33:20] not your justification
[33:21] because it works for your justification
[33:23] amen then we would have to go back to
[33:24] the wesleyan day
[33:25] and work and work and work and be
[33:27] justified but we're justified by faith
[33:29] god first comes to us and say you're
[33:31] mine
[33:32] your mind your record's clear i've
[33:35] chosen you
[33:35] amen you are justified just as if you've
[33:38] never done it before
[33:39] and after he's called you and told you
[33:41] who you are you're my bride i'm uniting
[33:43] with you
[33:44] then he says now listen there's some
[33:45] things that i want to explain to you
[33:49] amen this is what i like and you say yes
[33:52] lord that's what i want to do
[33:53] this is what i like this is what i
[33:55] prefer this is the way i want you to
[33:58] to act and to dress and behave and you
[34:00] say absolutely lord
[34:01] not because i had to do that first but
[34:03] because first he told me who i was
[34:07] told me i'm justified by faith amen
[34:09] you're free
[34:10] from your sin you've been delivered from
[34:11] your sin and now you say oh god i love
[34:14] you
[34:15] take me i'm yours and then he says and
[34:17] sweetheart i like this and i prefer it
[34:20] this way
[34:22] and you say that's what i want to do
[34:24] that's the way i want to do it
[34:28] amen who can accuse
[34:32] her of sin she's been justified by faith
[34:35] but she's justified
[34:36] in this day she's justified by faith and
[34:38] wants she's justified by faith
[34:40] in the full word of god the seals have
[34:43] been taken off the book the whole bible
[34:45] has been opened up
[34:46] the whole book of redemption is in plain
[34:48] view amen god
[34:50] the mighty god has been unveiled amen
[34:52] it's not what it was in previous days
[34:54] this is a different day
[34:57] and it's going to bring different
[34:59] results
[35:01] brother bam says in the token
[35:05] i think it's important to note that
[35:06] brother branham preached the token
[35:08] after the seals and he said he couldn't
[35:11] preach it he said i've waited a long
[35:12] time to preach this message
[35:14] because when he's preaching token he's
[35:16] beginning to explain to us
[35:18] amen that there's been a transition
[35:21] that there's been something changed and
[35:24] and i'll just read this and
[35:26] pray god can help me share what's on my
[35:29] in the token he says what the life watch
[35:33] the life is took for the blood the life
[35:36] itself is took
[35:38] see the life it took for the blood see
[35:40] the blood was applied and the life could
[35:42] not come on the believer then
[35:44] for the life of the animal he's talking
[35:46] all the way back in the sacrifice and
[35:47] the passover
[35:48] amen there was a lamb that was slain and
[35:50] innocent one as a substitute
[35:52] and the chemistry of the blood was put
[35:53] over the lentil on the doorpost so that
[35:54] the death angel would know that there
[35:56] has been a lamb slain here
[35:58] amen but and then all the sacrifices
[36:00] were showing that the same thing that
[36:02] there was a substitutionary bloodshed
[36:04] for you for the sins of the people but
[36:06] now
[36:07] brother man when he comes to preach the
[36:08] token he's he's laboring
[36:11] on this fact that the life now is the
[36:13] token
[36:15] it's the life what life the same life
[36:18] that was in jesus christ
[36:19] come back into his bride and that is the
[36:22] token amen
[36:23] that is the evidence that the blood has
[36:25] been shed that is the evidence that the
[36:26] blood has been applied
[36:27] [Music]
[36:29] so he's preaching this after the seals
[36:32] because that's where he has to preach
[36:34] this
[36:35] see but see instead of a human being
[36:38] he's talking about jesus christ
[36:40] it was a super super superhuman being
[36:43] and that makes the human being now not
[36:45] only a human being
[36:47] but he's a son and daughter of god of
[36:49] the super super super super life that
[36:51] was in him
[36:52] come back upon you and changes you from
[36:55] a center
[36:55] and the things of the world a church
[36:57] member and a denominational goer to a
[36:59] born-again christian
[37:00] filled with the spirit the life of god
[37:02] just flowing through you
[37:04] like sparks from an anvil as you walk
[37:06] full of virtue and love and gentleness
[37:08] and as the holy spirit moving speaking
[37:10] oh my there you are
[37:12] and with that and with the what
[37:15] hearing the message watching the pillar
[37:17] of fire and the blessed assurance i
[37:19] passed from death in the life no
[37:22] therefore
[37:22] no condemnation at all
[37:27] this is what he's saying with the token
[37:28] amen and he would say
[37:30] he says in this same message he said it
[37:32] was the lamb and luther's day
[37:35] it was the lamb in wesley's day
[37:38] but now it's token time
[37:42] you say what is he talking about it's
[37:44] always been the baptism of the holy
[37:45] ghost it's always been the holy ghost
[37:47] and the believers
[37:48] but yes but it's always been portion
[37:51] portion of word portion of word portion
[37:54] of word
[37:55] and we know that the holy ghost has been
[37:56] bound
[37:58] bound and changed bound in these
[38:00] denominational rivers for nearly 2 000
[38:02] years
[38:03] amen but it's going to be loosed at the
[38:04] end time the holy spirit back upon the
[38:07] people
[38:07] what was loose the word was loosed and
[38:09] the word and the spirit are the same
[38:11] thing
[38:12] don't separate these things and separate
[38:14] them and divide them and say well i've
[38:16] got the word the
[38:17] the true word and the true spirit are
[38:19] one and the same
[38:21] and so when that word came back amen it
[38:24] was the
[38:24] it was the token it was the life now now
[38:27] that wasn't partial anymore
[38:28] he said it was the lamb in luther's day
[38:31] it was the lamb
[38:32] in wesley's day but now it's token time
[38:35] amen because there was a limitation
[38:39] in luther's day because the word was
[38:41] bound
[38:42] the word was limited there was a
[38:43] limitation in wesley's day amen it was
[38:46] the lamb
[38:46] amen and that's why there had to be a
[38:49] mediator back there on the throne to
[38:50] cover the sins of ignorance and then
[38:52] because the word wasn't opened yet
[38:55] but now he's saying there's a transition
[38:57] now it's token time
[38:59] now it's that life amen that life has
[39:01] come back on full display
[39:03] and now the life is for the token now
[39:05] it's the life that's on display
[39:09] so it's not it's not looking back
[39:11] there's no previous age involved
[39:13] amen this is a different time amen this
[39:16] is token time
[39:17] this is the time that the full life amen
[39:20] the the blood that was shed there was a
[39:21] price of redemption paid
[39:23] the blood has to be applied to you but
[39:25] the evidence of that blood being applied
[39:27] is that full life that was released at
[39:29] the opening of the seals
[39:30] as coming down upon the believer and
[39:32] it's not a partial
[39:34] understanding with a partial life it's a
[39:36] full understanding that brings the full
[39:40] life
[39:42] praise god
[39:47] therefore therefore
[39:50] no condemnation at all
[39:54] no condemnation at all you can't condemn
[39:59] what god has sealed and god has sealed
[40:02] those who believe
[40:04] because when when abraham received the
[40:07] seal
[40:08] of circumcision he sealed it because he
[40:10] believed god
[40:11] and god gave him a sign a token of his
[40:14] faith which was circumcision and now the
[40:17] token time the baptism of holy ghost
[40:20] is the seal or the evidence that you
[40:22] believe
[40:24] you believe god and he sealed you with
[40:25] his seal of promise you believed god and
[40:27] received the baptism the holy ghost
[40:29] because you believed so now
[40:32] no condemnation at all
[40:38] branham says in the invisible union of
[40:39] the bride of christ
[40:41] now your old book is gone with your old
[40:43] union
[40:45] now your name and your old has been
[40:48] transferred now
[40:49] do you do you mean to tell me that my
[40:52] old book god put it in the sea of
[40:53] forgetfulness
[40:54] you stand perfectly before god i want
[40:57] you to catch what the prophet saying
[40:59] he's talking in the invisible union of
[41:00] the bride of christ because we've come
[41:02] to the invisible union amen we've come
[41:05] to the headship uniting with the body
[41:07] like i said it's not like any other age
[41:09] this is the most threatening age to the
[41:11] devil that has ever been
[41:13] this is you are a bigger threat amen
[41:16] you are the biggest threat that is on
[41:18] earth at this time
[41:20] you are dangerous to his kingdom
[41:23] and that's why this word is coming this
[41:26] hour to bring a people
[41:27] to bring the elect in this hour to a
[41:29] position that's different
[41:31] than any other position because never
[41:33] before
[41:34] has he gone back and showed the whole
[41:36] plan of redemption
[41:38] it was being measured out it was being
[41:40] displayed through the bible
[41:41] through every character through every
[41:43] type through every shadow
[41:44] he was showing this plan but now in the
[41:47] end time he takes the cover off
[41:48] he peels the seals away and he goes back
[41:50] and he shows you exactly what he's been
[41:52] doing
[41:53] through the whole bible and even goes
[41:55] beyond that and shows you what's been in
[41:57] the mind of god before he even put a
[41:59] bible in print and before there was even
[42:01] a bible character on this earth amen
[42:03] this message has taken us back to the
[42:05] mind of god
[42:06] amen why
[42:10] so that there can be a people that will
[42:14] believe the full word of god
[42:15] [Applause]
[42:17] because it's essential for satan
[42:21] losing his position it's essential
[42:24] that there's a people who believes the
[42:25] full word and that he no longer can
[42:28] accuse the elect
[42:34] now he goes on to say an invisible union
[42:37] now your name is on the new book not the
[42:39] book of life but the lamb's book of life
[42:41] what the lamb redeemed not the old book
[42:43] of your natural union
[42:45] but your new bride hallelujah your new
[42:48] life is in the lamb's book of life
[42:50] your marriage certificate hallelujah
[42:54] is the book of life your marriage
[42:55] certificate was your name written there
[42:57] before the foundation of the world
[42:59] then what do you have to be worried
[43:00] about amen what what is all the struggle
[43:03] what is all the condemnation
[43:05] what is all about throw the condemnation
[43:07] away he
[43:08] chose you before the foundation of the
[43:10] world he has washed you in his own blood
[43:12] he has sealed you with his own life this
[43:14] is a day like no other day before
[43:16] there's no condemnation to the bride
[43:19] it doesn't mean that she won't fail it
[43:21] doesn't mean just like we watched with
[43:22] the wave sheep brother brennam's life
[43:24] he failed he he he had his wife lied to
[43:27] the lawyer
[43:27] he got a wrong spirit in the pulpit and
[43:30] said something harsh about a brother
[43:32] god corrected him right in the pool but
[43:34] he said i shouldn't have said that it's
[43:35] not that the outer man won't make a
[43:37] mistake
[43:37] but the life on the inside will take
[43:39] control
[43:42] hallelujah sometimes we won't even
[43:46] accept what the prophet says about the
[43:48] bride
[43:48] until we've come to a perfect life and
[43:51] never making a mistake
[43:52] and i tell you friends if you try to get
[43:53] to that place before you accept what's
[43:55] been told
[43:56] you will never get there and you will
[43:58] never be able to
[43:59] you'll never be able to circumvent
[44:00] condemnation in your life amen feeling
[44:02] like i never measure up and i'm never
[44:04] good enough
[44:05] because you're trying to attain amen to
[44:07] something in the flesh that's going to
[44:09] require the change in your flesh
[44:13] [Music]
[44:15] and we're going to try amen trying
[44:18] to be perfect and once somehow uh we
[44:21] don't say this out loud this is not in
[44:23] our main conscience but subconsciously
[44:25] we're saying when i can be perfect amen
[44:27] when there's no longer a fault in me
[44:29] amen then maybe i can say what the
[44:31] prophet said about me but i'm telling
[44:33] you if you believe you're the bride of
[44:35] jesus christ
[44:36] you can say what the prophet said about
[44:38] you this is the word of god
[44:40] this is the promise that's in the
[44:41] scripture amen there is now no
[44:43] condemnation to them that are in christ
[44:45] jesus
[44:45] [Applause]
[44:47] no condemnation then why do i feel so
[44:49] condemned because you're letting the
[44:51] devil play in your mind
[44:53] amen you're letting him lie to you and
[44:55] you're not taking the word of god and
[44:56] driving back the enemy
[44:59] you know you did that yesterday you say
[45:02] the flesh that i live in
[45:05] did that yesterday because
[45:08] listen let's listen to what the prophet
[45:10] says let's just take what he says
[45:14] your marriage certificate hallelujah
[45:16] where your true listen
[45:18] oh my goodness i can't hardly read it
[45:22] the old book of your natural union but
[45:23] your new bride hallelujah your new life
[45:26] is in the lamb's book of life
[45:27] your marriage certificate hallelujah
[45:29] where your true
[45:30] eternal germ from the beginning takes
[45:33] hold
[45:35] what you were meant to be from the
[45:37] beginning the real you the genuine you
[45:40] the portion of god that god has
[45:41] portioned out of himself that he's going
[45:43] to call son or daughter
[45:46] that's the genuine you that's the
[45:47] portion that was put in the lamb's book
[45:49] of life that's the portion that was put
[45:50] in the marriage certificate
[45:52] that's the portion that's never sinned
[45:53] that's the portion that can't sin
[45:56] [Music]
[45:59] oh if we could just identify with that
[46:01] friends we'd have so much overcoming
[46:03] power in our lives
[46:04] if we could just take what the word says
[46:05] take what the prophet says and forget
[46:07] everything else that floods through our
[46:09] mind and just stand upon the word
[46:13] where your true eternal germ from the
[46:15] beginning takes hold
[46:17] now you're not only forgiven but you're
[46:19] justified
[46:21] glory justified romans 5 1 said
[46:25] romans 5 therefore being justified by
[46:28] faith
[46:29] look up the word the word don't mean
[46:30] forgiven the word means justified
[46:32] it don't mean you're forgiven for
[46:35] instance you heard i got drunk and done
[46:37] some evil thing and everything
[46:38] then you come around say to me you found
[46:40] out i didn't do them
[46:42] then you come around you say brother
[46:43] branham i forgive you forgive me
[46:45] i didn't do it at the first place
[46:55] i'll say it this way your outer man
[46:57] needs forgiven
[47:00] your inner man never sinned in the first
[47:02] place
[47:07] praise god
[47:11] he said forgive me i didn't do it in the
[47:14] first place see
[47:16] now if i did do it i'm guilty but you
[47:18] could forgive me
[47:19] and i wouldn't be guilty but yet i'm not
[47:22] justified because i actually done it
[47:26] but the word justified is though you
[47:28] never
[47:29] done it amen when did he justify you
[47:33] before the foundation of the world the
[47:35] same time you were glorified
[47:40] i love the word of god
[47:46] but the word justified as though you've
[47:47] never done it
[47:50] it's not even regarded at all
[47:54] how is it done in god's book of the sea
[47:57] of forgetfulness your old book and
[47:58] marriage is divorced and dead
[48:00] it's not even in the memories of god
[48:02] amen you're justified
[48:03] therefore being justified it was accused
[48:07] you was accused you never done it in the
[48:10] first place
[48:13] you was accused of it you was accused of
[48:15] all kinds of things by the accuser of
[48:16] the brethren
[48:17] but in reality the germ of life that was
[48:20] to be you from the beginning
[48:22] never did it in the first place that's
[48:25] why you have to become a new creation
[48:27] that's why that germ of life under the
[48:29] baptism the holy ghost must spring to
[48:30] life and be a new creation
[48:32] because that new creation never did it
[48:34] in the first place
[48:35] not the old one made over not the old
[48:38] one amen patched up
[48:39] but a new life a new creation by the
[48:42] baptism of the holy ghost
[48:44] it never did it in the first place that
[48:46] seed comes to life
[48:49] now i'm going to go further in the
[48:50] invisible union
[48:54] he says the apostles them who set forth
[48:56] the bible
[48:57] here come luther out in reformation his
[48:59] words that his church won't
[49:01] his words his church won't work today
[49:04] wesley's won't pentecostals won't it
[49:06] worked in their day
[49:08] but it's another day this is the opening
[49:10] of the seven seals i know it sounds
[49:12] strange to you but god has vindicated it
[49:14] so perfectly
[49:15] there's no question in it just perfectly
[49:17] i ain't scattering that to the local
[49:19] assembly here
[49:20] i'm speaking to the people out across
[49:22] the nation see
[49:23] do what you wish to now notice the
[49:26] anointed word of this day of which you
[49:28] are apart by predestination
[49:31] you immediately like knew when you heard
[49:34] that you knew right quick that you was
[49:36] an eagle
[49:37] you also realized that you wasn't a
[49:38] denominational chicken to begin with
[49:40] you know there is something wrong there
[49:42] there is something wrong that's right
[49:43] for you know that you were trapped into
[49:45] it
[49:46] at the beginning he the bridegroom took
[49:49] away your shame
[49:50] and put it in the sea of forgetfulness
[49:52] by the washing of water
[49:54] of the word and the blood of life that's
[49:56] what the bible said your first husband
[49:58] that you were married to
[49:59] the world the anointed bridegroom which
[50:02] foreign you
[50:03] has washed you by the washing of the
[50:05] water by the church
[50:07] no that don't sound right does it you
[50:09] might find that in the almanac but not
[50:11] in god's bible by the washing
[50:12] of the water by the word in the word see
[50:16] you are standing completely justified as
[50:19] though you never
[50:20] did it at the beginning
[50:23] let's turn to ephesians chapter 5 for
[50:25] just a minute
[50:26] i'm going to look at this in the
[50:27] scriptures
[50:32] ephesians chapter 5
[50:38] and verse 25 ephesians 5 and 25
[50:43] husbands love your wives even as christ
[50:45] also loved the church
[50:46] and gave himself for it that he might
[50:49] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[50:51] of water
[50:52] by the word why
[50:55] what for that he might present it to
[50:59] himself a glorious church
[51:00] not having spot or wrinkle
[51:04] or any such thing but that it should be
[51:07] holy and without blemish
[51:12] whose goal was it to have a perfect
[51:14] church
[51:16] the church or christ
[51:19] whose plan was it yours or his
[51:22] whose accomplishment is it yours or his
[51:26] is it your accomplishment or his
[51:28] accomplishment if we're still trying to
[51:30] make it
[51:30] spotless and blameless amen and wrinkle
[51:33] free on our accomplishment we will fail
[51:35] all the time
[51:36] but if we let it be his accomplishment
[51:38] his goal
[51:39] his victory she is his victory and the
[51:42] purpose of his death
[51:44] but if we let it be his victory and then
[51:46] he brings the word amen by the washing
[51:48] of the water by the word
[51:50] he brings the word amen to bring the
[51:52] blood life to wash to wash
[51:54] everything away to wash all of the
[51:56] filthiness away
[51:57] all of the denominationalism away all of
[52:00] the unbelief away
[52:01] why because he wants to present to
[52:04] himself
[52:06] a spotless bride wrinkle free and
[52:08] blameless before him in love
[52:11] i tell you friends we have to keep that
[52:14] revelation
[52:15] constantly before us amen so that we
[52:17] don't get tripped up
[52:18] and trapped up in the identifying with
[52:20] the wrong identity
[52:23] now let's keep reading here you are
[52:26] standing completely justified as though
[52:28] you never did it at the beginning
[52:30] this is my message to the church now as
[52:32] we go off the air just in a minute you
[52:34] are standing
[52:35] if you're standing on god's word and
[52:36] with god's word every amen
[52:38] every jot every tittle where are you
[52:41] standing i'm trying to tell you
[52:42] pull away from them shucks and get out
[52:44] here in the wheat where you can get
[52:46] right before the sun
[52:47] i hear the coming of the combine you're
[52:49] standing complete
[52:50] justified like you never did it in the
[52:53] first place
[52:54] hallelujah you are the pure
[52:57] virtuous sinless bride of the son of the
[53:00] living god
[53:01] every man and woman that's born of the
[53:03] spirit of god and washed in the blood of
[53:04] jesus christ
[53:05] and believes every word of god stands as
[53:08] though you never
[53:09] sinned at the first place you are
[53:12] perfect
[53:14] no listen it's hard for us sometimes to
[53:17] say
[53:18] i am perfect it's hard for us to say i'm
[53:21] justified
[53:22] never did it in the first place i am
[53:23] perfect but listen to the criteria
[53:26] amen if you're born of the spirit of god
[53:28] amen
[53:29] you believe you're born of the spirit of
[53:31] god
[53:32] washed in the blood of jesus christ and
[53:34] believe every word of god
[53:38] amen can you say i believe the word of
[53:40] god i believe
[53:42] every word of god he showed me
[53:43] everything he's revealed i believe every
[53:45] word of god
[53:45] amen i have been washed by the blood of
[53:48] jesus christ and i've been baptized by
[53:50] his spirit
[53:51] if that's you you're perfect
[53:55] if that's you you're as though you never
[53:57] did it in the first place
[54:00] so it's hard for us to say i'm perfect
[54:03] amen there's no sin
[54:04] in me amen because we realize that in
[54:07] our flesh in our former life amen in our
[54:09] old
[54:10] union we had all kinds of unbelief we
[54:12] had all kinds of that stuff but he came
[54:13] to wash us from that
[54:15] and divorce us from that and put in the
[54:17] season's forgetfulness to bring out the
[54:19] true you the eternal germ that was from
[54:21] the inside
[54:21] to spring that to life
[54:25] so that so that you could be washed
[54:28] so you could be sanctified that you
[54:30] could be wrinkle free so you could be
[54:32] blameless before him
[54:33] in love
[54:36] now this is important because we have an
[54:40] accuser of the brethren
[54:43] and he's accusing them day and night
[54:46] amen
[54:46] he's the accuser of the brethren but
[54:49] that accuser of the brethren will be
[54:50] cast down
[54:53] but when will that accuser of the
[54:54] brother be cast down
[54:56] when the bride goes up when the bride
[54:59] goes up
[55:00] amen when when when you let this word
[55:03] carry you up when you let this word
[55:07] carry you up amen amen it stops the
[55:10] mouth of the accuser
[55:11] when you let the word by revelation lift
[55:13] you up
[55:14] to where you can see the plan of
[55:16] redemption with the ego's eyes you can
[55:18] begin to see
[55:19] i mean from before the beginning to the
[55:21] end and then you can realize
[55:23] i come from god i go to god amen god has
[55:26] washed me god has purified me god has
[55:28] quickened me to life
[55:29] amen then then he's put the old life in
[55:32] the sea of forgetfulness
[55:34] he separated me from my old husband i'm
[55:36] united now with christ
[55:38] washed and wrinkle free and blameless
[55:40] before him in love amen devil you can't
[55:42] accuse me anymore
[55:45] this is not a denominational age this is
[55:47] not a church age amen this is the bride
[55:49] age and i'm part of the bride and been
[55:51] baptized by the spirit of god believing
[55:53] the word of god for my day
[55:55] you have nothing to accuse me of because
[55:57] i believe
[56:00] and that life that's in me will lead me
[56:02] into all truth amen
[56:04] and if i act in a wrong way it's the
[56:07] thing that corrects me it's the thing
[56:08] that brings me back in line to the word
[56:10] it's the thing that snaps me back in
[56:12] place it's the control tower on the
[56:14] inside
[56:18] oh yeah you may may be able to tell me
[56:21] where i failed yesterday you may be able
[56:22] to tell me where i felt today
[56:24] but you can't call me an unbeliever amen
[56:26] you can't call me an unbeliever because
[56:28] i believe amen
[56:30] you can't tell me i don't believe this
[56:31] message because from the core of me
[56:33] i believe amen i believed the message
[56:35] before i understood it i believed it
[56:37] when i heard it amen something in me
[56:39] believed it
[56:42] something in me always believes it amen
[56:44] no matter how confused my mind gets no
[56:46] matter how
[56:46] troubled i get my spirit realm i'm still
[56:48] a believer on the inside
[56:52] and your devil can't call me an
[56:53] unbeliever amen you may be able to call
[56:55] me a bad believer call me a bad believer
[56:57] but i'm a believer
[57:01] you may say you're not a real good son
[57:03] that's okay i'm still a son
[57:05] [Music]
[57:08] the bride has to know her position and
[57:10] then she's changing positions from a
[57:11] church member
[57:12] she's changing positions from a
[57:13] denominational she's changing from a
[57:16] center to a saint
[57:17] she's changing amen but her
[57:19] understanding of who she is is changing
[57:22] and to her true identity her true
[57:24] eternal
[57:25] germ life from the beginning
[57:28] and that is the overcomer
[57:32] brother brenham said in the message
[57:33] recognizing your day and its message
[57:36] like israel back in her promised land
[57:39] she don't
[57:40] know how she got back there she was just
[57:42] automatically put back there why
[57:44] national forest put her in her place
[57:47] now i'm going to say something national
[57:49] forest put israel in her homeland
[57:51] national forest will put the church in
[57:53] the world council of churches
[57:54] but the power of god will put the people
[57:56] in the bride
[57:59] listen what he says the power of god
[58:00] will put the people in the bride
[58:02] the world forces this way and the world
[58:04] forces that way
[58:05] but god forces upward the spirit of god
[58:09] which is the word of god
[58:13] so don't just think i just said that the
[58:15] spirit of god which
[58:16] is the word of god my word is spirit and
[58:18] life will put the bride
[58:20] in her place amen what's putting the
[58:22] bride in her place the spirit of god
[58:24] what is it it's the revealed word of
[58:25] this hour is putting the bride in her
[58:28] place
[58:28] putting her in her position amen what is
[58:31] she amen
[58:32] she she she is bone of his bone
[58:35] flesh of his flesh life of his life
[58:37] spirit of his spirit
[58:38] who can lay anything to the charge of
[58:40] god's elect it is
[58:42] god that justified
[58:46] tell the accuser that he's coming down
[58:51] tell him that you found your position by
[58:53] the grace of god and by the word of this
[58:55] hour
[58:56] and as we find our position he loses his
[59:01] why do you think the devil fights you so
[59:04] hard
[59:06] why in your mind why with so much
[59:09] troubles why because he's losing his
[59:13] position
[59:14] friends
[59:17] and when he loses this position he'll
[59:20] never go back
[59:22] he's cast down amen from there he goes
[59:25] into a pit and chains
[59:26] amen for a thousand year reign amen then
[59:29] and then after that amen he's
[59:31] resurrected to bring back a final battle
[59:33] and he's completely completely
[59:34] completely completely annihilated
[59:37] he's holding on to the last threads of
[59:39] his position amen
[59:40] trying to keep the bride out of his her
[59:42] position but there's going to be an
[59:44] exchange of position
[59:46] and the exchange of position is already
[59:48] taking place the bride is going up word
[59:51] by word amen
[59:52] amen as this one catches it and this one
[59:54] catches it and this one catches it
[59:56] they're being lifted up
[59:57] out of the natural being lifted up out
[59:59] of the kernel
[1:00:00] and into the reality of who they really
[1:00:02] are and the accuser of the brethren is
[1:00:04] losing his right to accuse
[1:00:08] he's got maybe just a fingertip hold
[1:00:11] left on his position i'm telling you
[1:00:13] friends as we spread this word
[1:00:15] and find that last predestinated seed
[1:00:17] and they come to the realization of who
[1:00:19] they really
[1:00:20] are there is no accusation against the
[1:00:22] elect of god
[1:00:23] they've been washed by the water of the
[1:00:25] word amen they've been washed they've
[1:00:26] been sanctified they've been justified
[1:00:28] they've already been glorified
[1:00:31] and they're coming into the realization
[1:00:33] of it now
[1:00:35] so that they can't get pushed around by
[1:00:37] fear
[1:00:39] tossed around by all kinds of
[1:00:41] misconceptions
[1:00:43] you know one of the things that one of
[1:00:45] the things that the devil used to the
[1:00:47] denominational ages
[1:00:49] to try to trap the people in the
[1:00:50] denominations was fear
[1:00:53] fear of being wrong fear of not getting
[1:00:55] it right fear of well if you don't
[1:00:57] believe this way
[1:00:58] amen you won't be right and this church
[1:01:00] is right and you believe what just
[1:01:01] church believes
[1:01:02] amen that was a trap of the devil using
[1:01:05] fear
[1:01:05] so you could you needed you needed a
[1:01:08] church you needed a right teaching you
[1:01:10] needed a right minister in order to be
[1:01:12] right
[1:01:13] but in this last day he's taken that
[1:01:15] fear away he's brought a prophet in this
[1:01:17] day to tell you who you are
[1:01:19] and as an individual he reveals to you
[1:01:21] who you are you don't need a church to
[1:01:23] be right you don't need other people to
[1:01:24] be right
[1:01:25] you need a revelation of who you really
[1:01:27] are
[1:01:28] and god has brought a word amen to lift
[1:01:30] the bride out of spiritual amnesia
[1:01:32] to take all the deception away so she
[1:01:34] can see who she really is
[1:01:36] so the devil doesn't push her anymore by
[1:01:39] fear
[1:01:40] if you do that you're not a believer
[1:01:43] what do you mean if i do that i'm not a
[1:01:44] believer i'm a believer before i do that
[1:01:47] [Applause]
[1:01:50] come on devil i'm not falling for it i
[1:01:52] come from god
[1:01:53] i go back to god i'll never be lost amen
[1:01:56] and god is the one i love amen this word
[1:01:58] is the thing that i have a passion for
[1:02:00] amen and i will
[1:02:01] always submit myself to it
[1:02:07] he's used he's used fear fear of being
[1:02:10] wrong
[1:02:12] fear uh not uh being in deception fear
[1:02:16] but the bride can't be deceived the
[1:02:18] prophet said she can't be
[1:02:21] let the realization of who you really
[1:02:24] are
[1:02:25] transcend all fear don't let the devil
[1:02:27] motivate you and jump you through hoops
[1:02:29] and make you
[1:02:30] do all kinds of silly stuff and have all
[1:02:32] kinds of fear amen
[1:02:33] just just rest in the fact that he has
[1:02:35] called me
[1:02:37] how do you know because i believe
[1:02:40] it's not hard for me to believe i just
[1:02:42] believe
[1:02:44] i believe the word he's changed my life
[1:02:47] i mean i've received the baptism of holy
[1:02:49] ghost i believe the word i've been
[1:02:50] washed in the blood of jesus christ
[1:02:52] therefore according to the prophet of
[1:02:54] god and according to the word of god
[1:02:56] i am justified i am
[1:02:59] perfect amen i i never did it
[1:03:02] in the first place
[1:03:08] the spirit of god which is the word of
[1:03:12] god
[1:03:13] the word and spirit is life will put the
[1:03:14] bride in her place
[1:03:17] and as that word puts the bride in her
[1:03:19] place
[1:03:20] the devil loses his place
[1:03:26] he says we'll put the bride in her place
[1:03:28] because she'll recognize her position in
[1:03:29] the word
[1:03:31] then she's in christ we'll put her in
[1:03:33] her place no national force will do it
[1:03:35] but the national force did drive israel
[1:03:37] to the homeland the national force of
[1:03:39] the council of churches will drive every
[1:03:41] organization into it
[1:03:42] but the power of god will raise the
[1:03:44] bride into glory out of it
[1:03:47] let the power of god let the spirit of
[1:03:49] god the word of god
[1:03:51] put you in your position
[1:03:54] and when you get in your position the
[1:03:56] devil's losing his
[1:04:00] don't think don't think he'll let it go
[1:04:03] without a fight
[1:04:05] but fight back with the word don't fight
[1:04:08] back with more reasoning don't fight
[1:04:09] back with more thinking
[1:04:10] don't fight back with more willful
[1:04:12] effort just fight back with the word
[1:04:18] let's read ephesians chapter one
[1:04:20] together
[1:04:25] ephesians 1 and 3.
[1:04:33] ephesians chapter 1 verse 3 blessed be
[1:04:35] the god and father of our lord jesus
[1:04:37] christ who hath blessed us with all
[1:04:39] spiritual blessings
[1:04:40] in heavenly places in christ according
[1:04:43] as he has chosen us in him before the
[1:04:45] foundation of the world
[1:04:46] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:04:49] before him in love
[1:04:50] having predestinated us unto the
[1:04:52] adoption of children by jesus christ
[1:04:54] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:04:56] of his will
[1:04:57] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:05:00] wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:05:02] in the beloved in whom we have
[1:05:04] redemption through his blood the
[1:05:06] forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:05:07] riches of his grace
[1:05:09] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[1:05:11] all wisdom and prudence
[1:05:12] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:05:14] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:05:16] which he hath purposed in himself
[1:05:19] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:05:21] of time he might gather together and won
[1:05:23] all things in christ both which are in
[1:05:25] heaven and which are on earth
[1:05:27] even in him in whom also we have
[1:05:30] obtained an inheritance being
[1:05:31] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:05:33] of him
[1:05:34] who worketh all things after the counsel
[1:05:37] of his own will
[1:05:39] when i read through that scripture what
[1:05:41] i read is he did it
[1:05:43] he wanted it he did it for his purpose
[1:05:47] for his will and you're just the
[1:05:49] recipient
[1:05:50] of it you didn't have to earn it you
[1:05:53] didn't have to work for it
[1:05:54] he did it he did it of his own will
[1:05:58] he predestinated before you got to
[1:06:00] choose
[1:06:03] he did it for you he wanted it for you
[1:06:06] he wanted it for himself
[1:06:10] and we're the recipients of that and i
[1:06:12] say let the word of god put us

[1:08:17] foundation of the world

[1:08:19] foundation of the world when his great
[1:08:21] hidden mystery is great secret he chose
[1:08:24] us in christ before the foundation of
[1:08:26] the world that we should be holy
[1:08:27] and without blame before him and what
[1:08:30] love

[1:08:33] adoption of children by jesus christ
[1:08:35] to himself according to the good
[1:08:36] pleasure of his
[1:08:38] will predestinated there's the mystery
[1:08:42] he before christ or anything else was
[1:08:44] ever on earth you see his great mystery
[1:08:47] that he chose the bride knowing eve
[1:08:49] would fall
[1:08:50] from disbelieving the word knowing that
[1:08:52] she would fall
[1:08:53] but he would choose a bride that would
[1:08:55] not fall
[1:08:57] that would hold to that word regardless
[1:08:59] of what all the rest of the world had to
[1:09:01] say about it
[1:09:02] they would hold to that word they are
[1:09:04] predestined to stand there the adoption
[1:09:06] of children by jesus christ
[1:09:08] predestinated the church to that great
[1:09:10] glorious stand
[1:09:12] see he chose listen he chose you
[1:09:16] amen don't make this bride don't make
[1:09:18] this church
[1:09:19] make this personal he chose you
[1:09:23] before the foundation world knowing that
[1:09:25] eve would fall
[1:09:27] knowing that she would fall he had to
[1:09:29] choose one that wouldn't fall
[1:09:30] and you're part of that choice
[1:09:36] you've had opportunity to fall how many
[1:09:39] has that opportunity to fall how many
[1:09:40] has had opportunity disbelief how many
[1:09:42] had opportunity to walk away from the
[1:09:44] message
[1:09:45] but why couldn't you why couldn't you
[1:09:48] and others left
[1:09:49] why couldn't you when doubts came into
[1:09:50] your mind why couldn't you when hurtful
[1:09:52] things took place all around you why
[1:09:54] couldn't you leave amen because he
[1:09:56] predestinated you
[1:09:57] not to fall he predestinated you not to
[1:09:59] walk away from the word he predestinated
[1:10:01] you to make this glory stand in this day
[1:10:03] it's not your merit it's not your effort
[1:10:05] it's not your intelligence it's not your
[1:10:06] holiness
[1:10:07] amen it's not your ability to keep the
[1:10:09] word it's his choice before
[1:10:11] he knew there would be a day when the
[1:10:13] word would be restored he knew
[1:10:14] this is the day for satan to lose his
[1:10:17] position
[1:10:18] so he had to predestinate a portion of
[1:10:21] himself
[1:10:22] to act out the part in this day and that
[1:10:24] portion is the portion that's in you
[1:10:25] amen that is
[1:10:27] that was predestined to be you
[1:10:32] and that portion is predestinated not to
[1:10:34] fall not to fail
[1:10:35] amen it doesn't matter how many people
[1:10:37] walk away it doesn't matter
[1:10:39] how many people say what this that and
[1:10:41] the other how many hurtful things take
[1:10:43] place to you i mean how many
[1:10:45] members of your family and members of
[1:10:47] the church how many pastors or preachers
[1:10:49] hurt you
[1:10:50] it doesn't matter you've been
[1:10:51] predestinated not to fall
[1:10:53] you've been predestinated not to
[1:10:55] disbelieve you've been predestinated not
[1:10:57] to walk away
[1:11:00] why are you still here some of you have
[1:11:02] had ample opportunities
[1:11:05] ample opportunities but he's he had to
[1:11:07] predestinate one that would not fall
[1:11:10] because satan has got to come down he's
[1:11:13] got to be cast out of heaven amen and
[1:11:15] he's there as long as there's unbelief
[1:11:17] he's an accuser of their brethren but
[1:11:19] god predestinated some that would
[1:11:21] believe
[1:11:23] and they're having a change of position
[1:11:28] she goes up he comes down
[1:11:34] i'm going to keep reading the adoption
[1:11:36] of children by jesus christ
[1:11:37] predestinated the church to that great
[1:11:39] glorious stand
[1:11:40] now you see his secret this is the
[1:11:43] secret and the secret is you
[1:11:46] the secret is in you this great mystery
[1:11:49] that he had before the foundation of the
[1:11:51] world
[1:11:51] because he knew that eve would fall but
[1:11:53] he knew there would be one that was
[1:11:55] restored
[1:11:56] so he predestinated the restoring
[1:12:01] now you see a secret what too to restore
[1:12:03] fallen eve
[1:12:04] as she was a prefigure of the church and
[1:12:06] now notice as god
[1:12:08] opened up the sight of adam and took out
[1:12:10] eve by his own flesh and blood
[1:12:12] and divided his spirit from masking the
[1:12:13] feminist to finish and put it
[1:12:15] in feminist and put it in eve took the
[1:12:17] rib from under his side and made eve out
[1:12:19] of it
[1:12:19] so god did the same thing taking out of
[1:12:21] the side of christ the blood and the
[1:12:23] water
[1:12:24] and christ is the word and taking the
[1:12:26] word and making up his church
[1:12:28] eve see back to himself again
[1:12:32] what's he taking he's taking the word
[1:12:35] and he's putting eve back to himself
[1:12:38] again
[1:12:38] by what by the word
[1:12:42] christ is the word and taking the word
[1:12:44] and making up his church evec
[1:12:45] back to himself again redeemed by the
[1:12:48] blood that was come from his body you
[1:12:49] see it now
[1:12:51] god's great masterpiece now being
[1:12:53] unfolded
[1:12:54] that's been hid since the foundation of
[1:12:56] the world but prefigured it all the way
[1:12:58] down
[1:12:59] through in order for god to restore
[1:13:03] fallen eve eve fell
[1:13:07] what did he fall from she fell from
[1:13:09] disbelieving the word
[1:13:11] she fell from the word so what did she
[1:13:13] fall from she fell from the word
[1:13:16] so in order to make sure there was an
[1:13:17] eve restored first he had to restore the
[1:13:20] word
[1:13:21] because he couldn't receive restore eve
[1:13:23] until he restored the word
[1:13:25] because she fell from the word then the
[1:13:27] word went into obscurity amen
[1:13:29] and become lost because of because of
[1:13:32] nicolaitanism and because of man's ideas
[1:13:34] and because of all of man's concepts
[1:13:36] amen but now god in the end time had to
[1:13:38] bring back the word
[1:13:39] when he brings back the word now he can
[1:13:42] restore the woman amen because she's
[1:13:43] restored by the word
[1:13:45] and she's restored by believing by
[1:13:47] accepting what eve turned down
[1:13:49] what did eve turn down the word amen and
[1:13:52] he comes back
[1:13:53] who comes back the word and he comes
[1:13:56] back and we accept it amen
[1:13:58] we believe it and we say i want it and i
[1:14:00] don't want to leave it and i don't want
[1:14:02] any other means to bring about anything
[1:14:04] else i just want this word
[1:14:08] eve was deceived amen she was deceived
[1:14:11] but she left the word
[1:14:13] she was beguiled but she left an
[1:14:15] unbelief so god now has restored the
[1:14:17] word
[1:14:18] and after he restored the word see
[1:14:20] restoring the word didn't finish the
[1:14:21] work because his goal was to restore
[1:14:23] eve he always wanted a bride of his own
[1:14:26] choosing that was his work from the
[1:14:28] beginning
[1:14:29] that was his desire from the beginning
[1:14:31] he knew that he would fall because it
[1:14:33] played out
[1:14:33] a drama that would show all his
[1:14:36] attributes of savior
[1:14:37] amen and father and redeemer and healer
[1:14:40] amen so we could learn
[1:14:42] who god really is but his plan from the
[1:14:46] beginning
[1:14:46] was to have a bride that would be just
[1:14:48] like him that would believe his word
[1:14:50] so he knew from the foundation of the
[1:14:53] world that he was going to restore the
[1:14:54] word
[1:14:56] but when he restored the word he wasn't
[1:14:58] done yet because he had
[1:14:59] the lifted the word up so that he could
[1:15:02] draw the bride to the head
[1:15:04] and unite the head and the body together
[1:15:06] as one
[1:15:07] to restore fallen ever now we're being
[1:15:11] united
[1:15:12] to the word and what eve turned down
[1:15:17] he came back amen who's he
[1:15:20] the word jesus christ our husband our
[1:15:23] bridegroom
[1:15:24] and we accept it and when we keep
[1:15:29] preaching the word and drawing the seed
[1:15:33] she keeps getting lifted up and put back
[1:15:35] in position by the word
[1:15:38] no national force no other force
[1:15:41] no church pressure no denominational
[1:15:45] force we're put in position
[1:15:46] but the spirit of god which is the word
[1:15:48] of god will put her back in a position
[1:15:51] simply believing what he said
[1:15:54] about her puts her back in position
[1:15:58] simply just accepting what he said who
[1:16:00] he said
[1:16:01] who he said you really are what your
[1:16:03] true identity is the condition he's put
[1:16:05] you in by the washing of the water of
[1:16:07] the word
[1:16:07] what he's called you he's called you
[1:16:09] justified he's called you sinless he's
[1:16:11] called you virtuous
[1:16:12] he's called you flesh of his flesh and
[1:16:14] bone of his bones how do you get in
[1:16:15] position let the word put you in
[1:16:17] position
[1:16:18] you we're not climbing a ladder friends
[1:16:21] we're not climbing a ladder of works
[1:16:22] we're not climbing a ladder
[1:16:24] of degrees amen measured out degrees by
[1:16:26] somehow accomplishment to get there
[1:16:28] just let the word put you in position
[1:16:31] and the word says you are justified amen
[1:16:33] the word
[1:16:34] says you never did it in the first place
[1:16:35] the word says you are the sinless
[1:16:37] spotless virtuous bride of the lord
[1:16:39] jesus christ
[1:16:41] the word says you never did it in the
[1:16:42] first place just take him at his word
[1:16:46] let the word put you in position
[1:16:49] and the devil will lose his
[1:16:53] i want to end by reading colossians 1 26
[1:16:56] we've read it several times
[1:16:58] even the mystery which has been hid from
[1:17:01] ages and from generations
[1:17:03] but now was made manifest to his saints
[1:17:05] to whom god would make known
[1:17:07] what is the riches of the glory of this
[1:17:08] mystery among the gentiles
[1:17:10] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:17:15] this is the mystery this is the mystery
[1:17:18] this is the finishing of the mystery
[1:17:20] this is the completion of the work this
[1:17:22] is him putting his bride in position the
[1:17:24] one
[1:17:24] he fell but this is the one that's
[1:17:26] designated not to fall
[1:17:28] this is the one that's predestinated not
[1:17:30] to fall and what's putting in her
[1:17:32] position
[1:17:32] the word not i tried and i'm trying and
[1:17:36] i just keep trying
[1:17:38] you're just going to get really tired
[1:17:41] but just by saying
[1:17:42] something in me says that's the truth
[1:17:45] i don't deserve it i haven't earned it i
[1:17:48] can't accomplish it
[1:17:50] my merit my merit won't get it there but
[1:17:52] i
[1:17:53] know that that's the truth amen and i
[1:17:55] know that prophet is vindicated and i
[1:17:57] know that that's the scripture and
[1:17:58] something in me says
[1:17:59] that's thus saith the lord and if he
[1:18:02] said that about me
[1:18:03] i'm going to say amen
[1:18:06] and let the word put me in position and
[1:18:09] the devil
[1:18:10] no matter what he accuses and no matter
[1:18:12] how much he's accusing
[1:18:13] he can't lay anything to the charge of
[1:18:16] god's
[1:18:16] life it is god that justified
[1:18:19] why did he justify me with faith by
[1:18:22] faith
[1:18:22] i believed it was wrecking unto me and
[1:18:25] puted unto me
[1:18:26] for righteousness abraham
[1:18:30] didn't always get it right but he
[1:18:31] believed right
[1:18:34] he believed god whatever god said he
[1:18:36] believed it amen
[1:18:37] and god had the ability to steer him god
[1:18:39] had the ability to put him in position
[1:18:41] god had ability to raise him up and i
[1:18:44] say god we may not always get it right
[1:18:46] but by your grace we believe right
[1:18:49] we can't help it we just believe your
[1:18:51] word we accept it for what you said
[1:18:53] and if you say that about me i'm not
[1:18:55] foolish enough to disagree with you
[1:18:57] amen but i'll say amen if you say i'm
[1:19:00] virtuous and sinless and spotless why
[1:19:02] i'll say amen i'm not going by what my
[1:19:06] eyes see i'm not going by what my mind
[1:19:08] understands my my reasoning my memory my
[1:19:10] consciousness
[1:19:10] but i'm basing it purely on faith in
[1:19:13] your word
[1:19:13] that you have the right to say whatever
[1:19:15] you want about me and if that's what you
[1:19:17] say
[1:19:18] i say amen
[1:19:22] and i say take that devil
[1:19:25] next time you come along and with your
[1:19:27] accusations i'll just point you back to
[1:19:29] the word
[1:19:30] being justified freely
[1:19:33] i've been justified why because he's
[1:19:35] given me the ability to believe the word
[1:19:38] he sealed me by his own life and his own
[1:19:40] spirit i believe the word of god
[1:19:42] i've been called by a prophet in this
[1:19:44] day perfect
[1:19:47] just as if i've never done it amen
[1:19:50] there's nothing on your record book
[1:19:54] it's been wiped off
[1:19:58] my marriage certificate was sealed
[1:19:59] before the foundation of the world
[1:20:02] and that marriage certificate has been
[1:20:03] opened to me so that i could read my
[1:20:05] name in the book
[1:20:07] and when i read that my name was on the
[1:20:09] marriage certificate
[1:20:11] i wasn't worried anymore i realized i'd
[1:20:14] already made it
[1:20:16] in the mind of god i'd already made it
[1:20:20] let's all stand
[1:20:24] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:20:28] to them that are in christ jesus
[1:20:32] don't don't get out of position friends
[1:20:37] the only way for this bride to get out
[1:20:39] of position is to disbelieve
[1:20:41] the word you know it
[1:20:45] i've said it before but i just want to
[1:20:47] labor on it for just a minute because i
[1:20:48] know
[1:20:49] this is a temptation it's a trial maybe
[1:20:51] not for everybody but for some this is a
[1:20:53] hard trial
[1:20:55] but we have to believe the word
[1:20:59] this this bride has to believe all the
[1:21:01] word
[1:21:03] and if the devil can start to make you
[1:21:05] doubt what god says about you
[1:21:08] you're disbelieving the word
[1:21:12] if the devil can throw circumstances and
[1:21:15] and start to show you your
[1:21:16] failures in the flesh and your outer
[1:21:18] realm of faults and failures and
[1:21:21] genetic things that were left over from
[1:21:23] mom or dad and he begins to show you all
[1:21:25] of these things
[1:21:26] and it causes you to doubt your position
[1:21:28] in christ
[1:21:29] when he has already revealed to you who
[1:21:31] you are he has already told you through
[1:21:33] a prophet who you are
[1:21:34] and then you realize that is unbelief
[1:21:38] and so we've got to come to a place
[1:21:40] where it says even if i don't
[1:21:42] feel like it amen by the revelation he's
[1:21:44] given me of who i am
[1:21:45] i will say what the word says about me
[1:21:49] that i am justified amen i have been
[1:21:52] sanctified
[1:21:53] i have been washed by that water amen
[1:21:55] i've been cleansed by the blood
[1:21:57] i've been sealed by his own life amen
[1:21:59] and now there is no
[1:22:00] fault there's nothing nobody can lay any
[1:22:02] charge to god's
[1:22:03] leg i'm guiltless i'm justified
[1:22:07] not by my merit not by the actions but
[1:22:09] by my faith in the word
[1:22:10] i will believe what he said and i will
[1:22:13] no longer allow the accuser of the
[1:22:15] brethren
[1:22:15] the devil to get me to say something
[1:22:17] different than what the word says
[1:22:22] do you understand this is important
[1:22:26] this isn't just well this isn't just a
[1:22:28] pep talk friend
[1:22:29] this isn't just a rally to try to get
[1:22:31] you excited and do better or feel better
[1:22:33] about yourself this is a living reality
[1:22:35] that some people
[1:22:36] struggle with on a daily basis but we've
[1:22:38] got to be able to say
[1:22:40] i don't care how i feel i don't care how
[1:22:42] many doubts are in my mind
[1:22:44] there's something deeper than my mind
[1:22:46] that says it's true
[1:22:47] it's true it was always true it will
[1:22:49] always be true
[1:22:53] that i am because as long as the devil
[1:22:56] can get you to confess the wrong thing
[1:22:58] his position is clear
[1:23:00] but the word is putting you in your
[1:23:02] position let the word put you in your
[1:23:04] position
[1:23:04] not your own thoughts not the lies of
[1:23:06] the enemy but let the word put you in
[1:23:08] position
[1:23:10] and as you get in position the accuser
[1:23:12] of the brethren has nothing to accuse
[1:23:13] you of because you believe the word
[1:23:17] and when the bride goes up he comes down
[1:23:23] i say lord let me keep climbing higher
[1:23:26] in revelation
[1:23:27] let my revelation climb so high until
[1:23:29] this flesh can no longer keep up
[1:23:32] and my very atoms change amen we take a
[1:23:36] dimensional shift
[1:23:38] just keep climbing keep confessing keep
[1:23:40] believing
[1:23:41] don't let the devil lie anymore
[1:23:46] when you say but you know i tried and i
[1:23:49] failed and i tried
[1:23:51] just quit trying and start believing
[1:23:54] start confessing and let the word put
[1:23:57] you in position
[1:23:59] maybe the reason you're failing so much
[1:24:00] is because you're trying too much
[1:24:05] you say i tried and i failed and i tried
[1:24:07] for the channel i failed and i tried
[1:24:08] again and i failed
[1:24:09] well of course because you tried
[1:24:15] aren't i supposed to try oh there's
[1:24:16] nothing wrong with with with
[1:24:18] wanting to serve god and obey the word
[1:24:20] of god but once you start believing
[1:24:23] once you start confessing once you start
[1:24:25] saying what the word says
[1:24:26] and let the word put you in position and
[1:24:29] let the word wash you
[1:24:30] let the word sanctify you let the word
[1:24:32] convince you let the word
[1:24:34] amen be your whole life let the word put
[1:24:37] you in position not your trying
[1:24:40] if trying hard got things right then
[1:24:43] when you got tired of trying hard you're
[1:24:45] going to get it wrong
[1:24:48] so just believe say god if you said i'm
[1:24:51] perfect
[1:24:52] i'll say amen if
[1:24:56] and why because that's what
[1:24:59] he wanted
[1:25:03] he wanted a spotless bride
[1:25:08] wrinkle free and blameless before him in
[1:25:11] love
[1:25:11] he wanted to present that to himself
[1:25:15] see so many times the devil will trip us
[1:25:17] up with religion
[1:25:19] and will say things like i just want to
[1:25:21] serve god so bad
[1:25:23] i'm trying so hard somehow the devil has
[1:25:27] tricked you to get yourself in the
[1:25:28] middle
[1:25:30] somehow the devil has tricked you to
[1:25:32] think that somehow
[1:25:34] you can do something like or you like
[1:25:37] you even ought to be able to do
[1:25:39] something
[1:25:41] that's deception friends you're getting
[1:25:45] yourself
[1:25:46] in front of the word of god and you're
[1:25:48] putting your desire to want to serve god
[1:25:51] above his desire to want you to present
[1:25:54] you to himself
[1:25:57] so quit quit saying religious things
[1:26:00] like i just want so bad
[1:26:02] to serve god i just want no matter how
[1:26:04] bad you wanted it he had to want it
[1:26:05] worse
[1:26:06] and he had to want it first and if he
[1:26:08] didn't want it it doesn't matter how bad
[1:26:09] you want it
[1:26:13] this is religious talk just drop the
[1:26:16] religious talk and says there's not a
[1:26:17] thing in this world i can do
[1:26:19] if he doesn't do it for me i will fail
[1:26:21] utterly fail
[1:26:22] i will be absolutely ruined but i
[1:26:24] believe that he did it before
[1:26:26] i believe it was on the book and i
[1:26:28] believe that that word is true
[1:26:29] and that word's going to put me in
[1:26:30] position so i'm going to say what the
[1:26:32] word says
[1:26:37] praise god i could go on all night but
[1:26:39] you get the point
[1:26:42] say what the word says and let the devil
[1:26:46] lose his position
[1:26:49] let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus
[1:26:54] i thank you god for this word
[1:26:57] lord there's not a thing in this world
[1:26:59] we could do to save ourselves
[1:27:02] there's no way lord in this hybrid
[1:27:04] condition
[1:27:06] that come from a fall in the garden
[1:27:07] could we ever wrap this
[1:27:09] man into obedience to your word could we
[1:27:12] ever through willpower
[1:27:14] or sheer determination ever be good
[1:27:17] enough
[1:27:17] [Music]
[1:27:19] but god you didn't expect us
[1:27:22] to be able to in our own efforts
[1:27:25] that's why you sent your word in this
[1:27:27] day to tell us who we really
[1:27:28] are to take us back before our existence
[1:27:32] in the flesh
[1:27:33] to explain to us lord how we got this
[1:27:35] condition
[1:27:36] and why it will never work and why it
[1:27:38] must be changed lord you come to bring
[1:27:40] us so much
[1:27:41] understanding so that we wouldn't rely
[1:27:42] upon self but we would learn to rely
[1:27:45] upon your word
[1:27:47] god forgive us for our religious talk
[1:27:50] forgive us for our foolish
[1:27:52] foolish talking and thinking lord help
[1:27:54] us to lay all that aside now
[1:27:56] and help us to learn to stand only on
[1:27:59] your word
[1:28:00] if your word says i am free i'm free if
[1:28:03] your word says i'm healed i'm healed
[1:28:06] if your word says i'm your bride i'm
[1:28:08] your bride
[1:28:11] lord i pray god that that word would put
[1:28:13] your seed into position as you promised
[1:28:15] it would
[1:28:16] strip away the devil's lies lord he's an
[1:28:20] accuser
[1:28:21] but he's got nothing to accuse the bride
[1:28:23] of because she believes
[1:28:26] god i ask that you would just strip away
[1:28:29] all of self that we'd quit looking at
[1:28:32] self relying on self
[1:28:33] letting self trip us up and then we just
[1:28:36] surrender ourselves and die
[1:28:39] and let you live have your way in us
[1:28:42] lord we pray
[1:28:44] bless us as we go from here lord the
[1:28:46] roads may have snow
[1:28:47] or ice on them and i just pray that you
[1:28:49] would protect each one lord
[1:28:51] we've come here lord in obedience to
[1:28:53] your word we've come here to hear from
[1:28:55] you
[1:28:56] because we love you we're asking lord
[1:28:58] that you would protect us and watch over
[1:28:59] us on the way home
[1:29:01] that you would let us be bright in
[1:29:03] shining lights in this dark world
[1:29:05] god bless us now we pray in jesus
[1:29:08] christ's name
[1:29:10] amen the blessing says
[1:29:14] it's already done

[1:29:45] it's already
[1:29:53] [Music]
[1:29:59] the battle is over
[1:30:03] the victory is one
[1:30:07] it's already mine i'm already his

[1:31:44] you know this message tonight may have
[1:31:48] been for one person in here
[1:31:50] maybe two three i don't know it doesn't
[1:31:52] matter
[1:31:53] [Music]
[1:31:54] but if you're that one person you know
[1:31:56] who you are
[1:31:58] and if that's you i say put this issue
[1:32:01] to rest tonight
[1:32:04] because it's keeping you from the
[1:32:05] greater works it's keeping you from
[1:32:07] fulfilling your purpose it's keeping you
[1:32:09] from the commission
[1:32:10] the very reason you were predestinated
[1:32:12] and it was not so that you could
[1:32:13] struggle
[1:32:13] all your life with whether and you're
[1:32:15] not whether you're good enough whether
[1:32:16] you're
[1:32:16] one of his or not amen but let him
[1:32:18] answer that question for you so that you

[1:33:03] mouth they say i
[1:33:04] am perfect by the grace of god amen by
[1:33:06] the blood of jesus christ
[1:33:08] i am perfect he sees me as perfect
[1:33:14] i've repented i've given him my life
[1:33:16] amen i'm his
[1:33:18] but he told me that i'm flesh of his
[1:33:21] flesh
[1:33:22] life of his life bone of his bone
[1:33:25] that he loves me that he's washed me by
[1:33:27] the word that he's not depending on me
[1:33:30] to make it but he said he would make it
[1:33:31] through me
[1:33:34] i say make this the night where you say
[1:33:36] i'm not going to let the devil whip me
[1:33:38] around anymore
[1:33:39] i'm going to believe what god has said
[1:33:44] i'm going to believe it and when the
[1:33:46] devil comes in again
[1:33:47] i'm going to i'm going to resist him in
[1:33:49] the name of jesus christ with the word
[1:33:51] and send him running because if i resist
[1:33:53] the devil he
[1:33:55] will flee
[1:33:55] [Music]
[1:33:59] the devil will lie to you listen i
[1:34:02] know i know without a shadow of a doubt
[1:34:04] this is for somebody because god won't
[1:34:05] let me stop
[1:34:06] the devil will lie to you and tell you
[1:34:08] that somehow it's
[1:34:09] pious to keep wondering keep searching
[1:34:12] keep asking yourself am i right am i not
[1:34:14] somehow that's pious that's religious
[1:34:17] that's showing a sincerity
[1:34:18] no it's not it's showing a lack of faith
[1:34:21] it's letting the devil steal and rob you
[1:34:24] from everything that god has given you
[1:34:26] take your joy take your peace take your
[1:34:28] ability to be a real threat to his
[1:34:30] kingdom
[1:34:30] amen but don't let him do that anymore
[1:34:32] it's not pious it's not religious
[1:34:34] it's not proof that you're a saint it
[1:34:36] doesn't show that you have a greater
[1:34:37] desire than somebody else to serve god
[1:34:39] because i want to i want to make sure i
[1:34:41] want to make sure just make sure this
[1:34:43] word is true
[1:34:44] and if you're sure this word is true say
[1:34:46] what the word says
[1:34:50] it's not a greater religious piety amen
[1:34:53] it's a handicap
[1:34:54] it's the devil holding you back
[1:35:00] if i were you i'd get upset
[1:35:02] [Music]
[1:35:03] about the devil trying to change my
[1:35:06] identity from what the prophet gave me
[1:35:10] by the devil trying to take me out of my
[1:35:12] position when the word has already put
[1:35:14] me in position
[1:35:17] i would resist that devil if i were you
[1:35:20] and if you resist the devil
[1:35:21] he will flee it's not a higher order of
[1:35:25] religious
[1:35:27] religion it's not a higher order of
[1:35:29] sincerity
[1:35:30] it's a lack of faith
[1:35:34] say god i'm not i'm not going to do this
[1:35:37] anymore
[1:35:38] i'm accepting what you said about me i'm
[1:35:41] believing what you revealed to me
