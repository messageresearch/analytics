[0:00] And continuing in this same sermon, this
[0:02] is the very first quote. This is this is
[0:04] the start of the message right here.
[0:05] Thank you, brother Herman. I've just
[0:07] been sitting here drinking in and you
[0:08] know, I appreciate it very much. And
[0:09] before we go any further, I'm just it
[0:11] just we overlooked it. I think this was
[0:13] a wonderful little breakfast that these
[0:15] people served us here this morning. I've
[0:16] eaten breakfast around the world, you
[0:17] know, and different nations. That was
[0:19] real nice little breakfast. I believe it
[0:21] would be as we are Christian gentlemen
[0:23] and ladies to leave a little a little
[0:25] something lay on the table for those
[0:26] nice little ladies. How nice they served
[0:28] us. You know, if you'd have a little,
[0:30] you know, it's American custom, I think,
[0:32] that we leave them a little something on
[0:33] the
[0:35] table. And in his very closing remark,
[0:40] this is the end. He had his closing
[0:42] prayer, the final, he says, now don't
[0:45] forget the sisters tips on the table if
[0:47] you will, and God be with you until we
[0:49] meet again. All right. God bless you.
[0:52] Thoughtful,
[0:56] it's simple. Amen. But let's continue on
[1:00] here.
[1:02] God's such a gentleman. Uh yeah, I'd
[1:05] like to be that, too. I'd like to have
[1:07] that in my life. You may say, "Well,
[1:10] brother Ron, this is too simple. There's
[1:11] no revelation. You haven't mentioned the
[1:13] seals. You haven't mentioned the coming
[1:14] of the Lord. Uh I think when the Lord
[1:16] comes, I think he's going to be this
[1:18] way."
[1:19] Have you recognized him?
[1:22] Did you miss it? Uh maybe this doesn't
[1:26] uh stir you up, inspire you. Maybe
[1:29] you're the one that needs to watch how
[1:30] you park
[1:32] and your tipping
[1:39] habits. Luke 11:42. But woe unto you
[1:42] Pharisees, for ye tithe mint and rue and
[1:45] all manner of herbs, and Passover
[1:47] judgment, the love of God, these ought
[1:49] you to have done, and not to leave the
[1:51] other undone. So yeah, let's uh let's
[1:54] pay attention to the big things, but
[1:56] don't forget the little things. Amen.
[1:59] What what good is it if we understand
[2:01] all the mysteries, right? and our
[2:04] habits, our parking habits is kind of
[2:07] suffering. Our uh traffic uh courtesy
[2:11] out on the road, cutting somebody off,
[2:14] not being considerate.
[2:16] Uh our the Christian character, the life
[2:19] of
[2:20] Christ, I don't believe, now this is
[2:23] just opinion, I guess, so take it for
[2:25] what it's worth. I don't think the life
[2:27] of Christ is displayed on the knowledge
[2:28] we have of this message, the Bible. Uh
[2:32] those things are good. They go with it.
[2:36] But we don't want to underemphasize
[2:38] those things. And and this is what Jesus
[2:40] is saying. He says the love of uh you
[2:43] passed over these other big things. You
[2:45] ought to have done those, but don't
[2:47] forget the little things.
