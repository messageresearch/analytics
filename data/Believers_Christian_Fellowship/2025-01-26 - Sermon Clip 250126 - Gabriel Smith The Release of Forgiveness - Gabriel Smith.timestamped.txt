[0:00] just remember take up your cross
[0:03] daily and follow
[0:06] me and the cross that he's talking cuz
[0:10] he was the innocent
[0:12] one he did nothing a Miss he did not
[0:16] deserve what happened to him it was my
[0:19] sins and your sins that put him there
[0:21] and listen whatever happened to you you
[0:25] have to come to that place and go I did
[0:27] nothing a miss
[0:30] many times we'll spend years blaming
[0:31] ourselves it was my
[0:34] fault they'll twist things and you don't
[0:37] get up in your mind and you think it
[0:41] no I had to sit across the
[0:44] table of that little itty bitty
[0:48] boy and I had to say Gabriel Smith it
[0:52] wasn't your
[0:56] fault you are innocent
[1:01] and when I did that it gave me such
[1:10] Freedom it gave me such
[1:13] Liberty to say it was not my
[1:19] fault and when you do that then you know
[1:23] what then I could I could really
[1:25] understand what Calvary was cuz I could
[1:27] really say yes Lord I don't need them
[1:30] I don't need them to apologize to
[1:34] me that's right cuz I'm forgiving
[1:40] them
[1:41] I I because I am a
[1:46] Christian I am Christlike that's right
[1:50] and I am forgien I'm not cutting him off
[1:52] never to talk to him again but I'm
[1:54] releasing them and what that does it's
[1:57] really empowering because what you say
[2:00] is I am going to pay the
[2:05] price is that not what Steph said when
[2:09] he was being stoned all he was doing was
[2:11] standing for the gospel and he was being
[2:13] an intercessor and he said Lord lay it
[2:15] not to their
[2:17] charge and and and and Paul Paul was
[2:21] standing there holding the
[2:25] coats but what he was doing was being an
[2:28] intercessor he was mediating
[2:30] he was portraying Christ and when we
[2:33] catch a revelation and we understand
[2:36] when we can go back to when we was a 6 8
[2:38] 10 12 year old little boy or girl and
[2:41] the most horriblest things happened to
[2:44] us and we was broken as broken could
[2:49] be but the whole you say brother Gabe I
[2:52] can't do
[2:53] it we can't that's right in our own
[2:58] selves that's right we
[3:01] cannot listen friend
[3:03] I I I know what pain
[3:07] is and I know what Brokenness
[3:10] is but I also know what freedom and
[3:13] liberty is and there is such a peace
[3:16] that happens when you're able to lay at
[3:21] that cross and
[3:24] say
[3:25] father forgive them amen
