[0:01] He says now just like a little dew
[0:03] drop. He said if I understand I don't
[0:06] know too much about chemistry but it
[0:08] must be that it's the congealing of
[0:10] humidity or atmosphere and when the
[0:12] night gets cold and dark it falls from
[0:14] heaven and drops upon the ground. It's
[0:16] fell from
[0:18] somewhere. Listen, I love this because
[0:20] he's talking about you. Amen.
[0:23] This little dew drop on a blade of grass
[0:25] in the morning. He said it fell from
[0:27] somewhere. It existed somewhere else.
[0:30] But I want you to understand this. It
[0:32] existed somewhere else in another form.
[0:34] Amen. It was vapor in another form. Now
[0:37] it's changed form to come into a
[0:39] manifestation upon the earth. He's
[0:41] talking about you.
[0:44] And he says, "I don't understand the
[0:45] chemistry of this." Now he's talking
[0:47] about uh uh mechanically. He doesn't
[0:49] understand the chemistry of the dew
[0:50] drop, but I can say everything he's
[0:52] saying is true about me. And I may not
[0:54] understand the spiritual chemistry of
[0:55] it, but I know it's true. Amen. I may
[0:58] not be able to explain it on on on
[1:00] scientific uh scriptural or or spiritual
[1:04] science. I don't know. But it's the
[1:06] truth. Amen.
[1:09] So, it's the congealing of humidity or
[1:12] atmosphere. And when the night gets cold
[1:14] and dark, it falls from the heavens and
[1:16] drops upon the ground. It's fell from
[1:18] somewhere. But the next morning, before
[1:20] the sun's coming up, it's laying there,
[1:22] the little fellow shivering. But just
[1:24] let the sun come up. Watch it go to
[1:27] shining. It's happy. Why? The sun is
[1:30] going to call it right back to where it
[1:32] came from.
[1:35] That's why this is the rising of the
[1:37] sun. This is shalom. This is good
[1:39] morning. This bright sunlight that's
[1:41] come at the opening of the seals at the
[1:43] at the breaking of the message in our
[1:45] end time. That sun is up to what? To
[1:48] call us back home to change us into
[1:50] another state so that we can go back to
[1:52] where we came from. Amen. Amen.
[1:55] So, it's laying there in the cold dark
[1:57] night just shivering, but the sun comes
[1:59] up and it goes to shining. It's happy.
[2:02] Listen, it's shimmering and shining and
[2:04] happy reflecting the light, but it's
[2:07] still a dew drop on the grass.
[2:11] It's still on this earth. It's still a
[2:13] dew drop on the grass, but it begins to
[2:15] shimmer and reflect the light and get
[2:18] happy because it knows this light is
[2:21] taking me back home. It may not happen
[2:23] right now. Now it might be 5 minutes
[2:25] from now, an hour from now, two hours
[2:27] from now. The time doesn't matter. It
[2:29] knows when it feels the light that I'm
[2:31] going back home. And it can shimmer and
[2:33] shake and be happy and glow in the light
[2:35] of God. That's us on this earth right
[2:38] now. We know we came from somewhere. And
[2:40] in a cold, dark night, amen, something
[2:43] congealed and came together
[2:45] and we've been planted here on the
[2:47] earth. Amen. in the darkness of of
[2:49] obscurity, in the darkness of false
[2:52] religion, in the darkness of of a mind
[2:54] alienated from God. Amen. But praise
[2:56] God, as we laid here in another form,
[2:59] there was the rising of the sun. And
[3:01] when we felt that son of this message
[3:03] kiss us, amen, all of a sudden, we begin
[3:05] to shimmer and reflect the light and get
[3:07] excited and get happy. And you can say,
[3:09] "What are you happy about?" You're not
[3:11] vapor. You haven't had a change of the
[3:12] body. You're still stuck on earth
[3:14] because I know that this sunlight's
[3:17] taking me back to where I was before.
[3:19] And this light will change my state.
