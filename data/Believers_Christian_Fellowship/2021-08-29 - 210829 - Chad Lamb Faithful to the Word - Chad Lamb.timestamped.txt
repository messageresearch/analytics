[14:59] time
[15:01] let's go and turn to the book of
[15:03] revelation while we're standing thank
[15:05] you musicians
[15:07] somebody said
[15:09] i'm sure you come back all filled i said
[15:11] no i come back empty
[15:13] and then another brother said we'll be
[15:15] pulling i said you better pull hard
[15:16] because you got to pull me back in gear
[15:18] i'm in neutral i've been coasting for
[15:20] two weeks
[15:21] so and that was the goal you know to go
[15:23] and just unwind and relax we had a
[15:25] wonderful time we had a good time with
[15:28] our family devotions and a good time
[15:30] just to rest and relax but brother
[15:32] branham said preaching is something you
[15:33] got to keep up with
[15:34] and he said one time he goes i've kind
[15:36] of got out of practice but i think he
[15:37] had been two or three months out of the
[15:39] pulpit i've been two weeks and i felt
[15:41] like i forgot i forgot everything friday
[15:44] i forgot how to prepare yesterday i was
[15:45] in desperation i forgot
[15:48] but we're trusting the lord amen it's
[15:50] not us it's him and we just yield to him
[15:52] and believe lord that he'll do what he
[15:54] promised that he'll do so i'm trusting
[15:56] in you to help pull me back in gear amen
[15:59] by the grace of god we appreciate you
[16:01] praying for us we had a lovely time some
[16:03] many people said yesterday they asked my
[16:05] family where we went i forgot i didn't
[16:07] tell everybody but we were in missouri
[16:09] in the ozark mountains in the middle of
[16:11] nowhere
[16:12] fishing
[16:14] in the middle of nowhere
[16:16] i was happy amen that's where we want to
[16:18] be away from all tourist sites away from
[16:20] population amen and we were we had a
[16:23] wonderful time together and i also want
[16:25] to appreciate the brothers who
[16:26] ministered here i've heard good reports
[16:28] about all of the services so we want to
[16:30] thank brother kyle brother ron and
[16:32] brother jean for their putting their
[16:34] shoulder to the wheel and helping out
[16:35] and i i was totally relaxed because i've
[16:37] got confidence in the brothers here
[16:39] i haven't even watched the services yet
[16:40] i just got back thursday night about 11
[16:42] p.m and i'm hoping this week to get
[16:44] caught up but i've heard nothing but
[16:46] good reports so i'm thankful for that as
[16:48] well i also want to say thankful for the
[16:52] large group that showed up yesterday to
[16:54] help
[16:55] clean up the fellowship hall and finish
[16:56] up some of the kitchen remodel i was
[16:58] astonished at the progress that was made
[17:01] and many hands make light work that is a
[17:03] true statement
[17:04] and so we got a lot done we appreciate
[17:06] that and the kitchen remodel is almost
[17:08] done it's almost finished they really
[17:10] use sunday school rooms today the
[17:12] restrooms are open down there the
[17:14] fellowship hall is back in order so
[17:16] we're getting really close so thank you
[17:18] for all who helped with that
[17:19] man it's just good to be home
[17:21] it's good to be here together
[17:23] it's good to open our bibles together
[17:26] and read together and worship god
[17:27] together i mean there's something about
[17:29] that that we just can't get over amen
[17:31] and we just appreciate it so much and
[17:33] when you've been separated from it even
[17:34] just for four services you're just so
[17:36] excited to get back together again
[17:39] but i'd like to begin by reading here
[17:41] out of revelation chapter 17.
[17:46] to say god bless you brother tommy it
[17:47] was good to have you sing
[17:48] i always enjoy hearing you saying
[17:51] god's been so good to us we're thankful
[17:53] just to be here today god bless you
[17:55] brother aaron
[17:56] aaron lau is here he showed up right as
[17:58] i was leaving so i told him it was going
[17:59] to be a couple weeks before i got to
[18:00] greeting but we're happy that he's
[18:02] united again with his wife and they've
[18:04] finished the relocation and they're here
[18:06] together so god bless you it's good to
[18:08] have you here
[18:09] now let's read from revelation 17 verse
[18:11] 14.
[18:16] these shall make war with the lamb
[18:19] and the lamb shall overcome them for he
[18:20] is lord of lords and king of kings and
[18:23] they that are with him are called and
[18:25] chosen
[18:26] and faithful you can have your seats
[18:30] we ask the lord to bless the reading of
[18:32] his word and i just want to read a quote
[18:34] out of the fourth seal referring to this
[18:37] and i just want to take note of the
[18:38] scripture again
[18:40] he says
[18:43] for the lamb shall overcome them
[18:46] for he is lord of lords and king of
[18:48] kings and they that are with him so the
[18:50] lord is not alone in this battle when
[18:53] they come against the lamb the lamb is
[18:55] king of kings and lord of lords but he's
[18:57] not alone there are those that are with
[18:59] him and those that are with him are
[19:01] called
[19:03] and chosen
[19:04] and faithful
[19:06] and brother branham says in the fourth
[19:08] seal he says and he's got wrote life
[19:11] riding on a white horse
[19:13] and here's a man with three different
[19:15] powers mixed up called death gathering
[19:17] his earth-bound delegates and christ is
[19:20] gathering his heaven-born subjects amen
[19:22] are you a heaven-born subject men then
[19:25] christ is gathering you for this battle
[19:27] we know that before there's ever a
[19:29] physical battle there's a spiritual
[19:30] battle and the spiritual battle is
[19:32] raging right now christ is gathering as
[19:34] heaven-born subjects amen and we know
[19:37] that the the antichrist system is
[19:40] gathering its catholics and his
[19:41] protestants so this is not armies and
[19:43] tanks and horses there'll be a
[19:45] manifestation of that later but this
[19:48] gathering is a spiritual gathering the
[19:50] forces of the antichrist systems
[19:53] versus christ and his heaven-born
[19:55] subjects
[19:58] amen
[19:59] so he says these three different powers
[20:01] all mixed up called death gathering his
[20:03] earthbound delegates and christ is is
[20:05] heaven born subject saints
[20:07] he's got death role in him christ has
[20:09] got life wrote on him you pick that up
[20:10] in revelations 19 brother branham is
[20:13] taking revelations 19 and pulling it
[20:15] over here into this group this this
[20:17] coming uh group for the battle in uh
[20:20] revelation 17.
[20:22] so he's saying he's got life wrote on
[20:25] him those with him are on a white
[20:26] horse's also and they are called the
[20:28] chosen before the foundation of the
[20:30] world
[20:31] and they are faithful to the word
[20:35] amen he says i like that one
[20:38] called
[20:39] chosen before the foundation of the
[20:41] world and then faithful to the word by
[20:44] their choosing amen
[20:45] faithful to the word by their choosing
[20:48] that's what i want to focus on today is
[20:50] faithful to the word because we see that
[20:52] they were called amen and you know
[20:54] nobody called themselves god has called
[20:56] you and you didn't choose yourself god
[20:58] chose you before the foundation of the
[20:59] world but they were called chosen and
[21:02] faithful called by god chosen before the
[21:05] foundation of the world you have nothing
[21:07] to do with that that's all god's doing
[21:09] but the third part is faithful to the
[21:12] word by their choosing amen that's the
[21:15] part that we get to play amen that's our
[21:17] privilege in this day that's our
[21:19] privilege in the battle that's that's
[21:21] the privilege that god has given to us
[21:23] to be faithful to the word by our
[21:25] choosing
[21:27] amen it's a it's a wonderful privilege
[21:29] and we should never take it lightly amen
[21:31] and i think too many times we squander
[21:33] this great privilege away and we don't
[21:35] recognize what what god has called us to
[21:38] and what god has called us for and what
[21:40] our purpose in this life is and how god
[21:42] has put himself in partnership with man
[21:44] amen and so many times we as man we want
[21:47] god to do everything amen but brother
[21:49] branham over and over he says you're
[21:51] waiting on god he said god's waiting on
[21:53] you
[21:55] said you're waiting for the rapture the
[21:56] rapture is waiting on you
[21:58] amen he says those in hebrews 11 he said
[22:01] they're not made perfect without us
[22:05] so the brother man said he's waiting for
[22:07] this church to come to perfection amen
[22:10] what is perfection amen full maturity
[22:13] completion what what brings full
[22:14] maturity what is full maturity the
[22:16] restoration of the head to the body is
[22:19] the full body amen they're waiting for
[22:22] this church to come to perfection what
[22:24] will that be it's not it's not a perfect
[22:26] life like there's we've never done
[22:29] anything wrong that's not it that's not
[22:31] that's not the point i mean if we try to
[22:33] say we come to perfection by never
[22:34] making a mistake we're just going to get
[22:36] discouraged in our walk but that's not
[22:38] what it's about amen it's about coming
[22:41] to that perfect headship and coming to a
[22:43] perfect submission to that perfect
[22:45] headship because it's the capping off of
[22:47] that body amen
[22:51] there's a quote that brother branham
[22:52] goes to at the end
[22:54] of christ is the mystery of god revealed
[22:57] and he says hebrews 11 hebrews 11 we
[23:00] know to be the the hall of fame or the
[23:02] faith chapter of the bible and it begins
[23:04] with faith as the substance of things
[23:05] hoped for and without faith it's
[23:07] impossible to please god and then it
[23:09] goes through all the heroes of faith
[23:11] and then it and then it goes towards the
[23:13] end he says and they could not be
[23:15] perfect without us so brother is
[23:17] referencing hebrews 11 and in the quote
[23:19] he says hebrews 11 said they could not
[23:21] be perfect without us
[23:22] hands and feet cannot be perfect without
[23:25] the brains
[23:29] so what's he calling us
[23:30] [Music]
[23:35] and it's not well we're the smartest of
[23:37] all the church age and that's not what
[23:38] he's talking about let's keep reading
[23:40] amen
[23:41] he said
[23:42] he says uh the hands and the feet we
[23:46] know that he was coming up rebuilding
[23:48] this bride tree rebuilding his bride
[23:50] that had fallen in thyatira have fallen
[23:52] at the knights and council and bringing
[23:54] a restoration of the bride tree bringing
[23:56] his bride in a resurrection back to what
[23:59] she was intended to be at the beginning
[24:01] of virgin bride for christ and he
[24:03] restores through luther the feet amen
[24:05] through wesley the hands and then he
[24:07] comes back to the mouth amen to the
[24:10] manifestation of the gifts and speaking
[24:11] in tongues to the eyes to the prophet
[24:14] but there's got to be a finishing of
[24:16] capping off the brains the knowledge the
[24:18] mind of christ has got to come and cap
[24:20] off this church to bring it to
[24:22] perfection
[24:24] and so it's imperfect if it stops
[24:26] anywhere along this journey
[24:29] it's still not perfect and they are
[24:31] still waiting on us amen
[24:34] so he says the feet cannot be perfect
[24:37] without the brains the knowledge the
[24:39] head and so forth and we're all
[24:41] perfected in him so by one spirit we're
[24:43] all baptized into one body free from
[24:46] judgment passed from sin and death
[24:49] so brother abandonment is referring to
[24:51] hebrews 11 and they're not perfect
[24:53] without us because as the body come up
[24:55] it can't be it cannot be
[24:58] finished it cannot be completed until
[25:01] the headship comes and the headship
[25:03] comes and brings the mind of christ one
[25:06] is the mind of christ it is the full
[25:09] revelation of the entire bible that was
[25:11] sealed up by seven seals but when those
[25:14] seven seals were torn loose amen after
[25:16] the tearing loose of the seven seals it
[25:18] opened up the entire bible amen and it
[25:21] restored back to god's people the entire
[25:24] mind of god because it was the mystery
[25:26] of god revealed the mystery one mystery
[25:29] one goal one thing that god wanted to
[25:31] accomplish and all of the shadows and
[25:33] all the times and everything was showing
[25:36] it and it was sealed away behind those
[25:38] seals so we had to have seals that would
[25:40] be tore loose first to show the
[25:41] redemption of the church so when you
[25:43] would see the redemption of the church
[25:45] you can now see the whole mystery of god
[25:49] but nobody was worthy to loose those
[25:52] seals until a lamb come forth amen and
[25:55] when a lamb come forth he himself could
[25:57] loose the seals and when he loosed the
[26:00] seals amen
[26:01] he sent it to us and now we're eating
[26:04] the book amen
[26:08] and it's the headship coming to the body
[26:13] and it's to bring the mind which will be
[26:15] the capping off or the perfection
[26:18] of the church
[26:22] and so
[26:24] we have to
[26:26] remain faithful to that headship
[26:29] because that's our portion to play in
[26:31] this life
[26:32] that is our role we're not in hands
[26:35] we're not in feet we're not in mouth
[26:37] we're not even in eyes anymore amen
[26:39] we've gone beyond that into the full
[26:41] revelation the full manna from heaven
[26:43] the opening of the word the open book
[26:47] the mind of christ
[26:49] the mystery of god revealed the secret
[26:52] that god had in the back part of his
[26:54] mind
[26:56] has now been opened and brought into the
[26:58] church
[27:01] and we must
[27:03] remain faithful
[27:05] to that
[27:14] he says
[27:15] i'm going back to this quote in the
[27:16] fourth seal
[27:18] it says they are faithful to the word
[27:20] amen
[27:21] i like that one called
[27:23] chosen before the foundation of the
[27:25] world
[27:26] and faithful to the word
[27:28] by their choosing
[27:29] all stimulated with new wine and oil
[27:31] just riding right along coming down to
[27:33] meet him they know the thunders will
[27:35] issue the thin course pretty soon
[27:38] well the thunders have issued the thing
[27:41] because the preaching of the thunders
[27:42] amen was revealing of the seals
[27:46] the interpretation of the symbols of the
[27:48] seals is what the thunders were and the
[27:49] thunders amen opened it up so that we
[27:52] could open up the mystery of god
[27:57] so they have
[28:00] the mind of christ
[28:03] and if you have the mind of christ you
[28:04] have christ
[28:08] if you have
[28:09] the mind of god you have god
[28:12] because god was alone with his thoughts
[28:14] amen god was not a being that could be
[28:18] seen he was not material subject god was
[28:22] a
[28:23] i i don't want to say anything wrong
[28:24] because i there's things we don't
[28:26] understand so i don't want to use wrong
[28:27] terminology but in a very childish way
[28:30] if i could say it in a very immature
[28:32] childish way god was a mind
[28:35] he was his thoughts he was his will he
[28:38] was a person god was his thinking but he
[28:40] wanted his thoughts to become material
[28:42] he wanted himself to be moved down into
[28:44] a tangible form that could be seen that
[28:46] could be touched it could be found so
[28:48] god in his great thinking he had a great
[28:51] plan in his great person he he wanted
[28:54] more expression so he began to express
[28:56] in more tangible physical ways and in
[28:58] the heavenly realm and then into the
[29:00] earthly realm and god amen so when you
[29:04] go back to the secret that god had back
[29:07] then before he was god when he was
[29:09] elohim
[29:11] when he was the self-existing one when
[29:13] you go back to that thought you've gone
[29:15] back to god amen
[29:17] you you bypass amen so many things that
[29:20] are inferior so many expressions that
[29:22] still had humanity tied in so many uh so
[29:25] many expressions that were man-made and
[29:27] man-cultivated or man-perverted i should
[29:30] say
[29:31] and you go all the way back back amen
[29:34] even the heavenly realms were perverted
[29:36] even the angelic beings chose wrong amen
[29:39] even god had to redeem it all because it
[29:41] was fallen and you go back and you go
[29:43] back and you go back to the mystery the
[29:46] thought the desire that was in god's
[29:48] mind before the foundation of the world
[29:50] when you've got that thought you've got
[29:52] god and you've skipped past all of this
[29:54] and you've gone right back to his
[29:56] original heart's desire
[29:58] because the heart purpose of god was to
[30:01] have a bride of his own choosing
[30:06] and so
[30:07] we've been brought so far
[30:10] because god is trying to complete the
[30:13] masterpiece
[30:15] and he's got to cap it off and and he
[30:17] brings his his mind his headship the
[30:20] revealed word to the body
[30:23] and now
[30:24] now
[30:25] that is our focus that is our that's the
[30:28] age we live in that that is our calling
[30:30] that is our purpose this isn't feet age
[30:33] this isn't hands age amen this isn't
[30:35] mouth hey this is the age of the full
[30:38] revelation of the mystery of god being
[30:40] revealed in this day
[30:43] and that is what we're to be faithful to
[30:47] friends
[30:48] that is our headship that is our husband
[30:51] amen the revealed word
[30:56] brother branham speaks here in satan's
[30:58] eden he says what a beautiful place
[31:02] god was so satisfied until he just went
[31:05] back and rested from all his works
[31:08] every tree never brought forth thorns
[31:10] and thizzles no berries ever come off of
[31:12] a thorn tree everything was perfect all
[31:14] seeds were perfect everything was in
[31:16] perfect condition speaking here of the
[31:18] garden of eden
[31:19] then when he went to take a little rest
[31:22] his enemy slipped in with the seat and
[31:24] took it over by misinterpreting his
[31:26] program to his children
[31:28] when he put trust in his own child
[31:32] now think about this when when when god
[31:35] had completed amen the work of his
[31:38] masterpiece and he completed the setting
[31:41] that he was going to set the masterpiece
[31:42] in and he had a masterpiece sign and
[31:45] then out of his son come a masterpiece
[31:47] bride and he brought them together to
[31:49] make a masterpiece family
[31:51] and he set this masterpiece in the
[31:53] garden amen and he put trust in his son
[31:56] and his son's bride and so he went and
[31:58] took his rest because you know it god
[32:01] took his rest because god was now
[32:04] working through the manifestation of the
[32:05] son
[32:07] he had given it over to his son and his
[32:10] son's bride and now they were god upon
[32:12] the earth and they were administering
[32:14] amen and watching over and overseeing
[32:17] the creation of god and god put trust in
[32:20] his own child as you put trust in your
[32:23] daughter when she goes out at night with
[32:25] a man when you put trust in your son
[32:27] when he has to go with a drinking boy or
[32:29] a smoking boy see he put trust in his
[32:31] own son and he would not do anything
[32:33] wrong and would keep every word that he
[32:36] said
[32:37] but the enemy slipped in like that
[32:39] greasy slicker that would take out your
[32:41] daughter and misbehave himself or some
[32:42] woman would take go out with your son
[32:44] and say the same thing see he slipped in
[32:46] the enemy of god slipped in and
[32:48] misinterpreted the word to eve
[32:51] now he by his fall it has took over and
[32:55] possessed the garden of eden himself he
[32:57] took it over and down he has had six
[32:59] thousand years of deceitful rule
[33:01] deceiving the people god's children as
[33:03] he did then
[33:04] because they were based on free moral
[33:06] agency to act any way they wish to and
[33:09] believing that they would act right or
[33:12] trusting that they would act right then
[33:14] they've come with the wrong act and sold
[33:16] their birthright as esau did for the
[33:18] world and satan won it and took it over
[33:21] and he's had six thousand years to build
[33:23] up his eden as god had six thousand
[33:25] years to bring his eating to close and
[33:27] by deceit the seed of the word or the
[33:29] people now establish his own eden in the
[33:32] earth in sin
[33:35] so god
[33:36] brother was telling us that gone he
[33:39] entrusted his son he trusted his son
[33:42] with his word he trusted his son with
[33:44] his creation and he trusted him to do
[33:46] right and he gave him the word and he
[33:49] went to take his rest so that his son
[33:51] could be faithful to the word amen but
[33:53] we know that that bride was found
[33:55] unfaithful to the word
[33:58] and so when she was found unfaithful to
[34:01] the word then
[34:03] adam left the word to go with his wife
[34:06] amen so that he could redeem his wife
[34:09] and and now
[34:10] god the trust that he put in his son and
[34:13] his son's bride now that trust is
[34:15] violated and we know that this serves a
[34:17] greater purpose but it sets a principle
[34:19] that god had set up free moral agency a
[34:22] law of choosing and he never took that
[34:25] choice away because god wants choice our
[34:29] choice our faithfulness to express
[34:32] something amen and so we were called he
[34:35] did that chosen before the foundation he
[34:38] did that but faithful by our own
[34:40] choosing that's what he's asking us to
[34:42] do
[34:45] and he was asking his son the first time
[34:47] to do it knowing what would happen but
[34:49] he still put him on free and moral
[34:51] agency and asked him to do it and listen
[34:53] lucifer made his choice he chose
[34:55] rebellion the angels made their choice
[34:57] they chose to follow him the jews made
[34:59] their choice to choose law over grace
[35:01] and god gave them their choice amen the
[35:03] church chose creeds of man over the word
[35:05] of god amen god has never taken away
[35:07] this choice amen and you think why
[35:10] wouldn't you stop this amen why wouldn't
[35:12] you just take it all away and and scrub
[35:14] it all and then just just rule like a
[35:16] dictator
[35:18] and have it all right
[35:20] because god is expressing something and
[35:22] he wants it to be expressed and he set
[35:24] it up on free choice and he's not
[35:26] changing the rules of the game after he
[35:28] started the game
[35:31] so the game has to play out according to
[35:33] the rules amen and there was a rule
[35:35] established of free choice and that rule
[35:37] was expressed in heaven and caused the
[35:39] fall it was expressed in eden and caused
[35:41] the fall it was expressed at sinai and
[35:43] caused the law
[35:45] it was expressed in nicaea and caused
[35:48] the fall of the church
[35:51] but god has foresaw that he will have a
[35:55] portion of himself attributes that will
[35:57] come to the mind of christ and they will
[36:00] not fall but they will be faithful by
[36:02] their own choosing
[36:04] he's predestinated to be that way he's
[36:06] chosen he's elected and he's placed
[36:09] attributes amen in the earth today and
[36:12] he's given the attributes what the
[36:14] attributes before hadn't had amen the
[36:16] attributes that came before us friends
[36:19] had partial revelation had pieces of the
[36:21] story
[36:24] the attributes that went before us were
[36:26] part of of the developing amen of the
[36:29] word of god of the bible as we know it
[36:31] they were there playing out their part
[36:32] they were acting out their role they
[36:34] were demonstrating a certain portion of
[36:36] the gospel story but they didn't have
[36:38] the privilege you and i have of sitting
[36:40] here after the opening of the seals amen
[36:42] when the mystery of god has been
[36:44] revealed and you look back and the whole
[36:46] thing has been peeled open the veil has
[36:48] been taken away and you can look back
[36:50] and see that before amen before there
[36:53] was a creation god had in his mind a
[36:55] plan and that plan god was going to
[36:57] express himself and it was the very god
[37:00] becoming tangible it was the very god
[37:02] coming into existence amen to have
[37:04] manifestation with his attributes
[37:07] and according to that god had an
[37:09] adversary because the adversary would
[37:11] demonstrate his attributes
[37:14] and he allowed a law of free moral
[37:16] agency and choosing amen so that the
[37:18] adversary had room to work
[37:21] and when the adversary had room to work
[37:23] that working would create situations
[37:25] where attributes could come out into
[37:27] expression and when those attributes
[37:29] come out into expression it was
[37:30] displaying god here and god here and god
[37:33] here and god here so that as god was
[37:35] becoming tangible he was becoming known
[37:38] he was becoming expressed amen he didn't
[37:40] just show up tangible poof amen now
[37:42] worship me but he was coming in a way
[37:45] that you would see his character that
[37:46] you would see as nature that you would
[37:48] see him as a deliverer and a healer and
[37:50] a father and all and a king and all of
[37:52] these attributes
[37:55] and you and i are sitting here amen at
[37:57] the end of the gentile dispensation amen
[38:00] at the end of the church ages amen
[38:02] having the seals taken off of the
[38:04] mystery of redemption and looking at the
[38:06] mystery of god that is now being
[38:07] revealed to the bride and you have the
[38:10] benefit of all of that
[38:15] moses the bible said was faithful in all
[38:17] his house
[38:19] but moses yet had failure at the smitten
[38:22] rock
[38:24] david was faithful to do all god's will
[38:26] but yet david failed
[38:30] there was choices made
[38:32] choices that that caused failure
[38:35] but all of these attributes were
[38:37] operating in a certain portion
[38:40] of the mystery
[38:42] and a certain manifestation for their
[38:44] day
[38:46] but now we're not here in partial
[38:49] friends
[38:51] we're not here wondering about things
[38:53] that the prophets and
[38:55] sages of old would love to have
[38:56] understood
[38:58] and known that were probed at that that
[39:00] they saw in vision form or they they saw
[39:03] in symbolic form but now we're here in
[39:06] the actual revelation the actual literal
[39:08] manifestation of what they were looking
[39:10] at in symbol form
[39:12] what they were seeing is symbols amen
[39:14] what they were seeing is symbols in
[39:15] ezekiel's dry bones amen that bride is
[39:17] standing on her feet after prophecy had
[39:19] gone forth amen and the spirit of god
[39:22] came when the word of god came to set
[39:24] her forth as a marching mighty army
[39:25] marching to zion they saw it in the
[39:29] symbol they saw it in a vision but we're
[39:30] living the reality
[39:36] and this is what we have to be faithful
[39:38] to
[39:44] brother ben said in choosing of a bride
[39:49] so there's another choice that we have
[39:50] in life
[39:53] that's a life's companion a young man or
[39:54] young woman stepping out in life has
[39:56] been given a right to make a choice the
[39:58] young man chooses the young woman has a
[40:00] right to accept or reject it
[40:02] but it's still a choice on both sides
[40:04] both man and woman they have a right to
[40:06] choice also you have a choice as a
[40:08] christian you have a choice of the
[40:10] church here in america so far that you
[40:12] can go to that's your own american
[40:14] privilege to choose any church that you
[40:15] want to belong to that's a choice
[40:18] you don't have to go in any of them if
[40:20] you don't want to but if you want to
[40:22] change from methodist to baptist or
[40:23] catholics to protestants or so forth
[40:25] there's nobody can tell you or make you
[40:28] come to any certain church
[40:30] that's our freedom that's what our
[40:31] democracy is every man can choose for
[40:33] himself freedom of religion and that's a
[40:35] great thing god help us to keep it as
[40:37] long as we can
[40:39] you have also a choice when you choose
[40:41] this church you can choose whether in
[40:43] this church whether you will choose a
[40:44] church that will guide you to your
[40:45] eternal destination you can choose a
[40:47] church that has a certain creed that you
[40:49] might think that that crete is just what
[40:51] you want or another church has a
[40:53] their creed and then there's a word of
[40:55] god you have a choice of you have to
[40:57] make the choice there's an unwritten law
[41:00] among us of choosing
[41:02] this is what i want to focus on there is
[41:04] an honor and brother bam just goes
[41:06] through a few of them a spouse a church
[41:08] of the word you want to follow or a
[41:09] creed but he said there's a unwritten
[41:11] law among us of choosing
[41:14] he said i believe it was elijah one time
[41:16] up on mount carmel after the showdown
[41:18] and the great hour of the crisis that
[41:19] we're just about to come to right now
[41:21] perhaps it may be to you or i tonight
[41:24] that we make this choice like the mount
[41:25] carmel experience frankly i think it's
[41:27] going on worldwide now
[41:29] but there will soon be a time where that
[41:31] you'll have to make a choice the
[41:34] brotherhood was establishing and
[41:36] choosing a bride this law of god this
[41:38] unwritten law among us of choosing
[41:43] and any any cites
[41:47] first kings 18 let's just turn there
[41:49] together
[41:50] first kings 18.
[42:07] first kings 18 and 21
[42:15] and elijah came unto all the people and
[42:17] said
[42:18] how long halt you between two opinions
[42:21] if the lord be god follow him
[42:24] but have failed and follow him
[42:26] and to be able to answer him not a word
[42:28] so here in the in the mount carmel
[42:30] showdown where elijah is restoring the
[42:33] the proper form of worship he's
[42:35] rebuilding the altar that was tore down
[42:37] he's bringing them to a showdown and
[42:39] he's asking them how long will you haul
[42:41] between two opinions he's saying now
[42:43] you're it's time to make a choice you
[42:45] can't just have everything right amen
[42:48] and brother ben said frankly i think
[42:50] it's going on worldwide he said it might
[42:51] be happening for you today but i frankly
[42:53] i think it's going worldwide but there's
[42:54] also coming a time where you're going to
[42:56] have to make a choice and i say don't
[42:58] wait for that day make the choice now
[43:01] will we have the world amen mixed with
[43:03] the message will we have old doctrines
[43:06] carried over from previous age mixed
[43:07] with the message or are we going to take
[43:09] the word and the word only the way a
[43:11] prophet gave it to us amen are we going
[43:13] to make a choice for the word and stay
[43:15] with the word regardless of whatever
[43:17] happens to us or what people think of us
[43:19] amen of separations and rejections and
[43:22] and hardships let's take the word and
[43:24] the word only and take it the way a
[43:25] prophet delivered it to us amen
[43:29] and so elijah's saying it wasn't that
[43:32] they rejected altogether jehovah it
[43:34] wasn't that they accepted altogether
[43:36] baal they were mixing the two together
[43:38] and elijah was standing against hybrid
[43:40] religion
[43:42] because the elijah in our day was
[43:43] standing against hybrid religion he
[43:46] built back the altar of sacrifice he
[43:48] built back the proper form of worship
[43:50] and in the time of the evening sacrifice
[43:52] he called on god and god supernaturally
[43:54] vindicated his ministry we've had a
[43:56] replica in our day and the replica in
[43:58] our day is calling us to make a choice
[44:03] it's not just god sent a prophet god god
[44:06] sent a prophet to call us to an
[44:09] attention that would this is not
[44:11] pleasing to jehovah this mixing of these
[44:13] ideas he doesn't want any more mixing
[44:15] this isn't the day of mixing this isn't
[44:17] the day of partial understanding this is
[44:19] the day of the restoration of the
[44:21] headship of christ the word has come
[44:24] back to the church
[44:26] and god wants a people that will be
[44:28] faithful by their own choosing amen
[44:32] he won't force you any more than they
[44:34] were forced in this day
[44:37] let's turn to joshua 24
[44:40] because elijah is very much
[44:43] reiterating something that joshua had
[44:45] said
[44:48] joshua 24
[44:50] and 15
[44:57] and if it seems evil unto you to serve
[44:59] the lord choose you this day whom you
[45:01] will serve
[45:02] whether the gods that your father served
[45:04] that were on the other side of the flood
[45:06] or the gods of the amorites and whose
[45:07] lands you dwell but as for me and my
[45:10] house
[45:10] we will serve the lord
[45:12] joshua brought them over and and brought
[45:15] them to a question now and bring him to
[45:17] a time of decision and he says now amen
[45:20] we're in the land amen we're going to
[45:22] possess this land and choose you this
[45:24] day whom you will serve it wasn't forced
[45:27] upon them friends it wasn't god god
[45:29] doesn't want it that way god wants
[45:31] choice
[45:32] because your choice will express what's
[45:34] in your heart
[45:37] god's leaving us with choice today
[45:39] he doesn't direct your every movement
[45:41] every day amen he doesn't take you and
[45:45] forcibly make you say uh something
[45:48] positive he doesn't forcefully make you
[45:49] confess the word you have to of yourself
[45:52] amen confess the word you have to speak
[45:54] positive confession of the word god
[45:56] doesn't take over your tongue and make
[45:58] you say that there's times god takes
[46:00] over his children's tongue and speaks
[46:01] things that they have no knowledge of
[46:03] but that's not what we're talking about
[46:05] today we're talking about god allowing
[46:07] room for you to make your choice to
[46:09] prove that you're faithful by your own
[46:11] choosing because those are the people
[46:12] that are following him in this battle
[46:16] they're the ones who are faithful by
[46:18] their own choosing
[46:21] and now joshua is saying
[46:24] you've gotten all kinds of gods that you
[46:26] picked up in egypt
[46:30] all kinds of different deities you
[46:32] picked up in egypt and along the way
[46:35] picked up in the feast of bail pior you
[46:37] you picked it up from the you
[46:39] picked it up through the
[46:40] moabites he says but choose you this day
[46:44] whom you're going to serve
[46:46] this or that
[46:50] there's an unwritten law among us of
[46:51] choosing and god has left it that way
[46:55] and god
[46:56] is going to defeat the devil in this day
[47:01] with the people who are called
[47:04] chosen before the foundation of the
[47:06] world and faithful by their own choosing
[47:09] and brother bam said faithful to the
[47:11] word
[47:12] by their own choosing
[47:14] you can be faithful to a lot of things
[47:17] and you can miss the word you can be
[47:18] faithful to your church and miss the
[47:20] word
[47:22] you can be faithful to your ministry and
[47:24] miss the church you can be faithful to
[47:26] your family and not miss the church miss
[47:28] the word you can be faithful to your
[47:30] family and miss the word
[47:34] you know remember
[47:36] the apostle paul when he's standing
[47:37] before agrippa he says now everybody
[47:40] knows from i was brought up in jerusalem
[47:43] at the feet of gamalio and after the
[47:45] strictest sect of the pharisees i was
[47:48] and i even persecuted this way hauling
[47:50] men and women to prison and my voice
[47:52] stood against them when they were put to
[47:54] death
[47:56] paul was faithful
[47:59] to the traditions of his fathers
[48:03] but being faithful to the traditions of
[48:05] his fathers he was persecuting jesus
[48:06] christ
[48:09] it wasn't that paul wasn't faithful paul
[48:10] was faithful to the wrong thing
[48:12] and after his conversion he became
[48:14] faithful to the word amen and when he
[48:16] was faithful to the word he was rejected
[48:18] by everything else that he was faithful
[48:19] to before and he lost allegiances and he
[48:22] lost friendships and he lost
[48:23] associations amen even in the christian
[48:26] church he lost his associations because
[48:28] he was faithful to that word amen and
[48:31] when he become faithful to the word he
[48:33] rejected everything else that he had
[48:34] been faithful to before and counted it
[48:36] as dung
[48:38] [Applause]
[48:39] the jews were so faithful and zealous
[48:42] for the traditions of the fathers amen
[48:45] that they began to deny the very
[48:47] fundamental principles of the word
[48:52] even jesus says
[48:54] you tithe in minton anderson and these
[48:56] things but you leave the principles of
[48:58] the word mercy and justice and faith
[49:03] and here they're so zealous
[49:06] over the traditions of the fathers that
[49:08] they will bribe
[49:10] contrary to the word
[49:12] that they will lie contrary to the word
[49:15] and they will murder contrary to the
[49:17] word
[49:18] and you see they weren't faithful to the
[49:20] word they were faithful to the
[49:21] traditions of the fathers
[49:24] and so we have to be careful what we're
[49:26] faithful to
[49:28] because brother brahma said this group
[49:29] that's following him on white horses in
[49:31] another place he says not exactly horses
[49:35] remember the book of revelation is a
[49:37] book of symbols amen they were writing
[49:39] on the word amen
[49:41] the power of the word was carrying them
[49:42] in this battle amen and now
[49:46] those who are following after them amen
[49:48] are faithful to the word by their
[49:51] choosing not by force not by coercion
[49:54] not by group mentality but by their own
[49:56] individual choosing they are faithful to
[49:59] the word
[50:08] brother abraham says
[50:11] in the messing choosing of a bride
[50:16] he says christ
[50:18] does vindicates his word
[50:21] which attracts the people
[50:23] so what attracts the people the
[50:24] vindication of the word of god
[50:27] it attracts the people he don't attract
[50:29] the people at churches
[50:31] that are attracted by big denominations
[50:32] and big doings and great big carrying
[50:34] ons and fancy things but the word of god
[50:36] attracts the bride of christ
[50:39] so god has a way of attracting his bride
[50:41] and the attraction of the bride is to
[50:43] the word of god
[50:45] and god vindicates it to get the
[50:46] people's attention and he attracts his
[50:48] bride by the word of god
[50:50] then further down a couple paragraphs
[50:52] later he says while the true bride
[50:55] attracts the attention of god
[50:58] so god has already attracted her
[51:00] attention by vindicating his word and
[51:02] that she's attracted to the word
[51:05] listen she's not just attracted to the
[51:07] vindication the vindication was to
[51:09] vindicate the word she's attracted to
[51:11] the word
[51:14] the vindication got her attention amen
[51:16] and showed her that this is god and
[51:18] remember she's attracted to the word god
[51:20] attracts his bride by the word now the
[51:22] bride attracts the attention of god amen
[51:25] how many want to attract the attention
[51:27] of god
[51:28] he's got my attention now i want to get
[51:30] his attention he said the true bride
[51:32] attracts the attention of god by keeping
[51:35] his word
[51:37] oh what can i do what can i do for god
[51:40] don't go build something don't go work
[51:41] something up just keep his word be
[51:44] faithful to the word by your own
[51:45] choosing and that attracts his attention
[51:47] oh he loves that how god is looking for
[51:51] that how god has been longing for that
[51:53] how god in his mind has been working to
[51:56] this goal all the way through from the
[51:58] fallen eden he's been building back a
[51:59] masterpiece he's wanted a bride of his
[52:01] own choosing that's his heart's desire
[52:04] and everything has been building to this
[52:05] climax to have a people who are faithful
[52:08] to the word by their own choosing
[52:10] so he restored the word to us so that we
[52:12] could be faithful to the word
[52:15] because there was men of old who went
[52:17] before us that were faithful to their
[52:19] portion of the word and they are part of
[52:21] that bride part of that body will be
[52:23] part of that resurrection amen and part
[52:25] of the bride of jesus christ they're not
[52:26] different than we are they're the same
[52:28] but they were living in portion and they
[52:29] got a hold of the portion of the word
[52:31] and they were faithful by their own
[52:32] choosing to that portion amen
[52:36] but this isn't that day
[52:39] now the full word's been given and just
[52:40] as faithful as they were to their
[52:42] portion we must be faithful to the whole
[52:46] they did their part it's time for us to
[52:48] do our part
[52:49] because as they were building the feet
[52:51] and the legs and the hands and the arms
[52:53] amen they were doing their part in the
[52:55] partial accepting the word for their day
[52:58] when it came to light they followed the
[53:00] light and walked in the light amen as
[53:02] much as it was revealed to them
[53:04] forsaking all others and cleaving only
[53:06] to that portion of the word that was
[53:07] given to them in that day
[53:10] but that's not this day
[53:13] and they without us are yet made perfect
[53:15] even more than the hands and the feet
[53:16] are not perfect without the brains the
[53:18] knowledge
[53:19] the head shoot
[53:21] and the headship
[53:23] has come
[53:24] into the bride
[53:27] it's in her it's part of her she's
[53:29] become one with the head
[53:34] so the bride attracts the attention of
[53:36] god
[53:37] by keeping his word
[53:40] we can try ever so many things to
[53:42] attract god's attention
[53:44] faithfulness to church church attendance
[53:46] works programs
[53:48] all kinds of things
[53:51] but the thing that gets his attention
[53:53] is when you buy your own choosing keep
[53:55] his word
[53:57] when you're given a choice
[53:59] and you choose the word
[54:01] that gets his attention
[54:03] and we see that as we journey through
[54:05] life we hit obstacles
[54:08] struggles difficult situations
[54:11] things that are complicated and
[54:13] confusing
[54:14] and i hope i'm not the only one who hits
[54:16] those areas
[54:18] but all that is is an opportunity for
[54:20] you to make your choice
[54:23] and that sometimes in the beginning it's
[54:25] not evident what choice i should make
[54:29] it becomes so complicated sometimes it's
[54:31] so complex these situations i i'm one
[54:34] who likes black and white i've told my
[54:36] wife many times if god would send me a
[54:38] letter in the mail say chad do x y z i
[54:40] would do x y z i don't care what it says
[54:42] cause i like rules
[54:44] i like guaranteed things i don't like
[54:47] taking chances or risks
[54:50] but that's not what god wants amen god
[54:52] wants you to make your choice and it
[54:54] lets you get in complicated situations
[54:56] difficult things to discern things that
[54:58] aren't obvious and don't make obvious
[55:00] sense it's not black and white it's not
[55:03] easily i can choose this and easily i
[55:04] can choose that you get into a situation
[55:06] where you've got to labor and go and say
[55:08] god show me in your word what you want
[55:10] and as god begins to reveal through the
[55:12] message through your bible through
[55:14] prayer time through the preaching of the
[55:15] gospel amen all of a sudden something
[55:17] clicks and you know this is the right
[55:19] word for this situation and you by your
[55:22] own choosing choose the word amen and it
[55:24] came so complicated and it came in such
[55:26] a way that nobody can make an easy
[55:28] answer that you would be justified with
[55:31] either choice
[55:36] you could be justified with either
[55:38] choice
[55:41] this looks good and this looks good
[55:44] and half may be for this this isn't half
[55:46] the people and you can't even get
[55:48] counsel
[55:50] because nobody has the answer
[55:54] why do we get in those situations
[55:57] why does it seem like we get in those
[55:58] situations more often
[56:02] because god
[56:03] wants a people who are faithful by their
[56:05] own choosing
[56:07] and it's it's so
[56:10] it's such a situation
[56:13] where you could choose your own desire
[56:17] and nobody would fault you
[56:21] but only you and god would know that's
[56:22] what you wanted
[56:26] and nobody would fault you
[56:28] because this is how these decisions are
[56:30] coming now
[56:32] and so
[56:33] you could hide
[56:35] your selfish decision from every brother
[56:37] or sister that's around you
[56:42] and your choice wasn't for him your
[56:43] choice was for you
[56:46] see this is how close it's coming
[56:50] he wants a people that'll choose the
[56:53] word
[56:54] of their own choosing
[56:57] not because everybody in the church
[56:58] would reject me
[57:00] i would look bad
[57:03] uh nobody would understand
[57:06] that's not what god wants
[57:08] this is no longer a group walk
[57:12] this is no longer a system
[57:15] this is no longer a man of people who
[57:18] are moving together this is one
[57:20] individual moving in obedience to god
[57:23] these are individuals choosing the word
[57:26] by their own choosing not groups of
[57:28] people choosing the word by their own
[57:29] choosing
[57:31] that's why if you remain faithful to
[57:33] your church you can become unfaithful to
[57:35] the word
[57:36] and no matter how faithful you are than
[57:38] to the church it doesn't matter because
[57:39] you've been unfaithful to the word
[57:42] now if you're faithful to the word
[57:44] you'll also be faithful to the group of
[57:45] people he calls you to assemble with
[57:47] because that's still obedience to the
[57:49] word
[57:50] that's how it's a it's a razor's edge
[57:52] it's such a tight walk amen that the
[57:54] bride is getting herself into now you
[57:56] can't reject the word we must be in
[57:57] fellowship we must be a contributor
[57:59] brother branham said put your shoulder
[58:00] to the wheel be there every time the
[58:02] doors are open show your support for the
[58:04] church
[58:05] but you can do that and reject the word
[58:07] and be wrong
[58:10] we do that because it is the word and
[58:11] it's my choice to follow the word so i'm
[58:13] a supporter of the church i put my
[58:15] shoulder to the wheel i come when the
[58:16] doors are open and not to look good not
[58:18] because people would judge me not not to
[58:20] get not faithfulness to the church it's
[58:22] my faithfulness to the word that causes
[58:24] me to do that
[58:26] it's my faithfulness to the word that
[58:28] causes me to to to pay my tithe to be
[58:31] honest in my dealings at work to be to
[58:34] be honest with my family and kind and
[58:35] gentle and leading my
[58:37] it's my faithfulness to the word not my
[58:39] faithfulness to the church
[58:41] friends family pastors preachers
[58:47] we have to be careful what we're
[58:49] faithful and allegiant to
[58:54] too many times in in the denominational
[58:56] mentality
[58:57] faithfulness to the church and
[58:59] faithfulness to the ministry equaled
[59:01] faithfulness to god but what happened in
[59:04] every denominational system every age
[59:07] amen that that church and that group of
[59:10] men begin to steer away from the word
[59:13] and your faithfulness to the word made
[59:15] you un your faithfulness to the church
[59:18] made you unfaithful to the word
[59:21] even though there was nothing wrong with
[59:22] faithfulness to the church it was part
[59:24] of the word
[59:27] but we have to be careful what we're
[59:29] faithful to
[59:31] and why we're faithful to that
[59:36] brother bam says
[59:39] in the marriage of the lamb
[59:41] so many says if the lord will take this
[59:43] evil spirit from me from drinking or
[59:45] from gambling or from lying or stealing
[59:47] i'll serve him
[59:48] but that's up to you
[59:50] boy we're getting into some serious
[59:52] stuff now
[59:54] you've got to do something
[59:57] they that overcome shall inherit all
[59:59] things
[1:00:00] they that overcome you have power to do
[1:00:02] it but you must be willing to lay it
[1:00:04] down
[1:00:05] she has made herself ready i like that
[1:00:07] word he's going right to revelation and
[1:00:10] saying the bride has made herself ready
[1:00:12] and the terminology is the bride has
[1:00:14] made herself ready
[1:00:17] you say now how could she make herself
[1:00:19] ready how could we ever get ready
[1:00:21] without god how could we ever do
[1:00:22] anything without god we can't do
[1:00:24] anything without god how can we make
[1:00:26] ourselves ready it sounds like works it
[1:00:29] sounds like our own effort and our own
[1:00:31] labor but it's in the scriptures
[1:00:34] but she had to make herself ready the
[1:00:36] same way esther made herself ready and
[1:00:39] how did master make herself ready esther
[1:00:41] took the things that were appointed unto
[1:00:43] her and put them on amen she admitted
[1:00:45] and submitted herself to the leadership
[1:00:47] she was under under haggai amen she
[1:00:50] submitted herself into what haggy i had
[1:00:53] appointed amen but she had to actually
[1:00:55] take it on and put it on herself
[1:00:59] she had to submit she had the yield she
[1:01:02] had to lose her own mind amen every
[1:01:04] maiden when it was her time to go to the
[1:01:06] king she was given whatsoever she
[1:01:08] desired to go in before the king but
[1:01:10] when esther came she took only what was
[1:01:13] appointed by haggai so esther made
[1:01:16] herself ready
[1:01:19] but esther didn't make herself ready by
[1:01:21] herself esther had a a a esther had an
[1:01:24] appointed chamberlain esther had a haggy
[1:01:27] eye that would show her the way she was
[1:01:29] given things for her purification she
[1:01:31] was given clothing to wear everything
[1:01:33] was given by the king for her but she
[1:01:36] had to recognize it yield to it submit
[1:01:39] to it put it on and go the way she was
[1:01:42] instructed to go
[1:01:45] so the bride has made herself ready the
[1:01:47] same way esther made herself ready not
[1:01:49] with her own ideas not with their own
[1:01:51] programs not with their own works but
[1:01:53] submission to the leadership gave us
[1:01:55] that god gave us in this day there's
[1:01:56] been a chamberlain and pointed to the
[1:01:58] women in this day to the bride and he
[1:02:01] knows what the king wants and there's
[1:02:03] been word appointed to the bride
[1:02:05] clothing that the bride has clothed and
[1:02:07] there's been there's a bit been a
[1:02:09] purification offered to the bride under
[1:02:11] the washing of the water of the word but
[1:02:14] brother abraham said if you won't stay
[1:02:15] under the word how are you going to be
[1:02:17] washed
[1:02:19] he's given the pure word for washing but
[1:02:21] if you won't stay under the word how
[1:02:23] will you be washed you have to make
[1:02:25] yourself ready by staying under the word
[1:02:29] you can't bring the word of purification
[1:02:31] you can't create a pure condition
[1:02:33] yourself but you must submit to the
[1:02:35] washing of the water of the word
[1:02:40] this is brian
[1:02:42] and that's why brother ben says they
[1:02:44] that overcome shall inherit all things
[1:02:46] he's also taking that out of the
[1:02:47] scriptures
[1:02:50] she has made herself ready i like that
[1:02:52] word
[1:02:53] you see god can't push us through a
[1:02:55] little pipe pull us out the other end
[1:02:58] and then saying
[1:02:59] blessed is he that overcometh
[1:03:04] brother branham's saying the language
[1:03:06] doesn't even make sense
[1:03:10] god can't push you in a little pipe pull
[1:03:13] you out the other end and say blessed is
[1:03:15] he that overcometh
[1:03:18] you had nothing to overcome
[1:03:21] he just pushed you through but you've
[1:03:23] got to make a decision for yourself
[1:03:27] i have to make a decision for myself in
[1:03:29] doing that we show our faith and
[1:03:31] respects to god
[1:03:34] abraham was promised a child but he must
[1:03:36] maintain that promise for 25 years the
[1:03:38] ups and downs that he had the
[1:03:40] temptations in those 25 years but he
[1:03:42] held to the word of the promise and
[1:03:44] israel was promised the promised land
[1:03:46] but they had to fight for every inch of
[1:03:48] it wherever the souls of your foot
[1:03:50] treads upon that have i given you god
[1:03:53] said to joshua it was all there the land
[1:03:55] was there and god gave it to them but
[1:03:57] they must fight for it
[1:03:59] the same way it is about divine healing
[1:04:01] god has given the power to heal you if
[1:04:03] you've got the courage to accept it but
[1:04:05] you will fight every inch of the way
[1:04:07] god has got amazing grace to save you
[1:04:09] and he will do it but you'll fight every
[1:04:11] inch of your way
[1:04:13] i've been behind the pulpit going on 31
[1:04:15] years and i've every inch of that has
[1:04:17] been a fight constantly it certainly has
[1:04:21] but we must fight if we must reign so we
[1:04:24] find out that the that the bride has to
[1:04:26] make herself ready be willing to lay
[1:04:28] aside every weight and and that does so
[1:04:32] easily beset us this is what paul says
[1:04:34] paul's telling us to run the patient run
[1:04:37] the race with patient you have a race to
[1:04:39] run he says run it with patience laying
[1:04:41] aside that's you doing it
[1:04:45] laying aside every sin and weight that
[1:04:47] this will easily beset us
[1:04:50] what is weighing us down what is
[1:04:52] hindering us what is holding us from
[1:04:54] running this race effectively
[1:04:56] efficiently with all of our heart he
[1:04:58] paul is telling us to lay it down
[1:05:02] we're not saying
[1:05:03] god if you'll rip this out of my hands
[1:05:05] i'll serve you
[1:05:10] we would never stand in front of people
[1:05:12] do that but that's exactly what's
[1:05:13] happening in our hearts
[1:05:15] we don't want to lay it down we just
[1:05:17] want god to take it away from us
[1:05:19] but we don't want to lay it down
[1:05:22] we still want it but we want god to take
[1:05:24] it
[1:05:26] what we need to do is realize it's
[1:05:28] hindering us and begin to hate that
[1:05:30] thing instead of love it
[1:05:32] begin to see it in the negative context
[1:05:34] it's in and it doesn't have to be a
[1:05:36] negative thing to be negative
[1:05:39] it doesn't have to be a negative thing
[1:05:41] to be negative amen but it's a weight
[1:05:44] that does so easily beside us
[1:05:47] and we must cast it away
[1:05:52] it says being willing to lay aside every
[1:05:54] weight that does so easily beside us
[1:05:56] that we might run
[1:05:58] with patience the race that is set
[1:05:59] before us we must lay them aside
[1:06:02] ourselves
[1:06:03] we can't say god you come
[1:06:05] lay them aside for us
[1:06:08] we got to do that ourselves
[1:06:11] i'm so glad the prophet of god said that
[1:06:13] because if he hadn't i would have no
[1:06:15] justification for saying that but he's
[1:06:16] teaching us a principle that they are
[1:06:19] called
[1:06:20] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:06:22] world and faithful to the word by their
[1:06:23] own choosing
[1:06:25] there are things we have to choose
[1:06:29] and if we
[1:06:30] if we choose and overcome then we get
[1:06:33] the overcomers reward but if god did it
[1:06:36] all for us we get no overcomers reward
[1:06:38] because we're not an overcomer there is
[1:06:40] nothing to overcome but when god leaves
[1:06:43] us something to overcome you say why am
[1:06:45] i in this why am i struggling with that
[1:06:47] do you realize what the rewards are for
[1:06:49] the overcomers
[1:06:51] god is leaving something for you and i
[1:06:52] to overcome by our own choosing to stick
[1:06:55] with the word and believe god and
[1:06:57] overcome these things because there's
[1:06:58] tremendous rewards for the overcomers
[1:07:02] let's go to revelation
[1:07:08] 21
[1:07:09] this is the scripture that brother
[1:07:11] brennan refers to in the quote that we
[1:07:12] just read
[1:07:14] right in the beginning of the quote
[1:07:15] revelations 21
[1:07:17] and verse 7
[1:07:23] he that
[1:07:24] overcometh shall inherit all things
[1:07:26] and i always be his god and he shall be
[1:07:28] my son
[1:07:29] this is the scripture he's referring to
[1:07:30] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[1:07:33] things let's go back to revelation 2
[1:07:37] and go through the church ages
[1:07:40] in every church age
[1:07:42] was given a reward to the overcomer
[1:07:46] so this reward for overcoming is not
[1:07:48] just for us
[1:07:50] every church age would get a reward for
[1:07:52] overcoming in their day
[1:07:55] but brother m tells us all the rewards
[1:07:57] are to all the believers
[1:07:59] revelations two and seven
[1:08:02] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:08:04] the spirit saith unto the churches to
[1:08:06] him that overcometh will i give to eat
[1:08:08] of the tree of life which is in the
[1:08:09] midst of the paradise of god
[1:08:12] this is for the overcomer
[1:08:16] this is for the one who will lay aside
[1:08:19] every sin and wait that thus so easily
[1:08:20] beset us
[1:08:21] these are for those who will lay aside
[1:08:24] relationships
[1:08:26] jobs
[1:08:29] anything that would hinder
[1:08:31] to run this race those who would lay it
[1:08:33] down
[1:08:35] freely of their own free choice without
[1:08:37] force
[1:08:39] and choose the word first
[1:08:42] this is their reward
[1:08:46] verse 11
[1:08:48] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:08:49] the spirit saith unto the churches he
[1:08:51] that overcometh shall not be hurt
[1:08:54] of the second death
[1:08:56] verse 17 he that hath an ear let him
[1:08:58] hear with the spirit saith unto the
[1:09:00] churches to him that overcometh what i
[1:09:02] give to eat of the hidden manna and
[1:09:04] we'll give them a white stone and then
[1:09:06] the stone a new name written which no
[1:09:08] man knoweth save he that receiveth it
[1:09:12] verse 26
[1:09:13] and he that overcometh and keepeth my
[1:09:15] words works unto the end to him will i
[1:09:18] give power over the nations and he shall
[1:09:21] rule them with a rod of iron and as a
[1:09:23] vessel of the potter shall they be
[1:09:24] broken to shivers even as i receive to
[1:09:26] my father
[1:09:28] chapter 3 verse 5 and he that overcometh
[1:09:31] the same shall be clothed in white
[1:09:33] raiment and i will not blot out his name
[1:09:35] out of the book of life but i will
[1:09:36] confess his name before my father and
[1:09:39] before his angels
[1:09:41] verse 12
[1:09:43] he that overcometh will i make a pillar
[1:09:45] in the temple of my god and he shall go
[1:09:47] no more out and i will i will write upon
[1:09:49] him the name of my god in the name of
[1:09:51] the city of my god which is new
[1:09:53] jerusalem which cometh down out of
[1:09:55] heaven from my god and i will write upon
[1:09:57] him
[1:09:58] my new name
[1:10:00] verse 21
[1:10:02] lay of the sea and age
[1:10:04] the hymn that overcometh will i grant to
[1:10:06] sit with me in my throne
[1:10:08] even as i also overcame in him set down
[1:10:11] with my father
[1:10:12] in his throne
[1:10:15] those are the rewards
[1:10:17] to the believers
[1:10:18] to the gentile bride
[1:10:21] but those rewards only come to the
[1:10:23] overcomers
[1:10:26] and god has left us in situations where
[1:10:28] we have to make choices
[1:10:31] now god it's not as though god doesn't
[1:10:33] have any foreknowledge
[1:10:35] it's not that he doesn't know that we'll
[1:10:37] make the right choice if not that he
[1:10:38] doesn't know what's in us he knows he
[1:10:40] knew job would make the right choice
[1:10:42] before he put job to the test
[1:10:44] but he put job to the test because job
[1:10:46] had to make that choice of his own free
[1:10:48] choice
[1:10:50] job had to choose job had to speak job
[1:10:54] had to stay with the word job had to
[1:10:56] repent job had to confess
[1:10:59] see god is on partnership with man
[1:11:02] there's some things that have to be
[1:11:03] expressed through these attributes
[1:11:05] there's things there's victories that
[1:11:06] have to be won through these attributes
[1:11:08] that are now vesseled in vessels of clay
[1:11:12] and there's things that that have that
[1:11:14] we have to do and it's not that it's
[1:11:17] escaped god's foreknowledge that will do
[1:11:19] them god knows amen he knows that all
[1:11:21] things work together for the good god
[1:11:23] knows that we will make the right choice
[1:11:25] amen but god still has to set it up god
[1:11:29] still has to leave the circumstances
[1:11:30] such where we have to make a choice
[1:11:33] without control
[1:11:36] we have to stand like on mount carmel
[1:11:38] choose you this day if there will be god
[1:11:40] serve him if jehovah would be god's
[1:11:42] servant we have to stand like before
[1:11:44] joshua choose you this day whom you will
[1:11:46] serve
[1:11:47] are you going to serve yourself and your
[1:11:48] lust are you going to serve god the word
[1:11:52] are you going to serve a tradition
[1:11:53] that's come down from your family are
[1:11:54] you going to serve the word as it's
[1:11:56] being revealed
[1:11:58] are you going to serve your church are
[1:12:00] you going to serve christ
[1:12:03] god gives us a choice
[1:12:06] we have to take our choice
[1:12:08] and when we make our choice we're
[1:12:10] expressing our love and respects to god
[1:12:13] and god has set the circumstances such
[1:12:16] and he set it up this way that he is not
[1:12:18] violating free moral agency if god
[1:12:21] forced you to make the choice and forced
[1:12:23] you to do a certain thing then there's
[1:12:24] no such thing as free choice
[1:12:27] there's no such thing as free moral
[1:12:28] agency he can't force it he sets the
[1:12:31] circumstances and gives the word and
[1:12:33] sees what you will do
[1:12:36] and that's part of god's program
[1:12:40] brother branham said god has so fixed
[1:12:42] this program that he cannot move without
[1:12:43] you and i
[1:12:45] said what he said
[1:12:46] he said as long as we're not doing what
[1:12:48] god what the spirit is leading us to do
[1:12:50] we're paralyzing god's program
[1:12:53] why did god do it that way i'm not
[1:12:56] exactly sure
[1:12:58] but one thing i'm sure of is he did it
[1:12:59] that way
[1:13:01] that's part of the way that
[1:13:03] this whole
[1:13:05] plan of redemption and this whole
[1:13:06] victory over evil and this whole
[1:13:08] reconciling heaven and earth and all has
[1:13:10] something to do with that why it's that
[1:13:11] way i don't know but it all ties in
[1:13:13] together this is the way god set it up
[1:13:15] so it must be the right way
[1:13:18] because god doesn't do anything
[1:13:20] wrong
[1:13:22] he does it right
[1:13:24] and god wants us to make our choice
[1:13:33] in the marriage of the lamb 1962 the
[1:13:35] prophet said oh how
[1:13:37] that would do for a real christian to
[1:13:39] get away from the things of the world
[1:13:41] and someday you talk about coming into
[1:13:43] porn on the wings of a dove he's coming
[1:13:46] for a bride one that don't fool with the
[1:13:48] world or the things of the world she is
[1:13:50] washed in the blood of the lamb she has
[1:13:52] pledged her love to him only the love of
[1:13:54] the world is gone and dead to her the
[1:13:56] marriage of the lamb has come and the
[1:13:58] bride has made herself
[1:14:00] ready
[1:14:06] in the breach
[1:14:08] between the seven church ages and the
[1:14:09] seven seals
[1:14:11] he says now of course when adam fell to
[1:14:14] death he brought death upon all creation
[1:14:17] now he was given free moral agency it
[1:14:19] was given to them just as uh as we so to
[1:14:22] make a choice
[1:14:24] now adam and eve in the beginning there
[1:14:26] was a tree of right and wrong before
[1:14:27] them that same tree sets before each and
[1:14:30] every one of us
[1:14:32] see god isn't doing for adam or eve you
[1:14:34] say well it's their fault no now it's
[1:14:36] your fault
[1:14:38] you hear what he said
[1:14:40] no now it isn't it's your fault
[1:14:42] you can't place it on adam now you got
[1:14:45] to place it on yourself because right
[1:14:47] and wrong is set before you we are on
[1:14:49] the same basis as adam and eve
[1:14:52] but you see when we are redeemed we are
[1:14:54] no more one our own choice but we want
[1:14:56] his choice
[1:14:57] see now adam and eve wanted their own
[1:15:00] choice they wanted they wanted to find
[1:15:02] out what it was to have wisdom so they
[1:15:03] probed into it and it caused death now
[1:15:06] when a man's been redeemed he don't care
[1:15:08] anymore for scholarship he don't care
[1:15:09] anymore for the things of the world the
[1:15:11] wisdom of the world he don't want no
[1:15:13] choice at all christ has been his choice
[1:15:16] and that's all of it
[1:15:18] he's redeemed he's just no more wants to
[1:15:20] lead himself he don't want nobody to
[1:15:22] talk him into where to go and what to do
[1:15:25] he just waits and finds out the choice
[1:15:27] of his maker then he goes into the goes
[1:15:30] in the name of the maker then the maker
[1:15:31] when the maker tells him to go
[1:15:34] so now he says brother i'm talking about
[1:15:36] this one who makes their choice they
[1:15:37] don't want anybody else to tell them
[1:15:39] what to do or give them any other
[1:15:40] leadership no more man's leadership
[1:15:44] they wait on their maker amen until they
[1:15:47] hear from god and god always speaks
[1:15:49] through his word amen and when they see
[1:15:51] the word
[1:15:52] and god reveals the word to them amen
[1:15:54] they choose the word and they go forth
[1:15:56] in the name of their maker that's what
[1:15:58] god has asked her friends god's after it
[1:16:00] and you he's after it and me he's after
[1:16:02] it from the youngest to the oldest
[1:16:04] that's what god is looking for
[1:16:07] god this is brother man made it clear
[1:16:09] this is not the day of the group this is
[1:16:11] the day of the individual god is coming
[1:16:13] after one one individual and when god
[1:16:16] begins to speak of the rapture or when
[1:16:18] jesus christ begins to speak of it he
[1:16:19] said there'll be two lying in the bed
[1:16:22] one will be taken one will be left he's
[1:16:24] coming to the individual age and this is
[1:16:26] the rapture age this is the day of the
[1:16:28] individual one will be taken one will be
[1:16:31] left in the bend
[1:16:32] two will be grinding at the meal one
[1:16:34] will be taken one will be left in the
[1:16:36] bed that's this day friends we are in
[1:16:38] the rapture age the rapture h started
[1:16:40] with a shout because the lord himself
[1:16:42] descend with a shout with the voice amen
[1:16:44] and we're living in this day of the
[1:16:46] rapture when god is separating two
[1:16:48] laying in the bed one taken one left
[1:16:50] behind
[1:16:52] one's caught up into the revelation one
[1:16:55] is staying
[1:16:57] in laodicea
[1:16:59] one is going to chur they're both going
[1:17:01] to church one is in heavenly places and
[1:17:04] one is in carnal places
[1:17:06] going to the same church
[1:17:09] this is individual walk this is you and
[1:17:12] god and god is looking for you to make
[1:17:14] your choice not because so-and-so chose
[1:17:15] that i can choose it
[1:17:17] not because they did it i can do it that
[1:17:19] day's done that's over with it's
[1:17:21] finished
[1:17:23] well my church accepts this and my
[1:17:25] church accepts that it doesn't matter
[1:17:26] what your church accepts it matters what
[1:17:28] christ accepts from you
[1:17:31] and what christ accepts from you may be
[1:17:33] different than what he accepts from the
[1:17:34] whole the rest of the church that you
[1:17:35] attend with
[1:17:40] see that has created deception the group
[1:17:43] thing has been the formation of
[1:17:44] deception all the way through the church
[1:17:47] ages
[1:17:48] but god has ripped the veil of the
[1:17:50] systems and he's ripped the veil of
[1:17:52] denominationalism and religion and he's
[1:17:54] brought it back to one individual like
[1:17:57] job like abraham like like isaac like
[1:18:01] jacob
[1:18:02] when god started dealing with jacob he
[1:18:04] deal with jacob
[1:18:06] when jacob was all alone god began to
[1:18:08] deal with him when jacob was separated
[1:18:10] from everybody else god began to deal
[1:18:11] with him god has brought us back to
[1:18:14] individual god dealing with the
[1:18:16] individual
[1:18:18] so don't let the devil pull you back
[1:18:20] into a group this family allows it will
[1:18:22] allow it
[1:18:24] our church doesn't teach against it must
[1:18:25] be okay this brother said that and
[1:18:27] don't do that friends
[1:18:29] that's not the day we live in amen when
[1:18:32] you stand before the judgment seat of
[1:18:34] for rewards i'm not talking about uh uh
[1:18:37] i don't believe any of the bride will
[1:18:38] have to stand in judgment she's bypass
[1:18:40] judgment but in the judgment of rewards
[1:18:42] you'll be rewarded for what you do not
[1:18:43] for what you followed the leader
[1:18:46] for what you did
[1:18:48] for the choices you made for the the the
[1:18:51] word that you chose to follow when
[1:18:53] nobody else would follow it
[1:18:56] for the word that you believed when
[1:18:57] nobody else believed it
[1:19:01] god wants us to make our choice
[1:19:04] sometimes he'll ask you to make a choice
[1:19:06] that nobody else will understand
[1:19:10] but you're still responsible for that
[1:19:12] choice
[1:19:13] doesn't matter if you can make everybody
[1:19:14] understand it or not understand it
[1:19:15] you're still responsible for that choice
[1:19:26] i want to look at romans 11. there's
[1:19:27] just a something i just want to share i
[1:19:29] came across this while i was studying it
[1:19:31] and i want to just add this in because i
[1:19:33] think it's pertinent
[1:19:35] where we are
[1:19:37] romans chapter 11
[1:19:43] 11-29
[1:19:51] romans 11 29 for the gifts and calling
[1:19:54] of god are without repentance
[1:19:56] brother teaches us this and
[1:19:59] and he goes into it quite a bit but we
[1:20:02] understand this scripture
[1:20:05] but the reason i say this is i want to
[1:20:06] say
[1:20:08] we have to be faithful with our gifts
[1:20:12] brother branham said in the message 1950
[1:20:16] the message the angel in the commission
[1:20:18] he says look but here the only place
[1:20:20] that i can see in the bible where the
[1:20:21] program of god was ever broke and all in
[1:20:24] all the types was right here when moses
[1:20:26] smote the rock the second time
[1:20:28] to bring water out of the wa to bring
[1:20:30] out water regardless if it wasn't god's
[1:20:33] will he knew
[1:20:34] we know it wasn't god's will
[1:20:36] we'll admit to that don't we
[1:20:38] but moses had power to bring it whether
[1:20:40] it was god's will or not
[1:20:42] is that true
[1:20:44] we know it was against god's will
[1:20:46] because god told him to speak to the
[1:20:48] rock god's perfect will would speak to
[1:20:49] the rock
[1:20:51] and he didn't speak it he got angry with
[1:20:53] the people
[1:20:54] and and god said he exalted himself
[1:20:58] he said must i fetch water for you
[1:21:01] rebellious and stiff-necked people and
[1:21:02] in anger he smote the rock and water
[1:21:05] came out of the rock
[1:21:07] but god told him to speak to it
[1:21:10] but in his anger and frustration and his
[1:21:12] self-will he smote it and in smiting it
[1:21:16] god says you were exalting yourself
[1:21:19] because he says must i fetch water who
[1:21:21] was given the water
[1:21:24] but moses now frustrated with the people
[1:21:26] acts like he's the one giving the water
[1:21:29] and it appears that way because when he
[1:21:31] smites the rock water comes out
[1:21:35] but there's no way water would come out
[1:21:36] unless god allowed it
[1:21:39] so there's a paradox going on here and
[1:21:41] brother branham's going to explain the
[1:21:43] paradox
[1:21:44] he says we know it was against god's
[1:21:46] will
[1:21:47] but god had entrusted his servant with
[1:21:49] that power
[1:21:52] when he smote the rock
[1:21:54] and bring forth its water showed it
[1:21:56] wasn't god's will he smoted again he
[1:21:57] called for it it had to come that's
[1:21:59] right he was endowed with that power he
[1:22:02] brought forth water it was against god's
[1:22:04] will and god dealt with moses later
[1:22:06] about it god because of that didn't
[1:22:08] allow him to go into the promised land
[1:22:10] so he was he was rebuked and punished
[1:22:12] for that
[1:22:13] he said you remember elisha young fellow
[1:22:15] went ball-headed was young when he was
[1:22:17] young man some little children began to
[1:22:19] holler on bald head old bald head why
[1:22:21] don't you go up with elijah remember
[1:22:22] that that angered prophet now turned
[1:22:25] around angry and cursed those children
[1:22:27] in the name of the lord and two
[1:22:28] she-bears run out of the woods and
[1:22:30] killed 42 little innocent children is
[1:22:32] that right that's not the nature of the
[1:22:34] holy spirit you know that but that
[1:22:36] prophet was angry see you have to be
[1:22:38] careful what you do
[1:22:45] again he says in 1951 the works that i
[1:22:47] do bear witness of me
[1:22:49] says notice
[1:22:50] now moses smote the rock second time
[1:22:52] representing that christ should come to
[1:22:54] earth and die again now he had power to
[1:22:56] bring forth the water out of the rock
[1:22:58] whether it was god's will or not did you
[1:23:00] know that
[1:23:01] everybody will admit that it wasn't
[1:23:02] god's will but moses done it anyhow he
[1:23:05] had power god entrusted him to be a
[1:23:07] prophet and he gave him those powers to
[1:23:09] do that and he found out that his
[1:23:11] servant failed him and he glorified
[1:23:13] himself instead of god
[1:23:15] and then what happened god dealt with
[1:23:17] moses then didn't he not the children
[1:23:19] with moses the holy spirit is given to a
[1:23:21] man and gifts are given to a man but you
[1:23:23] have to watch what you're doing with
[1:23:25] those divine gifts
[1:23:29] god gives to us gifts
[1:23:31] gifts of ministry gives a song singing
[1:23:34] instruments to play
[1:23:36] in offices we have gifted officers and
[1:23:38] deacons and trustees and we have
[1:23:40] teachers of gifted teachers and sunday
[1:23:42] school teachers and those who do bible
[1:23:43] studies we we have god entrusts us with
[1:23:47] gifts and the gifts and callings are
[1:23:48] without repentance
[1:23:51] but we have to be faithful in the
[1:23:53] administering of those gifts
[1:23:56] we have to do it god's way
[1:24:00] because you can take a gift and destroy
[1:24:03] somebody's life
[1:24:05] you can take a gift and lead people
[1:24:07] astray
[1:24:08] you can take a gift and twist up the
[1:24:10] word of god
[1:24:13] but we have to be careful that we're
[1:24:15] faithful to him with our gifts and not
[1:24:17] to ourselves our own desires that we
[1:24:19] don't uh
[1:24:21] react in a way to glorify ourselves amen
[1:24:23] you can you can sing a song you can
[1:24:25] write a song and sing a song to glorify
[1:24:27] god or you can write a song and sing a
[1:24:28] song to glorify yourself
[1:24:31] we've all seen that you've seen people
[1:24:33] that will sing for the edification of
[1:24:34] the body and for the glory of god and
[1:24:36] you know it hits it it hits the spot
[1:24:40] then you've seen people are up there for
[1:24:41] a show glorifying themselves
[1:24:44] we've all seen it we may have all been
[1:24:46] guilty of one of these things a time or
[1:24:48] two
[1:24:49] we're not beautiful perfect innocent
[1:24:51] people
[1:24:53] but you realize the gift god gave you
[1:24:56] that gift was not for you to exalt
[1:24:57] yourself the gift was not for you amen
[1:25:00] to administer any way you wanted to amen
[1:25:02] but but god has to be in control of that
[1:25:05] but the gifts and callings are without
[1:25:06] repentance it's god giving you a gift
[1:25:09] amen to write songs you can write songs
[1:25:12] whether they be for god or not
[1:25:15] and if god has given you a beautiful
[1:25:17] voice to sing out amen the truths of god
[1:25:20] the revelations of god amen just when
[1:25:22] you begin to glorify yourself you're not
[1:25:24] going to start croaking like a bullfrog
[1:25:26] you'll keep singing just beautiful and
[1:25:28] melodious as you ever did but now you're
[1:25:30] not doing it for him now you're doing it
[1:25:32] for you
[1:25:36] see we'll be held accountable for all
[1:25:37] these things
[1:25:39] because this is the day of the
[1:25:40] individual
[1:25:42] this is the day it doesn't matter what
[1:25:44] anybody else does i mean it matters
[1:25:46] these things affect us and we affect one
[1:25:48] another but that's not what i'm worried
[1:25:50] about i'm worried about bringing this
[1:25:51] guy into
[1:25:52] subjection i'm worried about my motive
[1:25:55] and my objective being pure i'm motive
[1:25:57] about i'm interested in laying before
[1:25:59] the presence of god till i know his will
[1:26:01] and i know what he wants me to say and i
[1:26:03] know the way he wants me to say it and
[1:26:04] anytime i feel like it was too much chad
[1:26:06] and not him i go back on my face say god
[1:26:08] forgive me i shouldn't have said it that
[1:26:10] way and god help me to say it the way
[1:26:12] you want it said and protect me and
[1:26:13] guard my mouth and guard my i mean it
[1:26:15] puts you under tension when you say i
[1:26:17] want god's way not my way
[1:26:20] because you can still have a gift he's
[1:26:22] not going to take away the gift and the
[1:26:24] gift will still operate just as much as
[1:26:26] moses had power to strike that rock and
[1:26:28] bring water out of it even though god
[1:26:30] didn't tell him to god told him to speak
[1:26:32] to it
[1:26:34] but god honored his office in elijah
[1:26:36] when he called a curse upon those
[1:26:38] children it wasn't the nature of the
[1:26:39] holy spirit it wasn't the nature of
[1:26:41] christ brother ben tells us somewhere
[1:26:42] else but god honored his office because
[1:26:45] he had a gift he was a prophet and god
[1:26:46] honored his words
[1:26:51] and we have to be faithful to god
[1:26:54] with our gifts
[1:26:56] there's there's there's individuals
[1:27:00] who are just gifted at breaking the word
[1:27:03] gifted even in fellowship at teaching
[1:27:06] one another but we got to be careful
[1:27:07] that we don't misuse that and lead
[1:27:09] somebody in the wrong direction
[1:27:12] we there's some people who are who are
[1:27:15] really good at rallying people together
[1:27:17] getting a group together and let's do
[1:27:18] this project and let's do this for
[1:27:19] brother so and so and they're really
[1:27:21] they're really good at organizing really
[1:27:23] good administrations administrations is
[1:27:25] one of the gifts of the body
[1:27:27] but you can be administering something
[1:27:29] in your own desire and your own thinking
[1:27:31] and leading people into a program or
[1:27:33] leading in people into something that
[1:27:34] has nothing to do with what god wants
[1:27:37] and you're operating in a gift
[1:27:40] of administration or helps or teachings
[1:27:48] god's bringing it back to the individual
[1:27:53] say god i know you've given me this gift
[1:27:54] but what do you want done with it
[1:27:57] god i know you've called me to this and
[1:27:59] you've commented that and i know i hold
[1:28:01] this office and i know i have this work
[1:28:04] to do and i know i have a certain level
[1:28:06] of influence
[1:28:07] but god let it be you and not me
[1:28:11] make my motive and my objective pure
[1:28:15] i don't think we could pray enough
[1:28:18] i i don't know that
[1:28:21] i don't know that as
[1:28:23] deceitful as the age we live in and as
[1:28:25] as corrupted as the all the systems of
[1:28:28] the world are
[1:28:30] i don't believe that we can navigate
[1:28:31] this life without real sincere time in
[1:28:34] prayer
[1:28:35] to check our motives and to hear from
[1:28:37] god
[1:28:39] we can't bulldoze our way through this
[1:28:41] life anymore it's too treacherous
[1:28:43] it's too tricky
[1:28:45] the deception's all around us and the
[1:28:47] guy we're wrestling with is the guy you
[1:28:48] look in the mirror
[1:28:50] and you can't trust him to always get
[1:28:52] the right signal from what's going on
[1:28:53] around him he's got the you've got to
[1:28:55] have time to connect with god and say
[1:28:57] god what do i do about this situation
[1:28:58] what do i do about this situation how
[1:29:00] would i minister this word how do i sing
[1:29:02] this song how what do you want oh god
[1:29:08] we have to be careful
[1:29:12] elisha was a prophet of god but 42
[1:29:14] children died
[1:29:15] because he was angry
[1:29:17] god didn't take away his gift
[1:29:19] god didn't stop honoring his word
[1:29:22] but it wasn't the nature of the holy
[1:29:24] spirit
[1:29:27] i say god
[1:29:28] help us not to do anything for vain
[1:29:31] glory
[1:29:32] it'll bring death
[1:29:34] help us not to minister out of anger
[1:29:37] help us not to sing for glory help us
[1:29:40] not to minister to share to
[1:29:42] to administrate to lead to to operate
[1:29:46] out of pride
[1:29:47] because it'll bring death
[1:29:50] but lord may we bring everything you've
[1:29:52] given to us and lay it back at your feet
[1:29:54] and say god if i'm left to do this by
[1:29:57] myself i will get it wrong
[1:30:00] and if i always do it just according to
[1:30:01] the way i feel i will get it wrong but
[1:30:04] god i'm taking this gift you've given to
[1:30:06] me and i'm laying it at your feet and
[1:30:07] i'm saying god will you by your power of
[1:30:09] your holy ghost administer this gift
[1:30:11] through me
[1:30:13] i choose to yield to you
[1:30:17] this is not the time
[1:30:20] to just keep trucking forward
[1:30:23] i think each step matters
[1:30:26] every decision matters
[1:30:29] because our decision shows our respect
[1:30:31] and honor to god
[1:30:33] when we decide
[1:30:35] where we're going to work and what hours
[1:30:37] will work and
[1:30:38] when we decide
[1:30:40] uh who we're going to associate with
[1:30:42] when we decide what we'll say and what
[1:30:44] we'll not say when we make decisions for
[1:30:46] where we'll go and not go amen those
[1:30:48] decisions show our respect and honor for
[1:30:50] god
[1:30:52] i think
[1:30:53] i think if god is looking for a host
[1:30:56] that will follow him who are faithful by
[1:30:58] their own choosing i say god i want to
[1:31:00] be one of those that are faithful by my
[1:31:01] own choosing you've given me choice and
[1:31:04] you've given me situations where i have
[1:31:06] to make a choice
[1:31:09] and may my choice reflect your will and
[1:31:12] may my choice reflect your word all the
[1:31:14] time
[1:31:17] and no doubt
[1:31:19] we won't always make the right choice
[1:31:22] but brother bennett said that's what the
[1:31:23] holy ghost is given for to bring you
[1:31:25] into correction quickly
[1:31:28] you may not always judge yourself
[1:31:29] correctly
[1:31:31] there's many times i had convinced
[1:31:33] myself that what i was doing was purely
[1:31:36] unselfish
[1:31:37] just for god just for other people and i
[1:31:40] had deceived myself
[1:31:43] and later when the whole thing unfolds i
[1:31:46] looked back and i said that wasn't pure
[1:31:49] there was me mixed into that i there was
[1:31:51] something i wanted i wanted to
[1:31:52] accomplish something i wanted to do
[1:31:54] something i wanted that privilege
[1:31:56] it wasn't pure although
[1:31:58] deep in my heart i would have known it
[1:32:00] wasn't purified i had taken the time to
[1:32:01] pray but i just got enough facts lined
[1:32:03] up to do what i wanted
[1:32:07] i don't believe i'm the only one
[1:32:12] sometimes you look back and you say god
[1:32:14] that was wrong
[1:32:15] but that's what the holy ghost is for
[1:32:18] friends to bring you into a quick
[1:32:19] repentance to acknowledge that that
[1:32:21] wasn't pure my motives weren't genuine i
[1:32:24] wasn't completely pure and all that i
[1:32:26] did remember brother branham says amen
[1:32:28] your thoughts speak louder than your
[1:32:30] words in heaven and brother brenham said
[1:32:32] what matters is motive and objective
[1:32:38] you may be able to string together a
[1:32:39] plausible cause better than a lawyer
[1:32:43] but god knows your motive and objective
[1:32:47] god knows the reason behind the reason
[1:32:48] behind the reason and he knows what was
[1:32:50] for him and he knows what was for you
[1:32:54] and he's looking for a bride
[1:32:57] that will yield
[1:32:59] completely
[1:33:00] to him
[1:33:03] to say and you'll make mistakes i make
[1:33:05] mistakes i make mistakes daily but can
[1:33:08] come back and be honest and say god
[1:33:10] that was selfish
[1:33:12] i said it selfishly i acted that way so
[1:33:14] that was for me god forgive me for that
[1:33:17] and let me follow your way
[1:33:19] because i want to be faithful by my own
[1:33:22] choosing
[1:33:24] not because somebody caught me or
[1:33:26] somebody questioned me or nobody may
[1:33:29] ever even know
[1:33:31] but i want to be faithful by my own
[1:33:33] choosing
[1:33:34] not because somebody's watching because
[1:33:36] there's always one person watching and
[1:33:38] that's the only person i want to please
[1:33:41] it's the master
[1:33:43] it's the master on the balcony remember
[1:33:45] brother ben tells the story
[1:33:48] of the man who studied under a master to
[1:33:50] play the instrument i don't remember
[1:33:51] what it was i think it was a violin and
[1:33:53] he and he studied and he studied and he
[1:33:54] played and he played a piece uh an
[1:33:57] orchestra piece and he played it before
[1:33:59] a a whole a theater of people
[1:34:02] and and he played it beautifully and he
[1:34:04] played it perfectly and people were in
[1:34:06] tears and they were weeping as he played
[1:34:08] they never heard music like that and
[1:34:10] when he was done playing the place
[1:34:12] erupted in applause
[1:34:14] and the man never reacted
[1:34:17] he didn't react at their applause he
[1:34:19] didn't react at his own efforts of
[1:34:21] course he would have known that he
[1:34:22] played it well of course he would have
[1:34:24] known that he got the parts right and of
[1:34:26] course he could hear the cheering of the
[1:34:28] people and the clapping and the praise
[1:34:30] but he looked to one on the balcony and
[1:34:32] the one was the master who had
[1:34:33] instructed him and he wouldn't smile he
[1:34:36] wouldn't feel relief he wouldn't exhale
[1:34:39] until he saw the master give a nod and
[1:34:41] begin to clap and then he knew he had
[1:34:42] pleased the master
[1:34:44] i said god help me live my life so i'm
[1:34:46] looking at the balcony amen not the
[1:34:48] praises of man not the criticism man not
[1:34:50] the accolades of men not what everybody
[1:34:52] else is doing or how they play their
[1:34:54] part but i want to play my part
[1:34:56] according to the way the master has
[1:34:57] designed for me to play my part and the
[1:34:59] only person i want to please in that
[1:35:01] life is him
[1:35:04] i want other people to like me i want
[1:35:06] other people to love me i love other
[1:35:08] people i want people to respect me but
[1:35:09] if everybody hates me if he loves me
[1:35:12] that's all that matters
[1:35:15] paul got to the place where he said all
[1:35:16] men has forsaken me
[1:35:19] but he knew god had never forsaken him
[1:35:21] and he hadn't forsaken god
[1:35:29] let's go to john 21.
[1:35:34] i'm telling you friends this is a
[1:35:35] different day we live in
[1:35:37] this isn't a church age
[1:35:40] for the bride the church ages are over
[1:35:43] this is a bride age
[1:35:45] this is a messianic age this is an
[1:35:47] abraham age this is a capstone age
[1:35:51] this is a different time for her we're
[1:35:53] not repeating the same things we've done
[1:35:55] before it's not group it's not churches
[1:35:57] it's individuals that god is calling to
[1:35:59] represent him upon the earth and he is
[1:36:01] coming in full measure to live in those
[1:36:03] individuals to express fully his bride
[1:36:07] that's the day we live in
[1:36:11] john 21
[1:36:13] and 21.
[1:36:18] god had already told peter that peter's
[1:36:20] going to suffer
[1:36:22] he appeared to them at the sea of
[1:36:24] tiberias and he told peter that you're
[1:36:26] going to be when you're old you you'll
[1:36:28] be led away where you don't want to go
[1:36:29] and your hands will be outstretched and
[1:36:31] he basically told him you're going to
[1:36:32] suffer and you're going to die and then
[1:36:34] peter turns around and looks at john
[1:36:36] following after and he says in verse 21
[1:36:38] peter seeing him
[1:36:39] sayeth to jesus lord and what shall this
[1:36:42] man do
[1:36:43] jesus saith to him if i will that he
[1:36:45] tarry till i come what is that to thee
[1:36:48] follow
[1:36:49] thou
[1:36:50] me
[1:36:53] what a lesson
[1:36:58] if i decide that he dwells here until i
[1:37:01] come and peter even misunderstood that
[1:37:05] he said what's that to thee
[1:37:06] follow thou
[1:37:08] me
[1:37:10] and that's the that's the call he's
[1:37:12] giving to each one of us today what is
[1:37:14] it to thee what happens to brother
[1:37:16] so-and-so what is it to thee what

[1:37:46] peter was wanting to make sure john was
[1:37:47] going to get the same trouble he had
[1:37:50] you're going to be led away where you
[1:37:52] don't want to go your hands will be
[1:37:54] outstretched when you're old i mean it

[1:38:04] thee
[1:38:05] if he has it easy and you have it hard

[1:38:10] if he gets everything and you get
[1:38:11] nothing what is that to thee
[1:38:15] follow
[1:38:16] thou
[1:38:17] me
[1:38:21] brother brett says in christ is the
[1:38:22] mystery of god revealed he says not say
[1:38:24] my church now my church has nothing to
[1:38:26] do with it
[1:38:28] it's an individual one person all hell
[1:38:31] is against this teaching all hell is
[1:38:33] against this truth but it is the truth
[1:38:37] i tell you what
[1:38:40] no matter how many people pat you on the
[1:38:43] back in this life
[1:38:45] they don't stand with you when you stand
[1:38:47] before god
[1:38:52] no matter how many people
[1:38:55] tell you you're right and no matter how
[1:38:57] many people and congratulate you on your
[1:38:59] abilities and your gifts and no matter
[1:39:01] how many people
[1:39:03] tell you what a wonderful person you are
[1:39:06] amen none of their voices matter
[1:39:11] none of it counts
[1:39:14] you know and if you're a gifted person
[1:39:16] you have to be careful because because
[1:39:19] when you operate when god operates
[1:39:21] through that gift it's a blessing to the
[1:39:22] people when the people express that they
[1:39:24] were blessed amen of course that feels
[1:39:26] good brother benham said it did
[1:39:29] you want to know that people were
[1:39:30] blessed you want to know that they
[1:39:32] appreciate it that they give
[1:39:32] thanksgiving but at the end of the day
[1:39:35] that doesn't matter
[1:39:38] the whole church can say i was blessed
[1:39:41] everybody can say that's nothing but the
[1:39:42] truth brother i believe every word you
[1:39:44] said brother chad but if it's wrong from
[1:39:46] what god said i'm wrong
[1:39:52] it doesn't matter if if we make a line
[1:39:54] and i go out the door and everybody pats
[1:39:56] you in the back and says that song you
[1:39:58] sang that was from heaven that was
[1:40:00] heavenly places but but in your heart
[1:40:03] you did it to be seen and to be
[1:40:04] glorified of yourself it matters not
[1:40:06] what anybody else says
[1:40:10] when you did something for somebody so
[1:40:12] that you could get credit for it when
[1:40:13] you get credit for it everybody tells
[1:40:15] you what a wonderful benevolent kind
[1:40:16] individual you are you have your reward
[1:40:20] that's as far as the reward goes
[1:40:25] but when you do it just for god
[1:40:28] of course appreciation is wonderful it
[1:40:31] makes you feel good you're thankful and
[1:40:33] it's right to express appreciation when
[1:40:35] somebody offers something to the lord
[1:40:37] it's a blessing to us we should show
[1:40:39] appreciation but at the end of the day
[1:40:41] all that matters is the master at the
[1:40:44] balcony
[1:40:46] did that action please him is that what
[1:40:48] he wanted is he satisfied will he give
[1:40:50] me the nod if he doesn't give me the not
[1:40:52] i failed
[1:40:54] doesn't matter how many people say you
[1:40:55] were wonderful you were great you were
[1:40:56] kind you were generous you were a
[1:40:58] blessing you sang like an angel it
[1:41:00] doesn't matter if the master's not
[1:41:02] satisfied i failed
[1:41:06] can we as individuals begin to live that
[1:41:09] way friends i think if we can begin to
[1:41:10] live that way we're going to finally
[1:41:12] come into what god wants for this age
[1:41:14] what he's been looking for all along
[1:41:16] he's been looking for somebody that will
[1:41:18] forsake it all and follow him for sake
[1:41:20] father mother daughter husband's wife
[1:41:22] lands and just follow him
[1:41:26] that's what this word has told us that's
[1:41:27] what christ himself has told us
[1:41:30] that he wants somebody that will forsake
[1:41:32] it all
[1:41:34] and choose him
[1:41:35] over everything else
[1:41:40] he said
[1:41:42] back in christ is the mystery of god
[1:41:43] revealed again all hell is against this
[1:41:45] truth but it is the truth
[1:41:48] jesus never said now peter you and john
[1:41:50] and all the rest of the people you've
[1:41:51] got the revelation now the whole church
[1:41:53] is saved no
[1:41:55] it was to him personally i say unto thee
[1:41:57] not to them to thee thou art peter upon
[1:41:59] this rock i'll build my church and the
[1:42:01] word peter means a stone stone means the
[1:42:03] confessed one or the separated one upon
[1:42:06] a certain stone upon a certain thing see
[1:42:08] a called out the church called out upon
[1:42:10] this stone upon this revelation flesh
[1:42:13] and blood never revealed it to you but
[1:42:14] upon this revelation called out group
[1:42:17] i'll build my church in them and all the
[1:42:19] gates of hell will never
[1:42:22] be able to withstand it
[1:42:24] not one hair of your head shall perish
[1:42:26] your mind i'll raise you up in the last
[1:42:28] day give unto him eternal life and raise
[1:42:31] him up at the last days there it is the
[1:42:33] revelation not them but him an
[1:42:35] individual not a group an individual all
[1:42:38] hell is against it
[1:42:43] that is nothing but the truth
[1:42:47] don't think it was just in brother
[1:42:48] branham's day that all hell was against
[1:42:49] this truth it's an individual god is
[1:42:52] showing us that in this day all hell is
[1:42:55] against this truth
[1:42:57] the individual
[1:42:59] not the group
[1:43:02] but his mystery is only revealed to his
[1:43:05] beloved bride
[1:43:06] that's the only one could see it and she
[1:43:10] is the only one can see it
[1:43:13] herself
[1:43:15] if you see it you can't make your
[1:43:17] neighbor see it
[1:43:19] this revelation is only revealed to his
[1:43:21] beloved bride she's the only one who can
[1:43:23] see it
[1:43:25] and the person who's dearest to you in
[1:43:26] all the world you can't make them see it
[1:43:30] the the child that you love more than
[1:43:32] anything you cannot make them see it the
[1:43:34] spouse who means more to you than
[1:43:36] anything else on this planet you cannot
[1:43:37] make them see it
[1:43:39] you have to see it as an individual
[1:43:43] it has to be an individual revelation of
[1:43:45] what god has done in this age
[1:43:48] and you have to see it for yourself
[1:43:52] let's go to acts 26.
[1:44:11] acts 26 and 13.
[1:44:19] this is paul
[1:44:20] testifying before agrippa
[1:44:23] and festus
[1:44:25] and he's he begins to explain to him
[1:44:28] his life story and what's going on and
[1:44:30] he says at midday o king
[1:44:33] i saw on the way a light from heaven
[1:44:34] above the brightness of the sun shining
[1:44:36] around about me
[1:44:38] and then which journeyed with me and
[1:44:39] when we were all fallen to the earth i
[1:44:41] heard a voice speaking unto me saying
[1:44:43] in the hebrew tongue saul saul why
[1:44:45] persecute us down me
[1:44:47] it is hard for thee to kick against the
[1:44:49] bricks
[1:44:50] and i said who art thou lord
[1:44:52] he said i am jesus whom now persecutest
[1:44:55] but rise and stand upon thy feet for i
[1:44:57] have appeared unto thee for this purpose
[1:44:59] to make thee a minister and a witness
[1:45:01] both of these things which thou has seen
[1:45:03] and of those things in which i will
[1:45:05] appear unto thee
[1:45:06] delivering thee from the people and from
[1:45:08] the gentiles unto whom now i send thee
[1:45:11] to open their eyes and to turn them from
[1:45:13] darkness to light and from the power of
[1:45:15] satan and to god that they may receive
[1:45:17] forgiveness of sins and inheritance
[1:45:19] among them which are sanctified by faith
[1:45:21] that is in me
[1:45:23] whereupon o king agrippa i was not
[1:45:26] disobedient unto the heavenly vision
[1:45:30] the apostle paul saw a heavenly vision
[1:45:32] of christ as the pillar of fire
[1:45:35] a light at noon at midday that exceeded
[1:45:38] the brightness of the sun and that light
[1:45:40] began to speak to him and he and brother
[1:45:42] tell us he recognized that that was the
[1:45:44] logos
[1:45:45] that was the pillar of fire
[1:45:48] and he said saul saul why does that
[1:45:49] persecute astound me and he said who are
[1:45:52] you lord he said i am jesus whom you
[1:45:54] persecute so he
[1:45:56] right away in the heavenly vision he
[1:45:58] caught the present-day truth
[1:46:01] of where god was
[1:46:05] and god gave him instructions in those
[1:46:07] instructions where you're going to go to
[1:46:08] the gentiles you're going to bring them
[1:46:10] from darkness to light you're going to
[1:46:11] do you're going to do this and that and
[1:46:13] those instructions were just to paul
[1:46:15] because some saw the light and saw no
[1:46:17] man someone heard a thunder and heard no
[1:46:19] voice but it's evident that those were
[1:46:21] with him did not catch the same
[1:46:23] revelation paul caught
[1:46:26] he had men traveling with them and those
[1:46:28] men couldn't see what paul saw and those
[1:46:30] men couldn't hear what paul heard it was
[1:46:32] to the individual only
[1:46:36] and paul got an individual vision and an
[1:46:39] individual
[1:46:40] voice they heard it as a thunder but to
[1:46:42] him it was a voice to him the thunder
[1:46:45] was a commission to him the light the
[1:46:47] sign was a person
[1:46:51] and the others that were with him on the
[1:46:53] journey they didn't catch what paul
[1:46:55] caught amen and when paul caught it it
[1:46:57] was a commission to him and he tells
[1:46:59] agrippa i have not been disobedient to
[1:47:02] the heavenly vision
[1:47:07] i just want to say there's been a pillar
[1:47:08] of light up here in our day
[1:47:12] some see a cloud but they don't see the
[1:47:14] person
[1:47:17] some have heard thunders but they
[1:47:18] haven't recognized the voice calling
[1:47:20] their names
[1:47:23] i heard the thunders it was white horse
[1:47:24] retinol you've missed the purpose of the
[1:47:27] voice
[1:47:28] you've missed the thunders
[1:47:30] i heard the thunders it said a white
[1:47:32] horse means antichrist and this spirit
[1:47:35] means that and that spirit means that
[1:47:36] you're missing the revelation under the
[1:47:38] thunders those revelation was christ was
[1:47:41] going to have a bride what was the
[1:47:42] revelation christ the mystery of god
[1:47:44] what was the revelation of the whole
[1:47:46] book that laid under those seals it was
[1:47:47] the revelation of the becoming god god
[1:47:49] becoming tangible god being known as
[1:47:52] male and female
[1:47:54] and that revelation that the thunders
[1:47:56] unlocked and unveiled was calling your
[1:47:59] name amen not white horse red horse it
[1:48:01] was calling your position in christ from
[1:48:03] before the foundation of the world and
[1:48:05] what your position is now
[1:48:10] some people heard thunders some heard
[1:48:12] their name called
[1:48:15] some saw a cloud some recognize the
[1:48:17] coming of a person
[1:48:20] some recognize the shape of the cloud
[1:48:22] and possibly hoffman's head behind it
[1:48:24] and maybe some figures in the cloud but
[1:48:26] they missed the headship coming to the
[1:48:28] body and the invisible union
[1:48:34] saw the light
[1:48:36] but missed the person and where he was
[1:48:39] going to dwell
[1:48:43] some heard the thunders but missed
[1:48:46] the commission
[1:48:49] but paul recognized the person and paul
[1:48:52] recognized his commission
[1:48:54] and of god by revelation there could be
[1:48:56] a crowd of people
[1:48:58] all seeing and hearing listening to the
[1:49:01] tapes and seeing the pictures
[1:49:03] but this is revealed only to the bride
[1:49:06] she sees a person she sees her lord
[1:49:09] coming
[1:49:11] to dwell in his
[1:49:12] bride she sees the location of the
[1:49:15] headship coming to unite with the bride
[1:49:17] and she hears the voice that calls her
[1:49:19] name and gives her a commission calling
[1:49:21] her out of laodicea into the bright age
[1:49:24] into the manifestation of jesus christ
[1:49:27] and this revelation is only to the
[1:49:29] individual
[1:49:31] you can see the sign
[1:49:33] but is it your commission
[1:49:35] you can hear the tapes but is it calling
[1:49:38] your name
[1:49:41] you can see with physical eyes and here
[1:49:43] with physical ears but there has to be
[1:49:45] another set of eyes and another set of
[1:49:47] ears deeper than the physical eyes and
[1:49:49] the physical ears that it becomes more
[1:49:51] than a picture and more than a tape it
[1:49:53] becomes my commission
[1:49:57] and then can you say i have not been
[1:49:59] disobedient to the heavenly vision
[1:50:03] but i've recognized my position
[1:50:06] and my position is to follow that head
[1:50:09] my position is submit to the headship of
[1:50:11] the word and they'll allow the word to
[1:50:13] come into me and be a living oracle of a
[1:50:16] living god to be a living manifestation
[1:50:18] of the word for this day
[1:50:21] it's my commission
[1:50:22] and i want to be able to stand on that
[1:50:24] day and said i i saw
[1:50:27] and recognize and i heard and it
[1:50:29] commissioned me and i want to say i have
[1:50:32] not been disobedient to the heavenly
[1:50:34] vision for with all that is in me i have
[1:50:37] yielded to the headship of that word
[1:50:39] i have given myself to that lord christ
[1:50:42] my husband
[1:50:43] i've come into an invisible union i've
[1:50:45] received my commission as the bride at
[1:50:47] the end time the full measure of the
[1:50:49] full word coming into full manifestation
[1:50:51] and bright form and i've accepted it and
[1:50:53] i've done all i could to surrender to it
[1:50:56] i want to be the one following him
[1:50:59] having been called
[1:51:01] chosen from before the foundation of the
[1:51:03] world
[1:51:04] but faithful by my own choosing
[1:51:09] these things aren't
[1:51:11] tales
[1:51:13] stories
[1:51:15] pictures
[1:51:17] god is calling somebody
[1:51:19] god is drawing his people he's revealing
[1:51:22] himself to him in this hour and he's
[1:51:24] placing them in a commission to act out
[1:51:27] the final scene
[1:51:29] for this dispensation
[1:51:31] and there's a people are saying yes lord
[1:51:35] that's the only thing that matters to me
[1:51:37] in life
[1:51:39] that's what i want to be
[1:51:42] let's look at second timothy chapter 4.
[1:51:53] second timothy chapter 4
[1:51:59] and verse 6.
[1:52:05] paul says for i am now ready to be
[1:52:06] offered in the time of my departures at
[1:52:08] hand
[1:52:10] i have fought a good fight
[1:52:12] i have finished my course
[1:52:14] i have kept the faith
[1:52:16] henceforth laid up for me a crown of
[1:52:18] righteousness which the lord the
[1:52:19] righteous judge shall give me at that
[1:52:21] date
[1:52:22] and not to me only but unto all them
[1:52:26] that love his appearing
[1:52:29] paul's saying i have fought the good
[1:52:30] fight
[1:52:31] i have finished
[1:52:33] my
[1:52:34] course
[1:52:35] god had a course for paul and it's not
[1:52:37] your course
[1:52:39] paul has a course for you that's not
[1:52:41] your neighbor's course
[1:52:42] they may share and part of it with you
[1:52:45] but even your spouse if time will
[1:52:47] continue will not walk all the way of
[1:52:48] the journey with you statistically
[1:52:53] there's a course that we have to follow
[1:52:55] as an individual and that has to be the
[1:52:57] course that god has ordained and that
[1:53:00] course is a surrender to his word and a
[1:53:03] life and submission to his word
[1:53:06] and i want to finish my course
[1:53:09] not because i have to but because i want
[1:53:13] to
[1:53:14] i want to choose the word not by
[1:53:16] coercion not by force and not by fear
[1:53:20] but i want to choose the word because i
[1:53:23] want to choose the word because it's the
[1:53:24] greatest desire of my life to be
[1:53:26] pleasing to my husband
[1:53:28] the thing that motivates me that i want
[1:53:31] to motivate me the thing that i want to
[1:53:32] be primary motivation in my life is a
[1:53:35] desire to please him
[1:53:37] above all others above myself and
[1:53:40] everyone around me
[1:53:42] and i want to finish my course
[1:53:46] i want to run my race
[1:53:48] the portion that god's allotted for me i
[1:53:50] want to fight well i want to run well i
[1:53:53] want to run my portion of this course
[1:53:56] and i want to do it well and i want to
[1:53:59] do it surrendered to him
[1:54:03] when it's all done
[1:54:08] i i want to look into his face
[1:54:12] and i just want that nod
[1:54:16] you may not have got everything perfect
[1:54:19] you you may not have you it's not that
[1:54:22] that we don't flounder a bit from times
[1:54:24] it's not that we don't have to check
[1:54:26] ourselves and restart that's not it but
[1:54:28] when you cross that line amen you had
[1:54:31] one thing in your heart and that one
[1:54:32] thing in your heart was to please me
[1:54:34] whether you did it beautifully or you
[1:54:36] did it haphazardly whether you blundered
[1:54:38] a bit or you pulled it off with a
[1:54:40] polished style at the end it doesn't
[1:54:42] matter because what you did is what i
[1:54:43] wanted you to do you put all my will
[1:54:46] first in your life and you did it to
[1:54:48] please me
[1:54:54] i want to hear well done
[1:54:56] thou good and faithful servant
[1:55:00] not because we made it look pretty
[1:55:03] but because we did it for him
[1:55:06] not because it it always sounded the
[1:55:08] nicest and looked the best and not
[1:55:10] always because it was without offense or
[1:55:12] without any flaw we can't
[1:55:16] you know what we're failures to begin
[1:55:17] with
[1:55:21] but through it all i want god to pierce
[1:55:23] down to the depths of me and move away
[1:55:26] all of the garbage and say down down
[1:55:28] down down deep where it matters what he
[1:55:31] wanted was to please me
[1:55:35] and i want that to be my motivation and
[1:55:37] i want that to be
[1:55:38] the thought that cries louder in heaven
[1:55:40] than my words
[1:55:43] that i want to please him
[1:55:48] he's
[1:55:50] he's called
[1:55:53] he's chosen before the foundation of the
[1:55:55] world
[1:55:57] but those that are following him in this
[1:55:59] battle
[1:56:00] are faithful to the word
[1:56:03] by their own choosing
[1:56:06] that's what he's been looking for
[1:56:08] from the time he entrusted his word and
[1:56:10] his creation to his son adam and his
[1:56:12] adam's bride
[1:56:14] and it's failed and failed and failed
[1:56:16] men have caught portions of it but
[1:56:18] portions have been obscured
[1:56:20] but he's coming now to this end time
[1:56:22] bride and this bride will be a
[1:56:24] reflection of himself
[1:56:26] and when christ was here he only did
[1:56:28] that which pleased the father
[1:56:30] and this bride is coming to the position
[1:56:32] where she only does that which pleases
[1:56:34] her lord
[1:56:36] and that is my cry and that is my desire
[1:56:40] i can say like the woman brother ben
[1:56:42] talked about
[1:56:43] i'm not what i ought to be
[1:56:45] i'm not what i want to be
[1:56:48] but thank god i'm not what i used to be
[1:56:52] there's something changing and stirring
[1:56:54] in me all the time as the word is being
[1:56:56] revealed it's stripping away more of me
[1:56:59] and it's making me more of an enemy
[1:57:02] it's taking hybridization and making it
[1:57:04] my enemy it's taking a wrong mind and
[1:57:06] making it my enemy and it's taking the
[1:57:08] focus from john what's happening to john
[1:57:10] and what will become of this man to
[1:57:12] where he's saying what's that to thee
[1:57:14] follow thou me and i'm saying yes lord
[1:57:16] i'll follow you god help me
[1:57:21] strip it all away lord so there's no
[1:57:24] vain glory
[1:57:26] there's no selfish desire
[1:57:28] but i want to choose the word on every
[1:57:31] turn and in every hand
[1:57:33] and i want to show by my choices my
[1:57:35] respects and honor to you
[1:57:38] ready i tell you that's my desire
[1:57:41] friends and i believe it's your desire
[1:57:43] and you forgive me if i blunder along
[1:57:45] the way but that's my motive
[1:57:47] and i'll forgive you if you blunder
[1:57:49] along the way
[1:57:50] we step on each other's toes from time
[1:57:52] to time and we don't get things exactly
[1:57:54] right and have to go back and make them
[1:57:55] right that's fine with me as long as
[1:57:57] it's fine with you as long as we're all
[1:57:59] desiring in our hearts to please him
[1:58:03] to follow him amen and not worry about
[1:58:05] the brother not worry about the sister
[1:58:06] but keep our eyes focused on him as long
[1:58:09] as peter kept his eyes focused on him he
[1:58:11] could walk on water but when he looked
[1:58:12] around he began to sing and i don't want
[1:58:14] to sink at this time there's storms all
[1:58:16] around i want to be fixed on him and
[1:58:18] following him and not worried about
[1:58:19] what's happening with another brother
[1:58:21] another sister i'll pray for them but i
[1:58:23] have to stay focused on him or else i'll
[1:58:26] go down
[1:58:28] i can't go around and
[1:58:30] correct the world encourage the world or
[1:58:32] defend the
[1:58:33] there's no time for that it's time for
[1:58:35] me to say god you've got to help me keep
[1:58:38] my eyes locked on this word amen because
[1:58:40] if i look away from the word i'm going
[1:58:41] down and then if i rely on my own senses
[1:58:44] i'm failing if i don't have time to pray
[1:58:46] and consecrate myself to god i'm going
[1:58:48] to blunder the whole day i need god and
[1:58:51] i need to focus like never before
[1:58:58] what's that to thee
[1:59:01] follow thou me
[1:59:03] what does it matter if all the world
[1:59:05] forsake you paul
[1:59:08] as long as you can say
[1:59:10] i fought a good fight
[1:59:12] i finished my course
[1:59:15] i kept the faith
[1:59:20] but what about this and what about that
[1:59:23] i fought the good fight
[1:59:26] i finished my course
[1:59:30] i kept the faith
[1:59:32] i said that's
[1:59:34] my full-time objective to keep myself in
[1:59:37] that scripture amen
[1:59:40] let things come and let things go storms
[1:59:42] will rise and storms will fall
[1:59:46] things will happen that we don't like
[1:59:47] political moves will move
[1:59:50] pressures will come economic things will
[1:59:52] happen
[1:59:54] devices and divisions and hurtful things
[1:59:57] and family issues and and work crisis
[2:00:00] and
[2:00:02] it's going to come
[2:00:03] it's going to ebb and the flow as it
[2:00:06] ebbs and flows it'll increase and get
[2:00:07] worse more storms and more hurricanes
[2:00:10] and more tornadoes more fires and more
[2:00:13] destruction
[2:00:15] but there's one thing i have to do
[2:00:18] is follow him
[2:00:21] forsaking all others
[2:00:23] brother venom says in one place he's
[2:00:25] he's referring to the bride amen
[2:00:28] sticking with the word and he goes to
[2:00:30] marriage vows
[2:00:32] he's speaking of the bride obeying and
[2:00:34] following the headship of christ and he
[2:00:36] goes right back to marriage vows and he
[2:00:38] says keeply keep thee only to him
[2:00:41] for all of your life whatsoever thou
[2:00:43] doest
[2:00:44] keep the only unto him
[2:00:46] and he says no adultery no flirting with
[2:00:48] the world nothing else
[2:00:51] brother ben brings us right back to the
[2:00:52] marriage vows that's my headship this
[2:00:54] word that's coming this day i've been
[2:00:56] united to through an invisible union and
[2:00:58] i'm to keep only to him and forsake all
[2:01:01] others
[2:01:03] and that is a full-time job for me you
[2:01:06] might have polished it off all right and
[2:01:07] you might be able to do it
[2:01:08] half-heartedly but i can't
[2:01:11] it's requiring
[2:01:12] all of my devotion
[2:01:14] all of my consecration all of my life
[2:01:17] and all of my love
[2:01:19] just to walk this course he's called for
[2:01:21] me to walk
[2:01:23] i think that's what he's looking for
[2:01:27] his heart's desire was to have a bride
[2:01:29] of his own choosing
[2:01:31] and he wanted to manifest that bride
[2:01:34] so he did a work in our day that no
[2:01:37] other age has seen and never been
[2:01:39] recorded like it's been recorded in our
[2:01:41] day why why did all that happen why did
[2:01:43] the seals open why did he open the
[2:01:46] mystery of god because he wanted a
[2:01:48] people equipped with the word that could
[2:01:49] surrender to the word so when you
[2:01:51] receive the word you receive the life of
[2:01:54] the word and the life of the word begins
[2:01:55] to live in you and god can demonstrate
[2:01:57] to this world what a bride is what it
[2:02:00] means to be submissive to the world what
[2:02:02] it means to have somebody that he can
[2:02:04] entrust to follow him
[2:02:07] we've received what no other age has
[2:02:09] received
[2:02:11] so we should walk like no other age has
[2:02:13] walked
[2:02:15] god is saying what's that to thee
[2:02:18] i'll say it this morning because there's
[2:02:20] a cry in my heart what's that to thee
[2:02:23] follow thou me
[2:02:26] but but my my husband but my wife button
[2:02:29] my children but my job but my
[2:02:32] what's that to thee
[2:02:35] follow thou me
[2:02:38] but all men has forsaken me what's that
[2:02:40] to thee
[2:02:41] follow thou on me
[2:02:43] christ had already told us to forsake
[2:02:45] everything
[2:02:46] and follow him
[2:02:49] so i say tonight or this morning or
[2:02:51] whatever time it is
[2:02:54] what's that to thee
[2:02:57] follow thou me
[2:03:00] follow him and everything he reveals
[2:03:02] follow him in every part of your life
[2:03:05] follow him your public life your private
[2:03:07] life your work life your church life
[2:03:09] follow thou me
[2:03:12] who is he
[2:03:13] the revealed word in this day
[2:03:16] the headship that has been restored the
[2:03:18] mystery of god that has been revealed
[2:03:20] the entire bible now opened to us that's
[2:03:24] him
[2:03:25] the word is him the revelation is him
[2:03:28] the headship is him
[2:03:30] and he's saying
[2:03:32] follow
[2:03:32] thou
[2:03:34] me
[2:03:36] praise god
[2:03:38] and i'm saying
[2:03:39] god help me
[2:03:41] to follow you
[2:03:44] i'm a fresh surrendering right now to
[2:03:46] follow you
[2:03:48] i'm freshly giving up everything to
[2:03:50] follow you i've done it before but i'll
[2:03:52] do it again and i'll wake up every
[2:03:53] morning and do it all over again but i'm
[2:03:55] surrendering all to follow you
[2:03:57] because there's no greater calling in
[2:03:59] life and there's no greater privilege to
[2:04:02] than to be this end time bride
[2:04:05] and to be one of the faithful
[2:04:07] by their own choosing
[2:04:09] and i'm choosing
[2:04:10] to follow you
[2:04:13] let's all stand
[2:04:14] musicians you come brother blake if
[2:04:16] you'll come
[2:04:22] let's just pray
[2:04:24] lord jesus we thank you god
[2:04:28] god you've called us to an hour
[2:04:31] like has never been on the face of the
[2:04:33] earth before
[2:04:35] you've called us to a position that no
[2:04:38] other age is held
[2:04:41] you've given us a word
[2:04:43] and greater clarity with greater
[2:04:44] revelation than any others have had
[2:04:47] and god you said to whom much is given
[2:04:49] much is required
[2:04:52] but god you didn't make a requirement
[2:04:54] without providing a means
[2:04:57] so you gave us your word in full measure
[2:04:59] and you gave us your life in full
[2:05:00] measure
[2:05:01] so if we could just receive the word and
[2:05:03] surrender we could receive that full
[2:05:05] measure of life to live the word
[2:05:08] god we're surrendering you're just
[2:05:10] asking us to choose you and choose the
[2:05:12] word and you'll provide everything else
[2:05:13] like you provided
[2:05:15] or for your bride like you provided for
[2:05:17] esther
[2:05:19] help us lord just to take what you've
[2:05:20] provided and to put it on
[2:05:24] just to stay under the washing of the
[2:05:25] water the word for purification to put
[2:05:27] on the clothes of the word for
[2:05:29] beautification and perfection and
[2:05:31] righteousness
[2:05:33] god may your mind take over our mind
[2:05:36] may this revelation become our daily
[2:05:38] meet become our life become our whole
[2:05:40] objective
[2:05:42] may we not be disobedient to the
[2:05:44] heavenly vision
[2:05:46] for the heavenly vision has given us a
[2:05:48] commission
[2:05:49] to be the bride at the end time
[2:05:52] may those of us who've seen it lord be
[2:05:54] faithful
[2:05:56] to obey
[2:05:57] the heavenly vision
[2:05:59] to run our course fight the good fight
[2:06:03] to keep the faith
[2:06:06] while we yield ourselves to you
[2:06:08] as a body of believers together we yield
[2:06:10] to you but we know you're looking for
[2:06:12] the individual now
[2:06:14] the one of us or two of us do three or a
[2:06:17] hundred or however many they'll be that
[2:06:19] will say lord that is in my heart lord
[2:06:22] what i heard preached is my cry is my
[2:06:24] longing is my desire
[2:06:27] god
[2:06:28] i pray lord that you would meet that
[2:06:30] desire in each of your children's heart
[2:06:32] god whatever they're struggling with i
[2:06:34] pray that you give them victory over it
[2:06:36] lord
[2:06:37] god whatever they want to lay down i
[2:06:39] pray you give them the willpower to lay
[2:06:40] it down and that you would give them the
[2:06:42] strength to walk away that you would
[2:06:43] provide your spirit to help overcome
[2:06:45] those things
[2:06:47] god if we can make our choice lord i
[2:06:49] pray you would back up our choices
[2:06:52] by your spirit
[2:06:54] god as we choose you i pray you come and
[2:06:56] live inside of us
[2:06:58] and manifest yourself through us in
[2:07:00] greater measures than you ever had
[2:07:01] before
[2:07:02] that more of us will die and more of you
[2:07:04] will live
[2:07:06] that will have a greater surrender and a
[2:07:07] greater desire to see your will
[2:07:09] fulfilled
[2:07:10] and we'll take all our own desires lord
[2:07:13] and all the desires for the world lord
[2:07:15] and we're throwing them aside
[2:07:17] right now we're choosing to throw them
[2:07:19] aside
[2:07:21] and asking lord that you would come and
[2:07:22] take that place
[2:07:24] take that preeminence that you're

[2:07:27] threefold plan

[2:07:39] yielding themselves to you now
[2:07:41] may you walk in us
[2:07:43] may you live in us
[2:07:45] lord i pray our greatest desire would be
[2:07:48] to look on the balcony
[2:07:50] at the end of our journey
[2:07:52] and see you nod
[2:07:54] and say well done
[2:07:56] god that's my greatest desire let it be
[2:07:59] that way
