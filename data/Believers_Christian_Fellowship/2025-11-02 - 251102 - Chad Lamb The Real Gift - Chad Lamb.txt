Shut in with God. Shut [singing] in [music] with God in [singing] a secret place. [music] There [singing] in the spirit be holy his [singing and music] face gave [singing] me [music] new power to run [singing] in the race. I [music] long to be shed [singing] [music] [music and singing] with God in [music] a secret [singing] place. There in [music] the spirit beholding [singing] [music] his face. gaining [music] new [singing] power to run in the race. How [singing] I long to be [music] sh with God. Amen. Let's bow our heads together [music] and pray. Lord Jesus, God, we want to shut in with you right now and enter into [music] that place, Lord, where we can commune with you and you with us and you can feed us, Lord, your word. [music] God, we're asking you, we're inviting you, Lord, to come to the head of the table now as we sit to dine. That you would take the bread of life and you would break it, Lord, and pass it to us and feed us by your own hand, Lord. For we are the sheep of your pasture and you're the great shepherd of our souls. [music] And God, we've come to you, Lord, out of reverence and respect. Now, we've sung your praises because we love you. We want to glorify your name. Now, we long to feed from you that portion that you have. May you reveal yourself to us again this morning. May you take these lips of mine under your control. [music] May you speak eternal words, precious words of life. May they proceed forth into the hearts of your children. Lord, may you have preeminence among us. May you have your way as you move, Lord, in this place and in our hearts and in our lives. For we want [music] you to have that first place. We thank you for this opportunity. We pray you'd bless all that's said and done. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Man, while you're standing, if you want to turn with me to the book of Luke. Amen. We'll begin there. We just want to say God bless you and good morning. And we're very happy to have brother George Wyinners with us. Amen. All the way up from Louisiana. Amen. His name is Wyinners, but he lives in warm Louisiana. So, he's getting a little pretaste of our winner. Amen. And as I mentioned uh to you last service, Brother George is going to be sharing his testimony with us before communion here at the communion service. Uh and we've been familiar with Brother George for many years as he's worked in Japan. And we've been involved as a church with that work. And him and I have been sharing for quite a quite a while. and he's got an amazing testimony of what God has done in him and through him and and the work that he's used him for and the burden that he has. And so I'm excited for him to come this evening and share that. Uh brother Ron won't be giving his missionary report. This will take the place of that. And so just come expecting and and enjoy what uh listening to what God can do through a vessel. Amen. And and I enjoy hearing his testimonies. Also, he brought with him his pastor, Brother Jeremy Kner. He's the pastor there in Manning, Louisiana. And it didn't dawn on me till today when I was thinking I was going to introduce this pastor that when when brother Brandham went along with Banks Woods Hunting, that old man said, "Have you got so low down woods that you got to pack your pastor with you everywhere you go?" I thought, "Man, they must not trust you away from home, brother. They send the pastor to look after you." But but God bless you, brother Jeremy. It's good to have you here, too. And we'll have brother Jeremy this evening also just greet everybody and say hello and bring greetings from their home. So the communion service will be this afternoon. We have communion and feet washing after the testimony. Amen. So let's look here at the book of Luke chapter 18. Luke chapter 18. Luke 18:E8. He says, "I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? It's a good question. Shall he find faith on the earth? Let's turn to Hebrews 11 now. Hebrews chapter 11 and then we'll read verse 6. Hebrews 11 and 6. But without faith it is impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. &gt;&gt; Now turn with me to Ephesians. We'll read one more before we take our seats. Ephesians chapter 2. Ephesians 2 and8. For by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God. Amen. God bless you as you take your seats. Amen. So we find out that Jesus asked when the son of man cometh. We know the coming of the son of man is the same time as the revealing of the son of man. And we've seen that. Amen. Through the prophetic ministry of brother Brandham. And when the son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? That's the question. So when the son of man cometh, what is he looking for? Amen. He's looking for faith. &gt;&gt; That's what he's looked for in every age, in every dispensation. He's looked for his children that will believe his word. That's what he found in Abraham. Somebody who will believe. That's what he found in Noah. That's what he found in Moses. Somebody that would believe his word. And in this time when the son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth. And then in Hebrews, Paul tells us that without faith, it's impossible to please God. Amen. There's not works that we can do. There's not not any system that we can hold to or anything that we can do in ourselves to please him. Without faith, it's impossible to please him. &gt;&gt; So, will he find faith on the earth? Because that's the only thing that will please him. &gt;&gt; But then in Ephesians 2, the Apostle Paul says, "For by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God." Oh, I thank God that he's given a gift that will meet the requirement. If the requirement is faith, God's given a gift that'll meet the requirement. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. If we could bring up the PowerPoint, please. Amen. We'll we'll start. I want to title this the real gift. And I'm going to taking this right from a quote. I'm going to read that quote to you next. And that's that's where the title comes from. The real gift. Something Brother Brandham said, and I want to take a look at it. And I've got quite a few uh uh quotes and scriptures I want to go through. Amen. I thank God for the PowerPoint so I can move fast and we can all stay together. Amen. But but pay close attention. And there's just something really profound in my heart. And it's I I say profound, it's not profound. It's simple. It's something we talk about all the time, but it keeps hitting me again and again and again. Amen. So, I love to talk about it because this message has come. It's unveiled so much for us. It's given us a reality, amen, that transcends everything we see, everything we can touch, everything we feel. Amen. There's a greater reality that we live by &gt;&gt; than the realities of this natural world and natural eyesight or even humanistic thinking. There's something that's been delivered to us that takes us far beyond all of that and it's a marvelous thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the message, things that are to be, brother says, I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That still has nothing to do with it. That is a statement, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That still has nothing to do with it. That's just only a temporal gift for you. &gt;&gt; The real gift is your soul down in there. seed that was born of God and that controls the whole thing through the word of God and the will of God and there you grow up see then you're a son and daughter of God you're a child of God and these things as you come up like the mother now you're in the bowels of the earth trying to come forth you're a son of God coming forth and you see the word say I should do this I should be born again well I belong to the church that don't mean one thing I'm a Methodist my that's good for your mother well my I'm Pentecostal I belong that if you don't line with that word, there is something wrong. &gt;&gt; Then you see your real father ain't God. Because that real start in your soul before there even was a spirit, it was your soul. That soul didn't come from God. Then it wasn't a germ of God to begin. You're deceived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So just saying, "I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost." He said, "That has nothing to do with it." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean, that's a magnificent statement that the prophet made. And the only the only reason I'll say it is because he said it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because what he's showing us is you you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And that can be an anointing that falls upon you and can even move you to expressions that are scriptural expressions. Amen. But but the real gift, the real thing is not the gift of the Holy Ghost. The gift of the Holy Ghost is the wake up the real gift which is a gene of God that's in your soul. &gt;&gt; That's the real That's what brother said is the real GIFT IS THAT SOUL. AMEN. And and that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost came for. It came TO WAKE UP THAT SEED of God that is laying there dormant to bring it to life. Amen. To bring us to the realization of sons and daughters of God to quicken us and to grow us into the manifestation of sons and daughters of God. So the real gift is that soul. Amen. And if he said if you don't line with that word there's something wrong. You can have all kinds of manifestations and all kinds of gifts. Amen. And there's nothing wrong with the gifts, but the gifts without this gift. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The gifts without the real gift. Amen. It it won't bring about what we want it to bring about. It won't accomplish what we're hoping to accomplish. Amen. So be that real start in your soul. Before there even was a spirit, it was your soul. That soul DIDN'T COME FROM GOD. WHY DIDN'T IT COME FROM GOD? If it won't cope with the word, it didn't come from God. Then it wasn't a germ of God to begin with, and you're deceived. He says in the message leadership the choice of your conduct you can't mix it now you're either for God or against God and the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside the Many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says though Uh-huh that's exactly right it's another one of those Unbelievable statements. I grew up in the Pentecostal church and we would have never said anything like this. But we got a prophet who understands so much more. Amen. He's tapped into the mind of God. He's the veil's been taken off of the word. He's understanding exactly where he's standing. And he knows exactly what he's saying is the truth. Amen. You can have the baptism. The baptism means a dip and immersion. You can have a dip and immersion in the Holy Ghost. True, genuine Holy Ghost. But the dip and immersion in the Holy Ghost is meant to wake up or quicken a seed of life that's already on the inside. And you can be dipped, immersed, amen, uh, submerged into the atmosphere of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But if there's nothing there to quicken, nothing will quicken. &gt;&gt; THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WASN'T THE TRUE HOLY GHOST. IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU WEREN'T immersed in the true Holy Ghost. Amen. BUT BUT THAT THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. The issue is what is the HOLY GHOST FOR? WHAT DID IT COME to do? IT COME TO WAKE UP THAT SEED. IT COME TO INDWELL WHERE THAT SEED IS AND BRING LIFE TO IT AND GROW IT INTO THE FULL STATURE of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in our lives. &gt;&gt; Not just an anointing, but anointing to do something &gt;&gt; to accomplish a purpose. Now, look at this scripture. We we've looked at this here recently. Matthew chapter 7 said, ' Not everyone that saith unto me,Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven. Many will say to me that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? And in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works. And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you. Depart from me, ye that work iniquity. This is an outstanding scripture. As we we talked about a couple services ago, they're coming to the white throne judgment. This is a scene of the white throne judgment, and they're talking to the the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords. And at the white throne judgment, I said this before, nobody's lying. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Nobody's standing before God at the light throne judgment and making anything up. And Jesus doesn't discount or disregard anything they say. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, we can take from this scripture that they really did do these things. Amen. They said, "Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, HAVE WE NOT PROPHESIED IN THY NAME?" LISTEN, THEY'RE CALLING him Lord, declaring that he's their Lord. They know who he is. They know who Jesus Christ is, and he's their Lord. And they said, "We have prophesied in thy name." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND IN THY name have cast out devils. And in thy name done many wonderful works. Listen, if we if we live a life on this earth where we CAN CALL JESUS CHRIST our Lord, Amen. And then we can by his name prophesy and it come to pass. AND BY HIS NAME CAST OUT devils and they go and by his name do many wonderful works and signs. Amen. We may get the feeling of security because we're taking the Lord's name and ACCOMPLISHING GREAT WORKS. BUT THAT WAS NO SECURITY for these guys. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS NEVER JUDGED HIM FOR THEIR good works. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; HE NEVER SAID DEPART FROM ME. HE NEVER SAID YOU DIDN'T DO those things or because of those things. THOSE THINGS WERE FINE. AMEN. NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PROPHECY, THE CASTING OUT DEVILS, the many mighty works. THOSE WERE FINE. BUT WHY DID HE CAST them out? He said, he said, "Depart from me, ye that work iniquity." This is why, Amen. This is why they were sent away from the presence of the Lord. Because brother Bam tells us, iniquity is when you know to do something and you don't do it. &gt;&gt; There is something in the word. THEY SAW THE WORD, BUT they didn't obey the word. Although they had many signs and wonderful miracles and these works are done by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet they were in iniquity. Iniquity because there was some part of the word that they were refusing. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; All I say is God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in things that are, our brother said in things that are to be. Now there will be false anointed ones in the last days. Not false Jesus. They wouldn't stand for that. But false anointed. They are anointed. Yes, sir. But they are antichrist. They're anointed with the spirit to do the signs and wonders that Christ did, but won't line up with his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they're anointed. Brother said a true spirit, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they're anointed to do the signs and wonders that Christ did, but won't line up with his word. &gt;&gt; See, it's another type of deception where you can have selfdeception, thinking that we're okay because the works, because the miracles, because the signs, Amen. But they won't line up with his word. And when they wouldn't line up with his word, because they weren't line up with his word, brother Brandham says that they're antichrist &gt;&gt; because Christ is the word. To be against the word is to be antichrist. &gt;&gt; Let's turn to John chapter 3 together. John chapter 3 verse one said there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews. The same came to Jesus by night and said unto him, "Rabbi, we know that thou are a teacher come from God, for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him." Jesus answered and said unto him, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus saith unto them, "How can a man be born when he is old, can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?" Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou heareest the sound thereof, but cast not tell whence it cometh, and wheither it goeth. So is everyone that is born of the spirit. Nicodemus is coming by night because he's afraid of of his colleagues. And he comes at night to talk to this great rabbi who he knows is a man sent from God because nobody can do the works that he does unless God be with him. And Jesus says, "Listen, but unless you're born again," Amen. You cannot see the kingdom of heaven. You can't even see it. Then later he says, "You can't enter into it." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So you don't even have eyes to see, Amen. that that what the kingdom of God is unless you're born again. And Nicodemus, amen, with a carnal mind, he doesn't understand this term being born again. He said, "How can I, who am already old, go back into my mother's womb and be born a second time?" What do you mean by born again? And Jesus says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, born of the spirit. You have to be born of water and of the spirit." He's talking about spiritual birth. The new birth is a spiritual birth. And why does there have to be a new birth? Amen. Brother Bam tells us so clearly. It's because our first birth is wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We come a perverted way. Amen. God never intended for us to come by sex desire where man decides by his own will when to procreate. Amen. That was not God's design. So there was a fall in the Garden of Eden and that brought a hybridization and through that hybridization in the self-will of man brought a perversion. Brother Benham said God made a world to take you out of to be a human being to be a son and daughter of God. Amen. And it WAS PERVERTED THAT WAY. GOT PERVERTED. He said, "You came anyhow. You came wrong, but you came anyhow." &gt;&gt; SO, WE CAME WRONG. SO, OUR FIRST birth birthed US INTO DEATH. AMEN. THAT'S WHY WE MUST BE BORN again because of the fall in the Garden of Eden. The new birth is vindication of serpent seed doctrine. &gt;&gt; That's the reason you have to be born again is because the first birth is wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we have to be born by the spirit. The spirit of God, amen, has to quicken that seed to life. And look at verse eight. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou be hearest the sound thereof, but cast not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth. The wind that passes through, Amen. If it's passing by you, you can feel the wind as it's moving. You can hear it rustling through the trees or moving around whatever object is near you. You can hear, see, feel the effect of the wind. But the wind is invisible. It's an invisible force and you can't tell where it came from and you can't tell where it's going. &gt;&gt; And Jesus didn't say this is what the spirit's like. No, he's not saying that's what the spirit's like. He says so is everyone that is born of the spirit. So the actual individuals that are born of the spirit are like the wind. &gt;&gt; You can see them here present. You can see, FEEL, HEAR THE EFFECT OF THEIR LIFE. BUT YOU DON'T know where they came from or where they going. Because where they came from is invisible to you. And where they're going is invisible to you. WHEN YOU FEEL THE WIND, TRY TO GUESS WHERE THE WIND CAME FROM. &gt;&gt; WHERE DID IT COME FROM? AMEN. WHERE DID THE WIND GOING TO? WHERE DID IT START AND WHERE'S ITS DESTINATION? YOU'LL NEVER FIGURE IT OUT. AMEN. AND NOBODY THAT KNOWS YOU CAN FIGURE OUT, AMEN. WHERE YOU CAME FROM AND WHERE YOU GO. BUT there was one there's one thing in creation that knows where it came from and where it went to and THAT'S THE WIND ITSELF BECAUSE IT CAME FROM SOMEWHERE and it's going from somewhere. AND SPIRITUAL BIRTH CONNECTS US BACK TO OUR ORIGIN WHERE WE CAME FROM AND IS DECLARING TO US WHERE we're going. &gt;&gt; WE CAME FROM ETERNITY. WE'RE GOING BACK TO ETERNITY. AND JUST LIKE THE WIND CAME FROM SOMEWHERE, WENT TO SOMEWHERE, BUT MADE ITSELF MANIFEST IN THE PRESENT TIME. THAT'S LIKE EVERYONE THAT'S BORN OF THE SPIRIT. THAT'S LIKE YOU AND ME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We're just LIKE THE WIND. I CAME FROM SOMEWHERE. AMEN. I DIDN'T JUST APPEAR HERE. I CAME FROM SOMEWHERE. YOU'RE SENSING MY PRESENCE. YOU'RE ACKNOWLEDGING I'M HERE. AMEN. BUT YOU CAN'T TELL WHERE I CAME FROM OR WHERE I'M GOING. BUT I KNOW BY SPIRITUAL BIRTH WHERE I CAME FROM AND WHERE I'M GOING. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING BACK TO WHERE I CAME FROM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. It's a mystery to everybody else on the earth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But the spiritual birth brings us back in contact with our origin. &gt;&gt; So God says you must be born again. You must have this spiritual new birth. But in order to be a birth there has to be a seed. &gt;&gt; In the church age book, brother Bam says this in the Smyrnan church age. Now then there we are coming to a conclusion. As the eternal logos, God was manifest in the son and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and the eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby [clears throat] gained the title of son. Even so we eternal in his thoughts and our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh. And those eternal thoughts now manifest in the flesh are the sons of God. Even as we were so called, we did not become seed by the rebirth. Do you see that all in capital letters? Are we reading the same thing? We did not become seed by the rebirth. We were seed and therefore were reborn. For only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened. In nonseed there is nothing to quicken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So both seed and nonseed can experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But the seed when they experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost it quickens the seed to life. Amen. In nonseed there's nothing to quicken although they can experience an immersion in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Again this is next paragraph he says hold this carefully in mind. Now take the next step. Redeem means to buy back. It restores to the original owner. God by his death, the shed blood bought back his own. He bought back the spoken word seed bride. My sheep hear my voice. &gt;&gt; Word. What's his voice? His word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's his word in this day? The message of the hour. &gt;&gt; If you hear the message of the hour, that's his voice. If you hear his voice and follow, you're a sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh man, I just I just I like to just inject this right here. LISTEN, THE PROBLEM WITH ALL OF US and so many of us in our carnality and humanity, we go into look into a natural earthly mirror and we we analyze ourselves and we find within ourselves reasons why we should not be children of God. We find all kinds of complexes and and all kinds of habits AND WE GOT THOUGHT PATTERNS and we've got traditional thinking from our parents and genetic malformities. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; WE GOT ALL KINDS OF THINGS ABOUT US THAT WE JUST don't like. And we can analyze that in the in the natural mirror and we can come up with a list of many reasons why there's no way I can be a sheep. I can't be a child of God. I can't do this and that. Amen. But the Bible never uses that as an identification of sunship. The identification of sunship is always if you can hear his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "My sheep hear my voice, ANOTHER THEY'LL NOT FOLLOW." WHEN YOU HEAR THE VOICE OF THE SHEPHERD AND CHOOSE NOT TO FOLLOW ANY OTHER VOICE, BUT FOLLOW THIS VOICE, IT IS AN indication you're a sheep. It doesn't matter how deformed you are, how many limps you have, if you've got lice. Amen. IF YOU GOT EAR MITES, IF YOU'RE BLIND, IF YOU'RE DEAF, IT DOES NOT MATTER THE QUALITY OF THE SHEEP. THAT'S GOD'S SHEEP BECAUSE IT'S FOLLOWING THE SHEPHERD. &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO STOP LOOKING INTO A NATURAL MIRROR AND ANALYZING OUR CARNALITY TO DETERMINE WHAT WE ARE. WE'VE GOT TO DIG A LITTLE DEEPER BY FAITH AND SAY, "WHAT IS IT THAT I BELIEVE?" &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice word and they follow me. You always were a sheep. You never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep. That is impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind. And there is no change in species. &gt;&gt; As we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh. There had to come a day when we would hear his voice, the word &gt;&gt; and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are the sons of God. We heard his voice and we cried out as did the prodical son, "Save me, oh my father. I'm returning to thee." &gt;&gt; Now look at this part of this quote. Amen. And his voice, which is the word, we became aware of our father calling us. When we heard the voice, when we heard the word for our day through a prophet messenger brought us the voice of God, the word of God. Amen. And when we heard that voice, [snorts] we recognized our father. calling us. &gt;&gt; We didn't recognize a preacher preaching. We didn't RECOGNIZE A PROPHET PROPHESYING. AMEN. WHAT WE recognize when we heard that word and RECOGNIZED THAT THAT IS absolutely the TRUE WORD OF GOD. WHAT YOU HEARD WAS YOUR FATHER calling you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND THE DEVIL WILL TRY TO TELL YOU, WELL, YOU JUST HEARD A good preacher and you agreed with it and it SOUNDED GOOD TO YOU. WHY DID IT SOUND GOOD TO YOU? WHY DID YOU AGREE WITH IT WHEN MILLIONS HAVE WALKED AWAY AND MILLIONS HEARD IT AND DISCOUNTED IT AND DISCREDIT IT AND DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF IT, BUT SOMETHING IN YOU RESONATED WITH THAT VOICE AND YOU SAID, "THAT SOUNDS LIKE TRUTH TO ME." THAT'S NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. WHAT YOU WERE RECOGNIZING WAS YOUR FATHER CALLING YOU. IF THAT'S YOUR FATHER, THEN YOU'RE A SON. WHO'S THE FATHER CALLING YOU? GOD ALMIGHTY MAKING you a child of God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; WE MAKE IT SO COMPLICATED. WE GET SO TWISTED UP IN OUR MINDS. WE GO OUT TOMORROW and we make a mistake at work and we say something wrong and we do something that WE REGRET AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE SAY, "I I I MUST NOT BE ONE OF THEM." LISTEN, YOU MAY BE THE WORST SON HE'S GOT. YOU MAY BE DISOBEDIENT AND REBELLIOUS AND NEED ALL KINDS OF CORRECTION, BUT YOU'RE STILL A SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; SHOW ME ANYONE THAT WAS PERFECT. SHOW ME THE GOOD ONES. AMEN. IT'S NOT GOOD CONDUCT THAT HE'S LOOKING FOR. IT'S FAITH THAT HE'S LOOKING FOR. WHO CAN HEAR HIS VOICE? WHO CAN BELIEVE HIM? &gt;&gt; SO, brother J, SHOULDN'T IT CHANGE OUR CONDUCT? ABSOLUTELY, it should change our conduct. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE IN A CHANGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I believe in THE NEW BIRTH IS A CHANGE that your nature's changed. YOUR DESIRES HAS CHANGED. YOUR CONDUCT CHANGES. BUT BROTHER SAID, YOU STILL GOT AN OLD STICKY COCKA burn nature THAT'S GOING TO BOTHER YOU AS long as you're in it. &gt;&gt; He said you're going to MAKE MISTAKES. HE ALSO SAID, "THERE'S TRAPS SET FOR YOU AND YOU'RE GOING TO FALL INTO THEM." &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. I'm so glad he said it. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he fell into traps himself and told us about it so we can realize that the path of a son or daughter of God, it may not be perfection as we call perfection and it may not be clean the way we think's clean. But God is not looking at perfection and conduct. God is looking at faith. &gt;&gt; He sent his spirit. He sends his word. He's constantly molding us and changing us and bringing us into his image. He's giving us the power to live the word by the power of his spirit. He's giving us overcoming power. And he's changing us from glory unto glory. It's a process where we're growing in his likeness. Amen. And as we're growing in his likeness, Amen. We may not we may NOT FIRE ON ALL EIGHT cylinders all the time, but we should be changing, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. But where's my identification coming from? his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the resonant inside of me that says that's the truth. &gt;&gt; Peter tells us, "Being born again, not of corruptible seed." I I'm going to I'm going to write this out. I've done this many times. Corruptible seed. What's that? natural seed &gt;&gt; from your first birth, &gt;&gt; but of incorruptible. &gt;&gt; Incorruptible what? Seed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What's the incorruptible seed? The seed gene &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; We're not born again. Nicodemus said, "Can I go back into my world?" No. That's corruptible seed. That's perversion. But we're born again of the incorruptible seed. And how? We're born again by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever. The word of God come. Amen. And the spirit of that word comes to wake up that incorruptible seed. That's how we're born again. When the spirit comes in contact with that seed, &gt;&gt; it quickens it to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's keep moving. I think yeah in the Smyrna church a said a son of God can go a long time before he recognizes that he's a son &gt;&gt; in fact a lot of true Christians are like the story of the baby eagle that was hatched out under a hen you know that eagle is a type of the true believer tells this story over and over and you guys if you've been around the message for any length of time you've heard it numerous times but it's just as good the thousandth time as it was the first &gt;&gt; because God says that you know A farmer wanted to set a batch of eggs and and so he had one egg short. So he climbed up into an eagle's nest and he took one egg out, put it under the hen. The hen sat there and hatched it out. And there was all these chicks plus one little eagle. And the eagle was a misfit all of his life. Thought he WAS A CHICKEN. IDENTIFIED with the chickens, lived in the barnyard, ate, scratched, tried to do everything they DID, BUT IT WAS ALWAYS KIND OF A MISFIT for him until one day another eagle come flying over the barnyard and screamed. And when the eagle screamed, something in him connected to the scream. &gt;&gt; And the the chickens were afraid of the scream. They ran and hide. The eagle looked up and said, "WHAT IS THAT SOUND? &gt;&gt; I've never heard ANYTHING LIKE IT." AND WHEN THEY IT SCREAMED, SOMETHING INSIDE OF HIM SCREAMED BACK THAT RESONATED INSIDE. IT WASN'T A FEARFUL SOUND. IT WAS A WONDERFUL SOUND. IT WASN'T A CONFUSING SOUND. IT WAS THE SOUND THAT WAS FINALLY ENDING HIS CONFUSION. &gt;&gt; AND HE LOOKED UP AND HE SAW MAMA EAGLE AND SAID, "MAMA, HOW COULD I GET UP?" JUST FLAP YOUR WINGS. YOU WERE BORN TO FLY. YOU'RE MADE TO BE THIS. YOU'RE AN eagle to begin with. &gt;&gt; And brother tells this story over and over many times. And here in the message it is the rising of the sun. He says and God knows he's got a predestinated for ordained church. He know he's got sons and daughters and a bride waiting somewhere when the Holy Spirit begins to fly over at that wave sheath. That wave sheath was the first part of the word to come to full harvest maturity. And we saw that in the ministry of brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that wave sheep waved over. He said he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Not some mythical story but a reality. No matter how many tried to tell him eagle, he didn't know what an eagle was. Yet he was a eagle. He would not understand it until he seen something that reflected him, that he reflected rather. And when we see not a denomination, not a PhD, not an LLD, not a good neighbor, but a son of God molded in the image of God with the dynamic power of God to answer the requests of this day that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. There ain't no h going to hold you. We saw that God manifests that through brother Brandham. He says he hunts for his mama. He's an eagle to begin with. He recognizes this real eagle recognizes the call of God's word. Why? He's an eagle. An eagle to an eagle. The word before the foundation. The word to the word. The word predestinated to the word written for the hour. You realize your position. So now brother takes it from the story of eagle screaming to eagle screaming. Now he takes it from a predestinated word. That's you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you're a child of God. Amen. What is that C gene of you? It's a thought of God. It's a word. It's a thought expressed inside of you. And that word has got to connect with the word written for the hour. &gt;&gt; The predestinated word has to come in contact with the word written for the hour. &gt;&gt; The word predestinated to the word written for the hour. You realize your position. He hunts for it. Then this earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit of God to obedience to the word. Amen. We can't get this backwards. We can't bring obedience to the word and then have quickening power. It takes the quickening power of the spirit of God to bring this body in obedience to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to realize what we are, who we are, where we came from. Luke 19. Let's turn here together. Luke 19 [snorts] and verse one. [snorts] It says, "And Jesus entered entered and passed through Jericho. And behold, there was a man named Zakius, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. And he sought to see Jesus, who he was, and could not for the press, because he was little of stature. And he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him and said unto him, "Zakius, make haste and come down, for today I must abide at thy house." And he made haste and came down and received him joyfully. And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying that he was gone to be guests with a man that is a sinner. And Zakius stood and said unto the Lord, "Behold, behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore him four-fold." And Jesus said unto him, "This day is salvation come to this house. for as much as he also is a son of Abraham. For the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost. &gt;&gt; Jesus if Jesus didn't come to convert goats into sheep. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus didn't come to find sheep. Jesus came to find his sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "The son of man seeketh to save that which is lost." He said, "The son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost." &gt;&gt; You can't lose something that you didn't previously have. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, this is my pen. &gt;&gt; If I lose my pen, I can look all over and I say, "Oh, here's the pen that I lost. This is my pen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if somebody else lost this pen and it was never my pen &gt;&gt; and I come by and say, "Oh, there's my pen." That's not my pen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is somebody else's lost pen. &gt;&gt; It's not my lost pen. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; And Jesus came to find his lost sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He come in contact with all kinds of Pharisees and all kinds of Sadducees and scribes and religious men and political figures and they were dressed nice and acted right, paid tithe and did all kinds of stuff. Amen. But but none of them would follow his voice, proving that none of them were his sheep. &gt;&gt; They rejected his voice on every hand proving they were not sheep of his fold because his sheep hear his voice and another they'll not follow. Amen. So now he's looking for his sheep. And it's amazing the places that Jesus goes looking for his sheep cuz he knows where they are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It takes him TO A WOMAN THAT'S CAUGHT IN IN MULTIPLE MARRIAGES, CAUGHT in adultery, in a cycle of adultery. He takes her to a well. TAKES HIM TO THE BOTTOM of the tree where Zakius is hiding. Listen, there's not another soul in Israel that believes Zakius &gt;&gt; is seed of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when Jesus goes to his house, he said, "How can he go and eat with somebody who's a sinner? HE WAS A PUBLICAN. AND BY HIS OWN CONFESSION, HE was robbing the people." &gt;&gt; SAID, "LORD, IF I HAVE DONE ANYTHING, IF I'VE TAKEN ANYTHING, I'LL RESTORE FOR." LISTEN, HE'S SAYING, "I'VE TAKEN FROM PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; I've been ripping OFF MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS." And they hated him for it. Amen. And nobody was looking at Zakius. Zakius wasn't acting like a believer. He wasn't pretending to be a believer. He wasn't doing any deeds of righteousness. But Jesus wasn't looking for people doing deeds of righteousness. He came looking for his lost sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND HE COME UNDERNEATH A TREE and he STOPPED &gt;&gt; AND HE LOOKED UP. ZAKIUS WAS SMALL OF STATURE, DESPISED. LISTEN, IT'S ONE THING when a big hulk of a man robs you blind, but when this little pipsqueak &gt;&gt; is stealing your money and cheating you out of taxes. Listen, I imagine the discussions at home when men was what I'd like to do to that Zakius. He was hated. He was despised. Jesus looked up said, "Zakius, come down for today I'm going to eat with you. What was he look? He was he was finding his lost sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Goes in to eat with him and everybody else is just mesmerized, disappointed, uh uh upset, whatever they were that he went to eat with the sinner. But Zakius was overjoyed. There was something about coming in contact with the living word that did something to the inside of Zakius. And they sat there to eat. And it doesn't tell us what Jesus said. It doesn't say what the discussion or the dialogue was at the table. But whatever happened there at that meeting, he came in contact with the word for his day. He came in contact with the living word made flesh. And when Zakius contacted that, Kakas all of a SUDDEN REALIZED, I'M NOT WHAT I want to be. This isn't who I am. I'm not going to be this kind of person anymore. And he stands UP AND SAYS, "LORD, AMEN. WHATEVER I'VE DONE, I'M GIVING IT AWAY. I'M CHANGING ALL OF THESE THINGS." AND JESUS SAYS, "BEHOLD, salvation has come to this house for as much as he also is a son of Abraham." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus was not looking at his natural lineage. He wasn't going back through birth records to determine he was a son of Abraham because he already had a dialogue in John chapter 8 with a whole bunch of children of Abraham who he said were not children of Abraham. And he said, "I know you're the children of Abraham, but if you were the children of Abraham, but you're the children of the devil." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HOW WAS HE DETERMINING WHAT THEIR LINEAGE WAS? BY HOW they handled the word for their day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN ZAKIUS RESPONDED TO THE LIVING WORD IN HIS PRESENCE AND STOOD UP AND CONFESSED HIS SINS AND WAS going to make IT RIGHT AND WAS OVERJOYED AT THE PRESENCE OF THE WORD in his home, JESUS SAID, "THIS is the son of Abraham." &gt;&gt; He didn't have to LOOK AT HIS BIRTH RECORD. THIS SAY, "WHO WAS YOUR FATHER?" HE KNEW RIGHT AWAY THIS WAS A SON OF ABRAHAM. AND GUESS WHAT? YOU AND I, AMEN, WE MAY NOT HAVE A DROP OF JEWISH BLOOD IN US, BUT WE ARE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM BY WHAT? BY FAITH. FAITH IN WHAT? THE WORD OF GOD. AND FAITH IN THE WORD OF GOD DECREES OUR LINEAGE. WE CAN GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO ABRAHAM. AND ALL THE PROMISES OF OUR FATHER ABRAHAM BELONG TO US &gt;&gt; BY WHAT? FAITH. By faith. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God, friends. He says, brother says here, if I taught you Methodist message, it would take no effect on you. This is bride time. &gt;&gt; If Moses taught the message of No, it would take no effect. If Jesus taught Moses' message, it would take no effect. &gt;&gt; If Jesus taught Moses' message, &gt;&gt; they were all saying, "We have Moses. We believe Moses. They were reading Moses, declaring Moses, following the law Moses gave. It was all Moses, Moses, Moses. Whenever Jesus was interacting with the with with the Pharisees, but if Jesus taught Moses message, it would have no effect. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; because the predestinated seed are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that's give for that seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It won't grow any other condition. And it must be the condition that grows it. That seed gene of God has always been. It's come in every dispensation in every age programmed for the age it came in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that seed of God will only respond to the word of the dispensation of the word for that age. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what it's programmed for. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we can't go back and preach denominational doctrine anymore. We're beyond the denominations. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is bride time. This what we have now is something different. And there's a message that's been sent out to contact and find the sheep. &gt;&gt; Yep. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND MY SHEEP WILL HEAR MY VOICE. The word. WHAT WORD? AMEN. NOT A DENOMINATIONAL WORD, but the word FOR TODAY, &gt;&gt; WHICH IS CHRIST HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The person of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It won't grow in any other condition. It must be the condition it grows in. Listen, Zakius being an Israelite, being a Jew, no doubt he heard preaching before. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Anybody believe that? &gt;&gt; No doubt he heard preaching before, BUT IT DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM CHEATING his brethren AND BEING A CROOKED tax collector. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. THE WOMAN AT THE WELL DECLARED TO JESUS THAT SHE HAD BEEN TAUGHT, THAT SHE WAS RELIGIOUS, THAT she had been to church BECAUSE SHE SAYS, "LISTEN, I'M CONFUSED ABOUT RELIGION. Our fathers, which are the Samaritan fathers, Amen. Tell us that on this mountain we should worship because Jacob was here and this is the mountain. But the Jews tell us that in in Jerusalem we should worship. Listen, this woman came in contact with a man that began to discern her life and tell her how many husbands she had and who she was living with now. AND THE FIRST QUESTION SHE COULD THINK TO ASK WAS, "WHAT IS the right way to worship God?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, SHE WAS CONFUSED ABOUT SPIRITUAL RELIGIOUS TEACHING. AMEN. She had heard it, but it didn't awaken her. THE TEACHING SHE HAD NEVER gave her OVERCOMING POWER TO OVERCOME THE CYCLE OF OF ADULTERY THAT SHE WAS TRAPPED IN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; SO, SHE HAD RELIGIOUS TEACHING. THEY HAD QUOTED MOSES TO HER. AMEN. BUT SHE INSIDE OF HER WAS A SEED GENE OF GOD THAT WAS PROGRAMMED for a certain manifestation of that word. And the previous manifestation wasn't bringing it to life BECAUSE SHE WAS STILL TRAPPED IN HER ADULTERY. AMEN. UNTIL SHE CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE LIVING WORD. &gt;&gt; WHAT CAME HER WAY? JESUS CHRIST. JESUS CHRIST THE WORD MADE FLESH. THE FULFILLMENT OF THE PROPHECY. WHAT MOSES HAD TAUGHT. WHAT JEREMIAH PROPHESIED. WHAT EZEKIEL SAID WAS COMING. HERE HE WAS STANDING IN THE FLESH. HE COME TO THE WELL to meet what HE'S LOOKING FOR. LOST SHEEP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT A THIEF. HE DOESN'T STEAL SHEEP. THESE ARE HIS SHEEP ALREADY BEFORE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. And the dialogue they have is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; Listen. He says, "Give me some water." She says, "We're not supposed to interact with each other. You're a Jew. I'm a Samaritan." said, "If you knew the gift of God and who it was that saith, you give me water, you would ask me and I'd give you living water that you come and thirst to the one you thirst no more and you draw no more." She said, "Sir, give me of this water." First, she says, first she looks, she says, "But the well is deep and you have nothing to draw with. You don't have a bucket. You don't have any. How are you going to give me water?" He said, "No, no, no, no. The water that I give you &gt;&gt; shall be a well of living water springing up within you." Yeah. &gt;&gt; unto eternal life. And she says, "Give me this water." &gt;&gt; Listen, this is not a normal preaching service. &gt;&gt; He said, "Okay, I'll give you the water when you go get your husband." What does this have to do with anything? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; And she says, "I have no husband." He said, "You've said, right, for you've had five, and the one you're with now is not your own. And she looked at him. Listen, when he told her she was wrong, she did not get offended. &gt;&gt; She did not say, "How dare you? Don't you understand my circumstances? Don't you know I was turned out as a child? I &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What right do you have to bring that out? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Oh man, that's that's a that's that is a a a prick in the thigh of a side of a Leodysian." &gt;&gt; Yeah. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; True. He told her exactly where she was. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And she says, "I perceive you to be a prophet." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She was waiting for a moment like this. &gt;&gt; She was stuck in a religious cycle that was giving her nothing to overcome. She had been to church. She had heard the teachings. She had heard the debates between the Jews and between the Samaritans and understood what the what the conflict was all about. And she couldn't figure out was the Baptist writer, was the Methodist writer, were the Catholics writer, were the Pentecostal, RIGHT? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I've heard it all and I'm confused about it all. And she didn't get it all until she come in contact with somebody would tell her where she's wrong and what her life's like and what's happened to her along the way. And all of a sudden, she said, "You're a prophet. Hey, listen. Our fathers tell us on this mountain we should worship. But the Jew, where shall we worship? &gt;&gt; It was showing there was something down inside of her that wanted to worship God. &gt;&gt; And she come in contact WITH THE ANSWER. HOW DID SHE KNOW HE WAS the answer? She just knew he had the answer. when he showed the sign of the Messiah, the prophetic sign, and and and he goes, "Listen, the father neither this mountain or that mountain, but the father seeketh those that will worship him with spirit and in truth." That's who the father's looking for, someone who will worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; And she says, "When Messiah comes, &gt;&gt; oh yeah, &gt;&gt; this woman's not educated. SHE'S NOT A THEOLOGIAN. HOW IS SHE PUTTING THIS TOGETHER? Because there's something in her that's programmed to meet the word FOR HER DAY. THERE'S SOMETHING IN her that's programmed to meet the living word, THE PROPHECY MADE FLESH, to meet the Messiah in her day and hour. AND WHEN SHE COMES IN CON, IT'S NOT A STRAIN TO BELIEVE. IT'S NOT A STRUGGLE TO BELIEVE. SHE JUST BELIEVES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SHE DOESN'T NEED A THEOLOGIAN. SHE DOESN'T NEED A DOCTORATE DEGREE. SHE JUST BELIEVES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And she he says she says, "Messiah, when he comes, he's going to tell us these things." &gt;&gt; Could you imagine her heart pounding when she says that? &gt;&gt; She knows something's moving in her life. She knows something real. She knows she's in the midst of something real and lifechanging. Amen. And no doubt her heart is about to beat out of her chest when she says, "When Messiah comes, he'll tell us these things." And Jesus says, "I that speaketh unto thee am he." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, put yourself in her place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Put yourself in her. She's going about her daily routine of business. She's going down to get water like she goes and gets water every single day of her life. She's not expecting any supernatural thing to happen. And she comes across a Jewish man sitting on a well. Amen. And starts this dialogue with her. She wasn't expecting one thing to happen that day. She had no plan. She had no preconceived idea. And all of a sudden, she comes in contact with a man and he speaks kind of weird living water in you springing up and she doesn't quite understand all this and get your husband and now but he knows about my life and a prophet and a messiah and now this man with dust ON HIS FEET, DUST on the bottom of his garment, with a beard maybe with sweat running down the sides of his face and he says, "I'm the Messiah." &gt;&gt; RIGHT? HOW ON EARTH COULD A WOMAN ACCEPT THAT AFTER A 15MINUTE CONVERSATION? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE WAS PROGRAMMED TO BELIEVE IT. SOMETHING INSIDE OF HER, AMEN, WAS DESIGNATED A SEED GENE OF GOD THAT WHEN IT WOULD COME IN CONTACT WITH THE LIVING WORD FOR HER DAY, THERE WOULD BE A MAGNETIC DRAW THAT WOULD NOT BE INTELLECTUAL. IT WOULD BE BEYOND THE MIND. IT WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO THE BRAIN. BUT THERE'S A CONNECTION THAT GOES OFF INSIDE OF HER. AMEN. SHE JUST STEPS BACK AND SHE LOOKS FOR A MINUTE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ABSORBING IT ALL, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; AND THEN ALL THE OTHER DISCIPLES COME UP AND THEY'RE WONDERING WHY he's talking to her and they've got misgivings about the whole conversation. And all of a sudden it says she left her water pot. &gt;&gt; She didn't need anymore &gt;&gt; because now she became the well of living water. &gt;&gt; Amen. that seed had come to life. And now she went down into the city and what she was doing, she was spurting out water and you will be a well of living water. Amen. Rushing out into everlasting life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She said, "Come see a man that told me everything I ever did." Is not this the very Messiah. &gt;&gt; No theologian, no degree, no preacher in a pullpit. &gt;&gt; He was looking for his lost sheep. Amen. &gt;&gt; The lost sheep hear his voice and they recognize their father calling. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; We got to leave our brains checked out. Sometimes &gt;&gt; we come up with our whole life and a million reasons why. We look around and we see trouble in every hand. Listen, forget about all of that, friends. &gt;&gt; What voice are you hearing? &gt;&gt; And what is it doing inside of you? In John chapter 17 says, I have manifest thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world. Thine they were. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word. Wow. &gt;&gt; Thine they were. &gt;&gt; So these men already belong to the father. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; They were his sheep. &gt;&gt; And he gave them to the son. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Luke 15. Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him. And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, "This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them." And he spake this parable unto them, saying, "What man of you having a hund sheep? If he lose one of them, does not leave the 90 and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it. When he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I have found, I have found my sheep which was lost. &gt;&gt; He didn't lose one of his hund sheep, leave the 99, and go find another sheep. &gt;&gt; He doesn't need a hundred sheep. He needs his sheep. &gt;&gt; He's not looking for a quota. He's not looking for a number. HE'S NOT TRYING to keep the seats full in a church. It doesn't matter the number. The number's not important. He's looking for his sheep. &gt;&gt; They had to have been his before. They had to have been longed TO THE FATHER ALL ALONG. They had to have been given to him by the father. They were his sheep. And he was looking for his sheep. And he was willing to leave the 99 to find THAT WHICH WAS LOST. AND CALLETH ALLTO TOGETHER REJOICE BECAUSE MY SHEEP WHICH WAS LOST IS NOW FOUND. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'VE BEEN FOUND, IT MEANS YOU WERE ALWAYS HIS SHEEP. &gt;&gt; YOU always belong to him. You were always designated to belong to this shepherd. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD. LISTEN, STOP LOOKING AT YOURSELF AND START LOOKING AT THE WORD. LET THE WORD IDENTIFY who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 15:16. You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain. He's telling me these disciples, they thought they decided to follow Jesus. And listen, you didn't pick me. I picked you and I've already ordained you that you're going to go and bring forth fruit. &gt;&gt; That means they had guaranteed fruit coming. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, that would BE SUCH AN EXCITING THING TO HEAR. HOW WOULD YOU LOVE IT if Jesus would come and tell you, "I've ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your FRUIT SHOULD REMAIN." OH, PRAISE GOD. THAT MEANS MY EFFORTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN VAIN. BEFORE I START, I KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO COME FRUIT from this ministry and that the fruit will remain until the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T THEM, it was him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians 1 tells us, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; Listen, God's already decided. &gt;&gt; He already knows you. He's already decided you're his. &gt;&gt; That's why he chose you in Christ before the foundation of the world that you might be holy. Amen. And without blame before him in love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's predestinated us unto adoption, unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ. Amen. according to the good pleasure of his will. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful it was his will &gt;&gt; because his will won't change. &gt;&gt; Future home brother says here is your holy convocation not having anything to do with literal things. It's beyond that. It's in the kingdom of God with eternal life with the predestinated that never did start. It never started on any day. You wasn't saved on any day. You was always saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus just come to redeem that. But you was saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with. &gt;&gt; I love when the prophet does things like this. Amen. We always SAY, "I GOT SAVED IN 19 so and so and this and that." Listen, that's the day you realized you were saved. That's when the scales fell off of your eyes and you recognized it came in contact with the living God. And that living God, amen, brought you to himself and awakened a seed inside of you. That may have been the day you were saved, but in the mind of God, you were always saved because your name was written in the Lamb's book of life from before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO, YOU DON'T GET SAVED ON ONE DAY. YOU COME TO THE realization and awakening that you are saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, the veil has been taken off of this Bible. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; By the opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the ministry of a prophet in the end time. Listen, this book, it can be so many things. Brother Brenham said, "This book is a book of history." It is. &gt;&gt; This book is a It's a book of instructions. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; It It's a book of history. Yes. Instruction. Yes. Uh [laughter] uh uh all kinds of stuff. &gt;&gt; But when THE VEIL CAME OFF, LISTEN, this this to me is not of a book of instruction, although it has instructions. To me, it's not a book of commandments, although commandments are included. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For me, it's not a book of histories, although it contains history. &gt;&gt; But when the seals open, this became a book of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not rules, not regulations, not codes of conduct. All of those things are included in there. But that's not why God gave us a Bible. He gave us a Bible so that you would know where we came from. What God's original purpose was for his family, how it fell into ruin in the Garden of Eden and what he's been doing ever since to bring it back to redemption and what he's going to do in the future to bring it back to right where it came from. Amen. This book starts with his family in the Garden of Eden and perfection. And this book ends with his family restored back to the GARDEN OF EDEN IN PERFECTION. THAT'S WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT. &gt;&gt; IF YOU USE it for anything else, YOU'VE MISUNDERSTOOD THE BOOK. THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID AT THE OPENING OF THE SEVEN SEALS, my Bible became a new book. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SHOULD I NOT USE IT FOR INSTRUCTIONS? YES, USE IT FOR INSTRUCTIONS, BUT DON'T LEAVE IT IN INSTRUCTIONS. SHOULD I USE IT FOR COMMANDMENT? DON'T LEAVE. YES, USE IT FOR COMMANDMENT, but don't leave it in commandment. IF YOU DON'T SEE THE LOVE LETTER written to you, if you DON'T SEE THE GREAT MYSTERY PLAN OF GOD TO HAVE A FAMILY HIMSELF MANIFEST IN THE FLESH AS A FAMILY ON THE EARTH IN FELLOWSHIP WITH ONE ANOTHER, GO BACK AND READ IT AGAIN CUZ THAT'S WHAT THIS WHOLE BIBLE IS ABOUT. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING IN IT HAS TO DO WITH THAT PURPOSE OF GOD. HOW IT STARTED, HOW IT FELL, AND WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING FOR 6,000 YEARS, trying to BRING IT RIGHT BACK to his original thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why this Bible became a new book. &gt;&gt; That's why, listen, this message, this message is not denominational teaching plus the correction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This message isn't correct doctrine, although it contains correct doctrine. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE GOD GAVE US IS NOT COMMANDMENTS, although it contains commandments. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some people look at the Bible and they see rules and restrictions and dos and don'ts. &gt;&gt; Well, that's because the veil's not been taken off yet, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And some people look at the message the exact same way. &gt;&gt; They look at the message and say, "Well, I was taught, Brother Bam, said I'm not allowed to do this, and this is the rules for marriage and divorce, and this is the rules for all of that. Listen, if that's the farthest you've gotten the message, I pray that God would take the scales off of your eyes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the message of the hour came to open this book so you would understand what was the intent and purpose of God all along. &gt;&gt; It came to bring us the mystery that was in the back part of God's mind. The mystery of God, what he was wanting to achieve all along. And every character in the Bible and every type in the Bible has been declaring what this mystery is. And this mystery is God wanted to become flesh as a family, his children, his seed IN FLESH UPON THE EARTH AND FELLOWSHIP with one another. [clears throat and cough] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. People use the Bible and they use the message for all kinds of things, but that's not what it was sent for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was sent so you and I could have the scales removed from our eyes &gt;&gt; and so that we would know who he is and who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Listen, in seeing who we are begins to remove the struggle in our lives. So much of what we struggle with is an identity crisis. &gt;&gt; If we could just get the right identity, a lot of the crisis would go away. &gt;&gt; That's what this message to me, that's what this message is sent for, friends. It's not for debate. I'm not interested in debating the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; The message is my Isaf &gt;&gt; that opened my eyes. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in debating doctrine. I'm not interested in debating all of that. Listen, the message has lifted us so much higher than doctrinal debates. It's lifted us into a love relationship, a connection and union with Jesus Christ. Amen. Through the revealed word of the hour, it's wakened me to who I actually am. It's removed all the confusion. I've heard FROM MY FATHER. AMEN. I've realized that I'm a sheep. I'VE COME BACK TO MY SHEPHERD. AMEN. WHAT DO I WANT TO ARGUE ABOUT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOTHING. I'M IN LOVE. I'M HAPPY. I'M FREE. I'VE GOT EVERYTHING I COULD EVER WANT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, this Bible is a book of redemption. &gt;&gt; And brother Benham calls it the book of life. &gt;&gt; Why has it become death to so many people? Because the letter kleth, but the spirit bringeth life. &gt;&gt; They caught the letter, but they missed the spirit. &gt;&gt; And that's what God brought us in the end time. He brought us back to the spirit of this Bible. &gt;&gt; What it's all really about. He's given us eagle vision so we can fly high and not see commandments and not see histories and not see all of this. But when you fly back and you look at it, you say, "This is a family album." Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; This is a family album &gt;&gt; of God's family &gt;&gt; and how his family how he was going to bring forth his family and what happened and they came wrong and now all the troubles the family fell into and what he's been doing to restore the family and how he's going to bring the family back to his original purpose. This is a family album. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a glorious thing. But you know what's more glorious than realizing this is a family album? When you flip the page and you say, "There's me. I'M IN THE FAMILY ALBUM. I'M IN THE BOOK OF LIFE. I'M INCLUDED IN THIS STORY." &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THIS COULD NEVER BE A BOOK OF DEATH TO ME. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THERE'S COMMANDMENTS. THERE'S COMMANDMENTS. I FALL SHORT OF THEM. I REGRET AND I AM SORRY WHEN I FAIL. BUT THIS BOOK CAN NEVER KILL ME BECAUSE I WAS WITH HIM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. IT'S ALL WRITTEN FOR MY BENEFIT. IT'S WRITTEN BECAUSE OF LOVE. IT'S WRITTEN TO TELL ME WHO I AM. THIS IS NOT WRITTEN TO CONDEMN ME. EVEN THE INSTRUCTIONS AND THE COMMANDMENTS ARE IN THERE FOR MY BENEFIT, NOT FOR MY HARM. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT THERE TO CUT ME OUT OF THE PROGRAM OF GOD. THEY'RE THERE TO BRING ME INTO THE PROGRAM of God. &gt;&gt; Two people CAN READ THE SAME BOOK AND COME TO TWO different conclusions. &gt;&gt; Listen, brother Bam said this is a love letter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [clears throat] And he said, "When my wife wife writes me a love letter," Amen. I'm reading between the lines what's in the love letter, I'm catching more than anybody else who reads that letter. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT PICK UP BROTHER Brenham's love letter. And when Brother Brennham reads that love letter, his heart every once in a while skips a beat cuz he knows what his wife's saying. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And she says, "Listen, the kids are all in bed, the house is quiet, and I'm thinking of you." And he's going, "Oh my goodness, I wish I was there to hold her hand. She's wanting me to sit by her, talk to her. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody else reads the same letter and been like, "My goodness, that was the most boring thing I ever read. The kids are in bed. She's just sitting there &gt;&gt; doing nothing." &gt;&gt; IT DEPENDS ON WHO WROTE THE LETTER AND who received the letter. IF YOUR FATHER WROTE THE LETTER AND YOU'RE HIS SON, IF YOUR BRIDEGROOM WROTE THE LETTER AND YOU'RE THE BRIDE, WHAT YOU READ IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than anybody else picks IT UP AND DOESN'T KNOW WHO WROTE IT AND WHO'S IT FOR. &gt;&gt; GOD, give us a revelation of who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the book of Acts, Acts 13, it says, "But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul and contradicting and blaspheing." Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said, "It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you. But seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord. And as many as were ordained to eternal life, believed &gt;&gt; you got this. Now he's coming and preaching to a mixed multitude, Jews and Gentiles. He's moving out from Antioch by the bidding of the spirit to go on their first missionary journey. And Paul and Barnabas are preaching. And at first everybody's hearing them, the Jews and the Gentiles, they ask him to come back and speak again. But then the Jews begin to stir up trouble and they begin to contradict and blasphe. And when they stood against the word of God, &gt;&gt; Paul knew, Paul knew that they had no desire for eternal life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then he said, then the Bible says, "And the Gentiles heard them. They were glad and they glorified the word of the Lord. It says, "As many as believed were ordained into eternal life." &gt;&gt; Oh, no. It didn't say that. &gt;&gt; As many as believed what Paul said, then became then received eternal life. &gt;&gt; No, it doesn't say that. Am I reading it wrong? AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT CAME FIRST? &gt;&gt; God's plan, &gt;&gt; God's ordination, predestination, election, it came first. &gt;&gt; As many as were ordained to eternal life believed. &gt;&gt; Why did they believe? They had something in them to believe with. They had a predestinated elect seed of God laying inside OF THEM THAT WAS PROGRAMMED TO HEAR PAUL. &gt;&gt; Many heard, few believed. Why did they believe? And why did THE JEWS WALK AWAY? BECAUSE SOMETHING in them could receive what was being preached. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bon says they deny his word, deny his baptism, deny his power, deny his signs, and with a creed or tradition again of wearing turned around collars and everything, making themselves creeds and so forth. They're trying to upon good works. They wasn't ordained to life to begin with. They had nothing to believe with. &gt;&gt; Right? That's what happened to the Pharisees. They had nothing to believe with. But the woman at the well did. The woman who came and broke the alabaster box and washed his feet. She had something to believe with. Amen. But Simon that lived in his house didn't have anything to believe with. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Romans 10:17. So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we got that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if I want somebody to have faith, I'll just give them the word of God. And if they hear the word of God, guaranteed they'll have faith. &gt;&gt; Except Jesus said, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Listen, we can preach the pure word of God. True. Absolutely true. &gt;&gt; But if nobody has ears to hear, they won't hear it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. So faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. Zakius believed when he heard the word of God and came in contact with the word. The woman at the well believed when she came in contact with the word. Amen. They believed when they come in contact with the word for their day. But there's others that heard what they heard but didn't believe. &gt;&gt; He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. Listen, this was repeated by Jesus Christ eight times in the gospel. Eight times. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. Who was the message for? Those that had ears to hear? &gt;&gt; So what came first? The message that was preached or the ears to hear with? [laughter] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't have been preached unless there was ears to hear. And those ears were predestinated ears. Amen. programmed by God to hear and they weren't these EARS BECAUSE EVERYBODY that was in attendance that day, we can assume statistically could hear. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; THEY HEARD WHAT HE SAID, BUT THEY DIDN'T HEAR WHAT HE SAID. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because they didn't have the internal ears to hear &gt;&gt; what he said. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; He goes on, he says, "Jesus said unto them, if God were your father, you would love me. For I proceeded forth and came from God. Neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do you not understand my speech, even because you cannot hear my word? &gt;&gt; Ye are of your father, the devil, and the lust of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speak of the lie, he speaketh of his own. For he is a liar and the father of it. And because I tell you the truth, you believe me not. THIS IS HOW JESUS KNEW EXACTLY who their father was. Because I tell you the truth, YOU BELIEVE ME NOT. YOUR FATHER Abraham didn't do this. You're not Abraham. See, Abraham's seed believe the truth when they hear the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he says, I I want to go back to the beginning. Why do you not understand my speech? Was he not speaking the right language? &gt;&gt; Did he have a speech impediment? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Did he slur his words? He said, "Why don't you understand my speech?" This wasn't the ability of these ears to hear. &gt;&gt; They were hearing clearly what he was saying, but they didn't understand what he was saying. And they didn't believe what he was saying. And they sought to kill him. Amen. Proving that they were of their father, the devil. &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm telling you friends, Jesus never did anything to persuade anyone to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He never twisted anybody's arm. He never said pretty please. He never asked them to please sit come and listen again. He when the rich young ruler asked him what must I do in inherit eternal life. He said well do what the commandments say. And and and this young ruler said I have done all of these. He said one thing you're lacking. And before he told him he said BEHOLDING HIM. HE LOVED HIM. Jesus wasn't angry with him. Jesus loved him. He was going to set him free from his own vices. He was going to give him the opportunity. Amen. AND HE SAYS SELL ALL THAT YOU HAVE AND GIVE TO THE POOR AND THOU SHALT INHERIT ETERNAL LIFE. AND HE says he went away grieved because he had much riches. &gt;&gt; Jesus never said, "NO, NO, STOP. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. LET ME EXPLAIN it again." Jesus never explained it again. looking for sheep. He was looking for his sheep. &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm afraid too many times that we try to use our personalities and persuasion &gt;&gt; and performance and and all kinds of other things to attract people. &gt;&gt; Listen, and there's nothing wrong with having a nice personality. There's nothing wrong with being friendly with people. There's nothing wrong with spending time with people. But none of that will ever hold. And none of that was ever used to find the children of God. God always used the same measure to locate his children all down through time. And he always did it by his revealed word for the hour and the hour in the dispensation of time that that word was come forth. There would be a seed there to meet that word and a word to meet that seed. And when those two connected, there would be something that would come forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have to worry about this message. This message will find the children of God. &gt;&gt; This message is right. This message is true. And listen, God never called me to correct the prophet, to smooth out his rough edges, to make him sound nicer, and apologize for what HE SAID. &gt;&gt; GOD PICKED THE vessel he wanted to carry the message. So the way the message came is the way God wanted it to come. &gt;&gt; And if it came right straight and it came true AND IT CAME ROUGH, THAT'S THE WAY GOD DESIGNED THE man and that's the man God chose. And it didn't come with eloquence of speech and it didn't come with high flattering words. It came from a man with a seventh grade education out of Kentucky who couldn't pronounce the big words in the Bible, BUT HE WOULD JUST SAY IT STRAIGHT AND he would use all kinds of examples and he would just tell THE TRUTH. AND THAT'S GOD'S DESIGN. AND I'M not here TO SAY, "GOD MADE A MISTAKE. LET ME SMOOTH IT OVER for you and make it nicer because the tapes are hard to listen to." Listen, you should listen TO THE TAPES. THAT'S THE VOICE OF GOD ON THOSE TAPES. AND EVERYTHING I TRY TO DO HERE IS JUST SAY BACK TO YOU WHAT I HEARD ON THOSE TAPES. &gt;&gt; WHAT I READ IN THE BOOK, AMEN, THAT GOD WILL ANOINT ME FOR A SPECIFIC TIME AND PLACE TO SPEAK BACK TO YOU SOMETHING SPECIFIC FOR YOUR LIFE. BUT I AM NOT HERE TO CHANGE WHAT'S ON THE TABLE. I AM NOT HERE TO SMOOTH IT OUT AND POLISH IT UP AND MAKE IT NICER AND MORE DIGESTIBLE. GOD BROUGHT IT IN A WAY THAT THE CHILDREN OF GOD COULD DIGEST IT. AND IF YOU CAN'T DIGEST WHAT'S ON THE TAPE, I WOULD PRAY TO GOD, GOD, WHY IS THIS MESSAGE GIVING ME INDIGESTION? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S GOD'S METHOD OF DELIVERY. &gt;&gt; God knew how to find his sheep. &gt;&gt; Our job is not to soften it &gt;&gt; so it's easier. My job is just here to proclaim it. The way he's called me and anointed me to proclaim it. It'll be unique. Absolutely. It's unique to me. God's just using me with my temperament to proclaim the word. But I'm not here to change it, friends. &gt;&gt; God forbid that we should ever change it. &gt;&gt; God did a good job. &gt;&gt; He picked the right man for the job. &gt;&gt; You never hear from me. Don't listen to that. You won't understand. Just listen to me. If you ever hear me say that, you run away. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; Because the bride of Jesus Christ can take that voice and they love it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The voice of the sign. This is always God's way of making his voice known to his people. He sends his prophet and gives a sign and then takes his voice that's been spoken before on his word and vindicates it by this man. And they know that it's his voice because it's the promised word of the day. Oh, if people would only see that, if they could only stop just a moment and realize that. You see, there is no way to make them believe it. There's no way a man God himself can't do it. Can't do what? Make them believe it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's let's just stop for a minute. &gt;&gt; There's no way to make them believe it. God himself can't do it. Is that what you just read? Did you read what I read? &gt;&gt; GOD HIMSELF CAN'T MAKE the unbeliever believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God himself can't make the people believe it. They got to believe it. And if there's nothing there to believe with, how can they believe? SEE, NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; In Luke 16, he says, "Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou would ascend him to my father's house." Who's this? The rich young RULER WHO FILLED HIS BARNS, who walked away from Jesus, filled his barn to the fool and said, "Soul, take thy rest." And that day, that fool found his soul in hell. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he's LOOKING UP AND HE'S CRYING TO FATHER ABRAHAM TO help his to help him. And Father Abram said, "I can't help you." Then he says, "Help my brothers." And listen to the answer. He said that I He said, "I PRAY THEE, FATHER, THAT THOU WOULD send him." Who's that? Lazarus the bum that he wouldn't take care of. Send him to my father's house. For I have five brethren that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. And Abraham saith unto them, they have Moses and the prophets. Let them hear them. What's he saying? They have the word. Let them believe the word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Nay, Father Abraham, but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent." And he said unto him, "If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead." &gt;&gt; A MIRACLE, A SIGN, A WONDER IS NOT WHAT'S REQUIRED TO BELIEVE. The believer will believe the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, when brother Bannon WAS SENT WITH THREE POOLS, it wasn't the FIRST PULL OR THE SECOND PULL THAT CAUGHT THE RAINBOW TROUT. THE first pull AND THE SECOND POOL CAUGHT their attention. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT CAUGHT THE FISH WAS THE OPENING OF THE WORD. IT WAS THE WORD THAT CAUGHT THE RAINBOW TROUT, NOT THE FIRST AND SECOND POOL. IT WASN'T THE MIRACLES THAT CAUGHT THEM BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE WERE DOING MIRACLES. AMEN. THE MIRACLES CAUGHT THEIR ATTENTION. THEY SAW A MESSIANIC SIGN. THEY SAW BIBLICAL SIGNS. THEY SAW THIS WAS ALL WHAT JESUS DID. AND WHEN the when the seed come close, when the RAINBOW TROUT CAME NEAR, AMEN. THAT THAT SECOND PULL WAS SUPPOSED TO SCATTER ALL THE FISH AWAY. BUT WHAT IT DID WAS CAUGHT A LITTLE BITTY ONE. BUT THE ONE THAT WAS SUPPOSED to catch him, to really hook them, to bring them in, was the third pull, the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you ask me, what do I want to emphasize? Third &gt;&gt; pull. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The opening of the word. Amen. That's what will catch the rainbow trout. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean they're still not healing AND THEY'RE STILL NOT GIFTS. ALL OF THOSE ARE STILL OPERATING WITHIN the church. Amen. God uses those in appointed time and seasons. THEY STILL SHOW THE POWER AND MIGHT OF GOD. AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD STILL FALLS ON PEOPLE TO DO ALL KINDS OF SIGNS and wonders and miracles ALL OVER THE PLACE. ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE IN THE MISSION FIELD bringing the word for the first time. God vindicates his word over and over and over again. BUT THAT WON'T HOOK THE RAINBOW TROUT. THAT WILL GATHER THEIR ATTENTION. BUT THE hook is the word. &gt;&gt; That third pull, when they set the hook, it brings the fish home. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John 6, "But there are some of you that believe not." For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. Who's he talking to? his group of followers, &gt;&gt; his disciples, the one that gathered around him and told him he's great and we're following you and we're off preaching two by two in all these cities and villages and they come back to him. He says, "But there are some of you that believe not." Their close proximity to Jesus Christ could not make them believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that astounding to you? That's astounding to me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Eating with him, hearing him talk in the house, hearing him explain parables, walking with him, riding in a boat with him, seeing all of his miracles, &gt;&gt; could not make them believers. &gt;&gt; We always think if somebody would just see something, if they would just come, if they would just, &gt;&gt; that doesn't necessarily mean that they'll be a believer. [clears throat] If they can receive the word for their day, they'll be a believer. &gt;&gt; He says this later, Jesus answered them, "Have not I chosen you 12? And one of you is a devil." Judas being a close friend of Jesus could not change Judas. &gt;&gt; Amen. Judas being taken in confidence to be the treasurer and hold the money bag and be sent out on special missions. Judas going out into the villages and casting out devils and healing the sick. &gt;&gt; Did Judas cast out devils? &gt;&gt; Did he heal the sick? &gt;&gt; Did Jesus give him the money back? &gt;&gt; Was he trusted above his brethren? &gt;&gt; Was any close fellowship with Jesus? Absolutely. At the supper table when Jesus over and whispered to him, "What thou doest do quickly?" They assumed that Judas had just been sent on another errand. So that must have been common business. Jesus would have a private conversation with Judas and Judas take off because he had the money back. &gt;&gt; That's what they assumed in the last supper. So his close proximity, his office in the church, his his his riding in the boat with Jesus, his sleeping next to him, him spending night and day next to HIM COULD NOT CHANGE WHAT JUDAS WAS. CUZ YOU CAN'T CHANGE a goat into a sheep. YOU CAN'T CHANGE A COCKER TO A WHEAT. WHATEVER it is from the mind of God is what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "Not even God can make them believe." Not even Jesus, not even God in flesh, &gt;&gt; preaching the pure word 2,000 years ago standing there, God perfectly embodied in a body of flesh, not fallen, perfect flesh, preaching the pure unadulterated word. Even he himself in his own body, preaching with his own vocal cords that he created, could not make them believers. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, do we think that we can do it better? &gt;&gt; IF I JUST PREACH IT DIFFERENTLY, IF I JUST DO THIS OR IF I JUST DO THAT or if we add a program or if we just change this or change that, we'll make them believers. NONE OF THAT IS going to work. Believers are going to believe the word of God because they have a seed gene of God. And if THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH THE true word that matches the gen genetics on the inside, the genetics of this word and the genetics OF THIS WORD WILL COME TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; So God, HELP US TO PREACH THE WORD. &gt;&gt; Help us with all OF OUR MIGHT TO PREACH THE truth of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A God who is rich in mercy. I'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine, but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare. You don't know who you are. You are not going to be. But now you are sons of God. See, you always were the sons of God. For when God had you in his thinking at the beginning, you have to be some part of you. Your life that's in you now had to be with God before there. Well, when he before he even became material here on earth, before there was anything but God, you were one of his attributes. He knowed what your name would be. He knowed the color of hair you would have. He knowed all about you. The only thing happened is when you being a sinner, many of you can fellowship with me on this thought. When you was a little boy or little girl, you would walk around and there would be certain things that would just where it wouldn't bother the other kids. It seemed like there was something in you that cried out. There was a God somewhere, yet you were a sinner. You remember that? Certainly. Now, what was that? That was that little form of life in you then. [clears throat] When was it in you? When you were a little boy and girl. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then after a while you heard the gospel. Maybe you went to church. You picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination. But one day you being part of God, you had to be part of the word. And when you heard the word, you know where you come from. You know that was the truth. You were always the seed was in you always. The word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you come to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I love this. Let's look at this. Let's look at this. The word seen the word. That was bad. &gt;&gt; I did not mean to cross it out. Let's look at this. The word seen the word that was in you. &gt;&gt; That mean the word was already in you. &gt;&gt; The word that came to you seen the word that was in you. &gt;&gt; I believe Jesus Christ, the word, saw the word that was in the woman at the well. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe he saw the word that was in Zakius. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, before the foundation world, listen, saw the word and you came to it. &gt;&gt; So the word seen the word that was in you and the word that was in you seen the word and you guys moved to one another. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; the word saw the word in you. The word in you saw the word. They were magnetized to each other. Friends, &gt;&gt; this gives me such confidence. Amen. When I go out and witness or share the word or or SHARE WITH SOMEBODY, LISTEN, I'M NOT THERE to convince anybody. I'm not there TO TWIST ANYBODY'S ARM. I'M NOT THERE TO MAKE ANYBODY a believer. They're either one of his sheep or they're not one of his sheep. I'm just there to bring the voice of the Messiah. I'm just there to bring the word for the age and bring some little nugget that will trigger something on inside. And I guarantee IF SOMETHING YOU SAID PRICKS SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE, THEY KNOW WHERE TO COME BACK for more. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DUMP THE WHOLE LOAD AT ONCE. FRIENDS, ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS GIVE A PORTION of the word for this day. Amen. Whatever doors open to you when you DROP THAT SEED IN. If there's fertile soil there AND IT AND IT STICKS, THEY'LL NEVER FORGET IT. EVEN IF they wait years, THEY'LL COME BACK. THEY KNOW THE SOURCE OF where they felt that, where they heard THAT, AND THEY'LL COME BACK TO IT. FRIENDS, &gt;&gt; AMEN. Rest assured, we don't use persuasion techniques. This is why brother Brenham said, "I'm against altar calls." HE WASN'T AGAINST ALTAR CALLS. LISTEN, HE had altar calls all the way up till the end of his ministry. It wasn't just coming to the altar and praying. He was against. He said, "I'm against that Methodist FORM OF PUTTING PRESSURE on people saying, "Now listen, Charlie, you know, your mom prayed for you and she died years ago. She's in heaven praying for you NOW BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A TRUE CONVERSION." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT DOESN'T BRING THE RIGHT RESULTS. PUTTING PRESSURE ON PEOPLE, PUTTING FEAR ON PEOPLE, DOING A COUNTDOWN. GET TO THIS ALTAR BY THE 10. BY THE COUNT OF 10, 10, NINE. IF YOU DON'T, THIS COULD BE YOUR LAST TIME. YOU MAY BE DEAD BEFORE THE MORNING. LISTEN, THAT'S WHAT BROTHER BRANDON WAS AGAINST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HOW ANYBODY IN THE BIBLE was converted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where were they converted? When they heard the word, they were pricricked in their heart. &gt;&gt; And they said, "MEN AND BRETHREN, WHAT SHOULD WE DO? YEAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE WORD THAT GRIPPED HIM. IT WAS THE WORD THAT PRICRICKED HIM. AND WHAT WORD WAS IT PETER WAS PREACHING? PETER WAS TAKING THE OLD TESTAMENT PROPHECIES AND SAYING, "THAT DAY IS THIS DAY. &gt;&gt; WHAT JOEL WROTE IS HAPPENING BEFORE YOUR EYES. YOU'RE WITNESSING THE PROPHECIES BEING FULFILLED." AND THERE WAS THOUSANDS OF MEN THAT DAY. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY WERE PRICRICKED IN THEIR HEART AS PETER PREACHED. &gt;&gt; He didn't have an altar call. HE DIDN'T HAVE A PROGRAM. HE DIDN'T have an emotional pull. HE DIDN'T TELL THEM THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE. YOU GOT TELL YOU GOT FIVE MORE MINUTES. FIVE MORE MINUTES &gt;&gt; and the altar's closed. &gt;&gt; No, they preached the word. &gt;&gt; And the word did the work. &gt;&gt; He sent his word and healed their disease. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is our disease? Hybridization. &gt;&gt; What is our disease? Spiritual amnesia. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how we were born. We were born in hybridization with spiritual amnesia. And how did he heal our disease? He sent his word &gt;&gt; and healed our disease. &gt;&gt; So listen friends, I'm not against alter calls. Brother Brennham wasn't against alter calls. He said I'm against alter calls. And he had an alter call. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother says in spiritual amnesia, in amnesia you don't know who you are. Listen, this is the biggest problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why we were living in sin. This is why we were failing. This is why we were falling apart. &gt;&gt; We come into this life spiritual amnesia, blind, our minds alienated, darkened to the things of God, becoming an immity towards God, hating the things of God by an old nature. And we were in spiritual amnesia. We didn't know who we were. When you have amnesia, you don't know who you are. and you can't identify yourself. He says, "You can walk around, eat, and everything, but you still you can't identify yourself. You've got your scholarly education, some same education you had, but you don't know where it come from. You don't know who you are, where you belong. That's amnesia, so we're told." He goes on and says, "You said, I don't believe that God promised to do these things in this last days. Then you've listened to a creed or some doctrine instead of the Bible. You have spiritual amnesia. You don't know where you do belong. Then you're confessing a Christian and denying the word. &gt;&gt; Brings you right back to spiritual amnesia again. See, don't know where you stand. You got spiritual amnesia. You can't identify yourself with the scriptures. &gt;&gt; What I was I was ministering this to the youth the last youth meeting on spiritual amnesia. You can't identify yourself with the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Listen, it's not I can identify myself with a church. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can identify myself with a pastor. No, I can identify myself with a m ministry. No, I can't identify myself with the word of God. I can't find out who I [clears throat] am by the word. This is the mind of God. This is the family album. This is where I find my identification. Amen. I took the kids and I I took them to Malachi 4 and repeated what brother Gabe did a few weeks ago when he says, you look at Malachi 4 and says, "Behold, I that's God send you." &gt;&gt; That's the mystery. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet. And we believe we know who that is. &gt;&gt; William Brandham. So those who receive the prophet &gt;&gt; and receive his mis ministry, who are they? &gt;&gt; I'll go through it again. &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this scripture identifies three people. &gt;&gt; That identifies God. It identifies Elijah the prophet. And it identifies a people who Elijah the prophet was sent to. &gt;&gt; So if you've received the ministry of Elijah the prophet, &gt;&gt; who are you? &gt;&gt; Did you just identify yourself scripturally? &gt;&gt; You just identified yourself scripturally. You didn't look in your mirror. You didn't look at your past. You didn't look who your parents were. You didn't consider what you done right yesterday or wrong yesterday. You found your identification in the prophecy for this day. I'M PART OF THE PROPHECY. BEHOLD, I SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET. I'VE RECEIVED that Elijah the prophet. SO, HE SENT ME. I'M IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I'M PART OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I FOUND MY IDENTIFICATION IN THE MIRROR OF GOD'S WORD. &gt;&gt; What about where the carcass is, the eagles will be gathered. What carcass? Brother Bram said, the fresh kill of the word where the word is fresh for your day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The fresh mana that fell. Not the old carryover from a previous age. Not what had been killed the day before on the road, but the fresh kill of the word, which is what? The message of the hour. And the fresh kill of the word is where the eagles are gathered. The question is, is this message the fresh kill of the word? &gt;&gt; ARE YOU ATTRACTED to it? &gt;&gt; Are you feeding on it? &gt;&gt; Do you like it? YEAH. &gt;&gt; THEN WHAT'S YOUR IDENTIFICATION? ARE YOU AN EAGLE &gt;&gt; BASED OFF WHAT? THE WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF. NO. BASED OFF THE WORD OF GOD. I'M AN EAGLE. I FOUND MY IDENTIFICATION IN THE WORD TO BREAK MY AMNESIA. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BUT I CAN'T CALL MYSELF AN EAGLE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID YESTERDAY." LISTEN, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DID YESTERDAY. I'M LOOKING AT THE PROMISE FOR THIS HOUR. AND THERE'S GOT TO BE A PEOPLE WHO CAN IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH THE WORD OF GOD AND STOP RELYING ON FEELINGS AND STOP GOING UP AND DOWN EVERY FIVE MINUTES BUT COME BACK TO THE BASIS OF FAITH IN THE WORD AND FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE BY THE WRITTEN WORD. &gt;&gt; THIS DOESN'T CHANGE YOUR EMOTIONS CHANGE. THIS DOESN'T CHANGE YOUR YOUR IDEAS CHANGE. YOUR EMOTIONS CHANGE. YOUR RESOLVE TO DO GOOD CHANGES. &gt;&gt; But this word can't change. We have to find our identification in the word. Amen. Who am I? I'm an eagle. &gt;&gt; Who am I? I'm one of those that God sent Elijah the prophet to. &gt;&gt; I'm part of the end time sequence. I'm part of the program. I'm part of the prophecy. That prophecy wasn't just to identify William Brandham. That prophecy also identified me. &gt;&gt; It's who I am. Praise God. Brother Benham says again, spiritual amnesia. You that wants the Holy Spirit, you that wants that experience, not an emotional excitement. You want the Holy Ghost, the life, the germ of life inside you. And you want to get rid of that amnesia that's making you can't identify yourself. You don't know where you stand. You don't know what you are. Let's get rid of it right now. There's a new birth here for you. to a real genuine new birth. &gt;&gt; Born of incorruptible seed by the word of God. Let the spirit come and quicken that word to life. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam tells this story and I love the story. We all talk about the eagle story, but we don't often talk about the duck story. It's what brother Benham said. And God who is rich in mercy said, "I heard a similar little story. I hope it don't sound sacriiggious about a little duck being born under a hen one time. He couldn't understand a funnyl looking little fellow, odd guy, and he couldn't understand the dust and everything. They were playing in the barnyard. But one day, the old hen led the little brood out beyond the behind the barn and he got a smell of water. &gt;&gt; Well, he took out towards that water as hard as he could go. Why? He had never been on a pond before. He had never been in the water, but he was a duck to begin with. &gt;&gt; Only thing he had to do was come to himself. That's the same thing the believer is. There is something in him that when he meets God face to face, he comes to himself. That seed is in him and it's quickened. My, that's right. And he flies away from the things of the world, they become dead to him. My I remember uh I remember we all had our life in the past and those things of the world. But once we got a hold of the real thing, something that quickened us, a little seed that comes to life, then all the things of the world rotted right there. We had no more desire of it. &gt;&gt; We heard the eagle story, but now we hear the duck story. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT LITTLE DUCK, ALL HIS LIFE, DUST IN THE DIRT AND THE barnyard and all that, but once he got near the water, the smell OF THE WATER ATTRACTED HIM. It didn't have a pull on the chickens. that had a pull on him because inside HE WAS A DUCK. GENETICALLY HE WAS A DUCK. NOBODY HAD TO TEACH HIM. NOBODY HAD TO PERSUADE HIM. NOBODY HAD to convince him because it was in him TO BE A DUCK. AND THE SMELL OF WATER WASN'T ATTRACTED TO HIM. AND HE WENT AS hard as HE COULD RIGHT INTO THE WATER. AND GUESS WHAT? NOBODY HAD TO TEACH HIM HOW TO SWIM. HE WENT RIGHT IN AND STARTED SWIMMING. WHY? HE WAS GENETICALLY BUILT TO BE A DUCK. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, YOU WERE PROGRAMMED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD TO BE A BELIEVER IN THIS END TIME TO BE PART OF THE MINISTRY OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; To be THE WORD MADE MANIFEST. YOU WERE PROGRAMMED. AND WHEN YOU SAW IT, WHEN YOU HEARD IT, SOMETHING IN YOU, YOU CAUGHT A WHIFF of it. And you may HAVE HEARD IT WITH FRIENDS AND YOU MAY HAVE HEARD IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE. AND THEY MAY HAVE STRAYED AWAY. AND THEY MAY HAVE SAID THEY DON'T LIKE IT. THEY MAY HAVE GOT IN THE WATER AND GOT BACK OUT AND SAID, "THAT'S NOT FOR ME." BUT IT DOESN'T change you. YOU CAN'T CHANGE BECAUSE THIS IS WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, this message for me is something more than what I believe. &gt;&gt; It's who I am. &gt;&gt; And I believe it because it's who I am. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This message identified who I was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It took the spiritual amnesia away. It I heard my father calling and all of a sudden realized I'm a son. I'm a son not because I'm worthy. I'm a son not because I worked my way up to I'm a son because I heard my father calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And something in me responded. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Listen friends, [laughter] this is this is life. &gt;&gt; This message isn't a gospel preaching plus some truths attached. &gt;&gt; This message is the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is the good news. It is the way of salvation for our day. It is the program of God. It is deliverance. It is our rescue. It is our healing. It is our restoration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not the first four, the the the New Testament corrected and now with a little more life. It's not that, friends. It's more than that. This is Jesus Christ, our bridegroom, coming to connect with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bringing the fullness of who he is, showing you the fullness of who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. giving us the confidence that we can move away from traditions, move away from our own thinking and accept what's not possible. &gt;&gt; Listen, when when the angel came to Mary the virgin in Nazareth and said, "Listen, time for the word to be fulfilled. I was sent to send you and tell you that you're the one." Listen, that was not reasonable. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This one woman in Nazareth, 16 years old or so, engaged to a man, she believed something that was not even reasonable. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; and besides that, can you imagine the audacity of a 16-year-old girl, not born in nobility, not from a priest family, ignorant as ignorant can be, doesn't even know, doesn't even have the Bible verses memorized. What right does she have to say that I'm the fulfillment of Isaiah 7? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sure priests would look at her, she would say that, they would just scorn and say, "What arrogance, &gt;&gt; what pride, &gt;&gt; how can you say a thing like that?" She could say it cuz she believed it. &gt;&gt; She could say it because the angel messenger that was sent her told her who she was. LISTEN, THIS ISN'T ARROGANCE THAT GOD WHEN GOD REVEALS who you are AND YOU SAY, "I'M A CHILD OF GOD. I MEAN, FROM THE FOR FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, I'M PART OF HIS BRIDE." THERE'S NOT ARROGANCE. I MEAN, SOMEBODY CAN HAVE ARROGANCE, BUT THAT'S NOT AN ARROGANT STATEMENT BECAUSE AN ANGEL MESSENGER came to TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; AND HE GAVE YOU THE WORD FOR YOUR DAY AND something in you, it resonated. IT WAS THUMP THUMP. THAT'S THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'M IDENTIFIED NOT BY MY good deeds. I'M NOT IDENTIFIED BY MY SCHOLARLY INTELLECT. I'M NOT IDENTIFIED BY THIS. I'M IDENTIFIED BY THE VERY FACT THAT WHEN ELIJAH WAS SENT TO ME, I RECEIVED IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. And amen. &gt;&gt; Let's get back to the simplicity of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "The seed of God is actually placed in us from the foundation of the world. When that light first strikes that seed, it brings it to life. But the light first has to come upon the seed." Like I've taught many times of the little woman at the well and her that condition. Though she be ill fame, though her life was degraded, she was in that condition because that traditions had never touched her. But when the light first struck her, quickly she recognized it because there was something there to respond to it. When the deep calleth through the deep, there must be a deep somewhere to respond to that call. Oh friends, if there's something deep in you to respond to the call, then you should thank God every day of your life. Best day, worst day, good things, bad things, you should thank God every moment of your life because there was something deep in me to respond to this deep. I didn't work my way up into it. I didn't try to believe. Amen. I there was just something in me that believed. &gt;&gt; What's that? That's the real gift. &gt;&gt; That's the real gift. It wasn't a brain strain. &gt;&gt; It was a natural reaction. &gt;&gt; Listen, when I come to the message, my brain was twisted up in knots, but something inside of me was believing. &gt;&gt; I was confused as all as all get out because I had been raised in what I thought was the truth and was perfectly understandable. It was right. And then we know this is absolutely right. And the message came and ripped my whole understanding upside down and twisted me all IN KNOTS. BUT IT WASN'T MY MIND that brought me to the message. IT WAS SOMETHING INSIDE THAT COULD NOT stay away from it. It was irresistible to me. &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH it was harmful TO MY MIND, IT WAS HARMFUL to my flesh. BUT IN MY SOUL, IT WAS IRRESISTIBLE. I COULDN'T stay away. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Brother Beam said back in the Smyrna church age he speaks of Jacob. He says so it was the thought AND THEN THAT THOUGHT BECAME expressed and so God bought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed. Jacob alone had the seed. That is why he had respect to the birthright and covenant of God. If you are true seed, you will hear that word. The spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age. See how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Who was the better boy, Esau or Jacob? &gt;&gt; Who took better care of their daddy, Esau or Jacob? &gt;&gt; Brother Beam said Esau was a much better man. &gt;&gt; Took better care of his dad. Had a better works program. &gt;&gt; Far outshine Jacob. &gt;&gt; But but it didn't matter, &gt;&gt; right? Jacob was the predestinated seed. &gt;&gt; Jacob was a mama's boy. He was a shyer. He was a cheat. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; And he was a predestinated seed gene of God. &gt;&gt; He would eventually have to wrestle that out with the angel and be changed and change his walk and change everything about. He was going to have to come to a change. Absolutely. But what he was before, Amen, didn't determine what what he was in his natural life as a boy did not determine what he was. what he was in the mind of God determined what he would be. &gt;&gt; He had to go through his corrections. He had to go through his journey. He had to meet God face to face. He had to have his WALK CHANGED. HE HAD to wrestle it out with God. He had to go through all of these things. Absolutely. Amen. But it wasn't anything he did that make him a child of God. He came to the earth a segene of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why God dealt with him the way that he did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brother Bram tells in the message communion. This is the last message that he preaches before God takes him home. And it's a small meeting, an intimate meeting there in the in the tabernacle in Tucson. And he begins to talk to them in the communion service. He said, "See, there's a little grain of life laying there that you wonder where did it come from? What these strange things?" I was saying this taking for myself like you was going to say William Brandon. Well, 40 years ago, the William Brham, it isn't the same one tonight. If somebody back there would say William Brandham, he was a rank rascal. See, because I was born of Charles and Ella Brandham. In their nature, I was a sinner. I came to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me. But down in there, too, was another nature present. See, predestinated was in there by God in this same body. See, two natures in there. Well, I only catered to the one. As it growed, I I grewed as a baby. Da da. First thing you know, I became a liar. Became everything else that is that's a sinner because I raised up that way. But down in there was a little speck of life all the time. &gt;&gt; What was it? There was another William Brandham. See, a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God. The word of God that was placed in there. Each one of you can think of similar things. See, it was working. Then look up to the trees and think, "Leaf, I seen you fall off last year. And why are you why are you back there again? Where'd you come from? What brought you here?" See, it was that eternal life working in the body. Now then, one day as I walked on, that voice talked, "Don't never smoke, drink, so forth." And the young fellas and all got and and all got older. See, there was something moving. But yet, all at once, I looked up and I said, "I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Brandon. There's something calling me like my little eagle. I'm not a chicken. There's something up yonder somewhere. Oh, great Jehovah, whoever you are, open up. I want to come home. There's something in me calling. Then I was born again. That little life was laying there. The life of the water was poured on it. Then it began to grow. Now that old life was forgiven, put in the sea of God's forgetfulness to never be remembered against me no more. Now we stand justified as though we never had sinned in the presence of God. Praise God. Brother Bam sitting there telling us his own conversion story. And he's recognizing that he didn't receive the segene of God when he confessed the word. He always had it. He had to come in contact with the word to awaken it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he tells us we're the same way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We come wrong. We were all kinds of different things and we've done all kinds of different things as we've got backgrounds and histories and we've got failures after coming to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; We've got all things in our flesh to distract us and we got all kinds of signals signaling to us that maybe we're wrong and maybe we're this and maybe we're that. But there's something inside that one day wakes up and says, "I'm not the son of Charles and Elabbrand." &gt;&gt; What does that mean? He's saying, "I'm the son of God." &gt;&gt; There's got to be an a spiritual awakening. There's got to be the breaking of spiritual amnesia. Amen. The confusion about who I am has to leave. And I have to find out that this word that's [clears throat] calling me is calling me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. NOT A GENERAL CALL THAT the word is calling the no but this word is calling me &gt;&gt; because something in me is responding to the word and if something in me is responding to the word then the word finds the word and the word finds the word and that means if I'm attracted to the word only the word is attracted to the word and if I'm attracted to the word then I must be &gt;&gt; word &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS I CAME FROM THE MIND OF GOD THAT MEANS THERE'S SOMETHING IN ME TO BELIEVE WITH. &gt;&gt; And there wasn't something in ME TO BELIEVE WITH, I COULDN'T BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD. THAT'S MY IDENTIFICATION. NOT THE GOOD DEEDS I'VE DONE OR THE BAD DEEDS I'VE DONE. I'M I PRAISE GOD THAT I HOPE IN THE FUTURE TO do good deeds. &gt;&gt; AND I'M ASHAMED TO SAY THAT I'LL PROBABLY DO BAD DEEDS. &gt;&gt; But one thing I KNOW IS I CANNOT MAKE THOSE MY IDENTIFICATION. I can't make works or signs or wonders my identification because at THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT THAT PROVED NOT TO BE ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NEITHER CAN I MAKE MY BAD DEEDS MY IDENTIFICATION BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S HAD THEM. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING ELSE THAT I CAN IDENTIFY MYSELF WITH AND FIND MY IDENTITY. AND I CAN FIND MY IDENTITY IN THE WORD. I CAN SCRIPTURALLY IDENTIFY WHO I AM. I AM A CHILD OF God &gt;&gt; because of the word. because something in me received this word. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, what a privileged people we are. &gt;&gt; Listen, what's the real gift? There's all kinds of gifts given to the church. There's gifts of tongues. There's gifts of interpretation of tongues, gifts of wisdom, gifts of knowledge. There's even gifts of giving. There's there's all kinds of gifts and helps and things that are given. There's the gift of the Holy Ghost. There's so many gifts given to the church. But Brother Brandham said the real gift is that soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; That soul that came from God, that gene of God that's in there. And if you find in yourself something that can believe this message despite all circumstances, but it still resonates with the word, then we can get on our knees and say, "Thank you, God, for that gift. Thank you for giving me the gift to believe. Thank you for placing SOMETHING IN ME. MY MIND WOULD HAVE NEVER been enough. My willpower would have never been enough. But there's something that's more than me in me that keeps bringing me back to this word." And that's my identification. And I thank God for it. That's the real I couldn't put it there. I can't manufacture it. I can't copy it. It's either there or it's not there. And it's there by the predestinated will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's there, all I can say is thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And God, you've stripped away my spiritual amnesia and now I'm no longer an identity crisis. [snorts] You know, sometimes we get an identity crisis because we we we can't clearly identify who we are. Am I a believer or am I not a believer? One day I'm a believer, the next day I'm not a believer. So, one day when I'm a believer, I feel like I'm close to God. Next day I'm not a believer. I feel like I'm I'm out of the program of God. One day I feel like, yeah, I'm probably bride. The next day I feel like I'm probably not bride. Listen, what kind of manifestation will that have? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Is that confusion? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we all struggle with it? &gt;&gt; But that confusion will keep our life topsyturvy back and forth bringing us into amnesia. And brother Bham said, one thing that brings amnesia is being halt between two opinions. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I talking about not child of God? &gt;&gt; Why? The question is, how are we identifying ourselves? &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ted, yesterday. What about yesterday? How's that an identificate? Yesterday I said something to my wife. It was a little sharp. Yeah, that was wrong. Repent. &gt;&gt; Say you're sorry. But what does that have to do with your sunship? &gt;&gt; How is that your identification? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I mean, Brother Brandham's wife slammed the door in his face. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was going to trick his wife into going up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, &gt;&gt; we all do wrong. BUT WHAT? BUT I I'M THIS, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW MY PAST, BUT you don't know how bad I've been. No. No. Listen. &gt;&gt; Can you find your identification in the scriptures? &gt;&gt; Do you see your place in the word? Can you find yourself part of the program of God for this end time? If you can find your identification in the scriptures and in faith in the word that's promised for this day, that identification can trump all other IDENTIFICATIONS AND PUT IT all to rest so that we can finally get the right identification. Father, I hear THE VOICE OF MY FATHER. I heard this message. It's the VOICE OF MY FATHER. I heard the voice of MY FATHER. I DIDN'T HEAR THE VOICE OF A FATHER. I didn't hear THE VOICE OF THE FATHER. I HEARD THE VOICE OF MY FATHER. &gt;&gt; AND IF I HEARD MY FATHER CALLING ME, THEN I'M HIS SON. &gt;&gt; The great shepherd come and found me. &gt;&gt; And I heard his voice and something in me trusted that voice and wanted to follow him. &gt;&gt; That makes me his sheep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I found the fresh kill of the word for my day and it tasted good to me and I wanted to eat it. That makes me eagle. &gt;&gt; I'm an eagle sheep son. &gt;&gt; And a recipient of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; I found MY IDENTIFICATION IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; NOT IN MY FLESH, IN THE WORD. NOT IN MY PAST, IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; And now I can stand upon the word and declare I am a child of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; God, help me from my mistakes. God, please cleanse me from my errors and fails. God, forgive me for all that I do wrong, but I know I belong to you. I know I came from you. I'm like the wind. Nobody else may be able to determine where I came from or where I'm going, but I came from somewhere and I'm going somewhere. And you're meeting me in my journey, and you're sensing the rustling of the leaves and hearing the THE WIND BLOW BY AS I COME BY. BUT I KNOW WHERE I came from now. By the new birth, BY SPIRITUAL BIRTH, I CAME FROM GOD. I'M GOING BACK TO God &gt;&gt; by the grace of God. I've been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ. When he shed that blood, HE WAS BUYING ME BACK BECAUSE HE CAME AND HE BOUGHT THE FIELD TO GET THE PEARL. AND I'M PART OF THE PEARL, &gt;&gt; which is his bride, his people. I'm part of it. &gt;&gt; I'm part of the program. I'm the recipient of the prophecy. I found my true identification. And I found in me the real gift and I'm thankful for that. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Let's stand together. Musicians, if you'll please come. And Blake, if you'll come, please. I want to read one more scripture together as we're standing. And because you are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying, "Aba, Father." What makes us cry back, father? Because we are sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because we are sons, he sent us the spirit of his son into our hearts crying, "Aba, father." God sent his spirit to wake up that seed of God so we could cry out, "You are my father. &gt;&gt; You are my father and I'm your son. And no matter what happens to me on this life, I've got that revelation of who I am. This is why, listen, all the bad circumstances in the world can't smudge this out. Your own failure and mistake can't smudge this out. The whole world turning upside down and against you can't smudge this out. This is a revelation based on his word, not on external circumstances. When we come to this revelation and have the spiritual amnesia removed from us, then all of a sudden on my worst day, I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; On my best day, I'm a son of God. In every day and in every circumstances, when things go against me, I'm a son of God. When things go for me, I'm a son of God because my revelation is based off his word. &gt;&gt; I heard his voice. Amen. Let's bow our heads together and just thank God. Lord Jesus, we thank you for this word, Lord. God, you have showed us through your word, God, that we're not here by accident. And we're not believers by accident. We didn't stumble upon something, Lord, and as [clears throat] if we tripped over you and accidentally found you. That may be our humanistic perspective, but God, you were waiting in the way. You knew the way we would take. And just like you had an appointment in Samaria with a woman coming to the well, you had an appointment with us. And you made sure that we would bump into you along the way somewhere so that you could give us your word. And that word would identify us like it did the woman at the well, God, like it did all of your children down through time. We've come in contact with this manifestation of the word, and it quickened us to life. Your spirit came upon the word and it woke us up to who we really are. And God, now we want to live to the fullness of that life. God, I don't want to stay halt between two opinions. That means no forward progress. I don't want to be going around the same question trying to answer again and again whether or not I'm a son of God. If I stay there, I'm making no progress. But Lord, you've called us into adoption. You've called us to grow up into the full measure of the stature of Christ. God, you've called us to move from faith under temperance and on and on and on to perfect love. God, help us, Lord, answer the questions that are in our lives. Lord, we pray you by your word quiet the voice of the enemy. Silence the lies of the devil and may your word become our truth, our light, our portion. God, bring us higher and higher in this revelation. May we get further and further from the world and the carnality that's associated. And may we realize with clearer vision all the time who we really are. And God, may that change our conduct. May it change the way we conduct ourselves in this world. May it change the way we face every day of our lives. May we have, Lord, that uh inspiration and understanding that will guide us through life. God, I give you my life aresh again. And I thank you for the gift you placed within me before the foundation of the world. [music] A gift of faith that could believe your word. Love you and thank you for it, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. We'll be back here, Lord willing, at 4 p.m. Amen.
