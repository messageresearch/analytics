[0:00] we've learned these things since we're
[0:02] little toddlers we've learned these
[0:03] things since we're little kids those who
[0:04] have been raised in church and we know
[0:06] the story we've seen the picture books
[0:08] we've colored pictures about it amen but
[0:10] I don't think we realize the gravity of
[0:12] the situation he's standing there with
[0:14] no hope in the world nothing that he
[0:17] himself can ever do to ever cover his
[0:19] shame and nakedness he's lost he's
[0:21] finished he's done and there's nothing
[0:23] he can do
[0:25] himself right and here comes God Amen
[0:28] coming down in judgment and God is now
[0:30] ad ministering judgment and he's
[0:32] standing here naked exposed helpless
[0:35] with irreversible damage and there's
[0:37] nothing he can do but he's got a loving
[0:39] father who created him and has a purpose
[0:41] for his life and that father goes and
[0:43] finds an innocent lamb that's never
[0:45] sinned never disbelieved never done
[0:47] anything wrong and he took that lamb and
[0:50] he slayed that lamb can you imagine what
[0:52] Adam was thinking when he was watching
[0:54] God there had never been death there had
[0:56] never been Bloodshed there had never
[0:58] been the bleeding of the Lamb there
[1:00] never been the stench of fresh flowing
[1:01] blood this was
[1:04] death
[1:06] yes this was I guarantee a traumatic
[1:11] event first time he had ever witnessed
[1:14] it first time he had ever seen death
[1:16] first time he had ever witnessed
[1:17] suffering the first time he'd ever seen
[1:19] blood flow the first time he had heard a
[1:21] desperate bleed the first time he had
[1:23] heard a death
[1:28] rattle and it was God doing
[1:32] it it was God afflicting the punishment
[1:35] it was God causing the
[1:39] death what was he doing it
[1:42] for because he had to have a covering of
[1:47] innocency to cover the shame of his son
[1:52] sir something had to die because that
[1:55] was the penalty for sin so God took this
[1:57] innocent lamb and this innocent lamb
[2:00] became Adam by
[2:03] imputation and he imputed Adam's sin
[2:05] upon this lamb and slayed slayed the
[2:08] lamb not for the lamb but he slayed the
[2:10] lamb for Adam's
[2:12] sins and then he took the skin off of
[2:15] the lamb and he placed it upon his son
[2:17] and now his son was covered and could
[2:20] continue on amen he wasn't smitten dead
[2:23] in an instant he continued on and God
[2:25] was trying he was beginning the process
[2:27] of restoring fellowship with his Fallen
[2:29] son
[2:33] what a what an
[2:35] experience that would have been to live
[2:38] through it's not a coloring book page it
[2:42] was a
[2:44] reality but neither is Jesus Christ
[2:47] nailed to the cross a coloring book page
[2:50] it's a reality amen who was nailed to
[2:52] the cross that's me he wasn't there for
[2:54] him he was there for me he was nailed
[2:56] because of my sin because of my
[2:58] nakedness because I left the world word
[3:00] because I left the veil of innocency not
[3:02] just I was born wrong I chose to do
[3:05] wrong amen and he took all of my sin and
[3:08] all of my shame and all of my perversion
[3:11] and all of my red spots and he shed his
[3:13] blood and he died and he was the
[3:15] innocent
[3:18] lamb so that God could clothe me in a
[3:22] white robe
