[5:41] service amen when we see somebody come
[5:44] to the lord
[5:45] and obey the word and while we're
[5:47] standing let's learn to psalms
[5:49] 51 psalm 51 verse 7.
[5:54] we'll just read one verse and then we'll
[5:57] ask the lord to bless the reading of the
[5:58] word
[5:59] psalm 51 verse 7 purge me with hyssop
[6:02] and i shall be clean wash me and i shall
[6:06] be whiter than snow let's bow our heads
[6:08] and pray lord jesus we thank you
[6:11] for your word lord and we thank you god
[6:13] for this atmosphere
[6:15] lord i appreciate lord a body of
[6:18] believers who wants to sing your praises
[6:20] and i appreciate
[6:21] your desire to have fellowship with us
[6:23] lord for if it wasn't you drawing us
[6:25] there was nothing we can do and if you
[6:27] didn't love us first we could never love
[6:28] you back
[6:30] look always so appreciate lord the
[6:32] fellowship and
[6:33] now we come to the the preaching of the
[6:35] word we ask that you would take
[6:37] preeminence lord
[6:38] we haven't come to hear from a man we've
[6:40] come to hear from you father
[6:42] we've come to you as our great shepherd
[6:44] and asked that you would break the bread
[6:45] of life lord and you would feed us fresh
[6:47] manna from heaven
[6:48] for you know what we have need of lord
[6:50] we pray you would give it to us now
[6:52] that we might be sustained in this
[6:54] journey of life
[6:55] lord we give you first place lord let me
[6:57] give you a word preeminence
[6:58] we ask that you would speak in jesus
[7:01] name we pray
[7:02] amen you can all be seated
[7:07] for a title today i would like to take
[7:09] the subject of
[7:13] cleaned by the word clean by the word
[7:15] and
[7:16] last service we were talking about the
[7:18] building on a strong foundation we're
[7:20] talking about the foundation of faith
[7:22] and how abraham believed god and it was
[7:23] imputed in him for righteousness and
[7:26] and what a strong foundation that is
[7:28] because we find that the
[7:29] seed of god has the capacity to believe
[7:32] the word of god
[7:33] for their day amen there's many people
[7:36] that can believe what has already
[7:38] happened what has been proved what has
[7:39] been testified of
[7:41] amen but the seed of god can receive the
[7:44] word for their day amen
[7:45] and be able to receive the word for
[7:47] their day amen god is able to impute
[7:50] unto them righteousness and
[7:51] this was god's plan of salvation from
[7:53] the beginning
[7:55] and so upon that strong foundation we
[7:58] we have to have that sort of foundation
[8:00] because we have a tendency to get
[8:02] knocked around in life and
[8:04] not everything always goes right we
[8:06] don't always make good decisions we make
[8:07] mistakes we have failures we have
[8:09] fallings and
[8:10] and we have the devil always whispering
[8:12] in our ear
[8:13] amen trying to brother ben said he can
[8:16] put thoughts in your mind
[8:18] right he can't read your mind but he can
[8:20] put thoughts in your mind amen and so
[8:22] many times the devil is is rambling
[8:24] through our mind with thoughts that
[8:26] don't match the word don't have anything
[8:27] to do with the word
[8:28] but sometimes he'll use the word
[8:32] in a deceptive way to try to trip us up
[8:34] and that's why we need the firm
[8:36] foundation of
[8:37] the faith of abraham that i'm a seed of
[8:39] abraham because i have the faith of
[8:41] abraham
[8:41] and god has imputed unto me
[8:43] righteousness not by my works or by my
[8:45] deeds but because he placed inside of me
[8:48] something that could believe him today
[8:51] and by that i recognize that i'm his
[8:53] amen
[8:54] and so and by that i'm saved i'm saved
[8:56] by faith
[8:58] but today i want to talk about clean by
[9:00] the word i want to keep
[9:01] keep progressing on as the lord leads
[9:04] and
[9:04] here when we look at this scripture i
[9:07] love the way this is worded
[9:08] amen because it smacks in the face of
[9:11] denominationalism
[9:12] it says purge me with hyssop and i shall
[9:15] be clean
[9:17] it says wash me and i shall be whiter
[9:19] than snow
[9:21] so in this passage of scripture it has
[9:24] nothing to do with the person making the
[9:26] request they have no ability to wash
[9:28] themselves or make themselves clean
[9:30] the request is the request is purge me
[9:33] with hyssop and i shall be clean
[9:34] if you purge me with hyssop i'll be
[9:36] clean
[9:38] wash me and i'll be water if you wash me
[9:40] i'll be whiter than snow
[9:41] it wasn't somebody saying lord i've
[9:43] washed myself i've prepared myself i've
[9:45] done everything right and now i'm clean
[9:48] but they've come to the realization if
[9:50] if you purge me with hyssop i'll be
[9:51] clean
[9:52] if you wash me i'll be white as snow and
[9:55] this is one thing that we must realize
[9:57] that
[9:57] that this is god's doing amen this is
[9:59] god's work because it's his desire
[10:01] it's his determination it was the heart
[10:04] purpose of god to have a bride of his
[10:06] own choosing
[10:06] and if he's going to have a bride of his
[10:08] own choosing amen there's certain
[10:10] criteria that his law requires
[10:12] amen and he cannot be joined to iniquity
[10:15] he cannot join himself
[10:16] to evil amen first it must be purged it
[10:19] must be sanctified it must be clean
[10:21] before he can unite with it
[10:22] and if this is god's heart purpose his
[10:24] great desire
[10:25] to have a bride of his own choosing then
[10:27] if we come in a sinful way in a fallen
[10:30] flesh by the fall
[10:31] and the garden of eden but god still
[10:33] purposed that we are his bride
[10:35] and his law forbids him from uniting
[10:38] with anything that's evil
[10:39] amen then he has to put in place a
[10:42] mechanism
[10:44] so that his desire can be fulfilled and
[10:47] by the grace of god he has placed that
[10:49] in his word amen let's go to revelation
[10:52] chapter 1
[10:54] and look at this
[10:59] revelation chapter 1
[11:04] and verse 5
[11:08] and from jesus christ who is the
[11:10] faithful witness and the first begotten
[11:11] of the dead
[11:12] and the prince of the kings of the earth
[11:14] unto him that loved us
[11:15] and washed us from our sins in his own
[11:18] blood
[11:18] and hath made us kings and priests unto
[11:20] god and his father
[11:22] to him be glory and dominion forever and
[11:24] ever
[11:25] amen who washed who
[11:29] he washed us let's go to ephesians
[11:33] chapter five
[11:34] we've got quite a few scriptures so keep
[11:35] your bibles handy with you we want to go
[11:37] through
[11:38] a number of scriptures
[11:41] this morning ephesians chapter 5
[11:46] verse 25.
[11:50] husbands love your wives even as christ
[11:52] also loved the church and gave himself
[11:53] for it
[11:54] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[11:56] with the washing of the water by the
[11:57] word
[11:58] that he might present it to himself a
[12:00] glorious church
[12:01] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[12:03] thing but that it should be holy
[12:06] and without blemish wow if that's what
[12:10] god's determined to do then that's what
[12:12] he's going to do
[12:14] and and i by faith can be the recipient
[12:17] of his determinate counsel of his
[12:19] if his desire of his heart's purpose
[12:22] amen and so if it's not amen there's
[12:25] nothing we can do
[12:26] of ourselves there's nothing we can do
[12:29] for ourselves amen
[12:30] all we can do is accept what he's
[12:32] already given what he's already done
[12:35] we must come god's way according to
[12:37] god's plan but it's his plan and his
[12:39] purpose and his desire
[12:41] so he gave himself for the church that
[12:43] he might sanctify and cleanse it with
[12:45] the washing of water
[12:47] by the word so that he might sanctify it
[12:50] so that
[12:51] he might cleanse it by the washing of
[12:53] water by the word
[12:55] so he does the washing he does the
[12:57] cleansing
[12:58] and he provided the cleaning mechanism
[13:00] which was the word
[13:03] praise be to god that he might present
[13:06] it to himself
[13:08] a glorious church not having spot or
[13:10] wrinkle or any such thing
[13:12] but it should be holy and without
[13:13] blemish i'm so glad the scripture didn't
[13:16] say
[13:17] that christ is waiting amen for his wife
[13:19] to wash herself and become perfect and
[13:21] wrinkle fee without blemish
[13:23] and then he'll receive her because if
[13:25] the word was written that way
[13:27] i would be a very discouraged human
[13:29] being believing that i will never be the
[13:31] bride of jesus christ i will never come
[13:33] into the invisible union
[13:34] i will never take a body change but
[13:36] because he said he would do it i can
[13:38] have faith that i
[13:39] am the bride i will come into union i
[13:42] have come into you
[13:42] jesus christ i will go i will take a
[13:45] body change i will be united with him
[13:47] physically in the millennial reign
[13:49] i will because he's going to do it amen
[13:52] not because
[13:53] i do it because he does it not because i
[13:55] wield it but because he willed it amen
[13:58] so i can have faith because of the way
[14:00] the word is written because if it was
[14:02] written differently i would be very
[14:04] discouraged i would be
[14:05] very uh i would be upset i would be in
[14:08] depression all the time
[14:09] because no matter how much i try amen
[14:12] evil is present with me when i would do
[14:13] good
[14:14] evil is present with me no matter how
[14:15] much i try i can't hit that place in my
[14:18] own efforts with my own will
[14:20] to do everything just right
[14:24] we've been sown into a corrupt body of
[14:26] flesh with the human spirit
[14:28] and not no fault of our own is what
[14:30] brother branham said
[14:32] not no fault of our own it was because
[14:34] of the fall in the garden of eden
[14:35] but because we come corrupt because we
[14:37] come polluted
[14:38] amen we don't have the mechanism within
[14:41] ourselves to get to the place where we
[14:43] must be to be united with the holy god
[14:45] so god had to provide something amen to
[14:48] make sure that his
[14:49] will would not be thwarted by a fall
[14:54] so god has provided that for us he says
[14:57] in the message
[14:58] hear ye him this is the washing of the
[15:01] water of separation by the word
[15:03] the word that washes us and cleanses us
[15:06] and sanctify them father through the
[15:08] truth
[15:08] he said thy word is truth is that right
[15:11] and we are
[15:12] washed we are washed of the waters of
[15:14] separation from our sins
[15:16] by the word of god the word separates us
[15:19] and sets us in place
[15:22] so god has provided everything that we
[15:24] have need of and that he
[15:26] has provided everything to meet his own
[15:28] requirements
[15:30] god's provided he's only asking us to
[15:32] believe
[15:34] you know when the children of israel
[15:35] were coming out of egypt god provided
[15:37] everything they needed to come out of
[15:39] egypt and go to the promised land
[15:42] he sent them a prophet with the word he
[15:43] sent them a pillar of fire for
[15:44] leadership
[15:45] amen when they were thirsty he sent
[15:47] water when they were hungry he sent
[15:49] bread
[15:49] amen he provided everything he gave them
[15:51] protection he gave them leadership
[15:53] he gave him his word he gave them
[15:55] everything they needed to get
[15:57] out from under bondage in egypt all the
[15:59] way through the wilderness journey and
[16:01] all the way established into the
[16:02] promised land
[16:03] they had everything all they had to do
[16:05] was trust him
[16:07] believe him obey him and rely on what he
[16:09] had given
[16:10] and where they failed is when they
[16:12] failed to stay with what he gave
[16:14] and they failed to trust him in the way
[16:16] that he was working
[16:18] the failure in the wilderness was not
[16:20] god's failure it was man's failure to
[16:22] stick with god's program
[16:24] and every time we fail and i mean it's
[16:26] not god's failure it's never god's
[16:28] failure
[16:29] it's our failure to stay with his
[16:31] program
[16:32] because if we stay with this program and
[16:34] stay with his word it will never
[16:36] fail amen they fell in the wilderness
[16:39] because they didn't
[16:40] trust his word they failed in the
[16:43] wilderness because they didn't trust his
[16:44] prophet
[16:46] they failed in the wilderness because
[16:47] they didn't trust his provision
[16:53] and i say i don't want to fail i want to
[16:55] trust his word
[16:56] i want to trust this prophet i want to
[16:58] trust the leadership of the pillar of
[16:59] fire i want to trust his provisions and
[17:01] i want to stay right in there no matter
[17:03] what it looks like to my mind no matter
[17:05] how scary it is
[17:06] amen to my emotions i want to stay right
[17:08] there with the word because it's the
[17:09] word that washes
[17:10] us
[17:14] now let's go to john 15 the gospel of
[17:17] john
[17:19] chapter 15.
[17:31] now it's it's interesting we're talking
[17:35] about subjects we've talked about
[17:36] for years like this previous wednesday
[17:39] we were really talking about
[17:40] justification
[17:42] by faith and we know that that god
[17:44] builds us up through justification
[17:46] sanctification baptism holy ghost that
[17:47] that's the the new birth experience and
[17:50] and we know that you know we've had uh
[17:52] uh through luther we've had
[17:54] justification through wesley we've had
[17:55] sanctification
[17:56] baptism of holy ghost through the
[17:58] pentecostal age
[17:59] amen all bringing us to a perfect image
[18:02] of a perfect bride amen that was the
[18:03] purpose
[18:04] that's what brother bam said uh luther
[18:06] wesley and pentecost were
[18:07] all foreshadowing reflecting the coming
[18:10] of a perfect bride
[18:11] because all of these things come
[18:12] together amen in the in the person of
[18:15] jesus christ in his bride
[18:18] so when we talked about you know
[18:19] justification we can start talking about
[18:21] justification oh i know that and i know
[18:23] that
[18:23] but i tell you when we come to wednesday
[18:25] it was a pleasure friends
[18:26] because the word keeps getting richer
[18:28] and the things that we thought we knew
[18:30] we didn't know them as we ought to
[18:32] and still today the things that we think
[18:34] we know we don't know them as we ought
[18:35] to amen
[18:36] because they go deeper than we could
[18:37] ever imagine the most simplest of the
[18:40] of the simple understanding god gave us
[18:42] the most simple basic fundamental of
[18:44] doctrines they go deeper than we could
[18:46] ever imagine
[18:48] and now we're looking at sanctification
[18:50] but i tell you friends
[18:51] to me as i study this it goes deeper
[18:53] than i ever imagined amen
[18:55] the word amen takes something that that
[18:57] we call uh
[18:58] simple that the denomination would call
[19:00] simple or basic
[19:01] amen but it's not simple it's not basic
[19:03] amen it's
[19:04] god it's god moving in our lives it's
[19:06] deep and it's rich and it's meaningful
[19:08] and it's personal to us
[19:12] in john 15 3 it says now
[19:15] ye are clean through the word which i
[19:17] have spoken unto you
[19:21] oh praise be to god you are clean
[19:24] through the word that i've spoken to you
[19:26] he's going to wash her by the washing of
[19:28] the water by the word
[19:29] amen he is going to make sure that he's
[19:32] going to get a word to his elect
[19:34] that will clean the elect amen he didn't
[19:36] tell them to go
[19:38] get clean amen he told them you're clean
[19:40] by the word that i've spoken unto you
[19:42] he's laying a principle down to the
[19:44] disciples amen that my word has the
[19:46] power to clean amen
[19:48] has the power to sanctify amen
[19:52] see this i hope i hope by the end of
[19:55] the morning this morning that we can
[19:57] take old pilgrim holiness and nazarene
[20:00] and
[20:00] methodist ideas amen and then let them
[20:03] be transformed to the reality of what
[20:05] god was trying
[20:06] to bring it wasn't a form or a method or
[20:09] or a religious set of orders that god
[20:11] wanted to sanctify his church by
[20:13] it was his word amen he wanted to
[20:15] sanctify his church by the washing of
[20:17] the water of the word
[20:21] and when men caught the fact that that
[20:23] we must be sanctified it's it's it's
[20:26] it's a scriptural principle that you
[20:28] must be clean you must be a clean vessel
[20:30] you must be holy and consecrated unto
[20:32] the lord amen then
[20:34] then you know men always they take the
[20:37] simplicity of the word and they make it
[20:38] complicated
[20:40] god said you must be clean you must
[20:42] separate you must unite to him you must
[20:44] separate from everything else and join
[20:45] only to him
[20:48] and let all your affection and all your
[20:50] love be on him
[20:51] and he would wash you but because
[20:55] men saw sanctification as a as a bible
[20:58] teaching
[20:59] amen then they had to make themselves
[21:01] sanctified
[21:04] then we all had to come up with all
[21:06] kinds of rules and
[21:07] orders and abstain from this and
[21:11] do this but don't do that and and if you
[21:13] do this and there's nothing wrong with
[21:16] recognizing
[21:16] in the word it's wrong to do this i mean
[21:18] you can't listen to a tape harley where
[21:20] brother bannon doesn't tell
[21:21] a woman how to dress and not cut her
[21:23] hair and a man not to tell dirty jokes
[21:24] and
[21:25] so he's telling you live right live
[21:27] clean do right make good choices amen
[21:30] there's not hardly a tape that you can
[21:32] listen to brother branham is not
[21:33] compelling people to live godly in
[21:35] christ jesus
[21:37] but the problem is when we think that by
[21:40] efforts of
[21:41] living right and and dressing right and
[21:43] wearing the right kind of hair and
[21:45] clothing and the right actions
[21:46] that somehow we can be sanctified by
[21:49] that amen we begin to get ourselves
[21:51] really discouraged because if if the
[21:53] power of sanctification is
[21:54] only in our ability to make good choices
[21:57] we're never going
[21:58] to arrive to the destination it'll be
[22:01] three steps forwards and two steps back
[22:03] i mean constantly all the time up and
[22:05] down and in and out and back and forth
[22:07] amen but but god wants you to make good
[22:09] choices because you love him he wants
[22:11] you to choose
[22:12] his word and choose him he wants you to
[22:14] surrender your will to his he wants you
[22:16] to unite only to him and forsake all
[22:18] others that's what he wants
[22:19] amen but he doesn't expect you to clean
[22:22] yourself
[22:22] he said i will clean you by the washing
[22:25] of the water of the world
[22:28] clean purge me with hyssop and i shall
[22:30] be clean wash me and i shall be white as
[22:32] snow
[22:34] if i do it myself it won't be a thorough
[22:38] cleaning
[22:41] so jesus says you're clean through the
[22:43] word which i have
[22:44] spoken unto you let's go to john chapter
[22:47] 6.
[22:53] in verse 63
[22:59] john 6 and 63 it is the spirit that
[23:02] quickeneth the flesh prophet of nothing
[23:04] the words that i speak unto you they are
[23:06] spirit and they
[23:08] are life it's the spirit and the life
[23:12] that will change your life
[23:13] amen comes from the words that he speaks
[23:17] the prophet of god says in the message
[23:19] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[23:20] and forever
[23:21] because as we see the gentile days
[23:23] ending and the coming of the blessed
[23:24] lord jesus
[23:25] we would ask that our hearts would be
[23:27] made pure as we study the word
[23:30] give us the word for the washing of the
[23:32] water by the word
[23:33] for to cleanse our minds from all
[23:36] unbelief
[23:37] amen see the real
[23:40] problem is unbelief
[23:45] it's not so much actions but unbelief
[23:47] amen
[23:48] actions are an outcropping of unbelief
[23:50] but the problem is
[23:51] unbelief and brotherhood is saying lord
[23:54] give us the word
[23:55] for the washing of the water by the word
[23:57] for the
[23:58] to cleanse our minds from all unbelief
[24:01] amen the word is there
[24:03] amen to fix the real root of the problem
[24:06] amen
[24:06] so so many times we can chase down
[24:08] symptoms and get tired
[24:10] trying to rein in symptoms and to fix
[24:12] symptoms
[24:13] amen but we got to get down to the root
[24:15] of the problem and the root of the
[24:17] problem is unbelief amen
[24:20] unbelief in god's word amen is the real
[24:23] sin and the only sin there is everything
[24:25] else is an
[24:26] attribute of sin or an outcropping or a
[24:29] manifestation of sin
[24:32] so we can go and clip weeds here and
[24:34] clip weeds here and clip weeds here
[24:35] amen but we've got to dig down and get
[24:37] to the root and the only thing that can
[24:38] do that is the washing of the water by
[24:40] the word amen
[24:41] to wash out unbelief wrong ideas wrong
[24:44] thinking
[24:45] amen and give us the revelation of the
[24:47] true word
[24:49] it washes let's go to john 17.
[24:56] john chapter i just 17. to lay in quite
[25:00] a few scriptures here
[25:06] john 17 and 14
[25:10] i have given them my word and the world
[25:12] has hated them because they are not of
[25:14] the world
[25:14] even as i am not of the world i pray not
[25:18] that thou should just take them out of
[25:19] the world but thou should has keep them
[25:21] from the evil
[25:22] they are not of the world even as i am
[25:24] not of the world
[25:25] sanctify them through the truth thy word
[25:28] is truth as thou has sent me into the
[25:31] world even so
[25:33] have i also sent them into the world and
[25:35] for their sakes i sanctify myself that
[25:37] they also might be sanctified
[25:40] through the truth so sanctification
[25:43] comes by
[25:44] the word and thy word is truth
[25:48] sanctify them by thy truth so we need
[25:51] the word of god
[25:52] that's why there's been such a
[25:54] restoration of the word in our day
[25:56] and and i don't know that we ever can
[25:58] fully
[25:59] realize or fully comprehend the value we
[26:02] have in the restored word
[26:04] because the restored word has a power in
[26:06] it it is nothing less than the
[26:08] mystery of god revealed the revelation
[26:10] of jesus christ
[26:12] amen not the partial revelation but the
[26:14] whole revelation of jesus christ
[26:16] the seals have been opened the mystery
[26:18] has been taken off the book the entire
[26:20] bible has been open
[26:22] and if the truth is going to bring a
[26:24] sanctification
[26:25] what will happen when the entire bible
[26:27] now has been opened
[26:28] and all the truth that's been laying in
[26:30] mystery form for generations
[26:32] has now been opened and revealed to the
[26:33] bride what kind of sanctifying power
[26:36] comes with that truth
[26:39] amen you know you know uh there's there
[26:42] was a life that needs to be lived in
[26:44] this day
[26:45] and that life can only be lived by the
[26:47] sanctifying power of the word
[26:49] not by a a man's measuring stick or a
[26:52] rule book or
[26:52] or any sort of a man-made guidance
[26:55] that's not going to cut it it's got to
[26:56] take the power of the word
[26:58] to wash out all the unbelief amen to
[27:00] give us the ability to live the life
[27:03] that he's called us to live in this day
[27:05] the bride should live a life
[27:07] like none other amen we're coming to the
[27:09] end where it's the manifestation of
[27:11] jesus christ in bride form
[27:13] all that he was amen he poured into the
[27:15] church and it needs to manifest the very
[27:17] life of jesus christ
[27:18] and how are we going to do it without
[27:19] the washing of the water
[27:21] of the word for an extreme manifestation
[27:25] he sent an extreme word
[27:28] so that the power is not in us so many
[27:31] times we can hear
[27:32] preaching we have to be this and the
[27:33] bride has to be that and we've got to be
[27:35] this and it's all
[27:36] every bit true but it's not going to be
[27:38] done by our own power and efforts and
[27:40] will and ability
[27:41] it's going to be done by the word that
[27:43] he sent to us he sent his word
[27:45] and he healed her disease amen he spoke
[27:47] the word and he cleansed us amen
[27:52] so there's so many times that that we
[27:55] struggle with things
[27:57] we struggle with besetting sins we
[27:59] struggle with habits we struggle with
[28:00] personality we struggle
[28:02] with all of these and we are fighting so
[28:04] hard to try to overcome those things
[28:07] am i the only one we we hate those
[28:11] things that trip us up we hate those
[28:13] things
[28:13] and we're trying to fight those things
[28:15] but i'm telling you friends we're just
[28:16] making ourselves tired
[28:18] because the real overcoming power comes
[28:21] by the washing of the word
[28:23] we've got to stay under the washing of
[28:25] the word and in that word
[28:27] nonstop day or night all the time and it
[28:29] will
[28:30] wash us friends so some of our efforts
[28:33] are just making us tired
[28:36] and i'm tired of being tired i want to
[28:39] run the race with patience
[28:42] i want to know that what god has given
[28:43] me is enough amen
[28:45] if there's something that there's
[28:46] something that i'm struggling with i
[28:48] i know that what god has provided in
[28:50] this day is absolutely adequate to get
[28:52] me to the position i have to be in in
[28:54] this day
[28:55] god could not require a position for the
[28:58] bride if he did not already make a
[29:00] mechanism for her to get to that
[29:01] position
[29:02] because she has no ability in herself so
[29:04] god foreknew
[29:05] what this bride would be in the end time
[29:07] and he had to send a prophet in this day
[29:09] he had to restore the word he had to
[29:11] open the seals he had to take the
[29:13] mystery off of god
[29:14] so that we would understand who jesus
[29:16] christ was and who we are in him
[29:21] so that we could live to the full
[29:24] potential
[29:26] chapter 13. let's turn there together
[29:30] john chapter 13.
[29:34] i've talked about this scripture several
[29:37] times but i want to
[29:38] put it in context here
[29:41] god has taken his word and he's cleansed
[29:43] us he's cleansed us from denominational
[29:45] thinking he's cleansed us from the world
[29:47] he has cleansed us and then he's filled
[29:49] us with this spirit
[29:50] amen but but as we walk in this world we
[29:53] still
[29:54] need god to keep us clean
[29:57] we still need the power of the word to
[29:58] keep us clean
[30:00] he said in john 13
[30:03] verse 8 this is the last supper when
[30:06] before they eat the last supper jesus is
[30:08] going to wash their feet
[30:09] he says in verse 8 peter sayeth unto him
[30:11] thou shalt never wash my feet
[30:13] jesus answered him if i wash thee not
[30:15] thou has no part with me
[30:17] simon peter said unto him lord not my
[30:19] feet only but also my hands and my head
[30:21] jesus saith in him he that is washed and
[30:23] he does not save to wash his feet
[30:25] but is clean every wit and you're clean
[30:27] but not all
[30:28] for he knew who should betray him
[30:30] therefore he said you're not all clean
[30:33] so jesus had already said you're clean
[30:35] through the word i've spoken unto you
[30:36] so they were cleaned by the word but
[30:38] jesus gets down to wash their feet to
[30:40] show
[30:40] that they're still part of you that's
[30:42] still in contact with the world
[30:44] and i will keep washing you amen i will
[30:47] keep your feet
[30:48] you've been to the bath house you've
[30:49] been cleansed amen my word has washed
[30:51] you
[30:52] but you're walking through a world amen
[30:54] and we're walking through a world with
[30:55] an old nature and a fallen human body
[30:57] amen and things get on you dust and dirt
[31:00] from the road
[31:00] but jesus christ is there to wash you
[31:03] friends
[31:04] to keep us clean brother brown said in
[31:08] the message adoption part 3 from 1960
[31:10] he said by faith are you saved that's
[31:12] your faith in god
[31:14] the blood keeps you clean from sin
[31:16] because it makes a sacrifice the blood
[31:18] doesn't save you the blood keeps you
[31:20] clean
[31:20] how do you say saved by faith are you
[31:22] saved and that by god's foreknowledge
[31:24] calling you
[31:25] you are saved and the blood makes an
[31:27] atonement constantly keeping you clean
[31:30] if god knew there had to be a blood
[31:32] atonement to constantly keep you clean
[31:34] he would know that you constantly need
[31:37] cleaning
[31:39] so when we find ourselves in need of his
[31:41] cleaning power the sanctification of the
[31:43] word
[31:44] we don't need to go back to ground zero
[31:45] and say i'm not a believer i've never
[31:47] arrived
[31:48] how could i ever be bride you could be
[31:50] bribed by his foreknowledge amen your
[31:52] bride by his choosing amen not by your
[31:54] conduct the bride
[31:55] question was settled long ago friends
[31:58] you're not trying to settle it out now
[32:00] by your conduct what you need to do is
[32:02] believe what he's told you amen what
[32:04] he's whispered the love secret that he's
[32:06] whispered in your heart
[32:07] you need to believe it and stay in the
[32:08] washing of the water of the word
[32:10] and let that change you
[32:14] and then as you walk through this world
[32:17] and things happen
[32:18] and your mistakes and failures realize
[32:20] that there's an atonement there keeping
[32:22] you clean amen
[32:26] let's go to first john
[32:30] first john
[32:34] chapter one super familiar scripture but
[32:38] i'm gonna lay it in right here because
[32:39] it fits really well
[32:44] first john 1 5. this is the message
[32:46] which we have heard of him
[32:48] and declare unto you that god is light
[32:50] and in him has no darkness at all
[32:52] if we say that we have fellowship with
[32:54] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[32:56] not the truth
[32:57] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[32:59] the light we have fellowship one with
[33:01] another
[33:01] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[33:03] cleanses us from all
[33:05] sin what do i have to do
[33:09] walk in the light what is the light the
[33:12] light is the revealed word of the hour
[33:14] it's his word revealed
[33:15] that's the light and it washes you and
[33:17] it keeps you clean
[33:21] brother bam gets a question in 1964 he's
[33:24] in august of 1964 and he gets questions
[33:26] and answers
[33:27] and this question comes it's question
[33:29] number 378
[33:30] and he refers they write down the
[33:32] scripture of romans 7
[33:34] 14 to 18 and they quote it here we know
[33:36] that the law is spiritual
[33:38] but i am carnal sold under sin for that
[33:40] which i would do not
[33:42] for what i would that i would not but
[33:44] what i hate that i do
[33:46] if then i do that which i would not unto
[33:49] the i can send unto the law that it is
[33:51] good
[33:51] now then it is no more i that doeth it
[33:53] but sin that dwelleth in me
[33:55] then the person that wrote this down
[33:56] says this i cannot understand
[34:01] that's honest here's what brother brahma
[34:03] says well
[34:04] they wrote out the scripture that's paul
[34:06] speaking to the romans now
[34:08] let me just kind of polish it up so you
[34:10] can see he said
[34:12] in me is two persons right one wants to
[34:15] do wrong
[34:15] the other wants to do what wants me to
[34:18] do and every time i start to do right
[34:20] then wrong hinders me
[34:22] how many of you people in the interviews
[34:23] this afternoon has run that same thing
[34:25] in this morning
[34:26] same thing i spoke on it this morning
[34:28] temporarily
[34:30] you are an outward man which is
[34:31] controlled by six senses you are an
[34:33] inward man controlled by one sense which
[34:35] is faith and this faith disagrees with
[34:37] all six senses if the sixth sense
[34:39] doesn't agree with faith but one is
[34:41] contrary to the other
[34:42] now as long as the sixth senses agree
[34:44] with faith wonderful
[34:46] but when the six senses disagree with
[34:47] faith then leave the six senses alone
[34:50] now for instance here jesus made a
[34:52] statement a promise the inside man says
[34:54] that's true
[34:55] the outside man reasons that it can't be
[34:58] true to you
[34:59] then ignore the outside man and accept
[35:01] the inside man
[35:04] praise be to god i want to read that
[35:07] again because it's so
[35:08] simple so good
[35:12] he said now i want to read that because
[35:14] it's so good he said now
[35:17] jesus made a statement a promise the
[35:19] inside man says that's true
[35:22] the outside man reasons that it can't be
[35:24] true to you
[35:27] now listen the outside man didn't say it
[35:29] wasn't true
[35:32] [Music]
[35:35] that spirit your mind it doesn't say
[35:37] that what jesus said wasn't true
[35:39] he said it's not true to you
[35:43] that's where the real deception comes in
[35:46] friend it's not that
[35:47] your outer man that carnal nature is not
[35:50] denying the word
[35:51] it's denying the word for you they'll
[35:54] say it's true yeah it's true he's a
[35:56] healer but not this time and not for you
[35:58] and maybe well because you messed up
[35:59] you're under punishment now
[36:04] praise god he said the outside man
[36:08] reasons that it can't be true to you
[36:10] then ignore the outside man and accept
[36:13] the inside man
[36:15] it's so simple we do not have to play
[36:18] around with thoughts amen
[36:20] the devil can put thoughts into our mind
[36:23] amen we do not have to accept them as
[36:25] ours we do not have to identify with
[36:27] them
[36:27] we have every right to reject that
[36:29] thought and say it's not the word
[36:33] but it is the word they said it's true
[36:34] no when you said it's not for me it's
[36:36] not the word because the person of the
[36:38] word has already told me who i am
[36:42] and nothing's going to change that
[36:48] so just ignore the outside man and
[36:49] accept the inside man
[36:51] now that's the same thing that paul's
[36:52] speaking of he was sold under the law to
[36:55] carnal sin
[36:55] every one of us is the same that's the
[36:57] reason we have troubles we do
[36:59] married four or five times and this and
[37:01] that and all kinds of sin and adulteries
[37:03] and everything else along in our lives
[37:04] is because of those things brother
[37:07] brahms just now he's just breaking down
[37:08] every person's life the reason you've
[37:11] got these problems the reason
[37:13] you love god and you want to serve god
[37:15] but you've got these problems is because
[37:16] of that outside man
[37:18] and you haven't learned how to ignore
[37:19] him yet and stick with the inside man
[37:23] we've got all these problems
[37:27] we are carnal and that part must perish
[37:32] but then inside we are a spirit man soul
[37:34] inside and that's faith in god's
[37:36] word then we bring our outside body
[37:38] under subject to the word by faith
[37:40] by accepting what god said
[37:43] now listen if you ever in your own
[37:47] effort
[37:47] try to produce a promise of god you're
[37:50] going to be
[37:50] absolutely mentally and emotionally
[37:53] exhausted you don't produce it you
[37:55] accept it and he produces it
[37:57] you accept it and you stand on it amen
[38:00] how in the world were those slaves
[38:02] coming out of egypt
[38:03] amen coming under a pillar of fire how
[38:05] were they going to have provisions in
[38:06] the wilderness protection in the
[38:08] wilderness
[38:08] how in the world were they going to have
[38:10] water in the desert how were they going
[38:11] to get
[38:12] bread and meat in the desert amen they
[38:15] they couldn't have provided for
[38:16] themselves
[38:17] but god who called them on the journey
[38:19] had already promised to get them to the
[38:21] other side
[38:22] he didn't always explain how amen but if
[38:24] they could just by faith amen like the
[38:27] faith that caleb and joshua had
[38:28] and said if god favor us we're more than
[38:30] able to take the land
[38:33] you know they weren't counting arms they
[38:35] weren't counting tanks and guns
[38:38] and ammunition and sizes of army amen if
[38:40] they were counting they could have never
[38:42] said that amen because they were going
[38:43] against walled cities they were going
[38:45] against giants
[38:46] they were going against battlement and
[38:48] armor men and all kinds of armies amen
[38:50] but they couldn't be
[38:51] counting the outside man had to be laid
[38:54] to rest they had to believe
[38:56] by faith that what god said through that
[38:58] prophet is nothing but the truth
[39:04] we have to do the same thing god has
[39:06] called us on the journey he's called us
[39:08] out of the world he's called us to
[39:10] himself amen we're uniting with him
[39:12] we're moving i'm into the millennium
[39:14] we're on this journey
[39:16] and he's providing everything we need in
[39:18] the journey
[39:19] if we can just trust him and not reason
[39:22] it
[39:23] and not try to produce the word
[39:26] ourselves we can't produce the word we
[39:28] can only believe the word and accept it
[39:35] that's why as soon as we start making
[39:37] measuring sticks for what a believer is
[39:41] we start making people tired and
[39:43] discouraged so don't measure anything
[39:45] just trust god believe god he'll measure
[39:47] you up to what picture he had of you
[39:48] before the foundation of the world
[39:50] he's got to ordain you in the good works
[39:52] say man called you in the good works
[39:53] which he hath ordained before the
[39:55] foundation of the world
[39:56] he knows what you're going to do he
[39:57] knows what's in your life he knows the
[39:59] potential you have and he knows what
[40:00] he's going to extract out of your life
[40:02] you just have to believe him to do it
[40:03] and accept his promises for you
[40:07] and he'll perform the word
[40:11] it goes on to say how can i take a
[40:13] cockle burr and make a grain of wheat
[40:14] out of it
[40:15] it's impossible for me to do it the only
[40:18] way it can be is because
[40:19] inside that cockroach has been
[40:21] transmitted from the cockabur wheat
[40:23] a cockapoo to a germ called wheat life
[40:26] then you bury that cockleburn and it'll
[40:28] produce a grain of wheat that's right
[40:30] because there has been a life of wheat
[40:32] put in the cocklebur
[40:34] and the life of the cocker bar has been
[40:35] taken out but the nature of the
[40:37] cocklebur is still sticky
[40:39] he's talking about you friends not
[40:41] plants
[40:43] the life of the cockroach has been taken
[40:45] out the life of the wheat's been put in
[40:46] but the outside form of the crocodile is
[40:49] still sticky
[40:52] and it will be until this new life has
[40:54] been fully developed out of the ground
[40:56] and raised up again
[40:58] when it comes forth then it's no more
[41:00] cockroach but wheat
[41:01] but wheat but while it's here on the
[41:03] earth and out of the earth
[41:05] and a cockroach is still sticky but it's
[41:07] got the nature on the inside of it
[41:10] of wheat and as long as you're in this
[41:12] life you're going to be sticky
[41:14] and have a carnal nature that's going to
[41:17] bother you as long as you live
[41:21] i'm so glad he said that
[41:26] and as long as you're in this life
[41:27] you're going to be sticky and have a
[41:29] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[41:31] as long as you live
[41:32] but the inside of you you're born again
[41:36] and when you're raised up you're in the
[41:37] likeness of christ and all the sin is
[41:39] gone from you
[41:40] that's the thing that's the thing
[41:43] friends
[41:44] if we could just identify with the
[41:46] inside man and be washed by the water of
[41:48] the word
[41:48] the inside the life on the inside will
[41:51] take dominion over the outside
[41:53] and bring it under control of the word
[41:55] amen but it's got to be his life amen
[41:58] not not our own efforts we yield to him
[42:00] we give him our lives but it's got to be
[42:03] him that does the works
[42:06] in questions and answers from 1961 he
[42:08] says but now
[42:09] if you make a mistake and do something
[42:11] wrong you don't willfully
[42:14] if you're a christian if you're a born
[42:15] again christian you don't mean to do
[42:17] wrong
[42:18] your intentions and everything is right
[42:20] but if you do
[42:21] as she said here make a mistake and do
[42:23] something wrong will god let you just go
[42:25] on and on
[42:26] and die like that and be lost or will he
[42:29] bring you back to reconciliation
[42:31] he will bring you back
[42:34] that's right he will bring you back and
[42:36] then if you do
[42:38] anything wrong it don't condemn you and
[42:40] you go on like that on out remember you
[42:42] wasn't saved at the beginning
[42:44] so if you're able to just do wrong and
[42:46] it don't bother you don't condemn you
[42:48] and you do wrong then you're not even
[42:49] saved at the beginning
[42:51] brother bran is putting this in perfect
[42:52] balance he's not saying you won't do
[42:55] wrong but when you do wrong you hate it
[42:56] you don't want it you
[42:58] you're disgusted by your actions you're
[42:59] troubled by what you did you hate the
[43:01] whole affair and can't wait to make it
[43:03] right
[43:03] amen that is a christian but somebody
[43:06] who will do wrong and just do wrong and
[43:08] keep doing wrong and live doing wrong
[43:10] and not reconcile not make it right
[43:12] amen and not have their conscience
[43:13] bothered by it and remember just assume
[43:15] everything's going to be fine they
[43:16] weren't even saved at the beginning
[43:22] amen that's right you wasn't saved you
[43:24] just had to make believe you wasn't
[43:26] saved but when you
[43:27] you're saved you have a different spirit
[43:29] you're a different nature
[43:30] you're a new creature in christ and the
[43:32] old things has passed away
[43:33] and they are dead and buried in the sea
[43:35] of forgetfulness
[43:36] you see but being you're living here in
[43:39] this world
[43:40] here there's traps set for you
[43:41] everywhere and you're walking with your
[43:44] eyes on christ and remember
[43:46] that when you make a mistake a real
[43:48] christian will always come back quickly
[43:50] for reconciliation so it's not that we
[43:53] never
[43:54] fall we never make a mistake we never
[43:56] fail but there's a life on the inside of
[43:58] us that is not
[43:59] satisfied that way that can't live that
[44:02] way that can't stomach it amen
[44:04] as soon as he makes a mistake a
[44:05] christian will come back for
[44:06] reconciliation quickly
[44:12] brother brahm said in the evening
[44:14] messenger
[44:16] 1963 father practically every hand in
[44:19] here went up for
[44:20] circumcision to be cut away all the
[44:22] surplus that doesn't belong here god
[44:25] help us all i stand right with them lord
[44:27] i'm one of them
[44:28] i'm watching for the coming of that glad
[44:30] millennial day when sin and shame shall
[44:32] be destroyed forever
[44:33] and father while we're in this world we
[44:35] know that we're subject to these things
[44:37] we're subject to mistakes we're subject
[44:39] to sin we're still walking
[44:40] and yet we don't desire to do it and as
[44:43] the bible said
[44:44] faint not when thou art reproved but i
[44:46] pray father that the reproving of the
[44:47] word cuts me just as hard as it cuts the
[44:49] rest of them
[44:51] i read this last three quotes just so
[44:54] you could get the picture that brother
[44:55] branham's painting
[44:56] he is not amen he is not painting the
[44:59] picture
[45:00] that that once you're born again and
[45:02] filled with the holy ghost you live a
[45:03] perfect life and you never fail anymore
[45:05] that's not the picture he's painting but
[45:07] we need a constant washing of the word
[45:10] because of the nature we have
[45:11] because of how we were born and this
[45:13] flesh that we're stuck in we've got to
[45:15] constantly be under the word we have to
[45:17] constantly be washed we have to keep
[45:19] walking in the light because the blood
[45:20] of jesus christ will cleanse us from all
[45:22] sins if we walk in the light as he is in
[45:24] the light
[45:25] and we need that washing and we need
[45:27] that cleansing
[45:32] but i'll tell you this there's no place
[45:34] else to get it
[45:38] there's no place else to get it outside
[45:41] the light
[45:42] of the hour the word for our day
[45:46] amen we're not going to get it in a
[45:48] system we're not going to get it through
[45:49] an effort we're not going to get it
[45:51] the only place that we're going to be
[45:52] able to walk in the light as he is in
[45:54] the light
[45:55] is nowhere he is in the light and it's
[45:57] the light of the message of the hour
[45:59] and if we walk in the light as he's in
[46:00] the light then we have fellowship with
[46:02] one another and the blood of jesus
[46:04] christ will cleanse us from all sins
[46:07] we've got to walk where he's walking so
[46:08] that his word can wash us
[46:15] go to acts 26 i'm just laying down a
[46:18] bunch of pieces but i hope
[46:19] that the holy spirit will help us tie it
[46:21] all together
[46:23] acts 26
[46:28] in verse 15.
[46:38] this is paul on the road to damascus he
[46:40] was saul at this time
[46:43] and the light appeared to him and verse
[46:46] 15 says and he said who art thou lord
[46:48] and he said i am jesus whom now
[46:49] persecute persecute us
[46:52] but rise and stand upon thy feet for i
[46:54] have appeared unto thee for this purpose
[46:56] to make thee a minister and a witness
[46:58] both of these things which thou has seen
[47:00] under those things in which i will
[47:01] appear unto thee delivering thee from
[47:04] the people and from the gentiles and to
[47:05] whom i
[47:06] i send thee to open their eyes and to
[47:09] turn them from darkness to light
[47:10] and from the power of satan unto god
[47:12] that they may receive forgiveness of
[47:14] sins
[47:15] and inheritance among them which are
[47:17] sanctified by faith
[47:18] that is in me paul was sent to the
[47:22] gentiles
[47:23] with the word and when he came with the
[47:27] word
[47:27] the scripture said of paul he was a
[47:30] light unto the gentiles
[47:31] he was the light-bearer he was bringing
[47:33] the light of the word and when he
[47:34] brought the light of the word he brought
[47:36] it to open their eyes to turn them from
[47:38] darkness and to light
[47:39] amen from the power of satan and to god
[47:41] that they may that they
[47:43] may receive forgiveness of sins because
[47:45] they could not receive forgiveness of
[47:48] sins without the word
[47:51] because they had to believe the word
[47:53] amen and they had to believe the word
[47:55] that
[47:55] paul was bringing because that's what
[47:57] the lord said
[48:00] that they might receive forgiveness of
[48:02] sins and inheritance among them which
[48:04] are sanctified
[48:05] by faith that is in me amen by his own
[48:08] faith amen
[48:10] that he put in us they were able to
[48:12] believe the word
[48:13] gentiles were able to believe the word
[48:17] and be saved believe the word and be
[48:20] sanctified
[48:20] believe the word and be filled with the
[48:22] holy ghost
[48:25] now now we're getting down to where i
[48:27] want to get to
[48:28] i like laying down a bunch of pieces so
[48:31] we've got two by fours here and
[48:33] two by six is here so let's start
[48:35] building
[48:36] by the grace of god i want to go to the
[48:39] message of thinking man's filter
[48:42] brother bam says in this message he said
[48:45] also now we want to look at ephesians 5
[48:47] 26
[48:48] said it is the washing of the water by
[48:50] the word
[48:51] a waters of separation what does it do
[48:53] then the filter of god is the word
[48:55] waters of separation washing off the
[48:57] waters of separation by the word
[49:00] god's filter so brother man was going to
[49:02] start talking about
[49:04] we know the message of thinking man's
[49:05] filter he was walking in the woods one
[49:07] day
[49:07] he saw a packet of cigarettes there and
[49:09] the lord told him to go back and pick
[49:11] him up
[49:11] and he wanted to argue with god a little
[49:13] bit
[49:15] he said lord i i i'm not picked that up
[49:18] i
[49:18] i can't smoke i'm against that and the
[49:20] lord impressed him and he went over and
[49:22] he picked it up
[49:22] and on the side it said a thinking man's
[49:25] filter a smoking man's taste
[49:28] and god gave him this sermon off that
[49:30] packet of cigarettes
[49:32] and now he's wanting to talk about god's
[49:34] filter that god has a filter and god's
[49:36] filter is his word it's the word of
[49:37] separation
[49:38] that separates us from sin it says then
[49:41] you can't come into christ through a
[49:43] church filter
[49:44] praise god you cannot come to christ to
[49:48] a church filter you cannot come by a
[49:50] denominational filter or a creed filter
[49:52] there's only one filter that you can
[49:54] enter into that holy place
[49:56] that's through the washing of the water
[49:57] by the word the word of god
[49:59] is a thinking man's filter the church
[50:02] will judge you here whether you're a
[50:04] good member or not
[50:05] they'll give you a good funeral and a
[50:06] half-mast the flag of your death send
[50:08] great wreaths of flowers and do
[50:09] everything for you
[50:10] but when it comes down to your soul
[50:12] facing god it's got to have eternal life
[50:15] and if it's eternal life it's part of
[50:16] the word and as
[50:18] as my own hand cannot deny my hand my
[50:22] eyes cannot deny my hand or my foot or
[50:24] my toe or any part of me
[50:26] they cannot deny it and neither can a
[50:28] man that's part of the word of god or
[50:29] woman deny
[50:30] any part of the word of god then women
[50:33] when you think you can have bobbed hair
[50:35] and come in the presence of god you're
[50:37] wrong
[50:38] you see it you're wrong you can't come
[50:40] through god's filter where you're washed
[50:41] by the water of the word
[50:42] then you enter into the fellowship you
[50:44] think you are but you can't be
[50:46] until you come through the word in every
[50:48] little spot every little word of god
[50:50] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[50:52] every word it's got to come through that
[50:55] filtration coming through
[50:56] and that gives us a righteous man's
[50:58] taste because that's what he's looking
[51:00] for
[51:01] looking for something to cleanse him so
[51:03] a man's looking for something to cleanse
[51:05] him and he says
[51:06] it's this word and when brother man was
[51:08] talking about this
[51:09] uh thinking man's filter he said what a
[51:12] gimmick he said what a
[51:13] why hypocrisy they would take a a
[51:16] cigarette and they know that it's
[51:17] dangerous to man
[51:18] so they'll put a little filter on the
[51:19] back of it and say that it's going to
[51:21] filter out
[51:22] you know bad things or whatever and it's
[51:24] only going to let the taste come through
[51:25] but brother bam said when the taste
[51:27] comes through
[51:27] and the nicotine the tar and it's just a
[51:29] gimmick to sell more cigarettes
[51:32] and he says it's supposed to be
[51:34] filtering out a thinking man
[51:36] a smoking thingy man's filter a smoking
[51:38] man's taste what they're trying to do is
[51:40] just filter out some of the harmful
[51:42] things
[51:43] of the cigarette so that they can still
[51:45] enjoy
[51:46] the nicotine and the tobacco and brother
[51:49] behind takes it right to the church and
[51:51] said the churches have done the exact
[51:53] same thing
[51:53] they've made their own filters so that
[51:55] people can come into the church
[51:57] and draw through a church filter and try
[51:59] to filter out just enough of the bad
[52:01] things of the world
[52:02] where they can still get a little taste
[52:04] of the world and still be safe
[52:09] but they've proven that those filters
[52:10] don't do anything because people get
[52:12] lung cancer by the droves on filtered
[52:14] cigarettes
[52:15] and the same thing's happening in the
[52:16] church amen worldliness is creeping in
[52:18] and they don't have a heart for god
[52:20] amen and they're falling away because
[52:23] they've taken a church filter the church
[52:25] says and the church says and they teach
[52:27] and
[52:29] try why why would they want a church
[52:32] filter because they've got a taste for
[52:34] the world amen
[52:36] why would a man knowing that that
[52:38] cigarette's dangerous why would he
[52:39] choose a cigarette with a filter
[52:41] because he wants the taste of the
[52:43] cigarette but he knows it's dangerous he
[52:45] meant so he's trying to find a
[52:46] compromise
[52:47] that will keep him alive amen and still
[52:49] let him enjoy the thing he's got a taste
[52:52] for
[52:52] and the churches have done the exact
[52:54] same thing and all of them are guilty of
[52:56] it amen
[52:57] they still have a taste for the world
[52:59] and they want us to be
[53:00] safe from eternal damnation so they
[53:03] stuck a church filter a man over top the
[53:05] world
[53:06] and they filtered out we don't do our
[53:07] rate in movies we just do pg-13
[53:12] we don't go to rock and roll concerts
[53:13] that we just brought into the church and
[53:15] change the lyrics amen
[53:16] we you see they put out they put a
[53:19] church filter on it because they love
[53:22] the taste of the world
[53:26] god doesn't care how you dress he's only
[53:28] looking at your heart that's
[53:30] partially true he's interested in your
[53:32] heart i mean you could dress
[53:33] perfect and have a black heart it
[53:35] doesn't mean anything with god but if
[53:36] you've given your heart to the lord
[53:38] you've given your whole self to the lord
[53:41] and the spirit of god is not a filthy
[53:43] spirit and if the spirit of god lives in
[53:45] you
[53:45] the outside of you will reflect the
[53:47] spirit that's on the inside
[53:49] but a church filter will slap a church
[53:52] creed will slap a church creed and
[53:53] filter
[53:54] they'll explain away the word of god and
[53:56] why do people still drove to churches
[53:59] amen why do they why do churches fill up
[54:01] why do mega churches fill up
[54:03] because people know there's a god and
[54:05] they're afraid of hell
[54:11] and so they'll suck through that church
[54:12] filter because they have a taste for the
[54:15] world
[54:18] but god has provided a filter for his
[54:20] children that filter is the word of god
[54:22] and that word of god will not let
[54:24] worldliness through amen
[54:26] it will not let ungodliness through it
[54:28] will not let selfish desire or lust of
[54:30] the flesh or lust of the eye
[54:32] it won't let it through amen the word
[54:34] stops it every time
[54:36] brother said the only thing that will
[54:38] get through the word filter
[54:40] is the holy ghost amen and it depends on
[54:42] what you have a taste for and what
[54:44] you're desiring but if you get a hold of
[54:45] that word and you draw
[54:47] and draw from the word the only thing
[54:49] that's going to come through that
[54:50] revealed word of god is the holy spirit
[54:53] of god amen
[54:54] and if you've got a taste for the spirit
[54:56] of god then you'll draw
[54:57] on the word of god and all
[55:00] selfishness and and all pride and
[55:03] arrogancy and all
[55:04] lust of the flesh and pride of the eye
[55:06] it will all get filtered out by the word
[55:09] because the word won't let it in
[55:14] brother ma'am said the filter of this
[55:16] word is the waters of separation that
[55:18] separate us
[55:20] because we just take the word we believe
[55:24] the word
[55:25] let the holy ghost come through the word
[55:27] and wash out
[55:29] convert change give us the power to
[55:32] bring the outer man
[55:34] subject to the inner man we've got to
[55:37] draw from the right
[55:38] filter why would somebody draw from the
[55:42] word of god
[55:44] because they've got a holy taste
[55:48] they've got a taste for god and they
[55:51] want more of god
[55:53] amen not a taste for the world not a
[55:55] taste for a cigarette
[55:56] but a taste for god and if you've ever
[55:59] had a taste for god
[56:01] of god you just want another taste of
[56:03] god and another taste of god and another
[56:06] taste of god
[56:06] amen if you've got a seed gene of god on
[56:08] the inside and you've ever had a taste
[56:10] of god
[56:10] you're an addict and the moment you
[56:12] first had that contact with god and all
[56:14] you want is another contact with god and
[56:16] another contact with god and another
[56:18] contact with god
[56:20] that's why we come to church sunday and
[56:22] wednesday it's why we fellowship on the
[56:24] word that's why we pick up a message
[56:25] book and read it or play a tape what is
[56:27] it i want i'm drawing through the filter
[56:29] of the word because i want another taste
[56:30] of god
[56:32] i want his spirit his life i'm hungering
[56:35] for it i'm addicted to it
[56:37] amen
[56:40] praise god only the prophet of god can
[56:44] preach a message like that
[56:50] he goes on in thinking man's filter he
[56:52] says see what i mean
[56:54] a filter a thinking man's filter a man
[56:57] that wants to stand in the presence of
[56:58] god
[56:59] what was god's filter his word the day
[57:02] you eat thereof
[57:03] that day you die
[57:06] jesus had a filter in the garden of eden
[57:08] that would filter out sin
[57:11] and that filter was his word and he had
[57:14] a word for them to keep
[57:15] amen and that word listen we gotta
[57:18] we have to keep reminding ourselves that
[57:21] the word is not something secondary to
[57:24] god so we can say the word
[57:27] you know the word and then the god and
[57:28] then the father and the word and
[57:30] but you remember that the word is god
[57:35] and so when god gave them the word he
[57:38] gave them himself
[57:40] and when eve left the word she left god
[57:45] when eve rejected the word for reasoning
[57:48] she rejected god
[57:50] we've got to we've got to understand
[57:52] this and we've got to keep bringing
[57:53] ourselves back to this because then we
[57:54] understand the power of the word
[57:58] what was god's filter his word the day
[58:00] you eat there of the day you die
[58:01] don't care what's happening out there
[58:03] don't you pass that word
[58:04] washed by the waters of the word a
[58:07] thinking man's filter not a denomination
[58:09] not a creed not a church
[58:10] not a cathedral but a thinking man's
[58:12] filter for you're going to be judged by
[58:15] the word
[58:17] further down in thinking man's filter he
[58:19] says
[58:21] and god of heaven may may there not be
[58:23] one of them lost
[58:24] i claim them every one and hold them
[58:26] before them the filter
[58:28] from sin the waters of separation the
[58:31] blood of jesus christ
[58:32] the word made flesh
[58:36] not the word that was the word made
[58:38] flesh
[58:40] god that is the present-day word
[58:43] the waters of separation the blood of
[58:44] jesus christ the word made flesh
[58:46] grant it lord and may the holy spirit
[58:48] pour through every promise into our
[58:50] souls
[58:51] and may we be living representatives of
[58:53] the bride of jesus christ in the time
[58:55] of the eyes of the seeing in the evening
[58:57] light for we present it to you in jesus
[59:00] christ's name amen
[59:02] i love him you believe it if i've said
[59:05] anything wrong by saying thinking man's
[59:07] filter i can't say no more i have no
[59:08] education
[59:09] i just have to say what comes to me and
[59:11] when i seen that laying there i thought
[59:13] what a line of hypocrisy
[59:16] and something said just like the church
[59:22] so that packet saw that that saying
[59:26] a thinking man's filter a smoking man's
[59:28] taste
[59:29] said what a line-up hypocrisy and
[59:31] something said to him
[59:32] just like the church
[59:36] a thinking man's filter oh my there's
[59:38] more than that to it a thinking man
[59:40] wouldn't use it at all see
[59:42] certainly not and it and it desires a
[59:44] smoking man's taste that's right because
[59:46] he's got to have it to satisfy his taste
[59:49] but a real thinking man that knows his
[59:51] soul is going to judgment will filter
[59:53] his taste through the word of god
[59:55] for all the father has given me will
[59:57] come to me and
[59:59] and he'll live by every word that
[1:00:01] proceeds out of the mouth of god which
[1:00:03] is the waters of separation that
[1:00:04] separates us from sin
[1:00:06] for when it comes through the word we
[1:00:08] see that it's sin to disbelieve it
[1:00:10] so we just believe it and go on it's a
[1:00:13] separation from sin
[1:00:16] amen we want to live free from sin but
[1:00:20] we can't do it without the word
[1:00:24] we want to overcome you know there's
[1:00:27] times that
[1:00:28] that that you see people struggling and
[1:00:31] they're struggling because
[1:00:33] they don't fully engage you see
[1:00:35] sometimes people are just
[1:00:36] on the peripheral they don't fully
[1:00:38] engage they don't fully immerse
[1:00:39] themselves
[1:00:40] they don't jump into the message they
[1:00:42] don't jump into a
[1:00:43] into fellowship and into the word and
[1:00:45] when you begin to talk to them they
[1:00:46] start to say things like
[1:00:47] well i'm just trying to work on myself
[1:00:52] you ever heard it i just there's some
[1:00:54] things that i got to get
[1:00:56] right there's some things that i got to
[1:00:57] make right there's some things that when
[1:00:59] i get this straightened out when i get
[1:01:00] this right
[1:01:01] and then you know i want to serve the
[1:01:02] lord but there's some things that i got
[1:01:04] to take care of there's things i got to
[1:01:05] get right
[1:01:06] and all of a sudden you realize you're
[1:01:07] never going to make it amen
[1:01:09] you're never ever ever gonna make it
[1:01:11] with that attitude
[1:01:12] because you're waiting for the strength
[1:01:14] the right set of circumstances
[1:01:16] the mental power or the will to overcome
[1:01:18] this thing in your life and the thing
[1:01:20] that'll overcome it is the life that
[1:01:22] comes through the word
[1:01:24] we have to receive the word and go to
[1:01:26] drawing on that word because what comes
[1:01:28] through the word
[1:01:28] the only thing that'll pass through the
[1:01:30] word is the holy ghost amen
[1:01:32] and we've got to have the life of god
[1:01:33] that comes from the word amen to give us
[1:01:36] overcoming power
[1:01:37] to wash the desire for sin out of our
[1:01:40] lives
[1:01:42] see there's a there's a tug of war many
[1:01:45] times because
[1:01:46] we still have a desire for sin but we
[1:01:47] intellectually recognize that it's
[1:01:49] dangerous for us
[1:01:50] it's not healthy it's not godly it's not
[1:01:52] a good way to be a christian and we want
[1:01:54] to stop it but there's still a desire
[1:01:57] amen we tug of war
[1:01:58] all the time and i say forget the tug of
[1:02:00] war jump into the word and start drawing
[1:02:02] from the word and drawing from the word
[1:02:04] and let god win the tug of war
[1:02:08] let god be the anchor on the back of
[1:02:10] your rope amen
[1:02:11] and pull it all to the other side where
[1:02:13] you lose the desire for sin
[1:02:15] where that thing that used to hold you
[1:02:17] it loses its grip amen for the thing
[1:02:19] that used to trip you up constantly
[1:02:21] it begins to diminish and go away
[1:02:26] many of us have experienced that
[1:02:29] but it wasn't our efforts it wasn't our
[1:02:31] ability there was things in my life
[1:02:32] i could not overcome there was things
[1:02:35] that i hated desperately hated
[1:02:37] i hated every time i tripped up by but i
[1:02:39] could not overcome it
[1:02:40] and you say how did it go away i can't
[1:02:43] tell you
[1:02:43] how it went away all i did was love this
[1:02:46] message
[1:02:47] and it went away i don't even remember
[1:02:50] the day some of these things went away
[1:02:52] there was things that i was delivered
[1:02:54] from there's things that just fell off
[1:02:56] as i walked with the lord
[1:02:57] and i can't tell you the day it fell off
[1:02:59] or where it went or when the desire fell
[1:03:00] away
[1:03:01] all i can do is look back and say it's
[1:03:03] gone
[1:03:05] that temptation used to bind me is gone
[1:03:07] that thing that used to trip me has
[1:03:09] faded away
[1:03:09] the thing that was so powerful and
[1:03:11] pushed me
[1:03:13] is not pushing me anymore what happened
[1:03:15] amen it was the sanctifying power of the
[1:03:18] word amen
[1:03:19] it wasn't willpower it wasn't effort it
[1:03:21] was a faith that this word is god
[1:03:24] and i'm gonna drink from it and drink
[1:03:25] from it and drink from it
[1:03:27] until it changes me
[1:03:30] but in order for that to happen you have
[1:03:32] to believe that this word is god amen
[1:03:34] and if i walk in the light as he is in
[1:03:37] the light then i'll have fellowship with
[1:03:39] the believers and the blood of jesus
[1:03:40] christ will cleanse me from all sin
[1:03:42] you have to believe it friends you don't
[1:03:44] have to understand it you don't have to
[1:03:46] figure it out but you have to believe it
[1:03:53] so many times you'll see somebody will
[1:03:55] be faithful to church faithful to
[1:03:58] fellowship
[1:03:59] faithful to the word and the next thing
[1:04:00] you know they're gone
[1:04:02] where'd they go months years they're
[1:04:04] gone they may come back they may not
[1:04:07] you ask them what happened well i messed
[1:04:09] up
[1:04:11] why didn't you come back to church why
[1:04:14] didn't you get back into the word
[1:04:15] why amen why the only source for you
[1:04:19] overcoming you forsook
[1:04:22] you walked away from the only thing
[1:04:24] which is the living word of god the only
[1:04:26] thing that would have delivered you you
[1:04:27] walked away and you wandered in the
[1:04:28] wilderness much
[1:04:29] longer than you needed to because when
[1:04:31] you mess up and when you fail
[1:04:33] amen all you got to do is repent and cry
[1:04:35] out to god and start drawing on that
[1:04:37] word again because it shows that you
[1:04:38] need something more than what you have
[1:04:45] don't leave fellowship don't leave the
[1:04:46] word don't leave these things just
[1:04:49] because you make a mistake
[1:04:50] my goodness the only place that you're
[1:04:52] going to find deliverance
[1:04:54] is in the word don't leave the word
[1:04:56] don't let the devil discourage you to
[1:04:58] leave the word because then he's got you
[1:05:00] separated from the word and you have
[1:05:02] no power to resist him except your
[1:05:05] willpower
[1:05:07] how's that working
[1:05:13] all you have is your own desire to be
[1:05:15] free how's that working
[1:05:18] how's that worked in the past the only
[1:05:21] thing that'll work is the sanctifying
[1:05:22] power of this word
[1:05:24] to separate us from sin and wash it away
[1:05:26] from us and take all the desire for the
[1:05:28] world out of our heart
[1:05:31] see it's so simple we don't believe it
[1:05:36] you talk to the israelite okay now
[1:05:38] you're delivered you're coming out of
[1:05:40] egypt
[1:05:42] now how are you going to get to the
[1:05:43] promised land
[1:05:45] what's the way i don't know which path
[1:05:48] you take i don't know
[1:05:50] you don't have enough provisions where
[1:05:51] we get provisions i don't know
[1:05:54] how are you going to get from here to
[1:05:55] there how many days will take i'm not
[1:05:56] sure
[1:05:58] where are you going to get water i don't
[1:05:59] know where are you going to get bread
[1:06:02] i'm not sure they had nothing to worry
[1:06:06] about
[1:06:06] amen if they would have just stayed with
[1:06:09] the simple faith
[1:06:10] they believed god when they saw the
[1:06:12] plagues falling on egypt they saw
[1:06:14] all the power of god imparting the red
[1:06:16] sea they believed him but when
[1:06:18] god wasn't doing supernatural mighty
[1:06:20] things before their eyes
[1:06:21] amen they showed that their faith was
[1:06:22] only intellectual faith
[1:06:24] because when the signs and wonders went
[1:06:26] away they didn't believe he would give
[1:06:27] them bread and he didn't believe they
[1:06:29] would give them water
[1:06:30] they believed they would die in the
[1:06:32] wilderness
[1:06:34] that's not faith
[1:06:38] but there was a couple there that
[1:06:39] believed
[1:06:41] and god proved how faithful he was to
[1:06:43] the word because every time they had
[1:06:45] need he met the need
[1:06:48] how will god deliver me from this i
[1:06:49] don't know but he'll deliver me
[1:06:51] how do you know he'll deliver you
[1:06:52] because it's in his word amen this isn't
[1:06:54] his nature amen
[1:06:56] this thing that i'm struggling with it
[1:06:57] isn't the nature of god it isn't in his
[1:06:59] likeness it isn't what he wants it's
[1:07:01] contrary to the word so he has to remove
[1:07:03] it from me
[1:07:03] how do you know how can you be so sure
[1:07:05] because he gave me a personal revelation
[1:07:08] of who he is and who i am
[1:07:09] i'm his bride by revelation and he
[1:07:12] cannot
[1:07:13] amen he cannot let me go on this way
[1:07:18] don't you think you should do this or do
[1:07:19] that or get in a program and
[1:07:21] no i don't think you should do any of
[1:07:22] that i think you should stick with the
[1:07:23] word that's the program
[1:07:25] the program has always been the revealed
[1:07:27] word for your day
[1:07:28] it's always been god's program it always
[1:07:31] will be god's program
[1:07:33] the revealed word for your day that's
[1:07:36] the program
[1:07:38] stick with it it was the thing that led
[1:07:40] them through the wilderness it was what
[1:07:41] provided their bread it's what provided
[1:07:42] their water it's what provided their
[1:07:44] protection
[1:07:45] the revealed word for the day it's what
[1:07:48] provides us
[1:07:48] overcoming power it's what washes us and
[1:07:50] sanctifies us
[1:07:52] is the word let's turn
[1:07:56] to first corinthians chapter six
[1:08:17] it's amazing how
[1:08:20] sometimes i just get amazed at
[1:08:24] things i've said and things that i've
[1:08:26] heard others say
[1:08:28] it's amazing how we can believe
[1:08:32] that god will save our souls and change
[1:08:34] our bodies
[1:08:36] but we don't believe you take away a bad
[1:08:38] habit
[1:08:41] you see how foolish that is how ignorant
[1:08:45] like somehow we believe god has got the
[1:08:48] power to change our atoms
[1:08:52] but he doesn't have the power to change
[1:08:55] my inside my very heart's desire
[1:08:59] the things i want the things i love and
[1:09:00] he can't he can't take the desire for
[1:09:03] the things of the world out of my heart
[1:09:05] see if we can't believe him to take the
[1:09:07] desire for the things out of our heart
[1:09:08] how are we going to believe him for a
[1:09:09] body change
[1:09:11] he's got to be changing us all along
[1:09:13] amen from glory and to glory he has to
[1:09:15] be changing us
[1:09:17] and we have to believe him to have the
[1:09:18] power to change us if we don't believe
[1:09:20] him
[1:09:20] there's nothing he can do for us amen
[1:09:22] brother brennan made it super clear he
[1:09:24] said if jesus christ was standing here
[1:09:25] in this suit i have on now
[1:09:27] he could do no more to heal you he's
[1:09:29] already done it
[1:09:30] you just have to accept it
[1:09:34] he even said in one place he said if
[1:09:36] jesus christ was here and you said lord
[1:09:37] heal me he says i can't
[1:09:40] that's what he said he'll say i can't
[1:09:43] i already have i need
[1:09:47] you to accept it amen the same jesus
[1:09:49] that would go into a village and heal
[1:09:51] all that was sick
[1:09:52] would come into capernaum and because a
[1:09:54] prophet is not without honor in his own
[1:09:56] town
[1:09:57] amen he he could not do many mighty
[1:09:59] works there because of their unbelief
[1:10:03] so god can only change us if we believe
[1:10:07] he can change us
[1:10:13] well what's the mechanism we have to do
[1:10:16] it the way he said
[1:10:17] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:10:22] well that should make us jump up and
[1:10:24] click our heels because we have the most
[1:10:25] powerful revealed word that we've ever
[1:10:27] had that's ever been on the face of
[1:10:29] the gentiles now have the full mystery
[1:10:31] of god in their hands
[1:10:32] amen if he's going to wash me by the
[1:10:34] washing of the water of the word
[1:10:35] i would want to say i declare right now
[1:10:37] before you all it's
[1:10:39] unlimited amen it's not limited
[1:10:42] amen by by a church aged seal still
[1:10:45] being on it all the seals have been
[1:10:46] taking off amen it's not limited by
[1:10:48] a wrong understanding or a wrong
[1:10:50] interpretation of the word it's not
[1:10:52] limited and if the word is the power to
[1:10:54] wash me amen there's a power that's here
[1:10:57] to wash me
[1:11:00] i just have to believe it first
[1:11:02] corinthians 6
[1:11:05] and 9.
[1:11:10] first corinthians 6 and 9 know you not
[1:11:12] that the unrighteous shall not
[1:11:13] inherit the kingdom of god be not
[1:11:16] deceived neither fornicators nor
[1:11:18] adulterers nor
[1:11:19] adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of
[1:11:21] themselves of mankind
[1:11:23] nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards
[1:11:25] nor revilers
[1:11:26] nor extortioners shall inherit the
[1:11:28] kingdom of god
[1:11:30] and such were some of you
[1:11:33] hey none of those people are going to
[1:11:34] inherit the kingdom of god but that's
[1:11:35] what you were
[1:11:37] and none of them will inherit the
[1:11:38] kingdom of god none of them have rights
[1:11:40] to come into the city
[1:11:41] and that's what you were
[1:11:44] all right and such were some of you but
[1:11:47] ye
[1:11:48] are washed amen but you are sanctified
[1:11:51] but you are justified in the name of the
[1:11:53] lord jesus christ
[1:11:54] by the spirit of our god
[1:11:58] brother brown says in the message god's
[1:12:00] power to transform
[1:12:02] he says true predestinated believers
[1:12:05] will stay with the word because they are
[1:12:07] part of that word
[1:12:12] amen all wondering stars how long will
[1:12:16] you wonder
[1:12:17] you methodist baptist presbyterian
[1:12:19] outsiders whatever you might be
[1:12:21] wandering stars from church to church
[1:12:22] from pillar to place and television
[1:12:24] to television world to world why don't
[1:12:27] you come on
[1:12:28] he longs to have fellowship with you
[1:12:31] he is longing for you he wants to
[1:12:35] transform
[1:12:36] you by the renewing of your mind not to
[1:12:39] the church or to the denomination
[1:12:41] but to his word which you are a part of
[1:12:44] which you are a part if that desire is
[1:12:47] in you
[1:12:48] then he goes to a scripture he said
[1:12:49] blessed are they that do hunger and
[1:12:50] thirst for righteousness
[1:12:51] for they shall be filled
[1:12:56] i ask you do you hunger and thirst for
[1:12:57] righteousness is there a longing in you
[1:12:59] to live holy and clean before him
[1:13:02] then you will be filled amen where did
[1:13:04] that longing come from it come from him
[1:13:06] you're part of the word amen you cannot
[1:13:08] deny the word and you long to live all
[1:13:10] the word
[1:13:11] you long to have the manifestation of
[1:13:13] jesus christ in your life
[1:13:16] then you will be filled
[1:13:20] praise be to god he's longing
[1:13:24] to have fellowship his fellowship was
[1:13:27] broken in the garden of eden and he's
[1:13:28] longing
[1:13:29] to have fellowship again and he's made a
[1:13:32] way that we can come back to fellowship
[1:13:35] if we just receive it his way
[1:13:38] you know there's we'll just talk about
[1:13:42] this life this life is difficult
[1:13:47] we come through if if i could just
[1:13:50] if we could just take each person's life
[1:13:53] which we're not going to do
[1:13:54] and begin to explain how they were born
[1:13:57] who their parents were what they came
[1:13:59] through the tragedies that they suffered
[1:14:01] in life the difficulties they had
[1:14:03] it would be shocking in this room people
[1:14:07] who've known what abuse is and neglect
[1:14:09] and abandonment
[1:14:10] they've been hated by parents they've
[1:14:13] been sold all kinds of evil things
[1:14:16] from childhood up they've been in false
[1:14:20] doctrine and false understanding they've
[1:14:22] been indoctrinated wrong
[1:14:23] we've had everything we've come through
[1:14:26] everything
[1:14:28] and you realize that this is satan's
[1:14:32] eden he's come to the pinnacle
[1:14:35] of his eden of his kingdom every wicked
[1:14:38] device is available and every evil thing
[1:14:40] is on the face of the earth hell has
[1:14:42] spilled out onto the earth
[1:14:50] and when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:14:52] god raises a standard
[1:14:57] so many times what we're struggling with
[1:14:59] to serve god
[1:15:01] we're struggling with a mind that has
[1:15:03] been tainted
[1:15:05] by the world we're struggling with a
[1:15:08] spirit realm
[1:15:09] that has been bent and twisted by
[1:15:11] corruption
[1:15:13] by abuse and by neglect and by uh
[1:15:17] uh rape and incest and drug abuse and
[1:15:20] all of these things this is literally
[1:15:22] what people have gone through
[1:15:24] and it twists them in the spirit realm
[1:15:27] and to where
[1:15:28] they think that they want to serve god
[1:15:30] and they're serving god to the best of
[1:15:31] the ability and
[1:15:32] but you know when you talk to them you
[1:15:34] know
[1:15:35] that that things are twisted up inside
[1:15:38] they're not even thinking right
[1:15:43] you try to help people you try to talk
[1:15:46] to people but you realize they're not
[1:15:47] even catching what you're saying
[1:15:48] things are so twisted up in the emotions
[1:15:50] things are so twisted up in the mind
[1:15:52] that there's a skewed view of everything
[1:15:54] around them
[1:15:57] there's people who believe everybody's
[1:15:58] going to cheat them everybody's out to
[1:16:00] get me
[1:16:01] why are they like that because of what's
[1:16:03] happened to them
[1:16:05] and you you go to try to offer help and
[1:16:07] assistance and
[1:16:08] because everything you've said passes
[1:16:10] through this filter of the mind
[1:16:13] then your good intentions are are
[1:16:15] sometimes looked at as evil and you're
[1:16:16] misjudged and misunderstood by what said
[1:16:19] you say one thing and they hear
[1:16:20] something else have you ever been there
[1:16:22] if you've dealt with human beings any
[1:16:24] amount of time you've been there
[1:16:27] and you realize the only thing that's
[1:16:29] going to work is the renewing of the
[1:16:31] mind
[1:16:33] because everything all the reasoning is
[1:16:36] twisted
[1:16:37] you can come with the best reasoning the
[1:16:39] most logical statement
[1:16:40] you can make it a b c d here's here's
[1:16:44] all my evidence and here's my case
[1:16:46] case closed it makes perfect sense and i
[1:16:48] would say it makes perfect sense to you
[1:16:52] but whoever you give it to it's twisted
[1:16:54] up and somehow it's interpreted
[1:16:56] different it's not seen the same way
[1:16:57] amen they don't view things you two
[1:17:00] people hear the same conversation and
[1:17:01] walk away two totally different
[1:17:03] impressions of what was going on
[1:17:06] one person would walk away and say that
[1:17:07] husband and wife they really know each
[1:17:09] other and understand each other they can
[1:17:10] be really honest with each other
[1:17:11] somebody else will walk away and say man
[1:17:12] they're really mad at each other you're
[1:17:13] yelling at each other and it all depends
[1:17:16] on
[1:17:17] your experience
[1:17:20] right and so you can see you can't
[1:17:24] reason
[1:17:24] somebody into the gospel
[1:17:27] you can't give them reasonable evidence
[1:17:30] and reasonable
[1:17:31] proofs and you can't you can't show them
[1:17:33] all the evidence and the proof
[1:17:35] and and you can't talk to them logically
[1:17:37] some people can't even receive it
[1:17:42] so what do we need we need the renewing
[1:17:44] of our minds
[1:17:45] we need the word of god amen to come in
[1:17:48] and begin to fix amen correct
[1:17:51] change what we need was we need to think
[1:17:54] different
[1:17:56] now you tell somebody think different
[1:17:59] you think different okay
[1:18:03] but what we need to do is get so
[1:18:04] immersed in the word and let the word
[1:18:05] wash our thinking
[1:18:07] amen listen to the voice of the prophet
[1:18:09] until we can
[1:18:10] start picking up more than just the
[1:18:12] words we start picking up the spirit
[1:18:13] start picking up the nature
[1:18:15] amen there's more going on than just the
[1:18:18] words amen but the word has a life in it
[1:18:20] the word carries a spirit
[1:18:21] and that spirit is the spirit of christ
[1:18:23] and let the word and
[1:18:24] the washing of the water the word begin
[1:18:26] to wash away
[1:18:27] some of those things that have tainted
[1:18:29] our thinking and some of the wrong
[1:18:30] imagination and some of the
[1:18:32] chips on our shoulders and the hurts
[1:18:34] from the past that cause us to
[1:18:36] be critical amen let's just keep staying
[1:18:38] in that word and let the word wash
[1:18:40] and wash and wash and wash till we can
[1:18:43] be restored by the renewing of our mind
[1:18:49] amen sometimes if we've had a really
[1:18:51] rough life and a really rough
[1:18:53] upbringing and we're constantly in
[1:18:55] contention with the people around us and
[1:18:57] so misunderstood and misunderstood
[1:18:58] everybody what we
[1:19:00] need is a good set of earbuds
[1:19:06] not a counselor not reasoning amen not
[1:19:09] self-help what we need is a good set of
[1:19:12] earbuds
[1:19:13] and we need to wear them out amen
[1:19:16] constantly immerse in the word of god
[1:19:18] get an audio bible get the message of
[1:19:20] the hour stick it in your ears and
[1:19:22] don't take it out until you realize
[1:19:23] something's releasing something's
[1:19:25] changing
[1:19:25] amen i'm understanding different i'm
[1:19:27] thinking different i'm feeling different
[1:19:29] things are beginning to change in me
[1:19:35] why because we're washed by the water of
[1:19:38] the word
[1:19:39] washing out the past wrong thinking the
[1:19:41] wrong concepts the wrong
[1:19:43] doctrines the abuse and the neglect and
[1:19:45] all the things that have happened
[1:19:47] amen let the water of the word wash it
[1:19:49] amen
[1:19:50] and bring us into the mind of christ
[1:19:54] amen we try to reason with people who
[1:19:57] aren't thinking reasonably
[1:20:00] we try to give proof to people who twist
[1:20:03] every proof
[1:20:06] really what you need to say is go listen
[1:20:09] to this
[1:20:11] every day of your life
[1:20:15] all day long and let's talk again in a
[1:20:17] month
[1:20:19] why because the word can correct our
[1:20:21] wrong thinking the word
[1:20:23] and the sp not just the words but the
[1:20:25] spirit of the word and because sometimes
[1:20:26] when somebody is so twisted in their
[1:20:28] mind they don't even understand what
[1:20:30] brother branham's saying it doesn't even
[1:20:31] make sense
[1:20:32] they even take what he's saying and they
[1:20:33] twist it the wrong way when i say
[1:20:35] keep listening keep getting washed
[1:20:37] because there's a spirit that comes with
[1:20:39] that word
[1:20:40] and it is the spirit of christ and let
[1:20:42] that wash and wash and what
[1:20:44] until all of a sudden what he says makes
[1:20:46] sense and now all of a sudden i get it i
[1:20:48] see it
[1:20:48] oh i understand what he's saying now
[1:20:56] that's nothing but the truth friends
[1:20:59] that's the best counseling advice i've
[1:21:01] ever given
[1:21:04] sometimes what we need is just to
[1:21:05] immerse ourselves in the word and cry
[1:21:07] out to god and say god
[1:21:09] i don't think right i don't feel right i
[1:21:11] don't understand right and i gotta have
[1:21:13] you to wash me
[1:21:14] and you said that you would wash your
[1:21:16] bride by the washing of the water of the
[1:21:18] by the word
[1:21:18] and i need to be washed amen i need to
[1:21:21] be renewed in my mind and i can't do it
[1:21:24] by trying to think different i can't do
[1:21:25] it by trying to form different habits
[1:21:27] amen i got to have a power that's
[1:21:29] outside me and it's got to be the power
[1:21:31] of the living word
[1:21:32] [Applause]
[1:21:34] i mean if you're still struggling if it
[1:21:36] still it feels like for you
[1:21:38] you're one step forward one step back
[1:21:39] that you can never really get there that
[1:21:41] you never really progress
[1:21:43] i tell you get a good set of earbuds
[1:21:47] immerse yourself in the word pray spend
[1:21:50] time
[1:21:50] meditation and pray think on the word
[1:21:53] listen to the word
[1:21:54] be immersed in the word because the word
[1:21:56] will wash you and renew your mind
[1:22:00] we've been born in sin shape and
[1:22:02] iniquity
[1:22:03] come into the world speaking lies we
[1:22:06] need to be washed
[1:22:08] by the water of the word things have
[1:22:11] happened of no fault of our own
[1:22:13] things have happened of our own fault
[1:22:16] and it's twisted us all up on the inside
[1:22:19] and there's only one power i know to
[1:22:21] untwist
[1:22:22] and it's the power of the living word
[1:22:26] which is jesus christ manifest today
[1:22:32] throw yourself down in his feet say
[1:22:35] cleanse me lord
[1:22:38] throw yourself down how many wants to
[1:22:40] throw yourself down in his feet and said
[1:22:42] purge me with hyssop and i'll be clean
[1:22:46] wash me and i'll be white as snow i
[1:22:49] can't think right
[1:22:51] i can't feel right i can't reason right
[1:22:53] i can't make a right decision to save my
[1:22:55] life
[1:22:58] but purge me with this up and i'll be
[1:23:00] clean
[1:23:02] you purge me and i'll be clean you wash
[1:23:04] me
[1:23:05] and i'll be white as snow i'm tired of
[1:23:08] trying to work it out i'm trying
[1:23:10] tired of trying to fix it i'm tired of
[1:23:11] trying to overcome my past
[1:23:15] so many people are laboring and striving
[1:23:17] and struggling to overcome their past
[1:23:20] their own mistakes the mistakes of
[1:23:21] others and they're stuck
[1:23:24] you can literally see they're stuck it's
[1:23:26] like they're running in knee deep mud
[1:23:28] they can't get anywhere
[1:23:29] because all the baggage of the past oh
[1:23:32] friends jesus christ knows
[1:23:34] the past amen but he's got a power on
[1:23:36] earth today
[1:23:37] that can free you from all of that he
[1:23:39] can pick you up out of the mighty clay
[1:23:40] he can wash you with his word and he can
[1:23:42] set your feet on a straight path
[1:23:45] but if we neglect the very thing that he
[1:23:47] gave us to give us the victory we're
[1:23:49] going to stay in the muck we're going to
[1:23:51] stay in the mud we're going to keep
[1:23:52] going in circles and we're never going
[1:23:54] to get anywhere
[1:23:56] until we finally begin to doubt that
[1:23:58] there's power in the word
[1:24:02] until we believe that there's no hope
[1:24:04] and no help but i tell you friends there
[1:24:06] there's never been a time there's no
[1:24:08] hope and there's no help for the elect
[1:24:10] of god
[1:24:11] there's never been a time that there's
[1:24:12] not a power that can overcome
[1:24:14] all the power of the devil
[1:24:18] and god has given us if it's the word
[1:24:20] that watches he's given us the word
[1:24:23] in full measure unrestricted and
[1:24:26] unlimited by ideas of man unlimited by
[1:24:29] denominational doctrine he's given us
[1:24:30] the full revelation
[1:24:32] of god amen and i say let's get into it
[1:24:36] with all of our hearts
[1:24:38] and let it correct us

[1:29:47] let's go to hebrews chapter 2.
[1:29:58] i hope the devil is losing ground today
[1:30:01] i hope his tactics are being revealed i
[1:30:04] hope
[1:30:04] his attack plan is being unveiled and i
[1:30:06] hope he's losing ground today
[1:30:11] hebrews chapter 2 verse 10
[1:30:17] for it became him for whom are all
[1:30:20] things and by whom are all things and
[1:30:22] bringing many sons into glory
[1:30:24] to make the captain of their salvation
[1:30:25] perfect through suffering
[1:30:27] for both he that sanctifieth and they
[1:30:30] who are sanctified
[1:30:32] are all of one
[1:30:35] we're going to have to let that soak in
[1:30:38] for he that sanctifieth and those who
[1:30:41] are sanctified
[1:30:43] are all of one
[1:30:46] how do you know it'll sanctify you
[1:30:48] because you come from the same place
[1:30:51] you have the same origin you have the
[1:30:52] same father you've come from the same
[1:30:54] source
[1:30:55] he that does the sanctifying and he
[1:30:56] that's sanctified are
[1:30:58] all of one
[1:31:01] how can he not sanctify you god cannot
[1:31:03] lose himself
[1:31:07] that's why he's promised to do it that's
[1:31:10] why he won't let you go
[1:31:13] both he that sanctify then those who are
[1:31:14] sanctified are all of one
[1:31:16] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[1:31:18] call them
[1:31:19] brethren saying i will declare thy name
[1:31:22] unto my brethren in the midst of the
[1:31:23] church will i sing praises
[1:31:25] unto thee god's not going to lose you
[1:31:30] he that sanctifieth and he that
[1:31:33] sanctified
[1:31:34] are of one whatever he is
[1:31:38] i am whatever that word is that washes
[1:31:41] me
[1:31:42] i'm the same thing i've come from the
[1:31:44] same place
[1:31:46] brother venom says in the invisible
[1:31:48] union of the bride of christ
[1:31:50] said you're standing completely you
[1:31:53] never sinned at the first place
[1:31:55] oh i want to shout within myself that's
[1:31:57] the truth
[1:31:59] that's the truth amen you never sin at
[1:32:02] the first place god don't even know it's
[1:32:04] in the sea of forgetfulness you never
[1:32:05] did it
[1:32:06] you were accused of it by the accuser
[1:32:08] but really from the beginning
[1:32:09] you were predestinated to be a son and
[1:32:12] daughter of god
[1:32:13] you're standing there washed and your
[1:32:14] old book of divorcement is put away
[1:32:16] and it's dead absolutely out of
[1:32:19] existence
[1:32:21] even in the mind of god
[1:32:25] you're the virtuous bride of christ
[1:32:27] washed in the blood of christ
[1:32:29] precious virtuous sinless son of god
[1:32:31] standing with the pure
[1:32:32] unadulterated bride word that he washed
[1:32:35] by the water of his own blood
[1:32:36] that became flesh and manifested that he
[1:32:39] might take
[1:32:40] you which were predestinated in the
[1:32:41] bosom of the father before the beginning
[1:32:44] the same as he was he that sanctifieth
[1:32:47] and he is sanctified or of one
[1:32:50] that he might take you then he might
[1:32:52] receive you take you
[1:32:53] which would predestinate in the bosom of
[1:32:55] the father before the beginning the same
[1:32:57] as he was
[1:32:59] he was that great attribute of god
[1:33:00] called love
[1:33:02] it says your first wedding was annulled
[1:33:05] it was
[1:33:06] you never done it in the first place
[1:33:07] because there's only one thing could do
[1:33:09] it that would be god come down himself
[1:33:11] and took your place
[1:33:13] in a form of the son of god jesus christ
[1:33:15] and washed you by the water
[1:33:17] of the washing of the water by the word
[1:33:19] the word
[1:33:20] not the denomination the word washed you
[1:33:23] but if you won't stand in the water of
[1:33:25] the word how you going to be washed
[1:33:26] you're still as spotted as eve
[1:33:30] listen he sent the word to wash the word
[1:33:33] will wash
[1:33:34] but if you don't stand in the water of
[1:33:37] the word if you don't stay
[1:33:38] put and let the water wash you how are
[1:33:41] you going to be washed you'll be
[1:33:42] just as spotted as eve
[1:33:46] then he quotes a song he says oh dear
[1:33:48] dying lamb thou precious blood shall
[1:33:50] never lose its power till all the ransom
[1:33:52] church of god
[1:33:53] will be saved to sin no more what is sin
[1:33:56] sin is unbelief unbelief in what the
[1:33:58] word unbelief in god which is the word
[1:34:02] pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving
[1:34:04] soon for the skies amen
[1:34:06] standing ready think your garments
[1:34:08] washed by the water of the bleeding word
[1:34:10] the word became blood the word bled for
[1:34:13] you and you are washed in bleeding word
[1:34:15] the word bleeding the life of god in the
[1:34:18] word
[1:34:18] and the word was bled for you and you
[1:34:20] might be washed from the filth of these
[1:34:22] prostitutes and be cleaned
[1:34:24] and sanctified by the washing of the
[1:34:26] water of the word
[1:34:27] and makes your mind and heart stayed on
[1:34:30] god
[1:34:30] and on his word
[1:34:32] [Music]
[1:34:33] he washed you in his word he purified
[1:34:36] you
[1:34:37] by his word to make your mind and heart
[1:34:39] stayed on him
[1:34:41] and stayed on his word why because he
[1:34:44] determined he was going to have a bride
[1:34:47] see eden in eden they were in a
[1:34:50] justified state because they'd never
[1:34:52] done wrong and they believed the word of
[1:34:53] god
[1:34:55] in eden they were pure they were holy
[1:34:58] they were sanctified
[1:35:00] they had the presence of god walking
[1:35:02] with them every day
[1:35:04] they had justification sanctification
[1:35:07] baptism in the holy ghost
[1:35:10] and then eve left the word
[1:35:14] see what ruined what ruined this
[1:35:17] relationship what ruined this position
[1:35:19] with god and his children
[1:35:20] what was it is when she left the word
[1:35:24] and then she went and committed adultery
[1:35:26] but adultery was the attribute of sin
[1:35:27] the sin was unbelief in god's word
[1:35:31] so when she disbelieved god's word she
[1:35:33] sinned and when she sinned she
[1:35:35] had a had an effect in her life and that
[1:35:37] effect was seen as adultery
[1:35:42] so god is trying to put us back in an
[1:35:45] eaten condition
[1:35:48] and to put us back in an even condition
[1:35:50] he has to justify us by faith
[1:35:53] he has to wash us with the washing of
[1:35:54] the water of the word and his presence
[1:35:56] has to come to dwell among us and walk
[1:35:58] with us
[1:36:00] what is god trying to do he's trying to
[1:36:02] put us back in an eaten condition
[1:36:05] what caused us to get out of an eating
[1:36:06] condition leaving the word
[1:36:11] leaving the word left us out of an eaten
[1:36:14] condition
[1:36:15] what will put us back in an even
[1:36:17] condition it's going to have to be the
[1:36:19] word amen
[1:36:20] it was rejection of the word put us out
[1:36:23] it's got to be acceptance of the word
[1:36:24] that puts us back
[1:36:25] in that's why the word is so important
[1:36:28] brother man talks about the word the
[1:36:30] word the word
[1:36:30] and we hear the word the term the word
[1:36:32] so much but you realize
[1:36:34] it's the it's it's god it's the very
[1:36:36] thoughts of god it's the very essence of
[1:36:38] god amen
[1:36:40] and she left god she left the word she
[1:36:43] left the essence and program of god
[1:36:45] when she left the word she left him
[1:36:49] when she left the word she left his
[1:36:50] program when she left him she left his
[1:36:52] thoughts
[1:36:52] when she left him she left his desires
[1:36:56] and now the only way to get back to him
[1:36:58] amen is to accept his word amen
[1:37:01] the word that he presents to us in this
[1:37:02] day is bringing us back to an eden
[1:37:05] condition
[1:37:05] where you can say you never sinned in
[1:37:07] the first place he's taking us back to a
[1:37:10] first place condition
[1:37:12] he's taking us before the fall why she
[1:37:15] rejected the word came to fall
[1:37:16] now we accept the word what word all the
[1:37:19] word
[1:37:22] listen eve when she rejected the word
[1:37:24] she rejected all the word
[1:37:28] say what because she rejected the word
[1:37:33] she rejected the word for her day she
[1:37:35] rejected the manifestation in her hour
[1:37:37] she rejected the word that was given to
[1:37:39] her to keep that day
[1:37:41] when she rejected it she rejected god
[1:37:45] but now when we accept the word that's
[1:37:47] given for us today
[1:37:49] when we accept god as he comes in the
[1:37:51] revealing of his word
[1:37:52] we accept him
[1:37:56] and he declares us righteous sinless
[1:37:59] virtuous as if you've never done it
[1:38:01] putting you
[1:38:02] already in your soul
[1:38:06] in an eaten condition you were trapped
[1:38:09] into it
[1:38:10] it was no fault of your own but you
[1:38:12] proved that by reversing what eve did by
[1:38:14] accepting the word that i bring to
[1:38:16] you in this day amen and rejecting the
[1:38:18] reasoning of the devil and rejecting the
[1:38:20] devil's lies you you are accepting the
[1:38:22] lord you're accepting god and you're
[1:38:24] coming back into that condition that eve
[1:38:26] took us all out of
[1:38:30] i say god thank you for this hour to be
[1:38:32] on this earth
[1:38:34] when i see that when i see the plan of
[1:38:36] god when i see what caused it to go off
[1:38:38] in the beginning
[1:38:38] and i see the plan that god's brought in
[1:38:40] this day to bring us back
[1:38:42] i say i want to draw from that word more
[1:38:44] and more and more and more
[1:38:45] because that's what he's given us in
[1:38:47] this day there's our overcoming power
[1:38:49] there's the life of god on display today
[1:38:53] it's the power to overcome it's his plan
[1:38:55] for this day
[1:38:56] it's his program it's his thought it's
[1:38:58] his essence it's his personality it's
[1:39:00] him
[1:39:02] and we want him
[1:39:06] and the message things that are to be
[1:39:09] he said it's a perfect place calling you
[1:39:11] to that perfection
[1:39:12] and you have to be perfect to get there
[1:39:15] and the bible said so jesus said be
[1:39:17] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:39:19] heaven is perfect
[1:39:21] it's a perfect kingdom so it must be a
[1:39:23] perfect people come
[1:39:24] because you have to stand and be married
[1:39:25] to a perfect son of god and you must be
[1:39:28] a perfect bride
[1:39:32] i'm glad he didn't stop there he's got
[1:39:35] some more things to say
[1:39:38] so how can you do it through anything
[1:39:40] else but the perfect
[1:39:41] word of god which is the waters of
[1:39:45] separation that washes us from our sins
[1:39:48] amen that's right the blood of jesus
[1:39:49] christ think of it the dripping bloody
[1:39:51] word
[1:39:52] in the blood the word of god bleeding
[1:39:54] blood to wash the bride in
[1:39:56] yes sir she stands perfect virgin
[1:39:59] unadulterated she never sinned in the
[1:40:02] first place amen she was trapped into it
[1:40:05] and i say that's for me
[1:40:09] that's my portion that's my law in life
[1:40:11] amen i may still be stuck in a cocker
[1:40:13] bore shell
[1:40:14] amen there's still be it may be a sticky
[1:40:16] nature that sometimes will get tripped
[1:40:17] up and sometimes this and
[1:40:19] wrong signals in my understanding but
[1:40:21] down on the inside of me that's who i am
[1:40:23] that's my condition
[1:40:24] that's what he promised me and that's
[1:40:26] what he's doing in this day
[1:40:28] and i say amen

[1:40:34] bride of jesus
[1:40:35] amen how can you say that
[1:40:38] amen how can you say that when you fail
[1:40:40] how can you say that when you make
[1:40:41] mistakes how can you say that with the
[1:40:43] doubts that are in your mind
[1:40:44] i say it because he said it i said it
[1:40:46] because he would do it
[1:40:47] i say it because he said that he was
[1:40:49] going to take me from the heathen he was
[1:40:51] going to bring me into my land he was
[1:40:53] going to put a new heart in me he was
[1:40:54] going to put his spirit in me

[1:40:57] his judgment and he was going to dwell
[1:40:59] with me and i was going to dwell with
[1:41:00] him

[1:48:38] i should
[1:48:52] [Music]
[1:48:59] well god bless you all um
[1:49:02] tell you a little bit what happened here
[1:49:04] uh spencer called me on friday
[1:49:06] and uh he wanted to talk he said he had
[1:49:09] some questions about
[1:49:10] this message and brother brahman we got
[1:49:13] together yesterday at cracker barrel we
[1:49:15] just
[1:49:15] started to talk and as we began to talk
[1:49:19] you know lots of questions and you uh
[1:49:22] after a while i i just asked spencer i
[1:49:24] said spencer i
[1:49:25] i even have lots of questions still i
[1:49:27] says but the question is do you believe
[1:49:29] what you're hearing to be the truth
[1:49:31] and spencer said yeah i do i do believe
[1:49:33] it's the truth
[1:49:34] and as we began to talk he said he
[1:49:36] expressed in his heart over the last
[1:49:38] year that he
[1:49:39] has wanted to be baptized multiple times
[1:49:42] he said but i just have too many things
[1:49:44] in my life i'm not ready to
[1:49:46] i can't come and approach him like that
[1:49:48] until these things are dealt with
[1:49:49] and i i began to tell him i says oh
[1:49:51] buddy i says
[1:49:53] you're approaching it the wrong way and
[1:49:55] brother bob baptized me about 11 years
[1:49:57] ago
[1:49:58] and most people don't know when i
[1:50:00] stepped into this pool i still had a
[1:50:02] refrigerator full of beer back in my
[1:50:03] garage and i hadn't done anything with
[1:50:05] it yet
[1:50:06] i had lots of things in my life i was
[1:50:08] still bound up with that i couldn't free
[1:50:10] myself from but all i knew was i
[1:50:12] believed what i was hearing was the
[1:50:13] truth
[1:50:14] and i wanted to take that first step and
[1:50:16] commit my life to the lord
[1:50:18] and let him do what he wanted to do with
[1:50:19] it so spencer's come the same way
[1:50:22] he believes what he heard is the truth
[1:50:24] and with all his heart he wants god to
[1:50:26] lead him from this point on
[1:50:28] so he knows that that first step is
[1:50:29] water baptism in the name of the lord
[1:50:31] jesus christ
[1:50:32] so that's what brings us here today so
[1:50:36] spencer quite a service for today huh
[1:50:39] god really confirmed the things we spoke
[1:50:41] about so
[1:50:43] i'm gonna baptize you and you just hold
[1:50:46] right here
[1:50:47] i think hold your nose are you okay with
[1:50:49] that okay he's kind of big for the pool
[1:50:51] so i told him
[1:50:52] this is going to be tough so
[1:50:55] let's just bow our heads for our word of
[1:50:57] prayer
[1:50:59] grace is heavenly father we come before
