[0:00] how many of you been healed by the word
[0:01] amen
[0:03] healing is never left but neither has
[0:05] prophesying or discernment left amen
[0:07] because everything that was in the
[0:09] firstborn second pole is in the third
[0:11] pool because it's the fullness of the
[0:13] word it's the full person of the word
[0:15] amen who heals you Jesus Christ heals
[0:18] you and he's the third pull he's the
[0:20] opening of the word he's the one who's
[0:22] here
[0:25] amen
[0:27] who was Discerning the thoughts and
[0:29] thoughts and hearts of the people
[0:31] was brother Branham Discerning their
[0:33] thoughts and heart or was it God
[0:34] Discerning their thoughts in their
[0:36] hearts
[0:38] how many times amen under the preaching
[0:41] of the word in this day is your thoughts
[0:43] and your heart and your conversations
[0:44] being discerned
[0:47] I had a brother to tell me from
[0:48] Wednesday night that there was an
[0:50] absolute manifestation of discernment of
[0:52] conversation word for word going on I
[0:55] had no clue it wasn't me doing any
[0:57] discernment I don't have a gift of
[0:59] discernment but the person of the word
[1:02] is present and with him is every Power
[1:04] and promise that's in the word and every
[1:07] manifestation is here that's why we want
[1:09] the third pull we want the word we want
[1:11] the person of the word I don't want to
[1:13] stop at a first pull and get super
[1:15] excited and enthused about that I want
[1:17] to go all the way to unite with the
[1:20] person of the word because with him it's
[1:22] first pull second pull with him is every
[1:24] promise with him is the Fulfillment of
[1:26] every word and with him is every Miracle
[1:28] amen every Miracle that's ever been
[1:30] worked is in him every Power that's ever
[1:32] been manifest is in him I want to go all
[1:34] the way to him
[1:38] that's why to me it's the most important
[1:40] thing in the world is to get people all
[1:41] the way in amen and how to bring them
[1:44] the revelation of the word present tense
[1:45] for our day and not something a
[1:48] Pentecostal can preach and not something
[1:49] a Pentecostal can do but something
[1:51] that's beyond that amen something
[1:53] that'll hook the rainbow trout and once
[1:55] they're hooked they're coming in friends
[1:57] once they see this word once they come
[2:00] in contact with the reality of the word
[2:02] in this day it doesn't matter they're
[2:04] coming all the way in because they were
[2:06] hooked by the third pool
[2:08] got a hold of the fish how are they
[2:11] going to miss the Rapture they're hooked
[2:12] to it amen how are they not going to
[2:14] land in the boat they're hooked to it
[2:16] how were they hooked they were hooked by
[2:18] the opening of the word in this day that
[2:20] the revelation of the seven Thunders and
[2:22] the Mystery of God has been opened
[2:25] that's why we preach every day that's
[2:27] the emphasis of our life that's
[2:29] everything to us because in that is
[2:32] everything
