[0:00] God tells him whatever you speak he see
[0:03] brother Bam tells us this is different
[0:04] than when Moses manifest that because
[0:07] when Moses manifested God said go speak
[0:09] flies and he went and repeated what God
[0:11] said but now God told him you speak and
[0:13] now brother Benham had to decide what he
[0:16] wanted to say and where he wanted the
[0:18] squirrels to come from and where they
[0:19] would be and what limb he would shoot
[0:20] them off of.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; And God honored his words and created
[0:25] the squirrels and it happened exactly
[0:28] like that man said. Y
[0:32] &gt;&gt; why? Because that's what Adam lost.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:38] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus Christ came and
[0:40] manifest that he restored.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; But he didn't just restore it for
[0:44] himself. He restored it for the whole
[0:46] family.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; And that's what this prophet's life came
[0:49] to tell us that this has come for the
[0:52] whole family. Jesus was virgin born.
[0:54] Jesus was sinless. You and I were born
[0:57] wrong. We were born in sin, shaped in
[0:59] iniquity, come to the world speaking
[1:00] life, needed redemption, needed
[1:02] salvation, needed repentance, and are
[1:03] messing up all the time, every day. But
[1:06] he come back to show, listen, God didn't
[1:08] even bring a perfect man up and have
[1:10] that perfect man become the sign to the
[1:12] age. He brought a man out of poverty
[1:13] with limited education, couldn't
[1:15] pronounce all his own words, and would
[1:16] make a whole load of mistakes publicly
[1:19] and tell us about lying to a lawyer and
[1:22] getting his feelings hurt and having the
[1:23] blues and trying to run away from his
[1:25] ministry. Why? Because God doesn't need
[1:28] perfect people. He needs somebody that
[1:30] will obey his voice. He needs somebody
[1:32] he can correct. Somebody that'll stay in
[1:34] his hands. And when they get diverted,
[1:35] he can bring them back. And when they
[1:37] have a wrong thought, he can correct
[1:38] them. And when they lie, he can convict
[1:40] them. And they'll respond to it. God's
[1:42] showing us through that prophet that
[1:44] this is for you and I. It's not just for
[1:47] him. It's for us. What God's bringing
[1:49] back is what was lost in the Garden of
[1:51] Eden. And God wants to bring it back in
[1:54] the second fold of his three-fold
[1:55] purpose. and manifested in a bride upon
[1:58] the earth at the end time. And that
[2:00] manifestation will take us in a rapture
[2:04] &gt;&gt; because after that manifestation, it'll
[2:06] be time for the millennium. That's
[2:08] right.
