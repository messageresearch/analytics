TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in the third seal brother says John said everybody in heaven everybody beneath the Earth everybody heard him where is this this is in this is in uh Revelation chapter 5 when the lamb takes the book amen he starts rejoicing everybody in heaven everything beneath the Earth everything heard him praising God about it John must have found his name on there you [Music] know why he saw the lamb take the book when the lamb take the book listen this is happening in Vision amen at this point the book is still sealed he hasn't even opened the seals yet that comes in Revelation chap 6 my brother brandom says John must have found his name on there you know the question is the book wasn't even open yet if it was open was it open to the page where John could look and see and then if he wrote John in there what kind of ink did he use and what kind of language did he write it in you understand John's in the vision he sees the lamb come forth he's weeping because he know all redemptions lost if nobody can take this book now an elder comes and tells him weep not for the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and overcome the take the book and the loose the seals thereof and he steps forward a bloody lamp he takes the book they all start rejoicing the Angels pour out the prayers and incense of the Saints amen and John starts shouting and rejoicing and praising God Amen brother B says why he must have found his name on there the question is how did he find his name on there he doesn't take the little book and eat it till you get get to Revelations chap 10 when the mighty Angel comes down friends this is just brother Chad you can take it or leave it but I believe it was a spiritual Revelation to John not something he was reading on paper but he was recognizing I'm part of that Redemption my name is on that book and he caught it by Revelation that John's in there and it may not be pronounced John it may not be spelled and John's name wasn't even John like we say John now probably had a he Brew or Armenian name and it was spelled with characters maybe we don't understand it doesn't matter that doesn't matter that's only for this Earthly existence but we have another identification that's not the name on your birth certificate and that's the C Gene of God that was in the back part of his [Music] mind and John must have looked and found his name in there
