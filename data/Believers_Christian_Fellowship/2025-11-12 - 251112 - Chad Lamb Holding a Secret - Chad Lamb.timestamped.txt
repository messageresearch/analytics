[0:00] There's a country far beyond the starry
[0:03] sky.
[0:05] Oh, there's a city where there never
[0:08] comes a night.
[0:11] And if we're faithful, we should go
[0:13] there by and by.
[0:16] Oh, it's that city where the lamb is
[0:20] alive.
[0:22] Oh, in that city where the land is
[0:25] alive.
[0:28] In that city where there cometh no
[0:31] night.
[0:33] Oh, I have a mansion over there and is
[0:36] free from toil and care. I am going
[0:40] where the land is alive.
[0:44] And here we have our days of sunshine.
[0:47] But we know
[0:49] oh that the sun which shines upon us now
[0:52] so bright
[0:55] it will be changed to clouds and rain
[0:57] until we go.
[1:00] Oh in that city where the land is the
[1:04] light. Oh that next verse and there the
[1:06] flowers bloom forever and the day
[1:11] shall be one eternal day without a
[1:14] night.
[1:16] And our tears shall be forever wiped
[1:20] away.
[1:22] Oh, in that city where the land is the
[1:25] light.
[1:27] Oh, in that city where the land is
[1:31] alive.
[1:33] In that city where there come no night.
[1:38] Well, I have a mansion over there. It's
[1:41] free from toil and care. I'm going where
[1:45] the land is alive.
[1:49] Oh, here we have our disappointments
[1:52] all the while.
[1:54] And then fondest hopes but meet with
[1:57] bitter blood.
[2:00] And though we weep, the morning brings a
[2:03] smile.
[2:05] Oh, in that city where the lamb is. Oh,
[2:09] let sunlight fade. And that sunlight
[2:12] fade. Let twilight bring it through.
[2:16] Oh, not a shadow can my blissful sh of
[2:19] bright.
[2:21] Oh, for I know that up in heaven there
[2:24] is room.
[2:26] In that city where the lamb is alive.
[2:32] Oh, in that city where the lamb is
[2:35] alive.
[2:37] Oh, in that city where there cometh no
[2:41] night.
[2:42] Well, I have a mansion over there. It's
[2:46] free from toil and care. I'm going where
[2:50] the lamb is alive.
[2:53] Amen. I'm going where the lamb is the
[2:55] light. We are so
[3:00] blessed
[3:02] by the gifts from your hand.
[3:06] Oh, I just can't understand
[3:12] how you loved us so much. We are so
[3:20] so blessed.
[3:22] We just can't find a way
[3:27] or the words that can say.
[3:32] Thank you, Lord, for your touch. When
[3:37] we're empty,
[3:40] you fill us
[3:43] till we overflow.
[3:47] When we're hungry,
[3:51] you feed us
[3:53] and cause us to know
[4:00] we are so
[4:04] blessed.
[4:06] Take what we have to bring.
[4:11] Take it all. everything.
[4:16] Lord, we give you so when we're empty,
[4:21] when we're empty,
[4:25] you feed us
[4:27] till we overflow.
[4:31] When we're hungry,
[4:35] you feed us
[4:38] and cause us to know
[4:44] we are so
[4:47] so blessed.
[4:50] Oh, take what we have to bring.
[4:55] Take it all, everything.
[5:00] Lord, we love you so much.
[5:06] Amen. As brother Chad comes, singing.
[5:08] There's a fountain. There is a fountain
[5:13] open in the house
[5:17] of David.
[5:19] you
[5:21] who
[5:23] believe.
[5:26] And there are streams of grace flowing
[5:32] down
[5:33] from Calary
[5:36] on
[5:38] now and
[5:40] receive
[5:43] for I will take you from the nations.
[5:48] I'll bring you to your own land and I'll
[5:52] be sanctified
[5:54] in you
[5:57] before the eyes of man and a new heart
[6:03] will I give you and I'll place my spirit
[6:07] within.
[6:09] I'll sprinkle clean water on you and
[6:14] save you from your sins.
[6:19] And there's a fountain
[6:22] open in the house
[6:26] of David
[6:28] to
[6:30] prove.
[6:35] And there are streams of grace that's
[6:40] flowing down from Calary.
[6:45] come now and
[6:48] receive.
[6:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our heads
[6:54] together this evening.
[6:57] Dear heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we
[7:00] come once again, Lord, with gratitude in
[7:03] our hearts because you saw fit to gather
[7:05] us once more. And God, this meeting is
[7:08] not in vain. It's not without purpose.
[7:10] for you've ordained it for this hour and
[7:13] you've given us the privilege of being
[7:15] here now. Lord, we want the full benefit
[7:17] from this opportunity you've given us.
[7:20] May it not be just another Wednesday
[7:22] night, but may it be now, Lord. The
[7:24] opportunity we have now, the chance we
[7:26] have to worship you now, to receive your
[7:28] word now, to say amen now. And God, may
[7:31] we all take advantage of the opportunity
[7:33] we have, Lord. And may we give you first
[7:36] place now. May we set you at the head of
[7:38] the table and invite you, Lord, to break
[7:40] the bread. And may we feed from your
[7:42] hand, Lord. And God, may you accomplish
[7:44] your purpose this evening. For we're
[7:46] thankful, Lord, and grateful to be here
[7:48] for your mercies in our life, for your
[7:50] grace that abounds unto us, Lord. And
[7:52] God, may we just open our hearts and
[7:54] receive from you that portion you have
[7:56] for this hour. God, I pray you take this
[7:59] vessel of mine under your control. May
[8:01] you give me strength, Lord. May you an
[8:03] your anointing rest upon this flesh. May
[8:06] all the words that are spoken, Lord, be
[8:07] truth and be life, Lord. And may they
[8:09] bring about your purpose in our hearts
[8:12] and our lives. We ask that you would do
[8:14] it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[8:18] Amen. God bless you all this evening.
[8:20] While you're standing, if you could just
[8:21] take your Bibles with me and turn to the
[8:24] book of Genesis, Genesis 38. Thank you,
[8:26] musicians.
[8:28] Amen. And uh I I got word from brother
[8:31] Andreas ring and he said he made it home
[8:33] safely and he asked me to give you all
[8:34] his warm greetings. So greetings from
[8:36] brother Andreas. Also I wanted to remind
[8:39] you that brother Jason Dears will be
[8:40] coming in this weekend. He'll be
[8:42] ministering for us this Sunday morning
[8:44] and then he'll also take the youth
[8:45] meeting in the afternoon. So remember to
[8:48] be praying for him as well. And
[8:50] throughout the service you can just keep
[8:52] me in prayer. I've had a lot of pain
[8:53] today. It's been uh getting worse. I got
[8:56] something wrong with the with my jaw on
[8:58] the back part of my jaw and it gets more
[9:00] and more painful. But you know what? I
[9:02] don't care. I'm going to preach anyhow.
[9:05] Amen. So, just pull on the gift and just
[9:07] pray. And Amen. We're not going to let
[9:09] the devil have an easy victory. Amen. We
[9:11] I' I'd rather preach the gospel in pain
[9:14] than not preach it. Amen. So, God bless
[9:17] you all this evening. Let's look here at
[9:19] Genesis chapter 38
[9:22] verse 11.
[9:27] 38 Genesis 38:1
[9:31] Then said Judah to Tamar his
[9:33] daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow at thy
[9:36] father's house till Sheila my son be
[9:38] grown. For he said, lest per adventure
[9:41] he die also as his brethren did." And
[9:44] Tamar went and dwelt in her father's
[9:46] house. Amen. God bless you as you have
[9:49] your seats. And may the Lord bless us as
[9:51] we look into his word.
[9:54] Amen. We know the story of Judah and
[9:56] Tamar. And Tamar was a woman that Judah
[10:00] had taken to be wife for his eldest son.
[10:03] And before that, she could conceive, the
[10:05] eldest son was wicked in the eyes of the
[10:08] Lord. And he was killed by the Lord. He
[10:10] was taken. And so she was taken then and
[10:13] given to the second son. And the second
[10:15] son refused to give her seed to raise up
[10:17] seed for his brother. And the Lord was
[10:19] displeased with him. And he was smitten.
[10:21] But then the third son of Judah was too
[10:24] young to marry at that time. So this is
[10:26] the instructions that he gave her to go
[10:28] back to her father's house. And and
[10:30] Judah is a little shy about giving his
[10:33] next son. He's given he's given this
[10:35] woman to two sons and the two sons are
[10:37] dead and now he's got the third and he's
[10:39] trying to protect his heritage, his
[10:41] prosperity here and he doesn't want to
[10:42] lose the third. So he sends her back and
[10:45] tell uh uh Sheila uh my son be grown. He
[10:49] says, "For he said, lest per adventure
[10:51] he die also." So, you can see this move
[10:54] that he's making is a hedging move. He's
[10:56] trying to protect something. Amen. That
[10:58] he doesn't want to lose. And so, he
[10:59] sends her back to her father's house.
[11:01] And then, let's go to uh verse 13.
[11:05] And it was told Tamar, saying, "Behold,
[11:07] thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnoth to
[11:10] shear his sheep. and she put her widow's
[11:12] garments off from her and covered her
[11:15] with a veil and wrapped herself and sat
[11:18] in an open place which is by the way to
[11:20] Timnath. For she saw that Sheila was
[11:23] grown and she was not given unto him to
[11:25] wife. So I want you to see the reason
[11:27] that Tamar makes the move she's about to
[11:30] make is because she sees that that what
[11:32] was promised her is not going to happen.
[11:34] That Sheila is of age and now he's grown
[11:37] and she is not given to him to wife.
[11:39] Amen. And so now she's going to take uh
[11:42] uh some action here. Verse 15. When
[11:45] Judah saw her, he thought her to be a
[11:47] harlot because she had covered her face.
[11:51] And and he turned into her by the way,
[11:53] and said, "Go to I pray thee, let me
[11:55] come in unto thee, for I know not," he
[11:58] knew not that she was his
[11:59] daughter-in-law. And she said, "What
[12:01] willil thou give me that thou mayest
[12:02] come in unto me?" And he said, "I will
[12:04] send thee a kid from the flock." And she
[12:06] said, "Wilt thou give me a pledge till
[12:08] thou send him?" And he said, "What
[12:11] pledge shall I give thee?" And she said,
[12:12] "Thy signate and thy bracelets and thy
[12:15] staff that is in thy hand." So now she's
[12:18] going and she's playing the part of a
[12:20] harlot. It's it's interesting to note
[12:22] she's not a harlot.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; She's not a harlot. This woman is not a
[12:27] harlot. She's playing the part of the
[12:28] harlot. Amen. Because her right to seed,
[12:31] to bring forth seed has been held,
[12:33] withheld from her. Sheila should have
[12:36] been given to her so that she can raise
[12:38] up seed to their first dead husband.
[12:40] Amen. But now he's refusing this right
[12:42] that she has. And so now she puts off
[12:44] her widow garment. She puts on the the
[12:46] the the attire of a harlot. She goes and
[12:49] sits in the place and she intercepts
[12:51] Judah coming along and they work out
[12:53] this deal where where they agree to the
[12:55] terms and the terms is a kid. But she
[12:57] said, "Will you give me a pledge, a
[12:59] guarantee, something that promises that
[13:01] you'll give me the payment?" And he
[13:03] says, he asked her, "What is it you
[13:05] want?"
[13:06] &gt;&gt; And she said, "I'll take thy signate
[13:08] ring and I'll take thy bracelets and
[13:11] I'll take thy staff." That was her
[13:13] choice. Amen. And he said, "Okay."
[13:17] So, let's go down to verse 24 together.
[13:20] And it came to pass about 3 months after
[13:23] that it was told Judas, saying, Tamar,
[13:25] thy daughter-in-law, hath played the
[13:27] harlot, and also, behold, she is with
[13:29] child by whoredom. And Judah said,
[13:32] "Bring her forth and let her be burnt."
[13:34] I want you to look at this in 24.
[13:37] They've already passed judgment on her.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; They've already declared her a harlot.
[13:42] They've already said she's gone into
[13:44] whoredom. And he already pronounces a
[13:46] judgment upon her that she's to be
[13:48] burnt. Now, that's not an improper
[13:50] judgment if she truly played the part of
[13:53] a harlot and was in the whoredom. Amen.
[13:56] But she did nothing wrong. Amen. Let's
[13:59] look here at verse 25. And when she was
[14:02] brought forth, she sent to her
[14:04] father-in-law, saying, "By the man whose
[14:07] these are am I with child." And she
[14:10] said, "Discern, I pray thee, whose are
[14:12] these, the signate and bracelets and
[14:16] staff."
[14:18] Listen, I want you to note, she didn't
[14:20] say, "I'm innocent and it's you."
[14:24] No, she was not one passing judgment.
[14:26] She had no judgment to pass. All she
[14:29] said is, "The man whom I'm pregnant by
[14:32] owns these items. These items belong to
[14:35] him. Now you discern whose items they
[14:38] are." She never took the place of the
[14:40] judge. She's not telling anybody what to
[14:42] do or not to do. All she's SAYING IS,
[14:45] "THIS CHILD that's in me came from the
[14:47] man whose items these are. You discern
[14:49] who they are." And then Joseph said, and
[14:51] Judah says in verse 26, and Judah
[14:54] acknowledged them and said, "She hath
[14:56] been more righteous than I because that
[14:59] I gave her not to Sheila, my son, and
[15:01] who and knew her again no more." So now
[15:04] the judge who judged her a harlot and
[15:07] whoredom to be burnt now passes a
[15:09] different judgment. The one who
[15:11] condemned her, Amen. Whoever brought the
[15:14] report was condemning her already
[15:15] accusing her of being a harlot and and
[15:18] being in whoredom. And he pronounced
[15:19] judgment off the testimony. Amen. And
[15:22] said she'll be burnt. Now the judge,
[15:24] Amen. When he sees the tokens, the items
[15:27] that she has from the man, he says,
[15:30] "She's more righteous than me.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; SHE BECAME MORE RIGHTEOUS than the judge
[15:34] because the judge had judged
[15:36] inappropriately." Amen. Before the time.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I looked at this, I I looked
[15:41] up these items, the signant, the
[15:44] bracelet, and the staff. And I looked at
[15:46] these some time ago, if you'll remember,
[15:48] we looked at them. But the signant is
[15:51] the signant ring or a signant seal. And
[15:54] this seal is a this seal is a true
[15:57] identification. It was a seal that would
[15:59] be used to seal official documents,
[16:01] letters, and any other documents. It was
[16:03] it would have been Judah's signature.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; They would have done put put some
[16:08] bullion down or some clay or bullion.
[16:10] Later became wax. And they would imprint
[16:12] it with this seal. He could either wear
[16:13] it as a ring or wear it around his neck
[16:15] as a seal and he would seal that and
[16:17] that seal was custom engraved and it
[16:20] would only pertain to Judah. This was
[16:22] his signature.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; So she had his seal and then she had
[16:27] what's called bracelets here in the King
[16:30] James. And I looked this up because it's
[16:31] always it's been a bit of a puzzle to me
[16:33] what this is. And in in many other
[16:36] versions of the Bible it's called cord.
[16:39] A cord or cords. It's translated cord or
[16:42] thread and it comes from the word to
[16:44] twist or that which is twisted. So, this
[16:46] is some sort of cord. This is some sort
[16:48] of twisted cord or item. And I I looked
[16:52] up an article today out of the biblical
[16:54] archaeology magazine and they believe
[16:57] that it was the cord that actually
[16:58] fastened the signate to Judah that that
[17:01] that was fastened him. But there's
[17:03] others with other ideas. I combed
[17:05] through the message and I could not find
[17:06] what brother Brennham said on it. He may
[17:08] have I may have missed it. Amen. But but
[17:10] that's what it is. It's not like dangly
[17:12] bracelets like we're thinking of. It's
[17:14] some sort of cord that was a fashion and
[17:16] it would have pertained to Judah. It was
[17:19] something that was significant and
[17:21] something that was individual to him.
[17:24] Amen. And it may have been the very
[17:26] thing that bound the seal, the thing
[17:27] that that the seal was fastened on. And
[17:30] then when we look at the staff, we know
[17:32] what the staff is, but the staff is a is
[17:35] is like a shepherd's staff. Uh but it
[17:38] also symbolizes a tribe. And this staff
[17:41] for Judah was not just a stick. Amen. It
[17:45] was also a symbol of him as the leader
[17:47] of the tribe of Judah. It was it was his
[17:51] uh authority, his rulership. And it was
[17:53] his signature staff that would have
[17:56] identified him. It wouldn't have been a
[17:57] generic stick. It would have been his
[17:59] staff that people would have known was
[18:01] that's Judah's staff. And it's the staff
[18:03] of the tribe of Judah.
[18:05] &gt;&gt; Because he's the head of the tribe of
[18:06] Judah. So now with these items, Amen.
[18:10] There's a reason she asked for these
[18:11] things.
[18:13] &gt;&gt; She didn't ask for gold. She didn't ask
[18:14] for silver because she was not a harlot.
[18:17] She did not want money. She did not want
[18:19] payment. She did not want the kid. Amen.
[18:22] Because as soon as he left, she got up,
[18:24] took off of her garments OF A HARLOT,
[18:26] PUT back on her garments of a widow, and
[18:28] went back to her father's house like
[18:30] nothing had happened. She didn't want
[18:31] payment. Amen. She wanted the
[18:33] righteousness of what she was deserving,
[18:36] what she needed. Amen. Was the seed, the
[18:38] promised seed. And when the son was
[18:40] refused to her, SHE WENT BACK TO THE
[18:43] ORIGINAL SEEDGIVER,
[18:45] &gt;&gt; which was Judah. So she could, there was
[18:47] no other son, THIS SON WAS WITHHELD. BUT
[18:49] SHE HAD A RIGHT TO that because she was
[18:51] the wife of the firstborn. And because
[18:53] she was wife of the firstborn, when she
[18:56] had the right to bring forth the lineage
[18:58] of Judah, AND WHEN JUDAH HIMSELF IN HIS
[19:01] UNRIGHTEOUSNESS refused her cuz he was
[19:03] trying to save something. Amen. He was
[19:06] getting out of the program of God. But
[19:07] Tamar was getting him back in the
[19:09] program of God
[19:13] &gt;&gt; because she was not, Listen, this was
[19:15] not an act of lust on Tamar's part.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; Tamar wasn't desiring an illicit
[19:20] relationship. She wasn't looking for
[19:22] payment. What she was looking for was
[19:25] her right to bring forth the son to
[19:27] continue the lineage of Judah. And when
[19:30] she even through deception, amen, she,
[19:33] Amen, became the one to receive the
[19:35] seed, what seed did she get? AMEN.
[19:38] COULDN'T PRODUCE IT. On couldn't produce
[19:40] it. Sheila was kept from him. SO SHE
[19:42] GOES BACK to the father and gets the
[19:44] seed originally. AND SHE BRINGS FORTH
[19:47] THE HEIR TO JUDAH. AMEN.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; SHE BRINGS FORTH THE ONE WHO WILL BECOME
[19:53] THE head of the tribe of Judah.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, all of these types are absolutely so
[20:00] beautiful, friend.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; When we when we can pull up the
[20:04] PowerPoint, uh now I I wanted the title
[20:07] holding a secret. This is a thought that
[20:09] was perplexing me last night and uh
[20:12] again this morning. So, this is kind of
[20:14] coming fresh. I had something else on my
[20:16] mind. But you know, who cares about our
[20:19] mind?
[20:20] &gt;&gt; We want the mind of Christ.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when I when I was looking at
[20:24] this Tamar when she had done what she
[20:29] did and went back to her father's house
[20:32] and put on the garments of a widow, she
[20:35] had in her possession this seal and this
[20:38] cord, this bracelet and this staff that
[20:42] was all uh uh that was all identified as
[20:46] Judah's
[20:47] Judah's signature, Judah's cord, uh
[20:50] Judah's staff,
[20:52] and and she held in her possession a
[20:56] secret.
[20:58] And that secret would be the secret that
[21:01] would justify her actions.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; What she did looked wrong. What she did
[21:07] looked risky. She took a chance.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; And it was a chance. What if she was
[21:12] discovered? What if Judah found out?
[21:14] What What if What if he lifted her veil?
[21:17] What? She took A CHANCE. SHE BUT
[21:19] something was motivating her. Something
[21:21] was moving her. And friends, I believe
[21:23] it was something more than even
[21:25] something natural inside of her. Amen.
[21:27] Because God was using her to preserve
[21:29] the line of Judah. But he was also using
[21:32] her to show what his bride would be in
[21:34] the last time. Amen. Because this woman
[21:36] had the right to receive the seed. And
[21:39] there's going to be a bride that's got
[21:40] the right to receive the seed.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; And although it looked wrong and many
[21:46] people began to judge Tamar and Tamar
[21:48] was considered a harlot. Amen. She was
[21:50] considered an ill-famed woman in her
[21:52] father's house. No doubt her father was
[21:54] ashamed of her. Her mother was probably
[21:56] ashamed of her. If she had siblings,
[21:58] they were ashamed of her. Who knows what
[22:00] kind of ridicule she had to endure at
[22:02] the time that they found out that she
[22:04] was with child. And we know what their
[22:06] assessment was because that's the
[22:08] message that came back to Judah. And all
[22:10] this time she has to endure all of these
[22:12] things in her ears. You're a harlot.
[22:14] What have you done? Wait till they find
[22:16] out. YOU'RE GOING TO BE JUDGED. You're
[22:18] going to be burnt. BUT THE ENTIRE TIME
[22:20] SHE'S GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING IN HER
[22:21] POCKET. SHE'S GOT A LITTLE STAFF UNDER
[22:23] HER BED. She's got something TO DECLARE,
[22:26] I'M NOT A HARLOT. I WAS NOT WHOREDOM.
[22:29] AMEN. IT WAS MY RIGHTS. AMEN. TO BRING
[22:32] FORTH THE PROMISED SON.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; IT WAS HER POSITION GIVEN TO HER BY GOD.
[22:37] IT WAS HER RIGHT. AMEN. AND SHE WASN'T
[22:39] an ill-fained woman. And she wasn't of
[22:41] bad reputation. AND SHE WASN'T AFTER A
[22:44] lustful relationship. Yeah.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; And the evidence of that was the secret
[22:48] that she held
[22:50] &gt;&gt; and nobody else knew about, but she held
[22:52] it. Amen. How could she endure such
[22:57] ridicule and mocking and shame?
[23:01] I mean, we have no record. She fought
[23:03] back. You know, they were saying,
[23:04] "You're a hard." She's not saying,
[23:05] "Uh-uh. No, I'm not."
[23:09] &gt;&gt; Because no one would believe her.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. She's not getting into verbal
[23:15] dialogue back and forth because she is
[23:18] holding in her possession a secret
[23:23] &gt;&gt; and she has to wait for the right time
[23:26] for the right person to be a witness to
[23:28] her secret.
[23:30] She could take out the signate ring
[23:32] early. She could take out the cord
[23:34] early. She could take out and she could
[23:36] say th look at this. Look at what I got.
[23:39] This is from Judah. Hey, listen. They
[23:42] probably would disbelieve her and say,
[23:43] "Where'd you buy that? You bought that
[23:45] out of a trinket shop. You just picked
[23:46] up a piece of wood. You carve something
[23:48] on it." Hey, listen. She wasn't looking
[23:50] to any of them to justify her. She was
[23:53] going back to the original seedgiver,
[23:55] the one she had got the seed from. Amen.
[23:57] And when she was going to be in
[23:59] judgment, amen. She laid out these items
[24:02] now to the one that gave them, the one
[24:04] that they belong to, to the originator
[24:06] of these items. And when she laid them
[24:08] out, she said, "I'm pregnant by the man
[24:10] who owns these. You discern and you tell
[24:13] me." And immediately said, "She's more
[24:16] righteous than I am."
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, friends, we've got a secret. We've
[24:21] got some trinkets that the father has
[24:23] given to us. The one who's planted the
[24:25] seed has given you something.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; And we hold it in secret, friends.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't do ANY GOOD, AMEN. TO try
[24:35] to prove it to anybody else. Proving it
[24:38] to anybody else won't prove anything.
[24:40] People will still deny it. You can say,
[24:41] "Well, I got the Holy Ghost because I
[24:43] did XYZ." They said, "No, that was just
[24:45] emotion." Or, "No, that was just this or
[24:47] that was just that." It doesn't MATTER
[24:48] WHAT ANYBODY ELSE thinks of us. It
[24:51] doesn't matter what anybody else thinks
[24:52] of you. AMEN. YOU TAKE THAT signate
[24:55] ring, the seal, which is the Holy Ghost,
[24:57] AND YOU SHOW IT BACK TO THE PERSON WHO
[25:00] GAVE IT. AMEN. AMEN.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; That's the only ONE WHO CAN JUDGE
[25:04] WHETHER it's the correct seal or not.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; Nobody else can judge. So there's no
[25:10] reason to try to prove it to anybody
[25:12] else. No matter what ANYBODY ELSE SAYS,
[25:14] YOU just keep the secret in your pocket
[25:18] &gt;&gt; and you stand whatever comes your way.
[25:21] Amen. Because of the secret that's
[25:23] within you, the secret that you hold in
[25:25] your possession. what you know to be
[25:27] real and what you know to be true and
[25:29] what you know to be in YOUR POSSESSION.
[25:31] AMEN. THAT'S THE THING that gives you
[25:33] the strength to endure whatever anybody
[25:36] throws your way.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; TAMAR, IT WASN'T HER STRENGTH. IT WASN'T
[25:40] HER WISDOM. IT WASN'T HER ARGUMENTS.
[25:42] AMEN. It was the secret that she was
[25:44] holding.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; That's what gave her the strength to
[25:47] press on.
[25:49] The Bible says in Ephesians, "In whom
[25:51] you also trusted after you heard the
[25:53] word of truth, the gospel of your
[25:55] salvation, in whom also after that you
[25:57] believed, you were sealed with that holy
[26:00] spirit of promise, which is the earnest
[26:03] of our inheritance until the redemption
[26:05] of the purchased possession unto the
[26:07] praise of his glory."
[26:10] This is the seal that's been given to
[26:12] us. When we come into union with Christ,
[26:15] it is the seal that he gave us until
[26:19] uh is the earnest of our inheritance
[26:21] until the redemption of the purchased
[26:22] possession until everything is restored.
[26:27] In this quote, brother said, "And what
[26:28] is the seal of God?" Ephesians 4:30
[26:30] says, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[26:32] God, whereby you are sealed until the
[26:34] day of your redemption, not from one
[26:36] revival to another, but eternally sealed
[26:39] until the day that you're redeemed
[26:41] back." Amen. It's this seal that
[26:44] declares you righteous. This is the seal
[26:46] that brings you back to your position.
[26:48] And you get to hold this token. Brother
[26:51] Brennham called it a token. Amen. It was
[26:53] evidence that God gave to you. A token
[26:56] evidence that your fair has been paid.
[26:58] When he saw your faith in his word, he
[27:00] gave you the token as a seal to
[27:02] recognize. Amen. That you believed
[27:05] because Amen. because we believe unto
[27:07] salvation.
[27:10] But when we believe, then he gave us a
[27:12] seal. That's what he did to Abraham.
[27:14] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[27:16] unto him for righteousness. He was
[27:17] declared righteous. And God gave him a
[27:19] seal of circumcision to seal his faith.
[27:23] When we believe the word of God, God
[27:25] gives us a seal. God gives us a token.
[27:27] And that token is in your possession.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Now listen, don't try to prove it to
[27:33] another soul. Nobody else will believe
[27:36] you.
[27:38] They may believe you, but it doesn't
[27:39] matter how many people you convince or
[27:41] how many people are not convinced. I
[27:44] want to I just want to go on the record
[27:45] saying if you hold this seal, you're not
[27:48] a harlot.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; You're not involved in whoredoms. You're
[27:53] as RIGHTEOUS AS THE JUDGE IS RIGHTEOUS,
[27:55] YOU'VE NOT DONE anything wrong.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE SINLESS, SPOTLESS, VIRTUOUS
[28:00] BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. ALTHOUGH PEOPLE
[28:02] MAY NOT understand your life and THEY
[28:04] MAY MISJUDGE WHY YOU do what you do.
[28:06] Amen. They may make mistaken comments
[28:08] about you're a religious zealot and
[28:10] you're a this and you're following AFTER
[28:12] THAT AND YOU'VE GOT this the THE GOSPEL
[28:14] ALL WRONG. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY
[28:17] SAY. I CAN'T PROVE anything to them. But
[28:20] the one who gave me the seal is the one
[28:22] who will identify that seal.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; And he gave it to me because I believed
[28:28] his word.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; He gave it to me because I've come into
[28:31] union with him. Amen. And he's given me
[28:34] that.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:36] Praise God. Let's look at this seal for
[28:38] just a minute. In Romans 8:15, he says,
[28:41] "For you have not received the spirit of
[28:43] bondage again to fear." So that seal
[28:46] does not bring you into fear.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Or into bondage.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; But you have received the spirit of
[28:53] adoption whereby you cry, "Aba, Father."
[28:57] So this seal, amen, brings us uh it's
[29:01] the spirit of adoption which brings us
[29:02] into the understanding of the family
[29:05] that we belong to and who our father
[29:06] truly is. And listen, and the spirit
[29:10] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[29:13] that we are the children of God. So what
[29:16] is this token doing inside of me? this
[29:19] token of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[29:21] that God has given to me as a seal. That
[29:24] signate ring I got from from Christ.
[29:27] Amen. That seal that I've got, his
[29:29] spirit dwelling in me. Amen. That spirit
[29:34] beareth witness with my spirit
[29:38] &gt;&gt; that I am the son of God.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, it's not what somebody
[29:44] else told me or convinced me or keeps
[29:47] trying to convince me through preaching.
[29:49] Amen. It is something that the spirit
[29:52] that I've received, the token I've
[29:54] received is witnessing with the spirit
[29:56] that's in me and letting me know I am a
[29:59] child of God.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; It's a witness within me. Amen. That's
[30:03] witnessing with my desires, my faith,
[30:06] what I believe with. And the Holy Ghost
[30:08] is anointing that. Amen. And it's it's A
[30:10] RECOGNITION TOGETHER. I AM A son of God.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; And also in Romans 5 it says, "And hope
[30:18] maketh not ashamed because the love of
[30:21] God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
[30:23] Holy Ghost which is given unto us." So
[30:26] that seal given to me also is the love
[30:30] of God shed abroad in my heart by the
[30:32] Holy Ghost. It brings such a love, the
[30:36] love of God, the love of God for me and
[30:38] my love back to him. And so this seal
[30:41] that I've received, this token, this
[30:43] signate that I've got, amen, it is
[30:46] bearing witness within me that I'm the
[30:48] son of God and brings the very love of
[30:50] God shed abroad in my heart and brings
[30:52] me into a love relationship with God.
[30:55] Amen. Where nobody else understands.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Nobody else knows the secret that's in
[31:01] my heart. That's right.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Only him by the Holy Ghost. And that
[31:04] love was shed abroad by the Holy Ghost.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; So that brings me
[31:11] into an understanding
[31:14] of who I am and his love for me and my
[31:18] love for him.
[31:21] Man, I want to look now at the staff
[31:23] since I don't quite understand the cord
[31:26] other than something that binds the
[31:28] signate ring. It's a binding agent. But
[31:32] let's look at the staff now. Brother Von
[31:34] says some interesting things and why it
[31:35] had to be shepherds from December of
[31:38] 1964.
[31:39] He said, "What did he do by that
[31:41] shepherd staff?" Not a textbook, not a
[31:44] theologian's idea, but a shepherd staff.
[31:47] We're coming to it in a minute. A
[31:48] shepherd's staff. He did it. Not a
[31:50] denominational prayer book, but a
[31:52] shepherd's staff. shepherd's rod guiding
[31:55] his sheep, making the way clear as they
[31:57] went towards the promised word in the
[31:59] land. What a beautiful thing that it is
[32:01] today of the shepherd staff today,
[32:03] guiding his sheep to the promised land,
[32:05] bypassing all theology and everything
[32:07] else of this world and the things of the
[32:10] world and denominations and everything,
[32:12] opening up the way and proving his word
[32:14] to be the truth. The shepherd staff
[32:17] going ahead and notice the same shepherd
[32:21] staff that was guiding the sheep. Do you
[32:22] believe that he certainly did guide the
[32:25] sheep? He delivered them out of Egypt
[32:26] with that staff in his hand. We could
[32:28] say much more about it, but to hit the
[32:30] highlight, he guided the sheep and sent
[32:32] judgment upon the rejecting of him. The
[32:35] same staff that became a blessing to one
[32:37] became a curse to the others. The same
[32:39] waters of Noah's preaching that saved
[32:41] him condemned the world. The same staff
[32:43] that led Israel to the promised land
[32:45] condemned those who refused to follow
[32:46] the prophet shepherd. That's right.
[32:48] Become a stick of judgment. Further on
[32:51] in the same message he says also
[32:53] Israel's future offered and there where
[32:57] I I spoke of Israel now in the future
[32:59] there they were offered deliverance from
[33:02] bondage of death by a prophet shepherd
[33:04] they were brought out of bondage by a
[33:06] prophet shepherd with a staff see it was
[33:09] speaking of Israel's future delivered
[33:10] from death and held by a shepherd
[33:13] prophet that we speak of now all now to
[33:16] all all as as we know Israel did not
[33:20] receive the prophet shepherd 's word.
[33:21] All of Israel did not receive it. Now
[33:23] notice they was complaining, oh when we
[33:26] was performing the miracles, he was a
[33:27] great fellow. But when it come to his
[33:29] message, that was different.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; So the staff, amen, that Moses had, we
[33:34] know Moses had a regular staff, but
[33:36] brother Benham's taking it in type now.
[33:38] Amen. That the message brother that
[33:40] Moses brought, Amen. That message
[33:41] through a prophet messenger, a prophet
[33:44] shepherd was leading them back to the
[33:46] promised land, to the promised word. And
[33:48] when Jesus came, he was the prophet
[33:50] shepherd. Amen. Brother Bam said, "With
[33:51] a staff,
[33:52] &gt;&gt; but we didn't see a stick in his hand
[33:54] physically." Amen. But he had a STAFF
[33:56] AND THAT STAFF was the message he was
[33:58] preaching. They could accept the
[34:00] miracles, but they couldn't accept the
[34:01] message. And the message was leading
[34:03] them on.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God today has given us a staff
[34:07] to lead us. AMEN. THROUGH A PROPHET
[34:10] SHEPHERD IN THE END TIME, A SON of man
[34:12] revealing the son of man, the same
[34:14] shepherd that was rejected in Judea and
[34:17] in Samaria and in Jerusalem 2,000 years
[34:19] ago. The same one came, the great
[34:22] prophet shepherd through another
[34:23] prophet. Amen. And he was leading us by
[34:26] the message of the hour into the
[34:28] promised land.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what was he? HE WAS THE LION
[34:32] OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH. WHAT STAFF DOES
[34:35] HE HAVE? HE'S THE HEAD OF JUDAH. HE'S
[34:37] THE KING OF THE TRIBES. AMEN. HE'S THE
[34:39] king of Israel and the line lineage of
[34:41] Judah. SO WHAT IS THAT STAFF? AMEN. IT'S
[34:44] THE WORD THAT'S here to guide us AND
[34:47] LEAD US ALL THE way home, friends. Amen.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; We have a signant ring
[35:01] &gt;&gt; and we have a staff.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Have you received the message?
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Have you received the staff of the
[35:09] shepherd prophet, the the the the
[35:11] message, the word that's leading us
[35:13] along? Have you received it? Is it
[35:15] inside of you? Have you taken into your
[35:17] inner chamber? Is it a secret that
[35:19] you're holding inside of you?
[35:22] Oh, then you have a signate ring and you
[35:24] have a staff.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, it doesn't matter what other people
[35:31] think about you.
[35:34] It doesn't matter what other people say
[35:36] about you.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your vindication are the tokens
[35:41] that you hold in your heart.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And where did you get them? Where
[35:47] did you get this message? Listen, we
[35:48] didn't get this message from William
[35:49] Brandham. We got this message from Jesus
[35:52] Christ.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Where did you get your token? That token
[35:55] didn't come, Amen. just through from a
[35:57] preacher somewhere or a church. That
[35:58] token came from Christ.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; He's the one who has impregnated us.
[36:03] He's the one who's come in union with
[36:05] us. He's the one who's given us these
[36:07] tokens and we receive them from his
[36:09] hand. Why? Cuz we didn't want money.
[36:11] We're not a harlot. We didn't want a
[36:13] lustful nothing. What we wanted was
[36:15] redemption. the word, the truth, a
[36:17] restoration. The same thing Tamar was
[36:19] hungering for. She may not have
[36:21] understood the hunger. I believe there
[36:23] was a spiritual hunger driving her, but
[36:25] friends, there's a spiritual hunger
[36:27] driving us to this word and to this
[36:29] token.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; AND ANYTIME SOMEBODY BECOMES DRIVEN BY
[36:34] THE SPIRIT OF GOD, THEY BECOME AN
[36:36] ANOMALY. THEY BECOME AN OUTCAST. THEY
[36:38] BECOME SOMETHING STRANGE to the world.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; They're willing to do STRANGE THINGS.
[36:42] TAMAR WAS WILLING to do something very
[36:44] strange. Amen. IN ORDER TO BE PART OF
[36:46] THE REDEMPTION PLAN, to be part of the
[36:48] word coming forth.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; She was willing TO DO SOMETHING SO
[36:53] UNUSUAL. AMEN. BECAUSE SHE WAS DRIVEN BY
[36:56] A FORCE. SHE HAD TO PLAY THE PART. SHE
[36:59] HAD TO RECEIVE THE SEED. SHE HAD TO
[37:01] BRING FORTH AND AND PRESERVE the lineage
[37:03] of Judah. It was more than the THOUGHTS
[37:06] OF A WOMAN. AMEN. IT WAS THE VERY
[37:08] THOUGHTS OF GOD THAT WERE DRIVING HER.
[37:10] AND FRIENDS, YOU AND I ARE driven by
[37:12] more than just our own desires and our
[37:14] own thoughts. There's a SEED GENE OF GOD
[37:16] INSIDE OF YOU PROGRAMMED TO REACH OUT
[37:18] FOR THIS SIGNANT RING, TO REACH OUT FOR
[37:20] THIS LORD JESUS CHRIST AND SAY, "I'VE
[37:23] GOT TO HAVE THE SEED AND PLANTED IN ME.
[37:25] I'VE GOT TO COME INTO UNION WITH HIM.
[37:27] I'M HERE." AMEN. TO BRING FORTH THE
[37:30] PROMISED SON
[37:33] &gt;&gt; OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; I'M ON THIS EARTH. AMEN. IT'S FOR ME TO
[37:39] DO.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; It's for ME TO BRING FORTH THE SON of
[37:44] man again.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:48] AND IN THE PROCESS, I don't want money.
[37:53] I don't want fame. I don't want
[37:55] prestige. I don't want I don't want
[37:57] nothing.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; All I want is to bring forth Christ.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:05] And when I came to Christ, he gave me a
[38:07] seal
[38:09] &gt;&gt; and he gave me a staff, the message of
[38:11] the hour. And I hold them as treasures
[38:14] in my heart. Are they a treasure to you?
[38:20] &gt;&gt; They're a treasure. And all of Tamar's
[38:22] trouble. No. It may have gotten
[38:26] difficult, friends. She may have heard a
[38:28] lot of things and she may have the
[38:29] accusations may have got pretty rough
[38:31] and her own family may have got pretty
[38:33] raw with her and but when she went back
[38:36] to her room at night and she pulled back
[38:38] the covers and she saw that staff there.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; She reached down and she held the
[38:43] signate ring she knew all is well.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; All is well.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Man, life may not be easy.
[38:53] We may get all kinds of situations in
[38:56] life that are discouraging and
[38:58] disruptive and we may have people pass
[39:00] judgments upon us and misunderstand us
[39:03] and our actions and and our desires.
[39:06] But when you can go back to your prayer
[39:08] closet and you and you dig down deep and
[39:10] that love of God is still shed abroad in
[39:13] your heart by the Holy Ghost and this
[39:15] message still means more to you than
[39:17] anything and it's still the guiding
[39:18] thing that's guiding you to the promised
[39:20] land. Amen. You can recognize I have his
[39:23] staff and I have his ring and
[39:25] everything's all right with me.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; I know what's alive inside of me and
[39:30] it's alive by the one who gave me this
[39:33] Holy Ghost and who gave me this message.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:38] And look here at Ruth in Ruth chapter 3.
[39:41] We know the story of Ruth, the Moabitis
[39:43] woman who comes back with Naomi. Her
[39:45] husband is dead. Amen. There's no hope
[39:47] for her. Naomi even tells her, "There's
[39:49] no hope for you. You're not going to get
[39:51] another husband from me. There's going
[39:53] to be no redemption of your land, no
[39:56] redemption of you because the redemption
[39:58] rights would go to another son. And
[40:00] another son would come in unto her and
[40:02] raise up another seed to replace her
[40:04] dead husband. But Naomi says, "What are
[40:06] you going to do? Wait till I get married
[40:07] and bring forth another son and wait 20
[40:09] years till you can listen. You're
[40:11] finished."
[40:13] And and Ruth said, "It doesn't matter to
[40:16] me. I just want to be where you're at."
[40:18] Amen. and your people will be my people
[40:20] and your God will be my God and where
[40:21] you go I'll go and where you die I'll
[40:23] die and she pledged her allegiance Naomi
[40:25] and went Amen went back into uh uh
[40:29] Bethlehem
[40:31] &gt;&gt; back into Israel and while she's there
[40:34] she's gleaning and she's trying to
[40:36] survive and she's barely scratching out
[40:38] a living just going around following
[40:40] after the gleaners picking up a little
[40:42] bit of barley a little bit of grain that
[40:45] she could go out and thresh back at home
[40:47] and have a little bit of bread TO EAT.
[40:49] THAT'S NOT ENOUGH to get through the
[40:50] winter. That's not enough to survive.
[40:52] That's just enough to make it from day
[40:54] to day. That's
[40:55] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; But Naomi said to her one time, she
[40:58] said, "Guess, you know, you know, Ruth,
[41:00] I want to do something for you. Here's
[41:02] what you got to do. You've got to go to
[41:04] the Lord of the harvest. You've got to
[41:06] go to the kinsman redeemer, and you've
[41:08] got to lay your life down at his feet.
[41:10] And if you give yourself to him, he'll
[41:13] take care of you."
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so she SAYS, "ALL THAT YOU
[41:18] SAID, NAOMI, that I'll do." AND SHE
[41:20] PREPARED HERSELF. AND SHE GOT READY AND
[41:22] she went to the threshing floor
[41:24] according to what Naomi told her. And
[41:25] she goes down there at night. And after
[41:28] Boaz had drank, and after he had ate,
[41:29] and after his heart was Mary, he went
[41:32] and laid himself down. And she snuck in
[41:36] to the threshing floor where a woman
[41:38] wasn't supposed to be at a time she
[41:41] wasn't supposed to be there. And she
[41:43] slipped in under the cover of darkness.
[41:45] and she lay down at his feet. And that's
[41:48] where we pick it up in verse 14. And she
[41:50] lay at his feet until the morning. And
[41:52] she rose up before one could know
[41:54] another. And he said, "Let it not be
[41:56] known that a woman came in into the
[41:58] floor. Keep this a secret.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Keep it a secret. This doesn't look
[42:05] good."
[42:08] Also, he said, "Bring the veil that thou
[42:10] hast upon thee and hold it." And when
[42:12] she held it, she measured, he measured
[42:15] six measures of barley and laid it on
[42:16] her. And she went into the city. And
[42:19] when she came to her mother-in-law, she
[42:21] said, "Who art thou, my daughter?" And
[42:23] she told her all that the man had hath
[42:24] done to her. And she said, "These six
[42:27] measures of barley gave he me, for he
[42:29] said to me, go not empty unto thy
[42:31] mother-in-law." Then said she, "Sit
[42:34] still, my daughter, until thou know how
[42:36] the matter will fall. For the man will
[42:38] not be in rest until he have finished
[42:40] the thing this day.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; He gave her a promise that he was going
[42:45] to go to the judgment seat,
[42:48] &gt;&gt; the gate of the city, the judgment seat.
[42:51] He said, "There's another kinsman near."
[42:53] Amen. If he'll do the ride of
[42:55] redemption, he can do it. If not, I'll
[42:57] redeem you. Amen. And brother Brandham
[43:00] said, "Amen. That next to kidman, that
[43:02] closer one, he said that was the devil."
[43:05] Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; And when he begins to lay out, you know,
[43:09] the at THE JUDGMENT SEAT, HE'S ALREADY
[43:13] PROMISED HER, I'LL do my part.
[43:16] And he gave her a token.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Six measures of barley. And he sent her
[43:21] with a token. And the token was
[43:23] evidence, amen, that he was the Lord of
[43:27] the harvest. He was the redeemer. He was
[43:29] going to feed her. He was going to care
[43:31] for her. But it was six. It's an
[43:33] incomplete number. seven because he
[43:35] himself is going to be the seventh
[43:37] portion. He's going to sew the seventh
[43:39] portion of seed and that seed is going
[43:41] to be a redeemer that's sewed into her
[43:43] womb.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Not six SHE CAN CARRY LIKE THE SIX SEALS
[43:47] you can read. But the seventh seal, the
[43:49] mystery, amen, the ve the one that's
[43:51] veiled and hidden. He's going to become
[43:54] that seventh seal to her. And then the
[43:56] seventh seal, the seventh measure of
[43:58] seed is going to be swed into her and
[44:00] she's going to be carrying amen.
[44:02] redeemer, the Lord of the harvest within
[44:04] her.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Boaz sends her and when when
[44:09] when Naomi hears all that she says and
[44:11] Naomi sees the token and she says,
[44:13] "Listen, sit still.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; You've done all that you needed to do.
[44:18] NOW REST CUZ HE'LL NOT REST TILL HE
[44:20] FINISHES what he promised you."
[44:24] HE GOES BACK TO THE TO THE NEARER
[44:26] KINSMAN and the nearer kinsman is
[44:28] selfish and the nearer kinsman is greedy
[44:30] and THE NEAREST KENMAN'S NOT SACRIFICIAL
[44:32] AT ALL. AMEN. And he says, "Hey, listen.
[44:34] Naomi's back in town." Amen. AND AND AND
[44:38] ALL THAT WAS HER HUSBANDS and her sons
[44:40] and all that their inheritance is left
[44:43] uh open. Now, if you will redeem Naomi
[44:46] and all that she has, then you can have
[44:48] it all back. And the devil's like, I get
[44:52] it all
[44:55] &gt;&gt; because he's sitting like a squatter
[44:56] over it anyways.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Even though it's not rightfully his, he
[45:00] sits as a squatter on this earth.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; He says, "But
[45:07] but
[45:08] if you take Naomi, you have to take back
[45:11] Ruth and raise up seed for the dead."
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[45:18] If I raise up seed for the dead, he
[45:20] says, I mar my own inheritance.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; There's something about the right of
[45:27] redemption in that seed that would come
[45:29] forth that would cause him to lose maybe
[45:33] a portion of his own inheritance.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; And he sure ain't going to do right by
[45:38] that woman. And he's sure not going to
[45:39] bring up seed by her because he's not
[45:41] going to lose anything to a rightful
[45:43] heir.
[45:45] Oh, but Boaz is totally different. Boaz
[45:48] is going to give all of himself. Amen.
[45:50] And this child that comes up is not just
[45:52] going to redeem what Naomi lost, but is
[45:54] also going to become the Lord of the
[45:56] harvest and take Boaz's place and have
[45:58] more than they've ever had in the past.
[46:00] Because that's what God's giving to us.
[46:02] He's giving us everything. He's making
[46:04] us a joint heir OVER ALL CREATION. NOT
[46:07] JUST A PORTION. NOT JUST WE'RE NOT JUST
[46:09] GETTING BACK ETERNAL LIFE. WE'RE GETTING
[46:11] BACK ALL OF OUR PORTION. AND WE'RE
[46:13] GETTING ALL OF HIS PORTION, TOO.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT BOAZ GAVE. AMEN. TO THIS
[46:19] seed when when when he went into Ruth
[46:21] and she conceived and she BROUGHT FORTH
[46:23] A CHILD. THAT CHILD SHE BROUGHT FORTH
[46:25] BECAME OF HEIR OF ALL THAT NAOMI'S
[46:28] husband and sons had lost, BUT ALSO
[46:30] BECAME AN HEIR OF ALL THAT BOAZ HAD. And
[46:33] this was the heir of all.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she's sitting there
[46:41] because she had a secret meeting that no
[46:43] one observed.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; And she received a promise to her that
[46:48] no one heard. That's right.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; AND SHE HER ONLY TOKEN evidence was six
[46:53] measures of barley
[46:56] &gt;&gt; and she could look at that barley and
[46:59] Naomi could look at that barley and they
[47:01] said, "Don't worry, he's not going to
[47:03] leave it unfinished.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; You can't stop at 6. You got to go to
[47:07] seven. Don't you worry. He signaled to
[47:10] you that he's going to come and finish
[47:12] it. Amen. There's a mysterious measure
[47:15] he hasn't given you yet, but he's not
[47:17] going to stop at six. He'll come to
[47:19] God's perfect number of completion.
[47:21] He'll come to seven. You rest because
[47:23] he's not going to rest until you get the
[47:25] seventh portion.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. But what did Ruth have to do? She
[47:34] had to do something that looked bad. She
[47:36] had to do something that was risky.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; She had to leave, Amen. the comforts of
[47:42] a good reputation. And she had to risk
[47:45] losing her reputation. Tamar had to list
[47:48] risk losing her reputation. And friends,
[47:51] I gladly lose my reputation. Amen. to do
[47:54] whatever looks WRONG, WHATEVER LOOKS
[47:57] LIKE MIGHT be misjudged by other
[47:59] people's actions, think you went after a
[48:01] cult, you follow after a man, you got
[48:03] deceived by this, and you've gone too
[48:05] far. You're extremism, you're a
[48:07] legalist, you're whatever. I don't care
[48:09] WHAT THEY SAY. I'VE GOT A TOKEN IN MY
[48:11] POCKET. I GOT A LOVE OF GOD SHED ABROAD
[48:13] IN MY HEART. I GOT A WITNESS INSIDE OF
[48:15] me that WITNESS THAT I AM, AMEN, THE SON
[48:17] OF GOD. I AM A CHILD OF GOD. AND I'VE
[48:19] GOT THIS STAFF, THIS MEASURE, THE THIS
[48:22] STAFF THAT THE message of the hour
[48:23] THAT'S LEADING ME ALL THE WAY BACK HOME.
[48:26] AMEN. IF SOMEBODY HURTS MY FEELINGS,
[48:27] ACCUSES ME. THAT'S FINE. IT CAN HURT. IT
[48:30] CAN STING. BUT WHEN I GO BACK TO MY
[48:32] PRAYER CLOSET AND I TOUCH THAT STAFF
[48:34] AGAIN, I KNOW THAT THIS STAFF IS FROM
[48:37] JUDAH. IS FROM THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF
[48:40] JUDAH. AND THIS IS HIS SIGNATE RING. AND
[48:42] I'VE GOT GUARANTEE THAT I'M GOING TO
[48:44] MAKE IT. HE'S NOT GOING TO LEAVE THE
[48:46] WORK UNDONE. AND NO MATTER WHAT
[48:48] EVERYBODY ACCUSES ME OF, HE'S DECLARED
[48:51] ME RIGHTEOUS.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. Amen. It matters. I
[48:58] don't say IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT MATTERS.
[49:00] We're human beings. We can't stop things
[49:02] from offending. We can't stop things
[49:03] from hurting. AMEN. BUT WE GOT TO GO
[49:05] BACK, AMEN, TO THE TOKENS THAT HE'S
[49:07] GIVEN US and realize, Amen. Nobody else
[49:11] was there. Nobody else knows. NOBODY
[49:13] LIVES IN MY HEART. BUT I KNOW WHOM I
[49:15] HAVE BELIEVED IN. I KNOW WHO I MET. I
[49:18] KNOW WHO I'M UNIFIED WITH.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; And I MAY NOT GET ONE PERSON ON THIS
[49:22] PLANET TO BELIEVE IT, BUT IN THAT DAY,
[49:25] HE'LL RECOGNIZE THE TOKEN he gave me.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAY, "THAT'S MY LIFE. THAT'S MY
[49:30] TOKEN. THAT'S MY SPIRIT in you."
[49:34] &gt;&gt; IT'S MY STAFF YOU'RE FOLLOWING. That's
[49:36] my word that you love.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Listen, I didn't give myself this
[49:42] message. He gave it to me.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T MAKE IT UP. I DIDN'T
[49:46] MANIPULATE. I DIDN'T FIGURE IT OUT. I
[49:48] DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. IT WAS GOD WHO SENT
[49:50] THE MESSAGE OUR WAY. IT WAS GOD WHO
[49:52] VINDICATED. GOD WHO SENT THE PROPHET. WE
[49:54] DIDN'T MAKE IT UP, FRIENDS. IT'S HIS
[49:56] ROD. AMEN. He just gave it to us.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[50:05] And now, no matter what anybody says, if
[50:09] there's ever a question, I can say
[50:13] whoever this staff belongs to, who
[50:15] whoever this message belongs to,
[50:17] &gt;&gt; is who I'm pregnant by.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's the seed I've received from
[50:23] the man who sent this message.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; From the one who gave me this signate
[50:30] ring, this Holy Ghost. That's the one.
[50:33] That's the life that's inside of me. The
[50:36] life that came from him.
[50:39] Brother Brandham said spoken where's the
[50:41] original seed? He said that's where we
[50:42] found when Adam came to his wife. She
[50:45] was pregnantated with the wrong seed.
[50:47] That seed died. Joseph came to his she
[50:50] was pregnantated. Now what caused a
[50:53] different pregnantation? Because that
[50:55] Adam's wife doubted the word. That's
[50:57] right. Joseph's bride believed the word.
[51:00] The difference.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:03] Now he's talking about Mary.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Mary fetching water as a young girl,
[51:11] espouseed to a man to be married.
[51:14] She has a secret meeting with an angel.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see a theme in the Bible?
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; These things are done in secret,
[51:26] friends.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Secretly. You know, when brother Andreas
[51:31] was preaching and he got to marry, it
[51:32] just blessed my heart. He said, he said,
[51:34] "Forgive me for saying that, but God
[51:35] could have done it a better way."
[51:38] Like, if you would have done it before
[51:41] that she was engaged, it would have
[51:42] saved her some trouble, Joseph some
[51:44] trouble, a lot of people a lot of
[51:45] trouble. But God wasn't interested in
[51:47] saving people trouble. He was interested
[51:49] in bringing about his plan.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. But listen, if he would have done,
[51:55] if the angel would have showed up in the
[51:57] synagogue in front of the priest and
[51:59] pointed Mary out,
[52:01] &gt;&gt; he'd have saved her a lot of trouble.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Why do it in secret?
[52:08] She's the only one who heard what he
[52:09] said.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; She's the only one who got the message.
[52:13] She's the only one now in the whole
[52:17] world that knew what the fulfillment of
[52:20] Isaiah 14 was. Isaiah 7:14,
[52:23] a virgin shall conceive. She now knew
[52:25] and she knew who the virgin was. She
[52:27] knew when that scripture is going to
[52:29] come to place. And she now had the full
[52:31] revelation of that scripture. And she's
[52:33] the only one, not a priest, not a high
[52:35] priest, not a scholar, nobody else. And
[52:37] he told it to a little virgin girl who
[52:39] is 14, 15, 16 years old about to be
[52:42] married. And he comes to her and he
[52:44] calls her highly favored and he tells
[52:46] her she's the chosen one and she's going
[52:48] to bring forth a child. And nobody's
[52:50] there to witness it. And he doesn't give
[52:52] her a sign. He doesn't GIVE HER A
[52:54] DOCUMENT. He doesn't give her an
[52:56] evidence.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I love it. Why in the
[53:06] world are we worried about trying to
[53:08] prove our sunship to anybody? Why are we
[53:11] trying to prove our relationship to
[53:13] Christ to anybody? There's nothing we'll
[53:15] ever do to prove it. God gave it to you
[53:17] in secret and he intends you to believe
[53:19] what took place in secret and stand by
[53:21] it.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. God I mean we would what God if
[53:26] you'll just give me a sign do a miracle
[53:28] through me everybody will believe I'm a
[53:30] believer.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; No they won't.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; But God doesn't do it that way.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Now he comes to Mary and he gives her
[53:40] the word. Just the word. No token. No
[53:43] physical evidence. nothing that she
[53:46] could put HER FINGERS ON. ALL he gives
[53:48] her is the promised word.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; And guess what? She receives it.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Not a physical evidence like Tamar HAD.
[53:57] NOT A TOKEN uh like Ruth had. She has
[54:01] absolutely nothing to show anybody else.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; ALL SHE HAS IS HER TESTIMONY. And that
[54:07] testimony probably is not widely
[54:10] believed.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Can we just take a shot in the dark?
[54:12] Maybe. I mean, I doubt she was believed.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; And then, you know, the only thing she
[54:18] has is the experience she had in private
[54:20] with the angel of the Lord and the
[54:22] message that was given to her and her
[54:24] heart's desire, the connection she had
[54:25] in her soul to believe that message. And
[54:28] when she ASKED THE QUESTION, HOW WILL
[54:30] THIS BE? SHE'S thinking physical again.
[54:32] How physically how I don't know a man.
[54:34] How will I get seed? I'm a virgin. and
[54:36] and all of these things. He said, "The
[54:38] Holy Ghost shall ever sh over overshadow
[54:40] thee, and the thing formed in you shall
[54:41] be of the most high."
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Listen, that is not an explanation of
[54:46] how it's going to work.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; But there's something more moving her
[54:51] than just intellect, just reasoning,
[54:53] JUST SCIENCE. THERE'S GOT TO BE THERE'S
[54:55] SOMETHING MORE GOING ON INSIDE OF HER
[54:57] than just the NATURAL WORLD. THERE WAS
[54:59] SOMETHING PUSHING TAMAR, SOMETHING
[55:01] PUSHING RUTH. And there was something
[55:03] behind MARY PUSHING HER TO SAY, "BE it
[55:05] unto me according TO YOUR WORD. I'LL
[55:08] ACCEPT THAT." AND LISTEN, HER DECISION
[55:10] WAS RISKY. IT LOOKED BAD.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; IT AFFECTED HER REPUTATION. IT PUT HER
[55:16] IN IN THE EYES OF MANY PEOPLE. IT PUT
[55:18] HER IN A DIFFERENT CLASS OF PERSON. SHE
[55:21] WAS SUBJECT TO SCORN. SHE WAS SUBJECT to
[55:23] ridicule. SHE MAY HAVE BEEN MOCKED BY
[55:25] PEOPLE. AMEN. BECAUSE SHE COMES OUT WITH
[55:27] A TESTIMONY. I TALKED TO AN ANGEL AND
[55:30] GUESS WHAT? I'M THE FULFILLMENT OF
[55:31] ISAIAH 7:14. And everybody looked at her
[55:34] and said, "You poor kid. What is wrong
[55:35] with you? Did you sleep last night? Have
[55:37] you been up,
[55:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Are you having another manic episode?
[55:45] THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT. FRIENDS, WOULD
[55:46] YOU BELIEVE IT? SOMEBODY come running up
[55:48] to you AND SAID, "GUESS WHAT? I MET AN
[55:50] angel and this, this, and this." LISTEN,
[55:52] THERE WAS SOMETHING moving her. SHE
[55:54] WOULD TAKE A STEP. AMEN. AND NOBODY
[55:56] BELIEVED IT, BUT she believed it cuz she
[55:59] was there.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; She heard it.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham said SHE WENT TESTIFYING
[56:05] BEFORE SHE FELT ONE THING INSIDE of her
[56:08] chain. SHE DIDN'T WAIT FOR SIGNS. SHE
[56:10] DIDN'T WAIT FOR TOKEN EVIDENCE. SHE JUST
[56:12] WENT with the word and believed the
[56:14] word. MARY IS OUR TYPE, FRIENDS.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T PROTECT HER REPUTATION, GUARD
[56:22] HERSELF, GUARD HER REPUTATION. She just
[56:24] went. She just received the word and
[56:26] went declaring the word
[56:29] &gt;&gt; and then her problems got worse
[56:33] &gt;&gt; because when it started to show that
[56:36] something in her life changed
[56:42] &gt;&gt; when her walk changed when her taste
[56:44] changed when her desires changed when
[56:47] everything about her be to change
[56:50] then pretty soon everybody realized
[56:52] there's something different about you
[56:55] and her pregnantation begin to show
[56:59] &gt;&gt; and it would begin to show.
[57:02] They switched from thinking this poor
[57:04] child is just deceived, seeing visions,
[57:07] having dreams, having a nightmare till
[57:09] she's a harlot
[57:12] &gt;&gt; and she's been in whoredoms.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; She's been getting tangled up with wrong
[57:17] kind of men, possibly a soldier or
[57:19] something. And
[57:22] &gt;&gt; you know what?
[57:24] Those things may have hurt Mary's
[57:26] feelings.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; They may have been hard to hear. And
[57:30] when she would walk through the market,
[57:32] everybody's whisper stop when she walks
[57:34] past. That might have stung.
[57:36] That might have hurt. But there's no way
[57:40] in the world she could give up what she
[57:42] believed. There's no way she could go
[57:44] back on what she declared because she
[57:46] knew this life inside of me, this thing
[57:50] that now is growing, this thing that now
[57:52] is moving, this thing that's changing my
[57:53] whole life, this didn't come from no
[57:55] man. This came from God Almighty. Amen.
[57:58] I had nothing to do with it. This is
[58:00] beyond me. AMEN. AND HER EVIDENCE WAS
[58:03] NOT THE EVIDENCE ANYBODY else had or
[58:05] everybody ELSE SAW. HER EVIDENCE was the
[58:07] life that was living in her. AND SHE
[58:09] KNEW THAT'S NOT MY LIFE. THAT'S ANOTHER
[58:12] life inside of me. AND IT'S NOT A LIFE I
[58:15] PUT THERE. AND IT'S NOT A LIFE NO
[58:16] DENOMINATIONAL man put there. BUT THIS
[58:19] LIFE WAS FROM HIM. THIS COME FROM GOD
[58:21] HIMSELF. IT'S HIS OWN LIFE GROWING in
[58:23] me.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; AND LISTEN FRIENDS, WHEN OUR LIFE
[58:25] CHANGES and our tastes change and and we
[58:27] can't associate where we used to
[58:29] associate and we can't do the things we
[58:30] used to do and it begins to show that
[58:32] we're pregnant.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Listen, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PEOPLE
[58:37] SAY, WHAT THEY THINK, THE accusations
[58:39] they throw. It doesn't MATTER BECAUSE WE
[58:42] KNOW THAT THIS LIFE IN ME IS NOT MY
[58:45] LIFE. IT'S HIS LIFE. I KNOW WHAT I WAS
[58:47] BEFORE AND I KNOW THE WAY I LIVED AND I
[58:49] KNOW THE things I couldn't overcome and
[58:51] I know the trappings and vices THAT I
[58:53] KEPT FALLING INTO. I KNOW WHAT MY LIFE
[58:55] WAS. This that's LIVING INSIDE OF ME IS
[58:58] SOMETHING ELSE. IT'S NOT JUST ME. IT'S
[59:00] HIM IN ME. IT'S THE SEED THAT I'VE
[59:03] RECEIVED IN A PRIVATE VISITATION. NOBODY
[59:06] WAS AROUND. NOBODY HEARD IT. BUT I HEARD
[59:09] IT AND I BASED ON THE WORD I RECEIVED
[59:12] IT.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN I RECEIVED IT, I BELIEVED THAT
[59:18] I GOT IT. AND WHEN I GOT IT, IT BEGAN TO
[59:21] GROW INSIDE OF ME. AND IT BEGAN TO WORK
[59:23] INSIDE OF ME. AND IT'S CHANGED
[59:25] EVERYTHING ABOUT MY LIFE.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE MAY ACCUSE ME OF A FANATIC.
[59:31] THEY MAY ACCUSE me of a religious
[59:33] zealot. THEY MAY ACCUSE ME OF FOLLOWING
[59:35] WHATEVER WRONG DOCTRINES. I CAN'T HELP
[59:38] IT. I KNOW THIS LIFE INSIDE OF ME is not
[59:41] me. It's more THAN ME. IT'S ANOTHER LIFE
[59:44] GROWING in me.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; AND I CAN'T BACK UP ON IT.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW CAN I BACK UP AND SAY, "NO,
[59:55] THAT WASN'T GOD. THAT WAS JUST ME." MY
[59:58] GOODNESS, I WAS THERE. I KNOW WHAT I
[1:00:00] WAS. I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. MARY KNEW
[1:00:03] BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, NO MAN
[1:00:06] planted this seed inside of me.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; She knew it, friends.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; AND I CAN TELL YOU BEYOND ANY SHADOW OF
[1:00:13] A DOUBT. IT WAS NO DENOMINATION THAT
[1:00:15] GAVE ME THIS LIFE. AMEN. THERE WAS NO
[1:00:17] TEACHINGS OF A MAN THAT gave me this
[1:00:19] life. IT WAS THE ONE WHO GAVE ME HIS
[1:00:21] STAFF AND IT WAS THE ONE WHO GAVE ME HIS
[1:00:23] RING. IT'S HIS LIFE THAT'S INSIDE of me.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; And you CAN JUDGE ME ANY WAY YOU WANT.
[1:00:28] AND PEOPLE CAN JUDGE ONE ANOTHER. AND IT
[1:00:31] DOESN'T MATTER WHAT JUDGMENTS ARE PASSED
[1:00:33] ABOUT YOU, MY FRIEND. If you hold the
[1:00:35] signate ring and you hold the rod and
[1:00:37] you feel within you the life of the one
[1:00:39] you met in private growing inside of
[1:00:42] you, you can rest.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Rest.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; All is well.
[1:00:50] If you have his ring and you have his
[1:00:54] staff and inside you received his seed
[1:00:57] and now his life is growing in you,
[1:01:00] you're as righteous as he is righteous
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; because he never sws his seed in
[1:01:06] unrighteousness.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; He will only come to a virgin womb.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:01:18] Listen,
[1:01:20] life isn't easy. Brother said it wasn't
[1:01:23] meant to be easy.
[1:01:25] We never come through life unscathed. We
[1:01:28] never come through life without trials,
[1:01:30] without difficulties, without
[1:01:31] accusations. And many of the things that
[1:01:34] we've done as believers of this message,
[1:01:37] most of the world doesn't understand.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Sometimes other Christian, many other
[1:01:42] Christians don't understand. Sometimes
[1:01:44] other people who claim to believe the
[1:01:46] message don't understand.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; But it's not my job to make anybody else
[1:01:51] understand. I can't make anybody else
[1:01:53] understand. I was the one who was in the
[1:01:56] private meeting.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; I heard. I was there. And these tokens
[1:02:02] that I'm carrying, listen, it may not
[1:02:04] mean anything to you, but it sure means
[1:02:07] something to me.
[1:02:10] This message that I did not give myself
[1:02:13] but that I received. This word that's
[1:02:15] leading me home. It may not mean a lot
[1:02:17] to you but it means a lot to me
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; because it was given by the one who's
[1:02:23] leading me home.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Listen, you may doubt whether I've got
[1:02:28] the Holy Ghost or not, and I can't
[1:02:30] convince you otherwise.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; You may think that my signate ring is a
[1:02:35] trinket from the dollar store.
[1:02:38] a cheap knockoff.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; A cheap version of the real. What am I
[1:02:45] going to do to convince you it's
[1:02:46] different?
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; But I tell you one thing. Amen.
[1:02:52] This ring that I've got and this staff
[1:02:55] that I've got will cause me to bypass
[1:02:57] judgment.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; There's one who knows where it's real or
[1:03:01] not. Yes,
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; there's for sure one who knows whether
[1:03:04] this signate is a knockoff trinket from
[1:03:06] the dollar store or an original item.
[1:03:08] There is one who knows if this staff
[1:03:10] that I believe this message that I hold
[1:03:11] to whether it's genuine that I hold to
[1:03:13] the genuine message of God or not.
[1:03:15] There's one who knows and it's the one
[1:03:17] who gave it and I'm trusting the one who
[1:03:19] gave it. He's the one who has to
[1:03:20] identify it. He's the one who HAS TO
[1:03:23] DISCERN WHOSE ITEMS THESE ARE. OH GOD,
[1:03:28] DISCERN IN US WHOSE SPIRIT THIS IS,
[1:03:31] WHOSE WORD THIS IS THAT WE'RE HOLDING ON
[1:03:33] TO. I'M HOLDING ON TO A STAFF, THE
[1:03:35] SHEPHERD STAFF THAT'S GUIDING ME
[1:03:36] THROUGH. WHOSE STAFF IS THIS? IT'S GOD'S
[1:03:39] STAFF. IT'S HIS WORD. IT'S JESUS CHRIST,
[1:03:41] THE WORD OF GOD THAT I'M HOLDING TO.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And the one who gave it is the one
[1:03:48] who can identify it. And there's not a
[1:03:50] thing I can do to prove its authenticity
[1:03:52] to you.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:56] Yes,
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; but there's only one who needs to
[1:03:59] vindicate its authenticity,
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; and that's the one who gave it.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus says in Luke 8, "For nothing is
[1:04:09] secret that shall not be made manifest."
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Neither anything hid that shall not be
[1:04:15] known and come abroad.
[1:04:18] Your meeting with Christ may have been
[1:04:20] private. Your baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:22] may just be private to you.
[1:04:25] The token that you hold that vindicates
[1:04:28] that you've been you unified with
[1:04:30] Christ. Nobody else may be able to
[1:04:31] understand it. But Jesus said there's
[1:04:33] nothing is secret that shall not be made
[1:04:36] manifest.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; One day, friends, it's going to be made
[1:04:39] manifest whose ring this is.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Whose signate this is and whose staff
[1:04:44] this is. Amen. It's going to be made
[1:04:46] manifest. Amen. We hold it in secret
[1:04:48] now, but God's going to declare it
[1:04:50] openly someday.
[1:04:52] Yes.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; I say hold to it.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Hold to it. Love it. Enjoy it. Amen.
[1:05:02] Gain confidence from what God has given
[1:05:05] to you and I.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Will people accuse? Yes. Will the devil,
[1:05:10] the accuser, the brother, whisper in
[1:05:12] your ear that it's not you and you're
[1:05:13] not the one and it's not real and you
[1:05:15] were just mistaken? Absolutely. He'll
[1:05:18] use other voices. He'll use your voice.
[1:05:20] He'll use people all around. He'll use
[1:05:22] circumstances and failures in your own
[1:05:24] life to try to give you an identity. But
[1:05:26] forget all of that.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Can you realize like Mary,
[1:05:33] listen, nobody believes me.
[1:05:36] Nobody understands
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; and it looks bad.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Here a virgin girl, not yet married,
[1:05:45] walking around pregnant. It looks bad.
[1:05:50] But when she feels that life inside of
[1:05:52] her stir and kick, she knows how it got
[1:05:55] there.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; When you hear the preaching of the word,
[1:05:58] listen, co-workers and friends and
[1:06:00] relatives, they may think you're off
[1:06:02] your rocker and gone too far, but under
[1:06:04] the preaching of the word, when that
[1:06:05] life inside begins to kick and jump, you
[1:06:08] know that life came from somewhere else.
[1:06:10] Amen. That's from AMEN. THAT'S FROM GOD
[1:06:13] ALMIGHTY. THAT'S FROM my husband. That's
[1:06:14] from Jesus Christ. And that's his
[1:06:16] impregnation in me. his life inside of
[1:06:19] me.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ben says, "The other is
[1:06:24] pregnantated by the word of God and will
[1:06:26] bring forth the body, the finished body
[1:06:28] of Jesus Christ, which is the bride."
[1:06:30] What's the finished body of Jesus
[1:06:31] Christ? The bride. What are you bringing
[1:06:33] forth? The bride. WHERE ARE YOU BRINGING
[1:06:35] FORTH THE BRIDE? IN YOU.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; THAT LIFE IS MANIFESTING in you. IN
[1:06:39] BRIDE FORM. AND THAT LIFE IN YOU IS
[1:06:42] BRINGING FORTH ITS OWN LIFE IN BRIDE
[1:06:45] FORM. And you're becoming the
[1:06:47] manifestation of your pregnantation.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. The body of Christ isn't finished
[1:06:53] yet. How many knows that a man and woman
[1:06:56] is one and Christ is one body? The word.
[1:06:58] The bride will have to be the rest of
[1:07:00] that body. And the two together makes
[1:07:02] one body again.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; So what are you bringing forth? His life
[1:07:06] where in you.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; The man makes this statement. I want to
[1:07:12] just read through a couple more uh uh
[1:07:14] slides as we finish. And Christianity is
[1:07:17] misrepresented to people. Christianity
[1:07:20] has been represented to people as a
[1:07:21] declaration of creed. Christianity is a
[1:07:24] living being, Jesus Christ, the
[1:07:26] resurrected God that's alive among us
[1:07:28] now. Christianity is a person, not a
[1:07:31] creed. To know him is life. Not even to
[1:07:34] know his word, that isn't life. Know him
[1:07:38] and he is the word. Oh, I love this. Can
[1:07:40] I can I underline this?
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Not even to know his word, but to know
[1:07:45] him and he is the word.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; So, do I need to know the word or not?
[1:07:50] Absolutely. But he's telling you, you
[1:07:52] must have the person of the word. You
[1:07:54] can't take uh you can't just take the
[1:07:56] words that are in here without the life
[1:07:58] of the word. You can't just take sterile
[1:08:00] like churches take, like denominations
[1:08:02] take, just say, you know, John 3:16 says
[1:08:04] THIS AND NO, I WANT THE LIFE OF JOHN
[1:08:06] 3:16. I want the one who spoke the word,
[1:08:09] the one who wrote the word. I WANT THAT
[1:08:11] WORD IN ME AND I WILL BELIEVE ALL OF HIS
[1:08:13] WORD BECAUSE HE is the word.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; BUT I DON'T WANT WORDS WITHOUT THE WORD.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; I want the word to reveal all the words.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; A fellow said to me not long ago, I was
[1:08:28] just discussing about the what what we
[1:08:30] thought about a certain scripture in the
[1:08:32] Bible. This fellow was quite a scholar.
[1:08:34] Said, well, you just don't know your
[1:08:36] Bible. I said I know the author real
[1:08:38] well. So that's the main thing. If I
[1:08:40] know him, he will take care of the rest
[1:08:42] of it. To know him is life.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Brother says, "So therefore there is no
[1:08:49] school, no theologians, no teachings of
[1:08:52] the Bible among any school that knows
[1:08:54] anything about it. They cannot know
[1:08:56] anything about it. It's impossible for
[1:08:58] them to know anything about it. God has
[1:09:00] hid the senses of knowing it from the
[1:09:01] very elected teachers and everything
[1:09:03] else. It's a personal individual affair
[1:09:06] with with the person that Christ is
[1:09:08] revealed to them.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; That's why you can't prove it to nobody
[1:09:12] else. God doesn't want you to be able to
[1:09:14] prove it to anybody else.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Listen, we've lived this life long
[1:09:19] enough and been in the message long
[1:09:20] enough to see people who were gifted,
[1:09:22] people who who who could do nice works
[1:09:25] and nice things and do good deeds who
[1:09:27] would leave the word.
[1:09:31] We've been long enough to see people
[1:09:32] who, you know, don't always get it
[1:09:34] right. A little rough around the edges,
[1:09:36] but they keep coming back to the word.
[1:09:38] Amen.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; They stay put regardless because they
[1:09:41] don't know where else to go.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to be. The one who
[1:09:45] doesn't know where else to go. Let's
[1:09:47] turn to 2 Corinthians together.
[1:09:56] 2 Corinthians 4.
[1:10:06] Second Corinthians chapter 4 and we'll
[1:10:08] start at verse 6.
[1:10:13] For God who commanded the light to shine
[1:10:16] out darkness has shined in our hearts to
[1:10:19] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:10:21] glory of God in the face of Jesus
[1:10:23] Christ.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Let's read that again. For God who
[1:10:28] commanded the light to shine out of the
[1:10:29] darkness, that's revelation
[1:10:32] has shined in our hearts to give the
[1:10:34] light of the knowledge of the glory of
[1:10:36] God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:40] That's Christ, the mystery of God
[1:10:41] revealed.
[1:10:44] That we can see the knowledge of the
[1:10:46] glory of God in the face of Jesus
[1:10:48] Christ. He is the revelation of God.
[1:10:52] Then verse seven, but we have this
[1:10:54] treasure in earthn vessels that the
[1:10:58] excellency of the power may be of God
[1:11:00] and not of us.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Where is this great treasure of the
[1:11:04] revelation of God of the glory of God?
[1:11:06] Where is it? It's in earthn vessels,
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; stuck down in a clay pot
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; made out of dirt.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; And we have a treasure in earthn
[1:11:20] vessels.
[1:11:21] When you look at me, you see a clay pot,
[1:11:24] but in me is a treasure.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; When I look at you, I may see a clay
[1:11:29] pot, but I'm trusting inside of you is a
[1:11:31] treasure, too.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; And the question is, is it a treasure to
[1:11:34] us? Do we have this revelation of who
[1:11:37] God is? Is this treasure
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; in our hearts?
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; If it is, Amen. then to us, it's a
[1:11:48] treasure.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's in the clay pot and it to me
[1:11:53] it's sealed in there.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; So you can write on the outside of the
[1:11:57] pot treasure.
[1:12:01] That doesn't mean there's any treasure
[1:12:02] in there.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; You can write anything on you want on
[1:12:07] the outside. Amen. But the reality
[1:12:09] there's either a treasure in there or
[1:12:10] not. Amen. And the clay pot should know
[1:12:13] if it's holding a treasure or not.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:17] that that I may just be a vessel like
[1:12:21] every other vessel that's on the planet.
[1:12:22] I may be human like everybody else is
[1:12:24] human. There's nothing special about me
[1:12:26] that makes me different than another
[1:12:28] human being. Amen. But there's something
[1:12:30] special inside of me.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; And that's him.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; And we have this treasure, this
[1:12:36] revelation, this word, this person is in
[1:12:40] us. Now, now that we have this treasure
[1:12:43] in earth and vessels, that the
[1:12:45] excellency of the power may be of God
[1:12:47] and not of us. Let's read what it says
[1:12:49] next. We are troubled on every side
[1:12:54] yet not distressed.
[1:12:56] Why are we not distressed? Because I
[1:12:57] have a treasure in my earthn vessel.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; That is the revelation of God.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Okay. We are troubled on every side, not
[1:13:06] distressed. We are perplexed but not in
[1:13:08] despair. persecuted but not forsaken,
[1:13:11] cast down but not destroyed, always
[1:13:13] bearing about in the body the dying of
[1:13:15] the Lord Jesus, that the life also of
[1:13:18] Jesus might be made manifest in our
[1:13:20] body. For we which live are always
[1:13:23] delivered unto death for Jesus' sake,
[1:13:25] that the life also of Jesus might be
[1:13:27] made manifest in our mortal flesh.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; We have a treasure in earth and vessels.
[1:13:36] And because we have a treasure in earth
[1:13:38] and vessels,
[1:13:39] we are perplexed. We are distressed. We
[1:13:43] are in the midst of troubles.
[1:13:45] Why? Because we He wants to display the
[1:13:49] treasure that's inside and let it start
[1:13:51] leaking to the outside.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; We know what the treasure is. Others may
[1:13:56] not know. But God uses all of these
[1:13:59] circumstances. And in the circumstances,
[1:14:01] we may be distressed, but we're not
[1:14:03] perplexed. Listen, we're not It's not
[1:14:05] that we're not perplexed because we're
[1:14:06] super bright.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; We're not perplexed because we know the
[1:14:10] tokens that we hold.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; We know the treasure that's inside. We
[1:14:14] know who we are. And things go wrong,
[1:14:16] but it can't change what I'm holding in
[1:14:19] my hand.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Life can go backwards, upside down, and
[1:14:24] sideways, but it can't change the life
[1:14:28] that's inside of me is him.
[1:14:31] I may disappoint myself. Others may
[1:14:34] disappoint me. But nothing's going to
[1:14:36] change. I may get perplexed.
[1:14:40] I may get perplexed but not be in
[1:14:43] despair.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; I may uh I may be troubled on every side
[1:14:51] but not in distress. Why? The same
[1:14:54] reason that Mary wasn't. The same reason
[1:14:56] that Ruth wasn't. the same reason that
[1:14:59] Tamar wasn't
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; under the press. Do you think Tamar was
[1:15:03] pressed? Yes. You think Mary was
[1:15:05] pressed? Yes. I think they were pressed
[1:15:06] and under pressure.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; But yet they had token evidences that
[1:15:11] God had done something for them. And
[1:15:12] what he started, he was going to finish.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; And I believe with all my heart that
[1:15:18] what God has started in you and I, he
[1:15:20] himself, his life in us is going to
[1:15:23] finish. Amen.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; It's okay to be troubled on every side,
[1:15:27] but don't be distressed.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; It's okay. It's okay to have troubles.
[1:15:32] It's okay to have distresses. It's okay
[1:15:34] to get confused. Sometimes we just need
[1:15:37] to go back into our prayer closet
[1:15:40] and remember whose life this is inside
[1:15:42] of us.
[1:15:44] Who shed this love of God abroad in my
[1:15:46] heart? Who did that?
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:49] Who gave me the faith to believe that I
[1:15:53] was a son of God?
[1:15:55] Who gave me this message?
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Where did this precious word come from?
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; It came from him. And these are my
[1:16:03] tokens. These are my evidences.
[1:16:07] And I'm not here to show them to the
[1:16:09] world.
[1:16:11] I'm only here because he knows he gave
[1:16:15] them to me.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is my consolation that
[1:16:19] he's my husband, that I belong to him
[1:16:21] and he belongs to me. And this life
[1:16:23] inside of me is his life,
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; not mine.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful life to live, friends.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; I want to skip ahead to one other
[1:16:34] scripture as we close.
[1:16:37] Skipping, skipping, skipping. Let's go
[1:16:39] to Psalms 27.
[1:16:41] Brother Random comes to this in the
[1:16:43] rapture message.
[1:16:48] When brother Andreas was preaching on
[1:16:49] stuff
[1:16:51] all around Enoch was stuff, stuff was
[1:16:54] going on. Hey, listen. There's always
[1:16:55] stuff.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Life has a lot of stuff all around us.
[1:17:01] Brother Brennan, when he comes to the
[1:17:03] rapture message, he opens with this
[1:17:04] scripture reading in Psalms 27.
[1:17:08] He said, "The Lord is my light and my
[1:17:10] salvation. Whom shall I fear?"
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord is the strength of my
[1:17:14] life. Of whom shall I be afraid? When
[1:17:17] the wicked, even my enemies and my foes
[1:17:19] come upon me to eat up my flesh, they
[1:17:21] stumbled and fell. Though a host should
[1:17:24] encamp against me, my heart shall not
[1:17:26] fear. Though war should rise against me,
[1:17:30] in this will I be confident. One thing
[1:17:33] have I desired of the Lord, that will I
[1:17:34] seek after, that I may dwell in the
[1:17:37] house of the Lord all the days of my
[1:17:38] life, to behold the beauty of the Lord,
[1:17:41] and to inquire in his temple. For in the
[1:17:44] time of trouble, he shall hide me.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; In his pavilion, in the secret of his
[1:17:52] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[1:17:55] set me up upon a rock. And now shall my
[1:17:58] head be lifted up above mine enemies
[1:18:00] round about me. Therefore will I offer
[1:18:02] in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I
[1:18:05] will sing. Yay, I will sing praises unto
[1:18:08] the Lord.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; When is he singing praises unto the
[1:18:12] Lord? When war should gather against
[1:18:15] him. When a host should encamp around
[1:18:16] him. When all those around him should
[1:18:18] desire to eat up his flesh. That's when
[1:18:20] God is going to hide him in the secret
[1:18:22] of his pavilion. In his pavilion, in the
[1:18:24] secret of his tabernacle, God is going
[1:18:26] to bring him back into a private
[1:18:28] communion in secret.
[1:18:31] And the secret communion in the hidden
[1:18:33] tabernacle of the Lord is going to give
[1:18:36] him the ability to sing in the midst of
[1:18:38] trouble. In the time of trouble, we can
[1:18:41] still sing because all is well. If God
[1:18:44] could just bring us back into the
[1:18:46] secret, amen, where he gave us his
[1:18:48] gifts, where he told us who we are,
[1:18:49] where he revealed these things to us, if
[1:18:51] he could just bring us back into the
[1:18:53] secret of his tabernacle. Amen. Then
[1:18:55] there
[1:18:57] though a host gathered about, though the
[1:18:59] enemies want to eat us up, no matter
[1:19:01] what's going on, ALTHOUGH TROUBLE BE ALL
[1:19:03] AROUND, I CAN SING. YAY, I can rejoice.
[1:19:07] I can sing praises to the Lord BECAUSE
[1:19:09] ALL IS WELL. ALL WILL END WELL. I'VE GOT
[1:19:12] THE TOKENS of I got the tokens OF MY
[1:19:15] DELIVERANCE. I GOT THE TOKENS OF MY
[1:19:17] RIGHTEOUSNESS. I'VE GOT WHAT HE'S gave
[1:19:19] me. And this life and the secret OF MY
[1:19:21] TABERNACLE IS NOT just me. It's him and
[1:19:24] me dwelling together.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; David said he'll bring me into the
[1:19:28] secret to the HOLY OF HOLIES. NOT just
[1:19:30] his pavilion, but the tabernacle. This
[1:19:33] is the third realm. This is the inner
[1:19:35] veil. This is the Holy of Holies. This
[1:19:37] is DOWN INSIDE YOUR SOUL. GOD WILL BRING
[1:19:40] HIM DOWN INTO THE INNER CHAMBER. AND GOD
[1:19:42] will begin to commune with David again
[1:19:44] and reveal, "I'm yours. You're mine.
[1:19:47] We're in this together. I've given you
[1:19:49] the tokens OF MY LOVE. I'VE GIVEN YOU MY
[1:19:52] STAFF. I'VE GIVEN YOU A MY SIGNATE RING.
[1:19:54] I'VE SHED MY LOVE ABROAD IN YOUR HEART.
[1:19:56] I'VE GIVEN YOU A REVELATION of your
[1:19:58] sunship AND BRING US BACK INTO THAT
[1:20:00] PLACE WHERE IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE, I
[1:20:02] CAN SING PRAISES TO THE LORD AND SAY,
[1:20:04] "LORD, YOU ARE WONDERFUL. YOU ARE GREAT.
[1:20:07] YOU ARE HIGH AND ABOVE ALL AND ALL IS
[1:20:09] WELL.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; All is well."
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Where is our overcoming power? In the
[1:20:17] secret.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; WHAT GIVES US STRENGTH TO FACE EVERY
[1:20:21] DAY? It's the secret that we're holding
[1:20:23] on to. Amen. That nobody knows but we
[1:20:26] ourselves.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know your secret. I only know my
[1:20:31] secret.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Listen, none of us none of us can prove
[1:20:39] anything by anybody else or by anything.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; So don't prove.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Just settle down to what he gave you.
[1:20:48] And let the tokens from your lover, let
[1:20:50] the tokens from your husband be enough.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; And slip back into the inner chamber
[1:20:56] once in a while for some private time
[1:20:58] with him.
[1:20:59] Stick your hand back in your pocket and
[1:21:01] feel the ring and say, "Yep,
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; I do still love him.
[1:21:05] Yeah, I do. For whatever reason, I
[1:21:08] failed yesterday. I made a blunder
[1:21:10] today. But but the spirit is still
[1:21:13] witnessing with my spirit that I am a
[1:21:15] child of God." Amen.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; I This is his signate. This is his ring.
[1:21:20] And no matter what anybody said and how
[1:21:22] rough my day has been, this word is
[1:21:26] still his word and this is his message
[1:21:28] and this is his staff and it is still
[1:21:31] leading me home and I'm going to follow
[1:21:33] this staff all the way.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; And in the secret of the pavilion,
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; In the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[1:21:43] hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock.
[1:21:48] That's the rock of revelation
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; of who Christ is.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; And he'll lift my head above my enemies.
[1:21:55] What's what happens when your head gets
[1:21:56] lifted above your enemies? It means your
[1:21:58] revelation goes higher to where you
[1:22:01] understand what's going on. Your head's
[1:22:03] been lifted up above your enemy. That's
[1:22:05] not just being picked up and put on a
[1:22:06] pole, but your revelation and
[1:22:08] understanding is coming to a place where
[1:22:09] you realize it's okay. These things have
[1:22:12] to be this way, but nothing's changed
[1:22:15] with me in Christ.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; And I hold the tokens of my
[1:22:20] justification.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he gave them to me.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I am so
[1:22:28] thankful to be holding this secret.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; There's been many times, friends, I've
[1:22:34] had to go back, like Tamar must have had
[1:22:37] to do. I've had to go back and remember.
[1:22:41] That's right.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; I've had to go back and just touch that
[1:22:45] ring again.
[1:22:48] Go back and to the message and say, "I
[1:22:50] love this message with all of my heart."
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Go back and REFLECT ON WHAT MARY heard
[1:22:56] from the angel messenger that came to
[1:22:59] her and told her who she was and what
[1:23:01] what she was on earth to do and what her
[1:23:03] purpose was. And that something inside
[1:23:05] of her just said, "Amen."
[1:23:08] How many times she reflected back on
[1:23:10] that, how many hurtful things she heard
[1:23:13] and how many times she went back to that
[1:23:15] point.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Oh God, let me be like Mary. Let me
[1:23:20] stand fast with what you told me.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Let me hold on to it. Let me recognize
[1:23:26] that this isn't just me anymore.
[1:23:29] Mary said yes.
[1:23:31] But then she became pregnant.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. And now Mary's walk isn't just Mary
[1:23:38] anymore. There's another life inside of
[1:23:40] Mary. And this isn't just you and I
[1:23:42] anymore. We hold a secret inside. And
[1:23:44] that secret is growing
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; and taking over. And it's a life moving
[1:23:49] within us.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; And praise God. When it stirs,
[1:23:55] praise God.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; That's him in me.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand together.
[1:24:03] God bless you. musicians if you'll come
[1:24:04] and brother John if you'll please come
[1:24:08] and say friends we we have troubles I
[1:24:11] have troubles you have troubles I think
[1:24:13] we can expect tomorrow to have troubles
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; next week troubles but in the time of
[1:24:20] trouble
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; he shall hide me in his pavilion
[1:24:25] he's given me the secret
[1:24:28] Mary had Tamar had Ruth had now I'm
[1:24:33] holding holding a secret.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; This is what I have confidence in is the
[1:24:38] secret that I'm holding.
[1:24:40] I pray that you're holding a secret,
[1:24:42] too.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; And if not, I pray that you go to him
[1:24:47] and you do the risky thing. It was risky
[1:24:50] for Tamar. It was risky for Ruth. It was
[1:24:53] risky for Mary. I encourage you to go do
[1:24:55] the risky thing. Forget your reputation.
[1:24:59] Give up your own life and your own re
[1:25:01] your own ambitions and your own ideas
[1:25:04] and just go lay your life down at his
[1:25:06] feet like Ruth did at the threshing
[1:25:08] floor.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Give up everything. Give him your life.
[1:25:11] And it doesn't matter what your
[1:25:12] reputation is or what you ideas you had
[1:25:15] for the future. Just give away your life
[1:25:17] and DO LIKE TAMAR. RISK IT ALL TO HAVE
[1:25:20] WHAT'S YOURS.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; And when you do, just let him Amen. give
[1:25:26] you the token of the Holy Ghost. Let let
[1:25:28] him bring you to have confidence in that
[1:25:30] staff. Let that reality come into your
[1:25:32] life. And let his life begin to grow
[1:25:34] inside of you. And that you now you're
[1:25:37] carrying the secret.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; And your confidence is in the secret,
[1:25:42] not the public. That your confidence is
[1:25:45] in the secret.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you holding a secret today?
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's the greatest thing you can have
[1:25:53] a hold of is that secret.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray together.
[1:25:59] Lord Jesus, I thank you so much, Lord,
[1:26:02] for your word is so good. And God,
[1:26:05] you've given us such consolation, Lord,
[1:26:07] that we do have a treasure and earthn
[1:26:09] vessels that the excellency might be of
[1:26:12] you and not of us. For it's your power,
[1:26:15] your revelation, your life living in us.
[1:26:18] But God, many times we find ourselves in
[1:26:21] trouble,
[1:26:23] distressed, perplexed.
[1:26:26] But God, there's a peace that's on the
[1:26:28] inside. There's a relationship with you.
[1:26:31] There's a hidden place that you've
[1:26:32] brought us into.
[1:26:34] You've spoken to us through an angel.
[1:26:37] You've given to us your own life. You've
[1:26:39] planted your seed within.
[1:26:42] God, may that secret be the consolation
[1:26:44] we need to keep moving forward in life.
[1:26:48] God, I pray that you would, God, help us
[1:26:50] to overcome every obstacle and every
[1:26:53] trial with joy in our hearts, with a
[1:26:56] rejoicing on our lips. Because although
[1:26:59] there's enemies about, and although the
[1:27:01] devil is trying in every way to derail
[1:27:03] us, you have brought us into the secret
[1:27:06] of your tabernacle, Lord. And now I will
[1:27:08] sing praises to your name. I will
[1:27:10] rejoice
[1:27:12] for in my soul all is well. Oh, we love
[1:27:15] you. We thank you for this. I pray God
[1:27:17] if there's any that's not holding this
[1:27:20] secret, I pray they would come to you
[1:27:21] now that they would surrender all. That
[1:27:24] they would lay it all away and they
[1:27:26] would reach out and grab a hold of you,
[1:27:28] Lord. That they would surrender their
[1:27:30] life and lay down, Lord, at your feet
[1:27:33] and ask you, Lord, to be their redeemer.
[1:27:36] To ask you, Lord, to fulfill your
