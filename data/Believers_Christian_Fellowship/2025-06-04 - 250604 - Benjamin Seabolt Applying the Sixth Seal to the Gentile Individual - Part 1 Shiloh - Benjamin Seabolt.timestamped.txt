[0:00] [Music]
[0:01] Well, this world is not my home. I'm
[0:05] just a passing through. My treasures are
[0:08] laid up somewhere beyond the blue. The
[0:13] angels beckon me from heaven's open
[0:17] door. And I can't feel at home in this
[0:21] world
[0:23] anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no
[0:27] friend like you. If heaven's not my
[0:30] home, then Lord, what would I do? The
[0:34] angels beckoning me from heaven's open
[0:38] door. And I can't feel at home in this
[0:42] world
[0:44] anymore. Well, they're all expecting me.
[0:48] And that's one thing I know. I fixed it
[0:51] up with Jesus many years ago. I know
[0:56] he'll see me through. Though I am weak
[1:00] and poor and I can't feel at home in
[1:03] this world
[1:06] anymore. Oh Lord, you know that I have
[1:09] no friends like you. If heaven's not my
[1:13] home, then Lord, what will I do? The
[1:17] angels beckon me from heaven's open
[1:20] door. And I can't feel at home in this
[1:24] world
[1:27] anymore. Just over in glory land. We'll
[1:31] live
[1:32] eternally. The saints on every hand are
[1:36] shouting
[1:37] victory. The songs of sweetest praise
[1:41] drift back from heaven shore. And I
[1:44] can't feel at home in this world
[1:48] anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no
[1:52] breath like you. If heaven's not my
[1:55] home, then Lord, what will I do? The
[1:59] angels back in me from heaven's open
[2:03] door and I can't feel at home in this
[2:07] world anymore. Verse one. Well, this
[2:11] world is not my home. I'm just a passing
[2:15] through. My treasures are laid up
[2:18] somewhere beyond the blue. The angels
[2:22] beckon me from heaven's open door. And I
[2:26] can't feel at home in this world
[2:30] anymore. And oh Lord, you know that I
[2:34] have no friend like you. If heaven's not
[2:37] my home, then Lord, what would I do? The
[2:42] angels beckon me from heaven's open
[2:45] door. And I can't feel at home in this
[2:49] world anymore. And I can't feel at home
[2:54] in this world
[2:57] anymore. Soon this life will all be
[3:03] over. and our pilgrimage will
[3:08] end. Then we'll take our heavenly
[3:13] journey. We'll be at home with Christ
[3:16] our
[3:18] friend. And heaven's gates are standing
[3:23] open, waiting for our entrance there.
[3:29] Some sweet day we're going
[3:33] over. All the beauty is there to
[3:38] share. There's just a little while to
[3:42] stay here. Just a little while to
[3:49] wait. Just a little while to
[3:54] labor in the path that's always
[3:57] straight.
[3:59] Well, there's just a little more of
[4:04] trles in this low and sendable
[4:09] state. Then we'll enter heaven's
[4:14] portals, sweeping through those pearly
[4:19] gates. Soon we'll meet all the
[4:23] redeemed ones and we'll take them by the
[4:28] [Music]
[4:29] hand. Soon we'll press into our
[4:34] bosom. Over in the prois
[4:39] land we'll be at home
[4:44] forever throughout all eternity.
[4:50] What a blessed blessed
[4:54] morning that eternal morning will
[4:59] be. Well, there's just a little while to
[5:03] stay here. Just a little while to wait.
[5:10] Just a little while to
[5:13] [Music]
[5:14] labor in the path that's always
[5:19] straight. Just a little more of
[5:24] trles in this low and sinful state.
[5:30] Then we'll enter heaven's
[5:34] portal, sweeping through those pearly
[5:38] gates.
[5:42] He gave me
[5:44] beauty for
[5:47] ashes, the oil of joy for
[5:52] mourning, the
[5:55] garment of praise for the spirit of
[6:01] heaviness that we might be trees of
[6:07] righteousness.
[6:09] the planting of the
[6:13] Lord that he might be glory.
[6:24] He gave me
[6:27] beauty for
[6:30] ashes, the oil of joy for
[6:35] morning, the
[6:38] garment of praise for the spirit of
[6:44] heaviness that we
[6:47] might be trees of
[6:52] righteousness. the planting of the
[6:57] Lord that he might be
[7:01] [Music]
[7:04] [Applause]
[7:06] [Music]
[7:17] glory as I hear your word come forth.
[7:22] forth. I'm
[7:25] reminded of who I really
[7:31] [Music]
[7:33] am. Align with might the
[7:37] offen. I
[7:40] believe I am from eternity.
[7:48] I have always been a
[7:52] part of
[7:59] you. The word comes to the
[8:03] word. So there must be a part of
[8:09] you deep on the
[8:13] inside to respond.
[8:17] with yes and
[8:21] amen to everything you
[8:25] say to
[8:28] me. The
[8:31] word comes to the
[8:39] word. It resonates deep within me. Even
[8:45] when my mind can't
[8:49] comprehend, I know it to be
[8:53] true. Life of your life, I find
[8:59] myself in you,
[9:02] Lord, never to depart.
[9:10] The word comes to the word.
[9:14] So there must be a part of
[9:17] [Music]
[9:19] you deep on the
[9:23] inside to
[9:26] respond with yes and
[9:31] amen to everything you say to me.
[9:39] The
[9:41] word comes to the
[9:49] world. Coming from the depth of my
[9:56] soul, a
[9:58] revelation anchored
[10:00] there by you.
[10:06] This is nothing but the
[10:11] truth. I recognize you in our
[10:15] midst and I am
[10:18] filled with a
[10:21] genuine
[10:26] faith. The word comes to the
[10:30] word. So there must be a part of
[10:36] you deep on the
[10:40] inside to
[10:43] respond with yes and
[10:48] amen to everything you
[10:52] say to me.
[10:56] The
[10:57] word comes to the
[11:06] world as I walk with you. You speak to
[11:13] me. Lord, please keep
[11:18] unveiling yourself.
[11:23] I want all you have for
[11:28] me. Give me eyes to see and ears to
[11:33] hear. Give me more
[11:37] [Music]
[11:41] revelation. Let every bit of this word
[11:46] anchor in my soul.
[11:51] [Music]
[11:52] right where
[11:55] it
[12:00] belongs. Let it be my
[12:05] life.
[12:07] Let it
[12:09] be my
[12:15] all. The word comes to the word. So
[12:20] there must be a part of
[12:25] you deep on the
[12:28] inside to
[12:31] respond with yes and
[12:36] amen to everything you
[12:40] say to me.
[12:45] The
[12:46] word comes to the
[12:52] [Music]
[12:53] world. The
[12:56] word comes to the world.
[13:12] It was a tiny simple
[13:16] stable all
[13:18] beaten and
[13:21] warm
[13:23] hardly the
[13:25] place for a king to be
[13:29] born. It didn't take some
[13:34] special to reveal his
[13:39] majesty. So I know if I give him
[13:44] control, he'll be born in
[13:50] me. Let your
[13:53] word be
[13:55] born in the manger of my heart.
[14:02] Let it live in
[14:04] me. Let it
[14:09] start. I live inside this house of
[14:15] clay and mold me day by day.
[14:21] Let your word be
[14:24] born in the
[14:27] manger of my
[14:34] heart. Outwardly I'm
[14:38] nothing, not much to behold.
[14:43] [Music]
[14:45] hardly the
[14:48] place for his word to
[14:53] unfold. But if I just heal my
[14:57] vessel and let him have his
[15:02] way from glory unto
[15:07] glory, he'll change me day by day.
[15:13] Let your
[15:16] word be
[15:18] born in the manger of my
[15:24] heart. Let it live in
[15:28] me. Let it
[15:33] start live inside this house of
[15:38] clay and mold me day by day.
[15:44] Let your word be
[15:47] born in the
[15:50] manger of my heart. Let your
[15:56] word. Let your
[15:59] word be
[16:01] born in the manger of my
[16:06] heart. Let it live in me.
[16:11] Let it
[16:15] start. Live inside this house of
[16:20] clay and mold me day by
[16:25] day. Let your word be
[16:29] born in the
[16:33] manger of my heart.
[16:39] Let's just pray together.
[16:41] Lord Jesus, that's truly our heart's
[16:44] desire here this evening. Father, we've
[16:47] not come to be seen or to be heard even,
[16:52] but Lord, we've came to gather around
[16:56] you the revealed word that you would
[16:59] change us into the very image of your
[17:01] dear son.
[17:03] So as we would come to this juncture of
[17:05] the service, Father, we would just lay
[17:08] ourselves before
[17:10] you confessing that there's no good
[17:13] thing within us that is within our
[17:16] flesh, Lord, and that you would come and
[17:20] just supernaturally anoint both the
[17:23] speaker and the hearer, that your divine
[17:26] purpose for this service would be
[17:28] accomplished here this evening. We just
[17:30] commit ourselves to you with
[17:33] thanksgiving and we ask that you would
[17:35] come and have the preeminence in Jesus
[17:37] Christ's name. Amen.
[17:40] God bless you this evening. Uh, if you
[17:44] have your Bibles, we're going to go to
[17:46] Revelation chapter
[17:56] 6, Revelation 6, beginning with verse
[18:00] 12. This is
[18:02] the scripture as it relates to the sixth
[18:06] seal. And I'd like to take
[18:10] a topic this evening of applying the
[18:14] sixth seal to the gentile individual.
[18:18] And this will be a part one because
[18:22] obviously you're not going
[18:23] to do all of that in one service.
[18:28] But we at least want to take
[18:30] a little chisel and see what kind of
[18:33] nuggets that we can dig into here on a
[18:37] Wednesday evening and just go as the
[18:39] Lord leads
[18:41] then. But let's read this scripture.
[18:44] Revelation 6 verse
[18:47] 12 says, "And I beheld when he had
[18:50] opened the sixth seal, and lo, there was
[18:52] a great
[18:53] earthquake, and the sun became black as
[18:55] sackcloth of hair, and the moon became
[18:58] as blood, and the stars of heaven fell
[19:01] into the earth, even as a fig tree
[19:04] casteth her untimely figs, when she is
[19:07] shaken of a mighty wind. And the heaven
[19:10] departed as a scroll, when it is rolled
[19:12] together, and every mountain and every
[19:14] island were moved out of their places.
[19:16] And the kings of the earth, and the
[19:18] great men, and the rich men, and the
[19:19] chief captains, and the mighty men, and
[19:21] every bondsmen, and every free man hid
[19:23] themselves in the dens, and the rocks of
[19:25] the mountains, and said to the mountains
[19:27] and rocks, "Fall on us, and hide us from
[19:29] the face of him that sitth on the
[19:32] throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.
[19:34] For the great day of his wrath is come,
[19:36] and who shall be able to stand?" God
[19:39] bless you as you would have your seats
[19:42] this
[19:43] evening. So applying the sixth seal to
[19:47] the gentile individual and a subtitle
[19:51] here. The topic that we want to focus on
[19:54] is Shiloh. And you'll understand that a
[19:58] little bit better here in a minute.
[20:02] But I find me personally, you don't have
[20:06] to be of this same
[20:07] opinion, but when it comes to the seals,
[20:10] they're obviously extremely
[20:13] interesting. Um, this is what brother
[20:15] Brandon would say was his regular
[20:19] commission, which part of me finds
[20:22] hysterical that the seven seals could be
[20:25] somebody's regular commission. But
[20:29] nonetheless, it was. this was his
[20:31] purpose is I'll say his primary purpose
[20:34] for his ministry.
[20:36] Um
[20:38] but as I look at the
[20:41] seals in relation to the gentile
[20:44] individual I won't say that it's easy
[20:46] but it's fairly easy as you go through 1
[20:48] through 4 to apply that to the gentile
[20:51] church because it directly overlaps the
[20:52] church ages. But when you come to the
[20:54] fifth, sixth, and seventh seal, things
[20:57] can get a little bit fuzzy of how does
[20:59] this apply to me as a gentile? Because
[21:01] the fifth seal, he's talking about souls
[21:03] under the altar, which he reveals as the
[21:06] Jews that were treat that were killed
[21:08] during the
[21:10] Holocaust. But then he comes to the end
[21:12] of that fifth seal and he says, "I've
[21:14] got one little bitty thing to tell you
[21:15] here if you can handle it." Amen. And he
[21:18] drops in there that not only are those
[21:20] souls under the altar, but there's
[21:22] another part of the altar that their
[21:24] souls under. And they're both in the
[21:26] sixth dimension. And the reason that
[21:28] these souls that these uh souls under
[21:31] the martyr's altar are crying out, Lord,
[21:33] how long? How long? Is they've seen that
[21:35] sixth dimension empty out and those
[21:38] theophanes leave. So it ties it ties
[21:41] directly to the gentile individual. But
[21:44] he spends I've not done the math on it,
[21:47] but I'm going to say 80 to 85% of the
[21:50] time ministering on that seal talking
[21:54] about the Jews under the altar.
[21:56] So if you're just taking it shallowly
[21:59] minded andformational wise, you're going
[22:01] to miss the principle under it, the
[22:03] mystery under it. Same thing when it
[22:06] comes to the sixth seal. I find that
[22:08] same thing happening and also in the
[22:10] seventh seal. But just something that
[22:12] stirred in my heart um when I was
[22:16] listening to this sixth seal again and
[22:18] some things started to open. And one of
[22:20] the the principles that's just really
[22:22] stirred in my heart is as we listen and
[22:26] read and study the message we have to
[22:28] keep at the forefront of our minds that
[22:31] brother Brandham is a gentile prophet.
[22:35] And we know this, this is not a news
[22:38] flash, but this gentile prophet starts
[22:42] talking about other things and other
[22:44] classes of people. And we can very
[22:48] easily just think that he's talking
[22:50] about these other classes of people and
[22:53] these other things, these other parables
[22:55] that he's using. And we forget, or maybe
[22:59] it goes to the back part of our mind,
[23:01] that this is a gentile prophet.
[23:04] sent to the Gentiles. So regardless of
[23:08] what class of people that he's talking
[23:11] about or what parable that he's
[23:14] relaying, a gentile prophet is a
[23:17] spiritual prophet and he is relaying
[23:20] spiritual principles. Amen. Amen. And if
[23:24] we can hold that at the forefront of our
[23:26] mind, I think at least for me, it's
[23:29] helped things open up a little bit is to
[23:32] remember not to maybe get lost in the
[23:35] information, but understand this is a
[23:37] gentile prophet sent to me and he's
[23:40] relaying spiritual
[23:42] principles. In the first seal, brother
[23:45] Brandham
[23:46] says, "I believe that through these
[23:49] seven
[23:50] thunders will will be revealed in the
[23:52] last days in order to get the bride
[23:54] together for rapturing
[23:56] faith." Because what we got right now,
[23:59] we wouldn't be able to do
[24:01] it. We know the seven thunders is and
[24:05] are the preaching of the seven seals.
[24:08] The seven thunders are the revelation of
[24:12] what the seals were. And he says that
[24:15] this is directly tied to rapturing
[24:18] faith. So I think it would
[24:21] probably behoove behoove us if this is
[24:25] his regular
[24:26] commission that this is directly tied to
[24:29] rapturing faith for the gentile church
[24:31] and this is a gentile prophet preaching
[24:33] to gentile people to a gentile bride.
[24:37] Even though that we've probably read
[24:39] these things dozens and dozens of times,
[24:41] it probably would behoove us to circle
[24:44] back and read them again every once in a
[24:45] while. Amen. Because by per chance
[24:48] there's something we've missed. Amen. He
[24:51] says we've got to go a step further. We
[24:53] can't have enough faith for divine
[24:55] healing. Harley, we have we've got to
[24:57] have enough faith to be changed in a
[24:58] moment and to be swept up out of this
[25:01] earth. In the third seal, he says the
[25:03] bride hasn't had a revival yet. There's
[25:06] been no revival there, no manifestation
[25:08] of God to stir the bride yet. We're
[25:11] looking for it now. It'll take those
[25:13] seven unknown thunders back there to
[25:15] wake her up again. Again, this is a very
[25:18] profound statement. If I would make this
[25:20] statement that the bride has not had a
[25:22] revival yet, that wouldn't necessarily
[25:23] mean anything. But let's look at his min
[25:26] ministry prior to this statement being
[25:29] made and what God had been doing for
[25:32] years. the supernatural and the miracle
[25:35] and the literal worldwide revival
[25:39] following his ministry. And he would
[25:41] come and say, "The bride's not been
[25:42] touched yet. There's nothing been to
[25:45] wake her up yet." Amen.
[25:51] I find that to be very profound.
[25:55] I wonder just out of
[25:57] curiosity now that the seals have been
[26:00] opened and the thunders have been
[26:04] revealed. I wonder if we're not looking
[26:08] for something that transpired prior to
[26:10] the seals as a
[26:12] revival. Just think for a second. What
[26:15] if that was still going on day in and
[26:18] day out, night in and night out? That
[26:21] worldwide supernatural healing campaign
[26:24] and the discernment.
[26:27] How many of us would be stuck on that?
[26:29] I'm not faulting anybody for that. I
[26:32] would probably probably be one of them.
[26:34] Yeah.
[26:35] But when a when this man would come and
[26:37] make that kind of statement that you can
[26:40] have that day in and day out for years
[26:42] and that will not quicken the bride.
[26:46] Amen. That's a big statement.
[26:49] It's a big statement. So I think it
[26:51] behooves us if that won't quicken the
[26:53] bride, let's focus on what will quicken
[26:55] the bride. Let's reexamine what will
[26:57] quicken the bride.
[27:05] The sixth
[27:07] seal
[27:09] beginning begins with a prayer. And this
[27:12] is where I'm drawing my context from. He
[27:15] says, "Let's bow our heads just a moment
[27:17] now." And he
[27:19] says,"Lord, we are again gathering in
[27:22] for the service, and we think of the
[27:25] time in the early days when they all
[27:27] came up to Shiloh for the blessings of
[27:30] the
[27:31] Lord." This is the second sentence in
[27:34] the sixth seal.
[27:36] I've read it dozens and dozens and
[27:38] dozens of
[27:39] times and not one time has it crossed my
[27:43] mind to ask the question when this
[27:47] gentile prophet is standing here getting
[27:49] ready to be used of God to break the
[27:51] sixth seal. Why is he thinking about the
[27:55] Jews at Shiloh?
[28:01] But I finally did.
[28:06] Let's go to Joshua chapter
[28:18] 18. Joshua chapter
[28:21] 18. So when Shiloh is mentioned in the
[28:24] Bible, the first time Shiloh is ever
[28:25] mentioned in the Bible is in Genesis
[28:27] 49:10, I believe. And it's a prophecy
[28:30] going forth of Jesus coming. And that
[28:34] was a scriptural name given to him,
[28:36] title given to him of when Shiloh comes.
[28:40] But as far as an actual location, as
[28:42] brother Brandham's referring to it here,
[28:44] that all of Israel assembled together at
[28:48] Shiloh. As far as an actual location,
[28:49] the first time that it's ever mentioned
[28:51] in the in the scriptures is here in
[28:53] Joshua
[28:55] 18. And beginning in verse one, Joshua
[29:00] 18, beginning in verse one. And the
[29:02] whole congregation of the children of
[29:05] Israel assembled together at Shiloh and
[29:08] set up the tabernacle of the
[29:09] congregation there. And the land was
[29:12] subdued before them. Now you stick your
[29:14] finger in your Bible and close it. You
[29:16] can't read any
[29:20] further. Shiloh was the location that
[29:24] the tabernacle was first set up after
[29:26] they had crossed Jordan. Inside the
[29:29] tabernacle was the ark of the covenant.
[29:32] What was in the ark of the covenant? The
[29:34] word. Amen. Amen.
[29:37] Here's a gentile
[29:39] prophet coming to break the sixth seal
[29:43] and the second sentence in as we come to
[29:46] this time now, Lord, tonight. I'm
[29:50] thinking of when the Jews gathered
[29:53] together at Shiloh. Amen.
[29:56] This is what we would call in our day
[29:59] and age a clue. Amen.
[30:05] Now, before we dig farther into Joshua
[30:08] 18, there's a couple things that I want
[30:10] to touch on. You don't have to turn
[30:12] there. I'll just read this to you. 1
[30:13] Corinthians 10:11. Paul speaking says,
[30:17] speaking of the things that happened to
[30:19] the Jews and to
[30:21] Israel. Now,
[30:23] all these things happened unto them for
[30:26] an example.
[30:29] I want to read it again.
[30:32] All these things happened to them,
[30:34] referring to Israel, for an example, and
[30:38] they are
[30:39] written for our
[30:43] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[30:46] world are come. Do you believe that you
[30:49] are one of whom the ends of the world
[30:51] has come?
[30:53] Do you believe that there are things
[30:55] written in here regarding Israel?
[30:59] Paul, who I would declare is a pretty
[31:01] good
[31:03] authority, says everything that is
[31:06] written in here concerning Israel was
[31:09] written for us in this last age for our
[31:13] admonition. Amen. In the church age
[31:16] book, Brother Brandham says, "Now
[31:17] according to the word of God, the bride
[31:19] was chosen before the foundation of the
[31:20] world. This choosing of the bride was
[31:23] purposed in himself. Ephesians 1:9 and
[31:26] in Romans 9:11 it says that the purpose
[31:29] of God according to election might
[31:31] stand. You can't read it any other way.
[31:34] The heart purpose, the eternal purpose
[31:38] of God was to take a bride of his own
[31:41] choosing. And that purpose was in
[31:43] himself and being eternal was decreed
[31:46] before the foundation of the world. This
[31:49] now answers why everything that happened
[31:52] to Israel that was written in the
[31:54] scripture is for us
[31:58] because the whole purpose I won't say
[32:01] whole purpose the heart purpose main
[32:05] purpose of God was to choose his own
[32:08] bride a gentile bride
[32:12] so he would write he would allow
[32:16] generations thousands thousands of
[32:18] years, thousands of years to transpire.
[32:21] Real people, real lives, real hardships,
[32:25] real
[32:26] blessings. He would allow this nation of
[32:29] Israel to go
[32:30] through a a vast array of things so that
[32:35] he could write it in a book that we
[32:38] could read about it. And Paul would come
[32:40] along and say, "Oh, by the way, all of
[32:42] those things happened to them so that it
[32:44] could be written down for you in the
[32:46] last stage to learn from." Amen.
[32:49] Brother Brandon would come and enforce
[32:50] this and say that the reason this
[32:55] is the reason that God compiled all of
[32:58] that, the reason that God was doing all
[32:59] of this was because at the end of the
[33:02] day in his
[33:04] heart, his main focus and his main
[33:08] purpose was to call a bride, a gentile
[33:11] bride of his own choosing.
[33:15] You say, "Well, that's pretty
[33:18] discriminatory."
[33:20] Maybe, but I'm not one to judge. And
[33:23] furthermore, if I was to judge, I think
[33:25] I got the fair end of the deal, so I'm
[33:28] happy with
[33:31] it. Christ is the mystery of God
[33:33] revealed. Brother Brandham says he is
[33:35] the principal theme of the entire Bible.
[33:37] If you read the Bible and don't see
[33:39] Christ in every verse of it, go back and
[33:42] read it again. If you can't see Christ
[33:45] in every verse of the vi the Bible, then
[33:48] read it again because you've missed
[33:50] something. Further
[33:53] uh
[33:54] emphasizing even if it's writing about
[33:57] Abraham, it's about you. Amen. If it's
[34:00] writing about Jacob, it's about you.
[34:02] Amen. If it's writing about the nation
[34:04] of Israel, guess what? It's about you.
[34:08] And he says, if you don't see that, you
[34:10] said, "Well, he said if if you missed
[34:11] Christ,
[34:13] Yes.
[34:15] But we're far enough down the road to
[34:16] now now to realize Christ is both male
[34:18] and female.
[34:22] So if we read those scriptures and we
[34:26] don't see Christ in every verse, we've
[34:30] got to go back and see what we've
[34:31] missed.
[34:34] Amen.
[34:36] Continuing in Christ is the mystery of
[34:38] God revealed.
[34:39] says it's to an individual, one
[34:43] person. All hell is against this
[34:45] teaching. All hell is against this
[34:47] truth. But it is the truth. Jesus never
[34:50] said, "Now Peter, you and John, and all
[34:52] the rest of the people, you've got the
[34:54] revelation. Now the whole church is
[34:55] saved." No, it was to him personally.
[34:59] Amen. Amen. I say unto thee, thee, not
[35:04] them, to thee. There it is. the
[35:06] revelation not to not to them but to him
[35:11] an individual not a group an individual.
[35:14] All hell is against it. That's right.
[35:17] All hell is against what? Christ to the
[35:20] individual. Amen. All hell is against
[35:22] what? You seeing Christ in every verse
[35:24] and every line. Amen. All hell is
[35:26] against what? You recognizing Christ is
[35:29] both male and female and he's in every
[35:31] verse and in every line. And it applies
[35:33] directly to you. Yeah, all hell is
[35:36] against that indivi that revelation.
[35:40] Brother Brandham says at the very end of
[35:42] the church age book, this is the last
[35:43] paragraph. He says, "Now for one moment,
[35:45] not for one moment, do I bring a message
[35:48] to the people that they may follow me or
[35:50] join my church or start some fellowship
[35:52] and organization. I have never done that
[35:54] and will not do that now. I have no
[35:56] interest in those things. But I do have
[35:59] an interest in the things of God and
[36:01] people. And if I can accomplish just one
[36:05] thing, I will be
[36:07] satisfied. That one thing is to see
[36:10] established a true spiritual
[36:13] relationship between God and man,
[36:17] wherein men become new creations in
[36:19] Christ, filled with his spirit and live
[36:20] according to his word. You talk about
[36:23] putting things under a microscope. Look
[36:25] at everything that God did during this
[36:27] man's ministry. And he says, "I only
[36:30] have one focus, one purpose, one
[36:33] intent, and that is to see the
[36:35] relationship between God and
[36:39] man restored." Amen. Amen. So if
[36:44] we study and
[36:49] learn and it doesn't restore a spiritual
[36:52] relationship between God and man, we've
[36:55] missed the purpose. Amen. Regardless of
[36:58] what information we're getting, although
[36:59] it would be good, no doubt, the purpose
[37:02] of all of the information that we've
[37:06] been disseminated, the purpose of
[37:09] that is so that you would
[37:12] recognize Christ is in you. Amen. That
[37:15] you would have a spiritual relationship
[37:18] with God himself. Amen. Now in order to
[37:22] have a proper spiritual
[37:24] relationship you must first have a
[37:26] proper spiritual identity. Amen. Because
[37:30] you can have a relationship and it not
[37:32] be the right relationship. Amen.
[37:35] But he is here to restore. He says to
[37:38] see established a true spiritual
[37:42] relationship between God and men. So if
[37:45] this gentile prophet is trying to
[37:47] restore me as a gentile individual to a
[37:50] true spiritual relationship between God
[37:52] and men, I have to have my position
[37:55] revealed to me so that I know what
[37:57] relationship to speak. Now this is a
[38:00] very very simple principle, but it's
[38:03] extremely important. And I think that if
[38:06] we would take some time and think about
[38:08] it, we've probably seen
[38:11] people get in the wrong position with
[38:15] the relationship with
[38:17] God. But you just take this in a carnal
[38:21] aspect. I want to have a relationship
[38:23] with my
[38:25] daughter, but if my daughter decides one
[38:29] day that she wants to be William instead
[38:32] of
[38:33] Priscilla, like the relationship's not
[38:36] going to go too smooth.
[38:39] If William decides one day he wants to
[38:41] act like Priscilla instead of William,
[38:44] he wants to be a daughter instead of a
[38:46] son, we're going to have an issue. Amen.
[38:48] I love my nieces and nephews, but if my
[38:51] niece or my neph if my niece would
[38:53] decide that their position is now my
[38:56] wife, we've got a big
[38:58] problem. If my wife decides her
[39:02] relationship to me to to me should now
[39:04] be grandmother,
[39:06] I would maybe like that,
[39:08] but it's not going to work out too good
[39:11] when it comes to taking care of the
[39:12] kids.
[39:14] We laugh because this is a very very
[39:16] very simple principle.
[39:19] Very simple principle.
[39:23] But it is so relevant
[39:27] and so important
[39:30] that when this major gentile prophet
[39:33] would stand on the scene to fulfill his
[39:36] regular commission, the first thing he
[39:38] would do is he would say, "Now I'm going
[39:40] to call you bride. Amen. So that you'll
[39:44] stand a chance of understanding.
[39:48] Well, what did he change us from? He
[39:50] changed us from church,
[39:53] right? From church to bride. You say,
[39:55] "Well, not much difference." Big
[39:57] difference.
[40:00] Big difference.
[40:03] But what we would look at and say is a
[40:06] small difference makes all of the
[40:09] difference. Amen. of catching the
[40:11] revelation and not catching the
[40:13] revelation. So the first thing that has
[40:15] to be
[40:18] established is what is your proper
[40:21] position in relation to God so that you
[40:24] can have the proper relationship with
[40:26] God so that you know how to act towards
[40:29] God and how you shouldn't act towards
[40:32] God. Amen. The Jews can act towards God
[40:35] in one way that we can't.
[40:37] The Gentiles can act one way to God that
[40:40] the Jews can't. The Jews are the
[40:43] servants. The Gentile is the bride.
[40:45] Amen. If you have a servant in your
[40:48] house and they start acting like your
[40:51] bride, it's going to cause issues.
[40:54] Amen. Especially if you're already
[40:56] married.
[40:59] And if you're not married, the church
[41:02] people are going to be asking some
[41:03] questions.
[41:05] Why is this servant acting like your
[41:07] wife?
[41:09] Such a simple principle but makes the
[41:11] world of difference.
[41:14] Okay, you can open your Bibles back to
[41:16] uh Joshua
[41:17] now. Now, we want to hold this in our
[41:20] mind, these very basic principles as we
[41:24] go through this. Joshua 18, we'll just
[41:27] read verse one again. And the whole
[41:28] congregation of the children of Israel
[41:30] assembled together at Shiloh and set up
[41:33] the tabernacle of the congregation
[41:34] there. And the land was subdued before
[41:37] them. And there remained among the
[41:39] children of Israel seven tribes which
[41:42] had not yet received their inheritance.
[41:44] Why seven, I ask?
[41:47] That's strange.
[41:49] Why didn't it split half and half? Six
[41:51] had already got it. Six hadn't. I mean,
[41:53] they just crossed Jordan. Why didn't
[41:55] half of them get it over there and half
[41:56] of them get it here? Why seven?
[42:00] And Joshua said unto the children of
[42:02] Israel, how long are ye slack to go to
[42:04] possess the land wherein the Lord which
[42:06] the Lord God of your fathers hath given
[42:08] you? Give out from among you three men
[42:10] for each tribe, and I will send them,
[42:12] and they shall rise and go through the
[42:13] land, and describe it according to the
[42:15] inheritance of them, and they shall come
[42:18] again to me. And they shall divide it
[42:21] unto seven parts. Judah shall abide in
[42:24] their coast on the south, and the house
[42:25] of Joseph shall abide in the coast on
[42:28] the north. Ye shall therefore describe
[42:31] the land into seven parts, and bring the
[42:34] description hither to me, that I may
[42:36] cast lots for you here before the Lord
[42:39] our God.
[42:41] But the Levites have no part among you.
[42:43] For the priesthood of the Lord is their
[42:45] inheritance. And Gad and Reuben and the
[42:46] half-tribe of Manasseh have received
[42:49] their inher inheritance beyond Jordan on
[42:51] the east which Moses the servant of God
[42:54] servant of the Lord gave them. And the
[42:57] men arose and went away. And Joshua
[42:59] charged them that went to describe the
[43:02] land, saying, "Go and walk through the
[43:04] land, and describe it, and come again to
[43:06] me, that I may hear, cast lots for you
[43:08] before the Lord in Shiloh." And the men
[43:11] went and passed through the land, and
[43:13] described it by cities unto seven parts
[43:15] in a book, and came again to Joshua, to
[43:18] the host of Shiloh. And Joshua cast lots
[43:21] for them in Shiloh before the Lord. And
[43:23] there Joshua divided the land unto the
[43:26] children of Israel according to their
[43:29] divisions. Now, as you read through
[43:31] this, I don't think that the writer has
[43:36] a stuttering problem here, and I don't
[43:39] think the writer is trying to be
[43:42] redundant. But look how many times it
[43:44] says that she'll divide it into seven
[43:46] parts.
[43:48] And when you describe the land, do it in
[43:50] seven parts.
[43:52] And here's something really interesting
[43:54] in verse 9. When you do that, write
[43:57] these seven things, these seven parts,
[44:00] write them in a book. So now we have a
[44:02] sevenpart book in in chapter 18 of
[44:07] Joshua, which the prophet just seemed
[44:12] strange to think about. Amen. When he
[44:14] was coming to preach the sixth seal.
[44:16] Amen.
[44:24] Verse 10. And Joshua cast lots for them
[44:28] in Shiloh before the Lord, and there
[44:30] Joshua divided the land unto the
[44:32] children of Israel according to their
[44:36] divisions. Why is
[44:38] it that our prophet would think of
[44:43] Shiloh when he's standing here getting
[44:46] ready to preach the six seal?
[44:49] Why is that? Why is it when we go and
[44:51] look at Shiloh in the Bible that there's
[44:54] seven tribes who haven't received their
[44:58] inheritance? And these seven
[45:01] tribes come back to their prophet with a
[45:04] seven sealed
[45:06] book. What's going on
[45:09] here? Maybe something similar to what's
[45:13] about to transpire in 1963 in Indiana.
[45:21] This to
[45:23] me was actually pretty
[45:26] amazing because I don't know how many
[45:29] years ago this was. Thousands of years
[45:33] ago and I'm pretty sure these people had
[45:36] no clue what they were doing as it
[45:38] related to me.
[45:41] That's right. But it didn't change the
[45:42] fact that God saw fit to only give five
[45:46] of them an inheritance before they came
[45:47] over Jordan so that seven of them would
[45:49] be left so that he could write that
[45:51] seven in there as a clue to me that
[45:54] whatever is going on in this chapter
[45:56] that your gentile prophet just referred
[45:58] back to Shiloh is maybe the same thing
[46:00] that your gentile prophet's getting
[46:02] ready to do. Maybe this is a repeat of a
[46:05] prophet standing before a people with a
[46:08] sevensealed book getting ready to divide
[46:11] to them their portion of that book.
[46:20] It makes the sermon that he preached at
[46:23] the very beginning of this ring really
[46:26] true. God hiding himself in simplicity
[46:30] and revealing himself in the same. Amen.
[46:33] But how many times have we been guilty
[46:36] because of our education in this culture
[46:39] and in this age of just looking at the
[46:42] information and looking right over what
[46:45] God is doing in simplicity.
[46:49] But thankfully by his grace he'll come
[46:52] and he'll prick prick our conscience.
[46:54] Amenise God.
[46:57] Couple things that I want to point out
[46:58] here.
[47:01] If
[47:01] there are seven tribes
[47:05] left that have not received their
[47:08] inheritance on this side of
[47:12] Jordan. That means there were five
[47:16] tribes that got left on the other side
[47:18] of
[47:20] Jordan. Five we know as it relates to us
[47:23] as individuals is our senses.
[47:26] See, taste, feel, smell, and
[47:29] hear. Spiritually speaking, where we're
[47:31] going behind this
[47:33] prophet, five senses are not going to
[47:36] work. Amen. It's going to take something
[47:38] else.
[47:40] It's going to take something else.
[47:44] But we know anytime that we see these
[47:46] numbers pop up in the Old Testament,
[47:48] these fives and these sevens and these
[47:50] threes, there's a good chance there's a
[47:53] principle
[47:54] laying there for the gentile church.
[47:56] Amen. If we'll just pay attention to it.
[47:59] I'm not a numerologist, so I can't get
[48:01] into all of that. I don't have the
[48:03] capacity to get into that, but I just
[48:06] know enough through the prophet's
[48:07] teaching that when we see those numbers
[48:09] pop up, even in the Old Testament, we
[48:11] probably want to read it twice and make
[48:13] sure we're not missing Christ in every
[48:14] verse and every line.
[48:17] In
[48:19] paradox, Brother Brandham says, "It was
[48:22] about 3:00 in the morning. I suppose
[48:24] looked like I was standing on the map of
[48:25] Palestine." He's speaking of a vision
[48:28] that he had and seemed like I could hear
[48:31] the song, I'm going down to Jordan.
[48:33] Somebody was singing it. And as I drew
[48:34] near to the River Jordan, I looked back
[48:36] and seen which way I'd come. And I was
[48:38] about 2third of the way to Jordan. And I
[48:41] looked across Jordan and I said, "Oh,
[48:43] praise God." Just on the other side is
[48:45] where all the promises lay. Every
[48:47] promise lays in the promised land. This
[48:50] is at the very beginning of the message
[48:52] paradox. At the very very end of the
[48:55] message paradox, even after all of the
[48:57] prayer line and after all of the
[48:59] discernment, paragraph, excuse me, 3:11,
[49:02] he says, "Now you see what coming down
[49:05] to Jordan meant." Referring back to the
[49:07] vision. He says, "Now you see what
[49:10] coming down to Jordan meant." Them
[49:12] visions have never failed. They can't
[49:14] fail because they come from God. I
[49:17] believe it with all that is within me.
[49:19] We're not the hireling that will run
[49:21] back into the wilderness. will cross
[49:23] Jordan, the
[49:24] separation. God, break to us the seals
[49:27] that's on the back of the book. Amen.
[49:30] Let us enter into this great place.
[49:33] Now, for Joshua divided to the people
[49:36] their inheritance that God had left for
[49:38] them.
[49:40] Here's the astounding part of this to
[49:42] me. This was in December of 1961.
[49:47] Amen.
[49:50] December of
[49:52] 1961, Brother Brandham knows what
[49:55] crossing Jordan means. He knows it's in
[49:57] relation to going into the promised
[49:59] land, which is the seals on the back
[50:00] part of the book, as it relates to the
[50:02] gentile bride being placed in the word
[50:05] their land properly. Yeah. In so much
[50:09] that he quotes and says, "This is the
[50:11] same thing. This represents the same
[50:15] thing that Joshua did in chapter 18.
[50:18] Amen.
[50:21] To do that in 196 December of 1961, this
[50:24] is even before sers. What time is it?
[50:28] That is astounding to me. Amen.
[50:31] There is no doubt in my mind when you
[50:34] read through the message and you see
[50:35] these things pop up. I have another one
[50:38] here that I found last yesterday. I'm
[50:39] not going to get into, but it just blew
[50:41] my mind. When you see these things pop
[50:44] up like this, Brother
[50:46] Brandham in everything that was going on
[50:49] in his ministry and around
[50:51] him knew this was his purpose on earth.
[50:56] Everything hinged on this to be able to
[51:00] come to the point to stand and preach
[51:02] the seals for the gentile bride. Amen.
[51:08] So the question is if
[51:10] these parallel each other and these
[51:14] represent the same actions going on,
[51:18] what did our gentile prophet break to
[51:20] us? Because Joshua broke a natural land.
[51:22] I think we would all agree with that.
[51:23] They were naturally positioned in a
[51:25] natural land. As a spiritual people, the
[51:28] Gentiles, we've got to be spiritually
[51:30] placed in a spiritual land. So as it
[51:33] relates to this sixth seal, how did that
[51:37] transpire to us and what portion of the
[51:40] land was given to us? Because when you
[51:43] look at the sixth seal just on the
[51:45] surface and brother Brandham even says
[51:48] in the seventh seal that the sixth seal
[51:50] had a three-fold the sixth seal had a
[51:52] three-fold purpose and that was to
[51:54] revealed that the purged church had to
[51:57] go through the tribulation that the
[52:00] 144,000
[52:02] uh had to be called by the two prophets
[52:04] and purged and the earth had to be
[52:06] purged. He says nothing about the
[52:09] gentile church. If you read the
[52:11] scripture again that we just read at the
[52:13] beginning of the service in Revelation,
[52:15] you do not see the gentile church in
[52:17] there.
[52:18] You
[52:20] see you see tribulation on the earth.
[52:23] You see mighty men calling for rocks to
[52:26] fall on them.
[52:32] Um, and you see the great day of the
[52:35] wrath of the
[52:36] Lord. As the bride of Jesus Christ,
[52:39] we're spared from that. So, you don't
[52:42] see that on the
[52:44] surface. So, the question is, where is
[52:49] it? Where is it? If this is the same
[52:53] thing going
[52:55] on, we're going to pick up at paragraph
[52:59] 284 in the sixth
[53:03] seal.
[53:05] And I'm not saying that's the best place
[53:08] to pick up, but like I had to pick a
[53:10] starting
[53:11] point. So, Brother Brandon, this is
[53:13] paragraph 284. He's probably a little
[53:16] over halfway through the sixth seal now.
[53:21] He's preached on the purged church being
[53:24] separate from the bride and how that
[53:26] they have to go through the tribulation.
[53:28] He's preached on the 144,000 being
[53:30] called by the two prophets and he's
[53:33] actually right at the tail end of that.
[53:36] And he's preached on the earth going
[53:39] through her purging period. But he comes
[53:41] here to 284 and he says these two
[53:44] prophets look what they're going to do
[53:46] now. Third verse of the 11th chapter of
[53:48] the book of Revelation. And I will give
[53:50] power unto my two witnesses. And they
[53:52] shall prophesy 1,23 score days clothed
[53:56] in sackcloth. They are the two these are
[53:59] the two olive trees and the two
[54:01] candlesticks that stand before the God
[54:03] of earth of the earth. And if any man
[54:07] hurt them, fire proceedth out of their
[54:10] mouth. Remember, out of the mouth of
[54:13] Christ came the sword, the word.
[54:17] So he's talking about what these two
[54:19] prophets are going to do to the 144,000.
[54:22] And as he's talking about that here,
[54:24] paragraph 284, he he changes a little
[54:27] gear. And as he's talking about those
[54:29] two prophets, he says,
[54:30] "Remember, out of the mouth of
[54:33] Christ came the sword, the word." He was
[54:36] just talking about how these two
[54:38] prophets had fire come out of their
[54:40] mouth and that's what devoured their
[54:42] enemies. So he lays this in here real
[54:45] quick and then he keeps going to devour
[54:47] their enemies. And if any man shall hurt
[54:49] them, he must in this manner be killed.
[54:52] Now we know the fire in the 19th chapter
[54:55] of the coming of Christ preceded his
[54:58] sword from his mouth which was the
[55:03] word. Now we know the fire is his first
[55:07] statement. Period. And he stops and then
[55:10] he says in the 19th chapter of the
[55:12] coming of
[55:14] Christ preceded his sword from his
[55:18] mouth. He's directly
[55:21] tying this fire that's proceeding from
[55:23] these two prophets mouth to the sword
[55:27] that is that proceeds from the mouth of
[55:29] Christ. In chapter 19 of the book of
[55:32] Revelation, he says, "Oh, if you'll get
[55:37] this material now for that seal tomorrow
[55:42] night." This is again what we would call
[55:44] a
[55:47] clue because remember the task that
[55:50] brother Brandham has as he's preaching
[55:52] this stick these
[55:53] seals is the most difficult task of all.
[55:57] He has to say in such a way that there's
[56:00] enough there for the gentile bride to
[56:01] catch the revelation, but he's forbidden
[56:04] by God to tell it plainly. Amen.
[56:08] What a task.
[56:12] So what does he do? He does what Christ
[56:14] did. He lays it in there in parables.
[56:17] He'll lay it in there in a sentence or
[56:19] two and then he'll talk about something
[56:20] else. Amen.
[56:24] He says, "Oh, if you'll get this
[56:25] material now for that seal tomorrow
[56:30] night, the seal for tomorrow night's the
[56:32] seventh
[56:33] seal, which we know is the coming of
[56:35] Christ, which we know is what I say
[56:40] which we know." That's maybe you don't
[56:42] know. If you don't know, that's okay.
[56:43] It's just a phrase that I say a lot.
[56:47] We've been taught that brother
[56:51] Brandham this whole
[56:53] week was trained to get people to see
[56:56] the seventh seal.
[56:59] He says, "I'm hoping that when we get to
[57:01] that last night, that last that I don't
[57:03] just have to come out and hold it out to
[57:05] where you can see it and show you."
[57:07] So, here he is again in the sixth seal
[57:09] saying, "If you want to catch what I'm
[57:12] going to preach tomorrow night, catch
[57:14] what I'm saying right now. Because what
[57:15] I'm saying right now, I'm laying in here
[57:17] in parable. I'm laying in here. I'm
[57:19] laying a little nugget right here
[57:20] because when I get to tomorrow night, I
[57:22] can't just plainly tell you. I'm
[57:24] forbidden.
[57:26] And by the way, this is what's been
[57:28] going on all week.
[57:30] He says, "If you'll get this material
[57:32] now for that seal tomorrow night, see
[57:35] the word is the thing that God slays his
[57:37] enemy by."
[57:40] He says, "When these prophets are
[57:42] prophesying, if any man harms them, fire
[57:45] proceeds from their mouth." Holy Ghost
[57:47] fire, the word these Moses and Elijah is
[57:51] not going to show up to the 144,000 like
[57:54] a breathing dragon. Right. Amen.
[58:00] What's going to come out of their mouth?
[58:03] Amen. The word. Amen. What's always came
[58:06] out of a prophet's mouth? Amen. the
[58:08] word. Why would it change now? Why would
[58:10] God need to change his tactics now when
[58:12] it's undefeated?
[58:14] That's right. Why would God need to
[58:16] change his tactics with his gentile
[58:18] prophet when it's undefeated? Amen.
[58:22] We know now the
[58:23] fire, Holy Ghost fire, the word, the
[58:27] word is God. And just so that there's no
[58:30] dispute, the word is fire. Amen. So
[58:35] now, oh my.
[58:39] So now we see these two prophets in
[58:43] chapter
[58:44] 11 and we see Christ in chapter 19. And
[58:48] we have a authority on the earth that
[58:51] can say what's coming out of one
[58:54] person's mouth is the same thing that's
[58:56] coming out of the other person's mouth.
[58:58] Even if one says fire and one says
[59:00] sword, it's both the word. Amen. Amen.
[59:12] Look at Moses. Let's see what come from
[59:16] his
[59:16] mouth. Egypt was mistreating these Jews.
[59:21] God put the word in Moses's
[59:25] mouth. See, it's God's thoughts going
[59:30] into Moses's heart.
[59:34] Catch this because
[59:37] remember he's not just talking about
[59:39] Moses and Egypt.
[59:45] It's God's
[59:46] thoughts going into Moses's
[59:50] heart. He goes over now to express
[59:54] it. Then it becomes the
[59:57] word. He stretched forth his hand and
[1:00:00] said, "Let there be flies." And here
[1:00:03] come flies.
[1:00:06] Right before this, Brother Brandham
[1:00:07] says, "Catch this material now if you
[1:00:10] want to know what's going to happen
[1:00:11] tomorrow night." Amen. God's thoughts
[1:00:14] came into a prophet's heart and he spoke
[1:00:17] them. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:20] Amen. You know what's wonderful about
[1:00:22] that is that's only the second phase of
[1:00:25] the seventh seal because he says, "Then
[1:00:29] it became the word." Amen. Amen. So, you
[1:00:33] have God's thoughts coming into a
[1:00:36] prophet's
[1:00:37] heart. That prophet turns around and
[1:00:40] speaks those thoughts. But that's just
[1:00:43] the spoken word. But that spoken word
[1:00:47] now becomes a creation just like it did
[1:00:50] in Egypt. Just like it did when the when
[1:00:54] brother Brandon preached the seals.
[1:00:58] That word just didn't go out. That's
[1:01:00] right. Yeah. and return void to God.
[1:01:03] That word went
[1:01:06] out after God's thoughts projected into
[1:01:10] a prophet's heart.
[1:01:13] Brother Brandham said the first pull of
[1:01:15] that the first fold of that seventh seal
[1:01:19] was the preaching of the thunders.
[1:01:22] So the preaching of the thunders was him
[1:01:24] catching the thoughts of
[1:01:27] God and speaking those out.
[1:01:31] He did not elaborate on what the second
[1:01:34] fold and the third fold was, but he said
[1:01:36] he clearly saw them. Amen. Praise God.
[1:01:40] But when you go to Christ is the mystery
[1:01:41] of God revealed re is revealed. He
[1:01:44] preaches that this seventh seal was in
[1:01:47] three folds. And he tells us the first
[1:01:49] fold was Christ being revealed,
[1:01:52] Christ being revealed in his bride, and
[1:01:55] then them going back to Eden. Now this
[1:01:58] is just me. You take this for what it's
[1:02:00] worth, it may not be worth
[1:02:03] anything. But remember, Brother Brandham
[1:02:06] cannot come out and plainly tell us
[1:02:10] what's going on. He's forbidden by God.
[1:02:13] He has learned this lesson the hard way.
[1:02:16] Remember, he's not going to do this
[1:02:18] again.
[1:02:20] But he comes at the end of the seventh
[1:02:23] seal and tells us the first fold of that
[1:02:28] seventh seal is when the thunders were
[1:02:30] preached.
[1:02:32] Now compare that to Christ is the
[1:02:33] mystery of God revealed. What he says
[1:02:36] the first fold is Christ expressing
[1:02:39] himself. Amen. That was God expressing
[1:02:43] himself. Amen.
[1:02:45] But that's not the
[1:02:48] manifestation as we just saw here. There
[1:02:51] is God expressing
[1:02:55] himself. But now something has to be
[1:02:57] done with that
[1:02:59] expression. Let me say it this way.
[1:03:01] Somebody has to catch that expression.
[1:03:04] Amen. Somebody has to catch it and
[1:03:08] believe this is God expressing himself
[1:03:11] to me. And then there can be a
[1:03:14] restoration to the garden of Eden. Amen.
[1:03:16] So if we if we track what he's saying in
[1:03:20] the seventh seal and what he's saying in
[1:03:22] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:03:24] and there's clearly three folds to this
[1:03:26] seventh seal. We have the first fold
[1:03:29] declared emphatically that it's the
[1:03:31] preaching of the thunders.
[1:03:34] He doesn't emphasize the second fold and
[1:03:37] the third fold during the preaching of
[1:03:40] the seventh seal, but he does in Christ
[1:03:42] is the mystery of God revealed. And he
[1:03:44] clearly tells us that that second fold
[1:03:46] is God manifesting himself in a bride.
[1:03:48] Amen. Amen.
[1:03:51] How's God going to manifest himself in a
[1:03:53] bride if he hasn't first preached the
[1:03:54] thunders?
[1:03:56] Because the bride can't even have a
[1:03:57] revival until these truths are made
[1:03:58] known. Amen.
[1:04:04] But what was the purpose of the
[1:04:06] thunders? Rapturing faith back to the
[1:04:10] garden. Amen. And brother Brandham says,
[1:04:12] "I stood here. I stood there and I
[1:04:15] clearly watched it and I saw it." Yes,
[1:04:18] sir. Amen.
[1:04:20] But what's the one thing that nobody's
[1:04:22] allowed to
[1:04:23] know? The day nor the hour. Yeah. That
[1:04:26] we go back to the garden. Amen.
[1:04:29] But he said Christ didn't say you
[1:04:31] couldn't know the year, the month, and
[1:04:33] the week.
[1:04:38] That's just me. You take it for what
[1:04:39] it's worth. But I think it aligns with
[1:04:41] the message. I think it aligns with the
[1:04:43] scriptures.
[1:04:46] And remember, he's forbidden
[1:04:50] to come right out and declare these
[1:04:52] things to us. We've got to get under the
[1:04:56] same anointing that he was under.
[1:04:58] And we've got to see what he was seeing
[1:05:00] in the word once we've been positionally
[1:05:05] placed to understand
[1:05:09] correctly. We
[1:05:13] know the seventh
[1:05:16] seal was the revelation was the event
[1:05:21] that was going on during the preaching
[1:05:22] of the thunders. It was the coming of
[1:05:24] Christ in word form.
[1:05:29] It was the I think we will agree. It was
[1:05:31] the full expression of Christ.
[1:05:35] Which is what brother Brandon was
[1:05:37] trained to teach us. And Christ is the
[1:05:38] mystery of God revealed.
[1:05:42] They're one and the same. They're
[1:05:44] directly linked together. Each one of
[1:05:47] them has three folds. And he describes
[1:05:51] each one of those folds.
[1:05:54] That's a whole another topic in itself.
[1:05:57] I probably shouldn't even have got into
[1:05:58] it
[1:05:59] tonight, but just look at it. Study it.
[1:06:04] Look at what he's saying. Look at where
[1:06:07] he's trying to guide us to. And
[1:06:10] remember during everything that he's
[1:06:12] saying and everything that he's doing,
[1:06:15] he only has one intent and one
[1:06:18] purpose. And that is to
[1:06:21] re-establish the spiritual relationship
[1:06:23] between God and
[1:06:26] man. We as Gentiles, as the Gentile
[1:06:30] bride, he's trying to establish the
[1:06:32] spiritual
[1:06:35] relationship between the Gentile bride
[1:06:38] and
[1:06:39] Christ.
[1:06:41] Moving on, he
[1:06:45] says, "Let there be flies and here come
[1:06:48] flies." Paragraph
[1:06:50] 303, he says, "There it is. That's it."
[1:06:55] They opened that sixth
[1:06:59] seal. Watch them. If any man hurt them,
[1:07:02] fire proceedth out of their mouth. The
[1:07:06] word. So now he's re-emphasizing this
[1:07:10] same thing that's coming out of their
[1:07:13] mouth. It says fire, but it's really the
[1:07:16] sword. It says sword, but it's really
[1:07:18] fire. It says fire and it says sword,
[1:07:21] but it's really the word. Amen.
[1:07:24] The Holy Ghost came upon the apostles.
[1:07:26] You see, fire proceeded out of their
[1:07:28] mouth.
[1:07:30] Notice now in Revelation
[1:07:33] 19, we see the same
[1:07:37] thing. And a great sword proceeded from
[1:07:40] his mouth. Word. See Christ coming. And
[1:07:46] he slayed his enemies with it. Now he's
[1:07:49] on his road. Watch him now.
[1:07:54] So
[1:07:55] during this preaching of the sixth
[1:07:58] seal, he comes and he
[1:08:01] preaches the information that lays in
[1:08:04] the scripture. Chapter 6, what did we
[1:08:08] read
[1:08:09] here? Chapter 6 verse 12-1 17. He comes
[1:08:13] and he dwells on that information and he
[1:08:17] reveals that information. And I'm not
[1:08:19] saying that's not important. Um, it it
[1:08:22] certainly
[1:08:23] is, but that doesn't directly appi apply
[1:08:27] to the Gentile bride. When you're
[1:08:29] reading through that, it's to the Jews,
[1:08:31] to the purged church, and to the earth.
[1:08:34] Again, not saying those aren't
[1:08:35] important. I'm just saying, I've been
[1:08:38] positionally identified now and
[1:08:40] positionally placed as the gentile
[1:08:41] bride. How does this seal apply to me?
[1:08:45] But now we get down to the end of it and
[1:08:47] he
[1:08:48] starts he starts repeatedly bringing up
[1:08:52] Revelation chapter
[1:08:54] 19 and he's saying and he says the same
[1:08:57] thing that we see happening with those
[1:08:59] prophets that are to the Jews. Same
[1:09:01] thing in chapter 19. There's word going
[1:09:04] forth from Christ's mouth. There's word
[1:09:06] going forth. There's word going forth.
[1:09:08] There's word going
[1:09:10] forth. Let's read chapter 19.
[1:09:24] Revelation. Let's
[1:09:27] do verse
[1:09:36] 11. Revelation 19:1.
[1:09:41] And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a
[1:09:43] white horse. And he that sat upon him
[1:09:44] was called faithful and true. And in
[1:09:47] righteousness he doth judge and make
[1:09:49] war. His eyes were as a flame of fire,
[1:09:52] and on his head were many crowns. And he
[1:09:53] had a name written that no man knew but
[1:09:55] he himself. And he was clothed with a
[1:09:58] vesture dipped in blood. And his name is
[1:10:00] called the Word of God.
[1:10:03] Amen.
[1:10:05] And the armies which were in heaven
[1:10:07] followed him upon white horses clothed
[1:10:08] in fine linen, white and
[1:10:13] clean. How does this sixth seal apply to
[1:10:17] me? Is
[1:10:19] because Christ is going
[1:10:21] forth with a sword coming out of his
[1:10:24] mouth, with fire coming out of his
[1:10:26] mouth. And the scripture that the
[1:10:28] prophet now pulls to draw comparison
[1:10:33] to
[1:10:35] includes armies that are following
[1:10:37] Christ. Amen. Other
[1:10:41] people that are following Christ. Other
[1:10:43] people who are following this one who
[1:10:46] has fire coming out of his mouth. Other
[1:10:49] people who are following this one who
[1:10:51] has a sword coming out of his mouth.
[1:10:53] Amen.
[1:10:55] And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword
[1:10:58] that it should smite the nations, and he
[1:11:00] shall rule them with a rod of iron. And
[1:11:02] he treadth the wir to the fear
[1:11:04] fierceness and wrath of almighty God.
[1:11:07] And he hath on his vesture and on his
[1:11:09] thigh a name written, King of kings and
[1:11:12] lord of lords.
[1:11:14] Why at the end of the sixth seal when
[1:11:17] brother Brandham has went through and
[1:11:18] he's preached the information why does
[1:11:21] he start constantly bringing up
[1:11:23] Revelation chapter
[1:11:26] 19
[1:11:28] this he brings this up at the end and at
[1:11:32] the beginning he was thinking about
[1:11:35] Shiloh Shiloh where a
[1:11:40] prophet you know the scripture says God
[1:11:44] speaking says that I'm going to give you
[1:11:46] that
[1:11:48] land. God told Israel, I'm going to give
[1:11:52] you that
[1:11:54] land. But who actually gave the land to
[1:11:56] Israel? God or
[1:12:00] Joshua? We know the answer is
[1:12:04] yes. See the principle he's laying
[1:12:07] down. He mentions that at the beginning
[1:12:10] of this sixth seal. He says, "Catch this
[1:12:13] material so that you'll understand
[1:12:14] what's going on tomorrow night." He
[1:12:16] comes to the end of the sixth seal. And
[1:12:19] he starts talking about Christ coming
[1:12:23] with the same example word coming out of
[1:12:26] his mouth. And oh, by the
[1:12:29] way, in this chapter
[1:12:31] 19, there's a group of people following
[1:12:34] that person that has word coming out of
[1:12:36] out of his mouth.
[1:12:40] So we
[1:12:42] know that this is in chapter 19. This is
[1:12:46] a
[1:12:48] spiritual word coming of
[1:12:52] Christ to the gentile church to the
[1:12:55] gentile
[1:12:57] bride. A spiritual word coming to the
[1:13:01] gentile bride.
[1:13:06] But how does he
[1:13:10] come? Did we see
[1:13:14] Jesus on a white
[1:13:16] horse with a sword sticking out of his
[1:13:20] mouth cutting bands off of a book that
[1:13:26] tied up seven seals to give us our
[1:13:30] proper identity and rapturing faith?
[1:13:34] Or did we see a gentile prophet
[1:13:38] catch the mind of
[1:13:39] God in his
[1:13:41] heart speak it over a
[1:13:44] people who would then jump on their
[1:13:46] horses and follow it as believers of
[1:13:49] that
[1:14:00] we so often
[1:14:02] put chapter chapter
[1:14:04] 19 as a future coming of
[1:14:09] Christ. And I won't dispute that there
[1:14:12] will be a physical coming of the Lord
[1:14:14] Jesus Christ. We're not here to dispute
[1:14:17] that. We're not here to argue that. We
[1:14:19] believe that. Amen.
[1:14:23] But that's not how he came already.
[1:14:26] Amen. And that's not what he's doing
[1:14:30] right now.
[1:14:32] right
[1:14:33] now. It's a group of
[1:14:36] people that will follow a word coming of
[1:14:41] Christ.
[1:14:49] This
[1:14:51] mystery is loosed and it's spoken about
[1:14:55] under this sixth seal.
[1:14:59] Not to be
[1:15:00] interesting, but as he said earlier,
[1:15:03] this is directly tied to rapturing
[1:15:08] faith. Because if we can't see ourselves
[1:15:11] in that position right
[1:15:14] now in the army of God, following the
[1:15:18] word of God, Amen.
[1:15:21] fighting demonic
[1:15:24] forces with words that come out of our
[1:15:28] mouth or lives that we live right now.
[1:15:33] How do we think that we're going to have
[1:15:35] rapturing faith for a physical rapture?
[1:15:38] Amen. To finish the last part of the
[1:15:41] seventh seal, to finish the last part of
[1:15:44] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:15:46] Amen.
[1:15:48] We have to stay in position. We have to
[1:15:51] stay in line and we have to accept his
[1:15:55] coming as he chose to come. Amen.
[1:15:59] I don't think this is a foreign topic to
[1:16:02] us. But no doubt there's some here
[1:16:04] that's never heard this before. And no
[1:16:06] doubt there's some here that maybe
[1:16:08] haven't viewed it in this light. And
[1:16:11] maybe there are some here that haven't
[1:16:13] given this the
[1:16:14] significance that it needs to be
[1:16:17] given. When we read that sixth seal and
[1:16:21] think that it doesn't apply to us as
[1:16:22] Gentiles, it very much applies to us as
[1:16:25] Gentiles because the principle that is
[1:16:29] loosed under there, remember this is a
[1:16:31] gentile prophet. I'm not saying he can't
[1:16:34] care about the Jews and that he can't
[1:16:35] care about the earth, but quite frankly,
[1:16:37] he has no authority to the Jews. In
[1:16:40] fact, God told him not to go to the
[1:16:42] Jews.
[1:16:45] Anything that he is speaking
[1:16:48] about most likely has a spiritual
[1:16:51] principle
[1:16:53] for the gentile bride attached to it.
[1:16:55] And if we can catch
[1:16:57] that, then we can fulfill our part of
[1:17:00] the scripture. Because Revelation
[1:17:02] chapter 19 is just not about Christ
[1:17:06] returning in the form of a prophet to
[1:17:09] speak
[1:17:10] words. That's part of it. That's the
[1:17:12] first fold. But there's another fold of
[1:17:15] a people who will believe that and flesh
[1:17:18] that out. Amen.
[1:17:21] He says in the third seal, so here he
[1:17:23] comes now. These dignitaries speaking
[1:17:25] about the first coming of Christ.
[1:17:28] these dignitaries come now and they were
[1:17:31] so on their substitute sacrifice. He
[1:17:34] says, "Why now if the Messiah comes,
[1:17:35] he'll certainly come to Caiaphasis.
[1:17:37] He'll come to our denominations. He'll
[1:17:39] come to the Pharisees, the Sadducees.
[1:17:41] But when he come, it was
[1:17:44] strange. He will come all very contrary
[1:17:49] to what they thought.
[1:17:51] But he came according to the word."
[1:17:56] And they didn't know the word.
[1:18:00] Let me say that so it'll sink way down.
[1:18:02] That's what's the matter with you today.
[1:18:04] See, you don't know the word. Jesus said
[1:18:06] you can discern the face of the skies,
[1:18:08] but the signs of the times you can't
[1:18:10] discern. We have Moses. They
[1:18:13] said, he said, "If you would have known
[1:18:16] Moses, you would have kned me." They
[1:18:19] didn't know Moses. Therefore, they
[1:18:21] didn't know. They just knew a creed that
[1:18:24] they had hatched out. Yeah. I pray that
[1:18:27] we'll never find ourselves in this
[1:18:29] situation.
[1:18:31] that Christ will come the way that he
[1:18:34] said he would come and that we'll look
[1:18:35] at him and say we knew brother Brandham
[1:18:37] was a prophet and him reply if you would
[1:18:41] have recognized what kind of prophet he
[1:18:43] was
[1:18:45] right and who came in that form if you
[1:18:48] would have really known him you would
[1:18:51] know me because those were not his
[1:18:54] thoughts that he was speaking those were
[1:18:55] my thoughts those were not his words
[1:18:57] that he was speaking those were my words
[1:19:01] And that was just not him riding a white
[1:19:03] horse following me. That was all of you
[1:19:05] riding a white horse following me. If
[1:19:07] you would have really caught him and
[1:19:09] recognized him and his purpose, you
[1:19:12] would know me.
[1:19:14] I thank God that he's extended that
[1:19:16] grace to us that we're just not
[1:19:21] following some creed that we've hatched
[1:19:23] out,
[1:19:26] but that we're a living,
[1:19:30] breathing,
[1:19:31] literal army of God. You say, "Well, I
[1:19:34] don't have a white
[1:19:37] horse." Catch the revelation.
[1:19:41] What power are you riding on in your
[1:19:43] daily life? The horse is a power. It
[1:19:46] represents a power. What power is
[1:19:48] carrying you on your daily life as you
[1:19:51] fight the good fight? As you stand for
[1:19:53] the gospel, what are you riding
[1:19:55] on? The revealed word. Nothing
[1:20:00] else. In the first seal, we're coming to
[1:20:02] a close if you'll hang with me just for
[1:20:04] a couple more minutes.
[1:20:06] In the first seal, he said, "And Jesus
[1:20:09] said, he that overcomes the antichrist
[1:20:11] and all the things of the world shall
[1:20:12] sit with me on my throne, as I have
[1:20:15] overcome and sit down on my father's
[1:20:16] throne." Now someday he rises from the
[1:20:19] father's throne and goes to take his own
[1:20:23] throne. Now he comes forth to call his
[1:20:27] subjects. How is he going to claim them?
[1:20:29] He's already got the book of redemption
[1:20:31] in his hand. Skipping to paragraph 160.
[1:20:35] He's left the father's throne to take
[1:20:38] his own throne. He now has come forth
[1:20:42] from his intercess intercessory work to
[1:20:45] claim his own throne. His redeemed
[1:20:48] subjects. Amen. He doesn't leave it to
[1:20:52] our interpretation. He doesn't even
[1:20:54] leave it to argument. Amen.
[1:20:57] Christ, he says, is leaving the father's
[1:21:01] throne. coming to his own throne. His
[1:21:05] redeemed subjects.
[1:21:10] I accept that revelation.
[1:21:12] I thank God for that revelation.
[1:21:16] You say, "Well, does that mean nobody
[1:21:17] else can be
[1:21:19] saved?"
[1:21:22] Listen, the revelation is to an
[1:21:26] individual.
[1:21:28] Amen.
[1:21:32] Meaning there can be one in the
[1:21:36] bed who has the revelation that Christ
[1:21:39] has taken his proper place on my heart
[1:21:41] because I am his redeemed subject and he
[1:21:43] is on the throne of my heart. And there
[1:21:46] can be another in the field who says I
[1:21:49] don't see anybody coming. I haven't
[1:21:51] heard
[1:21:52] anything. There can be one at the mill
[1:21:56] grinding. You understand? Amen. The same
[1:22:00] can be true for the gentile bride.
[1:22:05] Christ has left the intercessory
[1:22:08] seat for me. Amen. Because he's came
[1:22:12] came and he's claimed me.
[1:22:15] There may be somebody walking that door
[1:22:17] in five minutes that Christ has got to
[1:22:20] still be on the inter intercessory seat
[1:22:22] in their lives. Amen. And that is
[1:22:25] perfectly fine. Amen. Amen. Amen. But
[1:22:28] there'll be a day after he's interceded
[1:22:31] for them and they've come to the
[1:22:32] recognition of their sacrifice and
[1:22:34] accepted it, he's going to move off of
[1:22:36] his intercessory seat and claim them by
[1:22:40] moving onto the throne of their heart.
[1:22:43] Amen. Praise God. Let's not get bogged
[1:22:46] down on where is it? Where? It's like we
[1:22:49] Oh, mercy. It's like we think God has to
[1:22:52] be in a box and we got to move him from
[1:22:55] one place. No, no. We're a gentile
[1:22:59] people, a spiritual relationship. He can
[1:23:03] be in many different manifestations and
[1:23:07] capacities and offices re depending on
[1:23:11] what individual he's dealing with.
[1:23:13] That's right. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:17] But I thank God
[1:23:20] that as of
[1:23:21] 1963, the opportunity
[1:23:26] for him to move from just an intercessor
[1:23:30] and my savior
[1:23:33] to my bridegroom. Amen.
[1:23:37] To my husband,
[1:23:39] to my redeemer,
[1:23:44] that
[1:23:46] opportunity came into existence in 1963.
[1:23:50] Amen. I don't know how many people
[1:23:52] caught it then. I'm willing to bet it
[1:23:54] was a few. Yeah. Right. But I'm also
[1:23:57] willing to bet there's a lot more who've
[1:23:59] caught it since then. Amen. Amen. And
[1:24:02] that by no means means that somebody
[1:24:05] else can't catch the revelation of him
[1:24:07] being their intercessor.
[1:24:10] It's still available. Amen. So long as
[1:24:13] one of his children needs him to be an
[1:24:16] intercessor, he's still an intercessor
[1:24:18] on the throne. Praise God. But as time
[1:24:21] winds down and dispensation changes,
[1:24:27] there's going to come a point in time
[1:24:28] that each of his children, his elect
[1:24:30] bride, comes to the recognition, I'm
[1:24:33] just not a sinner saved by grace. I am a
[1:24:36] sinner saved by grace, but I'm not just
[1:24:38] a sinner saved by grace. Amen. I was
[1:24:42] actually in his mind before the
[1:24:43] foundation of the world. He has actually
[1:24:45] left his father's throne and came and
[1:24:48] sat on my throne. And now I live my
[1:24:51] daily life riding on this power
[1:24:55] following this one who has fire and word
[1:24:58] and a sword coming out of his mouth.
[1:25:01] Amen.
[1:25:04] Very familiar quote. Christ is the
[1:25:05] mystery of God revealed. Now you see the
[1:25:08] seals when he's in his mediatorial work
[1:25:11] back there redeeming. But someday he
[1:25:12] comes forth to get this book that he's
[1:25:14] redeemed. And all that's in the book
[1:25:16] would be him. For that's the believer.
[1:25:18] the words in the book. The question is
[1:25:21] what words?
[1:25:23] Because this is a big book.
[1:25:26] What words are you? Amen.
[1:25:30] If you're the believer and you're the
[1:25:32] words in the book, he also called you
[1:25:34] the New Testament. That's all. That's
[1:25:36] right. Amen. If you're the believer and
[1:25:38] you're the words in the book, what words
[1:25:41] are you?
[1:25:44] I say all of them. Amen. Amen. But I say
[1:25:47] very specifically Revelation 19:14,
[1:25:54] I am in his army and I am following that
[1:25:58] word in my daily life. That's the
[1:26:00] mystery to the gentile bride underneath
[1:26:02] that sixth seal.
[1:26:06] Musicians, if you'll
[1:26:09] come, I'm going to
[1:26:11] relay one more nugget that I found in
[1:26:14] this sixth seal before we close. because
[1:26:17] I think it's
[1:26:18] relevant and I'm doing really good on
[1:26:22] time. At least half of you agree with
[1:26:27] that. in paragraph 64 or
[1:26:36] 69
[1:26:37] 69 of the sixth seal at the very very
[1:26:40] beginning right after he talks about
[1:26:42] Shiloh he moves down to paragraph
[1:26:45] 69 and he says I think of a little
[1:26:48] story if I'm not taking too much of your
[1:26:51] time now in this preliminary I do this
[1:26:54] for a purpose until I until I feel the
[1:26:56] spirit just right to start meaning to
[1:26:59] start preaching on the actual
[1:27:02] seal. I think of a little
[1:27:05] story. There was a little girl in the
[1:27:07] west and a man had fell in love with
[1:27:11] her. It's an odd story to be talking
[1:27:15] about during the judgment seal.
[1:27:21] We know this story very, very familiar.
[1:27:24] So, I'm not going to take the time to go
[1:27:25] through all of it. You know what I find
[1:27:27] astounding about
[1:27:29] this is at the beginning of this
[1:27:33] story, there's a man that shows up on a
[1:27:40] horse and he asks a girl, "What's your
[1:27:45] name?" And then he says, "Do you know
[1:27:48] why I'm really here?"
[1:27:53] And then he reveals to her why he's
[1:27:56] really there.
[1:28:00] This will never get old to me, saints.
[1:28:03] Amen.
[1:28:05] This will never get old to me.
[1:28:10] By grace, he reveals to her why he's
[1:28:12] really there
[1:28:14] to get a bride. Amen. And then he
[1:28:17] proposes to her and there's an agreement
[1:28:20] and he says, "I'm leaving and I'll be
[1:28:23] back." You know what's really odd about
[1:28:25] this
[1:28:26] story is what this man is riding when he
[1:28:29] comes
[1:28:31] back. The same thing the man's riding in
[1:28:33] chapter 19 of the book of Revelation, a
[1:28:38] horse. But Brother Brandon was just
[1:28:40] going to tell us this little story and
[1:28:42] we hopefully had time for it.
[1:28:48] God hiding himself in
[1:28:51] simplicity, revealing himself in the
[1:28:54] same.
[1:28:59] Brother Brandham says at the end of this
[1:29:01] message, if you'll go ahead and play
[1:29:03] something,
[1:29:07] please at the end of the sixth
[1:29:12] seal. I'm sorry. At as I finish this, I
[1:29:17] want to go back to the beginning of the
[1:29:18] sixth seal and I want to read the entire
[1:29:21] prayer that we started out on as our
[1:29:24] pastor would come.
[1:29:26] He says,
[1:29:27] 'Lord, we are again gathering in for the
[1:29:30] service and we think of the time in the
[1:29:33] early days when they all came up to
[1:29:35] Shiloh for the blessings of the Lord.
[1:29:37] We've expounded upon that. We know what
[1:29:40] he's referring to now. We understand
[1:29:42] this is the same thing that's about to
[1:29:44] transpire this night. But he continues
[1:29:47] and he says, "And now tonight, we have
[1:29:50] assembled here to hear your word. And as
[1:29:53] we have been studying in this certain
[1:29:55] portion of the scripture that the lamb
[1:29:56] was the only one that could open the
[1:29:58] seals or to loose them. And we pray that
[1:30:01] tonight as we have under consideration
[1:30:04] this great sixth seal. We pray heavenly
[1:30:06] father that the lamb will open up open
[1:30:09] it to us tonight that we are here to
[1:30:13] understand it. And when no man on earth
[1:30:16] or in heaven was sufficient only the
[1:30:18] lamb was found
[1:30:19] sufficient. So may the allsufficient one
[1:30:22] come and open the seal for us
[1:30:26] tonight. Here's the
[1:30:28] purpose. That we might just look past a
[1:30:31] curtain of time.
[1:30:34] [Music]
[1:30:36] You see what jams us up about seeing
[1:30:39] ourselves
[1:30:40] properly in chapter
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:44] 19 on a horse in the army of God right
[1:30:49] behind Jesus Christ with the word coming
[1:30:51] out of his
[1:30:54] mouth. What makes that difficult is
[1:30:57] because we're stuck in
[1:30:59] time and we want to put that in the
[1:31:01] future.
[1:31:05] But he's saying if you'll come and
[1:31:08] you'll loose this seal to
[1:31:11] us and you will reveal the only one that
[1:31:14] can do it. If you'll come and you'll
[1:31:16] break this seal to us
[1:31:19] tonight, it will give us the
[1:31:21] ability to look past the curtain of
[1:31:24] time. And what happens? You remember
[1:31:27] brother Simon was speaking on this. What
[1:31:29] happens when you look past the curtain
[1:31:31] of time?
[1:31:33] You can see where you come
[1:31:35] from. You can see where you're going,
[1:31:38] and you can see where you're at.
[1:31:41] And by
[1:31:43] default, when you can see where you come
[1:31:46] from, and when you can see where you're
[1:31:49] going, and you can see where you're at
[1:31:53] according to the revealed word of
[1:31:57] God, by default, you know who you are.
[1:32:01] As we would stand this evening, by
[1:32:05] default, there's no more
[1:32:08] questioning. What part of the book am I?
[1:32:11] Where am I in the book? If I'm in the
[1:32:14] book, where am I
[1:32:17] at? You say, "Well, why is that
[1:32:21] important?" Because we're not called
[1:32:23] just to be saved,
[1:32:24] saints. We're called to be changed in
[1:32:27] the moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
[1:32:29] with rapturing faith. And our prophet
[1:32:31] said, "We cannot do it without the
[1:32:33] principles that were spoken to us under
[1:32:36] these
[1:32:39] seals." But with the spiritual
[1:32:41] principles that were spoken to us under
[1:32:45] the loosing of these seals, it will not
[1:32:48] only tell us who we are, but it will
[1:32:52] tell us where we're at in time.
[1:32:55] And when you know who you are and where
[1:32:58] you're at in
[1:33:00] time, you're prepared for rapturing
[1:33:03] faith. Rapturing faith is not just
[1:33:05] knowing who you are. You have to have
[1:33:09] both. You have to know who you are and
[1:33:12] that it's the appropriate
[1:33:15] time. Remember, that's the part the
[1:33:17] prophet couldn't see.
[1:33:20] He couldn't declare that part to us, the
[1:33:22] time, because no man can know the day
[1:33:25] nor the hour. But I believe if we will
[1:33:29] keep proceeding in his word behind the
[1:33:32] one who's got the word coming out of his
[1:33:35] mouth, who has revealed to us who we
[1:33:37] are, I think he'll take care of the time
[1:33:40] issue. He'll reveal to us Yeah. when
[1:33:43] it's time. Amen. Let's pray together.
[1:33:46] Precious Lord Jesus, we just thank you
[1:33:49] for this opportunity that we've had to
[1:33:51] come this
[1:33:53] evening and to speak about this great
[1:33:56] truth that you've so graciously given to
[1:33:59] us,
[1:34:00] Lord. Father, we've went slow this
[1:34:03] evening. We've went methodically on
[1:34:05] purpose, Lord. And I just pray that you
[1:34:09] would take these
[1:34:11] words that you've given to us, Lord, and
[1:34:15] that you would give us the proper
[1:34:18] understanding and placement of them,
[1:34:19] Lord. Father, if I've said anything out
[1:34:22] of context or that would be confusing, I
[1:34:24] pray that you would just come and with
[1:34:27] your hand in the balm of Gilead, that
[1:34:29] you would just make the wrinkles smooth
[1:34:31] and the rough places flat. that you
[1:34:34] would just bring a proper understanding,
[1:34:36] Lord Jesus, to the
[1:34:38] teaching. Father, we stand here as a
[1:34:41] grateful people. We stand here as a
[1:34:44] people like no other people to know who
[1:34:47] we are and where we're at in time. Lord,
[1:34:49] may we ever be grateful for that
[1:34:53] revelation. We just want to commit
[1:34:56] ourselves to you this evening with the
[1:34:57] word, Lord, that it would come and that
[1:35:01] it would have its desired effect on our
[1:35:04] lives, Lord. That we may leave here as
[1:35:06] our prophet said, that we may leave here
[1:35:09] simply better Christians for you, Lord,
[1:35:11] to serve you. We ask these favors in the
[1:35:14] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:35:17] Amen. God bless you.

[1:37:03] Let the word
[1:37:07] live.
[1:37:09] Let the word
[1:37:12] live in me.
[1:37:18] Amen. You want the word to live in you.
[1:37:21] We want to be the manifestation of that
[1:37:23] word in this hour. Amen. We want to be
[1:37:28] the throne. Our hearts want to be the
[1:37:29] throne that God can dwell on and living
[1:37:32] reality in me. You look at this army
[1:37:35] that's that's out. Christ is defeating
[1:37:37] all his enemies and the armies of heaven
[1:37:40] are with him. And surely we're going to
[1:37:42] be part of his great army. We're part of
[1:37:44] the army now. But we're not fighting any
[1:37:46] physical battle, any physical What's the
[1:37:49] enemy that he's fighting? False
[1:37:51] teaching, false doctrine, false
[1:37:52] understanding, a misunderstanding of
[1:37:55] God. And guess what? We're fighting that
[1:37:57] battle, too.
[1:37:59] But how do we fight it? With a sword in
[1:38:01] our hand and by No, we fight that
[1:38:04] battle. Brother Brandham taught us.
[1:38:06] Amen. Even before the seals, we fight
[1:38:08] that battle with real sweet consecrated
[1:38:11] lives. That's the thunder that shakes
[1:38:13] the enemy. How to what shakes the enemy?
[1:38:16] When Christ is on our throne and his
[1:38:18] life lives through us with everything he
[1:38:20] taught us and everything he preached
[1:38:21] becomes a living reality in
[1:38:24] us. That's this message. That's this
[1:38:26] seventh seal. That's the whole mystery
[1:38:29] now alive. Thank God. I want it to be
[1:38:32] real. Brother Ben was taking us on a
[1:38:34] journey a little deeper. He wasn't
[1:38:36] taking away from the physical realities
[1:38:38] of what will come, but he's showing us
[1:38:39] the spir spiritual realities of what's
[1:38:42] here. It's here now. Amen. The spiritual
[1:38:45] is taking place now. The natural is
[1:38:47] going to follow. There will be a return
[1:38:50] to an Eden condition. There will be a
[1:38:51] millennium on earth. There will be a
[1:38:53] Jesus Christ on the throne of David. But
[1:38:55] he's on the throne of his subjects now.
[1:38:57] Amen. And there's a marriage union now
[1:39:00] with husband and wife. Amen. And those
[1:39:02] are the things that are real to us now.
[1:39:05] And that gives us overcoming power
[1:39:07] today. Oh, I pray that it becomes more
[1:39:10] and more real to us. The spiritual
[1:39:12] reality becomes the
[1:39:14] reality. Amen. God bless you. And we're
[1:39:17] going to be dismissed. We just want to
[1:39:18] remind you of uh the Murray family
[1:39:21] coming in. just be in prayer for them
[1:39:22] and prayer for the service coming up on
[1:39:25] Sunday. We also have a youth meeting on
[1:39:27] Sunday and that'll be at brother
[1:39:29] Benjamin and Sister Amanda's. We changed
[1:39:31] the time. Amen. Cuz there's an open
[1:39:33] house and uh uh for 50th anniversary for
[1:39:36] a couple couples here in the church. So
[1:39:37] that'll delay some things. So the time
[1:39:39] will be from 6 to 10 uh on Sunday. Let's
[1:39:44] just bow our heads and thank God. Lord
[1:39:46] Jesus, we want to thank you God for
[1:39:49] bringing us Lord from the natural to the
[1:39:52] supernatural to the
[1:39:54] spiritual. And God, may this truth
[1:39:57] become the only reality to us where we
[1:40:00] can deny, Lord, the flesh and the
[1:40:02] carnality and the things of the flesh
[1:40:04] and focus our attention on the reality
[1:40:06] that lies within the work that you're
[1:40:09] doing in us and through us. Lord, the
[1:40:11] hour that we've come to, the
[1:40:13] manifestation that you're calling for.
[1:40:16] God, you told your prophet, he went to
[1:40:18] Ezekiel and showed us that this mighty
[1:40:20] army was coming on her feet. But Lord,
[1:40:24] there was going to be another wind of
[1:40:25] prophecy move in the fourth stage of the
[1:40:28] restoration. And she was going to be a
[1:40:30] mighty marching army marching to Zion.
[1:40:33] Oh God, how we want to be that army for
[1:40:35] you, Lord. We want to be restored, the
[1:40:38] church restored, the resurrected church,
[1:40:40] the word back alive in bride form again.
[1:40:43] Where you're dwelling, where you're
[1:40:45] leading us, Lord, into battle. Not a
[1:40:47] battle of swords and of sticks and of
[1:40:50] guns, but a a battle of spiritual truth,
[1:40:52] fighting the darkness of the lies that
[1:40:54] the enemy has spread, the Antichrist
[1:40:56] spirit. God, let our lives reflect this
[1:40:59] truth. And let it let it be the thunder
[1:41:02] that shakes the devil. Lord, we want to
[1:41:04] give ourselves Aresh to you. May you sit
[1:41:06] on the throne of our lives. Claim us,
[1:41:09] Lord, in your claiming ministry. For
[1:41:10] you've come to claim each one of us back
[1:41:13] to yourself. That we might be vessels
[1:41:16] that you can work through, Lord. That we
[1:41:18] might be this army, Lord, that's maring
[1:41:20] out, marching out victorious through
[1:41:22] this land. Not conquered by the lies of
[1:41:25] the enemy, not the deceptions of the
[1:41:28] darkness, but by the revelation of the
[1:41:30] hour that's opened our eyes, by the Isab
[1:41:33] that's taken all the darkness away.
[1:41:35] so that we can see, God, what great
[1:41:37] victory we have in this hour. God, I
[1:41:40] pray you make these things more of a
[1:41:42] reality to us day by day. May they
[1:41:45] become the only things that matter to
[1:41:47] us. We love you. We thank you, God.
[1:41:50] Thank you for our brother Benjamin. We
[1:41:52] pray that you would restore his
[1:41:53] strength, that you would bless him,
[1:41:55] refresh him, and give him more
[1:41:56] revelation. Lord, God, I pray you bless
[1:41:59] us as we part. May we go out of here
[1:42:02] encouraged, Lord, that there's so much
[1:42:05] going on, so much more going on in our
[1:42:07] lives than maybe we even realize
[1:42:09] sometimes. There's so much that matters
[1:42:12] every day in our life and and your plan
[1:42:14] is being worked and it's
[1:42:16] manifesting. God, make it more of a
[1:42:19] reality to us. We pray as we go in Jesus
[1:42:23] Christ's name we pray. Amen. And God
[1:42:27] bless you all. like key of F. Well, I'm
[1:42:31] resting on the finished work of Jesus
[1:42:36] Christ
[1:42:39] today. All
[1:42:41] circumstances will be gone. The word of
[1:42:46] God will still remain. No sickness,
[1:42:50] fear, no guilt or sin can have control
[1:42:55] and worry me. The keys of faith are in
[1:43:01] my hands and I am bound for
[1:43:07] victory. I am
[1:43:11] free. My new day has

[1:44:02] received. Prince of power of the air
[1:44:07] will never have a pardon me as
[1:44:13] amateur creator. I can change the
[1:44:19] atmosphere around. I use the chain of
[1:44:25] circumstance for any spirits to be
[1:44:30] bound. I am
[1:44:34] free. My new day has
[1:44:39] come. Now I can be who I truly am.

[1:45:21] highest is the same
[1:45:25] today. The prophet came to show the
[1:45:29] light. The bride must have it on
[1:45:34] display. The hour has come for Christ in
[1:45:38] us to be completely glorified.
