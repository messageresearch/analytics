[14:33] we read in genesis and um
[14:37] in
[14:38] genesis chapter 41
[14:40] verse 50
[14:42] genesis 41
[14:45] verse 15.
[14:50] and it reads like this
[14:53] and unto joseph were born two sons
[14:56] before the years of famine
[14:58] came which asanat the daughter of
[15:00] putiforth
[15:01] priest of on bear unto him
[15:05] and joseph called the name of the
[15:07] firstborn manasseh
[15:09] for god said he had hath had me forget
[15:15] all my toils in all my father's house
[15:19] so tremendous there is
[15:21] in the old testament there was already a
[15:23] way
[15:24] to forget all the frustrations in life
[15:27] that's tremendous
[15:28] and let us read in the book of
[15:30] revelation
[15:32] in revelation chapter 5
[15:35] verse 7.
[15:39] revelations chapter 5 verse 7
[15:42] and he came and took the book out of the
[15:44] right hand of him that said upon the
[15:46] throne and when he had taken the book
[15:48] the four beasts and four and twenty
[15:50] elders fell down before the lamb
[15:52] having every one of them harps and
[15:55] golden vials
[15:56] full of orders which are the prayer of
[15:59] the saints
[16:01] and they sung
[16:02] a new song
[16:04] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[16:07] and open the seals thereof
[16:10] i mean you maybe see that may the lord
[16:12] add his blessing to the reading of his
[16:14] word
[16:15] so it's just wonderful to be here and
[16:18] it's a great honor for me after after
[16:21] these services over there i think it was
[16:23] october or november to be back in your
[16:25] place and as the pastor was saying
[16:27] already i'm here for just coming from
[16:29] canada from a youth weekend it seems
[16:31] that i
[16:32] even
[16:33] i would be 80 years old and still have
[16:35] the reputation to be a youth preacher
[16:37] somehow it's i'm always invited to use
[16:39] meetings brother mark would you make
[16:40] some youth meetings and and okay that's
[16:42] how it is whatever we can do to serve
[16:44] the lord and um as brother chap was
[16:47] saying i said look i'm in the area and i
[16:49] would not be around just to tell you my
[16:51] good old friend and and precious brother
[16:53] and he said look why don't you take over
[16:54] a wednesday service and it's a great
[16:56] honor for me
[16:57] so i'm i'm greeting bringing the
[16:59] greetings of brother gert and the church
[17:01] in bristolsburg and they will feel very
[17:03] much connected with you and at the same
[17:05] time certainly our sister sibila she is
[17:08] sending all greetings to all of you
[17:11] right and um blessed be the name of the
[17:13] lord thank you brother chad for the
[17:15] great honor to be here for the great
[17:17] privilege and uh
[17:19] it's always my joy i always feel a
[17:20] little bit at home here
[17:23] in germany we have a saying which says
[17:24] feel at home but don't behave like this
[17:27] don't put the feet on the table and i'm
[17:29] always aware wherever i'm traveling i'm
[17:31] behind another man's pulpit and we
[17:32] always should respect another men's
[17:34] houses and other men's churches another
[17:36] men's pulpit that's i think it's we
[17:38] learned this a little bit in life huh
[17:40] and um for this evening i um i have a
[17:44] wonderful thought huh uh we have a we
[17:46] have a weak preacher but we have a great
[17:48] big message
[17:49] you know it's really i would like to
[17:51] call it when the lamb takes the book
[17:54] and uh look this is not a teaching you
[17:56] know this is a wednesday evening service
[17:58] this is not a serious please keep in
[18:00] mind it it will not
[18:02] be the full picture it will not be the
[18:05] balance in all things please do not
[18:06] expect but but i have just a point
[18:09] um of explaining to us what the opening
[18:12] of these seals means for us
[18:14] for our life
[18:16] for for our everyday life for our
[18:18] behavior for our vision for our time
[18:20] okay so there's a lot of aspects and and
[18:23] and
[18:24] which goes along with this
[18:26] and um
[18:28] i would like to put it into the story of
[18:29] uh of of joseph because brother branham
[18:33] puts the fifth seal he puts it in the
[18:35] story of joseph so again it's not the
[18:37] full picture it's every not everything
[18:39] is in balance it's just to to lay a
[18:42] ground for the inspiration that we have
[18:45] for this for this day and
[18:48] so what we have let me just read
[18:50] um
[18:52] out of out of the scripture
[18:54] and it says
[18:55] look at this
[18:57] when joseph was revealing himself he
[18:59] said joseph said unto his brethren
[19:02] i'm joseph
[19:04] does my father yet live and his brethren
[19:07] could not answer him for they were
[19:09] troubled at his presence and joseph said
[19:12] unto his brethren
[19:14] come near to me i pray you and they came
[19:17] near
[19:18] and he said i am joseph your brother
[19:21] whom you sold into egypt
[19:24] now therefore be not grieved nor angry
[19:27] with yourselves
[19:29] that you have sold me hither for god did
[19:32] send me before you to preserve
[19:36] life
[19:37] now that is somebody who understands his
[19:40] life
[19:40] and once we understand our life we
[19:43] become a blessing to others
[19:45] if not we always have to live with our
[19:47] frustration with our hatred with our
[19:50] complexes with our stories what
[19:52] everybody did to us
[19:54] and as i always said
[19:56] the the rapture will not be for a
[19:59] frustrated group
[20:00] the rapture will not be for a spiritual
[20:03] teenager the rapture will be for a group
[20:05] who clearly understood who they were on
[20:08] this earth
[20:10] the rapture for us will not be a
[20:12] denominational thing of of of santa
[20:14] claus coming
[20:16] in fact we are already in the process
[20:19] you see god is already transforming us
[20:21] we're already leaving loud is here
[20:23] coming up higher and higher from
[20:25] revelation to revelation and it will not
[20:28] be a doctrinal thing
[20:31] it will be an understanding of ourselves
[20:34] through the scriptures in the scriptures
[20:37] but it will change our life
[20:39] definitely so we find ourselves we stop
[20:41] running around ourselves okay that is
[20:44] tremendous
[20:45] so so so you keep in mind that that's
[20:47] tremendous
[20:48] unbelievable and so okay
[20:51] so we understand
[20:52] that that let's let's tell a little bit
[20:54] the story of joseph and you have to
[20:57] click into this
[20:59] so when joseph was born he was born with
[21:03] a gift
[21:04] joseph didn't ask to have a gift
[21:07] joseph was born with a purpose
[21:10] joseph was born with a destiny
[21:13] he should take over the kingdom
[21:16] so the bride is born with part of god in
[21:20] him in herself
[21:22] because david said in the psalms he said
[21:25] he even put eternity in our hearts
[21:29] there is only one who is eternal that's
[21:31] god
[21:32] so when you came onto on
[21:34] on this earth nobody asked you
[21:37] do you want to be an american
[21:39] nobody asked you anyhow if you're an
[21:41] american you're nothing else in a
[21:42] backslidden european anyhow okay
[21:47] okay
[21:48] so nobody asks you do you want to be
[21:49] black or white nobody asked you
[21:52] nobody asked you do you want to be
[21:53] female or male
[21:55] nobody asked do you want to live in
[21:57] arizona or in ohio
[21:59] nobody asked you about your family
[22:01] background you were just thrown into it
[22:03] you couldn't even choose your own name
[22:06] your father and your mother choose your
[22:07] name if you like it or not you have it
[22:11] you should come on this earth uh by by
[22:14] the spoken words but you came through
[22:16] the birth channel
[22:18] with all the blood and all the cryings
[22:20] and all what goes along with this huh
[22:23] i was there when my border was born born
[22:26] and i always said this my wife needed
[22:28] one nurse
[22:29] to help her i needed to
[22:31] [Laughter]
[22:33] that was too much for me
[22:35] that was too much for me
[22:36] that disaster that was real master of
[22:38] disaster and that was really that was
[22:40] really unbelievable and and you see we
[22:43] came on this earth the first thing that
[22:45] we got was a spanky
[22:47] and the midwife said you will get more
[22:49] during your life
[22:50] that was the beginning that was the
[22:52] welcoming service okay you you thought
[22:54] of of of here is somebody taking your
[22:57] arms in his arms and you got a spanky
[22:59] and the midwife said okay welcome you
[23:01] get more of it okay so so we never
[23:04] choose
[23:05] our life
[23:06] and we never choose how we came and we
[23:08] never choose the age in which we wanted
[23:10] to live
[23:11] but one thing is sure no matter i always
[23:14] make that little picture when it comes
[23:15] to our life this is just an illustration
[23:17] about the beckett gave many many years
[23:19] ago he said god made a picture of his
[23:21] whole family
[23:23] right and we were right there
[23:26] exactly so it's just an illustration
[23:29] and god took our lives and he was thrown
[23:31] in seven church ages over seven
[23:33] continents and he put part of himself in
[23:36] into us and when the seven church ages
[23:39] are over god knows one thing my sheep
[23:41] hear my voice
[23:43] so all of the family of god will be
[23:45] there
[23:46] nobody is missing because god put part
[23:48] of himself into us
[23:50] so so even the brother brahman said god
[23:52] without you is not complete anymore that
[23:54] means something the messenger of this
[23:57] age he could look farther than anybody
[24:00] else in the bible
[24:02] moses could only say in the beginning
[24:04] god created
[24:06] john could only say
[24:07] in the beginning god that was there was
[24:09] the logos coming out of god but this
[24:12] messenger could look farther than
[24:14] anybody else
[24:15] and god knew one thing we would need it
[24:18] in order to go into the rapture
[24:20] the rapture is a revelation
[24:22] not in knowledge is a revelation so
[24:24] joseph he was born if he liked it or not
[24:27] and you must understand you had that if
[24:30] you a bride you had that calling in you
[24:34] if you liked it or not
[24:36] you were always different than the rest
[24:38] you tried to be
[24:40] some like some someone in the world we
[24:42] tried everything to be like the world
[24:45] to to close like the world to dance like
[24:47] the world i remember that i could i
[24:49] could dance like michael jackson
[24:51] i could make the moon walk so i will not
[24:53] show okay that's fine don't don't fear
[24:56] no fear but but but we tried to be as
[24:58] but we were not
[25:00] and and and and the proof was when god
[25:03] called us there was something in us to
[25:05] respond
[25:06] we did not understand the message in the
[25:08] beginning not at all we didn't even
[25:10] understand brother brandon we only f we
[25:12] only thought it sounds good
[25:14] you see but it was during the message of
[25:17] the hour we were developing ourself
[25:20] god was taking the amnesia from our eyes
[25:23] that today we know we are more than just
[25:25] sinners saved by grace but we are family
[25:27] of god and we go back to where we came
[25:29] from
[25:30] nobody stands in our way but but god
[25:33] allowed many heartaches
[25:35] many difficulties to bring us to the
[25:37] point that we are
[25:39] so when joseph was a young boy he was
[25:41] already a prophet
[25:43] or let me call it he was already a
[25:44] patriarch i always call him a prophet
[25:47] hope that i'm right in this
[25:50] joseph was different because god always
[25:53] revealed himself as the god of abraham
[25:56] jacob and isaac that's all
[25:58] never as the god of joseph
[26:00] joseph brought a change of dispensation
[26:03] completely you cannot compare him
[26:05] because he stands for for perfection he
[26:08] was the one portraying christ because he
[26:10] was marrying aznat okay so i called him
[26:13] prophet in in my own in my in my own
[26:16] thinking okay
[26:17] um that's exactly so but he is he was
[26:20] one of the patriarchs one of the
[26:22] foundation for original parts okay
[26:25] so what happened is he has a dream
[26:27] and uh now exactly this now he tells his
[26:30] brother his dream
[26:32] now what we what what what we learned in
[26:35] life
[26:36] is
[26:37] i have a little problem with no problem
[26:39] just give me a second
[26:41] what we learned in life
[26:43] is
[26:43] when we came into the message of the
[26:45] hour
[26:46] we were full of energy
[26:48] we were full of enthusiasm and we were
[26:51] full of naivety
[26:53] exactly so
[26:55] we learned our lessons
[26:56] that we should talk when it's time to
[26:58] talk
[26:59] that we should know to whom do we talk
[27:02] that we should know how to listen and to
[27:04] be silent when it's better to be silent
[27:06] okay
[27:07] and but joseph was a young boy and he
[27:09] meant well he had good he had good
[27:11] intentions but he told his brothers very
[27:14] sincere
[27:15] uh look brothers i had a dream and the
[27:18] dream was just fantastic you're all
[27:20] bowing before me
[27:22] so it was clear that the older brothers
[27:24] were not very amused about that kind of
[27:26] a dream
[27:27] and and uh he meant well but i always
[27:30] tell our young people he said there is
[27:32] some kind like a persecution which lays
[27:35] in our destiny because christ in us will
[27:38] be persecuted anyhow
[27:40] but you can bring persecution by our own
[27:44] mistakes
[27:46] we can't break we can bring persecution
[27:48] to ourselves okay we we don't have
[27:51] homeschooling in germany i always tell
[27:53] the young people don't discuss with the
[27:55] teacher
[27:56] don't try to evangelize the whole school
[27:59] because you will just bring reproach and
[28:01] and and persecution upon also yourself
[28:03] if somebody asked just say we have a
[28:06] church sunday morning a service come and
[28:08] see
[28:09] okay but we're not called to convince
[28:12] the the teacher and religion
[28:14] uh to convert the world we are we are
[28:17] taught we are we're called to say
[28:19] something when god wants to say
[28:21] something okay when we were younger we
[28:23] thought we had to evangelize everyone
[28:26] and if somebody didn't want we want to
[28:27] evangelize by force and if it didn't
[28:29] work we were frustrated about somebody
[28:32] who was not worthy that we were talking
[28:34] but he was not asked to talk to us
[28:36] anyhow we were not invited to talk but
[28:38] we wanted to convince sohart and then
[28:40] the frustration was over and then uh
[28:43] all the frustrations started so joseph
[28:46] was a young boy and he meant well but he
[28:49] didn't do well
[28:50] to mean well and to do well is to
[28:53] different things
[28:55] okay to mean well and to do well is
[28:57] different
[28:58] so what happened as he was
[29:00] portraying christ
[29:02] he was sent
[29:03] on the field
[29:04] to search his brothers
[29:07] that reminds us to david he had a
[29:09] calling in his life
[29:11] and he was sent out to to find out his
[29:14] brothers
[29:15] that is you
[29:17] if you are a christian
[29:20] you go out to find your brother
[29:22] you're not just evangelizing everyone
[29:24] but you find you try to find your
[29:26] brother
[29:27] amen without abusing another people's
[29:30] another man's emotion another man's
[29:33] conviction another man's religion but
[29:35] you try to find your brothers okay i
[29:38] believe you have the same opinion like
[29:40] us we're not interested in just filling
[29:42] up the church
[29:44] we're interested in finding eagles
[29:47] amen not all just filling up churches
[29:49] but finding eagles
[29:51] i'm a people who are really have a
[29:52] predestination in their heart so here's
[29:55] what brother branham says
[29:57] in the breach he said but you see the
[30:00] sleeping virgin ain't receive nothing
[30:02] anyhow that's right and remember while
[30:05] they went to try to buy oily remember
[30:07] the scripture doesn't say they got it
[30:10] but while they were out trying to buy
[30:12] their camera sound what happened all
[30:14] those virgins that slept rose and
[30:16] trimmed their lamps and went into the
[30:19] supper is that right
[30:20] and the rest was left for the
[30:22] tribulation tribulation period right
[30:25] weeping wailing and gnashing of tears
[30:27] that's the church not the bride the
[30:29] church
[30:30] the bride went in and here's what
[30:32] brother blame says he said there is a
[30:35] whole difference between the church and
[30:38] the bride
[30:40] that's a big difference
[30:42] because the bride is entering into the
[30:44] wedding supper
[30:46] and in order to enter into the wedding
[30:48] supper she must have a garment
[30:51] because according to the parable of
[30:53] jesus if you have no garment you cannot
[30:55] enter
[30:56] that garment is your theophany
[31:00] therefore the bride has a theophany
[31:03] everybody who dies he would they will go
[31:05] into some kind of a body because he must
[31:07] be judged but as theophany is more than
[31:10] a spiritual body a theophany is part of
[31:12] god
[31:13] coming out of god only the bride have it
[31:17] now for the jews they will be given
[31:19] white robes brother blame said we have
[31:21] them already
[31:22] there's a big difference
[31:24] therefore
[31:25] laodicea is blind
[31:28] and they are naked
[31:30] naked on this side of that of the
[31:33] dimension and they are naked on the
[31:35] other side
[31:37] they are naked here because they have a
[31:39] reflection they are naked on the other
[31:41] hand side they don't have a
[31:43] they might be safe nothing against that
[31:46] but they don't have a
[31:47] a a theophany they're not part of the
[31:49] bride so they are naked there and they
[31:51] are naked here
[31:53] there's a big difference between a
[31:55] church and a bride
[31:57] look what happened when joseph was sent
[32:00] out by his brothers and he was just
[32:02] sold
[32:04] and and they brought that kind of
[32:06] clothes with the blood on it
[32:10] for his father it was not joseph's blood
[32:12] we understand but it represented
[32:15] so i want you to put on the spiritual
[32:17] jacket
[32:19] when joseph
[32:21] uh later revealed himself to his
[32:24] brothers
[32:26] the brothers came and went to their
[32:29] father jacob and said joseph lives
[32:33] the father said but i have his garment
[32:36] of blood
[32:38] but they said but joseph lives
[32:41] and he said but i have his garment of
[32:43] blood it's here
[32:45] now the blood of jesus christ is
[32:47] precious
[32:49] it's very precious
[32:51] it's extremely precious
[32:53] but there are things that are more
[32:55] precious
[32:56] than the blood of jesus christ
[32:58] that's christ himself
[33:01] christ is more precious than his blood
[33:05] is that correct
[33:06] the giver is higher than the gift amen
[33:10] brother brahm even said the purchase of
[33:12] the blood is higher or more precious
[33:15] than the blood itself
[33:17] so so while the father was still in
[33:20] denominational thinking but i have his
[33:22] blood i have everything now the person
[33:25] said but he is risen he's here
[33:28] forget about that garment he is here the
[33:30] person is here
[33:32] they say amen
[33:34] the blood of jesus christ is precious
[33:36] nobody will diminish that but the person
[33:39] is even greater than his own blood
[33:42] can you say amen
[33:44] so that's so important to see
[33:46] that we see the young boy that that that
[33:49] that that there was a changing of egypt
[33:52] the changing of dispensation
[33:55] so when joseph was sold to egypt the
[33:58] bible says he was 17 years old
[34:01] and he was 30 years old when he came in
[34:03] the presence of the king now we see
[34:07] that this message is reflecting or the
[34:10] bible is reflecting what god is doing in
[34:13] this message i mean because we live in
[34:15] the time of the perfection
[34:18] i would call it joseph time but this is
[34:20] not a this is not even a brother
[34:22] branham's terminology but we remember
[34:24] that the life of a prophet
[34:27] is a message in itself
[34:29] okay mo
[34:31] noah was not only building not only was
[34:34] preaching an ark but the fact that he
[34:36] was building was the message for the
[34:38] people
[34:39] so god says to brother brandon you will
[34:41] have a son and you call him joseph
[34:44] and people because it's a sign this is
[34:46] the time of perfection this is changing
[34:48] of dispensation this is when when when
[34:52] the shadow becomes the reality
[34:55] definitely so
[34:56] definitely so now this message did not
[34:59] diminish calvary but it puts it right in
[35:03] its right place
[35:04] this message did not diminish the holy
[35:06] spirit but it put it right in the right
[35:08] place
[35:09] because elijah will put everything in
[35:11] its right place
[35:13] this message stops with lutheran
[35:16] thinking about the jews because luther
[35:18] had no idea who the jews were in the
[35:21] plan of god this messenger brought forth
[35:24] the
[35:25] the thoughts from the back part of god's
[35:27] mind can you say amen and we see
[35:30] ourselves in the picture so we see that
[35:32] brother branham that the pillar of fire
[35:34] arrived on the ohio river 1933 and 17
[35:39] years later it arrived there in houston
[35:43] exactly and 13 years later i'm a seven
[35:47] angel appeared
[35:49] like in the life of joe 17 after 13
[35:52] years he was introduced to the king now
[35:54] 1950 1963 seven angel appear who king
[35:58] the king
[36:00] the words the light shalom good morning
[36:03] church the night is over loud is here so
[36:06] we're still living loud he's here that's
[36:08] fine but the bride is not spiritually
[36:10] loud he's here
[36:12] no good morning church
[36:14] he is here hallelujah christ the word
[36:17] we're still waiting for him to meet him
[36:20] we can say in the air i always say it's
[36:22] a changing of dimension but we're not
[36:24] fast we let's make it like this we go
[36:27] all go into the rapture and then we'll
[36:28] see how it was okay what's the changing
[36:30] of dimension what is it what the fine
[36:33] definitely so but it's a special time
[36:36] okay when the king is here i mean
[36:40] the message of today is not god send a
[36:42] prophet in all respect
[36:44] it is the king is here
[36:46] the word is here
[36:48] as as as the star over there and the
[36:51] three stars never let the three young
[36:54] men the three wise men never let
[36:56] themselves to jerusalem or to to
[36:58] themselves
[36:59] the star was leading them to king to
[37:02] christ which is the king
[37:04] now we have seen his star
[37:07] in our generation the seventh star which
[37:09] was william branham and he was not
[37:11] leading us to branham tabernacle
[37:13] he led us to christ which is the king
[37:16] can you say amen
[37:18] definitely so so so certainly we are one
[37:21] of these three of the of of of these
[37:23] three uh
[37:25] let me say these three wise men coming
[37:27] down from from from mesopotamia area
[37:30] right
[37:31] so we see
[37:32] that uh brother blame said it like this
[37:35] now i want you to watch real close in
[37:37] the fifth seal they were given robes
[37:40] they didn't have them said brother brain
[37:42] they were given ropes white robes each
[37:44] one of them now the saints
[37:46] already have one
[37:48] they get it here but there they were
[37:51] given ropes and the saints already had
[37:53] theirs and gone on see
[37:56] that's a big difference
[37:58] they were given ropes by by gods by
[38:00] god's glory hammond now watch ideas
[38:03] now
[38:05] god
[38:06] brings your life in turbulences
[38:10] because he wants to bring you to a
[38:12] certain point of understanding
[38:15] god allows that your life is not a
[38:17] picnic it's not intended to be a picnic
[38:20] and sometimes let me say i'm you
[38:22] understand i'm sometimes missing the
[38:24] right words but something we have to
[38:25] forgive god
[38:27] i mean because he's throwing us in
[38:29] situation that we did not search to be
[38:31] in
[38:32] i mean but but god is the one who brings
[38:34] us out and whenever we go through such a
[38:38] dramatic situation we come out fortified
[38:42] we come out more mature
[38:44] more to be a real christian definitely
[38:46] so
[38:47] so he did he he does it with all his
[38:50] people and he did it with joseph
[38:53] joseph never knew
[38:55] that one day he would be in the bible
[38:59] joseph didn't say uh friends i want to
[39:02] become popular
[39:04] please throw me into the ditch and sell
[39:06] me to egypt please do so i would like to
[39:09] be a character joseph joseph wanted to
[39:11] stay with his family it was not joseph's
[39:15] choosing his disaster
[39:17] it was god's choosing
[39:21] it was god's way
[39:23] and and and and for joseph it was
[39:26] nothing else than a trauma
[39:28] you you can understand that a young
[39:31] brother expect of his older brothers to
[39:33] protect him
[39:35] you see and but but here were these men
[39:38] with their wicked plan and brother brahm
[39:39] said it was just it was it was it was
[39:42] not a pure envy it was how do you call
[39:45] it uh not pure envy it was just a dirty
[39:48] envy that's how he says it of his
[39:50] brothers because of the gift of the
[39:52] young one
[39:53] and
[39:54] the young boy
[39:56] of his family 17 years old he is
[39:59] expecting his brothers to protect him to
[40:01] understand him to help him and they're
[40:03] just just telling him you never know
[40:06] he didn't know where to go
[40:08] he could be just on a slave market to be
[40:11] uh you could imagine what a slave could
[40:13] do not only working
[40:15] let's go a little bit your imagination
[40:16] what could happen to joseph you see on a
[40:19] slave market you know he could end up in
[40:20] something that we will not mention here
[40:22] behind the pulpit he did not know
[40:25] and he was just he was just shouting
[40:27] reuben
[40:28] you cannot do this
[40:30] judah help me and they were just saying
[40:33] goodbye
[40:34] so there was a there was a traumatic
[40:36] situation in the boy's life
[40:39] i can imagine that while he was in
[40:41] asnap's home or in potiphar's home and
[40:44] while he was in the
[40:46] uh
[40:47] in in the prison he was he was yelling
[40:50] he said my god my god why have you
[40:53] forsaken me and god all the time he knew
[40:56] boy i will reveal myself to you
[40:59] the bible doesn't say
[41:01] when god revealed himself to joseph
[41:04] but be sure joseph was not christ that
[41:07] at the age of 12 he knew all things
[41:10] um he did not understand his life but
[41:13] god had a mystery laid into his heart
[41:18] and somewhere on the way
[41:21] god must have revealed to him because
[41:24] god joseph could tell his brothers
[41:26] brothers look god sent me here
[41:30] it wasn't you
[41:31] it was god the bible doesn't say when
[41:34] and how but somehow god revealed his
[41:37] plan to him
[41:38] brother if god does it for our life we
[41:40] come in peace with ourselves
[41:42] we come in peace with our enemies
[41:44] because you know one thing there's
[41:46] nothing in my life that god didn't allow
[41:49] i'm not i'm i'm not
[41:51] an object of any kind of wind i'm in the
[41:54] hands of my father and brother blame
[41:56] said this quote brother branham god is
[41:58] behind every move
[42:01] every move that comes to my life my
[42:03] father allowed it he has a deeper plan
[42:05] into it i mean deaf can you say amen
[42:09] but it was
[42:10] a trauma for him
[42:12] and i thought by myself
[42:14] now if there was enough virtue in the
[42:17] old testament to heal a young man's
[42:20] heart
[42:21] how much more with the baptism of the
[42:24] holy spirit
[42:25] and how much more was this message
[42:28] changing us from the inside to the
[42:30] outside
[42:32] brother we tried everything to make new
[42:34] creatures in the church we tried
[42:35] reformation it never worked
[42:38] we tried pentecostalism it never worked
[42:41] we tried to work on outside people that
[42:44] the dress becomes longer and longer and
[42:46] longer but and i'm 100
[42:48] for it
[42:50] but a long dress will not make you happy
[42:53] that's the other side
[42:54] god wants you to be happy in christ and
[42:58] the long dress is the is the fruits
[43:01] of your connection with god
[43:03] because you want to please your father
[43:06] so so real gospel is not working on the
[43:09] outside of people to make them shine to
[43:12] be good believers
[43:14] real gospel is the operation on the soul
[43:17] of a person because a dove is cleaning
[43:19] itself from the inside to the outside
[43:23] can you say amen
[43:24] i believe one thing i saw how this
[43:27] message changed people
[43:29] look you have always people who come and
[43:33] try to to to steal away your faith
[43:36] let me say you were believer in christ
[43:38] or you gave your heart to the lord as a
[43:40] young person
[43:42] we go to the streets and we make some
[43:44] kind like evangelizations
[43:46] and you have always a critic
[43:48] and the critic comes and he says look
[43:50] that thing with christianity and jesus i
[43:53] mean it's just fake it's just religion
[43:56] there's nothing behind it and then at a
[43:58] certain moment you say hey brother
[43:59] honestly you come too late
[44:02] honestly you come too late
[44:03] because i saw how god changed my life
[44:06] you come too late there's no discussion
[44:08] because i know what it did for me
[44:11] and and and remember that's something
[44:13] when people say yes and uh brother
[44:15] brother marcus i mean in the vision of
[44:17] brother branham did 13 people fell from
[44:20] that bridge of 14 people fell from that
[44:22] bridge i said brother i wasn't there it
[44:24] doesn't interest me honestly but i know
[44:27] what this message did to my heart
[44:30] you have to understand it changed from
[44:32] the messenger to the message we're not
[44:36] talking about william branham as a man
[44:39] when the seals were open brother branham
[44:41] never preached any more of my life story
[44:43] that was over he preached last time 59
[44:46] or 16 in i think it was an angular's
[44:49] temple over there in los angeles when
[44:50] the seals were open brother bryan
[44:52] because eliezer now had done his work
[44:56] and here are greater than eliezers there
[44:58] brother never preached his life story
[45:00] after the opening of the seal because
[45:02] now the man william branham was not
[45:04] anymore so important it went from the
[45:06] prophet to the prophecy it went from the
[45:09] messenger to the message
[45:12] so somebody wants to discuss with me
[45:13] what are 13 people on that bridge of 14
[45:16] i said honestly brother uh i wasn't
[45:18] there i will never be there that's fine
[45:20] let history be history but i know what
[45:22] this word did in my life
[45:25] somebody wants to discuss i think
[45:27] honestly uh i cannot prove it if there
[45:29] were 30 or 14 but i can't prove you one
[45:31] thing you come too late
[45:33] you come too late for me honestly if
[45:35] this message has nothing to say to you
[45:37] this is respected hey give me five
[45:40] that's fine but this message means
[45:41] everything
[45:42] for me because it's my father talking to
[45:44] me
[45:45] it was brother ben's voice if there was
[45:47] a voice behind that voice
[45:50] can you say amen
[45:51] but you see now here is the prophet
[45:54] and this message is the it gives a
[45:56] healing part
[45:58] for our frustrated life
[46:00] because god throwed us into this
[46:04] into this tornado
[46:06] and god is the one speaking to the storm
[46:10] here are many people they come they were
[46:12] long in a false doctrine
[46:15] some kind in a false doctrine he said
[46:17] brother marcus it was so pitiful that i
[46:19] was so long in a false doctrine no it
[46:22] was god allowing for you to be there it
[46:25] shaped you and god had the right moment
[46:27] to take you out god did not come too
[46:29] late it was part of your shapening
[46:33] can you say amen never regret your past
[46:35] my father knew what he did
[46:38] can you say amen
[46:39] this would be the name of the lord so
[46:41] here comes the woman to brother branham
[46:44] and she is
[46:45] not at all she is so nervous
[46:48] and brother brennan prays and she
[46:50] becomes more and more nervous brother
[46:51] ryan preaches the message do you believe
[46:54] she said she had all different people
[46:56] come anoint her in her oil
[46:59] pray for her stomp devils and kick
[47:02] devils and everything else but he stayed
[47:04] right there i said he the devil will
[47:07] stay right there as long as you've got
[47:09] that unconfessed sin in that case it was
[47:12] sin but okay she said brother branham i
[47:15] confessed it to god
[47:18] i said it wasn't god yet you sinned
[47:21] against it was your husband you make
[47:23] that right
[47:24] oh it will break up my home and so forth
[47:26] okay then she said this
[47:29] she said i don't even think of that
[47:32] brother brain said no you don't but your
[47:35] subconscious is thinking of death all
[47:37] the time
[47:39] i mean now let's see one minute in the
[47:41] prayer line of the chicago syria and we
[47:44] understand that we're not talking about
[47:45] psychology we
[47:47] we preach or we show something that this
[47:50] messenger showed to us
[47:52] how we have a conscious and how we have
[47:54] a subconscious in in that story of that
[47:57] woman it was unconfessed sin but it can
[48:00] be a traumatic
[48:02] it can be wounds it can be frustrations
[48:06] and we think we forgot them yes we
[48:08] forgot them but our subconscious is
[48:10] still priced to god
[48:11] we have a very nice uh when it comes to
[48:14] traumatic things or are our uh uh
[48:18] hurted feelings hurted situations uh
[48:22] things where we where we cannot forgive
[48:24] us
[48:25] uh
[48:26] things where we cannot forgive others
[48:29] i want
[48:30] i love that brother but we will never
[48:32] forget it you see it's something that is
[48:35] deeper than just
[48:36] trying to do
[48:38] something god has to make an operation
[48:41] amen if not we become frustrated
[48:44] nice church members but god cannot use
[48:47] it god wants to heal us
[48:49] so that we can go into this rapture
[48:51] without no die no depths
[48:54] no depth i owe anything to anybody and
[48:57] sure nobody owes anything to me
[49:00] everything is really under the blood
[49:02] look brother we have a nice slogan which
[49:04] does not function the nice slogan is
[49:06] this if somebody has something deep in
[49:08] his heart it's it's it's uh oh uh you
[49:11] just forget it and uh
[49:14] uh we put it in the sea of forgetfulness
[49:16] and then we put him just a nice sign
[49:18] fishing forbidden and every ha ha
[49:20] wonderful fishing phobia that's a nice
[49:22] thing but it does not work
[49:24] because everything that is in your
[49:26] subconscious conscious does not know
[49:27] time
[49:29] there's no time
[49:30] it must be dealt
[49:33] by the holy spirit it's an operation it
[49:35] has to be done if not we become just
[49:37] miserable people who cannot forgive
[49:39] ourselves who cannot be forgive others
[49:41] it's the door to to a religious spirit
[49:45] to a judgmental spirit to a to a
[49:48] comparing spirit huh me my family your
[49:52] family look how we are a little bit
[49:53] better than the rest and yeah
[49:55] we want to be happy christian can you
[49:57] say amen
[49:58] i mean look how brother brandon helps
[50:00] that sister brother franco is that fine
[50:02] for you
[50:04] and only this message could explain
[50:06] these things to us
[50:10] here we go all right excuse me sister
[50:13] i have to relax my mind once in a moment
[50:16] now we will be strangers i see that you
[50:18] are strictly a stranger to me
[50:21] look where she starts crying
[50:23] you come from another city
[50:27] you've got a lot of trouble on your
[50:28] heart
[50:29] you got hard trouble to begin with
[50:31] is that right
[50:33] there's a whole lot of blackness i see a
[50:35] black sheep keep following you like that
[50:36] oh it's alive
[50:38] somebody's stole the line
[50:40] and that was a man was professing divine
[50:42] healing
[50:43] he said you was a witch
[50:45] is that true
[50:47] and you've got a whole stir in your
[50:48] church or something about it in that
[50:50] right your pastor's sick right now he's
[50:51] got polio is that right sister
[50:55] don't pay no attention to what them
[50:56] people tell you there are lies and the
[50:58] only things wrong with your hearts that
[50:59] nervous condition got your heart worked
[51:01] up go on home in peace and god bless you
[51:04] you're all right
[51:08] praise be to god look
[51:09] look the the subconscious that we have
[51:13] is like a big container
[51:15] we are filling these subconscious up
[51:19] with all kind of experiences that we
[51:21] make in our life
[51:22] you remember that brother branham says
[51:24] he was at the doctor and the doctor says
[51:26] look you're a strange man because you're
[51:28] subconscious and your conscience is so
[51:30] close
[51:32] that you can see a dream without
[51:33] sleeping is that correct
[51:35] am i therefore it exists it's not
[51:37] psychology it's part of of a makeup of a
[51:39] human being so it's in a hard person in
[51:42] a person's heart we are not preaching
[51:44] about it because i many times preach
[51:45] about the healing through the third pull
[51:48] you see but all kind of even traumatic
[51:51] situation will be inherited
[51:54] through the genes to the next generation
[51:57] the the somebody got a nobel prize for
[51:59] it in the beginning of epigenetic uh
[52:02] inheritances definitely so traumatic
[52:05] city are from the holocaust from situ
[52:08] different
[52:08] different situations for the next
[52:10] generation
[52:11] that is so important
[52:13] now look
[52:15] that woman comes now to the prophet
[52:18] and she does not know what's wrong with
[52:19] her now brother rem said you have a
[52:21] heart problems problem okay
[52:24] look if brother brennan would be a
[52:26] pentecostal preacher okay
[52:28] she would went to him
[52:31] he would see how she is nervous
[52:33] and he would say oh that's the devil
[52:36] that's the devil that's the devil so let
[52:38] the brothers come let make the open
[52:40] old-fashioned prayer lines where all the
[52:42] brothers come together everybody lays
[52:43] hands and and and and that is fine
[52:47] but i believe we are a little bit more
[52:49] far advanced than that kind of a thing
[52:51] i believe that old jewish tradition is
[52:54] fine it's not wrong it's okay but i
[52:56] think we should be a little bit farther
[52:58] on the way
[52:59] amen to take god by his words
[53:02] because honestly i come from germany but
[53:04] i'm not santa claus okay
[53:06] but i have something if you believe it
[53:08] that heals you right on you on your spot
[53:10] amen you don't need my hands to be to be
[53:12] healed to be honest okay that's fine
[53:15] so here is a pentecostal preacher and he
[53:18] says now to that woman look you are so
[53:20] nervous and they're telling your church
[53:22] that you're just a witch
[53:25] that is nobody else than satan you see
[53:29] he will he will try to cast out the
[53:31] devil out of that woman
[53:33] but there the problem is there is no
[53:36] devil in her
[53:38] brother blames first said
[53:40] sister then he says there's nothing
[53:42] wrong with you that's what he says
[53:44] just your nervous condition but if i
[53:46] don't have the true discernment i would
[53:48] say satan come out of that sister
[53:51] stop bothering her
[53:53] you see
[53:54] now first the sister's not helped
[53:56] because she has no satan
[53:58] she has no the prophet said i have all
[53:59] this fine with you
[54:00] i mean so you cannot cast out the devil
[54:03] raise no devil but she has a trauma and
[54:06] which is deep in her soul and here is
[54:08] the prophet it's deep in her in her
[54:10] subconscious and remember the five
[54:12] entrances to the spirit one is conscious
[54:14] ah got it it's there it's part of our
[54:17] life
[54:18] don't try to override it
[54:20] don't try to make a fig leaf and say all
[54:22] is well let's sing a song about it many
[54:24] things has to be treated
[54:27] in order to go into a better future and
[54:29] say lord this hurted me
[54:31] come with your barn from gilead and heal
[54:33] that situation
[54:36] therefore every service that we have is
[54:38] a therapy
[54:40] today we have group therapy
[54:43] they say amen
[54:45] therefore we cannot sleep in the church
[54:46] because every service the holy spirit
[54:49] wants to work on us
[54:51] do something step by step
[54:53] amen so what happens is this now first
[54:56] the sister is not helped second she will
[54:59] go back to her place and thinks i have a
[55:00] devil
[55:01] because the preacher told me
[55:03] so she will never become happy anymore
[55:06] for the rest of her life it's finished
[55:08] brother we cannot play brother branham
[55:12] we cannot play that game
[55:14] because we are playing with the feelings
[55:16] of people
[55:17] and the best is in if they believe us as
[55:20] ministers amen they they will ne they
[55:23] will come to totally into a dead end
[55:26] they say amen we're not brother brandon
[55:28] we must be honest with one another amen
[55:30] but god can't give us a certain
[55:31] leadership what help but what happens is
[55:33] this
[55:35] now
[55:36] it lays in her
[55:38] spirit subconscious somewhere
[55:40] and i do not say
[55:42] that
[55:44] that she will be happy from the next day
[55:46] on because she still had to have
[55:48] reputation in the church to be a witch
[55:50] but i mean if i believed that brother
[55:53] brennan was the prophet of the hour and
[55:54] he would tell me marcus nothing is wrong
[55:56] with me i would believe it
[55:58] and this confession will change me i
[56:02] will not look any more on my symptoms i
[56:04] would look on the spoken word he said he
[56:06] knows because he can see in the other
[56:08] dimension you remember when we were
[56:10] shown the couch potato
[56:12] the one the one who doesn't come from
[56:14] his couch
[56:15] what did brother branham do he he said
[56:18] quickening power brought me behind the
[56:20] curtain of time and i've seen all of you
[56:22] there
[56:23] that makes the couch potato to stand up
[56:26] and say i i know i'm gonna make it
[56:29] i don't know how i don't know when i
[56:31] don't know how fast but i know one thing
[56:33] there is already my positive attribute
[56:36] waiting already
[56:37] so with
[56:39] brother brandon brought us something
[56:40] that no other messenger could give us i
[56:44] believe now that is marcus paul said i'm
[56:46] not boasting this man but i was boasting
[56:48] about the man that i saw
[56:50] amen in the third in my own words okay
[56:53] now who did he saw i believe he saw his
[56:55] own theophany that is marcus i see
[56:58] people see a different but that's me i
[57:00] don't make a doctrine but but this
[57:02] messenger did not only see himself
[57:04] behind the curtain of time but he
[57:06] brought us all together behind the
[57:08] curtain of time
[57:10] and oh you want one thing i make it
[57:12] i make it
[57:14] the church says i don't make it my body
[57:16] says i don't make it my complex it says
[57:17] i don't make it but the prophet must
[57:19] have seen me there
[57:21] so i don't believe my circumstances i
[57:23] look to your holy temple like solomon
[57:26] did
[57:27] can you say amen and now i don't have to
[57:30] hide my life
[57:32] and and and try to to at least if
[57:35] somebody has a trauma the thing is he
[57:37] would always avoid to go around that
[57:39] thing because it hurt the trauma is a
[57:41] wound
[57:43] it's a greek word for a wound in our
[57:45] soul okay
[57:47] abuse church abuse child abuse all these
[57:49] things even a minister can abuse people
[57:52] you see i mean that is so so we have to
[57:55] pay attention to really uh
[57:57] help
[57:58] today i mean when
[58:00] when i was younger i mean we were
[58:02] problem orientated
[58:04] we we could show all the problem in the
[58:06] church today we are solution orientated
[58:09] you must show a way
[58:11] you must so everybody must come out of
[58:13] because gospel is good news
[58:15] we will not change gospel is good news
[58:18] i mean god sometimes shows the problem
[58:20] but he must the holy spirit will always
[58:22] give a way out
[58:23] somebody says brother marcus my
[58:25] situation i have no way i tell you once
[58:28] that jesus is the way
[58:30] and if jesus is the way you have a way
[58:32] there's no dead end for your life
[58:34] he is the way i don't know how i don't
[58:37] know when i don't know what he's doing i
[58:38] don't know what minister comes i don't
[58:40] know how he uses the pastor i don't know
[58:42] who he uses but you have a way because
[58:44] jesus is the way
[58:45] can you say amen
[58:47] so god did this for the young man
[58:50] now joseph
[58:52] was a tremendous man
[58:53] and he had a great advantage in his own
[58:56] life
[58:57] because he was in brother brian's sunday
[58:59] school
[59:01] definitely so
[59:03] we will we will just prove it
[59:05] how he was in brother brian's
[59:08] sunday school yes here we go
[59:11] whatever you put brother
[59:14] you
[59:15] we're missing young people there in the
[59:17] world and the discotheque this evening
[59:20] but what they need is an intercessor
[59:23] what they need is someone who
[59:27] reaches a hand down to them
[59:30] someone who is a friend to them
[59:33] we're not a cult we're not a sect
[59:35] in a sect you are only
[59:38] have a value when you come to church
[59:40] the moment you leave the church you're
[59:42] nobody anymore nobody's greeting you
[59:43] anymore i mean that's a sect we're not a
[59:45] sect we're a church
[59:47] we're family
[59:48] and the family
[59:50] we cannot only think oh i'm glad the
[59:52] family of god this is blah blah
[59:56] because when problems comes god wants to
[59:58] see if we are family or if we sing blah
[1:00:01] blah
[1:00:02] and the most and god allows that people
[1:00:05] fall so deep
[1:00:06] we live in a little city a little
[1:00:08] village
[1:00:09] the young people who go into the world i
[1:00:11] mean they come with blue hair
[1:00:14] same village of thousand people here
[1:00:15] comes an older sister he says he's a
[1:00:17] brother marcus have you seen that sister
[1:00:20] that little girl a
[1:00:22] teenager she has now blue hair i said
[1:00:24] yes she has blue hair because she needs
[1:00:26] christ
[1:00:27] therefore she has blue hair and who is
[1:00:29] the one giving christ that's you not the
[1:00:31] protestant church we give christ to them
[1:00:34] if we don't reach a hand to them we're
[1:00:36] not agreeing at all with their lifestyle
[1:00:38] but we reach a hand and said look
[1:00:40] we're family okay
[1:00:42] amen not agreeing no centimeter
[1:00:45] sometimes young people go into the world
[1:00:46] and and and uh
[1:00:48] i i always keep in touch with them it's
[1:00:50] the truth what i say i'm not
[1:00:51] exaggerating
[1:00:53] so i'm interested in them not in a
[1:00:56] religious way but in a friendly way
[1:00:59] so i'm texting them
[1:01:01] what's up
[1:01:02] i said how are you doing
[1:01:04] they said brother marcus i wasn't in
[1:01:05] church on sunday
[1:01:07] i said that's fine look i'm over 50 i
[1:01:09] understand i'm over 50 but i'm not as
[1:01:11] old that i wouldn't see who's in the
[1:01:13] church or not
[1:01:14] thank you for reminding me it's truly
[1:01:16] appreciated amen then i'm writing how
[1:01:18] are you doing
[1:01:20] brother marcus i will come next week i
[1:01:21] mean that's that's a lie anyhow
[1:01:24] if if somebody says i will come he
[1:01:26] doesn't come if someone succumbed he
[1:01:27] shows up then he's there i mean but i
[1:01:29] said look this is not my question i
[1:01:32] think you have a minister's complex that
[1:01:34] if a minister writes you a whatsapp the
[1:01:36] only question that he has in life where
[1:01:38] were you on sunday
[1:01:40] i'm interested in your soul how are you
[1:01:42] doing man
[1:01:43] can i help you
[1:01:45] how help yeah
[1:01:47] can i pray can we do something for you
[1:01:49] is there something to make life easier
[1:01:51] for you but i don't come to church i
[1:01:53] know
[1:01:54] but we are family
[1:01:56] and we are friends and i believe there's
[1:01:57] still something in you that god will
[1:01:59] call
[1:02:00] so why should i let you i will not help
[1:02:02] the person by letting somebody down can
[1:02:04] you say amen
[1:02:05] so here it is what happens yeah that way
[1:02:08] before i spoke about this brian i mean
[1:02:10] you bring me out of the concept brother
[1:02:12] brian that's exactly so
[1:02:13] why
[1:02:14] now joseph was completely alone
[1:02:19] he was not in the church he was not
[1:02:21] among his family but he never forgets
[1:02:24] what he learned in brother brian's
[1:02:26] sunday school
[1:02:28] he said because
[1:02:30] they had two dreams and he was in the
[1:02:32] prison and they said unto him we have
[1:02:35] dreamed a dream
[1:02:37] and there is no interpreter of it
[1:02:40] and joseph said unto them do not
[1:02:43] interpretations belong to god
[1:02:46] tell me them joseph was the only one in
[1:02:49] egypt believing in one god
[1:02:52] because all egypt believed in gods
[1:02:55] jesus and oziris
[1:02:58] anubis
[1:02:59] joseph didn't say the gods
[1:03:03] but he was in brian sunday school he
[1:03:05] said look wherever you are but don't
[1:03:07] forget you have a father
[1:03:09] don't forget you have an eye that is
[1:03:11] watching you um you might go here and
[1:03:13] you might go but don't forget there is
[1:03:16] there is an agent which is the holy
[1:03:17] spirit who tries to bring you back one
[1:03:19] day
[1:03:20] the thing that we saw in the heart as a
[1:03:23] seed in our children you must have faith
[1:03:26] in it
[1:03:28] god doesn't come too late
[1:03:30] we're not entertaining the young people
[1:03:32] we are throwing seed into their hearts
[1:03:35] to know that one day our arms will be
[1:03:38] too short but god's arm will never be
[1:03:40] too short
[1:03:41] and we had a tremendous messenger whose
[1:03:44] son saw the angel of the lord and he had
[1:03:47] his
[1:03:48] special round of honor
[1:03:50] and brother and billy paul said i did
[1:03:52] everything which was on the calendar
[1:03:58] seeing the angel of the lord and you
[1:04:00] could see how brother branham he has a
[1:04:02] separation over it he doesn't become
[1:04:04] nervous he doesn't think about his model
[1:04:06] family and what will this say what will
[1:04:08] dad say
[1:04:10] i mean he knows one thing
[1:04:12] a calling is a supernatural
[1:04:15] act from god
[1:04:17] god must call a person
[1:04:19] and sometimes people have to have a
[1:04:21] certain way we don't encourage them but
[1:04:23] don't give up if they don't go the way
[1:04:25] that you think because god will not come
[1:04:27] too late
[1:04:30] i remember that billy paul gave the
[1:04:32] testimony he he did not he did not uh
[1:04:36] uh he did not say that he will come to
[1:04:37] bran and tabana he just came as a as a
[1:04:39] visitor one day and brother brain was
[1:04:41] preaching about the prodigal son and he
[1:04:43] was his own son sitting there
[1:04:45] and he said and and and he said the next
[1:04:47] day uh my father and me we went fishing
[1:04:49] you see if people are in a difficult
[1:04:51] situation they don't want to talk they
[1:04:53] invite avoid to talk okay
[1:04:56] people made it like this he said like
[1:04:57] this my father was standing there and i
[1:04:59] was standing here and whenever my father
[1:05:01] went a step in my direction i went a
[1:05:03] step in the other direction
[1:05:04] he said at the end of the day we went
[1:05:06] one tour around the lake
[1:05:10] you see
[1:05:11] amen
[1:05:14] but god allows that we're never ashamed
[1:05:17] of our kids
[1:05:19] because i cannot see that brother
[1:05:21] branham is ashamed of his family
[1:05:23] though
[1:05:24] if you see things it was not everything
[1:05:27] perfect perfect perfect
[1:05:29] but these youngsters they need a friend
[1:05:31] amen can you say amen
[1:05:33] now i believe
[1:05:34] i came to the lord when i was 20 21 and
[1:05:37] i did all kind of nonsense that there is
[1:05:39] but i believe one thing my father was
[1:05:41] never ashamed of me
[1:05:43] because my father said my boy doesn't
[1:05:44] know who he is
[1:05:45] but let me call him
[1:05:47] with a supernatural calling let me call
[1:05:49] him and then his time is over i heard
[1:05:51] the voice of god audible in a
[1:05:53] discotheque this is not your place
[1:05:55] thank god for this
[1:05:57] but i have to understand our youngsters
[1:05:59] you don't have to go into the world do
[1:06:01] you see to come out of the world into
[1:06:03] the into christianity is a test as a
[1:06:05] wonderful testimony it's tremendous
[1:06:09] unbelievable
[1:06:11] but
[1:06:12] having a testimony that having a
[1:06:14] testimony that you never went into the
[1:06:16] world is much bigger
[1:06:18] it's much greater
[1:06:20] it i pull off my head as i said in
[1:06:22] toronto to use me i pull off my head for
[1:06:24] every sister who keeps herself clean
[1:06:28] until the altar i put off my head this
[1:06:29] is a great respect and this time and i
[1:06:31] will live
[1:06:32] my full respect for your attitude god
[1:06:34] will bless it
[1:06:36] don't play around amen if something
[1:06:38] happened don't give up neither but
[1:06:41] fight to keep yourself clean before the
[1:06:44] lord
[1:06:45] and you say amen
[1:06:46] so this was the situation
[1:06:48] they
[1:06:49] as as as as
[1:06:51] as far as joseph was from
[1:06:55] his church from his family from his
[1:06:57] situation the brothers must have
[1:06:59] forsaken him father must have forgotten
[1:07:02] him
[1:07:03] the neighbors they were just murmuring
[1:07:05] about him
[1:07:06] but there was still something in the
[1:07:08] heart of joseph that never left him that
[1:07:10] was god's presence i believe that god
[1:07:14] went with that boy into the prison
[1:07:17] amen god was just
[1:07:19] protecting him because he knew one thing
[1:07:22] joseph
[1:07:23] when you get older there's a work for
[1:07:24] you to do
[1:07:27] maybe you are old already but be sure
[1:07:29] you're becoming older
[1:07:31] and for all of us there's a great work
[1:07:32] to do to go into the rapture
[1:07:34] there's a great thing that god is right
[1:07:36] now doing amen god is working our hearts
[1:07:40] so the revealing part comes
[1:07:42] and
[1:07:43] we see that joseph reveals himself to
[1:07:46] his brothers and god is
[1:07:49] uh
[1:07:51] god is orchestrating all these things
[1:07:53] together look at this
[1:07:57] here's what brother brahem says in the
[1:07:58] 15 and i want you to put on the
[1:08:00] spiritual jacket
[1:08:02] he says jesus gives them robes
[1:08:05] like joseph did to his brothers i mean
[1:08:08] the bible never said they got ropes it
[1:08:10] must be supernatural amen
[1:08:14] look when joseph stood there and when he
[1:08:18] finally
[1:08:19] he made himself known there
[1:08:22] by the altar
[1:08:24] his own altar
[1:08:27] in his place
[1:08:29] his throne he said everybody leave me so
[1:08:32] he reveals himself
[1:08:35] at his altar
[1:08:37] his palace
[1:08:39] his throne
[1:08:41] he's speaking hebrew now i am your
[1:08:43] brother joseph
[1:08:45] said wait a minute okay make a stop
[1:08:50] an altar
[1:08:52] a throne
[1:08:54] is a place
[1:08:56] where
[1:08:58] judgment
[1:09:00] is
[1:09:01] pronounced
[1:09:03] or where
[1:09:06] verdict
[1:09:07] is said
[1:09:09] it's a great
[1:09:10] place of judgment
[1:09:12] a king
[1:09:14] who sits down
[1:09:16] now starts with his judgment
[1:09:21] when he stands up
[1:09:24] the verdict is said it's spoken out
[1:09:27] amen the trial is over
[1:09:30] when the king sits down on his throne
[1:09:33] and brother abraham said joseph at his
[1:09:35] throne
[1:09:36] at his altar amen in his house
[1:09:40] amen
[1:09:42] so whenever a king
[1:09:44] sits down
[1:09:46] on a throne
[1:09:49] it's time for
[1:09:51] trial
[1:09:53] for judgment
[1:09:54] now the bible says this and you now we
[1:09:56] keep in mind
[1:09:58] when the lamb
[1:10:00] takes the book
[1:10:02] of the one who is sitting on the throne
[1:10:05] and the great thing that we learned for
[1:10:07] the messy of the hour it's the same
[1:10:08] person
[1:10:10] we don't believe in that trinity it's
[1:10:12] the same person but it's the changing of
[1:10:14] time amen
[1:10:17] so
[1:10:18] when a king sits down
[1:10:21] or a monarch or a potentate the bible
[1:10:24] says john 19 when pilate therefore heard
[1:10:27] that saying he brought jesus force
[1:10:30] set down in the judgment seat in the
[1:10:33] place that is called the pavement but in
[1:10:36] hebrew gabata so pilate sat down and the
[1:10:40] trial began
[1:10:42] when he was sat down
[1:10:44] on the judgment seat his wife sent unto
[1:10:47] him saying have thou nothing to do
[1:10:50] with that just man for i have suffered
[1:10:53] many things in day in a dream because of
[1:10:56] him
[1:10:57] exodus and it came to pass that at
[1:10:59] midnight the lord spoke all the
[1:11:02] firstborn in the land of egypt from the
[1:11:05] first born of pharaoh that sat on his
[1:11:08] throne
[1:11:10] unto the firstborn of the captives
[1:11:12] exodus
[1:11:14] and it came to pass on the moral you put
[1:11:16] on your spiritual jacket that moses said
[1:11:21] to judge the people
[1:11:23] and the people stood by moses from the
[1:11:26] morning until the evening
[1:11:29] exodus 18 13 in other words in the
[1:11:32] evening he stood up
[1:11:34] judgment was over
[1:11:36] trial was over
[1:11:38] amen ruth
[1:11:40] then when boris
[1:11:42] up then went boaz up to the gates set
[1:11:45] him down there and behold the kinsmen of
[1:11:49] whom boa spake came by unto whom he said
[1:11:52] oh
[1:11:53] such such a one turn of sound turn aside
[1:11:57] sit down here
[1:11:58] and he turned aside and sat down what
[1:12:01] was done at judgment
[1:12:03] at trial
[1:12:04] amen not to condemn but give back
[1:12:08] inheritance
[1:12:09] amen mark
[1:12:11] and jesus said over against the treasury
[1:12:13] and behold and beheld how the people
[1:12:16] cast many into the treasury and many
[1:12:19] that were rich cast in
[1:12:21] much
[1:12:23] what happened
[1:12:24] the judgment the trial comes for that
[1:12:26] little woman jesus said she gave more
[1:12:29] than all the rest of them
[1:12:31] and i saw thrones and they sat upon them
[1:12:34] and judgment was given unto them the
[1:12:37] souls of them that were beheaded for the
[1:12:39] witness of jesus and for the word of god
[1:12:41] which had not worshipped the beast
[1:12:43] neither his image neither had received
[1:12:46] the mark upon their foreheads or in
[1:12:47] their hands and they lived and reigned
[1:12:49] with christ a thousand years judgment
[1:12:51] was given and they sat down
[1:12:54] esther
[1:12:55] now it came to pass on the third day
[1:12:57] that esther put on her royal apparel
[1:13:01] stood in the inner court and the king's
[1:13:03] house over against the king's house and
[1:13:06] the king sat upon his royal throne
[1:13:10] amen
[1:13:11] giving
[1:13:13] that that granted that grace to esther
[1:13:16] and above the firmament ezekiel over
[1:13:18] their heads the likeness of a throne as
[1:13:20] the appearance of safer stone upon the
[1:13:23] likeness of a throne
[1:13:26] and likeness is the appearance of a man
[1:13:28] upon it right okay
[1:13:30] look yeah put on a spiritual jacket when
[1:13:33] a man when a king sits down on his
[1:13:36] throne it's for trial
[1:13:38] it's for reigning it's forgiving a
[1:13:41] sentence
[1:13:42] definitely so
[1:13:44] and behold a woman in the city
[1:13:48] which was a sinner when she knew that
[1:13:50] jesus sat at meat
[1:13:53] in the pharisees house brought an
[1:13:55] alabaster box of anointments
[1:13:58] amen and brother branham refers
[1:14:02] the jews
[1:14:03] under the ultra altar and their and
[1:14:06] their prayers or the people's prayers is
[1:14:10] like an anointing or like like an order
[1:14:12] which goes up into the presence of god
[1:14:14] is that correct so look at this now here
[1:14:17] that woman saw the picture she knew who
[1:14:21] was in jesus
[1:14:23] that it was elohim
[1:14:25] that it was god
[1:14:26] so when jesus sat down in the house of
[1:14:31] simon
[1:14:32] that woman understood the picture she
[1:14:35] said the king
[1:14:36] is sitting down for judgment
[1:14:40] and she takes the alabaster art and
[1:14:42] anoints his feet so that the order goes
[1:14:45] up
[1:14:47] to him
[1:14:50] no matter that jesus said many
[1:14:52] generations would speak of that woman
[1:14:54] that was more than just social
[1:14:57] understanding that was someone who saw
[1:15:00] the picture
[1:15:01] the king sitting now on his throne it's
[1:15:04] time for judgment and what happens
[1:15:06] exactly so jesus stand up he condemns
[1:15:09] simon
[1:15:11] and he gives a sentence to that woman
[1:15:15] amen
[1:15:17] amen
[1:15:18] can you say amen
[1:15:20] the king sitting down
[1:15:22] the judgment is open
[1:15:24] moses sitting down up to the evening but
[1:15:27] in the evening time he stands up now
[1:15:29] trial is over
[1:15:31] sentence is spoken
[1:15:33] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:15:35] amen
[1:15:36] amen jonah
[1:15:39] now for the world come unto the king of
[1:15:41] nineveh and he aroused from his throne
[1:15:43] and he laid his robe from him and
[1:15:45] covered with sacros and sat in ashes now
[1:15:48] look how nice
[1:15:52] is the king of nineveh
[1:15:54] sitting on the throne and what does he
[1:15:56] do he's raining
[1:15:59] he's judging
[1:16:00] he's making decisions
[1:16:02] sitting on his own throne he's the
[1:16:04] highest authority in in nineveh
[1:16:08] and here comes jonah bringing the
[1:16:10] message and he understands who is in
[1:16:12] that prophet
[1:16:13] and he stands up from his own throne
[1:16:16] puts on sack roses and repents himself
[1:16:20] bringing this this judgment upon himself
[1:16:22] and god is so pleased
[1:16:25] because god sees himself in that king he
[1:16:28] says because i myself would stand up
[1:16:30] from my mighty throne and become men and
[1:16:33] take the judgment upon myself
[1:16:37] god saw himself in that unbeliever
[1:16:40] he said can an unbeliever please god
[1:16:43] because we are a little bit taught of uh
[1:16:46] first we can about all the
[1:16:49] sinners we have a right i mean we're the
[1:16:52] eagles
[1:16:53] who else
[1:16:56] atomic fire
[1:16:58] then we think we have a right to
[1:17:00] over every denomination that there is on
[1:17:02] earth
[1:17:03] though brother branham said
[1:17:05] they are nothing other than pennies but
[1:17:06] god uses pennies
[1:17:08] sometimes and then brother brahm said
[1:17:10] this every
[1:17:12] everybody
[1:17:13] everything that used that that served
[1:17:17] god purpose will have a resurrection
[1:17:20] praise be the lord
[1:17:21] let everybody
[1:17:23] who he is
[1:17:24] where if somebody is not called to your
[1:17:26] bride then we shouldn't despise that
[1:17:28] person let him be what god made him to
[1:17:31] be
[1:17:31] but give him a hand of respect and give
[1:17:33] him a hand of friendship
[1:17:35] amen and then we think we can despise
[1:17:38] everybody who doesn't believe in the
[1:17:39] message like us we were raised up in
[1:17:41] that thing
[1:17:42] these pentecostals these
[1:17:45] one and second pull preachers forget
[1:17:47] them and it created an atmosphere of a
[1:17:49] certain arrogance that we had and it was
[1:17:52] life that taught us some lessons
[1:17:54] of respecting people the way god made
[1:17:57] them and having a little bit of a
[1:18:00] patience until god changes situation
[1:18:03] because god had a lot of patience with
[1:18:06] us
[1:18:06] a lot
[1:18:07] a lot why shouldn't i have patience with
[1:18:10] my brother
[1:18:11] why should i be judgmental with
[1:18:12] everybody who is not believing like me
[1:18:14] so so you see did god see himself now
[1:18:17] that's just tremendous again
[1:18:20] you have to understand when when god
[1:18:23] wanted to destroy uh israel and moses
[1:18:27] was was having a better idea than god it
[1:18:30] was christ in moses and and moses said
[1:18:33] oh lord don't do this take me instead of
[1:18:36] them and that was christ the most and
[1:18:38] you must understand god was so proud of
[1:18:40] moses
[1:18:41] he said i can see my character in that
[1:18:44] boy
[1:18:45] amen when abraham when when when he was
[1:18:48] trying to save sodom
[1:18:50] he said lord if there is 50 and if there
[1:18:53] is 40 and god does elohim does this if
[1:18:55] you would not be very interested in that
[1:18:57] whole thing but he thinks by himself
[1:18:59] look this is my boy
[1:19:01] look because it's the heart of god to
[1:19:04] save we can
[1:19:06] god once said that everyone
[1:19:08] gets salvation he knows he will not work
[1:19:11] but it's the heart of god
[1:19:13] to reach your hand and give a chance and
[1:19:15] give a second chance and say that's my
[1:19:17] nature
[1:19:19] and when abraham tried to convince god
[1:19:21] of preserving sodom god says in his
[1:19:23] heart look this is my boy
[1:19:25] this is my messenger
[1:19:27] i remember that brother biscuit gave
[1:19:29] that that testimony
[1:19:31] about brother branham
[1:19:33] and it shows us how we even in our
[1:19:36] understanding how we have to grow into a
[1:19:39] maturity
[1:19:40] of dealing of putting all situation in
[1:19:44] in our hands
[1:19:45] not that we are the object of a
[1:19:47] situation but we are the master of the
[1:19:50] wind whatever happens to our families
[1:19:53] brother biscuit said this they went with
[1:19:55] brother branham to a denominational
[1:19:57] church
[1:19:58] sit in the first row brother bryan was
[1:20:00] called to be preached to
[1:20:02] should preach but they didn't allow him
[1:20:04] because he didn't believe in the trinity
[1:20:06] but they left brother brandon he was
[1:20:08] just sitting with but a huge new church
[1:20:11] and sitting in the first row
[1:20:13] so the minister comes up and brother
[1:20:16] brother i tell you one thing
[1:20:18] there is more lies in religion than
[1:20:21] there is in politics
[1:20:23] you have to fight for a clean heart
[1:20:25] to say heavenly father let this
[1:20:27] character be in me
[1:20:29] amen amen
[1:20:31] here comes that minister oh
[1:20:34] brothers and sisters brother branham
[1:20:36] couldn't come
[1:20:38] he's not here but we are so happy that
[1:20:40] jesus is here everybody everybody shows
[1:20:42] yeah jesus is here
[1:20:43] and brother bryan was sitting there in
[1:20:45] the first world pure lie and brother
[1:20:47] biscuit was sitting beside him and he
[1:20:49] and he wanted to stand up and say here
[1:20:50] is the man what a what a hypocrisy and
[1:20:54] he said and brother rem just stopped him
[1:20:56] in there
[1:20:57] and brother ram did as he if he wouldn't
[1:20:59] there not to embarrass now the situation
[1:21:02] the person and brother biscuit said this
[1:21:04] he said now i understand now i
[1:21:06] understood why he was the messenger and
[1:21:08] not me
[1:21:10] do you understand that this bride comes
[1:21:13] into a stature
[1:21:16] this bride will not be a child with
[1:21:17] charlie oh everybody the church and the
[1:21:20] church and the church

[1:21:31] one taking over that country
[1:21:33] amen
[1:21:34] amen on the other side can you say amen
[1:21:37] so what happened amen here is for seven
[1:21:40] church ages god sent the messenger and
[1:21:42] whenever the messenger is
[1:21:45] rejected brother brahms said
[1:21:47] he seals his people and then
[1:21:50] nothing else comes than just uh plagues
[1:21:54] spiritual death that's what he says so
[1:21:56] there was a judgment for seven for seven
[1:21:59] church ages
[1:22:04] and he's sitting on his throne and here
[1:22:06] comes the lamb taking the book it's the
[1:22:08] same person but what does it mean the
[1:22:10] judgment is over for the bride
[1:22:15] amen

[1:22:18] taking the book
[1:22:20] amen
[1:22:21] throwing it down
[1:22:22] to its seven angel who is on earth right
[1:22:25] at that moment
[1:22:27] what does he do exactly what joseph did
[1:22:30] to his brothers revealing himself at his
[1:22:33] altar
[1:22:34] at his throne
[1:22:35] amen to understand now the seven seals
[1:22:38] are open god explains the whole plan of
[1:22:40] seven church ages

[1:22:44] how he was leading all things and he
[1:22:47] shows joseph look
[1:22:50] that was my way for you and and for his
[1:22:53] brothers and and and and by this
[1:22:57] joseph can forgive
[1:23:00] god
[1:23:01] and he can forgive his brothers
[1:23:04] he now sees the picture

[1:23:46] how can god allow for me and my family
[1:23:49] to go into this gas chamber
[1:23:52] and the person is
[1:23:54] is killed
[1:23:56] but on the other hand sides
[1:23:58] he wakes up and jesus stands there with
[1:23:59] a white robe
[1:24:02] amen it is i mean i preserved it for you
[1:24:05] amen and that person can say praise the
[1:24:07] lord it was a hard life
[1:24:09] but here's my white robe i was born to
[1:24:11] be a jew
[1:24:13] can you say amen
[1:24:14] now look at this so joseph reveals
[1:24:17] himself to his brothers
[1:24:20] as christ is revealing himself to his
[1:24:23] brothers
[1:24:24] because now the judgment is over the
[1:24:26] book is in his head the revelation is
[1:24:27] there he can unfold the plan and what
[1:24:30] happens in the book of revelation a new
[1:24:32] song
[1:24:35] a new song
[1:24:37] now you can't put this in music
[1:24:41] there's a truth behind
[1:24:42] imagine they were in egypt
[1:24:46] and
[1:24:47] under in that slavery
[1:24:51] and here comes the song the miriam
[1:24:53] singers are special
[1:24:55] yeah
[1:24:56] when israel
[1:24:58] was in a gipton land
[1:25:02] let my people
[1:25:05] go
[1:25:07] so they come out of egypt
[1:25:10] red sea everything
[1:25:13] here comes the preacher
[1:25:15] where are the musicians
[1:25:17] let's sing a song miriam
[1:25:19] let's sing a song together yes i have a
[1:25:22] special
[1:25:23] when israel
[1:25:25] was in egypt
[1:25:28] that song is was yesterday
[1:25:31] we are not singing songs of egypt we're
[1:25:33] singing songs of deliverance or not
[1:25:35] [Applause]
[1:25:37] do you understand that brother branham
[1:25:38] said every revival has its songs
[1:25:42] amen but i want to bring in the
[1:25:43] preaching by the opening of the world
[1:25:46] our preaching must be different
[1:25:50] we cannot sing the song of 2000 years of
[1:25:53] a closed book this is the revelation
[1:25:56] of the sons and daughters of god
[1:25:59] this must be positive
[1:26:01] this must be great it must our father
[1:26:03] reveal who we are
[1:26:05] can you say
[1:26:06] amen
[1:26:08] do you understand that message is not
[1:26:11] working on the outside that's part of it
[1:26:14] but our message is not confirmation and
[1:26:17] reformation
[1:26:19] our message is our father speaking to
[1:26:21] our heart and once you understand who
[1:26:23] you are you know how to dress
[1:26:26] the holy spirit will teach us
[1:26:29] amen can you say amen
[1:26:31] so look at this
[1:26:33] therefore
[1:26:35] pentecostalism never worked
[1:26:39] reformation never worked the work on the
[1:26:41] outside of person never worked but what
[1:26:44] worked when god showed his plan who he
[1:26:47] is and who we are and then there is a
[1:26:49] love affair between us and our father
[1:26:52] and then a person stopped my church and
[1:26:53] my church and my church and my church
[1:26:55] what in the future our churches will be
[1:26:57] closed
[1:26:58] that's so
[1:27:00] okay this church bcf
[1:27:04] it's a good auto garage brother but very
[1:27:06] good auto garage i see already here are
[1:27:08] the new ones here are the used cars i
[1:27:10] see and look at this when this church
[1:27:13] will be closed because of the pressure
[1:27:15] we will not cry
[1:27:17] we would say thank you god for the
[1:27:19] wonderful time that we're here but now i
[1:27:21] am the church
[1:27:23] but this is not a few as long as the
[1:27:25] doors are open come
[1:27:27] into the house of your father but when
[1:27:28] this house will be closed this house
[1:27:30] will never be closed
[1:27:32] can you say amen
[1:27:34] blessed be the name of the lord so so
[1:27:36] we're not worshiping the church we're
[1:27:37] not even worshiping brother brother
[1:27:39] branham
[1:27:40] amen
[1:27:41] we're christians no look at this
[1:27:44] fifth seal now i think
[1:27:46] just one thing that holds this nation
[1:27:49] together because they have always
[1:27:51] respected the jews god speaks a brother
[1:27:54] brent speaks of germany
[1:27:58] okay no he speaks of you okay
[1:28:01] that's right give him a place you honor
[1:28:04] a jew and god will honor you
[1:28:08] rather if you saw respect in your life
[1:28:10] you will get respect
[1:28:12] if you are soaring love you will get
[1:28:13] love
[1:28:14] but if we saw arrogance we will get it
[1:28:17] back
[1:28:18] amen now there is a bunch of jews that's
[1:28:20] renegade just like gentiles the same way
[1:28:22] but the real jew
[1:28:24] god put his name on the book before the
[1:28:27] foundation of the world and there he was
[1:28:29] murdered down at his time and remember
[1:28:32] now watch
[1:28:34] what did he do to little benjamin
[1:28:37] which is the type of the hundred and
[1:28:38] forty four thousand as we will get later
[1:28:40] see what he did he is just
[1:28:43] quick
[1:28:44] to bend him in front on his neck started
[1:28:46] hugging him his little brother that had
[1:28:49] been born into the family after he had
[1:28:50] been gone by his mother the first church
[1:28:53] orthodox church the
[1:28:55] four thousand were born in his absent
[1:28:57] absence while he was a way to get his
[1:29:00] gentle bride oh my don't just do that
[1:29:02] something to you
[1:29:05] to us the brother mark is where where
[1:29:08] where is now the difference between the
[1:29:09] 144 000 and all the jews who were killed
[1:29:12] in all the centuries
[1:29:13] look it's a bright type
[1:29:16] because when these jews were killed by
[1:29:19] the plan of god they died and on the
[1:29:22] other side they understood the plan
[1:29:24] god says look you get it you i explained
[1:29:27] you you were jews you had to die but
[1:29:30] said he purposely
[1:29:32] blinded the eyes of his children so that
[1:29:34] the gentiles could come in
[1:29:36] definitely so luther never understood
[1:29:39] that okay they understand god's plan on
[1:29:43] the other in the uh in the other
[1:29:44] dimension the 144 their eyes will be
[1:29:48] opened that they understand god's plan
[1:29:50] already in this dimension
[1:29:51] [Applause]
[1:29:53] now what you believe
[1:29:55] everybody will know on the other side
[1:29:58] because the bible said every knee shall
[1:30:01] bow
[1:30:02] and every tongue will confess
[1:30:06] not only that jesus is lord but that
[1:30:07] brother was the seventh angel everybody
[1:30:09] will know this
[1:30:11] but the bride sees it's already on this
[1:30:14] side
[1:30:15] there's a big difference between the
[1:30:17] bride and the church
[1:30:19] can you say amen
[1:30:20] so so so so look can you say amen
[1:30:24] blessed be the name of the lord so here
[1:30:25] it is
[1:30:27] amen
[1:30:28] joseph and i'm coming to the end i know
[1:30:30] oh wow my time is running i'm i'm i'm
[1:30:32] hurrying up
[1:30:33] now joseph reveals himself
[1:30:37] and he says i am joseph
[1:30:40] joseph doesn't doesn't say look you are
[1:30:42] this and you are that and you are and
[1:30:43] you did this and you did that he said
[1:30:45] just i am joseph
[1:30:49] now the work of a
[1:30:52] redeemer of an intercessor has different
[1:30:55] aspects
[1:30:56] this is what many people doesn't doesn't
[1:30:58] keep in consideration first thing joseph
[1:31:01] had to wait for the ignorance of the
[1:31:04] people
[1:31:05] they were just ignorant they didn't know
[1:31:07] the plan of god so joseph had to have
[1:31:09] his time in egypt
[1:31:11] then joseph was revealing to himself to
[1:31:14] his brothers
[1:31:15] that was at work of an intercessor the
[1:31:17] same way but now changing
[1:31:20] his work
[1:31:22] and now while he was revealing himself
[1:31:24] to his brothers he has to wait still
[1:31:28] because now the rest of the family who
[1:31:30] is not revealed joseph plan have to come
[1:31:32] in they are still in goshen they are
[1:31:34] still in canaan so somebody has to bring
[1:31:36] a message and says look joseph lives
[1:31:39] and he has prepared a place and joseph
[1:31:41] cannot close everything because he waits
[1:31:44] until all the family now understand
[1:31:46] where joseph is
[1:31:48] therefore we are still out in evolution
[1:31:51] finding people
[1:31:53] but i'm happy he's he he is not
[1:31:55] interceding for me this evening because
[1:31:57] of the ignorance of marcus becker that
[1:31:59] would be sad
[1:32:00] amen because he took
[1:32:02] the book amen and revealed himself
[1:32:05] can you say amen but but we believe not
[1:32:07] all of the family is yet in
[1:32:09] therefore we are still waiting therefore
[1:32:11] christ is still jesus is still waiting
[1:32:13] so that we're coming in amen can you say
[1:32:15] amen now look at this
[1:32:18] this is the final point
[1:32:22] when
[1:32:23] joseph was so much healed
[1:32:26] his brother said oh man if this is
[1:32:28] joseph now we will pay back and joseph
[1:32:31] said look it was god
[1:32:33] forget it don't you think that the holy
[1:32:35] spirit has a method of healing our
[1:32:39] of healing our hearts of healing our
[1:32:41] heart feelings of healing our stories
[1:32:44] don't you think the holy spirit wants to
[1:32:45] do it
[1:32:46] i said hey i want you to give the book
[1:32:49] only the lamb can open the book and you
[1:32:50] must be a lamb to be opened the book
[1:32:52] amen amen
[1:32:54] i mean if you hear people with their
[1:32:56] frustration i don't come to church
[1:32:57] because the people and the people in the
[1:32:59] church and the people and the ministers
[1:33:00] and brother marcus and the people and
[1:33:02] forget it
[1:33:03] forget it let's speak about your father
[1:33:06] how he allowed all these things
[1:33:08] to bring us in a certain condition and
[1:33:11] sometimes god allows situations
[1:33:13] sometimes we do not know what lays in
[1:33:15] our heart
[1:33:17] and god says i will show what's in your
[1:33:18] heart
[1:33:19] and i will bring up somebody who is so
[1:33:21] much
[1:33:22] really going on your nerves that they
[1:33:24] which you will see who is still living
[1:33:26] in you
[1:33:27] amen and then you say thank you father i
[1:33:29] didn't know what you revealed the
[1:33:31] circumstances revealed a certain
[1:33:33] immaturity in marcus becker
[1:33:36] so what we do is stand up and say
[1:33:38] heavenly father let me try it again
[1:33:40] let me be your son i try it again i will
[1:33:42] do it better next time
[1:33:44] god says we break we bring it again on
[1:33:46] you amen so that you can do it better
[1:33:48] next time now look at this
[1:33:51] while joseph says i am joseph
[1:33:55] he is
[1:33:58] revealing himself
[1:34:00] but while he is revealing himself his
[1:34:03] family is revealed automatically
[1:34:07] because while he says i am joseph they
[1:34:09] know who they are
[1:34:11] we are his brothers
[1:34:14] look for example joseph would go to any
[1:34:17] kind of an egyptian
[1:34:20] egyptian
[1:34:24] egyptian janitor
[1:34:26] in his palace
[1:34:27] or to any kind of an egyptian prince
[1:34:31] he would go before
[1:34:34] he says i am joseph
[1:34:37] and the man said huh
[1:34:41] but he goes to his brothers
[1:34:44] and says i am joseph and the brother
[1:34:46] said and we are his brothers
[1:34:48] you get it
[1:34:50] why
[1:34:50] joseph
[1:34:52] the revelation of jesus christ is the
[1:34:54] revelation of his bride
[1:34:56] while he is revealing himself the bride
[1:34:58] knows that i'm part of it
[1:35:00] [Applause]
[1:35:03] nobody in the garden of eden could tell
[1:35:05] eve who she is eve could say mr elephant
[1:35:08] um can you tell me from where i come and
[1:35:10] he says the elephant said look uh it's
[1:35:12] wonderful here it's perfect but i don't
[1:35:14] know where i'm what i'm doing here
[1:35:15] honestly it's just nice and the only one
[1:35:18] who could reveal to eve who she is was
[1:35:21] adam
[1:35:22] and the only one who can reveal to the
[1:35:24] bride who she is is the bright room
[1:35:26] while he is by he says who is this
[1:35:29] melchizedek
[1:35:31] the bride knows who
[1:35:33] speaks of me
[1:35:35] amen i mean who is this jesus oh i
[1:35:38] it tells me something it's the right
[1:35:40] amen can you say amen now joseph could
[1:35:43] just go even go to pharaoh pharaoh knew
[1:35:46] a lot of things
[1:35:47] pharaoh was strong in wikipedia honestly
[1:35:50] the whole they had nothing nothing else
[1:35:51] to do just wikipedia just searching
[1:35:54] but joseph could come and say pharaoh
[1:35:58] i'm joseph
[1:36:00] and pharaoh would have said
[1:36:02] so what
[1:36:04] because he was not part of the family
[1:36:07] but when he said to his brothers he
[1:36:10] didn't say you are this you are this he
[1:36:11] says i am joseph
[1:36:14] and everybody in the family said i can
[1:36:15] be a part of it
[1:36:17] can you say amen
[1:36:19] this is what this message does with us
[1:36:21] it shows our true identity we are born
[1:36:25] with a purpose
[1:36:26] god sent us into this earth and this
[1:36:28] messenger took away our our spiritual
[1:36:31] amnesia
[1:36:33] and what is he doing now
[1:36:35] he's molding us into a statue
[1:36:39] and we get our beatings and we're
[1:36:40] standing up and we say marcus stop
[1:36:43] acting childish you're a son of god stop
[1:36:46] acting denominational
[1:36:48] be a boy be a man one day you will get
[1:36:50] the scepter from your father's right end
[1:36:53] and brother abraham said
[1:36:54] said said might or power without
[1:36:56] character is satanic
[1:36:59] amen can you say amen so this last can
[1:37:02] you say amen so far
[1:37:04] isn't that wonderful
[1:37:05] there is a medium remedium
[1:37:09] remedy
[1:37:11] to heal our souls
[1:37:13] it's our father speaking to us
[1:37:15] it's our father revealing it was me the
[1:37:17] time it was not the brother that really
[1:37:19] did well that hurt your feet it was me
[1:37:23] i i brought up that situation between
[1:37:25] you both because i want to see your
[1:37:27] maturity
[1:37:28] can you handle the situation
[1:37:31] i mean in our spiritual minds there's
[1:37:33] two options fight or flight
[1:37:37] every psychologist can fight off light
[1:37:40] too much people in the message that
[1:37:41] search flight
[1:37:43] but we have to fight for brotherhood
[1:37:45] we have to fight for friendship you see
[1:37:48] sometimes people say look brother okay
[1:37:51] that is fine
[1:37:53] the brother is there
[1:37:55] and i'm there
[1:37:56] that is just fine and we live peaceful
[1:37:58] that's not peace that is cold war
[1:38:01] that's not peace that's cold war nothing
[1:38:02] else it's somebody who cannot handle
[1:38:05] that situation
[1:38:06] god allows a lot of situation that you
[1:38:08] just want to say can you handle
[1:38:10] can you now die your own ego and said i
[1:38:13] am right god is not innocent who's right
[1:38:15] but is there somebody said look hey no
[1:38:18] matter we are family
[1:38:20] and the bride cannot be divided we are
[1:38:22] family of god can you say amen
[1:38:24] god allows these things and look last
[1:38:26] quotation
[1:38:28] look
[1:38:30] brother brian
[1:38:31] and all of them that are just around
[1:38:33] okay amen look christ is the mystery of
[1:38:36] god revealed
[1:38:37] christ in you makes him the center of
[1:38:41] life of the revelation
[1:38:43] see
[1:38:44] christ's life in you makes him the
[1:38:47] center of the revelation
[1:38:49] christ in the bible makes the bible a
[1:38:53] complete revelation of christ
[1:38:56] christ in you makes you the complete
[1:38:59] revelation of the whole thing
[1:39:02] brother said see what god is trying to
[1:39:05] get you
[1:39:08] can you say amen god is bringing
[1:39:10] everything up that we come into an
[1:39:12] understanding look i cannot be childish
[1:39:15] i have to grow into a mature i have to
[1:39:18] take the book
[1:39:20] not as a seminary
[1:39:22] i mean
[1:39:23] but let this book form in movie that i
[1:39:27] know
[1:39:28] i'm i'm a child of god
[1:39:31] and god is
[1:39:33] interested
[1:39:34] to form me to mold me every service that
[1:39:37] we have
[1:39:39] is a therapy
[1:39:41] because we wanted to come in our
[1:39:42] theophany and we landed in ohio
[1:39:47] [Laughter]
[1:39:51] and god says hey
[1:39:53] that thing do you understand to bring a
[1:39:55] person into that kind
[1:39:58] of a healing
[1:39:59] this cannot be done in a prayer line
[1:40:02] this cannot be done by laying on our
[1:40:04] hands this comes by spiritual
[1:40:06] understanding spiritual insight for a
[1:40:10] prophetic type of people who really
[1:40:13] can go now behind the curtain of time
[1:40:15] and understands their time
[1:40:17] they understand their life and once they
[1:40:19] understand their life they now
[1:40:21] understand others
[1:40:23] now you become a blessing to others
[1:40:26] now i have don't have to to to feed
[1:40:28] myself to push you a little bit down
[1:40:30] because you understand hey it's family
[1:40:32] of god i have to
[1:40:34] support my brothers because it's a
[1:40:36] family affair
[1:40:38] now we are stopping to say our church is
[1:40:40] you know uh you have to understand we we
[1:40:43] we are the super eagles i mean
[1:40:45] everybody's in the message but
[1:40:49] we don't talk about the church not even
[1:40:51] the park about a family
[1:40:53] a universal family where god has his
[1:40:56] children everywhere
[1:40:58] i don't i don't say that every message
[1:41:00] is a bride i wouldn't say this but god
[1:41:02] has his rights amen god knows where they
[1:41:05] are
[1:41:06] i made a purpose in my heart
[1:41:08] i'm not going like now who is here the
[1:41:11] unbeliever who's who was sleeping during
[1:41:13] my preaching this must be the this must
[1:41:15] be
[1:41:17] the so-called believer you see i mean i
[1:41:20] treat everyone like a bride
[1:41:22] everyone like a bride
[1:41:24] and then i know one thing i cannot be
[1:41:26] wrong in this
[1:41:28] i mean do you agree with everything no i
[1:41:30] don't agree with everything but if god

[1:47:32] amen
[1:47:34] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:47:36] god is so good to bring us the
[1:47:38] revelation of himself
[1:47:41] because if you're part of himself the
[1:47:43] revelation of himself is also the
[1:47:45] revelation of us
[1:47:47] because we find ourselves in him
[1:47:50] amen i was thinking what brother marcus
[1:47:52] was preaching
[1:47:54] that the message is the solution
[1:47:58] you say brother chad you don't know my
[1:47:59] problem i don't need to know your
[1:48:01] problem
[1:48:02] because we all have the same problem the
[1:48:04] same problem come through hybridization
[1:48:06] because of rejecting the word of god
[1:48:08] and now we've fallen into this condition
[1:48:10] the whole world is into the condition
[1:48:12] because of leaving the protection of the
[1:48:14] word
[1:48:15] and then spiritual blindness came we
[1:48:17] come in spiritual amnesia and all of
[1:48:19] these conditions and everything happened
[1:48:21] because of this and we're all we all
[1:48:23] have the same problem
[1:48:25] we attach all kinds of names to
[1:48:26] different symptoms but it all comes back
[1:48:28] to the same root problem
[1:48:31] but the message is the solution
[1:48:34] i don't care what symptom you're dealing
[1:48:36] with or what effect of the fall that
[1:48:38] you're dealing with in your life amen
[1:48:40] the solution was the message
[1:48:42] god knew before the foundation of the
[1:48:44] world amen that he would open this
[1:48:47] revelation in the end time because in
[1:48:49] the end time we would have absolute
[1:48:51] victory over hybridization in the change
[1:48:54] of a body
[1:48:55] and what will bring the change of the
[1:48:57] body faith what produces faith the
[1:48:58] opening of the word
[1:49:00] so the solution is the message amen
[1:49:03] and i'm so thankful that god in this day
[1:49:05] and the day that we live amen took away
[1:49:08] spiritual amnesia and brought the
[1:49:10] solution to every problem is the
[1:49:13] revelation of the word no matter what
[1:49:15] we're dealing with amen the revelation
[1:49:17] of the word will fix it amen
[1:49:19] and i think sometimes for too many years
[1:49:22] we've we've tried to find solutions
[1:49:24] we've tried to find help self-helps and
[1:49:26] solutions and and great men and great
[1:49:29] ministries and we're trying to find amen
[1:49:31] the the the pill that will work the the
[1:49:34] solution the solution was given to us in
[1:49:37] the opening of the word
[1:49:39] and it will just go to the opening of
[1:49:41] the word and understand that whatever
[1:49:43] problem i have the revelation contained
[1:49:45] in this word will solve that problem
[1:49:48] then we found the solution amen
[1:49:51] the problem is we have the solution and
[1:49:54] we lay it down to go find the solution
[1:49:56] but the solution is the message
[1:49:59] because the message is christ it is
[1:50:01] christ fully revealed in this day
[1:50:05] to explain to us
[1:50:06] our life and how it got messed up
[1:50:09] and why we think wrong sometimes and why
[1:50:11] our emotions lead us in wrong ways and
[1:50:13] why people have hurt us and why there's
[1:50:15] problems in the world it's all explained
[1:50:17] in the message
[1:50:19] it's all christ revealing himself
[1:50:22] and revealing our position in him
[1:50:25] and how everything got messed up to
[1:50:28] begin with
[1:50:29] but how he's going to make it all right
[1:50:32] and i thank god every problem i have
[1:50:34] every complex every wrong thought is
[1:50:36] fixed by the revelation of the word
[1:50:40] and i say god help me not to forsake the
[1:50:43] solution
[1:50:44] looking for a solution the solution is
[1:50:47] the word that you've given us in this
[1:50:48] day the solution is on those tapes the
[1:50:51] solution is and then those messages the
[1:50:53] solutions is in fellowship with
[1:50:54] believers as they fellowship on the word
[1:50:57] that's the solution amen as you feed on
[1:50:59] the word as you come to services as you
[1:51:01] read your bible that's the solution
[1:51:04] so we all have problems
[1:51:07] but we all have been given a solution
[1:51:09] and i thank god
[1:51:11] that there's an answer
[1:51:13] to the question
[1:51:15] what is the question i don't care what
[1:51:16] the question is
[1:51:18] we have the answer i thank god for that
[1:51:22] man let that let the holy spirit take
[1:51:24] that open book word
[1:51:26] and begin to heal the wounds that are
[1:51:28] inside
[1:51:30] because all is well
[1:51:32] with the plan of god amen he hasn't
[1:51:34] forgot about us he hasn't made any
[1:51:36] mistakes with us amen amen he knows what
[1:51:39] he's doing let him know what he's doing
[1:51:42] and let his way be perfect
[1:51:45] and come to the real solution
[1:51:47] and take it as a solution
[1:51:50] not as church not as religion not as a
[1:51:52] better understanding but take the
[1:51:54] message as the solution to every problem
[1:51:57] we have marriage problems this is the
[1:51:59] solution amen we have complexes this is
[1:52:01] the solution we have heard from the past
[1:52:04] this is the solution this is the answer
[1:52:06] to the problem
[1:52:08] god would bring amen and what is it
[1:52:10] that's going to fix the jews amen what's
[1:52:12] 144 000 going to receive this same
[1:52:15] message that you're feeding on is what
[1:52:17] they'll believe and that'll be the fix
[1:52:18] to the problem
[1:52:21] so god brought the cure at the end to
[1:52:23] fix everything and we happen to live in
[1:52:25] that day
[1:52:26] i think it's a privilege to be alive
[1:52:28] today the one the one generation out of

[1:52:49] faith and if we receive it by faith it
[1:52:51] will do the work he intended for it to
[1:52:53] do
[1:52:54] because god's going to have a mature
[1:52:56] bride my brother marcus was saying he's
[1:52:59] not brother bam said he's not coming
[1:53:00] back for a little girl he's coming back
[1:53:02] for a fully mature bride
[1:53:04] and this message is maturing us
[1:53:06] into his very likeness amen
[1:53:09] let it do its work
[1:53:11] oh praise be to god i enjoyed the word
[1:53:14] it helped me
[1:53:15] it fed me it was bomb from gilead for my
[1:53:18] soul
[1:53:19] amen i trust it was for you to
[1:53:22] thank you brother
[1:53:23] amen continue to pray for brother marcus
[1:53:26] as he travels he's got a big project
[1:53:28] that he's working on and man just pray
[1:53:30] that god will give him wisdom and direct
[1:53:32] his footsteps and give him the help that
[1:53:33] he needs at the right time
[1:53:35] and that that it'll be a blessing to
[1:53:37] many people and he's got other services
[1:53:38] to attend to here and preach before he
[1:53:40] goes home so just pray for him and pray
[1:53:43] that he gets a safe journey home and
[1:53:45] then he'll be a blessing
[1:53:46] everywhere he goes

[1:53:49] the lord
[1:53:51] lord jesus we thank you for this word
[1:53:53] that you've given to us
[1:53:55] for god there was nothing that we can do
[1:53:57] in and of ourselves there still is yet
[1:53:59] nothing that we could do to help
[1:54:01] ourselves we can't change ourselves we
[1:54:03] can't help ourselves we can't make our
[1:54:05] problems go away we can't find our own
[1:54:08] solution
[1:54:09] but god we believe that you have given
[1:54:11] us the solution to every problem
[1:54:14] when you revealed your word to us you
[1:54:15] gave us everything lord we don't need to
[1:54:18] ask for more power the power was in the

[1:54:29] asking that you open our eyes to it lord
[1:54:31] that we can see it and receive it by
[1:54:33] faith and allow the word to do the work
[1:54:35] that you intended for it to do in this
