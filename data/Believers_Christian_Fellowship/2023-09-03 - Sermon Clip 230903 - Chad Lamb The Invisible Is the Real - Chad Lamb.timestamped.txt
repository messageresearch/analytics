[0:00] so when we start talking about the
[0:01] thoughts of God Amen we've got to break
[0:04] out of the natural and move beyond the
[0:06] limitations of our mind and recognize a
[0:09] perfect mind that when he thought of
[0:10] himself it was a perfect thought
[0:13] it was an eternal thought he was
[0:15] thinking of himself amen what is the
[0:17] Eternal thought of God it's his eternal
[0:19] thought about himself how he will
[0:21] Express himself his attributes the
[0:23] fullness of him being expressed as a
[0:26] family God thought that before the
[0:28] foundation of the world and you were
[0:29] part of that thought because you were
[0:31] intended to be part of that expression
[0:36] so I know I mean when we start dealing
[0:38] with this we're dealing with things that
[0:40] are so far removed from the things we've
[0:42] known all of our life that only only
[0:44] faith is going to allow us to penetrate
[0:46] beyond our carnal mind beyond all of our
[0:49] experiences beyond the natural that
[0:51] we've been locked into and pierced
[0:53] beyond all of that and see that this is
[0:55] absolutely nothing but the truth and the
[0:57] only real real there is
[1:03] so I want to say the statement again
[1:05] thus the thoughts of God are Eternal
[1:06] they are real
[1:10] I want to make this other statement from
[1:11] the paragraph before the bride was
[1:13] already in his mind
[1:15] she was existing in his thoughts
[1:21] sometimes I we've had the tendency
[1:25] to almost downplay that
[1:28] like
[1:29] I was there before but not only in his
[1:31] thoughts is there anything more real
[1:33] than his thoughts
[1:35] is there any existence more real than
[1:38] his thoughts
[1:41] so don't say that was only in his
[1:43] thoughts
[1:44] say that was already in his thoughts
[1:46] that's where everything originated from
[1:49] that makes it more real than any other
[1:52] expression that is the real expression
[1:54] that's the genuine that's the first
[1:56] that's I hope you see what I'm saying
[1:59] we can't say well you know I existed
[2:01] before I was in heaven before I have
[2:03] representation in him well that was only
[2:05] as a thought my goodness you want
[2:07] anything more than that I mean only as a
[2:09] thought a genuine thought of God an
[2:11] attribute of God God thinking of himself
[2:13] God himself I was there real existing in
[2:18] his thoughts and you say a statement
[2:19] like only in his thinking only is
[2:21] thinking where else do you want to
[2:23] originate
[2:24] do you want to pop out somewhere else
[2:26] down the line no I want to originate
[2:28] right there and if I originate there no
[2:30] matter where I pop out down the line it
[2:33] goes right back to my original existence
[2:35] in the mind of God
[2:39] so you got to go so far beyond this
[2:42] carnal so far beyond the tangible so far
[2:45] beyond Realms and dimensions
[2:47] because Realms and dimensions were
[2:49] created to express God's thoughts
[2:56] I'm telling you this message is so deep
[2:59] no earthly man could have preached this
[3:01] but it's so simple
[3:04] it's not complicated but when you try to
[3:07] understand it by carnality it just
[3:10] doesn't add up because I only know
[3:11] matter space and time I only know here
[3:14] and there I only know now and then but
[3:16] there was a time that I knew before that
[3:19] and there's something inside of me that
[3:21] still knows what I knew before that
