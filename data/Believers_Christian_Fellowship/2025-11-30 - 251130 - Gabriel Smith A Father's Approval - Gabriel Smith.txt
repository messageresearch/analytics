If we could all stand as brother Gabe comes, sing, I give my mind. I give my mind completely to you. Lord, fill me with your thoughts. Make it all brand new. Change my life. Let me live in all that's true. I just want to think like you. Oh, take me and walk me. teach me to be still. Lead me and guide me. Show me your perfect will. I give my life. Come be to you, Lord. Fill me with your thoughts. Make it all brand new. Change my life. Let me live in all that's true. I just want to think of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Trust um it's everyone's heart's cry this morning. I just want the mind that was in Christ to be in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh greet you all this morning in the name of the Lord. Oh, praise the Lord. We got some visitors in the house of God. &gt;&gt; And so we just want everyone to feel at home and uh feel welcome. Trust that uh you all had a good Thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh appreciate uh the Lord Jesus giving us another year. And um just want to um mention uh our precious brother Bob Brooks this morning. Uh he's at home resting. Um he had um some problem with some uh blood clots, I believe, in his lungs. And so he had a a a procedure done a day or two ago. And so thankfully he's at home resting. And so if you I tell you, I love that soldier. &gt;&gt; Hey, brother Bob, you know, he just &gt;&gt; I love that man. And uh so just trust that uh God give him a speedy recovery. &gt;&gt; And um talked to pastor last night. And so he's already he was already at Junction City yesterday. So um just want to remember him that the Lord will give him the right thought to bring to the people to help them and give them traveling mercies. And so um I I got just a little something on my heart and I I really do coveret your prayers this morning. Um, I am uh I'm a little nervous. I um uh uh uh you know, I I um I'm I'm going to uh trust that the Lord will do heart surgery on us all this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And um I uh trust that it'll be a blessing to you. So um we we'll just read the the book of Luke um the uh 15th chapter. Very familiar portion of scripture. Luke chapter 15 and verse 17. Uh just jump right in here in the middle of the the the story, but I know it's familiar to to most of us if not all of us. speaking of the prodal son after he had lived riotously. Uh, I appreciate the 17th verse because thankfully he came to himself, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And uh, I'm sure some of us, all of us ought to be able to realize that it's just the grace of God that we came to ourselves. &gt;&gt; And he said, I I have hired servants of how many hired servants of my father have bred enough despair and I perish with hunger. I will arise and go to my father and say unto him, Father. I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. Make me as one of thy hired servants." And he arose and came to his father. And when he was yet a great way off, his father, oh my, his father saw him and had compassion &gt;&gt; and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. And the son said unto him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son." But the but the the father said unto his servants, "Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him, and put on his ring, put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet, and bring hither the fatted calf." and he killed it and he said, "Let us eat and be merry. For this my son was dead and is alive again. He was lost and is found." And they began to be married. I'd like to speak to you this morning uh by the help of the Lord on a father's approval. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, truly we love you. this morning and just so grateful for your grace and mercy and to be called by your name. And Lord, uh my my heart is grateful for the news for brother Bob and coming through the surgery and and Lord, I just pray that you would bless his recovery &gt;&gt; and give him health and strength. And Lord, pray your blessings be upon his precious wife, Lord, Sister Suzanne, as she's ministering to his needs. We just pray that you would undergurt her, Lord. And Lord, as we look to you this evening, this morning, this morning, asking Lord that you would have your way in this service, we just ask that you would take the forefront, the preeminence, and that I would be able to just yield myself to you in a way that you could minister to your children. Truly, Lord, that's our heart's desire is just to receive something from you. feeble men that we are, but we bring what we have and we lay it at your feet and ask that you would just receive and use as only you can. We just ask your blessings upon our pastors. He's a way, Lord, that you would just stir up the gift that's within him and pray that you would bless his efforts, Lord, and bring them home safely, all for your glory. God, we love you and we praise you and we commit all we are into your hands and we ask these things to be so in Jesus lovely name. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. a a father's approval and um I um I think of um the prodal son and um I hope that the Lord will help me to be able to say the right words to help you and encourage you um during this uh holiday season. Um, you know, the the prodal son, I think we can all relate to in some way, shape or form. Um, he he was um, you know, he he had done some things in his life that caused a lot of regret, a lot of pain. And you know the amazing thing is is that he when his father saw him his father ran and no doubt he didn't run with anger he didn't run with ragemen. But in that prodal son's mind, he was so he had a servant's mentality &gt;&gt; and he was missing the father's love and he could only see that he was not worthy. And I think we as human beings is one of our great struggles of the day is seeing our worthiness. And and uh especially as men, we as men, we are groomed and raised from birth to base who we are on what we can do. Nine times out of the 10 when we meet somebody, we want to know, well, what do you do? &gt;&gt; And and if somebody has a simple job, well, they get placed on a lower rung. And we may not even intentionally mean to do it, &gt;&gt; but it's it's the society in which we live in. &gt;&gt; Amen. that it's based upon your bank account and what you've done in life, what you've accomplished, what your worth is. And we as human beings and men, we we base value, conscious or unconscious, on what we do. And um um I think it's so important for us to be um mindful of these things in life because we can miss out on the light of a lot of life's opportunities by basing who we are on what we're worth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz really uh brother Brennham said he's just a clot of Indiana dirt. Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; And and you uh uh may have your chest pumped out this morning because the Buckeyes beat the Wolverines. And &gt;&gt; but remember, a Buckeye is just a worthless nut. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, but you know, brother Brandham tells us that uh when he's speaking of the prodal, he says uh we heard his voice and we cried out as did the prodical son. Save me, oh my father. I I am returning to thee. A son can go a long time before he recognizes that he is a son. In fact, a lot of true Christians are like the story of the baby eagle that was hatched out under a hen. You know, that eagle is a type of the true believer. And so, we can go a long time in life before we finally recognize who we truly are. &gt;&gt; And we can get past all of the facads that we put on. And you know, no matter whether you was in this message, born in it, you may have been born with a message silver spoon or you may have come off the streets. But still in the eyes of God, uh uh uh we're all the same. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And you know, uh brother Brandham tells us, he says, "God leads his people through great trials to purge them. And sometimes it takes years to do it. &gt;&gt; Years to do it." And as for myself tonight, I believe that right now, God is training such men to meet the front line. Men are going to be at times shook from their feet. Sometimes look like the whole thing's falling. And yet in the midst of all they know that living God and keep their face forward, keep moving on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know I I I I think of the great dilemma that we are in today of of wanting our father's approval as as that uh prodal son wanted. He he didn't feel worthy of his father's approval. And many times we as human beings, we uh I think all of us, if we would be honest enough, uh uh sometime some of us right now are still seeking our father's approval. And I'm speaking of your earthly one right now. And and we as men, if we would be honest with ourselves, sometimes we search our whole life just longing to hear daddy say, "I'm proud of you." And I I'd say this to all of you fathers. If you haven't said that to your children in a while, you need to be m mindful of the longing that's in your child's heart right now. Because when we raise children, you know, we have to raise our children like God raises us. &gt;&gt; Amen. with with unconditional love. &gt;&gt; And too many times we bl we we we put too many conditions on our children that when you attain to this or you have to do this and and it it it it's really quite traumatizing to a child, believe it or not, to put conditions on them. You ought to love your child just because they're your child. &gt;&gt; And that may seem real simple in a in the house of God, but remember that. Write it down and apply it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Tomorrow morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Apply it when they get that F on their grade. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Apply it when they're not on the honor roll. apply it when they don't want to go to college. &gt;&gt; See, because we have to God God loves us unconditionally. &gt;&gt; That's the unconditional covenant of grace that God does not put stipulations. God so loved us that he gave. &gt;&gt; And we as human beings have to be mindful that we have to apply that same principle on our everyday lives that we love unconditionally. It's not based on what they are or what they're going to be. It's just because they're mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because God gave them to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's enough. &gt;&gt; That's right. You don't have to do anything &gt;&gt; to earn my love. &gt;&gt; It's always going to be there. &gt;&gt; But you may say, "But that's not how I was raised, Brother Gabe." And that's your battle. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because we'll go through life and and and we'll realize so many times in life that we done it wrong, &gt;&gt; we didn't raise them the right way. though they was in a message church and though they was at every youth meeting and though they was at every Wednesday service and and though we had family devotions but there was still things in our life that we missed. But the battle brother, the battle, dad, is to be able to go and say, "I done it wrong." See, because it's it's it's it's when we're in our private life. It's when we're all alone that we can go to our children and say, "I done it wrong and I'm sorry." You know, sometimes we don't realize the value of just a simple I'm sorry because all that child wants is to hear the approval that look and and you know we we we don't re we don't see the value of being able to apologize and repent to our children because what you're actually doing is you're making the gospel real. &gt;&gt; Because they see that a grown human being is applying what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I've and I've found in my own life that it it holds so much weight &gt;&gt; to be able to repent. Yes. &gt;&gt; You you know you know brother Brandham longed for his father's approval. &gt;&gt; So much so that when when he was with one of his daddy's friends and this man really loved brother Brandham. The the man loved brother Brandham so well that he was going to let him borrow his boat to go down and I think it was duck hunting or something. And but that man whipped out a whisk a flask of whiskey one day and and and brother Brandham would look at that whiskey flask and he says I remember the next time my father offered me a drink I told him I told him he he said I I I was assisting because he didn't he didn't take it. I took the bottle and I started to take it and while I was standing there I started to drink it. I heard something and brother Bram talks about the whirlwind and he says if it would have been me I would have drank it &gt;&gt; but it was God protecting his gift &gt;&gt; that had been born. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now this is brother Brandham wanted his father's approval. &gt;&gt; So much so that even though the voice of God told him, don't you ever drink or smoke or defile your body in any way, there'll be a work for you to do. He didn't just tell him once, but he had TO KEEP GOING BACK TO HIM OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT LITTLE BOY WANTED HIS FATHER'S APPROVAL. &gt;&gt; THAT TRAUMA ON HIS LIFE WAS SO STRONG &gt;&gt; THAT IT WOULD HAUNT HIM HIS WHOLE LIFE. You you you think it was there was a reason why he would want to become a boxer when he when he got older &gt;&gt; cuz he couldn't drink or smoke or defile his body in any way. But but there would be a work for him to do. But while he was running from that work, he had to be a tough guy. &gt;&gt; Right. He would go out west and then want to what? Become a rider. &gt;&gt; HE COULDN'T AFFORD THE THE STIR ALL THE THE CHAPS AND ALL THAT. SO, HE HAD TO SETTLE FOR A PAIR OF LEVIS'S, but he realized he wasn't a rider. &gt;&gt; HE REALIZED ONE DAY HE WASN'T A BOXER. &gt;&gt; He was going to be a soldier for God. He he would he WOULD COME TO A PLACE IN HIS LIFE THAT THAT SAME TEMPTATION WOULD COME UNTO HIM AGAIN WHEN HIS LITTLE ANGEL WOULD PULL OUT A cigarette and offer it to him. AND HE WAS DETERMINED &gt;&gt; to smoke that cigarette. He said just as determined as he is to preach the gospel that morning. BUT THERE WAS THAT SAME WHIRLWIND THAT WOULD COME WHIRLING, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AND IT WOULD BREAK HIM IN SUCH A WAY BECAUSE THIS LITTLE ANGEL WOULD CALL him a &gt;&gt; AND THAT THAT THAT WORD WOULD HAVE SUCH AN IMPACT ON HIM THAT IT WOULD CUT HIM TO HIS CORE. &gt;&gt; AND HE WOULD GO WALKING DOWN THE ROAD WITH THEM WITH THEIR LIGHTS ON MAKING FUN OF HIM. and he WOULD GO TO GOD AND SAY, "LORD, I JUST want to die." That was the first time he mentions wanting to die the death. AND THAT WAS NOT JUST THE FIRST AND ONLY, but it WOULD COME IN WAVES ALL THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE, &gt;&gt; WISHING THAT THIS WORLD WOULD PASS FROM HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE TRAUMA WAS SO INTENSE. &gt;&gt; AND THE AMAZING THING IS HE WOULD SAY GOD IS PROTECTING &gt;&gt; THE GIFT. &gt;&gt; GOD WOULD PROTECT THE GIFT, &gt;&gt; BUT HE WOULDN'T PROTECT THE HEART OF A LITTLE BOY. God would protect the gift for you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God would not protect the heart of that little boy. There would come a time where there would be such heartbreak that he would be on that telephone pole and see the shape of that cross and want the life to leave his body. So much so that he would pull off his gloves and start to reach for that power line that would send tens of thousands of volts electricity and break every bone in his body. &gt;&gt; But something happened. Amen. &gt;&gt; God would protect the gift, &gt;&gt; but he didn't protect his heart. &gt;&gt; Bear with me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh yeah, it it'll take a minute for you to me just marinate on it. Brother Baron says, "The thing of it is it's in my own nature. I love to listen. I like to help everyone that I can. In doing so, I let my nature get in the way from God. Don't you see? My will of things is not always God's will of things. And people will ask me to do things and I love people. As I've always told you before, at one time I didn't have many friends because I was considered amongst the people that I was a a grown man, but the trauma still comes out. &gt;&gt; He said, "I didn't have many friends, but since I come out and found God's people, he's given me up in the millions of friends. and love them so well to that I just do anything for them. You know, I want you to see I want you to see the extremes that that God when brother Brandon preaches God hiding in simplicity. He goes, "I couldn't I couldn't get anyone to talk to me. Nobody cared for me. And now I have to hide to get a little rest." And now the Lord has given us this grace place and the great things that he's done. AND HE'S GIVEN ME BESIDE A BAD NAME, HE GAVE ME A NAME LIKENED TO SOME OF THE GREAT MEN. &gt;&gt; TO ME, IT'S THE GREATEST PROPHET. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; THAT STRUCK THE FACE OF THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; OUTSIDE OF OUR LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Gabe, you're awful full of him." I am cuz God sent him to me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I am Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Hey, brother brother Chad can say he's Revelation 10:8. I CAN SAY I'M MALACHI 4. &gt;&gt; HUH? &gt;&gt; COME ON, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HELLO. YOU SAY, "BROTHER GABE, YOU &gt;&gt; BEHOLD, &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; sin, brother Gabe, &gt;&gt; will you marry and RANDOM BEFORE THE COMING OF THE GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF THE LORD? &gt;&gt; YOU READ YOUR NAME IN THERE &gt;&gt; AND WE'LL FIGHT IT OUT IN THE VESTIBULE." &gt;&gt; Brother Jeremy, uh, Brother John, if you just a little officiating there, brother I don't want to be sevenfooters. I just give me a little one. One of you little ones. But brother Brown said he gave ME A NAME LIKE some of the great MEN AND HE'S CALLED OFF MY ENEMIES WHEREVER I WENT. THERE'S NEVER BEEN NOTHING STAND BEFORE IT WHEREVER IT WENT. AND HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR THAT. AND HOW WOULD I EVER KNOW AS A LITTLE RAGGED KID UP HERE TWO OR THREE BLOCKS FROM WHERE THE INGRAM SCHOOL WHEN I WAS A LAUGHING STOCK OF THE SCHOOL FROM BEING SO RAGGED AND SKATE ON THE OLD POND? HOW DID I EVER KNOW THAT DOWN BENEATH THAT POND WAS A SEED OF A LILY THAT COULD BLOOM LIKE THIS? AND HOW DID I EVER KNOW THAT NO ONE TALKED TO ME YET HE WOULD GIVE ME A NAME THAT WOULD be honored amongst his people? &gt;&gt; WHY WOULD GOD PUT HIM ON WHY WOULD GOD PROTECT THE GIFT &gt;&gt; BUT NOT PROTECT THE LITTLE BOY? &gt;&gt; WHY WOULD HE PUT HIM ON SUCH EXTREMES OF HIGHS AND LOWS? Brother Brandon would say this. I had some scars when I was a kid. I know things that happened that's kind of turned me that way. &gt;&gt; But it was all God making and molding me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. for this hour. &gt;&gt; He had to have a man &gt;&gt; that would have just the right thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The right kind of thing that when he spoke whether you was on the lowest of the low or the highest of high you would could relate to him. &gt;&gt; He would be relatable. Look, you &gt;&gt; ex My wife just told me this morning on the way to work, experience is the greatest teacher. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; You You look Look, &gt;&gt; we can look, we can read this all we want to. &gt;&gt; But you got to experience it. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, we may think some of those things was to hurt us, but it's really to mold us and shape us. Yes. &gt;&gt; To be rugged Christians. &gt;&gt; Not hot bed plants that have to be pity pattied around and patted on the back with predestination and soft &gt;&gt; cupcake, but rugged &gt;&gt; rugged. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram tells us, he says, "We only have to go through those schools of sufferings. to know how the other fella feels. &gt;&gt; You say God would put him through all of that. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; But because he had you on his mind. &gt;&gt; See, if if I'm in a valley, I want somebody to come to me in that valley that's been in that valley before me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And in order for you to come to me when I'm in that valley, you had to go to that valley first. &gt;&gt; Cuz I had to be able to see you in that valley and out of the valley &gt;&gt; and then come back down into the valley and show me how to get out of the valley. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's all for God's purpose. God takes the black things that are in our life and he makes them crystal clear white. &gt;&gt; You you look at the prophet of God. This is This picture is so amazing to me. I want you to look right smack dab in the middle is Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; And if you look to Brother Brandham's right side, that big tall man is Oral Roberts. &gt;&gt; So you have two out of the three angels. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But this is what I love about it. &gt;&gt; Look at that. right there. That makes me love him so much more &gt;&gt; because look, think about this. This right here, that's Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; That's Revelation 10:7 1-7. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30. This is this is the man that held the king's sword. &gt;&gt; This is the man that that that that had a supernatural uh pillar of fire follow him his whole life. And we would think WE WOULD BE WOWED AT THAT. YOU you would see pictures where he's GOT THE LICK OF FIRE on his shoulder and he he would be the one that God would use to loose the book of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when he would stand before He would get on his tippy toes. He would try to make himself. I I don't know. To me, to me, I love that because he just wanted to fit in. a man that would stand against the world &gt;&gt; and all the denominational ideas that would come against God's word. &gt;&gt; But yet there was a still a measure of frailty in that prophet of God. &gt;&gt; And and to me God would allow that to get taken and captured. Now, some people may look at that and mock it. To me, I look at that picture and I cherish it because what I see, I see me. See, none of us want to be vulnerable. But what I've learned in life, your vulnerability is really power. It's when we try to be something that we're not &gt;&gt; part when when we're trying to be something that we're not. We're not making ourselves vulnerable. &gt;&gt; But I I I didn't come I did, by God's grace, I did not come this far to play church, &gt;&gt; nor am I going to start. &gt;&gt; I want to be real. And and and to me, the thing of it is is we have to be honest enough with what's inside of us. &gt;&gt; Like if there's something wrong, I want it to come out in the church. I want one of you to speak in tongues and say, "Thus sayeth the Lord," on the fifth row, that big fat man back there &gt;&gt; and rebuke me if you have to &gt;&gt; cuz I want to be right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Like like TO ME, YOU SAID, "OH, NO, THAT'D BE BAD. THAT'D BE ON THE INTERWEB." AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT NO ARCHIVES. &gt;&gt; I want amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I don't want to miss heaven. &gt;&gt; I want to hear say I want to hear well done &gt;&gt; thou good and faithful servant. &gt;&gt; I gave you just a little bit but you was faithful with that little bit I gave you. Right. Right. See, whatever is in us there, there's there there's a story there's a story about a a wise teacher when he was sitting down teaching his students one day and he asked him the question, "If someone bumped into you and spilled your cup of coffee, why did you spill the coffee? And I want you to answer that question in your mind. Why did you spill the coffee? And and the teacher listened to the students response and they said, "Because someone bumped me." And the wise teacher said, "No, because you had coffee in your cup." That is what you were carrying. If you had tea in your cup, that tea would have spilled out. See, whatever was in you, whatever was in that cup was going to spill out. &gt;&gt; And life is the is the same way is WHEN WE GET SHAKEN UP IN LIFE, &gt;&gt; WHATEVER IS INSIDE OF US IS GOING TO SPILL OUT. IF THERE'S IF THERE'S HATE AND ENVY AND ANGER, WHEN YOU GET BUMPED, it's going to come out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; WE WORRY ABOUT THE BUMP. IT'S NOT THE BUMP THAT REALLY MATTERS. &gt;&gt; SEE THE BUMP? THE BUMP. Anybody know what a trigger is? &gt;&gt; See, see, we got triggers in life, &gt;&gt; right, sir? &gt;&gt; And we try so hard in life. We try so hard in life to encapsulate late ourself so nobody touches our trigger &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; see we got we got there's internal triggers emotional distresses losses in control feeling vulnerable There's external triggers of going to certain places and &gt;&gt; you know, oh my, the Thanksgiving season, &gt;&gt; THE HOLIDAY SE THERE'S ENVIRONMENTAL TRIGGERS. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE THERE'S ALL THESE TRIGGERS AROUND US, &gt;&gt; SEE, IT'S NOT THE TRIGGER THAT WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE QUESTION IS IS WHAT IS BEHIND THAT TRIGGER? WHAT IS BEHIND YOUR TRIGGER? &gt;&gt; THEY MAY HAVE PUSHED A BUTTON, BUT WHY DID YOU GO OFF? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE TRIGGER TRIGGERED YOU. YES. BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT. &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT'S BEHIND THE TRIGGER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. If there was no ammunition, &gt;&gt; there would be no explosion. &gt;&gt; See, it's it's it's is it's when we get triggered. It's when we it's when they touch that soft spot, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And when we It's when we have, you know, so many times, no, nobody nobody wants to be vulnerable. And we spend so much of our time protecting ourselves, guarding our emotions, and trying to be oh so pious. And &gt;&gt; but why See, cuz the thing of it is there's some things that are seen and there's some things that's unseen. &gt;&gt; There's some things that's obvious triggers, but there's some things that don't you don't even recognize as triggering you. And we live our lives in such a way because we're trying to protect those triggers in our life. You know, we we we're in the holiday season, and I I don't know about you, but I I have a I have a real struggle during the holidays. &gt;&gt; Because there's so many expectations. &gt;&gt; That's right. I I uh I I I I'll be honest with you. I I struggle with Christmas gifts. Not because of the message theology that's came out. And well, you can't even say Merry Christmas without somebody else communicating. Yeah. But but to me like I don't want to give you a gift unless I can give you a gift. &gt;&gt; From your heart. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Preacher says &gt;&gt; that's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Yeahise. See, I I don't I And and so and so to me, I struggle and I found out that no matter how hard I tried to make a happy home around the holidays, there's an atmosphere in my home of sadness. And I've tried so hard to not pass on the traumas of my childhood, but it it it it hurts me that every year I see those same traumas in a shadow in my children. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, because unconsciously, no matter how hard you try, there's unseen traumas. &gt;&gt; That's right. See, &gt;&gt; there's all that baggage that you carry around &gt;&gt; whether you want to or not &gt;&gt; because we get caught up in the to-do list and you know the the I mean I mean you think about it even so much so that that that the sun doesn't shine and because we we go from the outside to the inside and we don't get that vitamin D that we need. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Some of us are more more uh uh sensitive than others &gt;&gt; and and we we have deaths that happen and regrets and losses and past experiences that happen, financial stress cuz we got a big family and everybody does this and they had this and &gt;&gt; well and they gave me a gift and so I got to get Right? &gt;&gt; And why is that? &gt;&gt; It's insecurity. &gt;&gt; It's insecurity. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because you don't want somebody to do for you cuz you don't feel worthy. &gt;&gt; And because you don't feel worthy, you have to overcompensate and give back. &gt;&gt; And and if you would check, if you would try that, it goes back. Listen, you young brothers, I know I keep preaching to you and I hope you're taking notes. You young brothers that's getting married and gotten b getting babies and listen, you have to be mindful. The most critical time of your child's life is from zero to 8, 10, 12 years old and and that's going to be the time where you're going to check out because you don't think it's important because mom's going to take care of it, your wife. But that is you'll miss the greatest times &gt;&gt; because that's ex Oh my s preach. That's exactly right. You can't get it back. That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; No matter how Listen, I had to talk to my children this morning. And I had to tell him, look, you know, I look, you know, there was a season in my life where I went through about seven years of depression. And it was a very dark time for me. But, you know, from my first two, they they had made it to about to about five, six years old to where they got some some quality time with dad. But my little baby, she was growing up during the darkest hour of my depression. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And so there was there was opp missed opportunities, right? And there's lots of regrets. But see, I don't say this for sermon feel. I say this because it's on my heart to say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But but what I had to do, I had to go back to her and repent. &gt;&gt; And the reason why I did is because 10 years down the road, she may be in a struggle. And that little bit of information I gave her this morning may be the exact thing that she needs to get her through that dark hour. &gt;&gt; But it takes humility to be able to do that. &gt;&gt; You have to admit, I missed the mark. &gt;&gt; I did wrong. &gt;&gt; And I am sorry. &gt;&gt; That means you have to humble yourself. YOU HAVE TO LOOK. WE always talk ABOUT HEADSHIP. WELL, BEAT THE HEAD THEN. &gt;&gt; BEAT THE HEAD THEN. &gt;&gt; You have to be able to humble yourself. &gt;&gt; See, I messed up. &gt;&gt; But I would much rather do that &gt;&gt; and give her the ammunition she's going to need &gt;&gt; because she may have a trigger one day. And because daddy did that when she was 13 years old, it helped her to go through her teenage years &gt;&gt; to realize there there's a there's a void in my life because when I was 6 7 8 years old, dad was checked out in a lot of areas. And because dad wasn't where he was supposed to be, maybe that's why I'm dealing with what I'm dealing with. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE NOT. BUT I WANT TO cover every base &gt;&gt; cuz when I stand before God on that day and I stand before you all, I want to know that I've done everything in my power to be right before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen brothers, look, I I I I tell you because you know we we we want so much for we want approval. It is a very fundamental part of our being as human beings to want approved. &gt;&gt; You brothers, some of you brothers will will will work 60, 70, 80 hours and it's not about the paycheck. What you're really clocking in for is the ghost of approval past. It's why we'll spend our whole lives working and working and grinding and grinding and we miss we miss our time with our families and our children. It's because the ghost of approval passed. There's men that have built kingdoms and at the end of their lives they would look back and say, "I've been looking for my father's approval where I started thinking about this because I had to look at my own life and I realized that I I've spent there's been such a void in my heart because I always wanted my daddy to say I'm proud of you. And sometimes that longing, that's why I say, "Dad, if I I hope you're looking through your rolodex of life and I hope you don't just say, "Yeah, when they did this and they won and they scored, I said, I'm proud of you. Shame on you." &gt;&gt; And I'm saying, yes. Shame on you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, my dad, I don't listen. You you turn a corner. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You do something different &gt;&gt; because your child is longing &gt;&gt; to hear those words. &gt;&gt; I'm proud of you. &gt;&gt; Just for being you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not because you did anything. Not because you got an A. Not because you sang a song special. Not blah blah blah. I'm just proud of you. &gt;&gt; And if we don't say that, we're missing the opportunity to build a character and a confidence and a courage on the inside of her children. &gt;&gt; And you know what? You'll never get it back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because those are foundational building blocks &gt;&gt; that they need. A child needs to feel accepted &gt;&gt; just for being &gt;&gt; them. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, yeah, cuz God accepted you when you was unlovable. &gt;&gt; When you was an enemy of God, &gt;&gt; he he he didn't save you when you was at your best. &gt;&gt; He saved you when you was at your lowest." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible says when we were enemies of God in our mind, &gt;&gt; when when when we were unlovable, &gt;&gt; that's when he said, "Clickup. I'm going to die for them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we don't have Look, look, and you say, "Well, Brother Gabe, my daddy didn't I I know your daddy didn't tell you that, and that's why you struggle with saying it now." &gt;&gt; Right? And you may be sitting there with gray hair and stooped shoulders. I get it. Listen, I'm at 51 years old. I'm not as old, but I still feel it. &gt;&gt; And and we will struggle through life. Look, when brother Chad, remember brother Chad preached, I think it was Wednesday, remember when when when nobody in heaven and earth was worthy. &gt;&gt; Why would God do that? Why would God say at the end OF IT ALL, NOBODY IN HEAVEN AND EARTH WAS WORTHY TO TAKE THE BOOK, &gt;&gt; NOR YOU COULDN'T EVEN LOOK ON THE BOOK? &gt;&gt; GOD WOULD GO TO THE VERY FUNDAMENTAL, &gt;&gt; THE VERY CORE OF HUMAN BEINGS OF LACK AND WANT AND WORTH AND ACCEPTANCE. AND HE WOULD LET EVERY ONE OF US KNOW, &gt;&gt; EVERYONE THAT STRUGGLES WITH THE COMPLEX OF I'M NOT WORTHY. I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE GRINDING AND GRINDING AND LOOKING AT THE BANK ACCOUNT AND LOOKING AT THE CAR AND BLAH BLAH BLAH TRYING TO FILL THE VOID. &gt;&gt; GOD WOULD LOOK AT YOU AND ME &gt;&gt; AND HE WOULD LET US KNOW NO one &gt;&gt; was worthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. because we would have to be reminded &gt;&gt; over and over in the darkest hour. &gt;&gt; Nobody was. &gt;&gt; We We listen. WE TALK ABOUT BROTHER BRANDHAM AND WE PUT HIM ON A PEDESTAL. MAN, HE DIDN'T DRINK OR SMOKE AT THE FOUNTAIN. WOW. OKAY. WELL, what about when them boys beat him to pieces and called him a Kentucky squab? And what did brother Bam do? HE WENT STRAIGHT HOME, GOT HIS 22 RIFLE. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "OH YEAH, COLINE, HERE I COME." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; BEFORE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS WAS POPULAR, BROTHER BRANDON WOULD HAVE BEEN A TRAILBLAZER. OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; HE JUMPED OFF THE HILL AND HE SAID, "WHICH ONE OF YOU WANT TO DIE FIRST?" &gt;&gt; AND HE WASN'T THREATENING. HE WAS NOT BLUFFING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BROTHER B SAID HE USED TO GET SO MAD HE WOULD LAUGH. &gt;&gt; HE SAID HE LAUGHED LIKE AN IDIOT. &gt;&gt; TEMPER, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? So even my prophet &gt;&gt; that God sent me &gt;&gt; wasn't worthy. &gt;&gt; He wasn't worthy. &gt;&gt; No one &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; was worthy. &gt;&gt; And we have to be mindful &gt;&gt; our worthiness. And you know what? We can say it and I I guarantee it'll fall flat because we're like, "Yeah, I know that, brother Gabe." Our worthiness does not matter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to say amen Tuesday afternoon. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz we can say amen in the house of God when we feeling good. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. But it's but it's when we're on the battlefield &gt;&gt; AND EVERYTHING'S FALLING APART &gt;&gt; and and and and your your your your COWORKER PULLS UP IN A 2025 OR THEY GET THE PROMOTION AND YOU DON'T &gt;&gt; RIGHT OR YOU LO YOU SAY, "OH YEAH, BROTHER GAB, WE'RE YEAH WORTHINESS." OKAY, LOSE YOUR JOB MONDAY MORNING. YEAH. &gt;&gt; UH LOSE YOUR JOB AND WHAT HAPPENS? WE AUTOMATICALLY LOSE OUR IDENTITY. &gt;&gt; WE LOSE OUR IDENTITY BECAUSE OF WHAT? OUR WORTH. YEAH, &gt;&gt; because we put our identity and who we are and what we are and our position and I'm under archives. Better get THAT OLD PRIDEFUL SPIRIT OFF OF YOU. &gt;&gt; HUH? SEE, it's when we lose everything. &gt;&gt; It's when we lose everything and it all falls apart. It wasn't the fact that we had to lose. It wasn't that God had to have that happen, but it's because we put too much stock &gt;&gt; in what we are. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we put too much stock in what we know. &gt;&gt; The reason why we ain't a good testimony on a workplace is we're we're too busy uh uh uh downplaying the Baptist because we got more revelation than them &gt;&gt; OR THE PENTECOSTAL CUZ WE GOT THE PROPHET. OH, come &gt;&gt; I might have TO SQUEEZE THE AMEN OUT SOME. YOU NEED TO BE MIGHT WELL BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; YOU WE ALL DONE SAT IN THE SEAT OF THE STORM, FOLK. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; DON'T &gt;&gt; Y'ALL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; HEY, IF YOU HAVE IT, YOU MAY BE SITTING IN IT RIGHT NOW. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHY? Cuz we want approval. &gt;&gt; We want to be the best. &gt;&gt; Because it's the society &gt;&gt; that we live in. Whoever comes up last in the race does not get a prize. &gt;&gt; Well, lady will see it now. It's, you know, participation trophy. &gt;&gt; But but y'all know that's true. But but but it but but whoever wins, THEY GET THE BIGGEST PRIZE AND THE BIGGEST TROPHY AND THEY GET THE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL and &gt;&gt; right is this okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. We we live in this society, this the season that we live in, you know, we deal with the holiday blues of isolation, lost loved ones, and and we get so sometimes we we ain't mindful of the quality times. And you know, sometimes we get so busy. You just you pray for me cuz I I I don't want to go. I'm already almost an hour. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; So So I I I want to ask you a question. If you found out that your child was bullied and they suffered and didn't talk to you, how would you explain it? And if in your mind you said, "Well, I would feel horrible." That's not what I asked you. If your child was bullied and they suffered and they didn't talk to you, how would you explain that? See, because the trauma didn't start at being bullied. The trauma started is because they didn't feel safe enough to open enough &gt;&gt; to come to you and talk to you about it. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Please don't let that go over your head. &gt;&gt; And don't don't ignore that cuz that's not a quote. &gt;&gt; Cuz the trauma started before they were bullied. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's because they didn't feel safe enough &gt;&gt; at home. &gt;&gt; They didn't feel open enough at home. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To talk to you about it. It's because they didn't feel accepted. They didn't feel worthy. There wasn't that open line of communication. See, when brother Brenham says make a home a happy home, &gt;&gt; it's making it an unconditional home &gt;&gt; that I'm going to love you whether you serve God or not. That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to love you if you become the worst person in the world. &gt;&gt; Daddy will still be there. &gt;&gt; But if we're worried about how we'll look, we'll miss the opportunity to create an open channel. Do y'all believe that? See, when the Lord Jesus before he goes to the Gethsemane and his prayer to the father in St. John chapter 17, not only did He says, "These words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, 'Father, the hour is come. Glorify thy son that thy son may also glorify thee." &gt;&gt; What was it? He wanted to make father proud. Even the Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; he wasn't just worried about the son being glorified, but he said that the son also may glorify thee. &gt;&gt; In other words, that I could that I would be accepted that there was a mutual thing he wanted. It wasn't just that he would be glorified, but the son would be glorified in him. That's right. &gt;&gt; See, when the Lord Jesus was on earth, he was very particular about even in the Old Testament in Exodus 22, he says, "Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child. If thou afflict them in any wise," watch what? Watch how God was so protective of a child that didn't have a father's protection. &gt;&gt; Not just not just a child, but a widow. &gt;&gt; He would say, "Thou shalt not afflict any widow or fatherless child. If thou afflict them in any wise, and they shall cry out unto me, look, cry at all." Even &gt;&gt; God is so particular. He says, "If they say the least little thing, &gt;&gt; he says, I will surely hear their cry &gt;&gt; AND MY WRATH &gt;&gt; SHALL WAX HOT &gt;&gt; AND I WILL KILL YOU WITH THE SWORD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD'S TALKING TO HIS ELECT RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS, "IF YOU DO, IF YOU TOUCH A HAIR ON THEIR HEAD, &gt;&gt; MY WRATH &gt;&gt; IS COMING DOWN." &gt;&gt; He says, "AND YOUR WIVES SHALL BE widows &gt;&gt; and your children fatherless. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET ME see you lay hands." &gt;&gt; All right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Bec- because God listen, God knows that if there's a child that don't have a daddy, &gt;&gt; there's going to be lacking in that child. &gt;&gt; That it's not that child's fault. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND GOD REALIZES THAT. AND SO GOD TELLS HIS PEOPLE, "THOSE PEOPLE GET EXTRA SPECIAL CARE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD KNOWS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE VOIDS IN THOSE PEOPLE'S lives &gt;&gt; that's not their fault." Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; Look, he says this even in the New Testament. He says pure religion and undefiled before God is the father is this to visit the fatherless and the widows and their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world. That visit is just not go see him every once in a while, but it actually means to look after &gt;&gt; to to look upon in order to help or benefit, to look after, to care for, provide for. So God is telling us that if there if there's a child that's lacking fatherhood &gt;&gt; and the dad is not there, we as the people of God &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; are called to fill that void. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because there's things that's going to be in that child that they're going to deal with that your children won't deal with. Right. &gt;&gt; When the widows when they don't have their husband, that means, you know, it it's not just so much, but it really, if you think about it, they're not going to have that headship in the home. &gt;&gt; They're not going to have that shoulder to lean upon &gt;&gt; there. You know, you know, look, I I'm going to say I look, do you know I hope you understand when I say it like this. Do you know cuddling is super important? &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not talking about you brothers cut. You understand what I'm saying? But I'm trying to show you that we need as human beings, we need physical contact. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. And you sisters, I should have hold a a whole lot more estrogen than that. Just a couple of you. I ought to see some elbows. Like cuddles release good feel-good hormones like oxytocin and serotonin, which reduces stress and anxiety while boosting mood and sleep quality. calms the nervous system, decreases cortisol to stress homing and promotes feelings of safety and security. It can also improve immune function, lower blood pressure and heart rate. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Gabe. Blink three times for amen. It's okay. We'll get the deacons to defend you. Come on, sis. You Right. Cuz listen, I'm saying this for you young brothers, too. You said, "Bro, I'm a man." All right. Well, be a man and hug your wife. &gt;&gt; Listen, cuz we need it. And so when God's saying, "Visit the widow and the fatherless." Why? Cuz he needs your hands. Amen. &gt;&gt; He don't need your money. &gt;&gt; He don't need you to put an extra 20 in in the in the offering basket. What he needs is your feet. What he needs is your heart. What he needs is your hands. So that you sisters put your arm around that widow. &gt;&gt; Be mindful. Listen, widows need physical touch. That's my mama right there. Right. Right. That's right. Yes. They look the fatherless child, they need to feel that arm go. Look, you brothers, they need to feel that. They need to know that somebody &gt;&gt; cares for them. Because whose hands is he going to have to use but your hands? &gt;&gt; Whose heart is he going to have to feel through? Lest it be your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we we we we go through emotions and sometimes we may not necessarily know why we feel the way that we do and why that we act the way that we act. But you know, this is what I love when when you deal with a situation. I love this picture because a lot of times when we have a situation in life, we'll look at just this little itty bitty confrontation or right interaction between you and somebody else. But I want you to understand, you may be you may be able to have scripture and verse why they're wrong. And God will wink at that situation and you'll be condemning God because he winked at that situation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And what you failed to see, God sees &gt;&gt; what we cannot. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, God sees a panoramic. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And too many times we have tunnel vision because we got the quote, we got the scripture and lock, stock, and bear it. They're done, finished, blah, blah, blah. And we're dead wrong &gt;&gt; because God is able. He understands. He's able to see the intricacies. He's able to see the family strains. He's able to see the birth order. He's able to see the name was Elvis and it shouldn't be. &gt;&gt; Elvis, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS RAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YEAH. BROTHER BANNER SAID UH UH I if if YOUR IF YOUR CHILD IS NAMED RICKY, HE SAYS FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES, CHANGE HIS NAME. &gt;&gt; He said IF YOU IF YOU CHANGE HIS NAME, WATCH HIS NATURE CHANGE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I you know when I some when somebody at work or somebody tells me, "Oh yeah, we we had a baby blah." I said, "What'd you name it?" And they'll tell me and I always always say, "What does that mean?" And I would say 95% of the time, maybe 100%. They'll say, "I don't know." &gt;&gt; What? Because the name has meaning to it, &gt;&gt; right? And so the thing of it is is is you got to understand when we deal with a situation, there is a whole bunch of variables in the background. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. like on a computer system, all this stuff running in the background that you don't see. You're looking at the screen, but you don't see what's going on in the background. &gt;&gt; But God does, THANKFULLY. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE GOD UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND, HE CAN WORK EVERYTHING OUT FOR HIS GLORY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. is Lord. &gt;&gt; See, he says this in in Psalms 139:1. OH LORD, THOU HAS SEARCHED ME AND KNOWN ME. THOU KNOWEST MY DOWN SITTING AND MINE UPRISES. THOU UNDERSTANDEST MY THOUGHT. That's purpose or aim. &gt;&gt; THOU UNDERSTANDEST MY PURPOSE. MY THOUGHT, MY aim are FAR OFF. THOU COMPASSES MY PATH AND MY LYING DOWN AND acquainted with all of MY WAYS. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, IF GOD CALLED YOU, HE KNEW you was going to be in the mess that you're in today. &gt;&gt; But he already KNEW WHEN HE CALLED YOU, YOU WAS GOING TO BE IN THIS MESS THAT you're in right now. &gt;&gt; AND YOU FEEL THERE'S NO WAY. THERE'S COULDN'T HAVE BEEN, SHOULD HAVE BEEN, COULDN'T HAVE HAD BEEN. But the Bible says that he knoweth &gt;&gt; he knoweth that we are but dust. You know when you look at a man behind every man who fights to give everything to his children is a boy who wishes someone fought as hard for him. But if you didn't go through what you went through, do you hear what I said? You went through. &gt;&gt; It didn't stop you. &gt;&gt; You went through it. What you went through, you went through. But if you didn't go through it, you wouldn't have the love in your heart that you have. That's right. &gt;&gt; And you wouldn't give the way that you give &gt;&gt; because we have to go through the schools of suffering &gt;&gt; to know how the other fella feels. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going to try to close if that's okay. You know, too many times in life, we look at the situation and brother Brandham says, "In the beginning, God has created you to be the master of every circumstance." That's the origin. That's authentic. That's God's word. There was nothing nothing could happen unless you was the master of it. That's what you were created for. So, so what we need to realize is God's not playing checkers. &gt;&gt; God's playing three-dimensional chess. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And too many time we have a checkerboard mentality &gt;&gt; and we don't realize the span that God is dealing in. And he don't real you don't realize the pieces that he's moving &gt;&gt; to make your purpose come to pass in your life. &gt;&gt; See when we too many times when we talk about sin you know sin what does sin mean? Sin means to miss the path &gt;&gt; to miss the goal to miss the mark. And when we talk about sin, we look at something outwardly that we're doing or somebody's doing. But really, sin is unbelief. &gt;&gt; And if we're not believing God's word, that is sin. &gt;&gt; And look, here's the thing. You fill in the blank. cuz only you know. &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about a checklist of, you know, long hair, no makeup. I don't, you know, I don't have no Facebook. I don't watch movies. I don't It's not what I'm talking about, right? &gt;&gt; It's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about sin. Because we can because we're looking for approval. We can just do the checklist of approval like we're earning God's approval by the things we're not doing. Is it really about that? No. But how many years did we spend trying to earn God's approval by the things we stop doing? &gt;&gt; How many times did we kick out the television? I used to keep a receipt. I'd keep the receipt. You &gt;&gt; True story. Hey, I KICK OUT THE TELEVISION just to bring it back in. how carnal it was. No doubt God had to look down from heaven just like bless his heart. Right. But you know it wasn't God. It was the fact because I've always wanted the approval. I spent so many years trying to find and earn the approval, the approval of my mom, the approval of my dad, the approval of others. And we can get so caught up that we miss. He's the one that made you worthy. That's it. Is that the truth? &gt;&gt; And if we would, you know, if you think about it, &gt;&gt; what does justification mean? When God justifies you, he says you never done it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Okay. Think about what God does. He tells you that before he even cleans you up through sanctification, &gt;&gt; right? and then even to the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So at the very fundamental purpose when God picks you up out of the hog pin and you're filthy and undone, he wants you to understand, listen, before we go any further. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're like, "Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't worry. No, don't worry about the tele." No, no. Before we go any further, listen. I want you to God, he wants you to understand this. &gt;&gt; You've never done it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. what I'm doing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Stop. Stop. Don't worry about this. This right here, &gt;&gt; God wants you. Cuz the moment that you go, I never done it in the first place. No, no, no. That goes all back on Satan. It does. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he wants you to understand, be at rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he realizes there's going to be a lot of children that come through the eons of time. &gt;&gt; That didn't have the approval of their earthly father. And because they didn't have listen you brothers that pour in the love and I'm proud of you and you can do it and you don't understand what you're doing for your children to help them to be cou courageous courageous and but you if you haven't done that you don't know the detriment that you're putting them under and you'll never hear them say it. You know, I you will never hear me. You will never hear me come to my daddy. I hope he never hears this. You'll please if you know him, please don't get send this out. You You'll never hear me come to dad and say, "Dad, I want you to tell me you're proud of me. &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm 51 years old and for 51 years I've longed to hear those words. &gt;&gt; But you will never hear me. Ask him that. &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz the pain goes too deep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to ask him. I want him to tell me. And I say this not for Larry Joe, but I say this for your children &gt;&gt; because there's still hope for you. But you know it's going to take you humbling yourself like I did to that little girl this morning. And you're going to have to set them down. You have to have some pride and go, you know what? God had to rake me over the coals this morning. And I'm guilty. I don't tell you I'm proud of you like I should. And it's going to take humility. I may be talking to one brother, but that one brother is enough for me to say this. &gt;&gt; I don't care how you was raised. That does not matter. It we don't just keep passing it down. &gt;&gt; But at some point in time, it has to stop &gt;&gt; and you have to say it's going to stop in my home. &gt;&gt; Today's the day I'm going to have to eat some humble pie &gt;&gt; and I'm going to have to say, "Oh man, is it easy?" No. If it was, every daddy would do it. &gt;&gt; But if you're a real dad, &gt;&gt; not just the father, &gt;&gt; but if you're a real dad, you'll repent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you'll say, "I'm sorry." &gt;&gt; You know, it's it's it's it's two simple words, but they're so hard to say. But when you say it, it brings release. &gt;&gt; When you say it, it brings healing. &gt;&gt; When you say it, it opens up the door. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When you say it, it makes them feel safe. When you say it, it makes them feel welcome. When you say it, it makes them feel at home. &gt;&gt; Can we stand together? I I know this was a little different this morning and uh I hope that uh it uh gives you food for thought this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. is the musicians they come. You know in St. John 14 the Lord Jesus says I will not leave you fatherless. That's comfortless. He said, 'I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more, but you'll see me because I live, ye shall live also at that day. And brother Brandham takes this scripture and says this day, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; At that day, ye shall know that I am in my father, ye in me, and I in you. &gt;&gt; And so God's mindful of the fatherless. &gt;&gt; If you just play something soft, sis, &gt;&gt; I don't know where everybody's at. Maybe maybe this is just for one person. I I don't know. But I I I hope that you do some soularching and you may be one of the top five dads in the world. Praise the Lord. I'm striving with you. But there's always areas in our life where we can improve. &gt;&gt; There was only one. And listen, and I say this, Dad, let me let me not just I hope this ain't condemning dads and making you feel bad. That's not my intention. Because listen, if you was a perfect father, they wouldn't need the heavenly one, &gt;&gt; right? And so we're all God's not going to share his glory with no man. &gt;&gt; And we all have shortcomings and we all have baggage and we all have things that we're unconsciously doing and we're all things that we've left undone and we we don't want to address and we don't want to look at and we kick the can down the road. And all of us in some shape or form have fallen short. That's right. And I I'm not here to condemn you, but my heart is to see the heartache of children be healed. I know the wounds that I carry in my own heart, but I don't want to see them go to another generation. &gt;&gt; I I want them to stop with me. And I'm sure that that's your heart's cry, too. &gt;&gt; We as daddies, we make mistakes and we do things wrong and we get things wrong. But God made a way for us to repent. And I look out in the congregation and see these young brothers and little babies. And I tell you, I I've been uh been sitting in my chair and and uh I'm only 51 years old, but sometimes I feel like I'm 80. And I look and it's like, you know, a couple days ago the girls was out in the out gone and it was just Susan in the home and and my girls are quiet. They're real quiet even at home while sometimes. But But when they're home, I can just feel that they're home and I know they're home. Even though I don't hear them, I just know it. And and the house just felt different. And I thought, man, one day they're going to be gone and they're going to be going to their own homes and they're going to dad's going to be knocking on the door and they be like, "Sh, look away." I'm like, "Woohoo! I see your car in the garage." And you know, they they they grow up fast. And I I see you young brothers and you got them babies in your arms. Hold them tight. and love all of them with all you got. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's a real small window. And when that window closes, you'll realize all the missed opportunities. And I just pray that you listen to what brother Gabe's trying to tell you cuz I speak from experience. But you're the the new generation and you're the daddies that can be super daddies. And if you don't get anything from anything that I've said this morning outside of make sure you tell your children you're proud of them &gt;&gt; because that prodal son was a grown man and even though his daddy ran after him, he still saw himself as a servant. You know, I wonder how many sleepless nights that daddy had, the regrets that daddy had. How many times did he look back and go, "Man, I should have done that. I should have done this." No wonder he ran after him. No wonder. And when that prodical son said, "I'm I'm no I sin against heaven and earth and I'm I'm I'm I'm not worthy. Just let me be a son." He never even acknowledged what his son said. He didn't even acknowledge it. He just put a robe on him and a ring on him and changed the atmosphere. And he said, "Let's rejoice and be merry cuz my son which was lost is now found." &gt;&gt; You know, he found another opportunity to rekindle the relationship that was lost. And I would encourage every one of us, the lost relationships that we have, maybe we ought to rekindle them. I'm sure there's some souls that we need to run after, too. Cuz God needs our feet. He needs our heart. And there's souls out there that's longing just for the approval of someone else. Let's bow our heads. And as we bow, maybe you slip a hand up, ask the Lord to be your helper. I listen this and that. I I I stand in the same place as you do and I I hope I delivered this thought in a balanced way. Ask your forgiveness if I didn't. But I'm speaking to you as a dad, but I'm also speaking to you as a son. And I know, and you know what, Dad? If you would look in your heart, I know you see what I'm talking about, cuz you're a son, too. But you and I as daddies and sons, we can bow our heads to a heavenly father. and we can ask him that he'd move on our behalf. Let's pray together. Precious Lord, it's a solemn moment in our life and words fall short to express the feelings of our heart. We're truly a needy people. And we're so thankful that where sin did abound, grace did that much more abound. And so we're bowing our hearts to you, Lord, and asking for grace, asking for a heavenly touch in our lives, in our homes, on our families, our loved ones. Lord, we see the frailty of our beings, the inadequacies of our lives, and but Lord, I I'm grateful that you called us just the same. And Lord, we truly want to hear one day well done. And uh I pray for my brothers, my sisters, those in that holiday season of blues and the heartaches that the holidays bring, the regrets and missed opportunities, Lord, are so many. But through it all, Lord, we want to take it in stride, search our lives and overturn every stone and every pebble. Lord, we want to stand before your whole one day. Not a spot on the garment. And we're needing, Lord, with so many voices in this world, we're needing a finely tuned ear to be able to hear your word and see our thought, our aim, our purpose. That's for us. Realizing that we are but dust. We're bowing our heads from to the dust from which we've came and asking that you would pour out yourself upon us, Lord, in the refreshing of your Holy Spirit. If we've become cold and indifferent and distant in our homes, if the ghost of approval past is still haunting us, Lord, I pray that today would be the day that the those ghosts are silenced. Lord, those that are in need, pray and in agree and prayer touching this one thing, asking that you would move it. Lord, we just want to grow in a deeper relationship with you and our brothers and sisters, our families. Lord, we want to be your hands. We want to be your feet. We want to be your eyes. And we truly want to be your heart. And I pray that Lord as we are living in Satan's Eden and the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind and you see the invisible wars that are raging in each soul, each being Lord that's here in this assembly. And I pray that your great Holy Spirit would be the ammunition that they need to fight against the ws of the enemy. We commit ourselves into your hands. I commit them to you and ask Lord for leadership, direction, and guidance as only you can. And we'll be careful to give you all praise and glory. We ask these things to be so in the name that's above every name, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. All hearts are free. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's sing this. What's that song you singing there? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Go ahead, brother. &gt;&gt; I have a father. &gt;&gt; Ain't you happy for that? He calls me his own. He'll never leave me. No matter where I go. And he knows my name. He knows my one prayer, every thought. He sees each fear that falls and he hears thee when I call. Oh, I have a maker. Before my heart, before even time beame, my life was in his hand. And he knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each year that calls and he hears me when I call. Oh, I have a father. He calls me his own. He'll never leave me. No matter where I go, he knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each call and he hears me when I go. And oh, I know the time is near where everything that I hold dear will lay before the holy consuming fire. All my works and all my deeds, every prayer set on my knees lay before the holy consuming fire. And all I want to see is Jesus. All I want to see is him in me. All I want to see is Jesus shineing through me. Oh, and selfinflicted pain. Everything that I thought gain will lay before the holy suming fire. Words of knowledge in his name. Healing hands that touch the lame will lay before the holy suming fire. And all I want to see is Jesus. All I want to see is him in me. And all I want to see is Jesus shineing through me. And hear him say, "Well done." My praise shine. Well done. Well done, my faithful one. And all I want to see is Jesus. All I want to see is him in me. And all I want to see is Jesus shineing through me in shady green pastures so rich and so sweet. God leads his dear children along. Where the waterers flow bays the weery ones see. God leads his dear children alone. Some through the waterers, some through the blood, some through the fire, but all through the blood. Some through great sorrow, but God gives a song in the night season and all the day long. Sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright, God leads his dear children along. Sometimes in the valley, the darkest of night, God leaves his dear children alone. Oh, some through the waters, some through the flood. Some through the fire, but all through the blood. Some through great sorrow, but God gives a song in the night season and all the day long. Those sorrows befall us and Satan oppose. God leads his dear children along. Through grace we can coner, defeat all our foes. God leads his dear children along. Oh, some through the water, some through the blood. Some through the fire, but all through the blood. Some through great sorrow. But God gives a song in the night season and all the day long. Away from the mire, away from the clay. God leads his dear children along away up in glory. Eternity day God leads his dear children alone. Oh, some through the waters, some through the flood, some through the fire, but all through the blood. Some through great sorrow. But God gives a song in the night season and all the day long.
