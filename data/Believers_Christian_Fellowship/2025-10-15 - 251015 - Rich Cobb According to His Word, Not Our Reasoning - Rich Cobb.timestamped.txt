[0:00] Oh, I'm waiting for the chariot
[0:06] to swing low and I'll step in
[0:11] on the cloud. I'll rise to heaven.
[0:16] When the saints go maring in.
[0:21] Oh, when the saints
[0:23] go marching in.
[0:26] Oh, when the saints go marching in.
[0:31] Oh Lord, I want to be in that number.
[0:37] When the saints go maring in,
[0:42] when they crown
[0:44] him king of kings.
[0:47] Oh, when they crown him king of kings.
[0:52] Oh Lord, I want to be in that number
[0:57] when they crown him king of kings.
[1:02] Oh, when they crown
[1:05] him Lord of all.
[1:07] Oh, when they crown him Lord of all.
[1:13] Lord, I want to be in that number.
[1:18] Oh, and they crown him. Lord of all.
[1:23] Oh, when the saints
[1:25] go marching in.
[1:28] Oh, when the saints go maring in.
[1:33] Oh Lord, I want to be in that number.
[1:38] When the saints go marching in,
[1:44] we're a band of Christian soldiers
[1:46] fighting Satan every day. We're standing
[1:50] up for Jesus while we're kneeling down
[1:53] to pray. If his precious blood has
[1:56] cleans you and wash your sins away
[2:01] that makes you a member of the blood
[2:04] washing.
[2:07] Praise God. I'm a member of the blood
[2:11] washed band. I've been washed in the
[2:14] soul cleansing blood of the lamb.
[2:18] I was bound by chains of sin till one
[2:21] day the master gave
[2:25] and made me a member of the blood wash.
[2:31] God's children are advancing, marching
[2:34] till we reach the gold. For the battle's
[2:37] almost over, and we'll soon be going
[2:40] home. I can hear the sound of angels as
[2:44] the saints go marching in.
[2:47] Singing praises to the captain of that
[2:50] blood wash band.
[2:54] Praise God. I'm a member of the blood
[2:57] wash band. I've been washed in the soul
[3:01] cleansing blood of the lamb.
[3:05] I was bound by Jesus till one day the
[3:09] master came
[3:11] and made me a member of the blood wash.
[3:17] Oh, praise God. I'm a member of the
[3:21] blood wash. I've been washed in the
[3:24] blood cleansing blood of the lamb.
[3:29] I was bound by Jesus till one day the
[3:32] master came
[3:35] and made me a member of the blood washed
[3:39] man.
[3:41] Oh, greater than all my sin, his love
[3:48] that still cleanses
[3:52] me. The grace that still sets
[3:57] me free
[4:01] to praise him.
[4:03] [Applause]
[4:05] I know that the blood
[4:08] of the light. I'm walking in newness
[4:15] of life.
[4:17] I cannot fall for it's greater than all
[4:22] the blood of the lamb. As brother Chad
[4:26] comes with the prayer request, sing that
[4:27] again. Greater than all my sin is the
[4:34] blood that still cleanses
[4:39] me. The grace that still sets
[4:43] me free
[4:47] to praise him.
[4:50] [Music]
[4:52] I know the blood
[4:55] of life. I'm walking in newness
[5:01] of life and I cannot fall for it's
[5:06] greater than all the blood of the lamb.
[5:13] Amen. God bless you all. We're going to
[5:15] let you have your seats for just a
[5:17] minute. Hey, it's good to be home.
[5:20] And if you once you hear about my
[5:22] journey, you'll know I'm happy to be
[5:24] home. Amen. We've had a little bit of a
[5:26] detour and roundabout way to get here,
[5:28] but we're here.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, it's good to see you
[5:31] all. Just want to say how much we
[5:32] appreciate you all praying for each one
[5:34] of us. Praying for David and I. Each one
[5:36] of you praying for us. We had a
[5:37] wonderful time. Good meetings. And so,
[5:40] we really appreciate that. Uh I've uh
[5:43] asked Brother Rich Cobb to take the
[5:45] service this evening for us. Originally,
[5:47] I wasn't going to. I caught wind that he
[5:49] was coming in town, but I thought, I'm
[5:50] just going to let brother Rich visit his
[5:52] family. He doesn't We don't have to tap
[5:54] on him every time he comes. Well, we
[5:56] tapped on him. Amen.
[5:59] So, so much for letting him off the hook
[6:01] and visit his family. But I was so
[6:03] thankful he was available. Amen. Uh some
[6:06] of you might have heard, but on the way
[6:08] out, we had a plane that broke down.
[6:10] Some mechanical failure on the plane and
[6:13] it couldn't fly and got delayed and
[6:15] delayed and delayed and we finally had
[6:16] to reroute. And I was supposed to fly in
[6:19] that night and minister there for
[6:21] brother Ed Hammermeister and we missed
[6:22] that and so he had to take his own
[6:25] service and and so uh we missed that but
[6:28] by the grace of God we made it there.
[6:30] Then we had wonderful time good
[6:32] services. We had uh uh four services
[6:35] there. They had a Friday night, a
[6:36] Saturday night, a Sunday morning and
[6:38] then uh Saturday morning men's
[6:40] breakfast. I've got some pictures. Could
[6:41] you pull that up, brother Sam? Here's a
[6:44] picture one of the brothers sent me from
[6:45] the back of Brother Eugene's church.
[6:46] This is probably an angle you've never
[6:48] seen before, but this is their church.
[6:50] It was full. They had some visitors
[6:52] there. Apparently, there was two
[6:53] weddings in town, two different weddings
[6:55] in town of the amongst the believers, so
[6:57] a lot of people were visiting, which
[6:58] made it nice. And then Saturday morning,
[7:01] we had a men's fellowship breakfast. And
[7:03] so, we spoke at that. And brother Eugene
[7:04] always has several brothers speak at
[7:06] that. And it's really a good time. I've
[7:08] been there several times and I really
[7:10] very much enjoy each time I get to go.
[7:14] And then I bumped into some of our
[7:15] friends there from India. These are some
[7:18] brothers from brother Rashan's church.
[7:20] On the far left, your far left is
[7:22] brother Enoch. This is brother Rashan's
[7:24] son. He's a student finishing up his
[7:26] studies in Vancouver. And these two
[7:29] other brothers on either side of me, uh,
[7:31] the one next to Enoch would be Brother
[7:33] Gurgen. And the one on the other side of
[7:35] me is Brother Pew. They're both
[7:36] missionaries that work out of brother
[7:38] Roshan's church and go out and spread
[7:40] the message, spread the gospel to all
[7:42] the outlying areas. And so we know them
[7:44] really well. We've visited with them,
[7:46] spent a lot of time with them when we
[7:47] were in India. And so it was great to
[7:49] bump into them again there at those
[7:52] meetings. So that was an extra bonus for
[7:56] us. So just wanted to say thank you once
[7:59] again for the prayers and it's always so
[8:01] good to go visit with the assembly up
[8:03] there. We've been there a few times and
[8:04] so there's such a familiar familiarness
[8:07] for me and them and we get along well
[8:09] and I always gain something every time I
[8:11] go is what I told them and I always gain
[8:13] something with my fellowship with
[8:15] brother Eugene. He's got such
[8:16] perspective and insight and I feel like
[8:18] I grow just in the fellowship. So it's
[8:20] always been beneficial.
[8:23] And brother David had a good time. My
[8:25] son David, he had a great time. He met
[8:27] some friends there. Some of their young
[8:29] people got to spend some time together.
[8:30] So his his overseas trip was
[8:32] magnificent.
[8:34] He actually had to go through customs. I
[8:36] mean it was out of this world. But we
[8:39] had a good time. But uh on the way back
[8:43] then we had the same thing. The plane
[8:46] broke down. Some I don't know what it is
[8:49] with us and breaking planes but they
[8:51] they couldn't fly them. This on the way
[8:53] back they actually had us on the plane
[8:54] went through deicing got to the runway
[8:57] and then they took us back. And so that
[8:59] created some problems and then delay
[9:01] after delay after delay. And then it
[9:03] delayed so far I knew I wasn't going to
[9:05] make my flight from Minneapolis home
[9:06] last night. And when I knew I couldn't
[9:08] get home, I looked at alternatives and I
[9:10] didn't even know if we'd be home for
[9:12] tonight. So that's when I called brother
[9:13] Rich and said, "Brother Rich," and he
[9:16] was so gracious to say, "Yeah, no
[9:17] problem, brother Chad." I don't know if
[9:18] he felt like no problem, but he told me
[9:20] no problem. And so I really appreciate
[9:22] that. And I know he had a busy weekend
[9:24] and he was up in Lraine ministering on
[9:26] Sunday uh for brother Nathaniel Saias.
[9:28] But I just felt like it worked out when
[9:30] when it didn't work out for me. I felt
[9:32] like God was working something out, you
[9:34] know, and so I just relaxed and asked
[9:37] him and he was gracious to do that and I
[9:40] appreciate him doing that. So it's good
[9:41] to have him and his family here. Say God
[9:43] bless you all and look forward to
[9:45] hearing what God has for us.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; Because I had full intentions of
[9:48] preaching tonight, but God obviously had
[9:50] something else in mind. So, I'm excited
[9:52] to see what else God had in mind. Amen.
[9:54] So, I have a high expectation.
[9:57] Also want to say it's been good to have
[9:59] the Abbott family here. God bless you
[10:00] all. You guys are leaving tomorrow,
[10:01] right? Yeah. So, it's been good to have
[10:04] you. May God bless you as you go and
[10:05] thank you uh for the service on
[10:07] Wednesday. I enjoyed it with all the
[10:09] delays. I had time to watch the
[10:10] services, the service from Wednesday and
[10:12] brother gave service from Sunday and I
[10:14] enjoyed them all. I was even I had my
[10:16] little headphones in. And I was walking
[10:17] around the airport and I I I blurted out
[10:20] a few amens a couple times and got a few
[10:22] looks. You know, people are used to
[10:24] people walking around with headphones in
[10:25] their ears and they're used to them
[10:27] reacting, but they're not used to
[10:28] hearing amen.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; So, so we got got a little bit of a
[10:33] surprise look a time or two, but hey,
[10:35] sometimes you just can't help it. Amen.
[10:37] The amen comes from deep inside. So,
[10:39] thank you, brother Gabe, as well. We
[10:41] appreciate that. God is good, friends.
[10:44] And uh it's good to be home.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; Good to be home. We uh got stranded in
[10:50] Minneapolis. Had to spend the night
[10:51] there. Slept about 3 hours. Got up early
[10:54] this morning to come here. So I told my
[10:56] wife, I'm going to sit beside you and
[10:57] just pinch me if I
[11:01] my head slumps, you know. And so then
[11:03] I'll wake up and go, why are you
[11:04] pinching me? And you guys will you guys
[11:06] will all know what happened because
[11:08] that's what some of our children used to
[11:10] do to us. Amen.
[11:12] So, so God be praised. So, yeah, very
[11:16] happy to be here. Also,
[11:19] uh very happy to have brother Sam and
[11:23] Sister Emily Bartram. They're not
[11:25] sitting together, but but the newest
[11:28] Bartram couple. Amen. They're happy to
[11:30] have them back. And I know they were
[11:31] here Sunday, but I didn't have a chance
[11:33] to welcome him back myself. So, it's
[11:35] good to have them back. So, God bless
[11:37] them. Let's all stand together. I got
[11:40] one prayer request I'd like to read and
[11:43] then we'll pray. And and I don't know
[11:45] about you, but I do have an expectation.
[11:47] It's always good to be back home, back
[11:49] in the home church, back with the
[11:50] saints. And after God orchestrated
[11:53] everything that's been orchestrated, I
[11:54] don't believe anything happens without
[11:56] God knowing about it, without it serving
[11:59] God's purpose. So, I'm very excited to
[12:01] be in the service this evening.
[12:03] [Music]
[12:19] Lord,
[12:20] the mountain is steep.
[12:24] Still out my higher.
[12:28] With you next to me, I'll press on.
[12:34] Lord,
[12:35] the trials seem harder,
[12:39] but I know you, Father,
[12:42] and you'll never hear my side.
[12:48] The higher the mountain,
[12:51] the fairer the view,
[12:55] the higher the trial,
[12:58] the more I trust in you,
[13:02] the weaker I become,
[13:06] the more in you I'm strong.
[13:11] I know if I abide in you,
[13:16] you'll ever abide in me.
[13:20] [Music]
[13:25] Lord,
[13:27] my strength is failing
[13:30] and I am now praying
[13:34] that you would please show me your way.
[13:39] Lord, you're the answer. I see.
[13:44] Provision be mine.
[13:48] I ask for more faith to believe.
[13:53] The higher the mountain,
[13:57] the fairer the view,
[14:00] the higher the trial,
[14:04] the more I trust in you,
[14:07] the weaker I become,
[14:10] the more in you I'm strong.
[14:16] I know if I abide in you,
[14:21] you'll ever abide in me.
[14:25] [Music]
[14:30] Lord,
[14:31] I worship your name.
[14:35] I know I am loving
[14:38] but I give myself unto you
[14:44] Lord
[14:45] if I just let go
[14:49] and you have control.
[14:52] I know that I
[14:55] overcome.
[14:58] The higher the mountain,
[15:01] the fairer the view,
[15:04] the harder the trial,
[15:08] the more I trust in you,
[15:11] the weaker I become,
[15:15] the more in you I'm strong.
[15:20] And I know if I abide in you,
[15:25] you'll ever abide in me.
[15:29] [Music]
[15:34] The higher the mountain,
[15:37] the fairer the view,
[15:40] the harder the trial,
[15:44] the more I trust in you,
[15:47] the weaker I become,
[15:51] the more in you I'm strong.
[15:56] And I know if I abide in you,
[16:01] you'll ever abide in me.
[16:05] Sing verse one with us.
[16:08] [Music]
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[16:11] the mountain is steep,
[16:15] but still I'll climb higher.
[16:18] With you next to me, I press on.
[16:23] Lord, the trials seem harder,
[16:28] but I know you, Father,
[16:32] that you'll never hear my side.
[16:37] The higher the mountain,
[16:40] the fairer the view,
[16:44] the harder the trial,
[16:47] the more I trust in you,
[16:50] the weaker I become,
[16:54] the more in you I'm strong.
[16:59] And I know if I abide in you,
[17:04] you'll ever abide in me still.
[17:09] Lord, my strength is near failing
[17:14] and I am now praying
[17:21] your way.
[17:23] Oh, your answer I see.
[17:28] Your vision be mine.
[17:31] I ask for more faith to believe.
[17:36] The higher the mountain,
[17:40] the fairer the view,
[17:43] the harder the trial,
[17:46] the more I trust in you,
[17:50] the weaker I become.
[17:53] The more in you I'm strong
[17:56] [Music]
[17:58] and I know if I abide in you,
[18:03] you'll ever abide in me. Verse three,
[18:09] Lord, I worship your name.
[18:14] I know I am nothing,
[18:17] but I give myself unto you.
[18:22] Lord,
[18:24] if I just let go
[18:27] and you have control,
[18:30] I know that I
[18:33] overcome.
[18:35] The higher the mountain,
[18:39] the fairer the view,
[18:42] the harder the trial,
[18:46] the more I trust in you,
[18:49] the weaker I become,
[18:52] the more in you I'm strong.
[18:57] And I know if I abide in you,
[19:02] you'll ever abide in me. Let's sing that
[19:05] chorus one more time. Oh, the higher the
[19:09] mountain,
[19:11] the fairer the view,
[19:14] the harder the trial,
[19:18] the more I trust in you,
[19:21] the weaker I become,
[19:24] the more in you I'm strong.
[19:29] And I know if I abide in you,
[19:35] you'll ever abide in me.

[22:50] Unto
[22:52] you,
[22:55] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. We're so grateful that
[22:58] you're here tonight. Lord, we're here.
[23:02] So that means you're here, Lord God.
[23:05] That means that your angels are here as
[23:07] well because they're here to protect
[23:10] those that will inherit eternal life.
[23:13] And so God, your presence surrounds all
[23:16] of us right now, Lord. God, it's the
[23:18] reality of the word that we read, Lord,
[23:21] is here, Lord. And so, thank you, Lord
[23:23] Jesus. We bless your holy name. And God,
[23:26] we're just grateful for each one, Lord.
[23:30] We want your seeds of the word to be
[23:33] planted and fertilized, watered, Lord,
[23:37] and let somebody get the increase, Lord.
[23:40] And Lord Jesus, we just we thank you
[23:42] that you sent your word and you healed
[23:44] us and delivered us from all of our
[23:48] destructions. Nothing will separate us
[23:51] from you, Lord Jesus. God, we are a
[23:54] fruitful bride, Lord of the Word,
[23:58] manifesting ourselves through because of
[24:01] you, Lord Jesus. And we say thank you,
[24:04] Lord God. Who shall separate us from the
[24:07] love of God? No one. And so we say thank
[24:09] you, Lord. We ask you to have your way
[24:12] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Maybe
[24:15] that song, have your way.
[24:19] and way
[24:24] [Music]
[24:26] have your way.
[24:34] Holy
[24:36] Spirit,
[24:38] fill my heart
[24:41] and have your name.
[24:47] Hallelujah.
[24:49] Oh, as we wait,
[24:52] [Music]
[24:57] as we pray,
[25:05] speak your word
[25:09] into our hearts
[25:12] and have your way.
[25:17] Praise the Lord.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; That's what we want. Amen.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; It's good to be here tonight. Praise the
[25:22] Lord. Thank you.
[25:26] I guess I have control of that.
[25:30] Yes, I do. Praise the Lord. I'm always
[25:32] nervous when I see a new device.
[25:36] Hallelujah. God's so good. And we had
[25:39] such a good weekend and then a good
[25:42] Monday in Amish country. and and then we
[25:46] met the Abbotts.
[25:50] We still had a good time.
[25:54] Amen. So, we were about ready to part
[25:55] ways and said, "Well, I hope I see you
[25:57] again." I said, "Yeah, we'll be there
[25:58] Wednesday night." And he goes, "Yeah."
[26:00] He goes, "Brother Cha probably give you
[26:02] the nod." And I'm going, I said, "No
[26:06] way. I'm no way. I'm gonna go and I'm
[26:08] gonna sit and relax." And so we're we're
[26:10] almost back to line at about 6:15 and
[26:12] and all of a sudden the the the screen
[26:15] on the car lights up and it's like and
[26:17] it was brother Chad. It was like
[26:22] and one of the first things I asked him
[26:24] did did brother Simon talk to you?
[26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; God's good.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; He knows all things. Amen.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; And so we just greet you in the name of
[26:35] the Lord. Silas and had to go back for
[26:37] work and so the rest of the family's
[26:40] here and we're just happy to be here.
[26:43] And so tonight we want to talk about
[26:46] it's according to his word, not our
[26:48] reasoning.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; We have no thought coming whatsoever.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; And so he sent his word and healed us.
[26:56] So we should be healed. Amen.
[26:58] Spiritually, physically, financially,
[27:00] everything. And so let's go to the word.
[27:03] 2 Corinthians 10
[27:06] 4-5.
[27:12] 2 Corinthians 10. Actually, let's read
[27:16] 3-5.
[27:24] For though we walk in the flesh, we do
[27:27] not war after the flesh.
[27:31] Really, brother?
[27:32] Amen.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Really?
[27:35] &gt;&gt; No.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Got to get out of that old
[27:38] Pentecostal denominational thinking.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For the weapons of our
[27:45] warfare are not carnal, but mighty
[27:48] through God to the pulling down of
[27:49] strongholds, casting down imaginations,
[27:52] and every high thing that exaltth itself
[27:55] against the knowledge of God. Not
[27:58] intellectual, but the knowledge. You
[28:00] know it, and you have it. Amen.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; And bringing into captivity every
[28:04] thought to the obedience of Christ. Lord
[28:07] Jesus, we ask you to have your way like
[28:10] the song said, may the Holy Spirit be
[28:14] preeminent tonight. And may you discern
[28:17] my heart, our thoughts, our ways tonight
[28:20] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You may be seated.
[28:26] And so I put the amplified in there and
[28:29] you'll see why there's a grizzly in the
[28:32] background in a few minutes. So, but
[28:37] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[28:39] physical. And so where does the devil
[28:42] want us to fight our battles?
[28:44] &gt;&gt; In the flesh and our emotions.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. But that's not where it happens.
[28:50] Amen.
[28:51] weapons of our for the weapons of our
[28:54] warfare are not physical weapons of
[28:56] flesh and blood, but they are mighty
[28:59] before God for the overthrow and
[29:02] destruction of strongholds. What did
[29:04] Jesus say to Pilate?
[29:07] If this were my kingdom, my people would
[29:10] fight. Right? And so, he's saying, if if
[29:13] I if I wanted a fleshly fight, bring it
[29:16] on because I'm going to win. Right? But
[29:19] that's not the fight that he wanted to
[29:21] have. He wanted that. He wanted God to
[29:25] speak and to bring his word to pass in
[29:27] his life because it's a spiritual
[29:29] warfare. Amen. And he stood the test.
[29:33] Praise the Lord. In as much as we refute
[29:36] arguments and theories and reasonings
[29:39] and every proud and loftly thing that
[29:42] self sets itself up against the true
[29:45] knowledge of God and we lead every
[29:48] thought and purpose away captive into
[29:51] the obedience of Christ. Amen. And so
[29:54] you take that thought, you put them
[29:55] under your arm and you lead him away and
[29:57] then you kick him out. Amen.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; And so but here's Leadya. Brother,
[30:02] that's hard. Amen. Well,
[30:07] training is hard, right?
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Uh it's it's we have to fight the good
[30:12] fight of faith. This is a hard life. And
[30:14] so, the more that God reveals to you,
[30:17] the more he wants to show his love for
[30:19] you, he gives you more trials. It's
[30:21] hard. It's tough. Amen. But we've
[30:24] already won the battle. Amen. And so
[30:27] there's there's a lot of things where
[30:29] where we try to take it upon oursel when
[30:32] God's saying, "No, give it back to me."
[30:35] Amen. The other morning, uh, Silas got
[30:37] up and was on his way to work and and he
[30:40] took some pictures of the the tires on
[30:42] the front of our van. And they were they
[30:45] the the metal was showing through. And
[30:47] I've never ever had that happen before.
[30:50] And I was like, "What in the world?"
[30:52] And so I was sitting there, Lord, I
[30:55] said, "How are we going to how are we
[30:57] going to pay for that?" But I I got up
[31:00] and in my prayer time, I said, "Lord
[31:01] Jesus, you knew this before the
[31:03] foundation of the world." And Lord God,
[31:06] I know that you are the provider. So I'm
[31:08] going to I'm going to go to Costco. I'm
[31:09] going to get these tires put on and I'm
[31:11] going to go get an alignment. And I say,
[31:13] "Blessed be the name of the Lord. You're
[31:15] the provider."
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Didn't know where it was coming from.
[31:20] And so preached on testified a little
[31:22] bit on Wednesday night about it and then
[31:24] by Saturday um we have that on our mail
[31:27] system where you can see what you're
[31:29] getting before and it's like oh I don't
[31:30] recognize that that letter head. And so
[31:33] we get out there open up a letter
[31:37] and it had
[31:39] $300
[31:41] for us.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Towards those tires.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; And I'm just saying God you are so good
[31:48] to us. And you say, "But brother, that
[31:50] did that touched a third of it." I don't
[31:53] care.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; It was the side the cloud the size of a
[31:57] man's hand. Amen.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; And I just Oh, I just rejoice and we
[32:01] were so happy. Amen. And so God is so
[32:04] good to us.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to look for it. Amen.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; As a son or a daughter, God, you have to
[32:10] look for it. And the more and more he
[32:13] grows you, then the thoughts and intents
[32:15] of your heart begin to literally
[32:18] manifest
[32:19] in front of you. Amen. What whatever it
[32:23] may be, Amen. that you have a need of
[32:25] then. And and it's even if you say,
[32:27] "Lord, you know, I'd like to have that
[32:30] so I can do this around the house."
[32:32] Amen. Here comes something. Uh our our
[32:34] church house that we have, uh we needed
[32:37] a dishwasher in there. And and so Silas
[32:40] went to work and told his boss and said,
[32:41] "This is what I'm looking for." And so
[32:43] it's been about 8 months or 9 months.
[32:45] And the other day he his his boss said,
[32:48] "Are you still looking for for a
[32:50] dishwasher?" And he goes, "Yeah, a white
[32:52] Bosch." And he goes, "Okay, we'll we'll
[32:55] keep our eyes out." And and so he goes
[32:57] to walk out of the office. Here comes
[32:59] another uh person coming in and he goes,
[33:02] "Silus," he goes he goes, "I want to
[33:03] show you what I got." He goes, "It was a
[33:05] really hard uh extrication and install,
[33:08] but you know what?" He he goes, "Look at
[33:11] this. It's a white Bosch."
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Five minutes.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; And so he goes to his boss and his boss
[33:19] says, "You know what? That's for your
[33:22] church house. You can have it."
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Because they re it was so nice they'd
[33:26] resell it for, I don't know, five, six,
[33:29] $700.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; And so he gave him that. And you know
[33:33] people say yeah I don't know
[33:36] coincidence.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Hallelujah. I know that he
[33:40] knows the thoughts and intents of our
[33:42] heart. And that's why we must begin to
[33:45] think like that. We must begin to fight
[33:47] our battles with the word of God and
[33:49] then let God do it.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So we see that the
[33:53] weapons of our warfare, they're not in
[33:55] us. It's not us. It's not our strength.
[33:57] It's not our intellect. It it's none of
[33:59] that. But it's it's because the word has
[34:03] been restored.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, we come out of
[34:06] Pentecost denominational back in the
[34:09] early days. And so, you know,
[34:11] everybody's just, you know, the the
[34:13] harder, you know, the the more power
[34:15] would come when you scream and yell,
[34:18] right? And when you're just get that and
[34:20] he said, "And he's going to be here."
[34:23] You know, that that really brings the
[34:25] presence of God, right? Amen. And and
[34:28] they were sincere. We know that, right?
[34:29] And so we're not making fun that way.
[34:32] We're not blasphemy, but but it's we've
[34:35] turned a corner.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, all the signs and
[34:39] wonders and miracles are still happening
[34:42] in the life of of of the bride of Jesus
[34:45] Christ. It's it's a it's not a public
[34:48] show anymore.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But brother, you know, when
[34:54] I come, I kind of want to get that
[34:56] feeling going. And it's like, well,
[35:00] Amen. You know, it's your job to come
[35:04] already with the spirit.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; And then you pull on these people,
[35:08] right?
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And so, because God
[35:13] sent his restored word for the day, it
[35:16] has now become our absolute.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; It it's it's our life.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. This word is my life. Is our life.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So whatever it says, I have a
[35:27] desire to do it. And so because it's
[35:30] become the absolute, the devil will do
[35:32] all he can to get the people to think
[35:36] that the word is less in authority than
[35:39] it really is.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; He'll say, "Go ahead. Go to your message
[35:43] church. Believe for this. Agree with
[35:45] this." But when it comes down to the
[35:48] greatest battle you've ever thought,
[35:51] I really, you know, maybe not. Yeah.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God's already said it.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; And if you've been through one of your
[36:01] greatest battles that you've ever
[36:03] fought, you'll know that the devil's a
[36:05] liar.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that every word is true. And
[36:10] so, what does the devil want to do? He
[36:12] wants to present this message of the
[36:15] hour in a false light.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; And so, he wants to attract the
[36:20] attention of the people. Amen. to the
[36:23] leadership of his ways. And you know, he
[36:26] says, you know, it's been a long road,
[36:29] hasn't it, little bride? It's been so
[36:32] long. Yes. Yes, it has. And you know, do
[36:35] you see a lot going on? And you know,
[36:39] she might say, "Well, I don't see a
[36:41] lot." Well, you know what? Maybe we need
[36:43] to kind of go back.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Maybe we need to go back and kind of
[36:49] inject some life.
[36:52] And
[36:54] where are they going back to?
[36:57] &gt;&gt; The first part of this age
[37:00] &gt;&gt; instead of all the way back. But you
[37:02] know, for you and I, we're saying devil,
[37:05] that's good. You're a liar.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Because everything that that word has
[37:11] said to me, it's thus sayeth the Lord.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; And it comes to pass exactly the way
[37:17] that word says. Amen. And so I if you're
[37:21] I if that's why it's so important when
[37:23] you're when you're not married yet to
[37:25] receive the Holy Ghost so that that
[37:27] desire in you is only for the word
[37:29] because if you don't uh you'll last
[37:32] maybe two years.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; I've seen it.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; But with the Holy Ghost, you'll last
[37:39] into
[37:40] &gt;&gt; youth on the other side. Amen.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so the the devil
[37:46] wants to bring a false light to attract
[37:48] your attention so that he receives
[37:51] worship. What did brother Brandham say
[37:53] when he he he was behind the curtains
[37:55] listening to the supposed worship in the
[37:58] service? He sat there and cry and he
[38:00] says they don't know that they're
[38:02] worshiping the devil. Amen. Hallelujah.
[38:05] And so the the Holy Spirit, he's here.
[38:08] Amen. and and he's he's already working
[38:11] in us and and all it takes is our faith
[38:13] in that word by the Holy Ghost to set it
[38:16] on fire. Amen. Hallelujah. You have to
[38:20] have a a spark to to get a fire going
[38:23] like the old song says. Amen. I was a
[38:26] firefighter too long. Amen. The old joke
[38:29] is, well, it was a mouse playing with
[38:31] matches. No, probably more than that.
[38:34] Amen.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But so the devil receives,
[38:39] he wants to receive the worship and he's
[38:42] going to fight that. That's why we're in
[38:43] the age of the razor's edge. Amen. And
[38:46] so when God wanted to speak, let's look
[38:49] backwards into the Old Testament. When
[38:51] God wanted to speak to Elijah at the
[38:54] cave, God showed up in a great and a
[38:58] visible way. Amen.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; With the earthquake, the great wind, and
[39:03] the fire. Amen. And you know what?
[39:06] Elijah wasn't unfamiliar with that. And
[39:09] he's probably going, "Pretty good, God.
[39:13] Oo, yes. Look at the rocks fly on that
[39:15] one." Amen. But that wasn't what he was
[39:18] looking for.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so that's the way with a
[39:22] married couple. You're not really
[39:23] looking for all the fluff. Amen. You're
[39:26] you're looking for that that I love you
[39:29] and with that look on her face or your
[39:31] face that you know that you know that
[39:33] you know. Amen. So he was looking for a
[39:37] still small voice. Amen. That spoke to
[39:40] him. That's why he only came out for
[39:42] that. And that's why the bride of Jesus
[39:44] Christ today is not pulled over here in
[39:46] emotionalism or pulled over here in
[39:48] intellectualism, but she's right in the
[39:51] middle saying, "I'm here, Lord. I'm
[39:54] listening for your word. Amen. This
[39:57] word. This is the scriptures revealed.
[40:00] Amen. And that's when I mention the
[40:02] word, I'm speaking about this.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so I it's always been
[40:08] for the religious
[40:10] that those scriptures that are revealed
[40:13] are the hardest thing for people to
[40:16] hear.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; And so you preach on the word and then
[40:19] people go, "Yeah, yeah, I believe it. I
[40:22] got it." And then they go out and live
[40:24] opposite. And it's like, no, you don't
[40:26] understand. You don't have it.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to surrender to it.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the young people are
[40:34] watching you.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; And and everything you do, they're going
[40:38] to they're going to pick it up and say,
[40:40] "Oh, well, that must be fine because
[40:41] brother so and so and sister so and so
[40:43] does it." Amen. But see, we're we're in
[40:46] a we've turned a corner. And so as we've
[40:49] turned this corner to a life of the
[40:51] word, then the young people must see a
[40:55] life in the parents, the grandparents,
[40:57] amen, so that they can know and emulate
[41:01] the the behaviors, amen, of the Holy
[41:04] Ghost until they get their own. Praise
[41:07] the Lord. Because it's hard to hear
[41:09] that. Brother Ram speaks about it over
[41:11] and over. It It's so hard to receive God
[41:15] in simplicity. It was hard for the
[41:17] Philistines to comprehend Samson who was
[41:20] a little shrimp. It was hard for the
[41:22] Pharisees to look at Jesus who was a
[41:25] little guy. It was hard for
[41:27] denominations to look at brother Brandon
[41:29] with his education. And it's hard today
[41:31] in the message community to accept a
[41:34] bride who is in the word and the word
[41:36] only.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He is a living God
[41:40] tonight.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; You can't convince me otherwise.
[41:46] Amen. Hallelujah. Every word. And so God
[41:52] in simplicity and revealing himself in
[41:55] the same.
[41:57] And so that's what the devil wants
[42:01] people to stay away from is God in
[42:04] simplicity.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. They they want you to come and try
[42:07] to get healed of sicknesses and things
[42:10] be and when you haven't asked for
[42:12] forgiveness of your sin
[42:14] &gt;&gt; and you're still disliking or have funny
[42:16] feelings towards other people. Yeah. He
[42:18] loves that because it discourages you
[42:22] when nothing happens because the word
[42:24] says it that faith works by love and
[42:27] forgiveness. And you do that and it's
[42:30] thus sayeth the Lord right there
[42:32] &gt;&gt; or in your seat, right? Amen. And so
[42:36] that's what he wants. And so he he's
[42:39] revealing himself in the same and that's
[42:41] what the devil wants God's people to
[42:43] stay away from when when they're hearing
[42:45] from God. He wants them to all of a
[42:48] sudden just start, you know, oh glory,
[42:52] glory. I've seen it over and over.
[42:54] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise
[42:56] the Lord.
[42:58] Amen. Even in message churches
[43:01] supposedly prophesying, thus sayeth the
[43:04] Lord, thus sayeth the Lord, thus sayeth
[43:06] the Lord.
[43:08] That's not that that's that's a good
[43:10] person who's gotten caught up in an
[43:11] emotion. And so, Brother Brandham says
[43:14] that you should come to him sely and
[43:16] calmly. Amen. Are you going to be
[43:18] crying? Absolutely. Amen. Are you going
[43:21] to be balling sometimes? Absolutely. But
[43:24] you are coming and he says you're making
[43:27] a decision for Christ with a sane and a
[43:29] sound mind. Amen. And that is completely
[43:33] against everything this world teaches.
[43:35] Hallelujah. But that's what God wants us
[43:39] is to be able to make that our calling
[43:42] and our election. Sure. And so the devil
[43:44] wants you and I to see this word in the
[43:48] light of the cosmos,
[43:50] &gt;&gt; in the light of a non-biblical teaching,
[43:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Who said that you when
[43:58] you receive the Holy Ghost that you have
[44:00] to do it a certain way? Who says that
[44:02] you have to be healed by the laying on
[44:04] of hands? Amen. That's biblical. Yes.
[44:06] But who says that? Amen. That's a
[44:09] denominational person who wants to
[44:11] receive all the glory.
[44:13] Amen. We are in a different light. We've
[44:16] turned a corner into the word. Amen.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:21] Amen. But he says, don't don't view it
[44:24] in the light of today. His light is his
[44:28] life. His life is his light. Amen.
[44:31] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's so good.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Romans 13:12,
[44:38] the night is far spent. The day is at
[44:41] hand.
[44:42] Let us therefore cast off the works of
[44:44] darkness and let us put on the armor of
[44:47] light. Amen. He says to walk in the
[44:50] light as we are in the light.
[44:51] Pentecostalism is not the light of
[44:53] today. Amen. God has built all the
[44:58] necessary things. Now we're here as a
[45:00] fully mature bride of Jesus Christ
[45:03] walking in the word of God being
[45:05] victorious over the person shaking their
[45:08] hand at you at the stoplight. Amen.
[45:12] Hallelujah. You're being victorious.
[45:15] Oh, I thought I was doing such a good
[45:17] deed the other day. Walked out in the
[45:20] parking lot of Costco and there's a big
[45:24] uh package of of paper plates. And it's
[45:27] like we needed those. And I said, "You
[45:30] know what?
[45:31] I'm going to take those back in. They're
[45:33] going to say, you just go ahead and take
[45:35] them." So I walk back in and I say,
[45:38] "Hey, I found these in the parking lot."
[45:39] He goes, "Oh, thank you.
[45:41] He goes, "See you later." And I got to
[45:44] thinking, "Lord, forgive me. I don't
[45:47] have to be rewarded every time I do
[45:49] something good." Right? Oh, but see, God
[45:53] has different plans for us. And he
[45:55] provides in different ways than what we
[45:57] think.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Uh John 12 and 46, it
[46:01] says, "I am I am come as a light that
[46:05] whosoever believeth in me should not
[46:07] abide in darkness." Amen. The five-fold
[46:10] ministry with the Holy Ghost comes as a
[46:12] light.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride of Jesus Christ is here
[46:15] as a light. Amen. Not somebody sitting
[46:18] in church just to be in church. Amen.
[46:21] But you you witness with your life. You
[46:24] witness with your word sometimes. But
[46:26] people see the light of your life. Amen.
[46:30] And that's what God has designed. Again,
[46:32] it's not according to what we think.
[46:34] It's what he his word has already said.
[46:37] Praise the Lord Jesus. And so the
[46:40] religious in the days of Jesus flesh,
[46:43] they had the scriptures
[46:45] &gt;&gt; just as we do today. But they couldn't
[46:48] receive the light of the scriptures.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Many people can receive the
[46:53] knowledge of the scripture. But did they
[46:56] receive the light of the scripture? And
[46:58] so that that old devil, he desires you
[47:01] and I to accept in our mind
[47:06] that you know God is good all the time,
[47:10] isn't he?
[47:11] &gt;&gt; But you know,
[47:14] is he really going to bring you to full
[47:16] maturity all the way? Is he really going
[47:18] to do it? Is he really going to bring
[47:21] you to a full maturity, a real birth?
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he wants you to believe
[47:28] most of it, but he wants there to be
[47:31] doubt in that little last part. Amen.
[47:35] That comes with some of those greatest
[47:37] battles you'll ever fight. Amen. And so
[47:40] he he he wants you to keep have that
[47:42] little bit saying, "I don't know, you
[47:44] know, uh my husband was saved from drugs
[47:47] and alcohol, but in in the pressure of
[47:50] this time, honey, are you really going
[47:52] to hold?"
[47:54] Uh yeah.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because it was him who started the
[48:00] work.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, how can God take back his life
[48:03] when he's already given it to you?
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. And so, the devil
[48:09] wants us to think that all that God has
[48:11] given you somehow is still controlled
[48:14] from this dimension.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Rubbish.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; This flesh does not control God. Your
[48:20] spirit realm does not control God and
[48:23] his word. Amen. It is not controlled in
[48:26] this. We we gain wisdom or we gain
[48:28] character in this dimension, but this
[48:31] has no control of the word. Amen.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And so he's saying,
[48:37] but you know, your flesh and you know,
[48:40] you've been praying for this a long time
[48:42] and and
[48:44] you're saying, "Yeah, yeah, I know. But
[48:47] my husband says,
[48:48] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking at my flesh. I'm not
[48:51] looking at my emotions." Hallelujah.
[48:54] Amen. I'm looking at it all. He's
[48:57] promised to give all to me. All things.
[49:00] Amen. Praise the Lord. And so tonight,
[49:05] who, what, where, and when is your
[49:08] giant,
[49:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Does it seem impossible?
[49:17] And we should not be sitting there
[49:19] going, "Yes, brother. It seems
[49:21] impossible.
[49:24] No, we're we've turned a corner,
[49:26] remember?
[49:28] &gt;&gt; And it should be. Yes, brother. It has
[49:31] been a hard and a battle and it's been a
[49:35] struggle and and sometimes I just feel
[49:37] like thrown in the towel. But greater is
[49:40] he that is in me than he that's in this
[49:43] world. My God is greater today than than
[49:45] when I I was first first came to him. He
[49:48] is more wonderful today. Amen.
[49:51] Amen. That's where it is. The giant. Who
[49:54] is the giant? The giant's already dead
[49:56] in the sight of God. The giant was
[49:58] already dead. Amen. In the mind and the
[50:01] vision of of David. Praise the Lord.
[50:04] Because he was already dead in the
[50:06] vision of God.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. And so when
[50:13] brother Random went to British Columbia
[50:15] for that hunting trip, the Lord already
[50:17] showed him in a vision
[50:19] &gt;&gt; that he would get a caribou with 42in
[50:22] rack and a silver tip grizzly.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; And so the word was already given.
[50:29] You're saying, "Praise the Lord,
[50:30] brother. That's right, brother Bradam."
[50:32] Oh, he just he just went up there. Boom
[50:35] and boom.
[50:37] No,
[50:39] no.
[50:40] The word had been spoken.
[50:46] Not one, not one time did the vision
[50:48] fail.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Just like the word for the day.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; This word has never failed.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; It is always always victorious in what
[50:58] it says. Never failed.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you might be saying, "Well,
[51:03] brother, I prayed about this." You know
[51:04] what? It's usually us. It's not the
[51:06] word.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that word was spoken. It is
[51:11] never wrong. And that vision cannot
[51:14] fail.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like look at Elijah in the cave.
[51:20] Already knew what God was like. Already
[51:23] knew the visions. Already knew the word
[51:25] of the Lord. But he knew that they could
[51:28] not fail. Amen. But he must hear the
[51:32] voice of God before he goes and speaks
[51:34] it out.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Today we must know what
[51:39] the word of God says before we go to
[51:42] speak it out. Amen. Because that's our
[51:44] lifeline right there. Praise the Lord.
[51:47] And so the guide who was with brother
[51:50] Brandham began telling him that, "Oh,
[51:53] brother, I've grown up here all my life.
[51:56] I've hunted here and I I I've guided
[51:58] here and there's never ever been a
[52:02] grizzly bear here.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Wow. What an encouragement, right?
[52:09] &gt;&gt; And brother Brown said the devil was
[52:11] trying to get him to think he
[52:13] misunderstood the vision. And that's
[52:16] exactly what he does to you and I when
[52:18] we prayed about something and it doesn't
[52:20] happen quick. We say, "Well, did did I
[52:22] do this? Did I do this?" or you know
[52:25] maybe healing is is not for me or you
[52:28] know God doesn't answers everybody
[52:31] everybody's prayer look at Paul no your
[52:34] your job is to prepare yourself apply
[52:38] the word and go believing
[52:40] &gt;&gt; amen that's what God wants from us
[52:42] &gt;&gt; and so the the guide the devil was using
[52:45] the guide to try to discourage and make
[52:48] him think he misunderstood it but the
[52:50] guide he agreed God was the healer
[52:53] because his brother was healed.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; But this was this was impossible.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; But you know, God can heal, but when it
[53:04] comes to the impossible, oh, I don't
[53:06] know.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; He was manifesting doubt.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so,
[53:14] see, the devil likes to come to our
[53:17] marriages, to our health, our careers,
[53:21] everything we do as humans. And he wants
[53:24] to say ultimately, it's still under my
[53:28] control.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's a bluff,
[53:31] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Everything you do is really under my
[53:34] control.
[53:36] Because God really cannot truly control
[53:39] these things through his word. He just
[53:41] can't. It's too simple, brother Gabe.
[53:43] It's too simple, right? He He can't do
[53:46] it. You're going to be in that condition
[53:48] the rest of your life. I'm sorry.
[53:52] No.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; No. You You are already in the spirit
[53:56] realm in the condition of what the word
[53:58] has said.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; You're living and going to church today
[54:01] because you're in the condition of what
[54:03] the word has already spoke.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we may not speak that out,
[54:08] but that's the feelings that the devil
[54:10] tries to pour in there.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, I've lived this so long. Is it
[54:14] really going to happen? And he said,
[54:18] "Don't say those words. Please don't
[54:21] don't hurt me."
[54:23] &gt;&gt; That hurts God when we doubt him.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. He sent his word and healed us and
[54:30] delivered us from all of our
[54:32] destructions. And so the devil wants us
[54:34] to believe that everything the word is
[54:36] telling us that the Lord said he
[54:39] controls somehow is really controlled in
[54:43] this old carcass. Amen.
[54:46] And and he'll make sure that there's
[54:48] people around you. Well, brother,
[54:50] sister, I've Hey, I believe God's a
[54:53] healer, right? But I've never seen him
[54:55] heal that.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Kind of like mental retardation.
[55:06] That's hard for people to think that God
[55:07] can heal. But just listen to the tapes.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; God heals that,
[55:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; God heals cancer.
[55:19] We
[55:20] we have a family that has a friend who
[55:24] who had cancer and they had her at the
[55:27] house and and this this woman that had
[55:29] the cancer was a registered nurse and
[55:31] and she had taken care of charity when
[55:34] she was in the hospital and another
[55:35] sister at the church when she was in the
[55:37] hospital. And so she'd done a lot of
[55:39] good things for the bride. And so her
[55:43] husband was there with her at our
[55:45] friend's house and and so they asked
[55:47] could we come and pray for him. So at
[55:49] communion that Sunday, we took a prayer
[55:51] cloth, we all prayed over it, went there
[55:53] to the house and and they're they're of
[55:56] another flavor of religion that you know
[55:58] may not really believe about healing.
[56:01] And so we talked about taking the the
[56:04] things from the aprons from the body of
[56:06] Paul and and everything else about
[56:08] laying on of hands. Amen. And so we
[56:10] began to pray
[56:13] and the presence of God just came down
[56:18] mightily.
[56:20] And one of the brothers looked at me and
[56:22] says, "He's here." I said, "Yeah, I
[56:24] know." But here's the lesson.
[56:29] That's good.
[56:33] And you're going to say, "Brother,
[56:34] you're really going to say this?" Yeah,
[56:36] I'm going to say this.
[56:38] This is greater than that.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; I enjoy that. Don't we enjoy those
[56:43] times?
[56:44] &gt;&gt; We're nothing against that.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; But I want people to see this was the
[56:49] absolute of why she's now cancer free.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Stage four cancer gone.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The husband was kind of
[56:59] lary of me at first and afterwards I go
[57:02] to shake his hand. He goes, "Come here."
[57:03] And we're so fat. I was just like, "Come
[57:05] here." Amen.
[57:08] Hallelujah.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; It was his word that did it.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. And so it's uh
[57:19] they say or you know
[57:22] maybe it's not meant for you.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; You know that's the other thing when but
[57:27] here's the thing. When God showed it to
[57:29] you as a believer in the word it is for
[57:32] you.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God wants you to go
[57:36] confessing it as yours. Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Because when when God began to deal with
[57:42] me about the fire service before I got
[57:45] saved, I I I just started as a volunteer
[57:48] firefighter and this uh firefighter came
[57:52] through my check stand. I was I was
[57:54] doing retail and and I seen he had a
[57:56] certain shirt on. I go, "Oh, I I'm a
[57:58] volunteer. You know how you're so
[58:00] giddy?" And he's probably going, "Oo,
[58:02] another another volunteer, right?" And
[58:06] and so so he goes, "Well, how old are
[58:08] you?" And I told him, he goes, "Nah,
[58:10] forget it. You're too old." I was like,
[58:13] "30."
[58:15] And he goes, "You need to think about
[58:17] something else." But why did he say
[58:19] that? Because God had already placed the
[58:22] vision in my heart, even unconverted.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And inside of me, it was like,
[58:29] "Uh, listen, buddy.
[58:31] You're way older than I am, but you know
[58:33] what? I'm not even going to listen to
[58:35] you."
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Because the vision says, "I'm a
[58:38] firefighter."
[58:40] &gt;&gt; And it manifested, right?
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And God used it for the church and for
[58:46] ministry. And so that that's why when
[58:49] the devil comes through other people or
[58:51] thoughts in your in your mind then you
[58:54] can say no I have a vision of the word
[58:56] already and it already says this.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. And so the the
[59:02] devil can tell you that your life must
[59:05] have a just a little bit of the cosmos
[59:08] to be normal for people to accept you.
[59:11] It's like I'm not here to be accepted.
[59:12] That's the beauty of getting older. You
[59:14] just don't care. Amen. But but it is
[59:17] it's true. You I'm not here to be
[59:19] accepted.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm not there at work when I was
[59:22] working to be accepted. Amen. I'm there
[59:25] to preach the truth. Somebody was at the
[59:28] table one day making fun of speaking in
[59:30] tongues. So I went around and he was a
[59:32] higher rank than I. And I said, "You
[59:34] shouldn't have said that." I said, "I'm
[59:36] not mad at you, but here's the truth."
[59:38] And he got so scared thought I was going
[59:39] to write him up, right? And but no, I
[59:42] But you got to stand for things
[59:44] sometimes. Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he wants to say, "Well, you
[59:49] got to look like a little bit like the
[59:52] modern church." And and that's that was
[59:54] the trouble with the two little brides
[59:56] in the back. Remember,
[59:57] &gt;&gt; they had their eyes on
[59:59] &gt;&gt; the nominal church.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yet, but the devil doesn't
[1:00:04] understand that your word is that his
[1:00:07] word in you. That's normal. My normal is
[1:00:11] this. Your normal is this. This leads
[1:00:14] and guides and takes care of us no
[1:00:16] matter what situation you are in. Praise
[1:00:19] be to God. And so, Brother Brandham and
[1:00:21] the guide, they got the 42-in caribou.
[1:00:25] And
[1:00:26] just like the vision said, but now the
[1:00:29] test, now they had to start down the
[1:00:32] mountain
[1:00:34] where bears don't naturally live.
[1:00:38] How would you like to be in that
[1:00:39] situation?
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:43] Even before the trip started, Brother
[1:00:46] Brandham says, "Does anyone have a
[1:00:47] checkered shirt?" All the brothers are
[1:00:49] going, "Nope.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Nobody has it."
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you got that. He see the
[1:00:54] devil's trying to make him doubt, right?
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; And so, but he says, you know, in the
[1:00:59] vision, it showed somebody with small
[1:01:01] hands measuring the rack with a with a a
[1:01:04] checkered shirt. But see, the guide
[1:01:07] that was with him was not really
[1:01:09] believing. And when you don't believe,
[1:01:12] you begin to state the obvious.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; You've been in that wheelchair a long
[1:01:18] time.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; But what did Brother Brown say? If you
[1:01:21] stay in that wheelchair, you're going to
[1:01:24] die. He goes, "If I was you, I would get
[1:01:27] up."
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, what would that do?
[1:01:30] You're throwing the rock in the air.
[1:01:32] Amen. Hallelujah. If you stay there and
[1:01:35] and you don't let God do something in
[1:01:37] your finances, you will die. do
[1:01:40] something that the word says. Amen.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. So even
[1:01:45] before that, the the discouragement was
[1:01:47] trying to come. But the the the guide
[1:01:50] began to state the natural laws.
[1:01:54] Amen.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; This is what governs what we do out here
[1:01:59] is this. It's the terrain because at
[1:02:01] different levels of terrain, different
[1:02:03] animals live. That's natural law.
[1:02:07] But God's not governed by natural law.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; He's governed by the word of God. And so
[1:02:12] whatever you're going through, whatever
[1:02:14] your business is going through, whatever
[1:02:16] your relationships are going through,
[1:02:18] Amen. We we are not governed by what Dr.
[1:02:22] Phil or whoever it is these days says.
[1:02:24] Amen. We're we're not governed by by the
[1:02:27] the the finance guru. Amen. Though he
[1:02:30] has good stuff, but but we're not
[1:02:32] governed by that. I'm not governed by
[1:02:34] the little bit of retirement that I got
[1:02:36] from the fire department. I don't depend
[1:02:38] upon that.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. Yeah, you can say that. I I
[1:02:42] mean it.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Who put me into that job?
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Not me.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Who gave me that? Not me.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Who is answering prayers? Not me.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; It's him. Praise the Lord. Whatever God
[1:02:56] wants, he will provide for it. I've seen
[1:02:58] it over and over and over.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so
[1:03:05] God is governed by his word.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; We can see it in the life of Jesus
[1:03:10] Christ when you apply faith into it. And
[1:03:15] so
[1:03:17] someone says, "Oh, you have this
[1:03:18] disease. You have this sickness. You
[1:03:20] have this financial difficulty.
[1:03:25] You're going to have to take these
[1:03:26] herbs. I'm sorry.
[1:03:32] You're going to have to drink this non
[1:03:33] juice or whatever.
[1:03:38] Amen. You know that that'll help. And
[1:03:40] you know what? You're going to have to
[1:03:42] you're going to have to make your will
[1:03:44] out. You know, everything is they're
[1:03:47] they're Job's helpers. Everything is
[1:03:49] pulled down into the natural.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; It's they're not lifting you up into the
[1:03:54] what the word of God says. Amen. And so,
[1:03:58] last time I checked, we're sons and
[1:04:00] we're daughters of God.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; And so, sickness, those type of things,
[1:04:07] difficulties, when we look at the word,
[1:04:10] we say, "Husband,
[1:04:13] what have you said about my situation?
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; What am I going to do about this,
[1:04:18] husband?" Amen. Before I proceed
[1:04:20] anywhere or with anything, what have you
[1:04:23] said? And he says, "Okay, turn to this
[1:04:26] chapter, this verse." Amen. Praise the
[1:04:29] Lord. And I will tell you what to do.
[1:04:31] Amen. And so, here's a quote. And for
[1:04:35] three miles right down, there's not even
[1:04:37] a bush 4 in high, nothing but caribou
[1:04:40] moss, a few bberries, and they only get
[1:04:43] two or three inches high. He said,
[1:04:44] "Caribu moss.
[1:04:47] Blueberries."
[1:04:49] Hm. Plum down to the timberline.
[1:04:53] and our horses are hitched down there at
[1:04:54] the timber line. And now, according to
[1:04:57] what you've told me before we ca come
[1:04:59] here, that somewhere between here and
[1:05:02] where that boy standing with the
[1:05:04] checkered shirt,
[1:05:07] you're still going to kill a 9 foot
[1:05:09] grizzly. And so that's the devil for
[1:05:13] you, right?
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You mean to tell me that God has
[1:05:17] saved you from drugs and alcohol and
[1:05:20] that you're never going back?
[1:05:23] Yep.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You mean that God has
[1:05:31] changed you so much that you you won't
[1:05:33] even fall to this?
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; That That's right, devil. Good. You're
[1:05:40] getting the picture, right? Amen. But
[1:05:42] brother Brandham, he he he had to stand
[1:05:45] there with the word already given to
[1:05:48] him. Amen. And tell him, bud, that's
[1:05:52] thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:05:54] Amen. Somebody comes to you with an
[1:05:57] issue and you said, "Well, it's it's
[1:05:59] already thus sayeth the Lord." I I
[1:06:03] people, they hate it when you say that,
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; When you're preaching sometimes,
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; you know why they hate it? Because they
[1:06:10] don't believe it. And when you say thus
[1:06:12] sayeth the Lord, that puts them in a
[1:06:14] corner.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you're not putting them,
[1:06:17] you're putting the devil that's
[1:06:18] anointing them into a corner.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Your life tonight is thus
[1:06:23] sayeth the Lord.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:27] Amen. I don't know how it's going to be,
[1:06:29] but it's thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; That that's what the revelation of this
[1:06:33] day has done to us.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram said it's caused us to
[1:06:38] believe that he's the same yesterday,
[1:06:39] today, and forever. We got to stop
[1:06:42] thinking all the time about signs and
[1:06:43] wonders and miracles. Amen. It's your
[1:06:46] everyday life with the word. Amen.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so
[1:06:53] God's waiting for us just to come to his
[1:06:55] word. He's saying, "Honey, I just I just
[1:06:59] want you to believe me.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; That's all."
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; And and we go, "Have you told it to me
[1:07:05] before?" He goes, "Yeah, but here, I'll
[1:07:07] show you again." Oh,
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; praise God. Thank you, Lord. Thank you
[1:07:11] for having mercy. And so, when Satan is
[1:07:14] trying to get us to take his reasoning
[1:07:16] and things, that's when it's a good time
[1:07:19] to restate out loud what the word says.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because the devil can't read
[1:07:26] your mind. But when you need
[1:07:28] encouragement, say, "Lord, I thank you
[1:07:30] so much that you have healed my
[1:07:34] sickness. You have healed my this this
[1:07:38] depressive spirit. That is a lie. It's a
[1:07:40] bluff. You have healed this anxiety.
[1:07:43] It's a lie. It's a bluff. Amen.
[1:07:45] Hallelujah. And so God is in the
[1:07:47] business of manifesting himself in a
[1:07:50] still small voice. Brother Gabe was at
[1:07:52] our at our
[1:07:54] church at the beginning of the year and
[1:07:56] he was ministering and he was speaking
[1:07:58] on something and I'm I'm sitting there
[1:08:00] thinking, "Oh, that's what I have.
[1:08:06] That's what that's that's what that's
[1:08:08] what this issue is." And and so I'm
[1:08:11] talking to God. I said, "Lord, I don't
[1:08:14] want that. you know that I just want I
[1:08:18] want you to have your way and and cause
[1:08:20] me to respond correctly and cause me
[1:08:22] just to to be what you want me to be.
[1:08:25] Lord, please take it in the name of
[1:08:27] Jesus.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; It was gone.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; And it hasn't been back.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; But see, what do we want to do? We want
[1:08:38] to go up and brother, lay hands on me.
[1:08:41] Cast that demon out.
[1:08:45] No,
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; we're we've turned a corner, folks.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; This is not about the great man anymore.
[1:08:52] It's about the great husband.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:56] Look at Satan in the wilderness. He was
[1:08:58] trying to tempt him. And we're we're
[1:08:59] over halfway. So, we're going good. And
[1:09:02] so
[1:09:04] even when Satan was tempting Jesus in
[1:09:07] the wilderness and he was trying Jesus
[1:09:12] by the word of God and he was trying to
[1:09:15] get Jesus to reason against the word of
[1:09:17] God. And so Jesus was hungry. No doubt
[1:09:20] about it. He was probably extremely
[1:09:23] hungry. And you know, the devil's
[1:09:25] probably going, "Oh, Jesus, wouldn't
[1:09:28] these nice
[1:09:31] sourdough rolls with hot butter,
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; right? Wouldn't they taste so good right
[1:09:39] now?" Amen. Tempting his flesh.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So hungry, trying to get him
[1:09:48] to step out of the will of God because
[1:09:50] of his flesh.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. But see what had to be fulfilled,
[1:09:55] the word. And so even though he was
[1:09:58] saying, "Oh, God, I am so hungry. I want
[1:10:03] that fresh hot butter bread. But but I
[1:10:07] can't and I won't."
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Satan, get you behind me.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; And he left for a season.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; It was no, you better back up, Satan.
[1:10:18] Here I go.
[1:10:20] Boom. Lightning bolt takes him out. No,
[1:10:24] he just says,
[1:10:28] "Satan,
[1:10:31] get you behind me."
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone,
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; but by every word from the mouth of God.
[1:10:40] Amen. He stayed with the will of God,
[1:10:42] though his flesh screamed
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; the opposite.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Your emotions will scream the opposite
[1:10:50] sometimes. I've been there. A lot of us
[1:10:51] have been there. It'll scream the
[1:10:54] opposite,
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; but you're going, "Lord, I'm not looking
[1:10:57] at my flesh.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking at my emotions." The
[1:11:03] word says the word says. The word says,
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; "Amen and amen. Hallelujah." As as you
[1:11:11] get closer to the manifestation of your
[1:11:14] prayer, that's when, brother Ram says,
[1:11:16] the devil starts a countdown or a
[1:11:18] showdown and he turns up the heat and it
[1:11:20] gets worse. Amen. Trying to discourage
[1:11:23] you.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. As Jesus was going to the cross,
[1:11:26] he said, "Lord," he goes, "Father, take
[1:11:29] this from me."
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Because the heat was turned up. Amen.
[1:11:36] But he came to that point, Lord, it it
[1:11:39] it'll only be a few hours of tearing my
[1:11:42] flesh and poking me with the spear, but
[1:11:45] not my will, but yours be done.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:11:49] have your way. In the ministry is, Lord,
[1:11:54] people only only bite and nash upon the
[1:11:58] ministry because they don't know any
[1:12:00] better.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, please spare their life.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Cuz maybe maybe you can use me in some
[1:12:09] way, right?
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; It's we're not Jews. Lord, wipe them all
[1:12:14] off the face of the earth.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; No. Father, forgive them. They don't
[1:12:19] know what they're doing.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so the guy told him,
[1:12:24] "Look, look, brother. Look,
[1:12:28] nothing."
[1:12:34] trying to get brother Brandham to back
[1:12:35] up from that vision.
[1:12:37] Amen. But see, the same God who gave him
[1:12:40] that word gives us this word today. He,
[1:12:43] the devil saying, "Look, look, you're
[1:12:46] too sick. Forget it. You're going to
[1:12:48] die."
[1:12:50] Someone was telling me a testimony or
[1:12:53] about someone who believed what the
[1:12:55] doctor said. The doctor said, "Oh, you
[1:12:57] have cancer."
[1:12:59] And they went nine months confessing
[1:13:02] cancer.
[1:13:03] went finally to another doctor and and
[1:13:07] they did an exam and the person says,
[1:13:09] "Well, how long do I have to live?" And
[1:13:11] they go, "What do you what do you mean?"
[1:13:13] He goes, "Well, how far is the cancer?"
[1:13:15] He goes, "You don't have cancer."
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; It was a misdiagnosis.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; I worked around doctors for almost 30
[1:13:23] years. There's a reason why it's called
[1:13:25] the practice of medicine. Yeah.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; somebody had to finish in the bottom of
[1:13:34] their class.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; And we're just paramedics. We don't know
[1:13:40] everything. But
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; but when you're diagnosing a stroke and
[1:13:45] it's a blood sugar problem,
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; I think I'd want a second opinion.
[1:13:50] Right?
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; But see, we have the first opinion and
[1:13:54] that's what the word of God says to us.
[1:13:56] Amen.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; And so the same God that gave brother
[1:13:58] Brandon the word has given you the word
[1:14:00] tonight. It is your atomic weapon is
[1:14:03] sitting right in your seat with you.
[1:14:05] Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so that word is able to
[1:14:10] bring every one of your circumstances
[1:14:13] under
[1:14:14] dominion to you.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; What does brother Bram say when two
[1:14:20] omnipotence meet?
[1:14:22] Oo,
[1:14:24] I don't know, brother.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; No, I know.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; You're the bride and you're just like
[1:14:30] brother Marcus does.
[1:14:38] Got a big B right there.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; The letter, number, letter, whatever it
[1:14:43] is. Hallelujah.
[1:14:46] You're the wife of God last time I
[1:14:47] checked.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so
[1:14:52] we have to not believe our thoughts, not
[1:14:54] believe our flesh. Amen. You're not
[1:14:56] denying what's there, right? If if you
[1:14:59] have a cancer, you have a sickness or a
[1:15:02] condition, you say, "Lord, this is a
[1:15:05] line bluff that the devil has thrown on
[1:15:08] me."
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; But I know
[1:15:14] that greater are you that is in me than
[1:15:17] he that's in this world. I'm going to
[1:15:18] stay with that. Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so Matthew 19:26,
[1:15:23] but Jesus,
[1:15:26] but Jesus beheld them and said unto
[1:15:28] them, "With men, this is impossible.
[1:15:31] With the flesh and the spirit realm,
[1:15:33] yeah, this is impossible, but with God,
[1:15:36] all things are possible."
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I like that one. Here's
[1:15:40] Job 42:2. I know that thou can't do
[1:15:45] everything and that no thought can be
[1:15:48] withholden from thee. Praise the Lord
[1:15:50] Jesus. I know my husband can do
[1:15:52] anything. Praise the Lord. Praise the
[1:15:56] Lord Jesus. I can even change the drive
[1:15:59] belt of my riding lawnmower.
[1:16:04] I That was the dirtiest I've ever been
[1:16:06] in my life cuz all that stuff falls
[1:16:09] down. And so I made a little video clip.
[1:16:11] I said, "This is the face of DIY."
[1:16:15] I said, "I am filthy." Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:16:19] Thank God for YouTube. Praise the Lord.
[1:16:22] Genesis 18:13 and 14. And the Lord said
[1:16:25] unto Abraham, "Wherefore did Sarah
[1:16:27] laugh, saying, Shall I of assurity bear
[1:16:30] a child which I'm old? Is" And then he
[1:16:33] says, "What did you say?
[1:16:38] Is there anything too hard for the Lord?
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, we're having hard times
[1:16:45] financially.
[1:16:47] Is there if you're paying your tithes
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; on the gross,
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; you know, I have I don't have any
[1:16:58] sympathy for people that don't pay their
[1:16:59] tithes or pay on the net. I'm sorry. I
[1:17:02] don't
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; because we have a corporation and so I
[1:17:07] don't get all the money. So I feel very
[1:17:10] comfortable addressing it.
[1:17:13] Do you want a gross blessing or a net
[1:17:15] blessing,
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; But that's your duty. That that's just
[1:17:23] your duty.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Where you're blessed is when you give
[1:17:26] offerings.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; The lights have to come on. It's just
[1:17:28] not Oh, they just turn on miraculously.
[1:17:31] No, your general fund pays the bills.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; That comes from your offerings. Amen.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; And so, is anything too hard for the
[1:17:41] Lord?
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not a thing. Praise the Lord
[1:17:44] Jesus. And so, Brother Brandham took one
[1:17:48] more big look. He said, "Oh, the beauty
[1:17:51] of the mountains." And and he's looking
[1:17:53] around and then all of a sudden he looks
[1:17:56] down and there's a little black spot.
[1:18:02] There it was.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:06] And I wonder if he looked at Bug Bud and
[1:18:08] says,
[1:18:10] "Take
[1:18:12] that."
[1:18:14] Hallelujah. So he he saw that grizzly
[1:18:17] where there was none before.
[1:18:19] I held that check in my hand where there
[1:18:22] was no money before. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; I received health
[1:18:28] when the devil tried to take me with
[1:18:30] those blood clots
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; where there wasn't health before.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:37] My family's been healed.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; You've been healed
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; where there was no health before.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so God, Brother Bram says, God
[1:18:47] likes to work in the realms of the
[1:18:49] impossible.
[1:18:53] You say, "Well, brother, give me
[1:18:54] example." Old and New Testament, both.
[1:18:58] He loves giving babies to barren women
[1:19:01] or old women. That's
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Bam. Right there.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; He likes to use the impossible. And so
[1:19:14] this cosmos wants to keep our eyes on
[1:19:18] what it says about every part. What does
[1:19:21] what does fox say about us?
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:34] What is and I I I don't get all the
[1:19:38] message people. Oh, he has a he has a
[1:19:42] new group, an office for of faith
[1:19:46] uh run by a woman who divorced her
[1:19:49] husband and slept with Benny Hinn.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Boy, that's a good leader in every
[1:19:56] position almost as a woman.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; It's like I don't see why people get so
[1:20:01] excited about Trump even though he does
[1:20:03] do some things that we like, but we
[1:20:06] shouldn't be excited about any of that.
[1:20:09] We should be excited that Jesus Christ
[1:20:12] is come.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. In your flesh. Praise the Lord
[1:20:17] Jesus. And so it it it's it God looks
[1:20:21] and says, "No matter what the
[1:20:23] circumstances, I've got my eye on you.
[1:20:26] No matter if you're lonely, no matter if
[1:20:29] you're sick, I got my eye on you. And
[1:20:31] I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake
[1:20:33] you." Amen. And so he he brings things
[1:20:36] once in a while to show you that he
[1:20:39] never will leave you nor forsake you.
[1:20:41] And so I want to ask you tonight,
[1:20:44] who gives you your daily benefits?
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; So why are you fooling around with the
[1:20:53] devil?
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Why are we fooling around with unbelief?
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; It's God that gives our a daily loads us
[1:20:59] with benefits. Amen. And and that's who
[1:21:02] we trust. That's who we love. That's
[1:21:04] what we want. And so Christ is bringing
[1:21:07] his word today cuz we've turned the
[1:21:09] corner through a womb of a true believer
[1:21:12] in him. He was not contaminated with
[1:21:16] your own thoughts of some one of the
[1:21:18] hundred different
[1:21:22] theories on the message.
[1:21:26] You have all things are possible to him
[1:21:29] that believed. tonight. You have his
[1:21:31] word. And so his word cannot be formed
[1:21:34] in a heart that it's hybrid with these
[1:21:36] other things. Well, brother, my pastor
[1:21:38] does this and he says it's all right.
[1:21:40] And I'm thinking, I don't care.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:45] Hallelujah. He doesn't want your
[1:21:48] condition to be man-made.
[1:21:51] Hallelujah. He wants to form himself in
[1:21:54] you through the purity of a clear womb.
[1:21:58] Amen. He wants us our thoughts in the
[1:22:01] morning to be of his word. Our thoughts
[1:22:03] at night to be of his word. Our speech
[1:22:06] when somebody when it when a deer rams
[1:22:09] your car.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; That happened to me. I don't know within
[1:22:15] the last year. So I couldn't drive.
[1:22:19] Parked it on the side. Got my bag. I was
[1:22:22] on the way to preach. Started walking.
[1:22:25] Here's this guy in a suit with his
[1:22:26] messenger bag. The guy comes by and
[1:22:29] says, "Hey, do you need a ride?" Said,
[1:22:31] "Yeah." He goes, "Are you going to kill
[1:22:33] me?" I said, "Nope."
[1:22:38] And then we got there and a visitor was
[1:22:40] there. And that visitor afterwards came
[1:22:42] up and gave me a Pentecostal handshake
[1:22:44] with a lot of money to help pay for that
[1:22:47] damage,
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; not even asking.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:55] We serve a miracle God.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:23:01] his pure word goes in a pure heart of
[1:23:03] faith.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I struggle. I make so
[1:23:06] many mistakes. I'm sorry. I don't want
[1:23:09] to hear him.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; God doesn't want to hear you. But God,
[1:23:14] how would you like your wife to But
[1:23:16] husband, I've been watching soap propos
[1:23:19] all day long and I haven't done
[1:23:21] anything.
[1:23:24] No, you don't want to hear that. You
[1:23:27] want to hear them them, you know, he
[1:23:30] wants to hear us say, "Lord, I've
[1:23:32] stumbled and I fell." He goes, "Yeah, I
[1:23:33] know." He goes, "But you got back up and
[1:23:36] repented." Because the bride of Christ
[1:23:38] will be seen as someone who's full of
[1:23:41] mistakes.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. She's not walking around
[1:23:44] invincible in that way. She is
[1:23:47] invincible by her husband on the inside.
[1:23:49] But we must get past the fact that we're
[1:23:51] going to make mistakes. Amen. But the
[1:23:53] desire has changed. So you get back up
[1:23:56] and you confess and you go forward. And
[1:23:58] so you and I, we punctuate every word of
[1:24:02] God with the amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything in this Bible,
[1:24:06] praise the Lord, we can say amen to
[1:24:09] that. And so all that she knows is what
[1:24:14] the word's telling her. And so people
[1:24:15] go, "Well, don't you think, you know,
[1:24:19] don't you think there's a better way
[1:24:20] than what you're being taught here at
[1:24:22] BCF?"
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. It It's all here,
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; I I can't listen to you. Someone wanted
[1:24:33] me to receive a a false apostle in the
[1:24:36] message. And and I told the person, I
[1:24:40] said, "I can't I can't get past these
[1:24:42] three little words,
[1:24:45] husband
[1:24:47] of one wife."
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; I can't get past that.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; In just that spirit infuriated that
[1:24:58] person.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; It's like, I'm sorry. I I got I got
[1:25:01] those words. I can't get past.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what the word says.
[1:25:06] So let's live by what he says. Amen.
[1:25:09] Look at the first church was molded by
[1:25:11] the word and the last church must be
[1:25:14] molded by the word of God alone. We are
[1:25:17] the same material. Amen.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so we are maturing into
[1:25:24] a faith with the same thoughts that
[1:25:27] Jesus Christ had with the father.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are Mrs. Jesus Christ. You are
[1:25:33] a little Messiah because you have the
[1:25:36] thoughts of God in you. And it's the
[1:25:39] same as Jesus had the thoughts of the
[1:25:42] father in him.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just about done. Luke
[1:25:48] 1:36-38.
[1:25:52] And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth,
[1:25:55] she hath also conceived a son in her old
[1:25:57] age. And this is the six months with
[1:25:59] her, who was called barren. For with God
[1:26:03] nothing is impossible.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; And Mary, she goes, "Yeah, that's right.
[1:26:10] Behold the handmade of the Lord." That's
[1:26:12] me. Amen. Be it unto me according to the
[1:26:16] word. And the angel departed. Praise the
[1:26:19] Lord. That is you and I today. You're
[1:26:22] saying, "Yeah, that's right.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to the word. I'm
[1:26:27] nothing. I've ne I never will be, but I
[1:26:30] know what the word of God says."
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; And so the word again has become flesh.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus walking in you tonight.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:48] That that scares people. But he's in
[1:26:50] you.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; He's walking in flesh amongst the the
[1:26:54] message community. And that's why the
[1:26:56] message community doesn't like the bride
[1:26:59] of Christ.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, you're such a pessimist.
[1:27:06] Okay. Right. That's scripture.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's in flesh again. You
[1:27:16] tonight. That's you.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I don't feel like it. Oh,
[1:27:22] welcome to the club, right?
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; How many of us ministers get up and it's
[1:27:27] like, man, I don't even feel saved
[1:27:29] today.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said?
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Feel
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; saved.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; But on the inside,
[1:27:42] one of them.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; One of them. Right. So you say, "Satan,
[1:27:47] don't take that as a nod to you." Amen.
[1:27:50] I'm just saying my body doesn't feel
[1:27:52] saved today, but I know that I am.
[1:27:54] Praise the Lord. And so that that flesh
[1:27:58] is becoming visible to those around you
[1:28:00] at school and at work, to your spouse.
[1:28:03] And so the word cannot produce itself in
[1:28:06] a womb that's polluted. That's why a
[1:28:08] denominational birth is a denominational
[1:28:11] birth, whether it's in message community
[1:28:13] or not. But the birth of Jesus Christ in
[1:28:16] you, that's the real birth. Amen. That's
[1:28:19] what changes you. Whatever you do in
[1:28:22] that altar, Amen. And and you confess
[1:28:24] that you have the Holy Ghost, then from
[1:28:26] that time on, you are changing. You
[1:28:28] don't go back home and you have about a
[1:28:30] week feeling good and then you're like,
[1:28:35] "No." Amen. You're just growing and
[1:28:38] you're stumbling
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; and you're saying, "Oh Lord, I'm sorry,
[1:28:41] but I'm getting back up. Praise the Lord
[1:28:43] Jesus.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; And so I if a person is born again and
[1:28:48] made alive through the faith of Jesus
[1:28:50] Christ in his word
[1:28:54] and you have that life on the inside,
[1:28:58] how can you be dead?
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; You can't. And let's go a step further.
[1:29:02] Brother Ram says, "How much more can a
[1:29:07] living person in Christ be able to have
[1:29:10] faith
[1:29:13] for a sickness?"
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; But but what happens? We're like, we see
[1:29:18] the healing or the miracle up here, but
[1:29:22] God wants us to see it.
[1:29:25] Oh, it it's part of my package.
[1:29:28] In the name of Jesus Christ, the son of
[1:29:30] God, I receive it to myself.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't Don't It's you that
[1:29:39] has dominion because of him in you. It's
[1:29:41] the devil who's who's sewn into the
[1:29:43] bottom of your shoe. Amen. Praise the
[1:29:46] Lord. And so the life of a true
[1:29:48] believer, that's your credentials, not
[1:29:50] what church you go to, not how many
[1:29:53] quotes you can quote off the top of your
[1:29:55] head. The devil knows those. Amen.
[1:29:58] Hallelujah. But it's your life that's
[1:30:00] your credentials. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:30:04] It was the life that was brother
[1:30:05] Brandham's credentials. Praise the Lord.
[1:30:08] And so for the believer, there are there
[1:30:11] are times when we got to tell God, Lord,
[1:30:13] I believe.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Help my unbelief.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; We have to.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Help my unbelief. I know what I
[1:30:22] want.
[1:30:25] And you know, we want to understand
[1:30:27] what's God's saying, but we can ask for
[1:30:29] wisdom and leadership
[1:30:31] for what he's trying to say to us.
[1:30:34] Hallelujah.
[1:30:36] And when you've got the spirit of the
[1:30:38] Lord in you to believe for your own
[1:30:39] salvation, place that upon your family.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; That is thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Acts 2:39 is thus sayeth the Lord to you
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; as a parent. And I can tell you
[1:30:53] absolutely it works.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; You got quiet.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; And you're thinking, "Well, brother, you
[1:31:01] don't know my kids."
[1:31:03] No, I don't.
[1:31:06] Can they sin so far that God can't save
[1:31:09] him?
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; No. Acts 2:39.
[1:31:16] Say, "I claim them in the name of Jesus
[1:31:18] Christ. I claim it, God. I know how
[1:31:22] you're going to make her do it and how
[1:31:26] you're going to make him do it.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; But I believe it. I believe it, Lord.
[1:31:31] Help my unbelief. Claim it and watch
[1:31:34] what happens. It'll do it. Amen.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need of, it'll do it.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And it'll happen in his
[1:31:42] time
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; and his season.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians can come.
[1:31:48] And so,
[1:31:51] how do you know it will happen? By
[1:31:54] faith.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; I don't judge it by my flesh, by my
[1:31:57] thoughts, by emotions.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; I judge it by the word.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; That's how we know that will happen
[1:32:05] because my husband said it.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; And so, he wants us to be virgin to the
[1:32:11] word. He doesn't want anybody's ideas in
[1:32:13] our head. He He doesn't want us looking
[1:32:15] for the latest greatest message craze.
[1:32:18] I've lived long enough to where that
[1:32:20] that never works out
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; because it's it's this herd mentality.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says that's the sign of the
[1:32:36] end.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; People don't know who their pastor is.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; But God will grow the word in a virgin
[1:32:44] womb
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; to the manifestation of Jesus Christ
[1:32:50] today. My God today will save your
[1:32:54] children. My God today will heal your
[1:32:57] bodies.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; He will take away all sorts of
[1:33:00] perversion from your life.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Too late. I've already seen it all.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; We We've already seen it done. Too late.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil can't hold you. Brother
[1:33:10] Brandham said, Brother Chad, Brother
[1:33:12] Bram said that
[1:33:14] they were asking him about the maniac in
[1:33:16] Portland and he said they, you know, we
[1:33:20] know that part. They said, "Is he
[1:33:22] healed?" He goes, "No."
[1:33:25] He goes, "No,
[1:33:26] he he worships that demon
[1:33:31] and he believes he's right.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; He believes he's right.
[1:33:42] I I had to come to the point where I'm
[1:33:46] no longer right, Lord.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; I'm Amen.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; I'm helpless without you.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; And so when when God saved me, that's
[1:33:55] why I said I said, "Lord,
[1:33:58] let me come to your word."
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; And don't let me follow what my message
[1:34:03] friends say I have to do.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Guess what he did? He He brought us to
[1:34:09] the to the word.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's never left you.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; He's always around you. He loves you so
[1:34:17] much. Uh if you read the Bible enough,
[1:34:20] Jesus wanted no one to perish.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. That's the truth.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; But people choose to.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; And in the Old Testament, God goes,
[1:34:30] "Choose life." Yeah.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; So tonight, let's choose the life of the
[1:34:34] word
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; and walk in the light as he is in the
[1:34:37] light. Brother,
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, Lord, Lord,
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; let's all stand.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; You surely been good to me.
[1:34:52] Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good
[1:34:56] to me.
[1:34:58] Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been
[1:35:01] good to me. You have done what this
[1:35:05] world could not do.
[1:35:08] Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been
[1:35:13] good to me.
[1:35:15] Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good
[1:35:19] to me.
[1:35:21] Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good
[1:35:24] to me. You have done what this world
[1:35:28] could not do.
[1:35:30] [Applause]
[1:35:31] You healed my body when I was sick. You
[1:35:34] surely been good to me. You healed my
[1:35:38] body when I was sick. You surely been
[1:35:41] good to me. You've healed my body when I
[1:35:45] was sick. You surely been good to me.
[1:35:48] You have done what this world could not
[1:35:51] do.
[1:35:53] Oh, you saved my soul when I was lost.
[1:35:56] You surely been good to me. You saved my
[1:36:00] soul when I was lost. You surely been
[1:36:03] good to me. You saved my soul when I was
[1:36:07] lost. You surely been good to me. You
[1:36:10] have done what this world could not do.
[1:36:16] You filled me with the Holy Ghost. You
[1:36:19] surely been good to me.
[1:36:21] You filled me with the Holy Ghost. You
[1:36:24] surely been good to me. You filled me
[1:36:28] with the Holy Ghost. You surely been
[1:36:31] good to me. You have done what this
[1:36:34] world could not do.
[1:36:38] Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been
[1:36:42] good to me.
[1:36:44] Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good
[1:36:48] to me.
[1:36:50] Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good
[1:36:53] to me. You have done what this world
[1:36:57] cannot do.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Is his word true?
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it always true? Amen. For will
[1:37:07] it always be true? Amen. I love the fact
[1:37:11] that brother Brandham told us that when
[1:37:14] Jesus was being tempted in the
[1:37:16] wilderness face to face like brother
[1:37:17] Rich was saying he didn't use any of his
[1:37:20] gifts, he didn't use any of his powers.
[1:37:22] He didn't use any of his abilities. He
[1:37:24] used one thing to defeat the devil and
[1:37:26] that's the word.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Showing that the weakest Christian
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; could take the word of God and defeat
[1:37:32] the devil. Brother said anywhere under
[1:37:36] any condition at any time.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:40] Amen. If you feel like the weakest
[1:37:41] Christian, praise God, you've got
[1:37:43] something that will defeat the devil
[1:37:44] every time. You don't have to feel like
[1:37:46] the strongest Christian for this to
[1:37:48] work. You can feel like the weakest and
[1:37:50] it'll still work.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; How many appreciate the encouragement to
[1:37:54] believe.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, listen. Life is real. We live in a
[1:37:58] human flesh with a human spirit. We get
[1:38:00] knocked down, beat down. It's not that
[1:38:02] we don't believe, but we get bombarded.
[1:38:04] And we need somebody to bring us back to
[1:38:06] the reality. Amen.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Because what we see is reality is not
[1:38:09] reality. That's the vapor. That's the
[1:38:11] myth. But we got to come back to the
[1:38:12] reality which is the word of God.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; That'll never fade away.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; So I appreciate I appreciate a man who
[1:38:19] will bring us back to the realization
[1:38:21] that the word can't fail.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Everything else will fade away, but the
[1:38:27] word cannot fail. That's right. I was
[1:38:30] reading through the book of Hebrews and
[1:38:32] it talked about all the what we call the
[1:38:35] heroes of the faith.
[1:38:37] And it says, "By faith they obtained a
[1:38:40] good report."
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Listen, not by their deeds
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; because they all had bad deeds.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Do you want to go through the list in
[1:38:48] Hebrews? You want to start mentioning
[1:38:50] all their bad deeds? They all had bad
[1:38:52] deeds. What gave them a good report?
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; They believed the word.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; They all had mistakes. They all had
[1:38:58] failures. And they got tossed about. And
[1:39:00] they they even got confused on the
[1:39:02] promise. Abraham even got confused on
[1:39:05] the promise. and listened to Sarah and
[1:39:06] tried to produce it in his own strength.
[1:39:08] And
[1:39:10] but the Bible says
[1:39:13] he grew strong in faith.
[1:39:16] Never doubted the word. There was
[1:39:17] something in him that couldn't doubt the
[1:39:19] word. His mind could get confused. His
[1:39:21] flesh could get confused. But there was
[1:39:23] something that would hold on for 25
[1:39:25] years until the promise came to pass.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God. There's something in us
[1:39:29] that wants to keep holding on to this
[1:39:31] word.
[1:39:32] And I want to obtain a good report by
[1:39:34] faith.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Because listen, I don't want to I don't
[1:39:37] want you to judge my natural report
[1:39:39] because it's got some bad grades.
[1:39:43] But they all obtained a good report by
[1:39:46] faith. Faith in what? Faith in the word
[1:39:48] of God.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Say, "God, help us to come back to what
[1:39:53] really matters more than anything. How I
[1:39:55] feel is not what really matters. What I
[1:39:57] see is not what really matters. What
[1:39:59] really matters is what you said and
[1:40:03] let's stay with that. Amen. I think
[1:40:05] we'll find as brother Rich was saying
[1:40:08] that our trials end up being the
[1:40:10] greatest times in our lives.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Not during the trial but afterward when
[1:40:15] we see the word works
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; and it becomes a mile mark or a post a a
[1:40:20] a pillar that we can look back to and
[1:40:23] say, you know what, I'm in trouble now,
[1:40:24] but I've already seen the word work
[1:40:26] here. Yes, sir.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Rich was showing us
[1:40:29] in his own life. Amen. We may not we may
[1:40:31] not understand what's happening. We may
[1:40:33] be confused or beat down a little bit
[1:40:35] and under some strain and and maybe
[1:40:37] maybe feeling a lot of different things,
[1:40:39] but praise God, the word has worked in
[1:40:42] mile one and mile two and mile three.
[1:40:44] And we got all these markers that
[1:40:45] brought us this far and it's not going
[1:40:47] to fail now. Amen.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; And some of those things that we hated
[1:40:51] the most become the things that are our
[1:40:54] greatest testimonies now that we share
[1:40:55] with others to encourage them when
[1:40:57] they're down.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; The thing we didn't want to go through
[1:40:59] and the thing we didn't want to suffer
[1:41:01] with and the thing we wish would have
[1:41:02] went away in 5 minutes but lingered for
[1:41:04] years. Now when the word comes on the
[1:41:07] scene and brings about the promise, we
[1:41:09] look back and say, "Let me tell you a
[1:41:11] story
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; about how the word works and how great
[1:41:14] God is and how he's promised the word
[1:41:16] and he'll keep it." Yes, sir.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love preaching of encouraging
[1:41:20] faith. If there's anything we need more,
[1:41:22] we need to hold on by faith to the word
[1:41:24] of God.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all this evening. I
[1:41:30] was happy to be in church.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going out encouraged to believe.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; And all of our situations are different,
[1:41:38] but we all got situations. But how
[1:41:40] many's encouraged to go forth and
[1:41:42] believe,
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; to hold on to that word and keep
[1:41:44] reminding God that I still believe that?
[1:41:47] Yes, sir.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for the fulfillment, but I
[1:41:49] just want to remind you, God, I still
[1:41:50] believe it,
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; but I'm waiting with expectation.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together as
[1:41:56] we're dismissed. Lord Jesus.
[1:41:59] God, I thank you for the inspiration
[1:42:01] that you sent to encourage us. God, back
[1:42:05] to the simplest of simplest, the
[1:42:07] fundamental of a believer, and that's to
[1:42:10] believe.
[1:42:12] God, we're not always good workers.
[1:42:16] That's why you didn't call us workers
[1:42:19] because we fail at being workers. You
[1:42:22] call us believers
[1:42:24] because that's what you're looking for
[1:42:25] is someone who will believe.
[1:42:27] And God, you're so gracious that you
[1:42:29] didn't expect us to believe with our
[1:42:31] minds because we have fallen minds, with
[1:42:34] our willpower, because everything in us
[1:42:36] is corrupt.
[1:42:38] But before the foundation of the world,
[1:42:40] you placed a seed gene of faith on the
[1:42:41] inside. Something that we could believe
[1:42:44] with some part of yourself that was
[1:42:47] imparted to us that could respond to the
[1:42:49] word, that could believe it, that could
[1:42:51] hold on. When my mind can't hold on and
[1:42:53] my fingers can't, my will can't hold on.
[1:42:56] You've placed something deep within our
[1:42:58] soul that can hold on to the word,
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; God. and help us to focus on that and
[1:43:03] move past the mind and move past the
[1:43:05] flesh and move beyond our ability till
[1:43:08] we strike that core of our soul and we
[1:43:10] find there a believer
[1:43:13] a believer that can say be it unto me
[1:43:17] according to your word God you're so
[1:43:20] gracious you're so kind to give us of
[1:43:22] yourselves God and you're so good to
[1:43:25] remind us of what matters most and
[1:43:27] you're so kind to remind us of what
[1:43:29] always works
[1:43:31] And God, may we walk out of here
[1:43:33] encouraged to believe to come back to
[1:43:35] the simplicity of just being a believer
[1:43:38] in the simple word. The devil wants
[1:43:41] everything to be complicated, but Lord,
[1:43:43] you've brought us back to the simplicity
[1:43:45] of being a believer. God, let us go
[1:43:48] forth as believers in your word. We love
[1:43:51] you. We ask that you would bless our
[1:43:53] brother Rich. That you would strengthen
[1:43:54] him. Encourage him, Lord. Pour back into
[1:43:58] him as you've used him to pour unto us.
[1:44:00] May you strengthen him and pour more of
[1:44:02] yourself into our brother. And may you
[1:44:05] give him, Lord, what he's dished out
[1:44:06] today. Give him faith and strength and
[1:44:09] encouragement. May he receive it, Lord,
[1:44:12] himself. That he could go back home,
[1:44:14] Lord, when it's time to go back home
[1:44:16] encouraged to keep believing there. And
[1:44:19] God, that you'll use him mightily
[1:44:20] wherever he goes. Bless us as we part.
[1:44:24] Lord, we walk in your grace. And God, we
[1:44:27] we walk by faith and that not of
[1:44:29] ourselves. It is a gift from you. God,
[1:44:33] thank you. We ask for your blessings
[1:44:34] over everyone as we go. Keep us safe
[1:44:36] along the way. And let our light shine
[1:44:39] in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:44:44] May God bless you all. It's so good to
[1:44:45] see you to worship together to say amen
[1:44:48] to the word together. Does my heart
[1:44:51] good. God bless you all this evening.
[1:44:53] Brother Riley
[1:45:02] Jesus Christ today
[1:45:06] all circumstances
[1:45:08] will be gone. The word of God will still
[1:45:13] remain. No sickness, fear, no guilt or
[1:45:18] strike can have control and worry me.
[1:45:23] The keys of faith are in my hands and I
[1:45:28] am bound for victory.
[1:45:33] I am free.
[1:45:36] My new day has come.
[1:45:41] Now I can be who I truly am.
[1:45:50] I am free.
[1:45:53] Covered by his blood.
[1:45:58] All things
[1:46:01] are possible with God.
[1:46:07] All things
[1:46:10] are possible in God.
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:16] A great commission from my Lord.
[1:46:21] I have now received
[1:46:25] the prince of power of the air will
[1:46:30] never have a part in me as amateur
[1:46:36] creator. I can change the atmosphere
[1:46:41] around. I use the chain of circumstance
[1:46:46] for any spirits to be bound.
[1:46:52] I am free.
[1:46:55] My new day has come.
[1:47:01] Now I can be who I truly am.
[1:47:09] I am free.
[1:47:13] Covered by his blood.
[1:47:18] All things
[1:47:21] are possible
[1:47:23] with God.
[1:47:27] All things
[1:47:30] are possible with God.
[1:47:34] [Music]
[1:47:35] Oh, I know that Jesus the I am
[1:47:41] is the same today.
[1:47:45] The prophet came to show the life. The
[1:47:49] bride must have it on display. The hour
[1:47:54] has come for Christ in us to be
[1:47:59] completely glorified.
[1:48:02] I want the spirit to be free to do the
[1:48:08] greater works in me.
[1:48:12] I am free.
[1:48:16] My new day has come.
[1:48:21] Now I can be who I truly am.
[1:48:29] I am free.
[1:48:33] Covered by his blood.

[1:48:41] are possible with God.
[1:48:44] [Applause]
[1:48:47] All things
[1:48:50] are possible with God. Sing that one
[1:48:53] more time.
[1:48:55] Oh, I am free.
[1:48:59] My new day has come.
[1:49:04] Now I can be who I truly am.
[1:49:13] I am free.
[1:49:16] Covered by his blood.
[1:49:21] All things
