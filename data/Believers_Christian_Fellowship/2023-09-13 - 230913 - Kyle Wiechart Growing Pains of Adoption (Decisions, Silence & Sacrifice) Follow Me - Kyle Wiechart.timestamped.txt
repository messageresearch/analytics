[10:48] thee just bow our heads for a word of
[10:51] Prayer
[10:53] most gracious Heavenly Father we're so
[10:55] thankful Lord that thou has given us
[10:57] this evening Lord by your grace you
[10:59] assembled us this evening father we
[11:01] counted an honor Lord to be able to come
[11:03] into a place Lord that you've set aside
[11:05] and Sanctified come to amongst the
[11:08] people Lord that you've set apart and
[11:10] Sanctified and called unto yourself and
[11:13] hear a present tense truth Lord that can
[11:15] transform us from the creatures that we
[11:17] were unto Sons and Daughters of God
[11:19] living as New Creations in Christ Jesus
[11:22] father God it's just a tremendous honor
[11:25] and a privilege and we thank you from
[11:26] the depths of our heart and from our
[11:28] soul and so father God lord we come
[11:30] yielding ourselves to you as a people
[11:33] that are here to hear the word I myself
[11:35] include him and speaking but I'm
[11:37] listening to father to what your spirit
[11:39] would say to me Lord the whole objective
[11:43] Lord is to draw one step closer to you
[11:45] father the objective of every teaching
[11:48] every preaching everything we do is in
[11:50] an effort that we ourselves and those
[11:52] that we minister to can draw closer into
[11:55] your presence father that's the
[11:57] objective of my heart I believe that's
[11:58] the objective of everyone that's come
[12:00] tonight not to be seen not to do a
[12:02] religious duty but father God to hear
[12:05] your word and draw closer to thee father
[12:08] anoint our faith it's in our hearts as
[12:10] the word comes forth may we mix that
[12:12] word with the faith that you placed
[12:14] inside of us and may it become a living
[12:16] reality that we express to the rest of
[12:18] the world we love you we commit this
[12:20] time into your hands in Jesus name amen
[12:24] amen God bless you I think you all heard
[12:27] what I heard
[12:28] amen
[12:30] I almost wanted to stop and say he's
[12:32] here
[12:33] God bless you brother Emmanuel man we're
[12:36] all happy to have you here my my
[12:40] looking forward to Wednesday you get a
[12:42] lot of sleep and then plan on being here
[12:44] for hours upon hours brother we're
[12:46] looking forward to
[12:49] thank you musicians
[12:52] will it fall off my lot to be on this
[12:54] side of the pulpit today so you pray for
[12:56] me if you don't mind let's tell them
[12:57] brother Chad it never fails I always
[12:59] have a really bad day before I Minister
[13:01] and I don't sleep so that's just par for
[13:04] the course I guess it just keeps me weak
[13:06] and dependent and maybe that's always
[13:07] the way he wanted it to be so there's a
[13:09] purpose behind all those things
[13:11] and so if you don't mind I'll have you
[13:13] turn right to the scriptures here
[13:16] two portions of scripture here in the
[13:18] Philippians and in First Corinthians but
[13:20] we'll start in Philippians chapters 2.
[13:23] verse 3.
[13:25] chapters 2 verse 3 Philippians
[13:31] and just say Amen when you get there
[13:34] amen
[13:36] the scripture reads let nothing be done
[13:39] through Strife or vain Glory but in
[13:42] lowliness of Mind Let each esteem other
[13:45] better than themselves look not every
[13:49] man on his own things but every man also
[13:52] on the things of others let this mind be
[13:56] in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[13:59] who being in the form of God thought it
[14:02] not robbery to be equal with God but
[14:05] made himself of no reputation and took
[14:09] upon him the form of a servant and was
[14:12] made in the likeness of men and being
[14:14] found in the fashion as a man he humbled
[14:17] himself and became obedient unto death
[14:19] even the death of the cross
[14:23] the next scripture if you don't mind the
[14:25] short portion and
[14:27] um
[14:28] oh I'm sorry it's Luke I changed it I'm
[14:31] sorry I changed it last minute
[14:33] I am never comfortable with my notes all
[14:36] the way up to when I step into the
[14:37] pulpit
[14:38] and so I felt to change that
[14:41] Luke 9 23
[14:46] oh
[14:47] if you only knew how dependent I am
[14:51] Luke 9 23.
[14:54] and he said unto them all if any man
[14:56] will come after me let him deny himself
[14:58] take up his cross daily and follow me
[15:01] for whosoever will save his life will
[15:03] lose it but whosoever shall lose his
[15:05] life for my sake shall save it amen may
[15:09] God add His blessings to the reading of
[15:11] his word he may be seated
[15:16] so
[15:17] I have a lot of notes and I'm nervous
[15:19] because it's a Wednesday night and so I
[15:22] hope I can have Grace in your sight
[15:23] because I'm I already you can tell I'm
[15:25] slow I'm tired so I'm talking slow and
[15:27] then I look at all these notes and I'm
[15:28] like wow how are we going to get through
[15:30] all this but I just believe that God has
[15:32] a way of doing things and there's a
[15:34] reason why I mess up my scriptures and I
[15:36] change things around and he doesn't let
[15:38] me get sleep at night and maybe he just
[15:39] needs me to rest and calm down a little
[15:41] bit and so sometimes he allows those
[15:43] things to happen I have a thing I'd like
[15:46] to speak on tonight and um I'm it's hard
[15:49] for me to even say this I think I'm
[15:51] starting a series
[15:53] can I say that like you don't see how
[15:56] much you're laughing like me say series
[15:58] is like that's an oxymoron but I think
[16:01] I've I'm technically going to be
[16:03] preaching a third part to adoption and
[16:06] uh which is really hard for me to say
[16:09] um and so I I have this and I just
[16:12] handed it on to brother uh Franco I says
[16:14] you do what you want with this title but
[16:16] my title is The Growing Pains of
[16:19] adoption
[16:21] and as a first subtitle
[16:24] decisions silence and sacrifice
[16:29] and as for a text or a subtitle to my
[16:31] subtitle
[16:33] follow me
[16:36] and so as you all know for the last few
[16:39] months I've just been stuck on adoption
[16:42] and
[16:43] I had ministered a first time on this
[16:45] about three months ago to the youth and
[16:48] so for tonight this will be a third part
[16:51] but for you all here the older youth
[16:53] this is the second part for the last
[16:55] time I was here I preached on into the
[16:57] Silence of adoption
[16:59] the first time I preached then I I
[17:02] ministered to the youth and I brought
[17:03] the adoption of sons and I I titled that
[17:06] one your time of decision adoption of
[17:08] sons your time of decision because I
[17:10] began to see there's a decision that
[17:12] becomes very clear
[17:14] um a harder way a choice that one makes
[17:17] to continue on into the pathway of
[17:19] adoption
[17:20] but then when I was out in Oregon this
[17:23] last couple weeks ago I noticed
[17:25] something about the third step and that
[17:26] was the sacrifice of the individual
[17:29] and so that's why I've got this Growing
[17:32] Pains of adoption because I've seen a
[17:34] pattern and the pattern this decision
[17:36] leads to silence which leads to a
[17:38] sacrifice
[17:40] and I'd like to go through that with you
[17:42] if you don't mind and for me it's helped
[17:45] me a lot to actually identify where I'm
[17:47] at in life you know we came up we all
[17:50] grew we all Never Enough none of us came
[17:52] to Christ as a mature Christian we're
[17:55] all been growing and we learn obedience
[17:58] through suffering and many times we
[18:01] suffer by the mistakes that we ourselves
[18:03] make and we suffer um because we do
[18:07] things wrong
[18:08] and oftentimes it's not anybody doing
[18:11] anything to us we've reacted wrong we
[18:13] interpret something wrong and it was
[18:16] supposed to be there for a purpose it
[18:18] was supposed to mold us and shape us and
[18:19] make us something mature us as sons and
[18:22] daughters and oftentimes we just react
[18:24] incorrectly I know I have and brother
[18:26] Gabe at least I'm not the only one right
[18:28] amen makes me feel better I ain't the
[18:30] only one make big mistakes and the
[18:32] reality of it is sometimes we just we
[18:35] just um we just need to grow up
[18:38] it's hard to sound just to be honest
[18:40] with you right the sister got broke grow
[18:41] up I gotta grow up
[18:43] and so as I was looking at these um
[18:45] decisions when I when I brought it to
[18:47] the youth the first portion there
[18:50] um it became very clear to me that as we
[18:52] come into adoption we we come to some
[18:54] tough decisions and we have to suffer
[18:56] many times with the decisions we make
[18:58] and many times we want God we're like
[19:01] hey Lord um where are you at in this
[19:03] situation and he's like well you made
[19:04] your own decision
[19:06] and you want God to deliver you from a
[19:08] bad decision that you make and it's such
[19:11] a unique situ situation because you come
[19:13] to find out you're making many decisions
[19:15] because of your own will
[19:17] your will wasn't his will you made your
[19:19] own decisions and it wasn't his decision
[19:22] for you and then you suffer the
[19:24] consequences of your bad decision
[19:25] because you didn't wait to hear God
[19:28] many times a person would say I'm having
[19:30] marriage problems I don't know did you
[19:31] marry the one that God wanted you to
[19:33] marry there's so many times like Lord
[19:35] why don't you intervene did you pray
[19:36] about your marriage before you got
[19:38] married did you just look for a pretty
[19:39] face and a pretty figure or were you
[19:41] care were you looking for character or
[19:42] something on the inside well God come
[19:44] save me in my marriage you made a bad
[19:46] decision
[19:48] I don't mean to be you know Lord come
[19:51] and fix my job replace my boss he's
[19:52] horrible did you pray about it
[19:55] or did you just get a bigger paycheck
[19:57] and took the job
[19:59] you know what I'm saying I'm just
[20:01] talking to you real plain to live just
[20:02] bring it down to reality for a second
[20:04] many times we want God to Deliver Us
[20:06] from the bad decisions we make
[20:09] because you weren't doing you weren't
[20:11] about the father's business you were
[20:13] about your own business and then God
[20:15] stands back it's like now you want my
[20:17] help
[20:18] you certainly didn't invoke me in the
[20:19] beginning you certainly wasn't looking
[20:21] for my leadership in that decision you
[20:23] wanted to do your own thing you wanted
[20:25] an easier way yes
[20:28] and so
[20:30] but that's not my subject because I've
[20:33] moved on to a third part so sorry only
[20:35] the youth know that whole sermon on
[20:37] decisions
[20:39] and um
[20:40] I'd like to just read some basis here
[20:43] for foundation that's okay because if
[20:45] you weren't here I just want to lay some
[20:47] things out in this adoption process of
[20:49] sons because we're predestinated into
[20:51] the adoption of sons you know what I
[20:54] fail but he's predestinated me to come
[20:56] to this adoption I make big mistakes I
[20:59] don't get it right I don't see the
[21:00] picture at all the time but I'm
[21:02] predestinated I've been forwarding and
[21:04] elected to be conformed into the image
[21:06] of this dear son
[21:07] so even my mistakes will pave the way
[21:10] for that adoption
[21:11] and so brother Branham says in modern
[21:14] events May clear by prophecy
[21:16] he said the shuck held it but now the
[21:19] shuck pulls away it has to remember 20
[21:22] years has passed by and no more
[21:24] denominations has come out of it and it
[21:26] won't we're at the end of denominations
[21:29] the Wheats taking shape what's the
[21:32] matter with the wheat now it must lay in
[21:35] the presence of the sun to ripen before
[21:37] the combine picks it up
[21:40] amen and I believe that's what's going
[21:43] on I believe we're learning things now
[21:45] more intensely we're now checking
[21:47] motives and objectives and Leadership
[21:48] and why we make the decisions we're
[21:50] really seeing if we're about the
[21:52] father's business we're truly he's truly
[21:54] checking how you learn are you learning
[21:57] are you knowing when to be silent when
[21:59] I'm silent are you running going fast
[22:01] doing your will are you really
[22:03] considering my will in the situation
[22:05] because ultimately I know God wants
[22:08] Fellowship like at the end of the day
[22:10] God wants to be loved and God wants to
[22:12] restore fellowship with me yes and if he
[22:15] has to allow for this life to get really
[22:17] tough to restore Fellowship how many
[22:19] would say Amen
[22:21] that's okay
[22:22] because really what your soul what what
[22:25] are you craving what like like it was so
[22:27] interesting to me yesterday I was like
[22:29] it's always Bittersweet when I get asked
[22:31] to minister because this is the part
[22:33] that really scares me but I love the day
[22:35] before the night before the day the
[22:38] hours before I step into this place and
[22:41] I began to think about last night I'm
[22:42] like why do I love that so much like I
[22:44] love time with my girls I love time with
[22:47] my wife I love time and fellowship with
[22:49] you all but I'm telling you there is
[22:51] nothing more precious to me there's
[22:53] something that happens when I'm all by
[22:56] myself and I've pushed work away and
[22:59] I've pushed calls away and I I made an
[23:01] effort to just isolate myself from the
[23:04] whole world and the influences and the
[23:05] cares of life and consecrate myself to
[23:08] put myself in the position so that I can
[23:10] hear from God and go and say something
[23:12] that could help people and and to hear
[23:14] from myself to help me because I need to
[23:15] hear too and I know and the last time I
[23:18] think like oh I wish I could live like
[23:20] that every day and then struck me I'm
[23:22] like why don't I
[23:24] is that not allowed am I not allowed to
[23:28] live in a world all to myself like Jesus
[23:30] did where I keep everything at an arm's
[23:33] length distance I keep problem
[23:34] situations difficulties of this Natural
[23:36] Life out here so that I can maintain
[23:39] behind the veil closed in with him God
[23:42] like is that possible
[23:44] because the question the reality is it
[23:47] is brother Shea because why is that
[23:48] burning in my heart
[23:50] why is that a deep calling that I don't
[23:52] have to just feel his presence when I'm
[23:54] just preparing for a sermon why can't I
[23:56] feel that presence Monday Tuesday
[23:58] Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
[23:59] Sunday no matter what the problem what
[24:01] the situation I'm shut in
[24:04] and you know what I began to realize I
[24:06] made a conscious effort to push
[24:07] everything back and not let it come into
[24:10] this space that I have between him and
[24:13] me
[24:14] I I did something
[24:16] it's Unique for me I like I it it's like
[24:19] man Kyle you're slow you didn't realize
[24:21] I'm like yeah I didn't realize it guys I
[24:23] just realized it I made a conscious
[24:26] effort to set you could have called me
[24:27] yesterday and said your rental
[24:29] properties are all on fire and that's I
[24:31] don't care I have insurance
[24:33] it doesn't bother me
[24:35] all your employees they quit it's okay
[24:37] I'm just holding you all out there it's
[24:40] like don't bother me don't bother me I'm
[24:42] shut in I'm shut in I've got something I
[24:46] know I know every time I make an
[24:47] appointment with him he's there
[24:50] he's just there
[24:52] yes
[24:54] but we let we just let life just
[24:56] convince us that he can't be that close
[24:58] to us I don't believe that I don't
[25:02] believe that I believe brother Branham
[25:04] said I never preach in such a way to
[25:06] draw people to myself or that they
[25:08] should come to my church he said I have
[25:10] one objective and that is this one goal
[25:13] if I can achieve this one thing that is
[25:16] to restore a spiritual relationship
[25:18] between God and man where they can live
[25:21] as New Creations in Christ Jesus let of
[25:24] his Spirit walking according to his word
[25:25] that's his objective that was his
[25:28] objective I'll tell you what that's my
[25:30] desire
[25:31] and I believe that's the purpose he was
[25:33] sent for to restore me back into
[25:35] fellowship with God
[25:37] I don't have to live like the world
[25:39] lives I can live in the presence of God
[25:41] each and every day
[25:44] way far away from notes so can I read
[25:47] I'm I'm going to read I'm asking your
[25:49] permissions like well I'm going to read
[25:51] this portion
[25:53] Blasphemous names 1962.
[25:56] he says see a family when a son is born
[25:59] into it it's a son but that son had
[26:02] tutors to raise it and if that son never
[26:05] did come to be the right kind of a son
[26:06] he can never become an heir but if he
[26:09] was the right son and the son that would
[26:11] obey his father then that son will be
[26:13] adopted and placed positionally he's
[26:16] become now an heir of all that the
[26:18] father had and that's what God was doing
[26:21] on Mount Transfiguration when he took
[26:23] his own son after he had been proved to
[26:25] be the right son see he had stood all
[26:28] the Temptations and he took him here up
[26:30] on Mount Transfiguration and he
[26:32] overshadowed him dropping down one
[26:35] portion he says there is where the
[26:37] Pentecostal people have made their
[26:38] mistake being born into the family by
[26:41] the Holy Ghost that's right but then we
[26:43] must be made we must be the right kind
[26:46] of a child being tutored by the right
[26:48] tutor
[26:50] I'm under instruction you're under
[26:52] instruction the Holy Ghost wasn't just
[26:54] given to you just to give you a security
[26:57] the Holy Ghost was there to guide you to
[26:59] teach you like a student or like a
[27:01] teacher training a student he's gonna
[27:03] he's gonna teach you a lesson he's going
[27:06] to mold you and shape you and cut you
[27:08] let you make that decision let you take
[27:11] that job because you make more money but
[27:13] it takes you away from the church
[27:15] lets you move to a place that you no
[27:17] longer can have fellowship with with
[27:18] your family you can't no longer do
[27:20] family devotions you can't even get
[27:21] alone with God anymore he's going to let
[27:23] you make the decision
[27:24] go for opportunity and you know what
[27:27] many times
[27:28] you think God's in it because He blesses
[27:30] you in it
[27:31] you think God is in that because you're
[27:34] financially being blessed but your soul
[27:37] is being sacrificed so I want to ask you
[27:39] a question was that the will of God
[27:42] no amen then you cry out to God why are
[27:46] my children this way or why are my wife
[27:47] this way or why am I so cold and
[27:49] backslidden you made a decision of your
[27:52] own will that was contrary to the will
[27:54] of God now you want God to come fix your
[27:57] bad mistakes
[27:58] we're just learning everyone I'm guilty
[28:01] you're guilty everybody relax don't
[28:04] worry everybody's guilty calm down we're
[28:07] all human we make big mistakes that's
[28:10] the reality of it but God deals with us
[28:12] as Sons he's maturing us he's shaping us
[28:15] he's molding us he's making us into the
[28:18] thing that he had a picture of in the
[28:20] back of his mind he had a perfect
[28:21] picture of your Perfection and I'm
[28:23] coming to it and you're coming to it
[28:24] amen we just may come there a little
[28:26] slower at times but that's okay
[28:29] and so I want to continue on before we
[28:32] get into these decisions and silence and
[28:34] sacrifice because I saw those three
[28:36] patterns of an adopted son in Jesus I
[28:39] saw it in the Book of Joshua because
[28:41] Joshua parallels the book of Ephesians
[28:43] which is the adoption book I saw it also
[28:46] in the life of brother branna
[28:48] and I've also seen it in the bride
[28:51] and it's just the pattern so it's just a
[28:53] simple teaching but I want you to see
[28:55] the pattern maybe you'll find yourself
[28:56] in the process
[28:58] because I believe we're identified in
[29:01] Bible characters aren't we and that's
[29:02] why I've subtitled to my title was
[29:05] follow me
[29:06] he showed us the pathway that we're
[29:08] going to take brother Branham even
[29:10] showed us the pathway of an adopted son
[29:12] Jesus showed it to us Israel and them
[29:15] taking the promised land and being
[29:16] positionally placed in their promise and
[29:18] they showed it to you the whole thing
[29:20] was showing you what God was going to do
[29:22] with his bride
[29:24] so as the last time we came we realized
[29:26] there's redemption in the fourth stage
[29:28] you have justification which makes the
[29:30] way for sanctification which makes way
[29:31] for the baptism the Holy Spirit which
[29:33] makes way for the person of Jesus Christ
[29:35] himself to come and have preeminances in
[29:38] your life right that's the process that
[29:40] we're coming to we're not stopping
[29:42] anywhere along the journey amen amen
[29:45] okay I'm going all the way who's going
[29:47] all the way sorry I'm going to invoke
[29:48] you to come back and talk to me a little
[29:50] bit here they're a little too quiet for
[29:51] a second here so I'm going all the way
[29:54] okay we're going there so we knew that
[29:56] in justification was found in the book
[29:58] of Romans right and so being Romans it
[30:00] says you're justified by faith not by
[30:03] the Deeds of the law we moved on into
[30:05] Corinthians I'll go fast Corinthians
[30:07] being the sanctification book where he
[30:09] says in the uh the second verse of
[30:11] chapter one he says to them that are
[30:13] Sanctified in Christ Jesus we know it's
[30:15] a sanctification then we go on into
[30:17] Galatians we have the baptism of the
[30:18] Holy Spirit right he says oh foolish
[30:20] Galatians who's Bewitched you this one
[30:23] thing that I've learned have you
[30:24] received the Spirit by The Works of the
[30:25] law or by the hearing of Faith then we
[30:27] came up into Ephesians which we knew we
[30:29] were predestinating to the adoption of
[30:31] sons and then it came into Philippians
[30:34] and that's where my opening verse was
[30:36] because as you look into Philippians
[30:38] being that is the the fifth we'll say
[30:40] first one Romans second one uh
[30:44] Corinthians third Galatians fourth the
[30:47] book of adoption Ephesians the fifth one
[30:50] being Philippians and I had to correct
[30:52] myself I remembered when I actually said
[30:54] it here the last time I said look Grace
[30:55] but I said it when it came to Colossians
[30:58] it was in Philippians that's the fifth
[30:59] book
[31:01] f-a-i-t-h right
[31:04] n-j-e-s-u-s brings the very headship of
[31:07] Christ down and that's where we have our
[31:09] opening scripture let this mind be in
[31:12] you that was in Christ Jesus because
[31:14] when that cloud came down brother Benham
[31:16] said it was in the shape of a pyramid
[31:17] and what did it represent the very
[31:19] headship and mind of God was coming down
[31:21] we now have by God's grace a perfect
[31:23] interpretation of the word of God with
[31:25] Divine vindication
[31:27] we have it the headship and the
[31:29] leadership of almighty God the Holy
[31:31] Spirit anointing us with this Holy
[31:33] Spirit leading Us by his will and his
[31:35] word and so that's where Philippians
[31:37] comes into view and as I look in the
[31:39] Philippians this is where I noticed
[31:40] there's a decision
[31:42] then there's the silence and then
[31:45] there's the sacrifice
[31:47] this is what I saw when I was out in
[31:49] Oregon now look at it if you will turn
[31:51] in your Bibles Philippians 2 5 we're
[31:53] just going to slow down for a moment and
[31:55] just look at this for a second
[31:59] because I believe we're predestinated to
[32:01] walk in these same footsteps
[32:03] and I think sometimes we want God to
[32:05] just magically change us like just just
[32:08] Lord just mold me over make me what you
[32:11] want me to be
[32:12] foreign
[32:13] but you have there's a process to an
[32:16] adoption there's lessons that you've got
[32:18] to learn there's decisions you have to
[32:19] make there's there's there's sacrifices
[32:22] you have to make there's a there's a
[32:24] process of making yourself of no
[32:25] reputation there's a humbling of oneself
[32:28] it is not just being able to repeat what
[32:30] God has said it's being able to walk in
[32:33] his footsteps I believe the bride walks
[32:36] in his footsteps with him that's why as
[32:38] my subtitle to my title is follow me
[32:41] follow me
[32:43] and that's where if we look here it says
[32:45] let now that word let means allow
[32:47] you have to let this mind be in you that
[32:50] was also in Christ Jesus that means you
[32:52] have to push away your mind to let his
[32:54] mind come into view you have something
[32:56] you have to do you got a decision you
[32:58] got to make you have to seek his will
[33:00] you have to seek his faith say Lord is
[33:02] this your will or is this my will
[33:04] you know often and I was I was with Cali
[33:06] last night and I was talking I had to
[33:08] repent to my daughter and I literally
[33:10] repented her and I said I apologize 90
[33:12] of the time when this family prays we're
[33:15] asking for God to do something for us
[33:18] ninety percent of the time
[33:20] we're saying Lord
[33:22] ah I need you to heal my body Lord I
[33:25] need you to fix the situation at work
[33:27] Lord I need you to bless this food it's
[33:29] full of poison it's going to kill us if
[33:31] we don't if you don't sanctify and bless
[33:33] it you know what I'm saying Lord do this
[33:35] for me Lord do that for me Lord solve
[33:37] this problem Lord fix that person Lord I
[33:39] don't like this situation Lord deliver
[33:41] me from this one
[33:43] I've been wrong
[33:46] that's not how we're supposed to pray
[33:48] brother Branham said we don't pray to
[33:51] change God's mind
[33:53] we should be praying to change us to fit
[33:57] his mind and his will we pray wrong
[34:00] we're still showing our immaturity we're
[34:03] still speaking like children we should
[34:05] be saying Lord let me learn what you
[34:07] need me to learn Lord open my eyes to
[34:10] see how I should respond to that boss
[34:12] how I should respond to that person how
[34:15] should I be Lord in this situation Lord
[34:18] am I not seeing something should should
[34:20] I make a sacrifice should I cut
[34:22] something off should I turn down the
[34:24] overtime what do I do father amen
[34:26] there's no more crying out for the will
[34:28] of God in our lives
[34:29] we sit back say all is under control no
[34:32] no hold on God's working to restore a
[34:35] spiritual relationship between God and
[34:37] man where we can hear from God and be
[34:39] led of a spirit
[34:40] and actually know his will because the
[34:42] Bible brother bam said the bride will
[34:44] know his will she'll have thus saith the
[34:46] Lord or she stays silent she doesn't
[34:49] make a move
[34:50] she sits still
[34:54] we see this let you must make a decision
[34:56] to allow the will of God to have the
[34:58] preeminence in your life or not and I'm
[35:00] telling you God will bless you in either
[35:02] one that's what's so deceiving
[35:04] that's shocking I don't want to be
[35:06] blessed in doing something that's
[35:08] contrary to the will of God I truly
[35:10] don't
[35:12] remember brother Benham talks about that
[35:14] he says uh the false anointed ones he
[35:16] says we're getting results aren't we
[35:17] that's their excuse God's blessing what
[35:20] we do don't he but it's contrary to his
[35:22] will contrary to his word
[35:25] it's no sign that God's blessing it
[35:27] there's no sign that God's pleased and
[35:28] what you're doing
[35:31] it's okay we're just talking down to
[35:33] earth okay aside when we be so quiet I'm
[35:36] sorry like I'm talking to me remember
[35:38] I'm listening too I'm I'm tuned in
[35:42] and so who being in the form of God
[35:43] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[35:45] God this is unique because under the
[35:49] unveiling of Christ in this day we find
[35:51] out who we were yes yes we found we're
[35:53] part of God we found I'm bone of his
[35:55] bone life of his life flesh of his flesh
[35:58] there's something in the soul that came
[36:00] from God and it's going to go back to
[36:02] God and then not Jesus said don't they
[36:04] call them gods don't you not call them
[36:06] Gods whom the word of God comes to news
[36:09] flash your gods
[36:11] your sons and daughters of God
[36:14] manifested attributes of his thinking on
[36:17] this Earth to display Christ to the
[36:20] world
[36:21] so we're not it's not wrong for us to
[36:23] make ourselves equal with God but that's
[36:25] why I preach that one sermon on
[36:27] ascension by condescension or descension
[36:29] because if you look here when God's
[36:31] manifested in flesh he doesn't exalt
[36:33] himself he abases himself
[36:36] that's what's so a problem look at me
[36:39] I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ get out of
[36:40] my way I don't have time for you
[36:41] serpency
[36:42] nonsense
[36:44] can't stand that attitude
[36:46] get out of the way devil hey
[36:48] don't disregard a worthy opponent
[36:52] brother bam said God made himself a
[36:53] worthy opponent you're disregarding him
[36:56] and treat him like he's not a worthy
[36:57] opponent yeah come on now but you see
[37:00] that attitude it's just not right it's
[37:02] not the right attitude because I see
[37:04] this son He makes himself of no
[37:07] reputation
[37:09] he being in the form of God thought it
[37:10] not robbery to be equal but he made
[37:12] himself no reputation
[37:13] I'm not making myself big I'm making
[37:15] myself little
[37:16] took upon himself the form of a servant
[37:19] not a leader
[37:21] not one that said hey everybody sit down
[37:23] listen to me
[37:25] no Jesus didn't do that
[37:27] Jesus was a servant
[37:29] he was doing everything he could to help
[37:31] everybody he could that all the time see
[37:34] the attitude of a son of God
[37:36] how can I help you
[37:38] that's why brother Bama that quote there
[37:40] it just really shook me to my core this
[37:42] one objective I have is to see his true
[37:45] spiritual relationship between God and
[37:47] man restore that's my objective that was
[37:49] his objective I think we need to reframe
[37:52] why we're living here for a moment we're
[37:54] not living on this Earth to just have a
[37:56] comfortable life we should be living
[37:58] every day saying Lord I'm working I'm
[38:00] going to do my part to restore and take
[38:01] one step closer to you because I know
[38:03] there's a promise in the word it says if
[38:05] I draw an eye to you you'll draw an eye
[38:06] to me and while I'm living and drawing
[38:08] 92 I'm going to do something I can
[38:10] wherever I can with whomever I can to
[38:13] help them get a little closer to you
[38:15] I don't know who they are I don't know
[38:17] if they're bride not bride foolish
[38:19] version what does it matter they're
[38:21] human beings
[38:22] Christ died for him
[38:24] do something for somebody at all times
[38:27] you don't know who they are and you
[38:29] don't know why God allowed them in your
[38:31] life
[38:33] we get the wrong attitude about being
[38:35] the son of God
[38:36] get the wrong arrogancy there's no
[38:39] arrogancy you look at Jesus Christ he
[38:41] constantly abased himself Josephus said
[38:44] he didn't even raise his voice when he
[38:45] preached
[38:47] he talked quietly
[38:49] he just talked to the people it's just
[38:51] really struck me I was laying in bed
[38:52] last night I said how what did he do
[38:54] when he walked up to the disciples like
[38:56] think of this guys these are full-grown
[38:59] men working every day working hard these
[39:03] are men fishermen and tax collectors and
[39:06] Jesus little man not good looking
[39:09] there's no beauty that we should be
[39:11] holding it's just simple didn't use good
[39:14] words just talked in common everyday
[39:16] language
[39:18] walks up to a man looks at him
[39:21] follow me yeah
[39:23] and walks off
[39:25] and that full-grown man shuts his books
[39:29] drops his Nets leaves everything and
[39:31] follows him
[39:33] what sermon did he preaching
[39:36] what was said what happened
[39:39] my
[39:41] what kind of atmosphere was created
[39:43] Around Jesus Christ that when a man
[39:45] would even look at him and be in his
[39:47] presence he was willing to forsake all
[39:48] and come follow him
[39:52] and then we need almost an angel to come
[39:54] get us to do anything to draw close to
[39:55] God
[39:56] you know what I'm saying
[39:59] it's like just the very presence his
[40:01] presence and the Simplicity of his word
[40:03] ought to be enough for us to say drop in
[40:06] my net shutting my book pushing that
[40:08] over time away adios amigos you can have
[40:11] it all I want to be in the presence of
[40:13] God I'm leaving here soon this is a trip
[40:16] I gotta unpack for so I gotta get ready
[40:19] you see what that
[40:21] was it's so unique to me how he could
[40:25] just say follow me
[40:27] and you know what I believe he's doing I
[40:28] believe he's saying it again amen drop
[40:31] your nets
[40:32] shut the book
[40:34] turn off the cell phone
[40:36] I'm here
[40:38] follow me
[40:41] oh we got a lot of distractions everyone
[40:43] devil is good at his job people out
[40:46] there yelling the devil's no match mean
[40:48] you're spending four hours on the phone
[40:50] you just consume it yeah right Devil's
[40:53] no match for you uh-huh
[40:55] cannot get off of social media
[40:59] I'm not picking them but you know what
[41:00] I'm saying he's just whistling through
[41:02] the graveyard you're just bluffing
[41:05] God don't I mean devil don't care what
[41:07] you say he wants to see a life
[41:09] a voice of a thousand lived lives that's
[41:12] the Thunder that shakes the enemy I
[41:14] don't care what you say show me a life
[41:17] that's creating an atmosphere around it
[41:19] that the very presence of God is with
[41:21] you wherever you go
[41:23] stop telling me things show me
[41:28] that's the bride I believe she creates
[41:31] an atmosphere by what she's thinking
[41:32] about what she's consuming what she's
[41:34] reading the things that she's showing
[41:36] her desires for she's showing their
[41:38] desire for work she's showing their
[41:40] desire to be popular or is she Desiring
[41:42] to be in the presence of God I don't
[41:44] know it sounds like psalms 27 one thing
[41:46] have I desired of the Lord that I might
[41:48] dwell in the presence of God that's the
[41:51] desire of the Bride
[41:53] him yes amen
[41:56] I really could care less about
[41:58] formalities just so you know I don't
[42:00] come to church just to come to church
[42:01] and do my religious Duty I come to
[42:03] church I can draw close to God if he's

[43:00] okay so let's did I even finish the
[43:03] scripture no
[43:05] who being in the fashion of man who
[43:08] being found in the fashion as a man he
[43:10] humbled himself
[43:12] God didn't humble him he chose this
[43:15] decision he himself humbled himself he
[43:19] abased himself
[43:21] he washed the disciples feet
[43:24] it's amazing to me
[43:26] he didn't fight to defend his position
[43:29] he didn't try to convince everyone that
[43:31] he was right he just spoke the word
[43:35] humbly walked
[43:37] you look at what God went through to
[43:39] make himself of no reputation he
[43:41] literally went out of his way to make
[43:44] sure he had no reputation he allowed
[43:47] himself to be born in a bad way that the
[43:50] whole society says have nothing to do
[43:53] with them that's a bastard child stay
[43:55] away so he's walking living growing up
[43:58] with all the kids saying leave him alone
[44:00] mom dad say don't play with that kid
[44:02] he's a bastard child
[44:05] you know he went through this stuff
[44:07] let's step back into his shoes for a
[44:09] second you know literally he didn't come
[44:12] God didn't even allow his form to be
[44:14] handsome beautiful
[44:16] articulate he wasn't articulate
[44:19] everybody
[44:21] he spoke common everyday language
[44:25] because the people wouldn't be attracted
[44:27] to anything carnal they were going to be
[44:29] attracted to the words that he spoke
[44:31] they knew that this man speaks not like
[44:34] any other man that has ever been spoken
[44:36] this man has the words of eternal life
[44:38] and never has a man spoke like this
[44:41] and I was thinking about you like you're
[44:43] he's living in an hour they didn't have
[44:45] social media they didn't have the sports
[44:47] and entertainment you know what they did
[44:48] for fun the Smart Ones God amongst them
[44:51] and they would give oratory speeches and
[44:54] stuff like that the great ones
[44:57] and here comes Jesus
[44:59] real simple common everyday man
[45:04] he didn't have a nice suit when he
[45:06] preached you know that he didn't have
[45:08] the greatest garments the greatest robes
[45:10] no had a common everyday Fisherman's
[45:14] outfit or just a common man
[45:16] suit
[45:17] you could say not a suit
[45:19] didn't have great words of wisdom
[45:23] wasn't wasn't handsome
[45:26] it's ugly and he wasn't even tall
[45:30] sorry brother Brian he wasn't even tall
[45:32] brother he's short like me they're
[45:35] shorter than me more than likely
[45:38] but you see there was nothing there was
[45:41] no reputation
[45:42] he made himself in no reputation
[45:46] literally did everything he could to
[45:48] destroy his reputation
[45:50] let himself be identified with a
[45:53] drinkers the Sinners and prostitutes
[45:55] sitting there drinking or not drinking
[45:58] but you know sitting there and
[45:59] fellowshipping with the out the drug or
[46:02] whatever so drug addicts the prostitutes
[46:04] and everything he wasn't ashamed to be
[46:05] identified with him what kind of man is
[46:08] this Prophet From Galilee
[46:14] and sometimes we won't even fellowship
[46:15] with a believer that has a different
[46:16] Doctrine
[46:17] [Music]
[46:20] sorry I'll bring it home
[46:23] can't have fellowship and they'll see
[46:24] the way I see it
[46:27] why sound like Jesus would do it huh
[46:30] no Jesus didn't do that
[46:32] brother bam didn't do that in fact
[46:35] brother man we're gonna draw you out of
[46:36] our Circle that's okay I'll draw you
[46:38] right back in
[46:40] we ain't gonna have no fellowship with
[46:41] you that's okay I'm bringing you back in
[46:43] brother
[46:44] I love you
[46:46] greatest weapon he gave love
[46:50] prayer and love
[46:52] conquer any enemy
[46:55] we better go I'm gonna get in trouble
[46:59] um
[47:00] everybody okay
[47:01] amen sorry we slowed it way down
[47:05] so let's look at decisions if we can
[47:06] we'll pick up this pattern here
[47:10] before that make sure I say this and he
[47:12] became obedient unto death even the
[47:14] death of the cross the last portion is I
[47:17] want you to see there was first a
[47:18] decision he allowed the mind of Christ
[47:20] be in him
[47:21] you know brother banham said he was a
[47:23] man like you and me he could have had a
[47:24] wife he could have had a family he
[47:27] didn't have to do those things
[47:28] but he allowed it he led it he let the
[47:32] will of God become the primary purpose
[47:34] by which he was living
[47:35] and there's the question for all of you
[47:37] are you letting the will of God be the
[47:39] primary purpose and desire of your life
[47:43] where's your desires what's your purpose
[47:46] is it to see the will of God fulfilled
[47:48] and why he allowed me to come to earth
[47:50] or is it that I can have a most
[47:53] comfortable life possible
[47:58] and he humbled himself and he became
[48:00] obedient so you see the decision which
[48:02] led to silence
[48:04] he made himself a no reputation he
[48:06] didn't defend himself
[48:07] he didn't say Hey listen to me I got
[48:09] something to say no he stood like a lamb
[48:12] before a sheer's dumb he opened not his
[48:14] mouth then defend himself nor did he
[48:16] change the scene when he could have he
[48:18] had the power to do it
[48:20] but he didn't do it
[48:22] and then you see the last portion he
[48:24] himself became a sacrifice for somebody
[48:27] else
[48:28] and that's the pathway that I have seen
[48:30] as a pattern of an adopted son and I am
[48:34] not omnipotent and I am this is what I
[48:37] see I'm very much open to hearing what
[48:39] other people would see on this believe
[48:41] me I'm not one that says this is the
[48:42] answer no I this is what I see you show
[48:44] me of other things too but I certainly
[48:46] have seen these three patterns with an
[48:49] adopted son
[48:50] Jesus his decision was found in Mark 14
[48:54] 34 and say and saith unto them my soul
[48:57] is exceedingly sorrowful unto death
[48:59] Terry ye here and watch and he went
[49:02] forward a little and he fell on the
[49:04] ground and he prayed that if it were
[49:06] possible that this hour might pass him
[49:08] and he said Abba Father all things are
[49:10] possible uh take away this cup from me
[49:13] nevertheless not my will but thine will
[49:16] be done
[49:17] had a decision to make he allowed the
[49:20] will of the father to be his decision
[49:22] though he himself didn't want to pay
[49:24] that price but he submitted himself to
[49:27] the will of God and now we also seen it
[49:29] also displayed in John 17 19. it says
[49:33] and for their sakes I sanctify myself
[49:38] that they also may be Sanctified through
[49:41] thy truth
[49:42] so you see Jesus made a decision
[49:45] to sanctify himself for the father and
[49:48] for others
[49:50] the only way I can express my love to
[49:51] God how am I treating and loving others
[49:54] bible say that
[49:59] you'll find there's always a parallel
[50:00] anytime you're going to bring in an
[50:01] affection for God you're going to find
[50:03] it being expressed to a people every
[50:05] time I've not seen it fail look at the
[50:07] Ten Commandments honor thy father and
[50:09] thy mother covet not thy neighbor's wife
[50:12] you see all this have no other God
[50:14] before thee okay so first portion have
[50:16] no other God before thee keep those
[50:18] Commandments that keep me in line with
[50:19] you and treat your brother don't treat
[50:21] your brother wrong don't cover the
[50:22] brother's wife don't do you know you
[50:24] notice that everybody notice that first
[50:25] here and then here
[50:27] you notice
[50:30] so then as parallels in the Book of
[50:32] Joshua the decision is found in Joshua 1
[50:35] 6 and I should have made a PowerPoint
[50:36] but we'll just go through this Joshua 1
[50:39] 6 the decision
[50:40] it says and they answered Joshua saying
[50:43] all that thou commandest us we will do
[50:46] and withersoever thou sendeth us we will
[50:49] go according as he as we hearken unto
[50:53] Moses in all things so will we hearken
[50:55] unto thee only the Lord thy God be with
[50:58] thee as he was with Moses so before they
[51:01] go into the promised land they as a
[51:03] people are saying we will do what you
[51:05] tell us to do we will obey you in all
[51:07] that you say Joshua being the type of
[51:09] the Holy Ghost he's taking them into
[51:11] their promised land and going to
[51:13] positionally place them soon
[51:15] then we look at brother Branham his
[51:16] decision we know this one
[51:19] 1963 standing in the Gap Victor Leduc
[51:24] a full-blooded Frenchman born-again
[51:26] Christian filled with the Holy Spirit
[51:27] gave his address
[51:30] he wrote it down he said Danny uh but
[51:32] prophecy said over brother Branham given
[51:34] to Danny Henry on February 11 1961.
[51:39] at the Full Gospel businessmans
[51:41] now here's what it said because thou has
[51:44] chosen the narrow way the harder way
[51:47] that has walked in thine own choosing
[51:49] now I can see that because Moses made
[51:51] his choice thou has picked the correct
[51:54] and precise a precise and correct way
[51:56] and it is my way because of this
[52:00] momentous decision a huge portion of
[52:02] Heaven awaits thee what a glorious
[52:04] decision that thou has made this in and
[52:07] of itself will make him come to bring to
[52:08] pass a tremendous Victory and love
[52:10] divine for the Phantom had to make a
[52:11] choice
[52:12] before he could come to a cloud and an
[52:14] adopted son that God could have so much
[52:16] confidence in him that he could go back
[52:17] and preach the Seven Seals because he
[52:19] knew he would only say what the father
[52:20] wanted him to say he first had to come
[52:22] to a point of decision where he wasn't
[52:23] looking for the easy way out he was
[52:25] looking to do just what God Said which
[52:27] was usually found in the harder way
[52:29] so there's a great great great great
[52:31] great way for us to actually identify
[52:33] the decisions we make nine times out of
[52:35] ten I don't think it's the easy way
[52:38] don't think it's the easy way I think
[52:41] it's going to cost you
[52:43] I think the decisions that express our
[52:45] sonship and are coming to adoption is
[52:48] choosing heart of path
[52:50] it's just choosing the harder path it's
[52:52] loving the unlovely
[52:55] it's not reviling or it's not fighting
[52:58] back when reviled against
[53:01] it's not fighting when rejected
[53:04] this is choosing the harder way
[53:09] so brother branham's Choice came into
[53:10] view so we had Jesus's Choice come into
[53:12] view but the branham's choice comes into
[53:13] view now we'll see what brother Branham
[53:16] said about the bride he said in 1965 in
[53:19] leadership sometimes in life you have to
[53:22] confront a thing just like a young this
[53:24] young man did because you are a mortal
[53:26] being and it and God has given you the
[53:28] opportunity to make a choice
[53:30] you have a choice God made you in such a
[53:34] way that you can have a choice if he had
[53:37] put Adam and Eve if he put Adam and Eve
[53:39] on free moral agency so that they could
[53:41] choose and then they made the wrong
[53:42] choice and see he can do no more to you
[53:46] than he did to them he's got to put you
[53:49] the same way that he uh same he's got to
[53:54] put you the same thing so you can choose
[53:57] it or reject it you're making your
[53:58] choice
[54:00] okay understand sorry I got confused in
[54:02] the words
[54:03] and so you see the pattern first
[54:05] decision okay let's move to silence and
[54:07] I'm not going to spend a lot of time on
[54:08] silence because I preached that one here
[54:10] the second one was adoption into the
[54:13] silence and Jesus in Isaiah 53 he opened
[54:17] not his he was oppressed and Afflicted
[54:19] and he opened not his mouth he was
[54:21] brought as a lamb before the slaughter
[54:22] and a sheep before his shears is done so
[54:24] he opened not his mouth
[54:27] Jesus in silence
[54:30] John 5 19 then answered Jesus and said
[54:33] unto them verily verily I say unto you
[54:35] the son of man can do nothing in himself
[54:37] but what he seeth the father do
[54:39] for whatsoever things he seeth for what
[54:42] things soever he doeth these also doeth
[54:46] the son likewise so he didn't do
[54:48] anything except the father showed him
[54:49] what to do he went to the pool of
[54:51] Bethesda he had the power to heal
[54:52] everybody but he went to one man that
[54:54] the father showed him to go to do and he
[54:55] healed that one man that's it
[54:58] God's not vindicating you because the
[55:00] abundance of things that you're doing
[55:01] for him he's going to actually say
[55:03] that's my son because you did the one
[55:04] thing he wanted you to do for him
[55:06] you see
[55:09] it's not in the abundance of things we
[55:10] do are you doing the thing he wanted you
[55:13] to do
[55:14] maybe one thing you know he says about
[55:16] John the Baptist he let that man grow 30
[55:19] years you know learning for a six-month
[55:21] Ministry one thing he had to do just
[55:23] that one thing do that one thing
[55:25] it's like it's like the great Symphony
[55:27] right you know you ever see those got
[55:28] the guy he can't play any musical
[55:30] instruments so he holds those big uh
[55:32] Circle brass things you know they give
[55:34] that guy the guy who has no music
[55:36] without that be me they give him one job
[55:37] okay there's going to be a note coming
[55:39] and when that note comes you ding those
[55:42] things together right you see so he's
[55:45] got a job the symphony has him play his
[55:47] part we got a spot we got a place to
[55:49] play we may not have the gift to play a
[55:51] violin or play the we got to maybe just
[55:54] hit those what are those called symbols
[55:57] see I know nothing about music nothing
[56:00] horrible but we got one part to play and
[56:02] I gotta hit those symbols at just that
[56:04] right time and that may be the one thing
[56:06] God wants you to do
[56:08] that's just one thing just do that one
[56:10] thing
[56:12] usually though it's the hardest thing to
[56:14] do yes
[56:14] yes we'll justify everything else is
[56:17] we're serving God because we're doing
[56:18] this we're going to church we're paying
[56:20] our tithes we're we're you know what I'm
[56:21] saying we're doing everything right
[56:23] religiously but you're not doing that
[56:25] one thing he showed you to do
[56:28] that one thing there's one and you know
[56:31] what it is usually sometimes there's
[56:33] just one thing down in your heart you're
[56:35] refusing to do
[56:36] and you're trying to cover it up you're
[56:38] trying to cover up your religious walk
[56:39] with God you know you're not in not in
[56:41] fellowship with God because there's that
[56:42] one thing that one thing that's keeping
[56:44] you separated from it you're not making
[56:46] that one step having that one
[56:48] conversation not making that one choice
[56:50] that will bring you back into his
[56:52] presence
[56:54] so you just go real fast and run to
[56:56] church and do stay busy and stay in
[56:58] Fellowship but you don't do that one
[57:00] thing
[57:02] it's Unique that that's striking me I
[57:04] kind of feel funny about it that one
[57:05] thing that one thing may be keeping you
[57:07] from his presence
[57:08] do that one thing
[57:11] um
[57:13] so
[57:15] and Mark
[57:17] it says Mark 14
[57:19] he said oh no now let's go to the
[57:22] parallel of Joshua
[57:23] this silence
[57:25] I'm getting nervous because it's already
[57:27] 8 20. so parallel
[57:30] Joshua 6 10. let's see this silence in
[57:33] action
[57:34] and Joshua had commanded the people
[57:36] saying ye shall not shout nor make any
[57:38] noise with your mouth neither shall any
[57:41] word proceed from your mouth until the
[57:43] day that I bid you shout then ye shout
[57:47] Joshua the type of the Holy Ghost having
[57:49] headship and Leadership and dominion
[57:51] over his lead over the people saying
[57:53] don't speak until I tell you to speak
[57:56] is that what he said
[57:58] now we follow it back down into six six
[58:00] Joshua 6 16 and it came to pass that at
[58:02] the seventh time when the priest blew
[58:04] the Trump Rich Joshua said unto the
[58:06] people shout for the Lord hath given
[58:08] Thee the city now it was time for them
[58:10] to speak so they learned when to be
[58:12] silent and they learned no when to speak
[58:15] Amen to not make that decision not do
[58:18] that thing and then they knew okay now
[58:20] it's time to do that thing
[58:23] there's a pattern if you notice there's
[58:25] a pattern popping out
[58:28] he wants you to walk with him amen not
[58:30] separated from you know your own little
[58:32] journey through life no
[58:34] follow me
[58:36] come follow me I've got a path
[58:39] stick close to me I'll take you
[58:41] so
[58:43] Joshua 6 20 and so the people shouted
[58:45] when the priests blew the trumpets and
[58:47] it came to pass when the people heard
[58:49] the sound of the trumpet and the people
[58:50] shouted with a great shout that the
[58:52] walls fell flat so that the people went
[58:54] up into the city every man straight
[58:56] before him and they took the city
[59:00] there's your silence paralleling in the
[59:02] Book of Joshua now let's bring it into
[59:03] brother Branham
[59:05] brother Branham had his moment of
[59:07] silence too
[59:09] he says in 1961
[59:12] Abraham and his seed after him a man met
[59:15] me the other night brother Branham if
[59:17] you'll just compromise
[59:19] this great man in the Full Gospel Church
[59:21] will will take and furnish an airplane
[59:24] if you'll join our organization and
[59:28] you'll and we'll take you with this gift
[59:30] to every major city in the world and
[59:33] blast this thing forth if you'll just
[59:35] compromise a little bit on what you're
[59:38] teaching
[59:39] oh
[59:41] just a little compromise just say
[59:43] something a little bit more than what
[59:45] God wanted you to do
[59:47] he said I he said
[59:49] I said you with a doctor's degree would
[59:52] ask a servant of God to compromise on
[59:54] the word of God I can't even think of
[59:57] such a thing as that man I said no sir
[1:00:01] there's no compromise in me at all I
[1:00:05] said I believe God's word teaches the
[1:00:08] coming of the Lord or the coming of the
[1:00:10] Son of God I believe in the baptism Holy
[1:00:12] Spirit I believe in the signs and
[1:00:13] wonders following the Believers that's
[1:00:15] exactly what God Said and that's what I
[1:00:16] stand by
[1:00:18] I like that is that the attitude of you
[1:00:21] guys that's what God said I'm standing
[1:00:23] with it I don't care what the devil
[1:00:24] would say anything contrary to the word
[1:00:25] of God get out of here what's wrong with
[1:00:27] you man I like brother Brandon's
[1:00:30] attitude what's wrong with you man
[1:00:32] doctor's degree
[1:00:33] you compromise on the word of God nah
[1:00:38] now if the bride has the same attitude
[1:00:41] now the pergamian church age those in
[1:00:43] the bride only do his will
[1:00:46] no one can make them do otherwise
[1:00:48] oh we'll make you a popular person you
[1:00:51] know no
[1:00:53] they have thus saith the Lord or they
[1:00:54] keep still they know that it has to be
[1:00:57] God in them doing these Works fulfilling
[1:00:58] his word he did not complete all his
[1:01:01] work while he was in this earthy
[1:01:02] Ministry so now he works in and through
[1:01:04] his bride
[1:01:06] dropping down to the next one he says
[1:01:08] now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb
[1:01:11] our promised land is coming into sight
[1:01:13] even as it did theirs now Joshua means
[1:01:15] Jehovah's savior he represents that end
[1:01:17] time leader that'll come to the church
[1:01:19] even as Paul came to the original leader
[1:01:22] Caleb represents those that stayed true
[1:01:24] to Joshua remember God had started
[1:01:27] Israel as a virgin with his word but see
[1:01:30] they wanted something different so did
[1:01:33] this last day Church
[1:01:34] such a pressure to compromise just a
[1:01:37] pressure to let things in that wouldn't
[1:01:38] be pleasing to God into our lives into
[1:01:40] our churches into our homes that you
[1:01:42] know is not pleasing to God but this is
[1:01:44] a little compromise does it really mean
[1:01:45] that much does it mean having the
[1:01:47] presence of God in your home I don't
[1:01:49] know you answer the question
[1:01:51] is that little compromise
[1:01:53] costing you a relationship with him
[1:01:55] costing you his presence having the uh
[1:01:58] having him feel welcome in your home you
[1:02:00] know that little compromise you know
[1:02:02] that little thing that video you know
[1:02:04] that little thing that you know you got
[1:02:06] to hide it every time a Believer comes
[1:02:08] to your house
[1:02:09] you know just little things little
[1:02:11] compromises
[1:02:12] it's little compromises
[1:02:15] no we say no it's the word of God or
[1:02:17] nothing
[1:02:19] I'll be militant about that one that's a
[1:02:21] German inside me no
[1:02:23] it's the word or nothing
[1:02:26] and so
[1:02:28] now
[1:02:29] let's look to sacrifice
[1:02:32] now this is the one that I kind of honed
[1:02:34] in on and uh
[1:02:36] this is the one that it means a lot to
[1:02:38] me right now personally as well
[1:02:41] because I find myself in the same path
[1:02:44] John here's Jesus's sacrifice John 10
[1:02:47] 17. therefore Duff my father loved me
[1:02:51] because I laid down my life
[1:02:54] that I may take it up again no man
[1:02:57] taketh it from me
[1:02:59] but I lay it down of myself I have power
[1:03:03] to lay it down I have power to take it
[1:03:06] up again
[1:03:07] this commandment have I received of my
[1:03:09] father you see no man took his life
[1:03:12] he freely by his free choice laid his
[1:03:15] life down
[1:03:16] you know what
[1:03:17] you make your own choice you either
[1:03:20] surrender you'll either be crucified you
[1:03:23] either be rejected you either be
[1:03:25] destroyed for other sake
[1:03:28] this is the path we get to choose
[1:03:29] everyone
[1:03:30] because I do believe that's part of it I
[1:03:33] believe my will gets destroyed in the
[1:03:35] process of his will taking preeminence
[1:03:39] now in Isaiah it says it pleased the
[1:03:42] Lord to bruise him he hath put on him
[1:03:45] grief
[1:03:46] when he shall make his soul an offering
[1:03:48] for sin he shall see a seed he shall
[1:03:50] prolong his days and the pleasure of the
[1:03:52] Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall
[1:03:55] see the travail of his soul and shall be
[1:03:57] satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[1:04:00] righteous servant justify many for he
[1:04:03] shall bear their iniquities therefore
[1:04:05] will I divide him a portion with the
[1:04:07] great and he shall divide the spoil with
[1:04:09] the strong because he hath poured out
[1:04:12] his soul unto death and he was numbered
[1:04:15] with the transgressors and he bear the
[1:04:18] sin of many and May and was made an
[1:04:20] intercessor for the transgressors
[1:04:23] by his own free choice
[1:04:26] you know a father does that with a
[1:04:27] family a father will die so his family
[1:04:31] could live you know you go to work you
[1:04:34] destroy your body so the family can be
[1:04:37] provided for that's what a father does
[1:04:38] right you know the scripture we have ten
[1:04:40] thousand instructors and few fathers
[1:04:43] the Bible says that and there's an
[1:04:45] element to that that really resonates to
[1:04:47] me because you can have someone that
[1:04:49] tells you what to do you can have
[1:04:50] someone else that'll intercede on you
[1:04:52] and pay a price for you to do it
[1:04:54] you know someone that'll go to prayer
[1:04:56] for you someone that will really
[1:04:58] sacrifice for you not many will do that
[1:05:00] many people tell you what to do but if
[1:05:03] it requires them to do something for you
[1:05:04] ah
[1:05:06] it takes effort that takes sacrifice
[1:05:09] humans don't want to sacrifice we want
[1:05:11] the easier way
[1:05:13] we do it's our nature we avoid pain at
[1:05:16] all costs that's just the reality of
[1:05:19] your carnal flesh
[1:05:21] but the soul does his will and his will
[1:05:24] is that you would die in sacrifice and
[1:05:26] pay a price for your brother
[1:05:28] do something for somebody else intercede
[1:05:31] for someone else lose some sleep at
[1:05:33] night I lost some sleep to come here
[1:05:35] tonight but I did it because I want to
[1:05:37] be a blessing that's okay with me I know
[1:05:40] it's either brother Chandler to talk
[1:05:41] about it's like every time we go to
[1:05:43] preach it's like so difficult to preach
[1:05:45] why I had a horrible day yesterday I
[1:05:47] wanted to be home and spend the whole
[1:05:49] day in prayer and I had a big problem in
[1:05:52] the morning and a bigger problem in the
[1:05:54] afternoon it was horrible day and like
[1:05:56] why is it always like this every time I
[1:05:58] get asked to preach I know it's going to
[1:06:00] be hard it's always hard
[1:06:02] and honestly I want to say no like I
[1:06:05] really selfishly I want to talk about
[1:06:07] his head sorry brother busy can't do it
[1:06:09] right now because every time it's tough
[1:06:11] every single time I'm either sick I
[1:06:14] don't sleep problems at work something
[1:06:16] goes wrong every time
[1:06:18] now then I got a conscious choice to
[1:06:20] make don't I now I know I'm gonna if I
[1:06:23] say yes if I tell brother Chad sure I'll
[1:06:26] go
[1:06:27] I know it's coming Brother Rich asked me
[1:06:29] to come out to Oregon I had a head cold
[1:06:32] five days before I go and you ever fly
[1:06:34] on an airplane with a splitting head
[1:06:36] cold you know and the pressure on it
[1:06:37] coming down out to my ear is ringing and
[1:06:40] I lost Hearing in my ear which was
[1:06:41] messing with my equilibrium which was
[1:06:43] making me dizzy right brother Wesley and
[1:06:45] I I it was wild I'm like every time go
[1:06:48] to the Philippines sick
[1:06:50] go sometimes he don't go with me and I
[1:06:52] go by myself and then I'm really really
[1:06:54] really sick
[1:06:55] you know it's horrible why is preaching
[1:06:58] so difficult like why why why is it
[1:07:01] always like this I think it's part of
[1:07:03] something I'm learning
[1:07:05] I think it's part of something that
[1:07:06] God's showing me in all of it what price
[1:07:09] am I willing to pay for somebody else
[1:07:12] for someone else to be helped for
[1:07:14] someone else to be blessed
[1:07:16] to maybe if I have to go through
[1:07:18] suffering so that God could say just one
[1:07:19] word that helps you then it's okay I
[1:07:22] think brother Branham said I would push
[1:07:24] a a nickel if I knew it this would help
[1:07:26] me I'd push a Nick or a penny around the
[1:07:28] whole city if I knew it would help you
[1:07:30] you see the attitude of a son of God
[1:07:33] man he would do anything to help you you
[1:07:35] didn't care who you were didn't care if
[1:07:37] you were a bride didn't matter I'd do
[1:07:40] anything I could to help you make your
[1:07:41] burden a little lighter upon this Earth
[1:07:43] because life's hard I get it life's
[1:07:46] difficult I got a lot of sympathy for
[1:07:47] people and this day my goodness people
[1:07:50] are losing their minds and you can see
[1:07:52] why what hope do they have like do you
[1:07:55] fault a person for going on drugs and
[1:07:57] drinking themselves what hope do they
[1:08:00] have stop condemning people they're just
[1:08:03] trying to satisfy their nerves so they
[1:08:05] don't lose their minds in this crazy
[1:08:07] world
[1:08:08] you know I don't know why I just have a
[1:08:10] sympathy because I realize yeah without
[1:08:13] Christ I mean I get it
[1:08:16] I get it I totally see why you throw
[1:08:19] yourself into this thing and this thing
[1:08:21] and this thing and this thing it's
[1:08:22] because you don't have Christ but I
[1:08:23] promise you one thing you get Christ you
[1:08:25] won't thirst that stuff no more I
[1:08:27] promise you that
[1:08:28] I promise you brother Branham said
[1:08:30] something I was speaking to the youth he
[1:08:32] said it was your faith that lifted you
[1:08:34] up out of those things it was your faith
[1:08:37] so many times well God Lifted Me Up out
[1:08:39] of it no it was your faith in the word
[1:08:40] that lifted you up out of that God
[1:08:42] placed something inside of you that
[1:08:44] could say Amen to the word and you
[1:08:45] believed it and God like dropped a
[1:08:47] ladder down into where you were in the
[1:08:49] mud and the muck and the filth of life
[1:08:50] and it's like a ladder and you just take
[1:08:52] a step of faith on that ladder and just
[1:08:54] wow where am I going you're just
[1:08:55] climbing out of it you get into the
[1:08:57] depths of depression I promise you start
[1:08:59] believing the word you're going to climb
[1:09:00] out of it you get sorrowful you get
[1:09:02] weary you get sick I promise you put
[1:09:05] your faith back in the promise of God
[1:09:06] he's going to drop like a ladder down to
[1:09:08] you start climbing yourself out of it
[1:09:09] it's not rocket science
[1:09:12] right it's just have faith in God
[1:09:14] he's provided everything we have need up
[1:09:16] for this Earthly Journey you just got to
[1:09:18] believe it
[1:09:19] Stop Believing the devil's lies
[1:09:21] it's a lie anything contrary to the word
[1:09:23] of God I don't care how convincing it is
[1:09:25] I don't care how much your mind reasons
[1:09:26] with and says that's the truth it's a
[1:09:28] lie not made to live this life using
[1:09:31] this
[1:09:32] does the Bible say God took a man's mind
[1:09:34] head God took to God's devil took a
[1:09:37] man's mind God took his heart
[1:09:40] seed of faith is right down inside of
[1:09:42] there say that's the truth I believe it
[1:09:44] amen and just climb right on out of it
[1:09:47] don't let nothing get in your way I
[1:09:48] think brother Ben said just cut your way
[1:09:50] through every bit of it
[1:09:51] that's what we do with the word but it's
[1:09:53] faith in the word why did the word not
[1:09:55] profit them it was never mixed with
[1:09:57] faith why is the word not profiting you
[1:09:59] you're not believing it right
[1:10:01] you don't want to blame so many people
[1:10:03] about so many problems maybe you don't
[1:10:04] believe the word
[1:10:07] maybe you have more confidence in the
[1:10:09] Natural Things of life in politics or
[1:10:11] things of that nature and you have no
[1:10:13] confidence in the word my goodness man
[1:10:14] stop consuming the nonsense and start
[1:10:16] getting back into the word faith comes
[1:10:18] by hearing the words to start reading
[1:10:19] the word feeding on the word and see
[1:10:20] what happens
[1:10:22] it has a way of stirring you back up
[1:10:25] again I lost my place where did I go
[1:10:29] Isaiah okay Jesus
[1:10:32] Jesus is sacrificed now parallel and
[1:10:35] Joshua
[1:10:36] now this is the one that's interesting
[1:10:38] now the parallel in Joshua I found to be
[1:10:40] in a little story of a man named Aiken
[1:10:44] and we'll read it for a second
[1:10:47] because this man was willing to
[1:10:48] sacrifice the wrong thing
[1:10:50] he was willing to sacrifice the word he
[1:10:53] was willing to sacrifice the presence of
[1:10:54] God for something carnal
[1:10:57] and look at what happened Joshua 7 20
[1:11:00] and Aiken answered Joshua and said
[1:11:02] indeed I have sinned against the Lord
[1:11:04] God of Israel and thus and thus have I
[1:11:06] done
[1:11:07] when I saw Among The Spoils of the
[1:11:09] goodly Babylonian garment and 200
[1:11:12] shekels of silver and a wedge of gold
[1:11:15] and 50 shekels of weight then I coveted
[1:11:17] them and I took them and behold they are
[1:11:20] hidden the Earth in the midst of my tent
[1:11:22] and the silver under it
[1:11:24] and Joshua and all of Israel with him
[1:11:27] took Aiken and the son of the son of
[1:11:29] Zariah zura and the silver and the
[1:11:32] Garment and the gold and his sons and
[1:11:34] his daughters and his oxen and his asses
[1:11:36] and his sheep and his tent and all that
[1:11:38] he had and he brought them into the
[1:11:39] valley of acor and Joshua said why hast
[1:11:42] thou troubled us the Lord shall trouble
[1:11:44] thee this day and all of Israel stoned
[1:11:46] him as stones and burned them with fire
[1:11:48] and they were stoned and they had stoned
[1:11:51] them with stones after they had stoned
[1:11:52] them with stones this man named Aiken
[1:11:55] was not willing to sacrifice his Lust
[1:11:57] For carnal things
[1:11:59] for having the presence of God lead him
[1:12:01] he was willing to sacrifice the presence
[1:12:03] and the leadership of God not only for
[1:12:06] him his life but for his home and for 36
[1:12:08] other Israelites that died because one
[1:12:11] man wouldn't make a sacrifice
[1:12:14] the reality of it is a father to a home
[1:12:16] if you're not willing to pay a price for
[1:12:17] your family you don't pay the price you
[1:12:20] and your family pay a price so many
[1:12:22] times we think that our decisions are
[1:12:24] isolated to ourself no it ain't
[1:12:26] I'm sorry it's just not
[1:12:28] it's not
[1:12:30] your lack of making a sacrifice for your
[1:12:33] for the your family affects them and
[1:12:35] also us
[1:12:39] affects this whole church
[1:12:41] a lack of laying your will down the lack
[1:12:43] of laying your own ideas down a lack of
[1:12:45] saying Lord you know what I'm saying and
[1:12:47] make it real for a second
[1:12:49] if you don't make a sacrifice
[1:12:52] someone else is going to pay a price
[1:12:53] along with you
[1:12:55] it's never just you it's never isolated
[1:12:57] to just you
[1:12:59] there's someone else that'll suffer too
[1:13:04] and so
[1:13:05] looking at brother Branham
[1:13:07] he preaches a sermon called standing in
[1:13:09] the gap
[1:13:11] and you get to see a sacrifice that he
[1:13:13] had to make you know
[1:13:14] he got tired of being rejected tired of
[1:13:17] being constantly he'd preach with all
[1:13:19] his heart all his soul bring the truth
[1:13:21] to him and he was constantly rejecting
[1:13:22] he started getting the complex towards
[1:13:24] the people
[1:13:25] and brother by Adam even admits he's
[1:13:26] like I wanted to leave I wanted to run
[1:13:28] off to the wilderness
[1:13:30] I couldn't take it no more I couldn't
[1:13:32] take it I I just I lost my feeling for
[1:13:34] the people
[1:13:35] if I've lost the feeling for the people
[1:13:37] you can't help nobody
[1:13:39] if you don't have feeling for someone
[1:13:41] you can't help them
[1:13:42] I promise you you can't help them
[1:13:45] brother ma'am said the secret of my
[1:13:46] Ministry is I could sympathize with the
[1:13:48] person step into his shoes understanding
[1:13:52] sympathize with how he may be feeling or
[1:13:54] what he's going through that was the
[1:13:56] secret to his ministry
[1:13:58] and so brother Branham and standing in
[1:13:59] the Gap he was going to leave he's going
[1:14:01] to say I'm done with this people I'm
[1:14:03] angry I'm upset with the people I don't
[1:14:04] want to do this no more
[1:14:06] but God showed him if you go that way
[1:14:08] and ain't going to end so good for you
[1:14:10] and then he brought to his review the
[1:14:11] other people that would suffer because
[1:14:13] he doesn't take that stand I got
[1:14:14] something for you aren't you glad he
[1:14:16] came back
[1:14:17] aren't you glad that he was willing to
[1:14:19] pay a price aren't you glad that he was
[1:14:21] willing to not compromise on the word of
[1:14:23] God to say just what the word of God
[1:14:25] said to be faithful in his decisions to
[1:14:27] not choose the easier way but to choose
[1:14:29] the harder way aren't you thankful that
[1:14:31] he could be given millions of dollars
[1:14:33] and say hey we can make you the most
[1:14:34] popular man on Earth we could fly you
[1:14:36] around on the Jets and he said no if it
[1:14:38] causes me to have to compromise the Lord
[1:14:40] of God I won't take that way I'm so glad
[1:14:42] that God had a man that was willing to
[1:14:44] pay that kind of a price to be that kind
[1:14:46] of a man that would stand upon the word
[1:14:48] of God regardless of what man thought
[1:14:49] even said when I go to preach these
[1:14:51] things I'm going to lose thousands and
[1:14:52] thousands of my friends
[1:14:55] but for the will of God
[1:14:58] amen and for the purity of the Gospel
[1:15:00] knowing that God is preparing the people
[1:15:03] I did it for you and me
[1:15:05] yeah man that's interesting
[1:15:08] so there was a purpose in it brother bam
[1:15:09] says in standing in the gap
[1:15:11] he said I let the sick lay I want the
[1:15:14] Lord I want the Lord to let to tell me
[1:15:17] where to go and what not to do that was
[1:15:20] wrong I had built myself up a complex
[1:15:22] because the people didn't hear my
[1:15:23] message and if you and God forbid that I
[1:15:27] ever try to compare my life now with
[1:15:28] Moses but it's exactly what Moses did
[1:15:31] and the people wouldn't listen to him
[1:15:32] and he'd come down into to deliver them
[1:15:35] so he just left them alone and went into
[1:15:38] the Wilderness but God turned him around
[1:15:40] and he had a lot he had a long forgot
[1:15:43] for because he had long forgotten the
[1:15:45] suffering people
[1:15:47] so the reality of it is
[1:15:50] we gotta we gotta be willing to do this
[1:15:52] for somebody else not just for ourselves
[1:15:54] sometimes you have to choose a harder
[1:15:56] way and pay a great price for somebody
[1:15:58] else not for you I think it is in the
[1:16:00] it's not the Marines the Navy Seals I
[1:16:02] believe it is they they put them in
[1:16:04] groups together because it's easy for a
[1:16:06] Navy SEAL when they're going to training
[1:16:07] to just want to give up if they're the
[1:16:09] only one that has to pay the price but
[1:16:11] actually what they'll do is I think
[1:16:12] they'll tie them together they join them
[1:16:14] with other people because they found out
[1:16:15] that you're willing to endure a lot more
[1:16:17] when you know somebody else is going to
[1:16:19] suffer if you don't make that decision
[1:16:21] or you don't stand in there that's how
[1:16:23] they train those Navy Seals and the
[1:16:25] reality of it is you can endure a lot
[1:16:27] more if you know this ain't just about
[1:16:28] you everyone this is about all of us
[1:16:31] this is about your family this is about
[1:16:33] your children this is about your wife
[1:16:34] this is about your extended family this
[1:16:36] is about your co-workers this is about
[1:16:38] everything around you you're a little
[1:16:40] God that has been placed in a little
[1:16:41] atmosphere that you come in contact with
[1:16:44] a little world of people around you each
[1:16:46] and every day and they have to they
[1:16:48] you've got a purpose in being there
[1:16:50] you've got a purpose in your job you got
[1:16:51] a purpose where where you're living
[1:16:53] where you're expressing Christ to this
[1:16:55] world there's a purpose behind it and so
[1:16:57] I've got to be willing to sanctify
[1:16:58] myself and make some harder decisions
[1:17:00] because there's somebody else counting
[1:17:01] on me somebody else counting on me
[1:17:04] and so
[1:17:06] now the bride
[1:17:08] Luke 9 23 and we'll wrap it up quick
[1:17:11] here just hit this portion
[1:17:14] it says in Luke 9 23 and he said unto
[1:17:17] them all if any man will come after me
[1:17:19] let him deny himself take up his cross
[1:17:22] daily and follow me for whosoever will
[1:17:25] save his life will lose it but whosoever
[1:17:27] will lose his life for my sake the same
[1:17:30] shall save it my opening scripture
[1:17:33] because I still believe if I'm going to
[1:17:35] follow him I'm going to have to pick up
[1:17:37] a cross and if I can't find a cross then
[1:17:38] I'm probably not walking the right path
[1:17:42] I must be on the wrong path if I can't
[1:17:44] identify what cross I'm actually picking
[1:17:46] up daily
[1:17:48] it's Unique this is a daily cross I
[1:17:50] gotta pick up
[1:17:52] but maybe I'm on the wrong path because
[1:17:53] I can't seem to find the cross
[1:17:58] Romans 8 35 who shall separate us from
[1:18:00] the love of God shall tribulation
[1:18:02] distress or persecution famine nakedness
[1:18:04] Peril or sword it is written for thy
[1:18:07] sake we are killed all day long we are
[1:18:11] counted as sheep for the slaughter nay
[1:18:13] in all these things we are more than
[1:18:15] conquerors through him that loved us do
[1:18:18] you realize he's calling those that are
[1:18:19] willing to be killed and slayed for the
[1:18:22] gospel's sake conquerors there's your
[1:18:25] conquerors there's your Mighty bride of
[1:18:28] Jesus Christ the ones that's willing to
[1:18:30] die for his brother and one that's
[1:18:32] willing to pay whatever price necessary
[1:18:34] to help someone else there's your true
[1:18:37] conquerors you know God hides things in
[1:18:39] such Simplicity we think it's going to
[1:18:42] be great big wonderful watch this and
[1:18:43] watch that you'll find a bride that just
[1:18:46] simply humbly walking according to his
[1:18:47] word doing the one thing that he wants
[1:18:49] you to do here the one thing he wants
[1:18:51] you to do there just obedient and
[1:18:53] faithful to do the father's will that's
[1:18:55] it
[1:18:55] just a real simple humble life I think
[1:18:57] brother Branham said live a simple
[1:18:59] humble life and God wants you to do
[1:19:00] something he'll show you what to do and
[1:19:02] then do that one thing
[1:19:03] don't try to do something more just do
[1:19:05] what he called you to do and Shalom he
[1:19:07] says suffering for the namesake is
[1:19:09] Growing Pains of his grace
[1:19:12] suffering for his word see is just the
[1:19:15] Growing Pains of his grace yes sir just
[1:19:18] remember it's the grace of God that was
[1:19:20] given unto you
[1:19:22] we're in the growing pain stage guys
[1:19:24] ever have them growing pains in the
[1:19:26] middle of the night when you're a kid
[1:19:27] can't do anything about it
[1:19:29] you're going to get them they hurt
[1:19:31] you got to go through it
[1:19:33] this is all this adoption part it's just
[1:19:35] the Growing Pains of his grace the
[1:19:37] difficulties that we incur the
[1:19:39] situations amongst churches Growing
[1:19:41] Pains of his grace
[1:19:43] I'm convinced more and more each and
[1:19:45] every day that God has allowed certain
[1:19:46] things to come our way as individuals us
[1:19:49] as the people and as a fellowship of
[1:19:50] Believers and that to a bride as a whole
[1:19:52] because it's time for the maturing of
[1:19:54] the Bride
[1:19:55] he's going to increase the sunlight he's
[1:19:57] going to check the motives and the
[1:19:58] objectives of your heart the purpose of
[1:20:00] your desires why you do everything you
[1:20:02] do why you make the decisions that you
[1:20:04] make why you can't seem to just stay
[1:20:06] with what he wants you to do and what
[1:20:08] price are you willing to pay for one
[1:20:09] another
[1:20:12] I believe that's an adopted son yes I
[1:20:14] believe that's what we're going to see
[1:20:15] come into view
[1:20:17] bam says Christ The Mystery of God
[1:20:19] revealed he says why do you hunger
[1:20:20] Church
[1:20:21] why do you thirst it's the father trying
[1:20:24] to reveal his hidden secret to you but
[1:20:26] you let so many things get it away from
[1:20:28] you you let your job you let your wife
[1:20:31] let your husband you let your children
[1:20:33] you let the cares of this world you let
[1:20:35] some Pastor you let somebody get that
[1:20:37] out of you when you do that
[1:20:40] way down in your heart you're thirsting
[1:20:43] you're hungry it's God trying to reveal
[1:20:46] it to you it's see it's a revelation for
[1:20:49] the last day is here I'm thirsting
[1:20:51] everyone I hope I'm not the only one
[1:20:53] thirsting I'm thirsting and now I'm
[1:20:56] looking at my life and saying now really
[1:20:58] what needs to be done
[1:21:00] what needs to be done I think he's got
[1:21:02] to change our harder motive and
[1:21:03] objective it's not just knowing the
[1:21:05] right thing it's actually becoming being
[1:21:07] conformed in the image of his dear son
[1:21:09] it's the time for that conforming it's
[1:21:11] the time to be crushed it's the time to
[1:21:14] analyze the decision it's the time to
[1:21:16] look at their purpose in life it's a
[1:21:18] time for those things and then it's a
[1:21:20] time for us to know when to be quiet
[1:21:22] and there's a time to know when to speak
[1:21:24] following the headship of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:26] leadership by his word just doing what
[1:21:29] he wants us to do and then not doing
[1:21:31] anything that he doesn't want us to do
[1:21:34] where you stand musicians where you come
[1:21:41] hope that's okay
[1:21:42] it was a little slow for me tonight I'm
[1:21:44] sorry I should have drank a cup of
[1:21:46] coffee before I came up to the pulpit
[1:21:48] hey man
[1:21:50] I had this quote I liked it just struck
[1:21:53] me last night when I was thinking this
[1:21:54] follow me
[1:21:56] I don't know if it fits but I just left
[1:21:58] it in here remember when brother Brandon
[1:22:00] was walking through the woods and a
[1:22:01] voice said you want to walk with me
[1:22:03] remember that it just kind of struck me
[1:22:05] I was laying there in bed
[1:22:07] and it really I I have a hard time
[1:22:10] reading this he said I was I stood there
[1:22:12] watching and they got closer and closer
[1:22:14] and they turned and walked out into the
[1:22:17] woods and I just stood there just
[1:22:18] dumbfounded
[1:22:20] because you remember he had the
[1:22:21] opportunity he could have killed three
[1:22:22] deer boom boom boom he said one for a
[1:22:24] brother this brother one for this
[1:22:25] brother and one for this brother they
[1:22:27] had asked him you know and brother
[1:22:28] Branham remember he had a complex
[1:22:30] he loved to be loved because he was
[1:22:33] rejected as a kid he was totally
[1:22:36] rejected I mean bad name Born Under a
[1:22:39] Bad Name totally suffered a complex and
[1:22:41] he really loved to be loved he wanted to
[1:22:43] be loved who doesn't we all do and he
[1:22:47] thought you know what I could get one
[1:22:48] for that one and that one and that
[1:22:49] brother I'll be a real hero when I come
[1:22:51] back to the camp you know he said but I
[1:22:54] made God a promise he didn't like that
[1:22:56] and I made God a promise I wouldn't do
[1:22:58] that no more
[1:23:00] it's interesting he said I went and then
[1:23:03] I went away and the voice spoke again
[1:23:04] that Sean was the Sun was shining on my
[1:23:07] back it said you remembered your promise
[1:23:09] didn't you
[1:23:11] I don't know why that struck me so like
[1:23:14] it did last night it's like God was
[1:23:16] taken aback he was like shocked oh you
[1:23:19] did that of your own free will
[1:23:22] you did something that pleased me and I
[1:23:24] didn't force you to do it I wasn't going
[1:23:27] to punish you if you didn't
[1:23:29] I was the poor wrath and lightning
[1:23:31] wasn't going to come out a voice wasn't
[1:23:32] going to scream you broke your promise
[1:23:36] no God was like wow
[1:23:39] you remembered your promise to me
[1:23:42] you didn't forget about me
[1:23:45] and you know sometimes we know God won't
[1:23:46] forget about us but I wonder if God
[1:23:48] sometimes sits back and say did they
[1:23:50] forget about me
[1:23:52] did they forget about me they only ever
[1:23:55] call on me when I need they need me to
[1:23:57] do something for him
[1:23:59] that's the only time I hear them pray
[1:24:01] anymore
[1:24:02] it's when they need something from me
[1:24:05] rather than hey Lord I just want to
[1:24:06] spend some time with you I'd like to
[1:24:08] know if there's anything you need me to
[1:24:09] do today
[1:24:10] who prays like that
[1:24:13] that's why I had to repent to my
[1:24:15] daughter I said I've been praying wrong
[1:24:16] as a family we pray wrong I'm sorry I
[1:24:18] apologize I can't remember the last time
[1:24:20] where I said I gather the family around
[1:24:22] I said Lord let's pray as a family to
[1:24:24] find the will of God for what we're
[1:24:26] supposed to be doing right now Lord
[1:24:28] search our hearts as a family and say
[1:24:29] Lord where do you need me to be what do
[1:24:31] you need me to do is there any place I
[1:24:33] need to go someone I need to talk to is
[1:24:35] there someone I need to help or anything
[1:24:38] I can do for you you know what I'm
[1:24:40] saying it's like God was shocked he
[1:24:43] remembered his promise to me
[1:24:47] said yes Lord I remembered my promise
[1:24:50] and I know that's you I can't see you
[1:24:52] Lord but you're here somewhere I said I
[1:24:55] don't see you but I can hear your voice
[1:24:57] and I know that's you
[1:24:58] said you kept your promise you
[1:25:01] remembered your promise and I'll
[1:25:03] remember mine too I'll never leave you
[1:25:05] and I will never forsake you oh my I
[1:25:08] haven't felt the same ever since I came
[1:25:10] off that mountain all that afternoon
[1:25:12] Vision after Vision taking place I come
[1:25:15] down it seemed like everything was
[1:25:16] different has been different since then
[1:25:18] the burden is all gone
[1:25:21] amen
[1:25:22] my goodness I don't know why it's just
[1:25:25] that really really strikes me
[1:25:27] can we just bow our heads for a word of
[1:25:29] Prayer
[1:25:34] Heavenly Father Lord
[1:25:36] we stand at times at myself Lord I stand
[1:25:40] a little bit ashamed father that you
[1:25:42] could do so much be so much for us show
[1:25:45] us so much truth
[1:25:47] work in our lives in such Supernatural
[1:25:49] ways and then we can forget about you I
[1:25:51] can forget about you so easily the
[1:25:54] busyness of Life the cares of life
[1:25:56] Lord it just has a way of sometimes
[1:25:58] causing us to just drift and Lord I
[1:26:01] don't want to drift I don't think
[1:26:02] anybody in here wants to be drifting
[1:26:04] Lord I want to be found in such a way
[1:26:06] that I'm purposely purposeful living my
[1:26:09] life with a Divine Purpose to see to it
[1:26:12] that I come back into a place in a
[1:26:14] position that I had with you from before
[1:26:16] the foundational world and I don't want
[1:26:18] nothing to take it away from me I don't
[1:26:20] want to problem a situation at work a

[1:26:32] anybody other than me forgive us father

[1:26:41] something may we have an attitude like a
[1:26:44] bride like a wife to a husband she's

[1:27:23] reality to me now Lord I just pray that
[1:27:26] you'd help us Lord anoint us forgive us

[1:27:34] of a lifestyle and an attitude and a
[1:27:36] mindset and father that we can draw
[1:27:38] closer to you Lord we love you we commit
[1:27:41] ourselves to you father search our
[1:27:44] hearts Lord may we make a conscious
[1:27:46] effort to push keep this world at a

[1:28:21] amen

[1:28:28] what you got
[1:28:30] you amen
[1:28:32] only to be one he wants me to be
[1:28:40] every moment of every day
[1:28:48] [Applause]
[1:28:50] yielded completely
[1:28:54] to Jesus
[1:28:56] alone
[1:28:59] every step of this
[1:29:02] [Applause]
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:16] [Applause]
[1:29:18] ready to do what is
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:35] [Music]
[1:29:38] please
[1:29:44] amen how many appreciated the word
[1:29:48] oh were you challenged by it corrected
[1:29:51] by it inspired by it amen the word can
[1:29:55] do all of it in the same sermon amen oh
[1:29:58] I thank God that this path that that
[1:30:00] Brother Kyle was talking about with
[1:30:02] decision and silence and sacrifice we
[1:30:05] get new opportunities every day
[1:30:07] for decisions and opportunities to be
[1:30:10] signed and opportunities to lay down our
[1:30:11] lives and I believe we're going to
[1:30:13] continue to get those until we get this
[1:30:15] lesson right
[1:30:16] that we learn what God wants us to do
[1:30:19] amen I think we're learning that to be
[1:30:22] an overcomer I'm going to have to
[1:30:24] overcome myself
[1:30:26] and to be a conqueror I'm going to have
[1:30:27] to conquer self
[1:30:29] because the great mystery of God was
[1:30:32] unfolded in three folds first to get
[1:30:35] preeminence in a man
[1:30:36] God didn't take that preeminence
[1:30:38] preeminence was willingly given
[1:30:41] second is to get preeminence in a people
[1:30:43] he's doing that now but God's not coming
[1:30:45] and taking
[1:30:47] God's receiving what's given to him
[1:30:50] and we're learning to give him
[1:30:51] preeminence in our decisions in our
[1:30:54] speaking or not speaking in our self
[1:30:58] and that last quote that Brother Kyle
[1:31:00] read it reminded me instantly of
[1:31:01] something brother Bob shared with me and
[1:31:03] I believe if I hope I don't get the
[1:31:05] story wrong because sometimes I get them
[1:31:07] wrong but I believe it was something
[1:31:09] that brother Branham had said to brother
[1:31:10] Lee Vale
[1:31:12] and he said brother Lee have you ever
[1:31:14] done something for God just for God
[1:31:19] all right think about that that's what
[1:31:22] the last quote was about
[1:31:25] have you ever done anything for God just
[1:31:27] for God
[1:31:28] not so that you would have a neat
[1:31:30] testimony to share with somebody later
[1:31:32] not so that you could get credit for
[1:31:34] making the right decision
[1:31:36] Sometimes When We Share testimonies is
[1:31:38] so we can look good
[1:31:40] if we just be honest
[1:31:42] have we ever privately in the privacy of
[1:31:45] Our Own Heart have we ever done
[1:31:46] something for God just only for God
[1:31:50] something that will never be mentioned
[1:31:51] something that will never be known
[1:31:53] something will never be seen but just
[1:31:55] because we loved him
[1:31:57] all right that's what I want to do yes I
[1:32:01] want to know what pleases him and I want
[1:32:02] to do it just for him and I want with
[1:32:04] all that in me to have no ulterior
[1:32:06] motive and sometimes I get so frustrated
[1:32:08] I find ulterior motives and I hate it
[1:32:10] but I want to get to the place where I
[1:32:12] just love him
[1:32:15] because he first loved me
[1:32:19] amen
[1:32:20] think that's what he wants I think
[1:32:22] that's what we want but thank God that's
[1:32:24] what he's growing us into
[1:32:26] everything he's been teaching us
[1:32:28] everything we've been going through it's
[1:32:29] all pointing the same thing this is what
[1:32:31] we're coming to friends
[1:32:33] where we learn to surrender self
[1:32:36] and let him have preeminence where we do
[1:32:39] what we do because we love him
[1:32:42] why do we love him because he first
[1:32:44] loved me
[1:32:46] oh I'm grateful for the word
[1:32:48] so grateful for the opportunity you know
[1:32:51] this is not an easy life and this is not
[1:32:53] an easy age to live in
[1:32:54] I'm so thankful he put me here so I can
[1:32:57] express my love to him
[1:32:58] I'm so thankful I have opportunities to
[1:33:01] express my love to him and that's my
[1:33:03] desire
[1:33:04] to express my love
[1:33:06] amen may God help each one of us and may
[1:33:10] God be glorified
[1:33:11] and all that we say
[1:33:14] amen God bless you brother girl it's
[1:33:17] good to see you here didn't know you
[1:33:19] were coming up but God bless you it's
[1:33:20] good to have you and your wife with us
[1:33:22] and I'm going to ask brother Manuel
[1:33:24] brother man will you come up and just
[1:33:25] say hi to everybody and dismiss us with
