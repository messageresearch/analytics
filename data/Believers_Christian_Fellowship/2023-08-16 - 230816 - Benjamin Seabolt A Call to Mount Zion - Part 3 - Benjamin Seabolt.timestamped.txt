[10:46] [Music]
[10:49] let your spirit
[10:52] move through me Lord's feet to me
[11:01] praise the Lord
[11:03] I believe it was
[11:05] Samuel
[11:07] when the Lord spoke to him
[11:09] then he said here am I Lord I give all
[11:12] myself today I think that's a very
[11:14] scriptural song I'm sure that's each and
[11:16] every one of our hearts desires here
[11:18] this morning this Earth this evening
[11:21] it's just to have him speak to us
[11:23] so that we can reply
[11:25] hear my Lord he's been so kind to us
[11:28] he's been so gracious he's came himself
[11:32] he's literally came himself
[11:35] and given his word to us given himself
[11:38] to us he has come in the form of his
[11:41] word in this age that we live in how can
[11:43] we respond with anything else
[11:46] besides here and my Lord
[11:48] I give all myself to thee
[11:51] let's pray together
[11:53] precious Lord Jesus we
[11:56] are so thankful once again for this
[11:58] opportunity
[12:00] that you've provided to us Lord Lord
[12:03] that we can come in fulfillment of your
[12:05] scriptures and assemble ourselves
[12:07] together
[12:08] Lord that we can come and yield
[12:11] ourselves to you Lord
[12:13] each and every member of the assembly
[12:15] here
[12:17] with our licks of fire lord and the
[12:20] guests that you've placed in each vessel
[12:22] and we can bring those
[12:24] in assembly for your service Lord
[12:28] father we would just ask now that we've
[12:31] done all that we can do
[12:33] Lord mechanically we've
[12:36] put our clothes on we've gotten our
[12:38] vehicles we've drove here Lord
[12:42] father bet
[12:43] the mechanics will never cut it Lord we
[12:46] have to have the Dynamics
[12:49] father and we stand here in humility and
[12:52] humbleness
[12:55] humbled Lord
[12:56] knowing that we can't provide the
[12:59] Dynamics
[13:00] that we are mere mortals and if you
[13:02] don't come and if you don't do something
[13:05] then this will just be a mechanical
[13:07] meeting father
[13:08] [Music]
[13:09] Lord and we it is our prayer here this
[13:12] evening that this would be anything but
[13:14] that father for we desire to have spirit
[13:17] and we desire to have life here
[13:20] so we would ask that you would come now
[13:23] and that you would pick up each and
[13:24] every gift father both speaker and
[13:26] hearer
[13:27] and that you would perform what you've
[13:29] ordained to accomplish for this service
[13:32] and for this time lord we would just
[13:35] bring our pastor and his family up
[13:37] before you at this time as well as
[13:39] they're a way for a period of rest
[13:42] Lord we would ask that your Holy Spirit
[13:44] would just go there and be with each and
[13:45] every one of them Father
[13:47] and that you would be their portion Lord
[13:49] and that you would just minister to them
[13:51] let them have a great time we pray bring
[13:54] them back safely at the appointed time
[13:56] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[13:58] pray the bride says
[14:01] amen God bless you this evening it's so
[14:05] good to be with you if you have your
[14:08] Bibles we're going to go to Hebrews
[14:10] chapter 12.
[14:12] I assure you this is probably or I'm
[14:15] sure this is probably getting very
[14:16] familiar to you
[14:18] but I started preparing a different
[14:22] thought in a different direction and
[14:24] really
[14:25] thought that's what I was going to do
[14:27] and
[14:28] when I really started putting stuff
[14:30] together and preparing it was very clear
[14:32] that that was not the avenue to go with
[14:34] at this point in time so
[14:36] I'll call it apologize in advance if you
[14:39] hear some things that you've heard
[14:40] before
[14:42] um but it is what it is I can't do
[14:45] anything different without inspiration
[14:46] I'm literally just a pile of dirt
[14:49] standing here so obviously there's
[14:52] something here that he wants us to hear
[14:54] again and there is some new stuff here
[14:55] so it won't all be boring to you but uh
[14:59] there is some rehashing to do I I
[15:02] believe but uh it's good to be with you
[15:05] I do want to take a moment and thank all
[15:07] of those that have assisted during the
[15:09] birth of our little girl all those
[15:12] that's provided food we certainly
[15:14] appreciate that and have enjoyed that we
[15:17] especially appreciate those that took
[15:20] their lives into their own hands and
[15:23] babysitted my three little boys during
[15:24] that time
[15:26] so it's a real real soldiers there
[15:30] but we just appreciate it and if we have
[15:34] any visitors I apologize but I did just
[15:36] have a little baby girl last week so
[15:40] you can refer to me as not brother
[15:43] Benjamin anymore but if you would like
[15:46] to refer to me as father of the world's
[15:48] most beautiful little girl that will be
[15:50] perfectly fine with me and everybody
[15:52] will understand I'm sure it might be
[15:54] slightly biased but I'm pretty sure it's
[15:57] factual somewhere down along there
[16:00] God bless you we certainly appreciate
[16:02] you let's go to Hebrews chapter 12
[16:05] before I really make a fool out of
[16:07] myself
[16:09] beginning in verse 1 says wherefore seen
[16:13] we also are compassed about with so
[16:15] great a cloud of witness
[16:17] let us lay aside every weight in the Sin
[16:20] which doth so easily beset us and let us
[16:24] run with patience the race that is set
[16:26] before us
[16:27] looking unto Jesus the author and
[16:30] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[16:33] that was set before him endured the
[16:34] cross despising the shame and is set
[16:37] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[16:39] God
[16:41] let's get down to verse 18.
[16:44] he says for ye are not come unto the
[16:47] mount that might be touched
[16:49] and that burned with fire
[16:52] nor unto Blackness and darkest and
[16:54] Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and
[16:56] the voice of orange Words which voice
[17:00] they that heard and treated that the
[17:02] word should not be spoken to them
[17:04] anymore obviously referring to Israel at
[17:07] Mount Sinai
[17:09] for they could not endure that which was
[17:13] commanded
[17:14] and if so much as a beast touched the
[17:17] mountain it shall be stoned or thrust
[17:19] through with a dart
[17:21] and so terrible was the sight that Moses
[17:23] said I exceedingly fear and Quake
[17:26] so Paul says you're not called to that
[17:29] but verse 22 ye are come unto Mount Zion
[17:34] and unto the city of the Living God the
[17:37] heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable
[17:39] company of angels to the general
[17:42] assembly and Church of the firstborn
[17:44] which are written in heaven and to God
[17:46] the judge of all and to the spirits of
[17:49] just men made perfect
[17:52] and to Jesus the mediator of the New
[17:55] Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[17:57] that speaketh better things than that of
[18:00] Abel God bless you as you would take
[18:02] your seats so Paul is
[18:05] very clearly laying out to us that we
[18:08] are not called to Natural things that we
[18:12] are called to spiritual things and we as
[18:16] Gentiles know that we are a spiritual
[18:18] people compared to the Jews who are of
[18:22] very natural people
[18:23] natural numbers natural tribes natural
[18:26] land
[18:27] not so for the gentile people we are a
[18:30] spiritual Kingdom
[18:32] brother Branham
[18:34] um preached a message things that are to
[18:36] be and I've referred to that a lot and
[18:39] will refer to that during this service
[18:43] but my base inspiration for this little
[18:46] series here was as I was listening to
[18:49] things that are to be it struck me that
[18:51] during the course of that message you
[18:53] have a major end time Prophet standing
[18:56] on the earth and he's preaching a
[18:58] prophetic message of things that are to
[19:00] be
[19:02] but yet he does not reference one single
[19:06] natural thing
[19:07] everything that he speaks about is in
[19:10] the spiritual dimension
[19:12] and to me that's extremely striking in
[19:15] it it's extremely significant and it it
[19:19] tells within itself what type of people
[19:22] we should be because we know that we can
[19:25] be nothing outside of the word that God
[19:28] has sent to us that came through our
[19:30] messenger so if our messenger is picking
[19:33] up that word and he's picking up that
[19:34] inspiration from God and he is coming
[19:37] with nothing but spiritual applications
[19:40] of things that are to be
[19:43] I think then we should be a spiritual
[19:45] people and not a natural people
[19:48] it doesn't mean that we're not going to
[19:50] be affected by natural things we
[19:52] understand we're still in a fallen
[19:53] hybrid condition things are going to be
[19:56] around us trying to have an effect on us
[19:58] but we should be able to be a spiritual
[20:00] people and rise above that
[20:03] and that's what Paul is referring to
[20:04] here he's he's referring to you're not
[20:06] called to Natural things as the
[20:08] scripture says we wrestle not against
[20:10] flesh and blood but against spiritual
[20:12] principalities
[20:14] so that's where our focus is here
[20:17] and that's what we want to hold in our
[20:19] mind that we are called to a spiritual
[20:22] position brother Branham says in the
[20:24] church age book the second Forerunner of
[20:27] Christ will sow for the latter Reign
[20:29] Jesus will be the showdown between the
[20:33] denominations and Creeds for he will
[20:36] come to back up his word and take his
[20:38] bride in the Rapture so how is Christ
[20:41] going to back up his word he's going to
[20:43] take his bride in a rapture
[20:45] you can argue and fuss about it all you
[20:47] want you can debate and stew about it
[20:48] all you want at the end of the day God
[20:51] will come
[20:53] and show who is who and what is truth
[20:56] and what is error
[20:58] he says the first Showdown was Mount
[21:00] Carmel this that was a natural Showdown
[21:03] the second was Mount Transfiguration
[21:06] also a natural Showdown the third will
[21:09] be Mount Zion
[21:11] spiritual Showdown
[21:13] we understand that that rolls over into
[21:16] natural manifestations we would not
[21:18] dispute that that's clearly taunting the
[21:20] message but it starts with a spiritual
[21:23] application it must start spiritually
[21:27] brother random says in the Third Exodus
[21:29] there's coming in Exodus where God will
[21:32] show who is who where the church itself
[21:35] the Bride of Jesus Christ will be exited
[21:38] out into the land that's promised in my
[21:42] father's house are many mansions in this
[21:45] place you don't have to go there and
[21:47] fight like they did speaking of Israel
[21:49] it's already prepared if this Earthly
[21:52] Tabernacle dwelling be dissolved we have
[21:56] one already waiting so he immediately
[21:58] goes back to John 14.
[22:00] quoting that scripture and tying that
[22:02] together
[22:03] that where I am their ye will be also he
[22:07] says the great Exodus at hand this great
[22:12] Exodus is going to consist of God coming
[22:14] and showing who is who by removing his
[22:18] bride from the Earth
[22:20] brother Reynolds says in Fellowship 1955
[22:22] I've never believed that heaven was a
[22:24] place where there's a bunch of buildings
[22:26] where there's a bunch of houses there
[22:28] made with mortar dobbed up with paper
[22:30] pain on the wall I've never believed
[22:32] that a supernatural being would have to
[22:33] live in a literal house I believe when
[22:36] Jesus spoke in John 14 said in my
[22:38] father's house as many mansions he meant
[22:41] a body a dwelling place for the
[22:44] scriptures verify the same thing and say
[22:46] if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved
[22:49] we have one already waiting you see it
[22:52] mortal beings is the only one who lives
[22:55] in mortal habitations
[22:57] Immortal beings live in Immortal
[23:00] habitations then the place that we go
[23:03] into until we return back is not a place
[23:06] of brick and mortar and clay or precious
[23:08] stones and jewels it's a place of
[23:11] condition
[23:14] it's a place of condition
[23:17] I'll give you a little hint you do not
[23:19] have to wait for that
[23:21] you have the full word delivered to you
[23:24] with Supernatural Vindication to allow
[23:27] you entrance into this condition if you
[23:30] so desire
[23:32] it's a place of condition that we move
[23:35] out of this Dimension that we live in
[23:37] into another dimension
[23:41] you can be caught up you do not have to
[23:44] wait for that
[23:45] there is a spiritual catching away
[23:48] before there is a natural catching away
[23:49] and you absolutely have the authority of
[23:52] God to do that
[23:56] Jesus said destroy this Temple and I'll
[23:58] raise it up in three days and they
[24:00] thought he was speaking of Solomon's
[24:02] Temple but he was speaking of his own
[24:03] body he has gone to prepare a place for
[24:07] every believer that the very moment we
[24:09] step out of these mortal regions we
[24:11] don't go out into myth or some
[24:13] Supernatural Spirit but we go into a
[24:16] tabernacle a dwelling place and that
[24:19] might be right here in this building
[24:21] this morning
[24:23] so let's not put it off any farther than
[24:25] what he says we have to it might be
[24:28] right here in this building this evening
[24:31] that dwelling place that Tabernacle that
[24:34] condition that is available to you to be
[24:38] caught up in a raptured state
[24:41] it might be right here in this building
[24:43] this evening he said in a place that no
[24:46] other radio activity or nothing can
[24:49] touch
[24:50] back to things that are to be brother
[24:51] Branham says that's where we are just in
[24:54] case you thought I was out on a limb
[24:56] that's where we are we have become from
[25:00] Mortal beings from time beings to
[25:03] Eternal beings
[25:05] how did we become that
[25:09] by holding our breath and wishing a
[25:12] fairy dust
[25:14] by our own merits
[25:16] we have become that through the
[25:19] Deliverance of the word that has been
[25:21] given to us the full manifestation of
[25:24] Christ himself brother Rayner says we
[25:26] don't look for nail prints we look for
[25:29] the word made manifest and where the
[25:32] word is made manifest you have the
[25:35] opportunity to move dimensions and go
[25:39] from Immortal to or I'm sorry to go from
[25:42] Mortal to immortal
[25:44] he says we have become that
[25:48] have become that
[25:51] First Corinthians 2 12 says now we have
[25:55] received not the spirit of the world but
[25:58] the spirit which is of god that we might
[26:00] know the things that are freely given to
[26:01] us of God
[26:03] which things also we speak not in The
[26:06] Words which which man's Wisdom teacheth
[26:09] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth
[26:11] comparing spiritual things with
[26:14] spiritual
[26:15] so this is a principle that even the
[26:17] first church age Messenger to the
[26:19] Gentiles was laying down don't be
[26:21] comparing natural with natural
[26:23] compare spiritual things with spiritual
[26:26] things in the unveiling of God brother
[26:28] Branham said it was so great till even
[26:30] Moses Moses feared the Quake then if at
[26:34] that time he shook just the mountain
[26:36] this time he'll Shake heavens and earth
[26:39] what about this Glory if that was veiled
[26:43] by a natural Veil this is veiled by a
[26:45] spiritual Veil
[26:46] so don't try to look at the natural
[26:49] break into the spirit and see where
[26:52] you're at
[26:54] see what hour we're living in and once
[26:57] again we have that opportunity this
[26:59] evening we do not have to wait for that
[27:01] we have the full word delivered to us
[27:03] right in front of us even in print form
[27:05] that we can look into the word and see
[27:09] where you're at
[27:10] not geographically on a map
[27:13] but look at where you're at the same way
[27:16] Adam had to look where he was at when
[27:19] God Came Calling for him Adam Adam Where
[27:22] Art Thou he's asking the same question
[27:24] this evening through his revealed word
[27:26] he's laid it right before our wandering
[27:29] eyes and he said where are you
[27:32] where are you
[27:35] we have that opportunity this evening
[27:37] but it's not a natural comparison it's a
[27:41] spiritual application it's a spiritual
[27:43] comparison
[27:45] brother Branham said and things that
[27:47] ought to be are to be and last night
[27:49] speaking over in Yuma for the Christian
[27:51] business man I spoke on the subject of
[27:53] the Rapture now that might have been a
[27:56] strange subject to speak at a banquet
[27:58] but most everyone there was Christians
[28:00] and so if we're Christians I think we
[28:03] ought to be kindly notified ahead and I
[28:06] want to speak on that tonight and the
[28:08] subject is going to be things that are
[28:10] to be and now speaking last night on The
[28:13] Rapture so tonight I want to speak on
[28:15] this subject that I might tie it
[28:18] together with last night's message I
[28:20] think this is extremely important to
[28:21] realize that brother Branham is tying
[28:23] these two things together when he is
[28:25] preaching on things that are to be he
[28:27] says that's my subject but what I want
[28:29] to preach on is what I preached on last
[28:31] night the rapture
[28:33] one in the same thing things that are to
[28:36] be will put you in a raptured condition
[28:40] his scripture for that service obviously
[28:42] was John 14 I'm going to read this very
[28:44] briefly he says let not your heart be
[28:47] troubled ye believe in God believe also
[28:50] in me in my father's house are many
[28:53] mansions if it were not so I would have
[28:55] told you I go to prepare a place for you
[28:59] so if you have heart trouble this
[29:01] evening
[29:02] or maybe some mind trouble
[29:06] he says don't let that be
[29:09] don't let that be the case
[29:13] in my father's house are many mansions
[29:17] I'm telling you Saints in my father's
[29:20] house are many mansions that revelation
[29:22] will solve a lot of your heart trouble
[29:24] maybe even all of your heart trouble
[29:27] and it will certainly solve a lot of
[29:29] your mind trouble
[29:32] I am not sure that there's a trouble on
[29:34] the face of this Earth that can Trump
[29:35] the Revelation in my father's house are
[29:37] many mansions and one of them is mine
[29:41] and that's not made of brick and stone
[29:43] in my father's house is my body
[29:47] and if my body is in my father's house
[29:50] come what may
[29:52] I'll say as Jesus said destroy this
[29:54] Temple
[29:56] in less than three days I'll raise it up
[30:00] don't let your heart be troubled Saints
[30:02] don't compare natural things with
[30:04] natural
[30:06] be caught up
[30:07] compare spiritual things with spiritual
[30:09] things
[30:10] verse 3 and if I go and prepare a place
[30:13] for you I will come again and receive
[30:14] you unto myself that where I am there ye
[30:17] may be also and whether I go ye know and
[30:20] the way you know Thomas saith unto him
[30:23] Lord we know not whether thou goest and
[30:25] how can we know the way Jesus saith unto
[30:28] him
[30:29] I am the way
[30:32] the truth
[30:33] and the life
[30:35] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[30:38] so have we or have we not had the full
[30:41] truth delivered to us in this day
[30:44] if we've had the full truth delivered
[30:48] we've had the full way delivered
[30:50] and we've had the full life delivered
[30:52] because he says I am
[30:55] I am the truth
[30:58] the way
[31:00] and the life
[31:02] I'm grateful that we have that I'm
[31:04] grateful that we do not have to stumble
[31:06] in darkness
[31:07] I am grateful that we have the answer to
[31:09] the devil's question you say what
[31:11] question the question what question any
[31:13] question I have the answer to the
[31:15] devil's question well what's the answer
[31:17] to in my father's house are many
[31:20] mansions
[31:22] he has went and prepared a place for me
[31:24] and I know that he has went and prepared
[31:26] to prepare a place for me because he has
[31:29] been so gracious to send me a prophet in
[31:32] this last stage to send me a prophet to
[31:36] tell me
[31:38] I am the way
[31:39] this is the truth This Is The Life
[31:43] and the church age brother Branham said
[31:46] you had better come before it's too late
[31:48] and this is the quote that we really
[31:50] emphasized last service but I just want
[31:52] to read this and then we're going to
[31:53] move on to some
[31:54] some other things
[31:57] because we can
[31:59] we can preach that Revelation you know
[32:01] predestinated for known of God before
[32:04] the foundation of the world I mean you
[32:06] all know all the cliches if you've been
[32:07] around for more than six months
[32:10] we can preach that and we can stand on
[32:12] our head and bubble dance and do
[32:14] whatever else we want to do
[32:15] but unless the rubber meets the road
[32:17] it's going to come to not it's just
[32:19] intellectual
[32:22] brother Rayner says you had better come
[32:25] before it's too late saith the Lord and
[32:27] byeth me gold tried in the fire and then
[32:29] you will truly be rich are we getting it
[32:32] listen to me naked physically we come
[32:36] into the world but naked spiritually we
[32:39] will not leave it
[32:40] so all of those things are true we are
[32:42] predestinated we are foreknown we were
[32:45] attributes in the mind of God
[32:48] but until that becomes manifestation and
[32:51] until that become there is a way that
[32:52] that becomes in manifestation and there
[32:55] is a way that that comes in reality
[32:58] and we have to understand how that works
[33:00] or we're going to fail the test
[33:04] it says spiritually we will not leave it
[33:06] all know we are going to take something
[33:08] with us what that something is is all
[33:11] that we can take with us nothing less
[33:15] and nothing more
[33:17] so we had better be real careful now to
[33:19] see that we take something that will
[33:21] make us right before God so then what
[33:24] will we take with us we will take our
[33:27] character brother that is what we will
[33:30] take with us now what kind of character
[33:32] will you take with you will it be like
[33:34] his whose character was molded by
[33:37] suffering in the fiery furnace of
[33:38] Affliction or will it be with the
[33:40] softness of this character less
[33:42] laodicean people
[33:44] it is up to each one of us for in that
[33:48] day every man will bear his own burden
[33:52] one thing that you can take with you
[33:55] when you leave this earth
[33:56] character
[33:58] why was this full word delivered to us
[34:02] one reason character development
[34:06] it wasn't so that we could bubble dance
[34:08] and I don't have anything against bubble
[34:10] dancing
[34:11] or feeling good or even the cliches I
[34:14] like the cliches
[34:16] but at the end of the day we have to
[34:19] come to terms the fact and the reality
[34:23] and the reason that this full word was
[34:26] delivered for us was character
[34:28] development
[34:33] if we miss character development we've
[34:35] missed the point of the message
[34:38] direct quote brother Branham says if you
[34:41] miss that life you will not come up
[34:43] anyhow
[34:45] so it doesn't matter what doctrines you
[34:48] believe or what doctrines you can
[34:50] explain or what you can tie it together
[34:51] he says if you miss the life the
[34:55] character of the message you won't come
[34:58] up anyhow
[34:59] that's how important it is how many
[35:01] wants to come up
[35:04] we must have character
[35:08] but God is so gracious to his Saints
[35:10] because he's made a requirement he's
[35:11] made a requirement for that character
[35:13] but he's provided the way to have that
[35:15] character
[35:17] so yes he's made a requirement and it's
[35:19] it's a stiff requirement in fact the
[35:21] requirement is perfection
[35:25] but he delivered a perfect word
[35:28] praise the Lord
[35:30] brother Raynham says
[35:31] faith is the substance and I would love
[35:34] to be there tonight speaking of his
[35:35] house many of you know what it is to be
[35:37] away from home don't you say it's just a
[35:40] little Shack but it doesn't take a big
[35:42] house to make a home it's the character
[35:44] on the inside
[35:46] that makes a home
[35:47] not talking about brick and mortar
[35:49] remember what we started out with
[35:51] compare spiritual things with spiritual
[35:52] things
[35:54] it's the character on the inside
[35:58] that makes a home
[36:00] I can say I believe this message
[36:04] I can say God sent a prophet I can say a
[36:07] lot of things
[36:10] what does my character say
[36:14] it's the character on the inside that
[36:16] makes the home
[36:18] God hiding himself in Simplicity brother
[36:20] Branham says now I think it's our duty
[36:22] to make the inside right by the grace of
[36:24] God to be so grateful to God that this
[36:26] will not only be a beautiful building
[36:29] that will come to but may everyone who
[36:31] comes in see the beautiful
[36:32] characteristics of Jesus Christ and
[36:34] every person that comes in may it be a
[36:37] consecrated place to our Lord at
[36:39] consecrated people for no matter how
[36:42] beautiful the structure is that we
[36:44] certainly do appreciate the beauty of
[36:47] the church is the
[36:49] character of the people
[36:54] brother Branham says in the church age
[36:55] book a crown is given to the winner of
[36:58] the Olympic race
[37:00] it was a Garland of olive branches but
[37:04] the crown spoke of here in Revelation
[37:06] given to the Martyr is the crown of
[37:09] royalty
[37:11] Jesus calls it the Crown of Life
[37:14] the one Crown is for those who have
[37:17] striven
[37:19] the other is for those who have given
[37:22] both crowns are incorruptible
[37:28] how many would literally give their life
[37:31] for this gospel that's been presented to
[37:32] us in this last end time age
[37:36] many would literally do that
[37:39] but brother Branham is saying here that
[37:40] you can
[37:43] so how many of us have declared that
[37:45] we'd give our life's blood for this
[37:46] message but brother Branham is saying
[37:48] you got the choice you can do it right
[37:50] now he says this Crown is for those who
[37:53] have given given their lives literally
[37:55] in martyrdom
[37:57] but there's also a crown for those that
[37:58] have striven
[38:00] each and every day
[38:02] in giving their life for this gospel
[38:06] he says they will not perish the winners
[38:10] of the worldly race of life will soon
[38:12] lose the joy of the Praise of the world
[38:14] their Glory will fail but those who give
[38:18] their life for God
[38:20] either by daily striving
[38:23] or shedding their blood as the crowning
[38:26] sacrifice of their lives will be given
[38:29] the crown of God what a concept
[38:33] that those who would literally have to
[38:35] give their life
[38:36] like those that have gone on before us
[38:39] in the Dark Ages
[38:40] they have literally given their life for
[38:43] the gospel
[38:44] and he's saying that I can receive the
[38:46] same reward They Do by simply dying
[38:49] daily spiritually as Paul taught us
[38:53] same Crown same reward
[38:56] for a spiritual death to self and taking
[38:59] of the word
[39:01] all too little time is spent on laboring
[39:04] for the Eternal rewards of God
[39:07] the recompense of God is too lightly
[39:11] esteemed
[39:13] if we believe in the reality of the
[39:16] resurrection of the body how many
[39:17] believe in the reality of the
[39:19] resurrection of the body
[39:21] you've put yourself on the hook now if
[39:24] you believe in the reality of the
[39:27] resurrection of the body and an internal
[39:30] Kingdom of substance how many believe in
[39:32] an internal Kingdom of substance
[39:37] then we ought to lay up in heaven those
[39:40] good Treasures that are available to the
[39:42] faithful Saints so if you believe in a
[39:45] physical resurrection and you believe in
[39:47] a physical Kingdom he says you ought to
[39:49] lay up spiritual Treasures
[39:52] if you believe in those two things
[39:55] all too little time is given for the
[39:57] things of God and the recompensers of
[39:59] God it's too lightly esteemed he says if
[40:03] we believe in a physical Kingdom with
[40:05] physical Rewards
[40:06] we should lay up Treasures
[40:09] there where we can get them
[40:16] you say well what should I lay up there
[40:19] according to the prophet there's only
[40:20] one thing you can lay up there
[40:24] and it's not good works
[40:26] to your neighbor
[40:27] telling your neighbor you love them
[40:30] character
[40:32] that could be part of it I don't deny
[40:34] that
[40:35] but it's not just being a good person
[40:36] Saints it's not just saying God sent a
[40:38] prophet I believe the message
[40:40] if you truly believe in a physical
[40:41] Resurrection in a physical Kingdom he
[40:44] says you ought to believe in spiritual
[40:46] Treasures
[40:48] and that spiritual treasure is your
[40:50] character
[40:52] so you have this character but what do
[40:54] you do with this character
[40:56] how do you lay Treasures up in heaven
[40:58] we're going to get to that here in a
[41:00] minute
[41:01] Matthew 6 says lay not up for yourself
[41:03] Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust
[41:06] doth corrupt and where thieves break in
[41:08] and break through and steal but lay up
[41:11] for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where
[41:13] neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and
[41:16] where thieves do not break in nor steal
[41:19] so now
[41:21] by the prophet we understand what
[41:23] Matthew's talking about here or what
[41:25] Christ is talking about here in Matthew
[41:27] when he says lay up for yourself
[41:29] Treasures in Heaven we have this
[41:31] interpreted because now we don't have to
[41:34] wonder well what treasure should I be
[41:36] packing up there you know how big should
[41:37] my pockets be do I need a forklift or a
[41:39] dump truck
[41:42] Lay Up character in heaven where it
[41:45] can't be corrupted
[41:49] don't think of Heaven somewhere way up
[41:52] here
[41:55] lay up Treasures in Heaven
[42:00] where your character's at
[42:02] lay up Treasures in Heaven
[42:06] where moths can't corrupt it
[42:09] where somebody can't break in and steal
[42:11] it
[42:13] somebody can break in and steal it up
[42:15] here
[42:17] there's people out there that somebody
[42:18] can talk you into it and somebody else
[42:20] can talk you out of it
[42:21] you take somebody that's really sharp
[42:23] intellectually they can talk you in
[42:25] things and out of things Saints I've sat
[42:27] in the courtroom before and watched
[42:29] somebody that I know is guilty as Sin
[42:32] and I will have an attorney say this and
[42:34] here comes the defense attorney and says
[42:36] this and I'm sitting there wondering
[42:39] maybe he's not guilty
[42:42] that that
[42:44] intellectual spirit is that powerful
[42:49] I've said in courtrooms to where it has
[42:51] literally came down to the last person
[42:53] to have something to say
[42:55] and that's the way things fall
[42:58] because the intellectual battle up here
[43:02] can go back and forth back and forth
[43:04] back and forth
[43:07] you can see a video of a criminal doing
[43:10] something that is cut and dried black
[43:13] and white and you can have somebody with
[43:15] that sharp intellectual Spirit come in
[43:17] and convince you
[43:19] that that really wasn't them or they
[43:21] really didn't mean it or there's some
[43:22] other reason that they did it
[43:25] that's why he says don't lay up don't
[43:28] lay up Treasures where somebody can get
[43:31] to them somebody can get to your mind
[43:33] Saints how many people have we how many
[43:35] people have we seen I don't even have to
[43:37] say it that way how many times have we
[43:39] experienced being wrong in our mind
[43:43] how many times have we experienced
[43:46] somebody leading us astray
[43:51] but how many times
[43:53] have we had that little buzzer that
[43:55] brother Brandon referred to in our heart
[43:57] that that looks good and that sounds
[44:00] right and I even agree with that but
[44:05] something just doesn't
[44:07] I don't know
[44:09] brother Branham says don't you ever
[44:12] ignore that he says that is what the
[44:15] Holy Spirit was given to you for to keep
[44:18] you away from that stuff
[44:21] it may convince you up here
[44:23] don't ever disregard what's laid in
[44:26] Heavenly places
[44:28] and protect what you put in Heavenly
[44:31] places because ultimately it's going to
[44:33] have the final say so
[44:35] Jesus says lay up not for yourself
[44:37] Treasures on Earth lay up for yourself
[44:39] Treasures in Heaven for where your
[44:42] treasure is there will be your heart
[44:46] also
[44:47] Colossians 3 if ye be risen with Christ
[44:51] seek those things which are above
[44:54] not on things on earth
[44:58] this principle is through the entire
[45:01] scriptures
[45:02] get your eyes off a natural get your
[45:05] eyes on spiritual
[45:07] Eternal things
[45:09] 63 the evening messenger brother Branham
[45:11] says Ellie's are sweet sweated it out
[45:14] until he found character that's right
[45:16] who would he get and he trusted God
[45:19] character for what character for Isaac
[45:22] the bride which was a type of the church
[45:25] you know that that was the natural Seed
[45:27] of Abraham this is the Royal Seed of
[45:30] Abraham well if Ellie either the
[45:33] messenger hunting the bride and trying
[45:34] to find character if that man has come
[45:38] a messenger of the last day trying to
[45:41] find the bride for Jesus how many
[45:43] believe we've seen that messenger
[45:46] he will not look for a denominational
[45:48] membership he will look for character
[45:52] that's willing
[45:55] a willing character
[45:57] watch good character first then to get
[46:02] her ready to meet Isaac I'm going to
[46:05] repeat that good character first then
[46:09] prepare her to get ready to meet Isaac
[46:12] as if if this sounds familiar it's
[46:15] because our pastor just preached on this
[46:16] it it's good that it sounds familiar
[46:19] but like I said I can't help the
[46:21] direction that I've got to go
[46:24] good character first
[46:27] then
[46:29] get her ready to meet Isaac and this is
[46:32] what my main thrust is for this evening
[46:35] is there are two parts to this just as
[46:38] our pastor preached it there's two parts
[46:40] to that
[46:42] there are two parts
[46:44] to this things that are to be
[46:47] there are two parts to this experience
[46:50] with Christ
[46:52] there are two parts to your Earthly
[46:54] pilgrimage
[46:56] God has got to come and find you
[47:01] without Christ coming on the scene and
[47:04] revealing his word to you you don't
[47:07] stand a chance and I don't stand a
[47:08] chance
[47:10] he has got to come and find his
[47:13] character
[47:14] here on Earth
[47:15] and that character is in his Saints
[47:18] but once he does find that character
[47:23] I'll speak for myself he has a whole lot
[47:25] of work to do to prepare that character
[47:27] to meet Isaac
[47:33] after he found the character then get
[47:36] her to stand still long enough to listen
[47:39] to his message of Isaac
[47:43] that's the message of the last days the
[47:46] evening light
[47:47] is first find the church where they will
[47:50] believe the message
[47:52] hunt that church down
[47:55] can you read what I'm talking about he
[47:57] says
[47:59] hunt where that church is that'll even
[48:01] let you come in that won't close the
[48:03] door in your face
[48:05] and then when you do that that then you
[48:08] found character there
[48:10] now if she will stand still long enough
[48:13] to tell her how that bride's got to be
[48:17] dressed she's got to be closed stand
[48:20] still
[48:25] this message
[48:27] is the exact opposite message
[48:31] that the laodicean churches preach
[48:33] because the laodicean churches preach
[48:36] everything but stand still and let him
[48:39] work on you
[48:44] in fact they can't stand it if you stand
[48:47] still
[48:50] if there's not a rock concert going on
[48:54] and a bunch of hoopla going on or as
[48:57] brother Branham says a bunch of
[48:58] Hollywood evangelism going on
[49:00] the laodicean church will not stand for
[49:02] it
[49:04] but brother Branham says stand still now
[49:06] I'm not against those things you all
[49:08] know me better than that I have no
[49:09] issues with emotion
[49:11] actually I take that back I do have
[49:12] issues with emotion I have issues I do
[49:17] not have issues with stimulation by
[49:19] revelation
[49:20] I have zero issues with that whether
[49:22] that's in a song service or in the
[49:24] preaching of the word or when you come
[49:26] through the vestibule and you see the
[49:28] world's newest daddy the world's
[49:30] beautifulest little girl whatever
[49:32] expression it comes in
[49:34] I have no problem with stimulation by
[49:36] regulation you say well how is that
[49:38] stimulation by Revelation because the
[49:39] doctors told me I could never have that
[49:41] little girl told my wife we could never
[49:43] have that little girl
[49:44] or then three little hoodlums running
[49:46] around with her
[49:51] that is stimulation by Revelation and it
[49:55] comes with emotion so I have no issues
[49:57] with emotion so long as the abasis
[50:00] is a stimulation by Revelation and that
[50:03] is what the church in laodicea will keep
[50:06] you from and they will cover that up
[50:09] with emotionalism
[50:11] so they don't want you to stand still
[50:13] long enough to get stimulated by
[50:15] revelation
[50:19] brother Brandon says stand still
[50:22] and get dressed by the word
[50:27] stand still
[50:30] and let the message dress you
[50:34] if we're to lay up character in Heavenly
[50:37] places there is only one Avenue that we
[50:39] have to do that and that is through the
[50:41] message of this hour
[50:43] but we have to stand still and let him
[50:47] do his job
[50:50] in identification brother Brandon says
[50:52] and now being that we have identified
[50:53] ourselves as Full Gospel people let's
[50:56] mold our character
[50:58] this is the second part of the two parts
[51:01] we have character
[51:03] if you didn't have character you would
[51:05] never even stand still long enough to
[51:08] hear about this message
[51:10] you would just dismiss it and go on
[51:13] but because we do have character it will
[51:15] catch our attention
[51:17] and now the second part of that brother
[51:19] Branham is now teaching us is to stand
[51:21] still
[51:23] let's mold our character
[51:26] we're invited to be molded in His image
[51:28] that we might reflect his presence The
[51:30] Works that I do shall you do also the
[51:33] life that I live so shall you
[51:36] we're invited by God to take him as an
[51:40] example and let our character be molded
[51:42] like his what a thing then when we let
[51:46] his character be in US
[51:49] then we have become Sons
[51:53] by having the mind of Christ
[51:56] his mind which is his character
[52:02] well what is his mind his word
[52:05] what is his character his word what do
[52:07] we have available to us the mind of
[52:09] Christ in so much that we would have a
[52:12] prophet walk behind the platform and say
[52:13] what I want to speak on this morning is
[52:15] what Christ had in the back part of his
[52:19] mind before the foundation of the world
[52:24] what a statement to make
[52:27] what a statement to back up
[52:30] but he did it
[52:33] the reason he did it
[52:35] was so our character could be molded
[52:38] not by natural influences but by
[52:41] Heavenly influences
[52:43] perfect strength my perfect weakness
[52:45] brother Branham says and that's the way
[52:46] God wants us to realize that we are
[52:49] totally insufficient
[52:51] then
[52:53] so we got the first part right
[52:55] totally insufficient
[52:57] that's the character he's looking for
[53:00] because when this message comes your way
[53:02] how many of you realize you were totally
[53:04] insufficient
[53:07] totally and
[53:09] then God takes that person and begins to
[53:12] mold himself into that person to make
[53:15] his hands do what God would have his
[53:17] hands do make his lips speak where God's
[53:20] lips would speak because they're not his
[53:22] they're Gods
[53:26] that's physical
[53:29] the spiritual
[53:30] becomes physical
[53:33] now your lips are not your lips they're
[53:36] God's lips what a thought
[53:39] what a responsibility
[53:42] how many statements from this past week
[53:43] do we need to go and retract now
[53:50] I'm guilty just like the rest of you but
[53:53] that's the message Saints
[53:56] that's the reality of the message
[54:00] the scripture says we're going to answer
[54:02] for every word that we say out of a
[54:06] business outside of the appropriate
[54:08] business for I can't think of the word
[54:10] that I'm thinking that I'm needing to
[54:12] use right now but every frivolous word
[54:15] that we use and speak and talk about the
[54:18] scripture says in brother Brandon
[54:19] preaches we will have to give an account
[54:20] for that
[54:23] why
[54:24] because my lips are not my lips and my
[54:28] lips right here and my tongue do not
[54:31] have the freedom to speak anything they
[54:34] want to speak they were purchased by the
[54:36] blood of Jesus Christ my lips have
[54:39] become God's lips
[54:43] you say well that's getting pretty
[54:45] serious
[54:47] I just I'm just reading you what he said
[54:50] your lips become his lips I mean we can
[54:54] say his feet but our feet is his feet
[54:56] right
[54:57] our hands are his hands we can say that
[54:59] right why can't we say his lips are my
[55:01] lip or my lips are his lips
[55:04] why because the spirit of the age
[55:06] brother Branham says it's Frolic and
[55:08] joking
[55:10] I'm going to get back to my notes before
[55:11] I get on that
[55:14] he says that's the spirit of laodicean
[55:17] entertainment
[55:18] Spirits frolic
[55:21] and joking he says that's not only the
[55:23] spirit of lyric seeing that's the spirit
[55:24] of America
[55:26] how much more do we have to watch
[55:28] against that I say Lord have mercy on me
[55:32] Lord have mercy on me my lips are his
[55:35] lips
[55:36] he begins to build character
[55:40] things that are to be he says just as
[55:42] soon as it's born the Breath of Life
[55:44] comes into it speaking of a baby and God
[55:46] breathes in it there and it becomes a
[55:48] living Soul now just as this baby is
[55:51] being born then the spiritual body is
[55:54] there to receive it and now when this
[55:57] body is dropped here this earth like the
[56:00] baby is dropped also there is an
[56:02] immortal body waiting to receive the
[56:04] spirit back into itself again I labored
[56:07] on this last time I'm going to go fairly
[56:08] quickly through this because I know you
[56:10] all have got this principle
[56:12] but he says now stop a minute why do we
[56:15] have revivals why do we assemble
[56:18] ourselves together why am I always
[56:20] rebuking the people
[56:21] why does the Holy Spirit keep crying out
[56:24] it knows there's something lacking there
[56:28] because remember there's two parts to
[56:30] this walk there's two parts to this
[56:31] experience one is the character and the
[56:34] character is there but the Holy Spirit
[56:37] knows that there's something lacking
[56:38] there
[56:41] brother man says why do I keep preaching
[56:44] why do I keep rebuking the people why do
[56:45] we come to church
[56:47] is because we're molding that character
[56:49] we are molding that body did Jesus go to
[56:53] prepare it absolutely is it there
[56:55] absolutely is it it is it Eternal in the
[56:58] heavens absolutely does it need a
[57:01] character to go into it absolutely
[57:04] and that's why we're here now
[57:07] that part is not in question
[57:10] it's this part that is in question and I
[57:13] won't even say that it's in question
[57:15] it's this part that is being worked out
[57:18] that is being molded to fit into that
[57:22] as the scripture says this the spirit is
[57:25] willing but the flesh is weak
[57:28] your Eternal Body in the heavens is
[57:31] willing
[57:34] but the flesh is weak
[57:37] our spirit and our character needs
[57:40] molded to fit into that image
[57:43] we're going to get to that here in just
[57:44] a little bit
[57:48] there is an immortal body there waiting
[57:50] to receive the spirit back into itself
[57:53] again and I know I told you that last
[57:55] service but I just loved that part to
[57:58] receive it back
[58:01] into itself again
[58:03] if it goes back
[58:06] into that being
[58:08] that means it had to have been there
[58:10] before
[58:11] that is the answer to the devil's
[58:13] question
[58:16] you say what question I already told you
[58:17] the questions any questions
[58:20] I was already there
[58:22] come what may I'm going back there
[58:26] it's not going to say doesn't mean that
[58:28] you're not going to have bad days I am
[58:30] natural and Mortal just like the rest of
[58:32] you but I Pray by God's grace that we
[58:35] are all growing spiritually
[58:38] and Rising above that on a daily basis
[58:41] to where now as things come and they
[58:43] will come as you all know and that and
[58:45] that I know and more things will come
[58:47] but as they come and as more things come
[58:51] my revelation will grow higher and
[58:53] stronger and I will automatically
[58:56] instead of totally uh what's the word
[58:58] that I want to use
[59:00] um not taking appropriate action and
[59:03] making wrong decisions I will rise above
[59:05] that and the foremost thought on my mind
[59:08] will be
[59:09] In My Father's House
[59:12] are many mansions
[59:14] the question has already been answered
[59:18] he says
[59:19] now think
[59:21] if God in his Mercy has the mother
[59:25] before this little baby is born craving
[59:27] for some vitamin and the mother's word
[59:30] speaks forth dad I want this I want that
[59:32] he says he'll do everything to get it
[59:35] I'm paraphrasing now just a little bit
[59:36] for the sake of time he says but he says
[59:38] now think how much more Abel he is
[59:45] think how much a more able Christ is
[59:50] to prepare us a body to live like his
[59:54] own glorious body
[59:56] if we want to live that way he says
[59:58] there is something in us that calls us
[1:00:01] to live and there is something in us
[1:00:03] that calls to do right he says then God
[1:00:07] will call somebody to the platform or to
[1:00:09] the pulpit that will preach the absolute
[1:00:11] truth why
[1:00:14] why does God preach the absolute truth
[1:00:19] it shows you then that if you're a real
[1:00:22] child of God you begin to cry out God
[1:00:25] take this away from me circumcise me
[1:00:29] from this take these things away from me
[1:00:31] why
[1:00:33] it's needed for your heavenly home that
[1:00:37] you're going to where he's going to
[1:00:40] prepare you say well Jesus went and
[1:00:42] prepared it did he do a halfway job
[1:00:44] what's it need no no say he's done his
[1:00:47] part he has prepared it
[1:00:52] but he's also prepared a way
[1:00:56] for us to be molded into the image that
[1:01:00] will fit what he has prepared
[1:01:03] he has done both parts it's just a
[1:01:06] matter of whether we yield to it
[1:01:09] he says God is able to prepare us and to
[1:01:14] give to us that Crave in our life that
[1:01:17] we want to see something how many in
[1:01:19] here wants more of God why it goes to
[1:01:22] show there is more for you see you're
[1:01:24] craving it your little birth pains are
[1:01:26] coming on you need more so that we can
[1:01:29] be happy and free and
[1:01:32] you ready for it
[1:01:35] perfect
[1:01:37] how many wants to be happy
[1:01:40] congratulations laodicean wants that
[1:01:44] in fact that's all they want
[1:01:46] is to be happy and be happy right now
[1:01:51] and what right do you have to take my
[1:01:53] happiness away from me by telling me the
[1:01:55] truth
[1:01:57] that you say is truth
[1:02:02] how many wants to be free
[1:02:05] congratulations they would have seen
[1:02:07] wants to be free
[1:02:09] but there's a third part here
[1:02:12] and perfect
[1:02:14] how many wants to be perfect
[1:02:17] they ought to see him don't want that
[1:02:20] now
[1:02:22] you're not in a natural position
[1:02:24] now in order you say well that's so
[1:02:27] silly Saints it's the truth it is really
[1:02:29] that simple in order for you to even
[1:02:32] vocalize that and declare that you have
[1:02:35] to be a special class of people
[1:02:39] because the world does not want that the
[1:02:41] world wants to be happy and to be free
[1:02:43] they do not want to be perfect they may
[1:02:46] be perfect in their own eyes but they're
[1:02:48] certainly not going to want to be
[1:02:49] perfect according to the word of God and
[1:02:51] that is the only Perfection no matter
[1:02:54] how they want to interpret that or
[1:02:55] however they want to manifest that they
[1:02:57] can think that they're perfect but the
[1:02:59] scripture answers that question
[1:03:01] in the Book of Revelation when it says
[1:03:04] the church says I'm this and I'm that
[1:03:05] and I'm this and I'm that God has a
[1:03:07] pretty good answer for that says no
[1:03:10] you're not
[1:03:12] no you're not in fact
[1:03:15] if you want the truth this is what you
[1:03:17] are and he doesn't have one single good
[1:03:20] thing to say about the Lotus cnh not one
[1:03:23] single thing
[1:03:24] but they're happy and they're free
[1:03:27] they're certainly not perfect there's
[1:03:29] only one class of people that wants that
[1:03:32] and that's the ones with character
[1:03:33] already on the inside
[1:03:35] with the ability
[1:03:37] to be molded into perfection
[1:03:40] I say praise God for his grace to us
[1:03:42] Saints
[1:03:43] we
[1:03:45] we certainly do not appreciate what he
[1:03:47] has given us enough and I can say that
[1:03:49] from my heart and I know it's it's it's
[1:03:51] I'm as guilty as anybody we we do not
[1:03:55] truly grasp and appreciate what he has
[1:03:58] done for us and I pray God help us
[1:04:00] I pray God help us he has been so
[1:04:03] gracious to us
[1:04:04] to give us that ability
[1:04:08] not just that ability
[1:04:11] but to provide a way that we are going
[1:04:14] to come to that
[1:04:16] that it's certain that we come to that
[1:04:20] what a privilege he says like the little
[1:04:23] germ of life being in the bosom of God
[1:04:25] and The Germ of life is in the bosom of
[1:04:27] mother
[1:04:28] God is growing now this is where I want
[1:04:31] to really start emphasizing this
[1:04:35] God is growing
[1:04:40] listen to the next thing he says
[1:04:42] and go on to prepare the place for us
[1:04:45] the Eternal place with himself
[1:04:49] he says you do have a c Gene in you
[1:04:51] and God is growing
[1:04:54] and oh by the way he's went and prepared
[1:04:55] a place for that
[1:04:57] ties those two together Saints
[1:05:00] we have
[1:05:02] to have a character formed in US
[1:05:04] in order to fit into that image he has
[1:05:07] prepared and he has provided that way
[1:05:10] for us
[1:05:12] he says my see there's something life in
[1:05:15] there and you begin to feel well maybe I
[1:05:17] ought to do that he says but see what it
[1:05:19] is it's something your body Yonder is
[1:05:22] needing
[1:05:24] look how they communicate look at the
[1:05:27] polls as brothers Brothers says look at
[1:05:29] the pulsation between the spiritual and
[1:05:32] the natural between your Eternal Body
[1:05:34] and the one that you're in now
[1:05:38] your body Yonder is needing something
[1:05:40] and it calls to you and there's a
[1:05:42] physical response to that in so much
[1:05:45] that God would move somebody onto the
[1:05:46] platform to preach something to change
[1:05:48] your life to change your character to
[1:05:50] change my character that's how real it
[1:05:52] is
[1:05:54] he says
[1:05:56] something in your body Yonder is needing
[1:05:58] that come on but God's got the vitamins
[1:06:01] right in here for every bit of that body
[1:06:04] Jesus has gone to prepare the place in
[1:06:06] the bosom of God yes sir a little germ
[1:06:08] Son of God little daughter son or
[1:06:10] daughter of God he says in the invisible
[1:06:13] Union all that spiritual union of Christ
[1:06:16] in his church now when the flesh is
[1:06:18] becoming word and the word is becoming
[1:06:21] flesh
[1:06:22] that's a process is becoming becoming
[1:06:26] that's a verb that's action
[1:06:28] it didn't just happen 20 years ago when
[1:06:30] you were converted the word is becoming
[1:06:33] flesh
[1:06:35] it's a process it's the second prong
[1:06:39] character development he says manifested
[1:06:43] Vindicated just what the Bible said
[1:06:45] would happen in this day it's happening
[1:06:48] verb action process it's happening day
[1:06:54] by day
[1:06:56] how you tell me how
[1:07:00] by you trying to do better
[1:07:02] by you trying to be a good boy by you
[1:07:04] trying to be a good girl
[1:07:07] it's happening day by day
[1:07:10] by the process that he has provided
[1:07:14] his revealed word
[1:07:16] only way
[1:07:17] if you're not eating the book on a day
[1:07:20] today basis this process is not
[1:07:24] happening
[1:07:25] and you will be bound and stuck in low
[1:07:28] to sin condition
[1:07:29] but if you are
[1:07:33] this process is happening and I'll say
[1:07:37] it he says said God is growing
[1:07:41] day by day
[1:07:44] think of that God growing
[1:07:49] I mean you think God he's Eternal he's
[1:07:51] over the entire universe he he's the one
[1:07:53] that dwelt alone by himself with his
[1:07:56] thoughts encompassing all the universe
[1:07:58] but now
[1:08:00] here we are right at the tail end the
[1:08:03] closing moments of time
[1:08:05] and God
[1:08:07] is growing
[1:08:10] what a thought
[1:08:13] Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:08:16] God
[1:08:18] growing
[1:08:21] in hybrid flesh
[1:08:24] God
[1:08:26] growing
[1:08:30] in Fallen flesh
[1:08:35] that's the power that the word has been
[1:08:37] that has been delivered to us
[1:08:40] he says it's happening day by day why
[1:08:42] it's accumulating so fast out there in
[1:08:45] the deserts and things taking place that
[1:08:47] I can't even keep Pace with it we're
[1:08:49] near the coming of Jesus to be unite
[1:08:51] United with his church where the word
[1:08:54] becomes the word
[1:08:59] a lot of that was review here's some new
[1:09:01] stuff for you now
[1:09:05] stay with me because when I close I'm
[1:09:06] going to close fast
[1:09:10] in The Invisible Union I'm sorry in
[1:09:12] questions and answers number one 1954
[1:09:14] brother Branham says as I said in the
[1:09:16] beginning
[1:09:17] what you are somewhere else is what you
[1:09:22] reflect here
[1:09:26] what you are
[1:09:29] what you are
[1:09:32] not will be
[1:09:34] what you are somewhere else
[1:09:38] is what you reflect here
[1:09:43] what your Celestial body
[1:09:46] is somewhere else is what you're
[1:09:49] reflecting back here
[1:09:53] in the spirit land where you are
[1:09:59] Saints we have got to get our boots off
[1:10:01] the Earth
[1:10:02] we have got to get caught up
[1:10:04] we are living as brother random says way
[1:10:07] underneath our privileges we are not
[1:10:10] fully recognizing what we are in our
[1:10:12] position with Christ
[1:10:15] and this is before the seals
[1:10:18] in the spirit land what you are
[1:10:22] there's the answer to the devil's
[1:10:25] question
[1:10:27] Saints if you are a child of God in the
[1:10:30] spirit land you tell me what power on
[1:10:33] Earth is going to change that and what
[1:10:36] trial and tribulation that you're going
[1:10:37] to face this week next week or a month
[1:10:39] from now is going to change that what
[1:10:42] overcoming power that should deliver to
[1:10:44] us I'll say it as brother Branham says
[1:10:46] the reason we find ourselves so stooped
[1:10:48] shoulders and our head down and are
[1:10:49] drooping in the mumbles and the grumbles
[1:10:51] and the cries and complaints he says
[1:10:53] because you've not been tuned into that
[1:10:57] and there's only one way to get tuned
[1:10:59] into that if you want free from the
[1:11:00] laodicean spirits there's one way and
[1:11:03] that's to get tuned into the message of
[1:11:04] this hour because it's the only Channel
[1:11:06] that's going to explain this to you and
[1:11:08] break this down for you and give you the
[1:11:10] answer to the devil's question
[1:11:12] if not you better go ahead and make an
[1:11:14] appointment with the psychiatrist
[1:11:16] because the mental oppression and the
[1:11:18] mental plagues that are coming upon this
[1:11:20] world and especially this nation you
[1:11:22] will not be able to stand
[1:11:24] there's only one thing that's going to
[1:11:26] stand that shaking
[1:11:27] and that's the message of this hour in
[1:11:29] your soul
[1:11:33] and God has been so gracious to come and
[1:11:36] tell us these things
[1:11:38] what you are
[1:11:41] no chance to that that is settled that
[1:11:44] is fact that is eternal that is reality
[1:11:46] that is unmovable
[1:11:48] what you are in the spirit land
[1:11:52] I am here
[1:11:57] if you're still vulgar minded and so
[1:11:59] forth in the spirit land you're vulgar
[1:12:01] minded here
[1:12:02] if you still got malice and envy and
[1:12:05] strife in the spirit land
[1:12:07] you're in the spirit land with that
[1:12:11] it reflects back here
[1:12:14] so you tell me which is reality
[1:12:17] if this is reflecting that which is the
[1:12:19] reality
[1:12:21] and what should I be more focused on and
[1:12:23] accept in my life
[1:12:25] and which should I believe more when the
[1:12:27] devil presents it to me
[1:12:29] I assure you he's not going to present
[1:12:31] this to you he'll present every laodicea
[1:12:33] and condition to you but he's sure not
[1:12:35] going to come and come along and remind
[1:12:37] you
[1:12:38] what you are truly in the spirit Realm
[1:12:41] there's a lot of things that he's going
[1:12:43] to tell you but that's not going to be
[1:12:44] one of them
[1:12:48] he says what you're in the spirit land
[1:12:51] it reflects back here
[1:12:53] but if your whole innermost being has
[1:12:56] become cleansed how many want to be
[1:12:57] cleansed and purged how many want to be
[1:12:59] purged and it shows that you've got a
[1:13:02] body out yonder waiting
[1:13:05] so you tell me who's farther Advanced me
[1:13:08] or that body that's waiting
[1:13:12] if it's waiting that means it's ahead of
[1:13:13] me that means it's been there before me
[1:13:17] that's been cleansed and purged and it's
[1:13:21] reacting back in the flesh
[1:13:31] what's happening in the spiritual land
[1:13:34] what's truly happening in true reality
[1:13:37] is reacting back in this flesh
[1:13:42] and in your flesh
[1:13:48] but we are so smart and we are so
[1:13:49] educated and we have such a pure written
[1:13:52] word that we can take it and we can fool
[1:13:54] 99 and maybe even 100 of the people that
[1:13:57] we associate with
[1:13:59] but this word
[1:14:02] will tell you
[1:14:05] whether you're there or whether you're
[1:14:07] not
[1:14:08] you may fool everybody else but this
[1:14:11] word will reveal to you whether you've
[1:14:14] got the goods or not
[1:14:15] it's not about convincing me convincing
[1:14:18] this brother convincing this sister it's
[1:14:20] not about convincing the guy at work
[1:14:24] it's about knowing for yourself
[1:14:28] that's where the overcoming power is
[1:14:31] he says what is there is reacting back
[1:14:35] in your flesh that's how powerful that's
[1:14:37] how real this is is it's
[1:14:40] controlling your flesh now
[1:14:44] not you controlling it
[1:14:47] this decision has already been made
[1:14:49] he says don't you see see there it is
[1:14:52] look what he refers back to
[1:14:54] all the way back in 1954 goes right back
[1:14:58] to the exact same scripture
[1:15:00] if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved
[1:15:02] we have one already waiting see
[1:15:06] before the seals
[1:15:08] back in 1954 immediately ties these two
[1:15:11] things together
[1:15:13] questions and answers 1954 in the
[1:15:15] evening he says you cannot be here a
[1:15:18] spiritual being sinner or saint sinner
[1:15:21] or saint
[1:15:22] without having an influence from the
[1:15:25] underworld or from the above world
[1:15:27] if you are influenced from here you're
[1:15:30] from above how many has been influenced
[1:15:33] from here meaning Heavenly places
[1:15:36] if you have the capability to be
[1:15:39] influenced from Heavenly places what
[1:15:42] does the default
[1:15:44] you were already in Heavenly places
[1:15:48] and if you were already in Heavenly
[1:15:50] places what's the next default
[1:15:55] your Eternal destination has already
[1:15:57] taken care of saints
[1:16:01] how we should rejoice
[1:16:05] if your influence your Celestial body is
[1:16:08] waiting up here but if you're Wicked and
[1:16:10] hypocritical and indifferent listen to
[1:16:13] these words
[1:16:14] if you're Wicked okay I can get that
[1:16:16] hypocritical I can get that what if
[1:16:19] you're just indifferent towards the
[1:16:20] message
[1:16:24] what if you're indifferent towards the
[1:16:26] Wednesday night service
[1:16:28] whatever happens happens maybe I get
[1:16:31] something maybe I don't maybe I grow in
[1:16:32] character maybe I don't
[1:16:35] Pastor will be back Sunday
[1:16:39] indifferent what a word
[1:16:44] if you're just indifferent towards the
[1:16:46] truth he says you're being influenced
[1:16:48] from the underworld
[1:16:51] Mercy Lord have mercy on me
[1:16:55] your Celestial body is down here
[1:16:58] regardless of how much you think it's up
[1:17:00] there
[1:17:01] because the fruits that you bear before
[1:17:03] the people proves where you're from
[1:17:08] so you are here
[1:17:10] what you are somewhere else
[1:17:15] I know I'm beating that into you but I'm
[1:17:18] not going to apologize for you
[1:17:20] you are here what you
[1:17:24] are somewhere else not what you will be
[1:17:29] somewhere else you are here now what you
[1:17:33] are now somewhere else
[1:17:37] praise God
[1:17:40] your life that you live here is just
[1:17:42] reflecting what your inheritance is when
[1:17:45] you leave here do you understand we are
[1:17:47] right now all when I think of that we
[1:17:50] are right now glorified in the presence
[1:17:52] of God born again Believers for if this
[1:17:55] Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have
[1:17:57] one already waiting in glory not
[1:17:59] somewhere else right Yonder already
[1:18:02] waiting and these Earthly bodies groan
[1:18:05] to be clothed upon with that immortality
[1:18:08] things that are to be he says well if
[1:18:11] I've passed over I want to see Jesus
[1:18:13] he's referring back to the vision that
[1:18:14] he had going beyond the curtain of time
[1:18:16] this is the only place brother Brandon
[1:18:18] mentions this that I've ever found
[1:18:20] he's referencing back to that Vision or
[1:18:23] as he says I'll call a division
[1:18:24] obviously we know that was more than a
[1:18:26] vision that was an experience that he
[1:18:28] had but he's referencing back to that
[1:18:30] and he says he's speaking to those
[1:18:32] people and he says well if I've passed
[1:18:35] on I want to see Jesus
[1:18:38] and they said listen to what they said
[1:18:41] this is the only place that I found that
[1:18:43] he relays this they said you can't see
[1:18:46] him now this is the scripture said Souls
[1:18:50] under the altar
[1:18:52] they said this place that you're in is
[1:18:56] the scripture You Preach Souls under the
[1:18:58] altar
[1:19:00] Saints Souls under the altar was the
[1:19:02] fifth seal
[1:19:04] go to the end of the fifth seal and see
[1:19:06] what brother Branham has to say about
[1:19:07] you
[1:19:09] and try not to shout
[1:19:15] I'll give you a little hint he said
[1:19:16] something about seeing you over there
[1:19:19] my people that was over there
[1:19:22] Lord have mercy on us Saints
[1:19:25] and we just read oh okay that's good
[1:19:28] he saw us over there they are testifying
[1:19:32] the scripture that you preached about
[1:19:34] souls under the altar this is that place
[1:19:36] and he came back and said while I was
[1:19:38] there
[1:19:40] something I want to get to you here in a
[1:19:42] little bit
[1:19:46] Mercy goodness
[1:19:49] there's the answer to the devil's
[1:19:50] question
[1:19:56] he's just a little higher
[1:19:58] these are those people still speaking in
[1:20:00] that dimension
[1:20:02] Jesus referring to Jesus he's just a
[1:20:04] little higher someday he will return
[1:20:08] 1964 questions and answers he says now
[1:20:10] now the nature of the spirit of the Lord
[1:20:12] when you're born again you're not born
[1:20:15] to physical like the baby was but what's
[1:20:17] happened the spiritual Birth has come to
[1:20:20] you and while this spiritual birth is
[1:20:22] growing into your heart
[1:20:25] did you catch it
[1:20:26] growing verb action process
[1:20:31] not a one-time deal
[1:20:33] is there a one-time experience
[1:20:35] absolutely never deny that but if it was
[1:20:39] truly a one-time experience Born Again
[1:20:41] experience the spirit of God coming into
[1:20:43] you brother Branham says it will grow
[1:20:45] into your heart growing into your heart
[1:20:48] of God he says while that spiritual
[1:20:51] birth is growing there is a physical or
[1:20:55] a Celestial body growing to receive that
[1:20:58] spirit
[1:21:00] so we
[1:21:01] moan and groan and cry and Mumble about
[1:21:04] how we want to get out of here do we not
[1:21:05] you don't have to raise your hand I'll
[1:21:06] raise both of mine for you
[1:21:09] I'm ready to go Saints I got my little
[1:21:11] girl I'm ready to go
[1:21:14] but we moan and groan about all of our
[1:21:17] trials and troubles and tribulations
[1:21:21] but yet really
[1:21:23] it's up to our character development
[1:21:26] to fit into that body that's waiting on
[1:21:28] us
[1:21:29] so I would say
[1:21:32] we want to keep mumbling and grumbling
[1:21:33] and groaning and complaining okay but
[1:21:36] let's at least work on our character
[1:21:37] development at the same pace
[1:21:40] and we'll probably be better off correct
[1:21:44] at least I will praise the Lord he says
[1:21:47] and when the life leaves this body it
[1:21:49] goes to that body what life the
[1:21:52] character
[1:21:53] it goes to that body just as when the
[1:21:55] body is presented on Earth the spirit
[1:21:57] comes and when the spirit goes out of
[1:21:59] the body there is a body waiting for we
[1:22:01] know
[1:22:02] that after this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:22:04] dissolved we have one already waiting he
[1:22:08] references this scripture from the
[1:22:10] beginning of his ministry to the end of
[1:22:12] this minute of his ministry every time
[1:22:14] this topic comes up every time he
[1:22:17] references this scripture
[1:22:19] it's a powerful scripture
[1:22:22] 1958 hear ye him now here's I'm
[1:22:26] cognizant of the time and like I said
[1:22:27] when I close I'm going to close quick so
[1:22:29] stay with me I'm not going to have time
[1:22:30] to rehash it
[1:22:32] but I've laid a really broad foundation
[1:22:35] for the last three services and it's all
[1:22:37] going to come crashing down right here
[1:22:39] but this is the process this is the
[1:22:41] purpose this is the reason
[1:22:45] he says now here's where I think the
[1:22:46] Pentecostal church has made their
[1:22:48] mistake when that son was born into the
[1:22:50] family he was a son at Birth but is his
[1:22:53] inheritance was not yet determined it
[1:22:55] depended upon his
[1:22:57] character so though being a son and if
[1:23:01] he was a disobedient son he would not
[1:23:03] inherit anything but still he was a son
[1:23:05] but if he was an obedient son see you
[1:23:08] can be a son but you're not going to
[1:23:10] inherit that body
[1:23:12] it doesn't change the fact that you're a
[1:23:13] son
[1:23:14] you can be a disobedient son you're
[1:23:17] still a son but you're not going to
[1:23:18] inherit that body if you want to inherit
[1:23:20] that body you have to be an obedient son
[1:23:24] he says but if he was an obedient son he
[1:23:27] was heir to all things
[1:23:29] so don't call for that body until you're
[1:23:31] an obedient to all the word
[1:23:33] it's not going to work
[1:23:36] I mean that's simple I know but do we
[1:23:38] agree with that this is what he's
[1:23:40] teaching us we can call for it all we
[1:23:42] want but if we know that we're not lined
[1:23:44] up to the word of God
[1:23:46] it's not going to work if our heart
[1:23:48] condemneth not then we have faith
[1:23:51] towards God don't call me be calling for
[1:23:54] your body until you're lined up to the
[1:23:55] word that he's already delivered
[1:23:58] don't try to get to things that are to
[1:24:00] be until you've lined up to things that
[1:24:02] are
[1:24:03] if that makes sense that that goes for
[1:24:05] me as well as anybody
[1:24:08] he says then he was heir to all things
[1:24:10] and we've been taught not only through
[1:24:13] Pentecostal Realms but through the
[1:24:15] Holiness group and the Baptist and what
[1:24:17] more I'll let you decide what what more
[1:24:19] means
[1:24:21] that when we're born he says this is
[1:24:23] what we've been taught that when we're
[1:24:25] born again we're sons of God
[1:24:28] he says that's true
[1:24:30] but that's just the beginning
[1:24:33] that's my emphasis
[1:24:35] that's true
[1:24:37] but that's just the beginning
[1:24:39] it's your character from then on what
[1:24:43] means the difference
[1:24:45] 1961 expectation the holy spirit is
[1:24:48] telling you the same thing let's be
[1:24:50] expecting let's get ready for it make
[1:24:52] ready like taking a trip get everything
[1:24:54] packed up he says no
[1:24:57] this kind of trip you unpack everything
[1:25:00] he says that's the problem we've got too
[1:25:03] much packed up now too much of what too
[1:25:05] much of me
[1:25:06] too much of my character too much of
[1:25:08] sebolt DNA still packed up here it needs
[1:25:11] some unpacking
[1:25:12] not only does it need unpacking it needs
[1:25:14] throw it in the trash
[1:25:16] it needs change completely
[1:25:19] he says no this kind of trip you unpack
[1:25:22] everything got too much packed up now
[1:25:24] that's the trouble of it we need to
[1:25:27] unload
[1:25:29] questions and answers 64. that's the
[1:25:32] reason that all these great Mysteries
[1:25:34] could not be given to Luther could not
[1:25:35] be given to Wesley could not be given to
[1:25:37] the age that just passed by us
[1:25:41] think you caught it
[1:25:43] the Pentecostal age he says pass by us
[1:25:46] Pentecostal Edge brother Brown says the
[1:25:48] Pentecostal age was the laodicean church
[1:25:50] age and he just says it's passed by us
[1:25:53] why he says why could these things not
[1:25:56] be given why it wasn't time what things
[1:25:58] is he talking about he just told us in
[1:26:00] that quote that I read you the things
[1:26:02] that we've been taught before that when
[1:26:04] we believe we're sons of God he says
[1:26:06] that's true
[1:26:07] but now he's coming and saying these
[1:26:09] other things that couldn't have been
[1:26:11] taught back then they couldn't have been
[1:26:13] taught back in those other ages why
[1:26:17] it wasn't time he says they were
[1:26:20] begotten begotten means birthed Sons
[1:26:24] they were begotten now the person of
[1:26:28] Christ himself the son of man do you
[1:26:31] understand
[1:26:32] revealing himself in human flesh it
[1:26:35] could not have come until now
[1:26:38] why could it not have come until now
[1:26:42] because now there's a people in the
[1:26:45] Earth with the character to be developed
[1:26:48] into the word that's presented
[1:26:51] if they so choose
[1:26:55] or if they
[1:26:57] chose before might I say
[1:27:00] he says now we've moved past those ages
[1:27:04] this is where we're at now Christ
[1:27:06] himself the son of man in flesh I'm here
[1:27:10] to tell you that didn't cease in 1965.
[1:27:13] it did not cease in 1965 that was the
[1:27:17] start that was the wave chief
[1:27:19] God's provided way 65 he says the church
[1:27:21] will come through justification through
[1:27:23] Luther's sanctification through Wesley
[1:27:25] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:27] and the Pentecostals
[1:27:30] and go right on into the Perfection of
[1:27:33] the son of man how
[1:27:36] character development
[1:27:39] character development after the baptism
[1:27:43] of the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:27:45] brother Brandon says what he did through
[1:27:47] the church ages he does to the
[1:27:49] individual
[1:27:51] if you've came through justification and
[1:27:53] sanctification and had the baptism of
[1:27:55] the Holy Spirit do not let the devil
[1:27:57] talk you out of that no matter how many
[1:27:59] times you fall on your face
[1:28:02] because there is a process that that
[1:28:05] leads to
[1:28:08] character development you are going to
[1:28:11] fall on your face hundreds if not
[1:28:14] thousands of times during character
[1:28:16] development it does not mean you have
[1:28:18] not come through this process of
[1:28:20] justification sanctification and the
[1:28:22] baptism of the Holy Spirit In fact I
[1:28:24] would dare to say that you can't even
[1:28:26] begin character development and be
[1:28:29] worried about character development and
[1:28:31] be upset that you fell on your face
[1:28:33] until you've came through this process
[1:28:35] so the fact that you are upset with
[1:28:37] yourself for failing
[1:28:39] pretty good indication that you've been
[1:28:41] through a process
[1:28:43] now I'll say this don't try to talk
[1:28:45] yourself into it if you haven't received
[1:28:47] the baptism of the Holy Spirit get the
[1:28:49] baptism of the Holy Spirit if you have
[1:28:51] not been born again don't fool yourself
[1:28:53] for your brother your sister your
[1:28:54] neighbor to get it
[1:28:57] settle that question but once you've
[1:28:59] settled that question do not allow
[1:29:01] failures in character development to go
[1:29:04] back and raise questions there
[1:29:06] we understand that I believe we do
[1:29:12] go right on into the Perfection of the
[1:29:14] son of man that when the husband and the
[1:29:16] wife will be the self same person
[1:29:21] God will be so manifested into his bride
[1:29:24] his church till they will both be the
[1:29:28] same
[1:29:28] if it is the self-sane person and he is
[1:29:31] manifesting himself in his bride on this
[1:29:34] Earth I'm going to venture to say
[1:29:36] there's a pretty good character
[1:29:37] development there
[1:29:40] maybe even perfection
[1:29:45] it has to be Saints why would he give us
[1:29:47] a perfect word if we're not to come to
[1:29:48] Perfection and manifest that brother
[1:29:50] Brown said not sinless perfection
[1:29:54] not sinless perfection
[1:29:57] you're going to make bad decisions and
[1:30:00] wrong decisions during your character
[1:30:02] development but if your character
[1:30:04] development has come to the point that
[1:30:06] every time you see a slight deviation of
[1:30:09] the word in your life you repent of it
[1:30:11] and line back up to the word I can tell
[1:30:13] you by the authority of the prophet and
[1:30:15] of the authority of God's word you are
[1:30:16] in a place of perfection
[1:30:19] it's the only way you're going to come
[1:30:21] to Perfection you don't we don't stand a
[1:30:23] chance any other way and if he said to
[1:30:26] come to Perfection then I've got to find
[1:30:27] the way there
[1:30:30] I cannot be good enough to come to
[1:30:33] Perfection if I'm not perfect in the
[1:30:37] revealed word of God that he has
[1:30:39] delivered to me
[1:30:42] I don't stand a chance
[1:30:45] but if I am walking daily striving daily
[1:30:49] laying my life down in obedience to the
[1:30:52] revealed word of God for my age
[1:30:56] just as much as I'll tell you that I'm a
[1:30:59] failure
[1:30:59] I'll tell you that I'm perfect I am a
[1:31:02] failure in this flesh always have been
[1:31:04] always will be
[1:31:06] but in this dimension
[1:31:10] in this eternal Dimension this Immortal
[1:31:13] Dimension that has been offered to me
[1:31:15] that I've had the privilege to step into
[1:31:17] by the word that has been revealed to me
[1:31:22] we had a Prophet come and declare what
[1:31:25] that we were the sinless Spotless
[1:31:28] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ
[1:31:32] how by us trying harder
[1:31:35] why us being good boys and girls
[1:31:37] by the word that he has delivered to us
[1:31:40] dying to ourself and lining up to that
[1:31:43] even if it's a minute by minute process
[1:31:50] even if it's a second by second process
[1:31:53] when you die to yourself and the
[1:31:56] deviation away from the word and you
[1:31:58] line back up with the revealed word
[1:32:00] it puts you in a state of perfection and
[1:32:03] that Saints is not a one-time thing that
[1:32:06] is a process
[1:32:08] that is character development and allow
[1:32:11] it to be such because if not you're just
[1:32:13] going to find yourself trying to get
[1:32:15] reborn and reborn and reborn and reborn
[1:32:16] and get the Holy Ghost again and again
[1:32:18] and again and again
[1:32:20] the devil is never going to tell you
[1:32:22] that you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:32:25] he's never going to tell you that that's
[1:32:27] been settled
[1:32:32] if you do have the Holy Ghost
[1:32:35] he's going to try to convince you you
[1:32:37] don't
[1:32:37] and if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:32:39] he's going to try to convince you that
[1:32:41] you can never get it because you'll
[1:32:42] never be good enough
[1:32:43] so if you have a little thing sitting on
[1:32:46] your shoulder chirping those two things
[1:32:48] just figure out which is true in your
[1:32:50] heart and then answer the devil's
[1:32:51] question if you don't have it get it
[1:32:55] if you do have it tell him in my
[1:32:57] father's house are many mansions
[1:32:59] and if you want to hear some more talk
[1:33:00] about that stick around
[1:33:03] because that question's already been
[1:33:04] settled I want to go through some
[1:33:06] scriptures really quick and then we're
[1:33:07] going to close and when I say really
[1:33:08] quick I mean really quick so if you have
[1:33:11] a pen and paper and want to write them
[1:33:12] down that's fine but don't even bother
[1:33:13] trying to turn to these
[1:33:15] Hebrews 12 where we started out at
[1:33:18] wherefore seen we are also compassed
[1:33:20] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:33:22] let us lay aside every weight in the Sin
[1:33:24] with us so easily beset us and let us
[1:33:26] run with patience the race that is set
[1:33:28] before us looking unto Jesus the
[1:33:31] author
[1:33:33] and finisher of our faith I think you
[1:33:37] got it so I'm going to go down to 23. to
[1:33:39] the general assembly and the Church of
[1:33:41] the firstborn which are written in
[1:33:42] heaven to God the judge of all and
[1:33:46] to the spirit of just men
[1:33:49] made perfect just men
[1:33:53] made perfect just men Born Again men you
[1:33:57] can't be just unless you're born again
[1:33:58] Born Again men made perfect two things
[1:34:03] Revelation 4 1 after this I looked and
[1:34:05] behold a door was open in heaven and the
[1:34:07] first voice voice which I heard was as
[1:34:09] it were a trumpet talking with me which
[1:34:11] said come up hither
[1:34:13] rapture
[1:34:14] and I will show thee things which must
[1:34:17] be hereafter
[1:34:19] when you are born again you are caught
[1:34:21] up you are raptured up out of your
[1:34:23] Earthly layoutian condition
[1:34:25] what's the second thing that should
[1:34:27] happen you should start seeing things
[1:34:29] which must be hereafter
[1:34:32] not natural prophetic events things in
[1:34:36] here that need to change from this point
[1:34:38] forward
[1:34:39] he says come up here and I'll show this
[1:34:41] to you
[1:34:45] John 16 13 how be it when he the spirit
[1:34:48] of Truth has come he will guide you into
[1:34:50] all Truth for he shall not speak of
[1:34:52] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[1:34:53] that shall he speak and so he's already
[1:34:57] come right
[1:34:58] that's what he says when he the spirit
[1:35:00] of Truth is come so he's come he's come
[1:35:03] you've received the baptism of the Holy
[1:35:06] Spirit he's come
[1:35:08] and he will show you things to come
[1:35:12] both in the scripture and things that
[1:35:14] are to come in here and change does that
[1:35:16] make sense two parts
[1:35:19] first Peter 2 verse 1 wherefore laying
[1:35:22] aside all malice and guile in
[1:35:24] hypocrisies and envies in all evil
[1:35:26] speakings as newborn babes desire the
[1:35:29] sincere milk of the word that ye may
[1:35:31] grow
[1:35:32] thereby
[1:35:34] you said well I've received the word
[1:35:37] praise God now do the next part that ye
[1:35:39] may grow thereby the purpose of you
[1:35:42] receiving the sincere milk of the word
[1:35:44] is to do what
[1:35:46] character development growth
[1:35:49] he says in verse 5 ye also are Lively
[1:35:53] stones are built up
[1:35:57] building as a process action verb built
[1:36:01] up a spiritual house a holy priesthood
[1:36:04] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[1:36:06] acceptable acceptable to God by Jesus
[1:36:09] Christ Jude 1 verse 20 but ye beloved
[1:36:14] building up yourselves building as I
[1:36:17] said verb action process
[1:36:21] on your Most Holy Faith praying in the
[1:36:24] Holy Ghost
[1:36:25] keep yourself in the love of God looking
[1:36:28] for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:29] unto
[1:36:31] eternal life
[1:36:32] Ephesians 2 verse 19 now therefore ye
[1:36:36] are no more strangers and foreigners but
[1:36:38] fellow citizens with the Saints and of
[1:36:40] the household of God I'm telling you you
[1:36:42] can't be in that position without a new
[1:36:43] birth
[1:36:45] we all agree
[1:36:47] but look at verse 20. and
[1:36:51] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:36:54] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[1:36:55] himself being the Chief Cornerstone in
[1:36:58] whom all the building fitly framed
[1:37:01] together grow
[1:37:04] after the New Birth the building will be
[1:37:07] fitly framed together
[1:37:09] groweth into a holy Temple
[1:37:12] growth into a holy Temple in the Lord in
[1:37:15] whom also ye are building look how many
[1:37:19] verbs and action are used after the New
[1:37:23] Birth
[1:37:25] this is where we're at Saints character
[1:37:28] development
[1:37:30] whom you are also building together for
[1:37:33] a habitation of God through the spirit
[1:37:38] First Corinthians 12.
[1:37:40] verse 27 now ye are the body of Christ
[1:37:44] and members in particular really good
[1:37:46] position to be in right praise God we
[1:37:49] are members of the body of Christ we we
[1:37:52] are the body of Christ members in
[1:37:54] particular and God has set some in the
[1:37:57] church first apostles secondarily
[1:37:58] prophets thirdly teachers after that
[1:38:01] Miracles then Gifts of healing helps
[1:38:03] governments diversities of tongues are
[1:38:05] all Apostles are all prophets are all
[1:38:07] teachers are all workers of the Miracles
[1:38:10] have all the gifts of healing do all
[1:38:12] speak with tongues do all interpret
[1:38:16] but covet earnestly the best gifts
[1:38:20] and
[1:38:22] yet
[1:38:24] show I unto you a more excellent way
[1:38:28] your members of the body of Christ
[1:38:32] and Paul says you've got all these gifts
[1:38:34] and all these Ministries
[1:38:37] but yet there's a more excellent way
[1:38:40] character development still going on
[1:38:45] First Peter 1 1.
[1:38:50] I'm going to skip to verse 9 actually
[1:38:55] First Peter 1 9 receiving the end of
[1:38:59] your faith even the salvation of your
[1:39:01] souls
[1:39:04] receiving the end of your faith so if
[1:39:07] you receive the end of your faith
[1:39:11] there had to have been a beginning of
[1:39:13] your faith correct
[1:39:15] so the beginning of your faith
[1:39:18] is not the end two things correct
[1:39:22] character development
[1:39:25] Proverbs 1 7 the fear of the Lord is the
[1:39:30] beginning
[1:39:32] of wisdom
[1:39:34] I'm sorry beginning of knowledge
[1:39:37] but fools despise wisdom and instruction
[1:39:39] Proverbs 9 10 the fear of the Lord is
[1:39:42] the beginning of wisdom so if knowledge
[1:39:46] has a beginning does it not have an end
[1:39:49] if wisdom has a beginning does it not
[1:39:51] have an end
[1:39:52] two things here
[1:39:54] character development have you come to
[1:39:56] the knowledge of the new birth
[1:39:59] that's the beginning let it be developed
[1:40:01] have you come to the beginning of wisdom
[1:40:04] you say well I don't know brother random
[1:40:06] says wisdom will come into the church
[1:40:07] and tell you what age you're living in
[1:40:10] have you received the beginning of
[1:40:12] wisdom
[1:40:13] let it have its due process
[1:40:16] character development
[1:40:18] the reason that you know what age you
[1:40:20] live in is so that you can come to the
[1:40:22] end of your faith that you can come to
[1:40:24] the end of knowledge that you can come
[1:40:25] to the end of wisdom and have perfect
[1:40:27] character
[1:40:31] Matthew 24 12 and because iniquity shall
[1:40:35] abound the love of many shall wax old
[1:40:37] but he that shall endure
[1:40:41] unto the end the same shall be saved
[1:40:44] so if you have to endure something
[1:40:47] that tells me
[1:40:49] it's not a one-time blip on the radar
[1:40:52] there's some endurance here there is a
[1:40:53] process here there is a walk here there
[1:40:55] is character development here
[1:40:59] second Timothy 4 7 Paul speaking he says
[1:41:02] I fought the good fight and I have
[1:41:04] finished my course so if Paul finished
[1:41:07] his course what does that mean
[1:41:09] I think you all got it by now there was
[1:41:12] a beginning to his course
[1:41:14] where was the beginning when he got
[1:41:15] smooth off his high horse is that where
[1:41:17] he stopped no Paul says I fought the
[1:41:19] fight
[1:41:20] I finished my course getting knocked off
[1:41:22] my horse was the beginning of my course
[1:41:24] but it surely wasn't the end of his
[1:41:26] course
[1:41:28] I have kept the faith Ephesians 4
[1:41:33] let's go to 12 for the sake of time
[1:41:36] oh no let's start at 11. and he gave
[1:41:38] some Apostles and some prophets and some
[1:41:40] evangelists and some pastors and some
[1:41:41] teachers for what for the perfecting
[1:41:46] of the Saints and I know I've said it a
[1:41:48] hundred times maybe this will be the
[1:41:49] last verb action process
[1:41:55] perfecting after the New Birth character
[1:41:59] development
[1:42:00] skipping to verse 15 but speaking the
[1:42:03] truth in love may grow up
[1:42:07] into him
[1:42:09] all things which is the head even Christ
[1:42:13] Philippians 1 8 being confident of this
[1:42:16] one thing that he which hath
[1:42:18] begun a good work
[1:42:21] and you will perform it into the day of
[1:42:23] Jesus Christ
[1:42:25] second Corinthians 3 17 now the Lord is
[1:42:28] that spirit and where the spirit of the
[1:42:30] Lord is there is Liberty how many has
[1:42:32] received the spirit of the Lord and how
[1:42:33] many has been said at Liberty from your
[1:42:35] sins
[1:42:37] but we all with open face beholding in a
[1:42:40] glass the glory of the of the Lord are
[1:42:43] changed into the same image from glory
[1:42:46] to glory changed verb action process
[1:42:51] character development after
[1:42:53] you've received the spirit of the Lord
[1:42:55] and been said at Liberty
[1:42:58] musicians please come
[1:43:05] I read this quote last time but it is
[1:43:09] super important so I'm going to read
[1:43:14] three more quotes and we're going to be
[1:43:16] out of here in five minutes
[1:43:19] unless you stay in worship if you stay
[1:43:21] in worship that's up to you how long
[1:43:22] you're out of here
[1:43:24] brother Brandon says I know your faith
[1:43:27] the scripture speaking Christ speaking
[1:43:29] brother brand I'm quoting in the church
[1:43:31] age book I know your faith now he does
[1:43:34] not say here as he did to the church in
[1:43:37] pergamus you hold my faith he is not
[1:43:39] talking about his faith now but he is
[1:43:42] commending them for their faithfulness
[1:43:44] and as he does he also mentions their
[1:43:48] patience now faithfulness and patience
[1:43:51] go together in fact patience is the
[1:43:55] outcome of faithfulness for it says in
[1:43:57] James 1 3 the trying of your faith
[1:44:00] worketh patience there is absolutely no
[1:44:04] other way to gain patience it has to
[1:44:08] come by the trial of your faith Romans 5
[1:44:10] 3 tribulation worketh patience how
[1:44:15] highly God regards this outworking of
[1:44:17] our patients as seen in James 1 4 but
[1:44:20] let patience have her perfect work that
[1:44:24] ye may be perfect an entire lacking
[1:44:27] nothing
[1:44:29] God's will for us is perfection
[1:44:34] and that Perfection is patience
[1:44:38] waiting on God and for God
[1:44:43] this is the process of character
[1:44:47] development
[1:44:49] he makes the requirement Saints and he
[1:44:53] provides the process for it and the
[1:44:56] answer for it
[1:44:58] the process of character development is
[1:45:02] dying to yourself daily waiting on God
[1:45:05] for the answer and waiting for God to
[1:45:08] manifest the answer
[1:45:10] the process of character development is
[1:45:13] that patience not to snap to your own
[1:45:17] ways
[1:45:19] but let the mind of Christ be in you
[1:45:23] remember he said his mind
[1:45:26] is his will and his will is his word
[1:45:30] the process of character development is
[1:45:33] when you hit the roadblock when you hit
[1:45:35] the snare when you hit the Trap when you
[1:45:38] hit the trial
[1:45:39] stop for a second
[1:45:42] stand still let him Dress You by his
[1:45:45] word be caught up
[1:45:49] die to your own ideas
[1:45:51] and let him wait on him and for him to
[1:45:57] provide the solution whether it's a
[1:46:00] little problem
[1:46:01] or a big problem
[1:46:03] his requirement for us is perfection
[1:46:06] and he's provided the process for that
[1:46:09] in Investments he says as I said this
[1:46:12] week Ellie's are sweated it out
[1:46:15] trying to find character you can go
[1:46:17] ahead and play something if you would
[1:46:18] like please
[1:46:19] and when he found Rebecca then he had an
[1:46:22] awful time making her stand still
[1:46:24] he could get her dressed
[1:46:28] he says he had an awful time getting her
[1:46:31] to stand still so he could get her
[1:46:33] dressed
[1:46:36] same thing it is with the church we find
[1:46:38] the character in the Pentecostal Church
[1:46:40] you find when you got character to work
[1:46:42] on
[1:46:44] but then you can't make them stand still
[1:46:46] long enough to bring them back to where
[1:46:49] they once fell from
[1:46:53] how many wants to go back to where you
[1:46:56] once fell from
[1:47:00] you didn't fall from being a good boy
[1:47:03] it was a lot higher than that
[1:47:05] [Music]
[1:47:07] he says in order to get them back
[1:47:10] to where they once fell from
[1:47:14] since I want to go back to where I once
[1:47:16] fell from
[1:47:17] [Music]
[1:47:18] to get them back to where I they once
[1:47:21] fell from they've got to stand still
[1:47:24] long enough to have their character
[1:47:26] worked on
[1:47:29] [Music]
[1:47:30] praise God I say let's stand still
[1:47:33] s in the scripture I think it's Psalms
[1:47:35] 46 10 stand still
[1:47:38] and know that he is God
[1:47:40] I'm telling you to stand still but now
[1:47:42] I'm telling you to stand up
[1:47:46] stand still and know that I am God
[1:47:49] what's he saying stand still don't solve
[1:47:54] your own problems Don't Take Your Own
[1:47:55] Way know that I am God
[1:47:59] wait on me and wait for me
[1:48:02] how many wants to stand still
[1:48:05] and know that he is God and let him
[1:48:08] dress you and develop your character
[1:48:11] to where he can put you back where you
[1:48:13] once fell from
[1:48:16] I'm going to read this last quote where
[1:48:18] I started out
[1:48:20] he says the second a forerunner of
[1:48:22] Christ which was brother Branham we know
[1:48:24] well so for the latter rain
[1:48:26] Jesus will be the showdown between the
[1:48:29] denominations and Creeds for he will
[1:48:31] come to back up his word and take his
[1:48:34] bride in the Rapture the first Showdown
[1:48:37] was Mount Carmel the second was Mount
[1:48:39] Transfiguration the third will be Mount
[1:48:41] Zion
[1:48:42] not to change what he said but I'm going
[1:48:45] to say it this way the third is Mount
[1:48:48] Zion
[1:48:49] that's where we're right now
[1:48:52] a spiritual Showdown
[1:48:56] will you take your way
[1:48:58] or will you heed the call to come to
[1:49:01] Mount Zion
[1:49:03] will we be a natural people
[1:49:06] and respond naturally
[1:49:08] or we would be a spiritual people and
[1:49:10] respond to a spiritual Mountain Zion
[1:49:13] because the scripture says we're not
[1:49:15] called to Natural Things
[1:49:16] were called to go back to where we fell
[1:49:19] from
[1:49:21] what we are there
[1:49:24] is what we are here
[1:49:27] I say Lord mold my character
[1:49:31] through whatever process you have to
[1:49:34] mold my character to make me fit that
[1:49:37] reality
[1:49:39] do we agree with that praise God I know
[1:49:41] you do God bless you thank you for being
[1:49:43] patient for me let's pray together
[1:49:47] Lord Jesus
[1:49:50] father we just want to thank you for
[1:49:52] coming and being with us this evening
[1:49:53] Lord
[1:49:55] Lord we want to lift
[1:49:58] our hands in worship to you Lord
[1:50:01] and in gratitude
[1:50:03] that you have called us to perfection
[1:50:07] and that you have provided a word for us
[1:50:11] to get there
[1:50:12] and Lord
[1:50:14] those two are facts they are Undisputed
[1:50:18] you have done it it's history but Lord
[1:50:22] we want to stand here
[1:50:24] and ask
[1:50:25] in your mercy and in your grace that you
[1:50:28] will come
[1:50:29] and that you will allow us to stand
[1:50:32] still and be dressed by this word you
[1:50:35] have so graciously sent to us that you
[1:50:38] will not find
[1:50:40] a flippant woman when you return running
[1:50:42] to and fro but you will find a wife in
[1:50:46] her place of duty standing still and
[1:50:48] dressed appropriately in christ-like
[1:50:51] character of perfection
[1:50:54] we know you will do this Lord because
[1:50:56] you said you would have a bride and if
[1:50:58] you said you would have a bride you're
[1:51:00] going to have a bride and not only did
[1:51:02] you say you would have a bride you said
[1:51:03] you would have a bride without spot or
[1:51:05] wrinkle
[1:51:06] Lord those things are factual they are
[1:51:09] true they are unwavering
[1:51:11] but we want to come now both
[1:51:12] individually and as the assembly and
[1:51:16] submit ourselves to you afresh and Lord
[1:51:18] say as Mary did
