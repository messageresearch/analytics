[10:29] amen
[10:31] god bless you is that your heart's
[10:32] desire just to be a dwelling place of
[10:34] the most high god that's my heart's
[10:36] desire
[10:37] thank you musicians i sure appreciate it
[10:40] god bless you all i'll have you go to
[10:42] your bibles right
[10:44] away it's nice to be here this evening
[10:47] always an honor and a privilege to come
[10:50] and
[10:51] see what he will say
[10:52] i really never quite know
[10:56] you would think the more you do this the
[10:57] better and easier it's supposed to get
[10:59] but it doesn't work that way
[11:01] i realize you're just more dependent
[11:03] more needy each and every day for his
[11:06] leadership and his guidance
[11:09] before we read this i thought i was
[11:11] going to go a completely different
[11:12] subject brother chad asked me on
[11:14] saturday and as i began to study out
[11:17] that direction i just hit a brick wall i
[11:19] couldn't go anywhere i had no
[11:20] inspiration whatsoever
[11:22] and
[11:23] and then i just didn't know what to do
[11:24] on monday and then on tuesday i still
[11:27] didn't know what to do and then i just
[11:28] did some bible reading and some devotion
[11:31] time and in my morning devotions just
[11:33] something jumped off the page to me
[11:35] and it's kind of an odd
[11:37] chapter in the bible it's an uh it's a
[11:39] bit of an odd scripture setting made me
[11:42] question i had to sit there and really
[11:44] ponder it meditate on it and um
[11:46] and then that evening i still thought i
[11:48] was going to go a different direction
[11:50] and every time i'd go back and think of
[11:51] what i read that morning it just kind of
[11:53] lit me up again so if it's all right i
[11:55] want to talk about it i want to look at
[11:57] it i think there's a reason for it i
[11:59] actually believe with all my heart
[12:00] there's a reason for it it's just
[12:02] sometimes things light up at the right
[12:04] time and you just want to follow that
[12:05] leading and this is you know the last
[12:07] time i ministered i had 10 pages of
[12:09] notes i knew what i was going to preach
[12:10] two weeks before i felt really good
[12:11] about it i was like my lord will you do
[12:13] this every time this is wonderful
[12:15] and then i come tonight and all i have
[12:17] is a direction like it's just like go
[12:19] north and i don't know any other way i'm
[12:21] just i'm just heading this way and so
[12:24] he'll have to turn me as we as we travel
[12:26] this road but there's one thing i have
[12:28] confidence in
[12:29] god keeps his word
[12:30] we've assembled ourselves together this
[12:32] is what he said to do and he said he
[12:34] would he promised to meet us there and
[12:37] that's all i know and that's what i have
[12:38] a confidence in is this journey goes on
[12:40] in life i just have a promise he'll
[12:42] never leave me he'll never forsake me
[12:44] he'll be with me wherever i go
[12:46] so i don't always have to understand or
[12:48] figure everything out i just have to
[12:49] follow his lead wherever he leads me i
[12:52] just want to follow
[12:53] so i hope it's okay i'm going to really
[12:55] need you to pull because again i'm just
[12:57] going north right now and if he says go
[12:59] south we're going to go south and we'll
[13:01] see what happens i'd like you to turn in
[13:03] your bibles to psalms 77.
[13:07] and i have a little bit of a lengthy
[13:09] reading but i kind of have to read the
[13:11] whole in order for the context and the
[13:13] thought
[13:14] so i want to look at the entire chapter
[13:16] of psalms
[13:17] 77.
[13:28] just say amen when you're there
[13:31] amen
[13:33] let's begin
[13:35] i cried unto god with my voice even unto
[13:38] god with my voice and he gave ear unto
[13:40] me
[13:41] in the day of my trouble i saw the lord
[13:44] my sore ran in the night and ceased not
[13:47] my soul refused to be comforted i
[13:50] remembered god and i was troubled
[13:53] i complained
[13:54] and my spirit was overwhelmed saylah
[13:57] thou holdest mine eyes waking i am so
[14:00] troubled that i cannot speak
[14:02] i have considered the days of old and
[14:05] the years of ancient times
[14:07] i call to remembrance my song in the
[14:10] night
[14:11] i commune with mine own heart
[14:14] and my spirit made diligent search
[14:17] will the lord cast off forever
[14:20] and will he be favorable no more
[14:23] is his mercy clean gone forever
[14:27] doth his promise fail forevermore
[14:30] hath god forgotten to be gracious
[14:34] hath he in anger shut up his tender
[14:38] mercies
[14:39] selah
[14:40] and i said this is my infirmity
[14:45] but
[14:46] i will remember the years of the right
[14:50] hand of the most high
[14:52] i will remember the works of the lord
[14:55] surely i will remember thy wonders of
[14:58] old i will meditate also on all thy work
[15:02] and talk of all thy doings
[15:05] thy way o god is in the sanctuary
[15:08] who is so great a god as our god
[15:11] thou art the god that doest wonders
[15:14] thou hast declared thy strength among
[15:17] thy people thou hast with thine arm
[15:21] redeemed thy people the sons of jacob
[15:24] and joseph selah
[15:26] the waters saw thee oh god the waters
[15:29] saw thee and they were afraid and the
[15:32] depths were also troubled the clouds
[15:34] poured out water and the sky sent out a
[15:36] sound thine arrows also went abroad the
[15:39] voice of thy thunder was in the heaven
[15:41] and the lightnings lightened the world
[15:43] and the earth trembled and it shook
[15:46] thy way is in the sea
[15:48] and thy path in the great waters and thy
[15:51] footsteps are not known
[15:54] thou lettest thy people like a flock by
[15:58] the hand of moses
[16:00] and aaron
[16:01] may we just bow our heads for prayer
[16:04] most gracious heavenly father we thank
[16:06] you for this opportunity lord to think
[16:08] of all the people this day in this world
[16:10] are doing so many other things and you
[16:12] by your grace have brought us into your
[16:13] presence to hear your most precious
[16:15] words and we're not like other churches
[16:17] that would gather wondering lord well
[16:19] god will you speak to us and i no we
[16:21] know you'll speak to us tonight father
[16:23] we're we're in the presence of the most
[16:25] high this is not a church like other
[16:27] churches this is a church where we come
[16:29] to hear the voice of god and we hear it
[16:32] we're we come into a place where when we
[16:34] ask you a question you actually speak
[16:35] back to us father this is one thing that
[16:38] we know that lord you're a discerner of
[16:40] the thoughts and the intents of the
[16:41] heart you know our goings and our
[16:42] comings you know if i
[16:44] like david said if i make my bed and
[16:46] hell thou art there lord you know where
[16:48] we are you know what's going on so
[16:50] father god i just pray that you would
[16:51] take me in my insufficiency your
[16:54] unworthy servant lord and just use me to
[16:56] speak your words to your most precious
[16:58] precious bride father lord encourage our
[17:00] hearts strengthen us lord and focus our
[17:03] vision father we pray we love you and
[17:05] thank you in jesus name amen you may be
[17:08] seated
[17:09] for a moment
[17:13] so this is the scripture that i was
[17:15] drawn to that just seemed to jump off
[17:18] the page from me
[17:19] and i want to bring some special
[17:21] emphasis to this and different portions
[17:23] of this and break it down for a moment
[17:26] but my title for tonight is but i will
[17:29] remember amen
[17:31] but i will remember
[17:33] and here we see david is in quite a
[17:35] turmoil condition he's uh he's wondering
[17:38] certain questions that don't sound like
[17:39] david usually talks here's david asking
[17:42] questions like god have you forgotten me
[17:44] god have you forsaken me god have you
[17:46] removed your tender mercies from me and
[17:48] if you remember the tender mercies of
[17:50] david is that god deals with his
[17:51] children in a way of always correcting
[17:53] them to keep them on the right path it's
[17:56] never a penile judgment i'm done with
[17:58] you get out of the way when god corrects
[18:00] his children it's it's remedial it's to
[18:02] put you back in line and david's asking
[18:05] these questions almost with like oh lord
[18:07] have you have you forgotten your tender
[18:09] mercies to me will you no longer speak
[18:11] to me will you no longer deal with me
[18:12] has thy anger risen up in such a way
[18:15] that thou has forgotten about me
[18:17] but oh i remember
[18:20] david got struck by inspiration he says
[18:23] oh but i remember god and i remember
[18:26] what you did for the hebrew children and
[18:28] it's such an interesting thing here
[18:30] david in his mind goes back to the the
[18:32] stories of old and he goes back to moses
[18:35] and here's god with a mighty
[18:36] outstretched hand delivering the
[18:38] children of israel from the egyptians
[18:40] he's taking them he's bringing down
[18:42] flies he's bringing in frogs he's
[18:44] bringing in darkness he's he's sending
[18:46] the death angel land god is mightily on
[18:48] the move to set his children free and in
[18:50] the process of them coming free he
[18:52] brings them right up to a red sea
[18:56] this is a shocking thing in all of david
[18:58] wandering he gets encouraged and he
[19:00] remembers oh god you haven't forsaken me
[19:03] oh god you never forsake your people
[19:06] many times you just lead us to the red
[19:08] sea and we can't see your footsteps
[19:09] anymore where did you go i don't know
[19:11] where you went lord but you promised
[19:13] you'd be with me and this encouraged
[19:14] david and his inspiration struck him he
[19:17] said you didn't leave me lord you just
[19:19] brought me to a red sea and i just don't
[19:21] know where you're at
[19:22] but he knew the footsteps were going
[19:24] right through that red sea
[19:26] he didn't couldn't see him anymore but
[19:28] david had a confidence and he remembered
[19:30] the lord
[19:31] and when he remembered the lord he was
[19:33] encouraged and the recognition that god
[19:36] never forsakes his people he just takes
[19:38] you to a point in time he likes to test
[19:40] you a little bit see what kind of stand
[19:41] you're going to take take you to a point
[19:43] you don't know where you're going you
[19:44] don't know if he's forgotten about you
[19:46] you don't know if he's just totally done
[19:47] with you
[19:48] and then just to see what you will do
[19:50] god likes to do these things he likes to
[19:53] bring us into situations where it looks
[19:55] like
[19:56] god do you want to destroy me
[19:58] i mean you have to think what were the
[19:59] hebrew children saying thank you lord
[20:01] you brought me from here right here
[20:02] wonderful look at all that and then uh
[20:03] oh red sea lord
[20:07] did you did you forsake me lord have you
[20:09] forgotten about me
[20:11] no
[20:12] if they could have only recognized that
[20:15] red sea was going to be their
[20:16] deliverance and the destruction of their
[20:18] enemy see what the devil intends for
[20:21] evil god always uses it for good
[20:24] and what they did not recognize that the
[20:26] difficulties and they couldn't
[20:27] understand and the trials that was right
[20:29] before them was only the thing that was
[20:31] setting up to bring the deliverance that
[20:32] they had to have and was going to be in
[20:34] the destruction permanently they would
[20:36] never see their enemy again
[20:38] and this has consistently and always
[20:40] been the pathway of the believer
[20:42] you're he's there with you one day and
[20:44] you know he's walking with you and you
[20:45] can see him you can feel him you know
[20:47] he's walking it's like lord it's like oh
[20:49] wow you're with me everywhere i go in
[20:51] every decision and then before long
[20:52] you're just wonderful it's fantastic and
[20:54] then lord where did you go
[20:56] did you lead me into a trap
[20:58] did you lead me into something you want
[21:00] me to be destroyed
[21:02] no
[21:03] see this was the question david had
[21:05] david was really curious but the spirit
[21:08] of the lord came upon him inspiration
[21:10] struck me said no i remember
[21:12] i've seen this before
[21:14] i know how you deal with your children i
[21:17] know exactly now what you are doing
[21:20] you've not led me to destruction
[21:22] you're bringing my deliverance
[21:25] and so many times we forget about that
[21:28] and uh so brother branham says in 1959
[21:31] he said isn't it a strange thing how god
[21:33] does
[21:34] he will let you get right down to the
[21:36] last the last mile you know he likes to
[21:38] do that he did that with the hebrew
[21:40] children he knew he he could trust so he
[21:44] let them them boys walk right up to a
[21:46] fiery furnace till they could almost
[21:49] smell that fire and he never moved
[21:52] and when it came it comes time he will
[21:55] move
[21:56] but he waits till his own time he wanted
[21:59] to see what kind of reaction they'd have
[22:03] he knowed they'd make their stand and
[22:05] when he knows that you will make your
[22:08] stand he will let satan take you to the
[22:10] very last mile
[22:12] but just remember he's still there he
[22:15] wants to see
[22:17] if you really mean what you are talking
[22:20] about
[22:21] oh i believe god's a healer yes sure i
[22:23] am and the next day you got all those
[22:25] pains well maybe i don't got it sure you
[22:27] got it he's just wanting to see how
[22:29] you're going to react
[22:31] on what he said
[22:32] you say oh praise god i believe in the
[22:34] baptism of the holy spirit and the first
[22:36] little temptation comes up and you fly
[22:38] off like a buzzsaw he's trying to see
[22:40] your reaction to the action he's trying
[22:42] to test you and every son that cometh
[22:44] the god must first be chastened and
[22:47] tested every child that comes he puts
[22:50] them through the test to see how they
[22:52] will act
[22:55] quite a test
[22:56] quite an opportunity that god has given
[22:58] us in this day and i thought it would be
[23:00] all right i hope this is all right i'd
[23:02] just like to go through this and show
[23:03] you this example over and over and over
[23:06] because david was encouraged he was down
[23:09] in the dumps but he got encouraged when
[23:11] he remembered the right thing
[23:13] he remembered how god has moved before
[23:16] and if he did it before he'll do it for
[23:17] me
[23:19] and so those footsteps that looked like
[23:21] they were leading into destruction were
[23:22] actually leading to their deliverance
[23:24] and oh how god likes his wonders we
[23:27] can't figure him out we truly can't the
[23:29] more you try to figure him out oh you
[23:31] just have faith in god that's just
[23:33] simple you have faith in god you know he
[23:35] loves you you know he's watched over you
[23:37] and i'll tell you i went for a walk the
[23:39] other morning after i read this and i
[23:40] just went for a walk and i was just
[23:41] having my own devotional time and i
[23:43] began to myself remember i began to
[23:45] remember all the times he delivered me
[23:47] and it's so easy for us to forget that
[23:50] it's so easy to forget the mighty hand
[23:52] of god that delivered you time and time
[23:55] and time again and the first little
[23:57] issue and problem that arises in your
[23:58] life it's like you forgot everything
[24:00] it's like oh god where you must not love
[24:02] me you must have forsaken me what are
[24:04] you talking about
[24:06] my goodness and i remembered i was i was
[24:08] walking there and uh and this and i
[24:10] remembered and it's the first time i
[24:12] could remember this i remember when i
[24:13] was 16 years old and it really struck me
[24:16] and i was going back in my mind just
[24:17] remembering these times when i knew he
[24:19] drew
[24:20] close to me and would talk to me and
[24:21] tell me something and i remember i
[24:22] climbed up on the top of our roof i was
[24:24] 16. it was before my dad got home was
[24:26] about 11 30. he worked second shift he
[24:28] wasn't home my mom was in bed and i used
[24:30] there was an antenna on our house and i
[24:32] used to climb up on that to antenna and
[24:34] i used to sit on that roof and just look
[24:35] at the sky
[24:37] and on them summer nights you look at
[24:38] the sky you see all those stars and it's
[24:40] kind of a real funny feeling that used
[24:42] to come over me and you began to look at
[24:43] all that and you know there's a god
[24:45] somewhere there's some god somewhere and
[24:47] i didn't know where he was but i
[24:49] remember sitting on that roof saying
[24:51] lord i don't know where you are but i am
[24:54] going to find you
[24:55] i remember saying that as a kid what in
[24:58] the world where did that come from i'm a
[25:00] 16 year old kid going to a worldly
[25:02] school i'm not born again i have
[25:04] influences all around me i have 16 year
[25:06] old thoughts what on the world is in
[25:08] this young boy sitting on a roof saying
[25:10] god i don't know where you are but i'm
[25:12] going to find you here's what i also
[25:15] said and i remembered saying it and i
[25:16] don't know why he brought it back to my
[25:18] remembrance but as i was walking through
[25:20] i remember saying this lord if i knew
[25:22] you were on some mountain somewhere in
[25:24] this world i would forsake all and fight
[25:28] and then as i was walking i realized
[25:31] oh my he was on a mountain
[25:34] it was mount sunset i didn't realize and
[25:36] i've been climbing this mountain and i'm
[25:38] seeing him more clear every day by his
[25:41] grace i didn't know what i was saying i
[25:43] had no idea why i would say that why
[25:45] would a 16 year old boy say that
[25:48] i don't know what mountain you're on but
[25:50] i'm gonna find you lord i'm gonna find
[25:52] you i'm so glad see he brought back to
[25:54] something to my remembrance
[25:56] sometimes you just got to do that you
[25:58] got to stop and think what did he bring
[26:00] me through
[26:01] why did he do those things
[26:03] i have to you know sometimes you know
[26:04] david said i have to stir myself up in
[26:06] the lord
[26:07] sometimes you got to do that you're kind
[26:09] of con constantly maybe sometimes you
[26:11] sit back waiting god you need to do
[26:12] something to stir me up
[26:14] why
[26:16] david didn't act like that
[26:18] david said you know what i'm going to
[26:19] remember the mighty hand of god that
[26:21] delivered me over and over and over
[26:23] again and i'm going to stir myself up in
[26:25] the lord i'm going to remember his
[26:27] goodness and his grace to me i'm going
[26:29] to remember how he brought me through
[26:31] this and he brought me through that and
[26:32] he brought me through this
[26:34] and as i kept going thinking about there
[26:36] then i went in that that night and i
[26:38] began to talk to my daughters and i
[26:39] remembered that joshua said hey build up
[26:41] all these stones so you can tell your
[26:42] children how god brought a great victory
[26:44] here and you know we're called to do
[26:46] that we are supposed to remind our
[26:49] children and talk to our wives and talk
[26:50] to our families and talk to one another
[26:52] of the goodness of god and the great
[26:54] victories that he brought us through we
[26:56] should build up some stones from time to
[26:57] time and say hey this here right here is
[27:00] where god brought my deliverance
[27:01] and i was going back in my mind and i
[27:03] started to assemble some of those stones
[27:05] from my daughters and they were supposed
[27:06] to go to bed at nine and i think i got
[27:08] in bed at 10. sorry sweetheart but i
[27:10] couldn't stop because i kept thinking of
[27:12] his goodness to me and i kept
[27:13] remembering all the times he interviewed
[27:14] on my behalf and i began to think also
[27:16] you know what i was in a home and sadly
[27:18] by it just
[27:20] i came out of a broken home now
[27:22] typically that would be a destructive
[27:24] thing for a young man you know not
[27:26] raised in the message not raised in the
[27:28] truth and now the home is broke up and
[27:30] there's there's no covering there's no
[27:32] protection i don't have a mother and
[27:34] father that's there to to kind of
[27:36] shackle me you know put things together
[27:38] and hold me and just what the devil
[27:40] would like to destroy me with was the
[27:42] very thing that caused me to dive into
[27:43] the message
[27:45] the very thing the very thing that
[27:46] convinced me that these other ministers
[27:48] do not preach the word of god because
[27:49] they want to they don't want to hurt
[27:51] people's feelings they're so concerned
[27:53] with the feelings of individuals they
[27:54] don't stand on the word but here's this
[27:56] man who unadulterately preaches the word
[27:58] of god just the way it is and yet i
[27:59] still know he loves me and it cuts me to
[28:01] shreds and i still know that's the real
[28:03] love of god that's the corrective hand
[28:05] of god no matter how hard it is that's
[28:06] still the loving hand of god that's the
[28:08] tender hand of jehovah no matter how
[28:10] straight and cutting it is it's still
[28:12] the love of god and actually the men
[28:14] that think they're doing people a favor
[28:15] by telling and capitulating to their
[28:17] feelings is the hatred they hate the
[28:19] people the bible says if
[28:21] a mother father doesn't correct their
[28:22] children you hate your children
[28:24] so the new ministers that don't want to
[28:26] tell people the truth they hate you
[28:28] they don't love you now you speak the
[28:31] truth and love but honestly tell the
[28:32] truth
[28:34] if you love someone you'll do that you
[28:36] would do that with your children you'll
[28:37] do that with one another but all of
[28:39] these things you would think that it
[28:40] would destroy me it was setting
[28:42] something up it was bringing my
[28:43] deliverance
[28:45] it was such an interesting thing so i
[28:47] just spent like an hour talking to my
[28:49] kids remembering i was remembering i was
[28:51] going back wow
[28:52] man how he delivered me here from the
[28:54] paul of the bear and oh he delivered me
[28:56] here from the lion oh he delivered me
[28:57] from this oh he delivered me from all
[28:59] these other habits i had in my life and
[29:01] these things that were there to destroy
[29:02] me man just one thing after another but
[29:05] the problem of it is too many times you
[29:06] stop thinking about that
[29:08] why
[29:09] you know what i've realized
[29:11] i don't care what the problem is it's
[29:13] really not a big deal amen it's really
[29:15] not a big deal the only time a problem
[29:18] gets big in your eyes is when god comes
[29:20] out of your view
[29:22] if my eyes are singularly focused upon
[29:24] the fact that god's with me his promises
[29:27] with me he said he would be with me he'd
[29:29] lead me he'd guide me how big does god
[29:31] get when you talk about it
[29:32] you ever think of that you look at how
[29:34] david's acting as he gets to talk oh i
[29:36] remember i remember the hand of god that
[29:38] delivered him oh i remember this he's
[29:40] getting excited
[29:42] he's not worrying about his complexes
[29:44] and his problems and his difficulties in
[29:46] his troubles he's talking about his
[29:48] delivery
[29:49] and it stirred him up again and he
[29:51] realized all these troubles no it just
[29:53] paid paved the way from my deliverance
[29:56] so i began to think of those things and
[29:58] i began to look at all these hebrew
[30:00] children down through the or these
[30:02] individuals we look at through the
[30:03] through the ages daniel shadrach meshach
[30:06] and abednego how they came captive they
[30:08] were prisoners in a land that wasn't
[30:09] their own and here they are they they
[30:12] are told they have to eat meat from the
[30:14] king's table and they remember no we are
[30:17] servants of jehovah
[30:18] no we're not going to defile ourselves
[30:21] with these things these are the things
[30:22] of the word we're not defiling ourselves
[30:25] see they remembered god and when they
[30:27] remembered god and stood for his word
[30:29] god remembered them
[30:31] and when god remembered them he made
[30:32] them fat and happy and looking good and
[30:35] they were what i think it was five seven
[30:37] times better looking than the other ones
[30:38] god took care of them
[30:40] because when they remembered god god
[30:41] remembered them
[30:44] and then you bring it up to shadrach
[30:45] meshach and abednego and here they are
[30:47] and here's an enemy that had risen up
[30:49] and they hated chad raknesha neck and
[30:51] bendigo there was a jealousy and hatred
[30:53] and they were looking to conspire and
[30:55] get these boys destroyed
[30:57] and they were
[30:58] put out a decree that you must bow to
[31:00] this image and here comes the image of
[31:02] belchesar which is an image of daniel
[31:03] and here it comes through the land and
[31:05] and these boys say nope
[31:08] long live the king but we're not bound
[31:09] down to that image we're not bound down
[31:11] to the image of a holy man and this is
[31:13] this thing that you're putting up we're
[31:14] not bowing the need to that it's
[31:15] compromise to the word of god and we're
[31:17] not doing it and so you can kill me you
[31:19] can do whatever you want but i'm still
[31:21] not bowing the need of this false false
[31:22] made religion and as it came up before
[31:25] them okay no problem we're going to take
[31:26] you to the fiery furnace
[31:28] here they go but see they had remembered
[31:30] their promise to god they remembered who
[31:32] they were they remembered what they were
[31:34] on this earth for they even remembered
[31:36] how to act in the in the confines of
[31:38] being a prisoner of babylon
[31:40] here they were this wasn't their home
[31:43] all the pressures around them and they
[31:44] knew they would die if they took this
[31:46] stand that it could and if god didn't
[31:48] deliver them they knew they would die
[31:49] but they said that's okay
[31:51] that's okay we'll die if we must if god
[31:53] god can deliver us but he doesn't have
[31:55] to if he doesn't want to so they didn't
[31:57] have a clue what was going to happen
[31:59] they just knew they were taking their
[32:00] stand for the lord they knew they were
[32:02] standing on the word but this situation
[32:04] was going to lead them right into a fire
[32:07] but oh when they remembered god god
[32:09] remembered them
[32:11] it didn't take long before the presence
[32:13] of the fourth man was revealed and that
[32:15] fire just set them free and it consumed
[32:17] their enemies thereafter a fire heated
[32:20] up seven times it just destroyed all
[32:22] their enemies and set them free
[32:24] oh god works in mysterious ways this
[32:27] wonders to perform
[32:28] don't get nervous don't get upset don't
[32:30] get frustrated just remember amen just
[32:32] stop and remember
[32:35] then you bring it up to daniel same
[32:37] situation here comes daniel and daniel
[32:40] prays every day twice a day i believe it
[32:42] was and his enemies go into action how
[32:45] can we get a get daniel oh they they put
[32:47] together a great plan man this was a
[32:48] good one oh they knew how to catch him
[32:50] this time
[32:51] and daniel
[32:53] never missed a beat
[32:54] it wasn't going to cause anything to him
[32:56] to change he wasn't going to all of a
[32:58] sudden forget he was a servant of the
[33:00] most high god though it could cost him
[33:02] his life he just kept serving the lord
[33:05] he just kept praying
[33:06] he never missed a beat and
[33:09] there he goes here we go into a a den of
[33:12] lions but it didn't matter
[33:14] because he was asked the question is all
[33:17] well with the daniel he said yes the
[33:19] lord has sent his angels to shut the
[33:21] mouths of the lions
[33:23] okay daniel let's see if your enemies if
[33:25] you'll shut the lot mouth of the lions
[33:26] for your enemies
[33:28] nope
[33:29] the very pit of lions
[33:31] set him free glorified god and destroyed
[33:35] his enemies
[33:36] god does this over and over and over so
[33:39] many times we're trying to figure things
[33:41] out don't
[33:43] don't try to figure everything out we
[33:46] are sheep lead
[33:47] i don't know how i'm going to get
[33:48] through the red sea but if you said i'm
[33:49] going i'm going i'm going to get there i
[33:52] don't have to worry about it
[33:54] i begin to think about esther here comes
[33:56] esther on the scene and the very one
[33:58] that's there to try to destroy him
[34:00] little does haman even realize he's
[34:02] setting up for his own demise
[34:05] because esther remembered
[34:08] the instruction of haggai
[34:10] and she was accepted by the king
[34:12] so then in a in a critical moment and at
[34:14] a critical time she had to go into the
[34:16] presence of the king the king remembered
[34:18] her
[34:19] and he loved her
[34:21] and she had a ear with the king and the
[34:23] very gallows and the very uh things that
[34:25] were made to destroy the jews and
[34:27] mordecai heyman hung on his own gallows
[34:30] man see and it set all the jews free
[34:34] it set them all free the very thing that
[34:36] looked like it was going to be their
[34:38] destruction
[34:39] was the very thing that was their
[34:40] deliverance
[34:42] and it was the destruction of their
[34:43] enemies
[34:45] this continues on
[34:48] and as i began to think this through i
[34:50] remember the scripture in proverbs it
[34:51] says whosoever diggeth a pit shall fall
[34:54] therein and he that rolleth the stone it
[34:57] will return upon him amen and the devil
[35:00] goes out and tries to destroy god's
[35:03] elected children and all it does is
[35:05] destroy himself
[35:07] so we just can't forget that these
[35:08] pathways that many times god takes us
[35:10] down it's not for our destruction
[35:12] everyone just relax
[35:15] stir yourself up in the lord and
[35:16] remember what he's done for you yes it's
[35:19] not him that willeth or him that runeth
[35:21] but it's god that showed you mercy
[35:23] the bible says here um i wanted to go to
[35:25] the scripture here in uh
[35:28] psalms 20. it says now know i that the
[35:31] lord saveth his anointed he will hear
[35:34] him from his holy heaven with the saving
[35:37] strength of his right hand
[35:40] some trust in chariots
[35:42] some in horses but we will remember the
[35:45] name of the lord
[35:47] they are brought down
[35:49] and fallen but we are risen and stand
[35:52] upright
[35:54] it's a very simple thought
[35:56] but wow it's a powerful one yes it is if
[36:00] you just remember what did he do for you
[36:02] what did he do for us and so as i began
[36:04] to continue to ponder on this and i
[36:06] began to look here at our own assembly
[36:08] and i would like brother franco if it's
[36:10] okay if you could bring forth a
[36:12] powerpoint
[36:14] and uh so many times like i said earlier
[36:16] we're wanting god to stir us up amen and
[36:20] i think we're supposed to be stirring
[36:21] ourselves up in the lord
[36:22] i think we're supposed to be looking at
[36:24] the promises of god and what he's done
[36:26] for us and it's hard to look at how big
[36:28] he is and all he's done for you and you
[36:30] not get excited about serving the lord
[36:32] and being one of his elect
[36:34] because from the same pulpit if you all
[36:36] remember many years ago
[36:38] there was the um
[36:41] tearing down i would say
[36:43] of the things that we hold so dear
[36:45] respectfully saying those things
[36:47] but we all know those things
[36:49] and in our church here um from this
[36:51] pulpit the things that we hold so dear
[36:54] we're just we're being destroyed and
[36:56] dismantled before our very eyes this is
[36:58] no disrespect but this is home this is
[37:00] family for a second you know we're just
[37:01] talking personal
[37:03] but i'm so glad that god would restore
[37:06] he wouldn't forget about us
[37:09] don't think for a second god's forgotten
[37:11] and i just wanted to bring this back to
[37:13] your attention that many years ago there
[37:15] was quite a move
[37:17] quite a move
[37:18] to try to discredit and destroy
[37:20] everything that we hold dear from this
[37:22] very sacred holy spot
[37:25] and it i find it quite interesting that
[37:28] the focus of the attention
[37:30] was upon what was taken place right here
[37:34] in 1963
[37:36] it was published in may 17th
[37:39] and it happened on february 28 28 days
[37:43] and this was the big point of contention
[37:46] and for some reason this was the point
[37:48] of attack it must be that this is a
[37:51] pretty big deal
[37:53] it must mean that there's something
[37:55] behind this right here that you cannot
[37:57] miss
[37:58] it must mean that this is the capping
[38:01] stone it must mean that this is the
[38:03] thing that'll melt it all together bring
[38:06] the whole mystery the whole mystery plan
[38:08] the whole mystery plan of redemption
[38:11] into view right here
[38:13] and i find it interesting i'll stop for
[38:15] a second here i had i'd gotten a book
[38:17] from the uh from from goodwill it was a
[38:20] big old book and it was the book of
[38:21] history of america for the last hundred
[38:23] years and i began to look through that
[38:25] book and you i couldn't let my daughters
[38:26] look at it it was too graphic it was too
[38:28] horrific if you look at the history of
[38:30] united states in the last hundred years
[38:32] it's a pretty sickening thing to look at
[38:35] you look at the death you look at the
[38:36] destruction you look at the murder you
[38:37] look at the social things that have
[38:39] taken place you see a systematic ripping
[38:41] apart of families and of of the things
[38:43] that god said in order to keep thing all
[38:45] together it's just horrible
[38:47] and it's the entire story of death
[38:50] it's a history and a declaration of
[38:52] death
[38:54] but when god came down in 1963 he
[38:57] decided he was going to not go in those
[38:59] kind of history books he's going to show
[39:00] up in life magazine
[39:02] because this was not a sign or a history
[39:04] point in time we could say that was the
[39:05] time of destruction no this was a point
[39:06] of life
[39:08] this was the thing that was going to
[39:09] bring life in for everybody else to be
[39:12] set free this is a really big deal
[39:15] a very very big deal and brother branham
[39:17] your prophet said this is the
[39:18] vindication of my ministry that this
[39:20] message is the truth
[39:23] so i want to call back to your
[39:24] remembrance what god did for us
[39:27] because from this pulpit a subtle enemy
[39:29] began to work
[39:31] and he began to systematically destroy
[39:33] the very things that we hold dear
[39:35] but god wouldn't let it stand
[39:37] he was not going to let it be destroyed
[39:41] and from this pulpit a sermon was
[39:43] preached
[39:44] saying that was caused by a thor rocket
[39:47] and
[39:48] it's not what we think it is and
[39:50] basically the prophet spoke wrong
[39:53] okay that's that's your opinion
[39:57] and uh
[39:58] so from this pulpit that happened and i
[40:00] want to bring back to you remember in
[40:01] something
[40:02] it was on may 16 2012 10 years ago now
[40:08] time flies but let's not forget
[40:12] to may 16 2012 this cloud was from this
[40:16] pulpit called that it was caused by a
[40:18] thor rocket
[40:20] uh june 29th
[40:22] the next month a huge storm comes
[40:25] through lima with straight-line winds
[40:27] and literally almost rips the roof off
[40:29] of this church and you all know about
[40:31] this
[40:32] it compromised our entire roof system
[40:34] and it caused it to start leaking in
[40:36] here
[40:37] and there used to be we all know that
[40:38] who was here back then there was water
[40:40] leaks everywhere
[40:41] but what's so interesting about that
[40:43] there became a a bit of an issue
[40:46] with the insurance companies and the
[40:48] installers that installed it and there
[40:50] wasn't going to be any money handed out
[40:52] to fix the problem
[40:54] so it sat leaking
[40:56] for two years
[40:58] on may
[40:59] 7 2014
[41:02] two years later
[41:04] a gentleman who had his opinion about
[41:06] what this cloud was resigned from this
[41:08] position and no disregard to demand
[41:11] but when he resigned the next day
[41:14] all the repairs to our roof system that
[41:16] were being battled out with insurance
[41:18] companies was finalized
[41:20] and fixed and sealed and buttoned up
[41:23] the very next day
[41:26] don't forget
[41:28] it was also that same week that we got
[41:30] all new lighting in here that's why i
[41:32] can barely see anything up there it's
[41:34] very bright
[41:36] but it made it bright
[41:38] everything became illuminated
[41:40] everything became
[41:43] much much clearer to see
[41:46] and then it was august 10th
[41:49] that by god's grace
[41:51] god came down
[41:52] and vindicated himself
[41:55] not a man but god amen no disregard you
[41:58] brother chad i don't think you have a
[41:59] problem he's saying that but god uses
[42:01] vessels to vindicate his word
[42:04] and god just used our brother chad to
[42:06] bring back into remembrance no no no no
[42:09] this is not a thor rocket
[42:11] this is the mighty hand of god i saw a
[42:13] cloud the size of a man's hand but i
[42:15] hear an abundance of rain behind it
[42:18] you know you could laugh at it you can
[42:20] make fun of it you could say there's
[42:21] nothing to it that's fine that's your
[42:23] opinion
[42:24] all right but for me i've heard and i
[42:26] have seen i once heard but now i see and
[42:29] i'm feeling the effects of the abundance
[42:31] of rain that followed that cloud that
[42:32] came back through how many of you did
[42:35] none of us could deny what happened none
[42:37] of us could deny that this word became a
[42:39] living word it became a living reality
[42:41] that the word of god was becoming
[42:44] something that was such a thrill to us
[42:45] again here was a man that was destroying
[42:47] the altars but remember god brought a
[42:49] man on the scene one time by the name of
[42:51] elijah and he rebuilt the altar and when
[42:53] he fully obeyed the word of god and he
[42:55] put all the stones back where they were
[42:56] he could step back he didn't have to do
[42:58] anything anymore because god himself
[43:00] would vindicate this to be the truth and
[43:04] god himself vindicated he was here he
[43:07] was in our presence and he was defending
[43:09] himself
[43:10] we don't have to defend him i don't have
[43:13] to argue fuss debate with anybody
[43:16] god vindicates his word my only
[43:18] obligation is to believe it amen and
[43:21] remember the mighty hand of god that has
[43:23] brought us through time and time and
[43:25] time again
[43:26] so bcf little flock that uh assembles
[43:30] here do you remember what he did
[43:33] don't let it become a common thing
[43:35] because that was not common
[43:37] you think it's all by accident that the
[43:39] roof couldn't get fixed
[43:41] you think by accident it had to be the
[43:42] roof that was compromised
[43:44] why the roof
[43:46] why the capping of this building
[43:48] why the very thing that keeps it all
[43:50] sheltered and held together and
[43:51] protected from the elements why that
[43:55] it had to be that it had to be that and
[43:57] that's what had to be fixed when the
[43:59] word was put back in its place
[44:01] when god was back in his position
[44:04] then we could rejoice and we all felt
[44:06] the effects of that abundance of rain
[44:08] that came behind it
[44:09] didn't we
[44:10] i sure did i certainly certainly did and
[44:14] so in just looking at this i didn't even
[44:15] use the powerpoint brother franco i'm
[44:17] sorry
[44:19] so i forgot it was there honestly
[44:21] but we all know what this is he says
[44:23] turn it to the right i heard a voice
[44:25] said turn it to the right he said that's
[44:27] our lord up there
[44:29] see that's not just a picture that's our
[44:31] lord up there that's the vindication of
[44:34] this message that's the vindication that
[44:36] god did not forget about us
[44:39] he didn't forget about us he paid a
[44:41] price 2000 years ago but it was time to
[44:43] redeem the thing he paid the price for
[44:45] he didn't forget about me
[44:48] behold i send you kyle elijah the
[44:51] prophet
[44:53] i'm reading my name into it because i'm
[44:55] a part of it that's mine you can argue
[44:57] you can debate you can fuss you can stay
[45:00] grounded on the things of the earth i'm
[45:01] sorry i'm looking up a little bit higher
[45:02] i see a cloud and i hear an abundance of
[45:05] rain and i'm getting caught up into it
[45:08] every day by his grace
[45:10] so behind this cloud
[45:12] we all remember there was a rainbow
[45:14] covenant and i'd like you to look if you
[45:16] don't mind oh no i have it in here
[45:18] brother franco see i'm all a mess
[45:20] but this rainbow covenant it was over
[45:21] the cloud and we saw in revelations 10 7
[45:23] a mighty angel that descended out of
[45:25] heaven with a cloud above his head don't
[45:26] forget he remembered his promise to you
[45:30] he's coming to redeem his promise and
[45:31] bring you back into your perfect view
[45:35] and it says here brother ban i thought
[45:38] maybe the voice means turn it to turn it
[45:40] to the right and when i did i seen the
[45:42] hoffman's head of christ at 33. here
[45:44] look in here see his black beard his
[45:47] face his nose his eyes his nose
[45:50] everything else see the part of his hair
[45:53] here coming up and his wit his his wig
[45:55] with a white angel wig
[45:57] to show that this message of him being
[46:00] god is the truth
[46:02] he is the supreme judge of the universe
[46:05] supreme judge of heaven and earth he is
[46:08] god and nothing else but god he is god
[46:12] expressed in human form called the son
[46:15] of god which is the sun and which the
[46:18] sun was a mask and if we don't make our
[46:20] message exactly right identified by the
[46:23] scripture identified in service
[46:26] identified by his presence the same
[46:28] yesterday today and forever therefore
[46:31] those seven seals are the truth brethren
[46:34] amen
[46:35] to me i'm rejoicing in this promise that
[46:38] god did not forsake us
[46:40] he could have but he didn't
[46:43] it's not our merit it's not anything we
[46:44] did right there's none of us that did
[46:46] anything right it was his grace
[46:49] it was all grace grace to you grace to
[46:52] me he didn't have to but he did
[46:55] i'm so glad that he did he must have had
[46:57] a couple hebrew children he's going to
[46:58] let him get right up to the fiery
[47:00] furnace he's going to make it look like
[47:02] this thing is done it's destroyed and
[47:04] it's over but don't worry i'm going to
[47:06] come deliver my children myself and the
[47:08] presence of the fourth man has been
[47:10] clearly revealed amongst us speaking to
[47:12] our needs i told you this is a strange
[47:15] church this is a church when you come
[47:16] and you ask a question god speaks back
[47:18] yes amen this is the presence of god
[47:20] unveiled before your very eyes hidden in
[47:23] simplicity but yet speaking nonetheless
[47:26] and those seven stars that were in his
[47:27] hand and i just was reminded of elijah
[47:30] there on that showdown i love how elijah
[47:32] he just did what the word told him to do
[47:35] nothing more
[47:37] never added anything never took anything
[47:39] away he just said lord i've done all you
[47:42] told me to do
[47:43] and god himself vindicated it he
[47:45] vindicated that he was god that this was
[47:48] his message and what he said was or this
[47:49] was his messenger and what he said was
[47:52] the truth
[47:53] god himself vindicated and then he goes
[47:55] to pray because he said i hear an
[47:57] abundance of rain coming and then he has
[47:59] gaza his his servant go up there and he
[48:01] has to go up seven times
[48:03] and on the seventh time and remember
[48:04] geheza eventually backslides he's
[48:07] stricken with leprosy because he he
[48:08] cares he cares too much about money and
[48:10] popularity so he didn't even believe
[48:12] fully this message because he went up
[48:14] there and says i just see a little cloud
[48:15] the size of a man's hand oh elijah says
[48:17] ah no i hear an abundance of rain behind
[48:19] that cloud you don't realize what's
[48:21] behind that cloud no that's the
[48:23] confirmation that this message is the
[48:25] truth
[48:26] and so that you look at that pillar of
[48:27] fire above the the head of brother
[48:29] branham i don't know maybe it's just me
[48:30] but it also looks like a hand at an
[48:32] angle and i look at the other side and i
[48:35] know brother chad even preached on the
[48:36] seven stars in the hand of god
[48:39] so it's fitting that it's the hand of
[48:41] god upon his seventh angel messenger his
[48:43] seventh star
[48:48] sorry i'm getting excited remembering
[48:50] what god's been doing in my age i'm
[48:51] sorry
[48:53] sorry
[48:54] okay at the end of the day sports don't
[48:57] excite me football don't excite me
[48:58] nothing else excites me this stuff
[48:59] excites me guys here i am laying on a
[49:02] roof
[49:03] 22 years ago saying lord if i know where
[49:05] you are whatever mountain you're on i'll
[49:07] forsake all and go climb that mountain
[49:10] by god's grace i've been climbing
[49:12] i've been i didn't realize i was
[49:13] climbing
[49:14] climbing mount sunset seeing the
[49:15] revelation of the mystery of god
[49:17] unveiled in my hour where the very
[49:19] headship of god himself the word is
[49:21] coming back and uniting with the bride
[49:24] and isn't it interesting you know
[49:25] there's sometimes a debate on whether or
[49:27] not this is the coming of the lord can i
[49:28] just throw out a little thought maybe
[49:29] i'm wrong this is me but just moving by
[49:31] inspiration here for a second but when
[49:33] god came to abraham and he said i am
[49:35] going to visit you according to the time
[49:37] of life he first gave the word and then
[49:39] the manifestation of the word to follow
[49:41] when god said in genesis 1 let there be
[49:44] light what was that the word but when
[49:46] the light sprang forth there it was the
[49:48] manifestation of the promise that he
[49:50] made and so what god said in 1963 the
[49:53] coming of the lord the revealing of the
[49:54] seven seals and the mysteries of god
[49:56] made known a perfect interpretation of
[49:58] the word of god it was his coming and
[50:00] now the manifestation of the word i'm
[50:03] looking at it every single day the
[50:05] seventh seal is being unveiled every
[50:07] single day it's peeling back the mystery
[50:09] of my life and of your life and you're
[50:11] finding yourself as part of the mystery
[50:13] of god that was hidden from the
[50:14] foundation of the world
[50:16] and so oh can i keep going for a second
[50:18] i'm sorry i'm really done i don't have
[50:19] any more notes but i'd like to go for
[50:20] just a moment
[50:22] i remember i was speaking at my
[50:23] grandma's funeral and i was trying to
[50:25] think of what i would say and i i
[50:28] i was looking at and i had been handed
[50:29] an obituary from the funeral home and
[50:32] the obituary you always seen in a
[50:33] picture it's a picture of a face with a
[50:35] name
[50:36] then if you go and you read the story
[50:38] the mystery of the person is unveiled
[50:41] and so when i looked at that picture and
[50:43] i began to read the min the mystery of
[50:45] this person first it was a name but then
[50:46] i found out they were born at a certain
[50:48] time and they had these certain chil
[50:49] this this mother and this father they
[50:51] were a daughter and then as the mystery
[50:52] continues to unveil of this person they
[50:54] became a wife and then as the mystery
[50:56] continues to unveil it they realize
[50:58] they're a mother they have children and
[51:00] the ministry continued to unveil they
[51:02] were a grandmother and this was their
[51:03] purpose and this is what they did and it
[51:06] so
[51:06] did something to me
[51:08] because i realized in this natural life
[51:11] when someone's picture goes in a
[51:13] newspaper it's the end of something
[51:16] but when a famous person and i looked up
[51:18] obituaries i looked up that what is an
[51:21] obituary and the by and uh google is
[51:23] there's a certain like a funeral said
[51:25] what is a proper obituary well a proper
[51:26] obituary must contain the name of the
[51:28] individual what uh part of the family
[51:30] they were in what was the full extent of
[51:32] the family who is all in the family and
[51:35] uh what was their purpose what were the
[51:36] things that interested them in their
[51:37] life right okay and where the funeral
[51:39] arrangements will be held and but it
[51:41] says in in parentheses it says but for
[51:44] someone famous
[51:45] usually you will find their obituary in
[51:48] nationally publicized publications
[51:51] i said well praise god
[51:55] god god didn't show the cloud and lima
[51:58] lima news
[52:00] he came to life magazine
[52:03] because he had to vindicate this isn't a
[52:05] death this isn't an ending this is a
[52:07] beginning
[52:08] what people will realize as time goes on
[52:10] that that cloud was signifying the
[52:11] beginning of something not the ending of
[52:14] something we're not looking back at a
[52:15] cloud from 50 years ago saying well that
[52:17] was a wonderful event no that cloud is
[52:19] now defining my purpose on this earth
[52:22] that cloud is now defining my everyday
[52:24] motive my objective where i'm going what
[52:26] i'm doing because i found out when i was
[52:28] understanding the mystery that was
[52:29] unfolding behind this name of jesus
[52:30] christ i found out he had a family
[52:33] and as i started to peel back the
[52:34] mystery of jesus christ i found out hey
[52:36] he had a son
[52:37] and that son was me and so on unveiling
[52:40] the mystery of that cloud right there i
[52:42] unveiled the mystery of my life and
[52:44] you've been unveiled in the mystery of
[52:45] your life and why you pecul cool your
[52:47] birth and why you had the parents you
[52:49] had and why you ended up here and why
[52:51] you just happened to have brother chad a
[52:53] friend out in cincinnati called jeremy
[52:54] sanders you know and why did he have to
[52:56] have this kind of a friend why couldn't
[52:57] he have different friends no it had to
[52:59] be that friend at that time at that
[53:00] moment and that friend had to tell you
[53:02] about something that was going to
[53:03] quicken a seed
[53:05] your peculiar life your misunderstood
[53:08] life your questions shouldn't have any
[53:10] god knows exactly what he's doing so
[53:14] just go back and remember what he did
[53:16] for you amen it's all had a purpose all
[53:18] along the way
[53:20] this isn't done it's just begun
[53:23] i don't care what anybody says i don't
[53:25] care what scoffers may say i don't care
[53:27] if there's a it doesn't matter to me
[53:28] anymore it really doesn't matter i'm
[53:30] moving on
[53:31] i'm going
[53:32] because i already got caught up into it
[53:35] i already got caught up into it i'm
[53:37] sorry
[53:39] it's too late for me
[53:41] you'll have to work on somebody else
[53:44] and i remember this in genesis
[53:46] i stumbled across it and god said this
[53:48] is a token of my covenant which i'm i
[53:50] make between me and you and every living
[53:53] creature that is with you for perpetual
[53:56] generations i do set my bow in a cl in
[53:59] the cloud and it shall be a token of a
[54:02] covenant between me and the earth and it
[54:05] shall come to pass when i bring a cloud
[54:07] over the earth that a bow shall be seen
[54:09] in the cloud and i will remember
[54:13] my covenant
[54:16] and so god didn't
[54:18] forget
[54:19] god knew what he was doing the most
[54:21] sublime scripture in all the bible
[54:23] revelations 5 when a bloody lamb would
[54:26] come and take the book and loose the
[54:28] seals and unveil the mystery that he had
[54:30] hid for 2 000 years that god himself was
[54:34] going to unite himself with man again
[54:36] and she'll be a prisoner a love slave to
[54:38] his word and his word only
[54:41] living simple humble christian lives
[54:44] but love slaves prisoners to his word
[54:47] and his word only
[54:49] musicians will you come praise god i
[54:52] would like to just
[54:53] um
[54:54] share
[54:56] i'll finish with that one but i want to
[54:57] read you this for a second
[54:59] testimony
[55:00] as i stood there watching them they got
[55:02] closer and closer and they turned and
[55:04] walked out in the woods and i just stood
[55:06] there just dumbfounded this is a story
[55:08] when brother branham was in the woods
[55:10] and he had a
[55:12] i think there was a couple three deer
[55:14] that came up before him if i remember
[55:15] the story right and he could have shot
[55:17] all three deer but he had told god he
[55:19] knew that bothered god he knew that he
[55:21] didn't like that because he was shooting
[55:23] dear for all of his friends and if you
[55:24] know anything about brother branham you
[55:26] know he had some complexes he loved the
[55:29] affection of people he loved people he
[55:31] had been rejected from his entire
[55:33] childhood made fun of as a boy he had
[55:35] those scars in his life you know but he
[55:38] had remembered a promise that he made to
[55:40] god he said i won't do that no more
[55:43] and here he got up in this the mountains
[55:45] and he had the perfect opportunity three
[55:47] deer standing right in front of me said
[55:48] i could shoot them all in three seconds
[55:50] they'd all be mine one for brother woods
[55:51] one for another brother and one for
[55:53] himself
[55:54] and when i and and they went away and
[55:56] the voice spoke down down again and the
[55:58] sun was shining on my back he said you
[56:00] remembered your promise didn't you
[56:02] i said yes lord i remembered my promise
[56:06] i know that's you and i can't see you
[56:08] lord but i know you're here somewhere i
[56:10] said i don't see you but i hear your
[56:12] voice i know you're here said you kept
[56:15] your promise
[56:16] you re
[56:19] sorry
[56:23] you you remembered your promise you
[56:26] remembered your promise
[56:28] sorry you remembered me yes
[56:33] um and i remembered mine too
[56:37] i'll never leave you nor forsake you
[56:41] see it's not just when i remember my
[56:43] promise to god but oh when he remembers
[56:45] his promise to me that means the world
[56:47] to me to know that i stood for his word
[56:50] he'll stand for me that's all i can do i
[56:52] don't know how to do anything else
[56:54] honestly as i'm getting older i'm
[56:55] realizing i'm just a miserable failure
[56:56] at everything anyhow i really can't do
[56:58] anything right anyhow the only thing
[57:00] that's been right was the grace of god
[57:02] that helped me in this life to see the
[57:04] truth in this hour
[57:05] and i ain't taking it for granted it
[57:07] means everything to me
[57:12] notice in colossians the 18th verse in
[57:14] the book of colossians it says now he is
[57:17] the head of the church the body who is
[57:19] the beginning the firstborn from the
[57:22] dead that in that in all things he might
[57:25] have the preeminences he is the head of
[57:27] the church which is his body and he and
[57:30] he wants his preeminences now listen
[57:33] close while we're going what he is going
[57:35] to be the head of the body his bride's
[57:37] body which is taken from him flesh and
[57:40] bone like in adam the bride born from
[57:43] the dead sea that's born from the dead
[57:46] sin of unbelief what killed eve unbelief
[57:49] is that right
[57:50] their unbelief in what
[57:53] by for in unbelief in god no
[57:56] she had faith in god sure did she say
[57:59] there is no god no sir
[58:01] she wasn't an infidel well she said you
[58:04] know i don't believe his word at all no
[58:08] no she believed all but one little thing
[58:11] amen that's all it took
[58:14] god wanted the preeminences and god is
[58:16] gaining the preeminences
[58:18] will you stand with me
[58:23] so i delivered my soul i don't know what
[58:25] to tell you
[58:26] i i have nothing more to say
[58:27] everything's that needed to be said i
[58:29] think has been said um he didn't tell me
[58:32] to go south or
[58:33] or west or anything
[58:35] but
[58:36] i hope you're encouraged
[58:39] i love you all very very much
[58:41] stir yourself up in the lord
[58:44] parents go home and talk to your kids
[58:46] tell them about the stones that were
[58:48] built up where god delivered you
[58:50] i think it'll be a tremendous thing
[58:51] sometimes i think we overthink this
[58:53] thing i think you really just need to
[58:54] testify and tell of what he did for you
[58:57] let him see the life that was manifested
[59:00] for you by his grace
[59:02] let him let them see i think in my my
[59:04] own opinion i let them see the mighty
[59:06] hand of god the right hand of god that
[59:08] delivered you time and time again
[59:11] and they can sit back one of these days
[59:13] when they come up to a red sea and
[59:15] they'll say you know what i remember
[59:16] this story before
[59:18] like david i remember this when they
[59:21] can't figure out where to go i remember
[59:23] my dad told me a story one time that it
[59:26] looked like he was led right up to the
[59:27] red sea but god took him right through
[59:29] the red sea he couldn't see his
[59:31] footsteps but god delivered him
[59:33] and then they'll be having encouraging
[59:35] and then they'll start talking like
[59:36] david talked about when they remembered
[59:39] when they remembered
[59:41] i'm so glad god remembered
[59:43] i'm so glad i don't know why i just want
[59:46] to say that it's just
[59:47] it's not that we just it's not that we
