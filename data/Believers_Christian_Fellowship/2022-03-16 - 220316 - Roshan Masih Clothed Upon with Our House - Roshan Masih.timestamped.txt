[7:37] so tonight i would like to read
[7:40] from the book of revelation chapter 6.
[7:44] verse 9 to 11.
[7:54] revelation chapter 6 9 to 11.
[8:01] and when he had opened the fifth seal
[8:05] i saw under the altar
[8:08] the souls of them that were slain for
[8:10] the word of god
[8:12] and for the testimony which they held
[8:16] and they cried with a loud voice saying
[8:20] how long o lord holy and true do us to
[8:25] thou
[8:26] not judge and avenge our blood on them
[8:29] that dwell on the earth
[8:31] and white robes were given unto every
[8:34] one of them
[8:36] and it was certain to them
[8:38] that they should rest yet for a little
[8:41] season
[8:42] until their fellow servants also
[8:45] and their brethren that should be killed
[8:48] as they were
[8:49] should be fulfilled
[8:52] may the lord have his blessings
[8:56] you may be seated please
[9:10] so we thank the message of the hour
[9:13] sending us a prophet
[9:16] and
[9:17] our understandings
[9:19] has been
[9:20] cleared and we
[9:22] do not think according to the
[9:25] denominational way
[9:27] but we have the revelation
[9:30] and
[9:33] said pray for the revelation
[9:36] and we know that revelation is a
[9:39] prevailing power
[9:41] so god has given us in this day
[9:44] the prevailing power
[9:46] through the opening of the world
[9:48] so we are
[9:50] most privileged people on the earth
[9:53] we have the full understanding of the
[9:56] word of god
[9:58] and
[10:01] god
[10:02] revealed
[10:04] the mysteries to him
[10:06] and we know that he preached on the
[10:08] seals
[10:09] and we know that
[10:12] this
[10:13] portion of scripture we have read
[10:16] talks about the jewish
[10:19] youth people
[10:21] and
[10:22] tonight i will like to preach on
[10:26] uh
[10:28] the like we have read here
[10:30] that
[10:33] they are the souls under the altar but
[10:36] they are crying for
[10:38] revenge
[10:39] and then the lord said unto them that
[10:43] they should rest yet for a little season
[10:46] and
[10:47] lord said to them wait
[10:50] for the little season until they until
[10:53] that time
[10:55] god
[10:56] provided them
[10:59] white robes
[11:02] so my subject is clothed upon with our
[11:05] house
[11:07] and we see that when he opened the fifth
[11:10] seal
[11:12] uh there are
[11:14] souls under the altar
[11:17] john
[11:18] saw them
[11:19] and
[11:21] the souls
[11:23] these souls are
[11:25] of them that were slain for the word of
[11:28] god
[11:29] and
[11:31] they held the testimony
[11:34] they lived
[11:36] and
[11:37] they stood faithful
[11:40] and they given their life
[11:43] for the world they held
[11:46] they believed
[11:48] and we know that they were killed
[11:51] slain
[11:53] and
[11:54] the bible say they cried with the lord
[11:56] voice saying how long o lord
[11:59] holy and true
[12:01] doers
[12:02] do not judge and awains
[12:05] our blood on them that dwell on the
[12:07] earth
[12:09] so they were killed
[12:10] they were slain
[12:12] and now
[12:13] they are in another dimension
[12:17] and they are asking for
[12:20] awareness
[12:21] and asking the lord and we know that
[12:24] their bodies were destroyed
[12:26] because they were slain
[12:29] and
[12:30] some were gassed in the gas chambers
[12:32] some were burned to death
[12:35] some were short
[12:36] some were cremated in the oven
[12:39] some were slain in the
[12:41] holocaust some were
[12:44] persecuted and hunted down we know that
[12:48] they all are jews brother branham said
[12:50] and they were killed by different
[12:52] different
[12:53] ways
[12:54] and now they are
[12:57] in another dimension
[12:59] and their bodies are killed
[13:02] and they are gone
[13:04] to
[13:05] another place
[13:07] and
[13:08] even they are there
[13:12] but they
[13:14] want leaving
[13:16] and asking the lord
[13:18] they remember
[13:21] how they were killed
[13:24] because when we die
[13:26] we do not forget anything
[13:30] they still remember
[13:32] and
[13:34] though they are
[13:36] believer
[13:37] [Music]
[13:39] and they believe the word of god
[13:41] and they had a testimony
[13:43] that they helped too
[13:45] still
[13:46] they are full of
[13:48] anger
[13:50] they are still full of
[13:53] revenge
[13:54] and asking the lord
[13:56] to
[13:58] even they are crying
[13:59] praying
[14:01] asking the lord to revenge because we
[14:04] were killed slain
[14:06] but
[14:10] lord said wait
[14:12] they went into the other life
[14:15] still remembering it and crying out
[14:18] but ranam said when you die
[14:21] you do not forget anything
[14:23] you are still conscious but ranam said
[14:26] when the souls
[14:28] our souls are not kind of sleeping there
[14:32] they are conscious
[14:34] they know everything
[14:36] when we die
[14:39] we are here and that dimension is
[14:42] right here
[14:43] not somewhere else right here so we are
[14:46] just go other side
[14:48] and the people are like this
[14:51] maybe few seconds we don't know
[14:54] if
[14:54] and we see the same
[14:57] different world same kind of people
[14:59] there
[15:01] and we remember everything
[15:05] we know in the bible about
[15:07] largest and that rich man
[15:10] they both died and went beyond the
[15:15] curtain
[15:17] and
[15:18] that rich man knows everything he
[15:21] remember
[15:22] and he said lord
[15:24] send someone send a large rest
[15:27] and i have five brothers
[15:30] and
[15:32] let someone go and preach
[15:34] that they may not come in this
[15:37] tormented place
[15:39] so he remember everything
[15:42] so these souls
[15:44] under the altar
[15:45] they remember
[15:47] how they were killed
[15:49] what happened to them
[15:51] and they are asking for revenge and the
[15:54] bible says 11 words
[15:57] and white robes were given unto every
[16:00] one of them
[16:02] and it was said unto them
[16:04] that they should rest yet for a little
[16:07] season until their fellow servants
[16:11] also and their brethren
[16:13] that should be killed as they were
[16:16] should be fulfilled
[16:18] amen
[16:19] so white robes
[16:21] were given
[16:23] unto them
[16:26] they were just souls
[16:29] and crying until the altar
[16:33] and then lord provided
[16:36] given to them white robes
[16:39] and when
[16:41] they received the white robes god said
[16:44] rest for a while
[16:46] and
[16:49] wait
[16:51] so i'm going to read few scripture about
[16:53] the white robe
[16:55] from the bible
[16:57] what is rule
[16:59] matthew
[17:00] 17 2 mount of transfiguration
[17:04] and if you will search you will find
[17:06] many quotes
[17:09] has spoken about it
[17:12] and was transfigured
[17:14] before them
[17:16] and his face did shine
[17:18] as the sun
[17:20] and his raiment was white as the light
[17:25] so
[17:26] his robe his raymond
[17:28] was
[17:30] white as the light
[17:33] mark 9 3
[17:36] mark 9 3
[17:38] and the his raymond becomes shining
[17:42] exceeding white
[17:44] as snow
[17:45] so as no filler on earth can white
[17:49] them
[17:51] so that was not his
[17:54] dress his clothes he was wearing
[17:57] because the bible says
[17:59] his raiment became shining
[18:02] exceeding white
[18:04] as snow
[18:06] and revelation 3 5
[18:11] revelation 3 5
[18:13] he that overcometh
[18:16] the same shall be clothed in white
[18:19] raymond
[18:20] and i will not blot out his name out of
[18:24] the book of life
[18:26] but i will confess his name
[18:28] before my father
[18:30] and before his angels
[18:35] one
[18:37] scripture
[18:39] revelation 3 17 18
[18:43] because thousands i am rich
[18:46] and increased with goods
[18:48] and have need of nothing
[18:50] and knows not that
[18:53] thou art wretched and miserable and poor
[18:57] and blind and naked
[19:00] i consell thee to buy of me ghoul
[19:04] fried in the fire that thou mayest be
[19:07] rich
[19:08] and white raymond
[19:10] that thou must be clothed
[19:13] and that the shame of the nakedness do
[19:17] not appear
[19:18] and anoint thine eyes with i said
[19:22] that thou mayest see
[19:25] one more scripture
[19:28] maybe two revelation 4 4
[19:32] and round about the throne were 4 and 20
[19:37] seeds
[19:38] and upon the seeds i saw
[19:41] four and twenty elders sitting
[19:44] clothed
[19:45] in white raiment
[19:47] and they had on their heads crowns of
[19:50] gold
[19:56] revelation 7 9
[19:59] after this i beheld
[20:02] beheld and lo
[20:04] a great multitude
[20:06] which no man could number of all nations
[20:10] and kindreds and people and tongues
[20:13] stood before the throne and before the
[20:16] land
[20:17] clothed
[20:18] with white robes
[20:21] and palms in their
[20:22] hands
[20:25] so these are some scriptures
[20:29] tells us about the white robe
[20:34] and
[20:37] i would like to read another scripture
[20:40] from the book of 2nd corinthians
[20:43] chapter 5
[20:45] then we will
[20:46] move further
[20:51] paul is writing
[20:54] in this great teaching here
[20:56] because he had two
[21:00] gone beyond the curtain
[21:02] and he met people there
[21:05] and he talked with them
[21:08] and he heard many things
[21:10] and he did not tell to anyone
[21:14] 14 years he kept silence
[21:18] and after 14 years
[21:21] one day
[21:22] he told that i know one man who was
[21:25] caught up in heaven
[21:28] many times some experience
[21:31] supernatural
[21:33] happened to us
[21:35] and we are so quick to tell others
[21:39] there are some
[21:42] some
[21:43] supernatural
[21:47] that must be between us and god
[21:53] many things brother branham never told
[21:58] something should be
[22:01] in us and god
[22:03] we should not disclose everything
[22:07] so paul never told to anyone 14 years
[22:12] and when he told
[22:15] even
[22:16] he did not disclose
[22:18] everything he just said he went there
[22:21] and he went went there
[22:23] and he met
[22:24] people and he saw them
[22:28] and then he
[22:30] started to
[22:31] disclose
[22:34] wrote things about them little by little
[22:36] so paul is writing in this great
[22:38] teaching here because he had gone there
[22:42] and he saw celestial's bodies there
[22:45] and
[22:47] how he is writing concerning these
[22:50] things
[22:52] ii corinthians 5 1
[22:55] 4 we know that if
[22:57] our earthly house of this tabernacle
[23:01] were dissolved
[23:02] we have a building of god
[23:06] and house not made with hands eternal in
[23:10] the heavens
[23:11] amen
[23:13] he said we know
[23:16] we know that
[23:19] he is certain
[23:23] amen he is not guessing
[23:26] this is not
[23:27] any kind of
[23:29] hoping
[23:30] or guessing
[23:32] or just imagination
[23:34] but he is very certain about this
[23:37] he says we know this
[23:41] we are not assuming this
[23:43] we are not supposing this
[23:46] this is not a theory
[23:49] because the one talking here he
[23:52] experienced this
[23:55] he was caught up in that dimension in
[23:57] that place
[23:59] and he saw the house there
[24:02] he saw the tabernacle there
[24:04] he saw the heavenly celestial's body
[24:07] there
[24:09] so he said we don't hope it
[24:13] not hoping that maybe it could be right
[24:16] or wrong
[24:18] but he know exactly
[24:21] he went in that land he saw these things
[24:26] he says we know this
[24:29] if this earthly house talking about our
[24:32] body this body physical body
[24:35] this is a house
[24:37] and we are wearing this house
[24:41] i am wearing this
[24:42] for 49 years
[24:46] and it's getting old
[24:48] and he said we are
[24:51] we know that if this tabernacle this
[24:54] house
[24:57] is
[24:58] dissolved
[25:00] this past horse vrabranam said this
[25:02] pastors
[25:04] pastors is
[25:06] all kind of diseases and sickness full
[25:08] with all kind of this and infirmities
[25:11] and all that
[25:13] so born of a woman this past horse
[25:16] full of trouble few days
[25:19] if it dissolve
[25:21] we have a building
[25:23] say
[25:24] a building of god
[25:26] and house not made with hands
[25:30] no temple but eternal house
[25:34] and there is one form of eternal brother
[25:37] and sister
[25:38] and that's god's own life
[25:42] amen
[25:43] this is not
[25:44] temporal
[25:46] not temporary but this is eternal
[25:50] that means having no beginning
[25:53] and no end
[25:55] eternal in the heavens not in the grave
[25:58] somewhere
[26:00] but ranam said if somebody tells you
[26:02] that i'm
[26:03] died said don't believe.
[26:07] amen because christian don't die he said
[26:10] don't believe that i'm dead
[26:12] i am somewhere
[26:14] other side in another dimension
[26:17] so that house is an eternal house
[26:21] amen and that house is in heaven
[26:25] when we die we are we
[26:27] are we goes in our body there
[26:31] amen
[26:32] so
[26:34] poor in this house we groan second verse
[26:38] earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[26:42] with our house which is from heaven
[26:46] amen
[26:48] so paul says
[26:50] we know that it is certain
[26:52] and he knows because he went there
[26:56] and he says when this earthly dissolve
[27:00] fell
[27:01] die we have another
[27:04] and that another house is an eternal
[27:07] horse
[27:09] amen
[27:11] and
[27:12] that house
[27:14] he said we are
[27:16] growing groaning
[27:21] we are groaning earnestly and
[27:24] necessarily desiring
[27:26] to be clothed upon with our house
[27:32] in this age of the rapture are you
[27:36] earnestly desiring
[27:39] to put upon
[27:42] your house which is heavenly
[27:45] when seven
[27:46] angels descended
[27:49] and all the mysteries the seals being
[27:52] opened
[27:53] and the word has been given to the bride
[27:57] are you and nestle desiring
[28:01] to go there
[28:02] are you endnessly desiring
[28:05] to
[28:07] change your body
[28:09] and dwell in that horse
[28:13] amen
[28:14] when you see all these earthquakes
[28:18] tsunamis
[28:20] volcanoes
[28:22] floods
[28:23] krona
[28:25] ukraine russia conflict all that
[28:28] are you earnestly desiring
[28:33] to put upon that house
[28:37] this is an age
[28:42] where we are on the walls of the
[28:45] eternity
[28:47] one of these days we are going
[28:50] this world is going to be perished
[28:53] finished
[28:54] and we are not identifying ourselves
[28:57] with the world
[28:59] amen we are identifying
[29:02] ourselves with the message the gospel
[29:05] jesus christ who revealed himself
[29:09] amen so we see that when the seventh
[29:13] seal is open
[29:15] when the book is open
[29:17] the word
[29:18] is given to us
[29:20] amen the holy ghost is loose
[29:23] upon the church
[29:26] that he may
[29:28] take the hardship
[29:30] that we may be
[29:33] led by the holy spirit
[29:35] do not follow men
[29:37] so when
[29:40] god has given us all the material
[29:43] which we needed for our journey and to
[29:46] get there are you and nestle desiring
[29:53] to be clothed upon with your house
[29:57] are you necessary desiring to be clothed
[30:00] upon with your house
[30:03] those souls were under expectation
[30:08] they were
[30:09] asking the lord
[30:11] for that event
[30:13] but the
[30:16] ropes were provided to them
[30:18] house were provided to them
[30:22] and three words if so be that being
[30:25] clothed
[30:26] we shall not be found naked
[30:30] so here in
[30:32] we wear something
[30:34] and when we do not where we
[30:37] pond naked we are naked
[30:40] watch the language here
[30:43] clothed and naked
[30:46] said if we are not clothed
[30:48] we will be found
[30:50] naked
[30:57] naked
[30:59] and clothed
[31:02] is there any nakedness
[31:06] and
[31:08] clothing in the spiritual world
[31:16] paul says if we will not be clothed
[31:19] we will
[31:20] be naked
[31:24] and
[31:27] clothed
[31:28] with what
[31:32] with an house with the house
[31:36] we are going to wear house
[31:41] and jesus said
[31:42] i am going to prepare a place a house a
[31:45] mansion for you
[31:47] in my father's house are many mansions
[31:50] if it were not so i would have told you
[31:55] amen
[31:56] so if you are not clothed with that
[31:59] house
[32:02] and you have no house to be clothed upon
[32:06] with
[32:07] you will be found naked
[32:12] so then we must
[32:15] make sure
[32:17] that we have the house there
[32:20] otherwise we will go
[32:23] and there is no house to wear
[32:26] no house to put upon
[32:29] and we will be naked there
[32:36] and
[32:37] paul says
[32:41] we will be
[32:42] you will be pond naked if you don't have
[32:45] that house
[32:48] clothing is connected to
[32:52] glory and honor
[32:55] and nakedness is connected to shame and
[32:58] embarrassment
[33:02] why would we want to be clothed
[33:05] so that we shall not be found naked
[33:11] and when we are naked it is shame
[33:15] embarrassment
[33:18] but when we are clothed
[33:20] it's
[33:22] an honor
[33:26] amen
[33:28] in other words
[33:32] we die here
[33:37] and we go other side
[33:40] and we have not a house there to wear
[33:44] and we are naked there
[33:47] we are just a soul
[33:49] because there were souls under the earth
[33:52] they were just soul
[33:55] and we will be souls only
[33:59] naked there
[34:01] because there is no
[34:03] house
[34:08] let me read branham's
[34:11] message
[34:13] mean i mean to say good
[34:18] i mean to say before i read quote
[34:23] our time is
[34:24] finished
[34:26] on earth
[34:28] and
[34:30] we die
[34:32] and
[34:35] lose this first body
[34:38] and then we go other side
[34:42] and we have not
[34:44] another body other side
[34:48] then we
[34:50] are naked there
[34:52] bubranam said
[34:57] the message is the countdown
[35:00] 62. then i think the fifth dimension is
[35:04] where the sinner goes
[35:06] when dies
[35:08] now i think that when the sinner dies
[35:11] he goes to
[35:14] this dimension notice the first thing
[35:17] he cannot go in the presence of god
[35:20] because he is
[35:22] a sinner
[35:24] and his time is up on earth
[35:27] he did not repent
[35:29] he's not covered with the blood
[35:32] and he died as a sinner
[35:35] when he died as a sinner
[35:38] he
[35:38] his days are over finished
[35:42] and now he goes there other side
[35:46] he cannot go in the presence of god
[35:49] because he's not covered with the blood
[35:52] he's not a repentant person
[35:59] and his time is up on earth
[36:04] if
[36:04] i would type it for you
[36:07] it is like trying to go to sleep
[36:10] and you are in a
[36:12] you cannot
[36:14] be asleep
[36:15] and you are in a nightmare
[36:19] hide your things
[36:20] you are screaming
[36:22] you are just
[36:24] that is the state of the wicked dead
[36:31] life
[36:32] he cannot go in the presence of god
[36:35] because he is a sinner
[36:37] he cannot return back to the earth
[36:39] because his time is up
[36:42] and he is caught between the two things
[36:45] in the fifth dimension
[36:47] he has got a soul
[36:50] and he cannot go in the presence of god
[36:53] because it is not covered by the blood
[36:58] he is a sinner
[37:00] he cannot wake himself up
[37:03] because his times
[37:05] is up on earth
[37:10] so that's why anyone who die they sell
[37:14] is so rest in peace they pray for little
[37:17] prayer all the time anybody in any
[37:21] religion if somebody die they want to
[37:23] pray for his soul
[37:25] may he so rest in peace but there is no
[37:28] rest for the wicked the bible says
[37:31] the rest is only for the righteous
[37:34] for them who are covered with the blood
[37:37] super brahnam says because his time is
[37:40] up on the earth
[37:42] and he cannot go in the presence of god
[37:47] cannot come back
[37:49] cannot go further he is between
[37:53] like we are between
[37:55] uh
[37:56] we are not asleep
[37:58] we are in a nightmare
[38:01] tormentation
[38:04] crying
[38:05] weeping
[38:07] scared
[38:09] this kind of situation is when sinner
[38:11] died the wicked
[38:14] so there he is in a tormented nightmare
[38:18] babran
[38:19] and when a synonym
[38:22] is caught
[38:23] with his soul between earth and hell in
[38:27] a nightmare
[38:28] there he stands
[38:32] see how
[38:38] miserable is this to die without jesus
[38:42] without the salvation
[38:45] without the covering
[38:48] of the blood
[38:52] it's very
[38:56] means painful or cannot bear
[39:03] but paul here
[39:07] second corinthians 5
[39:09] is talking
[39:11] about different conditions
[39:15] that what we have read
[39:17] under the fifth seal there
[39:22] they were just souls under the altar
[39:26] they were crying for evans
[39:29] and they were
[39:30] not clothed
[39:33] and then god
[39:35] given them white robes
[39:38] but
[39:42] this is
[39:43] second corinthians 5 verse 4
[39:46] i'm going to read
[39:47] for we that are in the tabernacle to
[39:51] groan
[39:52] being burdened
[39:54] not for that we would be unclothed
[40:00] so he says we
[40:02] are here
[40:04] redeemed people
[40:06] and we wanted to
[40:09] go there
[40:11] want to
[40:12] close that house
[40:16] we are burdened about this
[40:19] amen
[40:24] we are burdened
[40:27] we want to go there
[40:31] and we are earnestly desiring
[40:34] because in this age in this day
[40:38] there is someone
[40:40] who did not come from seminary
[40:44] who did not
[40:46] bring us any theory any doctrine
[40:49] but he himself went beyond the curtain
[40:52] of time
[40:53] and he saw the people there
[40:56] he saw the body he met them hug
[40:59] them and he shook hand with them and he
[41:03] came back
[41:04] with the evidence
[41:07] with the substance
[41:09] amen and told us that there are bodies
[41:12] there are people
[41:14] amen amen
[41:17] so we
[41:20] received a prophet in this age
[41:25] and he
[41:27] experienced the things
[41:30] he
[41:31] entered into that body
[41:35] amen
[41:36] he entered into that body
[41:38] who said i was young again
[41:43] and when he entered into that body
[41:46] he can
[41:47] look back
[41:52] and he can see his another body
[41:55] lying on the bed next to his wife
[41:59] with the clothes
[42:04] he was wearing
[42:05] like when jesus
[42:07] rose from the dead
[42:09] his clothes were there in the tomb there
[42:15] like moses
[42:17] he was
[42:18] clothed with the glory when he came from
[42:21] the presence of god
[42:24] stephen when he died
[42:25] [Music]
[42:26] they saw him like an angel
[42:29] white
[42:31] glorified
[42:32] amen so we see that
[42:36] he said i was young again
[42:39] who looked back over here and said there
[42:42] is my body laying next to my wife
[42:46] and he saw his wife there also
[42:51] he said
[42:52] sharon was there
[42:54] [Music]
[42:55] he met people there
[42:57] he talked with them
[43:00] we know we have read all this
[43:05] young in a body that did not come by
[43:07] natural birth
[43:10] in a body that could not get sick
[43:13] he was in a body that could not get old
[43:18] and he was a witness
[43:23] of that word
[43:25] and
[43:26] he came with their true testimony
[43:29] who crossed over that land and and came
[43:32] with an evidence
[43:34] and a priest who is this milk is that
[43:38] he started to tell us about
[43:41] these things we have another body
[43:44] there are angel
[43:46] amen
[43:48] our angels are beholding the father's
[43:50] face
[43:51] this
[43:53] kind of things
[43:54] amen
[43:55] brothers and sisters
[43:57] in that body we will never grow old
[44:05] no sickness can touch that body
[44:09] now our eyes are getting dim
[44:13] pain and aching and cholesterol and
[44:16] heart attack and different things
[44:20] but we have another body there
[44:23] amen
[44:26] and prabranam
[44:28] came back with the substance and began
[44:31] to teach us
[44:32] and
[44:33] you have one waiting if you are a
[44:37] christian
[44:38] you say you have a body if you are in
[44:41] christ
[44:43] and this mortal
[44:46] a man
[44:49] will we are that immortal
[44:54] paul says
[44:55] first corinthians 15
[44:57] 50 to 54 let me read this then we will
[45:01] go
[45:01] further now this i say brethren
[45:05] that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[45:08] kingdom of god
[45:10] neither do corruption inherit
[45:13] incorruption behold i show you a mystery
[45:17] we shall not all asleep
[45:20] but we shall all be changed in a moment
[45:23] in the twinkling of an eye
[45:26] at the last room for the trumpet shall
[45:29] sound and the dead shall be raised
[45:31] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[45:35] for this corruptible must put on
[45:38] encryption and this mortal must put on
[45:42] immortality
[45:45] must wear that immortality
[45:48] so when this corruptible shall have put
[45:51] on
[45:52] incorruption and this mortal shall have
[45:55] put on
[45:56] immortality then shall be brought that
[46:00] shall be
[46:01] brought to pass the same
[46:03] that is written death is followed up in
[46:06] victory
[46:08] amen because for we that are in this
[46:11] tabernacle to grow on
[46:13] being burdened not for that we would be
[46:15] unclothed but clothed upon
[46:21] he was
[46:23] in the first churches
[46:26] and he saw the future
[46:30] but we
[46:31] are in the seventh in the last churches
[46:36] amen
[46:38] how much more we should be burdened
[46:41] to be clothed upon
[46:44] when seven angels has come
[46:47] when all the mysteries have been
[46:50] revealed
[46:51] when the full word is restored back
[46:56] how much we should be burdened
[46:59] and how ernestly we should desire to go
[47:03] there
[47:04] when we see everything is coming to pass
[47:08] all scripture is uh fulfilling before us
[47:13] modern events are clear by prophecy and
[47:16] now we see
[47:18] all the events and those events are
[47:20] already being told to us in the message
[47:27] how much
[47:29] we should
[47:30] burden to go there
[47:33] and earnestly desiring
[47:38] because the bible says
[47:40] when it happens jesus said luke
[47:43] 17 lift up your eyes
[47:45] because your redemption
[47:49] drought night
[47:52] amen because the message of the seven
[47:55] seal is given to us
[47:57] to give us
[47:59] faith to be chased
[48:02] to go there
[48:04] to get in the rapture
[48:06] to go in that body
[48:09] that mortality might be swallowed up of
[48:12] life
[48:13] poor description must put on encryption
[48:17] and this mortal must put on immortality
[48:20] the holy spirit is released to claim you
[48:23] for glorification
[48:26] to get us back
[48:29] in that perfect place
[48:32] bubranam said when
[48:35] a person a man is born again from heaven
[48:39] he becomes a spirit babe in christ
[48:43] and then when this rover flesh is
[48:46] dropped
[48:48] there is a theophany
[48:50] a body not made with hands neither born
[48:54] of a
[48:55] woman that we go to
[48:59] when we are born again
[49:01] we have a body
[49:02] but if we are not born again
[49:06] if we are not covered
[49:08] by the blood of the lamb
[49:10] then we will be in terrible condition
[49:15] shame
[49:17] nakedness
[49:19] embarrassment
[49:22] so we must make sure
[49:25] that we are under the token
[49:28] we are under the blood and our sins are
[49:31] covered
[49:34] washed away
[49:37] a man
[49:38] with the
[49:39] blood of the lamb
[49:41] lamb's blood
[49:42] amen so
[49:47] let me
[49:48] show you later
[49:51] how man
[49:52] became naked
[49:55] because the bible says
[49:57] there will be shame embarrassment if you
[50:00] will be found naked
[50:04] and
[50:06] when our bible opens in the book of
[50:09] genesis
[50:11] we see that
[50:13] whatever god created it was good
[50:19] and when he created a man he said it's
[50:22] very good
[50:25] everything was
[50:28] running in continuity
[50:32] days
[50:34] nights
[50:35] sun
[50:36] [Music]
[50:38] rising
[50:43] birds
[50:45] singing
[50:47] everything was beautiful
[50:51] god had perfect union with his family
[50:55] every evening he comes like you in the
[50:58] evening comes back from your
[51:00] work or job
[51:02] sit with your family
[51:04] and talk and you have nice fellowship
[51:07] so everything was going on in continuity
[51:14] but one day
[51:18] one anointed preacher came
[51:23] with a false doctrine
[51:27] but he took the same subject because
[51:30] ranam said
[51:31] satan always stay on the same subject
[51:34] that's how he deceived
[51:37] he was an anointed cherubim
[51:42] that united preacher started to preach
[51:48] and
[51:50] we know that eve heard his preaching
[51:54] uh satan's the devil the serpent
[51:58] and then the bible says
[52:02] in one cool evening evening time
[52:06] when god came down
[52:09] he saw his church
[52:11] deceived
[52:13] naked
[52:18] with a false doctrine
[52:22] that's why
[52:24] as the message is given to us
[52:28] we should believe
[52:30] we should not
[52:31] mix or inject our own
[52:35] understanding
[52:37] this message is simple
[52:39] but the people
[52:40] have made it so complicated
[52:45] this message is very simple
[52:47] but branham said this message we will go
[52:50] and find the left
[52:53] this is no any complication there
[52:56] no
[52:57] anything which we cannot understand
[53:00] this message will go and get the people
[53:04] will catch the people
[53:06] because when jesus came
[53:09] in the whole bible new testament nobody
[53:12] came to him he himself went everywhere
[53:17] he
[53:18] went to
[53:19] the shore of glilly
[53:21] he phoned some fishermen he went to uh
[53:25] in the house of matthew all
[53:29] and even he said
[53:31] i have chosen you
[53:33] you did not choose me
[53:35] so the same son of man same jesus christ
[53:39] he never changed his pattern so this
[53:42] message has come
[53:44] to bring us back to the original world
[53:47] and said come back to the bible
[53:51] but
[53:53] we are
[53:54] not we are me not all
[53:57] some people are trying to make this
[54:00] message a doctrine
[54:03] they take little
[54:05] we have to take everything that is given
[54:08] to us
[54:09] so i sometime i wondered and surprised
[54:12] some people say
[54:13] i prefer
[54:15] the books after 63
[54:18] but
[54:19] was born under a sign
[54:22] he was born a prophet
[54:26] he was a prophet from the beginning and
[54:28] the revelation is always progressive
[54:30] revelation
[54:32] it always goes in progression
[54:35] amen so we see that
[54:39] people take the same things and twist
[54:42] them
[54:43] and deceive the people
[54:46] and the first church
[54:48] when god came in the evening time
[54:52] he saw his church
[54:54] in deception
[54:56] deceived
[54:57] by
[54:58] a preacher
[55:00] who preached but he twist the word
[55:04] he dislocate the word
[55:08] he added something
[55:10] little bit one word
[55:12] not big sentence
[55:18] we we must be careful
[55:21] because one word the bible says warn us
[55:25] even one word cannot be add
[55:28] or one word cannot be taken
[55:31] [Music]
[55:35] there was a deceived church
[55:38] that had been deceived
[55:41] deceived by a false united one
[55:46] deceived by the preaching of
[55:50] something
[55:54] and they were
[55:55] that preaching
[55:58] that
[56:00] doctrine robert them
[56:03] rob them
[56:04] and steal something
[56:07] steal
[56:11] that
[56:13] post doctrine which is dangerous all the
[56:16] time
[56:18] robbed them
[56:19] robbed their glory
[56:23] robbed their
[56:25] robe
[56:25] [Music]
[56:29] and they became naked
[56:32] and they found
[56:34] that they are naked
[56:36] and then they try to
[56:38] cover themselves
[56:41] with the pig leaves
[56:43] and try to
[56:46] make their own big leap religion
[56:49] said
[56:50] because listen means covering
[56:53] so now they wanted to cover themselves
[56:57] with their own
[56:59] religion
[57:00] with their own some efforts
[57:06] sweet fellowship was broken
[57:12] that came in
[57:15] with the false teaching
[57:18] with something added into the world
[57:23] and god and his family
[57:26] broken
[57:30] and
[57:31] taught us that
[57:33] he lost
[57:35] the title deal
[57:38] he lost
[57:40] dominion over the earth
[57:43] adam
[57:44] and he lost eternal life
[57:47] he lost fellowship with god
[57:51] the church lost its glory
[57:55] because of some false preacher
[57:59] and church became naked
[58:02] and now the church is trying to cover
[58:04] himself with some man
[58:07] or pig leaves
[58:11] they manufactured a covering
[58:15] to cover their own selves
[58:19] but when when god descended
[58:22] in the cool of the evening
[58:27] a man
[58:30] he ripped
[58:32] he snatched that
[58:35] quickly covering
[58:38] and throw it away
[58:41] showing that man-made
[58:43] theory
[58:45] or reason would not work
[58:48] hallelujah
[58:50] he ripped that big leaf off of them
[58:54] what god did
[58:56] he slew a lamb
[58:58] [Music]
[59:00] amen
[59:02] he threw a lamb
[59:04] and he brought an atonement and he
[59:07] clothed them with lamb's skin
[59:12] he covered their nakedness
[59:15] with lamb's skin lamb was killed to take
[59:19] away their nakedness
[59:26] man made things religion cannot cover
[59:29] our nakedness
[59:31] old nomination all there
[59:34] so god took away their man-made covering
[59:38] and they were provided with a robe
[59:44] lamb was killed
[59:47] babranam stepped under the tree
[59:51] of life
[59:53] god had the lamb slain
[59:56] covered
[59:57] i'm quoting prabranam
[1:00:00] fellowship by redemption message god had
[1:00:03] the lamb slain
[1:00:05] covered adam and eve with the skin
[1:00:09] and shed the blood
[1:00:11] a way
[1:00:13] back to fellowship again with god
[1:00:18] so that fellowship
[1:00:21] that covering
[1:00:23] came
[1:00:24] by the skin of the lamb
[1:00:28] amen
[1:00:33] and god
[1:00:34] covered them with that skin
[1:00:37] the lamb's skin
[1:00:40] and their sins were covered
[1:00:43] because the bible says there is no
[1:00:45] remission of sins without the blood
[1:00:50] that's why we need cross
[1:00:54] all the blessings brother branham said
[1:00:57] all the blessings are in the tournament
[1:01:01] [Music]
[1:01:04] we must have cross
[1:01:08] in our
[1:01:09] life
[1:01:12] it is sad to see
[1:01:15] that many many
[1:01:17] churches
[1:01:19] who claim they believe the message
[1:01:22] they have removed the cross
[1:01:26] from their life
[1:01:30] they think that if they will believe
[1:01:32] this they can get in the rapture if they
[1:01:35] will believe this
[1:01:36] that's how we are divided separated in
[1:01:40] many groups
[1:01:47] but
[1:01:48] gross the atonement is the only
[1:01:52] a man
[1:01:54] think
[1:01:55] because there is no remission of sins
[1:01:57] without the blood
[1:01:59] the bible says for as many of you
[1:02:03] as have been baptized into christ have
[1:02:06] put on christ
[1:02:10] amen
[1:02:11] so when we believe in christ when we
[1:02:14] believe the cross that day on california
[1:02:17] but brahmana prays amen so
[1:02:20] then we
[1:02:22] put on christ when we baptized in the
[1:02:24] name of the jesus christ
[1:02:26] then we are
[1:02:28] in christ
[1:02:30] i was reading this morning
[1:02:32] somebody sent me quote
[1:02:35] says when you go to pray
[1:02:37] before the throne of god
[1:02:39] god
[1:02:40] do not see you
[1:02:43] he sees jesus
[1:02:45] and when you are praying
[1:02:48] you are not praying but jesus is praying
[1:02:51] in you the holy spirit
[1:02:54] amen so
[1:02:56] we
[1:02:57] should be thankful for all this
[1:02:59] provision
[1:03:01] and all the arrangement and program of
[1:03:03] god
[1:03:05] so we see that
[1:03:08] how church became naked
[1:03:11] with some
[1:03:13] thing added
[1:03:14] into the world
[1:03:17] and
[1:03:17] said you never do these three things
[1:03:21] do not add do not
[1:03:23] misinterpret it
[1:03:25] and now come let's come to our age
[1:03:29] in this eighth
[1:03:30] when in the laudician
[1:03:32] god
[1:03:34] sent us a prophet
[1:03:35] in the evening time
[1:03:38] when he came in the evening time he saw
[1:03:41] church
[1:03:42] deceived amen
[1:03:45] with the man made
[1:03:48] big leaves
[1:03:51] curies doctrine durham nationalism
[1:03:55] and he found a church deceived wife by
[1:03:59] the world
[1:04:01] in the evening time
[1:04:08] i have
[1:04:10] a scripture here
[1:04:13] revelation chapter three
[1:04:15] about our age
[1:04:17] laudishan
[1:04:20] which but the people say they are
[1:04:26] came
[1:04:27] and he ripped that thick leaf
[1:04:31] pig leaves that fig leaf
[1:04:34] reason denominational things
[1:04:38] because they are in lukewarm condition
[1:04:42] neither hot or cold
[1:04:46] but they says i am rich
[1:04:48] and increase with goods and have need of
[1:04:51] nothing
[1:04:53] but god says
[1:04:54] knows not that thou art wretched
[1:04:58] and miserable
[1:05:00] and poor
[1:05:01] and blind
[1:05:03] and naked
[1:05:06] now vision is naked and insane
[1:05:13] if somebody knows that he's naked then
[1:05:17] we can help him or somebody can help him
[1:05:22] but the bible says they know it doubt
[1:05:26] that they are naked
[1:05:28] because they are insane
[1:05:31] insanity
[1:05:33] so brother branham
[1:05:35] when he came
[1:05:36] he saw the deceived church
[1:05:41] deceived by the different
[1:05:43] different kinds of interpretation
[1:05:46] different kinds of things added and
[1:05:49] taken from the word of god
[1:05:54] then like eliezer he went out at evening
[1:05:58] time
[1:05:59] to get a bride
[1:06:02] that's what he said i was preaching
[1:06:04] healing great
[1:06:06] successful meetings he said something
[1:06:10] i was missing
[1:06:14] and we know that how god told him
[1:06:17] that all these big healing services
[1:06:20] everything
[1:06:22] and told to him that your ministry is to
[1:06:24] get the bride
[1:06:27] so then the evening time
[1:06:29] he went like eliza to find a bride a
[1:06:33] character
[1:06:35] and we read that
[1:06:38] 24 genesis 53
[1:06:43] and the sermon brought forth jewels of
[1:06:46] silver and jewels of gold and raymond
[1:06:50] and gave them to rebecca
[1:06:53] amen
[1:06:55] so that is the ministry of the seventh
[1:06:57] angel
[1:07:00] eliezer
[1:07:02] he was like elijah
[1:07:05] he was like eliza
[1:07:08] he was like john the baptist
[1:07:10] and he said you cannot beat your type
[1:07:16] it is in the bible
[1:07:21] so his ministry
[1:07:25] was to provided us a robe
[1:07:30] because we were naked
[1:07:34] this age is naked
[1:07:37] and we know that we are not in laodicean
[1:07:40] condition praise the lord
[1:07:42] so this message has brought us out of
[1:07:45] that condition
[1:07:47] we are not wretched we are not miserable
[1:07:49] we are not naked we are covered
[1:07:53] with the word of the hour
[1:07:58] because his ministry was to restore the
[1:08:00] world
[1:08:02] bring us back to the world that word and
[1:08:05] us
[1:08:06] become one
[1:08:07] that's what he did he started his
[1:08:10] ministry
[1:08:11] and and
[1:08:12] he was providing a robe
[1:08:16] covering us
[1:08:18] let me read in his own word
[1:08:22] he restored the lamb he also the word of
[1:08:25] god
[1:08:27] and he says the message is present stage
[1:08:30] of my ministry
[1:08:32] i hope
[1:08:34] he will crown my ministry of this of
[1:08:38] letting me take the clothes of the world
[1:08:42] and dress his bride in the clothes of
[1:08:44] the world
[1:08:46] and for his righteousness
[1:08:50] amen
[1:08:51] so what is
[1:08:53] harm's ministry
[1:08:56] he is talking about his ministry
[1:08:59] and the message title is present stage
[1:09:01] of my ministry
[1:09:04] and it says
[1:09:06] this is my ministry
[1:09:09] that
[1:09:11] god
[1:09:13] let me
[1:09:14] take the clothes of the world and dress
[1:09:18] his bride
[1:09:19] in the clothes of the world
[1:09:25] and even he said
[1:09:26] it is god's requirement of the hour the
[1:09:30] evening time message is to apply the
[1:09:32] token
[1:09:34] token is the holy spirit
[1:09:40] and the holy spirit was born
[1:09:45] with the dogmas and creed and opinions
[1:09:49] but when true word came
[1:09:52] a restore back
[1:09:55] our understanding is clear
[1:09:58] and we are not under any man's hardship
[1:10:01] because our handshake is jesus christ
[1:10:04] the seventh seal
[1:10:06] amen
[1:10:08] and
[1:10:14] we do not follow man
[1:10:16] when the world is restored
[1:10:19] to us
[1:10:21] that we may
[1:10:22] become one with the word
[1:10:25] so that's god's
[1:10:27] requirement
[1:10:29] and that is the ministry of
[1:10:32] brother bran
[1:10:38] because i have i'm going to read couple
[1:10:42] of quotes
[1:10:44] i hope you will enjoy them
[1:10:49] holy spirit was born
[1:10:53] loosed by the message
[1:10:55] the revelation
[1:10:56] opening of the world
[1:10:59] that he
[1:11:00] may take hardship and preeminence in us
[1:11:03] that we may not work
[1:11:06] in man's opinion
[1:11:09] but
[1:11:11] must led by the holy spirit
[1:11:17] but ibrahim said
[1:11:19] eliza and elisha message so the baptism
[1:11:22] of the holy spirit
[1:11:24] was upon christ
[1:11:26] when he was taken up on the day of
[1:11:28] pentecost
[1:11:30] 120 people went
[1:11:33] in the upper room
[1:11:34] up there with their eyes straight
[1:11:37] towards the heaven
[1:11:38] watching and when he threw that robe of
[1:11:42] the holy ghost
[1:11:44] back down
[1:11:46] there
[1:11:47] she picked up a double portion out of
[1:11:50] the spirit of god
[1:11:52] so when we are talking about the rope
[1:11:55] when we say that
[1:11:57] dominationalism and all
[1:12:00] those false teaching doctrines
[1:12:02] made the church
[1:12:04] naked
[1:12:05] and then a ministry came to provide the
[1:12:08] rope amen
[1:12:10] and that robe he said is the holy ghost
[1:12:16] amen
[1:12:17] he said
[1:12:19] that is the requirement the holy spirit
[1:12:23] because when we receive the holy spirit
[1:12:27] that is god
[1:12:28] jesus christ in us
[1:12:31] doing his own work
[1:12:34] with his own way
[1:12:36] law
[1:12:37] law or grace
[1:12:39] but to make every man look the same
[1:12:42] he has to have the same kind of robe on
[1:12:46] the poor does
[1:12:48] that the rich hand
[1:12:49] now
[1:12:50] when god gives a poor man
[1:12:53] the holy ghost it is the same holy ghost
[1:12:56] he gives the rich man
[1:12:59] so babranam says the holy ghost is the
[1:13:01] robe
[1:13:03] for the poor
[1:13:04] and for the rich
[1:13:06] both looks the same
[1:13:08] you would not have to tell
[1:13:12] you what that means the holy ghost of
[1:13:15] course to cover with his own robe
[1:13:19] the waters of separation another
[1:13:23] now god made a robe also to cover
[1:13:27] that is the blood of jesus christ by the
[1:13:29] holy ghost the rube
[1:13:33] gods provided way
[1:13:35] she laid at boa's feet ruth
[1:13:40] and when
[1:13:41] he woke and seen the confidence
[1:13:44] my one of these days
[1:13:47] he will see the confidence that his
[1:13:49] church has got in him
[1:13:51] when he seen the confidence he taken his
[1:13:54] own rope holy spirit spread it over her
[1:13:58] it was getting cool
[1:14:00] and he spread his robe over her and sent
[1:14:04] her on her road and so did the people on
[1:14:08] the day of pentacles
[1:14:10] the new church
[1:14:11] when they went out there
[1:14:14] was not ashamed
[1:14:16] and stood under there waiting for 10
[1:14:19] days according to his word
[1:14:21] christ spread his robe the holy ghost
[1:14:25] over the church to protect her and warm
[1:14:28] her to keep your heart right warmed up
[1:14:32] in fellowship until the full time of
[1:14:35] redemption
[1:14:36] amen
[1:14:39] so this message
[1:14:43] the holy ghost
[1:14:46] the word
[1:14:48] restored back
[1:14:50] is the road for this day
[1:14:54] and we are waiting for the rapture
[1:14:57] and what is the rapture
[1:14:59] to get in another body
[1:15:02] the horse up there
[1:15:05] and we cannot go there
[1:15:09] without the rope
[1:15:12] because the prophet says it is the
[1:15:14] requirement of the hour
[1:15:17] this is
[1:15:19] a requirement to go
[1:15:22] in the wedding supper
[1:15:26] we must have that robe
[1:15:30] we must need that white rayman
[1:15:33] to go in the wedding supper
[1:15:37] because the bible says revelation 19 7 8
[1:15:40] let us be glad and rejoice
[1:15:43] and give honor to him for the marriage
[1:15:46] of the lamb is come and his wife had
[1:15:49] made herself ready
[1:15:52] and to her was granted that she should
[1:15:54] be
[1:15:55] read in fine linen
[1:15:58] clean and white
[1:16:00] for the final
[1:16:01] linen is the righteousness of sins and
[1:16:04] that righteousness
[1:16:06] is
[1:16:08] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:16:11] we are in christ and christ in us
[1:16:18] god's provided way brother
[1:16:21] you are going to find yourself the same
[1:16:23] way
[1:16:24] every man that comes by the door
[1:16:27] is going to get the same rope and that
[1:16:30] rope is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:16:33] every man
[1:16:35] pays the same price
[1:16:37] amen
[1:16:40] jesus is the door
[1:16:43] and when we go
[1:16:44] entered
[1:16:47] entered
[1:16:49] by that door
[1:16:51] he is there to provide the robe
[1:16:55] and without that robe
[1:16:57] nobody can go there
[1:17:01] because we read in the bible in the book
[1:17:03] of matthew 22
[1:17:06] there was a man
[1:17:09] and he was there
[1:17:12] in the wedding
[1:17:14] somehow he came but branham said maybe
[1:17:17] through window or
[1:17:20] something
[1:17:23] and
[1:17:27] the question was asked to him
[1:17:31] friend how came
[1:17:34] thou in either
[1:17:36] not having it wedding garment
[1:17:40] and the bible says he was speechless
[1:17:44] no answer
[1:17:46] nothing to say
[1:17:49] if we go with other robot it is terrible
[1:17:52] it is shame
[1:17:57] and we thank the lord
[1:17:59] for the ministry
[1:18:03] that ministry brought up or
[1:18:06] brought us out of nakedness
[1:18:10] laudishan is
[1:18:12] and brought us in the brightest
[1:18:15] and bride have been provided
[1:18:18] with the river
[1:18:19] that is the ministry of eliasm
[1:18:23] that is the ministry of the seventh
[1:18:25] angel
[1:18:26] to provide us the word
[1:18:30] robe
[1:18:31] the holy ghost
[1:18:34] amen
[1:18:38] because without
[1:18:40] that robe
[1:18:41] nobody can get in there
[1:18:45] and we point that if we will go without
[1:18:47] the house
[1:18:49] and we will
[1:18:51] stand there hang
[1:18:52] between hell and earth
[1:18:56] tormented
[1:18:58] in tormentation
[1:19:01] nightmare
[1:19:02] it's terrible
[1:19:06] we must make sure
[1:19:08] while we are here
[1:19:10] we have
[1:19:11] given
[1:19:12] an opportunity
[1:19:15] we can receive the holy ghost
[1:19:17] we can get that robe
[1:19:20] because jesus said
[1:19:24] even you are evil
[1:19:29] and provide good things to your children
[1:19:32] when they ask
[1:19:34] if you ask for bread you don't give him
[1:19:36] stone
[1:19:38] he said if you will ask
[1:19:41] your heavenly father
[1:19:43] for the holy ghost
[1:19:45] he will give you
[1:19:52] so let's make sure
[1:19:57] that we have received the true baptism
[1:19:59] of the holy spirit
[1:20:04] let us make sure
[1:20:06] that we have
[1:20:10] robed by that robe
[1:20:12] covered
[1:20:13] by that robe of righteousness that jesus
[1:20:16] christ
[1:20:19] because
[1:20:22] this is the requirement
[1:20:28] and god says to this
[1:20:31] is our age
[1:20:34] laudish
[1:20:36] i consult the
[1:20:38] revelation 3 18
[1:20:40] to buy of me gold
[1:20:43] tried in the
[1:20:44] fire that thou mayest be rich
[1:20:49] and white raiment
[1:20:51] that thou mayest be clothed
[1:20:55] and that the shame of thy nakedness
[1:20:58] do not appear
[1:21:00] and unite thine eyes with i said that
[1:21:03] thou mayest see
[1:21:06] so that's god's counsel to the
[1:21:12] age we can come
[1:21:16] and receive the baptism of the holy
[1:21:19] spirit
[1:21:20] that is the ministry of prabhupada
[1:21:23] he said his
[1:21:24] greatest or the highlighted message it's
[1:21:27] the token
[1:21:30] and he preached this message many times
[1:21:32] not one time
[1:21:36] because the holy spirit in him inspired
[1:21:39] him
[1:21:42] to preach this again and again
[1:21:47] and he said without the token
[1:21:50] you are perish
[1:21:53] he said
[1:21:54] get the holy spirit or perish repent or
[1:21:58] perish
[1:22:01] so brother and sisters
[1:22:03] we have to make sure
[1:22:06] while the time is given to us
[1:22:11] while the holy ghost is available for us
[1:22:14] all
[1:22:15] and god gave
[1:22:17] the council to this eighth
[1:22:21] that
[1:22:22] come and
[1:22:25] take the white raymond
[1:22:28] that
[1:22:30] your nakedness do not appear
[1:22:34] if he will come he is waiting
[1:22:36] his father loving father
[1:22:40] you remember the prodigal son
[1:22:44] when he came he repented
[1:22:48] the roof was provided to him
[1:22:51] by the father
[1:22:52] father was waiting
[1:22:57] if anyone here
[1:23:00] and i know and i believe all are
[1:23:05] repented and have
[1:23:08] accepted the lord jesus christ
[1:23:11] but without jesus without that robe
[1:23:15] without the covering of our sin
[1:23:18] or washed by the blood if we go there
[1:23:24] we will be in tormentation
[1:23:27] let's make sure
[1:23:29] like prodigal son we can come
[1:23:32] and say lord
[1:23:36] i have sinned
[1:23:39] and the roof was provided to him
[1:23:44] and jesus christ is the door
[1:23:46] and he is there
[1:23:50] because he has given the invitation
[1:23:54] when you come to him through the door
[1:23:57] he is standing there to provide the rope
[1:24:04] amen
[1:24:06] so i am closing
[1:24:08] with this quote
[1:24:09] by brahms quote
[1:24:12] from the message
[1:24:14] redemption by judgment
[1:24:18] not just a gold crown to set on your
[1:24:20] head
[1:24:22] but something far beyond that
[1:24:27] paul got a glimpse of it
[1:24:29] one time
[1:24:30] he said
[1:24:31] i hath not seen
[1:24:34] ear has not heard
[1:24:36] neither has it
[1:24:39] entered
[1:24:40] the hearts of men
[1:24:42] what god has for them in store that love
[1:24:45] him
[1:24:47] not a crone
[1:24:49] a gold crown
[1:24:51] that would not mean much to me
[1:24:55] i don't care about them things anyhow
[1:24:58] but micron
[1:25:00] is a new body
[1:25:02] a new being
[1:25:04] crowned in his likeness
[1:25:07] a body like his own glorious body
[1:25:11] where i can just live with him
[1:25:13] that's the crown enough for me
[1:25:17] amen that's what brahnam said so that's
[1:25:20] what he came for that's why god has sent
[1:25:23] us
[1:25:24] because
[1:25:27] this deceived church
[1:25:29] may come out of that condition and
[1:25:33] we are the witness
[1:25:37] that we have come out of that chaos that
[1:25:40] darkness
[1:25:42] in
[1:25:43] that condition
[1:25:44] we were there sometime
[1:25:46] when we were in the denominational
[1:25:49] world
[1:25:51] but now we have received a message
[1:25:54] the message which came from heaven
[1:25:57] eternity
[1:26:00] to take us back to eternity
[1:26:04] to provide us the robe elijah's ministry
[1:26:08] we are the rebecca we are the root
[1:26:11] he said boaz provided hope to her
[1:26:15] elijah provided rope to her amen
[1:26:23] may the lord help us
[1:26:27] he was elijah
[1:26:30] amen and we are elisha
[1:26:33] he preached a message second-handed robe
[1:26:38] and in that message he said we do not
[1:26:40] need any new doctrine new teaching
[1:26:44] said what we need is our 19th french
[1:26:47] uniting of the holy spirit
[1:26:51] that is the requirement that is the
[1:26:53] token
[1:26:54] and token must be on this on display in
[1:26:57] the evening time
[1:27:01] may the lord bless you let's pray

[1:32:03] in the full garment that's been given to
[1:32:05] us
[1:32:07] men if we're
[1:32:08] seeking god
[1:32:10] to cover us for the baptism of the holy
[1:32:12] ghost through that word to be clothed in
[1:32:14] that word that's been given to us on
[1:32:16] this day
[1:32:18] we cannot seek the holy ghost and resist
[1:32:20] the holy ghost at the same time
[1:32:22] [Music]
[1:32:23] you know the prophet of god the garment
[1:32:26] has been restored and he's here clothing
[1:32:28] a bride
[1:32:29] and the garment of the word amen and to
[1:32:32] receive that holy ghost the life of that
[1:32:34] word to come upon us christ we cannot be
[1:32:37] asking to receive that and be resisting
[1:32:40] the very thing we're asking to receive
[1:32:44] because it's the life of the word coming
[1:32:46] to manifest the word through us
[1:32:48] and so we have to do is we surrender
[1:32:51] completely to this word and say lord
[1:32:54] this message is christ
[1:32:57] it's not a man's idea it's not a
[1:33:01] compilation of doctrines for teaching
[1:33:03] but this message is jesus christ the
[1:33:06] word has been restored is the headship
[1:33:08] restored to the church i cannot resist
[1:33:10] that and ask for the life of christ to
[1:33:12] come and cover me but i have to say lord
[1:33:15] it's right it's every bit right and i
[1:33:17] surrender all my life to that lord i
[1:33:20] take the headship of your word now come
[1:33:22] lord and be my clothing
[1:33:25] be my garment be my purification be my
[1:33:28] righteousness clothe me lord
[1:33:31] in that word
[1:33:33] if you're seeking the baptism of the
[1:33:34] holy ghost surrender completely to the
[1:33:37] word that has been restored
[1:33:40] don't ask to change the garment
[1:33:43] say i want the garment but could you cut
[1:33:45] the sleeves a little different and could
[1:33:47] you
[1:33:50] we've been given a perfect garment
[1:33:53] it doesn't need altered to our opinion
[1:33:55] it doesn't need change to our own
[1:33:57] fleshly desires what we need to do is
[1:33:59] die out to everything that's contrary to
[1:34:01] the garment and say god if there's part
[1:34:04] of me that doesn't fit in that cut that
[1:34:06] part off of me because i want to fit
[1:34:08] into that garment
[1:34:10] it's got to be your life the life of the
[1:34:12] word the life of the lamb amen the blood
[1:34:15] that was shed to come upon me
[1:34:19] that now your life is in me and on me
[1:34:23] and i'm displaying your righteousness to
[1:34:25] the world
[1:34:27] if we want the holy ghost if we want a
[1:34:28] greater measure of the holy ghost we
[1:34:30] want more of god in our lives then we
[1:34:32] have to surrender to what god has given
[1:34:34] us
[1:34:36] and like our brother said if he's if
[1:34:38] we've surrendered
[1:34:40] how can we ask earthly fathers good
[1:34:43] things and they'll not give us evil if
[1:34:45] so much that that is so true how much
[1:34:48] more so if we under a full and complete
[1:34:50] surrender and death to self ask our
[1:34:52] heavenly father
[1:34:54] will he not fill us with the holy ghost
[1:34:58] let's not make it complicated
[1:35:00] let's just die out
[1:35:02] let's not make it hard let's just
[1:35:04] surrender
[1:35:06] completely to him
[1:35:08] amen god bless you let's bow our heads
[1:35:10] and pray in a prayer thanksgiving
