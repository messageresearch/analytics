[0:00] so as God is is bringing back the word
[0:04] he's getting it more and more and more
[0:06] lined up to the
[0:08] original right and so that tone that
[0:12] came from Luther would attract a certain
[0:16] seed the Lutheran seed the tone as God
[0:20] would move down through time and the
[0:22] tone would come through
[0:26] Wesley it was there to there was a
[0:29] certain seed for that age to respond to
[0:31] that
[0:33] tone but if we still tried to play the
[0:37] piece reading from Wesley Sheep
[0:42] music
[0:44] nothing
[0:47] nothing
[0:50] nothing this here is waiting for
[0:56] something it's waiting to be moved it's
[0:58] waiting to be put into action it's got
[1:01] It's it's got a natural frequency that's
[1:03] laying here undiscovered and
[1:05] unrealized but yet it's there it's
[1:07] inherent to the object it's part of it
[1:10] it's built into it it's there already
[1:13] amen we don't have to put it in there
[1:14] it's already
[1:16] there so all we have to do is find the
[1:20] word for the age so that the seed and
[1:22] the word match together cuz brother B
[1:25] said in God's only provided place of
[1:26] worship he said if I taught you
[1:28] Methodist message it would take no
[1:29] effect on
[1:33] [Music]
[1:35] you it would have no effect on
[1:39] you uh this is bride time yes if Moses
[1:43] taught the message of Noah it would take
[1:45] no effect if Jesus T moses' message it
[1:47] would take no effect because the
[1:48] predestinated seed are lay are are
[1:51] laying there that will only be watered
[1:53] by that type of water that's give for
[1:55] that seed it won't grow any other
[1:58] condition it must be the condition that
[2:00] grows in so this thing is sitting here
[2:04] waiting One Church another church
[2:08] another
[2:09] church but one
[2:14] day that's it that's what I've been
[2:17] waiting didn't know it amen listen th
[2:20] this if this has never been struck
[2:22] before if it's never been plucked before
[2:24] this object doesn't even know how it
[2:27] resonates it's never been put in action
[2:29] it's never been struck it's never it's
[2:32] never been played I mean it's been cast
[2:34] it's been sent to the Earth but
[2:35] nothing's happened yet Amen to cause a
[2:38] sound to come out of it it doesn't know
[2:39] if it's an a it doesn't know if it's a b
[2:41] it doesn't know if it's a c doesn't know
[2:43] if it's a d it doesn't know if it's a g
[2:45] it doesn't know what it is and it's
[2:47] sitting here and it comes in contact
[2:48] with all these other things nothing
[2:50] moves but but one day it comes in
[2:52] contact with an eagle
[2:55] scream and then all of a
[2:58] sudden he says
[3:00] I'm an a I'm an a I know what I am I
[3:04] thought I was a Methodist I thought I
[3:06] was a Baptist I thought I was a
[3:07] Pentecostal I thought I was a Catholic
[3:08] but I realized I'm bride amen I'm part
[3:11] of the Bride because there was something
[3:13] that could awaken what I was inherent
[3:17] already built into me I had to come in
[3:19] contact with something that was the same
[3:22] as me so that I could resonate back what
[3:25] I heard and what I heard was matched to
[3:28] what I am and what I resonate back was a
[3:30] match to what I heard
