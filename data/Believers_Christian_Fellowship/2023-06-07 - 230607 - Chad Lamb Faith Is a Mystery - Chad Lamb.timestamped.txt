[14:07] amen
[14:09] let's bow our heads together this
[14:10] evening
[14:12] oh Heavenly Father how we desire
[14:15] for you to take control of us Lord
[14:18] God we've had enough life experience to
[14:21] know that we can't do it on our own
[14:24] God we can't in our own strength in our
[14:27] own selves
[14:29] bring glory to you we can in our own
[14:31] strength do anything
[14:33] but God you and us with you and us
[14:37] with you all things are possible
[14:40] would you take control of us this
[14:42] evening Lord would you both speak the
[14:44] word through this flesh and hear Lord
[14:46] through our ears and give us a heart to
[14:48] perceive all that you have for us may
[14:51] you make this word Lord come alive in us
[14:53] and may you bring it to a manifestation
[14:55] in us as we yield to you and surrender
[14:58] for all we believe this is the hour that
[15:00] we have the the right revelation of the
[15:03] hour we live in and what you're trying
[15:05] to accomplish Lord and we want to yield
[15:07] ourselves to that accomplishment that
[15:10] the word may be made manifest in each of
[15:12] us Lord I pray that you take control of
[15:15] this vessel and that you would bring
[15:16] your Eternal Word through these lips of
[15:18] clay
[15:19] Lord give us Grace to hear to understand
[15:22] the faith to believe all that you would
[15:25] speak to us tonight we love you we pray
[15:28] you take preeminence among us as we
[15:30] surrender to you now and Jesus Christ's
[15:32] name we pray
[15:36] amen God bless you while we're standing
[15:38] let's turn to Hebrews chapter 11.
[15:41] I want to say I appreciated the special
[15:43] and thank you brother John and sister
[15:44] Jill for sharing that with us
[15:46] amen also I'd like to take a moment to
[15:50] wish my wife a happy anniversary today
[15:53] is our 26th anniversary so June 7th is
[15:56] our anniversary day and we thank God for
[15:58] the grace that he's given to us amen
[16:02] also I want to remind you that I'll be
[16:03] leaving tomorrow I'll be gone this week
[16:05] and I'll be preaching up for the Eugene
[16:07] Bronze in Edmonton and also the brother
[16:09] Nathaniel sius will be here preaching
[16:11] the services Sunday so be praying if you
[16:13] pray for me for traveling mercies I'd
[16:15] appreciate that and for inspiration to
[16:17] preach I appreciate that as well and
[16:19] also be remembering brother Nathanael
[16:21] that God would use him here mightily
[16:24] and let's look at Hebrews chapter 11
[16:26] together
[16:28] verse 1.
[16:30] now Faith is the substance of things
[16:32] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[16:34] Seen
[16:35] for by it the elders obtained a good
[16:38] report let's jump over to verse six but
[16:41] without faith it is impossible to please
[16:43] him for he that cometh the God must
[16:45] believe that he is and that he is a
[16:48] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[16:50] Him may God bless you as you take your
[16:53] seats
[16:54] so these scriptures are familiar to us
[16:56] we know that without faith it is
[16:57] impossible to please God so in order to
[17:00] please God we must have faith but we
[17:03] will also find in our next scripture
[17:05] reading that that faith is not something
[17:07] we just get something we just go and
[17:09] obtain amen so and the ability to please
[17:12] God comes from Faith but faith is a gift
[17:14] from God
[17:15] let's look at this in Ephesians chapter
[17:17] 2.
[17:19] As We Lay Down this Foundation Ephesians
[17:21] chapter 2
[17:22] verse 8 and we'll read this together
[17:25] Ephesians 2 and 8 says for by grace are
[17:28] you saved through faith and that not of
[17:30] yourselves it is the gift of God not of
[17:32] Works lest any man should boast so when
[17:36] we put these two scriptures together we
[17:37] realize that there's no way for me to
[17:40] ever be able to please God without faith
[17:43] and there is no way for me to have faith
[17:45] unless God gives me the gift of faith
[17:48] so I am utterly dependent on God for
[17:50] everything there's nothing that I can do
[17:52] in and of myself and so this evening I'd
[17:54] like to preach on a subject faith is a
[17:56] mystery
[17:58] my faith is a mystery and I pray that
[18:00] God will help me just share this the way
[18:02] that it's in my heart amen and God will
[18:04] unveil it to us in the pergamian church
[18:07] age out of the church age book brother
[18:09] Branham says this and this pergamian age
[18:12] where men where men were humanizing
[18:15] salvation having turned from the truth
[18:17] that salvation is of the Lord having
[18:20] cast aside the doctrine of election and
[18:22] open wide the church door in their
[18:23] Fellowship to any and all who subscribe
[18:26] to their tenants never mind the word in
[18:29] this age of Rapid degradation there were
[18:32] still the few who had the measure of the
[18:34] Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ and not
[18:36] only use that faith in Acts of power but
[18:38] withstood those who dared to say that
[18:40] they were saved simply on the grounds of
[18:42] joining a church
[18:44] So it's talking about the humanization
[18:47] of the faith that you have to come and
[18:50] agree with what we say and attend to to
[18:52] where we attend and then you can be
[18:54] saved amen but there were those who
[18:56] would resist that because they had the
[18:57] faith of Jesus Christ
[19:00] because that's what it took he goes on
[19:02] to say they knew that no man could truly
[19:04] believe unto eternal life and the
[19:07] righteousness of God apart from the
[19:09] measure of the faith of the Lord Jesus
[19:11] himself
[19:12] not your faith the faith of Jesus Christ
[19:16] as today's church is filled with mental
[19:18] believers who endorsed the Virgin birth
[19:20] to shed blood going to church taking
[19:23] communion and are not reborn at all even
[19:27] so in the third age was the same problem
[19:29] human Faith wasn't enough then and it is
[19:32] not enough now it takes the very faith
[19:35] of the Son of God to drop into a man's
[19:37] heart so that he can receive the Lord Of
[19:39] Glory into the temple not made with
[19:41] hands
[19:43] amen so the mental ascribing to a set of
[19:46] beliefs a Doctrine a set of doctrines
[19:48] Amen in attendance Amen to a church is
[19:51] not enough for salvation Salvation is of
[19:54] the Lord
[19:55] it's going to take a supernatural
[19:57] injection of the faith of the Son of God
[19:59] Amen and and that's what it's going to
[20:02] take to drop into a man's heart so that
[20:05] he can receive the Lord Of Glory into
[20:06] the temple not made with hands it's
[20:09] going to take God salvation is of the
[20:11] Lord
[20:12] praise God
[20:14] let's go to Romans chapter 4 together
[20:22] so we find
[20:24] and we're going to find as we talk about
[20:25] this
[20:27] faith is more than just a mental
[20:30] acknowledgment of the truth of
[20:32] scriptures
[20:36] you say I have faith I believe but true
[20:40] faith will believe all the word of God
[20:43] so partial partial belief and partial
[20:46] faith in the word of God that's not the
[20:48] faith that we're looking of that's not
[20:49] the faith of the son of God
[20:51] it's an intellectual faith so in Romans
[20:55] chapter 4 he starts to tell us
[20:58] let's go let's look at verse nine I'm
[21:00] going to look at a couple verses here
[21:02] he says cometh this blessedness upon the
[21:05] circumcision only or upon the
[21:06] uncircumcision also for we say that
[21:09] Faith was reckoned to Abraham for
[21:10] righteousness how was it then reckoned
[21:12] when he was in circumcision or an
[21:14] uncircumcision not in circumcision but
[21:17] uncircumcision and he received a sign of
[21:19] circumcision a seal of the righteousness
[21:21] of the faith which he had yet being
[21:23] uncircumcised that he might be the
[21:25] father of all them that believe though
[21:27] they be not circumcised that
[21:29] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[21:31] also so now he's talking about Abraham
[21:33] received the imputation of righteousness
[21:35] because he believed
[21:36] the question is what did Abraham believe
[21:39] Abraham it wasn't that Abraham believed
[21:42] that God created the heavens and earth
[21:43] amen many believe that in that day but
[21:46] Abraham was believing what God told him
[21:48] in that day he was believing the present
[21:51] tense truth and is imputed unto him for
[21:53] righteousness amen
[21:56] so he believed the word for his day
[21:58] and so he became the father of
[22:00] circumcision to them who are not of the
[22:01] circumcision only but who also walk in
[22:04] the steps of that Faith of Our Father
[22:06] Abraham which he had being yet
[22:08] uncircumcised
[22:10] for the promise that he should be heir
[22:12] of the world was not to Abraham or to
[22:14] his seed through the law but through the
[22:16] righteousness of Faith so this promise
[22:18] that he will inherit amen was not just
[22:21] to Abraham and to his seed by the law
[22:24] but through the Rises of faith for if
[22:27] they which are of the law be heirs faith
[22:28] is made void and the promise made of
[22:30] none effect because the law workers
[22:32] wrath for when the law is there is no
[22:34] transgression therefore it is a faith
[22:36] that it might be by grace to the end the
[22:40] promise might be sure to all the seed
[22:42] not to that only which is of the law but
[22:44] to that also which is of the faith of
[22:46] Abraham who is the father of us all
[22:49] so God Made It by faith how do you
[22:51] acquire this by faith how do you enter
[22:53] in by faith how are you part of the
[22:55] Promise by faith he made it by faith so
[22:58] that it could be by grace
[23:01] so that God by his grace amen and we are
[23:04] saved by grace through faith and not not
[23:06] of ourselves it is the gift of God so it
[23:08] is the faith where we apprehend this
[23:10] Grace which is God's love and favor amen
[23:12] but God to be a righteous God he didn't
[23:15] just come down and he says now you're
[23:17] going to be the one and you're not it
[23:19] you're the one and you're not it no but
[23:21] God comes and puts everybody on the same
[23:23] basis if you can believe me you can be
[23:26] saved
[23:29] but by Grace he has given some amen an
[23:33] ability to believe by a seed of faith
[23:35] [Music]
[23:36] and they are the Seed of Abraham the
[23:39] Royal seed
[23:40] by what by predestination so all
[23:43] Humanity has the same opportunity to
[23:45] believe the word of God Amen and there
[23:47] is a reward even for those who will
[23:49] respect the word of God without ever
[23:52] fighting against it amen but the Seed of
[23:55] Abraham will believe the I am present
[23:58] tense of God and all that he says
[24:01] so now that he made amen he made it by
[24:04] faith so that it could be by Grace so
[24:07] that he could remain a just gone
[24:12] chapter 5 verse 1 says therefore
[24:13] therefore being justified by faith we
[24:16] have peace with God through our Lord
[24:18] Jesus Christ by whom also we have access
[24:20] by faith unto this Grace wherein we
[24:23] stand and rejoice in the hope of the
[24:25] glory of God
[24:27] so it's apprehended by faith
[24:30] and that is not human faith that's not
[24:34] even our faith that's the faith of God
[24:37] the faith of the son of God
[24:41] and the message why are people so tossed
[24:44] about brother says now our faith cannot
[24:46] rest upon nothing
[24:48] a Christian has to have his faith has to
[24:50] have a solid resting place
[24:53] you know that and the only resting place
[24:55] that a Christian a true born-again
[24:56] Christian can rest is Faith or hers is
[24:58] upon the unmovable word of God
[25:01] it isn't built upon the shifting Sands
[25:03] of man's Theology and doctrines and upon
[25:05] some church affiliations but a True
[25:07] Believer his face said solidly
[25:09] unshifting as he approaches the word of
[25:12] God
[25:13] so faith is not just something that we
[25:16] just believe in any old thing amen and I
[25:18] have faith in the faith of God but our
[25:20] faith a Christian faith must have a
[25:22] resting place in that resting place is
[25:23] on the unmovable word of God
[25:28] and and that leads into this next part
[25:30] that I want to share
[25:33] uh let's go to Romans chapter 10
[25:35] together let's turn over to Romans
[25:36] chapter 10.
[25:38] and read this this is a very interesting
[25:40] part of scripture it just started to uh
[25:43] unlock a little bit in a different way
[25:44] to me today even as I was looking at it
[25:49] Romans chapter 10 verse 16.
[25:54] but they have not all obeyed the gospel
[25:56] for Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed
[25:59] our report so then Faith cometh by
[26:01] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[26:03] so now we know this this to be true
[26:06] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[26:08] the word of God a Christian's Faith must
[26:10] be placed on a firm foundation and that
[26:12] Firm Foundation is the unmovable word of
[26:14] God
[26:16] so Isaiah said who has believed our
[26:18] report so he's going back to Isaiah and
[26:21] saying who has believed our report and
[26:22] to whom is the arm of the Lord uh
[26:24] extended or to who does it shown to and
[26:28] and now he bases it who has believed our
[26:30] report and he says faith cometh by
[26:32] hearing what hearing what the report of
[26:34] the prophet
[26:37] but look at what he does next look at
[26:39] what Paul does next in the scripture
[26:42] Verse 18 but I say have they not heard
[26:47] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[26:48] the word but haven't they heard
[26:51] wasn't it preached
[26:53] have they not heard yes verily their
[26:56] sound went into all the Earth and their
[26:57] words into the into the world
[26:59] but I say did not Israel know didn't
[27:02] they know first Moses saith I will
[27:04] provoke you to jealousy by them that are
[27:06] no people and by a foolish Nation I will
[27:08] anger you but Isaias is very bold and
[27:11] saith I was found of them that sought me
[27:14] not I Was Made manifest unto them that
[27:16] ask not after me
[27:19] so now he's saying Faith come Isaiah
[27:22] says who hath believed our report so now
[27:25] he takes down and says see Faith cometh
[27:26] by hearing the report of the prophet
[27:29] but he said did they not hear they heard
[27:31] it why didn't they believe amen is not
[27:34] hearing it with these ears amen there
[27:36] has to be another set of ears that are
[27:39] unlocked by God himself to hear the word
[27:41] not sitting in your seat hearing the
[27:44] preaching no matter how right it is it's
[27:46] not these ears
[27:50] didn't the Jews hear didn't they hear
[27:52] the prophecy didn't they hear the
[27:53] preaching didn't they hear Jesus preach
[27:56] didn't they hear what he said amen why
[27:58] didn't they believe amen because it
[28:00] takes something from God
[28:03] let's go to Matthew chapter 13.
[28:18] Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 13.
[28:25] Jesus says therefore speak I to them in
[28:28] Parables because they sing see not and
[28:31] hearing they hear not neither do they
[28:33] understand
[28:35] so Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[28:37] by the word of God was Jesus not
[28:39] preaching the word
[28:44] Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word
[28:46] of God if you have ears to hear
[28:52] he says therefore speak I to them in
[28:54] Parables because they see and see not
[28:55] and hearing they hear not neither do
[28:57] they understand and in them is fulfilled
[29:00] the prophecy of isaiahs which saith by
[29:02] hearing ye shall hear and shall not
[29:04] understand and seeing ye shall see and
[29:06] shall not perceive for this people's
[29:08] heart is wax gross and their ears are
[29:10] thrilled of hearing and their eyes they
[29:12] have closed lest at any time they should
[29:13] see with their eyes and hear with their
[29:15] ears and should understand with their
[29:17] heart and should be converted and I
[29:19] should heal them
[29:20] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[29:23] in your ears for they hear for verily I
[29:27] say unto you that many prophets and
[29:28] righteous men have desired to see those
[29:30] things which you see and have not seen
[29:32] them and to hear those things which you
[29:34] hear and have not heard them
[29:37] they sing see not and hearing hear not
[29:40] but blessed are your ears are they here
[29:42] in your eyes for they see
[29:46] I say thank God when I started looking
[29:48] at this and studying this subject I just
[29:50] became happier and happier and more
[29:52] grateful all the time that God has given
[29:54] me ears to hear and eyes to see because
[29:57] without that it is impossible friends
[30:01] in the the future home message brother
[30:03] remember says now you say well look at
[30:05] the priest wasn't he a son of God
[30:08] it proved he wasn't he couldn't
[30:11] recognize what did he say I believe the
[30:13] Bible sure but he couldn't recognize the
[30:16] expressed word of the hour
[30:17] he only had an intellectual learning
[30:19] from some group that he had been back
[30:21] before him and it's the same thing today
[30:24] see I know that's strong but it's the
[30:26] truth there was the word a spoken
[30:29] exactly for that day and he yet he was a
[30:32] scholar yet he was a renowned person but
[30:34] he could not recognize it why no matter
[30:36] how scholarly he was anything like that
[30:38] he still didn't have representation of
[30:41] predestination see
[30:43] only the predestinated will only be the
[30:46] one who does it only can be and you only
[30:49] can do it because look it proves
[30:51] predestination because if you've got
[30:54] eternal life you had to be part of God
[30:55] at all times because he's the only one
[30:57] is eternal
[30:59] he said there's a priest that day in
[31:01] Jesus day wasn't he a Son of God he said
[31:04] he proved he wasn't because if he was he
[31:06] would believe that's what Jesus said in
[31:08] John 6 he said if you're of my father
[31:10] you would believe me
[31:12] but now you don't believe me because
[31:13] you're of your father the devil
[31:16] what was Jesus Jesus was the word made
[31:18] manifest amen and now the priest though
[31:21] he was intellectual the priest though he
[31:23] he he had a belief in the word of God he
[31:26] believed that what went on before him he
[31:28] did not have the true Faith amen that
[31:31] comes from a predestinated seed because
[31:33] if he had he would have believed what
[31:35] was standing before him
[31:36] [Music]
[31:41] let's go to Luke chapter 7.
[31:47] Luke chapter 7.
[31:55] in Luke chapter 7 this is the story of
[31:58] Jesus going to Simon
[32:00] the priest house the Levites house and
[32:02] Simon had invited him and he didn't we
[32:05] know he didn't greet him didn't kiss him
[32:07] didn't anoint him with all didn't wash
[32:08] his feet none of these things and and
[32:10] the the woman of ill Fame she came in
[32:12] and broke the alabaster box and she
[32:15] washed his feet with tears and dried his
[32:17] hair kissed his feet we know all that
[32:19] but then they begin to in their heart be
[32:22] critical of the woman
[32:24] and in verse 44 let's pick it up in 44
[32:27] and he turned to the woman and said unto
[32:29] Simon he turned to the woman but he's
[32:32] speaking to Simon the Pharisee
[32:37] he says seeth now this woman
[32:39] I entered into thine house thou gave us
[32:41] me no water from my feet but she hath
[32:43] washed my feet with tears and wiped them
[32:45] with the hairs of her head thou gave us
[32:48] me no kiss but this woman since the time
[32:50] I came in hath not ceased to kiss my
[32:52] feet my head with oil thou does not
[32:54] anoint but this woman hath anointed my
[32:56] feet with ointment wherefore I say unto
[32:58] thee her sins which are many are
[33:00] forgiven for she loved much but to whom
[33:04] little Is Forgiven the same loveth
[33:06] little
[33:07] and he said unto her thy sins are
[33:10] forgiven
[33:12] and they that sat at meat with him began
[33:14] to say within themselves who is this
[33:16] that forgiveth sins also
[33:19] and he said to the woman thy faith hath
[33:22] saved thee
[33:24] go in peace
[33:27] how would she say it wasn't the works
[33:30] The Works were a demonstration of who
[33:31] she believed this was
[33:34] at first it looks like Jesus is
[33:36] rewarding her Works he says you never
[33:37] kissed me she hasn't ceased it because
[33:39] if you didn't wash my feet she washed
[33:40] him with tears and he says your sins are
[33:42] sins which are many are all forgiven
[33:44] amen what was the mechanism amen that
[33:47] declared her righteous that gave her
[33:48] forgiveness of sins it was the fact that
[33:51] she could accept the word for her day
[33:53] amen her he says your faith has saved
[33:56] you
[33:58] amen where did the woman get this
[34:00] ability to believe it wasn't in the
[34:02] school it wasn't in the synagogue it
[34:04] wasn't it was predestinated before the
[34:06] foundation of the world she was a
[34:08] predestinated daughter of God waiting
[34:10] there waiting for something to contact
[34:12] that faith that was laying there and
[34:14] inject Faith so that she could believe
[34:18] and my faith is saved thee
[34:22] go in peace
[34:25] so salvation is of the Lord and it
[34:27] requires the right kind of faith
[34:29] not an intellectual faith not a church
[34:31] Faith but a genuine faith
[34:36] well the man says only the elected who
[34:38] is ordained to see it will see it
[34:41] the rest of them will miss it a million
[34:43] miles
[34:45] when you look at this and I'm gonna I'm
[34:48] going to get into some examples here to
[34:50] show what I'm saying
[34:52] but when we get into this
[34:56] you could you could go two ways
[34:59] depending on I guess your personality or
[35:03] whether or not you have genuine Faith or
[35:05] the grace of God has really become awake
[35:07] in your heart
[35:09] but you can walk away with pride that
[35:11] you can see
[35:13] what others can't see
[35:16] but I don't think that's the reality of
[35:19] faith by grace
[35:23] I think if you walk away with pride that
[35:27] you see what someone else doesn't see
[35:30] then I think you're still stuck in
[35:31] intellectual faith
[35:34] this is my personal belief my personal
[35:37] opinion that
[35:39] how could you come to a revelation of
[35:41] Grace
[35:44] and have pride
[35:47] those two things don't go together
[35:49] I have a revelation of salvation by
[35:51] grace but but I I see and you don't see
[35:54] and I'm this and you're not this and
[35:56] I've got this and you don't have that
[35:57] and this is my position you're nothing
[35:59] my goodness how did you get there amen
[36:01] how was it that Simon would not believe
[36:04] and accept Jesus Christ but this little
[36:06] ill-famed woman could do it it wasn't
[36:08] her Merit ability intellect training
[36:11] teaching it was an absolute gift of God
[36:14] and that gift of God as it went into an
[36:17] expression because it was beating from
[36:19] within her amen caused Jesus Christ to
[36:22] say to her thy sins are forgiven amen it
[36:25] equated to her salvation not her works
[36:27] not her intellect but her faith being
[36:29] expressed in the word for her day
[36:33] and by what Merit
[36:35] none
[36:37] I love the contrast in the Bible amen
[36:40] God has written his Bible in such a way
[36:42] amen he condenses his truths and he
[36:44] wants us to see things and he puts
[36:46] things together amen so this whole scene
[36:48] plays out in a righteous man's house and
[36:51] a Pharisees house amen I mean one that
[36:54] held in good reputation with good
[36:55] training good understanding good
[36:57] intelligence good Bible training good
[37:00] works good alms Deeds good all of this
[37:02] Amen in contrast he'll bring a woman
[37:04] amen who is the opposite of this
[37:08] amen God doesn't do these things by
[37:10] accident this is all intentional amen
[37:12] and the contrast tells the story amen
[37:15] she a Simon is the best of the best
[37:18] she's the worst of the worst Simon's
[37:20] held into respect she's held in
[37:21] disrespect Simon is religious she nobody
[37:24] even pays attention to this woman and
[37:25] whether or not she's religious or saved
[37:27] or anything amen but one of them has
[37:30] representation of predestination and the
[37:32] other one doesn't and it goes to show
[37:34] that it has not the Merit the
[37:36] intelligence the training none of that
[37:38] will work amen it'll take something
[37:41] Supernatural manifesting through a child
[37:44] of God that goes beyond anything that
[37:46] they could think
[37:48] our work up to
[37:52] let's go to John chapter 12.
[38:00] John chapter 12.
[38:02] we'll look at verse 37.
[38:11] John chapter 12 37 but though he had
[38:14] done so many miracles before them yet
[38:16] they believe not on him
[38:21] did he preach the word yes did they
[38:24] believe no
[38:25] did he do the sign of the Messiah yes
[38:27] did they believe no
[38:28] did he do remember
[38:31] you see
[38:32] no matter how good we preach it
[38:36] and no matter how many signs follow us
[38:39] only those that are predestinated to
[38:41] believe will believe
[38:48] but though he had done so many miracles
[38:50] before them yet they believe not on him
[38:53] that the saying of Isaiah is the prophet
[38:55] might be fulfilled which spake Lord who
[38:57] hath believed or important to whom at
[38:59] the arm of the Lord been revealed
[39:01] therefore they could not believe because
[39:03] that Isaiah said again he hath blinded
[39:06] their eyes and hardened their heart that
[39:08] they should not see with their eyes nor
[39:09] understand with their heart and be
[39:11] converted and I should heal them
[39:14] so if you see with your eyes and hear
[39:16] with your heart you'll believe and if
[39:19] you believe you'll be converted
[39:22] what does it take to be converted to
[39:24] have eyes to see
[39:26] ears to hear and a heart to perceive
[39:29] how do you get that by the grace of God
[39:34] when we look in Revelations chapter two
[39:36] we don't have to turn there but
[39:37] Revelation Chapter 2 and chapter 3
[39:39] begins to express the church ages and
[39:42] there's a phrase that's used seven times
[39:45] seven times seven Church edges this
[39:47] phrase is used seven times and the
[39:49] phrase is he that hath an ear let him
[39:51] hear what the spirit saith into the
[39:53] churches
[39:54] how did they get an ear to hear amen how
[39:57] did they get an ear to hear what the
[39:58] spirit was saying to the churches and
[39:59] through every Church seven times he says
[40:02] let him that hath an ear to hear
[40:05] hear what the spirit say to the churches
[40:08] that means in every Church age there
[40:10] would be some who had an ear to hear
[40:12] and there'll be some who didn't have an
[40:14] ear to hear amen but I thank God if he
[40:17] may if he gave you a hearing ear to hear
[40:20] the truth of the word and a heart to
[40:22] believe it amen that's absolutely the
[40:24] grace of God
[40:29] brother Benham says in the message
[40:30] shalom
[40:33] he said God has moved through history
[40:35] with the rhythm of the promise of his
[40:37] word in each age and the same Rhythm
[40:39] making his word you know in Shalom
[40:42] brother starts talking about this great
[40:43] Symphony and the great conductor who's
[40:45] and everybody who's playing their part
[40:46] and he's saying God has moved through
[40:48] history with the rhythm of the promise
[40:50] of of his word in each age in the same
[40:54] Rhythm making his word
[40:56] that's how God moved down through
[40:57] history from all the way from Genesis to
[40:59] Revelation he has moved through history
[41:01] with his word that's right with the
[41:03] rhythm of the power of the Holy Spirit
[41:04] vindicating his word to the elected
[41:07] remember he's never been able to touch
[41:09] the outside church it's only the elected
[41:12] though the symphony is played out by the
[41:14] elected
[41:16] a little further in the same message he
[41:18] said when the real word of God falls
[41:19] upon the Vindicated upon the seed and
[41:23] they see that Vindication of the word
[41:24] they recognize it they're looking at the
[41:27] word they know the junction they know
[41:29] the time they know the change they know
[41:32] the beat that's supposed to be in that
[41:33] hour Hallelujah they know the beat they
[41:36] know the time they know how it's
[41:37] supposed to go see only the elected
[41:40] knows it
[41:42] I love this I love when he says this
[41:44] because when brother Benham says this he
[41:46] puts me in a quandary
[41:47] the moment he makes this statement all
[41:49] of a sudden my head is spinning because
[41:51] brother Branham makes the statement I I
[41:53] want to read it again I want you to
[41:54] think like think think I don't know how
[41:57] I want you to think but I want you to
[41:58] see what I'm thinking
[42:01] he said
[42:02] when the real word of God falls upon the
[42:04] Vindicated upon the seed they see the
[42:06] Vindication of the word they recognize
[42:08] it they're looking at the word they know
[42:10] the junction
[42:11] they know the time they know the change
[42:13] they know the beat that's supposed to be
[42:15] in that hour Hallelujah they know the
[42:17] beat they know the time they know how
[42:19] it's supposed to go see only the elected
[42:21] knows it
[42:22] and and it's almost like brother Benham
[42:24] saying they know they know that it's
[42:27] time for a junction they know that
[42:28] something has to happen and they're
[42:29] watching for it to happen the problem is
[42:31] the elected never knew what was
[42:33] happening until it happened something
[42:35] inside of them knew amen something not
[42:38] here new amen I asked you before you
[42:40] came to the message were you looking for
[42:42] a junction were you looking for a change
[42:43] in the beat the change in the symphony
[42:45] for the end time seal to be open no
[42:49] but you were elected but you didn't know
[42:52] it was coming amen all of a sudden God
[42:54] did something and awakened something and
[42:56] the part of you that knows there's a
[42:58] time for a junction that something has
[43:00] to change is not this part it's not the
[43:02] outer Man part but the inner man was
[43:04] watching for something
[43:06] the inner man was watching for the
[43:08] change of the beat the inner man was
[43:09] watching not your intellect your
[43:11] intellect didn't know anything amen this
[43:13] message come and it ruined my intellect
[43:16] destroyed my religion
[43:21] so it's not as if the elector's sitting
[43:25] around saying something's got to happen
[43:27] there's something out there I feel it
[43:32] no God come and took your breath away
[43:35] surprise you shocked you astonished you
[43:39] but something inside of you says that's
[43:41] nothing but the truth it is the time for
[43:44] this this is the time for the junction
[43:45] there has to be a changing be it is the
[43:48] end time this is the end time sign
[43:51] and then he makes this statement they
[43:54] know it's supposed to how they know how
[43:56] it's supposed to go listen I'm telling
[43:58] you in my intellect I didn't know how it
[44:00] was supposed to go I didn't I was
[44:02] reading the sheet music and I had no
[44:04] idea how to play it for the end time
[44:09] but there was something laying dormant
[44:11] inside that knew how to play from the
[44:13] sheet music
[44:14] that knew how to play my part it was
[44:16] just laying there waiting for an
[44:18] expression
[44:19] waiting amen until got called upon amen
[44:22] then it knew what to do
[44:25] then the next statement he makes
[44:27] he said when Philip saw it he couldn't
[44:29] stand it any longer he knew that was the
[44:31] Messiah
[44:32] Philip didn't know before Philip knew
[44:35] when he saw the expression something
[44:36] inside of Philip recognized that this is
[44:38] true
[44:40] I'm feeling solid you couldn't stand any
[44:41] longer he knew that was Messiah so he
[44:44] went to a fellow that he had a Bible
[44:45] study together he said Nathaniel he said
[44:47] come see a man come see what we found we
[44:50] have found Jesus of Nazareth we have
[44:52] found Jesus of Nazareth that's the
[44:53] prophet that Moses spoke of that would
[44:55] come we have found him we've found him
[44:57] so now Philip is awake to the sheet
[45:00] music Philip knows this is it so Philip
[45:02] comes to Nathanael nathanael's another
[45:04] elect seed and he begins to tell
[45:06] Nathanael hey guess what this is what
[45:08] Moses talked about this is the Messiah
[45:10] and Nathanael says I don't think so
[45:14] can anything good from that Nathaniel's
[45:16] not he doesn't already know friends
[45:18] Nathanael in his flesh he's doubting he
[45:21] doesn't believe Philip's report and
[45:24] Philip says just come and see and when
[45:26] he comes in contact with Jesus Jesus
[45:28] works the sign of the Messiah on him and
[45:30] he says amen Thou Art God Amen thou Thou
[45:34] Art the Messiah
[45:36] what was it he didn't know here amen
[45:39] something inside he had to come in
[45:41] contact with Jesus Christ and when he
[45:43] came in contact with the Living God it
[45:45] awakened that part that understood the
[45:47] time understood the sheet music
[45:53] Hallelujah
[45:56] so there was a part
[45:59] of me and a part of you
[46:01] that was laying there dormant that that
[46:03] was waiting for an expression
[46:06] but everywhere we went to church and
[46:08] everything we did and all of our efforts
[46:10] they amounted to absolutely nothing
[46:15] but at some given time some appointed
[46:18] time
[46:19] amen God made sure that he came our way
[46:24] and he made sure that he contacted us to
[46:28] awaken the part inside of us that would
[46:30] recognize him in the hour that he's in
[46:34] that wasn't us doing anything it was him
[46:37] doing it
[46:41] let's go to Genesis 15.
[46:45] I touched on this Sunday and I just I
[46:47] can't shake it the story of Sarah
[46:51] and God has really drawn my attention
[46:53] back to it and I want to explore
[46:56] some of this with you
[47:07] I'm gonna follow the life of Abraham
[47:09] just for a few scriptures in Genesis 15
[47:12] verse 2 he says in Abraham said Lord God
[47:14] what will thou give me sing I go
[47:16] childless and the steward of my house is
[47:18] this Eliezer of Damascus
[47:20] and Abram said behold to me thou has
[47:22] given no seed and lo one born in my
[47:25] house is mine heir
[47:28] and behold the word of the Lord came
[47:31] unto him saying this shall not thine
[47:33] this shall not be thine Heir but he that
[47:35] shall come forth out of thine own bow
[47:37] shall be thine Heir and he brought him
[47:39] forth abroad and said look now toward
[47:42] heaven and tell the Stars if thou be
[47:44] able to number them and he said unto
[47:46] them so shall thy seed be
[47:48] so now Abraham Abram at this point
[47:50] receives a promise of a son that will
[47:53] come forth from his bounds so let's go
[47:55] to Genesis 16 verse 1.
[47:58] it says now Sarai Abram's wife bear him
[48:01] no children and she had a handmaid an
[48:03] Egyptian whose name was Hagar
[48:05] and Sarah said unto Abram behold now the
[48:07] Lord hath restrained me from bearing I
[48:10] pray they go into my maid it may be that
[48:12] I may obtain children by her and Abram
[48:15] hearkened through the voice of Sarai
[48:17] so first we start with the promised word
[48:21] and and I just if you can just bear with
[48:23] me for a minute while I express what's
[48:25] in my heart
[48:27] Sarah knew the promise that was given to
[48:30] Abraham so she knew the word for her day
[48:34] is that right
[48:35] so Abraham had received the promise she
[48:37] was part of Abraham amen the problem is
[48:40] she had doubts
[48:42] she did not believe she was part of that
[48:44] promise
[48:46] is that right because had she believed
[48:49] she was part of the promise she wouldn't
[48:51] have looked for someone else to fulfill
[48:53] the role
[48:55] so now here is Sarah expressing doubt
[48:59] expressing unbelief
[49:01] but guess what I believe she's a
[49:03] predestinated seed of God
[49:06] I believe the promise she's included in
[49:09] the promise because she's included in
[49:11] Abraham
[49:12] but yet she's confused in her own mind
[49:15] and doubting in her own mind amen and so
[49:18] Sarah here is doubting and disbelieving
[49:20] her part of the promise not that she's
[49:22] disbelieving the promise she's
[49:24] disbelieving herself as part of the
[49:26] promise
[49:30] praise God
[49:32] let's go to Genesis 17.
[49:39] Genesis 17 15 God and God said unto
[49:43] Abraham ask for Sarah thy wife Thou
[49:45] shalt not call her Sarai but Sarah shall
[49:48] be her name
[49:49] shall her name be and I will bless her
[49:52] and give thee a son also of her yea I
[49:55] will bless her and she shall be a mother
[49:57] of Nations Kings of people shall be of
[49:59] her then Abraham fell upon his face and
[50:02] laughed and said in his heart shall a
[50:03] child be born unto him that is a hundred
[50:05] years old and shall Sarah that is 90
[50:08] years old bear and Abraham said unto God
[50:10] oh that Ishmael might live before thee
[50:12] and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear
[50:15] thee a son indeed and thou shalt call
[50:18] his name Isaac and I will establish my
[50:20] Covenant with him for an Everlasting
[50:22] Covenant and with his seed after him
[50:25] and as for Ishmael I have heard thee
[50:28] behold I have blessed him and I will
[50:30] make him fruitful and I will multiply
[50:32] him exceedingly twelve princes shall he
[50:34] begin and and I will make him a great
[50:36] nation but my Covenant will I establish
[50:38] with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto
[50:41] thee at this set time the next year
[50:45] so God comes to Abraham and he gives him
[50:47] a further revelation of the promise and
[50:50] that further Revelation is a name change
[50:52] but also that Sarah shall bear the son
[50:54] and he States it three times
[50:57] three times Sarah shall bear a son Sarah
[50:59] shall bear a son Sarah shall bear a son
[51:03] but let's go over to Genesis 18.
[51:06] verse 9.
[51:09] he says then they said unto him
[51:12] where is Sarah thy wife and he said
[51:13] behold in the tent he said I will
[51:16] certainly return unto you according to
[51:17] the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife
[51:19] shall have a son and Sarah heard in the
[51:22] tent which was behind him and Abraham
[51:24] and Sarah were old and well stricken in
[51:26] age and it ceased to be with Sarah after
[51:28] the manner of women therefore Sarah
[51:30] laughed within herself saying after I am
[51:32] waxed old shall I have pleasure in my
[51:34] Lord being old also
[51:38] and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore
[51:41] did Sarah laugh saying shall I of Surety
[51:43] bear a child which a mole is anything
[51:46] too hard for the Lord
[51:47] at the time appointed I will return unto
[51:50] thee according to the time of life and
[51:51] Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied
[51:55] saying I laugh not for she was afraid
[51:57] and he said nay but thou didst laugh
[52:01] here we find that Sarah a predestinated
[52:04] child of God she is doubting the promise
[52:07] of God
[52:08] is that what you see
[52:10] I hope I'm not the only one she she the
[52:14] promise was in a name change there was a
[52:17] name change and in the name change of
[52:18] God also made the a further Revelation
[52:21] that Sarah shall bow to Bear a son and
[52:23] thou shall call his name Isaac and the
[52:25] promise shall be with Isaac whom Sarah
[52:27] shall bear it was very specific amen but
[52:30] Sarah amen is looking at herself and
[52:32] looking at her age and looking at the
[52:34] circumstances and she can't believe the
[52:36] word
[52:38] and when God comes down in flesh and he
[52:41] begins Amen to confirm the promise Amen
[52:43] in in this this man's already Discerning
[52:46] because he already knows the new name he
[52:47] knows it's Abraham and he knows it's
[52:49] Sarah showing that it's Elohim it's
[52:51] Jehovah God Amen and now he begins to
[52:54] say at this appointed time amen Sarah
[52:57] shall bear a son and she begins to doubt
[52:59] it and begins to laugh amen and and God
[53:01] calls her out on it
[53:06] you say oh my goodness
[53:08] Sarah
[53:10] get a hold of yourself
[53:15] let's go to Genesis 21.
[53:21] this is what we were speaking of
[53:24] on Sunday
[53:27] Genesis 21
[53:29] and the Lord visited Sarah as he had
[53:32] said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he
[53:34] had spoken for Sarah conceived and bear
[53:37] Abraham a son in his old age at the set
[53:39] time of which God had spoken to him
[53:43] I think this is an amazing scripture
[53:45] because we find in Genesis 18 that she's
[53:47] doubting
[53:48] when God comes in flesh and shows the
[53:50] sign of the Messiah she's doubting
[53:54] but in Genesis 21 there's a private
[53:56] visitation where the Lord himself visits
[53:59] Sarah
[54:01] and Sarah conceives and the question is
[54:03] what happened in this visitation it
[54:05] doesn't tell you but if we go back to
[54:07] the book of Hebrews
[54:10] back to the book of Hebrews
[54:13] let's go there together
[54:15] Hebrews 11
[54:17] and 11.
[54:23] Hebrews 11 11 through faith also Sarah
[54:26] herself received strength to conceive
[54:28] seed it was delivered of a child when
[54:30] she was past age because she judged him
[54:32] faithful who had promised
[54:35] oh praise be to God I love the way the
[54:38] Bible is written and Genesis 18 she
[54:40] doubt it in Genesis 18 she questions in
[54:43] Genesis 18 she laughs amen and God calls
[54:46] her out on it and she even denies it to
[54:48] God's face because she's afraid
[54:50] here she's expressing doubt here she's
[54:52] expressing unbelief amen but a little
[54:54] bit later God does something Sarah could
[54:57] not do for herself God comes and he
[54:59] visits Sarah and a private meeting with
[55:02] just Him and Sarah he visits Sarah at
[55:04] the appointed time and what happens by
[55:06] faith she receives strength to conceive
[55:09] where did she get the faith when she met
[55:12] God herself she received the faith amen
[55:15] awaken the faith that was in her before
[55:18] it was intellectual intellectual
[55:20] intellectual intellectual it was a
[55:22] promise for Abraham then she wasn't part
[55:24] of it now he comes and says you're part
[55:26] of it she still doubts that she part of
[55:28] it because she's not capable
[55:32] why doesn't God cast her way brother van
[55:34] said he couldn't kill her then because
[55:36] he couldn't hurt her without hurting
[55:37] Abraham she was part of Abraham she was
[55:39] part of the promise amen God can't
[55:42] destroy her for her unbelief for her
[55:44] stupidity for her lying he can't destroy
[55:47] her because she's part of Abraham she's
[55:48] part of the promise
[55:50] and because she's part of the promise
[55:52] and struggling to believe God has to do
[55:55] something to Quicken her faith and God
[55:57] himself comes to her in Genesis 21.
[56:01] and what is the result by faith she
[56:03] receives strength to conceive sin
[56:06] by faith it wasn't just something God
[56:09] just came and did God did something to
[56:11] get to Quicken her faith so she could
[56:13] believe the promise and by faith she
[56:15] receives strength to conceive
[56:20] brother Benham he comes to this and he
[56:22] says
[56:23] God could not destroy Sarah without
[56:25] hurting Abraham he said and neither can
[56:28] God destroy us for our stupidity
[56:30] because we're part of Jesus Christ and
[56:32] part of the word and part of the promise
[56:34] so what does God have to do God Amen
[56:37] because we're predestinated like Sarah
[56:39] was predestinated amen she disbelieves
[56:41] she doubted she questioned she laughed
[56:43] at she lied to God she had all these
[56:45] things that would put her out of the
[56:47] promise the problem is she was in the
[56:49] back part of God's mind part of that
[56:50] promise before the foundation of the
[56:52] world so God himself would step on the
[56:55] scene and unlock a faith that's trapped
[56:57] deep inside of her heart what did Sarah
[57:00] do that was worth anything what did
[57:02] Sarah do that she could be proud about
[57:07] it was all God
[57:10] Sarah's testimony wasn't so nice
[57:14] until God injected himself
[57:17] on the scene
[57:19] I'm telling you my testimony wasn't so
[57:21] nice
[57:22] until God revealed himself to me
[57:25] personally
[57:29] God would have what were we doing how
[57:32] were we living what were
[57:35] how many times did we doubt how many
[57:37] times did we question how many times did
[57:41] we doubt the very word of God
[57:43] how many times did we question the word
[57:45] of God how many times how many
[57:47] statements that we would love to take
[57:49] back how many statements of disbelief
[57:51] how many statements of I could never be
[57:53] one of them or it's for somebody else
[57:54] it's not for me how many times did
[57:56] people make foolish statements that
[57:58] should put them out of the promise the
[58:00] problem is they're part of Christ
[58:01] they're part of the word they can never
[58:03] be out of the promise
[58:06] and because of that God's going to have
[58:09] to come down it looks like they don't
[58:11] believe it looks like they can't believe
[58:13] this is why we should never lose faith
[58:15] in our children never lose faith in
[58:17] those that have walked away it doesn't
[58:18] matter what they say if they're part of
[58:20] the promise amen God will inject himself
[58:23] in their life somewhere and unlock the
[58:25] faith that's buried down inside
[58:29] they may have said foolish things Sarah
[58:31] did they may have acted in disbelief
[58:33] Sarah did amen but she was part of the
[58:36] promise all along
[58:40] amen
[58:42] many of us would write off many people
[58:45] because of things they say or things
[58:47] that they do
[58:49] I'm telling you the story's not over
[58:51] till the story's over
[58:55] this old scene with Sarah
[58:58] receiving strength to conceive has
[59:00] blessed me so much
[59:02] because I realized in order for me to
[59:05] conceive on this word God had to come to
[59:07] me
[59:08] it took something more than just hearing
[59:10] words amen it took something more amen
[59:13] than just knowing that there was a
[59:14] promise and knowing that there was a
[59:15] bride I could believe there was a pride
[59:17] I could believe this was the day when
[59:19] Jesus Christ amen when the son of man
[59:21] had returned to Earth I could believe
[59:22] all of that and believe he was calling
[59:24] out a bride and believe and believe and
[59:25] believe Sarah could believe that to be a
[59:27] son born of Abraham she could believe
[59:29] but she had to recognize that she was
[59:31] part of that plan and part of that
[59:33] promise
[59:34] and she in her flesh did not have the
[59:37] capacity to believe that
[59:40] so God would do something Supernatural
[59:42] in her life
[59:44] to give her the faith to conceive
[59:49] to have strength to conceive seed by
[59:51] faith
[59:53] I'm so glad that God knows where we're
[59:55] at
[59:56] and this is why faith is a mystery this
[59:58] is why I said faith is a mystery
[1:00:01] it wasn't that Sarah was a a super super
[1:00:04] in faith
[1:00:07] but God came to her to unlock a faith
[1:00:10] that was hidden there
[1:00:12] to give her faith to conceive to have
[1:00:15] strength to conceive seed
[1:00:18] brother man in the Christ is the mystery
[1:00:20] of God revealed he says what is the new
[1:00:21] birth then
[1:00:22] you say well brother Branham what is the
[1:00:24] new birth it is the revelation of Jesus
[1:00:27] Christ personally to you
[1:00:30] this is listen this is so far beyond
[1:00:32] saying that I believe there's a bride
[1:00:36] I believe brother Branham was Malachi 4
[1:00:38] Revelation 10 7 the seventh angel I
[1:00:41] believe he's come to call out a bride it
[1:00:42] was a son of man revealing the son of
[1:00:44] man and the Bride of crisis on the earth
[1:00:45] and and and what is the bride doing
[1:00:47] she's manifesting the son of man again
[1:00:49] that's wonderful but where do you fit
[1:00:51] into that plan
[1:00:52] where do you and I fit into that plan
[1:00:55] and we can have intellectual repeat but
[1:00:57] it's got to be more than an intellectual
[1:00:58] repeat there's got to be a genuine faith
[1:01:01] that goes beyond amen uh beyond all of
[1:01:04] the outside man it comes and wakes up
[1:01:05] the one who knows the part that needs to
[1:01:07] be played
[1:01:09] praise God
[1:01:11] what is the new birth
[1:01:14] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:01:16] personally to you not you joined a
[1:01:18] church you shook a hand you've done
[1:01:19] something different you said a Creed you
[1:01:21] promised to live by a code of rules but
[1:01:22] Christ the Bible he's the word that was
[1:01:24] revealed to you and no matter what
[1:01:26] anybody says what takes place it's
[1:01:28] Christ Pastor priest whatever it might
[1:01:30] be it's Christ in you that is the
[1:01:32] Revelation that the church was built
[1:01:34] upon
[1:01:37] we all know because we preached it
[1:01:39] before a few on a few occasions
[1:01:42] but Sarah
[1:01:44] after this encounter in Genesis 21
[1:01:47] she has Faith Now by faith she receive
[1:01:50] strength to conceive seed she brings
[1:01:52] forth the promised son but now she
[1:01:55] understands the promise
[1:01:57] now there's no more doubt now there's no
[1:02:00] more questions now she knows where she
[1:02:02] fits what the word for her day is amen
[1:02:04] who this is that she brought forth she
[1:02:06] has an understanding of the full promise
[1:02:08] she hasn't just heard it she knows it
[1:02:11] she's part of it and now amen when the
[1:02:14] son of the Bond woman begins to mock the
[1:02:16] son amen her son amen now Sarah with the
[1:02:19] revelation of the word it's unlocked by
[1:02:21] faith she says cast out the Bond woman
[1:02:24] and her son for the son of the bomb
[1:02:26] woman shall not be Heir with my son
[1:02:28] what's she doing she knows this promise
[1:02:31] now she understands there's no question
[1:02:33] in her mind there's no doubt in her mind
[1:02:35] now she's standing upon the promise
[1:02:39] and now Paul picks up what Sarah says
[1:02:41] later in the book of Galatians it says
[1:02:43] doth not scripture say
[1:02:46] cast out the bombing what scripture the
[1:02:48] scripture where Sarah said why because
[1:02:51] something happened in Sarah to where she
[1:02:53] caught the revelation of the hour and
[1:02:55] now what she's speaking is the word of
[1:02:57] the Lord amen it's the revelation of the
[1:03:00] of the prophecy now fulfilled and she's
[1:03:03] speaking what's right Abraham himself
[1:03:05] now has a question because of his own
[1:03:07] emotion what do I do with this son and
[1:03:09] what about Sarah and God himself says
[1:03:11] hearken to the voice of thy wife for
[1:03:13] what she says is Right amen
[1:03:18] what did it teaching being in the right
[1:03:21] home no
[1:03:23] Supernatural encounter where the Lord
[1:03:25] visited Sarah
[1:03:27] I say friends we need a supernatural
[1:03:30] visitation from God to unlock Faith amen
[1:03:33] we need an injection of the faith of the
[1:03:34] Son of God himself Amen to unlock what's
[1:03:37] laying there
[1:03:39] are training our education our years
[1:03:41] experience it's not going to work amen
[1:03:43] our ability to read our ability to play
[1:03:45] a tape that's not going to work it's
[1:03:46] going to take something from God
[1:03:50] and if God unlocks that Faith inside of
[1:03:52] us then what do we have to be proud
[1:03:54] about
[1:03:56] we should be the most grateful people
[1:03:58] hey that have ever walked the face of
[1:03:59] the Earth because I have eyes to see and
[1:04:01] I didn't give them to myself I have ears
[1:04:03] to hear and I was deaf and I was mutant
[1:04:05] I was blind until he came to me and when
[1:04:08] he came to me he opened my spiritual
[1:04:10] eyes he opened my understanding he
[1:04:12] opened my ears I didn't open them myself
[1:04:14] I didn't grab a church age book and said
[1:04:16] I'll study this and figure it out I did
[1:04:18] there was no study and figure out
[1:04:19] anything it was God who turned the key
[1:04:22] of Revelation
[1:04:27] so we should be super grateful
[1:04:31] but also very compassionate
[1:04:35] super grateful but very compassionate
[1:04:39] because where would I be if he hadn't
[1:04:41] unlocked Faith inside of me
[1:04:43] where would I be and what would I be
[1:04:45] saying and what would I be doing
[1:04:47] it was the grace of God
[1:04:53] and the message I have heard but now I
[1:04:54] see he says no matter how religious you
[1:04:56] are how many churches you belong to how
[1:04:58] many books your name's on if that
[1:05:00] genuine Holy Ghost is in you which is
[1:05:02] this word manifested
[1:05:04] you'll see the message and the hour
[1:05:06] because it's the holy ghost that does it
[1:05:10] but there has to be something like that
[1:05:12] off inspiration strike you
[1:05:14] if you pour water on the ground and on
[1:05:16] the ground on the ground and there's no
[1:05:18] seed in there to strike it how could it
[1:05:19] ever bring forth anything there's
[1:05:20] nothing there to bring forth that is
[1:05:23] that only the elected of God will see it
[1:05:26] the elected of God seen it in Noah's
[1:05:28] time Moses time Jesus time the apostles
[1:05:30] time Luther's time Wesley's time
[1:05:32] Pentecost time because that was the seed
[1:05:34] that was on the earth when this
[1:05:36] inspiration was poured out now while The
[1:05:38] Inspirations poured out to gather the
[1:05:40] bride together it's only those who are
[1:05:42] elected will see it Jesus said I thank
[1:05:44] thee father that thou has hid these
[1:05:46] things from the eyes of the wise and
[1:05:47] prudent and revealed it to babes such as
[1:05:49] would learn now inspiration has to
[1:05:51] strike it
[1:05:53] so you have to have two things there has
[1:05:55] to be a seed of predestination on the
[1:05:57] inside there has to be a predestinated
[1:05:59] seed there to receive it but there has
[1:06:01] to be inspiration that strikes it
[1:06:04] it takes God coming down and injecting
[1:06:07] himself it takes a Genesis 21 experience
[1:06:11] and that inspiration can pour out and
[1:06:13] pour out and there's no seed there
[1:06:15] there's no life but if the seed lays
[1:06:17] there no inspiration strikes it it
[1:06:18] doesn't come to manifestation so what
[1:06:21] could you do without God anyways and
[1:06:23] where did you get the seed
[1:06:28] and how did it come awake
[1:06:31] inspiration Struck it by the grace of
[1:06:33] God
[1:06:35] let's go to mark 16.
[1:06:42] I just want to look at just two more
[1:06:43] places here and
[1:06:46] to see this principle
[1:06:49] mark 16. and nine
[1:07:05] Mark 16 and 9.
[1:07:08] now when Jesus was risen early the first
[1:07:11] day of the week he appeared first to
[1:07:12] Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast
[1:07:14] Seven Devils
[1:07:15] and she went and told them that had been
[1:07:17] with him as they mourned and wept
[1:07:20] and they when they had heard that he was
[1:07:22] alive and had been seen after her
[1:07:24] believed not
[1:07:28] pay close attention to this who are
[1:07:30] these These are his disciples
[1:07:33] these are the eleven
[1:07:35] are they predestinated seed of God
[1:07:38] yes
[1:07:40] let's read it again verse 11 when they
[1:07:41] when they had heard that he was alive
[1:07:43] and had been seen of her believed not
[1:07:47] they were disbelieving the manifestation
[1:07:50] of their hour
[1:07:55] after that after they disbelieved
[1:07:59] after that he appeared in another form
[1:08:01] and the two of them as they walked and
[1:08:03] went in the country and they went and
[1:08:05] told it unto the residue neither believe
[1:08:07] they them
[1:08:10] so we have the mouth of two witnesses
[1:08:12] and they're not believing
[1:08:16] so what does God do with his
[1:08:18] predestinated seed who's not believing
[1:08:19] does he cast them away does he does he
[1:08:22] chasten them and say you're no longer
[1:08:23] part of me you get away from me no he
[1:08:26] can't cast him away no matter what their
[1:08:29] stupidity or unbelief is because they
[1:08:31] were part of him before the foundation
[1:08:32] of the world their names were put in the
[1:08:34] Lamb's Book of Life he can't cast them
[1:08:36] away brother bam said he would he would
[1:08:39] get rid of us for our stupidity
[1:08:42] yes
[1:08:44] I've had some stupidity
[1:08:47] but he can't get rid of me amen he can't
[1:08:49] cast me away because he chose me for the
[1:08:51] foundation of the world
[1:08:53] so here it's too the the first group
[1:08:56] comes back with a testimony he's alive
[1:08:57] they believe it not the two on the road
[1:08:59] to mass come back with the testimony
[1:09:01] he's alive they believe it not
[1:09:04] in verse 14.
[1:09:06] afterward he appeared unto the eleven
[1:09:09] now he came to them himself
[1:09:15] I'm telling you it's good to be elect
[1:09:18] it's good to be a lactate amen it's good
[1:09:21] to be part of the program because no
[1:09:23] matter what you said when you first
[1:09:24] heard the message or what foolish
[1:09:26] statement you made or how you didn't
[1:09:28] believe this crazy thing your neighbor
[1:09:29] or your friend or your co-worker or
[1:09:31] somebody else taught you amen but down
[1:09:34] inside of you was a predestinated seed
[1:09:36] Gene of God that he wasn't going to lose
[1:09:38] amen so somewhere along the line if you
[1:09:41] didn't believe this testimony and did
[1:09:42] believe that testimony somewhere along
[1:09:44] the line he would come to you
[1:09:53] after Rudy appeared unto the 11 as they
[1:09:55] sat at me and unbraided them with their
[1:09:58] unbelief
[1:09:59] and hardness of harm because they
[1:10:01] believed not them which had seen him
[1:10:03] after he was risen he embraded them he
[1:10:06] rebuked him he corrected them
[1:10:08] and then what did he do
[1:10:10] he said go you into all the world and
[1:10:12] preach the gospel to Every Creature
[1:10:14] you're still mine and I still got a job
[1:10:16] for you to do you're still part of the
[1:10:18] program you're still part of the promise
[1:10:19] you're still my seed you're still the
[1:10:21] manifestation of the hour it caused me
[1:10:23] to come to you myself
[1:10:29] praise God Almighty it's good to be
[1:10:31] elect's friends
[1:10:33] I mean we've done all the foolishness
[1:10:35] thing the world has done we've done all
[1:10:37] the foolish things the denominations
[1:10:38] have done the difference is
[1:10:40] predestination the difference is
[1:10:42] election
[1:10:43] and that election didn't allow him to
[1:10:45] throw us away that election wouldn't
[1:10:47] allow him to to go seek another that
[1:10:50] election would bring him to us in a
[1:10:52] personal revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:10:54] himself revealed personally amen
[1:11:00] amen and then he would commission us
[1:11:02] go ahead and read your part of the sheet
[1:11:04] music and play it now
[1:11:07] and then something in you at this
[1:11:09] meeting with Jesus Christ would know the
[1:11:11] junction would know the time would be
[1:11:13] looking for it
[1:11:15] your brain could have been confused but
[1:11:17] something inside would recognize
[1:11:19] when he comes to us
[1:11:23] let's go to Acts 26.
[1:11:32] Acts chapter 26.
[1:11:36] verse 12.
[1:11:40] this is the Apostle Paul giving a
[1:11:42] testimony before Agrippa
[1:11:45] so whereupon I was
[1:11:47] as I went to Damascus with authority and
[1:11:50] commission from the chief priest at
[1:11:52] midday a king O King I saw in the way a
[1:11:55] light from heaven above the brightness
[1:11:56] of the sun shining around about me and
[1:11:59] them which journeyed with me and when we
[1:12:01] were all Fallen to the earth I heard a
[1:12:03] voice speaking into me and saying in the
[1:12:05] Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why persecutest
[1:12:07] thou me it is hard for thee to kick
[1:12:10] against the pricks
[1:12:11] and I said who art thou Lord
[1:12:14] and he said I am Jesus
[1:12:16] whom thou persecutest
[1:12:19] what was Saul doing
[1:12:22] he was persecuting the Christians
[1:12:25] he was hauling them into prison he was
[1:12:27] having them beaten some were even killed
[1:12:30] he was there consenting at the death of
[1:12:32] Stephen all of these things he was doing
[1:12:34] what was he doing he was fighting the
[1:12:36] word he was fighting the message of the
[1:12:37] hour
[1:12:39] he says he this is Apostle Paul he said
[1:12:42] I blasphemed
[1:12:45] but I did it ignorantly
[1:12:47] but Paul says
[1:12:49] here he is killing the Christians
[1:12:53] hauling them to prison persecuting
[1:12:55] trying to shut down this roof he's
[1:12:56] fighting against the truth and Jesus say
[1:12:59] why are you persecuting me
[1:13:02] and all of this persecution you know
[1:13:04] what Jesus didn't come down to exhort
[1:13:08] his wrath upon this man who was doing
[1:13:10] all this work he didn't come down to
[1:13:12] Stone him to kill him amen he didn't
[1:13:14] come down to murder him he came down to
[1:13:16] do what he came down to wake up the seed
[1:13:19] that was laying dormant inside a Saul
[1:13:22] why because he was a chosen vessel unto
[1:13:25] the Lord
[1:13:26] amen all of the evil that he was doing
[1:13:29] all the unbelief that he was expressing
[1:13:31] all the wrong Deeds that he was
[1:13:33] committing couldn't cause God to cast
[1:13:35] him away because he was a predestinated
[1:13:37] seed what would it do it would bring him
[1:13:39] down on the scene it would cause him to
[1:13:42] introduce himself to Paul so Paul would
[1:13:44] know Paul this is me this is who you
[1:13:46] really are you're going the wrong way
[1:13:51] oh praise God it's good to be elect
[1:13:57] this is why Paul couldn't be puffed up
[1:13:59] this is why he couldn't he couldn't
[1:14:01] exalt himself he was going the wrong way
[1:14:04] multiple times in the gospels he
[1:14:06] expresses regret for his earlier life
[1:14:09] he said he wasn't even worthy to be an
[1:14:11] apostle because he persecuted the church
[1:14:14] Paul lived with regret for what he did
[1:14:17] but it didn't change who he was and it
[1:14:19] never caused God to turn his back on who
[1:14:21] he was he was always ordained to be a
[1:14:23] Son of God and always called to be the
[1:14:25] first church age messenger
[1:14:28] what would his stupidity what would his
[1:14:30] unbelief what would his Rebellion
[1:14:32] against the word do it would cause God
[1:14:34] to come down to Saul himself
[1:14:38] [Music]
[1:14:43] oh I thank God
[1:14:45] I thank God I was I was steeped in
[1:14:49] religion stuck in my father's in my
[1:14:51] grandfather's religion believing it was
[1:14:53] the only way living a compromised
[1:14:55] half-baked half-christian nominal life
[1:14:59] hmm
[1:15:00] when I first heard the truth I thought
[1:15:03] it was a cult
[1:15:07] I received books and tapes for one
[1:15:09] reason only and that was to that was so
[1:15:11] I could read them to prove that it was a
[1:15:13] cult
[1:15:15] but oh I thank God he didn't cast me
[1:15:17] away because of my stupidity and because
[1:15:19] of my expression of unbelief because of
[1:15:21] my ignorance what he did is he came down
[1:15:23] and he revealed himself to me personally
[1:15:25] amen what is the new birth is Jesus
[1:15:27] Christ revealed to you personally
[1:15:32] and what did it do it unlocked a Faith
[1:15:34] in Me That Couldn't Express before
[1:15:37] it unlocked something in me where there
[1:15:39] was disbelief now there was Faith where
[1:15:41] there was questions now there was
[1:15:43] answers where where there was doubts now
[1:15:44] there was an absolute belief and a
[1:15:46] willingness to sell out where I once
[1:15:48] held it at arm's League now I embrace it
[1:15:50] with all that's in me what did that he
[1:15:53] did that amen he did that by unlocking
[1:15:55] something the inspiration struck water
[1:15:57] hit the seed
[1:15:59] and I couldn't do it on my own and I
[1:16:02] couldn't do it with no seat it was all
[1:16:03] because of God
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:07] that's why this faith is a mystery
[1:16:11] it wasn't the good priest it was the
[1:16:13] Harlot who had faith
[1:16:18] it wasn't the multitudes in Jerusalem
[1:16:20] who were coming to the feasts and
[1:16:22] sacrificing the animals it was the
[1:16:23] Samaritan woman who had too many
[1:16:25] husbands
[1:16:29] his faith is a mystery and god holds the
[1:16:32] mystery
[1:16:35] oh I thank God
[1:16:38] brother Branham says and the message
[1:16:39] works is Faith expressed so now Faith is
[1:16:42] a revelation from God now Faith is a
[1:16:45] revelation there's where I want to stay
[1:16:47] there just a moment it's a revelation he
[1:16:49] has revealed it to you by his grace
[1:16:52] it's nothing you did you didn't work
[1:16:54] yourself up to Faith you never have
[1:16:56] faith it's give to you by the grace of
[1:16:59] God and God reveals it to you therefore
[1:17:01] faith is a revelation
[1:17:04] you cannot work yourself up to Faith
[1:17:08] God has to Grant it
[1:17:11] further down in the same message he says
[1:17:13] now the Roman Catholic Church says he
[1:17:15] was speaking to Peter Upon This Rock
[1:17:17] I'll build my church
[1:17:19] the Protestants say he was building it
[1:17:21] upon himself now they could be right but
[1:17:23] to me both of them is wrong
[1:17:25] it was upon the spiritual revelation of
[1:17:27] who he was
[1:17:28] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:17:30] you Peter but my Father which is in
[1:17:32] heaven has revealed this to you and Upon
[1:17:34] This Rock the revelation of who he is
[1:17:36] upon the Revelation he is the word
[1:17:40] Upon This Rock I'll build my church and
[1:17:42] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:17:44] it show that the gates of hell would be
[1:17:46] against it what against the revelation
[1:17:48] of Jesus Christ in your day
[1:17:50] that's what the hell the gates of hell
[1:17:52] are against amen but what will the Gates
[1:17:54] of Hell beat not be able to derail
[1:17:56] against the Revelation that comes from
[1:17:58] the father
[1:17:59] Revelation from the father not
[1:18:02] Revelation from your mind Revelation
[1:18:04] from the father
[1:18:06] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:18:08] that
[1:18:09] he goes on to say Abel by faith
[1:18:11] revelation
[1:18:13] by by faith offered unto God a more
[1:18:15] excellent sacrifice than that which came
[1:18:18] which God testified he was righteous how
[1:18:21] by faith how by Revelation by Revelation
[1:18:24] Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[1:18:26] sacrifice because it was revealed to him
[1:18:28] that it wasn't fruits of the field it
[1:18:31] was blood
[1:18:32] that's why some people can believe it
[1:18:35] and some can't believe it
[1:18:37] some tried to make believe it
[1:18:40] in an audience of people where I pray a
[1:18:42] prayer line comes through you'll find
[1:18:44] and they were all good people
[1:18:46] will say there's some that's trying hard
[1:18:48] to believe it trying to work themselves
[1:18:50] into it some just can't do it at all
[1:18:53] others it's just by Grace it's just
[1:18:56] given to them
[1:18:58] now there's the difference see that that
[1:19:01] does it that's the real Revelation
[1:19:03] because faith is a revelation from God
[1:19:05] it must be revealed first
[1:19:08] Jesus clearly expressed this when he
[1:19:10] said no man can come to me except my
[1:19:12] father draws him first or reveals me to
[1:19:14] him first
[1:19:16] I remember saying even in the prayer
[1:19:18] line some are trying to believe
[1:19:23] some is trying hard to believe
[1:19:25] trying to work themselves into it
[1:19:28] some can't do it at all
[1:19:31] and others it's just by Grace they just
[1:19:34] believe
[1:19:38] see that's the real faith
[1:19:40] that trying and pressing and trying to
[1:19:42] grab a hold and make something happen
[1:19:44] and trying to be bold and trying to be
[1:19:47] no
[1:19:48] it's just natural
[1:19:50] it's just the faith of God that God
[1:19:52] injects
[1:19:54] it's a gift of faith that just says it's
[1:19:56] the truth
[1:19:58] it's nothing but the truth and it's for
[1:20:00] me and it's for now and this is the time
[1:20:04] it's not something you can work in
[1:20:06] work out pump up pull down it's given by
[1:20:10] grace
[1:20:13] that's why we just go to God and say God
[1:20:16] give me more of your faith
[1:20:18] Lord just let me grow in faith and the
[1:20:21] knowledge of the Lord God help me I need
[1:20:24] more of you
[1:20:26] I don't need more pretending I don't
[1:20:28] need more theatrics I don't need more I
[1:20:30] don't need more words
[1:20:33] I don't need to impress anybody else by
[1:20:36] my firm statements
[1:20:39] what I need is I need God
[1:20:42] to grant me the gift of faith
[1:20:44] I need God to water the seed that's in
[1:20:47] Me by his word and let the faith in me
[1:20:49] grow amen and take full control I need
[1:20:52] Grace in my life
[1:20:54] and it's amazing when we talk about
[1:20:56] Grace Grace I I think brother bear said
[1:21:00] Grace unto disgrace
[1:21:02] so much grace preaching as if as if
[1:21:05] Grace is a teaching where God overlooks
[1:21:08] all your sin and it covers for all your
[1:21:10] failure and never requires anything else
[1:21:13] because he's done it all for you that's
[1:21:15] not the teaching of Grace amen Grace is
[1:21:18] God by Grace giving you Faith to believe
[1:21:21] and by faith you're declared righteous
[1:21:27] not The Graces so you can live any way
[1:21:30] you want to live and you just say well
[1:21:32] he died on the cross for all my sins
[1:21:34] that's true but how do you know it's
[1:21:36] true you only know it's true if it's
[1:21:37] been unlocked by a seed of faith in your
[1:21:39] heart it's true for you
[1:21:41] it may be true but is it true for you
[1:21:45] it's Grace that gives us the faith to
[1:21:48] believe
[1:21:49] and it's we're saved by grace through
[1:21:51] faith and not not of ourselves it's the
[1:21:53] gift of God and we're justified by faith
[1:21:57] and the little Harlot woman who washed
[1:21:59] Jesus foot feet her all her sins were
[1:22:01] forgiven she was saved by what by faith
[1:22:04] how did you have faith by grace Grace
[1:22:07] gives me the faith to believe in the
[1:22:09] faith that declares me Justified with
[1:22:11] imputed righteousness
[1:22:14] and then my true genuine faith in God in
[1:22:17] his word causes me now to act out what I
[1:22:20] believe which is obedience to the word
[1:22:24] it's God's grace friends
[1:22:28] it's not just a all that's all covered
[1:22:30] no
[1:22:31] that's not the right kind of faith yet
[1:22:35] you can do whatever you want but preach
[1:22:37] great that's not that's not the right
[1:22:38] kind of faith yet
[1:22:41] the right kind of faith is recognize the
[1:22:43] word for our day and our place in the
[1:22:45] word
[1:22:47] once Sarah saw who she was and that the
[1:22:50] promise was her and there was nobody
[1:22:51] else and she was the one
[1:22:55] she had faith
[1:22:56] by faith she had strength to conceived
[1:23:00] before that no conception no conception
[1:23:02] no conception when she was young and
[1:23:05] strong and healthy and a virgin married
[1:23:07] to her husband and lived with her
[1:23:08] husband all those years no conception no
[1:23:10] conception no conception then she got
[1:23:13] too old and there was a promise and she
[1:23:14] doubted her part of the promise and
[1:23:16] tried to bring Hagar into the equation
[1:23:18] and then even when God confirmed the
[1:23:20] promise she still laughed because she
[1:23:21] saw it as impossible but when God came
[1:23:24] to her amen and gave her faith
[1:23:29] then when she saw herself as the pro as
[1:23:32] part of the promise
[1:23:33] she saw who she was she saw her part in
[1:23:36] it all
[1:23:38] then she had strength to conceive seed
[1:23:42] how by faith
[1:23:45] how are we going to how are we going to
[1:23:48] manifest The Life of Christ
[1:23:50] by faith
[1:23:52] how are we going to have strength Amen
[1:23:55] to produce the son of man again
[1:23:57] by faith
[1:23:59] how are we going to have faith by grace
[1:24:02] and if we're missing it he'll come to us
[1:24:05] why because he doesn't have a plan B he
[1:24:08] doesn't have a backup amen when Moses
[1:24:11] had run away from Egypt on the backside
[1:24:12] of Desert god went to Moses because
[1:24:14] Moses was the predestinated one
[1:24:17] he didn't have a plan B when Saul was
[1:24:19] persecuting the Christians denying the
[1:24:21] word and doubting and cursing amen he
[1:24:23] had to come to Saul because he didn't
[1:24:25] have a plan B
[1:24:28] and even when I doubted and even when I
[1:24:30] questioned he came to me because he
[1:24:32] didn't have a plan B for me
[1:24:34] and he didn't have a plan B for Sarah
[1:24:36] amen it was Sarah it had to be Sarah so
[1:24:39] he had to visit Sarah
[1:24:41] I'm so glad that there's a Grace that
[1:24:43] had to lock faith for me because I was
[1:24:45] part of the plan by grace
[1:24:50] faith is a mystery you can't give it to
[1:24:52] somebody else
[1:24:54] you say faith cometh by hearing hearing
[1:24:56] by the word but billions have heard the
[1:24:58] word and don't have faith amen the word
[1:25:00] is what faith is based on the word comes
[1:25:02] and unlocks Faith but you must have a
[1:25:04] seed on the inside to begin with
[1:25:10] many have heard
[1:25:12] the end time message and walked away but
[1:25:15] I can't walk away
[1:25:16] why because of Grace
[1:25:19] not into like Grace not effort not
[1:25:22] willpower Grace
[1:25:23] I can't walk away because he's already
[1:25:27] unlocked the mystery to me and he's
[1:25:30] already showed me this is you
[1:25:34] when he says bride he means you
[1:25:36] when the Bible says he'll have a bride
[1:25:39] with us about a wrinkle that's you
[1:25:42] and I just say Lord
[1:25:44] be it unto me according to your word
[1:25:46] I believe it now
[1:25:49] let me walk in it Lord
[1:25:51] praise God
[1:25:53] let's go to Mark chapter nine I want to
[1:25:55] lay this scripture in before we close
[1:26:00] I love this
[1:26:03] Mark chapter 9 verse 23.
[1:26:12] Mark 9 and 23 Jesus said unto him
[1:26:15] if thou can't believe all things are
[1:26:17] possible to him that believeth
[1:26:19] he's speaking to a man who has a child
[1:26:21] who's suffering from a devil that's
[1:26:23] taking him and throwing him into the
[1:26:25] epileptic seizures she says Thou can't
[1:26:28] believe all things are possible to him
[1:26:30] that believeth and straightway the
[1:26:32] Father the child cried out and said with
[1:26:33] tears Lord I believe help thou my
[1:26:36] unbelief
[1:26:38] oh I thank God
[1:26:40] that I believe
[1:26:43] but oh God help me in those areas of
[1:26:46] unbelief those Mysteries those things I
[1:26:48] don't understand in my current stupidity
[1:26:51] Forgive Me Lord
[1:26:53] forgive me Lord that when I say the
[1:26:55] wrong thing when I express the wrong
[1:26:57] words when I react the wrong way forgive
[1:26:59] me Lord I believe help thou mind
[1:27:02] unbelieve if you don't help me there's
[1:27:03] no help for me
[1:27:05] if you don't by your grace unlock faith
[1:27:08] in me and you don't help Faith grow in
[1:27:09] me and you don't give me a greater
[1:27:11] Revelation I'll never get it
[1:27:14] but oh God I believe
[1:27:17] help me Lord to believe more
[1:27:20] help me to believe it all
[1:27:25] I would like to end with this quote out
[1:27:28] of Crisis the mystery of God revealed
[1:27:30] that that's what God Christ is doing to
[1:27:32] the church see

[1:27:51] how how do you know because he's not
[1:27:54] letting anybody know the secrets of his
[1:27:56] heart

[1:27:59] he's not giving this to the
[1:28:00] denominations amen it's by grace
[1:28:04] by Grace he's letting the secrets the
[1:28:08] revelation of his secret made known to
[1:28:10] them by his grace
[1:28:13] if God has revealed to you the secret
[1:28:15] what was a mystery is a secret to the
[1:28:17] bride
[1:28:18] what is a mystery to the world is a
[1:28:19] secret to the bride what was a great
[1:28:21] mystery in the back of God's mind is now

[1:29:42] God when we see what you've done for
[1:29:44] your children in the Bible
[1:29:46] Lord we see him going the wrong
[1:29:48] direction we see him going in ways that
[1:29:50] look like they're running away from your
[1:29:52] word
[1:29:53] it looked like Moses were running away
[1:29:55] from the promise that was in his life
[1:29:58] but God you knew where to find him and
[1:30:00] you knew the time to find him
[1:30:02] in God when you begin to speak to him he
[1:30:04] expressed unbelief
[1:30:06] when you begin to tell him it was time
[1:30:08] to go back and deliver he resisted you
[1:30:11] Lord he he denied his place he he didn't
[1:30:13] believe that he could he thought he was
[1:30:15] unfit so much so that you were angered
[1:30:19] but oh God you never gave up on him and
[1:30:22] you never changed your mind
[1:30:25] when Saul was going wrong
[1:30:27] you went to him
[1:30:29] when Sarah couldn't believe you came to
[1:30:31] her when the disciples were disbelieving
[1:30:34] the reports of their friends
[1:30:36] you came to them
[1:30:38] and God when we were stuck in our
[1:30:40] unbelief in our confusion you came to us
[1:30:44] oh God we're so thankful
[1:30:47] and God if you can do it for us you can
[1:30:49] do it for our loved ones
[1:30:50] you can do it for those who have walked
[1:30:52] away you can do it for those who are in
[1:30:54] confusion to those amen no matter what
[1:30:57] they've done no matter what they've said
[1:30:59] Lord if they're part of your plan you'll
[1:31:01] go get them Lord
[1:31:02] we're asking God that you would go
[1:31:04] inject yourself go stand on their way
[1:31:06] don't let them go any farther but Lord
[1:31:08] make yourself so real to them that you
[1:31:11] awaken the seed inside of him
[1:31:14] I'm going I pray that you keep by your
[1:31:17] grace revealing yourself to us
[1:31:20] God we admit there's still so much
[1:31:22] foolishness in our lives
[1:31:24] so much stupidity so much of the outer
[1:31:27] outer man the flesh around
[1:31:30] but oh God keep coming and whispering in
[1:31:33] our ear give us the revelation of this
[1:31:36] word Lord
[1:31:37] let us have strength to conceive
[1:31:40] to bear this life within us and to
[1:31:43] manifest it through us
[1:31:44] for God it's all by your grace this
[1:31:47] faith that is required you have given it
[1:31:51] by your grace
[1:31:52] I'm so thankful Lord
[1:31:55] I'm so grateful Lord
[1:31:57] and I want what you've done for me I
[1:31:59] want you to do it for others
[1:32:01] I want to see others Lord we want it so
[1:32:04] bad for them but we can't give it to him
[1:32:07] we're asking that you would do what we
[1:32:09] can't do
[1:32:10] would you meet your people Lord and
[1:32:12] unlock the faith in their hearts
[1:32:15] help them to see with eyes and hear with
[1:32:18] the right ears
[1:32:19] they might recognize Lord what
[1:32:21] Generations before have longed to see
[1:32:24] the opening of the seals the revealing
[1:32:26] of the great mystery of God for prophets
[1:32:29] and wise men and church age messengers
[1:32:31] of all they have longed to see this day
[1:32:34] but yet by your grace we have eyes to
[1:32:37] see and ears to hear oh God we're a
[1:32:40] happy people we're a grateful people

[1:32:51] take full control of our lives and live
[1:32:53] through us now
[1:32:55] I pray God you would bless us as we go
[1:32:57] from here let us walk in this truth that
[1:33:00] you've revealed to us and may it become
[1:33:03] evident and alive and may we take on the
[1:33:06] reality of this as Sarah did who begin
[1:33:08] to speak your very word and begin to
[1:33:10] understand the conflict Lord
[1:33:13] and she could place your word right on
[1:33:15] the situation
[1:33:16] Lord may we walk like that
[1:33:19] knowing this truth and knowing what will
[1:33:21] and won't work in this day
[1:33:23] we love you God we ask for your
[1:33:24] blessings bless your people as we go

[1:35:24] do not know
[1:35:26] [Music]
[1:35:27] it's by grace
[1:35:31] [Music]
[1:35:37] Watch the Bride
[1:35:39] Watch the
[1:35:42] Bride
[1:35:43] in this in time she does not struggles

[1:36:07] down inside

[1:36:25] do not
[1:36:27] struggle
[1:36:30] it's my grace
[1:36:33] [Music]
[1:36:41] amen I was just thinking there's so many
[1:36:45] times that we've tried and tried to
[1:36:48] believe there's times when we needed
[1:36:50] healing we needed a deliverance we
[1:36:52] needed something and we tried and tried
[1:36:54] and tried to believe
[1:36:56] but listen trying to believe will not
[1:36:58] produce the right kind of Faith it's by
[1:37:01] grace
[1:37:03] what we need is a revelation in the hour
[1:37:05] we need a revelation of the will of God
[1:37:07] that's faith
[1:37:08] that's true Faith that's the faith of
[1:37:11] God
[1:37:12] Amen we sometimes read and read and read
[1:37:15] and read and we want to know the message
[1:37:17] amen but you'll never know the message
[1:37:19] by reading because that's an
[1:37:20] intellectual realm when you read you say
[1:37:22] God I need you to whisper Your Love
[1:37:24] Secrets while I read
[1:37:27] I need you to come interpret this to me
[1:37:29] in my Heart Lord
[1:37:31] it's not in Reading
[1:37:33] it's in the whispering of God while you
[1:37:36] read
[1:37:38] you can read your Bible all day long but
[1:37:41] if God doesn't unlock the revelation of
[1:37:43] that word amen it's going to be
[1:37:45] intellectual
[1:37:47] what we need before I ever read the
[1:37:48] Bible when I pick it up I say God please
[1:37:51] help me to understand this word
[1:37:54] because reading and reading and reading
[1:37:56] is only going to produce more religion
[1:37:58] and more confusion but I need him to
[1:38:01] come and Whisper the love secrets in my
[1:38:03] ear while I'm reading when I read the
[1:38:06] message and when I need healing when I
[1:38:08] need Deliverance there's a such a trying
[1:38:11] and such a pressing sometimes and what
[1:38:13] it does is it actually hinders the flow
[1:38:16] of God because all of a sudden we're
[1:38:17] putting so much effort mental strain and
[1:38:20] effort amen what we need to do is relax
[1:38:22] and let God take over
[1:38:25] we're trying so hard to produce
[1:38:27] something Sonic trying so hard to have
[1:38:29] faith trying so hard to understand amen
[1:38:32] but since when did trying hard ever
[1:38:33] produce anything in the kingdom of God
[1:38:37] the whole secret through the Christian
[1:38:38] Life is rest
[1:38:42] sometimes I I've talked to people who
[1:38:43] are trying to believe and they're so
[1:38:45] frustrated trying to believe but I'm
[1:38:47] telling you that frustration is going to
[1:38:49] deafen the voice of God
[1:38:53] sometimes what we need to do is just
[1:38:55] recognize that without him I can't do it
[1:38:58] unless he comes and gives me a
[1:39:01] revelation I'm not able to produce
[1:39:03] anything through my efforts and through
[1:39:05] my mental strain
[1:39:07] what I need to do is receive him
[1:39:12] open myself and say God I'm here
[1:39:16] listening for you to whisper a love
[1:39:18] Secret in my heart
[1:39:19] something I can't give myself something
[1:39:21] I can't do for myself but you've got the
[1:39:24] answer to my problem
[1:39:26] you've got the solution to my need you
[1:39:28] know what I need and I'm going to relax
[1:39:30] myself in your presence and I'm just
[1:39:32] going to read the word and enjoy you
[1:39:34] whispering and answering in my heart I'm
[1:39:38] going to read my Bible I'm going to read
[1:39:40] not straining and trying and hoping and
[1:39:42] maybe in this next chapter will be my
[1:39:44] answer
[1:39:45] but I'm going to rest knowing that you
[1:39:47] know where I'm at and you know what I
[1:39:48] need and you know how to inject yourself
[1:39:50] in the situation
[1:39:52] and I'm desperate for you but I can't do
[1:39:54] anything
[1:39:55] but wait for you to come and give me the
[1:39:58] revelation of the world
[1:40:00] God
[1:40:01] I'm receiving you and I'm open to you
[1:40:05] and I'm listening for you
[1:40:09] I pray I pray that God would help us to
[1:40:12] recognize who we are and who he is and
[1:40:14] what he wants to do in our lives
[1:40:16] and take away all the mental strain and
[1:40:20] pressure from pushing and pushing and
[1:40:22] pushing and pushing I know this has been
[1:40:24] my biggest problem in the past trying
[1:40:26] and trying and trying
[1:40:28] said God forgive me for that
[1:40:32] help me just to trust to believe and
[1:40:36] rest and let you come and do the work
[1:40:39] that you need to do in my heart
[1:40:42] God I believe help thou my unbelief I
[1:40:46] believe help me in the areas where I
[1:40:48] need to grow help me in the Revelation I
[1:40:51] still need to receive I believe reveal
[1:40:53] more to me
[1:40:54] I'm here to receive it
[1:40:57] I mean that's what we need friends
[1:41:00] we need this still Small Voice we we
[1:41:02] need the love Secrets the revelation of
[1:41:05] the word that he's whispering to his
[1:41:07] beloved bride
[1:41:09] oh may God come to us
[1:41:12] Maine reveal himself to us
[1:41:15] and may he give us Faith by Revelation
[1:41:18] to do what he's called us to do in this
[1:41:21] without him
[1:41:23] it's not going to happen
[1:41:24] without him it's not possible
[1:41:27] but with him
[1:41:29] All Things Are
[1:41:34] possible what are we waiting on him
[1:41:37] why don't you get up and do something
[1:41:39] I'm waiting on him amen
[1:41:42] the Temptation is always there to press
[1:41:44] the Temptation is always there the
[1:41:46] Temptation is always there to make the
[1:41:49] pieces fit when they don't really fit
[1:41:52] but if we'll just sometimes wait
[1:41:54] and rest and wait till the Love secret
[1:41:57] comes and all of a sudden oh it fits
[1:42:01] I didn't have to push myself into a
[1:42:03] revelation I didn't have to make it
[1:42:05] happen I didn't have to push myself into
[1:42:07] believing for healing I just waited and
[1:42:09] when he dropped a seed of faith it was
[1:42:10] over
[1:42:12] that's what we need friends
[1:42:15] we need to be his bride and let him be
[1:42:17] the bridegroom
[1:42:18] we need to be the wife and let him be
[1:42:20] the husband
