when we call on the name of jesus tell me who can stand before in the precious name of jesus victory [Music] blue [Music] [Music] yay [Laughter] [Music] [Music] get it [Music] blue hey [Music] blue [Music] blue [Music] hmm [Music] [Laughter] [Music] blue [Music] hey blue [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm not on an eco trip i'm nothing on my own [Music] i make mistakes and slept just come flesh [Music] i'm of a special kind for when he was on the cross i was on his mind look of love was on his face [Music] thorns were on his head the blood flowed down that scarlet road stained at crimson river and though his eyes were on the crowd that day he looked ahead in time for when he was on the cross i was on his mind he knew me thank you jesus yet he loved me he's glory makes the heavens shine [Music] i'm so unworthy of such mercy yet when he was on the cross i was on his mind he knew me [Music] yet he loved me he's amen [Applause] he whose glory may the heavens shine though i'm so unworthy of such mercy yet when he was on the cross i was yet when he was on the cross i was in his mind [Music] [Applause] jesus [Music] praise god he's worthy friends he's worthy to be praised let's just bow our hands before we read the lord jesus we thank you father we thank you god for the privilege that we can say that we're your children that from before the foundation of the world you've called us lord to this life you've placed us here by your own purpose you've awakened something within us to recognize who we are not as nothing that we did nothing of our own merit or ability lord but it's all you we acknowledge that lord and we just want to say with gratitude we love you lord we love you for your plan we love you for your wisdom we love you for your strength we love you for what you're doing in our lives and we pray that you would help us to stay yielded to that lord that we could stay surrendered lord it would never be us lord or our will or our wants or our desire but it'll always be you taking preeminence a greater preeminence day by day in your bride for god that is your purpose that is the plan you had before the foundation of the world to have a bride a preeminence and a bride to become a bride god i pray that you would help us lord today to hear your word may you come and speak as only you can speak nor may you break the bread of life to us lord that we may receive it as we read the word lord we pray you bless it lord as we preach i pray it'd be more than a man lord but the man would die and move off to the side and that you would take control and or that you would use the power of your holy ghost to minister this word to us that you would bring it to life inside of us we give you preeminence we love you we give you your place in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen while we're standing let's take our bibles and go to romans chapter 8. romans chapter 8. we'll read a couple scriptures there just before we're seated i also heard that brother joseph and sister rebecca benjamin are here this morning where are they at god bless you the new couple's here yep god bless you we're proud of you thankful for you being here you guys had a nice long honeymoon so we're glad that you're back praise god amen everybody make sure you shake their hands and say hi to him because rebecca's going to be moving you know out to new jersey and so i'm glad you came to see us again before you went to new jersey god bless you both i also want to remind you we have communion service today so we'll be announcing that at the end as well amen let's read this scripture and we'll be seated romans 8 29. romans 8 29 for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son it's my favorite part of that scripture you know we we want to be like jesus we want his life and us and we want all of those things and sometimes it seems like such an impossibility you know born in hybridization raised in laodicea uh tainted by the wrong thinking the wrong thoughts wrong teaching wrong training all of these years and we think it's somehow in us we can think it's an unsurmountable goal but when we're looking from the carnal side it absolutely is we're looking from our own ability there's no way that we'll ever attain to be like jesus but we're not looking at it from a carnal side we need to be lifted up on eagle's wings to a heavenly perspective and know that that let's read it again for whom he did for no that's me that is us friends he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son he predestinated us to be like jesus we've been predestinated to be conformed into the image of his son it's not our efforts it's not our will and of course we give all our efforts we give all our will but it's by his predestination that we've been we will be conformed into the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called whom he called then he also justified who he justified then he also glorified are you hoping to be glorified no i've already been glorified amen let's let's just have our seats amen i want to keep your place in this scripture don't lose it but i want to share with you a testimony real quick while we're seated i got a uh lengthy message from brother jeeva ratnam marlapudi you remember he's a our friend from india who was here with us last year and the year before that he visited with us and everybody knows him as the brother with the really hard name with the jiva rotten marlaputi and i practiced it for i don't know how many times so i could say it and it kind of rolls off your tongue nice now but you know i let you know several weeks ago that he had been diagnosed with coven 19 he and his whole family and the doctor had had said there was no more hope for him and that he miraculously made a turnaround well he just friday sent me this text and he followed up with a phone call but i'll read a portion of this to you i said all praises to our lord all praises to our lord for the lord healed me all glory and praises to the name of the almighty for he brought me out of the bed of death may the name of my salvation be glorified that he granted me the privilege to share with you my deliverance from sickness the lord is so merciful only his sovereign grace held me with his precious holy hands my health deteriorated dreadfully in a couple of days that the doctor said to my son to leave the hope but his love made me complete whole amazingly in a very short period of time that the same doctor astonished and admitted it is nothing but the miracle of god the same doctor told his son give up hope the same doctor who said it was a miracle of god i believe it is his grace and the precious prayers offered i heartfully thank you for the most important help which i have seen today that on august 19th you in church prayed for me especially your prayers are answered and turned my family from the drastic disaster to me to a tremendous testimony i write deep from the bosom of my heart i am very grateful amen i just want to share that with you because we prayed together as an assembly and god miraculously turned that situation around that the hindu doctor who said there's no hope said this is nothing but a miracle of god amen so i appreciate your prayers and continue to pray for our brother marla booty he's got some damage to his lungs from the coven 19. he's still suffering with that and the doctor said after a week or two he said he can he can slowly slowly start preaching that's how brother marley put him slowly slowly he can start preaching and then gradually work his way up so i know brother marla booty i doubt he'll slowly slowly start preaching so let's just pray that the lord will completely heal him restore his lungs so that he can continue to do what the lord has called him to do and then i'm going to look at this scripture in romans 29 and uh or i'm sorry verse chapter 8 verse 29 and then i'm going to look especially at verse 30. and verse 30 i want to go over this again moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called so [Music] he called you but he called you because he predestinated you and whom he called then he also justified and whom he justified then he also glorified now see this is a finished work from before all of these things are spoken in past tense it's not that someday we're hoping to move to glorification amen in the reality is we understand reality with a carnal mind we we are looking to a future glorification to live in a glorified body amend to come to the fullness of redemption but in the mind of god it's a finished work it's already done god's not wondering what we will do he's not curious about what we will do or where we'll wind up or or how things are going to come out in the end god already knows that he settled that before the foundation of the world we he foreknew us he predestinated whom he prayed destiny he called whom he called he had justified whom he justified he hath already glorified amen and brother branham teaches us about true justification amen in case you're wondering this is part three play sons part three uh but who true justification brother bam says is just as if you've never done it and brother brother baby even goes on to tell us he said you never did it in the first place the real you the true you you come through hybridization he said in no fault of your own now we've done things since then that were our fault i mean we've made mistakes we failed we have to repent to that but but coming coming in hybrid flesh was no fault of our own amen coming in a fallen nature with in a fallen condition was no fault of our own amen but back in the beginning in the mind of god the attribute of god the real us who we were intended to be all along amen that attribute never sinned to begin with it can't disbelieve it can't unbelieve the word i mean you can't disbelieve the word amen it believes the word it never failed to begin with amen and through a new birth amen you're awakened back to the reality of who you really are that seed that real you the true you from before the foundation of the world has sprung to life amen and he brings you to an understanding or a realization of the justification where with he's already justified you before the foundation of the world how can he do such a thing because in his mind he had a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world amen so we could be justified from before the foundation of the world but whom he justified then he is also glorified so praise god my glorification is secure the change in my body my position my future home all of that that is secure and brother vamp told us we read this quote where he says i'm not i'm not saying this to the the mess up doctrine i'm saying to straighten it out to get rid of this scare this scare that i'm not going to make it to scare that i won't make the rapture the the fear that somehow i'll fail and mess up and i'll mess up really bad on the day that jesus decides to take everybody home you know that's that's all denominational thinking that's all denominational ways of of holding people in fear and using fear and using human emotion amen to try to coerce people to live a good life and amen but we don't we don't we're not brothers that we're not reformers we're not here trying through a an aaa program or something like that trying to convince you to live for god trying to persuade you to to to stay true to the word of god and somehow through emotional mechanisms the to guilt you in or fear you in to living a life for jesus christ but no the gospel comes amen the opening of the seals comes to peel away the mystery of our life so that we know who we are amen to free us from bondage to free us from fear to free us from the works mentality that i have to earn something from god amen to deliver us from that so that we can be free to be who we were always meant to be amen it's a natural outflow of the soul and so brother brown came to dismiss all of that amen so that we're not we're not trying to to scare the teenagers amen and you know scare them to death you know you smoke that cigarette amen the lord could take us all away the moment you've got that between your fingers but i've sat through preaching like that when i was a kid you know you want to go out and you want to go run the roads and but you know if i'm predestinated if he foreknew me for destiny he called me he chose me he's ju he's already justified me and he's already glorified me and when you come into that kind of reality i mean not the reality in your mind but when that reality strikes that seed on the soul and comes to life you realize i mean there's nothing else i want of the world there's nothing else i want to do or want to have all i want is him the one the one who i belong to who i came from who i'm part of amen it just releases me to be what i've always meant to be amen that's why it's so good to understand some of these things we've i'm not going to make it i've already made it i'm just living out fleshing out what god once lived out and fleshed out for this time this portion in this time but also i like to look at this scripture in a way so we can understand what salvation really is true salvation amen true justification because those whom he's truly justified he is already glorified so it's not it's not like this you know you can have justification and and then you can maybe have sanctification and then the baptism of holy ghost but it all comes together to equal the new birth you can brother bam said you you can you can come to justification without sanctification he's really teaching us the progress through the church ages but but if justification we come to a place of understanding justification or receiving christ for our sins but never move on into sanctification my question is is that true justification we move into justification but we refuse to move into the baptism holy ghost was that true sanctification see for those who are predestinated those who he's saving out of this generation those who are part of his bride amen they're they're justified and they're already glorified so they never come to a place of justification and just camp out and sit there amen because in god's mind it's already finished they've gone all the way so when we justified them he's already glorified that's true justification true justification so we we know that god finished the work god did it all god's placed us god's got a plan for us there is no scare let all the scare go away and brother bam said the key to operating or living the christian life is rest right the key to operating every gift is rest amen the key to living the christian life is rest amen not always striving to be something but resting in who i am and trusting him to do whatever he wants to do with me let's go to hebrews chapter 4. let's read a couple scriptures quickly together hebrews chapter 4 verse 3 for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest though the works were finished from the foundation of the world so he's telling us to enter into this rest but he's saying but it was finished before the foundation of the world you know and sometimes i i don't want to misunderstand i think sometimes in the past i've had this misunderstanding of moving into rest amen because as you move into rest now there there's no more trying there's no more effort there's no more but that's not the way it was when the children of israel moved across jordan and they went into their land of rest their land of promise amen and he moved him in the rest he says you'll go in you'll go in there brother ben said that's crossing jordan it's a type of the baptism the holy ghost amen but you'll fight for every inch of ground so how can you move into rest but still fight amen and you know for me it's it's israelites moving from a people with no land a people with no identity a people with just a promise but no position a people who have a promise in their life amen but but no land no nation no homeland no territory amen and then slavery and in bondage and god brought them out from being a people with no position and no place was just a promise and then they brought him out of the bondage and slavery of egypt and he moved him over and he moved him into the promised land amen this is going to be your rest this is going to be your place of rest but there's no more wondering who you are when the promise will be fulfilled and what's our nation what's our land what's going on we already know all of that we know our position we know the word we know the land amen it's been given to us and yes you have to fight for every inch of it but this is our rest this is our striving it's the end of our striving to determine who we are whether or not we're a christian or not whether or not we're a believer or not whether or not we're a child of god or not that we're coming to a rest in the soul on those things i know who i am by the grace of god i know what he made me by the grace of god he's positioned me in this age he's positioned me in this body of flesh he's positioned me with whatever gifts and whatever abilities and whatever he wants to accomplish he did it he put me here and i'm resting in that am i still striving against yes i'm striving amen am i still laboring in the word yes we're laboring the word are we still pushing back the enemy pushing back to evil for us absolutely but in my soul i've come to a place of rest because of my identification i'm not wondering amen i've been i've been put back in contact amen with that mind that i was a part of from before the foundation of the world that can properly identify me and place me in the word so now we moved into the land amen not to not to sit down and take naps and not that kind of rest not to never try fight back an enemy not even not even the kind of rest where you don't even plant corn anymore or milk a cow anymore or build a house or cut firewood it wasn't that kind of rest friends we've moved into rest although the works were finished before the foundation of the world but we moved into a place of identification moved into a homeland into a heritage and a place prepared amen we've been identified at the end of the age of who we are we're not wanderers anymore we're not slaves in denominational bondage we've been brought out with a mighty hand and placed solidly into the territory of the holy ghost the word has been opened to us the territory's been expanded amen and now we're moving in that with a rest on who we are oh i i mean who am i my lutheran and my baptist i mean which one's right what should i be which doctrine should i align to we're free from all those wanderings we're free from all those kind of questions that we've been moved into a land a heritage acts 15 18 says known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world so all of his works but he does brother bram says he put himself on partnership with man he works in and through man so known unto god were all his works from the beginning of the world but for god to do his works now he's going to do it in and through man so if he's going to do it in and through man if i'm part of that plan and god's got a work to do in and through me amen then the things that i'm going to do he knew before the foundation of the world so i need to rest in him let's go to first corinthians chapter 12. i have a lengthy reading here but i want to lay this foundation down and then move on there's several things i want to get to and i don't want to miss any of it first corinthians chapter 12 verse 1. now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you ignorant you know that you were gentiles carried away into these dumb idols even as you were led wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed that's an interesting scripture no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed amen jesus we know that that jesus has a body on earth is that true and what's that body's name jesus and i just want to say it this way no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed in whatever form he comes in and whatever vessel he chooses to use wherever his spirit abides wherever he is no man calleth that speaketh of the spirit of god calleth jesus a curse that's why we have to be so careful how we speak about brothers and sisters in christ and that no man can say that jesus is lord but by the holy ghost amen now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same god which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for the one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these work at that one and the self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will for as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been been all made to drink unto one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the food shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the ear shall say be because i am not the i i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the hole were hearing where were the smelling but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as it had pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body but now are they many members yet but one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you name much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncommonly parts have more abundant comeliness for our comely parts have no need but god has tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lacketh that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one members suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members rejoice with it now ye are the body of christ and members in particular and god has set some in the church first apostles secondary prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles than gifts of healing helps governments diversities of tongues are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show i unto you a more excellent way though i speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not love charity divine love capstone love the love of god i am become a sounding brass or tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i can remove mountains and have not love i am nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing he went through great lengths to explain to us that we're a body and in that body not all members of your body have the same job they don't have the same office they don't function in the same way but yet we're very satisfied that each portion is there we're very happy that a finger does what a finger does and a toe what a does a toe and a heart and a liver and all of these things we're very satisfied with the way god has constructed things that every part is necessary amen in fact we give abundant more honor to that part which lacketh like if we're lacking something amen that's the part that we really would like to have if i'm missing an arm i would love to have an arm so so we've been fashioned this way we don't all have the same gift we don't all operate the same way we don't have the same administrations in the same operations we don't have all of these things the same way amen but but that's the way god designed the body of christ so that every member is a joint that supplieth but he says do all speak with tongues do all this to all but i i say covet earnestly the best gives but i show you a more excellent way let love be the motivation let the love of god and love of the brethren love of the bride of christ be the motivation for us to find our place and to work in our place it's not about a position if when i'm talking about play sons i really want to get down to it's not so much about a position amen as it is about the love of god he said what do you mean because anything i do i do for him amen any position he gives me i i give back any skill talent ability everything health whatever he gives me i give back to him because i love him amen i serve because i love him i'm not here to hold a position because i need a title or i need some the accolades that come with a title or a position or a gift or a calling amen i'm here to do what he calls me to do when he calls me to do it because of love and i'll give myself for the body amen because that body is him on earth amen and if i love him and i don't love my brethren then i'm a liar if i say that i love him but i don't love the brethren i'm a liar so i give my gift freely i give my ability my time my strength amen we give it to one another freely because of charity amen sometimes we see abuses they men of gifts people individuals with gifts and men and they they don't realize that gift is operated by love and the gift is not it's not a hierarchy you know it's not a it's not a system of ranks or degrees or stars or merits or or stripes i'm two stripes i'm a deacon someday i'll be three stripes and be a trustee four stripes song lyric you know that's carnal thinking we've got to erase that sometimes i wonder in the judgment of rewards i wonder if it won't be shocking sometimes and so i mean i think you know once we get to the judgment of rewards there'll be no jealousy there'll be no envy there'll be no strife there'll be no hatred because the judgment of rewards is for those who've been redeemed and raptured and their bodies have been changed so there's not going to be any of that but i still think it could be a little amazing when somebody who seemingly did so much upon the earth and had such a a ministry you know maybe a worldwide ministry or a gift to write so many songs or are seeing like like something and got all kinds of praise and accolades we're told all the time how wonderful they were doing serving everybody but i wonder if there may not be a shock at the judgment of rewards when the one when the widow who put the widow's might in receives abundantly overflowing way more than the one who appeared to be doing great works upon the earth [Music] because to whom much is given much is required amen so if you're given much in the way of talent or ability then much is required amen and now you can't you know some people in certain areas can do more with half effort than others can with their whole efforts but when it comes to the judgment of rewards amen god's going to judge according to the mode of intention of the heart amen and what he gave us and what we did with what he gave us and so i'm i'm i'm anxious to see the widow who gave the widow's mind or the brother or sister who spent hours in prayer and intercessory prayer for brothers and sisters and never nobody else knew about it on the judgment of rewards when christ heaps upon them rewards i think we'll all whistle and shout and rejoice because we'll see the equity of god amen we'll see the perfect judgment of jesus christ amen we won't be jealous we won't be envious we won't even be ashamed you realize that we won't be you won't be ashamed that she got more and you got less and he got more you won't be ashamed because you've come to a perfect understanding you've come to a perfect body hybridization carnality self-will self-love will be gone and you'll be like oh yeah lord that was good she deserved all of that give her more lord give her more give him more lord and when god gives you your portion you'll say yes lord i didn't even deserve this but thank you lord but sometimes i wonder when we get to that judgment of rewards they're going to be a true equity like we have never seen on the face of this earth a true judgment a true righteousness a true equity god will reward and so i i long for that i long for that i long i would long for uh me to be able to move away from carnality in a greater way to where i could just do things out of a pure heart of love i long for that in myself i long for the freedom to get away from uh from fear or worry about people's opinions or or or being misunderstood or any of those carnal things that trouble us in our mind i'd love to move away and just with a pure heart of love do exactly what he calls me to do whether it's noticed or not noticed with anybody ever knows it or doesn't know it whether it's big or small seemingly in our eyes whether it gets you know great recognition or no recognition where it brings back a great reward or no reward i just want to have a pure heart of love give exactly what he's called me to give and i know god keeps good records i'm not worried about that he'll take care of that i just want to give what he's calling for with pure mode of pure intention of pure heart brother bram said in the message influence he says we notice we got so many billy grahams today but you see god never made but won billy graham that's all and you just as you're just as important as billy graham oral roberts or any of those famous men you're just as important until you get out of your place and then you're no good at all [Music] i love that i'd like to bring this home but i'm not going to because i could start naming names we just talk about our brothers and sisters in the message starting naming ministers or our great singers or all this and i'll say you're just as important as brother so and so and immediately mine would go well i haven't done what he's done and i don't have a gift like that you're just as important as sister this or that and immediately our minds we start this judging and that's where we air jesus said you air judging yourself among yourselves measuring up to one another we don't measure up to one another we measure up to the word amen we measure up to the will of god as planned in our life amen in our ability to surrender that we do not measure up to one another an immediate i could name names if i start naming names i'm not going to don't get nervous you're like no i mean no that's a great but oh no that's an amazing system no so when brother ben says billy graham we get what he's saying but bring it home you're just as important you're predestinated to be conformed into the image of the son you've been predestinated unto adoption predestined to adoption what's adoption the placing of a sign a position that god had for you a work for you to do something for you to accomplish for his will from before the foundation of the world you've been predestinated unto placing a son to your position and nobody else can take that position said any of you he says you're just as important as billy graham or roberts any of those famous men you're just as important until you get out of your place and then you're no good at all you're a hindrance to those men and you're a hindrance to yourself and the kingdom of god stay in your position stay what god made you and see then you'll operate right as paul is not paul as paul it's not nothing new paul taught the same thing said if your hand shall say to the eye because i'm not of the eye or the ears say to the nose i'll no more be an ear because i'm not the nose or something you can't do that see it all fitly sets together and moves as one great union and we mustn't try to impersonate anyone just be what you are see and that's the way god made you you never fashioned yourself and remember as much as we ministers would like to take billy graham's place we cannot do it neither can billy graham take your place see we each one has something to do the common little fellow here and maybe a janitor the little woman that may be a housewife the greatest minister on the face of the earth could today could not take your place you god had a purpose in making you what you are and you just served god in the way that he made you see and i think if you would just do that the wheels would roll a lot easier yes it would if we would do that not and not get lifted up see it's not in order for me to really make progress my body's got to function every joint must supply and it doesn't matter how well my brain is working if my nervous system is not working with the brain if it takes a day off the brain may be fine but the body's doing nothing right white blood cells organ liver filters i mean how many people you think about your liver and the function it does on a daily basis but it wouldn't take very long for you to realize it took the day off two days off three days off and then you're dead so this is the example we have in the scripture and brother i was talking about this we the wheels would roll a lot better if we would just all stay in what god made us and stay with what god gave us and whatever he puts in our hand whatever it is it doesn't matter i mean it doesn't matter if it seems insignificant to you or i if he put it in your hand for you to do do it with all your mind amen do it unto the lord do it with pure love in your heart do it for your brothers and sisters and then the wheels will roll a lot faster let's turn to galatians i'm still laying a foundation galatians 1 doing a little review and then we'll jump into where i want to be galatians chapter 1 verse 13. paul's speaking here he says for you have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it and profited in the jews religion above my many mind equals in my own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my father but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb how did paul come on this earth by the will of mother and father by the will of god who separated him from his mother's womb it was god who separated from his mother's womb and when paul was doing all that paul was doing god knew all about it because it was god who had separated him from his mother's womb but he says but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me then i might preach him among the heathen immediately i confer not with flesh and blood so the whole point that i want to draw out of that is the fact that god knew paul's birth god knew when he would come on the earth god knew he would be the messenger to the first church age he knew he'd be the apostle to the gentiles he knew he'd be the enlightened to the gentiles god knew what where he was he knew what he was doing and he knew exactly in this program when to inject himself and pull paul out of that saul at that time he separated from the mother's womb and called him by his grace amen it wasn't paul's uh it wasn't his great ability in the jews religion that said oh god says you know that's a man i could use paul was ashamed of the way he acted before he was ashamed of how wrong he was and how he rejected christ and what he had done he wasn't looking at that looking back saying you know because i was zealous and i did all these things god says oh man that's a man if i can get him on my side he could really do something for me but paul had to go out and unlearn all of that and count it as dung so he could finally do something for which he was born and placed on this earth to do his gift was misplaced his efforts were in the wrong spot his zeal was was misguided but god was going to bring him back home by his grace not by paul's effort but by his grace brother beam says in adoption part 3 from 1960 and then god gave his children new birth by the baptism of the holy spirit they came right near it when they cleansed themselves up in the nazarene pilgrim holiness then came into the experience of pentecost at the baptism of the holy ghost the restoration of the gifts they went for speaking with tongues and interpreting tongues and giving gifts of healing and miracles and signs and wonders begin to accompany them now their children now their children they're god's children they're positionally in christ they become children by birth and the new birth and the conversion itself is the holy ghost so i say this to to back up on something i said last time uh i've heard it taught before that that that you're converted and you're saved and then you work your way up to the baptism of the holy ghost but brother branham is tying those two things together at the beginning and then you're a newborn babe amen amen and then you grow into adoption into a placing but you don't you don't you're not saved and converted you're converted when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost and then you grow into adoption you're not brother says you're not even converted till you get the holy ghost so you can't say you're converted without the baptism holy ghost how are you going to get the baptism in the holy ghost without the word without the message of the hour how will you get the baptism holy ghost how will you have how will you have the evidence of the baptism of the holy ghost without the word for your age how will you have a word birth without the word how will that word for your age wake up a seed for your age if you haven't heard the word for your age so you're not even converted till you get the holy ghost that's what the scripture said jesus told peter when now are converted so so i just want to reinforce that because i've heard it taught before and for years i i misunderstood myself because you can see things brother ben says and you can lean it this way and lean it that way he says it like this it says it like that but he's really clear on this point that the new birth your conversion is the baptism of the holy ghost and then you're just started that's not the finish line you just started you're a newborn babe in christ and you grow up in christ let's read it in romans 8 again romans chapter 8 let's read this scripture to reinforce this point romans chapter 8 verse 15. romans 8 and 15 for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit of adoption is what brings you into adoption you receive the spirit of adoption the baptism holy ghost a new birth and the spirit of adoption will bring you although it's the governor it's the tutor it's the instructor that brings you all the way into adoption to your place in christ jesus so let's read that again for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of god amen let that sink in deep now let's move on from there i've laid all these pieces together as a foundation i want to start building on of that today uh because i want to start talking about the this is a play suns part three but i want to start talking about the power that comes with position the power of your position and i don't care what position it is there's a power that comes with position let's look at the message influence from 63 now we find out though a good man blessed of god but if god blesses you stay in the category that god has blessed you in if it's a housewife remain a housewife if it's a business remain in that business reflecting god and whatever god has called you to let it be that because he wants you to be a real housewife to reflect your influence upon another person that wants to be a good housewife well he made it so simple i mean what am i doing here what am i you're influencing this is the message influence you're influencing somebody else's life amen just work in the calling amen give your whole heart we got to give our whole selves to the calling where we've been called so he says if you're a good businessman let your life so be that it will reflect jesus christ in your business with honesty and integrity and with the things that really mean something because somebody is watching your life you're influencing somebody god has to have a real housewife god has to have a real teenage in school god has to have a real minister a real businessman somebody that will reflect him because there they see in you christ no matter what the rest of the world has got to do that has not one thing to do with you or i we are responsible to god for our lives and for our experience with christ he goes on to say in adoption part three he says what am i talking about here at branham tabernacle you've had your chance when a man once is anointed with the holy ghost to be adopted into the family of god to be positionally placed by the father and set into a service out there into his purpose of life or what god is calling for his walk must be holy holy holy unto the lord holy holy holy oh you you must turn aside to this holy holy holy unto the lord oh you must believe all that elder said this but holy holy holy unto the lord let his word be first let it be everything that there is and settled in your heart your walk must be in the word holy holy unto the lord see when we're called and positionally placed we're called amen to take that position by the word like we said before you may have been married before your conversion but but before your conversion you were just trying to be a good husband trying to be a good wife you were just living by the world standards doing what you could to be good to one another but after your conversion amen then you're you're called to be a mental word husband a word wife a word mother a word father a word teenage in school brother benham going to realize if we could just look at ourselves as as as as doing what god called us to do completing his life upon this earth amen he he fulfilled in his earthly journey the portion that he was supposed to fulfill but he said he left a portion and that is to be fulfilled in and through the bride so there's a portion that's already fulfilled but there's a portion left yet unfulfilled that we in this life are supposed to fulfill and he wants to be known as a body he wants to be known in body form many member body form so he's got to have somebody that will take their place as a son not just the son of god but a son in a house under a natural father to be a daughter to be a daughter of a mother to be a daughter to show what a god daughter is like you realize he needs a teenage in school to show what jesus christ was like when he was a teenager walking 2 000 years ago he needs an obedient child at 12 years old that would subject himself to joseph and his mother so that so that this life this world can see what a 12 year old jesus christ was like because there's going to be a 12 year old on this planet that's demonstrating what the life of jesus christ was like then in obedience to a father why does it matter if i obey mom and dad because you're called to live the life of jesus christ in your flesh now and if you're a 12 year old and a 13 you're on a 14 wherever you're at you're called to manifest jesus christ at that age and when jesus christ was 12 years old he was subject to his parents when jesus christ was a teenager what do you think his life was like amen so now we're here in this life amen our position wherever he's put us wherever he has placed us wherever we're at in whatever age whatever gender whatever rank whatever file whatever job and occupation and status in life married single widowed widower retired working it doesn't matter what the title is this is a place that god before the foundation of the world saw us and he wants to be manifest through us in that position praise god and if that's god's plan if that's god's will amen then tell me what can stop that will some devil bringing sickness some devil bringing confusion some devil bringing strife can it stop that no that's god's plan see brother branham says in in questions and answers from 61 look what it puts me before when i'm up there before the public look at that what about one error on that see because i trust him i trust him someone say are you afraid to make a mistake brother branham no no i ain't afraid of a mistake i believe him he's my protection i'm ordained to do this so i'll stay right there you know brother branham what he was doing was risky calling a prayer line all the sick people in wheelchairs cots and all of this and they're asking are you afraid basically are you afraid that it won't work you'll make a mistake in discernment are you afraid you'll discern and you'll discern wrong and everybody out there will say oh he got that wrong he says why would be i be afraid i'm ordained to do this brother didn't put himself in that position he didn't choose it for himself he didn't make all the circumstances work out so he could be standing there he was ordained by god to stand there so he know it wasn't him the discernment wasn't him amen it was it was christ in him it was god amen working through his flesh he was so certain that he had with a seventh grade education growing up in kentucky finishing his growing up in southern indiana when nobody but the local people in the local town knew who he was ministering amen just a small ministry a revival just in his local town started a pastor in a dinky little church on the corner of eighth and penn street how did a man with no education no denomination no no coordination amongst ministers no financial backing how did he get a worldwide ministry with a gift of discernment displayed on a platform why would he be afraid he had nothing to do with himself being on that platform he had nothing to do with the gift of discernment if god's given you ability to sing amen and sing for his glory or to write a song or to preach a sermon or do whatever he's called you to do don't be afraid in that thing because you didn't give it to yourself god gave it to you if you can just surrender it to him amen you don't have to be afraid amen and i don't have to be afraid that that i'm going to sing this i'm going to mess up sing it for the glory of the lord [Music] i'm afraid i'm afraid to get up there and preach i'm afraid i'll trip over my feet i've done that enough that you should be fine by now brother branham did it enough we should all be okay with that see if god's called us to do something i mean if god if god has called you to be a wife don't start saying what if i'm not a good wife what if i may call you to be a husband what if i if that if if you're walking in the footsteps of the lord you believe your footsteps are ordained of the lord and if that's your next step take it with confidence if god's bringing a baby into your life and all of a sudden you've got turmoil about would i be a good mother would i be a good father am i able to do this if god has allowed it erase all the fear and say god has called me to be a mother god has called me to be a father god has called me to be a grandfather husband wife brother sister laborer a mechanic technic whatever god has called me to this we've got to let the scare go away because that's just the natural part of humanity will it be there yes but you got to push against it you can't just i mean you can't just be like well i mean i've never been nervous a day in my life i knew what i was called to then you're not a human being but you've got to push those things aside and say god called me to this i'm not doing this for myself you know so many times i think we lose confidence in what we're doing because we know our own selfish motives i worked it out i made it happen i got this and i strive for that but if we could just relax and let god take charge and you find yourself in places you never expected to be you find yourself and you realize the footsteps of the lord or righteousness or lord i didn't get here because of my skill i didn't get here because because i i'm so wise i saw three steps down the road and i mean plans i'm in this position because god put me in this wherever you are whatever family you were born into if you're a child amen if you're if you're a child living at home you're in the place god wanted you to be now you must live in that position as jesus christ would live in without fear oh because my family's this and my family's dad things won't work out god knows what house you're going to be in he separated saul from his mother's womb he watched over him waiting for the time that he was going to pull him into his commission you know god's not god's not worried about where you are your family status or or your educational status or or your whatever it might be god's not worried about that he has designed it friends he's allowed it things are permitted to be the way they are so that he can get the ultimate glory i said before i come from a broken home multiple breakings and re-breakings statistically i should have a broken home but god put me where i am there is no statistic for that you may have you may have breast cancer that runs in your family from great grandma to grandma i got three aunts with and that that has nothing to do with you you stay in god's position and you don't accept those things because god has called you i'm a daughter he wanted me born in this family that doesn't mean i have to accept all of that this is my position this is where i am and i'm not going to let the fear of those things torment me you say mental health runs in my family then let mental health run through the rest of the family but not through your you're part of that family you understand don't be fearful where god but you have confidence god put me here if god put me here to overcome breast cancer cancer then i'll overcome it if god put me here amen to overcome some emotional disorder or some mental disease amen if god put me here for that then he's going to have victory through me but he knows where he put me and i'm not afraid of where he put me brother brennan was born under into an alcoholic his father was an alcoholic he helped his dad make the moonshine and his dad kept trying to get him to drink you can't get a worse situation than that friends but god knew where he was god watched over his gift god took care of his seed see once we realize who we are when that's awakened in us all the scare goes away all the fear just subsides just fight it back god knows the path i take he knows the way that i take he knows the plans that he has for me he knows what he's trying to accomplish and i want to be i want to have faith and i want to be bold and i want to have confidence in the place he's put me i want to finish this quote from questions and answers he said are you afraid you'll make a mistake brother baby said oh no no i ain't afraid of mistake i believe him he's my protection i'm ordained to do this so i'll stay right there if god's ordained you to do something then he's your protection see he will protect you if he sent you he'll back up your word you're an ambassador then you're an ambassador with the gift of tongues you're an ambassador with the gift of interpretation you're an ambassador with the gift of discernment the three of you see see what i mean then what have you got you got a solid church see if god's called you then god will back you up you don't have to prove anything you don't have to convince people you don't have to you don't have to you don't have to put an army of supporters together amen if god has called you he'll back your word up god has called you to a gift he'll back that gift up as god has called you to an office he'll back you up in that office wherever god has called you he'll back you up in that i mean you there's all these things i mean there's there's so a part of our life that that we don't realize the natural things that we're called to are part of god's expression and sometimes we want to separate spiritual things from natural things but if you're a child of god how can you separate spiritual things from natural things there's no separation in our occupation and in our education and in our family life at home and there's no separation from the spirit of god from natural things because while you're doing natural things it's the spirit of god alive inside of you it's the seed of god that's sprung to life it's a portion of god himself living in this tabernacle or flesh how are you going to separate the spiritual and the natural well this is just my natural work but my spiritual work is you better make your natural work your spiritual work because in that natural world god put you in contact with individuals he put your life on display in certain ways there's certain things he's trying to get out of that situation amen people you talk to people who see you people who interact with you amen the way you carry yourself the reputation that you carry it's all god wanting to be on display so we got to quit separating and categorizing our life well this part is natural this is carnal this is spiritual this is my spiritual gift this is my natural gift make your natural gift your spiritual gift be a son or daughter of god and whatever you do said but i said are you afraid he's my protection he's my protection i'm ordained to do this so i'll stay right here i've i've heard people before you know they'll express they're nervous you know if if if their husband now he gets called up to be a deacon or a trustee or a preacher and all of a sudden the wife would become nervous but i don't know if i could be a preacher's wife a good a good preacher's wife i don't know if i could be a good deacon's wife well if you're married to that man and god called that man then you're a good preacher's wife you're a good deacon you're you're whatever if you're supposed to support that man amen and whatever god god calls that man to do then you are tailor made for that position have confidence have faith amen don't don't doubt where god has placed you because when we start with these doubts and these questions we start to pull back from what god has called us to do and what god has called us to be we start to question ourselves and our abilities we start to say things like i can and i and i can't well of course you can't that's good he can he'll never ask you to do something that he won't that he will not give you the ability to do let's look at first samuel let's go all the way back and look at first samuel i want to look at a couple examples in the scripture first samuel 17. first samuel 17 and 34. we all know the story so well but i can't help but read it and david said unto saul thy servant kept his father sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and i went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath defied the armies of the living god david said moreover the lord that delivered me out of the paul the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of the philistine and saul said unto david go and thy lord be with thee and saul armed david with his armor and he put put on a helmet of brass upon his head as he armed him with a coat of mail and david girded his sword upon his arm when he has saved to go for he had not proved him and david said unto saul i cannot go with these for i have not proved them and david put them off him and he took a staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had even a script and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the philistine see god called david as a shepherd is that right he gave him victory as a shepherd but now when the challenge of goliath comes david didn't put himself in that position and then god god anointed his dad he moved his dad to tell him to go take these cheeses and these breads and he goes up at the same time goliath makes his boast and he doesn't go out there and just run out and kill him he just starts asking questions real logical questions like why are you guys scared sorry i'm not supposed to say a scared that's bad grammar i was raised from people out of kentucky why are you so afraid what well i mean is there a reward for somebody who'll kill this guy and he gets put into a position by god god works all of this out he stands before the king and and and the king doesn't ask him have you ever killed a giant before because the answer is no how many times have you done this how many battles have you been in i mean how many times have you have you fought another regular sized person no but god put me in position as a shepherd and while i was in my position doing what my father told me to do a lion came in and grabbed one of the lambs and i smote him and took the lamb out of his mouth the bear came in then and i smote him amen can you imagine growing up and and all the brothers talking about how strong they are you know he's the youngest and all the brothers showing how big a rock they can throw and the other ones showing how much they can lift and how fast they can run and they're looking at dave and what can you do and david can't do anything to match them and they talk about oh if if i ever got a chance i could kill a bear i'd kill a lion can you kill a bear you know what the question the question is can you i'll ask you can you kill a bear can you kill a bear can you kill a lion the answer is yes if god's ordained you to it if it's standing in the way of your purpose in god you can kill a bear you can kill a lion david may not have known he could he may not have been going around saying i'm killing i can kill a bear and i can kill a nine foot man too see we don't know what we can do but we know one thing god can't fail whatever he's called me to in the position i'm in if there's a challenge that comes to that position then the god in me can overcome that challenge if it's sickness i mean if it's if what it doesn't matter what comes into our family our household as families amen mom and dad you can stand against it amen because that's your position it doesn't matter what spirit tries to move through dad you can stand against that spirit in opposition to that spirit you can defeat that giant of whatever that spirit is trying to come into your home because that's your position you may never have known that you could do it before you may not have known amen that you could lay hands on the sick and they'd be healed you may not have ever known you can raise the dead until you get to the position where the dead needs raised in front of you and you're the vessel gods chose to do it i mean we don't go around saying i can kill a bear i can kill a lion i can kill a giant i can raise the dead but in my post of duty if that's what god has ordained before the foundation of the world we can do all that more not by our strength not by our ability but just by being in the position he puts us in he brings us into circumstances and situations that there's no way around we just have to face it we have to have faith and confidence in where he's put us how many times amen how many times have we seen supernatural healings where a mother will lay her hands on her baby and pray for it and the baby's healed they may not always make testimonies we may not always write it out and put it up here because it's such a common occurrence what is it it's divine healing it's divine healing how many times does divine healing take place in our homes in a week's time how many times is an enemy a devil of whatever sickness you want to name a devil of flu amen a devil of bronchitis a devil of fever whatever devil you want to call it how many times in your home has a devil come to attack in your home and you stood up with your little sling shot of faith and you defeated that devil amen and it may never have made a praise report it may not be something you go and brag about because it becomes so much a part of our life that's a natural outcome what is it it's god on display it's christ in you i mean it's you standing in your position as a mama with a baby as a daddy with a family trusting in god i remember i've told this testimony before but i remember one time when our oldest daughter brandon was sick she had a lot of congestion and and post nasal drip and she had been through weeks of coughing weeks and she we could see her getting weaker darkness around her eyes she would lay down for a nap cough cough cough cough lay down at night cough and it was really wearing it was really exhausting we prayed and it seemed like that thing wouldn't move and we it's terrible when you see your little toddler getting weaker they're not playing like they normally play they're lethargic they're laying around and there was a day angie was home i was off at work late later down she's up there and she's laying down and all of a sudden starts that coughing and she's you could just see her little body jerking while she's coughing trying to sleep and we've been giving her benadryl just to stop the coughing so she could rest and and angie grabs the benadryl she goes to run upstairs and she's praying said god you can heal her why is she going through this and before she puts that first foot on the step something spoke in her heart and said if you believe me to heal her why are you giving her the benadryl and angie turned around and threw it in the trash can and she stopped coughing and never coughed since who else would intercede for that little toddler who else would implore god for that baby see you're not just a mother you're a mother of that child you're saying you're not just a father you're a father of that child you're not just a husband or a wife you're not just a son or daughter you're not just a brother or sister but you are specifically placed in the life of certain people amen and god is wanting to use you and i amen to do what we can do for the body of christ he wants to work through us david was a shepherd amen now when david comes to fight a bigger battle amen he comes now to fight a man now to fight a goliath and then saul tries to arm him and tries to give him armament he says i can't prove these and so what does he take he takes his staff shepard's staff he takes his bag shepherd's back takes a sling shepherd's sling amen what worked before will work again the way god called him is the way god called him he called him to be a shepherd over his father's sheep amen but he had been anointed to be king and now he comes up and he sees the sheep of his great father god and now there's a great lion roaring out there goliath rory trying to take god's sheep and what's he doing he's just doing the same thing he's always done and he's doing it the same way he's always done it trusting god amen trusting in his position he says that uncircumcised philistine what is he saying with that statement he's positioning himself he's uncircumcised i'm circumcised if i'm circumcised then i'm part of the promise of abraham the promise of abraham was that we will possess the gates of our enemy there is no way an uncircumcised philistine can defeat that promise of god what was he doing he was he was placing himself solidly in the promise in the word he he went to face him not as a great general not in full armor man not as a great soldier he went and faced him as a child of abraham under an abrahamic promising covenant with a circumcision as his seals the covenant and confidence that god will not fail to keep his word because i'm in my position there's a power that comes with being in position david had already been anointed to be king that thing was working in his life he couldn't stop it brother branham says in the 1957 on his india trip report so that's the same thing that took place in finland when i raised that dead boy you've read the story certainly that's right he's god he don't tell his servants all things but when he wants to use you he can put his hand on you take you here and do it if you'll just be humble and stay in your position don't ever ever try to find out what you can do for the kingdom of god just do what he's put in your hand and anytime he wants he can pick you up and move you anywhere he wants just be humble and stay in your position he can make more glory out of it than all the devil dabbling along you can do or i can do that's right abide in your calling and stay in there till god's ready to move you somewhere that's right 7 you don't have to turn there i'll just read it amon 7 verse 14 then answered amos and said to amaziah i was no prophet neither was i a prophet's son but i was a herdman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit and the lord took me as i followed the flock and the lord said unto me go prophesy unto my people israel praise god amos i'm not a prophet i'm not the son of the prophet i don't come from a lineage of preachers i don't come from a lineage of singers i don't come from a lineage of songwriters or whatever you you just attach anything you want to that i don't come from that i mean i'm just a herdsman i'm just an auto mechanic uh i'm just a i'm just a mailman i'm just a retiree i'm just a whatever label you want to put amos wasn't looking for a position he knew what his position was he was doing what god called him to do but when god needed a man to go and prophesy god knew where to find him amos wasn't running around out of position looking for something to do he stayed in whatever god gave him to do until god told him what to do just stay all this carnal denominational trying to fill roles fill spots and and and find good fits and uh forget all of that jocking for position or you know not that we do that but that's just a that's a denominational mentality just do what god's called us to do whatever he's called us to do i remember i used to be a technician for industrial equipment and i remember so many times i'd be working and i'd be working late i'd be working overtime this whole manufacturing plan is shut down and they can't do anything till we get this piece of equipment running a lot of pressure intense but this was what god gave me to do to support my family i knew this is the job he gave me i knew this was my position amen even before i would think about changing jobs i could get no liberty in my spirit to switch jobs and so many times i had no idea what to do but i would go i would go to get another tool out of the truck that i didn't need and as i'm walking the really what i need is to get away because i have no idea what to do and i'm going to go get a tool and i'm walking over there and i'm praying i'm praying the whole time what is that carnal work no that's my that's my work this is where god put me this is the mechanism he's choosing to feed my family at home amen this is my position this is my place i begin to pray god i don't know what to do i don't know how to fix this my family's at home it's 10 o'clock i want to go home i this is life i've been walking to the truck and get it go to get this tool that i really don't need and all of a sudden out of the blue i'll have a thought that says check that check this and i don't even know i mean why checking that would relate to the problem i don't know but i can't tell you how many times i'd go back and check that and that would be the solution to the problem was that carnal was that carnal work no i was in my position and i was asking god to help me because i was doing what he told me to do and god was supplying answers answers answers what was it it was it was carnal of course it was a manufacturing plan they had to send out so many 10 000 widgets an hour they wanted to make more money but for me it was more than just carnal work it was the thing god gave me as a son of god to do it was the thing that was in my hands and i had confidence that if i needed help i could ask god for help and god would give me help i can't tell you how many times he did until i got to the place where i would get raises and i would get promotions and i would get special jobs and special requests because they thought i was a really good technician and they wouldn't believe my secret weapon but my secret weapon is desperately praying out to god god i have no idea what to do would you help me you've all experienced it you know whether you're a a programmer or whatever you get into positions you're getting binds even whether you're trying to do a repair or a remodel there's things you just don't know how to do and all of a sudden out of nowhere the solution comes i ask you was it out of nowhere or is god intimately familiar with where we're at and what we're doing and how we're doing it i mean you hear testaments all the time you have a mother with a sick baby she doesn't know what to do she can't console it she can and all of a sudden she'll get an idea take it outside go for a ride and it'll be the thing that works where did that come from it wasn't the international journal of medicine but you can trust god to give you answers in your time of need you can trust god amen to put you in the right position wherever he's put you can trust god there is no carnal work for a child of god everything we do let's do it for him let's do it and obedience to him let's do it i mean let's do it to display to the world what would it be like if jesus christ was a mother what would it be like if jesus christ was an earthly daddy with children what would it be like amen how can we display that what would it be like if jesus christ worked in this office cubicle i'm in right now if he was a nurse if he was a doctor what would it be like amen if that's that's the way we want to live amen and if we're living that way for him i promise you he'll supply your needs he'll give you answers he'll give you solutions to your problems and sometimes he lets the problems come so he can give you the solutions so you have the confidence that you're where god wants you to be brother brahman says and god has a provided way so when moses threw his rod down and those fellows standing there with supersensory perception through their rods down done the same thing that moses done only moses was following the line of god and what happened there's nothing the man could do he fulfilled his duty when you do everything that you can do in the line of duty then it's god's business to provide a way god will provide for himself a sacrifice brother baby said god will provide himself a sacrifice he's taking right back from the words of abraham when abraham is walking with with isaac up to mount moriah to sacrifice his son his son says hey where is the lamb we've got the fire we've got the knife but where is the sacrifice he said god will provide himself a sacrifice why because he was walking in the line of duty he was obedient to god he didn't know how god would do it what he would do he presumed we pick up in the new testament he presumed that god would raise isaac from the dead but he spoke those faithful words god will provide because all i can do is what he tells me to do all i can do is what he's given me to do he's got to do the rest and god told moses to throw down the rod it'll become a serpent take up the rod amen it'll become a take it take it back up it'll become a rod he told him that he told him to show that sign to pharaoh but he didn't tell him what janus and jamborees would do he just threw it down it turned into a snake and then those two threw it down and they turned into snakes amen and all of a sudden all eyes are on moses like what now we can match your sign but there was nothing moses could do there was nothing he could explain there was nothing he could say well you know but you know mine's a little bit bigger than yours all he could do was hold still and he held still then it was god's duty to back that up because he did what god told him to do moving on brother said improving his word 1965 and we find out that joshua knew if night come they'd slip around and get with another and get their cells together and make another big army and he'd have a rough time with them the next day he didn't know what to do so he looked up to god he needed help and he needed that son to stand still so he just commanded that son to stand still said for moon you hang over agilent move until he and not move until like he commanded him and the moon and the sun stayed still for 24 hours when joshua fought the battle and conquered the enemy because he was right in the line of duty he had a right to do it because he was obeying god's commandment you think about what joshua did joshua stopped all the laws of nature whatever laws keep the solar system in motion and keep things moving whatever laws keep all that moving joshua just superseded all of those laws and took absolute control over the universe to stop the sun from moving but why did he have confidence in doing it because he was in his post of duty he was doing what god told him to do god said you go in there and you kill all of them and in order for him to accomplish what he had to accomplish he could not let that sunset right now because he knew they would get together and they banned themselves together with another army he needed more time when he needed more time something in him raised up enough faith to say moon you stand still sudden you don't move amen and it obeyed the voice of a man brother man says this this way and as long as you're in the line of duty keeping god's word doing just what he told you to do marching by the orders of god you've got a right to say to that mountain be moved god keeps his word if you say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have that what you said jesus said that in saint mark 11 22 that's the truth i know that's the truth it's god's word and that proves that it's the truth we're just afraid sometimes we get to a place where afraid he won't keep that word he will keep that word he said he would do it now we find now we find that's true he proved it i want to keep reading this and then the next quote it goes with this quote out of the message of paradox because the bible said here it was never a time before a sense like it that god hearkened to the voice of a man you say oh if i if i knowed we just lived in that day jesus said in saint mark 11 24 if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said still grace and the paradox on down into our age sure that moon and sun stood still until joshua fought his way through with israel and avenged themselves upon their enemy why it was in the line of duty now if you'd go out here and say mountain move i want to show you i can do it it won't do it but if it's in the line of duty when god has commanded you to do something like he said to moses why cry to me speak to the children people today is crying all the time lord what next what next just speak and go forward that's right god has commissioned us to do something let's do it don't stand around and think about it say how can it happen well this that makes any difference if god said do it do it anyhow he's still the god of miracles i like reading those quotes together because brother man said if you don't doubt if you're in the line of duty you've got a right to say to that mountain leaf but he says if you're going to say to the mountain move just so you can show that you did it he said that mountain will go nowhere if if there's any if there's any bit of self glorification involved you you can just might as well save your breath if there's any amount or self-justification ourself you just might as well save your breath you know so many times we want something to happen to prove to everybody else who we are we're looking for our own vindication but god vindicates his word he's not here to vindicate you as a human being he's here to vindicate maybe you as the word the word in you but he's not here to vindicate you as a human being so you can be some great person so you can be a super gifted this or that that's better than everybody else he's not going to do that friends that's the wrong motive if we've got that motive in our heart oh lord let them see let them see if we're talking about the winning of souls yeah let them see so they'll believe that's one thing but let them see for my sake see it's not about having selfish motives amen sometimes we see some miraculous things happen in private mountains move sometimes privately not for a show not not to be seen not for self-glorification but sometimes when we come against obstacles amen god begins to move mountains in our lives mountains and our minds mountains and our own our own consciousness begins to move things or even do supernatural things for us amen alone in the privacy amen of our own lives and the privacy of our own thoughts so that we can keep moving forward in the commission and plan he's moved us in not to make us a great person in the eyes of the other believers not to make us a great super something i mean the reason that he could do so many miraculous things through brother branham is brother branham was so incredibly humble that over and over and over and over and over again he could do the miraculous through him he could do he could do things that hadn't been written about since bible times and never in the quantity that they were displayed but the man was so humble and he had such a position god commissioned him through that and god was vindicating his word to that man but he was able to stay so humble he didn't get elevated by the miracles say god make me that humble that you can do something through me that you have the freedom to do something through me i wonder sometimes if our own pride and self-desire hinders god from working miracles in our lives because of what we would do with the testimony i don't want my attitude my selfishness my self-love to hinder god in any way but i wonder if god would like to move more mightily if he knew he had a people that was as humble as that prophet who would never take credit for it who would after miracle upon miracle upon miracle would get up in front of everybody and says oh i failed god corrected me the other day and i'm sorry for saying that about that brother see i sometimes i wonder if god's not desiring to show himself more and more supernatural ways but we haven't come to the maturity yet to handle it i believe in all the supernatural everything i believe i believe that i can walk on water peter did unconverted by faith if god ever if i ever need to in my commission in my calling if god ever quickens the faith to me i can walk right on water i can disappear and reappear 100 miles away amen philip did why can't i i believe i could kill a lion by grabbing him by the beard and smiting it i just never needed to daddy can you kill a giant yes i can kill a giant i just never met one that needed killing you see it's about being in position an imposition when god needs to show himself when god needs to vindicate when god needs to move when god needs a victory he'll allow the circumstances to work out where you get pinned in and you have no way moses got pinned in children of israel got pending they had no way but through the sea and he said speak and go forward he's going to do a miracle but they were in the po they were in the line of duty they were doing what god had called them to do amen they were they were hemmed in between the mountain and the sea and an army that was coming to kill them amen but god had already told them you will go over there and you will bring them back to worship on this mountain this will be a sign to you that i spoke to you you'll go get them and you'll bring them back to this mountain amen there was no seed no army no fire no flood there was nothing that could stop that word from coming to pass god moses was walking in the line of duty he was doing exactly what god had told him to do he was following the pillar of fire so in that condition god was obligated to move those waters away but me myself i want to live the kind of life were never secretly in my heart i'm saying move mountains so i can show that i did it don't ever want that attitude god root that thing out of me i don't ever want to hinder the plan of god because of me because i want glory i want a testimony i want to tell somebody everything that's happened in my life somehow you know we'll just say judas had testimonies healings and miracles and you know judas walked with the lord and judas had all that and judas was still lost you know i i don't want that i want god to get all the glory and say god help me to stay in my position faithfully humbly wherever you put me let me do with all my heart and if a giant comes up and there's no way around over i'm just going to say you'll take the giant if the mountain comes up and i can't go around and i can't go under and i can't go over then i'm going to believe that you're going to move the mountain because i'm doing what you told me to do david believed he could kill the lion not because of the strength in his arms but because he was the one responsible for that lamb who else was going to get the lion who else was going to get the bear who else was there to do it david was the one that's there to do it sometimes god puts us in position so that we'll be the one who has to move we're the one who has to pray we're the one who has to believe we can't go get anybody else there was nobody for david to get god put him in a position to where he was going to manifest himself through david and god is going to get us in positions friend where he can manifest himself through us amen but it's going to be when we're operating in our position in our calling where god has placed us don't get nervous when things start to become difficult don't get upset when impossibilities confront us if you're in your post of duty no matter what it is then let your faith start to rise because i'm doing what god called me to do this thing has to move i i am commissioned amen i'll tell you what sisters if you're a mother with little children to take care of and the devil comes in and knocks you off your feet with sickness you fight that devil and say devil i resist you in the name of jesus christ my family needs me right now what are you doing you're praying your position amen not lord make me better so i don't feel bad brother says you want to be healed what do you want to be healed for tell god the purpose what are you going to do with your healing why do you need a healing what is it in the kingdom of god that will be accomplished by your healing amen is it just because you don't want to be sick or is it because i've got a duty to perform as a mother i got a duty to perform as a father i need my health god i'm depending on you to move this mountain in jesus christ's name devil flee from me because i gotta get up and make supper my children need me my husband needs me my wife need me you understand confidence and position confidence in where god put me confidence in what i'm supposed to do what is it jesus christ as a grandpa as a daddy as a mother as an aunt as a brother or sister in christ it's jesus christ what can stand against him as long as it's him what can stand against him if it's you and i then you know we're pretty weak in our own flesh but if it's him and us who can stand against that if it's what he wants to accomplish in us who can stop it i'm going to skip over here i'm going to read this quote god doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him from 1963. brother bram says it was down in memphis where i met this little colored woman you know standing out there you heard me tell about it you know her her boy had venereal disease and she had this man's shirt tied around her head and leaning over the bench like that and the lord stopped that plane there and wouldn't let it go somehow and they told me come and get and the holy spirit said take a little trip and go down this way brother brennan was flying and something happened to the plane or a storm or something and he landed in memphis and he couldn't take off they had to spend the night in memphis so they put him in a hotel the next morning he's going back there's a certain time he's got to get back to catch his flight and when he's going back the lord tells him to turn right or to walk on or something like that and he looks and he's standing there looking in the store window at something the lord tells him to move on and he's realizing now that he's going to miss his fight the time's going on he's going to miss the time he's supposed to be there but the lord's time to keep walking and keep walking and keep walking he's getting further and further away from the airport and finally he just resigns himself to well i miss the flight and while he's walking he comes to a gate he says we're in the little shanty part of town there's a woman leaning over the gate with a man's shirt tied around her head he goes on with the story he said i went uh walked down through there singing i thought oh my my plane's about ready to leave i kept i kept saying moving on kept on going kept on going just the early part of my ministry i looked leaning across the fence there in that little bitty shanty little place there there was an old sister standing there she looked like one of these sisters on the aunt jemima pancakes great big fat cheeks you know and her hair her shirt brought him on back she leaned across the gate like and was singing that little song i forget the name of that little song but she was singing a little pentecostal shoddy song a little jubilee and i just quit singing i got pretty close and i walked by and she was standing there and tears running down them big fat cheeks i wanted to hug her she said morning parson i said auntie what'd you say she said i said good morning parson i said how'd you know i was a parson now to the people in the south that means minister you know said how i said now how'd you know i was in parson she said i knowed you was coming i said you knew i was coming i thought uh oh here it is see she said yes sir said did you ever read the story in the bible parson about the shunammite woman i said yes auntie i've read it she said i was with the eyes that kind of woman she said and i asked the lord to give me a baby and me and my husband and i'd raise it for him now lock that into your mind this woman had asked the lord to give her a baby and she'd raise that baby for him she said he did he give me the baby said i raised it fine boy said he got with the wrong company parson he got a bad disease and said he's laying in there dying he's been dying for about two days now he ain't even come to himself for two days the doctor man was here and said he can't live said he's dying it was a social disease he said i couldn't hardly stand to see my baby die and i prayed all night and said i said lord said eyes the kind of woman that shunamite woman was but said where's your elisha she knew what part she was playing she knew she had prayed for a baby and guarded miraculously supernaturally by his divine grace had given her a child and she promised to raise that for the lord and now she could position herself with that baby laying there dying and she said lord i'm that woman in the bible but i need an elisha and said i went to sleep and i dreamed a dream that i was standing here at this gate and i seen you coming down the street with the little hat kind of sitting on the side of your head but there's only one thing said said you're supposed to have a suitcase in your hand i said i just left it down there at the peabody hotel said i know that you were supposed to have a suitcase and she said my baby's dying i said my name's branham she said i was glad to meet you parson branham i said i pray for the sick have you ever heard of my ministry he said no i don't believe i ever did said won't you come in and i walked in she wasn't praying for brother branham she was praying for god and she says where's your elisha she had no idea this was elijah where's your elisha i walked in that big fella laying there was trying to tell her about i was trying to tell her about divine healing but that wasn't what she was interest interested her she wanted to hear that boy say he's saved and ready to go and god saved him about a year later i seen him out there as a red cap down on the station how the lord does things and then when i got back after that i was supposed and the plane was supposed to leave seven o'clock and it was about half past nine and i got a cab and i went back and i just as i got in said last call for flight number so and so and the lord held that plane on that ground there well i went and prayed for that boy see that's it he says in another place talking about the same story he says when i i left that home that morning i run out of the building i flagged down a cab and hurried to the airport when i got out there two and a half hours late they were just making the last call for the flight think of it think of it the god through the faith of a poor ignorant woman didn't know how to write her own name but her faith brought a plane out of the sky and put it on the ground if we can only be led by the spirits what moved god that was a woman in her god-given position imploring to god for the baby that god gave her who else would play pray for that boy i want to ask you who else were going to be praying for that who would intercede for his soul that wasn't just a boy and she wasn't just a mama she was the mama and that was her son you realize that was her position her position in christ she prayed for a baby for her and husband to have him she promised to raise it for him that was her position god had anointed her god had blessed her to be a mother and in the in the answer to her prayer gave her this son this son now was her commission it was her job given to her by god to raise this boy to serve the lord and she raised him she did her part she did her job she raised him a fine boy but after she did her part this boy got with the wrong crowd got a bad disease was laying there dying but now she goes all the way back to her original prayer that god would give me a son give me a baby and i'd raise it for the lord and god give me the baby and now she knows her position she is the mother she is a daughter of god she is the one god gave this baby to she is the one who raised it now she is the one who's going to she's pounding on the door of heaven she is pounding on the floor before the throne saying god i'm not shooting my woman you gave a baby to where's my elisha where's the deliverance for the soul of my son where is the fulfillment of the promise i've done what you told me to do now i'm asking you to do the rest see you're not just a mother you're not just a father you're a mother over a specific life a specific child you're the father over an individual who else is going to pray for that one who else is going to cry out to god who else is going to stand their post of duty and say god i want that soul you gave me that baby i raised that baby for you i'd done all that i could do i gave it the best that i could despite my mistakes despite my failures lord you know with all of my heart i raised that child to serve you now god what are you going to do there's a mountain here that's got to move there's something here that's got to change god i can't change it i've got no power to change but my faith says you'll change it because you didn't give me this child in vain you didn't give me this baby for no reason i didn't raise it to serve you for nothing but lord i'm standing here saying god give me that baby move that mountain lord bring conviction to their heart and bring them back who else can pray like that who else see there's power that comes with position god heard that mother's prayer and god brought a plane out of the sky because a mother had faith enough to believe the baby god gave me god will save she could see herself in the scriptures and she could cry out to god and say god i need an elisha oh praise god friends if that's your position amen then pray with faith in your position not hopelessness not helplessness but just saying god i did what you asked me to do now i'm asking you god in the name of jesus christ send the agent of the holy ghost out after my child and and bring them back lord there's power in our position there's power in what god's called us to do if we can stay faithful to what he's called us to do then believe believe that god will hear our prayer that god will answer our prayer brother bem says in the message super sign here he heard something coming up the road he's talking about shamgar here come a thousand philistines armored spear swords hanging at their side trained men trump trump right up the road they come little shamgar stood there what could he do he was a farmer he wasn't a soldier he didn't have nothing to fight with he looked settled in the corner and there was a ox goad you know what that is any of you kentucky not to know when you're plowing a stick that you punched the ox along with there was an oxycode sitting there in the corner and looked over there it probably had a little piece of brass on the end of it there to knock off the dirt off the plow and punch the ox along as they went along there he sat in the corner he stood and looked coming up the road he didn't have training time to go train how to duel you know how to use this ox code or sword but he remembered one thing i believe that he was a circumcised israelite he was the seed of abraham he had a right to the promise that he would possess the gate of any enemy amen both sides he told rebecca the same thing and abraham the same thing there he was the seed of that couple and he had a right to it for he was circumcised he was an israelite he was a seed of abraham he had the promise of god that he would possess any gate of any enemy hallelujah the spirit of god come on him and he took that ox code and slew that thousand philistines yes why because he had super strength and convincing and concerned he says in the same story you say brother benham i'm the least in the church i'm just a little bitty fellow but remember when he ascended on high see you were raised with him see we're talking about positional placing where is your position seated in heavenly places in christ jesus he goes on to say if you're the skin on the bottom of the feet every devil is underneath you i'm the lowest of the lowest i don't care if you're the skin on the bottom of the feet every devil is under you why because your position is in christ see when we're in our position we don't have to cower down we don't have to be fearful we don't have to be nervous we don't to be afraid if god's called me here and this is the obstacle i'm facing then i'm believing god to do a work of miracle i'm moving forward by faith i'm going on amen i'm believing because god said this is my wife this is my husband this is my child amen this is my niece my nephew my whatever my brother my sister i'm moving on in faith this is the job he gave me this is the position he put me in this is the calling we're with he called me i'm moving on by faith i don't care what the obstacle is i don't care what great big giant is standing over there boasting i'm moving by faith because this is where god put me i didn't put myself here god put me here amen and i'm trusting god to move me all the way through he said you're on the skin on the bottom of the feet every devil is underneath you that's right exactly the church whereas the head is the is the body is with it and if we were buried died buried in christ and we are raised with him in his resurrection and set in heavenly places in christ jesus and with and with in every fire of hell under us amen right no matter how little you are every devil is under you why our great conqueror has conquered every sin everything every sickness every death itself that's right we are more than conquerors in him only thing we're seated with him in his throne looking to him as he looks over the father that's it it's there all right shamgar had gotten enough of it he said i'm convinced that he's gone i am concerned with my with my family you know what he did he'd taken that ox code and jumped out there in the middle of the road and he slew 600 philistines what was shamgar a farmer you know what was more important he was the seed of abraham he was a seed of abraham farmer not just a farmer if you're a farmer you're a royal seed of abraham farmer not just a farmer and he was a daddy and he was a husband the man dramatizes the story over and over and over again he says he looks over and he sees his wife in a ragged old dress hardly a dress at all and his hungry little children over there ragged he said maybe this year we'll have enough wheat to put up that we won't starve to death this winter then he heard trump trump trump coming down the road what was the philistines coming they were going to take the last bit of his grain what he worked so hard for and he was concerned for his family he was a he was a daddy it was his responsibility to take care of them it was his responsibility to feed for them and provide for them to keep his wife and keep his children and he looked out and they were coming to take what god had given him he was an israelite positionally placed by moses and by joshua in the land that he was in he had a right to that land he had a right to the promise of abraham being an israelite a seed of abraham he had a right amen to possess the gate of every enemy and all of a sudden all this truth started clicking to him and when it all come down faith come to the surface and he grabbed what he had he didn't have to go become something else he took a farmer's implement and with a farmer's implement he defeated every philistine devil that was coming to take what was his david didn't need a sword and a spear david need what was it what his occupation was he was a shepherd he used shepherd tools to kill a giant event shamgar used farmer tools i hope you get what i'm saying you don't have to become nothing different to defeat the devil whatever you are you can use mother's tools father's tools to defeat every devil you don't have to be anything different you don't have to do anything different all you have to do is have confidence i'm seated in heavenly places in christ jesus no matter how low i go in the body of christ i'm over every devil that comes against me and all i'm doing in this life is what he told me to do i'm just abiding in the place he put me he made me of this and he made me that he made me a man he made me a woman he he he made me married he made me single he made me whatever wherever you are is where god's put you what else can you do but abide where he's put you and you don't have to move if i move to this i'll defeat that devil if i become a no god allow the devil to come take your wheat then you're the one to drive them out samgar also he didn't say oh man if i could go get a bunch of my friends send out a telegram if i could go if we could just if i could get some of the levites to come down if i could just find me the high priest if i could just go get a preacher no the the levite does what the levite does the farmer does what the farmer does the daddy does and when it comes he didn't need a priest robe he didn't need an ephod all he needed was a farmer's implement and faith in his position and he had to become concerned about what was going on and something in him had to rise up and say it doesn't have to be this way anymore see if we get out of position brother ram said you're no good at all in fact you become a hindrance to everybody else's position but if you'll stay in position you don't have to be anything different to win the battle to see the miracle to drive back the enemy all we have to do is believe in who we are and let's read this last scripture together first corinthians 1. first corinthians chapter one musicians if you can make your way up like if you can come on up first corinthians chapter 1 verse 26 nope i'm in second first corinthians chapter 1 verse 26 for you see your calling brethren how not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but god hath chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise and that god has chosen the weak things of this world to confound the things which are mighty and the base things of the world and the things which are despised as god chosen yea in the things which are not to bring them not the things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are you in christ jesus who of god has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it has written he that glorieth led him glory in the lord you can say i'm nothing special that's exactly who he chose not the wise he chose the foolish things not the wise not the strong not the mighty but he's chose regular farmers and shepherds and herdsmen amos shepherd david shepherd shamgar farmer if you read through the bible and you look at some of the most miraculous things that ever took place some of the most supernatural events there are times when god would inject himself into somebody's normal everyday life jesus came to the woman at the well when what was she doing she was fetching water to go cook and clean rebecca came to the well now the eiser met her there to have an encounter that would forever change her life i mean what was she doing she was going doing her part as a virgin in the house getting the water for the household what was moses doing when he met the pillar of fire he was hurting his father's his father-in-law's sheep and goats see it was the supernatural injected into everyday life somebody in position doing what they're doing and god found them god worked through them so many miracles so many miracles we read in the bible are common people doing common things and all of a sudden the crisis hit and god uses that crisis to work a miracle it wasn't always i mean there are times that that an angel would appear when somebody's fasting and praying and seeking god daniel was laboring in prayer when an angel came to him but so many times an angel came to them when they were just living their life supernatural injected just an ordinary routine common everyday life just doing what god called them to do doing what position they were in and when it was 10 come came time for the supernatural god did it or in the normal routine of life amen they come up against crisis they come up against disaster they come into great need in god through that amen through their position through them god works a miracle that gets noticed by all we want god to do supernatural things in our lives don't we we want to see god move in our lives we want to see amen every miracle amen that's available every promise that's in the book is ours how's he going to do it amen it's not going to be at a super duper camp meeting super duper this it's going to be when individuals in their position meet a need and god raises faith up by the word of god to take that land back take that one back take this one back and we'll see god move supernaturally in our lives don't look for somebody else to do it it's for us it's for us stay in position stay who we are and let god work miracles let's all stand amen i want to remind you communion we're going to come back here at 3 30 for communion also let you know that the fellowship hall is open and the pavilion if you'd like to use that i say don't ever disparage where you are in life i mean if you're not serving god disparage that but if you're serving the lord in your posted duty doing all that he's put in your hand to do then be confident nothing shall stand against you no weapon formed against you shall prosper how do you know because i'm doing what he told me to do nothing the enemy tries will defeat me nothing will throw me off course why how do you know your super strength no because i'm in the position he put me in this bride will conquer this bride will defeat it'll be every member
