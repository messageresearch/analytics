[8:13] past but we need food again amen
[8:16] we're here to hear from him let's take
[8:18] our bibles while we're standing and turn
[8:19] to john
[8:20] chapter 13.
[8:23] i have a little thought the lord has
[8:24] laid on my heart that i just want to
[8:26] express
[8:27] the way he's given it to me and we'll
[8:29] just trust the lord to lead us
[8:31] this morning in his word
[8:34] we'll look at
[8:35] the gospel of john
[8:37] chapter 13
[8:39] and i'm going to begin
[8:40] with verse 3.
[8:43] jesus knowing that the father had given
[8:45] all things into his hands and that he
[8:47] was come from god and went to god
[8:50] he rises from supper and laid aside his
[8:52] garments and took a towel and girded
[8:54] himself
[8:55] after that he poured water into a basin
[8:57] and began to wash the disciples feed and
[8:59] to wipe them with the towel where with
[9:01] he was girded
[9:03] this is bower heads and pray lord jesus
[9:05] we ask
[9:06] as we take this word lord and look into
[9:08] it
[9:09] i pray father that you would just break
[9:11] the bread of life into us
[9:13] that you would feed us lord on your word
[9:16] your fresh manna from heaven and may
[9:17] this word strike our hearts lord and
[9:19] bring forth fruit may we see what it is
[9:22] you want us to know in this day and how
[9:23] you want us to live and act and how we
[9:26] can represent you lord in this life we
[9:28] ask that you bless us now in jesus
[9:30] christ's name we pray amen you can all
[9:33] be seated
[9:34] we'll keep looking at this scripture for
[9:36] just a minute
[9:38] uh for a title i just wanted to title
[9:40] this our journey and i just wanted to
[9:42] talk about this this is uh not anything
[9:45] that's going to be brand new for many of
[9:46] you but it's something the lord has laid
[9:47] on my heart to share and go back over
[9:50] again
[9:51] but
[9:52] but when we look at this it says jesus
[9:54] knowing that the father had given all
[9:55] things into his hands and that he was
[9:57] come from god and he went to god i would
[10:00] say that's quite a revelation
[10:03] jesus had come to quite an understanding
[10:05] quite a revelation where he knew
[10:08] that the
[10:09] father had given all things into his
[10:12] hands
[10:13] i mean that's a position friends that's
[10:14] a absolute amazing position to be in
[10:17] where the father has given all things
[10:19] into his hands
[10:20] and he knew that he come from god and he
[10:23] went to god
[10:24] and when we look at revelation and the
[10:26] effect of revelation you can see right
[10:28] here in the scripture you have a
[10:30] revelation in the effect of that
[10:31] revelation and the effect of the
[10:33] revelation it says he rises from supper
[10:36] and laid aside his garments
[10:38] he humbled himself
[10:40] because you know
[10:41] uh
[10:42] you're we're striving in this life to be
[10:45] like jesus he was an example to us of a
[10:47] son of god and the son of god was the
[10:50] example and laid the example down for us
[10:52] and he had come to the to the end of his
[10:54] ministry here and he knew that the
[10:56] father had given all things into his
[10:58] hands he knew that he came from god and
[11:00] then he goes back to god i'd say that's
[11:02] a that's an ultimate revelation amen and
[11:05] that's the revelation in the end time
[11:07] the same revelation that god has given
[11:09] to his bride amen because she's a joint
[11:11] heir of all things
[11:13] whatever he inherits she's a joint heir
[11:16] with christ and we know that in this day
[11:19] he's called us for those that overcome
[11:20] to sit on this throne with him as he has
[11:22] overcome and sitting his father's throne
[11:24] and that we are a joint heir and given a
[11:26] position and that we've been given the
[11:28] revelation in this hour that we come
[11:29] from god and that we go to god
[11:33] and the effect of that revelation was
[11:35] not arrogance it was not pride amen it
[11:37] was not it was not puffed up he didn't
[11:40] go to build a kingdom on earth for
[11:42] himself amen the the very effect of that
[11:45] of that revelation was that he rises
[11:48] from supper and laid aside his garments
[11:50] and took a towel and girded himself and
[11:53] after that he poured water into a basin
[11:55] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[11:58] to wipe them with the towel wherewith he
[12:00] was girded
[12:02] that very revelation
[12:05] i mean it's amazing how the bible's
[12:06] written i always love how the bible is
[12:08] written it refers to the fact that he
[12:10] knew these things and as he knew these
[12:13] things he rises from supper and laid
[12:15] aside his garment and took a towel and
[12:16] girded himself and what did he do he
[12:18] became a servant of all
[12:20] the highest of revelations produced the
[12:23] greatest amount of humility the highest
[12:25] rev the highest of revelations brought
[12:27] him to a place where he would serve his
[12:29] brethren and he would serve his brethren
[12:31] who have not yet come to the same
[12:33] revelation he's come to
[12:36] boy if we could just take this attitude
[12:38] it would it would really deal with a lot
[12:40] of divisions that have been in the
[12:41] message in the past and finding that i
[12:43] have this revelation and now you have to
[12:45] come up to my revelation jesus didn't
[12:47] act that way jesus had the ultimate of
[12:49] revelations and the ultimate of
[12:50] revelations would give him the ability
[12:53] to condescend amen to come down to
[12:55] humble himself to unrobe himself to take
[12:58] a servant's towel amen to pour water
[13:00] into a basin and begin to wash his
[13:02] brethren's feet because he knows as much
[13:05] as he is the word amen they must be a
[13:07] manifestation of the word too
[13:10] and so what is christ doing christ is
[13:12] serving the word amen he is serving the
[13:15] word and and and and he was not writing
[13:18] them off for not having the right
[13:20] revelation i mean just just days before
[13:22] this they're fighting about who's the
[13:24] greatest in the kingdom i mean he's
[13:25] going to come to peter and peter has not
[13:27] yet caught the symbology of what's
[13:29] happening and the effect all around him
[13:31] and he's forbidding jesus to watch his
[13:33] feet i mean he's still immature he's
[13:35] still not to a place where he should be
[13:39] and jesus just washes his feet
[13:42] and he says what i have done
[13:44] you don't understand now but you'll
[13:45] understand later and i if your lord and
[13:47] master have washed your feet you ought
[13:49] to wash one another's feet
[13:52] this is why we have feet washing but not
[13:54] just for once a month to get our feet
[13:55] wet that's the symbology that's the
[13:58] that's that's the sacrament that he's
[14:00] left us so we can stay in the right
[14:01] frame of mind all the time to remind
[14:03] ourselves that we're here to serve one
[14:05] another we're here to serve the body of
[14:06] christ
[14:08] and so now we we see that jesus has i
[14:11] would say an ultimate revelation that's
[14:14] just my phrase that's not anybody else's
[14:16] but he has an ultimate revelation that
[14:18] god the father has given all things into
[14:20] his hand and then he come from god and
[14:22] he goes to god that to me is an ultimate
[14:24] revelation
[14:26] and in that revelation he begins to act
[14:28] with humility to serve the rest of the
[14:30] body the rest of the word with humility
[14:33] and patience and giving himself for them
[14:37] i say god that's the approach i want to
[14:39] have
[14:40] that's what i want more than anything i
[14:42] want that life of christ to be in me i'm
[14:44] so tired of old human natures i want it
[14:46] all to die
[14:48] and i want to serve god
[14:50] now we just started here because i want
[14:52] to talk about our journey for just a
[14:54] minute because this revelation that
[14:56] jesus came to was not only for him
[15:00] it was for the rest of the body as well
[15:02] and we've come to the hour where god has
[15:04] opened these things to us so that his
[15:06] bride can realize that she's come from
[15:08] the same place he's come from
[15:11] and i want to talk about that for a
[15:12] minute
[15:14] in the message the fifth seal when we go
[15:17] to the fifth seal brother bannon starts
[15:20] off with this prayer i'm just starting
[15:21] right at the beginning of the fifth seal
[15:22] paragraph one i'm just going to read
[15:24] this prayer to you it says let us bow
[15:26] our heads now for prayer
[15:28] gracious heavenly father the almighty
[15:30] god who brought again jesus christ from
[15:33] the dead and has presented him to us in
[15:35] this last day and the power of the holy
[15:37] spirit we are grateful for these mighty
[15:40] visitations of the immortal god and now
[15:42] father we are facing another hour an
[15:45] hour which might change the eternal
[15:46] destination of many people
[15:49] and to approach this lord we are
[15:50] insufficient because it is it is in the
[15:52] scripture that the lamb took the book
[15:54] and opened the seals
[15:56] o lamb of god come forward we pray we
[15:58] call on you lord the great redeemer come
[16:01] forth and show us your plan of
[16:03] redemption that's been hid through these
[16:05] years
[16:06] breaking this fifth seal for us tonight
[16:09] so brother branham now he knows what the
[16:12] fifth seal is because an uh angel came
[16:14] early in the morning and revealed it to
[16:16] him the morning of this day so he knows
[16:18] what the seal is and now he's praying
[16:20] and listen to how he prays he's saying
[16:22] lord you must come and break for us
[16:25] this fifth seal
[16:27] to show us your plan of redemption
[16:29] that's hid through the years breaking
[16:31] this fifth seal for us tonight father
[16:33] and revealing what's beneath that seal
[16:36] for us
[16:37] so he who's he's speaking to
[16:40] he's speaking to the gentile church
[16:42] is that right and he's speaking to the
[16:44] gentile churches gathered to the message
[16:46] he's speaking to the bride and he's
[16:47] talking about the fifth seal and he's
[16:49] saying lord break this fifth shield to
[16:51] show us your plan of redemption father
[16:53] in revealing what's beneath that seal
[16:55] for us so there's something beneath the
[16:58] fifth seal for the bride
[17:01] hang on hang on with me
[17:04] that we might go listen that we might go
[17:07] away better christians than we are now
[17:11] so there's something under the fifth
[17:13] seal for the gentile bride that will
[17:15] help them go away and be better
[17:17] christians than we are now
[17:19] it might be better fit for the task that
[17:22] lays ahead
[17:23] we ask it in jesus name amen
[17:27] so those of you who know the fifth seal
[17:29] and we've studied the seals and we know
[17:31] we know these quite well but under the
[17:33] fifth seal when brother ben begins to
[17:35] preach about the fistile he starts to
[17:37] show that this fiscal souls that are
[17:39] under the altar amen and they're crying
[17:41] out how long o lord
[17:44] until they'll avenge us of our blood
[17:45] then brother ben begins to break this
[17:47] down and he begins to show that the
[17:49] mystery under the fifth seal is that
[17:51] these souls under the altar are jews
[17:53] they're not gentiles they're they're
[17:54] jews they're crying out for vengeance
[17:56] and he says the the gentile church does
[17:58] not cry out for vengeance they cry like
[18:00] stephen father forgive them
[18:03] and he's showing that that this group
[18:05] under the altar and he says now they're
[18:07] under the martyr altar they're under the
[18:08] sacrifice altar and he says the they're
[18:11] the jews amen that the jews that have
[18:13] died from the time of christ on
[18:16] and he's showing that because they held
[18:19] the word of god and their testimony he
[18:21] said not the testimony of jesus christ
[18:23] but they held the word of god in their
[18:24] testimony amen they were under grace
[18:28] because their names were in the lamb's
[18:29] book of life
[18:31] and god had to blind those jews he had
[18:34] to blind them so that he could get a
[18:35] gentile bride because his heart purpose
[18:38] the heart purpose of god was to have a
[18:40] bride of his own choosing amen and he
[18:42] had to fulfill his own word he had to
[18:45] turn from the jews to the gentiles but
[18:47] because there was predestinated seed
[18:49] that was laying there and was going to
[18:51] come through that way amen those whose
[18:53] names were on the last book of life he
[18:55] had to blind them so that they wouldn't
[18:56] accept it because if they would accept
[18:58] it he would not have been justified in
[19:00] turning to the gentiles
[19:02] so because he blinded them because he
[19:06] forced a blindness upon them he is
[19:08] justified amen in acting in grace to
[19:10] give them white robes
[19:13] because because they did not reject the
[19:15] word on their own they were blinded by
[19:17] god so that god could fulfill his own
[19:19] purpose
[19:21] so we understand this this is the this
[19:24] is the the fifth seal the fifth seal
[19:26] motherboard says this is the revelation
[19:27] under the fifth seal amen and uh that
[19:30] that and they were given white robes and
[19:32] they said you must wait until your uh
[19:35] your fellow servants the brethren must
[19:36] be slain as you are and he's referring
[19:38] to the 144 000 that will be killed
[19:40] during the tribulation period
[19:42] and so he's laying all this out under
[19:44] the seal but remember there's a mystery
[19:47] under that seal a plan of redemption
[19:49] that that has something to do with us
[19:52] not just the jews
[19:55] i hope you can understand what i'm
[19:56] saying because the whole time brother is
[19:58] preaching he's laying this down it's
[19:59] jews it's jews and we understand they
[20:01] were blinded for us we understand that
[20:03] they're given white rose because of
[20:05] god's justice because he blinded them he
[20:07] can give them white robes and they were
[20:09] in the lamb's book of life they're in
[20:11] the book of grace amen they're part of
[20:13] the plan of god we understand all that
[20:15] but then there's something else for us
[20:18] and let's turn to second corinthians
[20:20] we'll lay this scripture in here
[20:22] ii corinthians let's go to chapter five
[20:25] lay this down and then we'll start
[20:26] moving forward we've addressed these
[20:28] things before none of these is brand new
[20:30] i just want to go over it again as we
[20:32] move forward here
[20:33] i want to lay this good foundation
[20:38] second corinthians 5
[20:41] 2 corinthians 5 1
[20:43] for we know that if our earthly house of
[20:45] this tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[20:47] building of god a house not made with
[20:49] hands eternal in the heavens
[20:52] for in this we groan earnestly desiring
[20:54] to be clothed upon with our house which
[20:56] is from heaven
[20:58] and there's a reason i went to this
[20:59] scripture because in the fifth seal
[21:00] brother better refers to this scripture
[21:02] when he gets to the end of the fifth
[21:03] seal
[21:04] and in the fifth seal he's coming down
[21:07] towards the end
[21:08] and he says all of that that i just said
[21:11] about the jews he talks about the the
[21:13] group that was persecuted under eichmann
[21:15] hitler and stalin those that come from
[21:17] christ all the way through this time
[21:20] that held truth to the word of god and
[21:22] their testimony they were true jews and
[21:23] they held true to what they had
[21:26] and then he says
[21:28] now my times exactly up
[21:32] so he's done with the physio maybe
[21:35] or he might just be done with the jewish
[21:37] part right
[21:39] my time is exactly up
[21:41] if i let out a little early but i got a
[21:43] few more little things to say if you can
[21:44] stand it i know it's hot and i'm
[21:47] sweating but listen i just got something
[21:49] to tell you it's so good it's just
[21:51] burning right in my heart i hope you
[21:54] haven't forgot it see let me say this in
[21:56] the presence of him by his grace he also
[21:59] let me see my people not long ago in
[22:01] white robes
[22:03] you remember you remember the story not
[22:05] long ago the gentile bride there there
[22:07] now they all was in white robes amen so
[22:11] brother bam is coming to the end of the
[22:12] fifth seal and he tells us all about the
[22:15] jews and all about the blindness and the
[22:17] white robes that will be given to them
[22:19] and a future tents and and he talks
[22:21] about their position and all that but
[22:23] then he says but there's something
[22:24] burning me up that i gotta get to you
[22:27] under this fifth seal
[22:29] now if i let out early but but if i got
[22:31] some more things to say if you just let
[22:32] me go he's not done amen preaching john
[22:35] was able to look over and he was able to
[22:37] see his group under the sacrifice altar
[22:39] but brother branham said god let me see
[22:42] my group one day amen i seen them and
[22:44] they was already in white robes amen
[22:47] they already amen had bodies they were
[22:50] already in a place they were already
[22:53] gathered together
[22:54] and he says just burning me up to get
[22:56] this i hope you remember not longer the
[22:58] gentile bride there there now they
[23:00] always in white robes
[23:03] and he goes on down in paragraph 445
[23:06] said notice the bible says if this
[23:08] earthly tabernacle of our dwelling be
[23:10] dissolved that's why i read that
[23:11] scripture he brings it up in the fifth
[23:13] seal if this earthly tabernacle of our
[23:15] dwelling be dissolved we have one
[23:18] already waiting that's where i seen
[23:20] those saints
[23:22] what did he see the saints he's seen
[23:24] them in their theophany bodies he's seen
[23:26] them in their body amen their eternal
[23:28] body he's seen it and brother benham is
[23:30] placing this under the fiscal because
[23:32] remember his prayer all the way back at
[23:34] the beginning of the physio he said lord
[23:36] show us your plan of redemption lord and
[23:38] give us something that we have need of
[23:40] now to help us know how we need what we
[23:43] need to do in this end time let me read
[23:45] that again because i just butchered it
[23:47] he said show us your plan of redemption
[23:48] that he's hid through the years breaking
[23:50] this fifth seal for us tonight father
[23:52] and revealing what's beneath that seal
[23:55] for us
[23:57] that we might go away better christians
[23:59] than we are now might be better fit for
[24:01] the task that lays ahead there was a
[24:04] great revelation there that brother
[24:06] branham is trying to show that that the
[24:08] bride amen but the the the the bride the
[24:11] gentile bride the predestinated seed of
[24:13] god already has a theophany already has
[24:17] a theophany body and he saw his gathered
[24:20] over there amen and there's a great
[24:21] mystery there that for us now that helps
[24:24] us to be better christians and prepare
[24:26] us for the task that lays ahead there
[24:28] was some revelation we needed at the end
[24:31] time for the task that lays ahead
[24:34] and we needed to know amen we didn't
[24:37] need to be stuck in denomination hoping
[24:39] someday that we make it and we're good
[24:41] enough and we've believed the right
[24:42] thing and accepted the right thing and
[24:45] by our accepting and knowing and our
[24:47] merit and the right church and the right
[24:49] plan of salvation that we can finally
[24:51] get somewhere but there's a revelation
[24:53] that we needed to catch in this end time
[24:55] to be better christians and we needed it
[24:57] now and we need it for the task that
[24:58] lays ahead and we needed to know that
[25:01] i'm not going to arrive i've already
[25:03] arrived because i have a body eternal in
[25:05] the heavens
[25:07] and i can't be the right kind of
[25:09] christian now in the environment that
[25:11] we're moving into and i can't be
[25:13] prepared for the task that lays ahead if
[25:15] i'm still under a denominational system
[25:17] of hoping someday i'll get to the
[25:19] judgment and find out i'm okay
[25:23] we needed something different in this
[25:25] hour we needed to know the plan of
[25:27] redemption in a greater way we needed to
[25:29] realize amen that i come from god and i
[25:32] go to god we needed to realize something
[25:34] more than what the denominations were
[25:37] teaching
[25:40] and i still say friends without that
[25:42] revelation we can't be the right kind of
[25:44] christian now and we can't be prepared
[25:46] for the task that lays ahead
[25:49] because things are dark amen things are
[25:52] not
[25:52] they're not getting easier they're
[25:54] getting more difficult and i don't know
[25:57] how much more difficult they may get and
[26:00] then short term long term long term we
[26:01] know they'll get more difficult yet
[26:04] we don't know how the cycles will cycle
[26:06] and
[26:07] and and how they'll ebb and they'll flow
[26:09] we don't know but we do know that
[26:11] there's a lot of prophecy that the
[26:13] brother venom laid down about tightening
[26:15] up and squeezing and persecution
[26:19] he laid down a lot of that as a
[26:21] foundation and we don't know what part
[26:23] of the cycle we're in and where and how
[26:25] all of that works out to the detail but
[26:27] we know one thing for the task that lays
[26:30] ahead we have to know this under the
[26:32] fifth seal amen that that i have a
[26:34] theophany i already it's already there
[26:39] i'm not hoping to arrive i've arrived
[26:42] friends amen and i arrived in the
[26:44] thinking of god before i ever started i
[26:46] had arrived amen i'm on i mean the
[26:48] redemption plan of god goes in a great
[26:50] big circle because eternity goes in a
[26:52] circle and i arrived when i was there
[26:55] with god before the foundation of the
[26:57] world when he was there alone with his
[26:59] attributes when he wasn't even
[27:00] worshipped as god yet i was there amen i
[27:03] come from god i go back to god
[27:08] and what about that god giving all
[27:09] things into my hands he's given it to
[27:11] the hands of my husband and i'm becoming
[27:13] one with my husband
[27:17] so i have no need of nothing
[27:20] amen
[27:23] so we see
[27:26] brother branham under the fifth seal
[27:28] when he got to the end he had something
[27:30] he just was burning to get to us
[27:34] praise god
[27:35] i'm going to read this again
[27:38] at the end of the fifth seal
[27:40] if this earthly tabernacle of our
[27:42] dwelling be dissolved we have one
[27:43] already waiting
[27:45] that's where i seen those saints see
[27:48] watch when a baby excuse me sisters for
[27:50] this plane talk before a young a woman
[27:53] but look when a mother has conceived and
[27:56] that little bunch of muscles is twisting
[27:57] and jumping you understand it is a
[27:59] natural body and just as nature is
[28:01] performing the natural body did you ever
[28:03] notice your wife before the little one
[28:05] was born she always right along at the
[28:07] last becomes real sweet if she hasn't
[28:09] been all her life
[28:11] hopefully she has been all her life
[28:15] if she hasn't been all her life she will
[28:16] be then did you ever notice how saintly
[28:19] or kind of a feeling you notice a mother
[28:21] and you see some sinner out there making
[28:23] fun of a mother that's a pregnant woman
[28:25] i think that's ridiculous that's life
[28:27] coming to the world
[28:28] but did you notice around the mother
[28:30] seems to be a sweet feeling what is it
[28:32] it's a little spiritual body spiritual
[28:34] life waiting to come into that little
[28:36] body as soon as it's born brother tells
[28:39] us that's a that's a carnal spirit a
[28:41] spirit of the world spirit of the earth
[28:43] that's going to go in
[28:45] now it's only begotten but when it's
[28:48] born it's born the spiritual body unites
[28:50] with the natural body
[28:52] and then the bible teaches that we are
[28:54] now begotten of god so brother branham
[28:56] is taking the same analogy to us that we
[28:59] now by the new birth are begotten of god
[29:02] we're begotten of the holy spirit that
[29:05] in us is christ the son of god being
[29:07] formed in us and when this earthly body
[29:10] is dissolved now he's talking about now
[29:13] the baby that was in the mother when it
[29:15] come forth there was a there was a a
[29:18] spirit of the earth a
[29:19] carnal spirit to catch that baby but now
[29:22] he's saying there's were begotten of god
[29:24] within this earthly tabernacle is christ
[29:27] growing
[29:30] a son of god is forming in us and when
[29:32] this earthly body be dissolved this
[29:35] spiritual body comes from the bowels of
[29:37] the earth now catch this
[29:40] this spiritual body comes from the
[29:41] bowels of the earth from what earth from
[29:43] this earth what is it it's a spiritual
[29:45] body something is quickened to life amen
[29:47] there's a new creation amen the sea gene
[29:49] of god has come to life and when this
[29:51] body is dissolved that spiritual body
[29:55] which is nothing more than your
[29:56] regenerated soul
[29:58] the seed life the seed of god come to
[30:00] life
[30:01] that spirit body comes from the bowels
[30:03] of the earth there is another body
[30:05] waiting to receive it what's that your
[30:07] theophany
[30:10] if this earthly tabernacle was dropped
[30:12] there was another body to receive it
[30:15] that's the bodies that brother branham
[30:17] saw amen those saints that were coming
[30:19] to hug him that's where they had went
[30:20] amen
[30:22] but what life did they take there amen
[30:25] they took the life of the zoe life of
[30:27] god that was in their soul that had been
[30:29] quickened to life by the new birth amen
[30:32] in that spiritual body when this earthly
[30:34] tabernacle dissolved that spiritual life
[30:36] went into another body and that was your
[30:38] theophany body
[30:41] he's still in the fifth seal
[30:44] this is what we need to know to be
[30:46] better christians
[30:48] amen to be prepared for this day
[30:52] if this mortal body i'm sorry
[30:55] if this earthly tabernacle was dropped
[30:56] there was another body to receive it
[30:58] this mortal body puts on immortality
[31:01] this terrestrial puts on celestial see
[31:03] what i mean there is a natural body
[31:05] that's sinful but in its making just
[31:08] like it is another body that we go to
[31:11] and i'm so grateful to god that i can
[31:13] say as your pastor and brother i seen
[31:16] those people so help me in that body and
[31:19] handled them with my hands
[31:22] this is a revelation to us under the
[31:25] fifth seal we needed to know about the
[31:27] jews we needed to know about how the
[31:28] jews were going to be redeemed god
[31:30] turning from the jews and blinding them
[31:31] we needed to know those things that's
[31:33] part of the plan of redemption that's
[31:35] part of the the seed that's in the
[31:36] lamb's book of life but there's a part
[31:38] in there that we need too under the
[31:40] fifth seal to recognize that we're not
[31:42] striving to make something we've already
[31:44] made it amen we're trying to surrender
[31:47] to the life that's in us to be formed
[31:48] into the perfect image of jesus christ
[31:50] we're not hoping to be something someday
[31:53] we're not hoping to make it somewhere
[31:54] someday we're not hoping to make it to
[31:56] heaven but if there's a seed gene of god
[31:58] birthed inside of me there is a part of
[32:01] me a body that this life goes through
[32:02] that's already made it in heaven it's
[32:05] already there i'm not trying to get to
[32:07] heaven there's a part of me that's in
[32:09] heaven
[32:14] and that's a revelation we need in this
[32:16] hour
[32:18] that's a revelation that we need to be
[32:20] better christians in this hour
[32:23] amen so that we're not tossed about
[32:26] and hoping and struggling but there's
[32:28] got to come a revelation of quickening
[32:31] to take all the fear and the scare away
[32:36] brother rem says in
[32:38] the rising of the sun
[32:42] and one day when i was weary myself
[32:46] i said if boy you'd better go ahead if
[32:48] you're 50 years old if you're going to
[32:50] do anything for the lord you'd better
[32:51] hurry up and do it brother brett was
[32:53] speaking about the same experience when
[32:54] he went beyond the curtain of time and
[32:56] seeing those
[32:57] those saints
[32:58] said you're getting old
[33:00] and there that morning the quickening
[33:02] power come and he let me look over the
[33:04] curtain of time and i seen all of you
[33:07] over there
[33:09] no i i i i'm not even going to try to
[33:12] explain that statement i'm just going to
[33:14] believe it
[33:16] he's talking to a group of living people
[33:18] on the earth
[33:20] do you believe that
[33:21] it's in the message the rising of the
[33:23] sun he's saying i was there amen i was i
[33:26] was i was saying to myself you're 50 if
[33:28] you're going to do anything you're
[33:29] getting old and he tells the story many
[33:31] times and he's caught away amen beyond
[33:34] the curtain of time
[33:35] and he said that and there that morning
[33:37] that quickly power come and he let me
[33:39] look over the curtain and i seen all of
[33:42] you over there
[33:44] he was talking to people who hadn't died
[33:46] yet but they were over there
[33:49] brother bam said it looked like there
[33:50] was millions he said there's millions i
[33:52] couldn't see amen i'm not going to try
[33:55] to explain the statement i'm just going
[33:57] to say what the prophet said and say i
[33:59] believe this amen i believe when he said
[34:01] it to that group i believe he meant it
[34:03] amen i don't understand it i don't know
[34:05] how it works mechanically but i know it
[34:07] works
[34:08] and i know it's true
[34:12] and i know that this revelation is what
[34:13] we need to be better christians and be
[34:15] prepared for the what lays ahead
[34:21] and we're gonna we're gonna read some
[34:23] things that support this statement
[34:27] brother bram said and who is this
[34:28] melchizedek
[34:30] he said then when a man is born again
[34:32] from heaven he becomes a spirit babe in
[34:34] christ
[34:35] and then when this robe of flesh is
[34:37] dropped there is a natural body
[34:39] theophany a body not made with hands
[34:42] neither born of a woman that we go to
[34:44] but a man called it a natural body
[34:46] that's really interesting
[34:49] because it's made in the fashion of this
[34:51] one only this one at your best 19 to 20
[34:54] years old amen in a perfect condition
[34:57] what god the image god had of you in his
[34:58] mind before the foundation of the world
[35:01] amen and he saw that he saw that body
[35:03] and he calls it a natural body because
[35:05] brother branham was always afraid to die
[35:07] remember he said i didn't want to be a
[35:09] spirit or a spook i didn't want to float
[35:11] by ormond neville and there i knew it
[35:14] was him some way of knowing it was him
[35:16] but he had no hand to shake his hand was
[35:18] rotten in the grave and then had no i
[35:21] couldn't hug his neck i couldn't say god
[35:23] bless you brother we would just be two
[35:24] spirits two vapers missed these are
[35:26] different ways he describes this
[35:28] brother bam didn't like that he he he
[35:31] he's always known as a man he's always
[35:33] interacted as a man and that's what
[35:35] brother ben was talking about now he was
[35:36] so happy when he over there and he found
[35:38] out there's a body in fashion like this
[35:40] one and brother man calls it a natural
[35:42] body one that you can touch you can
[35:44] shake you can feel shake hands feel it
[35:46] hug its neck talk to it see the face
[35:49] see the resemblance the facial structure
[35:52] amen have have visual recognition have
[35:54] understanding of who it is
[36:02] that's
[36:03] the mystery under the seventh or the
[36:05] fifth seal for us
[36:09] a natural body
[36:12] further in who is this melchizedek he
[36:14] says see
[36:16] he had become here and was part of the
[36:17] word he's speaking of samuel now when
[36:19] the witch of endor called up samuel he'd
[36:21] become here and was part of the word
[36:23] entered from the flesh life back into
[36:25] the body that had been prepared for him
[36:26] before the foundation of the world
[36:28] he entered into the theophany which was
[36:30] the word you get it that's where all
[36:32] believers go when they turn from here
[36:35] and then another paragraph down he says
[36:37] now notice praise god for these opening
[36:39] seals is my prayer to know these things
[36:43] brother brahma gets so excited because
[36:45] he says this lays under the opening of
[36:47] the seals this understanding to know
[36:49] these things what happens to us where we
[36:51] come from where we're going amen all
[36:54] about our journey in life that's what
[36:55] he's preaching on and who is this
[36:56] melchizedek so that we would understand
[36:58] our journey in life
[37:02] again in who is this melchizedek he says
[37:03] here we are formed to the word image
[37:06] to be a partaker of the word feed on the
[37:08] word by being predestinated since the
[37:11] beginning you see that little spark of
[37:13] life that you had in you from the
[37:15] beginning when you started your journey
[37:17] many of you can remember you join the
[37:19] church and join that church you try this
[37:22] and nothing satisfied that's right but
[37:24] one day you just recognized it
[37:27] and from here brother bam starts going
[37:29] to the story of the little eagle in the
[37:31] chicken yard he tells it over and over
[37:32] again this little eagle was hatched out
[37:34] under a hen and tried to act like a
[37:36] chicken thought it was a chicken until
[37:38] one day it heard an eagle scream and
[37:40] when it heard an eagle scream it
[37:42] recognized whatever that is i am amen
[37:45] there was a familiarity there was a
[37:47] sense of belonging there was an
[37:49] understanding that was in the scream
[37:51] that wasn't in the clucking of the
[37:53] chickens
[37:55] so brother man says one day you just
[37:57] recognize and then he goes right into
[37:58] that story then after that story he says
[38:01] then after you recognize the very word
[38:03] of god was eagle food then you left the
[38:05] other thing
[38:06] you have been formed into the living
[38:08] image of the living god
[38:11] by the new birth you've been formed into
[38:12] the living image of the living god you
[38:15] heard from your theophany
[38:18] if this body be dissolved we have one
[38:20] waiting brother bam goes through the
[38:22] same scripture that he did in the fifth
[38:23] seal amen he says when when you you just
[38:26] recognize it one day you heard an eagle
[38:28] scream you recognize it he said when you
[38:30] when you when you recognize the very
[38:32] word of god was eagle food you left the
[38:34] other thing then you have been formed
[38:36] into the living image of the living god
[38:38] you heard from your theophany now this
[38:40] is what i want to point to pointing back
[38:43] to what he said and it is the rising of
[38:45] the sun when he says i seen all of you
[38:47] over there because if you're going to
[38:49] hear from your theophany amen you have
[38:51] to have a theophany to hear from
[38:56] if you're going to hear from your
[38:58] theophany there must already be a
[39:00] theophany for you to hear from
[39:02] before while you're still in the chicken
[39:05] yard before your new birth amen when
[39:07] you're still confused about who you are
[39:09] when you're still in denominational
[39:11] system still eating meal worms and crack
[39:14] corn when you're still there amen you
[39:16] have to hear from a theophany that must
[39:18] be there while you're still here before
[39:21] you're born again
[39:23] [Music]
[39:28] so it had to be there
[39:30] to call to you
[39:33] you had to be there for you to hear from
[39:35] it
[39:36] and there has to be a way in which your
[39:38] theophany communicates to you
[39:41] and i'm not going to explain that either
[39:43] because i have no desire to get off into
[39:45] some some ideas of man i'm just going to
[39:47] say i heard from my theophany
[39:51] i heard from my theophany amen and i
[39:54] recognize when i heard from my theophany
[39:56] i recognized that this was eagle food i
[39:59] recognized that i was an ego i left the
[40:01] others and was formed into the living
[40:03] image of the living god i heard from my
[40:05] theophany
[40:07] so now you can see why brother branham
[40:09] can come to a crowd of people amen who
[40:12] have heard an eagle scream and have
[40:13] gathered to a ministry and they're
[40:15] sitting there and he said i've seen all
[40:16] of you over there they have to be over
[40:18] there amen there's nothing to hear from
[40:20] nothing for them to gather to if they
[40:22] didn't have representation in heaven
[40:27] these are just the words of a prophet
[40:30] we know that body is eternal in the
[40:31] heavens
[40:33] and that body is your body
[40:36] i'm not like i said i'm not going to try
[40:38] to explain everything because when we
[40:40] try to start explaining everything we're
[40:42] going to start arguments we're going to
[40:44] get into tangents and we're going to get
[40:45] something wrong amen because the carnal
[40:47] mind is trying to understand something
[40:49] so far above the carnal mind
[40:52] but i'm just going to tell you i heard
[40:54] from my theophany
[40:59] and without that
[41:00] all i would have heard was noise
[41:04] the chickens heard an eagle scream
[41:06] but they weren't an eagle
[41:09] so they ran and hid from the very thing
[41:11] that was calling out the eagle
[41:14] amen
[41:16] there was nothing in me to go and hide
[41:17] amen there was something in me that said
[41:19] what is that
[41:22] what is that
[41:24] that sounds so familiar
[41:27] amen
[41:28] that's
[41:29] that's what i've always wanted to be
[41:33] a real christian when we saw the
[41:35] ministry of brother brandon when we saw
[41:37] that life on display amen you can say
[41:39] that's what i always wanted to be a real
[41:41] christian amen like that a real one that
[41:43] believes the word a real one that stands
[41:45] on the word a real one that has
[41:47] manifestations in their life a real
[41:49] christian that's what i want to be one
[41:51] that's honest one with integrity one
[41:53] that stands on the word one that not
[41:55] back down for one iota that's what i
[41:57] want to be a real christian
[42:00] and this eagle may not even know the
[42:02] terms it may not even know how to
[42:03] describe it i remember whatever it heard
[42:05] was what it was down deep on the inside
[42:10] and i know that i heard from my
[42:12] theophany and so many times i think the
[42:15] mistake we make is trying to explain
[42:17] what brother branham was saying in a
[42:18] mechanical way
[42:20] and i have no desire to explain it in a
[42:22] mechanical way i just want to accept it
[42:24] the way he said it
[42:26] when he come to those people who were
[42:28] gathered to the word he said i saw you
[42:29] all over there when i saw the
[42:31] theophanies and i saw the bride i saw
[42:33] you over there amen and when you heard
[42:35] the eagle scream and you recognized this
[42:37] eagle food and left the others you were
[42:39] formed in the living image of the living
[42:40] word you heard from your theophany and i
[42:42] want to say that's the truth brother
[42:46] because that body is eternal in the
[42:48] heavens
[42:50] and it's
[42:51] waiting for me
[42:55] now i want to i keep moving because
[42:57] remember i'm talking about our journey
[43:00] jesus now in the beginning of our the
[43:03] scripture reading from when we first
[43:04] began this morning
[43:07] he
[43:07] knew that the father had put all things
[43:09] into his hands
[43:12] and
[43:13] he knew that he come from god and he
[43:15] knew that he went to god he had come to
[43:17] what i was just calling an ultimate
[43:19] revelation
[43:22] but that ultimate revelation
[43:25] gave him a certain conduct
[43:28] a certain attitude a certain approach
[43:32] and i would like to say the same thing
[43:33] is true today
[43:35] we saw it in brother branham
[43:37] did you see it did you see the ultimate
[43:41] revelation bring a response bring an
[43:43] attitude bring an approach
[43:46] an approach to people who disagree with
[43:48] him approach the people who didn't
[43:49] understand him approach who were more
[43:51] spiritually immature than him
[43:54] is that right
[43:55] we saw it we saw it demonstrated that
[43:57] was what that was part of the attraction
[43:59] amen for us it was not just the miracles
[44:02] the signs and the wonders amen that was
[44:04] to get our attention amen but there was
[44:06] a life amen there was other people that
[44:09] could do miracles maybe not as much and
[44:11] maybe not to the same degree but there
[44:12] was other men out there that could work
[44:14] miracles there was other signs there was
[44:16] other healings
[44:20] but there was something about that life
[44:22] that voice that life that was on display
[44:24] that was different than all the rest
[44:29] there was a son of god that had come to
[44:31] maturity
[44:33] and we heard that eagle scream and
[44:36] that's the life we wanted
[44:39] brother ram says in the message god does
[44:41] god ever change his mind about his word
[44:44] he said it started at the beginning
[44:48] when the natural and spiritual yet cain
[44:50] and abel worship the same god
[44:52] they both built the same kind of altars
[44:54] and they both worshiped the same god at
[44:56] the same church same altar
[44:58] but cain by carnal reasoning brought in
[45:01] the fruits of the land and laid them
[45:02] upon the altar as a sacrifice thinking
[45:04] that surely that this would answer to
[45:06] god for an atonement
[45:08] now i'm talking about our journey so i
[45:11] want us to back up because i i i started
[45:14] at the finish line because the finish
[45:16] line is the starting line i hope you
[45:18] understand
[45:20] where you started is where you finish
[45:22] so the starting line is the finish line
[45:25] so i had to start at the end because the
[45:28] end is the beginning
[45:31] now let's drop ourselves down
[45:34] now that which was part of god an
[45:36] attribute of his thinking that it has
[45:38] come now and was sown into the earth and
[45:40] now is is there in a human heart amen
[45:44] with spiritual amnesia not aware amen
[45:47] not awakened to who it really is but
[45:49] they're living a natural life in the
[45:51] chicken yard
[45:53] all right now we're all in the chicken
[45:55] yard
[45:56] the seed the egg whatever has been taken
[45:59] down and placed on earth and now it's
[46:01] coming forth and and trying to live like
[46:03] a chicken
[46:06] and he starts comparing this to cain and
[46:08] abel
[46:09] cain
[46:10] uh
[46:12] laid upon an altar of sacrifice thinking
[46:14] that surely this would answer to god for
[46:16] an atonement
[46:18] and i'd like to say any of us who were
[46:21] christians before we came to the message
[46:23] did this very same thing
[46:26] this wasn't just unique to cain but this
[46:29] is how i tried to serve god
[46:31] this was my approach to god trying to to
[46:34] do things for god trying to earn his
[46:36] favor trying to be right do right
[46:42] and he said surely that that this would
[46:44] answer to god for an atonement so he
[46:46] must have brought in as people think
[46:48] today apples that adam and eve took and
[46:50] caused them to sin and whatever i think
[46:52] now they got it down to pomegranate or
[46:53] something now someone said not long ago
[46:55] it was something else
[46:57] but abel had the right sacrifice he know
[47:00] that it was blood that did it so he
[47:03] brought a lamb
[47:06] and when god received his now abel by
[47:09] faith by revelation no other way
[47:12] there was no bible written
[47:14] so you see the beginning of
[47:16] righteousness is god's revealed truth
[47:20] i'm going to i'm going to read that
[47:21] slowly again so that we can catch it
[47:23] because for us we were going through the
[47:25] motions doing what the chickens did in
[47:27] the chicken yard trying to be a
[47:28] christian because there was something in
[47:29] our heart that longed for god amen your
[47:31] brother man said remember that little
[47:32] spark of life was down in there then
[47:34] amen you wanted to go to church you want
[47:36] to do that but nothing yet would quite
[47:37] satisfy
[47:39] some of us remember what that was like
[47:41] amen amen
[47:43] and trying and going about and doing
[47:45] like the rest of them do and make things
[47:47] nice and do good works and all of this
[47:49] but nothing would satisfy until
[47:51] something you heard amen you heard a
[47:53] word and there was a revelation that
[47:54] clicked in your heart and said this is
[47:56] it
[47:58] and abel was waiting upon god he had no
[48:01] bible to read amen
[48:04] he had no bible to read he had no church
[48:06] to follow amen he was waiting on god for
[48:08] the proper way of worship and god gave
[48:10] him the proper way of worship he gave
[48:12] him a revelation of what really took
[48:14] place in the garden of eden and he knew
[48:16] that it was blood and it would only take
[48:18] a blood of an innocent one to atone for
[48:20] his sins and so when god received his
[48:23] now able by faith by revelation no other
[48:26] way there was no bible written so you
[48:28] see the beginning of righteousness is
[48:31] god's revealed truth
[48:35] the beginning of righteousness is god's
[48:37] revealed truth amen they were sown in
[48:40] unrighteousness amen they were born
[48:42] wrong there was a fall in the garden
[48:43] they were cast out of the garden but the
[48:45] beginning of righteousness was god's
[48:46] revealed truth amen
[48:49] and the entire church of the living god
[48:52] is built upon that amen
[48:54] upon that upon what upon upon the the
[48:58] god's revealed truth that's the
[49:00] beginning of righteousness and for us
[49:02] when we were out living however we were
[49:04] living unaware of what was the truth
[49:06] amen but when we heard the truth and
[49:08] something resonated in us we came to it
[49:10] for us that was the beginning of our
[49:12] righteousness
[49:15] let's go to hebrews chapter 11.
[49:22] hebrews chapter 11.
[49:29] we know these things quite well but
[49:31] it's good for us to rehearse these
[49:34] hebrews 11 4 by faith abel offered in
[49:36] god a more excellent sacrifice than cain
[49:39] by which he obtained witness that he was
[49:41] righteous
[49:43] that
[49:44] the right revelation
[49:47] acted upon was evidence that he was
[49:50] righteous
[49:53] listen
[49:54] this is amazing
[49:57] no bible
[49:58] no church to follow
[50:00] amen but he caught the right revelation
[50:03] and that rock revelation when he acted
[50:05] upon that revelation it showed that he
[50:09] was righteous
[50:14] god testifying of his gifts and by it he
[50:16] being dead yet speaketh
[50:19] so let's take that to ourselves friends
[50:22] because really we we were born no
[50:26] different than anybody else right you
[50:28] come of a father and a mother you were
[50:30] born and some of us were born into all
[50:32] kinds of different situations we were
[50:34] born into good homes bad homes broken
[50:36] homes homes that were intact we we were
[50:38] born to parents who loved us parents who
[50:40] didn't maybe love us we were born into a
[50:42] safe home or an abusive home
[50:44] we all come the way the world comes you
[50:47] understand i mean it's not exclusive
[50:49] just to the world and just you know the
[50:50] bride always comes nice no we come to
[50:52] this world like everybody else comes to
[50:54] this world amen
[50:56] and when we come to this world amen
[50:59] there's there's what is the separating
[51:02] factor amen amen there's there's seeds
[51:04] sown into the earth some of these babies
[51:07] that were born amen have a sea gene of
[51:09] god inside and some do not and what's
[51:11] the separating factor friends what is
[51:13] going to prove where righteousness
[51:15] really lays amen it's going to be the
[51:17] ability to catch revelation and act upon
[51:20] it
[51:21] that was the beginning of righteousness
[51:23] all the way back in the beginning and it
[51:24] is still the same thing today god is not
[51:27] changing his ways amen his ways yet
[51:30] remain the same there is an ability in
[51:32] the sieging of god the children of god
[51:34] to catch revelation from god and to act
[51:37] upon that revelation and when they act
[51:39] upon that revelation it's a testimony
[51:41] that they are righteous
[51:46] god ever keeps his plan the same he ever
[51:49] remains the same from the beginning of
[51:50] the book to the end of the book he
[51:52] remains the same
[51:55] let's go to romans chapter 4.
[52:12] romans chapter 4
[52:15] let's look at verse 16.
[52:21] therefore it is of faith that it might
[52:22] be by grace
[52:24] to the end the promise might be sure to
[52:26] all the seed not that only which is of
[52:28] the law but that also which is of the
[52:30] faith of abraham who is the father of us
[52:32] all so god was going to make the
[52:34] requirement faith so that it could be by
[52:37] grace
[52:38] so that he could give it to the seed to
[52:40] make sure the promise would be sure to
[52:42] the seed of god through the seed of the
[52:44] faith seed he had to make it by faith
[52:47] amen so it could only be apprehended by
[52:49] faith because only the seed of god had
[52:51] the faith to believe in the revealed
[52:53] word of god
[52:55] so that it could be by grace he made it
[52:57] by faith that it could be by grace
[53:00] so that the promise would be sure to
[53:02] deceive verse 18 who would get
[53:06] well let me finish reading 16 sorry the
[53:08] faith of abraham who is the father of us
[53:10] all 17 as it is written i have made thee
[53:12] a father of many nations before him whom
[53:15] he believed even god who quickeneth the
[53:17] dead and calleth those things which be
[53:19] not as though they were who against hope
[53:22] believed in hope that he might become
[53:23] the father of many nations according to
[53:26] that which was spoken so shall thy seed
[53:28] be
[53:29] and being not weak in faith he
[53:31] considered not his own body now dead
[53:33] when he was about a hundred years old
[53:35] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[53:37] he staggered not at the promise of god
[53:39] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[53:41] giving giving glory to god and being
[53:44] fully persuaded that what he had
[53:46] promised he was able also to perform and
[53:48] therefore was imputed to him for
[53:50] righteousness
[53:52] what was imputed to him what was put on
[53:54] him for righteousness the fact that he
[53:56] believed that god would do what he said
[53:57] he would do
[53:59] the fact that no matter how weak sarah
[54:01] got how weak he got how long it took he
[54:03] didn't grow weak through unbelief but he
[54:05] grows strong in the faith amen and it
[54:07] was imputed unto him for righteousness
[54:09] it was put on him for his righteousness
[54:11] that he believed god
[54:16] see god's not changing his ways we are
[54:18] children of abraham by faith amen and
[54:21] god is doing the same thing for us
[54:24] let me keep reading now
[54:26] verse 22 and therefore it was puted unto
[54:28] him for righteousness now it was not
[54:30] written for his sake alone that it was
[54:32] imputed to him but for us also to whom
[54:34] it shall be imputed if we believe on him
[54:37] that raised up jesus our lord from the
[54:39] dead who was delivered for our offenses
[54:42] and was raised again for our
[54:43] justification so this isn't just a
[54:46] special
[54:47] uh appointment or imputation for abraham
[54:50] so abraham believed so abraham believed
[54:54] god he believed that what god said god
[54:56] was able to do no matter what the
[54:58] circumstances or what the time frame was
[55:00] he was still capable of believing god
[55:02] and that was imputed unto him for
[55:04] righteousness it declared that he was
[55:06] righteous
[55:08] so now if i want to be like abraham i
[55:11] have to believe that god was going to
[55:13] give abraham a young body or give
[55:15] abraham a seed and
[55:17] you understand that was the promise for
[55:19] abraham's day
[55:21] and abraham believed the promise for his
[55:23] day what god spoke in his day and it was
[55:25] imputed unto him for righteousness it
[55:27] was a declaration that he was righteous
[55:29] amen but i can believe what god did in
[55:32] abraham's day amen but for me to have
[55:35] righteousness imputed unto me i must
[55:37] believe the word that's given to me
[55:39] today
[55:42] billions believe what abraham believed
[55:45] because it's already happened amen
[55:48] billions believe that that abraham had a
[55:50] son in his old age and that son was
[55:52] isaac and he became a father of many
[55:54] nations amen that's easy to believe
[55:56] because it's already happened amen but
[55:58] in abraham's day that wasn't so easy to
[56:01] believe he only had capacity to believe
[56:03] it because he was a seed of god
[56:06] because he was the elect predestinated
[56:08] for that day he had the ability to
[56:09] believe that word that day and when he
[56:11] believed the word for his day what god
[56:13] had told him that day and revealed to
[56:15] him that day when he believed that it
[56:17] was imputed in him for righteousness but
[56:19] not for him only but for anybody that
[56:21] will believe in god
[56:25] that means i have to believe god present
[56:27] tense amen
[56:29] not believe what he was or what he did
[56:31] but believe what god is and what he's
[56:33] doing amen
[56:36] see that's why uh
[56:39] hebrews says those that
[56:42] without faith it is impossible to please
[56:44] god for those that come to him must
[56:45] believe that he
[56:47] is
[56:49] present tense that god is well i believe
[56:52] god exists and i believe no i believe he
[56:54] is he is what he is the word he is the
[56:57] word made manifest he is present today
[56:59] he is moving today he has word that's
[57:01] being fulfilled today he is today and i
[57:03] believe it is today
[57:06] i believe the i am god
[57:08] not that i was god or thy will be god
[57:10] but we believe the i am god
[57:12] that god is he is today he is present
[57:15] today his word is manifested today he is
[57:18] doing something today he is working
[57:20] today and we believe that today
[57:23] so it wasn't just imputed to abraham for
[57:25] abraham alone but for all of us
[57:28] who would have the same kind of faith
[57:29] that abraham had
[57:32] it's easy to say oh i believe what
[57:34] abraham believed and you know i believe
[57:37] you know what peter believed because he
[57:38] saw jesus die on the cross and i believe
[57:41] that but what about today
[57:44] do we believe the god that is
[57:51] i'm going to continue on with this quote
[57:54] now i stopped this was out of does god
[57:56] ever change his mind about his word i
[57:57] stopped with the statement there was no
[57:59] written there was no bible written so
[58:01] you see the beginning of righteousness
[58:04] is god's revealed truth
[58:06] oh i love that statement there's
[58:08] something to it friends there's
[58:10] something more than i can express now
[58:11] with words but the beginning of rice's
[58:14] is god's revealed truth
[58:16] and god still has a revealed truth for
[58:18] us
[58:20] and the entire church of the living god
[58:22] has built upon that so i i read these
[58:23] two scriptures and i'm going to finish
[58:25] this this quote
[58:26] jesus one day coming off the mount said
[58:28] to disciples who does man say that i the
[58:31] son of man am
[58:32] one said you're moses and the other one
[58:34] said you're elias and you're jeremiah's
[58:36] or one of the prophets he said but who
[58:38] do you say that i am
[58:41] that's when the apostle peter inspired
[58:43] of god quickened by the spirit made the
[58:45] tremendous statement thou art christ the
[58:47] son of the living god
[58:49] notice the statement blessed are simon
[58:51] son of jonas flesh and blood has not
[58:53] revealed this to you my heavenly father
[58:55] has revealed this to you thou art simon
[58:57] upon this rock what rock now the
[59:00] catholics say upon peter the rock little
[59:02] stone and the protestants say upon
[59:04] christ the rock
[59:06] not to be different but it was upon the
[59:07] revelation that peter had who he was
[59:10] no man can come to me said jesus except
[59:12] my father draws him and all the father
[59:14] has given me will come to me thou art
[59:17] christ the son of the living god blessed
[59:19] out there simon son of jonas flesh and
[59:21] blood has not revealed this to you but
[59:23] my father which is in heaven upon this
[59:26] rock i'll build my church and the gates
[59:29] of hell can't prevail against it
[59:30] spiritual revealed word of god
[59:34] [Music]
[59:37] because
[59:38] if we if we just take the statement and
[59:41] we just repeat
[59:42] what peter repeat repeated for that day
[59:46] and we say thou art christ the son of
[59:48] the living god
[59:50] and and then we we can say what peter
[59:52] said we can recognize that jesus in the
[59:55] bodily form was christ the son of the
[59:56] living god and he remains yet today
[59:58] christ the son of the living god amen
[1:00:00] you can say what peter said amen but but
[1:00:03] we can be in a day now to say what peter
[1:00:06] says and reject what god says now puts
[1:00:08] us in a bad place
[1:00:11] but we have to accept what peter said we
[1:00:13] don't reject peter we accept what he
[1:00:15] said but we have to accept the same
[1:00:17] spirit of revelation amen that moved
[1:00:19] upon peter to recognize the word in his
[1:00:22] day the same spirit of revelation has to
[1:00:24] move upon us to recognize the word for
[1:00:27] our day.
[1:00:29] and if we can recognize the word for our
[1:00:31] day we can have the same reward amen
[1:00:34] that the church had then we can we can
[1:00:36] be said blessed art thou
[1:00:39] and upon this rock the rock of what the
[1:00:41] rock of the revealed word the spiritual
[1:00:44] revealed word of god
[1:00:47] that's what the church is built upon
[1:00:49] that is the foundation because the
[1:00:51] beginning of righteousness is the word
[1:00:53] of god revealed
[1:00:58] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:00:59] revealed
[1:01:01] he says
[1:01:02] it goes right by them and they don't
[1:01:04] recognize it till it's gone
[1:01:07] he's talking about the truth in the
[1:01:08] bible
[1:01:09] it goes right by them and they don't
[1:01:10] recognize it till it's gone it only
[1:01:12] picks up the predestinated seed
[1:01:15] that god predestinated before the
[1:01:17] foundation of the earth the same thing
[1:01:20] came through in the days of noah same
[1:01:21] thing came through in the days of moses
[1:01:23] days of elijah days of prophets days of
[1:01:25] jesus on down to this very hour
[1:01:30] it's been the same story all through the
[1:01:32] bible cain and abel but you go all the
[1:01:34] way down through
[1:01:36] there was a there's always been a seed
[1:01:38] of god on earth that's able to catch
[1:01:40] what god's doing in their day
[1:01:43] and by that there's an imputation of
[1:01:45] righteousness and their sins are not
[1:01:47] imputed unto them
[1:01:51] we're going to read some more things but
[1:01:53] but
[1:01:54] we have to understand this is the
[1:01:55] journey of our life
[1:01:58] we come from god and we go to god and we
[1:02:00] come down here in flesh no different
[1:02:02] than anybody else but there was
[1:02:03] something embedded down in us that was
[1:02:05] different
[1:02:07] there was a life form a part of god a
[1:02:09] gene of god a part of zoe life there was
[1:02:12] something in us that was different and
[1:02:13] that something in us amen was was
[1:02:15] whatever the word is it was whatever god
[1:02:18] was it was it was a peace of god it was
[1:02:20] a part of the word amen and god put it
[1:02:23] there and embedded it there because he
[1:02:24] wanted a world filled with sons and
[1:02:26] daughters
[1:02:27] he wanted to have fellowship with his
[1:02:29] attributes upon the earth and he's got a
[1:02:31] plan of redemption that will explain
[1:02:33] display all of his attributes his healer
[1:02:35] redeemer father a restorer he's going to
[1:02:38] he's going to display all of this amen
[1:02:40] and he's not going to lose himself and
[1:02:42] he's not going to lose his plan and he's
[1:02:44] not his plan is not going to be thwarted
[1:02:46] so god is going to divide himself his
[1:02:48] attributes and he's going to place that
[1:02:50] down inside of his sons and daughters
[1:02:53] because he knows that when that piece of
[1:02:55] the word comes in contact with the word
[1:02:57] for their day that's going to be like a
[1:02:58] lightning strike amen it's going to
[1:03:00] bring life to it
[1:03:04] and this is our journey friends we're
[1:03:06] not sitting in this church because we're
[1:03:08] lucky
[1:03:10] we never heard the message because we
[1:03:13] were in the right place at the right
[1:03:14] time the truth is you were in the right
[1:03:16] place at the right time but it wasn't by
[1:03:18] happenstance it wasn't by luck and then
[1:03:20] it wasn't by your or your proper
[1:03:22] thinking god placed you where he placed
[1:03:24] you he made sure he watched over your
[1:03:26] steps until he could get that lightning
[1:03:28] strike to hit the right spot amen
[1:03:33] he he knew where he sowed his seed and
[1:03:36] he knew what bed and ground it would
[1:03:38] come forth and what time it would come
[1:03:39] forth and he had to make sure that he
[1:03:41] got the light to strike the seed he had
[1:03:43] to get the conditions right he had to
[1:03:45] get the atmosphere right he was working
[1:03:47] amen to get it right because he would
[1:03:49] impute righteousness because the
[1:03:50] beginning of righteousness is the word
[1:03:52] revealed amen and he would know that i
[1:03:54] can declare them righteous i can put
[1:03:56] impute righteousness upon them i can
[1:03:58] dissolve all of their sins when they
[1:04:00] believe me
[1:04:06] amen
[1:04:10] and the message jehovah jireh 1964
[1:04:14] he says now
[1:04:16] listen close to this quote
[1:04:18] now we notice no matter what the others
[1:04:20] done how they walked away those
[1:04:22] disciples were predestinated they were
[1:04:24] ordained to eternal life
[1:04:28] you know what i love
[1:04:30] i love it when life gets so rough
[1:04:33] and churches get so bad
[1:04:36] that you have a golden opportunity to
[1:04:38] walk away
[1:04:42] you might think that those things that
[1:04:44] happened in the past were horrible
[1:04:47] those things that we went through and
[1:04:49] falling away and splits and
[1:04:52] and and whatever doctrinal fights and
[1:04:55] all of that but what i love is the fact
[1:04:57] that god has so much confidence in the
[1:05:00] seed
[1:05:02] that he'll put that seed and it can go
[1:05:04] through what the disciples went through
[1:05:08] everything can go wrong it can go upside
[1:05:10] down it can go backwards but i thank god
[1:05:13] that no matter how many things went
[1:05:15] wrong amen there's something amen there
[1:05:17] that will recognize the word and stay
[1:05:19] with it through it all
[1:05:22] even without the ability to explain
[1:05:24] what's happening there's things
[1:05:25] happening we don't understand what's
[1:05:27] happening amen things went wrong we made
[1:05:29] it still to this day not be able to
[1:05:30] explain what went wrong in the
[1:05:32] situations in the past but it doesn't
[1:05:34] matter amen because god's got a seed
[1:05:36] that'll go through all of it amen and
[1:05:38] it'll come forth like gold
[1:05:42] this is the journey of our lives friend
[1:05:44] amen it's not that we had a pristine
[1:05:46] life or a perfect life or that
[1:05:48] everything we ever ever everything we
[1:05:50] went to do turned out right and it all
[1:05:52] came out gold and every church we were
[1:05:53] part of was wonderful
[1:05:58] but it just goes to prove that there's
[1:05:59] something in you
[1:06:02] that when the circumstances go wrong you
[1:06:03] still believe
[1:06:06] when other people fall away you still
[1:06:07] believe amen when they say horrible
[1:06:09] things about you and what you believe
[1:06:11] and about the messenger you still
[1:06:13] believe amen because there's the there's
[1:06:14] a receiver on the inside to receive
[1:06:16] truth you believe because of that not
[1:06:18] because of your mind and not because of
[1:06:20] the circumstances around you you don't
[1:06:22] believe and listen our children are not
[1:06:24] going to believe because we made
[1:06:25] everything perfect around them
[1:06:28] and they had a perfect youth group and
[1:06:29] they had a perfect church and they had
[1:06:30] perfect opportunities and a perfect camp
[1:06:32] and a perfect fellowship and a perfect
[1:06:34] desk that's never going to produce faith
[1:06:36] amen because they can go through the
[1:06:38] most imperfect of the imperfect
[1:06:39] situations but if there's a seed of god
[1:06:41] on the inside when they hear that word
[1:06:43] they're going to say that's it that's
[1:06:45] the truth
[1:06:47] no matter how imperfect it is and it's
[1:06:49] not that we're going to try to sow our
[1:06:50] seed to troubles our children to trouble
[1:06:52] to prove them
[1:06:54] i'm not proving that
[1:06:55] god will do the proving
[1:06:57] we protect them we feed them we give
[1:06:59] them the word amen we shelter them amen
[1:07:01] but it's not going to be that that
[1:07:03] produces life it's only going to be if
[1:07:05] there's life already on the inside and
[1:07:07] when word comes the word and life comes
[1:07:08] to life it'll quicken the life
[1:07:15] he says now
[1:07:17] the disciples were predestinated
[1:07:20] others done how they walked away that
[1:07:22] those disciples were predestinated they
[1:07:23] were ordained to eternal life
[1:07:26] no they couldn't explain it they
[1:07:28] couldn't explain it no more than the
[1:07:30] rest of them could but there was
[1:07:31] something in them that representation in
[1:07:34] heaven
[1:07:35] [Music]
[1:07:37] there is something in them that
[1:07:39] representation in heaven
[1:07:42] a thought that god had of them before
[1:07:43] the foundation of the world
[1:07:45] and manifested itself here and they were
[1:07:48] connected with god
[1:07:50] and was sure that was god's promise
[1:07:52] vindicated and nothing is going to
[1:07:54] change it from them
[1:07:56] i'm going to read that again because of
[1:07:58] the next statement so i'm going to leave
[1:07:59] you in anticipation brother is getting
[1:08:01] ready to say something wonderful
[1:08:04] but he said there was something in them
[1:08:07] that representation in heaven a thought
[1:08:09] that god had of them before the
[1:08:11] foundation of the world
[1:08:12] and manifested itself here and they were
[1:08:15] connected with god
[1:08:17] and was sure that was god's promise
[1:08:19] vindicated
[1:08:21] and nothing is going to change it from
[1:08:23] them that's real genuine christianity
[1:08:29] what's real genuine christianity a
[1:08:31] representation in heaven a connection
[1:08:33] with god
[1:08:34] that's real genuine christianity
[1:08:37] see listen brother branham wasn't making
[1:08:39] it about actions and about conduct and
[1:08:41] about about you know they went to the
[1:08:43] right church and they believed the right
[1:08:44] thing and they did all this those things
[1:08:46] are important friends i'm not
[1:08:47] discounting that but real genuine
[1:08:49] christianity is being connected with god
[1:08:52] coming from god having heavenly
[1:08:54] representation having a capacity to
[1:08:56] receive the word when everything around
[1:08:58] you is falling apart and when you have
[1:09:00] no explanations for anything
[1:09:03] when everything was falling away and
[1:09:05] those few disciples were holding on amen
[1:09:08] they had a connection with god they had
[1:09:10] representation in the heavenlies a
[1:09:12] thought of god that was manifested and
[1:09:14] that was true christianity
[1:09:18] and see we we sometimes want to make
[1:09:20] true christianity i'm good to my
[1:09:22] neighbor and i and i worked at the soup
[1:09:24] kitchen and i did those things and
[1:09:25] there's not one thing wrong with those
[1:09:27] those are good things and if we all did
[1:09:29] them it wouldn't hurt us one ounce
[1:09:32] but that's not true christianity true
[1:09:34] christianity is coming from god going
[1:09:37] back to god amen being a part of god
[1:09:40] amen understanding the word of god by a
[1:09:42] revelation from god that is true
[1:09:44] christianity
[1:09:47] see i want to i want to talk about our
[1:09:49] journey
[1:09:51] because
[1:09:52] that's the revelation that brings life
[1:09:54] and that's who we truly are and that's
[1:09:56] true christianity and i try to i'm
[1:09:59] trying to paint the picture separate
[1:10:01] from merit
[1:10:04] like i did this and i did that and i go
[1:10:06] here and i i pay my tithe and i do that
[1:10:08] and that's not true christianity true
[1:10:11] christianity is is being connected to
[1:10:14] god and having representation in heaven
[1:10:15] and believing the word
[1:10:17] that's true christianity now all those
[1:10:20] things are outcroppings of true
[1:10:22] christianity
[1:10:25] i hope you can understand that
[1:10:28] so you can have the outcroppings and not
[1:10:31] have the genuine thing
[1:10:34] amen
[1:10:37] the important part is to know we got the
[1:10:38] genuine
[1:10:41] and the life on the inside will produce
[1:10:42] all of those things
[1:10:45] but we can't get the cart before the
[1:10:46] horse friends we can't
[1:10:48] you know i think so many times that
[1:10:51] we've gotten discouraged over the years
[1:10:53] because because true christianity was
[1:10:56] painted as a as a set of uh conductor
[1:11:01] actions
[1:11:02] right uh works let's say
[1:11:05] these certain works are true
[1:11:06] christianity and if we do all of these
[1:11:08] works we're really christians and if we
[1:11:10] have these manifestations in our life
[1:11:12] we're true christians
[1:11:15] but you can have some of those things in
[1:11:17] your life or have many of those things
[1:11:19] and not be the genuine article
[1:11:22] and we've seen it amen we've seen people
[1:11:24] with gifts and abilities and kindness
[1:11:26] and good temperaments and paying tithes
[1:11:30] and spiritual gifts and they'll turn and
[1:11:32] walk away from the message and call the
[1:11:33] prophet a liar and say it's not true
[1:11:36] there was no new birth there
[1:11:39] there was no baptism of the holy ghost
[1:11:40] there
[1:11:44] so you see what looked like true
[1:11:46] christianity we've seen it with our own
[1:11:48] eyes friends what looked like true
[1:11:50] christianity proved not to be true
[1:11:52] christianity it was a masquerade of
[1:11:54] christianity
[1:11:56] so that's why we've got to move away
[1:11:58] from the works amen
[1:12:00] and get down to the reality of what true
[1:12:02] christianity is it's a revelation that i
[1:12:05] come from god i go to god
[1:12:07] it is a revelation that i am now
[1:12:10] connected to god
[1:12:12] where's the connection i don't know i
[1:12:15] can't show it to you i don't have the
[1:12:16] cord or the certificate but there's a
[1:12:18] connection between me and god and god
[1:12:20] has a way of speaking to me and there's
[1:12:22] things that i know that have come from
[1:12:24] god and i know this message is true i
[1:12:26] know this was god's prophet and i know
[1:12:28] i'm a child of god
[1:12:31] see that revelation has to come apart
[1:12:33] from merit and the reason it's got to
[1:12:35] come apart from merit is because we live
[1:12:38] in this life and we've got a sticky
[1:12:39] caulker-borne nature and there's traps
[1:12:41] set for us and we're going to fall into
[1:12:42] them those are all things the prophet of
[1:12:44] god said
[1:12:46] and even the prophet of god fell into
[1:12:48] one of those traps when he had lawyers
[1:12:49] and he was getting tired because of a
[1:12:51] tax case and he got his wife to lie to
[1:12:53] the to the uh to the lawyers for him
[1:12:57] and if we were basing true christianity
[1:12:59] off america there's no way you could
[1:13:01] look at that and say that was true
[1:13:02] christianity
[1:13:05] but how could you look at that prophet
[1:13:07] say he wasn't truly a christian
[1:13:10] so we've got to separate the two
[1:13:13] just temporarily not for a long term
[1:13:17] we've got to get the first things first
[1:13:19] i want to know who i am by a revelation
[1:13:21] from god
[1:13:24] i want to know who i am because god told
[1:13:26] me who i am i want to know this message
[1:13:28] true because god told me it's true
[1:13:30] because something in me quickened the
[1:13:32] life that there's a reality inside of me
[1:13:34] there's a matching part in me for this
[1:13:36] message for this revealed word of the
[1:13:38] hour it's a matching part but there's a
[1:13:40] matching part in me and we click
[1:13:42] together like a hand in the glove like
[1:13:44] two puzzle pieces locking together this
[1:13:46] mystery revealed and the mystery in me
[1:13:48] locked together like two pieces of a
[1:13:50] puzzle
[1:13:52] that's what we have to have established
[1:13:53] and that is
[1:13:55] that is the foundation for us amen
[1:13:57] that's the foundation we're put on
[1:13:58] that's the beginning of righteousness is
[1:14:00] believing the word for your day
[1:14:03] that's real genuine christianity
[1:14:07] now don't think i'm done i'm not done
[1:14:10] hang on
[1:14:13] and the fifth seal we're going back to
[1:14:14] the fifth seal brother braham said the
[1:14:16] one
[1:14:18] the ones that the lord showed me the
[1:14:19] bride she was not under the martyr's
[1:14:22] block no the sacrifice altered the
[1:14:23] martyrs but had received white robes
[1:14:26] by accepting the pardoning grace of the
[1:14:30] living word
[1:14:33] and we'll say it again because sometimes
[1:14:35] first time we miss pieces
[1:14:38] but they weren't under the sacrifice
[1:14:40] altar this bride the group i saw but had
[1:14:42] received white robes how do you get
[1:14:44] those white robes amen by living right
[1:14:46] doing right being nice treating my
[1:14:49] neighbor good
[1:14:50] going to the right church and paying
[1:14:52] your tithe no you get the white robe by
[1:14:55] accepting the pardoning grace of the
[1:14:57] living word
[1:14:59] i have accepted the living word amen and
[1:15:01] that's the pardoning grace in my life
[1:15:03] it's a sign of righteousness imputed
[1:15:05] unto me he will not impute sent to me
[1:15:07] because i believe him amen i believe him
[1:15:09] as he is i believe him the i am i
[1:15:11] believe him today i believe him now i
[1:15:13] believe jesus christ present tense
[1:15:19] so they had white rose by accepting the
[1:15:21] pardoning grace of the living word in
[1:15:23] luther's day they accepted luther's
[1:15:24] message in wesley's day they accepted
[1:15:26] wesley's message but in our day we've
[1:15:28] got to accept more than luther's wesley
[1:15:29] and more than wesley's message we have
[1:15:31] to accept the message for our day
[1:15:35] and that's our pardon grace of the
[1:15:36] living word
[1:15:39] in future home
[1:15:40] brother bram says now you say
[1:15:42] well look at this priest wasn't he a son
[1:15:45] of god
[1:15:46] he proved he wasn't
[1:15:49] he couldn't recognize what did he say i
[1:15:51] believe the bible sure
[1:15:53] but he couldn't recognize the expressed
[1:15:55] word of the hour
[1:15:57] brother baby said those priests you
[1:15:58] couldn't touch their lives
[1:16:01] they just lived such a life you couldn't
[1:16:03] touch their lives the morality their
[1:16:05] obedience they meant all the things that
[1:16:06] they've done their piousness and all of
[1:16:08] the religion and then you couldn't touch
[1:16:10] their lives but he says was he a son
[1:16:13] wasn't he a son of god he proved he
[1:16:16] wasn't a son of god how did he prove he
[1:16:18] wasn't a son of god by rejecting the
[1:16:20] word when he was faced with the word he
[1:16:22] rejected the word and he proved he was
[1:16:24] not a son of god no matter how much he
[1:16:26] looked like one he wasn't one
[1:16:33] he says i believe the bible sure
[1:16:35] he couldn't recognize the expressword of
[1:16:37] the hour he only had an intellectual
[1:16:39] learning from some group that he had
[1:16:41] been back before him
[1:16:45] that's a zinger
[1:16:47] think about it
[1:16:49] all he had was an intellectual learning
[1:16:51] from some group that had been back
[1:16:52] before him
[1:16:56] we could be standing in the same place
[1:16:58] today
[1:17:00] we could have an intellectual learning
[1:17:02] of a group of people that was back
[1:17:03] before us that saw the prophet and saw
[1:17:05] all the miracles
[1:17:07] and we're in the meetings and could tell
[1:17:09] us i had this happen to me and i saw
[1:17:11] this and my friend was told where he
[1:17:14] lived and my this and this and that amen
[1:17:16] and if we're not careful we could all we
[1:17:18] could have in the message today is an
[1:17:20] intellectual learning of somebody back
[1:17:22] before us
[1:17:24] but that won't produce for us anything
[1:17:26] more than it produced for the scribes
[1:17:28] and priests and pharisees sadducees in
[1:17:29] that day amen we have to accept the
[1:17:31] living word today
[1:17:35] for ourselves
[1:17:37] and it's the same thing today see
[1:17:39] i know that's strong but it's the truth
[1:17:42] there was the word as spoken exactly for
[1:17:44] that day and he yet he was a scholar yet
[1:17:47] he was a renowned person but he could
[1:17:49] not recognize it why no matter how
[1:17:51] scholar he was anything like that he
[1:17:54] still didn't have representation of
[1:17:56] predestination
[1:17:58] what is it the link with god the
[1:18:00] representation in heaven my
[1:18:02] predestination he had all the
[1:18:04] credentials he had a good life he had
[1:18:07] morality he had faith in the bible he
[1:18:10] believed amen what what had happened in
[1:18:12] the days before him he was a good boy
[1:18:15] but what he didn't have was
[1:18:17] representation by predestination
[1:18:21] he had everything else friends he he has
[1:18:23] things you and i don't have
[1:18:27] but he didn't have representation by
[1:18:29] predestination
[1:18:31] he didn't have representation in heaven
[1:18:33] he wasn't from the thoughts of god amen
[1:18:36] we've got something different than what
[1:18:38] that priest had and what we have gives
[1:18:40] us the ability to say that ain't nothing
[1:18:42] but the truth
[1:18:43] when we listen to brother branham on
[1:18:44] tape say when you heard the eagle scream
[1:18:47] you recognized it was eagle food and
[1:18:48] left all the others you've been turned
[1:18:50] into the living image of the living god
[1:18:51] you heard from your theophany you can
[1:18:53] say amen
[1:18:56] amen when you're looking listen to
[1:18:58] brother branham look look at a group of
[1:19:00] living people and say i was over beyond
[1:19:02] the curtain of time and i seen them all
[1:19:03] over there and i seen you all over there
[1:19:05] you can say that's nothing but the truth
[1:19:08] why because i got something the pharisee
[1:19:10] doesn't have i got something the
[1:19:11] theologian doesn't have what i have is i
[1:19:13] have a connection with god amen i've got
[1:19:16] a link to god i've got some way to hear
[1:19:19] amen some connection to the heavenly to
[1:19:22] the eternal that says that's true
[1:19:25] when the prophet says something in your
[1:19:26] heart it says that's true
[1:19:29] and he says something else it doesn't
[1:19:30] matter what your head your head can be
[1:19:32] saying what where was that i didn't hear
[1:19:33] that scripture
[1:19:37] amen don't tell me mine's the only head
[1:19:39] that does that
[1:19:42] i'm going to have to go back and pray
[1:19:43] now
[1:19:45] your head your head can be saying your
[1:19:47] mind you're into like me saying what
[1:19:49] scripture is that i don't think he
[1:19:50] quoted that scripture right i don't
[1:19:51] remember it that way
[1:19:54] but didn't he say over here this way
[1:19:57] your head can be doing that but
[1:19:58] something in your heart's saying amen
[1:20:00] amen amen
[1:20:02] that's the truth explain it to me i
[1:20:05] don't know but it's the truth
[1:20:09] hallelujah
[1:20:10] if we got that friends we should have
[1:20:12] confidence amen we should be happy
[1:20:14] people we should say praise be to god
[1:20:16] but i got this problem in my life and i
[1:20:19] and i don't seem to overcome amen just
[1:20:21] focus on the thing that you got amen and
[1:20:23] the thing that you got will change
[1:20:24] everything else
[1:20:26] we spend so much time trying to be a
[1:20:29] pharisee that we won't be a disciple
[1:20:35] look at peter trying to compare his life
[1:20:37] with the pharisee
[1:20:39] peter the ignorant unlearned fisherman
[1:20:41] who really couldn't keep his mouth shut
[1:20:43] and got himself in a lot of trouble even
[1:20:44] with the lord
[1:20:47] imagine him trying imagine him trying to
[1:20:48] compare himself with judas
[1:20:54] you see this is where we make our
[1:20:56] mistake we don't put our focus on the
[1:20:58] most important thing
[1:21:01] we get deceit by the devil to try to
[1:21:03] become a pharisee i don't want to be a
[1:21:05] pharisee
[1:21:06] i want to be a real raw rugged true
[1:21:10] believer
[1:21:12] and i want god to take that life that's
[1:21:14] inside of me and i want him to live his
[1:21:16] own life in me i don't want to decide
[1:21:18] what he wants i don't want to try to be
[1:21:20] something i'm not i want the reality
[1:21:22] living in me to push out and make
[1:21:25] everything the way god wants it
[1:21:33] he didn't have i'm still in future home
[1:21:36] talking about this priest he he still
[1:21:38] didn't have representation of
[1:21:39] predestination see
[1:21:41] only the predestinated
[1:21:43] will only be the one who does it
[1:21:45] only can be
[1:21:47] and you only can do it because look it
[1:21:50] proves predestination because if you got
[1:21:52] eternal life you had to be part of god
[1:21:54] at all times because he's the only ones
[1:21:56] eternal
[1:21:58] then he goes through trying to do god's
[1:21:59] service he says he only reveals his word
[1:22:02] in the predestinated
[1:22:05] now listen listen what he said
[1:22:07] he didn't say to the predestination
[1:22:10] catch this quote exactly he said he only
[1:22:12] reveals his word
[1:22:14] in the predestinated
[1:22:17] is he revealing his word in you amen
[1:22:19] that's the point today amen we can have
[1:22:22] an intellectual understanding of what
[1:22:23] happened before us and miss what he's
[1:22:25] doing today because he's here in the
[1:22:27] formation of the bride amen he's here
[1:22:29] revealing his word in the predestinated
[1:22:32] and the predestination can catch it
[1:22:37] and the message only
[1:22:39] god's only provided place of worship now
[1:22:41] think these men
[1:22:42] who was they called and was put in his
[1:22:44] condition these pharisees by jesus said
[1:22:47] in vain you worship me
[1:22:48] worship him genuine worship true worship
[1:22:51] from their hearts
[1:22:53] catch that
[1:22:55] in vain you worship me why teaching for
[1:22:57] doctrine or tradition of man
[1:22:59] therefore you make the commandments of
[1:23:00] god of no effect to the people
[1:23:03] if i taught you methodist message it
[1:23:05] would take no effect on you
[1:23:07] this is bride time
[1:23:08] amen if moses taught the message of no
[1:23:11] it would take no effect if jesus taught
[1:23:13] moses message it would take take no
[1:23:15] effect because the predestinated cedar
[1:23:18] laying there will only be watered by the
[1:23:20] type of water that was give for that
[1:23:22] seed
[1:23:24] it won't grow any other condition it
[1:23:27] must be the condition that grows it
[1:23:31] see good church attendance and a good
[1:23:32] this and a good that won't do anything
[1:23:34] it's got to be the revealed word of the
[1:23:36] hour if there if you're a child of god
[1:23:38] predestinated for this hour there's a
[1:23:40] portion of god laying in you a seed a
[1:23:42] part of the word that's laying there and
[1:23:44] that part of the word is meant to be
[1:23:46] expressed in this hour it wasn't for
[1:23:48] noah's day it wasn't for the methodist
[1:23:50] day it wasn't for the pentecostal day it
[1:23:52] was for this day 2021
[1:23:57] don't say i was born out of season don't
[1:23:59] say it was better back then don't say i
[1:24:00] wish i would live some other time you be
[1:24:02] grateful that you've got something in
[1:24:04] you to live in this day
[1:24:06] there's something in you that can take
[1:24:08] all the nonsense amen all of the
[1:24:11] darkness and all of the confusion and
[1:24:12] all the different messages that are out
[1:24:14] there but there's something in you that
[1:24:16] can navigate all of that because god
[1:24:18] ordained it for this hour to be watered
[1:24:20] by the word that's falling in this
[1:24:22] season to bring it to life and that's
[1:24:24] the only thing that'll grow that
[1:24:28] seed you see
[1:24:34] we want to grow in christ
[1:24:37] we want to be more like him
[1:24:40] but so many times we're using a human
[1:24:42] effort to be more like him
[1:24:45] we're straining and we're pushing and
[1:24:48] we're trying
[1:24:49] to be self-reformers
[1:24:53] and you know there's nothing wrong with
[1:24:54] recognizing this is wrong i'm not going
[1:24:56] to do it there's nothing wrong with that
[1:24:58] there's nothing wrong with recognizing
[1:25:00] you can recognize you know what this app
[1:25:03] on my phone is a problem for me i'm
[1:25:05] going to delete it
[1:25:07] there's nothing wrong with that
[1:25:08] that's good i encourage you to do that
[1:25:12] but if that's all you have that's not it
[1:25:15] we can delete them all amen we can all
[1:25:17] go back to dial phones we can all go
[1:25:19] back to rotary to be even safer
[1:25:23] but unless there's a seat on the inside
[1:25:25] it's going to amount to nothing
[1:25:29] unless there's something on the inside
[1:25:30] that'll catch the word amen and be
[1:25:32] birthed by the word and catch the word
[1:25:34] and grow by the word amen the word what
[1:25:36] word the word for this day amen will
[1:25:38] grow the seed that's predestinated for
[1:25:40] this day
[1:25:44] and so that's what we need is we need
[1:25:46] the word and we need more of the word
[1:25:48] and we need more of the word preached in
[1:25:49] revelation for this day amen that's what
[1:25:52] we need friends
[1:25:54] to grow this seed
[1:25:56] the
[1:25:57] the human efforts have failed us for how
[1:26:00] long
[1:26:01] how long how how how tired have we
[1:26:04] become
[1:26:08] pushing i want to i want to when i get
[1:26:10] to this level
[1:26:12] when i'm like this when this is gone
[1:26:14] when i no longer struggle with this
[1:26:16] listen friends we're focusing on the
[1:26:18] wrong thing the devil is putting a
[1:26:19] carrot on the end of a stick amen just
[1:26:21] to get you to march around and get
[1:26:23] really tired
[1:26:25] i would say the thing that grows the
[1:26:26] seed inside of me if there's a seed in
[1:26:28] me that was built to overcome 2021
[1:26:32] then i want that seed to grow now how am
[1:26:34] i going to get that seed to grow well in
[1:26:35] 2021 we should probably do this and this
[1:26:38] is probably a better activity than
[1:26:39] forget it friends feed it the word for
[1:26:42] this hour amen feed that seed all of the
[1:26:45] water and all of the light that god is
[1:26:47] dropping down from heaven for this very
[1:26:49] hour he has anointed the preaching for
[1:26:51] this hour he's anointed a message amen
[1:26:53] it's laying on tape for today
[1:26:56] it's there friends it's there he put
[1:26:58] things there 60 years ago that were for
[1:27:00] today
[1:27:03] you believe that he's not bringing
[1:27:05] another message we don't need new tapes
[1:27:06] we need the same tapes because there's
[1:27:08] something laying in that tape for today
[1:27:11] because god knew this messenger this
[1:27:12] latter rain that would fall would be the
[1:27:14] final rain that would come all the way
[1:27:16] through to the harvest so he had to drop
[1:27:18] it all in this rain
[1:27:20] so it's all there amen but god amen
[1:27:23] through gifts in the body is taking and
[1:27:25] pulling it out and saying look it's
[1:27:26] there it's there it's there it's already
[1:27:29] there he already told us what to do he
[1:27:31] already told us how to overcome we need
[1:27:33] to feed on this word
[1:27:38] and then let the seed grow
[1:27:41] because there's already
[1:27:43] listen
[1:27:44] god's not surprised that 2021 is
[1:27:46] difficult
[1:27:49] god's not shocked
[1:27:51] that
[1:27:52] everything's falling apart
[1:27:55] it's amazing how sometimes we have to
[1:27:57] catch ourselves friends we we as human
[1:27:59] beings we have to catch ourselves and
[1:28:01] remember i have a father
[1:28:03] like i have a father
[1:28:06] i don't have to worry
[1:28:08] i don't have to make plans for myself i
[1:28:11] don't have to become a prepper i don't
[1:28:12] have to get a bug out bag
[1:28:15] and
[1:28:16] right
[1:28:18] i hope you don't think you need to do
[1:28:19] all those things
[1:28:21] because i have a father two sparrows are
[1:28:23] sold for a penny and not one falls to
[1:28:24] the ground but my father knows it
[1:28:27] see the lily neither toils nor spins but
[1:28:29] solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
[1:28:30] as one of these
[1:28:32] do you think he doesn't know how to take
[1:28:34] care of you he can care for the sparrow
[1:28:35] and the lily how much more can he care
[1:28:37] for you
[1:28:41] jesus trying to teach his disciples he
[1:28:43] says go forth into the cities two by two
[1:28:45] and take neither script nor bag and only
[1:28:47] one change of clothes
[1:28:49] and you're going to find out that my
[1:28:51] provision is enough
[1:28:54] we live in an hour where we're trying to
[1:28:56] find out what do we do with our money
[1:28:58] and do we need a steward of this and
[1:29:00] what's going to happen next
[1:29:01] and what
[1:29:02] what's what's the conspiracy what's the
[1:29:04] government up to
[1:29:06] listen we're going to waste our time
[1:29:08] protecting ourselves providing for
[1:29:09] ourselves amen listen god's got it
[1:29:11] already programmed in he already has the
[1:29:14] solution he already knows and guess what
[1:29:16] he's already programmed it into your
[1:29:18] spiritual dna
[1:29:20] the overcomer is in you amen by the new
[1:29:23] birth the overcomer's there inside of
[1:29:25] you he's built you for this hour he's
[1:29:27] built you to overcome and if it goes
[1:29:29] worse from here he's built you for it
[1:29:32] so we need to stop looking around and
[1:29:34] reading articles and preparation how to
[1:29:37] prepare what we need to do is be feeding
[1:29:39] on the word amen so this seed can grow
[1:29:41] and grow and grow and bear the fruit
[1:29:43] that it's supposed to prayer in this
[1:29:45] atmosphere
[1:29:49] remember
[1:29:50] certain seeds only come forth in certain
[1:29:52] times
[1:29:54] do you believe that
[1:29:55] wheat comes forth at a certain time
[1:29:57] barley comes forth at a certain time
[1:29:58] your corn gets planted at a certain time
[1:30:00] you have an early season and a late
[1:30:02] garden and
[1:30:03] you understand
[1:30:05] certain seeds comes forth at a certain
[1:30:06] time well the seed was in you was only
[1:30:09] ordained to come forth in this time
[1:30:13] so the attributes that are locked inside
[1:30:15] of you that god wants to express can
[1:30:17] only be expressed when things get bad
[1:30:22] brother chad
[1:30:24] hey listen the millennium is coming
[1:30:29] don't try to live it now it's coming
[1:30:32] amen
[1:30:34] there's certain things there there's
[1:30:36] been a bride there's been a chosen
[1:30:39] predestined people reserved for this
[1:30:41] hour
[1:30:43] why wasn't i born 100 years ago because
[1:30:45] what's in you needed to be expressed in
[1:30:47] the time that you live
[1:30:51] and if the condition gets worse out
[1:30:53] there then it's only god making the
[1:30:55] season right for the seed to bear fruit
[1:31:02] i want to bear fruit
[1:31:03] well you know
[1:31:05] you're the kind of seed that only bears
[1:31:07] fruit when everything else goes dark and
[1:31:09] winter out there
[1:31:12] or however god wants to do it in your
[1:31:14] life i don't know but we keep thinking
[1:31:17] it it's got to be a certain way no it's
[1:31:19] got to be the way that he predestinated
[1:31:20] for it to be
[1:31:22] we've got to quit trying to achieve and
[1:31:25] gain and fix and and just focus on the
[1:31:28] word and let the word do all the work in
[1:31:30] our lives
[1:31:31] that the revealed word that god has
[1:31:33] given to us let it bring forth the fruit
[1:31:35] let it grow the seed let it let it bring
[1:31:38] forth the overcomer that's already on
[1:31:40] the inside
[1:31:44] ii peter 3 18 says but grow in grace
[1:31:48] and in knowledge of our lord and savior
[1:31:49] jesus christ to him be glory both now
[1:31:52] and forever amen
[1:31:56] see we have to
[1:31:58] catch a revelation of who we are
[1:32:02] we have to catch a revelation but we
[1:32:03] have to grow
[1:32:05] when we catch this revelation it doesn't
[1:32:07] mean that we're done but we're growing
[1:32:10] into the image of jesus christ we're
[1:32:11] growing something's growing within us
[1:32:13] for a manifestation
[1:32:15] and we grow in grace and in the
[1:32:16] knowledge of our lord
[1:32:19] brother rem says in things that are to
[1:32:20] be
[1:32:21] said i got the baptism in the holy
[1:32:23] spirit that still has nothing to do with
[1:32:25] it that's just only a temporal gift for
[1:32:27] you
[1:32:28] the real gift is your soul down in there
[1:32:30] see that was born of god and that
[1:32:32] controls the whole thing to the word of
[1:32:34] god and the will of god
[1:32:36] and there you grow up
[1:32:40] from there you grow up amen first don't
[1:32:43] try to grow up until you've caught the
[1:32:45] revelation of who you are and been born
[1:32:47] again by the spirit of god get the first
[1:32:49] things first
[1:32:52] and from there grow up
[1:32:54] then you're a son and daughter of god
[1:32:56] you're a child of god and these things
[1:32:58] as you come up like the mother now
[1:32:59] you're in the bowels of the earth trying
[1:33:01] to come forth you're a son of god coming
[1:33:02] forth and you see the word say i
[1:33:04] shouldn't do this i should be born
[1:33:06] again.
[1:33:07] and he goes on to talk about you just
[1:33:08] come to the word you don't reject it you
[1:33:10] grow up
[1:33:12] and the message things that are to be
[1:33:13] again he says we
[1:33:15] as an
[1:33:16] as an old man a minister i preach around
[1:33:18] the world got millions of friends but i
[1:33:20] know i've got to stand with you yonder
[1:33:22] get away from the things of the world
[1:33:25] and if there is something in you that
[1:33:27] you still want to act the way you act if
[1:33:29] you do have the things of the world and
[1:33:30] you remember you're none of god you're
[1:33:32] just a church member until that call
[1:33:35] that deep calling to the deep
[1:33:38] you're until you get a deep calling to
[1:33:40] the deep you're just a church member
[1:33:42] but once you get the deep calling to the
[1:33:44] deep you might still go to the same
[1:33:46] church but you're not just a church
[1:33:47] member anymore
[1:33:50] remember once the deep calls to the deep
[1:33:52] once the deep calls you out amen you're
[1:33:55] not just a church member anymore from
[1:33:57] there you grow up
[1:33:59] like before there was a listen like
[1:34:01] before there was a fin on a fish's back
[1:34:03] there had to be a water for him to swim
[1:34:05] in first
[1:34:06] or he'd never have a fin
[1:34:09] before there was a tree to grow in the
[1:34:10] earth there had to be an earth there
[1:34:12] would have been no tree to grow in there
[1:34:14] would be no reason for the tree
[1:34:16] and to make it coexist
[1:34:18] before there was a creation there had to
[1:34:20] be a creator
[1:34:22] blessed are they that do hunger and
[1:34:23] thirst after righteousness see there is
[1:34:25] something in us
[1:34:27] if there's something in us that's
[1:34:28] longing for god there had to be a god
[1:34:30] first to long for
[1:34:33] if there's something calling out for
[1:34:34] righteousness and a manifested life
[1:34:37] there has to already be a manifested
[1:34:39] life
[1:34:41] if there's a life of christ to be lived
[1:34:42] it already has to be available or we
[1:34:44] wouldn't even have the desire for it
[1:34:48] so we get to realize that we're created
[1:34:50] for that amen and god has put a matching
[1:34:53] part in us and a desire in us for what's
[1:34:56] attainable
[1:34:59] but it's going to take the word
[1:35:02] let's go to ephesians chapter 4.
[1:35:04] we're going to wind down and i'm going
[1:35:05] to read this scripture in another couple
[1:35:07] quotes
[1:35:08] ephesians chapter 4.
[1:35:19] ephesians 4 and 11
[1:35:22] and he gave some apostles and some
[1:35:24] prophets and some evangelists and some
[1:35:26] pastors and teachers
[1:35:28] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[1:35:30] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:35:32] the body of christ
[1:35:33] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:35:35] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[1:35:37] god and to a perfect man
[1:35:39] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:35:41] fullness of christ
[1:35:43] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:35:45] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:35:46] every wind of doctrine by the slight of
[1:35:48] them and cunning craftiness whereby they
[1:35:50] lie and wait to deceive
[1:35:52] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[1:35:54] up into him
[1:35:55] in all things which is the head
[1:35:58] even christ
[1:36:00] so we are growing up friends
[1:36:03] we are growing up to be
[1:36:05] just like christ
[1:36:07] growing in the head to be
[1:36:09] him
[1:36:13] in christ the mystery of god revealed he
[1:36:15] says god is known by simplicity
[1:36:18] and of the revelation of jesus christ to
[1:36:19] the most illiterate person
[1:36:22] not your theology it's a revelation of
[1:36:25] jesus christ upon this rock i'll build
[1:36:27] my church no other rocks accepted no
[1:36:30] other things
[1:36:31] no other things accepted no other roman
[1:36:33] rock no other protestant rock no other
[1:36:35] school no other nothing but on exactly
[1:36:37] the revelation of jesus christ through
[1:36:39] the new birth
[1:36:41] he's born in there and he injects his
[1:36:43] own life and your life is gone and the
[1:36:45] life of christ is projecting itself
[1:36:47] through you with the preeminences to the
[1:36:49] people but they see the very life and
[1:36:52] works and signs and wonders that he did
[1:36:54] is doing the same thing through you
[1:36:56] outside of that the rest of us not even
[1:36:58] called to it at all
[1:37:00] watch god's great revelation
[1:37:02] unfolding
[1:37:03] he says again in christ the mystery of
[1:37:05] god revealed now there is only one thing
[1:37:07] can happen there has to be a message at
[1:37:09] the end time when there is nothing else
[1:37:11] can follow it and now now the ecumenical
[1:37:13] world has set up such a regime that
[1:37:15] there can be no denomination and no not
[1:37:17] nothing else follow him you're either in
[1:37:20] it or you're not in it
[1:37:21] the fruit is in the top of the tree and
[1:37:23] the light is shining on that
[1:37:24] predestinated fruit and she is ripening
[1:37:27] ripening into christ-like fruit bringing
[1:37:29] forth the same mellowness and sweetness
[1:37:32] and the same spirit that he had in him
[1:37:34] hope you see it
[1:37:36] i want to take this and i'm going to go
[1:37:38] all the way back to john 13.
[1:37:41] when jesus knew that god had given all
[1:37:43] things into his hand
[1:37:45] and he come from god
[1:37:47] and he went to god
[1:37:48] he laid aside his garment
[1:37:50] he took a towel and he girded himself
[1:37:53] he poured a basin with water and he
[1:37:55] began to wash the disciples feet
[1:37:58] he had come to
[1:38:00] ultimate revelation and ultimate
[1:38:02] revelation put him in service for his
[1:38:04] brother brought him into humility
[1:38:06] to express the word of god
[1:38:10] see when we come into
[1:38:11] christlike ripeness
[1:38:14] brother ben says we're growing and
[1:38:15] ripening into christ-like fruit the
[1:38:17] light is at the top of the tree and it's
[1:38:19] not going to bring forth an arrogant
[1:38:22] showmanship
[1:38:25] an attitude of exaltation and
[1:38:28] self-exaltation that is not what this
[1:38:30] life is going to produce
[1:38:33] we've come to the revelation of who we
[1:38:34] are we come from god we go to god and
[1:38:36] god has made us joint heir of all things
[1:38:40] it doesn't bring a condescending
[1:38:42] attitude it doesn't bring a
[1:38:44] self-righteousness it doesn't bring an
[1:38:45] arrogance amen what it does when it
[1:38:48] ripens it ripens into christ like fruit
[1:38:50] bringing forth the same mellowness and
[1:38:52] sweetness
[1:38:54] and the same spirit that he had in him i
[1:38:57] hope you see it and i want to say i hope
[1:38:59] you see it
[1:39:01] i hope you see it all around you i hope
[1:39:03] you see it in the bride of jesus christ
[1:39:05] i hope you see it because if you don't
[1:39:06] see it we're looking at the wrong thing
[1:39:09] if we don't see it growing in our
[1:39:10] brothers and sisters we don't see this
[1:39:13] christ-like nature this humility this
[1:39:15] sweetness this gentleness this obedience
[1:39:17] to god this humility this desire to
[1:39:20] serve the word if we don't see it and of
[1:39:22] all we see is arrogance and contention
[1:39:26] i say god that's not the seed you
[1:39:29] planted
[1:39:30] but you planted a bride to be just like
[1:39:32] you
[1:39:34] you planted a bride to
[1:39:36] to be just like you amen the feminine
[1:39:39] version of you upon the earth
[1:39:42] and i want to drink the water
[1:39:44] i want to lay in the sun
[1:39:46] until it bakes out all the greenness and
[1:39:48] brings me to that ripe life
[1:39:50] what i saw on the prophet i want to see
[1:39:52] in me
[1:39:55] we saw miracles and signs and wonders i
[1:39:58] would love to see that daily
[1:40:00] in my life
[1:40:02] but if i had that and still had an
[1:40:04] arrogant spirit
[1:40:09] if i had all the signs and all the
[1:40:11] wonders and i still
[1:40:12] uh
[1:40:13] i was still bitter and harsh towards my
[1:40:16] brother and sister and i still was
[1:40:17] arrogant and rude and i had no humility
[1:40:19] and no sweetness i would say god take
[1:40:22] the gifts and give me your life
[1:40:24] your attitude your approach
[1:40:29] i want to live the way christ lived i
[1:40:32] want to live the way i saw him live in
[1:40:33] that prophet
[1:40:36] i want to grow up into that amen not
[1:40:39] i don't want to come like the rich young
[1:40:41] ruler
[1:40:42] i pay my tithes
[1:40:44] i've kept all the commandments
[1:40:48] see the rich young ruler he was trying
[1:40:51] to prove that he was a christian
[1:40:54] i paid my tithe
[1:40:56] i
[1:40:56] i i
[1:40:58] attend the church i've done all of
[1:41:00] the commandments
[1:41:02] and jesus says one thing that lack
[1:41:04] what did he lack
[1:41:06] he lacked a pure
[1:41:08] love for god
[1:41:11] when it comes down to it
[1:41:13] he says he says what must i have to have
[1:41:15] eternal life i mean that's the greatest
[1:41:17] thing ever he had everything else he had
[1:41:19] he had his religion in a bag and he had
[1:41:21] everything else he said what can i have
[1:41:23] to inherit eternal life he says one
[1:41:25] thing that lack is sell all that thou
[1:41:27] has
[1:41:28] given to the poor and come follow me
[1:41:31] and i shall have treasures in heaven
[1:41:33] and he went away greed because he had
[1:41:35] much treasures
[1:41:38] see what he lacked was a pure love for
[1:41:41] god
[1:41:42] he had religion
[1:41:44] he had a desire to serve god he wanted
[1:41:46] to look right he wanted to be right he
[1:41:48] wanted to make sure he was going to get
[1:41:49] eternal life he desired eternal life but
[1:41:51] he didn't desire god
[1:41:54] because if he wanted to know how to
[1:41:56] please god if god come and says this is
[1:41:59] how you please me sell everything he
[1:42:00] should have been thrilled
[1:42:02] that i got the answer from jesus christ
[1:42:04] he told me what i must do and if this is
[1:42:07] what god wants happy am i to do it for
[1:42:09] him
[1:42:13] i don't want to be like the rich young
[1:42:14] ruler lord i've paid my tithes and i've
[1:42:17] been faithful to the church and i listen
[1:42:19] to a tape every day
[1:42:23] but i want the genuineness of my heart
[1:42:26] i want the reality of the message in me
[1:42:29] i want to be whatever this message is
[1:42:31] supposed to be i want to be the example
[1:42:33] of that i want it to flow out of me i
[1:42:34] want it to live out of me i want to i
[1:42:36] want to grow into christ like fruit
[1:42:39] baked into the ripeness of the sweetness
[1:42:40] and melaness of the spirit
[1:42:45] when the people can look at you and they
[1:42:47] say well you know they may not know very
[1:42:49] much but they're sure are nice people
[1:42:53] do they know there's something different
[1:42:56] that is christ and they attracted to
[1:42:58] christ
[1:43:01] brother says
[1:43:02] in the message it is the rising of the
[1:43:04] sun and i want to finish with this quote
[1:43:06] it is the rising of the sun
[1:43:09] now the very essence of the message that
[1:43:11] was sent
[1:43:12] he is risen from the dead
[1:43:14] we his beneficiaries we
[1:43:16] who share the resurrection with him draw
[1:43:18] benefits from this
[1:43:20] by proving to the world that he is alive
[1:43:23] we cannot do it by word only we cannot
[1:43:25] do it by some tradition of man we only
[1:43:28] reflect exactly what we're pointing to
[1:43:32] that's the part i want to end with we
[1:43:34] only reflect exactly what we're pointing
[1:43:36] to
[1:43:39] if we don't like the reflection the
[1:43:41] question is what are we pointing to
[1:43:43] what are we focused on
[1:43:45] what do we focus our time and attention
[1:43:47] in our mind and our energies what are we
[1:43:49] what are we focused on are we focused on
[1:43:51] the right thing because if we get
[1:43:52] focused on the message it'll reflect
[1:43:55] if we get focused on other things it'll
[1:43:57] begin to reflect we say we only reflect
[1:43:59] exactly what we're
[1:44:01] pointing to
[1:44:03] i'm afraid today that too many of us are
[1:44:04] not getting people to christ
[1:44:06] we're getting them to a church to a
[1:44:08] theory but we must get them to christ
[1:44:10] he's the only one and the only one that
[1:44:12] was lot that has life he that has the
[1:44:15] son has life
[1:44:17] and in the life of a man that's dead be
[1:44:19] projected in you you will live the same
[1:44:21] life he lived
[1:44:23] oh that's the key friends
[1:44:26] yeah i want to do amen we want to do
[1:44:28] everything jesus christ did then we've
[1:44:30] got to be pointed to jesus christ
[1:44:33] the manifest word for this day
[1:44:37] same life he lived if the blood of a man
[1:44:39] was a certain type and you took the
[1:44:40] blood from one man and changed the blood
[1:44:42] of that one man into the other he would
[1:44:44] absolutely be that type blood and if
[1:44:46] your spirit that's in you is wrecking
[1:44:48] dead and you are anointed with the life
[1:44:49] that was in christ is upon you romans 8
[1:44:52] 11 said if the spirit that raised christ
[1:44:54] from the dead dwells in you it also
[1:44:56] quickens your mortal body
[1:44:58] that same life that same power is the
[1:45:00] same beneficiaries that he had here on
[1:45:02] earth from god he redeemed you and
[1:45:05] a seed that was foreknown by god whose
[1:45:08] name was put on the lamb's book of life
[1:45:10] before the foundation of the world
[1:45:13] if you want to if you don't like the
[1:45:15] reflection
[1:45:17] check at what you're pointing to
[1:45:21] this message will reflect the life of
[1:45:22] jesus christ
[1:45:25] this message we saw it in the prophet he
[1:45:27] reflected the life of jesus christ in
[1:45:29] his day
[1:45:30] but there's got to be a reflection in
[1:45:32] this day
[1:45:34] and this reflection is in the formation
[1:45:35] of the bride the many member bride
[1:45:37] reflecting the life of jesus christ how
[1:45:39] can she do it only when she's pointed at
[1:45:41] the right thing we've got to take the
[1:45:43] scare away of will i make it well i mean
[1:45:45] you've already made it
[1:45:47] you've already made it if you've heard
[1:45:49] from your theophany then you have a
[1:45:50] theophany you know what that means
[1:45:53] if you heard from your theophany then
[1:45:55] you have a theophany if you have a
[1:45:56] theophany you don't have anything else
[1:45:58] to worry about
[1:46:02] do you believe you've heard from your
[1:46:03] theophany then take the scare away there
[1:46:06] is no scare of not making it there is no
[1:46:08] scare of not being with god of not being
[1:46:10] raptured of not being redeemed that
[1:46:12] scare is now gone
[1:46:15] now that we take that pressure off it's
[1:46:17] not that i'm going to fail and god will
[1:46:18] never have me back and he's not going to
[1:46:20] rapture me because i messed up the other
[1:46:21] day listen i already heard from my
[1:46:23] theophany meaning i have a theophany
[1:46:25] he's not going to look at my theophany
[1:46:26] because i messed up and say you get out
[1:46:28] of here
[1:46:31] you say funny it's a joke we laugh but
[1:46:34] listen that the reality of it god
[1:46:36] already has this secure he already
[1:46:38] understands he's not going to lose
[1:46:40] himself
[1:46:41] so all this fear of i'll make a mistake
[1:46:43] or i'll believe something wrong or i'll
[1:46:44] go the wrong direction listen those are
[1:46:46] all legitimate fears and if that happens
[1:46:48] you will suffer for it
[1:46:50] but theophany's going nowhere
[1:46:54] it's not getting kicked out of heaven
[1:46:56] you're not losing your predestinated
[1:46:57] position you have a connection with god
[1:47:02] take our eyes off of the scary talk amen
[1:47:04] and now it's not up to us to protect
[1:47:06] ourselves in this dark age it's going to
[1:47:08] get darker friends it's not up to us to
[1:47:10] prepare it's not up to us to make our
[1:47:12] own way but we're to be like the
[1:47:14] sparrows
[1:47:17] we're to be like the lily
[1:47:19] and say i have a
[1:47:20] father and it doesn't matter how bad it
[1:47:24] gets and how rotten the government
[1:47:25] becomes and how much pressure comes i
[1:47:27] have a father and what you do can you
[1:47:30] can never do anything to me unless it's
[1:47:32] given to you from above
[1:47:36] jesus could walk wherever god led him to
[1:47:38] walk because he had a father
[1:47:40] he didn't have to worry about his
[1:47:41] provisions he didn't have to worry about
[1:47:42] to do what to do once he got there he
[1:47:44] didn't have to have an escape plan or
[1:47:46] plan b
[1:47:48] he just went as he was led because he
[1:47:50] had a father who would do the rest amen
[1:47:52] and we have a father in this day and we
[1:47:54] don't have to worry about preparing for
[1:47:56] ourselves or protecting ourselves or
[1:47:58] having a safe haven
[1:48:00] you don't need a bunker house in new
[1:48:01] zealand amen you need to be in the tower
[1:48:04] of the word of god and jesus christ
[1:48:07] that's the tower that the righteous run
[1:48:08] into in our save
[1:48:10] we need to make sure our bunker's secure
[1:48:12] what is our function it's the word it's
[1:48:14] the word that's been given to us in this
[1:48:15] hour amen it's our it's our bomb shelter
[1:48:18] friends
[1:48:21] and then we need to drink in the word
[1:48:23] and grow
[1:48:24] and grow
[1:48:26] take away all the fear and all the worry
[1:48:28] all the strain to be something i'm not
[1:48:30] to have to measure to this measuring
[1:48:31] stick throw it all away how can you
[1:48:33] measure higher than a theophany in the
[1:48:35] presence of god
[1:48:39] throw it away
[1:48:41] all the need to be something make
[1:48:43] yourself suddenly prepare for something
[1:48:44] protect yourself throw it away
[1:48:47] and then let the peace of god that
[1:48:48] passes all understanding in your heart
[1:48:51] and with love in your heart feed on this
[1:48:53] word with everything you've got
[1:48:56] and this word will produce exactly
[1:48:59] what's already in the word to produce
[1:49:02] what's in you and the message has been
[1:49:04] given to this hour are going to
[1:49:07] interlock
[1:49:09] there are two pieces of the chinese
[1:49:11] laundry ticket
[1:49:13] and when they come together it'll
[1:49:15] produce the life of jesus christ for
[1:49:17] this hour
[1:49:18] we need to forget about all the noise
[1:49:21] forget about all the churchianity and
[1:49:23] all the religion and get down to just
[1:49:25] loving our husband the revealed word of
[1:49:27] the eye
[1:49:29] and let that
[1:49:31] change us
[1:49:32] mold us
[1:49:34] make us what we need to be
[1:49:36] let's all stand
[1:49:38] musicians if you'll come brother ben if
[1:49:39] you'll come
[1:49:45] see there was a woman at the well one
[1:49:47] time
[1:49:48] she didn't have any answers
[1:49:51] the samaritan woman her life was a wreck
[1:49:54] she didn't have a lot of answers
[1:49:56] she didn't have a good reputation she
[1:49:58] really didn't have anything going for
[1:50:00] her that would make her a child of god
[1:50:02] and a representative of god on the earth
[1:50:04] but what she did have was representation
[1:50:06] in heaven
[1:50:09] she didn't even have a husband that was
[1:50:10] her own she was on her six and it wasn't
[1:50:12] her own
[1:50:13] she didn't have a good reputation a good
[1:50:15] life she didn't have theology she may
[1:50:17] not have been able to read or write we
[1:50:18] don't know
[1:50:19] she could even go to the well at the
[1:50:21] time of the day when the respectable
[1:50:22] women go she had to go at a different
[1:50:24] time of day
[1:50:25] she as far as earthly things go she had
[1:50:28] nothing
[1:50:30] but the one thing she had was something
[1:50:31] that no pharisee could make himself have
[1:50:35] she had representation in heaven
[1:50:37] and that representation in heaven knew
[1:50:39] how to trigger a revelation in her heart
[1:50:41] and you know what that little eagle was
[1:50:44] trying to live in a chicken yard trying
[1:50:46] to you know she didn't know if the
[1:50:47] samaritans had the right religion or the
[1:50:48] jews had the right religion but when she
[1:50:50] saw a prophetic gift come on the scene
[1:50:53] all of a sudden you you realize by
[1:50:55] reading the story that that little seed
[1:50:57] was thirsty
[1:51:00] as soon as he says uh uh you know you've
[1:51:03] had five and the one you're living with
[1:51:04] is not your own
[1:51:06] she says i perceive you to be a prophet
[1:51:09] she says
[1:51:11] in this mountain is where our fathers
[1:51:12] say we should worship
[1:51:15] she didn't say do you think i could ever
[1:51:17] be saved do you think god would accept
[1:51:18] me because i've had so many husbands
[1:51:20] there was something deeper than that
[1:51:23] there was something down on the inside
[1:51:25] that wanted god amen and wanted to
[1:51:27] worship god and wanted to know how to
[1:51:29] get to god they said our father is
[1:51:30] saying this mountain you say in
[1:51:32] jerusalem and he says woman the time
[1:51:34] cometh and now is
[1:51:36] for the father is seeking such that will
[1:51:38] worship him in spirit and in truth amen
[1:51:41] and all of a sudden all she wants is
[1:51:42] this water she wants this life she wants
[1:51:44] what this man is talking about
[1:51:47] she could never have produced a pharisee
[1:51:49] life
[1:51:51] but a pharisee life could have never got
[1:51:53] her revelation
[1:51:56] you may not in your own self have been
[1:51:58] able to produce the perfect life and the
[1:52:00] perfect upbringing the perfect situation
[1:52:02] amen but those who've had a perfect life
[1:52:04] and a perfect religion and god all the
[1:52:06] t's crossed and the eyes dotted they may
[1:52:08] not be able to get the revelation you
[1:52:10] can get amen it's not you press your way
[1:52:12] into it it just comes you just say
[1:52:13] that's the truth
[1:52:16] you've heard from your theophany amen
[1:52:18] amen i saw all of you over there amen
[1:52:25] you know what let that revelation
[1:52:27] change your life
[1:52:30] let that seed on the inside grow and
[1:52:32] take over and let that seed bear fruit
[1:52:36] feed it
[1:52:38] point to christ
[1:52:39] stay in the word and let the word
[1:52:41] produce the life let's bow our heads and
[1:52:45] pray lord jesus

[1:52:49] confidence you give us this day

[1:53:15] called for us in this day

[1:53:32] worrying about the other or trying to
[1:53:34] prove something to one group and
[1:53:35] something to another but let us just
[1:53:38] dive into your word and surrender to you
[1:53:39] and let you have your own way in us
[1:53:42] and by preeminence lord may you live
[1:53:44] your own life through us
