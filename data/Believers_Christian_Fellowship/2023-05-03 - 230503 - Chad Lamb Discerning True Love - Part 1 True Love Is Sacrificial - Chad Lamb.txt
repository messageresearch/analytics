========================================

Matthew 23 verse 5 Jesus is speaking now the Pharisees he says but all their Works they do for to be seen of men they make broader phylacteries they enlarge the borders of their garments they love the uppermost rooms that feast and the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets and to be called meant by of men Rabbi Rabbi these men look like they love God but they really love themselves and they go through all of these uh rituals and all of these laws and all of this stuff so that they can prove to the people that they love God but really Jesus is Discerning their love they don't love God they love themselves they love the position it puts them in the esteem that they get from people in the respect that's what they're loving and unfortunately and sadly this is what religion is really like people are religious for all kinds of reasons amen but the number one reason for religion is that people love themselves because it serves them somehow their religion is serving them somehow and whatever they get out of it amen either clear from a guilty conscience or respect from somebody or love from a family member whatever reason they'll dive into religion Amen in this religion amen looks like they love God but really they love themselves true yeah this is why no matter how much you show the truth of the word to people they won't leave their religion because the relief of religion would cause a personal sacrifice they would have to sacrifice themselves to leave their tradition and in leaving the tradition they would lose Association they would lose respect they would look bad in the eyes of people they would look like a heretic or you're following a false prophet or or you're mixed up with a cult you're you're this you're that you're the other and people won't leave the religion because the religion is serving self no matter how much you show baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right out of the word no matter how much you show them amen that the trinitarian idea is wrong no matter how much you show by the word they can see it amen they will agree with you and then when they go to their Pastor or go to their church and they're going to be rejected for that word they reject the word and stay with the religion perverted love if loving God with a perverted love but a pure love would say if that's the truth if that's the truth if that's what God Said Amen if that's what God wants and that's what God requires where can I get baptized amen all friends forsake you your church think you've gone off the deep end they no longer consider you a Christian they are no longer consider you in the way of Truth they've lost respect for co-workers lose respect but it doesn't matter because the recipient of my love is worth my personal sacrifice it's worth me losing my reputation losing my Association losing everything because the recipient of my love is worth My Sacrifice but if we're not willing to become the sacrifice then we don't love the object of our love we love ourselves it's Boomerang love I only give love because I want love
