bless you all this evening let's bow our heads together dear Lord Jesus we're so thankful father for another opportunity to come together Lord and we've set aside this time and dedicated this place and dedicated this time to fellowship with you to commune with you Lord God we've come with expectation in our hearts Lord to hear from you and God we need you Lord we need you to constantly care for us and feed us and te teach us and instruct us we're hungry for more of your word and we pray God that you would come and break the bread of life and use this vessel of clay here use it as a tool Lord and may I step to the side and you take control for our confidence is in you Lord and we come according to your word and your will we ask God that now you would just feed us pray you take preeminence Among Us Lord and may all we say and do be pleasing to you may we continue to move further Lord in your program and in your will and Lord in your desire for you have a plan for us Lord and that's what we come to align ourselves with tonight is with your plan with your vision so we can go step in step with in harmony with that plan we love you and we ask you would bless all that's said and done in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you all while you're standing if you would like to take your Bibles with me we'll turn to the book of Ephesians and um earlier today sister Jade Lyn was released and so so it's really exciting I think she's with her family this evening but we hope to see her uh this Sunday but there was a group who gathered together to go down there to welcome her when she got out and so I just want to say thank you to all you who braved the weather and traveled down I know brother Nate and sister Mana went down and several others so God bless you all and thank you for doing that for her she was quite surprised and so I'm excited to see her hopefully we get to see her this weekend and uh it's a good day amen it's cold windy a little bit snowy but it's a good day amen warm nonetheless so we thankful for God for that let's look here at Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 Ephesians 1 verse4 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which dra on Earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ amen God bless you as you take your seats and keep this scripture open we're going to look at it again so we see that that uh we're going to continue on with the message of adoption uh last Sunday we talked about about the father's responsibility in adoption and that's what we're seeing here again that uh that God Almighty had a predestinated plan and it was according to the good pleasure of his will according to his desire according to his plan what he wanted and we're just so thankful that's what he wanted amen we find ourselves the recipient we find ourselves part of his predestinated plan and all we can say back to him is thank you almighty God Amen but there was one one part in here that I want to go back and look at again if we could go back to uh uh verse 7 let's go back to verse 7 we just read a couple verses here in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein Heath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself in the adoption series brother brenon preaches in 1960 preaches four parts on adoption and he comes to this part and he and he did something with this scripture that I really liked he read in this scripture he says having made known unto us the mystery of his will amen and there's two ways to look at this you can say he made known unto us the mystery of his will that he was going to do all this work in Christ and that's true and that's wonderful and he's revealed that what the work of Christ was going to be from before the foundation of the world and that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world and that through his blood we have found forgiveness of sins that's true but what brother bandham does in the adoption series is he makes it personal and he says having made known unto us the mystery of his will his will concerning our part in this program making known to us the mystery of his will not just what he was going to do for everybody else not just how he was going to redeem but the mystery of his will concerning me in these scriptures and Me In Christ and me in adoption amen and the question is has he revealed to you the mystery of his will amen has he revealed to you you the mystery of his will not just revealed his will but as he revealed to you the mystery of his will if so you find yourself Amen in his plan of adoption in his predestinated plan saying thank you God Almighty I'm so thankful that you've made known unto us personally the mystery of your will concerning us amen so last Sunday was the uh responsibility of the father in adoption and tonight I would just like to talk about the responsibility of the adopted so they have the responsibility of the father in adoption but what's the responsibility of those who are adopted amen and we know after going through uh uh the study that we did on Sunday that that adoption is positional placing it's taking a son who and we're talking Old Testament uh uh adoption now our adoption is the way brother brandham taught it as was done by the Greeks and by the Romans and the in the uh Biblical times he takes that adoption and that adoption is is an adoption of somebody who's already a child they're already born into a family but they come to a level of maturity where they can be positionally placed in the family and a place of responsibility or maybe responsibility over all the estate or responsibility over part of the estate but they're placed in the family given responsibility and they have and they have full sway in that area of responsibility that's the adoption that brother B's talking about that's the adoption that Galatians is speaking of and so now when want to look at what's the responsibility of those who are adopted those who've come to that position and I'd like to look at it through the Exodus Journey for tonight if we can so if you could turn back with me to the Book of Exodus and we're not uh we don't intend to take a long time tonight because we want to stay true to our our desire to not go too long but you know we'll do what we can do we just pray that God has his way amen so in Exodus 3: 7 he's speaking to Moses here in Exodus 3: 7 and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and a large and to a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel has come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians have oppressed them come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt so God is going to come down now to fulfill the promise that he gave to Abraham and he promised Abraham that his children should inherit the land the land was given to Abraham and the inheritance was for for Abraham's seed and now they're trapped in bondage which God had prophesied they would be there but he would bring them out with a mighty hand now when it's time for God to bring them out in The Exodus Journey he sends Moses he says I've come down to deliver them now come I'm sending you and God was right there working with Moses and through Moses in that Ministry delivering his children amen and then we see in The Exodus Journey as they the children of Israel were were receiving their Deliverance amen through this messenger through this uh Prophet that God had sent to them amen everything was being done by the Prophet The Prophet was fulfilling the prophecies he was bringing deliverance and that's the vessel that God was using in that day but everything was being done through Moses I mean the plagues were coming through Moses everything was happening Moses was speaking to Pharaoh Moses was bringing the plagues Moses was calling for flies Moses was turning the water into blood uh Moses was doing it all amen and the children of Israel weren't doing anything and then they came out with a mighty hand they were sent out by pharaoh and they go out and they they've spoiled the Egyptians and they go out and then they come to their first real test at the Red Sea when they're wedged into the Red Sea and hemmed in with no Escape Route and the army of pharaoh comes down they begin to cry and complain to Pharaoh amen it's interesting not to pharaoh to Moses it's interesting because Moses did everything now when they get in trouble they start complaining against Moses and and we we've said this before but we'll say it again they're standing there at the edge of the Red Sea they and their children and all their family have fine silk garments chains around their necks gold and all the gold they can pack because Egypt's just been destroyed amen they they're now spoiling Egypt they've got all all the gold and all the coins and all the jewelry and all the garments and all the vessels that they can possibly carry and they're standing here with all this loot where they've just looted Egypt and now because they're at the Red Sea and they're coming they forgot all that happened amen they start crying out to Moses look what you've done you've brought us out here to be killed and all of these things happen and then Moses turns to the Red Sea and he cries out to God and God says why cry cries unto me speak that the children moved forward and he raised his rod and and parted the waters and they went across on dry ground and this is how The Exodus journey goes they go a little ways and they finally come to the the the bitter Waters and the bitter Waters now they have nothing to drink and they begin to murmur and complain who do they murmur and complain against Moses because obviously Moses is doing everything so every every success we see Moses doing every failure is Moses's fault too because Moses has to take care of us so he cuts a branch throws it in the water turns the bitter water swe s they move on they run out of bread when they run out of bread who do they cry against Moses who calls unto God and brings them bread and Mana from Heaven Moses then they they get hungry for meat they cry against Moses and Moses cries to God and that now Mana comes they get thirsty again amen and now he brings water from the rock it's it's this way all down through the Exodus Journey they're dependent upon Moses for everything and I would like to look at Exodus 17 we'll just turn there and I want to show this as an example Exodus 17 and let's start with verse eight says then came amalec and fought with Israel and riid them and Moses said unto Joshua choose us out men and go out fight with amalec to tomorrow tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand so Joshua did as Moses had said to him and fought with amalec and Moses Aaron and her went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that Israel prevailed and when he let down his hand AMC prevailed but moses' hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon and Aaron and her stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the Sun and Joshua discomforted amalec and his people with the edge of the sword so we see this story where amalec comes out to fight him they go to fight against them amen but Moses goes to the top of the hill with the rod of God and he holds up as long as moses' hands are extended they're winning the battle the minute his hands begin to drop amalec begins to overcome them in the battle so even their Victory on the battlefield is completely dependent on the strength of Moses they're dependent on the position Moses with the rod am mean everything is based on the strength and position of Moses when Moses falters they falter when Moses rises again they rise again until they finally set him down and prop up his hands so that they can win the victory but it's completely dependent upon Moses amen but before they go into the promised land which is their inheritance which when they come into their adoption when their positionally placed under Joshua Ministry in the promised land that is the adoption of Israel so God has rescued the them and brought them out of Egypt to bring them to adoption which is what positional placing so on the way to positional placing God brings them all along the journey amen till they come to Jordan till they come to the time to cross over and just before they cross over God does something that's very important when it comes to adoption he removes Moses because they were dependent upon Moses for everything but when they cross into the land it's going to be different than the way it was in The Exodus Journey God is looking for a different manifestation this is a different phase of the journey now the Israelites themselves are moving into an adopted position a positional placing in the inheritance of God and God Amen in his Sovereign Grace he takes Moses away amen so he can bring them to a higher position he can position them in what he had thought of them before the foundation of the world and the place where he wanted to place them amen let's go to Deuteronomy now Deuteronomy chapter 11 Deuteronomy 11 verse 8 this is Moses giving instructions again to the nation of Israel and he says therefore it's 11:8 therefore shall you keep all the Commandments which I command you this day that you may be strong and go in and possess the land whether you go to possess it and that you may prolong your days in the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers to give unto them to their seed a land that floweth with milk and honey for the land whether thou goest in to possess it is not as the land of Egypt from whence you came out where thou seest the seed and wat it with the foot as a garden of herbs but the land whether thou go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys of drinking water and of rain and of Heaven let's skip down to verse 22 for if you shall diligently keep all these Commandments which I command you to do them to love the Lord your God to walk in all of his ways and to cleave unto him then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you and you shall possess greater Nations and mightier than yourselves every place wherein The Souls of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the Wilderness and Lebanon from the river the Riv Euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall your Coast be there shall no man be able to stand before you for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon as he hath said unto you so as Moses gives him the instructions he also gives him the promise he said you're going to a land that's flowing with milk and honey and he says this you're going to possess it uh I love the terminology and I I just just just stay with with me for a minute he says you're going to possess it the land you go to possess not the land you go to inhabit the land you go to possess the whole thing is talking about a possession because they're going to have to go possess this land they're going to have to go take this land and he said everywhere the souls you feat shall tread that have I given to you and this is where brother Bram comes with the statement footsteps are possession amen God says I've given it to you when you take it I've given it to you when you possess it you're going in to possess it I'll drive back the inhabitant when you go to possess it I'll put the fear and dread of them when you go to possess it but there's a stipulation here I'll drive them back when you go to possess it amen it'll become yours when you walk upon it remember they're coming to adoption to positional placing amen now let's go to Joshua Joshua chapter 1 because Joshua is going to reiterate this to the Jews just before they go in Joshua chapter 1 so that's moses' instructions now we're here uh uh at the banks of Jordan and getting ready to cross into the land Moses is gone and Joshua now is is is going to lead them in Joshua 1 vers one now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses's Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go go over this Jordan thou and all this people and the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given to you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even into the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake be strong and of good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest now verse 10 then Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying pass through the host and command the people saying prepare you V viddles for within 3 days you shall pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it so now God speaks to Joshua and he brings the commission to Joshua what Moses had already instructed Israel he re he reiterates it to Joshua and he's saying the the where the souls of your feet shall go I have given it to you and then Joshua tells the people to prepare yourself to go over Jordan Amen to possess the land to possess the land so their their instructions are to go over Jordan to possess the land all right in adoption part one this is the adoption series we've been talking about from 1960 says our Ephesians are Joshua which is the holy spirit Joshua means Jesus Savior it means Jehovah savior it's the same Jesus and Joshua are the same word amen uh uh uh ones in the Old Testament ones in the New Testament but they have the same meaning Joshua means Jes Jesus Savior Jehovah savior Joshua means the Holy Spirit representing it in the spiritual as they was in the natural that he is our great warrior he is our great leader as God was with Joshua so God and in the Holy Spirit moving us about so now as they go to possess the land God has taken the prophet away but now Joshua the Holy Ghost is going to lead them in to the inheritance into the promise into what the prophet had led them to now the holy spirit is going to lead them into it divide it up amongst them and have them possess it and he divided to them the inheritance according to what Moses had already constructed him and he did it according to the word of Moses he didn't do it any ways different than what the prophet has said and this Holy Ghost is when as he's as he's dividing the land he's doing it exactly according to the instructions of the Prophet according to the prophet's Vision according to the word of God through the prophet and now he's here to make sure that the people get their portion amen make sure he leads them into that and he tells them this is where you belong and this is where you belong and this is where you belong and brother bham said that's the work of the Holy Ghost in the church today to give gifts and give callings and positionally place Us in the body of Christ his job is to say you belong here and lead you to your position and you belong here and I've called you for this and I've gifted you with this and I'm using you for this that's the work of the Holy Ghost that's the Joshua Ministry placing Us in the body placing Us in the land Amen to possess it amen praise God but brother B says it and this is interesting the way he goes through this in adoption because he's typing he he through much of the adoption he's typing the entrance to the promised land with adoption with our adoption in the placing in the church and he's going all through there and tying it together and he says positionally placing the church where they belong each one how we're called by the adoption God has adopted us to the to Sons we are Sons by birth adopted and positionally placed by the Holy Spirit look they were everyone Hebrews when they crossed that River but Joshua divided the land and give each one his land according to the utterance of his mother at his birth where the Holy Spirit told her oh so interesting I love the way brother Benham says that and I don't even know if I fully understand what he's saying but but there's a portion of it that come alive to me he says again and whyatt had to be Shepherds from 64 he said there's a great lesson that time I hope to be able to bring at this at Tucson of those Hebrew mothers giving birth to those babies when she groaned at the birth pain of the baby she called the name of the baby and that positionally placed it in the promised land its tribe so now all the sudden it is as the mothers and the Hebrew mothers are groaning under the birth pains to bring forth this child it's birthed to a position it's born for a position and that position is determined by what tribe it's born in so the tribe it's born I don't know exactly what she uttered but the name of the tribe would have always been part of the uhh uh part of the utterance for the child it's born into a certain tribe into a certain family and a certain strain and it dictates where it belongs in the land by where by by its birth amen and listen our birth dictates where we belong in the land as well because we're not born under the Methodist Revival we're not born under the Pentecost but we're born under the message of the hour and that position positions us in our tribe in the land under our messenger for our day to position us where back to the full inheritance of the full word praise be to God and the Holy Ghost is putting them in place according to their birth they were ordained to a place we are also ordained to a place let's go to Joshua chapter 5 Joshua chapter 5 and verse 10 and the children of Israel encamped in gilgal and kept the Passover on the 14th day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho they did eat of the old corner of the land on the tomorrow after the Passover Passover unleavened cakes and parch corn in the selfsame day and the Mana ceased on the marrow after they had eaten of the old old corn of the land neither had the children of Israel Mana anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year what a what a statement they had all along the Wilderness Journey remember in the wilderness Journey Moses did everything is that right and they had Mana that fell every night and every morning they would go and gather up the supply for that day and water was provided and Direction was provided instruction was provided judgment the settling of disputes everything was provided by Moses but when they crossed over Jordan amen the next day the Mana ceased there's no more Mana it's time to grow up friends this is adoption time amen he's not going to be babied or petted anymore now it's time to possess the land and it says then they ate of the old corn uh old corn of the land when they spped in and took possession of the land it had fruits amen and it had crops amen they ate those crops and what a jubilee that was they had parched corn that means they had barley they had they had the fruit off the trees they had whatever vegetables were coming up in the garden as they drove the inhabitants they ate of the land that year and that was a wonderful year that was a jubilee it was a Revival they had stepped into the word but guess what it stopped that year the next year if they wanted parched corn and they wanted fruit if they wanted figs they were going to have to plant seeds and they were going to have to keep the land because they were moving into adoption to where they had to till the land totally different phase of the journey now they're coming into adoption if they want to eat parched corn they're going to have to plant barle right they're going to have to keep the cattle off The Barley they're going to have to keep enemies away they're going to have to make sure it's cultivated make sure it grows they're going to have to grow whatever other crops they want to grow if they want wine they have to tend The Vineyards they've got to do the work because now we've moved into adoption God's taken Moses away now it's not now it's not even Joshua was not going to plant your garden Joshua was going to tell you where your garden is but you're going to plant your garden Joshua was going to tell you your portion your place your gift where you belong in the body but Joshua is not going to come along and do all the work for you Joshua is going to instruct you on where you belong but once you belong there it's up to you to work that piece of land this is the responsibility of the adopted amen praise God remember Moses told them the Lord your God is leading you to a land that flows with milk and honey we remember we talked about this a couple years ago we preached on it it's quite humorous when you think about it because you can you imagine Crossing Jordan and running up to the first little stream you see and peeking over and there's no milk but the land flows with milk and honey you hear about a spring over the brook over the hill you go over the hill you go to a spring it's bubbling up and you expect to find honey and all it is is water a land flowing with milk and honey shows that the milk and honey the potential is in the land the land is a fruitful land it's got land for grazing it's got flowers you so you can have bees so you can make honey so you can graze uh your you can graze your cow you can graze your goat so that you can get your milk so when he says you're taking you to a land that flows with milk and honey he's not taking them to a place where they go out every morning and take their little Tin Cup and they scoop up some milk right out of the stream and they drink it with their bread it's not like that the milk and Honey's in the land but they've got to work the land to get the milk and honey out of the land because this is adoption praise God when the when the boy we talked about Sunday when the boy is under the tutelage of the Holy Ghost and he's being raised and taught and trained how to be and managed like his father how to think and interact and and make decisions like the father would and he finally comes to a time of adoption and the father adopts him and he gives him a portion or he gives him all or whatever he wants to give him of the estate and he says now says he's adopted into the family he got rights what he says go and I've given him this responsibility when the father gives him that responsibility amen when he brings him to adoption and gives him that responsibility he's telling them I trust you to go make decisions you've been tested you've been proved you've come to adoption amen so stop bothering me with what I you should do every decision make some decisions manage the portion I gave you to manage I trust you to do it I've brought you to this I've trained you for this you've matured into this this is for you to do amen am amen adoption isn't this place of privilege that we come to where all of a sudden everything's easy everything's kosher no adoption is a higher level of responsibility not a not a cozy comfy position adoption now is you have to make the decisions you decide what to plant you decide when to sell you decide how to do and then you have to live with your decisions when it comes to adoption we have to get to the place where we understand that I'm responsible for a few things in life if I'm a man with a family I'm responsible for my family if God's given me a gift I'm responsible to minister that gift there's places and positions we're responsible for those positions and if I take responsibility for that position I can't keep looking to Moses say Moses you tell me what to do Moses you do this and Moses you do that because all I'm trying to do is find somebody to take responsibility for me so if it doesn't work out I have somebody to blame that's not how it works friends God has asked us to take some responsibility God has asked us to come to maturity so what so that we can act like him on this Earth amen so that we can get some obstacles and and difficult situation so that we can make decisions according to his word to do what he would do in that situation and when we blow it and when we mess up because we've come to adoption we've come to adoption and we've been given the ring we've been given the checkbook we've been given the responsibility we've been given the authority now when we make a poor decision and blow it now we can't say well Moses well Moses is gone amen Moses didn't make that decision you did you can't say well Josh no no no this is you now and your inheritance now you have to say say I messed up that's what the adopted son has to do he has to say I messed this up this is all me but because I'm responsible I'll fix it God Amen this is spiritual maturity friends not everything that happens we just blame somebody else it's their fault no this is God gave me a right to make a decision he gave me a place in a position and I blew it I blew it with my family I got mad the other day and my wife I I I sniffed at the kids I did I blew it that was my fault I'm not blaming anybody else it's my fault yes but it's also my responsibility to make it right so I'm going to fix it if I planted the wrong crop and the wrong season and we all and my and my Harvest failed that means next year I'm going to have to plant the right crop in the right season and hopefully learn from my mistake but it's my responsibility am amen amen praise God you know it seems to me like we always want the Privileges but we never want the responsibility everybody wants privileges like kids always want privileges of getting older the privilege of driving the privilege of this the privilege of staying up till 10:00 we want the privilege es but we always we don't always want the responsibility that comes along with the Privileges amen oh praise God I want to move on brother Brenham says and this is the message the son of David have mercy on me th son of David have mercy on me from 1961 he said God told them way down in Egypt I give you that land but he didn't say I'll go out there and sweep it all out and garnish the houses and hang up the curtains and everything you all just move in no no they had to fight for every inch of ground they took that's right fighting and take it by every fight every inch he but he said everywhere The Souls of your foot land that's possession footsteps is possession that's the same thing it is today Divine Healing belongs to us the Holy Spirit belongs to us it's our property but you'll fight every inch of it you mean Divine Healing belongs to me but I've got to fight to enter into Divine Healing you mean it's not just simple it's not just no friends we got to press into these things sometimes but he says it belongs to you but you'll fight uh every inch of it yes sir but brother footsteps is possession just keep fighting take it the devil say the days of Miracles has passed you say you're a liar God said he's the same yesterday today and forever take it over everywhere your footsteps that's possession that's right amen deny the lies of the devil and bring the word resist the devil and he will flee who resist you resist amen don't ask everybody else to resist for you this is your land your inheritance your word and our inheritance is this word that's been given to us and we're here to fully possess every word that's what we're here to do not asking everybody else will you press will you press I mean there's times we need prayer support there's times we need help we need a body and there was times when they moved in to the promised land amen that sometimes the enemy was a little too much for them and there was a time in the scriptures in the Book of Judges where the enemy was a bit too much for One Tribe and they asked Judah to come help and Judah came and helped and they pushed him back and once Judah pushed him back Judah went back to his land and then this tribe continued to work their land and drive out the inhabitants there are times that we need help but there no there's no time that we ever go on vacation and ask Judah to clean them off and when you get it all situated we'll come back no friends sometimes we help one another but we've got to be the one driving back the enemy we've got to be the one resisting the devil cuz the promise is resist the devil and he shall flee that's something for us to do Amen in the message the comforter this is where he says the word is our inheritance said I live by the word Jesus said it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and this is it and that is given to us as a Heritage it's our inheritance the word amen so what is Our Land what is our what is our what is our inheritance it's this word that's been delivered to us and just like for Israel in The Exodus when they all moved into their portion they were all there to subdue the land and bring the land under control of God and under the word of God because God had given Moses instructions on how to live upon the land Moses told him every seven years have a rest he told them what to do for the years of Jubilee He told them how to bring a tithe he told them how to worship God he told them the feast to keep he told them how to how to resolve differences he told them how to set up the priesthood he told them how to deal with each other in neighborly ways amen Moses gave the word concerning their life in the land and now it was their job to bring that word to life in this land amen and they were each one responsible for it because everybody had to keep their part of the word to bring that land which was not hittite land and Canaanite land neither was it Israel land it was God's land God said this is my land but I've given it to you to possess and so who were they possessing it for they were possessing it for God Amen and what were they supposed to do they were supposed to bring bring that land subdued and subjection to the word of God that was their goal that was what they were supposed to do Amen brother bam said in the message perseverance said but every promise in the Bible is yours but you'll have to fight every devil guard away from it with a two-edged sword and claim it for yourself be persistent walk right into it man let's go back to Joshua here and look at Joshua chapter 10 together and before we read the the scripture I want to read I want to remind you of the scripture in Exodus do you remember in Exodus in Deuteronomy When God says I'm taking you to the land but I will drive out the inhabitants I will fight and you'll possess the land and your foot steps or possession amen it's we're going to see a manifestation of that now but but also when in The Exodus Journey when am uh amalec came out to fight them remember we looked at the scripture where when Moses had his hands up they prevailed but when Moses hands dropped it was all dependent on Moses well now we've entered into the land here in Joshua 10 and they're beginning to drive back enemies and Moses isn't there so now their Victory is not dependent on Moses holding up the rod anymore and so now the promises of God are taking effect in their lives personally and I want to look at uh verse 7 let's go to chapter 10 ver 7 says so Joshua ascended from gilgal he and all the people of war with him and all the Mighty Men of Valor and the Lord said unto Joshua fear them not for I have delivered them un thy hand there shall not a man of them stand before thee Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from gilgal all night and the Lord discomforted them before Israel and slew them with a great Slaughter at gibian and chased them along the way that that goeth up to bethon and smokee them to ezeka and then to mad and it came to pass as they fled from before Israel and we're going down to Beth Haron that the Lord cast down great stones from Heaven upon them unto azaka and they died they were and there were more which died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword you know what's beautiful about this is God's fighting right alongside them amen they're cutting some down and he's stoning some from Heaven amen and God's doing more than they are this is what he promised he God didn't say I'll go do it all for you neither did he said you'll do it all by yourself but he says you possess it and I'll drive them out you make footsteps and I'll give it to you amen and God is working with his people amen and they're taking the land they're driving back back the inhabitants and they're slaying him with the sword and he's throwing down stones from Heaven at him praise be to God I believe that God still can work that way with us friends but we got to have confidence and not sit back on our heels and do nothing about it and say God you do God you do God you do no God says you do you do you do and I believe when we get into action and have faith in God that God will fight with us and for us and before us and behind us and all around us but we've got to be fighting friends we've got be taking the word and applying the word we've got to be resisting everything that comes against the word whether it's inside of us or outside of us we've got to resist whatever is hindering the word of God Amen so now God's throwing down Stones I love it I love that scripture I I just read that today over and over and got super excited when I read that how' you like to know you're in the midst of a battle and you're doing all you can and you're Swinging The Sword of the word as hard as you can amen and you you feel the battle hot and heavy and you're doing you're giving it you're all and all a sudden you're th th th th th th th and you say oh God's over there wiping them out praise be to God you think it doesn't give you courage and energy to keep going when you've pressed and pressed but you see God do that little something special and he moved that obstacle you couldn't move amen you were there moving everything else you could move but God did the thing you couldn't do praise be to God let's go back here to pick it up in verse 12 verse 12 then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel son stand thou still upon gibian and thou moon in the valley of aelon and the sun Stood Still and the moon stayed until the people had Avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the book of jasher so the son stood still in the mid of heaven and hastened not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like that before it or after it that the Lord hearkened into the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel this become astounding to me because when they fought the uh uh amalec the amalekites amen Moses was the one holding his hand and where however Moses hands went the the battle went they were out there doing all they could but it was dependent completely upon Moses but now amen we find out that now God is fighting with his people all the people they're all fighting they're all Swinging The Sword and God's fighting with them but they get to a place amen where God has commissioned them to possess the land and drive out the inhabitants and slay them all and they're doing the work of God Amen but they're running out of time and Joshua isn't looking around for somebody else to come and help him Joshua says son you got to stand still Moon I need more time to do what God has called me to do and listen he doesn't speak and say God you just wipe out the rest of them no he knew that was his job to do that was what God told him to do amen what he needed was more time to do what God called him to do he wasn't asking God to do for him what God gave him to do what he was saying was in order for me to do what God told me to do and stay in the word and program of God I'm going to do what he told me to do but I need the sun to stand still I got to have some more time and the sun stood till still till they finished avenging themselves of their enemy that means they kept slaying and kept slaying and kept slaying and kept slaying they didn't sit back and say oh well that works than God you do no listen there's things in this life that God's asked us to do and so many times we want God to do it amen but there's times in doing what God's called us to do and giving it all we got there's an obstacle that's preventing us oh I believe if we're in God's Commission in God's word in our adopted position doing what God called us to do and there's an obstacle we can't do anything about I I think that's when we can begin to speak to the obstacle not presumptuously not not making big demands but saying this has got to go this is hindering my work this is stopping me from fulfilling my purpose this has got to get out God it's got to go I'm pushing back devil you got to get out of the way circumstance you've got to change because I'm under a commission I'm under a calling I'm in my position I'm doing what God called me to do amen not saying God this is too hard you finished the job no you gave me to do it I want to be faithful to do it but sometimes this obstacle got to go brother brother bam makes a statement about that in the message Paradox he's referring to what Joshua did he says it's a paradox but God Did It Anyways what by a man not a God not some great angel coming down from heaven a man with faith in the mission that he was given to take that land the word of God was behind it I give you this land and everywhere The Souls of your foot Shall Set upon that I give you it's yours footsteps means meant possession and the Sun the achievement he was trying to do see his enemy was routed he knew if the son ever set them Kings would get together and they'd come back upon him with double Force so the sun was going down and Joshua a man commanded to do this said Son stand still further down in the same quote he says Jesus said in St Mark 11:22 if you say to this mountain be moved and don't down in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said but that that takes motive and objective of course you got to have a reason for it you can't have faith unless you got some reason those things move by faith amen Joshua had Faith because he knew what he was supposed to be doing and he knew he had to do it and he knew now was the time and this was the right season and he knew and his faith and what he was called to do caused him to say son stand still and if we have to speak to obstacles and speak to things in our life that are hindering us we have to do it by faith not by some hope but not some by enchantment but by faith faith in what when we have the right motive and the right objective and we get inspiration and say God I don't see any other way this thing's got to move out of my way this has got to come out of my life this thing's got to be separated from me so that I can keep doing what you called me to do amen amen praise be to God so now the children of Israel are driving out the inhabitants amen there's inhabitants on our land sometimes that's keeping us for the full promise of the word there's false understandings there's false teachings there's wrong ideas there's our own traditional thinking sometimes it's stuff within us that are plugging up the works it's our own way of viewing things some maybe habits that we formed maybe we've got uh uh some hindrances or some fears or some complexes or something that that is tripping us up and hindering us from doing what God's got to do but oh I say friends resist the devil and he shall flee keep pressing against it it's got to go amen because we've got to take the land it whole listen Israel was to take everything Moses said and make it live in that land to have a a tabernacle to bring their tithe to have the feast to Feast before the Lord to plant in the right season to bring the Vintage and bring the Harvest to bring the tithe to let the land rest Amen to to divide it up amen if it's sold then for it to go back amen every seven years the the Israelites are sold every seven years the land every fth year all of that word had to be made manifest on that land and that was their job to do it but I'm telling you we live in a day that the whole word has to be made manifest in us all of it not part of it not 50% not 75 but there's a people on the land amen there's a people in the land at the end time that has got to make this book live what is the bride she's the New Testament that's all what does she have to manifest the New Testament amen each one of us have to take our portion our part amen it wasn't for one person anymore when they came to adoption now when they came to the land it wasn't one person's job to do it all it was everybody to do their portion and each of us have a portion of this word to live we have a certain uh status in life We're Young middle-aged old we're male we're female we're kids we're parents we're employers we're whatever we are but whatever we are we've got to make this word live out of this land wherever God's put us that's our individual responsibility and collectively the bride has got to make this message live it's got to be on display it's got to be a Living Word it's got to be Christ manifest to the world Amen and not one person's going to do it anymore God's taken the prophet who displayed what it was but now he's marched us across Jordan into this word to possess it and we've got to possess it amen not just say I'm I'm just a I'm on a tour I'm touring around no but this is my part to live I'm going to live it oh let's look here at Joshua 1 I mean judges one sorry not Joshua Judges let's skip to the next book Judges chapter 1 verse 18 says also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof and ascalon and the coast thereof and erron with the coast thereof and the Lord was with Judah and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had Chariots of iron it was tough they had Chariots of iron and they could not drive them out let's go down to verse 27 neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of bethen and her towns nor tanok in her towns nor the inhabitants of dor in her towns nor the inhabitants of eam in her towns nor the inhabitants of megiddo in her towns but the Canaanites would dwell in the land and it came to pass when Israel was strong that they put the Canaanites to Tribute and did not utterly drive them out man this is a sad portion of the story We Know It starts the decline of Israel but Judah starts with great successes and great victories and taking great swaths of land and pushing back enormous enemies but they got this one little area that they can't take because the Canaanites have iron chariots if you read through it all this tribe couldn't fully possess this and this one could take the hills but not the valleys this one could take the valleys but not the hills then and everywhere there was little encampments of Canaanites left over because they couldn't fully drive them out there was some difficult things that just wouldn't budge that's right I don't know if you've lived long enough to have some difficult things that just don't budge but the problem is they put them under tribute the problem with tribute is they had a PCT with them and an agreement and they put them on under servitude okay we're your boss you're our servants but God told them not to do that Moses said don't make League don't make a covenant with any of the inhabitants and that's what a tribute is they put them under League they they made a covenant with them and God had told them don't you dare do it it doesn't matter how many iron chariots how tough it is and how entrenched they are you remember the stronghold of the jebusites amen that would became the city of David amen they took Jerusalem but they couldn't take the city of Zion they couldn't take uh uh uh the the city of the jebusites the stronghold of the jebusites they couldn't take it for generations and generations until David come along but under the ministry of David they finally broke through and took the stronghold of the jebusites and that became the city of David and listen it doesn't matter how long it takes keep pressing until until what until the stronghold of the jebusites becomes what the stronghold of the jebusites become an impenetrable Fortress that they can never never rid themselves of it was always right in the middle of Israel and they could never get rid of it but it was transformed one day why because of persistent effort because of a king on the throne amen because of Mighty Warriors who had confidence in David amen they finally were able to turn the jebusite stronghold into the city of David the place of the Throne of the king amen there's sometimes strongholds in our life because of things that we allowed or things that happened to us or things that we've got but I want to keep pressing until that stronghold of an enemy becomes a place for the throne of my king amen don't want to quit and certainly don't want to put it under tribute CU when I put it under tribute I make a peace agreement and the peace agreement is as long as you stay small and subdued and don't cause me any problems I'll leave you alone you leave me alone but the problem is those little Canaanite Pockets never remain little they kep reproducing and reproducing and they always came back to fight him and that's where all their Wars begin to come from praise God brother Brenham says in the in the marriage of the Lamb he said so many says if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing I'll serve him but that's up to you see you got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see she has made herself ready I like that word you see God could not push us through a little pipe pull us out the other end and and then say blessed is he that overcometh you have nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith in respects to God this I mean look at with this list take away from me drinking gambling lying you think oh God if you could just take away these bad habits if you could take away my habit of this or my habit or that or or my temper or my jealousy or my bitter if you could just take it away from me everything would be fine and and this is what brother B said that's up to you there's things that we have to fight amen I don't care if they got iron chariots you may have got a temper from your great great grandma to the grandma to Mom to you it doesn't matter it's not allowed to day it does not belong in the land if it's contrary to the stature of a perfect man if it's contrary to the nature of Jesus Christ it has no right to stay in your land amen you may not get rid of at the first attempt or the 10th attempt or the 30th attempt but don't put it under tribute don't say as long as you stay on the side and only flare up once in a while and only my husband ever sees it don't you dare do that you say that thing's got to get out of my life I don't know how and I don't know when but it's got to go and and I will not accept it here because the only thing this land is supposed to do is Manifest the word not something that great grandma struggled with our grandpa struggled with this is the be this is to become the stature of a perfect man the very nature the divine nature of God living through flesh amen I don't care if it's five minutes before I die that I get Deliverance I'm going to keep pushing till I get Deliverance I don't want to accept it and sometimes in our lives we ow things as tribute we we put it under tribute as long as you don't wreck my life as as long as you don't take over as long as I'm Not In conflict all the time every once in a while but Moses told him don't do that don't do that brother brandham in the message presuming he has a lady coming to the prayer line and this really blessed me the it says on the on the transcript the sister speaks to brother Bram she's talking to brother brandham coming through the prayer line and brother BR says God bless you Sister would you just a moment the lady sincerely confessed she said she has a spirit on her of high temper and we realize that that's not nice but sister not only you but there's plenty of us you see but maybe come might uh some might not be as honest to to confess it but he that will confess his sins he that hide his sins will not Prosper but he that will confess his sins Shall Have Mercy you know that so I pray Heavenly Father by laying hands on on sister that this temper will leave her may it never bother her again in the name of Jesus Christ amen you know what that was a woman who wasn't willing to put that temper under tribute anymore that was a woman who had lived with it who knows how long and who knows how long she struggled with it and long resisted or what had happened in her life but she come to a prayer line to confess to another man I've got a problem with the temper Amen to do what to expose The Hiding Place of the devil to expose why because she didn't want it there anymore amen sometimes resisting doesn't mean just gritting your teeth and clenching your fist as hard as you can sometimes what you got to do is expose the very thing you're trying to get rid of you got to hate it enough to not want it in your life you got to hate it so much you're willing to maybe ask somebody to pray with you about it confess it to them and say I've got this thing I got to get rid of and it's and it's hiding in my life it's rooted in it's between the cracks and the crevices of the high mountain and they got iron chariots and I've inherited it and I'm having a hard time with it amen and you might just need somebody to come and pray with you you might just need to confess it you might need to expose it and you might need to say I'm refusing to let it remain unchecked I'm pushing against it with all my might oh praise God if we can just do God God told the Israelites I will fight for you and I will drive them out but he didn't just say you stand on the bank I drive them out then you come in no he drove them out as they fought and as they fought some didn't go so easy but that never changed the fact that God said he would drive them out what he wanted them to do was keep fighting amen don't stop don't put under tribute it'll go amen remember brother Bam's uh nervous stomach tense stomach that he had and a stomach condition all of his life and it cycled through his life seven times and when he was coming to the eighth time amen was at the end of his ministry in 1965 brother brandham pushed against that and pushed against it and he prayed he went to doctors he went to Mayo Clinic he got a stomach scope he was not willing to live with it he knew his God was a Healer and he was believing God for healing whether it came from medicine where it came from Sur surgery whether it came from a doctor whether it was God's hand by himself he didn't care he was wanting healing and he so believed and so pushed and so resisted that condition till God delivered him and he preached a message called on the wings of a snow white dove when God promised him his healing and delivered him from that condition that plagued him all his life and then he took him off the scene 30 days later that was a tremendous Victory friends no telling no there there's no telling why God let it remain there was something God was doing he was doing something maybe for us maybe for the prophet maybe for both maybe for the family he was training him maybe he was uh uh maybe he had to keep him in check like he had to keep the Apostle Paul in check I don't know why that the prophet was plagued like that God had a purpose in it all there's things in our life that maybe they don't go so easy Maybe some things we just delivered of like that no problem it just goes other things we struggle and struggle and struggle with amen I don't know why God let them Drive some enemies back and hold the sun in place till they killed all of them in that area but then there was some Canaanites with iron chariots they couldn't get out so easy I don't know why God lets these things happen in our lives where we have tremendous Victory one day and the next day we got this little Annoying nagging Thorn that we can't seem to get rid of I don't know why but God will it's going to work God's purpose somehow it's working for the good some way God's got a purpose in it all and I thank him for it but I'm not going to stop pressing against it unless he tells me to like he told the Apostle Paul but if he doesn't tell me I want to be like the prophet of God and I want to be praying for my healing and deliverance all along like I said if it comes 5 minutes before my death praise God I had victory over that thing in my life praise be to God I don't don't want to put it under tribute Judges chapter 2 verse one Judges chapter 2 verse one and an angel of the Lord came up from gilgal to bacham and said I made you to go up out of Egypt and I have brought you into the land which I swear unto your fathers and I said I will never break my Covenant with you and you shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land you shall throw down their altars but you have not obeyed my voice why have you done this wherefore I also said I will not drive them out from before you but they shall be as thorns in your sides and their God shall be a snare unto you he said you put them under tribute and you left them there why did you do that and if you go back to the uh Exodus Exodus 34:11 Moses told them ahead of time don't do that and they did it and here comes an angel of the Lord down to rebuke them and say why did you do that now I won't drive them out before you let's put this in perspective here as we wind down they had enemies they could not overcome they could not they tried but they could not they were strong they were embedded for whatever reason they could not so they put them under tribute because that was the easy e thing for them to do so they didn't have to keep fighting so they could go on enjoying the promised land that flowed with milk and honey they could get on with building their Estates and they could get on with doing what they wanted to do and so they let them go and now God sends an angel down to rebuke them for doing what he told them not to do and says now I'll not drive them out see it's interesting because they couldn't drive them out so it looked like God wasn't driving them out but God's promise was still true he would drive them out amen they just needed to learn some patience and endurance and perseverance but now when they put it under tribute God said I'll not drive it out now you'll deal with this forever it it'll be a thorn in your flesh listen it looks like sometimes God's not driving things out of our Liv lives but he promised his word would work he's given us promise and all the promises are true to us it doesn't matter if it looks like it's not moving amen God will someday move it if you stay with the word and stay persistent and believe God and stay focused on his word and don't put that thing under tribute but you just keep saying in the name of Jesus Christ you've got to go amen next day you got to to go the next day you got to go it doesn't matter how long you push back against it but don't you dare accept it as a normal part of life unless God tells you too yes he did that to Paul he could do that to you but if he hasn't done that to you stick with the word until the word comes to manifestation praise God let's turn to Joshua 17 if you could turn back with me Joshua 17 I want to read something to you that Joshua told Joseph Joshua 17:16 now remember when we were over judges it said that Judah they couldn't overcome the Canaanites because they had iron chariots but let's look here in in Joshua 17 verse 16 and the children of Joseph said the hill is not enough for us and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have Chariots of iron both they who are of bethen and her towns and they who are of the valley of jezriel and Joshua spoke unto the house of Joseph even to Ephraim and Manasseh saying thou art a great people and has great power Thou shalt not have one lot only but the mountain shall be thine for it is a wood and thou shalt cut it down and the the out growing of it shall be thine for Thou shalt also drive out the Canaanites though they have iron chariots and though they be strong he already told Joseph man the the the half tribe of Manassa and Ephraim he already told the tribe of Joseph he already said yes that they're there with iron chariots but you're a mighty and strong people don't forget who you are amen you will drive them out amen and if God will do it for one he'll do it for another if he can do it for Joseph he could have done it for Judah if Judah would only believe what the Holy Ghost had done and the for somebody else and what he had promised Amen brother bam said if God Did It for one if I can approach him the same way he's obligated to do it for me and if if Joseph can drive out the iron chariots Judah could drive out the iron chariots they could all drive out the iron chariots they just have to believe that they can amen the problem is sometimes we don't believe we can we have to believe we can because God said he would help us amen God said he would fight for us and with us and if we'll take footsteps they'll become possessions amen we got to keep pressing into that thing and you may not get very far the next time but if you can get a centimeter more land take a centimeter more land amen and give this thing less room to work in our lives amen if we got to press just a little bit more next time and take another centimeter it may be hard and it may be difficult and you may have to lay yourself bear to everybody you know you may have to go around apologizing every time you do the same thing you've done over and over again amen just to expose that thing to kill that Spirit that's in in there yes and it may be hard and you may do it you may do it till you're embarrassed you may do it till you're tired of it but if you hate that thing and push against it it'll go amen there's a responsibility that comes with adoption God hasen't given us his word so we can say oh we have the blessings of the Lord he's given us his word so that we can make the word live in in us so we can surrender to it submit to it apply it in our lives manifest it through our lives there is something for us to do and it's for us to possess this land brother Brenham says in the stature of a perfect man he says you get it these people who died in there are depending and waiting on us so the church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection he said says in 1965 in the message and knoweth it not he said what are we coming here for what are we doing are we coming here playing a game are we coming here meeting as a lodge it's ch Christ can't come until that church is perfectly right he's waiting on us yes do you believe that I said God I'm sorry that's all I can say is God I'm sorry I have been guilty of putting things in my life under tribute I don't want to put them under tribute I mean there's for some of us we've served the Lord long enough there's things we've got rid of in our life and got out of our life that's creeped back in Shame Shame Shame on us we got victory over it once why did we let it creep back in amen Fashions of the world and entertainment things and things that when we first come to the message we kicked it all out and we got victory over it we had overcoming power to overcome it and because we got so wise in the message we become so so good as Believers we started thinking we could handle some of these things and now we're allowing the very things we drove out to creep back in shame on us amen let's have Victory and drive it out and let this word live in me please God I need your help I can't do it by myself but you promised this is the age this is the hour you will have a church without spot or wrinkle or any blemish or any such thing you promised it you'll have it you'll present it to yourself I believe it but I'm not just going to sit on the sidelines and say God you've got to do now here's my list of things you got to fixing me no we've got to be striving against it friends pushing back and resisting the devil and all of his tactics in every area he tries to get a stronghold we got to push and trust God if I can't get him with the sword he'll get him with the stone but he'll work with me he won't leave me all by myself it may have felt like for them when they couldn't drive out the inhabitants they were all alone where was God where was The Great sweeping Victory but God had never changed his mind about them or about his promise God has never changed his mind about us or the promise or what he wants to accomplish in this end time it's the same he's always wanted to accomplish he wants to manifest himself in a many membered body and each of us have the responsibility to make the word live in our portion our land our positional placing in the body of Christ and that's our responsibility it's our responsibility nobody's going to pray for you it's your job to pray nobody's going to read for you read the Bible and read the message and listen to nobody's going to do that for you that's your responsibility nobody's going to feed on the word for you it's your responsibility to feed on the word for yourself nobody can climb inside of you and be honest for you and say I'm struggling with this and I need to overcome this and and really I did that for these reasons I've got ulterior motives for I'm looking religious but I have another reason for doing it it's meeting some need inside of me nobody else can do that for you friends you've got to do that yourself you got to be real and genuine in the place and position God's put you and say I've been playing the part of a hypocrite I've been playing like I'm this to everybody else but I'm actually on the side this you've got to deal with that nobody else can do it for you that's for you to do there are some things that he's left for us to do and he'll help us I believe he'll help us I believe he'll drive out the enemies but I think footsteps are still possession got to take the promise of the word and take the sword of the word and drive it to the heart of the enemy and keep pushing it until something Moves In Our Lives I don't want to get satisfied with the same way I've always been I don't like the way I've always been when I look at the Statue of a perfect man I see so many changes in my life but when I look at Christ I see so many more changes I need in my life and I I want them to change Lord I'm not looking for a passing grade I want a passing grade in the message message so I can go to heaven so I can make the Rapture I'm looking I I I want with all my heart to take the place and position he's given me and I want to work it with everything that's in me I want to give my whole self to it I want to be honest about it I want to be transparent I I I want to apply the word I want to call on God for help I want to press against the devil I want to do what he's given me to do and I want to be found faithful amen cuz that friends I believe is the responsibility of the adopted is to do what he's given us to do amen let's all Stand Together God bless youen thank you for your pull and your attentiveness amen this message is in a game Church isn't a game it's not a social club it's not something we do on the side this is the great work that God left for the end time to be made manifest to bring a people Amen to a position where they'll manifest where he can manifest himself again in Bride form amen and like I said before there's not one of us that's going to manifest all of that the closest came brother brandom he showed it in a form it was one vessel declaring to us what God was trying to do but now God has taken that manifestation and spread it out over all of us say well what am I supposed to do am I supposed to have visions am I supposed to heal no you're supposed to do whatever he's given you to do amen don't go take the ball out of somebody's hands don't try to invent something whatever you find in your hand to do do it with all of your might do it is unto the Lord do it according to the word and let everything that's not the word be driven away as you do what God's given you to do and if you do your part and I do my part and all the brothers around the world they do their part God is going to manifest himself upon this Earth because this message will produce what he sent it to produce I believe it's producing it but in order for it to produce it we're going to have to be real honest perseverant and faithful we're going to have to believe him and if we put something under tribute I think it's time to be honest about it just to be real honest say I've got a bragging Spirit I've got a lying spirit I exaggerate too much I I have resentment in my heart I've got bitterness I've got a temper I I I I've got a lust issue I I've got problems with entertainment I think it's time to be real say I put it under tribute but I'm sorry I'm breaking that Covenant with that thing amen you're evicted you get an eviction notice right now I think it's time to be honest friends because I believe that's the hour that we're living in man I want this vessel not to be given over to tribute for Devils to hide and old habits to remain I want it to be given over to the word and I want it to be a vessel that can be full of the word full of the Holy Ghost living the word will we be perfect no friends I'm not looking for that I just don't want any Canaanites under tribute amen will I mess up yeah I'll mess up but I'm not looking for something that I know there and just making a pack with it and leaving it alone because it's too hard I don't want to live like that anymore I want the word to live in me amen God bless you all let's bow our heads together and pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus for your goodness to us Lord God the things that you've shown us the things that you've revealed and the things that you call us call our attention to Lord God we realize that this this is a great hour that we're living in but a great hour calls for great effort it calls for sacrifice honesty calls for a people who will be real and have a revelation having the mystery of your will revealed to us Lord God I believe you've been gracious to us to reveal to us personally our part in your program you've come with your Holy Ghost Lord and you've you've quickened us to life you've brought us to a level of maturity and you've placed us with gifts and positions and places you've given us responsibilities Lord and works to do and things to accomplish for your kingdom and God you've under that adoption you've placed the responsibility in our hands and God I want to be responsible with what you've given me the responsibility to care for and God I want to take responsibility when I fail and I want to say it's my fault Lord and I want to work to make it right there's things that I've allowed I shouldn't have allowed and I want to own up to it and make it right now because this is my responsibility under adoption you've given it to me to do and I want to do it Lord Lord I want to believe your word speak your word manifest your word want to feed on your word want it to be a light to my soul and a light that that shines forth from me God I pray Lord if there's those among us all of us Lord not just those among us every one of us have something in our lives we're still pressing against something we want gone Lord I pray that you give us the courage Lord to keep Swinging The Sword of your word and I pray God that you'd help us and that you would do what you promised to do that you would drive out the inhabitants of the land you would send Hornets before them that you would Stone them like you did in the days of of Joshua whatever you have to do would you come and fight with us and help us Lord we're not asking you to do it all but we're asking for your help Lord would you help us Lord and those unsurmountable obstacles that are hindering us from completing the commission Lord would you give us the faith to speak the word over them Lord so we can see them moved out of our way so that we can continue doing what you called us to do we love you father and we ask God that you would help us now for God we know that you you've got a purpose and a plan and we're part of that purpose and plan and we want to see that purpose finished in us and we don't want to do anything to hinder it Lord so would you open our eyes to see where maybe we've allowed things we shouldn't have allowed where we've we've got lazy and quit pushing and quit fighting when we should have kept fighting help us Lord for I want every stronghold of the enemy to become a place for your throne a place where you rule and reign in my life Lord that's my desire it's my desire for these people for all of us together
