[Music] [Music] let's bow our heads together and pray dear Lord Jesus we love you father we counted a privileged Lord to be gathered here together and Lord we know that we've come because you've drawn us here it's by your mercy and your grace and our lives that you've watched over us and you've kept us this far and you're drawing us constantly to a closer walk we all we thank you for that Lord and we come together Lord to bring honor and glory to your name to walk in obedience Lord to your commandment well we just ask God that you would take control here this evening and as we look into your word Lord may you come on the scene and break the bread of life to us Lord may you use the vessel here standing here under your control Lord and bring forth your Eternal Word Lord for an eternal purpose and maybe walk in that purpose give us the instructions we have need of tonight and may you take preeminence among us and have your way Lord may you get glory in it all we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen then while we're standing let's look at the Book of Mark together in Mark chapter 16. and we'll begin in verse 15. for a title tonight I'd like to minister on the battle is the Lord's and yours the battle is the Lord's and yours and I hope that that title will make sense as we move forward amen and we'll look at Mark chapter 16 uh verse 15 and really I just want to continue some thoughts from Sunday and just keep moving in that direction some things we didn't have a chance to finish um then let us begin here in verse 15. and he said unto them go you into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen and God bless you as you take your seats and when I really want to hone in on that last verse and that last part of that last verse in the in the last verse reads and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them it was a combined effort amen they had to go but they didn't go alone and the Lord was working with them and that's a it's an amazing statement to me that the Lord was working with them and confirming the word with signs following so they weren't on their own neither was God working independently of the disciples or the disciples working independently of God but they were working in conjunction together if we could turn to the Book of Exodus and I I want to take a look as we as we build this thought through a couple of examples here and we'll go all the way back to the Book of Exodus chapter 33 and we'll read a verse here and then we're going to go to numbers 33. so Exodus 33 then we'll jump to numbers 33. so in Exodus 33 I'm going to start with verse one we'll read verse 1 and 2. and the Lord said unto Moses depart and go up hence thou and the people which thou has brought up out of the land of Egypt unto the land which I swear into Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob saying unto thy seed will I give it and I will send an angel before thee and I will drive out the Canaanite the Amorite the hittite the parasite the hivite and the jebusite so I just want to highlight a few things here he says go up to the land that I swear unto the thy fathers and I will give it to the unto thy seed will I give it so God says I'm going to give you this land then he says I will send an angel before thee and I will drive out all the inhabitants of the land the Canaanite and the hid tie so we know that God is giving them the land and God's going to drive them out is that right so let's go over to numbers 33. this is after their Wilderness Journey after the 40 Years of wandering in the wilderness he comes and he repeats the instructions again through Moses and Moses giving instructions to the children of Israel and in numbers 33 let's read in verse 50. numbers 33 and verse 50. and the Lord spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho saying Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you were passed over Jordan unto the land of Canaan then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants I thought he said he was going to do that now he's saying ye shall drive out all of the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all their high places and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the land to possess him and ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families and to the more you shall give the more inheritance and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance Every Man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth according to the tribe of your fathers ye shall inherit it but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that Those whom which you let remain of them shall be Pricks in your ears and thorns in your sides and shall Vex you in the land wherein you dwell so if we compare Exodus 33 with numbers 33 God says I've promised the land to your fathers I'm giving you the land and I will drive them I'll send my angel before them and I'll drive them all out and in numbers 33 he says now go into the land and you drive out the inhabitants and if you fail to drive them out they'll be thorns in your sides and Pricks in your in your eyes so then you read this and you're confused who's supposed to drive them out is it supposed to be God or is it supposed to be the children of Israel and the answer is yes amen brother Branham says uh and the message the Good Shepherd of the sheep he says look God told Israel way down in Egypt I have given you Palestine now he could have just went up there and excommunicated the whole thing run them all out with a plague kill them all off he could have went up there and sent fear among them and draved them out of the country but he said Israel it's yours you go get it they had to fight for every inch of ground they stood on God has a certain way of accomplishing his word amen he makes the promise but he's got the way of bringing his promise to pass and and another message just a couple months after this and the message stands still he says one day when the children of God was coming in by the word of God taking the land that God had given now remember God gave them the land down in Egypt he said that land is yours every bit of it now the people today are expecting God to reach down get them by the neck say yes that's right you bring me out clean me off heal me and I'll believe you God doesn't do his business that way he gives you the promise but you have got to fight for every inch of ground that you possess why didn't God go over there and just run out all the amorites and the Hittites the parasites and all of them why didn't he just run them all out no Israel had something to do and you've got something to do God said the land is yours go possess it amen this is a a tremendous principle but God is in one place saying I want to send the angel of the Lord and can you imagine if you're if you're Israel that day and you hear that oh man how exciting that is because I mean God is going to send his Angel before you and he's going to drive out all the inhabitants amen and brother Ram talks about this you know how their imagination must have run they're just going to walk across Jordan and walk in and start putting their stuff in the houses and and then enjoying it they didn't realize that the way God was going to send his Angel and drive them out is he was going to come in a people and be working through a people and driving the inhabitants out of the land that's why he would come and say you drive them out and if you fail to drive them out and you can say but God you said you would drive them out and he says yes I will drive them out now you drive them out and if you don't drive them out yeah so who's driving them out [Music] you realize the children of Israel without God could do nothing but also God chose to do nothing without the children of Israel it's not that God couldn't but he chose not to amen so once we understand God's program if we can understand it through the Bible then we can understand it in our lives because so many times we want God to do wonderful things for us and God wants us to get up and take the word and put it in action and start doing what he's called us to do and then he's promised to be there to help us to drive out to deliver to bring the word to pass but not when we sit on our haunches and wait for God to move God's told us to move he's given us the word and the a wonderful example in the end time of how to make the word work amen I want to look at another story here if we go to First Samuel together this one I I really like first Samuel first Samuel 17. and verse 45 first Samuel 17 and verse 45. the story of David and Goliath so we know you know all the background of this we're going to cut right in here to the middle then said David to the Philistine thou comst to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defied this day where the Lord delivered thee into my hand and I will smite thee and take thine head from thee and I will give thy carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air into the wild beast of the earth and all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel and all this assembly shall know that the Lord's saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands amen let's keep reading and it came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and Drew nigh to David to meet David that David hastened and ran toward the Army to meet the Philistine and David put his hand in his bag and took dense a stone and slaying it and smote the Philistine in his forehead and the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the Earth so David I love this so David prevailed over the philistine so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling with a stone and smote the Philistine so who prevailed over the Philistine David who did David say who was going to win the victory he said the battle is the Lord this is what brother Branham says says now David said you meet me as a Philistine with armor and spear but I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel watch he had five Stones he had five fingers the sling wrapped in j-e-s-u-s f-a-i-t-a faith in Jesus here he comes something has to happen I tell you when he turned that stone loose the spirit of God caught into that stone and slew Goliath I love this cut his head off and all the others weakened down in the armies of Israel took courage and they cut Philistines Plum to the walls so then you have to say who killed Goliath was it God or was it David and once again the answer is yes because God Amen is not the one who slung the stone David slung the stone but God took hold of that stone amen according to the prophet and drove it to its Mark amen God needed a man on the scene to work through he needed somebody with faith in God and the promise of God that'll have the courage to go stand there and sling the stone but David by himself could not have killed Goliath it was not David's expert Marksmanship that killed Goliath it was the battle was the Lord's it was the hand of the Lord that smoked Goliath but he was using a vessel a chosen vessel and there's no difference between those stories and the day and age we live in amen the same thing holds true today the same principles are true that God is working through flesh amen we just got to have confidence in the flesh that he's working through amen I want to look at one more in the book of Hebrews it will turn together to Hebrews chapter 11. it's so amazing in all of these stories that when Goliath when he begins to make his boast and defy the armies of the Living God could have smote him dead instantly lightning bolt there could have been wild beast there him there could have been a plague that hits him I mean he could have had a massive heart attack and killed over dead God can take Vengeance for himself but God has coupled himself with Humanity to accomplish his word and his purpose and it's so good for us to see this in the scriptures and to understand it because it'll give us courage to live in this life and understand that it's not just us by ourselves amen we can't sit and wait for God to do everything in us do nothing neither by our own efforts can we accomplish anything it has to be God in us God With Us God through us or nothing will happen but we still have to have courage that God is with us and that God the battle is the Lord's and I love how the Bible is written because God is it's amazing you never find God as Petty you never find God as a a unwilling to share Glory because God now will give glory to David for killing Goliath and now they'll sing songs about David and about his mighty victories and that doesn't bother God on the least and then the Bible were written that that you know now the the Israelites and campaign in battle after battle the Israelites smote this nation the Israelites smote this nation and they conquered this city and they conquered that City amen and it's as if they did it all by themselves knowing good and well that as soon as they left God they could conquer no one else so it was the angel the Lord and the camp it was the angel Lord going before them that was giving them Victory but God was not willing to share the victory not he was not so small that he wasn't willing to share the victory with his children and would would say they defeated they won they won the battle knowing good and well it wasn't them it was God with them the same thing with the disciples when they would go after the resurrection of Christ amen and they would lay hands on the sick and and they would speak with new tongues and and all of these things that they would do the Lord went and was working with them confirming his word with signs so now I want to look at Hebrews 11. verse 17. nope not verse 17 verse 7. by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear fear prepared an ark through the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith so I love this in the book of Hebrews because the Hebrews chapter 11 we know is the faith chapter it's also you know the Heroes of Faith it's almost like the Hall of Fame and in in verse 7 it tells us that that Noah moved by fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house so it's almost like Noah saved his house but who told him that there was going to be a flood who told him he needed an ark and who gave him Specific Instructions with height length width and and Specific Instructions what wood to use and how to pitch the wood and how to make it it was God who gave him specific instructions on how to make an ark and that he needed an ark and that it was going to rain amen who saved his household it was God who saved Noah's household but when you go to Hebrews 11 Noah prepared an ark to the saving of his household amen Noah was the one who hammered the nails he's the one who cut the tree to plain the wood he's the one who took the word of God and he obeyed God's commandment and he and he fashioned the ark together without God there's no Ark I also would like to say without Noah there's no Ark without God there's no Ark without Noah there's no Ark Noah could never have done it without God and God chose not to do it without Noah and then Noah prepared an ark to the saving of his house his whole house was saved because of what he did the action he took but he could have never taken the action if God hadn't given him the word amen you remember when brother Brennan went beyond the curtain of time and the sister come up to him and said she was a beautiful young woman she come up to him and said God bless you my precious sister and the voice that was with him said don't you recognize her he says no he says she was past 80 I think he said past 80 when you led her to the Lord and no wonder she she's so happy and no wonder she calls you a precious precious brother and it's amazing how even in that realm in the sixth Dimension even that angel the Lord that's speaking to brother Branham says she was past 80 when you led her to the Lord as if brother Branham could do anything by himself as if he could lead anybody that the father's not first drawing but yet even in that realm amen he gets credit for the victory knowing good and well he couldn't have ever acted independently he could have never convinced anybody his words his preaching could have never saved anybody it was God who saves it was God who draws but God chose to use that vessel Amen to preach the message and they used that that vessel Amen to bring a bride out of denominationalism and for that amen even in the sixth Dimension he's awarded credit for that I just love it I love it let's look at Acts chapter 19. we'll keep working in this thought Acts chapter 19. in verse 11 Acts Chapter 19 Verse 11 and God wrought special Miracles by the hands of Paul I love this and God wrought by the hands of Paul [Laughter] amen and God wrought special Miracles by the hands of Paul he needed a pair of hands God needed a pair of hands there had to be a Paul that would submit to God and yield his vessel to God God wrought the Miracles but where by the hands of Paul and God wrought special Miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs and aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them so that even from his own physical being they would take uh pieces of fabric handkerchiefs garments amen and they would take them and lay them on the sick and the sick would recover amen so God wrought special Miracles by the hands of Paul so was it the hands of Paul or was it the works of God and the answer is yes praise God let's go to Romans chapter 7. I want to see something here that Paul says in Romans chapter 7. Romans chapter 7 verse 18. the Apostle Paul says for I know that in me then he interjects a thought that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing so the Paul has to be careful what he says here because Paul can't say that in me is no good thing because that would be a false statement but he says I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing now that's a true statement so Paul has to be careful how he words this amen just the same as we have to be careful how we handle this thought because Paul is saying that I'll read it verbatimian for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing but it's not as though there's nothing good dwelling in Paul because Christ is dwelling in Paul so something very good is dwelling in Paul but in Paul's flesh is no good thing but in Paul is a wonderful thing the great thing the great one Jesus Christ so he had to be careful how he worded this if he would have left out that that and that that what he injected there and in my flesh then he would have made a false statement amen that would have planted a false thought into the church but we need to pick up this thought and we need to understand amen that that there's two sides that I see the Christians making errors on and me included there's two ways that we go wrong and the truth is always right down the middle we go wrong in feeling like we're nothing that we're absolutely nothing there's no good thing in me I can never overcome I'm worthless you make a huge mistake because if you're the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ and Christ dwells in you that that statement can't stand that's wrong but then when the reality of Christ dwelling in you overcoming through you manifesting the word through you when that becomes attributed to your flesh you're also wrong then we become lifted up in Pride and then we get self-interjected and start to think that this is a work of self and it's not a work of self neither is it independent of self but it's God working through you both the will and to do of his good pleasure so I see the church going wrong both ways We Go Wrong by not realizing that you know in me that is in my flesh is no good thing there is nothing worth anything in the flesh of me I was born wrong it's hybrid it's a sticky conquerable nature the the way that I know that it's no good is that even though Christ lives inside of this body this body still has to be made over into a glorified form so I know I can put no stock in this it's still got a sticky cucumber nature to it and my human spirit amen is a spirit of the earth a carnal spirit amen that at my departure from this body will go and be no more amen so I had to have a Holy Spirit come in to give me leadership all right so this line gets cut pretty tight so I know that in me that is in my flesh is no good thing but I know that In Me Is a Good Thing If Christ be in me [Music] oh we have to be careful at the same time brother Branham said man is a walking paradox at the same exact moment you are worthless helpless no good and a failure to begin with and at the exact same time you were the Bride of Jesus Christ amen the manifestation of the word for this hour that is undefeatable indestructible at the same time and it's the way we keep our attitude about this that'll keep things in the right Channel but when we slip to one side or the other we're going to get out of the channel in the flow of the word will stop flowing in our lives so when we start to uh have an overestimated value of ourself of our flesh man that let's say outer man inner man because the outer Ram consists of the flesh body and the human spirit the inner man amen is is is the soul that has been quickened by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so we have to understand that we are a paradox and that we really are two persons at the same time and we have to put no confidence in the flesh that's why sometimes we we see that that things go awry when we fail to recognize that even my human spirit is still falling so every thought that comes through my mind and every emotion I have about something is not the holy spirit is not God so every tingly sensation I have in every feeling that I have may or may not be God I must still judge it by the word because I still have an outer man that is wrong and can lead me astray I have not so arrived that I can trust my flesh and that's where I see so many people going wrong amen they they walk with God they realize they're the bride and they think every thought that passes through their mind and every feeling they have is God is equal to thus saith the Lord and it goes Haywire amen because we're still in flesh but within this Tabernacle the inner man amen with the baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ is dwelling in there manifesting his word amen and the only way to distinguish between the two is the word we must stay planted in the word and judging by the word and never trust ourselves and never doubt who's in US we can never trust ourselves but we can never doubt Who We Are you talk about walking a tightrope we have to walk the tightrope because the deny Christ and bride form is to deny the word for your age but to not to fail to recognize the trappings of the outer man is to set ourselves up for failure we're going to be off in the weeds often the fanaticism and some craziness if we don't keep this balance so my brother remember said the truth is always right down the middle the problem is we always think we're in the middle we can be on way one way one side or the other and we always think that we're in the middle but by the by by the grace of God we've got a message that we just keep listening and keep yielding and keep humble to the voice God's given us to the word of this hour it'll keep bringing us back to the middle amen so Paul says that I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing that's why we said Sunday brother brim said that uh William Branham is the greatest enemy I got but he's also the prophet of the age he's gone so is he a good guy or a bad guy the answer is yes depends on which side we're looking at in first John chapter 4. we want to look at this scripture first John chapter 4 this is why I I this is just me this is just a thought that I have and it could be a million miles from right but you see that it looked as though that that God took brother Branham prematurely but we know there's nothing premature in the plan of God and he was taken at the age I believe it was 56 when he died and he was really in the prime of his preaching remember I said when I was first started I was like a little boy splashing in the water couldn't really swim but I learned how to take those strokes and he was really operating in his gift and he really coming to uh adoption so I I believe he's coming to adoption God can trust him with the word amen and he and he's moving into the uh preaching the the real meat of the Bride Ministry and and it looks like God just snatched him away amen but you realize that he was dwelling in flesh if God were to let him go on 20 or 25 years and and sinality began to creep in and he began to lose his mind and dementia creeped in and you know people regarding him as a prophet if dementia would have creeped in and he started saying odd things in the Pulpit what would have happened God took him exactly right on time God knows exactly what he's doing because he lived in a body of Flesh I mean the prophets of old they would at the end of their life they couldn't even see anymore they were blind they were laying in bed they had the the to pull their feet out of bed to lay their hands on their grandchildren to bless them amen and and they sometimes you know Isaac didn't know if it was Esau I didn't know it was Jacob because he was blind this is life this is the flesh we dwell in we have to recognize that that no matter how wonderful we are no matter how much God uses a gift in our lives how much God uses us we're still in flesh this flesh is corrupted and corruptable and will deteriorate and become weak amen prone to failure and we have to always remember that the most gifted Among Us can fail it's important to remember that that there's a human side and there's a God's side and and we have to be careful with one another that we keep it that way that there's a human side and there's a God side to one another so we can't discount the god in one another neither can we Overlook the humanity of one another I think this is maturity in the bride to understand that these elements are always here praise God first John 4 4. he says year of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen we just read where Paul says I know that in me John says greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world so the he that's in you is not in your flesh the he that's in you is in your soul amen brother Ben says in the message he says did you know a man's worth only 84 cents in chemicals now we've had some inflation since since 1955. so I mean we might be up to 15 bucks 20 25 I don't know what I don't know what 84 cents from then to now but it can't be a whole lot 20 Bill might do it did you know a man's worth only 84 cents in chemicals just enough chemicals about him a little bit of calcium just enough white wash to sprinkle the Hen's Nest and you know just a few chemicals and then you walk around like you're worth a hundred million dollars and what are you anyhow that's what any of us is after a while we're going to lay out there in the graveyard and rot away but that soul brother that's in there tonight in front of God is worth 10 million worlds that's right you'll take care of the 84 cents but you'll just let anything come into that soul so brother Benham I think it's amazing he he starts to take a human being and he starts to make you worth nothing and worth everything in the same quote it just depends on the part of you we're talking about and we if we if we extracted all the chemicals all the mineral content out of your body you may only be worth 20 bucks some of us are bigger than others we might fit 25 dollars not worth much not worth the clothes you're wearing but down inside of that worthless compilation of chemicals put together by genetics is a soul and if that Soul has a sieging that's come from God what's the value of that if it's part of the word it is the word and measure it's priceless brother bam says in the message communion the last message he preaches he's talking about questions he used to ask when he was a boy and wondering about God but then he says what was it he said there was another William Branham see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there what was it when he was a boy that was causing him to want God or to ask these questions he said there was another William Branham amen where down there a gene of God part of the word of God down in the soul amen the Brother Bear said the part that was meant to be you from the beginning the genuine part the part that come from God the thought of God Amen that now is implanted into your soul now birthed by by the new birth to bring its life in its own manifestation that is priceless amen amen so so we are a walking paradox praise God I say brother remember says what was it he said there was another William Branham down in there to me that's the prophet of the age that other William Branham that was down inside you see what I'm saying I started asking myself what is the bride what is the bride the bride we know the brother man asked the question what is the word bride he said the manifestation of the hour what is the bride it's the portion of the word that God once expressed in this day so it's a thought of God now expressed which is a word and it's the anointed we're for the day so it's also Christ but that bride is being manifest in human vessels so I believe by faith that I'm part of the bride and the bride is being manifest through my human vessel but then I say what part of me is bride well the only part of me is bright as the soul this isn't bride my mental realm is not bride the only part of me is bride is that part that come from God the Eternal part that's down inside another child lamp that may not even have the name Chad Lamb I don't even know what the name will be what do you call it in the Heavenly Realms what was it in the thoughts of God one it will be in the great Hereafter I don't know maybe it'll be chadland maybe it won't maybe we'll speak English maybe we won't the point is the the genuine thought of God concerning me amen is down in my soul and come alive amen by the spirit of God that is the bride that is my portion of bride that is the thought God had before the foundation of the world when he thought of me that's what he was thinking of Amen now that is contained in a vessel that come through sex birth through hybridization that's born wrong and has a carnal worldly spirit that part has to all change but until that change takes place the life on the inside must bring this subject to the word of God but I never must lose sight that this isn't bride or else I will start treating all of me as bride and have too much confidence and my emotions my thoughts my feelings my Sensations amen this isn't the day to be childish this is the age to grow up and have understanding and this message has opened the word to give us an understanding like no other age has had we can put no confidence in the flesh but I have utmost confidence in the word of God and the word of God is what he placed inside of me to be expressed in this hour and I've got absolute confidence in the god that's in me but not me but the god that's in me praise God let's go to John 15 the Gospel of John 15. you can walk away and we can say so brother Chad are we supposed to be confident or not confident are we supposed to be sure or not sure never ever ever ever be overconfident in yourself but never doubt what God has said about you never doubt what the word has promised for your life never doubt what God Said is about you never doubt who God has revealed to you personally that you are because if you begin to doubt that you'll lose hold of every promise of God and you'll lose your victory but if you start to take that and apply it to all the realms then we're gonna we're gonna set ourselves up for failure we're going to move into fanaticism and be led by emotions and feelings and we're going to train wreck ourselves and others too look at John 15 verse 4. Jesus says abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can you accept you abide in me I am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing Hallelujah without him we can do nothing where is he he's in me so with him in me we can do anything but without him I can do nothing so it's not me it's him let's go to Matthew 19 now Matthew 19. verse 26. Matthew 26 or Matthew 19 26 but Jesus beheld them and said unto him with men this is impossible but With God all things are possible so without him you can do nothing with men it's impossible but with him with him With God all things are possible so in you all things are possible but in you alone nothing is possible amen we're a walking paradox Amen in the message Jehovah Jireh my brother says a man is a failure he's totally lost at his birth there is no good in man if there's anything good about a man it's what it's the part of God that's in him for a man in himself is totally no good and there is any goodness about him at all it's God that did it for him praise God brother Ben goes on to say in the unfailing realities of the Living God says God always likes to work through men it's God's program to work through men do you believe that God works through men he made man his helper on Earth he made man a Lesser God than himself so that's why he he makes promises in the church ages to him that overcome but how are we going to overcome it's him overcoming in US amen but yet we're we're attributed as the Overcomers so we become the Overcomers but we never overcame by ourselves it was always his Spirit working through us that made us the Overcomers but yet he calls us Overcomers why does he call us Overcomers because we surrendered ourselves to his spirit and let him take us and we believed his word and we believed what he said about us and stood on the promise we didn't sit and lay down and wait for God to do everything we got up and said if that's what God says that's what we'll do if that's what God says that's the way we'll believe and if he says lay hands on the sick we'll lay hands on the sick when we lay hands on the sick they're healed why because we took him on his word man you made man his helper on the Earth amen we know uh I'm going to read you out of Acts 7 verse 34 we know that God works through manatees in partnership with men and in Acts 7 it says I have seen I have seen I have seen the Affliction of my people which is in Egypt and I have heard they're groaning and have come down to deliver them and now come I will send thee into Egypt this is God speaking to Moses and says I've come down to deliver I heard their groanings now come I send you we've talked about this so many times who was Moses Moses was Moses was to deliver but it wasn't Moses who delivered it was God who delivered but God didn't do it independent of Moses and Moses could have never done it without God so what's God doing in this age and where is he doing it anything that God's going to do in this age remember brother Benham told us that Christ God is now going to do work in and through the bride that specific work which he left for this day so there's works that he did not complete all his works when Christ was here but he left the portion of that work to do in and through the bride so if he's going to do his work among the Gentiles in this day where is he going to do it he's going to do it in and through the bride so whereas he's working he's working here not the flesh but him down on the inside through the flesh and I can't doubt that or else I become worthless to everybody else around me if I'm plagued by self-doubt if I'm playing you know we should have a healthy degree of self-doubt but we should have a pure Revelation a good revelation of who we are in Christ because then I can realize in a time of need in a time of trial amen there's nothing that I as a person can do for this person next to me but I know that greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world and I know who's in me and I know that he's Divine and I'm the branch and the fruit is supposed to come off the branch so I'm the branch so now I can go to this person and I can tell them there's a promise if we can believe this promise together I can lay hands on you and you can recover because God is working through a vessel what vessel if it's not you and I who is it where is it we can what's so bad for God to do something do something do something do something amen but the thing that God's going to do he's going to do that through vessels of clay brother remember says in the message the identified Christ of all ages he says so therefore he could tell the end from the beginning and in each age he lauded so much of his word in each age and then usually man gets it so twisted up and the world gets it in such a shape until he has to send some man anointed all ages has been the same he identifies himself among the Earth and man God does nothing without man the Bible said to him you know see he always takes man because it was man he had to use and and he put him on free moral agency knowing that he would fall in order to display his attributes as Savior for there was nothing lost and therefore he chose man he could have chose Stars he could have chose trees but he chose man question is today what man has he chose if it's not us who is it if it's not if he's not wanting to work in and through each one of us then where is it where is he going to work brother Graham says in the message new ministry and he's referring to the to the scripture where Jesus is standing with the disciples he's looking out over the people and he tells them to pray to the Lord of the Harvest that he will send laborers into the Harvest for the Harvest is white unto Harvest it's ready to reap and brother Bam's referring to that now he says now you say well if he knows it then why are you preaching because brother Bear's talking about predestination and God knows who will and who won't he says if if you know if God knows everything then why are you preaching and if God Saves why are you preaching you think about it why are we preaching now why why do we come to church and why do we sit and listen to preaching because this is God's method if God wants to speak he's going to speak through man and if we have confidence in God's way and can and can keep the Flesh and keep the spirit I mean the spirit of God and the Flesh of a man and keep everything lined up right with the right understanding we can come to church and get the full benefit of what God is doing yes because if we overly respect the Flesh of a man behind the pulpit we're going to go way wrong but if we devalue the gift and a brother operated by the spirit we're going to go away wrong so we've got to come right back to the truth is right down the middle so if we don't have reverence and respect we're going to miss out amen but if we have too much respect on the wrong part of a human being we're gonna we're gonna miss out we've got to come to the right understanding so why are we preaching because this is God's method the highest form of communication between God is Man is the preaching of the word but yet amen the man who's doing the preaching is no good prone to failure makes mistakes may say things wrong amen may may do things wrong amen but but but the gift inside and the word that's being preached that's God God have mercy on all of us it's just going to take God to bring us through it's just going to take the leadership of the Holy Ghost to have us come out right because there's a million ways to come out wrong we're just going to have to be completely dependent on the spirit of God to show us in the word and keep us down the middle of this road or we're going to wind up in a ditch on one side or the other because human nature will take us there so fast because this setup that God has amen is so complicated for a human mind to figure out that we're going to ditch ourselves to the right or the left if God doesn't come on the scene and lead us right through brother Benham said the reason I can help you is because you have confidence in me if you lose confidence in The Man Behind the pulpit he can't do a thing for you if you lose confidence in your pastor he can't do a thing to help you anymore that's just the way it works but you can't have too much confidence in him because if you think that man the Flesh of that man amen then if you don't have the right understanding then you're going to lift up a man and it's going to fail gotta go right down the middle and we've got to see that in one another you got to realize amen if you've got an Affliction in your body amen and you're at home you can say to your wife hey come and lay hands on me because she's got just as much right as a Believer to lay hands on you as somebody in the ministry we got to recognize this in one another and a husband and wife see each other yeah we see The Human Side we see the sticky cocoa bird if anybody knows there's a sticky cuckoo bird still left it's our spouse but yet they should also recognize there's something more than that on the inside and if we have faith in that we can Avail ourselves of that amen any believer can lay hands on you you can have faith that God will honor his word man we just don't want to lose confidence in God amen I want to I want to go back to this quote in my new ministry preaching is his program when he looked upon the apostles he looked upon the Harvest the Harvest is ripe and the laborers are few pray the Lord of the Harvest that he will send labors into the Harvest how many remember that well why would they have to pray to the Lord of the Harvest to send laborers into his Harvest if the lord of the Harvest was standing there knowing it would be done why God has so arranged him now listen to this God Is So arrange it that his program cannot move without you and I I'm going to read that again God has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and I brother random is referring to the scripture where Jesus looks out upon the people and he tells his disciples pray to the Lord of the Harvest that he'll send laborers into the Harvest and he brother said he was the lord of the Harvest knowing that it needed to be Harvest but could not send laborers to the Harvest till they asked because God has put himself on partnership with man he needs somebody to pray I mean if you think about this we think and and we know that God knows all things is that right God knows all things God has a a an understanding of what's going on all around us but how many times do we fail Amen to get the benefit of the word because we simply don't ask he said you have not because you ask not and here he's telling the disciples please pray he's saying please pray to me so that I can send laborers into the field now you can we can try all we want to figure out how this works mechanically and why I don't know I just knew he said it and I know what the prophet said about it amen and so there's many times we need to see ourselves for who we really are and see the power that we have with God and ask God to move mountains ask God to change situations ask God to change things in the lives of our loved ones and our family and other people in the church and stop saying well God knows it'll all work out God wants us to ask according to his word to take the promises and say God please amen fulfill your word and the life of my brother and the life of my sister and my child and my wife Amen to take God out his word but pray remember the one the widow woman and the unjust judge Jesus is the one who tells the story Jesus uses her as an example to the disciples and I'm and I would say you know don't pester God don't ask more than once I mean that's just me that's my own human thinking God knows just say it once and move on and there's times you just lay your claim to the promise and move on we understand that that God Jesus points out this woman who goes and knocks on the door of the unjust judge and continues to knock and continues to knock and he finally says not because I Fear God or I fear of man but because this Widow troubleth me I will deliver her amen and Jesus uses her as an example to the disciples [Music] so are we supposed to trouble God I think maybe we're supposed to believe his word so much that we don't give up on it that we've got such confidence and that we know where the door is and we know who the judge is and we know where to knock amen so many people don't know where to knock they don't know who the judge is they don't know where he's located and they don't know what the promise is but we know what the word says we know what the law says for us and that we have certain rights amen and we want to see those rights fulfilled and the word manifest and we cannot and keep knocking and keep knocking and keep knocking remember where the scripture says knock and the door shall be opened brother Branham says knock is not one time but continually knocking till the door opens amen I think sometimes we we may get a little lazy we may get a little lazy and we may we may we may put too much on God say brother Chad what do you say just just think with me for a minute we may be putting on God our part the part he wants us to play you can say God save my love and say this one save this one send somebody to him but maybe you're the one who's supposed to talk to them maybe it's your testimony maybe it's your preaching maybe it's I I don't I don't think we're going to get anywhere if we're putting on God our part because we're in Partnership together it's like saying God drive out the inhabitants of the land he said he would but you better take a sword in your hand and go and if you don't drive them out they'll become thorns it's like saying God keep your promise Moses praying God keep your promise to deliver the children of Israel out of bondage keep your promise to bring them to a problem keep your promise keep your promise keep your promise and when God comes to him and says hey I want you to go down and deliver him he says no I can't do that they won't listen to me foreign he goes and then God tells him again and he says but but here's a sign here's two signs and he says but they won't listen to me and then he says I'm not clear of speech and God says who made the tongue Dumber who made the ear death and he's going back and forth to God and finally he says God sends somebody else and God gets angry with him why because Moses is the chosen vessel and God has has bound himself to flesh to accomplish his will it doesn't matter how much Moses is praying God sends somebody God sends somebody Moses is to somebody and maybe you and I are the somebody I don't want to constantly put on God what's my part I want to do my part I want to finish this quote I haven't finished it yet God Is So arranged that his program cannot move without you and I you know how many times that we get our feelings hurt and get disappointed by some things in life and we just take a break has anybody ever took a Christian break you don't go into sin you don't slip into sinful life you don't you don't backslide that way but you just you're not engaged anymore you're not engaged you're not you're not working with the body you're not labor you're not putting your shoulder to the wheel I got my feelings hurt I had some things go bad and I'm just taking a break but if we're taking a break is the things God wants to do through us getting done he says God is so arranged that this program cannot move without you and I and as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do we're paralyzing his program a strong language and when the church moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we're in God's will doing his program say God help me to do my part help me to pray help me to stand on the word help me to keep engaging the way I'm supposed to be engaging this world God never called us to communal living to go move to Montana and just love each other he's called us to be lights in this world and to do something to manifest the bride the bride and flesh amen through our flesh he wants to manifest himself he said God help me to do my part Rim said in the unveiling of god notice when you become part of him as you are the veil that veils him you are part of him as long as Christ is in you as Christ was of God you know I referring now before I finish this quote referring to the previous quote goddess who arrange that his program cannot move without you and I and as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do we're paralyzing his program remember the message standing in the Gap when brother Brennan was corrected because he wanted to go away get away from the people his feelings were hurt all of those things Brethren made a statement in that he said I let the sick people lay do you remember that statement I let the sick people lay brother Ben did not want to go back out there and engage where he was getting rejected and where he was getting his feelings hurt right he said I built myself up a complex because they didn't hear the message they didn't hear my message but he makes a statement I let the sick people lay he had a gift of healing that was given to him and the commission to use that was given by an Angel and that gift wasn't going to go away but that gift was also with him and as long as he wasn't going out in the ministry there was many people who weren't getting healed and we could think well God could heal whoever he wants but God God put a gift in that man of healing and when he would go out that gift would operate and the many people would be healed and when he wasn't going people were not getting healed think about how profound that is God can do anything he wants he can heal anybody he wants but God has a chosen method to operate he's going to operate through man and he placed this great gift of healing in this vessel and when this vessel got his feelings hurt and didn't want to go back out there where he could get his feelings hurt he let the sick people lay there was people who were not getting healed because he was nursing her feelings I said God help every one of us help every one of us to take our part and not back down and say God help me Lord help me to surrender this flesh and this body to your will help me God I don't want to paralyze your program I want to see your program moving forward I want to be engaging I want to be testifying I want to be in prayer whatever you show me to do whatever I see to do I want to do it with all my heart amen because the battle is the Lord's but somebody's got to throw the Rock the battle is the Lord's but somebody's got to take a sword and step on the promise he'll drive the mouth but somebody's got to move forward because if somebody's not moving forward nobody's getting driven out help us to move forward God now back in this quote an unveiling of God he says now because God was in him made him God and as Christ is in you the hope of glory you become part of Christ he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also see you become part of Christ as long as Christ is hidden you then it's veiled to the unbeliever but you know he's in you you are templing Christ that's behind the veil the skin where is Christ he's behind the veil what Veil the veil of Flesh what flesh the many membered body the bride when we walk into work and we walk into family reunions we walk into stores there's a veil but there's something behind the veil wherever we go we need to remember that every every place we go endless possibilities are there the supernatural realm is there the possibility for Supernatural is there because we are templing Christ who's behind the veil I can do nothing but greater is he that's in me that's even in the world Amen he is the vine I'm the breath I can do nothing but if the if the vine is living in me amen then all things are possible so where's Christ Christ is in thousands of places around this world he's an ex he's accessible to millions of people I don't want to take away somebody's access I want to stay accessory I want to have enough doubt in my flesh not to lean to flesh and enough faith in the Christ in me to stay in my position and stay a light in a dark place because greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world I want to have enough confidence in what who God said I am and the life of Christ in me I want to have enough confidence in that to do the thing you do and not lose confidence because all I can see is the Flesh and not see Christ to where I'm I'm I've been made ineffective but I want to stay right down the middle of the road and I want to have faith in who I am and I want to doubt the flesh that I live in I want to put no confidence in the honor man but I want to put all confidence in Christ who lives in the Inner Man to Fine Line friends I want to read one last scripture and we'll close with this second Corinthians chapter six second Corinthians chapter six second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 16. and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God and God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them is God walking in the Earth yes where is he walking the Earth and whoever these people are he's referring to you I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people and God is on partnership with these people and he's working through these people and he's walking in these people praise God let's all stand musicians if you please come amen let's just bow our heads and pray together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for your word and God made me walk out of here warned and encouraged Lord warned that we live in a flesh Lord that is susceptible to Rome that is of a fallen nature an outer man that must be yet changed but God maybe also walk out of here encouraged and confident that greater is you that's in us than he that's in the world God may we walk in this life mature with mature understanding may we walk Lord in a way that allows you to work through this flesh For Your Glory may you accomplish what you left for this end time to be done in and through us as individuals may we have confidence in the promise Lord for this hour and who we are in that promise may we stay engaging and bring a light and a word to people who are in darkness may you use our hands may use our mouth use our feet use our eyes use us Lord now may we yield ourselves to you and have confidence in you Lord the battle truly is yours but God so the action must be in US I pray God you'd help us to stay yielded to that thought and fulfill that purpose but Inspire Us by your spirit let us move by your inspiration and by your leading keep us grounded in the word that's been revealed to us and unveiled in this hour may we keep our balance in the scriptures and may your spirit keep nudging us along may we be surrendered vessels led by you and may you finish the work in each one of our lives we yield ourselves afresh to you Lord and thank you for the promise for the word for the light of this hour God you're walking in US according to your word dwelling in us working through us help us Lord to surrender to that and believe it we love you Lord ask that you take these vessels and use them for your glory take us from here Lord and keep us Lord in the path of righteousness for your name's sake for you're our great Shepherd and guide we yield to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen Blake well hallelujah what a thought Jesus full salvation brought Victory Hallelujah victory so let the powers of Santa sail Heaven's Grace can never fail victory [Applause]

got a call from Levi Yoder uh or you know many of you know Levi you know I think almost all of you do and he's been witnessing he's been doing a good job of getting the word out but he's got some people who are interested in water baptism and he set up a meeting for us this Friday so pray please pray for me I'll be heading out to Holmes County amen this Friday I've got a service at 5 30 P.M uh and we're going to be preaching on water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and there's one uh ex-omish man a man has already left Amish Church who wants to be baptized so I know we have at least one to baptize after that service and after the service who knows there may be more this man's invited his family Levi's invited others there's going to be a few there at least I don't know how many but I would really appreciate your prayers if you'll be praying about that God's light will strike his seed that God's word will go forth in truth and you know there the number of bride left on the earth may be few we may find one praise God if we do may find several praise God if we do but you know there's even a reward for those who can honor and respect the word of God when they hear it so maybe even others may even come to the truth of water baptism and they may not be able to go further but praise God if they can honor God's word God will honor those who honor him so just pray that the word will have an effect on all that hearing amen and we'll do the very best we can and hopefully Sunday will be able to give you a report back on that but that'll be this Friday at 5 30 over in Holmes County so please be praying may God bless you foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] in my in my face so in the road you are I need you tired all your strength is gone and your heart feels toward remember
