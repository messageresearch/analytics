========================================

oh if i could just get a hold of that devil if i could just i'd wring his neck i hate statements like that you know i hate him because they're absolutely foolish this creature was full of wisdom the sum of beauty was summed up in him he was so deceptive he could deceive the angels in heaven and you're talking like you could go just take him and ring his neck and even michael when he was disputing with with lucifer over the body over the with the devil over the body of moses he brought not a railing accusation against him but he said the lord deal with thee i think it's foolish and childish to talk like that i think when we talk about you know if i could just punch him in the nose if i could just ring his neck i grew i grew up i grew up in a pentecostal church and we talked about the devil like that all the time while he was deceiving the whole works while they were stuck in denominationalism and trinitarian baptisms and and marriage and re uh divorce and remarriage issues running rampant through the whole church and they were punching the devil and wringing his neck and calling him stupid i say if you want to ring somebody's neck ring your own neck if you want to beat somebody down beat the same one paul was beating because paul was keeping under his body he was bringing it into slavery unless when he preached to others he himself should be a castaway paul was not acting silly and foolish amen brother bam told us that the devil's a worthy adversary because god needed a worthy adversary let's not talk like little kids amen but let's get down to business and say really if i want to defeat the devil i've got to be defeat the devil in me if i'm really going to give him a black eye then i've got to lay this flesh down so the word can move through this flesh that'll give him a black eye if i really want to stomp on him what i got to do is subdue this outer man and bring it in subjection to the word and let the spirit of god flow through me to manifest the word for the hour and then he'll get a black eye then he'll get stomped on the head then he'll be defeated jesus won the victory in gethsemane and that wasn't a jumping up and down and stomping and calling the devil names it was a wrestling with his own will looking to his friends for support asking god again if this could pass by what was he doing he was wrestling it all out and he was overcoming and when he finally subdued his own flesh when he finally subdued his own will he goes back to his friends and said take your rest asleep all is well the son of man has already betrayed into the hands of sinners but it's okay oh if the devil ever got a black eye it was right there if the devil ever got stomped on the head it was right there amen if he ever lost a battle it was right there in gethsemane when jesus christ won back eden and i i'm so tired of hearing rhetoric what we need is a life amen we don't need words and tap rallies in speech what we need is the manifestation of the life of jesus christ one who would only do the father's will we need a people on this earth that will only do the father's will
