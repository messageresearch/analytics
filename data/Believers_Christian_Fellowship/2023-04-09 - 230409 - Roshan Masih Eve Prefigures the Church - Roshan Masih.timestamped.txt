[8:36] just want to share what the Lord did
[8:38] I've had for the last
[8:42] I grew two three years or more a

[9:00] doctors they've run tests they've done
[9:03] things can't find anything can't come up
[9:06] with anything to help me
[9:07] and I've had prayer I've had people pray
[9:11] for me
[9:12] I tried to believe you know and listen
[9:16] to messages and different things and
[9:19] and just
[9:21] kept leaving but nothing ever happened
[9:25] and last
[9:27] Sunday
[9:28] when
[9:30] my dad was reading the scriptures
[9:32] preparing for communion
[9:35] I was just sitting there
[9:38] and he talked about healing in the cup
[9:41] and
[9:44] it just seemed like
[9:46] it was my time
[9:48] and it just dropped down my heart
[9:52] it was like God just said it's over
[9:55] you're healed and I just I
[9:58] it's done
[10:00] I didn't you know
[10:02] you can't bring that to pass you can't
[10:07] give it to somebody else
[10:09] God just absolutely
[10:12] and
[10:13] I just really so thankful and I left
[10:17] here
[10:18] and when we left of course I've been an
[10:20] asthmatic I've had asthma since I was a
[10:23] child
[10:24] and so my breathing is really
[10:26] deteriorating the last year or two
[10:28] and get short of breath a lot
[10:31] and
[10:33] on the way home I didn't I hadn't even
[10:35] said anything to Bassey yet and she said
[10:38] I noticed you were really singing
[10:40] tonight
[10:41] he didn't seem mature short of breath
[10:45] and
[10:47] so we I told her told her what happened
[10:51] and
[10:53] went home and Sunday night Monday
[10:56] Tuesday Wednesday never coughed at all
[10:58] Harley coughed one time
[11:01] and I went to the doctor I already had a
[11:04] doctor's appointment scheduled
[11:07] and so I went to the doctor on Monday
[11:10] and I I just told him what I'd been
[11:13] experiencing they said well we're going
[11:15] to get the bottom of this they run a
[11:17] bunch of tests and so far everything's
[11:18] been negative
[11:20] and uh
[11:21] so Thursday got up felt real good and
[11:26] Thursday afternoon I got a cough and
[11:27] spell again just cough coughed couldn't
[11:30] stop and Bessie said what's going on
[11:33] I said I'm just being tested
[11:37] it's just the death test in me and it in
[11:42] the past I get really discouraged this
[11:44] time I said it's just a test doesn't
[11:47] bother me at all I'm already healed
[11:50] so it doesn't matter but I just I want
[11:53] to give God the glory it's it's nothing
[11:56] I did it's just my time and he dropped
[12:00] it in so I appreciate it I'm gonna give
[12:03] God all the glory
[12:12] it's it's something like you told
[12:14] somebody I can't give it to anybody else
[12:18] the pastor can't give it to you
[12:20] it's only God can drop that turn your
[12:23] heart and when it does it's over
[12:26] self

[23:01] with you all and we're blessed to have

[23:07] few months ago at the at the last part

[23:19] brother and used him for a long time to
[23:21] do a great work over there he has a
[23:23] tremendous gift and he's a tremendous
[23:25] anointing and I'm so excited about the
[23:28] word this morning and that we have an
[23:30] opportunity to hear from my brother and
[23:31] that God can use that vessel and we can
[23:34] benefit from it amen
[23:36] this suit that I'm wearing my brother
[23:38] bought for me when I was in India I told
[23:40] him it's the first time anybody's ever
[23:42] bought me a suit amen so I thought it'd
[23:44] be fitting to wear it today and it's and
[23:46] it it's nice it was a nice suit and I
[23:48] was really blessed to have it so he'll
[23:51] be ministering this morning and also on
[23:52] Wednesday evening as well he'll be
[23:54] taking that service for us I just want
[23:57] to say I appreciate it brother Dave's
[23:58] testimony amen and I appreciate his
[24:00] willingness to come up and share it amen
[24:03] it's encouraging to know no matter how
[24:04] long we deal with something God knows
[24:06] and the promise I'll never never delay
[24:09] it'll always be on time amen so it was
[24:12] encouraging to me also I heard from
[24:14] Sister Nancy Morrow this week and the
[24:16] Lord supernaturally came and touched her
[24:18] in a very special way amen she's still
[24:21] weak she's still recovering but she's
[24:22] feeling better day by day and she knows
[24:24] that she's going to be fine
[24:26] amen she doesn't know you know if she'll
[24:28] need help with it from a doctor or not
[24:30] she doesn't know but she knows that
[24:31] she's healed by the grace of God because
[24:33] God came down and she had a visitation
[24:36] from the Lord and I was so excited and
[24:38] so encouraged to hear that as well I
[24:41] also want to let you know that brother
[24:43] Emmanuel sabasu is out of town he's away
[24:45] preaching for Brother Rich Cobb so our
[24:48] brother's been quite busy lately so keep
[24:50] him in prayer and they'll be traveling
[24:52] back I don't know if it's tomorrow or
[24:54] Tuesday but remember to keep them in
[24:56] prayer
[24:57] and I just wanted to I wanted to share a
[24:59] quote a scripture and a quote with you I
[25:00] woke up this morning and was just
[25:02] meditating because I didn't have the
[25:04] service on my mind as far as preaching I
[25:06] was just meditating and I got so super
[25:09] inspired just thinking about the
[25:11] resurrection and the Resurrection season
[25:13] and I started thinking about
[25:16] how for the rest of the world they're
[25:19] looking at a historical event
[25:21] and for us the historical event is
[25:24] priceless because without the Redemption
[25:26] that took place at Calvary there was no
[25:28] Redemption for us we would remain lost
[25:30] amen so for us it has a two-fold joy in
[25:34] our hearts it was the resurrection that
[25:36] was and the resurrection that is
[25:38] together amen is not only the historical
[25:41] event that purchased our Redemption but
[25:43] is the resurrection Ministry in this day
[25:45] that is bringing us to fullness of life
[25:48] and to the fullness of what that
[25:50] Redemption purchased for us
[25:52] so we can celebrate and have joy like
[25:55] nobody else they can Rejoice that Christ
[25:57] died but we can Rejoice that he lives
[26:01] amen I'd like to read just a scripture
[26:03] to you out of Ephesians chapter 2 this
[26:06] morning and then read something that
[26:07] brother Branham said
[26:09] Ephesians chapter 2
[26:13] verse 1. and you hathy quickened who
[26:18] were dead in trespasses and sins now
[26:21] we're talking about our personal
[26:23] Resurrection
[26:25] and then you were dead and what
[26:26] trespasses and sins and the greatest sin
[26:29] of all was unbelief stuck in
[26:31] denominationalism separated from the
[26:33] understanding and knowledge of God Amen
[26:35] but you have to be quick and who are
[26:37] dead in trespasses and sins wherein in
[26:39] time past you walked according to the
[26:41] course of this world according to the
[26:43] prince of the power of the air the
[26:45] spirit that now worketh in the children
[26:47] of Disobedience among whom also we all
[26:50] had our conversation in times past
[26:52] and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[26:55] desires of the Flesh and of the mind and
[26:57] we're by Nature the children of Wrath
[26:59] even as others but God who is rich in
[27:02] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[27:05] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[27:07] hath quickened us together with Christ
[27:10] by Grace you are saved and hath raised
[27:13] us up together and made us sit together
[27:15] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[27:20] so I don't have to wait to go to Heaven
[27:22] by grace and by faith in Christ I'm
[27:25] already seated there in Christ Jesus
[27:28] amen I just wanted to read something for
[27:31] you out of the rising of the Sun and
[27:33] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[27:35] remember said Hallelujah I'm sure you
[27:37] see what I'm talking about it was waived
[27:39] over the people and the first time there
[27:41] will come forth for the bride age for a
[27:44] resurrection out of dark
[27:45] denominationalism that's our
[27:47] Resurrection season
[27:49] will be a message
[27:51] that the full maturity of the word has
[27:53] turned back again in its full power and
[27:55] being waived over the People by the same
[27:56] signs and wonders that he did back there
[27:58] because I live ye live also speaking to
[28:01] his wife because I live you live also
[28:04] what a resurrection that was and what a
[28:07] resurrection this is to be quickened
[28:09] from the dead to be made alive in Christ
[28:12] Jesus by God's quickening power we don't
[28:15] just look back
[28:17] we look to today
[28:19] and we know what that purchase it
[28:21] purchased for us this Redemption
[28:23] amen Christ The Mystery of God are
[28:26] revealed he says when we see him coming
[28:28] down and living amongst the church
[28:29] that's his victory shows that he he
[28:32] couldn't keep him in the grave neither
[28:34] can they keep us that's right and we're
[28:36] already potentially raised because we've
[28:39] been raised from dead unbelief in his
[28:41] word from denominational Creeds to an
[28:43] eternal word of the Eternal God which is
[28:46] him himself working through US
[28:48] manifesting himself that he is the same
[28:51] yesterday today and forever
[28:54] again it arrives in the sun he says now
[28:56] you see now you are already resurrected
[29:00] when God raised him up he raised you the
[29:03] son is just now on you and now you're
[29:05] growing into a blossom life like he was
[29:07] to be resurrected completely in the last
[29:10] day your potentials you have now why do
[29:13] you know your soul changed didn't it
[29:15] your body comes in obedience to it

[36:12] amen
[36:14] so let's go in the word of the Lord
[36:18] and then we will pray
[36:21] Genesis 20
[36:23] 6 I mean chapter 1 26 verse the Book of
[36:29] Genesis we are going to read
[36:31] 26 27 verse of chapter 1.
[36:37] amen
[36:47] and God said
[36:49] let us make man in our image
[36:52] after our likeness
[36:55] and let them
[36:56] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[37:00] and over the fall of the air
[37:03] and over the cattle and over all the
[37:08] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[37:12] creeped upon the Earth
[37:14] so God created man in his own image in
[37:18] the image of God created he him male and
[37:23] female
[37:24] created hidden
[37:26] amen
[37:28] so let's pray
[37:32] our gracious Heavenly Father
[37:35] we thank thee today from the depths of
[37:39] our hearts for the privilege that we
[37:42] have of calling the Our Father
[37:47] and we are so happy this morning that we
[37:50] have been included in this great number
[37:52] of the redeemed and we are here this
[37:55] morning for no other purpose but worship
[37:59] thee to read Thy word and to find out
[38:04] how we could be better believers
[38:08] and to live a closer creation why walk
[38:11] for you and with you
[38:14] Eminence Among Us
[38:17] and we pray that you me you will meet
[38:20] with us around the world and will give
[38:22] to us that deep desire that we so want
[38:25] in our hearts
[38:28] because you have promise with us that
[38:32] whatsoever you will ask in my name it
[38:36] shall be given unto thee
[38:38] and also you said we are ever two or
[38:41] three gathered in my name I will be
[38:44] there
[38:45] we thank you for your
[38:47] unfailing promises
[38:51] that you are with us to guide us and to
[38:55] lead us because you said I will not
[38:57] leave you
[38:59] I will be with you even in you
[39:02] and we thank you for this Lord
[39:05] and if there is a special need
[39:08] in the body Lord
[39:10] and we know that you are here to meet
[39:13] that need
[39:15] and we thank you for that
[39:18] give us your word
[39:21] and put me aside Lord
[39:25] I have limited word but
[39:29] me the great Holy Ghost come down
[39:33] and give me utterance to speak
[39:36] and may your word come in
[39:41] and the power of the Holy Ghost
[39:44] we give you thanks praise and glory and
[39:48] commit everything into your hands in the
[39:51] name of Jesus Christ I pray amen
[39:55] thank you you may be seated
[40:01] so I would like to speak on
[40:05] Eve
[40:07] prefigures
[40:09] the church
[40:11] and as brother Chad told that what a
[40:16] resurrection that was and what a
[40:18] resurrection this is
[40:21] and we would like to talk about
[40:26] the Resurrection Life
[40:28] because
[40:30] he Jesus Christ
[40:34] has done more after his death
[40:38] amen he came
[40:41] as a son of man and purchased us
[40:45] redeemed us
[40:46] but paid the price and after that he
[40:51] changed his ministry and went to his
[40:54] Priestly Ministry meditorial work and
[41:00] since this last
[41:02] 2000 years during the seven churches
[41:06] amen he has done lot more and now he's
[41:11] doing in our lives amen so we would like
[41:15] to talk about these things amen
[41:19] because of his death
[41:23] amen
[41:25] we are gathered here
[41:29] so we have recently uh printed a book
[41:32] time tested Memorials of God
[41:36] in that merciful Branham said
[41:39] Christ has
[41:41] a slap established a memorial of his
[41:45] death that's his church we are the
[41:48] memorial amen
[41:50] Hallelujah
[41:52] so we see we have read here in the Book
[41:57] of Genesis which is the seed chapter and
[42:00] Prophet said you cannot understand the
[42:03] Book of Revelation until you know you
[42:06] are seen
[42:08] so this is the seed chapter and
[42:11] everything Prophet told us that which is
[42:14] in the Book of Genesis
[42:16] you will find in the Book of Revelation
[42:19] because Revelation is your crop
[42:23] amen so we are going to see
[42:26] uh in the Book of Genesis why God
[42:31] created a man
[42:33] why God created women
[42:36] what
[42:37] was his purple
[42:40] amen
[42:42] what was his purpose
[42:45] in creating man
[42:47] and woman
[42:49] amen
[42:51] so why did God create a man
[42:53] what was his purpose in creating man
[42:57] and God has given us this answer
[43:01] in these verses we have read here
[43:05] Genesis 1 26 and 27 amen and these two
[43:11] verses are of great significance
[43:16] amen because they revealed to us that
[43:20] God's creation of man was indeed and
[43:23] exceedingly special one
[43:26] so it says before God created a man he
[43:29] said let us make man in our image
[43:35] after our likeness
[43:37] and let them have dominion
[43:41] over the future of the sea
[43:43] and over the fall of the air
[43:46] and over the cattle and over all the
[43:50] Earth
[43:52] amen
[43:53] and then he said and over every creeping
[43:57] thing that creeped upon the Earth amen
[44:02] so this was God's plan
[44:05] creating man
[44:08] and that planet let him have
[44:12] dominion over all the Earth so when God
[44:17] created man to rule
[44:21] when God created a man immediately he
[44:24] disclosed his purpose
[44:27] so the man is created
[44:30] to rule amen
[44:34] and then also God said what kind of man
[44:38] he wanted
[44:40] he wanted a man after his own image and
[44:45] likeness amen
[44:47] and the Bible says God created man a
[44:51] male and female
[44:54] created he them amen and and verse 28
[44:58] says so I am going to read these verses
[45:03] chapter 1
[45:05] Genesis again and again so please bear
[45:09] with me
[45:10] amen
[45:12] again and again
[45:15] the same words amen 28 God blessed them
[45:21] and God said unto them be fruitful and
[45:25] multiply and replenish the art and
[45:30] subdue it and have dominion over the
[45:33] fish of the sea so that is 28 27
[45:38] I mean
[45:40] he said the same thing
[45:43] have dominion over
[45:46] the fish of the sea and over the fall of
[45:50] the air and over every living thing that
[45:54] moved upon the Earth amen
[46:00] from these verses we see the man that
[46:04] God
[46:05] desired God desire a ruling man
[46:10] amen a man who would rule upon this
[46:14] Earth
[46:16] then God would be satisfied
[46:22] amen
[46:24] so God's heart desired
[46:28] is
[46:30] that man May rule
[46:33] over his creation
[46:36] whatever God created
[46:39] after that he created a man
[46:42] amen
[46:45] and when God created man everything was
[46:49] already in existence
[46:52] and then God said rule over everything
[46:55] amen
[46:57] Hallelujah
[46:59] so God wanted a man like himself
[47:04] God wanted a man who
[47:07] who rule on the Earth
[47:11] amen it is very clear that
[47:15] man's position in God's creation is
[47:19] entirely unique
[47:20] for among all of God's creatures man
[47:24] alone was created in God's image
[47:28] amen the man that God 's heart was set
[47:33] upon was completely different from all
[47:36] other created beings
[47:38] he was a man in his own image
[47:42] amen
[47:44] because 27 verse says let us so God
[47:48] created man in his own image amen
[47:53] so when we see these verses
[47:56] we will realize
[47:59] the preciousness of man
[48:02] and we will rejoice whenever man is
[48:05] mentioned in the Bible
[48:07] amen
[48:09] so when we see the value of man in the
[48:13] sight of God
[48:14] then we can easily take burden for The
[48:17] Lost One
[48:19] because God has a great value
[48:24] for men
[48:25] even God himself became a man
[48:29] amen
[48:31] God's plan is to gain man when man is
[48:36] gained by God God's plan is accomplished
[48:40] but Branham said he need only one man
[48:45] who is completely totally surrendered to
[48:49] him
[48:49] and with that one man
[48:52] he can accomplish everything
[48:56] amen so it is by man that God's plan is
[49:01] fulfilled and through man his own need
[49:05] is met amen so what then does god
[49:08] require from the man whom he created
[49:13] it is that man should rule
[49:17] amen when God created man he did not
[49:21] predestine man to fall
[49:24] God made him eternal
[49:27] God made him ruler
[49:30] amen there was no sin no fall nothing
[49:33] because Genesis 1 Prophet told us that
[49:37] God made original man was a spirit man
[49:41] amen so in God's plan to create man man
[49:46] was ordained to rule amen so this is
[49:50] revealed to us in Genesis 1 26 when he
[49:54] said God where God unveils his his will
[50:00] his desire and tells us that his secret
[50:04] amen that let them have dominion over
[50:09] the fish of the sea and over the fall of
[50:12] the air and over the cattle and over all
[50:16] the Earth
[50:17] so this is God's purpose in creating man
[50:21] that
[50:24] man May rule
[50:26] amen
[50:29] and
[50:30] in the Millennium we are going
[50:33] to rule
[50:35] amen
[50:37] that's why we are here on the Earth
[50:42] because God is
[50:45] building a character in US
[50:49] and without character if the power comes
[50:54] it is satanic
[50:57] amen so we are here
[51:02] for tests and trials
[51:05] amen
[51:06] and his building us amen
[51:12] so why God
[51:14] has such a purpose
[51:17] it is because why God wanted us to rule
[51:23] why God has this purpose
[51:26] why God desired us to be a ruler
[51:31] because
[51:34] an angel of Light rebelled against God
[51:37] before man's creation and he became
[51:41] devil
[51:44] God Satan sinned and fell the day start
[51:49] became the enemy of God is you can read
[51:52] Isaiah 14. God therefore withdraw his
[51:57] authority from the enemy and put it
[52:00] instead into the hand of man
[52:03] the Reason God created man is so that
[52:07] man May rule in the place of Satan
[52:12] so that is why the battle is going on
[52:16] that is why
[52:17] the Satan is always after us
[52:21] because God took everything from him
[52:25] and give this in the hand of the man
[52:28] amen
[52:31] what abounding Grace we have in God's
[52:34] creation of a man
[52:36] so not only God desire that man should
[52:40] rule but he marks out his passive
[52:44] specific area for men to rule amen so
[52:49] Genesis 1 26 says let them have dominion
[52:53] over the fish
[52:55] over the of the sea and over the fall of
[52:59] the air and over the cattle and over all
[53:04] the Earth
[53:06] all the Earth is the domain of man's
[53:09] rule
[53:12] the area where God desired man to rule
[53:15] is the Earth
[53:18] and man is especially related to the
[53:22] Earth
[53:23] when God created Earth
[53:26] he gave the Earth to man as his
[53:30] permanent abort
[53:33] make shall inherit the earth
[53:36] amen the heaven is temporarily up there
[53:42] so all the heaven will be emptied out we
[53:46] all will come on Earth
[53:48] because Prophet told us that we are
[53:51] going to spend eternity on this Earth
[53:55] amen
[53:57] so Earth is related to man
[54:01] is given to him for
[54:04] eternity amen so now
[54:08] God created two person
[54:11] one is Adam
[54:13] and one is Eve amen
[54:17] both were created human beings
[54:21] but each tapify something different
[54:25] because the Old Testament is types and
[54:28] shadows
[54:30] I mean everything because the real thing
[54:34] the New Testament is the reality
[54:38] but everything how he told us in the
[54:42] book in the message Christ is the
[54:44] mystery of God revealed whatever God had
[54:48] in his mind he started to reveal things
[54:53] through the types and shadows
[54:56] in the lives of the Believers
[55:00] the prophets all were typed
[55:03] amen
[55:05] So Adam was a type
[55:09] he was a type
[55:11] amen and both that be buying something
[55:16] different
[55:17] First Corinthians
[55:20] 1520 says that Adam was a type of the
[55:24] Lord Jesus
[55:25] and then Romans 5 14
[55:29] says that Adam was a figure of the man
[55:32] who was to come
[55:34] man second man second Adam Christ amen
[55:39] Adam then foreshadowed Christ he
[55:43] portrayed Christ in figure or type in
[55:47] other words all that God purposed in
[55:52] Adam was achieved
[55:55] in Christ
[55:58] but beside Adam in the creation
[56:02] there was also the women
[56:04] if
[56:06] God very carefully recorded
[56:09] the creation of this woman in Genesis 2
[56:13] and when we come to Ephesians 5
[56:17] we clearly told that Eve is a type of
[56:22] the church
[56:23] amen therefore we can see that God's
[56:27] Eternal will is
[56:29] achieved partly through Christ
[56:32] and partly through the church
[56:35] Amen in order of us to understand how
[56:40] the church can achieve God's will on
[56:43] Earth we must learn from Eve
[56:47] because if is a type of the church
[56:52] so I'm
[56:53] taking this the message Christ is the
[56:56] mystery of God
[56:57] he was the pre-figure of the church amen
[57:03] so the purpose of this message is
[57:07] to discuss about Eve
[57:10] amen so we are not going to uh
[57:15] emphasizing on the work of Christ
[57:18] because we all are the work of Christ
[57:21] amen Eve so we are going to talk more on
[57:26] Eve the church second Eve amen Jesus
[57:30] Christ is the second Adam amen
[57:34] Hallelujah so when we read Genesis 2 18
[57:38] to 24 and Ephesians 5 22 to 32 we find
[57:45] that women is mentioned in both places
[57:49] in Genesis
[57:51] there is a woman
[57:54] and in Ephesians 5 there is also a woman
[57:58] the first woman
[58:01] is a sign that Define the church the
[58:07] second woman is the first woman
[58:10] the second woman is Ephesians 5. and
[58:13] first woman is
[58:15] Genesis chapter
[58:18] two
[58:19] amen
[58:22] the first woman was planned by God
[58:26] before the foundation of the world
[58:31] and that
[58:33] first woman also was created before the
[58:37] war
[58:40] amen
[58:41] and Paul took place later he was already
[58:46] in existence
[58:48] so Eve came on the scene before the fall
[58:51] amen so God created Adam to 35 church
[58:58] and also God created Eve to tampify the
[59:03] church amen so God's purpose did not
[59:06] only accomplished by Christ but is also
[59:11] accomplished by the church
[59:14] amen
[59:16] amen
[59:18] Genesis 2 18 says the Lord God said it
[59:24] is not good that the man should be alone
[59:28] I will make him a help meet for him amen
[59:34] so God's purpose in creating the church
[59:39] is that she may be the help meet of
[59:42] Christ
[59:43] because he was
[59:46] a helpmate of Adam so Christ Alone is
[59:52] only half
[59:56] amen
[59:58] there must be another half which is the
[1:00:01] church
[1:00:03] do you remember said we are the another
[1:00:06] half of the Chinese ticket
[1:00:09] this is another half and we are the
[1:00:12] other half of the Chinese taker we are
[1:00:15] the part of this word
[1:00:18] but Branham said when a man received the
[1:00:21] Holy Ghost he becomes the part of the
[1:00:24] Bible
[1:00:25] when we eat the book we become the part
[1:00:30] of the book
[1:00:31] amen
[1:00:32] amen so Christ Alone is only half there
[1:00:38] should be another half which is the
[1:00:40] church so God said let it is not good
[1:00:45] that a man should be alone
[1:00:48] this means that it is God's in God's
[1:00:52] Society Christ Alone is not good enough
[1:00:57] they should be help meet for Christ
[1:01:01] so Genesis 2 18 24 amen
[1:01:05] mention all these things when God
[1:01:08] created Adam
[1:01:10] after a period of time
[1:01:13] amen
[1:01:15] Adam we don't know for how many years
[1:01:20] because God showed his loneliness
[1:01:24] in Adam because Adam was
[1:01:27] amen
[1:01:30] so
[1:01:33] after a long period of time
[1:01:36] God created Eve
[1:01:40] after a long period of time God said it
[1:01:45] is not good
[1:01:48] it is not good
[1:01:51] that the man should be alone
[1:01:54] therefore he created Eve for Adam
[1:01:58] amen
[1:02:01] amen
[1:02:03] so I want
[1:02:07] this that
[1:02:09] should not be missed
[1:02:12] amen
[1:02:13] God said it is not good
[1:02:20] Eve should Adam
[1:02:23] should be alone
[1:02:25] but before that
[1:02:28] God said it is very good
[1:02:31] because God completed all of his
[1:02:34] creation
[1:02:36] so when we amen
[1:02:40] read Genesis chapter 1
[1:02:44] Genesis chapter 1
[1:02:47] ends when this ends with this record
[1:02:51] 31 is the last verse
[1:02:54] of Genesis 1.
[1:02:56] and it says and God saw everything
[1:03:01] that he made and behold it was very good
[1:03:08] so in Genesis
[1:03:10] God completed his creation
[1:03:13] and he created everything
[1:03:16] amen
[1:03:17] and when God saw
[1:03:21] everything was completed by that time
[1:03:25] and when God saw his complete creation
[1:03:29] which he created he saw it is very good
[1:03:35] amen
[1:03:36] from this we are allies that had having
[1:03:41] Adam alone
[1:03:43] or we may say having Christ Alone is not
[1:03:48] enough to satisfy God's heart
[1:03:51] because everything was created
[1:03:55] and God already said it is very good
[1:03:59] but now God said it's not good
[1:04:03] that man should be alone
[1:04:06] so God made a help meet for him amen so
[1:04:12] with God there must also believe
[1:04:16] that is there must also be the church
[1:04:19] then his heart will be satisfied
[1:04:23] amen so when Eve was there Adam was
[1:04:28] there
[1:04:28] when male and female was there God
[1:04:32] rested
[1:04:35] rested mean he was not tired
[1:04:40] amen rest means he was satisfied
[1:04:45] like when you have children and they
[1:04:49] help you in the work amen and you know
[1:04:53] that my son or my daughter is going to
[1:04:56] finish this work and you are at rest you
[1:04:58] are satisfied it does not mean you are
[1:05:01] tired
[1:05:02] so God was not tired
[1:05:05] he was satisfied
[1:05:08] because now
[1:05:10] man is there we manage there
[1:05:14] amen they are there to rule over his
[1:05:18] creation
[1:05:19] and he is satisfied
[1:05:22] he is resting
[1:05:27] amen
[1:05:28] the Lord God said it is not good that
[1:05:32] the man should be alone
[1:05:34] God desired to have both Adam and Eve
[1:05:39] his purpose is to have a Victorious
[1:05:42] Church
[1:05:44] Victorious Christ plus a Victorious
[1:05:48] church amen a Christ who has overcome
[1:05:52] the work of the devil plus a church
[1:05:55] which has overthrown the work of the
[1:05:57] devil amen his purpose is to have a
[1:06:01] ruling Christ and a ruling Church
[1:06:06] amen a ruling judge
[1:06:09] but Branham said a sin preacher amen
[1:06:14] Hallelujah this is what God planned for
[1:06:17] his own pleasure and he has performed it
[1:06:22] foreign his own sassification
[1:06:26] amen so God desired to have Christ and
[1:06:30] God desired to have a church which is
[1:06:33] exactly like Christ
[1:06:37] God not only desire that Christ would
[1:06:42] have dominion
[1:06:44] he also want the church to have dominion
[1:06:49] amen God allows the devil on Earth
[1:06:52] because he said let them
[1:06:55] have dominion let them have dominion
[1:06:58] Christ and the church have dominion both
[1:07:02] of them amen God purpose that the church
[1:07:07] as Christ counterpart
[1:07:10] should take part in dealing with Satan
[1:07:14] if the church does not match Christ
[1:07:17] God's purpose will not be fulfilled
[1:07:21] God is not satisfied in Warfare Christ
[1:07:25] need a help need
[1:07:28] and even in glory he also need to need
[1:07:31] help me amen
[1:07:34] God requires that church to be the same
[1:07:39] as Christ in every respect
[1:07:44] it is God's desire that Christ should
[1:07:47] have a helpmate
[1:07:50] two words in Genesis very meaningful one
[1:07:54] is
[1:07:56] Genesis 1 28 God says subdue
[1:08:00] that
[1:08:01] stabbed you is like conquer
[1:08:05] subdue is conquer
[1:08:08] amen God said
[1:08:10] to them conquer the Earth subdue it
[1:08:14] amen
[1:08:16] subdue with power or whatever and then
[1:08:21] the other word is keep Genesis 2 15.
[1:08:27] keep the Earth which is
[1:08:32] subdue it
[1:08:33] and then God
[1:08:35] because Satan was there
[1:08:40] amen we see from this Versa that God
[1:08:44] ordained a man to conquer and guard
[1:08:50] amen subdue and keep that so God's
[1:08:55] original intention is give the Earth to
[1:08:59] man as a place to dwell
[1:09:02] God desired through man to not allow
[1:09:06] Satan to introduce upon that
[1:09:10] amen
[1:09:12] so God give this in the hands of man
[1:09:17] that he may overthrow Satan
[1:09:21] and have dominion
[1:09:24] amen
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:30] so then what Garden
[1:09:34] because God do not want that man should
[1:09:38] be alone
[1:09:40] so then how God
[1:09:43] created Eve how Eve came on the scene
[1:09:47] amen
[1:09:49] because we know now see that Adam need
[1:09:54] help me
[1:09:56] amen because God said it's not good
[1:10:00] after completing completing everything
[1:10:04] amen what did God do to beat this need
[1:10:10] so Genesis 2 19 to 23 says and all of
[1:10:16] the ground the Lord God formed every
[1:10:19] beast of the field and every form of the
[1:10:23] ear and brought them unto Adam to see
[1:10:27] what he would call them
[1:10:29] and whatsoever Adam called f every
[1:10:33] living creature that was the name
[1:10:35] thereof and Adam gave names to all
[1:10:39] cattle and to the fall of the air and to
[1:10:43] every beast of the field but Adam there
[1:10:46] was not found a help meet for him
[1:10:49] God brought every kind of living
[1:10:51] creature before Adam but Adam could not
[1:10:56] find his help meet among them
[1:11:01] amen therefore the Lord God caused a
[1:11:05] deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he
[1:11:09] slept
[1:11:11] and he took one of his ribs and closed
[1:11:15] up the flesh instead it off
[1:11:18] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[1:11:22] from man made he a woman
[1:11:24] and brought her unto the man and Adam
[1:11:28] said this is now bone of my bones and
[1:11:32] Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called
[1:11:35] woman because she was taken out of man
[1:11:38] amen
[1:11:43] this was
[1:11:46] Adam's help me
[1:11:48] and pre-figure of the church
[1:11:54] according to Ephesians chapter 5
[1:11:57] the Bible says very clearly that all of
[1:12:02] the things made of Earth
[1:12:05] all the fall of
[1:12:07] all creature everything made God made
[1:12:11] out of the Earth
[1:12:12] amen
[1:12:15] we just read the scripture amen
[1:12:21] so all the creatures
[1:12:24] came from the Earth
[1:12:27] and then the Bible says there was not
[1:12:30] any help meet porn for Adam
[1:12:34] from the Earth
[1:12:37] from anything God created
[1:12:40] from the Earth
[1:12:42] was not
[1:12:45] helped me to Adam
[1:12:48] because
[1:12:50] the things made of Earth all those
[1:12:53] things were made of Earth and not taken
[1:12:56] out of the body of Adam
[1:12:58] which is not taken out of Adam's Body
[1:13:03] could not be his help me
[1:13:08] amen
[1:13:09] all the beasts of the pill the cattle
[1:13:13] and the birds of the air were made of
[1:13:16] Earth
[1:13:18] they were not taken out of Adam
[1:13:22] therefore they could not be the help
[1:13:25] meet to Adam
[1:13:26] we must remember that Eve was formed out
[1:13:31] of a rip taken from Adam
[1:13:34] therefore he was the constituent
[1:13:40] of Adam
[1:13:42] amen
[1:13:43] this means that the church comes out of
[1:13:46] Christ
[1:13:47] amen anything that is not of Christ is
[1:13:52] not the church
[1:13:55] the church is only that part which comes
[1:14:00] out of Christ
[1:14:02] anything which is not art of Christ
[1:14:05] cannot be the church
[1:14:08] cannot be his help meet
[1:14:11] amen we need to note a few more words in
[1:14:15] Genesis 1 26.
[1:14:18] and
[1:14:20] 27. God said let us make man in our
[1:14:25] image after our likeness and let them
[1:14:31] amen
[1:14:32] the man what is singular
[1:14:38] but immediately following the plural
[1:14:42] pronoun is them it's used
[1:14:47] the same pattern is used in verse 27.
[1:14:52] amen which says to God created man in
[1:14:57] his own image in the image of God
[1:15:01] created he him
[1:15:05] male and female created he them
[1:15:10] amen
[1:15:11] God created one man
[1:15:15] singular
[1:15:17] amen but we can also say that he created
[1:15:22] to
[1:15:24] one is to and Jetta two are one because
[1:15:28] he was in Adam
[1:15:31] amen so notice further verse 27 says God
[1:15:36] created man in his own image in the
[1:15:39] image of God created he him male and
[1:15:43] female created he them
[1:15:46] the way God created man is the same way
[1:15:50] he created them
[1:15:55] Eve was not taken from the Earth
[1:16:00] he was taken from Adam
[1:16:04] amen
[1:16:07] from this verses we see that if the
[1:16:10] church is not
[1:16:12] in a state which corresponds with Christ
[1:16:16] God will not rest
[1:16:19] and his work will not be completed
[1:16:24] not only is Adam in the image of God so
[1:16:28] also is if
[1:16:30] because in the image of God
[1:16:33] God created them
[1:16:36] amen so not only does Christ have the
[1:16:40] life of God
[1:16:42] the judge also has God's life
[1:16:46] amen
[1:16:50] so we see that the church comes out of
[1:16:54] Christ
[1:16:57] we should ask
[1:17:00] what
[1:17:02] is the church
[1:17:04] the church is the bad part which is
[1:17:08] taken out of Christ
[1:17:12] amen
[1:17:14] the church is the part
[1:17:17] anything
[1:17:21] Jesus said I came
[1:17:26] from the father
[1:17:29] and I go back in the father's bosom
[1:17:32] because he came out of
[1:17:35] gospel amen
[1:17:38] I think I'm pronouncing right amen
[1:17:42] and
[1:17:45] who does not come from heaven
[1:17:48] cannot get back to heaven
[1:17:51] because we are the continuation of the
[1:17:56] life which was in the mind of God as an
[1:18:01] attribute
[1:18:03] and then God created a body for us and
[1:18:07] that body we received from our parents
[1:18:11] but the life was in God
[1:18:14] Jin and then God put that Gene Soul a
[1:18:20] part of the Eternal World in our life
[1:18:24] I mean in our body
[1:18:27] and when we
[1:18:29] if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved
[1:18:32] so we will be the continuation of the
[1:18:36] same life
[1:18:38] in other side
[1:18:40] amen I mean if we have not come from God
[1:18:45] we cannot go back
[1:18:48] to God
[1:18:50] so the church
[1:18:52] is the part
[1:18:54] which comes out of Christ
[1:18:57] Adam is a type of Christ
[1:19:00] the fact that he was made from Adam
[1:19:04] signifies that the church is made from
[1:19:08] Christ
[1:19:10] remember the eve
[1:19:13] was made out of Adam's Rib
[1:19:17] since e y Eve came out from Adam she was
[1:19:22] still Adam
[1:19:25] amen
[1:19:27] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:19:31] she was a part of Adam
[1:19:34] she was the rib of Adam
[1:19:38] and she was the body of Adam
[1:19:41] the Bible says Genesis 5 2
[1:19:45] male and female created he them and
[1:19:48] blessed them and called their name Adam
[1:19:53] in the day when they were created
[1:19:56] so now we have to Adam
[1:19:59] one is male and one is female
[1:20:03] and this female is a help me to Adam the
[1:20:08] male so now two person
[1:20:11] one person
[1:20:13] in two body
[1:20:14] [Applause]
[1:20:17] but Branham said this is the great
[1:20:19] mystery that God divide himself in the
[1:20:24] believer
[1:20:25] and still he remains the perfect
[1:20:27] omnipotent
[1:20:29] amen
[1:20:32] Hallelujah
[1:20:35] so then what is the church
[1:20:38] the church is another form of Christ
[1:20:43] just add
[1:20:45] just as it was another form of Adam
[1:20:52] that's why we cannot come to church by
[1:20:56] joining church or by sheikhan said we
[1:21:00] have to born
[1:21:02] amen
[1:21:04] it is a birth
[1:21:06] in the family of God
[1:21:10] amen because when
[1:21:13] the birth is like our children are part
[1:21:18] of
[1:21:19] us the parent
[1:21:21] they are the extension of the same life
[1:21:25] I mean same life but now
[1:21:28] extended another body amen
[1:21:31] so the church is another form of Christ
[1:21:38] now Christ is in two bodies
[1:21:41] one is church
[1:21:43] and one is he himself
[1:21:48] I think that is a good message for
[1:21:50] Easter Good Friday
[1:21:54] amen
[1:21:56] and that's where he paid the price
[1:21:59] amen and he died for us
[1:22:03] and
[1:22:04] that that direction life
[1:22:08] amen is in the church you know
[1:22:10] same Christ Holy Ghost
[1:22:15] boy
[1:22:20] another in another body so now I would
[1:22:23] like to read
[1:22:24] quote couple of quotes but Branham said
[1:22:27] and now notice
[1:22:29] as God opened up the side of Adam and
[1:22:33] took Eve
[1:22:35] took out Eve by his own flesh and blood
[1:22:39] and divided his Spirit from masculine to
[1:22:43] feminist and put it in eve took the reap
[1:22:46] from under his side and made Eve out of
[1:22:50] it so God did the same thing taking out
[1:22:55] of the sight of Christ the blood and the
[1:22:58] water and Christ is the word and taking
[1:23:01] the word and making our pictures
[1:23:06] if
[1:23:08] see
[1:23:10] where Branham said God is taking
[1:23:14] Christ
[1:23:16] which is the word and making up his
[1:23:19] church if
[1:23:20] amen another quote the same
[1:23:24] I'm quoting Christ is the mystery of God
[1:23:27] will
[1:23:31] what happened in the pre-figure now
[1:23:34] he opened Adam's side and took part of
[1:23:39] his flesh which was Adam to make Eve the
[1:23:44] bride has to be the word for he is the
[1:23:47] word
[1:23:48] amen
[1:23:51] so that church
[1:23:53] is only that portion which has been
[1:23:58] taken out of Christ
[1:24:01] so the material
[1:24:04] of the church
[1:24:06] is Christ
[1:24:09] bridegroom and the bride
[1:24:12] are from the same material
[1:24:15] amen another quote
[1:24:19] the message is it's the rising of the
[1:24:21] Sun
[1:24:22] so I wonder brother Chad quoted from all
[1:24:26] these two messages
[1:24:29] amen
[1:24:30] so it shows us
[1:24:34] the Holy Ghost how the Holy Ghost is
[1:24:36] working
[1:24:39] in a simple way
[1:24:41] in US
[1:24:42] amen
[1:24:43] everywhere the Holy Spirit
[1:24:46] in the world
[1:24:49] saying the same thing
[1:24:51] amen
[1:24:53] when God made his first bridegroom
[1:24:57] he made the bridegroom first and he was
[1:25:00] both men and women
[1:25:02] in a spirit formed him in the dust of
[1:25:06] the earth to make him material and what
[1:25:09] is when he made Eve from Adam he took
[1:25:14] not another piece of clay
[1:25:17] he took from the same piece of clay
[1:25:21] I mean the same word for Adam was a
[1:25:25] spoken word
[1:25:26] so Brahman said when God created Eve he
[1:25:31] did not take clay but he took Adam
[1:25:33] because Adam was a part of the word the
[1:25:36] spoken word
[1:25:38] so the bride must also be flesh of his
[1:25:42] flesh and born of his born
[1:25:46] amen
[1:25:48] it is rising of the sun message amen
[1:25:53] the way
[1:25:55] he makes his bride is the way he makes
[1:25:59] his individual
[1:26:02] made out of same material like he was
[1:26:07] made out of Adam a rip from the side
[1:26:12] blasphemius name I quoted from that
[1:26:16] message I mean another quote the
[1:26:18] elements that came from the body is what
[1:26:21] makes his body it come it come from the
[1:26:25] body is the material that takes to make
[1:26:28] his bride because Adam had his bride
[1:26:32] taken from his body Christ has his bride
[1:26:36] taken from
[1:26:38] his body
[1:26:40] another quote birth pain she
[1:26:44] is to be the same bride the same kind
[1:26:47] built out of the same kind of material
[1:26:50] that she was in the first place
[1:26:54] amen
[1:26:57] so bre Branham
[1:26:59] talked about it many places
[1:27:02] bright and bright bloom
[1:27:05] are of the same material so without
[1:27:08] Christ
[1:27:10] the church has no opposition
[1:27:13] no life
[1:27:15] no living
[1:27:16] no existence
[1:27:19] without him we are nothing
[1:27:23] because the church comes out of Christ
[1:27:26] the church is the Christ in you
[1:27:31] Christ in me
[1:27:34] the Christ in him Christ in her amen and
[1:27:39] the Christ in all the Christians around
[1:27:42] the world the church is composed of that
[1:27:46] which is out of Christ
[1:27:48] which is not of Christ
[1:27:51] cannot be Church
[1:27:55] should be the same material man's Talent
[1:27:59] ability strength and all that he has are
[1:28:04] outside the church
[1:28:07] everything that comes from the carnal or
[1:28:11] natural life is outside the church
[1:28:14] and anything that is brought into the
[1:28:17] Church of the uh
[1:28:19] Church of the natural life will only
[1:28:24] result
[1:28:25] in trading Dawn not building up
[1:28:29] because that's carnal only that which
[1:28:31] comes out of Christ
[1:28:33] is
[1:28:34] in the church
[1:28:36] he was not made
[1:28:39] from clay
[1:28:41] amen
[1:28:43] Eve was made
[1:28:47] out of Adam and Eve is the type of the
[1:28:51] church amen so only that which came out
[1:28:56] from Adam
[1:28:58] not from clay
[1:29:00] can not be called Eve
[1:29:04] that's why
[1:29:08] the cattle the birds different things
[1:29:11] when God brought before Adam
[1:29:14] and God gave
[1:29:18] names to all of them
[1:29:20] and the Bible says but Adam has not
[1:29:24] found helmet for himself
[1:29:27] so
[1:29:29] when Eve came on the scene amen even the
[1:29:35] very meaning of Eve is taken out of man
[1:29:40] and Adam said
[1:29:42] she shall be called woman
[1:29:46] in Hebrew says Isha
[1:29:49] because she's taken out of each she
[1:29:52] shall be called Isha
[1:29:56] so the woman
[1:30:00] meal is taken out of man
[1:30:03] taken out of Adam and only that which
[1:30:08] comes from Christ can be called The
[1:30:11] Church
[1:30:12] whatever is not from Christ has nothing
[1:30:16] to do with the church
[1:30:18] he was constituted only of that which
[1:30:22] came out of Adam and the church likewise
[1:30:25] is constituted only of death which is
[1:30:30] ought of Christ
[1:30:32] whatever is of man himself is not the
[1:30:37] church
[1:30:38] nothing which comes out of human nature
[1:30:42] is the church anything out of the man
[1:30:45] himself
[1:30:47] the human nature the carnal mind
[1:30:51] it is something of the flesh
[1:30:55] that which is odd of Christ can be the
[1:30:57] church whatever is of man is not
[1:31:01] of the church amen
[1:31:05] Hallelujah only that
[1:31:09] amen which formed from the Resurrection
[1:31:13] Life of Christ is the church
[1:31:16] Adams help meet is also Adam's Body
[1:31:21] amen since the source of Eve's life was
[1:31:25] his very born
[1:31:27] amen So Adam was the basis of
[1:31:32] her existence
[1:31:34] no Adam Noe
[1:31:38] amen she could exist only because a part
[1:31:43] of Adam was in her it is the same with
[1:31:47] the church without him we have no life
[1:31:51] no existence we are nothing
[1:31:56] amen
[1:31:59] we are part of him
[1:32:02] only the life which Christ says
[1:32:05] imparted into US makes us a part
[1:32:09] of the church amen the basis of our
[1:32:14] being a part of the church is our new
[1:32:17] birth
[1:32:18] that's how he comes in the church by the
[1:32:21] new birth since it is then that Christ
[1:32:24] imparts himself into US amen therefore
[1:32:28] there is a need for us to live behave
[1:32:32] and act according to this life
[1:32:35] The Life of Christ the token
[1:32:39] amen the life of Jesus Christ has come
[1:32:42] back in the church God cannot do
[1:32:44] anything more for us than to impart his
[1:32:48] son into us that we may share the Life
[1:32:51] of Christ
[1:32:56] there is a great pleasure within us
[1:33:01] the hope of glory
[1:33:03] Christ Jesus
[1:33:05] Holy Ghost
[1:33:07] the life of God in us is everything we
[1:33:11] do based upon Christ or based upon
[1:33:15] ourselves
[1:33:16] anything based upon ourselves
[1:33:20] which is not of Christ
[1:33:22] if we have that we cannot accomplish
[1:33:25] God's purpose
[1:33:27] amen the church is the church only
[1:33:31] because there are many people who all
[1:33:35] share the same life
[1:33:37] you have a part of Christ I have a part
[1:33:40] of Christ that life amen and when we all
[1:33:46] comes together amen you have the portion
[1:33:49] of Christ and he has the poor has a
[1:33:52] portion of Christ each one of us has a
[1:33:55] portion of Christ when all of this
[1:33:58] portion of Christ are put together
[1:34:01] there is the church
[1:34:03] that is the church
[1:34:05] amen
[1:34:08] you have
[1:34:10] Christ's life I have all have
[1:34:13] amen because the church is
[1:34:16] a continuation of the same life
[1:34:20] same word
[1:34:22] same power everything same amen
[1:34:27] amen
[1:34:29] the Bible says God created man
[1:34:34] male and female
[1:34:36] the male is singular and the female is
[1:34:40] also singular
[1:34:42] a man
[1:34:43] Christ is singular and the church is
[1:34:47] also singular
[1:34:49] because in the sight of God there is
[1:34:52] only one Christ and only one church that
[1:34:56] is universal Body of Christ
[1:35:00] amenam said God has only one Church
[1:35:04] that is a journey word sleep
[1:35:07] one body of Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:35:10] hallelujah
[1:35:12] so now we saw
[1:35:14] God created a man to rule the Earth amen
[1:35:19] and then in type God showed it is not
[1:35:24] good that man should be alone so God
[1:35:27] made
[1:35:28] Eve
[1:35:29] help me for him and where that help it
[1:35:33] came
[1:35:34] from Adam's Body
[1:35:37] anything which is not of Adam's Body
[1:35:40] cannot go back to Adam
[1:35:44] amen that's how God
[1:35:48] broad Eve from his rape from his body
[1:35:52] moonoff is born Adam said when he saw
[1:35:56] Eve amen she is born of my born Flesh of
[1:36:01] My Flesh
[1:36:02] she shall be called Eve I mean woman not
[1:36:07] him amen woman because she is taken out
[1:36:11] of man
[1:36:13] Adam amen
[1:36:15] Adam was the material of which Eve was
[1:36:19] made
[1:36:21] likewise Christ is the material for the
[1:36:23] church God use Christ to make the church
[1:36:26] amen amen now we will see how he was
[1:36:30] made
[1:36:32] amen
[1:36:34] then we can understand how the church is
[1:36:37] made
[1:36:39] when we read Genesis 2 21 and 2 to 23
[1:36:43] and the Lord God caused a deep sleep
[1:36:48] so we saw
[1:36:50] Eve came from Adam but now we are going
[1:36:53] to see how he became
[1:36:55] how God brought him
[1:36:57] amen
[1:36:59] 21 221
[1:37:03] and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[1:37:05] fall upon Adam and he slept
[1:37:09] Adam slept
[1:37:10] and he took one of his ribs and closed
[1:37:15] up the flesh instead thereof
[1:37:17] and the reap which the Lord God had
[1:37:20] taken from man made he a woman and
[1:37:25] brought her unto the man and Adam said
[1:37:29] this is the now born of my wounds and
[1:37:32] Flesh show my flesh she shall be called
[1:37:35] woman
[1:37:37] why because she was taken out of man
[1:37:42] amen
[1:37:48] amen
[1:37:50] so we now see how Eve came out
[1:37:56] God put deep sleep
[1:38:00] on Adam
[1:38:03] when Adam was
[1:38:05] in deep sleep
[1:38:09] amen
[1:38:10] then God brought Eve
[1:38:15] God brought forth the church out of the
[1:38:19] death of Christ
[1:38:21] amen
[1:38:24] when we read here
[1:38:27] Genesis 2
[1:38:29] it says the Lord God caused a deep sleep
[1:38:34] to fall upon Adam
[1:38:37] the verse does not say that God caused
[1:38:41] Adam to die
[1:38:45] but says
[1:38:47] he calls him to fall into a deep sleep
[1:38:51] if death had mentioned then sin would be
[1:38:55] involved because death and sin
[1:38:59] are related
[1:39:01] so death is not mentioned there
[1:39:05] amen Adam's asleep
[1:39:09] type
[1:39:10] defines the child uh typifies the aspect
[1:39:16] of Christ's death which was not
[1:39:20] related to Redemption only
[1:39:25] but
[1:39:26] in the death of Christ there was an
[1:39:30] aspect
[1:39:31] which was not related to Redemption only
[1:39:35] but to the release of himself
[1:39:39] amen we are not saying that the death of
[1:39:42] Christ is not for Redemption
[1:39:45] we truly believe that
[1:39:49] his death
[1:39:50] involved
[1:39:52] amen his death is for our Redemption
[1:39:56] through his death we we are reamed
[1:40:00] he purchased us
[1:40:02] he redeemed Us by his death amen
[1:40:07] but there is another aspect of his death
[1:40:12] that is
[1:40:15] the releasing of himself for the
[1:40:18] creation of the church
[1:40:21] and when Christ released himself
[1:40:26] as his life to the church
[1:40:28] so there is nothing to do with the sin
[1:40:32] his death is the penalty for sin
[1:40:35] his death is redemption but after his
[1:40:39] death
[1:40:41] blood and water came after his death
[1:40:47] amen
[1:40:49] sin question is already solved
[1:40:53] price
[1:40:55] the penalty is already already been paid
[1:41:00] amen so God is taking something out of
[1:41:05] Christ and choosing it to create the
[1:41:09] church
[1:41:11] therefore sleepy Jews to testify his
[1:41:14] death
[1:41:15] through which men receive life
[1:41:19] amen Redemption
[1:41:22] and the deceiving
[1:41:24] of Life are to distinct things
[1:41:29] amen
[1:41:31] redempt we have Redemption through his
[1:41:34] blood
[1:41:36] but there was not only blood king
[1:41:39] water was also there Redemption involves
[1:41:43] and in aspect of dealing with our sin we
[1:41:48] have sinned and deserved to die
[1:41:50] therefore Christ came to bear our sin
[1:41:54] his death accomplished Redemption
[1:41:59] this aspect of his death is related to
[1:42:03] sin but there is another aspect of his
[1:42:06] death
[1:42:09] it is the imparting of himself to us so
[1:42:13] that through his death we may receive
[1:42:16] life
[1:42:17] remember Branham said the blood cell was
[1:42:21] broken
[1:42:23] and the
[1:42:24] dead blood cell when it was broken
[1:42:28] released a life
[1:42:31] amen
[1:42:33] and that life
[1:42:35] he imparted in US
[1:42:38] that day on Calvary amen
[1:42:42] so Eve could have
[1:42:46] was able to receive life because Adam
[1:42:49] slept
[1:42:51] amen
[1:42:53] Adam's sleep was not for Eve's
[1:42:56] Redemption
[1:42:59] because there was a man no fall that
[1:43:03] time
[1:43:04] it was so that a rib could be taken out
[1:43:08] for her creation that why Adam slept in
[1:43:13] the same manner and aspect of the death
[1:43:16] of Christ is for the imparting of life
[1:43:19] to the church
[1:43:21] blood cell was broken life was released
[1:43:25] amen
[1:43:26] death
[1:43:28] that life may come in the Believers
[1:43:33] in the church
[1:43:34] when Adam fell into Deep Sleep God took
[1:43:39] a rib from him likewise when Christ died
[1:43:43] something happened to his rib his side
[1:43:48] he's died already
[1:43:50] amen his side was not built for
[1:43:54] Redemption because the piercing occurred
[1:43:58] after his death
[1:44:00] amen so the problem of redemption had
[1:44:03] already been sold
[1:44:08] according to Jewish custom
[1:44:11] whoever was crucified had to be taken
[1:44:15] away Before Sunset
[1:44:17] if they were noted the soldiers would
[1:44:21] come and break their bones to speed
[1:44:24] their death
[1:44:25] and in Jesus Christ Our Lord's case when
[1:44:29] the soldier looked at the Lord Jesus and
[1:44:32] saw that he was already dead
[1:44:37] they did not break his bones
[1:44:40] amen
[1:44:42] his wounds
[1:44:44] cannot be broken
[1:44:46] that is his body that is the church amen
[1:44:50] instead they appears the side with the
[1:44:53] spear and blood and water flowed out
[1:44:57] this signifies that when his side was
[1:45:02] pierced
[1:45:04] the work of redemption had already been
[1:45:08] accomplished amen it reveals that the
[1:45:12] work of Christ not only involved the
[1:45:15] shedding of his blood to redeem us from
[1:45:18] sins but also the flowing Out of Water
[1:45:22] typeifying the imparting of his life
[1:45:27] to us amen
[1:45:30] the blood deals within as I told you
[1:45:32] this is what his wounded side speaks to
[1:45:36] us amen we all need to understand two
[1:45:40] aspects of Christ's death
[1:45:43] he died for our sin but then when he
[1:45:47] died that blood cell
[1:45:51] was broken to release the life
[1:45:55] the same life
[1:45:57] amen the same life
[1:46:01] amen
[1:46:08] blood and water came out it was the
[1:46:12] releasing of his life
[1:46:14] that his life may be imparted into US
[1:46:17] therefore the water terrifies the Lord
[1:46:21] himself he is the water of life amen
[1:46:27] so if
[1:46:29] came
[1:46:31] she came
[1:46:35] when God caused a deep sleep on Adam and
[1:46:40] he took his dream so Eve came out of
[1:46:44] Adam when he was sleeping Church came
[1:46:48] out of Christ
[1:46:50] when
[1:46:51] he slept I mean death because now
[1:46:55] death is necessary because the vases of
[1:47:00] sin is death and he took our sins and
[1:47:03] died amen
[1:47:07] amen
[1:47:09] so now
[1:47:12] before closing
[1:47:16] we see
[1:47:19] in God's side
[1:47:22] the church is sinless
[1:47:27] that's what he showed what he showed in
[1:47:31] the type amen
[1:47:33] when we read Ephesians 5 25
[1:47:39] we find the same meaning it says
[1:47:41] husbands
[1:47:43] love your wives even as Christ also
[1:47:48] loved the church
[1:47:50] and gave himself up for her
[1:47:54] amen so Christ loved the chair
[1:47:58] and give himself
[1:48:01] amen
[1:48:04] so first thing we see Christ
[1:48:08] gave himself up for us because we are
[1:48:13] the church
[1:48:15] amen and second Christ came give himself
[1:48:19] for us because he loved us
[1:48:24] a man not because we have sinned
[1:48:29] the Bible says
[1:48:32] Christ loved the church and gave himself
[1:48:35] for it
[1:48:36] the church
[1:48:38] he gave himself because of love
[1:48:42] I mean not because of our sin because
[1:48:46] somewhere in the Scripture it says
[1:48:49] he girl Christ loved us God loved us yet
[1:48:53] we were sinners
[1:48:56] because of love
[1:48:58] he gave himself
[1:49:01] amen for us Christ the Bible says also
[1:49:06] love the church and give himself to the
[1:49:11] church
[1:49:13] I mean notice Adam
[1:49:16] imparted his born to Eve
[1:49:21] Christ imparted himself to us as well
[1:49:26] we have him within us because
[1:49:31] he died he has already entered into us
[1:49:37] in the form of the spirit
[1:49:39] amen
[1:49:42] because he died we now have his very
[1:49:46] life within us he himself has been
[1:49:51] imparted to us
[1:49:53] amen that is the purpose
[1:49:57] she was
[1:49:59] if you remember
[1:50:02] he was created made before sin occurred
[1:50:07] so that all is type of pranam said if is
[1:50:11] a pre-figure
[1:50:13] I mean Prophet said of the church amen
[1:50:18] Eve came out of Adam
[1:50:20] and was
[1:50:23] holy for Adam completely totally for
[1:50:27] Adam
[1:50:28] not for
[1:50:30] anything else
[1:50:32] amen
[1:50:34] even so the church comes out of Christ
[1:50:37] and is completely for Christ
[1:50:42] the church in God's Force side has no
[1:50:47] history of sin
[1:50:49] because Church comes before the fall
[1:50:53] amen
[1:50:56] God when God saw us see us
[1:51:00] he see us under the blood
[1:51:04] and brother Branham said when you look
[1:51:08] red thing
[1:51:09] under amen
[1:51:13] under the red so you see white
[1:51:16] Justified
[1:51:19] so in God's side
[1:51:25] he had no desire to sin but but we
[1:51:29] trapped into sin
[1:51:32] we caught up
[1:51:35] but that seed Soul attributes Jin always
[1:51:40] longing
[1:51:42] for something eternal
[1:51:47] that's why he sent the Holy Ghost
[1:51:50] and quickened that seed
[1:51:54] and when that seed is quickened we
[1:51:58] recognize
[1:51:59] the part of the scripture for this day
[1:52:04] because we are the part of that
[1:52:06] scripture deep was calling to the Deep
[1:52:11] and when deep cold there was something
[1:52:15] deep in us to respond that call
[1:52:20] amen because
[1:52:22] the same part was here we are that's all
[1:52:25] is a part of the word
[1:52:29] amen
[1:52:31] so
[1:52:33] when Jesus came he said I will build my
[1:52:37] church no man
[1:52:40] I will build
[1:52:42] so the church is not something who comes
[1:52:46] accidentally
[1:52:49] amen church is worth in the mind of God
[1:52:55] before the foundation of the world
[1:53:00] and Bob Branham said that is his great
[1:53:03] Secret
[1:53:04] the mystery threefold
[1:53:08] what God was he poured himself into
[1:53:11] Christ and what Christ was he poured
[1:53:15] himself into the church and no both
[1:53:18] together
[1:53:20] amen God had preem Eminence in the Sun
[1:53:25] the same preeminent son has in the
[1:53:29] church in the bride
[1:53:30] no both together restored going back in
[1:53:35] the Garden of Eden
[1:53:37] amen
[1:53:40] go together same material everything
[1:53:42] same it is the rising of the sun brother
[1:53:45] said if right from it 16 cylinders so
[1:53:50] the bride
[1:53:52] amen
[1:53:53] seeing words
[1:53:55] John 14 12. same life
[1:53:59] amen everything seemed same body but in
[1:54:05] another form
[1:54:07] but both are Adam both are Christ
[1:54:10] amen so the church in God's forethought
[1:54:15] has no history of sin
[1:54:18] but in God's eyes
[1:54:21] the church has never been touched by sin
[1:54:26] the church is the part order of Christ
[1:54:29] which has never been touched by sin and
[1:54:33] known sin
[1:54:34] amen Romans 8 30. moreover whom he had
[1:54:40] predestined
[1:54:42] them he also called
[1:54:45] and whom he called then he also
[1:54:48] Justified
[1:54:50] and whom he justified them he also
[1:54:54] glorified
[1:54:56] amen
[1:54:58] he already glorified
[1:55:02] amen
[1:55:05] Justified meaning but Branham said
[1:55:09] you never
[1:55:11] you never
[1:55:13] sin
[1:55:17] it is like when in the garden Garden of
[1:55:22] Gethsemane
[1:55:24] soldiers please came
[1:55:27] to
[1:55:30] uh
[1:55:32] to find Jesus
[1:55:34] to arrest him
[1:55:36] and
[1:55:38] Peter took his sword
[1:55:42] and cut
[1:55:44] the
[1:55:46] year of priest's servant
[1:55:52] so Peter is
[1:55:56] guilty
[1:55:59] can be condemned because he cut the air
[1:56:03] how Jesus Justified him
[1:56:06] he took the year
[1:56:08] and put that back on the servant no body
[1:56:14] can prove
[1:56:17] nobody can prove that Peter is guilty
[1:56:23] so that's why Branham said when God sees
[1:56:26] us in God's side
[1:56:29] we never had sin
[1:56:32] we are pure virtuous Justified
[1:56:35] [Applause]
[1:56:37] amen so that's why the eve comes before
[1:56:41] the fall
[1:56:43] amen before the fall and to whom he
[1:56:47] justified
[1:56:49] then he also glorified
[1:56:52] that which is completely without sin is
[1:56:56] called Eve and that which is holy art of
[1:57:00] Christ is called the church that which
[1:57:03] is entirely from Christ and will be
[1:57:07] solely for Christ
[1:57:09] is Eve the church if typifies a
[1:57:13] corporate man made of God because we are
[1:57:16] many
[1:57:17] but one body
[1:57:19] amen One Church universally one body the
[1:57:24] church is the portion which is Art of
[1:57:27] Christ Alone
[1:57:30] not something else Christ Alone
[1:57:34] amen we must see that the church is the
[1:57:39] vessel chosen by God to manifest his son
[1:57:44] Christ
[1:57:46] in US and to achieve his eternal purpose
[1:57:50] through us through the church
[1:57:52] that's why I said cry Christ one
[1:57:55] Victorious Church
[1:57:58] ruling church with him we will rule with
[1:58:01] him reign with him
[1:58:02] amen so this is God's Eternal purpose
[1:58:07] God desires to obtain a child a
[1:58:12] corporate man in whom everything is
[1:58:16] order of Christ and for Christ Christ in
[1:58:20] all
[1:58:22] guys
[1:58:24] all in all
[1:58:27] everything cried
[1:58:29] amen as Bob Branham said Angel is Christ
[1:58:32] cherubim means Christ to set up him
[1:58:35] Christ
[1:58:36] and everything in the nature types
[1:58:40] Christ
[1:58:41] the church is
[1:58:43] Christ
[1:58:44] in another body amen there is
[1:58:49] that's God's external purpose amen
[1:58:53] church is not
[1:58:55] comes
[1:58:58] as an accident but that it was planned
[1:59:02] by God
[1:59:03] in a
[1:59:05] eternity past
[1:59:07] amen the church is eternal because it is
[1:59:10] God's Eternal plan and of Gods
[1:59:17] economy amen church is eternal because
[1:59:21] it was in his eternal thought amen
[1:59:26] Genesis 2 18 says and the Lord God said
[1:59:31] it is not good that the man should be
[1:59:35] alone I will make him a help me for him
[1:59:40] the creation of Eve was for
[1:59:48] law gods
[1:59:51] hearts desire
[1:59:53] because everything was completed
[1:59:57] and God said it is very good
[2:00:00] but after that God said it's not good
[2:00:05] that's why vibranam said
[2:00:08] besides salvation
[2:00:10] the greatest the best thing amen
[2:00:14] God could give to man is women
[2:00:18] his wife
[2:00:20] a man
[2:00:23] because God had such a desire
[2:00:27] he performed it
[2:00:29] God's creation of Eve in Genesis 2
[2:00:35] shows how God purpose to have the church
[2:00:39] from eternity to Eternity
[2:00:42] amen
[2:00:44] God is after such a church
[2:00:47] to satisfy his heart
[2:00:52] after he made male and female he entered
[2:00:56] into rest
[2:00:58] amen God was satisfied because he
[2:01:03] obtained obtained such a church
[2:01:06] so Man was created for God
[2:01:09] man was to be the temple of God the
[2:01:14] place of God's rest
[2:01:16] we are
[2:01:18] the temple of God
[2:01:22] there
[2:01:24] God made dwelling in a dwell in Us in
[2:01:28] the form of Holy Ghost amen
[2:01:31] to have rest
[2:01:34] that now we do
[2:01:36] amen
[2:01:38] it's like adoption
[2:01:41] now the sun can sign the check
[2:01:45] amen everything belonged to him
[2:01:48] so in God's purpose
[2:01:50] so God God
[2:01:52] want
[2:01:54] wanted to achieve
[2:01:57] his goal
[2:01:58] so then God
[2:02:01] made Administration
[2:02:05] and that Administration on the earth is
[2:02:08] his church
[2:02:10] now man so through the church
[2:02:15] Amen to us
[2:02:19] he is doing
[2:02:22] and we are
[2:02:26] Branham said cause of his death he died
[2:02:30] for us to bring the church amen
[2:02:32] so in God's side
[2:02:35] we are seen free
[2:02:38] Justified
[2:02:40] even glorify
[2:02:41] amen that's why
[2:02:45] he said wish Christians should be the
[2:02:49] happiest people
[2:02:51] on the Earth
[2:02:52] nothing to worry
[2:02:54] their ups and downs are there
[2:02:57] battle is there amen but according to
[2:03:01] God's Eternal plan

[2:07:47] [Music]
[2:07:56] at your
[2:07:58] own
[2:08:01] [Music]
[2:08:04] I will give everything
[2:08:09] alone
[2:08:19] oh God
[2:08:20] who cure
[2:08:24] there's not one thing you said you
[2:08:28] haven't done
[2:08:31] [Music]
[2:08:33] someday when I see you standing face to
[2:08:38] face
[2:08:39] my praise for you
[2:08:43] you have begun
[2:08:47] I will see
[2:08:51] I worship
[2:08:54] because
[2:09:01] [Music]
[2:09:03] [Applause]
[2:09:07] [Music]
[2:09:15] oh praise God aren't you glad by
[2:09:18] revelation we know where we came from
[2:09:21] the church came out of Christ it is a
[2:09:24] continuation of the Life of Christ
[2:09:26] that's why she has no sin because sin
[2:09:29] has already been taken care of before
[2:09:30] the church came out of Christ oh I
[2:09:33] absolutely love that amen it gives us
[2:09:36] the strength to overcome because we were
[2:09:38] born in the hybridization and stuck in
[2:09:41] this body of nature with a sticky
[2:09:42] cucumber nature but that's not we're
[2:09:44] looking at that's not the part it's the
[2:09:46] seed on the inside amen and it's that
[2:09:49] Life of Christ that's been imparted into
[2:09:51] us and brought us a new birth
[2:09:53] and now we can say we look in the mirror
[2:09:55] and we see faults amen but when we look
[2:09:57] in the mirror of the word and see Christ
[2:09:58] there is no fault
[2:10:00] [Music]
[2:10:03] that's why there has to be a new birth
[2:10:04] and the new birth is not the flesh
[2:10:06] remember I mean as Nicodemus said must I
[2:10:09] return into my mother's womb and he
[2:10:11] wasn't talking about this this will be
[2:10:13] fixed later amen but he was talking
[2:10:15] about the New Birth that seed coming to
[2:10:18] life on the inside
[2:10:20] oh praise God and by that that's the
[2:10:23] impartation of Christ's life into us and
[2:10:26] now the life we live we no longer live
[2:10:28] but he comes in and lives through us
[2:10:31] oh what are we called to do Just
[2:10:33] Surrender and just yield and just let
[2:10:35] him have his way
[2:10:36] it's all him
[2:10:38] I'm so glad that the sin question was
[2:10:40] answered first before the bride came out
[2:10:44] she was birthed with no sin
[2:10:48] Eve was birthed with no sin the church
[2:10:50] was birthed with no sin
[2:10:52] and that's what we've been restored back
[2:10:54] to in this end time
[2:10:56] it's why the prophet of God could preach
[2:10:57] his Thanksgiving message not an Easter
[2:10:59] message but a Thanksgiving message he
[2:11:01] goes I'm so thankful for this that use
[2:11:03] the Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus
[2:11:06] Christ
[2:11:07] amen
[2:11:09] now she was what she was birthed The Man
[2:11:13] was created to rule on the Earth
[2:11:16] and now I say she's been created to rule
[2:11:19] with him and we know that it'll be fully
[2:11:21] restored in the Millennium but now I
[2:11:24] think it's time for Christ and his bride
[2:11:25] to rule the Earth and I say he can rule
[2:11:28] this earth right here
[2:11:30] how about your Earth amen can Christ and
[2:11:33] his bride together rule that portion of
[2:11:34] Earth and have dominion oh praise God
[2:11:38] just want to say God bless you I enjoyed
[2:11:41] the word this morning
[2:11:42] so glad that because he lives she lives
[2:11:46] also
[2:11:47] without Adam Eve had no existence the
[2:11:50] woman had no existence because she came
[2:11:52] out of him and without Christ the church
[2:11:55] has no existence but my existence is
[2:11:57] because he lives I live also praise God
[2:12:01] thank you brother Rashad I pray God will
[2:12:04] restore our brother's strength and
[2:12:05] blessing and he'll return by the grace
[2:12:07] of God this Wednesday for another
[2:12:09] service let's just bow our heads and
[2:12:11] Thanksgiving to the Lord
[2:12:13] dear Lord Jesus we thank you so much
[2:12:17] for you have been so good to us Lord
[2:12:19] God just to remind us of where we came
[2:12:22] from Lord not this Tabernacle that we
[2:12:25] dwell in but the real life down on the
[2:12:27] inside that part that was with you
[2:12:29] before the foundation the world the
[2:12:31] thought that you had that you choose to
[2:12:33] express in this body of Flesh may we
[2:12:37] identify with the right thing Lord may
[2:12:39] we by Revelation have the scales peeled
[2:12:42] off of our eyes and may we maybe go
[2:12:44] beyond the veil of even our own flesh
[2:12:46] and find what is laying behind that Veil
[2:12:49] may we find you Lord tabernacled
[2:12:52] within each of it every one of us God I
[2:12:56] pray that this great Revelation would
[2:12:58] bring us into a greater life
[2:13:00] father we would be able to overcome the
[2:13:02] obstacles even in the flesh recognizing
[2:13:04] that it's just flash it'll be changed
[2:13:07] but that which is in me is greater than
[2:13:10] that which is in the world
[2:13:12] God I prayed you live your life through
[2:13:13] each one of us take Dominion Lord sit on
[2:13:15] the throne of our heart and rule this
[2:13:18] portion of the flesh or this portion of

[2:13:23] sit with you in your throne in our heart
[2:13:25] and Rule and Reign Over this portion of
[2:13:27] Earth that you might express yourself
[2:13:29] through our flesh
