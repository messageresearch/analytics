[Music] i john who also am your brother in companion and tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the aisle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou see us to write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia under ephesus and unto smyrna under pergamus and unto thyatira and unto sardis and then to philadelphia and until leo to see him and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and then god bless you as you're seated and then the subject that i i want to take the subtitle is the presence of the judge so the seven golden candlesticks i want to talk this evening about the presence of the judge and when i came to this i've been looking at this for for several weeks and as i i knew i was coming to this section and wanted to minister on it amen i had an expectation of how i would minister on this but like i said before my expectation has changed amen and i thank god for that and so first i want to start off with this statement where he heard a voice amen he was he was uh in the spirit on the lord's day and heard a voice behind him as of a trumpet and then he turned to see the voice and he saw seven golden candlesticks here's what brother benham said under the church age book and i've alluded to this a few times but he said i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks john does not say that he turned to see the one whose voice he heard but he turned to see the voice oh i liked that he turned to see the voice the voice and the person are one and the same jesus is the word amen this is such a statement amen that he turned to see the voice the scripture is very uh specific in the way it's worded he didn't turn to see the one who spoke he turned to see the voice amen because the the the voice in the person he says you're a one and the same jesus is the word then he goes to john 1 1. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made if you can ever get to really see the word you will be seeing jesus that statement did something for me if you can ever if you can ever get to really see the word you will be seeing jesus amen that's what we want to see amen everybody wants to see the lord amen but with this in order to see him if you ever really see the word you will be seeing jesus because he is the word amen let's continue on and pick up at verse 13 and continue reading and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with the garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace in his voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou saw us are the seven churches amen so brother branham goes on to say in the thyatiran church age referring to this portion of scripture he says but between his priestly operation when the sanctuary is left then we find him standing there and john said he was in the spirit on the lord's day not the seventh day not sunday that's all mistaken we found we found that out searching it through the scripture it was the lord's day this is the day of man the coming of the lord will be his day and we find him in the lord's day and when and when he seen the lord he had on a snow white hair and we know that that represents a judge another thing he he was not priest then because the priest was tied around the middle means service but he was tied around the paps up here which means that he was a judge amen and we see him walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and now we took back to the ancient of days being white at the white throne judgment when daniel saw him come to the ancient of days whose hair was as white as snow now white the old english judges down through the years used to be when they went into judgment seat they put on a big white wig snow white wig because they were judges and john saw him in the lord's day when he was a judge amen so when john turns to see the voice and many see seven golden candlesticks and one like unto the son of man in the midst and then we have the description and the description begins with the white hair and it moves all the way down through eyes is a flame of fire feet is brass sword going out of his mouth and we see him as a judge and brother brahma says in several places not a priest but as a judge amen not in a priestly dispensation but in a judge dispensation and so it brings us to this picture and i'm going to quote out of the message it is the rising of the sun it says and now as as this went up we have the picture outside on the plaque but then i have the picture laying present here if you notice as life magazine had it but i wonder if my audience visible here has ever really looked at the picture see see in the way it should be you remember i was preaching when this vision came upon the subject of the book of revelations where the old judges where we seen jesus in revelation 1 when we started to open the seven seals or the church ages rather just prior to the opening of the seven seals christ was standing with hair like wool white and i described that to you that the old english judges and judges of long ago when they went to the bench to be sworn in their supreme authority was given them they wore a white wig as it was over their heads to show their supreme authority well if you'll turn the picture like this if you'll turn the picture like this and look you can probably see it from the audience it's christ see his eyes looking here just as perfect as could be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and judge of all heavens and earth can you see his eyes nose his mouth just turn the picture from this the way they had it this away the way it's supposed to be and can you see it he is supreme judge there is none other but him and that is a perfect identification again a vindication that this message is the truth this is the truth it is true and making him not a third person but the only person so when brother venom was instructed to take the picture and turn it to the right he knew that it was a pyramid of angels and he knew he had gotten caught up in the constellation of angels amen he knew it was a supernatural cloud and but when he's told to turn it then he recognized that it was christ and he even said in one place that is our lord up there and he saw christ come as the white wigged one as the judge as the supreme judge of all heavens and earth supreme deity amen and he says this is another vindication that this message is the truth amen why because when we see him this time we see him coming as a judge it's a vindication that the message is true so why is it a vindication the message is true amen because if he's taken the book and loosed the seals amen he's not coming now as priest he's coming now as judge so when brother branham sees him as the white wigged one amen it's a vindication that the message he had preached is the truth the seals are open amen so he said this is another vindication there's this is none other but him and there's a perfect identification again a vindication that this message is the truth this is the truth it is true and making him not a third person but the only person praise be to god so brother lamb goes on to say further in it is the rising of the sun and the very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us and there he's standing there supreme judge showing that he is alpha omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power did that to us so it was very significant that brother bannon saw him amen and we all could see him amen in this dispensation as the white wigged one and we he shows it in revelation chapter one that in the day of the lord amen he uh john is in the spirit on the day of the lord amen and that's at the coming of the lord and he sees the the a seasoned image when he hears a voice he turns to see what he sees is seven golden candlesticks which represent the seven church ages and one like the son of man in the midst in the form of a judge so the judge is in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks are in the midst of the bride amen and so there's something significant that that transpired in a transition of dispensations amen and brother branham was talking in 1961 in revelation chapter four part three and i just want to uh uh rehearse some things we've been over before but so we're all on the same page so that we can move forward together amen brother branham goes to in this in this message revelation chapter 4 from 1961 he preaches this after he's done with the church ages and before he's come to the revelation of the seven seals and he's in revelation four and he takes us to back to leviticus 16 the day of atonement and the movement in the work of the high priest on the day of atonement and brother ben shows us that on the day of atonement which was one day out of the whole year the high priest would go alone into the holy of holies amen and he would go first offering blood for himself and his household so that he would be an accepted high priest and then he would go and he would carry in blood from a sacrifice representing the entire nation of israel amen so that he could he could he could perform the ceremony that would bring an atonement or a covering for all the people of israel all of god's people and in doing so he would go when he took that blood he would go around behind the altar behind the throne amen the mercy seat the ark of god and he would turn back to the east and he would sprinkle seven times upon the top of the mercy sea and brother brenham said in this message he said don't forget that word eastward where's jesus coming from the east and the cloud of glory where does the sun rise in the east so brother baby keeps pointing back to the east and and he and he he says oh isn't that beautiful seven times towards the east what is it the seven church ages shall be covered by blood so he's showing that we have amen a high priest that has gone into the heavenlies as paul talks about and he's there making an atonement he's mediating for the sins of man and and what's he doing he's atoning for our sins and brother man shows us in the day of atonement that's what the high priest was doing and and the high priest had to go around amen behind the altar this is why amen jesus or brother venom is saying in the seals amen john looked all over heaven but he didn't see he didn't see the man that could take the book he didn't see the lamb and all of a sudden he began to weep and they said hey behold the lion of the tribe of jude and he turned and from the midst of the throne came the lamb he hadn't seen him brother graham said where was he he said he was back behind the throne amen so when john in in revelation chapter five and the cry goes out where's a man who's worthy and john looks all over but he doesn't see this slain lamb he doesn't see the lord amen and where is he at and brother man said he's back in the eternities he's back there he uses all this language through the seals he's back behind the throne you have to say what's he doing back behind the throne amen he's mediating for seven church ages that's what he's doing back behind the throne because that's where the high priest went amen and then when the high priest was done with seven stripes he came out before the throne and he sprinkled in front of the throne seven times as if he's tearing seven seals off before the throne amen almighty god so so we know that through the church ages he's in the office of priests but brother ben says here in revelation chapter 1 in the day of the lord or the lord's day we see him in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks as a judge and then brother branham when he comes to the preaching of the seven seals which we know the lamb is the only one who can take the book and the lamb has to take the book amen and when he takes the book now we see him coming as the white wig one now he's coming as the judge so this places us in time in our dispensations and i want to go and look at this day of atonement of the book of hebrews hebrews chapter 9. verse 6 now when these things were thus ordained the priest went always into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of god but unto the second which is the holy of holies went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people now this becomes really important because paul is giving us information on this on this sacrifice this feast of atonement and this work of mediation of the high priest he is atoning for the errors of the people and this word error means a sin committed through ignorance and thoughtlessness it's become so important a sin committed through ignorance and thoughtlessness and it god in his mercy when he when he set the feast for israel to keep they were the feast of the lord he provided a feast in which a high priest would make an atonement to cover their sins of ignorance and thoughtlessness not what they did on purpose and not even what they knew was wrong but the things they didn't even know that they were doing that were wrong god was even going to cover those sins by the mediation of a high priest all right well this becomes so incredibly important when you get into the church ages because the church ages were blinded from the full revelation of god they did not have the full word we know that luther smoked and luther drank and luther consented to the persecution of jews amen we understand that that john wesley ordained women ministers and and then they both held to trinitarian ideas and trinitarian baptisms and and all forms of of things that are contrary to the word of god amen and steeped in unbelief but yet luther was a man of god wesley was a man of god they meant the pentecostals in the pentecostal revival they were people of god they were god's children god's elect god's bride and how could they be baptizing in trinitarian baptisms and be god's elect how could they be adorned uh ordaining women ministers and be god's elect how could they be smoking and drinking and swearing and condemning the jews and be god's elect amen because there was darkness amen because of the falling away of the of the cycle of redemption the fall of the church and the restoration of the church they were in in a condition amen where the church had been hybridized where the word had been lost and god was going to restore back the word but god in his mercy in his love for his people he commissioned a high priest to make an atonement for them with seven sprinklings of blood to cover the seven church ages so so you it's so imperative to understand that this is god's great love for his people that he will cover for sins of ignorance because the word wasn't available to luther amen but when you go back to israel that the the only sacrifice was not the feast of atonement in the in the and the goat that was sacrificed that wasn't the only sacrifice there was sacrifices that went all daily into the tabernacle upon the altar there was peace offerings transgression sacrifices sin offerings uh iniquity offerings for iniquity and transgressions of the law they were constantly offering sacrifices to the lord according to the commandment of the law so the law wrote that if you if you disobeyed the word and you knew that you were wrong you were obligated to take a sacrifice amen to the priest so that that sacrifice would atone for your sins so it's not that a worshiper could just wait for the day of atonement no if he knew he was wrong he was obligated to bring a sin offering to bring a transgression offering amen he had to offer for his sins he had to confess his sin and he had to repent of his sins he couldn't just leave it to the high priest on the day of atonement to take care of it no the high priest was there for the things that were not revealed to him that he was doing wrong they were the things that were in darkness to his mind he didn't understand and he didn't know god in his mercy was covering that because he didn't know but if that worshiper knew he was required to repent of that sin and offer a sacrifice that's why in luther's day you were required to come to the knowledge of justification amen you were required to accept that word and surrender everything to that word jesus was not there mediating amen to cover your sin for refusing a word that he'd revealed because to reject the revealed truth in every day was to reject christ and he was not there mediating to cover for your sins of rejecting the revealed word he was there covering for what was not yet revealed luther didn't live a sanctified life but it wasn't the age of sanctification that wasn't revealed to god's people that would come under wesley's dispensation so christ was mediating to cover for luther's lack of sanctification that's why we you know my god when god reveals the truth he requires he requires a repentance and a submission to that word and it's god's grace that he reveals something from his mind his will when he brings a revelation through a messenger through a prophet when he brings that that's god's grace to us to know his will and his desire and his people want to know his will and it's a true it's a pleasure for them to obey the lord it's a pleasure for them to repent and line up with the word so that israel was not free if they transgressed willfully and knowingly against god and refused to bring the required sacrifice and was saying the high priest will cover for it for the day of atonement no it wasn't covering for that sin it was covering for the sins of ignorance this is how god could require adherence to his word through each church age amen so we're all together on this so the white wigged one is present how many believes that the white wicked one is present in the patmos vision brother bam says now let's watch him just a little further as we take the rest of the 13th verse and in the midst that's the middle of the golden candlesticks one like the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the past with a golden girdle now here's more proof that this doctrine is right about it being the lord's day did you notice him he was not a priest during this time neither was he a king he was a judge this is amazing jesus christ is always the prophet priest and king right always he's always but he has dispensations and of operation and here brother branham saying he's not a priest during this time neither was he a king because we're not yet ready for the millennium but we're not yet we're not still under mediation through the church ages and we're not yet ready for the throne of david to be established but there's a dispensation in between these dispensations between the priesthood and between the kingship amen and that is judge that's what he's saying he was not a priest during this time neither was he king he was judged so so there's no time there's i'd say this way there's not any time that he's not a priest there's not any time that he's not a judge there's not any time he's not a prophet there's not any time he's not a king he's still the king when he's the priest he's the king when he's the judge but brother bram's talking about dispensations he's showing we're between mediation and the setting up of the kingdom on earth he was a judge notice a a priest a high priest when he went to the sanctuary or went to minister to serve to service he tied himself around the waist tying his girdle around the waist meant he was serving never tied it over his shoulder but here he comes out walking out with the girdle tied around the top with a sash over his shoulder girded about the paps the breast with a golden girdle girded up high what is it an attorney a judge the judge with the sash over his shoulder girded up there not down as a priest that shows he wasn't in his priesthood now john went all the way over to the lord's day and saw him coming as the judge i'd like to read another quote out of christ as the mystery of god revealed he says see what i mean he has begun to give life into his body why the one that he has redeemed the mediatorial work is done he's bringing his life to body what does that mean he's bringing his life to body what body the body of his bride the mediator work is done he's bringing his life to body and a vindication for the rapture amen brother bram says this isn't christ is the mystery of god revealed he's showing amen where we're at and dispensations amen the mediator work is done the lamb has taken the book the church ages are finished amen now he's coming to unite with his bride and he gives the sign in heaven as the sign of the white wig one as the judge showing what dispensation we're in now is this of judge so we know these things we've talked about these things but they're they're so important that brother ben spent time explaining these things to us so that we would understand and now we realize that that there's a scare and there's a fear in saying that the mediator work is done and he's no longer in the ministry of high priest now he's judged because the fear is that there will be no hope for anybody after that point right has anybody ever heard anything like that that there's no hope for anybody after that point amen and and i would like to just uh i'd like to just say that it's a dispensational change but god has never left his people without mercy never at any time has he left his people without mercy he's a merciful god and his mercies are new every morning he is not going to leave his people his seat his elect without mercy amen at no time has he ever left his people without mercy he's a merciful god and so now he's coming as judge because this is the dispensation amen and he's in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks or in the midst of the bride and and i and i just want to take and and go on a journey the journey that i went on when my mind shifted monday morning in prayer and realize that the greatest thing that ever happened to the bride of jesus christ as that he came among her as a judge that he came among her as a judge amen because it shows that the days of ignorance are passed amen that the partial revelation are over amen that he doesn't need to sit back and mediate like he did through the church ages because at the opening of the seals he unlocked the mystery that was in the back part of his mind and he had already tied together the loose ends and gave the revelation of the whole book unto his bride and now he does not need to stay back and mediate but what he needs is to come amongst her as a judge amen and not as a judge unto condemnation but as a judge unto perfection [Music] amen jesus christ did not come amongst his bride as a judge to condemn her and to cast her away and find every fault and ex use every fault in her as an excuse to put her away he came to unite with her not to put her away he came to be one with her amen not to cast her away but he came as judged with the full measure of the word so that he can begin to judge by the word amen to make his bride perfect in a rapture condition by the word that's been released in this day so the greatest thing that ever happened to the bride of jesus christ is that he come among her as a judge it is his mercy it is his grace it is his love to his bride everybody's so afraid of the judge but if the judge is your husband you're not afraid of the judge there's nothing to fear amen if the if if your husband is the judge then you don't fear the judge amen praise god and if your husband is the judge you should not fear accidentally falling into a transgression and getting arrested by the cops and taking the court and casting the prison your husband is there to make sure that you're going the right way because he's the judge he knows the law and he's there to help you stay out of trouble [Applause] amen so we say judge and people begin to lock up but i don't think this bride should lock up when we say judge or judgment i think the bride should open up and say oh god thank you amen that there's somebody here that knows the right way there's somebody among us that knows the absolute right correct way and there's somebody here that can reveal it amen and give us a chance to line to that right way so if he had stayed as mediator if he had stayed as high priest it would show us that part of the word was yet un unrevealed or unlocked and we would be waiting for the day that the rest of the world would open but when he moved from high priest to to judge it showed that there's nothing left unrevealed or unavailable to the elect of god but now everything is available to god's children that's why i say when you see that sign that cloud that's the greatest thing that has ever happened to the bride of jesus christ let's turn together to first peter chapter 4. first peter chapter 4 and i'm going to begin reading verse 17. for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and sinner appear now you can look at that scripture and tremble or you can look at that scripture and rejoice because judgment begins at the house of god and if i'm in the house of god if the sin are scarcely be saved the ones that are in the house of god it shows that only the judgment and the presence of the judge will keep us amen from the deception that's in the world that'll keep us from the corruption that's in the world we need judgment to begin at the house of god we need the presence of the judge amen to line us up to the word the deception is so great amen the perversion is so terrible that we have to have the white wig one among us or we won't make it if the righteous scarcely are saved what about the sinners and the rest of the world hey listen friends we're barely going to make it and we're only going to make it because the judge is present it's the only option we have it's the only way is the one who is the word the one who wrote the word the one who restored the word the one who reveals the word is present in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks to keep the bride lying to the word it is our only hope it it's it's a blessing to us it's mercy to us it's his grace it's his love his love is to judge us daily his love is to judge us by the word judges by the message judges by the preaching of the message judges by the confidence of a friend as iron sharpened iron it's like is his love to us to judge us because of the righteous barely are saved how would we make it without the presence of the judge and so wicked and deceptive a day brother bam says in the message indictment he said i want to kind of use it more like if it was like a room of courtroom and after all the pulpit in the church is a courtroom the bible said it's a judgment seat that it must begin at the house of the lord and this is like the throne he's talking about the pulpit this is like the throne and the jury and the witnesses and so forth so brother man preaching indictment he begins to set up the church as a courtroom and so every sunday and wednesday court is in session [Music] the judge's presence he's here to pass judgment brother bam says in the message perfect strength by perfect weakness he said there's a little there's little things that we do and that's what we want to come to church for is to find out where our faults is listen that's many times the reason people leave a church and go find another one or that's why the world begins to become fun and entertaining is because people don't want to hear their faults that's why the the church is the church nominal i mean has become so passive and so afraid to call out sin because the people don't want to hear their faults but for me i say god help me because i can't help myself see that's what we come to church was to find out our faults is and the things that we might better ourselves by if we come to church for any other any other objective than this i'm afraid we won't get too much out of coming to church we must come to find our weaknesses find our bad places and and now see how little we are and put our trust in somebody that's strong amen it's so good when the judge will come to the throne to the judgment seat and begin to judge by the word and the word begins to expose areas in our life where we have bad attitudes where we have selfishness we have wrong motives where we have we have the wrong desire the wrong understanding amen the wrong relationship with people or whatever we're acting in the wrong way as a husband as a wife as a mother as a father as a believer and begin to expose secret sin and secret thoughts and the judges begins to do that amen we can walk away and say you know there's always condemning and always condemning and always condemning and then you could walk away feeling condemned or you can walk away feeling liberated and said there's somebody here there's a man here that can turn on the light amen there's somebody here that can show me i've had a wrong attitude i've had a wrong spirit i've had i've been influenced by the wrong thought or the wrong channel amen and now i'm aware of it and thank god i'm aware of it what if i wasn't made aware of it what if i continued down with the wrong spiritual influence with the wrong thought with the wrong attitude amen with bitterness locked in my heart amen what if i was going contrary to the word and there was nobody to show me the way there was nobody present that could show me what the word said what if the judge wasn't here that's why he was on that's why he was back there doing the mediatorial work because there were so many things that were locked away and hidden from the children of god out of the word of god but this day he's here to open the book and show them all to us see the message didn't come to give us intellectual understanding the message didn't come just to give us something intellectually tantalizing to speak about but the message came to bring us into the perfect image of the bride of jesus christ that's why this message came it came to give us rapturing faith to put us in the right condition it came to put us in our position but be in the right condition for that position and that's why the life of the prophet was so exposed to us because amen that life became uh an exposure of god working with an elect seed amen and we see him coming to maturity and we see god dealing with him and we see god judging him and exposing his sin to him remember when he went to pray for the little baby amen and he had already worked this uh a little plan out where he would deceive the attorney and have his wife tell the attorney that he's outside and and he pulls it off and he goes to pray for a little a baby that his father brought her to be prayed for brought the child to be prayed for and he goes to the hotel and before he lays hands on the child the lord speaks to him and says how can you lay hands and pray for that child when you lied when you lied now brother branham stopped immediately and he tells the man i'm sorry i can't pray for your baby there's something i've got to make right and he goes to the attorney makes it right he makes it right with his wife and he goes out and he prays all day to god and repentance to make that thing right and then when he makes it right and he comes back and he prays for the baby god heals the baby listen that wasn't god's hatred and contempt for brother branham that exposed his sin to him that was god's love for him that was god keeping him in the right channel keeping him in the right line not allowing amen a son of god to go off into the weeds and create havoc and destruction and confusion that was god's love [Music] and we thank god for it when brother benham comes to the message standing in the gap where he you know he you know he wanted to go up near alaska and go up and be a guide and all of these things and god stopped him and corrected him and chastened him and i say thank god amen that was god's love to the man it wasn't god's hatred it wasn't god's contempt it wasn't god's anger it wasn't god's wrath amen it was the love of god amen there was a there was a judge present that could tell him you're going the wrong way and if you do this this is where your life will wind up and that was the love of god and the prophet of god was thankful for that let's go together the first first corinthians let's turn together to first corinthians chapter 11. first corinthians chapter 11. first corinthians chapter 11 verse 31 if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged i would say that's the preferred method for how many of you that's the preferred method when you judge yourself read the word god opens them to you say i'm wrong make it right praise god but then verse 32 but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world when god when we fail to judge ourselves he'll judge us but when he judges and chastens us spanks us he doesn't do it because he's angry with us because he doesn't like us because he wants us to feel condemned and he wants us to feel punished he does it so that we will not be condemned with the world it is his grace that causes him to judge it is his love that brings judgment it is his great love for the elect it is as overwhelming love and compassion that causes him to judge sin when he finds it in his elect he must do it to save us he must do it for us to save us from ourselves amen he must do it to save us from being condemned with the world amen in his love he will expose our sin to us he will judge us and chasten us amen so that we won't be lost with the world so when brother branham says judgment be must begin at the house of god amen that's not a that's not a a a terrorizing thing where we're afraid to come to church and i and if the and if the word is being preached in such a way that it is hammered in and forced conformity and and making you feel condemned and cast away and no good amen that's not the nature of god that's not what he comes even when god says something hard he says it hard but it's in love amen it's not for condemnation it's not amen to it's not you know to punish you with words god is not punishing you with words amen god is using the necessary words to open your eyes to your condition amen so that you'll repent so you won't be lost with the world he can say it's soft he can say it hard amen however he has to say it amen as long as he gets the point across the whole purpose is love amen that's why amen if it's brought outside of love it doesn't carry the right nature amen even when we even when we chastise our children amen it's because of our great love for them that we chasten them it should never be done because we're mad at them and we can't stand them and we want to get make them suffer a little bit if chastisement is ever performed that way it's not in the nature of god that's why that kind of chastisement is always dangerous and always harmful to a child but the chastisement that is done in love no matter how firm it must be applied and no matter how painful it is to the recipient but when it's done in love it never brings damage amen to the heart of the one who is chastised it always brings freedom from their sin and brings them back into a condition where they can love more willingly that's the purpose of proper chastisement god has chastised men we as parents must have chastisement but it must be in line with god's chastisement our judgment for our children and our and our chastening for our children must be right in line with the way god does it if not we're doing it wrong so god's purpose is love god's motivation is love god's uh the force behind his judgment to his elect his force behind his chastening is love so that we won't be lost he won't lose a one so valuable and so precious to us to him is us that he won't allow us to go the wrong way sometimes chastening is painful judgment is harsh sometimes it hurts but in the end it always brings to peaceable fruits of repentance and brings us back into a closer fellowship with god that's always the purpose now when we look at i want to look at this scripture here jeremiah 17 9 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it i put this scripture here because it was i was meditating on this and thinking this is the truth this is true about my heart and this is true about your heart and if you if you don't recognize this scripture as true you're falling in the worst trap of self-deception there is we must all recognize that this is the truth the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it there's so many times friends that we cannot accurately discern ourselves because we're deceived by our own human emotions by our own carnal heart and we think we've got the right motives we think listen when brother branham was going to go up on the alaskan highway up in northern british columbia amen he made religious excuses for going and he was going up there because he was a prophet of god and prophets of god they don't mingle with the people they don't do all this they go out in the wilderness and god gives a message they stomp out and they deliver their message and they go back and and all of a sudden he was deceiving himself it was his own wicked heart coming up with that plan and in the plan he was using scriptural types he was using he was using the bible he was using religious notions to justify his own actions listen you're not even safe amen if you have the bible you're not even safe from this kind of self-deception if you're holding a bible in your hand or reading in the bible reading the message but you're still not safe from self-deception because a man's heart is is desperately wicked that's why to have the white wig one among us is the greatest privilege we could ever have to have a judge that knows that heart and knows the word and can reveal the word and bring the solution to the problem and expose what's going on and bring the word upon the subject that's the greatest thing that we could experience we don't know how blessed we are and how thankful we are that there's the righteous judge of all heaven and earth the supreme judge is here amen the white wigged one is here the book has been opened the word is present and there's a loving god who wants to marry you amen but marrying you he's got to keep you in the right condition so that he can stay married to you to take you out of here and he will keep you right at all costs what a privilege to have the judge in our midst how we should thank god for judgment judgment's not scary judgment's beautiful have you ever seen a child so loved of his parents they never judged it they never spanked the child they never chastened it not once the bible says that that parent does not love that child that's what the bible says withholding spanking withholding chastisement is not an act of love it's an act of hate god does not withhold chastisement from his elect he doesn't because it's love have you ever been in the grocery store and seen a child who has never received chastisement that parent doesn't love that child because by the time that 45 minute one hour whatever shopping trip is done everybody else in that store hates that child is that the truth you've been in a restaurant amen mom and dad come in two three little children amen and mom and dad are consumed in their social media or whatever what they're watching one's got a phone this way one's got a phone the other way and the children are climbing over the table and knocking the salt shaker off and then knocking stuff in the floor and up on the table and making a mess of everything the waitress is at her wit's end mom and dad aren't doing anything about it everybody in the restaurant hates that child i've whispered to my wife many times i said do you think a public display of proper chastisement would be appropriate right now because i would help i would offer my services i wonder if i just made a suggestion to the mom do you think could i demonstrate but that's not love that's not love because that child will never that child will never have the right outlook on life have self-discipline have the ability to manage its own emotions and its own passions it'll never it'll never be in the right position because it didn't have parents who loved it correctly and would apply the word properly and the nature of god to keep that child growing healthy being established to be secured to have boundaries to know that it's loved god won't do that to you and i the heart is desperately wicked that's why we must train our children that's why god trains us that's why the judge is present to judge us the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it verse 10 i the lord search the hearts i try the reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings a man's heart is desperately wicked who can know it i the lord know it i the lord will search it i the lord will prove it out first chronicles 28 9 david's speaking to his son solomon he says and thou solomon my son know thou the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind for the lord searcheth all hearts and understandeth all imaginations of the thoughts you cannot discern your own heart your own heart will deceive you you need the lord who searches all hearts to search out your heart and show you where you're wrong we have to have and we have to have the one who can discern the hearts amen to expose our wrongs to us so that we can make them right because if not we'll continue to walk in self-deception never knowing we're deceived never knowing we're off the word and will continue walking that way to be lost with the world if it wasn't for a god who searches the hearts and has a word that's open that he can reveal in this day to snap us out of that condition and now i say thank god for the white wig thank god for the judge in our midst may he always be free to judge us may he always be free to express his love to us through his judgment amen may may this place always be a house of judgment amen may this pulpit always be the throne of judgment may he be free to speak amen to deliver his word and to judge us to straighten us to chasten us to make us line up to his word so that we can be what he's called us to be in this generation the judge came to make sure we can go the judge came it was the only way for us it was the only hope the judge came to make sure we can go can you imagine can you imagine a woman being married to the judge and she's the worst law breaker in town she's the embezzler she's the drug dealer she's the this and that but she's married to a judge amen how how contrary to his nature how wrong that would be amen but how so to say i'm the bride of jesus christ i'm married to the judge but i live absolutely contrary to his laws that i transgress his laws and i and i walk contrary to obedience to his law it's just as pathetic it's just as sad it's just as wrong as having the worst criminal in the city married to the judge there's something wrong the judge should be taking care of that the judge should be keeping it straight the judge should be keeping the law in his own house and to say that the white wig one is here amen that the judge is here he's present in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and i'm the bride and i can do whatever i want and the judge will cover for it it's wrong it's wrong in every way it doesn't match anything the nature of god amen but she the bride should be submitted to the judge and if he's the judge she should be the keeper of his word amen and it should be a pleasure to her i found that in the elect of god the problem is not keeping the word they love the word the problem is exposing the hidden sin the wrong motive that's deep inside the the bad attitude and the bitterness that stays locked in it's not that the children of god don't want to obey the word of god when they see it amen they make great sacrifices for the word of god the problem is when they're in their own self-deception and they've got bitterness and they don't know it and they're harboring a bad attitude and they don't see it amen and they're going the wrong way spiritually and they don't know it amen that's that's pitiful that's sad remember but what's worse is when god and his mercy and grace will come and lay it out and expose it at a seat of judgment amen and we would refuse to obey what god has given and when god exposes us we would walk away angry walk away mad we'd walk away upset at being exposed can you imagine again with me the judge's wife and he sees her transgressing the law but he never says anything to her and never makes it right or if she tells him he would say honey now listen you can't do that because there's a law there's an ordinance in this town such and such and such and you're not allowed to do that you're going to stop that and she says what right do you have to tell me what to do i'll do whatever i want and continue doing something's wrong and we as the bride of jesus christ can't live that way amen we have to say god expose my sin to me and when god exposes it it doesn't matter how much it hurts or how much it rakes against our personality how much how deep this thing's been embedded in our heart and we don't want to let it out we got to open up and say god judge me god get this out of my life god i recognize now that i have a wrong attitude but i can't free myself from it come and free me i recognize now that i'm holding bitterness in my heart but god i don't know how to root it out would you come and pluck it out of me amen how many how many times do you think that if we cry out to the lord and we recognize our air we recognize where the problem is and has been exposed and we lay ourselves before the lord and say lord this is my problem i'm bitter towards mom i'm bitter towards dad i'm bitter towards a brother and sister i see it now but i have no power to deliver myself come and deliver me what do you think the judge of all heaven and earth is going to do turn his back on you and walk away you've just exposed yourself back to him and laid yourself at his feet and say free me almighty god from this problem you didn't hide it you didn't tuck it back away amen at the end of service and put it back there and walk out and act like everything's fine but you laid yourself bare and said god i need your help i'm wrong in this area i'm wrong with this attitude i'm wrong with this idea i'm wrong with this form of conduct i'm wrong take it out of me almighty god amen amen amen god is so good to us let's go to revelation chapter 3. revelation chapter 3 verse 14 and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans right these things sayeth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works and thou are neither cold nor hot i would that thou were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knoweth not that thou art wretched and miserable poor and blind and naked what a pitiful condition brother brenham said to think that everything's fine when it's not to think to believe that we're rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing not knowing that we're wretched miserable poor blind and naked turn me to revelation 17 we're going to see the false church revelation 17. 17 verse 3 so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of the names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations of the filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth and i saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints with the blood of the martyrs and of jesus and when i saw her i wandered with great admiration so you can see this is the condition of this great church amen she she's full of the filthiness of her fornication she's a harlot amen she is drunk on the blood of the martyrs but if you go to chapter 18 verse 7 she gives this description of herself so we have the description that we have of john now she has her own description and verse 7 says how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow she has no idea of her own wretchedness she has no idea of what she looks like in the eyes of god she thinks she's fine and the false church doesn't think it's wicked the false church doesn't think it's a the denominations don't believe they're harlots they believe they're right with god they believe they're pure they believe they're they're doing right standing for right this is the condition and god sees them they see themselves in a different condition amen but god has brought his word in this day to expose the condition so that there can be a repentance so that we don't have to remain in these conditions amen nobody on this earth has to remain in that condition because the word has come to free us from those conditions let's go back to revelation chapter 3. revelation chapter 3 verse 18. jesus in the laodicean church he says i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i salv that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten what's the sign of his love rebuke and chasten him as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent amen there should be a zeal in the bride in the end time to repent but the describes this as an end time condition a zeal to repent when we recognize that we're wrong amen and recognize that as many as he loves he rebukes and chastens that's a sign of his love that makes you an object of his affection that makes you the recipient of his desire is that when he finds wrong he'll rebuke and chasten he will judge and chasten so that we won't be lost with the world it is god's special care of his elect it's god's tender love for his elect that that the world may get away with everything you may see other believers seemingly they get away with living in compromise they get away with doing things that that you can't do and all of a sudden it feels like you're under the critical eye of jehovah that every time you take one half step he comes down heavy with a rod and stops you and you can be you can become bitter over this and you become resentful that god won't let me do anything i do this much and god comes down that hard they're over here living it up and living in compromise and doing all these things and seemingly nothing's happening to them and you don't realize his love is being expressed more to you ten to them it shows that you're the apple of his eye that he's watching over you that you can't have a wrong thought without him correcting it you can't come to church without having got a little bit a little bit uh uh judgmental or critical that god won't call it over the pulpit and you're saying i just it was one sentence it was five minutes one in the world is this why can't i get away with anything amen that's god's love for you and i it's an expression of how closely he's watching over his elect and how interested he is in our lives and how much he's going to keep us lying to his word because everything is dependent on us lining to this word because this will be the bride amen that restores all that was lost this will be the dispensation that goes back to being the original bride and won't fall like he fell why she's predestinated not to so his predestination forced him to come himself and keep his bride lined up he couldn't leave it to you and i the heart is deceitfully wicked who can know it we don't know our own condition we can't see ourselves we don't know how we look before the lord so in this day because he's prophesied that he will have a bride without sparta wrinkle he is prophesied amen that he'll have a a bride a wife at this time that won't fall like he fell it forced him to come as the white wig one to make sure you and i won't fall to make sure that we will be spot-free and wrinkle-free by the washing of the water of the word he came as the white wig one so that he can keep his word and his promise to you and i he's here service after service tape after tape book after book in your prayer time and then with your friend he's here to line us up to line us up to line us up don't grow weary in the lord rebuking don't get tired of his chastening don't get resentful of him exposing our sin just say praise be to god there's a one here that can keep me there's one here that can save me there's one here that can purify me and perfect don't get discouraged when every time you make a misstep the rod comes down don't that's his love don't get weary amen when every wrong thought gets exposed back to you over the pulpit don't go tired of that receive it as god's token of love receive it as his great love his tremendous affection we thought to be the apple of his eye would make us a spoiled trophy wife that's sometimes the mental picture we get where his bride the apple of his eye the treasure of his heart as somehow we're a spoiled rich trophy wife that he gives luxury cars to in vacations and she goes to the spa and gets manicures and all of this we think somehow that's the picture of what it means to be the bride that's not love amen that that's not true love amen to be the bride amen is to be lined up to the word and become a perfect reflection of the bridegroom that's what it means to be the bride if he suffered we must also suffer if he fully submitted we must also fully submit and he's not leaving it to us he's come himself he's come as the white wigged one to make sure that what he promised in this age will come to pass he's here to make sure that we'll be sprinkled with the word spotless white and wrinkle-free he's here to make sure that this one won't fall like evolve because he's here to say uh-uh we're not going that way thank god the judge is in her midst in the day of the lord thank god there's a judge that's present that loves us and will judge us in chasing us let's turn together to psalms 23. psalms 23 we'll read verse 1 the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me the rod is used for correction the staff is used for guidance and supports thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anoint as my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever everybody wants to be in verse 5 and 6. we all want to be in verse 5 and 6. but we'll never make it to verse 5 and 6 without verse 4. if there's not a shepherd with a rod and a staff to keep us lined out to keep us on the path and the correctness one is wrong we'll never make it to five and six so thank god for verse four thank god for a loving shepherd thank god for the supreme judge of all heavens and earth who's in the midst of his bride and won't let her go astray man god bless you let's all stand musicians if you can come please brother ben as well let's just bow our heads and thank the lord dear lord jesus we thank you father for your word god it is so rich it is so pure it is so perfect lord god i don't know how we can thank you enough for the things that you've done in this day for the eyesight you've given us through your eyes have god we could never see on our own but you gave us eyes to see we can never hear alone but you gave us ears to hear lord you predestinated it you made it happen god our hearts are desperately wicked lord god our human nature lord the effect of hybridization in our lives it is so detrimental to us it's so deadly to us god will never make it on our own we'll never make it without you father so god we invite you to come lord and clean out our hearts lord purify us with your fire show us lord where we're wrong lord reveal to us lord make us clean lord show us what you would have us to do make us lord to live the right way before you because without your help with no hope for us lord without you judging us there's no hope we need you we love you we yield ourselves to you we serve you lord and we ask lord that you would have your way in us in every way as we surrender to you come in us lord and live your life through us be the judge in our midst we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen there was one other scripture that i want to read and i'll just recite it to you yeah i'll just recite it to you it's a psalm oh psalm 139 psalm 139 23 says search me o god and know my heart this is david crying out to the lord this is his prayer he's not running away from the presence of the lord he's not hiding from the judgments of god but in prayer he says search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting i say can we make david's prayer our prayer can we say lord search my heart lord search my heart try me know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting david had so much confidence in god he knew god would not find something in him that would cause him to be destroyed cast away thrown to the side rejected never to be redeemed again he knew he was god's he knew he belonged to god he knew god called him and if you and i know that we are his that we are the apple of his eye that we're his delight that we're his counterpart on the earth if we know that we are sons and daughters of god then we should not be afraid of god searching our hearts we shouldn't be afraid of god going to the deep recesses of our heart and rooting out things that have been laying there since we were a child complexes and fears and things we shouldn't be afraid we should throw open the doors remember brother ben preached doors and doors amen we only let him in so far but we don't open the inner chamber we don't open the doors to the inside but he says throw open the doors the doors within the doors and the doors and the doors and the doors until we say god i'm open search my heart oh god and know me amen see if there's any wicked way in me know my thoughts and lead me in the way that's everlasting let's throw open the doors knowing we won't be rejected no matter what he finds he won't throw you away [Music] no matter how horrible it is no matter how grieving it is no matter how much it hurts he'll never cast you away and throw you away because of what he finds he already knows it's there he just needs you to submit and yield so that he can do the heart surgery to remove it he knows it's there he knows what happened to you when you were five he knows what you went through as a teenager he knows the sins he knows the complexes he knows the neglect the abandonment he knows it all he knows the abuse he knows it all he knows it's there but he's a gentleman he doesn't pry open doors amen he's waiting for somebody to throw the door open and say god i'm in need of heart surgery i'm in need of a deep heart surgery there's something holding me back there's something keeping me from being all that i know you've called me to be i go so far and fall back i stumble i can't seem to break free god search my heart know my thoughts o god see if there's any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting friends it's our only hope a psychiatrist is useless he'll never get down to it god knows it's there he knows how to remove it he knows that his scalpel is sharp and it cuts deep but it's precise he'll go right to it and cut it out and bring us freedom don't be afraid of the ultimate heart surgery but lay yourself on his table and say god i'm here cut me free from complex cut me free from fear cut me free from insecurities cut me free from rejection complexes cut me free from fear of mankind cut me free of all of these things and make me whole amen oh just throw the doors open and then throw the next door open in the next door and go till you can't find any more doors let's take them off the hinges and let there be no more barrier between us and the white wig one who
