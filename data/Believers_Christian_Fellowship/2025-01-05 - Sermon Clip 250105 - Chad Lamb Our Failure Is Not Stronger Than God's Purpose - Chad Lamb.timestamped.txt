[0:00] why didn't he stop the Fall In the
[0:02] Garden of Eden he could stop
[0:03] anything he stopped all kinds of people
[0:06] from making mistakes he has put the
[0:08] brakes on he's changed circumstances he
[0:10] stopped why didn't he stop the Fall In
[0:11] the Garden of Eden Hey listen I don't
[0:13] know about you but I'm suffering because
[0:15] of that
[0:16] decision the whole world is suffering
[0:18] every human that's ever been on this
[0:20] Earth is suffering because of what
[0:21] happened in the Garden of Eden we're
[0:23] under a curse we're burned under a curse
[0:24] we live all of our lives in a cursed
[0:27] body amen all because of something that
[0:29] happened why didn't he stop it the only
[0:31] reason I know according to what the
[0:33] prophet said is that fall worked
[0:35] together for his
[0:37] purpose so God allowed it amen why did
[0:41] Abraham fail his wife in such a way that
[0:43] he would go down to Gar and lie and sell
[0:45] out his wife and listen brother Abraham
[0:49] is the chosen vessel of God Amen he is
[0:52] the going to be the father of Faith the
[0:54] father of Nations from his loin are is
[0:57] going to come the seed line amen all of
[0:59] this stuff is going on in Abraham after
[1:02] meeting God after a body change after
[1:04] all of these things he goes down to
[1:08] guar and he fails his
[1:11] wife he fails God CU he shouldn't have
[1:14] been down there anyways should have
[1:16] stayed in the land that what the prophet
[1:18] tells
[1:20] us and and all of these things transpire
[1:24] and then
[1:25] God listen God comes on the scene
[1:30] God comes on the scene to aimc and says'
[1:32] don't you know you're about to take a a
[1:34] man's wife he said Lord you know the
[1:35] Integrity of my heart I
[1:37] didn't why didn't God stop Abraham from
[1:40] going to
[1:41] Gar if he could show up and talk to a
[1:44] heathen King couldn't he have talked to
[1:46] Abraham how many times did he talk to
[1:48] Abraham if he told Abraham don't go to
[1:51] Gar I don't believe Abraham would have
[1:55] went so why did it happen this way why
[2:00] didn't he stop him from making a mistake
[2:02] why didn't he stop him from hurting
[2:03] Sarah's feelings why didn't he stop from
[2:05] bringing trouble to the whole nation of
[2:06] gar the whole nation was under a curse
[2:08] because of this thing because God had
[2:09] already stopped the wounds of animal and
[2:11] servant and everybody the whole nation
[2:15] was troubled because of Abraham's
[2:16] decision Sarah was troubled because of
[2:18] Abraham decision the whole promise of
[2:20] God looked like it was in Jeopardy
[2:21] because of the decision of Abraham
[2:24] aiman's life was in Jeopardy because of
[2:26] the decision of Abraham why didn't God
[2:27] stop Abraham from making the decision
[2:33] but he come to a heathen King and he
[2:36] said listen this whole thing's bad don't
[2:37] do
[2:38] it
[2:40] right all I can say friends is it must
[2:42] have served God's
[2:44] purpose and you realize we stand here
[2:47] and I don't know all that God was
[2:48] accomplishing and all that was happening
[2:50] amen it may take us the entire eternity
[2:52] to understand it but one thing I know
[2:54] for sure is that's the only scripture
[2:56] brother Brenham has to show that they
[2:57] had a body change
[3:00] right cuz brother Brenham comes to that
[3:03] scripture and says see that King could
[3:05] have any Fair young virgin he wants but
[3:06] he wants Grandma Sarah coming down
[3:08] because God had just changed their
[3:10] bodies in that meeting in Genesis 18 and
[3:13] now they come down to Guerrera that is
[3:15] reading between the lines that's what
[3:17] God placed so that a prophet could pick
[3:19] it up 4,000 or some years later and say
[3:22] see there was a body change Abraham
[3:24] probably never knew why God allowed that
[3:27] mistake in his life but we're looking
[3:28] back saying I'm so glad he went to Gar
[3:31] I'm so thankful that he went down there
[3:33] and all that transpired so I can see
[3:36] what God has in store for
[3:41] me was it a mistake yes was it costly
[3:44] yes did people suffer yes
