[0:00] When the Lord Jesus was on earth, he was
[0:03] very particular
[0:05] about even in the Old Testament in
[0:09] Exodus 22, he says, "Ye shall not
[0:12] afflict any widow or fatherless child if
[0:16] thou afflict them in any wise." Watch
[0:18] what? Watch how God was so protective of
[0:22] a child that didn't have a father's
[0:26] protection.
[0:28] Not just not just a child but a widow.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; He would say, "Thou shalt not afflict
[0:34] any widow or fatherless child. If thou
[0:38] afflict them in any wise, and they shall
[0:41] cry out unto me, look, cry at all."
[0:47] &gt;&gt; Even
[0:48] &gt;&gt; God is so particular. He says, "If they
[0:51] say the least little thing,"
[0:53] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; He says, "I will surely hear their cry,
[1:01] &gt;&gt; AND MY [screaming] WRATH
[1:03] &gt;&gt; SHALL WAX HOT,
[1:06] &gt;&gt; AND I WILL KILL YOU WITH THE SWORD."
[1:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; GOD'S [screaming] TALKING TO HIS ELECT
[1:11] RIGHT HERE,
[1:13] &gt;&gt; HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE.
[1:16] AND HE SAYS, "IF YOU DO, IF YOU TOUCH A
[1:19] HAIR ON THEIR HEAD,
[1:21] &gt;&gt; MY WRATH
[1:23] &gt;&gt; IS COMING DOWN."
[1:26] &gt;&gt; He says, "AND YOUR WIVES SHALL BE WIDOWS
[1:30] AND YOUR CHILDREN FATHERLESS.
[1:34] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET ME
[1:37] see you lay hands."
[1:39] &gt;&gt; All right. Yeah.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; Be-c because God listen, God knows that
[1:44] if there's a child that don't have a
[1:46] daddy,
[1:47] &gt;&gt; there's going to be lacking in that
[1:48] child.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; That it's not that child's fault.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; AND GOD REALIZES THAT.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; AND SO GOD TELLS HIS PEOPLE, THOSE
[1:58] PEOPLE GET EXTRA SPECIAL CARE
[2:03] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD KNOWS THAT THERE'S GOING TO
[2:05] BE VOIDS IN THOSE PEOPLE'S LIVES.
[2:09] That's not their fault.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's good.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; Look, he says this even in the New
[2:21] Testament.
[2:24] He says pure religion and undefiled
[2:27] before God is the father is this to
[2:30] visit the fatherless and the widows and
[2:34] their affliction and to keep himself
[2:37] unspotted
[2:39] from the world. That visit is just not
[2:42] go see him every once in a while, but it
[2:44] actually means to look after
[2:48] &gt;&gt; to to look upon in order to help or
[2:50] benefit, to look after, to care for,
[2:52] provide for.
[2:55] So God is telling us that if there if
[2:58] there's a child that's lacking
[3:01] fatherhood
[3:02] &gt;&gt; and the dad is not there, we as the
[3:05] people of God
[3:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:07] &gt;&gt; are called to fill that void. That's
[3:10] right.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; Because there's things that's going to
[3:18] be in that child that they're going to
[3:20] deal with that your children won't deal
[3:23] with.
