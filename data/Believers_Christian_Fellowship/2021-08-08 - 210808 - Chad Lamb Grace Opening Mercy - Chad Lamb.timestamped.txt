[9:08] oh father we love you
[9:11] lord jesus we can't express enough how
[9:14] much we love you lord
[9:16] we sing with words and we sing with a
[9:18] full expression but lord it can't even
[9:20] compare to the love that's in our heart
[9:22] oh god
[9:24] just overflowing at your goodness your
[9:26] mercy your grace
[9:28] god the abundant blessings of which you
[9:30] poured upon us your people lord we're so

[9:34] it's our pleasure lord to sing of your
[9:36] goodness
[9:38] the sing of your mercies and your grace
[9:40] and your magnificence lord that you'd be
[9:42] exalted lord
[9:44] in us
[9:46] god we just pray lord that as we come to
[9:48] the
[9:49] time now when we take this book lord and
[9:51] open it we're asking you to break the
[9:53] bread of life
[9:54] we're asking you to speak to us lord god
[9:56] you would share your mind with us and
[9:58] show us what it is you want for this
[9:59] hour what manifestation you're looking
[10:02] for and what it is you want us to be
[10:04] expressing lord as your children and god
[10:07] may you get preeminence among us lord
[10:09] and have your way
[10:10] live through each life lord as we
[10:12] surrender and lay ourselves bear may you
[10:15] pick us up and begin to use us for your
[10:17] purposes
[10:18] we ask that you would take every part of
[10:20] the service and every word that's spoken
[10:22] lord may it be pleasing to you
[10:24] speak the truth lord we pray in jesus
[10:26] christ's name
[10:28] amen
[10:30] man god bless you if you want to take
[10:32] your bibles while we're standing and
[10:33] turn to galatians chapter six
[10:36] this will say how much i enjoyed the
[10:38] special and i
[10:39] appreciate the lives that are behind the
[10:41] singing amen
[10:43] god has certainly been good to us
[10:46] and i appreciate
[10:48] the light that shines through god's
[10:50] people
[10:52] it's a bright light it's getting
[10:53] brighter
[10:54] this whole message it is all wrapped up
[10:58] in christ in you the hope of glory
[11:01] this whole message the whole
[11:02] understanding of the message comes down
[11:05] to god expressing himself in fullness in
[11:08] bride form at the end time that's what
[11:11] he wants when you see the lives shining
[11:14] through youth and to parents and through
[11:16] everyone then you recognize this is what
[11:18] god's goal is is to live his life in
[11:21] human flesh in redeemed human flesh in
[11:24] your flesh and in my flesh
[11:27] may we just yield ourselves more to that
[11:29] well i appreciate the youth for that it
[11:31] was wonderful
[11:33] amen also i'd just like to make an
[11:35] announcement before we read the
[11:36] scripture i just found out that aaron
[11:38] alyssa bonanno had a baby girl and so we
[11:41] didn't have time to get a picture up but
[11:43] she was born july 30th her name is
[11:46] gianna marie she's six pounds eight
[11:48] ounces and 19 and a quarter inches long
[11:51] so thank god oh we did have time to get
[11:53] a picture
[11:54] amen well praise the lord and god bless
[11:56] them and we're thankful for that god is
[11:59] certainly good amen
[12:01] god is always abundant in his blessings
[12:05] praise the lord
[12:06] let's read galatians chapter 6
[12:09] and verse 9
[12:15] says and let us not be weary in well
[12:17] doing for in due season we shall reap if
[12:20] we faint not
[12:21] as we have therefore opportunity let us
[12:23] do good unto all men especially unto
[12:26] them who are of the household of faith i
[12:29] mean may the lord ask to add his
[12:30] blessing to the reading of the word as
[12:32] you're seated
[12:33] amen this is
[12:36] an unusual opening scripture but i hope
[12:37] by the end of the service it'll make
[12:39] sense to you
[12:40] especially where it says as we have
[12:42] therefore opportunity let us do good
[12:44] unto all men especially unto them who
[12:46] are of the household
[12:47] of faith
[12:49] amen
[12:51] i also before we get uh going here in
[12:53] the word i want to remind everybody that
[12:55] my family and i will be leaving for
[12:56] vacation
[12:57] on friday this coming friday
[13:00] the 13th we'll we'll miss four services
[13:02] so please pray for us while we're gone
[13:04] amen but i've got the ministry schedule
[13:06] all worked out so i'll go ahead and let
[13:08] you know what that is this wednesday
[13:10] it'll still be i'll still be here i
[13:12] still plan on preaching lord willing
[13:14] wednesday
[13:15] and then we'll leave early in the
[13:16] morning on friday but then the first
[13:18] sunday that we're gone brother kyle
[13:20] weikert will be ministering for us and
[13:22] then that wednesday will be brother ron
[13:24] garvin
[13:25] and then i've asked brother john
[13:26] nakadema to take two i've asked him to
[13:28] take two in a row on sunday and
[13:31] wednesday he was really gracious last
[13:33] time that he had service to give it up
[13:35] so brother ben could finish
[13:36] the second part of what he was preaching
[13:38] and so i've asked him just to take those
[13:40] two services so he'll be finishing that
[13:42] out whether jean kadema will on sunday
[13:43] and wednesday so pray for these brothers
[13:45] amen and pray that god will just inspire
[13:48] them and use them and come and pull on
[13:50] the gift and receive from the channel
[13:52] that god has for us and i appreciate
[13:55] having faithful brothers here that we
[13:56] can lean on when we're away and it makes
[13:58] it really nice for me
[14:00] personally that that they can just take
[14:02] care of that service and everything is
[14:04] stable at home
[14:06] we don't have visitors coming in and
[14:07] worrying about watching over them god
[14:09] has really really been good to us amen
[14:12] i'd like to
[14:14] for today i'd like to take for a subject
[14:16] like if i get a title i'd give the title
[14:18] grace opening mercy
[14:21] and so it's strange title i do some
[14:23] strange things sometimes but grace
[14:25] opening mercy and i just uh follow with
[14:28] me as we go but i'd like to lay a little
[14:30] foundation so if you turn with me to
[14:32] isaiah 53
[14:35] isaiah 53
[14:42] in verse 6.
[14:50] in isaiah 53 and 6
[14:54] it says
[14:55] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[14:58] have turned everyone to his own way and
[15:00] the lord hath laid on him the iniquity
[15:03] of us all
[15:05] brother ben said in the message israel
[15:06] in the church from 1953 he says in the
[15:08] garden of eden when man sinned
[15:11] first look at the nature of a sinner
[15:13] hiding but it should have been adam
[15:15] calling god it was adam hiding and god
[15:18] calling adam you see it
[15:20] that's the nature of a center hide run
[15:22] away get behind something but god
[15:24] calling oh my grace amazing grace god
[15:28] calling
[15:29] we read this scripture it says all we
[15:31] like sheep have gone astray we have
[15:33] turned everyone to his own way and and
[15:36] the lord has laid on him the iniquity of
[15:37] us all it is we who ran away
[15:40] and it's never been us calling out to
[15:42] god it was always god calling for us and
[15:44] we're the ones who ran away
[15:47] we're the ones who ran away and gone our
[15:49] own way but he's the one so faithful as
[15:51] a shepherd to come looking for us and
[15:53] calling when adam had gone his way amen
[15:56] and separated himself from god he ran
[15:58] and hid from god and he heard the voice
[16:00] of god
[16:01] in the evening come walking in the
[16:03] garden in the evening and he ran away
[16:06] but it was god who was pursuing pursuing
[16:08] adam it was not adam pursuing god
[16:12] and so brother bam said one place he
[16:13] says it's not we who are going after god
[16:16] it's god coming after us although it
[16:18] looks like we're coming after god amen
[16:20] it looks to us like we're seeking god
[16:23] but we didn't seek god the bible says
[16:24] you can't seek god amen it is god
[16:27] pulling you amen it is the tug from god
[16:30] that we're interpreting is our search
[16:32] for god no it's god calling us
[16:37] let's turn to the psalm psalm
[16:39] 14.
[16:41] i'm going to read quite a few scriptures
[16:43] today
[16:44] so keep your bibles handy and practice
[16:46] your flipping skills
[16:48] we're going to flip around in the bible
[16:49] but psalms 14
[16:53] and verse 2.
[16:58] the lord looked down from heaven upon
[17:00] the children of men to see if there were
[17:01] any that did understand and seek god
[17:05] they are all gone aside they are all
[17:07] together become filthy there is none
[17:10] that doeth good no not one
[17:14] praise god it's better just to come to
[17:15] terms with it right out of the chute
[17:16] from the very beginning and says you
[17:18] know what i we he said i seek
[17:21] the lord looked down from heaven upon
[17:23] the children of men to see if there were
[17:24] any that did understand and seek god
[17:27] he was looking for any and there was
[17:29] none they are all gone aside they are
[17:32] all together become filthy there is none
[17:34] that doeth good
[17:36] no not one
[17:37] let's go to romans chapter 3.
[17:47] romans chapter 3
[17:51] and verse 9 is where i'd like to begin
[18:00] what then are we better than they no in
[18:02] no wise for we have before proved both
[18:04] jew and gentile that they are all under
[18:07] sin
[18:07] as it is written there is none righteous
[18:10] no not one there is none that understand
[18:13] that there is none that seeketh after
[18:15] god did you catch that there is none
[18:17] that seeketh after god
[18:20] they are all gone out of the way they
[18:23] are all they are together become
[18:24] unprofitable there is none that doeth
[18:26] good no not one
[18:29] their throat is an open sepulchre with
[18:31] their tongues they have used deceit the
[18:33] poison of ass was under their lips whose
[18:36] mouth is full of cursing and bitterness
[18:38] their feet are swift to shed blood
[18:40] destruction and misery are in their way
[18:42] and the way of peace have they not known
[18:44] there is no fear of god before their
[18:46] eyes
[18:48] that's a pretty bad condition amen
[18:52] there is none that seek god no not one
[18:54] there is none that doeth good amen there
[18:57] is none so we never came to god amen
[19:01] with merit we never sought after god we
[19:04] would never decided to do good amen that
[19:07] was never uh it was never first a choice
[19:10] we made it was first a choice he made
[19:12] amen by the planting of a seed and then
[19:15] there was something there he could work
[19:16] on something he could draw and he would
[19:18] begin to draw us and it was not us
[19:20] seeking god it was god seeking us it was
[19:22] not us running after god it was god
[19:24] coming to us and pulling us to him
[19:27] and if that was if it wasn't that
[19:29] process there was absolutely no way that
[19:31] would become because remember adam
[19:34] wasn't looking for god adam amen was the
[19:36] original spoken word creation in this
[19:39] earth and when he fell he didn't go
[19:41] after god amen he ran away from god god
[19:44] had to come after him and that would
[19:45] forever be the pattern from that time on
[19:50] it was god coming after you and i
[19:54] let's turn to ephesians chapter 2.
[20:08] in june
[20:09] ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 and you hath
[20:12] he quickened who were dead in trespasses
[20:14] and sins
[20:15] so what condition were you in dead
[20:19] you were dead in trespasses and sin
[20:21] before he quickened you or made you
[20:24] alive you were spiritually dead dead in
[20:27] trespasses and sin you weren't seeking
[20:29] for god you weren't looking for him amen
[20:32] he was looking for you
[20:34] and you hath he quickened who were dead
[20:36] in trespasses and sins wherein in time
[20:38] past you walked according to the courts
[20:40] of this world according to the prince of
[20:42] the power of the air the spirit thou now
[20:44] worketh in the children of
[20:46] disobedience among whom also we all had
[20:49] our conversation in times past and the
[20:51] lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires
[20:53] of the flesh and of the mind and we're
[20:55] by nature children of wrath even as
[20:58] others
[21:00] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[21:03] great love wherewith he loved us
[21:05] even when we were dead and sins hath
[21:07] quickened us together with christ by
[21:09] grace ye are saved and hath raised us up
[21:12] together and made us sit together in
[21:14] heavenly places in christ jesus that in
[21:17] the ages to come he might show the
[21:19] exceeding riches of his grace and his
[21:21] kindness toward us through christ jesus
[21:24] for by grace are you saved through faith
[21:26] and that and that not of yourselves it
[21:29] is the gift of god not of works lest any
[21:32] man should boast
[21:34] so there was nothing that we did to save
[21:36] ourselves and it wasn't our desire to be
[21:39] saved that has us saved
[21:42] because we didn't seek after god we
[21:44] didn't desire to be saved god desired to
[21:47] save us he desired to redeem us he
[21:49] resided to bring us back to himself we
[21:51] were separated by sin but it was his
[21:53] desire to bring us back amen and so with
[21:56] that desire he quickened us when we were
[21:58] dead and trespasses in sin and he made
[22:01] us sit in heavenly places in christ
[22:03] jesus already because god had a purpose
[22:06] and god had a plan and he had a desire
[22:09] and god's desire trumped all of our
[22:12] desires
[22:13] because all of our desires were wicked
[22:15] amen before we were born again when we
[22:17] were born of natural flesh amen we were
[22:19] just given over to the lusts of the
[22:21] flesh we had natural desires carnal mind
[22:24] with carnal desires and carnal doesn't
[22:27] necessarily mean wicked carnal just
[22:29] means natural and you were born with
[22:30] carnal nature with carnal desires amen
[22:33] with the carnal lusts
[22:36] and there was no way in that condition
[22:38] that you could do good and that you
[22:40] could seek after god and that you could
[22:41] find god it was god who was going to
[22:43] have to find you amen and by
[22:45] predestination he knew who would and who
[22:47] would not and he knew who he was coming
[22:49] after and he knew how to find them amen
[22:52] and he knew that he would he would put
[22:54] inside of you amen by the predestination
[22:57] by election he would put inside of you a
[22:59] portion of himself a part of the word
[23:02] amen a portion of his an attribute of
[23:04] god and in that he knew that there was
[23:07] there was a power there that he could
[23:09] draw from he had taken a magnet and laid
[23:12] a magnet down inside of you and all he
[23:14] has to do is click on this magnet and
[23:16] get it near you and those two things
[23:18] would begin to pull together
[23:21] because it's the father drawing you
[23:24] not you running after the father
[23:30] brother ben says in the seat shall not
[23:32] be heir with the shock
[23:33] that's why the rapture the bride the
[23:35] wise virgin the called out the for
[23:37] ordained the elect while you businessmen
[23:40] wouldn't run your office like some
[23:41] people try to think that god runs his
[23:43] program haphazard
[23:45] god knew before the foundation of the
[23:46] world who would be saved and who would
[23:48] not be saved
[23:49] by predestination
[23:51] my foreknowledge he saw every member put
[23:54] every name on the lamb's book of life
[23:56] before the church ever began jesus come
[23:58] to seek and to save that which was on
[24:00] the book
[24:02] the bible says i scheme to seek and save
[24:03] that which was lost amen that which was
[24:06] lost had already been written in the
[24:07] book amen it was already found before it
[24:09] can be lost that was a possession that
[24:11] was lost amen it wasn't gaining a new
[24:13] possession if it's lost it was your
[24:15] possession that you lost it was already
[24:19] a possession of god a part of god a part
[24:21] of this word and it was already a name
[24:23] in the book amen part of that book
[24:26] what is the believer the words in the
[24:27] book amen you are part of that book
[24:33] and he came to seek and to save that
[24:34] which was on the book
[24:36] he bought the book of redemption it was
[24:38] lost and he redeemed us and all names
[24:40] was on the book was redeemed when he
[24:43] redeemed
[24:44] us let's go to john chapter 6.
[24:48] i'm just laying in a foundation these
[24:51] things are familiar to us but i want to
[24:52] rehearse them and and iron them out
[24:54] because they they mean something and all
[24:56] these things that we learn they all mean
[24:59] something to us
[25:00] we are fundamental principles of the
[25:02] message amen that give us the right
[25:04] perspective and the right vision on
[25:06] everything around us and without that
[25:08] fundamental perspective amen we begin to
[25:10] misunderstand our lives and the things
[25:13] that are going on around us and what god
[25:14] is doing
[25:16] in john chapter 6
[25:20] and verse
[25:23] 44.
[25:29] no man can come to me except the father
[25:32] which has sent me draw him
[25:34] and i will raise him up at the last day
[25:38] so
[25:39] this just reiterates what the prophet of
[25:41] god has told us what we've been talking
[25:42] about
[25:43] you can't come to god without god
[25:46] drawing you
[25:48] verse 45 it is written in the prophets
[25:51] and they shall they shall be all taught
[25:53] of god
[25:55] every man therefore that hath heard
[25:58] and hath learned of the father cometh
[26:00] unto me
[26:02] i love the past tense of this
[26:06] because
[26:07] if you
[26:08] he says everyone
[26:11] every one
[26:12] every man therefore that hath heard and
[26:15] hath learned to the father
[26:17] cometh unto me
[26:18] amen so god is drawing you and you're
[26:20] coming to the lord but you're those who
[26:23] are coming to the lord are those that
[26:24] have already been taught and already
[26:26] heard from the father
[26:29] when were they taught and when did they
[26:30] hear from the father maybe when he
[26:32] showed the attributes the plan of
[26:34] redemption and they shouted for joy and
[26:36] they clapped their hand and they sang
[26:38] and danced when they saw the plan of
[26:39] redemption their names being put in the
[26:42] book
[26:44] and so
[26:45] he's drawing
[26:47] those
[26:49] who have heard and have learned of the
[26:51] father
[26:52] that cometh unto me
[26:54] not that any man has seen the father
[26:56] save he which is of god
[26:58] he hath seen the father
[27:01] so the only one who has seen the father
[27:03] is he that is of god
[27:07] praise be to god
[27:10] so let's go to
[27:12] chapter or verse 6 60 down here drop
[27:14] down to verse 16.
[27:18] many therefore of his disciples when
[27:20] they had heard this said this is a hard
[27:22] saying who can hear it when jesus knew
[27:26] in himself that his disciples murmured
[27:28] at it he said unto them that this
[27:30] offends you
[27:31] what and if you shall see the son of man
[27:33] ascend up where he was before
[27:36] and it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[27:37] flesh prophet of nothing the words that
[27:40] i speak unto you they are spirit and
[27:41] they are life but there are some of you
[27:43] that believeth not for jesus knew from
[27:46] the beginning who they were that would
[27:48] believe not and who should betray him
[27:51] and he said therefore said i unto you
[27:53] that no man can come unto me except it
[27:56] were given unto him of my father
[27:59] from that time many of his disciples
[28:01] went back and walked no more with him
[28:04] so when jesus was preaching and jesus
[28:06] was calling and the multitudes were
[28:07] coming he already knew from the
[28:09] beginning who would believe and who
[28:12] didn't believe
[28:14] and he was still interacting with them
[28:16] and still allowing them to be near to
[28:17] him amen and god was not pushing away
[28:21] amen by by force or by rejection he was
[28:24] not pushing away those that were not
[28:26] already given to him who did not believe
[28:28] but the way he separated was by greater
[28:30] revelation of his word and as he began
[28:33] to reveal his word in a greater way it
[28:35] confounded the intellectual minds that
[28:37] it intellectually gravitated to this man
[28:40] they couldn't piece together what he
[28:41] said when he says you know what i wonder
[28:44] if you should see the son of man go up
[28:45] where he was before and then they're
[28:47] like what are you talking about before
[28:49] that he had said unless you eat my flesh
[28:51] and drink my blood you have no part in
[28:53] me what is he talking about he's just
[28:55] giving the word
[28:57] he's giving the word but he's not giving
[28:59] the intellectual explanation of the word
[29:00] he's just giving the word
[29:03] and there were those who he knew didn't
[29:05] believe so he brought he brought another
[29:08] revelation of the word in that further
[29:10] revelation of the word began to separate
[29:13] the unbelievers from the believers
[29:16] because they were make believers amen
[29:18] they thought that they were believers
[29:19] but when the stronger meat of revelation
[29:22] began to come out it didn't compute in
[29:24] their minds they could not correlate
[29:26] this with what they had read before
[29:31] where in the old testament do you see
[29:33] eat my flesh and drink my blood
[29:36] they didn't see it as a commandment they
[29:38] didn't understand it in the in the
[29:40] writings of moses they couldn't put
[29:43] their finger
[29:45] on it
[29:47] but yet it was every bit the truth
[29:50] god had laid it in shadows amen he had
[29:53] showed it in times it was laying there
[29:55] between the lines it was in the bible
[29:57] but they couldn't go to the commandment
[29:59] where messiah a menstrual actually
[30:01] divide up his body and you'll eat
[30:02] portions of it and drink his blood amen
[30:05] they couldn't go and read that they
[30:06] couldn't understand the spiritual
[30:08] application they couldn't even
[30:09] understand amen what the sacrifice was
[30:11] fully foreshadowing
[30:13] so when he come to bring a greater
[30:14] revelation of the word amen the only
[30:17] ones that could stay there the ones that
[30:19] have been taught of the father and hath
[30:21] heard of the father
[30:23] and even they didn't intellectually
[30:25] conceive what he was talking about there
[30:27] was no conception in their mind because
[30:29] he said well you go also and peter says
[30:31] where will we go thou alone have the
[30:33] words of eternal life and we know and
[30:34] are convinced that thou art the son of
[30:36] the living god
[30:38] what else are we going to do i don't
[30:40] know what you're talking about i can't
[30:42] explain it i can't find it in the bible
[30:46] right
[30:47] peter brother says was an illiterate
[30:49] fisherman amen peter was relying on what
[30:51] he had been taught in the synagogues
[30:53] what he had heard ministers say and
[30:55] these same ministers that had taught him
[30:57] amen and that taught him the scriptures
[31:00] and taught him the law of moses they had
[31:02] all rejected and walked away amen from
[31:04] jesus but here is one who hath heard of
[31:07] the father and has been taught of the
[31:08] father
[31:11] and he doesn't intellectually know what
[31:13] it is but he knows one thing for sure
[31:16] thou alone have the words of eternal
[31:18] life i don't i can't compute with what
[31:20] you're speaking amen i can't find it in
[31:23] the bible right now but i know what you
[31:26] just said as words of eternal life
[31:32] amen how did he know that because god
[31:34] with the father was drawing him it was
[31:36] given to him
[31:38] he was already predestinated he was part
[31:40] of that book
[31:42] so now he was beginning
[31:45] to draw
[31:47] god would not keep them in this
[31:48] condition he would bring the revelation
[31:50] of what that meant and we know later
[31:52] that that
[31:53] the apostle paul broke that down brother
[31:55] branham says and there was a meaning
[31:57] behind the words and there was a shadow
[32:00] in the old testament there was a
[32:01] fulfillment in jesus christ and there
[32:03] was a partaking spiritually amen of the
[32:05] word and of the life amen and that was
[32:08] all broken down the disciples will come
[32:10] to understand it later but god was
[32:12] testing them not by understanding he was
[32:14] testing them by revelation of who he was
[32:19] so they could have easily walked away
[32:21] like the others did and felt justified
[32:25] because
[32:27] because they could even argue with the
[32:29] disciples
[32:30] he just said eat my flesh and drink my
[32:32] blood the bible specifically says do not
[32:35] drink blood
[32:37] the bible says pour the blood out even
[32:39] of an animal you're going to eat pour
[32:41] the blood out it has life in it that's
[32:42] for god amen the bible tells us do not
[32:46] drink or eat of the blood and he said
[32:47] unless we eat his blood
[32:50] and it goes to peter you can just
[32:51] imagine the discussions amen peter's
[32:53] extended family and those that didn't
[32:55] like him anyways and they heard a
[32:57] statement like that and said peter what
[32:59] kind of thing are you mixed up in do you
[33:01] see what he's saying that's a
[33:02] contradiction to the word of god and
[33:04] peter doesn't have the answer out of the
[33:06] bible
[33:12] but peter knows it's the words of
[33:14] eternal life
[33:15] amen he he knows it because the father's
[33:18] drawing him because he had heard of the
[33:19] father and been taught of the father
[33:25] praise god
[33:27] that's why jesus said no man
[33:30] can come unto me except it were given
[33:34] unto him
[33:35] of my father
[33:38] if you're able to come to him in this
[33:40] day
[33:41] thank god
[33:43] it was given to you
[33:44] it was not your intellect your wisdom
[33:46] your bible prowess your your your
[33:49] ability to accept the word and your
[33:51] desire to stay with the word hey if you
[33:53] come to this message i guarantee there
[33:55] was some things you had no idea how to
[33:59] explain
[34:01] no idea even where the prophet got that
[34:04] in the bible where where did i never
[34:06] heard a thing like that i never heard it
[34:08] said that before amen when i first heard
[34:10] serpent seed i said it's not even in the
[34:12] bible
[34:16] but it was all through the bible amen
[34:19] it's the false vine running through the
[34:20] entire bible amen
[34:23] but because i hadn't been taught it amen
[34:25] in my in my theological training from
[34:27] going to church by the time i was a
[34:29] little kid in sunday school all the way
[34:31] none of my bible training covered it
[34:33] remember when the prophet said it it was
[34:35] hard for my mind to conceive but there
[34:38] was something inside that was drawn that
[34:40] was attracted amen and it kept pulling
[34:42] and pulling and pulling until the two
[34:44] come together and clicked amen
[34:47] what was that amen my mind was rejecting
[34:50] my bible training was rejecting my
[34:53] desire to stay true to the word
[34:55] to the bible was rejecting what he said
[34:57] but my heart was accepting it amen
[35:00] something inside i was given to me of
[35:02] the father amen to come to him and i
[35:04] could see there's something to this and
[35:07] no matter how much reasoning and
[35:08] rationalization and bible memorization
[35:11] and all these things
[35:13] it doesn't matter how much was there and
[35:15] how much a fear the devil bought by
[35:18] taking a step beyond that
[35:21] i couldn't help it he was drawing me
[35:25] there was a magnetism to the word
[35:32] let's look at first john 4.
[35:47] first john
[35:49] chapter 4
[35:55] and verse 4 first john 4 4.
[36:03] ye
[36:04] are of god
[36:06] little children
[36:09] what are you of
[36:10] god
[36:12] where did you come from
[36:14] god
[36:18] you were of god
[36:21] those are the only ones that can see the
[36:23] father
[36:24] the ones who are of god
[36:27] he said you are of god
[36:29] little children
[36:30] and have overcome them because greater
[36:32] is he that is in you than he that is in
[36:34] the world
[36:35] they of the world therefore speak they
[36:37] of the world and the world heareth them
[36:39] we are of god
[36:42] he that knoweth god heareth us
[36:45] he that is not of god heareth not us
[36:48] hereby know we the spirit of truth and
[36:51] the spirit of error
[36:54] boy john
[36:56] you're pretty boastful
[36:58] you're pretty proud of yourself
[37:00] that seems to be arrogant
[37:06] it's not arrogant it's the truth
[37:09] it's exactly what jesus said amen i pray
[37:11] for not these alone but those that will
[37:12] believe on me through their words amen
[37:15] they had the words and those that were
[37:16] of god were attracted to the word of god
[37:18] and those disciples now were carrying
[37:20] the life they were carrying the spirit
[37:22] they were carrying the word and as they
[37:23] would bring the word amen they were
[37:25] speaking things that people had not
[37:27] heard before they were speaking things
[37:29] that was different than what they were
[37:30] taught but those that were of god heard
[37:32] them amen and it was a it was a
[37:35] vindication that they were of god
[37:38] let's go back to john 17.
[37:41] the gospel of john
[37:43] chapter 17.
[37:58] john 17 and verse 6
[38:03] i have manifested thy name unto the men
[38:06] which thou has which thou gavest me out
[38:08] of the world
[38:10] thine they were and thou gave us them me
[38:13] and they have kept thy word
[38:15] why did they keep the word because they
[38:17] were god they were of god they come from
[38:19] god they belong to god they were gods
[38:22] and god gave them to christ amen so they
[38:25] already belonged to the father they were
[38:27] thine
[38:28] jesus acknowledging i didn't come and
[38:31] find something new i found that was lost
[38:34] amen i didn't come father i have it
[38:36] coming and i got you uh i got you a a
[38:40] bunch of disciples now i got a bunch of
[38:41] men i believe no he was seeking to say
[38:43] that which was the father's already
[38:45] which was of god
[38:48] and he acknowledges that they were thine
[38:51] so we know our position amen if god has
[38:54] called us amen this is why amen
[38:57] predestination is so very true amen
[38:59] because brother ben said predestination
[39:01] was based off for knowledge amen and for
[39:04] knowledge god cannot lose himself god
[39:06] knows that he's portioning himself out
[39:08] into the world and he knows that down
[39:10] through time amen these attributes of
[39:12] himself will be portioned out in
[39:14] different dispensations in different
[39:16] ages and that foreign knowledge he knew
[39:18] who would and who wouldn't because he
[39:19] knew the ones that has been thought of
[39:21] the father and had heard the father and
[39:23] were of god he knew that they would
[39:25] receive
[39:26] it and he knew the rest wouldn't
[39:31] so god by foreknowledge could
[39:33] predestinate he elected he chose amen
[39:36] his attributes to come amen in certain
[39:38] dispensations and certain vessels of
[39:40] clay amen to manifest certain works amen
[39:43] and you because you were there then
[39:46] because you're part of that amen you're
[39:48] part of that great god amen the
[39:50] attributes that we're in god amen the
[39:52] fullness of the word and he portioned a
[39:54] portion of himself out to come into a
[39:56] manifestation of your clay and in your
[39:59] being there's a there's a portion of god
[40:01] a part of the word that's laying there
[40:03] he knew you would believe he knew you
[40:05] would be magnetized with the word he
[40:07] knew he could draw you he knew he had
[40:09] something to work with and he knew that
[40:10] you would believe the word
[40:12] god wasn't hoping he wasn't guessing
[40:16] he wasn't he god wasn't just guessing
[40:19] that one day you would believe and
[40:21] there's a pretty good chance this one
[40:23] will believe and there's a pretty good
[40:24] chance that wouldn't believe that's not
[40:26] how we've been taught in the scriptures
[40:27] and that's not what brother branham
[40:28] taught god already knew because it was
[40:30] with him from the beginning it was his
[40:33] possession that was now fallen into a
[40:35] lost state
[40:37] and he knew that possession would hear
[40:39] his word and believe
[40:42] and it didn't matter what form it came
[40:44] in what tabernacle was speaking the word
[40:47] amen whether it was a rugged man with
[40:49] sheepskin wrapped around him whether it
[40:51] was a high priest that was speaking or
[40:53] it didn't matter or was it as a king
[40:55] giving prophecies and writing songs amen
[40:57] it didn't matter whether it was a farmer
[40:59] named amos who would march down in
[41:01] jerusalem it didn't matter what form it
[41:03] would come in it could be tabernacle
[41:05] behind anything amen but he knew that
[41:07] they were already predisposed they were
[41:10] already genetically programmed to
[41:12] receive the word
[41:14] in their spiritual dna
[41:17] so that's the ones god has been working
[41:19] with and that's one god been working his
[41:21] plan of redemption with is those seed
[41:23] genes of himself
[41:28] and and i lay that all as a foundation
[41:30] to get into what i really am aiming to
[41:33] get into so now if we could turn to
[41:35] matthew 25
[41:37] i want to spend a little time here
[41:40] for the remainder of the service
[41:44] and brothers these are just things the
[41:46] lord is just dealing with me on it seems
[41:48] like as god keeps peeling layers of the
[41:50] word back
[41:52] we keep going back and looking at the
[41:53] things we've looked at over and over and
[41:55] over again but there's a new layer
[41:57] there's a new freshness to it there's a
[41:59] new power there's a new understanding
[42:01] that comes all the time a deeper
[42:03] understanding
[42:05] in matthew 25
[42:07] and let's look at verse 31
[42:13] it says when the son of man shall come
[42:15] in his glory and all the holy angels
[42:17] with him then shall he sit upon the
[42:19] throne of his glory
[42:21] and before him shall be gathered all
[42:23] nations and he shall separate them one
[42:25] from another as a shepherd divided to
[42:28] sheep now if you get into the church age
[42:30] book brother benham says it is not a
[42:32] shepherd dividing his sheep these are
[42:34] not his sheep his sheep have already
[42:36] been gathered into the gardener
[42:39] but it's a typology as a shepherd
[42:42] separating sheep and goats and if you go
[42:45] back to the church age book he puts as
[42:47] in capitals a s as bold capitalized it's
[42:51] it's a type amen so this is not he's not
[42:54] separating sheep and goats he is a as a
[42:56] great shepherd separating two categories
[42:59] of people like a shepherd would separate
[43:01] sheep and ghosts but the sheep are not
[43:04] before him in the judgment the sheep are
[43:06] with him in the judgment
[43:09] he promised he says who that overcometh
[43:11] will sit with me on my throne
[43:13] even as i have overcome and sat with my
[43:15] father on his throne amen and the
[43:17] scripture says know you not that you
[43:19] shall judge the world so we know the
[43:20] saints shall judge the world and we know
[43:22] that that enoch prophet or daniel showed
[43:25] that when the ancient days were coming
[43:27] the books were set and the judgment is
[43:28] set that he would come with and there'd
[43:30] be thousands and thousands that
[43:32] ministered unto him and brother branham
[43:34] and the church age book would say that
[43:35] was his bride for the bride ministers to
[43:37] him they are with him on the throne
[43:39] ministering to him they are together in
[43:42] judgment judging together
[43:45] and this is the second resurrection amen
[43:48] we're all in the second resurrection was
[43:50] the resurrection of the dead
[43:55] saints don't die
[43:57] you never were dead
[43:59] you can't be dead
[44:01] even jesus says they sleep amen the
[44:02] bible says they sleep amen amen don't
[44:05] mourn for those that sleep amen there's
[44:07] there's a sleeping there's just a rest
[44:09] where the body goes into the grave amen
[44:11] and we know that your soul goes into
[44:13] your theophany in the sixth dimension
[44:14] you're not dead you're very much alive
[44:17] and even jesus when they were confused
[44:18] over the resurrection and pharisees and
[44:21] sadducees were battling it out and they
[44:23] bring to him an example this woman amen
[44:25] she has a husband and
[44:27] she has no seed and her husband dies
[44:30] he's got a brother she goes to the
[44:31] brother amen no seed and the process
[44:33] goes seven times and after seven times
[44:36] there's still no seed he said the
[44:38] the sadducees says now in the
[44:41] resurrection
[44:43] whose husband will she be
[44:46] they're trying to trip him up on
[44:47] doctrine because they don't believe in
[44:49] the resurrection
[44:52] and
[44:53] and jesus says
[44:55] you have no idea what you're talking
[44:57] about it's basically what he says
[45:00] but he's putting it layman's terms amen
[45:03] you have no idea what you're talking
[45:04] about
[45:05] for in the resurrection they'll be like
[45:07] angels and they'll be neither given in
[45:09] marriage nor are they married amen they
[45:10] don't have but the member said they
[45:12] don't have those sex glands that'll be
[45:14] no more that way
[45:15] no more marriage in that way
[45:18] so he says that and then he says but
[45:20] does not the scripture say that i am the
[45:23] god of abraham isaac and jacob he's not
[45:26] the god of the dead but god of the
[45:27] living
[45:29] what they were astonished they asked him
[45:31] no more questions where they were
[45:32] astonished at his doctrine what he told
[45:34] them basically is what he said is he
[45:36] says i am god of the living i am not god
[45:39] of the dead
[45:41] you don't believe in a resurrection
[45:42] because you think they're dead but
[45:44] abraham isaac and jacob are not dead but
[45:46] they are alive for i am the god of the
[45:48] living i am not god of the dead so
[45:50] abraham isaac and jacob are alive
[45:55] now is resurrection a problem no
[45:59] but it goes to show that there are some
[46:01] that are alive and there's some that are
[46:03] dead
[46:04] and these are spiritual conditions and
[46:06] are spiritually separated from god
[46:09] and at the white throne judgment it
[46:11] means going to judge the rest of the
[46:12] dead
[46:14] but we are not in that judgment because
[46:17] we bypass judgment amen the bride does
[46:19] not stand in judgment she was in the
[46:21] lambs the eternal part of the book of
[46:23] life the lamb's book of life amen the
[46:25] record of life coming forth of god's own
[46:28] life
[46:29] eternal life zoe life
[46:32] she already has eternal life she does
[46:34] not stand the judgment to find out
[46:36] whether she'll enter into eternal life
[46:38] or not she already has it and she's with
[46:40] christ she's united with christ their
[46:42] husband and wife sitting on the throne
[46:44] together at this judgment and they're
[46:46] judging together for the bible says no
[46:48] you not the saint shall judge the world
[46:51] and this is that
[46:54] judgment let's go back to the scriptures
[46:57] now
[47:01] verse 32 again and before him shall be
[47:03] gathered all nations and they shall
[47:05] separate them one from another as a
[47:07] shepherd as a as a shepherd divided his
[47:09] sheep from the goats
[47:11] and he shall set the sheep on the right
[47:13] hand but the goats on the left
[47:16] then shall the king say unto them on his
[47:18] right hand come ye blessed of my father
[47:20] inherit the kingdom prepared for you
[47:22] from the foundation of the world
[47:25] i was a hungered
[47:27] and you gave me no meat i was thirsty
[47:29] and you gave me drink i was a stranger
[47:32] and you took me in
[47:34] naked and you clothed me and i was sick
[47:36] and you visited me i was in prison and
[47:39] you came unto me
[47:41] then shall the righteous answer him
[47:43] saying lord when saw we thee hungered
[47:47] and fed thee and thirsty and gave thee
[47:50] drink
[47:50] when saw we thee a stranger and took the
[47:53] inner naked and clothed thee our wind
[47:55] saw we these sick are in prison and come
[47:58] unto thee and the king shall answer and
[48:01] say unto them verily verily i say unto
[48:03] you in so much as you have done it unto
[48:06] one of the least of these my brethren
[48:08] you have done it unto me
[48:12] who is he talking to
[48:14] he's talking amen to those that he is
[48:17] going to reward amen with entrance into
[48:19] eternal life and he's saying you're
[48:22] going into eternal life because when i
[48:24] was hungry you fed me
[48:26] because when i was naked and this is
[48:28] this is jesus christ standing there
[48:30] saying when i was naked you clothed me
[48:33] when i was hungry you fed me when i was
[48:36] in prison you visited me and these are
[48:39] people from thousands of years
[48:41] and there's millennia of time
[48:43] represented here and jesus was only on
[48:45] earth for 33 and a half years amen
[48:48] they're asking they're asking a logical
[48:50] question when did we see you and feed
[48:52] you i was alive 2000 years after you
[48:56] were alive on the earth when did i see
[48:58] you and feed you when did i see you and
[49:00] clothe you amen when did i visit you and
[49:03] he says when you've done it to the least
[49:04] of these my brethren that are sitting
[49:06] with me on this throne
[49:09] when you've done it to them you did it
[49:11] unto me
[49:14] jesus is not he's not making that
[49:16] typology he's making it literally man
[49:19] when you did it to them you were doing
[49:22] it to me because this was making up my
[49:24] body amen i was dwelling amongst them
[49:34] i'm going to come back to the scripture
[49:35] but i want to read a quote here on
[49:36] crisis the mystery of god revealed
[49:40] it says now for a text i want to take
[49:42] out of there this for a text basing it
[49:44] upon the entire bible
[49:46] but i want us i want
[49:48] us to title this christ is the mystery
[49:50] of god revealed
[49:52] i believe i can preach every day of my
[49:54] life on that alone christ is the mystery
[49:57] of god revealed
[49:59] that's the seventh seal friends
[50:02] christ being the mystery of god revealed
[50:05] now i took it in order as a sunday
[50:07] school lesson so we could all read
[50:09] together and have this fellowship
[50:10] together
[50:11] now god's secret mystery he had before
[50:14] the world began now back in the back
[50:16] part of god's mind there was something
[50:18] that he was trying and was going to
[50:20] achieve he needed a motive in doing it
[50:22] in order to let himself be expressed
[50:26] so god has this mystery in the back part
[50:29] of his mind a mystery plan a mystery a
[50:33] of a plan an idea of what he wants to do
[50:39] and
[50:41] and he did this he had a motive in doing
[50:43] it he had a motive in doing this
[50:47] in order to let himself be expressed
[50:50] so what was his motive and this great
[50:52] plan that he had amen the motive behind
[50:54] god was to let himself be expressed
[50:57] because first there wasn't even a moon
[50:59] star adam molecule or anything he was
[51:02] god but he exactly wasn't god at that
[51:04] time because god is an object of worship
[51:07] and there wasn't nothing to worship him
[51:09] so in his great mind he wanted these
[51:11] attributes to be expressed and in him
[51:13] was love in him was to be father and him
[51:15] was to be son and him was to be savior
[51:18] and him was to be a healer and all these
[51:20] great attributes that we see already
[51:22] expressed they were in god
[51:24] so in my opinion the first thing that he
[51:26] made was angels and then they worshipped
[51:28] him and that made him god and he started
[51:30] from there as in previous messages i've
[51:32] tried to explain it break it down
[51:35] and now when angels began to worship him
[51:38] that was before there was even a
[51:39] molecule in the earth there was nothing
[51:41] it was all darkness there wasn't no sun
[51:43] nor moon nor stars nor nothing then he
[51:46] was god
[51:47] as he asked job where were you when i
[51:49] laid the foundation of the world see
[51:50] when the morning stars sang together the
[51:52] sons of god shout out for joy see now
[51:54] where were you that was way back before
[51:58] the earth
[52:00] so way back before the earth
[52:03] be before
[52:04] the earth was in the condition we know
[52:06] it's in now god had a plan
[52:08] he wanted to express himself he goes on
[52:11] the quote to say now god had a purpose
[52:14] and a hidden mystery and that's what i
[52:16] want to speak on to the church this
[52:17] morning the hidden mystery of god that
[52:20] he had in his mind before the world ever
[52:22] began and how that it unfolded itself
[52:25] right down to this present hour that
[52:27] we're living
[52:29] the whole plan brother branham was
[52:31] saying god had this plan and that whole
[52:34] plan unfolded itself right down to this
[52:36] present hour
[52:38] right down to now so the plan of god has
[52:40] been unfolding itself even though it was
[52:42] kept in a mystery
[52:44] but that seventh seal was going to be
[52:46] open to the bride and she was going to
[52:47] see the unfolding of god's plan
[52:51] because it came in three folds
[52:54] so it was unfolding itself right to that
[52:56] hour
[52:58] and the message the unveiling of god he
[53:00] says like the attributes see
[53:02] it's in god an attribute is your thought
[53:04] god in the beginning the eternal he
[53:06] wasn't even god he was the eternal he
[53:08] wasn't even god god is an object of
[53:10] worship or something see
[53:12] so he wasn't even that he was elohim the
[53:14] eternal
[53:15] but in him was thoughts he wanted to
[53:17] become material
[53:19] and what did he do then he spoke a word
[53:21] and the word was materialized
[53:23] that's the whole picture from genesis to
[53:25] revelations is nothing wrong it's elohim
[53:28] materializing so he can be touched feel
[53:32] so what is this whole bible this whole
[53:35] bible is elohim being materialized
[53:39] so he can be touched and feel
[53:43] and in the millennium there is elohim
[53:44] sitting on the throne seed that's right
[53:46] with all of his subjects around him that
[53:48] he predestinated before the foundation
[53:51] of the world
[53:52] so god had a great plan and in that plan
[53:56] god was going to express his attributes
[53:58] and those attributes were going to be
[53:59] expressed in man man that he would
[54:02] redeem back from the earth amen and in
[54:04] those men amen would be a portion of
[54:06] that word a part of that word a part of
[54:09] god amen a part of that life a part of
[54:12] zoe life
[54:13] however i don't i don't know all the
[54:15] terms but brother ben uses so many terms
[54:18] an attribute a thought a word there was
[54:21] men that would have this in their soul
[54:23] and they would be going along expressing
[54:25] what was it god is expressing himself
[54:28] god is wanting to be understood god's
[54:30] wanting to express his nature and his
[54:32] characteristics and he's using amen his
[54:34] attributes with the gene inside to begin
[54:37] to express god and down through time
[54:39] they've been expressing god amen and the
[54:41] picture begins to get clearer and
[54:43] clearer and it comes up to jesus christ
[54:45] who's the perfect reflection of god and
[54:47] in him was the fullness of the godhead
[54:48] bodily and all the attributes were in
[54:50] him there
[54:53] that's why
[54:54] amen that's why to me
[54:56] amen
[54:57] this is really my second journey on
[54:59] earth
[55:01] as far as i know i may have had others
[55:03] before because i don't really know what
[55:04] happened before genesis 1 2. amen i
[55:07] don't know i can't say maybe maybe not
[55:09] but one thing i know is brother branham
[55:11] said when he was on the cross i was
[55:13] there with him and he made me pay for my
[55:15] sins when i was there with him on the
[55:17] cross
[55:18] so when all of the word of god and all
[55:20] the attributes of god were expressed in
[55:22] one vessel i was there so this is my
[55:24] second journey on this earth as far as i
[55:26] know
[55:28] i don't even want to put a period behind
[55:29] that
[55:31] i just want to say as far as i know
[55:34] and it certainly won't be my last
[55:36] that i'm sure of
[55:40] and so the whole picture from genesis to
[55:42] revelation is elohim materializing
[55:48] so that he can be touched
[55:51] so that elohim could be
[55:53] touched
[55:58] let's go back to our scripture
[56:03] verse let's pick up in verse 41
[56:08] then shall he say also unto them on the
[56:10] left hand depart from me you cursed unto
[56:12] the everlasting fire
[56:15] prepared for the devil and his angels
[56:17] for i was a hunger
[56:19] and you gave me no meat now listen
[56:21] i want to stop right here
[56:24] jesus said
[56:28] depart from me ye cursed
[56:32] now i don't want you to get in the image
[56:34] we we've got to break away from
[56:36] denominational thinking we've got to
[56:38] stop thinking childish thoughts
[56:42] jesus is not standing up here
[56:45] amen
[56:46] and on the throne and before him are two
[56:48] groups of people that he's separating
[56:50] and one are a bunch of bikers with
[56:52] tattoos and piercings and drug addicts
[56:55] and prostitutes and he's calling them
[56:57] cursed amen for their drug addiction and
[56:59] for their prostitution he's not judging
[57:02] this group and calling them cursed for
[57:04] their sins uh for their expression of
[57:07] unbelief for the demons that they were
[57:09] influenced by he's judging them by how
[57:11] they treated elohim as he was
[57:13] materializing
[57:16] and this judgment is not as though he
[57:19] comes up and say you know you you know
[57:22] you you on earth you had given yourself
[57:24] over to a demonic spirit and and you
[57:26] know you did so much evil and you passed
[57:28] out so much drugs and you killed so many
[57:30] people he's not talking about that in
[57:32] the this this portion of the judgment
[57:34] right here what he's doing is he's
[57:36] separating the sheep and the goats and
[57:38] he's separating them by one thing and
[57:41] one thing only he's separating them by
[57:43] how they dealt with the word and how
[57:45] they treated the word when they come to
[57:47] in contact with the word as it was
[57:49] materializing
[57:54] say brother tim what are you saying just
[57:56] let's just stick with the bible amen
[57:58] let's just stick with the scriptures and
[57:59] get this out of my mind that this is a
[58:01] bad group and this is a good group amen
[58:03] the ones he's calling accursed were
[58:05] priests and preachers and ministers
[58:08] amen people who lived clean lives upon
[58:10] the earth amen they were wholly
[58:12] considered holy men by everybody around
[58:14] them they had families and had children
[58:15] and held down jobs and paid their taxes
[58:17] and obeyed the speed laws and
[58:20] went to church every sunday amen but
[58:22] because they persecuted the true church
[58:24] because they fought against the truth
[58:26] amen because they called blasphemous
[58:28] names to the things that were actually
[58:29] righteous and holy and clean amen he
[58:32] wasn't judging them because they did
[58:34] they lived a nasty life on earth they
[58:36] lived a fine life on earth
[58:41] they they they they did good works on
[58:43] the earth they may have fed the poor
[58:46] they mean they may have have clothed
[58:47] naked children in africa they may have
[58:49] done all kinds of things but god is not
[58:52] calling them cursed amen because they
[58:54] didn't do good works he's calling them
[58:56] cursed because they did not receive the
[58:58] word in their day
[59:02] they didn't even treat it right they
[59:03] didn't even give it uh a clothing they
[59:06] didn't even give when the word was
[59:07] expressed when elohim was materializing
[59:09] they didn't even have the common decency
[59:12] amen to give him a little bit of food or
[59:14] even be kind to him
[59:18] the other group that he says enter you
[59:20] into the joys of the lord amen the other
[59:22] group that he says enter in he wasn't
[59:24] calling them amen if you by human eyes
[59:27] would just look at this you'll see in
[59:30] that group that goes that way will be
[59:32] the biker with the tattoos and the
[59:33] sleeves and the neck piercings but there
[59:35] was something in him that could love an
[59:37] expressed attribute of god there was
[59:38] something in him that just wanted to do
[59:41] something for you it could be your
[59:42] neighbor it could be a co-worker it
[59:44] could be who knows what it will be but
[59:46] there's something in them it's not a
[59:47] seed gene of god because they can't be a
[59:49] seed gene of god and not come all the
[59:51] way into the word amen but but there's
[59:53] something in them that loves elohim
[59:56] materializing
[1:00:00] they may not be able to break out of a
[1:00:02] life of sin they may not be able to stop
[1:00:04] amen the influences of their life or
[1:00:06] overcome past trials as a child and
[1:00:08] afflictions and all the things that they
[1:00:10] may not be able to get free from that
[1:00:12] amen but there's one thing that they can
[1:00:14] do and there's one thing amen that the
[1:00:17] that the lord jesus christ expresses in
[1:00:19] this separation is that when i was
[1:00:22] hungry you fed me
[1:00:24] but what about these tattoos i can take
[1:00:26] care of that
[1:00:31] what about my adultery and what about
[1:00:33] what about this and what about that amen
[1:00:35] that's not in question at this judgment
[1:00:38] at this judgment what is in question is
[1:00:40] what did you do with the word when you
[1:00:42] came in contact with it could you even
[1:00:44] be nice to it amen could you even
[1:00:46] express human love
[1:00:52] if you don't if you don't see the big
[1:00:54] picture if we don't get the big picture
[1:00:57] then this judgment doesn't make sense
[1:01:00] because somebody's judged
[1:01:02] listen they were not even confessing his
[1:01:05] name
[1:01:09] these weren't even christians
[1:01:13] some may have been some may not have
[1:01:14] been christian by name or title
[1:01:18] doesn't even they don't even have to be
[1:01:20] christians
[1:01:21] he's not asking them what they believed
[1:01:27] he's looking at what they did
[1:01:33] if we don't understand the big picture
[1:01:35] that god had a plan
[1:01:37] he had a desire and in the back part of
[1:01:40] his mind when he wasn't even god yet he
[1:01:42] was just elohim
[1:01:44] the self-existing one
[1:01:47] when he was elohim along with his
[1:01:49] attributes he wanted to have an
[1:01:51] expression
[1:01:53] and then that expression he would
[1:01:55] express himself on the earth and and in
[1:01:57] that earth he would express himself
[1:01:59] through men
[1:02:01] portioning himself out allowing that ex
[1:02:04] uh that
[1:02:05] the expression to come forth by degrees
[1:02:08] by generations and by dispensations and
[1:02:11] as it would come down god had a plan and
[1:02:13] he wanted to express and it was going to
[1:02:15] take a long time to express it wasn't
[1:02:17] going to be quick god had a plan in this
[1:02:19] expression and he wanted to express
[1:02:21] redemption and he wanted to express
[1:02:22] salvation he wanted to express holiness
[1:02:24] and he had to let things go bad so they
[1:02:26] could go good and then they had to go
[1:02:27] back he had to let these cycles run so
[1:02:29] he could get a full expression
[1:02:34] but
[1:02:35] but it was god expressing
[1:02:38] it wasn't moses
[1:02:40] it was god in moses
[1:02:43] it wasn't david it was god in david amen
[1:02:45] it wasn't jeremiah was god in jeremiah
[1:02:47] and what was it he was expressing he was
[1:02:50] expressing this plan of god he was
[1:02:52] expressing this desire of god as god was
[1:02:55] rebuilding the masterpiece coming back
[1:02:57] amen to a masterpiece son he was laying
[1:03:00] it through apostles and prophets and and
[1:03:02] upon the psalms and all of this he was
[1:03:04] beginning to to build it back and they
[1:03:06] were expressing and expressing and
[1:03:08] expressing and expressing amen and god
[1:03:11] was so concerned with this expression
[1:03:14] because listen
[1:03:15] we got to stop thinking this was moses
[1:03:18] expressing it was god expressing in a
[1:03:20] man called moses
[1:03:24] but the expression was god amen
[1:03:27] and that expression the way that that
[1:03:30] expression was treated will have
[1:03:32] everything to do with this judgment
[1:03:34] right here
[1:03:36] because it wasn't just
[1:03:38] you know it wasn't just
[1:03:40] a man
[1:03:41] it was god working through the man
[1:03:48] see
[1:03:51] god is righteous and just in everything
[1:03:53] he does
[1:03:56] and when god is going to create an
[1:04:00] opportunity
[1:04:01] for those who are not his attributes his
[1:04:04] seed
[1:04:05] to come into eternal life they will be
[1:04:07] there
[1:04:09] in the new heavens and new earth
[1:04:13] and god is going to bring in
[1:04:15] but the thing is listen
[1:04:17] god
[1:04:18] god is not foolish in any way god is not
[1:04:21] childish in any way god is perfect in
[1:04:22] every way so if he's going to have a
[1:04:25] perfect world purged from all sin and
[1:04:27] he's going to have a world amen where
[1:04:29] the heavens and earth unite into one
[1:04:31] kingdom and he's going to allow other
[1:04:33] people to live in this world why would
[1:04:35] we allow people that don't love his word
[1:04:39] because this is a materialistic
[1:04:40] materialization of the entire word the
[1:04:42] entire thought of god coming to full
[1:04:44] materialization and manifestation in the
[1:04:46] new heavens and new earth why would you
[1:04:47] let somebody in no matter how nice they
[1:04:50] were on earth and how clean they lived
[1:04:51] and how nice they dressed if they didn't
[1:04:53] love the word they won't love new
[1:04:55] heavens and new earth
[1:04:57] but who will he allow to come in those
[1:05:00] that no matter what they struggled with
[1:05:02] and went through in life and how beat
[1:05:03] down or rejected they were but there was
[1:05:05] something in them that could love the
[1:05:07] expression of elohim there was something
[1:05:08] that could love the word he was going to
[1:05:10] bring in those who can love the word
[1:05:15] not those who can receive the word
[1:05:17] they're already in
[1:05:20] we dwell in the city the ones who can
[1:05:21] receive the word dwell in the city but
[1:05:23] those who could love the word dwell
[1:05:25] outside of the city
[1:05:28] so it doesn't matter
[1:05:30] how marked up and how tattooed and how
[1:05:33] rough of a character and how rough of a
[1:05:35] life amen that's that's not what he's
[1:05:38] looking at amen how many good deeds and
[1:05:40] how many evil deeds and that's not what
[1:05:42] he's looking at what he's looking at is
[1:05:44] when you came in contact with the living
[1:05:45] word what was your reaction to the
[1:05:47] living word
[1:05:50] see friends not everybody can believe
[1:05:52] this message
[1:05:54] only a very very few
[1:05:59] but that doesn't mean that we don't care
[1:06:01] for souls
[1:06:03] and that doesn't mean that our only
[1:06:04] objective in this life
[1:06:06] is to get people to the message
[1:06:12] maybe my love for souls can go beyond my
[1:06:15] narrow thinking
[1:06:17] and recognize that there is going to be
[1:06:20] a tremendous amount of mercy granted at
[1:06:22] the white throne judgment
[1:06:24] granted upon people who may not have
[1:06:27] even went to church amen people who may
[1:06:29] have never bowed at an altar and prayed
[1:06:31] amen but people who had the capacity to
[1:06:34] love the expression of god as it was
[1:06:36] expressing through one of god's
[1:06:37] attributes and if they could just love
[1:06:39] that and serve that and do something for
[1:06:41] that there's going to be a reward for
[1:06:43] them at the end of the journey they can
[1:06:44] come into new heavens and new earth
[1:06:46] maybe i need to broaden my focus on
[1:06:48] souls and not just say my only job is
[1:06:51] here to get redeemed souls but i'm also
[1:06:53] here as a door a door of opportunity a
[1:06:56] door of mercy that's been extended amen
[1:07:00] this is like abel cain and abel abel had
[1:07:03] the capacity to receive the revelation
[1:07:05] cain did not have it
[1:07:08] but when abel by revelation was able to
[1:07:11] open the door to what was pleasing to
[1:07:13] god that was the word coming to
[1:07:15] manifestation abel's offering by
[1:07:17] revelation was the word and
[1:07:18] manifestation amen and now cain but
[1:07:22] because abel is rejected in his
[1:07:24] revelation the word cain are accepted
[1:07:27] cain is automatically rejected
[1:07:31] so cain's countenance falls he's upset
[1:07:34] god comes to him he says if you just do
[1:07:36] as your brother will it not be well with
[1:07:38] thee
[1:07:41] if you can just honor the expression
[1:07:45] won't it be well with thee god was not
[1:07:47] saying you're going to be a redeemed son
[1:07:50] no it's not what he was saying
[1:07:52] but abel's ability to catch revelation
[1:07:55] and express that revelation in that day
[1:07:58] was a opportunity of mercy for cain
[1:08:03] and cain would not receive the mercy
[1:08:05] that was opened unto him amen and cain
[1:08:08] judged himself god does not have to
[1:08:10] judge him
[1:08:13] he killed his brother
[1:08:15] doesn't matter what wonderful things he
[1:08:17] did after that
[1:08:19] he had already been judged
[1:08:23] let's continue reading
[1:08:27] verse 41
[1:08:29] they shall then shall he say unto them
[1:08:30] on the left depart from me you you
[1:08:33] cursed
[1:08:34] unto everlasting fire prepared for the
[1:08:37] devil and his angels
[1:08:39] what horrible kinds of things did they
[1:08:42] do
[1:08:45] for i was a hungered and you gave me no
[1:08:47] meat
[1:08:49] i was thirsty and you gave me no drink
[1:08:53] see the denominations picked this up
[1:08:56] and they use this scripture for their
[1:08:58] works programs
[1:08:59] for their missionary endeavors
[1:09:02] trying to promise people a chance at
[1:09:04] eternal life just by feeding a hungry
[1:09:06] person
[1:09:07] or sending clothes to haiti
[1:09:12] how
[1:09:13] how could a just god who lays down his
[1:09:16] law take a violator of the law and
[1:09:18] because he because he just fed amen a
[1:09:23] hungry person and clothed a naked body
[1:09:26] he could receive entrance into eternal
[1:09:27] life and the one who didn't do the good
[1:09:29] missionary works and then that one was
[1:09:31] cursed into everlasting fire it has
[1:09:33] nothing to do with that it's not about
[1:09:35] amen it's not about how many people we
[1:09:37] dress and how many people we feed and
[1:09:38] who we visit in prison it's about what
[1:09:41] you do with elohim with god with jehovah
[1:09:44] when he comes in flesh
[1:09:45] [Applause]
[1:09:47] when the word is made flesh what do we
[1:09:49] do with that that's what this judgment
[1:09:51] is all about he says when you did it
[1:09:53] unto them you did unto me he says you
[1:09:55] fed me you clothed me you visited me
[1:10:01] that's why this judgment is so serious
[1:10:04] and that's why this judgment has such a
[1:10:05] tremendous reward because it was god
[1:10:07] himself
[1:10:09] that we either accepted or rejected that
[1:10:11] we either served or refused to serve
[1:10:15] you know when we get to the new heavens
[1:10:16] and new earth you have those that dwell
[1:10:18] in the city amen but you also have those
[1:10:20] that inhabit the earth outside of the
[1:10:22] city and those that inhabit the earth
[1:10:24] outside of the city they're constantly
[1:10:26] coming to the city because the gates are
[1:10:28] not closed by day or by night
[1:10:31] and the light is always on in this city
[1:10:34] and the the gates are never closed so
[1:10:37] those who are allowed to enter into
[1:10:39] eternal life they have access to the
[1:10:41] tree of life constantly amen they have
[1:10:43] access to the elect the predestination
[1:10:46] they have access to elohim materialized
[1:10:50] well who's that well i trust that i'm
[1:10:52] one of them i trust you're one of them
[1:10:53] i'm trust you'll be one who's in that
[1:10:55] city who will be elohim materialized the
[1:10:57] family of god and flesh
[1:11:01] and they have access
[1:11:03] what gives them access what gives them
[1:11:05] such a wonderful access amen because
[1:11:08] when i when when that expression of
[1:11:10] elohim came down hidden in dusty clay
[1:11:13] like a regular man amen as a neighbor to
[1:11:15] you as a co-worker amen there was
[1:11:17] something in that life that was
[1:11:19] expressing that you were attracted to
[1:11:21] and you wanted to serve in some way you
[1:11:23] wanted to do some good for that in some
[1:11:25] way amen and that's exactly what you'll
[1:11:27] be doing in new heavens and new earth
[1:11:30] because they bring their glory and honor
[1:11:32] into the city
[1:11:33] what is their glory and honor brother
[1:11:35] ben said they're tithed amen they're out
[1:11:36] there farming the land they're bringing
[1:11:38] in all their produce all their tithe
[1:11:40] they're bringing their tithe and
[1:11:41] offering into the city they're doing in
[1:11:43] new heavens and new earth the very thing
[1:11:45] that got them into new heavens and new
[1:11:47] earth and the very reason they were
[1:11:48] granted eternal life they continue to
[1:11:51] serve the body
[1:11:56] i say praise god he's perfect in all of
[1:11:58] his ways
[1:12:04] let's continue reading we'll see if we
[1:12:06] can get further
[1:12:07] verse 42
[1:12:09] for i was a hunger and you gave me no
[1:12:11] meat
[1:12:13] i was thirsty and you gave me no drink
[1:12:16] i was a stranger and you took me on in
[1:12:19] naked and you clothed me not sick and in
[1:12:21] prison and you visited me not
[1:12:24] then shall they answer
[1:12:26] him saying lord
[1:12:27] when saw we thee a hunger or a thirst or
[1:12:30] a stranger or naked or sick or in prison
[1:12:33] and did not minister unto thee then
[1:12:36] shall he answer them saying verily i say
[1:12:38] unto you and so much as you did it not
[1:12:40] to want to lead the least of these you
[1:12:42] did it not to me
[1:12:45] and these things
[1:12:46] and these shall go away into everlasting
[1:12:49] punishment but the righteous and to life
[1:12:52] eternal
[1:12:54] this word that he uses for righteous
[1:12:56] doesn't necessarily mean exactly what we
[1:12:58] would think it would mean we would say
[1:13:01] at this point of the judgment he's
[1:13:02] already passed judgment he's always
[1:13:04] declared the purpose for his judgment
[1:13:06] the reason for his judgment he's
[1:13:07] extended mercy to one and judgment
[1:13:10] eternal punishment to another
[1:13:12] and he's not calling them
[1:13:14] the the righteous as in they were always
[1:13:17] good and did al always did good deeds
[1:13:20] but this word righteous
[1:13:22] it also means it says in a wide sense it
[1:13:24] means upright righteous virtuous
[1:13:28] but it says
[1:13:30] it says in a narrower sense
[1:13:32] rendering to each is due
[1:13:34] in that in a judicial sense
[1:13:37] passing just judgment on others whether
[1:13:39] expressing words are shown by the manner
[1:13:41] of dealing with them
[1:13:42] so they were not righteous in all their
[1:13:45] deeds on earth they didn't live a
[1:13:47] righteous life necessarily but they were
[1:13:50] declared righteous by what they did with
[1:13:52] the word made manifest
[1:13:54] and those deeds were declared as
[1:13:57] righteousness the other deeds were not
[1:14:00] even brought up in this judgment
[1:14:03] so that's how the judge can consider
[1:14:05] them righteous
[1:14:07] because they can go into eternal life
[1:14:10] what made them righteous his declaration
[1:14:12] made them righteous his judgment made
[1:14:14] them righteous when he judged these were
[1:14:16] righteous and these were not
[1:14:18] based off his declaration
[1:14:21] and he based that upon their actions
[1:14:23] when they came in contact with the
[1:14:24] living word
[1:14:26] the word for their day
[1:14:29] let's turn to matthew chapter 10.
[1:14:45] matthew 10
[1:14:48] verse 40.
[1:14:52] he that receiveth you receiveth me
[1:14:55] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[1:14:57] that sent me
[1:14:59] he the receiver the prophet in the name
[1:15:00] of a prophet shall receive a prophet's
[1:15:02] reward and he that receiveth the
[1:15:03] righteous man in the name of a righteous
[1:15:06] man shall receive a righteous man's
[1:15:07] reward
[1:15:08] and whosoever shall give to drink unto
[1:15:11] one of these little ones a cup of cold
[1:15:13] water only in the name of a disciple
[1:15:16] that means they're just a disciple
[1:15:17] they're not a prophet they're not a
[1:15:19] priest they're just a disciple
[1:15:21] they give
[1:15:22] to one of these little ones a cup of
[1:15:24] cold water only in the name of a
[1:15:25] disciple verily i say unto you he shall
[1:15:28] in no wise lose his reward
[1:15:32] is jesus saying
[1:15:34] that somebody who just gives a cup of
[1:15:35] cold water
[1:15:37] until one of these little ones in the
[1:15:39] name of a disciple that's exactly what
[1:15:41] he's saying
[1:15:44] shall not lose his reward
[1:15:47] so there'll be a reward for that and
[1:15:49] according to matthew 25 that'll be a
[1:15:51] great reward
[1:15:54] brother brennan says in the sardisian
[1:15:56] church age
[1:15:57] he says to further clarify notice
[1:15:59] specifically the words of matthew 25
[1:16:02] 31-46
[1:16:03] it does not say that a shepherd is
[1:16:05] literally separating sheep from goats
[1:16:07] but it is as a shepherd dividing sheep
[1:16:09] from goats these are not sheep in this
[1:16:11] particular area of time white throne
[1:16:13] judgment the sheep are in his fold they
[1:16:16] heard his voice word and they followed
[1:16:18] him they already have eternal life and
[1:16:20] cannot come into the judgment
[1:16:23] that's all capitalized by the way
[1:16:25] they already have all capitalized they
[1:16:28] already have eternal life and cannot
[1:16:30] come into the judgment but these do not
[1:16:33] have eternal life and they are in the
[1:16:34] judgment they are allowed to go into
[1:16:37] eternal life but upon what grounds do
[1:16:40] they enter into life eternal
[1:16:42] certainly not upon the fact that they
[1:16:44] already have his life as does the bride
[1:16:46] but they receive it because they were
[1:16:48] kind to his brethren
[1:16:52] let's add to that
[1:16:54] let's make it more than that
[1:16:56] he doesn't he leaves it right there
[1:16:58] there's a period at the end of that
[1:17:00] sentence
[1:17:03] what
[1:17:05] upon what grounds do they enter into
[1:17:08] life eternal
[1:17:10] certainly not be upon the fact that they
[1:17:12] already have his life as does the bride
[1:17:15] but they receive it because they were
[1:17:17] kind to his brethren
[1:17:20] certainly not i'm sorry they are not his
[1:17:23] brethren
[1:17:24] they would make them join heirs with
[1:17:25] jesus they are not heirs to anything but
[1:17:27] life they sh they share no throne et
[1:17:29] cetera with them their names must have
[1:17:30] been in the book of life and not removed
[1:17:33] now because they're love of the people
[1:17:35] of god
[1:17:36] because of their love of the people of
[1:17:38] god they are recognized and saved
[1:17:42] for what because of their love of the
[1:17:44] people of god
[1:17:46] they are recognized and saved
[1:17:49] no doubt these served and helped the
[1:17:51] children of god perhaps
[1:17:53] perhaps like nicodemus and gamalio they
[1:17:56] stood for the children in the time of
[1:17:57] trouble
[1:17:58] if this seems to smack a restoration
[1:18:00] watch carefully now for the wicked are
[1:18:02] not restored but turned into the lake of
[1:18:04] fire the names of many of those
[1:18:06] destroyed were in the book of life also
[1:18:08] but they were blotted out because they
[1:18:10] failed to honor the people of god who
[1:18:12] were the living manifested word living
[1:18:14] epistles for their day
[1:18:18] further down and a couple pages passed
[1:18:20] in the sardian church age he says thus
[1:18:23] if god has so designed it that there be
[1:18:25] those whose names are placed in a
[1:18:27] section of the lamb's book of life and
[1:18:29] cannot be erased for they are the names
[1:18:30] of his bride then we must accept that
[1:18:33] if it also states that there are those
[1:18:35] whose names were placed in the record of
[1:18:36] the book of life but in the
[1:18:38] foreknowledge of god they were to fall
[1:18:40] and have their names removed we must
[1:18:41] accept that
[1:18:43] and if there are those whose names were
[1:18:44] never placed upon the record of life we
[1:18:46] must accept that also
[1:18:48] and if there are those who will enter
[1:18:50] into life eternal after the white throne
[1:18:52] judgment solely
[1:18:54] solely
[1:18:56] he said solely
[1:18:58] solely on the grounds of being good and
[1:19:01] kind and just to the elect of god who
[1:19:04] are his brethren then we cannot but
[1:19:06] accept that for who knoweth the mind of
[1:19:08] the lord that we should instruct him
[1:19:10] rather let us be subject in faith to him
[1:19:13] who is our father and live
[1:19:16] friends that's the truth
[1:19:19] and that's the truth
[1:19:22] that's why
[1:19:24] that's why we should be living for
[1:19:25] others
[1:19:27] that's why we don't disengage from the
[1:19:29] world and pull ourselves into a commune
[1:19:32] i mean we can't do that amen because the
[1:19:34] very fact that abel could receive
[1:19:36] revelation and express that revelation
[1:19:38] opened the door of mercy to cain
[1:19:41] cain's the one who refused that but his
[1:19:43] expression of the word amen gave an open
[1:19:45] door to cain an open door of mercy
[1:19:48] that's why i titled this grace because
[1:19:50] the recipients of grace are the seed
[1:19:52] gene of god he loved them from the
[1:19:54] beginning because he loved himself amen
[1:19:56] it's himself coming into manifestation
[1:19:58] that's his grace
[1:20:01] and because of his grace amen we are we
[1:20:04] are saved through faith amen but grace
[1:20:07] opened mercy amen
[1:20:09] grace grace listen there's nobody that
[1:20:12] ever sought god
[1:20:15] there was no way to be saved once adam
[1:20:18] fell if god had not come down and
[1:20:19] injected himself in the scene there was
[1:20:21] no way ever for there to ever be
[1:20:24] salvation
[1:20:26] but god amen because he would not lose
[1:20:29] his own because of the grace that he had
[1:20:31] already for adam because adam was an
[1:20:34] expressed attribute he came down himself
[1:20:37] and he made a sacrifice and he made a
[1:20:38] way for adam to continue to moving on
[1:20:41] and god's plan would continue forward
[1:20:43] amen but without god's injection without
[1:20:46] god calling to adam there is zero
[1:20:48] opportunity
[1:20:49] for salvation
[1:20:52] now cain is born condemned abel amen is
[1:20:56] also born condemned but abel has a seed
[1:20:58] gene of eternal life on the inside
[1:21:02] and god begins to draw him as he
[1:21:04] meditates and wants to find the right
[1:21:06] ways to worship amen do you think that
[1:21:08] abel just all of a sudden decided to
[1:21:10] worship god was drawing him to worship
[1:21:14] but he was seeking a revelation and and
[1:21:16] abel didn't come up with his own
[1:21:17] revelation god gave him a revelation and
[1:21:20] what was god doing god was calling to
[1:21:23] his elect god was revealing himself to
[1:21:25] his elect he was opening himself to his
[1:21:27] elect so that his elect could express
[1:21:29] the word because by his grace he would
[1:21:32] reveal himself by faith to abel and by
[1:21:35] faith abel will express the word for his
[1:21:37] day making him a recipient of that grace
[1:21:43] and in doing so he would open an
[1:21:46] opportunity for cain
[1:21:50] cain's upset because he's rejected
[1:21:54] but god says if you'll just do as your
[1:21:56] brother won't it be well with thee
[1:21:59] and he could not receive it
[1:22:02] so he condemned himself
[1:22:08] let's turn to matthew 5.
[1:22:12] listen i'm going through some of the
[1:22:14] most simple scriptures
[1:22:17] fundamental out of the gospels but with
[1:22:20] the revelation of the word they
[1:22:22] explode and we start to see purposes and
[1:22:25] plans of god and things that he for
[1:22:28] ordained and reasons that we're here
[1:22:30] there's a reason you're in the
[1:22:31] neighborhood you're in there's a reason
[1:22:33] you work in the place you work amen
[1:22:35] you're there and you're there by grace
[1:22:37] and by grace god has given you his word
[1:22:39] amen by you receiving faith to believe
[1:22:41] his word you become a recipient of that
[1:22:43] grace you're born again amen and you
[1:22:45] start to express the very life of jesus
[1:22:48] christ and in so doing you've opened the
[1:22:50] door to mercy that everybody that comes
[1:22:52] in contact with you amen will be judged
[1:22:54] on the day of judgment by what they did
[1:22:56] with god expressed in you
[1:23:03] matthew 5 13.
[1:23:08] ye are the salt of the earth
[1:23:12] salt preserves
[1:23:14] salt saves
[1:23:17] you are the salt of the earth but if the
[1:23:18] salt have lost its savior wherewith
[1:23:20] shall it be salted it is henceforth good
[1:23:22] for nothing but to cast out and be
[1:23:24] trodden under foot of men
[1:23:26] ye are the light of the world a city
[1:23:28] that is set on a hill cannot be hid
[1:23:30] neither do men light a candle and put it
[1:23:32] under a bushel but on a candlestick and
[1:23:34] it giveth light unto all that are in the
[1:23:36] house
[1:23:37] let your light so shine before men that
[1:23:40] they may see your good works and glorify
[1:23:42] your father which is in heaven
[1:23:46] he's giving us basic instructions in
[1:23:49] matthew jesus is saying
[1:23:51] you're the salt of the earth
[1:23:53] but as if you lost your savior who's
[1:23:55] going to take the salt
[1:23:57] who will be preserved
[1:24:00] if you've lost your savior
[1:24:03] ye are the light of the world but who
[1:24:05] will find their way if it's under a
[1:24:07] bushel basket
[1:24:10] see you're here
[1:24:12] as salt you're here as light
[1:24:16] not for yourself
[1:24:18] but so somebody else can benefit from
[1:24:20] that
[1:24:22] you take a light and set it on a hill
[1:24:26] you don't put it under a bushel basket
[1:24:28] but you put it on the candlestick and it
[1:24:29] gives the light unto all that are in the
[1:24:30] house
[1:24:32] let your light so shine before men that
[1:24:34] they may see your good works that means
[1:24:36] live the life in front of them live the
[1:24:39] manifested word live the life of jesus
[1:24:42] christ tell me what other good works
[1:24:45] there are what else would this be
[1:24:46] referring to amen it's living it's the
[1:24:49] manifested life of jesus christ his life
[1:24:52] manifested in bright form that's the
[1:24:54] life that we're supposed to be living
[1:24:57] let your good works and
[1:24:59] that they may see your good good works
[1:25:01] and glorify your father which is in
[1:25:03] heaven this word glorify if you look it
[1:25:06] up it means to think suppose be of an
[1:25:09] opinion
[1:25:12] to praise extol magnify celebrate or to
[1:25:15] honor to do honor to hold an honor
[1:25:18] so your very conduct
[1:25:21] the way they see your good works will
[1:25:24] give them the thoughts and honor that
[1:25:26] they have towards god
[1:25:29] because
[1:25:30] what you're expressing why why is it so
[1:25:33] many people don't want to be christians
[1:25:34] and they say they're all a bunch of
[1:25:35] hypocrites because of the expression
[1:25:37] that they saw
[1:25:39] and because of the expression they saw
[1:25:41] they cannot glorify the father
[1:25:44] but when they see a true expression it
[1:25:47] says then what this word glory means is
[1:25:49] to think suppose be of opinion what it
[1:25:52] does is it shapes their opinion about
[1:25:54] god and when they begin to glorify
[1:25:57] that god in you their opinion of god is
[1:26:00] set right set correct they may never
[1:26:02] come to god but what they're doing is
[1:26:04] expressing what they like about you is
[1:26:06] the god in you what they love about your
[1:26:08] characters god's character and you what
[1:26:10] they love about your honesty and your
[1:26:12] integrity it's the life of jesus christ
[1:26:14] in you
[1:26:16] and when they express that they they're
[1:26:18] glorifying the father
[1:26:21] because where did you come from
[1:26:23] the father
[1:26:24] whose life is in you the fathers
[1:26:28] who are you of your father
[1:26:32] when my children get caught doing good
[1:26:34] works
[1:26:37] it glorifies their father
[1:26:42] brother rem says in god's provided place
[1:26:44] of worship
[1:26:46] he says but he promised just before the
[1:26:47] coming of the end time the world would
[1:26:49] get like it was in sodom
[1:26:51] when a man come down in human form three
[1:26:54] of them two angels and god himself that
[1:26:56] was god the bible said it was
[1:26:58] now he come down and he manifests
[1:26:59] himself there by turning his back in the
[1:27:02] temp where sarah was and told abraham
[1:27:04] what sarah was thinking in the tent is
[1:27:06] that right
[1:27:08] now jesus himself said at that day when
[1:27:10] the son of man is being revealed in
[1:27:12] other words the son of man the ministry
[1:27:14] of jesus christ
[1:27:16] himself the church will come through
[1:27:18] justification through luther through
[1:27:21] sanctification through wesley through
[1:27:23] the baptism of the holy ghost of the
[1:27:24] pentecostals and go right on into the
[1:27:26] perfection of the son of man that when
[1:27:28] the husband and wife will be the same
[1:27:31] self-person
[1:27:33] god will be so manifested into his
[1:27:35] brightest church till they both be the
[1:27:37] same they are one
[1:27:39] now you see where we're at
[1:27:42] well take that revelation and apply it
[1:27:45] to these scriptures
[1:27:47] if they will be so one that is christ's
[1:27:49] life expressed in her
[1:27:51] the way you treat her is the way you
[1:27:53] treat him
[1:27:56] the way you accept or reject her is the
[1:27:59] way you accept to reject him because in
[1:28:01] the end time the mystery is he's come in
[1:28:04] the formation of the bride it's his life
[1:28:06] here in her
[1:28:08] and how she's treated is how he's
[1:28:11] treated
[1:28:12] that goes all the way back to matthew
[1:28:14] 25.
[1:28:17] i want to look at an example of this in
[1:28:19] the bible let's turn to genesis chapter
[1:28:20] 12.
[1:28:35] genesis chapter 12
[1:28:37] and i say oh god help me
[1:28:40] help me to express this
[1:28:43] genesis chapter 12.
[1:28:49] now the lord had said verse 1 now the
[1:28:52] lord had said unto abram get thee out of
[1:28:55] the country and from thy kindred and
[1:28:57] from thy father's house into a land that
[1:28:59] i will show thee and i will make of thee
[1:29:01] a great nation and i will bless thee and
[1:29:03] make thee a great name and thou shalt be
[1:29:05] blessed
[1:29:06] thou shalt be a blessing
[1:29:08] so abraham wasn't to be blessed abraham
[1:29:11] was actually going to be a blessing
[1:29:14] and how
[1:29:15] look
[1:29:16] and i will bless them that bless thee
[1:29:19] and curse them that curses thee
[1:29:21] and in thee shall all the families of
[1:29:23] the earth be blessed
[1:29:25] abraham is beginning his journey and
[1:29:27] he's moving and then he's moving there's
[1:29:29] a promise that he will be a blessing
[1:29:32] and it'll become a blessing out of him
[1:29:34] into all the failings of the earth but
[1:29:35] he himself would be a blessing then he
[1:29:37] says all that bless you will be blessed
[1:29:40] and all that curse you will be cursed
[1:29:42] so abraham is an elect predestinated
[1:29:45] seed gene of god that god has called for
[1:29:47] this hour to express part of his word is
[1:29:50] that true
[1:29:51] and he begins to move at the calling of
[1:29:53] god into that expression and as he
[1:29:55] begins to move at the calling of god
[1:29:57] into the expression of god and he begins
[1:29:59] to move through palestine and all of a
[1:30:01] sudden because he's an expression of a
[1:30:05] thought of god and he's moving according
[1:30:08] to god's commandment now he becomes
[1:30:11] judgment upon the earth
[1:30:15] his very person becomes judgment upon
[1:30:18] the earth now when he's coming in
[1:30:20] contact with people in palestine when
[1:30:22] he's talking with the hittites when he's
[1:30:24] speaking amen with with others amen now
[1:30:28] god has already said whoever blesses you
[1:30:30] will be blessed and whoever curses you
[1:30:32] will be cursed so now the reaction to
[1:30:34] abraham abraham is here his very
[1:30:37] presence is judgment upon the earth
[1:30:41] god is already separating as a shepherd
[1:30:44] separates the sheep from the goats in
[1:30:46] the life of this expression the
[1:30:48] separation has already begun
[1:30:51] amen the determination the final decree
[1:30:55] will be made at the white throne
[1:30:56] judgment but they're already separating
[1:30:58] themselves into two categories by how
[1:31:01] they react to abraham because abraham is
[1:31:04] an expression amen of the word of god
[1:31:07] god never said this when abraham was
[1:31:09] down on earth and god never said this
[1:31:11] amen until he called him when he called
[1:31:13] him out he began to move him in his
[1:31:15] commission and as he began to walk in
[1:31:17] his purpose the purpose of god that he
[1:31:19] had in abraham and he began to express
[1:31:21] god's purpose and as he moved into that
[1:31:24] calling into that position god would now
[1:31:26] say whoever blesses you you'll be
[1:31:28] blessed whoever curses you be cursed and
[1:31:30] as he's moving as the expressed word of
[1:31:32] god he now not abraham the man but the
[1:31:36] expression of the word in him becomes a
[1:31:38] judgment
[1:31:40] upon the earth
[1:31:46] there'll be those that enter in to
[1:31:48] eternal life after the white throne
[1:31:50] judgment because of how they treated
[1:31:51] abraham
[1:31:54] when he moved into palestine
[1:31:56] do you know when abraham went into
[1:31:57] palestine he had friends
[1:32:00] he had associates he associated with
[1:32:05] and they they're the ones who went with
[1:32:06] him to battle to help him when he went
[1:32:08] to recover a lot
[1:32:10] do you think they'll get a reward
[1:32:13] he already foreshadowed the reward amen
[1:32:15] because amen he already foreshadowed the
[1:32:17] reward because the king of sodom tried
[1:32:20] to give him all the riches he said i'll
[1:32:21] not take it i already raised my hand to
[1:32:23] god and swore that i will not receive
[1:32:24] any unless thou say thou made abraham
[1:32:27] rich amen but he gave ties to
[1:32:28] melchizedek and then then he was not
[1:32:31] going to touch anything else he said
[1:32:33] except for the portion to my fellows who
[1:32:35] came with me
[1:32:37] who were those those were the three
[1:32:38] brothers on the planes of memory his
[1:32:40] friends his colleagues amen that were in
[1:32:42] agreement with him that went with him
[1:32:43] that helped him what did they get and
[1:32:45] when he met melchizedek when he was
[1:32:47] trying to be rewarded by man he refused
[1:32:49] all the man's rewards because he wanted
[1:32:50] the blessing that come from melchizedek
[1:32:52] but he says you can bless my friends
[1:32:56] already foreshadowing the white throne
[1:32:58] judgment
[1:33:01] because we come after abraham abraham is
[1:33:03] our father of faith amen we're we're by
[1:33:06] faith to see the children of abraham
[1:33:08] so what happened there is still
[1:33:10] happening in the same seed line
[1:33:15] it's already in the bible it's
[1:33:17] throughout the bible
[1:33:21] and the message who is this melchizedek
[1:33:23] he says did you get it let me say that
[1:33:25] again the predestination is the only one
[1:33:27] that's considered in redemption
[1:33:30] people might be making like they are but
[1:33:32] the really redemption is those who are
[1:33:33] predestinated because the very word
[1:33:36] means bring to bring back is that right
[1:33:40] the redeem is something to redeem
[1:33:42] anything is to bring it back to its
[1:33:43] original place hallelujah so it's only
[1:33:45] the predestination will be brought back
[1:33:47] because the others didn't come from
[1:33:48] there see bring back
[1:33:52] being eternal with him at the beginning
[1:33:54] the eternal life that you had his
[1:33:55] thought of you that is thought of what
[1:33:58] you was only he wanted he wanted me to
[1:34:01] stand in the pulpit say he wanted you to
[1:34:03] sit at the seat tonight then we are
[1:34:05] serving his eternal purpose and the one
[1:34:08] that left home only come to earth to
[1:34:10] serve his purpose
[1:34:13] who's he talking about brother is he
[1:34:15] talking about abraham brother no he's
[1:34:16] talking about me the one that left home
[1:34:19] only come to serve his eternal purpose
[1:34:21] amen
[1:34:23] so abram when god called him he had come
[1:34:26] from the mind of god
[1:34:28] a thought that was going to be expressed
[1:34:30] and abram amen converted to abraham what
[1:34:33] was it was god's thinking god's thought
[1:34:36] being expressed on this earth and he
[1:34:38] only come to earth to express god's
[1:34:40] purpose and as he was expressing god's
[1:34:42] purpose amen all those who come in
[1:34:44] contact with that purpose will either be
[1:34:46] cursed or blessed
[1:34:53] the one that left home only come to
[1:34:55] earth to serve his purpose is that right
[1:34:56] all right then after it's finished it's
[1:34:59] brought back in a glorified state it's
[1:35:01] matured and brought back again
[1:35:03] that's redemption
[1:35:05] redemption is the one that come down
[1:35:07] come and express god's purpose and after
[1:35:09] expresses god's purpose it matures and
[1:35:11] finally is brought back to a glorified
[1:35:13] state amen in a restoration but along
[1:35:17] the way of that journey amen when they
[1:35:19] come down when you and i and every
[1:35:22] expressed attribute of god comes and
[1:35:24] begins to express the light for your day
[1:35:26] begin to manifest the very word of god
[1:35:29] for that hour amen it is elohim
[1:35:31] materializing
[1:35:35] and it's judgment upon the earth
[1:35:39] why is it judgment because when we come
[1:35:42] to the white throne judgment amen god
[1:35:45] was not deciding then what he would do
[1:35:46] with these people it was already decided
[1:35:48] by what they did when they come in
[1:35:50] contact with word at the time they come
[1:35:52] in contact with the word
[1:35:54] they already made their choice
[1:35:56] god is just giving them their sentence
[1:35:59] they already made their choice
[1:36:02] they already moved to one side or the
[1:36:04] other god is now just giving the
[1:36:06] sentence or the results of their choice
[1:36:11] you and i friends are judgments
[1:36:16] if you're an expressed attribute of god
[1:36:19] if god
[1:36:20] if you if you were part of that thinking
[1:36:22] that god had before the foundation of
[1:36:24] the world you're part of that word and
[1:36:26] that word is portioned in you for an
[1:36:28] expression and you're moving by the
[1:36:30] leadership of god and expressing the
[1:36:31] word amen it's the word made flesh today
[1:36:34] it's the word and expression today
[1:36:36] friends that word is now judging the
[1:36:39] world
[1:36:44] people are determining their eternal
[1:36:47] destination of what they do with that
[1:36:50] word being expressed through you and i
[1:36:52] yeah
[1:36:54] that's the bible
[1:36:56] that's the scriptures that's the truth
[1:37:02] that's why we can't take this candle and
[1:37:04] put it under a bushel
[1:37:07] that's why the salt can't lose its
[1:37:08] savior that's why we can't express
[1:37:10] anything else but the word
[1:37:13] and just the word amen because there's
[1:37:15] got to be an attracting name and for
[1:37:17] those that will be declared righteous i
[1:37:19] don't want by my failure and by my my my
[1:37:22] getting smutted up with the world am i
[1:37:24] being too tired to express today and my
[1:37:27] being too frustrated i don't want to
[1:37:29] bring amen condemnation upon somebody
[1:37:31] else by my actions
[1:37:35] say brother chad can you do that
[1:37:37] yeah
[1:37:38] let's read the bible
[1:37:44] let's go to genesis 20.
[1:37:49] verse 1
[1:37:54] genesis chapter 20 verse 1
[1:38:00] and abraham journeyed from thence toward
[1:38:03] the south country and dwelled between
[1:38:05] kadesh
[1:38:07] and sure and sojourned in gerar
[1:38:10] and abraham said of sarah
[1:38:12] his wife she is my sister and abimelech
[1:38:14] king of gerard sent and took sarah
[1:38:16] but
[1:38:17] god came to abimelech
[1:38:20] in a dream by night and said to him
[1:38:22] behold thou art but a dead man
[1:38:25] for the woman which thou hast taken for
[1:38:27] she is a man's wife but abhimalek cannot
[1:38:31] come near her and he said lord wilt thou
[1:38:33] slay also a righteous nation
[1:38:36] said said he not unto me she is my
[1:38:39] sister and she even she herself said he
[1:38:41] is my brother and the integrity of my
[1:38:43] heart and the innocency of my hands have
[1:38:46] i done this
[1:38:47] and god said unto him
[1:38:49] in a dream yea i know that thou didst
[1:38:51] this in the integrity of thy heart for i
[1:38:53] also withheld thee from sinning against
[1:38:55] me
[1:38:56] therefore suffered i.d not to touch her
[1:38:59] now therefore restore the man his wife
[1:39:01] for he is a prophet and he shall pray
[1:39:03] for thee and thou shalt live and if thou
[1:39:06] restore her not know thou that thou
[1:39:08] shalt surely die thou and all that are
[1:39:11] thine
[1:39:14] what did abimelech do wrong
[1:39:17] nothing
[1:39:19] where was abimelech's error
[1:39:22] where was his sin where was his failure
[1:39:24] where was he guilty
[1:39:28] abraham was an expression of elohim
[1:39:33] the very thoughts of god expressing god
[1:39:35] was writing his bible as abraham was
[1:39:38] moving through the earth abraham comes
[1:39:40] amen to garrar he's not even really
[1:39:43] supposed to leave the land but he moves
[1:39:44] down to gerrard amen and he tells they
[1:39:47] lie they say hey this is my brother
[1:39:50] sarah says abraham says sarah's my
[1:39:52] sister sarah says this is my brother
[1:39:54] amen and they deceive abimelech and
[1:39:56] abimelech takes her to be his wife amen
[1:39:59] he hasn't done anything wrong he says
[1:40:01] lord know the integrity of my heart and
[1:40:03] the innocency of my
[1:40:06] hands god said i know that's why i
[1:40:09] stopped you
[1:40:11] that's why i stopped you
[1:40:13] because you're cursed and they were
[1:40:15] already cursed because the bible says
[1:40:17] we'll get to in a minute it says he had
[1:40:19] fast shut up the wounds of his household
[1:40:22] in all the nation
[1:40:24] they were already cursed because they
[1:40:26] were beginning a curse upon abraham but
[1:40:29] it was abraham's fault
[1:40:33] it was abraham's deception it was
[1:40:36] abraham's fear amen abraham's lack of
[1:40:39] faith abraham's lack of faith to stay in
[1:40:41] the land abraham's lack of faith that
[1:40:43] god would protect him abraham's fear
[1:40:45] expressed abraham's deception and all of
[1:40:47] that was causing abimelech and to get in
[1:40:49] trouble with god but abraham was not
[1:40:52] getting in trouble with god
[1:40:59] it's just the bible
[1:41:00] that's all friends
[1:41:02] it's not like your thinking
[1:41:04] it's not like your justice in your mind
[1:41:06] of fairness your human mind of fairness
[1:41:08] is so different than god your human mind
[1:41:11] of justice just cast it out right now
[1:41:13] because god is not looking at this as
[1:41:15] one man offending another man god says i
[1:41:17] stopped you from sinning against me
[1:41:21] because this is my expression this is my
[1:41:23] word amen that woman has got to bring
[1:41:25] forth the promised son because it's my
[1:41:26] word this is an expression of my thought
[1:41:29] that i had before the foundation of the
[1:41:30] world and you by laying your hand upon
[1:41:33] that no matter how innocent you are
[1:41:34] you've brought a curse upon yourself
[1:41:36] because this word has to be expressed
[1:41:40] and how you come in contact with that
[1:41:41] expression regardless of your ignorant
[1:41:44] about it or not
[1:41:46] [Applause]
[1:41:48] amen
[1:41:50] regardless
[1:41:51] if how ignorant you are or not
[1:41:55] when you begin
[1:41:58] to touch the expression of god
[1:42:01] you find yourself cursed
[1:42:03] when you come against in any way the
[1:42:06] word of god
[1:42:09] you find yourself cursed
[1:42:12] abemolek in the integrity of his heart
[1:42:15] and the infancy innocency of his hand he
[1:42:18] was actually coming against the word
[1:42:22] he didn't mean to
[1:42:24] he didn't know that he was but he was
[1:42:26] actually coming against the word
[1:42:29] that's why i say friends be careful what
[1:42:30] you say about any other human being
[1:42:34] i don't care what they've done or what
[1:42:35] they said especially if they claim to be
[1:42:37] a believer you keep your lips zipped
[1:42:39] amen because you have no idea what god
[1:42:42] is expressing amen this is not a time to
[1:42:44] be critical about brothers and sisters
[1:42:46] this is a time to just not touch
[1:42:47] anything and let god sort it all out
[1:42:50] this is a confusing time and it's meant
[1:42:52] to be confusing because god is
[1:42:54] separating those
[1:42:56] who will from those who won't
[1:43:00] let god do his work but don't find
[1:43:02] herself even in ignorance
[1:43:04] fighting against god
[1:43:06] or touching his word in the wrong way
[1:43:12] he says i want to back up here and look
[1:43:17] verse 4 but abimelech had not come near
[1:43:20] her and he said lord will thou slay also
[1:43:23] a righteous nation
[1:43:25] why does he make this statement
[1:43:27] we're going to find the statement
[1:43:29] further down in the story i'm going to
[1:43:31] jump to it in verse 18.
[1:43:36] for the lord had fast closed up all the
[1:43:38] wombs of the house of abimelech because
[1:43:41] of sarah abraham's wife
[1:43:44] god had already brought the curse on his
[1:43:47] house
[1:43:49] and was going to kill the
[1:43:51] but it says for the lord had
[1:43:54] fast closed up all the wounds he had
[1:43:57] already done it that's why abimelech
[1:44:00] said will thou destroy a righteous
[1:44:02] nation because when you fast close up
[1:44:03] the wounds of everything you're going to
[1:44:05] kill that whole nation off
[1:44:07] they have no more children no more
[1:44:09] offspring
[1:44:11] so the the curse was already in effect
[1:44:15] because abimelech was going to take
[1:44:17] sarah who was beautiful to be his wife
[1:44:19] and he did it in innocency
[1:44:22] he wasn't meaning to be an offense or
[1:44:24] bring an offense to the word of god but
[1:44:26] if he would have went forward with his
[1:44:28] actions he would have been offense
[1:44:29] directly against the word of god
[1:44:37] let's go to matthew 18.
[1:44:40] keep your plate keep your finger here
[1:44:41] genesis 20 and turn with me quickly in
[1:44:43] matthew 18. i just want to look at a
[1:44:45] scripture
[1:44:53] matthew 18
[1:44:59] verse 1.
[1:45:03] at the same time came the disciples unto
[1:45:06] jesus saying
[1:45:07] who is the greatest in the kingdom of
[1:45:09] heaven
[1:45:10] and jesus called a little child unto him
[1:45:12] and set him in the midst of them
[1:45:14] and said verily i say unto you except
[1:45:16] you be converted and become as little
[1:45:18] children you should not enter into the
[1:45:20] kingdom of heaven
[1:45:22] whosoever there shall for therefore
[1:45:24] shall humble himself as this little
[1:45:26] child the same is greatest in the
[1:45:28] kingdom of heaven
[1:45:31] and whoso shall receive one such little
[1:45:34] child in my name receiveth me
[1:45:36] now jesus brings the little child into
[1:45:38] the group i've explained this before but
[1:45:40] he brings this little child into the
[1:45:42] group to use him as an example
[1:45:45] an example of how you ought to believe
[1:45:48] as a child
[1:45:50] so if you can humble yourself like this
[1:45:52] child and accept the true word and
[1:45:54] believe it like this child you'll be
[1:45:56] greatest in the kingdom
[1:45:58] and whosoever shall receive one such
[1:46:00] little child he's not talking about this
[1:46:02] little child anymore and now he's not
[1:46:04] talking about children
[1:46:06] now he's referring to children of the
[1:46:08] kingdom those who can humble themselves
[1:46:10] and believe the word so he's not talking
[1:46:12] about little kids
[1:46:14] this is where denominations also
[1:46:16] absolutely destroy everything jesus is
[1:46:18] teaching because now brother uh
[1:46:21] now
[1:46:22] jesus is going to say now when you
[1:46:25] receive one such little child
[1:46:27] who shall receive one such little child
[1:46:29] in my name receiveth me
[1:46:32] and now if i just do good to all the
[1:46:34] little kids i'm receiving the lord
[1:46:35] because the lord's like little children
[1:46:37] he loves it when you're good to little
[1:46:38] children that's not what this scripture
[1:46:40] is talking about
[1:46:42] you can't start an orphanage to fulfill
[1:46:44] this scripture
[1:46:46] he's talking about the children of the
[1:46:47] kingdom those that humble themselves
[1:46:49] like this little child does and takes me
[1:46:51] at my word and believes me and if you
[1:46:53] receive one such little child as that
[1:46:55] then you receive me
[1:46:57] now i don't believe in being mean to
[1:46:58] little children but
[1:47:00] it's not jesus is not saying if you're
[1:47:02] good to a little child in my name in
[1:47:04] jesus name i'm going to be good to you
[1:47:06] little child
[1:47:07] i've just received jesus that's not what
[1:47:09] he's saying
[1:47:11] but they take this scripture and plaster
[1:47:13] it all over denominational orphanages
[1:47:17] misusing the word of god taking it out
[1:47:20] of context and out of place and so
[1:47:21] obscuring the meaning that nobody no
[1:47:23] longer knows what it means
[1:47:25] now if we're bad the little children
[1:47:26] we're going to go to hell for good the
[1:47:28] little children then we receive jesus
[1:47:30] it's talking about children of the
[1:47:31] kingdom
[1:47:33] when you receive one of the children of
[1:47:35] the kingdom you receive jesus
[1:47:42] next verse 6
[1:47:44] but whoso whoso shall offend one of
[1:47:46] these little ones
[1:47:48] which believe in me
[1:47:50] it were better for him that a millstone
[1:47:52] were hanged about his neck that he would
[1:47:54] drown in the depths of the sea
[1:47:57] he's not just referring to people who
[1:47:59] mistreat children
[1:48:01] he's talking about those who would
[1:48:02] offend the children of the kingdom
[1:48:06] if those would offend the children of
[1:48:08] the kingdom it's better for them that a
[1:48:10] millstone were tied around their neck
[1:48:11] and they were cast into the midst of the
[1:48:13] sea
[1:48:16] this is what jesus thinks about that
[1:48:19] you receive one of his little children
[1:48:21] in my name you receive me
[1:48:24] you offend one it would be better for
[1:48:26] you that a millstone cast about your
[1:48:28] neck and that you cast into the middle
[1:48:29] of the sea
[1:48:31] why because those little children
[1:48:34] are materialized elohim
[1:48:38] they are the plan and word and thoughts
[1:48:40] of god moving into flesh
[1:48:43] and expressing out the portion of the
[1:48:45] word for that day
[1:48:46] to receive one as to receive christ to
[1:48:49] offend one and that means to cause to
[1:48:51] stumble or to trip up to offend one it
[1:48:54] would better for you
[1:48:56] that a millstone would tie it about your
[1:48:58] neck and you're cast to the middle of
[1:48:59] the sea
[1:49:01] i say
[1:49:02] touch none of god's elected
[1:49:05] i don't care what they've done wrong
[1:49:07] don't touch them
[1:49:12] let's go while we're here keep your
[1:49:13] finger i'm not forgotten genesis 20. but
[1:49:15] let's go to galatians 3.
[1:49:25] galatians chapter 3.
[1:49:35] all right
[1:49:37] verse 14.
[1:49:42] that the blessing of abraham might come
[1:49:45] on all the gentiles through jesus christ
[1:49:48] that we might receive the promise of the
[1:49:50] spirit through faith
[1:49:52] brethren i speak after the manner of men
[1:49:55] though it be but a man's covenant yet if
[1:49:57] it be confirmed no man disannulleth her
[1:49:59] add it thereto now to abraham and to his
[1:50:02] seed were the promises made he saith not
[1:50:05] unto seeds as in many but as of one and
[1:50:07] to thy seed which is christ
[1:50:10] so the promises to the christ seed which
[1:50:13] you and i are part of if we're part of
[1:50:15] christ
[1:50:16] so the promises of abraham and the
[1:50:18] blessings of abraham have come right
[1:50:20] down to us
[1:50:22] so what happened between abraham and
[1:50:23] abimelech if the same thing happened to
[1:50:25] you it would bring the same results
[1:50:27] because the blessing of abraham who
[1:50:29] blesses you all blessed who curses you
[1:50:31] all cursed that's come down to us the
[1:50:33] promises of abraham to possess the gates
[1:50:35] of your enemy and to possess all things
[1:50:37] that promises come down to us too
[1:50:40] because the promise was to the seed to
[1:50:41] christ
[1:50:42] and if you're part of christ you're part
[1:50:44] of that promise and you're part of that
[1:50:46] blessing
[1:50:49] so now who blesses you will be blessed
[1:50:52] and who curses you will be cursed
[1:50:56] let's go back to genesis 20.
[1:51:06] back to verse five i just want to read
[1:51:07] that again
[1:51:09] said he not unto me
[1:51:11] she is my sister
[1:51:13] and she even she herself said he is my
[1:51:15] brother and the integrity of my heart
[1:51:17] and the innocence of my hands have i
[1:51:19] done this
[1:51:20] and god said unto him in a dream yea i
[1:51:23] know that thou didst this in the
[1:51:25] integrity of thy heart for i also
[1:51:27] withheld thee from sinning against me
[1:51:29] therefore suffered i.d not to touch her
[1:51:32] now therefore restore the man his wife
[1:51:34] for he is a prophet
[1:51:36] and he shall pray for thee
[1:51:38] and thou shalt live and if thou restore
[1:51:40] her not
[1:51:41] know thou that thou shalt surely die
[1:51:44] thou
[1:51:45] and all that are thine
[1:51:48] so god is saying
[1:51:50] this man is judging you
[1:51:56] abraham was the one in error if we were
[1:52:00] judging we would judge abraham
[1:52:03] if we were using our own intellect and
[1:52:05] our own sense of fairness and what's
[1:52:07] right and what's wrong we would judge
[1:52:09] abraham amen and it's not that god
[1:52:11] doesn't ever chastise his children god
[1:52:13] has no trouble correcting his children
[1:52:15] they always come to repentance
[1:52:18] but
[1:52:19] in our minds we would have said
[1:52:22] abraham you're guilty and you have to
[1:52:23] pay for this but in god's mind he says
[1:52:26] abimelech you're guilty and you're going
[1:52:28] to pay for this
[1:52:32] listen i i don't understand and god knew
[1:52:34] that he was innocent but it didn't
[1:52:35] matter he was touching god's elect he
[1:52:38] was touching that word
[1:52:40] made flesh and god come down to stop him
[1:52:42] from doing it because he was going to be
[1:52:44] cursed
[1:52:45] and then furthermore he says restore the
[1:52:48] man his wife and have him pray for you
[1:52:50] and if he if you don't and if he doesn't
[1:52:52] pray for you then you're gone you're
[1:52:54] finished
[1:52:56] it doesn't seem fair unless you back up
[1:52:59] and get the big picture of what god is
[1:53:01] doing and what the word is and what
[1:53:02] god's plan was
[1:53:04] let's go to verse 14.
[1:53:07] now look what happens
[1:53:09] now they have a dialogue he and abraham
[1:53:11] have a dialogue
[1:53:12] and abraham
[1:53:13] excuses himself and says because i told
[1:53:16] my wife that because you're fair they'll
[1:53:18] kill me to get you i i told her to tell
[1:53:21] people she was my
[1:53:22] sister and i told him that she was my
[1:53:24] brother and
[1:53:25] we are half brother and half sister
[1:53:30] not good enough
[1:53:32] so
[1:53:35] a beam elect they have this conversation
[1:53:36] but look at the next action of beam
[1:53:38] elect takes
[1:53:40] and the beam elect took sheep and oxen
[1:53:43] and men servants and manservant and
[1:53:46] woman servants and gave them unto
[1:53:47] abraham and restored him sarah his wife
[1:53:50] and the bible that said behold my land
[1:53:52] is before thee dwell where it pleaseth
[1:53:55] thee and unto sarah he said behold i
[1:53:57] have given thy brother a thousand pieces
[1:53:59] of silver behold he is to thee a
[1:54:01] covering of the eyes unto all that are
[1:54:03] with thee
[1:54:05] and with the other
[1:54:07] that thus
[1:54:08] she was reproved
[1:54:11] before abraham prayed for him
[1:54:14] what did abimelech do
[1:54:16] he blessed abraham
[1:54:18] he blessed him with sheep and oxens and
[1:54:20] men servants and maidservants he gave
[1:54:22] him a thousand pieces of silver amen for
[1:54:24] the restoration of sarah amen and he
[1:54:26] says this is my land go wherever you
[1:54:28] want in my land amen because the the
[1:54:31] word of god remains true who curses you
[1:54:33] is cursed who blesses you i will bless
[1:54:36] so obey me like now begins to bless
[1:54:39] abraham and then abraham says so verse
[1:54:42] 17 so abraham prayed unto god and god
[1:54:46] healed abimelech and his wife and his
[1:54:49] maidservants and they bear children for
[1:54:51] the lord had fast closed up all the
[1:54:53] wombs of the house of abimelech because
[1:54:55] of sarah abraham's wife
[1:54:57] so now abraham prays after he gets a
[1:55:00] blessing and he's blessed by this man he
[1:55:03] prays for him and god restores all to
[1:55:04] him and then he moves on amen and he
[1:55:07] moves on with all the blessings that
[1:55:09] abhinav had showered upon him amen and
[1:55:11] it ended up being salvation for
[1:55:13] abimelech to save him from the wrath of
[1:55:15] god that was upon
[1:55:16] him and you have to understand that that
[1:55:20] abraham was the one who brought the
[1:55:21] deception not a bema like he was
[1:55:23] innocent and when i read this story and
[1:55:25] i understand now amen the grand scheme
[1:55:28] of what god is doing and god with his
[1:55:31] great mystery plan has been unfolding it
[1:55:33] through time and it's just
[1:55:35] elohim materializing and god is holding
[1:55:38] people accountable for how they treat
[1:55:40] that and manifestation now i don't want
[1:55:43] to have a crabby day and be rough to the
[1:55:45] clerk at the store because i don't want
[1:55:47] her to be roughed back
[1:55:51] i don't want to cheat my neighbor amen
[1:55:53] because i don't want him to cheat me
[1:55:55] back
[1:55:57] i don't want amen i don't want to be
[1:56:00] hostile at work and be aggravated and
[1:56:02] intense because i don't want people to
[1:56:03] be hostile and tense back at me
[1:56:06] because god will forgive me my name's in
[1:56:09] the lamb's book of life he'll chastise
[1:56:11] me sure he'll whip me he'll correct me
[1:56:13] but i'm not going to be lost but what
[1:56:15] about these people that are coming in
[1:56:17] contact with the word made flesh amen i
[1:56:19] don't want to do what abraham did i want
[1:56:21] to live the life of christ
[1:56:24] and furthermore i want to go beyond that
[1:56:26] i want to so live the life of christ
[1:56:28] amen because he went about doing good to
[1:56:30] all
[1:56:32] amen and when i opened with the
[1:56:34] scripture it says amen we shall reap if
[1:56:37] we faint not amen as as thou have an
[1:56:39] opportunity to do good unto all men
[1:56:41] especially those in their household of
[1:56:42] faith
[1:56:43] why because i want to do good to them
[1:56:46] because i want them to do good to me
[1:56:49] i want to live a life like jesus lives
[1:56:51] serving others living for others
[1:56:52] manifesting the word shining the light i
[1:56:55] don't want to be irritable i don't want
[1:56:56] to be contemptible i don't want to be
[1:56:58] shady i don't want to be any of those
[1:56:59] things because i do not want somebody to
[1:57:02] be guilty of responding to me that way
[1:57:05] but i want to be loving amen i want to
[1:57:07] be just i want to be fair i want to be
[1:57:09] honest amen i want to shine the light i
[1:57:11] want the light to set on a candlestick
[1:57:13] for all the house to see so that all men
[1:57:15] will see the good works and glorify my
[1:57:17] father that's in heaven
[1:57:20] because when it comes down to the white
[1:57:22] throne judgment we're going to see some
[1:57:24] amazing things
[1:57:27] we will be seated in judgment with him
[1:57:29] we will see some amazing things friends
[1:57:32] at the white throne judgment
[1:57:34] and some of those that just loved you
[1:57:36] and they could explain why they loved
[1:57:37] you
[1:57:38] they could never receive the word you go
[1:57:41] to talk to them about the word and it
[1:57:42] just seemed like water off a duck's back
[1:57:44] they didn't reject it they didn't get
[1:57:45] hostile about it it just it was nothing
[1:57:47] to them
[1:57:49] don't get angry and don't reject them
[1:57:52] not everybody can receive it
[1:57:56] but for some reason they just loved you
[1:57:58] for no reason they just loved you
[1:58:01] and they seemed to be too good to you
[1:58:04] you've ever had somebody like that in
[1:58:06] your life
[1:58:08] well guess what they're going to receive
[1:58:10] a reward for that at the day of the
[1:58:11] white throne judgment and there's going
[1:58:13] to be a time when you're in that great
[1:58:15] city and the time beyond time amen when
[1:58:17] we're in the new heavens and new earth
[1:58:18] and that same friend is going to come
[1:58:20] into that city and look you up and
[1:58:22] you're going to have fellowship together
[1:58:24] and it's going to be a rejoicing time on
[1:58:26] that day because they don't have to know
[1:58:28] who you are they don't have to know what
[1:58:30] they're doing to you
[1:58:31] they're just being judged for what they
[1:58:33] do
[1:58:34] abimelech had no knowledge
[1:58:38] of what he was doing or who abraham was
[1:58:40] but it didn't stop the effect of the
[1:58:42] blessing
[1:58:46] in the in the message revelation chapter
[1:58:48] four part two
[1:58:51] it says now the first throne was in
[1:58:53] heaven judgment seat
[1:58:55] the second throne was in christ
[1:58:57] the third throne is in man
[1:59:00] now let me take this little thing that i
[1:59:02] got drawed here
[1:59:04] we're going to make i wish i had a
[1:59:05] blackboard that i could make it more
[1:59:07] sensible for you we're going to take and
[1:59:09] draw the quartz he's drawing the uh
[1:59:11] outer court the inner court and the holy
[1:59:13] of holies
[1:59:14] only make it round a ring or like this
[1:59:17] i believe like maybe would be best we're
[1:59:19] going to take and make the chords so
[1:59:21] he's drawing three circles to make the
[1:59:22] chords
[1:59:23] now what is man he's a triune being body
[1:59:25] soul and spirit how many knows that go
[1:59:28] watch god's approach watch his heart
[1:59:30] what is in his heart
[1:59:32] you remember my message god chose a
[1:59:33] man's heart for his control tower the
[1:59:35] devil chose his head for the control
[1:59:37] tower
[1:59:38] see he makes him see things look through
[1:59:40] his eyes god in his heart makes him
[1:59:42] believe things that he cannot see
[1:59:45] god is on his heart in the heart of man
[1:59:47] is the throne of god you get it man god
[1:59:50] made his throne
[1:59:52] in the heart of man
[1:59:54] when did his throne come into the heart
[1:59:55] of man at
[1:59:56] pentecost when he divided the spirit
[1:59:59] and brought it into mankind
[2:00:01] his throne became in the heart of man
[2:00:05] so that means when all these come to the
[2:00:07] white throne judgment it'll be the
[2:00:09] second time they stand before god's
[2:00:11] throne
[2:00:13] not the first time
[2:00:16] they didn't know it the first time but
[2:00:17] they'll know it the second time
[2:00:20] there's an opportunity out there the
[2:00:22] word expressed is always separation the
[2:00:25] word expressed it brings life to some
[2:00:28] and it brings death to others that's
[2:00:30] what the word expressed has done in
[2:00:31] every age that's the word expressed as
[2:00:33] doing today
[2:00:36] but i don't want to focus on the
[2:00:37] negative part i want to focus on the
[2:00:39] positive part
[2:00:41] the word expressed
[2:00:44] is opening a door of mercy
[2:00:47] for those that can receive it
[2:00:49] those that can just love the word
[2:00:51] expressed for whatever reason they love
[2:00:53] it
[2:00:54] not having a seed gene of god not having
[2:00:56] the capacity by grace to receive the
[2:00:58] word through faith
[2:01:00] but just the capacity
[2:01:03] to treat the manifested word right
[2:01:06] brother benham said that they receive
[2:01:07] eternal life solely
[2:01:10] based on being good and kind to the
[2:01:12] brethren
[2:01:14] i say thank you god
[2:01:17] and if god has
[2:01:18] chosen me to be the manifested word
[2:01:21] i want to be the clearest manifestation
[2:01:24] of the word i can ever be eternal
[2:01:26] destinations are depending on it friends
[2:01:30] not just not just for the sons and
[2:01:32] daughters of god but for all that that
[2:01:35] have their name in the lamb's book of
[2:01:37] life amen there's an opportunity because
[2:01:39] that name can be blotted out and what
[2:01:41] will blot it out when they come against
[2:01:43] the word made flesh
[2:01:47] god's throne is in the hearts of man
[2:01:48] god's throne is in you and i
[2:01:51] in your heart and my heart
[2:01:53] and people of this world are coming
[2:01:55] before the throne of god day in and day
[2:01:57] out and day in and day out and someday
[2:02:01] when they get to the white throne
[2:02:02] judgment and you're sitting on the
[2:02:03] throne they're going to realize i've
[2:02:05] been before this throne before
[2:02:09] i was before this throne when that
[2:02:10] throne was in that person sitting right
[2:02:12] there
[2:02:13] that man and that woman sitting right
[2:02:16] there i've stood before this throne
[2:02:18] before
[2:02:20] but now comes the time to receive the
[2:02:22] reward for what you did when you stood
[2:02:24] before that throne the first time
[2:02:28] i say let's live a clean life
[2:02:30] a clear life
[2:02:32] let's live the word and the word only
[2:02:35] i don't want to be guilty of causing
[2:02:37] somebody to reject just because i was
[2:02:39] nasty i don't want to be guilty amen of
[2:02:41] being hostile or irritable but i want to
[2:02:44] live the life of jesus christ and i want
[2:02:46] to live it clean and i want to live it
[2:02:48] pure and i want as much as i have
[2:02:49] opportunity to do good to do good to all
[2:02:52] men especially those of the household of
[2:02:54] faith
[2:02:55] because jesus when he was on this earth
[2:02:57] he did good unto all
[2:02:59] and delivered all of those that were
[2:03:01] possessed the devils
[2:03:03] not only for the redeemed
[2:03:05] but for all
[2:03:07] when brother branham was here he was
[2:03:09] rebuked because he he got his feelings
[2:03:11] hurt and wanted to pull back from the
[2:03:12] ministry and he minister he preaches
[2:03:14] this and standing in the gap amen and he
[2:03:17] they didn't hear the word and he got
[2:03:19] offended and he got upset and he pulled
[2:03:20] himself away from people
[2:03:23] and and god come and rebuked him he says
[2:03:25] i realized i let a lot of sick people
[2:03:28] lay
[2:03:29] he had a gift of healing it wasn't just
[2:03:32] for the elect but it was also for
[2:03:33] mankind
[2:03:35] his life wasn't only it was an
[2:03:37] expression of elohim it was an
[2:03:39] expression of god so that god could be
[2:03:41] expressed in this world so that the
[2:03:43] light could shine it wasn't only so that
[2:03:45] you can come to church and say we're all
[2:03:46] the bride and so that you would go out
[2:03:48] out these doors and shine the light of
[2:03:50] elohim elode him materializing the light
[2:03:53] and life and character and the nature of
[2:03:55] god on display in this world and that
[2:03:57] nature and life of god on display in
[2:03:59] this world is a throne of judgment amen
[2:04:02] and some will find mercy and some will
[2:04:04] find cursing
[2:04:07] but i said god let my life bring
[2:04:09] blessings to multitudes of people
[2:04:12] amen how
[2:04:13] how many do you want to see
[2:04:16] enter into eternal life at the white
[2:04:17] throne judgment
[2:04:19] do we have a burden for souls we have a
[2:04:21] burden for individuals or do we only
[2:04:23] have a burden to make more message
[2:04:25] believers
[2:04:27] [Music]
[2:04:28] i want all the believers i want to find
[2:04:30] every one of those last seed but that's
[2:04:32] not my only thing in life that's being
[2:04:34] accomplished i'm also manifesting elohim
[2:04:36] elohim is becoming tangible so that he
[2:04:38] can be felt
[2:04:41] and i want people to see him and i want
[2:04:43] people to feel him and i want people to
[2:04:45] love him
[2:04:48] i want this expression of almighty god
[2:04:51] amen to go forth in a way that people
[2:04:53] are drawn they're attracted amen they
[2:04:56] love the nature they love the character
[2:04:58] and they say there's just something
[2:04:59] about that man there's something about
[2:05:00] that woman amen it's not their genetics
[2:05:02] from mom and dad it's the life of jesus
[2:05:04] christ on the inside
[2:05:07] they may attribute it to you know when
[2:05:09] you walk by with your family amen and
[2:05:11] somebody sees a mom and a dad and little
[2:05:13] kids and dressed in holiness and
[2:05:15] treating each other right sitting in a
[2:05:17] meal i want somebody to say that's right
[2:05:23] i want them to say that's right
[2:05:25] i want to say that's the truth
[2:05:28] they may never open a bible in their
[2:05:30] life but i want them to see the
[2:05:31] expression and i want them to call it
[2:05:32] truth
[2:05:34] i want them to call it right
[2:05:37] i want to deal with people so fairly in
[2:05:39] my business i want to be so above
[2:05:41] reproach in the way that i deal with
[2:05:43] individuals never cheating never taking
[2:05:45] advantage always taking the lower road
[2:05:47] so that they can say that's a real man
[2:05:49] that's a that's the way people should
[2:05:50] act
[2:05:52] they don't recognize what are they doing
[2:05:53] they're giving honor and glory to my
[2:05:55] father because it's the life of my
[2:05:56] father that they're seeing
[2:05:58] it's not me it's him in me
[2:06:02] i want to live that life amen but people
[2:06:05] will love that life
[2:06:07] not my old life not my old nature i want
[2:06:09] that to die and stay dead and i want to
[2:06:12] crucify it every day
[2:06:14] so that just the life of christ will be
[2:06:16] expressed
[2:06:18] and people will come in contact with it
[2:06:20] and say there's something there i like
[2:06:23] oh they might think it's you and they
[2:06:25] might think it's your upbringing they
[2:06:26] might think
[2:06:27] you know they might think you got lucky
[2:06:29] and just got a good wife and you got
[2:06:30] lucky and your kids just end up behaving
[2:06:35] they don't know it's god
[2:06:37] but when they see it and they say it's
[2:06:38] right they're saying the right thing
[2:06:42] they could see that and curse it and say
[2:06:44] how can they do that and how can they
[2:06:46] how can they live that way won't they
[2:06:48] let those kids go free they're bringing
[2:06:50] a curse upon themselves
[2:06:53] but i want to live such a way that
[2:06:54] multitudes have an opportunity to say
[2:06:57] something right to do something good
[2:07:01] with me and my family we were we had
[2:07:03] young kids we had four or five of the
[2:07:05] young little kids they were all around
[2:07:07] us and we had went to
[2:07:09] i think we went to the indianapolis
[2:07:10] children's museum i think is where we
[2:07:12] went we were driving back from indiana
[2:07:14] and we stopped at a steak and shake
[2:07:16] i'm giving you way too many details but
[2:07:18] that's just the way
[2:07:20] we go in and eat and we sit down and eat
[2:07:22] normal we're not doing anything out of
[2:07:24] the normal we're doing what we always do
[2:07:26] amen we bow our heads and pray the kids
[2:07:28] are mannerly they ask for things we we
[2:07:30] order we're we're just interacting the
[2:07:33] way we always interact nothing unusual
[2:07:37] and when we go
[2:07:38] they ask for the bill the waitress says
[2:07:40] somebody already picked it up for you
[2:07:44] and i don't remember what she said
[2:07:45] something about
[2:07:47] they liked your family or so i can't
[2:07:48] remember exactly but it was something
[2:07:50] along those lines
[2:07:51] somebody repaid it for you i say whoever
[2:07:55] blesses you will be blessed
[2:07:57] what did they pay that bill for did they
[2:07:59] pay everybody's bill or was there
[2:08:01] something was there an expression of the
[2:08:03] word they saw amen that caused them to
[2:08:05] glorify and on to see your good works
[2:08:08] amen and glorify your father and say
[2:08:10] something's right about that i want to
[2:08:12] do something and i'll tell you what i
[2:08:14] can say on that day i was hungry and you
[2:08:16] fed me i don't know who it was i i tried
[2:08:19] to think back and who was it in the
[2:08:20] restaurant and their faces i have no
[2:08:22] idea who it was but god knows who it was
[2:08:25] friends
[2:08:26] and all we were doing was living a
[2:08:28] christian life and i say live the best
[2:08:30] christian life you can live surrender
[2:08:33] completely to god let him take full
[2:08:35] control of your life because on the day
[2:08:37] of judgment on the white throne judgment
[2:08:39] you might be pleasantly surprised at
[2:08:41] some surprises that are laying there
[2:08:45] and then you will be saying thank god
[2:08:48] thank god thank god thank god
[2:08:52] this message amen the the the people
[2:08:55] want to say the message is exclusive
[2:08:57] it's the most inclusive thing i've ever
[2:08:59] seen in my life
[2:09:02] i've never seen anything where god is so
[2:09:04] merciful amen and so loving and so kind
[2:09:07] that he will grant eternal life amen to
[2:09:09] individuals just because they treated
[2:09:11] his expression right in the day he was
[2:09:13] expressing himself
[2:09:15] everybody else would put those people to
[2:09:17] hell
[2:09:20] but not this message because this
[2:09:21] message is christ amen it's the very
[2:09:24] character and nature of god
[2:09:27] and it's explaining to us
[2:09:29] our mysterious and misunderstood life
[2:09:33] why do we walk the paths we walk why do
[2:09:36] we rub shoulders with the people we rub
[2:09:38] shoulders with why listen instead of
[2:09:41] dreading going to work tomorrow go to
[2:09:42] work with an opportunity for mercy amen
[2:09:45] an opportunity for life
[2:09:48] don't go to work in every situation you
[2:09:50] face no matter how difficult amen no
[2:09:53] matter how many people you have to get
[2:09:54] involved with and obstacles and things
[2:09:57] you know sometimes things break just so
[2:10:00] you call the right repairman
[2:10:02] or you go to the right garage or who
[2:10:04] knows what it is but we have to stop
[2:10:06] seeing ourselves in such a narrow vision
[2:10:08] and see ourselves the way god sees us as
[2:10:10] an expressed attribute of himself his
[2:10:13] word on display
[2:10:16] the judgment seat the throne of god is
[2:10:19] also a mercy seat amen and the throne of
[2:10:22] god is in the heart of men
[2:10:25] and every day judgments are taking place
[2:10:27] people are judging themselves
[2:10:30] and on the white throne judgment it will
[2:10:32] all be sorted out
[2:10:36] brother brennan says in the message the
[2:10:37] unveiling of god
[2:10:39] he says he died to reveal himself to us
[2:10:43] now let us die to self to reveal him to
[2:10:45] others
[2:10:46] let us die to the traditions and things
[2:10:48] to reveal him to other die to the
[2:10:50] denominations to reveal him to others
[2:10:54] he died to reveal himself to us i want
[2:10:56] to die to reveal him to the world
[2:10:59] whatever the world does they'll do and
[2:11:01] they'll be judged for it but i want to
[2:11:03] give a true
[2:11:05] true revelation of the word i want to
[2:11:07] give a true expression
[2:11:10] of my father
[2:11:12] i say god help us
[2:11:14] help us to be true lord
[2:11:17] help us to take up our cross daily
[2:11:20] to die to selfishness
[2:11:22] to die hey listen somebody cut you off
[2:11:24] in the road you start laying on the horn
[2:11:25] and waving your arms at them do you
[2:11:27] think they're having good thoughts about
[2:11:29] you
[2:11:33] and we feel justified in actions because
[2:11:35] of what they did listen
[2:11:37] remember abraham and abimelech in every
[2:11:39] situation you're going to remember
[2:11:41] abraham and be my leg
[2:11:43] don't cause it don't cast a stomach
[2:11:45] stone in that man's way don't do
[2:11:47] something that will harm them eternally
[2:11:49] i say let it go friends amen if they do
[2:11:52] you wrong let it go if they cheat you
[2:11:54] let it go if they call you all horrible
[2:11:56] names let it go
[2:12:00] it's going to matter there's going to be
[2:12:02] a time that it matters at the white
[2:12:04] throne judgment and i don't want to be
[2:12:06] sitting there knowing that i was the one
[2:12:08] who was pumping the brakes because he
[2:12:09] was too close behind me and i was
[2:12:10] getting irritated at him
[2:12:13] do you understand friends
[2:12:16] i want to live the way christ would live
[2:12:18] on this earth not the way chad lamb
[2:12:19] would live
[2:12:21] i don't want to be irritable and cranky
[2:12:23] and angry and hostile i just want the
[2:12:25] love of god to project out of me and i
[2:12:27] want the word to flow out of me and i
[2:12:29] want the light to shine and i don't want
[2:12:31] anything else to shine
[2:12:33] just the light
[2:12:35] if somebody wants to ride in my bumper
[2:12:37] let them ride
[2:12:39] praise god maybe i'm protecting them
[2:12:41] from an accident
[2:12:44] somebody wants to cut me off they needed
[2:12:46] to get there faster than i did let them
[2:12:47] go
[2:12:49] if somebody wants to cheat me out of my
[2:12:51] tent in my magazine
[2:12:56] what are you talking about brother chad
[2:12:58] come to brother branham's house have him
[2:13:00] sign papers and a guise in deception to
[2:13:03] steal his tent and to steal his magazine
[2:13:07] what did brother brahm do he signed the
[2:13:09] papers
[2:13:13] and when he was walking out the door
[2:13:16] and as he was walking out door by the
[2:13:17] room and said oh wait a minute brother
[2:13:20] say stop
[2:13:23] he says next time you're in town won't
[2:13:24] you preach for us
[2:13:27] why can't we live like that
[2:13:30] when brother branham was was at a a
[2:13:33] meeting they would have meetings where
[2:13:34] brother brennan was called to the
[2:13:35] meeting i mean just to advertise it to
[2:13:37] get his friends to come that's what he
[2:13:39] said
[2:13:40] one day he was there and they didn't
[2:13:41] like what he was going to preach and he
[2:13:43] was coming to the meeting
[2:13:44] and they held him in the back and they
[2:13:46] told the congregation that brother
[2:13:48] branham's not here today his brother's
[2:13:50] sick and he had to go
[2:13:52] it was partially true because his
[2:13:53] brother was sick but brother madam was
[2:13:55] going to go after he preached
[2:13:58] they brought deception and brother man
[2:13:59] was standing there he could step right
[2:14:01] out the door he was getting ready to

[2:14:05] somebody later asked him why didn't you
[2:14:06] do it he said oh i couldn't do that that
[2:14:07] would hurt that man's ministry
[2:14:13] most of us have been like i'd have been
[2:14:14] out there waving my arms and jumping up
[2:14:19] i don't want chad lamb to ruin a chance
[2:14:22] at eternal life i don't want my old
[2:14:24] carnal nature that came from my parents
[2:14:26] and my grandparents i don't want that
[2:14:28] thing to rule me i want to be ruled by
[2:14:30] the word of god and the word only i want
[2:14:32] to lay down my life and i want to
[2:14:33] surrender my life and i want to shine a
[2:14:35] clear light without any smut or smoke on
[2:14:38] the glass of my of my lantern
[2:14:40] i want to set it on a pole and i want
[2:14:42] everybody else to see my good work not
[2:14:44] mine but his and me
[2:14:47] that they would glorify my father which
[2:14:49] is in heaven and then glorifying my
[2:14:51] father which is in heaven saying that's
[2:14:52] right that's true that's the way you
[2:14:54] ought to live that's honest that's a
[2:14:55] good thing i want them to glorify my
[2:14:57] father and find themselves a blessing
[2:15:01] coming in their lives
[2:15:03] for the blessings of abraham have come
[2:15:04] from us
[2:15:05] the judgment is taking place all around
[2:15:08] us because we're the manifested word
[2:15:09] there's a separation going on and i said
[2:15:12] god i want as many as possible to come
[2:15:15] into eternal life
[2:15:17] this is a love of souls friends
[2:15:21] a love of souls to live your life in
[2:15:23] such a way you can attract the soul to
[2:15:25] the light of jesus christ
[2:15:27] but they didn't believe the message they
[2:15:28] may not have to believe the message you
[2:15:31] only have to believe the message if
[2:15:32] you're a predestinated seed
[2:15:35] but as long as you don't reject it you
[2:15:37] can still do service
[2:15:40] and find a reward
[2:15:42] let people do a service
[2:15:44] let them love you and let that be enough
[2:15:48] because if they're hungry they're going
[2:15:49] to keep coming
[2:15:50] and keep coming you don't have to worry
[2:15:52] about a seed once you give them a little
[2:15:53] light they'll come back for more once
[2:15:55] they get a little manner from heaven
[2:15:56] they'll ask you for more amen what we're

[2:20:30] i don't have a preaching gift i'm not an
[2:20:33] officer in the church i don't have this

[2:20:58] just live a christian life a pure clean
[2:21:00] christian life
[2:21:02] and at the white throne judgment you
[2:21:03] might find out what god was doing with

[2:21:09] expressing what you expressed i mean
[2:21:11] it's not the full life of god is not
