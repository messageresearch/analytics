========================================
but guess what you know what's going to happen to little Henry CU he's not already callous and he's not already tainted by the world and he doesn't have hypocrisy and he doesn't try to look good you know what's going to happen to him the minute he touches that and feels the pain he's going to run back to Mama run back to Daddy throw himself in their arms crying in pain and you know what Mama and Daddy's going to do they're going to have mercy and love and grace for little Henry he's not going to get a weapon he's not to get chastisement he's not going to be told I told you you know what he's going to do he's going to get ointment he's going to get uh he's going to get whatever can soothe whatever can Comfort whatever can take away the pain he's going to get kisses and he's going to get hugs and see if we would just stop being proud and arrogant and try to save face and but when we would just go and touch the stove or do whatever if we would just run back to God and throw ourselves in our arms and said God I've hurt myself again I've damaged myself I've hurt my family God would you save me would you forgive me would you cleanse me oh God have mercy on me God would you embrace me again would you would you tell me it's going to be okay once again and guess what Henry may hurt for a little while it may sting for a few days he may get a little blister he may have something go on like that but by the grace of God he'll know that Mama's commandment is love Daddy meant love and where do I find love after I failed right back at the first place I Found Love and got the Commandment in the first place because it's all God's love and grace and mercy his commandment and also his restoration his Mercy his grace and his forgiveness it's all his love amen for his children oh I wish we could be more like children not have to act like we didn't touch the stove on right we'll go over here and Sizzle our fingers and everybody sees the smoke coming off your hand that's the truth friends we can all tell when everything's disjointed and somebody's out of s you can see it we'll put our hand in our pocket and go and we're hurting like crazy but we don't want anybody to know what we just did try to hide it from others try to hide it from God right when what we need to do is say I just transgress the word of God and I hurt myself I need comfort I need love I need healing I need restoration where you going to find it if you don't get it from the body of Christ amen why can't we just come to Christ in his body and say I hurt myself again why can't we find love and mercy and compassion and Grace in God's provided way
