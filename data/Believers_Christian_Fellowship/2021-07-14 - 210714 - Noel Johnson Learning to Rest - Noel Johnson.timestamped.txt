[2:31] [Applause]
[2:34] we
[2:36] let's all stand this evening you are
[2:44] [Music]
[2:48] here
[2:54] [Music]
[2:58] in this place
[3:09] [Music]
[3:16] you
[3:18] [Music]
[3:27] you are here
[3:43] this place
[3:52] we are changed
[3:58] and you are here
[4:02] among us for we have
[4:14] [Music]
[4:17] in this place
[4:33] [Applause]
[4:36] [Music]
[4:40] me
[4:42] [Music]
[4:44] just raise your hands from this evening
[4:58] have your way in this
[5:03] place holy spirit comes
[5:14] [Music]
[5:19] i want to greet you all in the name of
[5:21] the lord jesus christ
[5:23] it's my privilege to be back here with
[5:25] you all
[5:26] coveted kind of shut everything down but
[5:28] it's gone and we're glad
[5:30] so while you're standing if you'd open
[5:33] your bibles to hebrews the fourth
[5:34] chapter
[5:35] read verses one through ten
[5:38] there is something that god's been
[5:40] dealing with me and so
[5:42] you're going to suffer to listen to that
[5:44] this evening
[5:46] but it's something that i think is
[5:48] necessary for the bride at this hour
[5:51] the subject is learning to rest
[5:54] coming to a place in god where nothing
[5:58] bothers us
[5:59] nothing things will challenge us that's
[6:02] for sure but
[6:03] but we never get upset we we never get
[6:06] discouraged we always just we
[6:08] focus on the end of the road and we just
[6:11] rest
[6:12] realizing what he's able to do so let's
[6:14] read hebrews 4 1-10
[6:17] it says let us therefore fear lest a
[6:20] promise being left us of entering into
[6:22] this
[6:22] his rest any of you should seem to come
[6:24] short of it
[6:25] for unto us was the gospel priests as
[6:27] well as unto them with the word preached
[6:29] did not profit them
[6:31] not being mixed with faith in them that
[6:33] heard it
[6:34] for we which have believed to enter into
[6:37] rest as he said as i have sworn in my
[6:39] wrath if they shall enter into my rest
[6:41] although the works were finished from
[6:42] the foundation of the world
[6:44] for he spake in a certain place of the
[6:46] seventh day on this wise
[6:48] and god did rest the seventh day from
[6:50] all his works
[6:51] and in this place again if they shall
[6:53] enter into my rest
[6:55] seeing therefore remaineth that some
[6:57] must enter therein and they to whom it
[6:59] was first preached enter not in
[7:01] because of unbelief again he limited a
[7:03] certain day saying
[7:05] in david today to song on time as it is
[7:07] said today if you will hear his voice
[7:10] harden out your hearts for if jesus had
[7:12] given them rest and would he not
[7:14] afterward have spoken of another day
[7:17] there remaineth therefore a rest to the
[7:18] people of god
[7:20] for he that has entered into his rest he
[7:22] also has ceased from his own works
[7:24] as god did from his let's pray
[7:28] our most gracious and loving heavenly
[7:30] father
[7:31] it is always our privilege to gather
[7:34] ourselves together one with another and
[7:36] and then lord to be able to sit at your
[7:38] feet and just
[7:40] feed upon the word that you've prepared
[7:42] for us for this evening
[7:44] you've chosen lord to speak through man
[7:45] and has fallen my lot lord to stand
[7:47] before the purchase of your blood
[7:50] and lord that's an awesome
[7:51] responsibility
[7:53] so lord let it not be my words let it
[7:55] not be my thoughts
[7:57] the lord you use me this evening as i
[7:59] lay myself aside
[8:01] tired my mind guide my words and lord
[8:04] let what is spoken be from you
[8:06] the lord this i'm asking in the name of
[8:08] the lord jesus christ
[8:10] amen you can be seated
[8:15] brother branham and he swore by himself
[8:17] he makes this statement concerning jesus
[8:19] christ
[8:21] he said jesus christ no matter if he was
[8:23] in a storm
[8:24] and the gale was knocking the boat about
[8:26] from side to side
[8:28] from one side to the other or he was
[8:30] standing in the mess
[8:31] in the face of a mess of demons if he
[8:33] was hanging anywhere
[8:35] it never moved him he just walked right
[8:38] along
[8:38] just as calm and as quiet as he could be
[8:41] why
[8:42] he was simply unconscious of fear of
[8:45] anything around him
[8:46] that's right whether it's going to
[8:48] happen or whether it wasn't going to
[8:50] happen
[8:50] he knowed it was going to happen because
[8:52] god had said so he didn't say oh i
[8:54] wonder if i prayed through i wonder if i
[8:56] fasted
[8:57] long enough i wonder if this he just
[8:59] walked right along on
[9:01] unconscious that's right he believed
[9:03] what god
[9:04] was said was true the words must be
[9:07] fulfilled and he know that his life was
[9:09] to fulfill them
[9:10] that's right when we when we look at
[9:14] this idea of rest
[9:17] it talked about here when we were
[9:18] reading in hebrews it talks about having
[9:21] faith
[9:22] and without faith it's impossible to
[9:24] please god but without faith it's
[9:26] impossible to rest
[9:28] because rest produces a trust
[9:31] well actually a trust produces a faith
[9:34] and then when we get to the place we can
[9:36] trust him
[9:37] then we can relax then we can rest
[9:40] and this is what god's been trying to
[9:43] try and trying to teach me i guess
[9:44] if you will over the last couple of
[9:46] years but we when we when we when we
[9:49] look ahead and we begin to to look at
[9:51] the
[9:51] at the idea of faith because faith to me
[9:53] now means something totally different
[9:55] than what it did
[9:56] even two three years ago faith is not
[9:59] striving to believe for something
[10:02] no faith is a way of life faith is
[10:05] entering into a relationship with god
[10:08] in which you take your total trust and
[10:10] you put it in him
[10:12] and ask him to guide your life and once
[10:16] you take your hand and you place your
[10:17] hand in his
[10:19] from that point on you trust that he
[10:21] will lead you
[10:22] he trusts that you will guide you we
[10:24] were over we're
[10:25] staying at where i guess that was maybe
[10:28] at the youth camp
[10:29] we had this one child and he was playing
[10:32] like all children do he was probably
[10:34] three maybe four at the most i guess
[10:36] and he slipped and fell what's the first
[10:38] thing he did
[10:40] he ran to daddy he ran to his father and
[10:43] his father picked him up and picked him
[10:44] up and said oh it's all right son it's
[10:46] all right
[10:47] you know and he began to console the
[10:48] child and the child whimpered a little
[10:50] bit and after a while
[10:51] put the child down he ran off and
[10:53] started playing again
[10:55] but he knew that if he could get to
[10:57] father he knew everything was going to
[10:59] be fine
[11:00] he knew father was there to guard him he
[11:02] knew the father was there to protect him
[11:04] and so that's where he ran but see where
[11:07] do we
[11:08] run when something happens in our life
[11:10] where do we run
[11:12] we read and there's a there's a there's
[11:14] uh brother branham
[11:16] in a in the upon the obama of gilead
[11:19] he makes an interesting statement here
[11:21] which i thought was which meant a lot to
[11:23] me when i read it
[11:24] he said one thing that we have to move
[11:26] up to now is supreme is a supreme faith
[11:29] to that what we have had something that
[11:32] he says you cannot have that faith until
[11:34] you know perfectly what you're doing
[11:36] when you understand like you he says you
[11:38] say well i'm going to go home
[11:40] i'm going to go out and start the car he
[11:42] said that's all an act of faith
[11:44] tomorrow i will meet you at a certain
[11:46] place it's all an act of faith
[11:48] it's because you have just done it so
[11:50] much it's become a regular routine with
[11:53] you
[11:54] well that's the way things are with god
[11:56] after you have trusted him
[11:58] and watched him do so many things till
[12:00] it becomes just like a regular routine
[12:03] and that's the condition i think the
[12:04] church will be in just before the coming
[12:06] of the lord
[12:07] so the rapture will just go right on
[12:09] that way it'll be a regular routine of
[12:11] following the scriptures
[12:13] and the plan of god but see when it
[12:15] talks about here it talks about
[12:17] arresting
[12:18] it talks about coming to the place in
[12:20] your life that you have walked with god
[12:23] so much until it's just a regular
[12:25] routine
[12:26] with you um it was a couple of years ago
[12:30] i
[12:31] brother or paul he makes in this thing
[12:33] he says the just shall live by faith
[12:35] and i okay but then the reference goes
[12:38] back to havoc two and four
[12:40] and so i i took the book of havoc it's
[12:42] only three chapters it
[12:43] wasn't exact you know it's not a big big
[12:45] book but at all
[12:47] but have a cook lived in the time in
[12:49] which in which
[12:51] the assyrian army was going to come and
[12:53] invade and
[12:54] invade judah israel had already fallen i
[12:58] think about a hundred years prior to
[12:59] this point in time
[13:01] god had taken habakkuk and he showed him
[13:03] all the sins of the people of the
[13:04] priests and all the things going on
[13:06] his righteous indignation rose up within
[13:09] himself and god why don't you bring
[13:10] judgment why don't you do something why
[13:12] don't you condemn
[13:13] these people and god says okay i'm gonna
[13:15] bring the chaldeans in
[13:17] and we're gonna and i'll judge them
[13:20] and have a cook had second thoughts
[13:23] because
[13:24] the the chaldeans were the assyrians he
[13:26] says they weren't nice people
[13:28] they killed because they enjoy killing
[13:31] they like to take people and they like
[13:33] to make them suffer
[13:34] and have a cook began to go in his mind
[13:37] he says if these people come and invade
[13:39] my country what will happen to me
[13:42] will i be able to sustain this will i be
[13:44] able to survive the onslaught that is
[13:46] coming
[13:47] and i look at the life we're living
[13:49] around here now
[13:51] we don't really know what's coming all i
[13:54] know is it's going to get worse
[13:56] i don't like our president i'll say that
[13:58] up front
[13:59] but god put him there because this
[14:01] nation must
[14:03] fall all the things going on around us
[14:06] in our in our government
[14:07] is to make this this nation fall make it
[14:10] to falter
[14:11] make it to the place where the the the
[14:14] the debt
[14:14] creates the point where there is no way
[14:16] to sustain there's no way to even pay on
[14:18] the
[14:18] the interest on the debt you look at
[14:20] what's going on on the west coast
[14:22] and they're having a severe drought it's
[14:24] so bad that they're thinking of shutting
[14:25] down some of the hydroelectric plants
[14:27] because there's hardly enough water to
[14:29] be able to run them
[14:30] right now they're having fires all over
[14:32] in the west coast
[14:34] and and then we look at the east coast
[14:37] we have massive floodings
[14:39] we have places new york city they have
[14:40] the problem with the subway because they
[14:42] couldn't get to the train because
[14:43] they had to wade way steep in water just
[14:45] to be able to get to the tracks
[14:47] and you go and you look at the tornadoes
[14:49] and you look at the and they have
[14:51] right now they have a hurricane or just
[14:53] they just had one
[14:54] that's the earliest one on record for
[14:56] for for a number of years
[14:59] why all of these things coming because
[15:02] our nation is under judgment
[15:05] the only thing preventing the judgment
[15:07] of god is the fact we are still here
[15:09] when we leave what you see around us
[15:12] going on all the
[15:13] the lawlessness the murders the rapes
[15:15] and the stuff going on in the big cities
[15:17] all of a sudden that'll be child's play
[15:20] compared to what happens when
[15:21] when all of a sudden god takes us out of
[15:23] here but we're seeing the beginnings
[15:26] of all of all of this but what happens
[15:29] to us
[15:30] i know i i in india when the covet hit i
[15:33] preached a sermon to them or something
[15:34] close to the
[15:36] about havoc i says where do you put your
[15:39] trust what are you trusting in
[15:41] when all of a sudden if you have nothing
[15:43] and there was a point in time in india
[15:44] where really they had nothing
[15:46] i told brother freddie the brother i
[15:48] work with i says take the money that's
[15:50] in the kitty
[15:51] make sure that people have food go out
[15:53] into the villages buy them their food
[15:55] get them the rice get them whatever they
[15:56] need to sustain them
[15:58] during this period of time in the in
[16:00] their lives because when india shut in
[16:02] send india down in one night they shut
[16:05] down the airlines they shut down the
[16:06] taxi service they shut down the buses
[16:08] and they shut down the train
[16:09] if a guy was a hundred miles from home
[16:11] he had to walk it just to get home
[16:13] there was no other means of
[16:14] transportation and
[16:17] what are you going to do what are you
[16:19] going to do but here again
[16:21] coming back to where we are what are we
[16:22] going to do tomorrow
[16:24] all of a sudden because coveted what did
[16:26] they do they shut us down
[16:28] they said the businesses down they said
[16:30] they made it to the hospitals
[16:32] yeah my wife was i think she was sick
[16:36] and anyway we were thinking well if they
[16:37] take her to the hospital that's the last
[16:39] i'll see her
[16:40] because they wouldn't let anybody go in
[16:42] with her we had a
[16:44] brother in our church he caught coven
[16:46] and he was having trouble breathing and
[16:48] his wife looked at him and says you're
[16:49] not breathing
[16:50] well he says no i'm having struggled
[16:52] it's hard for me to breathe
[16:53] she says should i take you to the
[16:55] hospital he said no he says if you take
[16:57] me there he says the only thing you'll
[16:58] see maybe is a black bag coming out on
[17:00] the back
[17:01] he says i have to die let me die at home
[17:04] but then the prayer
[17:05] requests went out for the people in the
[17:07] church and all and everybody began to
[17:08] pray they lifted them up before god
[17:11] god spit god spared him and yeah it took
[17:15] him a month to be able to get his
[17:16] strength back and even now he
[17:18] he still suffers some from that we had a
[17:21] brother who translates for me in india
[17:23] he came down with covid
[17:25] and they put him in intensive care he
[17:27] was there for over for about a month i
[17:28] think he said
[17:30] and intensive care is not like you have
[17:32] here or it's a single room
[17:34] no it's it's like the vest of you out
[17:36] there where you you pack
[17:37] 40 beds out there and and everybody just
[17:39] kind of lays right next to each other
[17:42] um and and he would get up in the
[17:44] morning and
[17:45] and uh yeah they would be wheeling four
[17:46] or five people out to go ahead and
[17:48] cremate them because they had died that
[17:50] evening and they reel half a dozen more
[17:52] in
[17:52] and then every day he saw people being
[17:54] wheeled out because they had died
[17:56] and the doctor came to him and looked at
[17:58] his chart and looked at the lab results
[18:00] and he wondered
[18:01] why are you still alive he said you
[18:04] should be dead
[18:05] and later on when they finally released
[18:07] him he says you realize it's only the
[18:09] prayers of the people that
[18:11] only the prayers of the people that have
[18:13] sustained you during this time
[18:15] so even the hindu doctor had to had to
[18:18] acknowledge the fact
[18:19] god was the one that kept him alive but
[18:22] we come in here
[18:23] in this book in habakkuk because havoc
[18:25] here again he was concerned about
[18:26] himself
[18:27] and god in habakkuk 2 and 4 makes this
[18:29] interesting statement
[18:31] he says behold his soul which is lifted
[18:33] up is not upright in him
[18:35] but the just shall live by his faith
[18:38] and i studied that because it to me it
[18:40] was interesting the way that it was
[18:42] worded
[18:43] and it says in the soul that is lifted
[18:45] up i was looking that up
[18:48] i guess it was yesterday because i
[18:49] really wanted to get a clear
[18:50] understanding
[18:52] he said he whose soul is lift he who
[18:55] in he whose soul is he whose soul is not
[18:58] right in him or lifted up
[19:00] places himself in a fortress or a tower
[19:02] to set himself on high
[19:04] they are away from the enemy and does
[19:05] not return to god nor seek deliverance
[19:08] from him
[19:09] in other words i can do it myself i do
[19:12] not
[19:12] need your help and that's the attitude
[19:15] of too many people
[19:16] well i can do this i can do this i'm
[19:19] trained how to do this i know how to
[19:22] no offense to you guys that are
[19:23] mechanics i know where to put the gas in
[19:25] and after that i let take it to the to
[19:27] the dealership and you know they they
[19:29] i never even looked at my engine for the
[19:31] first few months
[19:33] i'm assuming there was one in there
[19:34] because the car ran
[19:36] but but here again sometimes we come to
[19:39] the place where i can do this i'm
[19:41] trained to do this
[19:42] but we have a brother in our church mike
[19:44] orders and i think he'll mind me
[19:46] mentioning this
[19:47] but he he was in charge of a substation
[19:50] up in
[19:50] in our area and he would all of a sudden
[19:53] he would get a call and they would say
[19:55] hey there's something wrong
[19:56] something wrong with one of the lines or
[19:58] something wrong with one of the
[19:59] transformers or whatever they have
[20:00] in in there and he would go in there and
[20:02] he would look and he would look and he
[20:04] would
[20:04] read all the gauges and he would look at
[20:06] this and he says lord
[20:08] i don't know what's wrong there's
[20:10] something definitely wrong but
[20:12] i really don't know what it is lord will
[20:14] you show me
[20:16] and god did then he would go over and he
[20:19] would call up the lady who
[20:20] handles something else in a different
[20:22] place and says we need to shut down this
[20:24] line
[20:24] but that'll shut down electricity for 10
[20:26] 000 people he says i really don't care
[20:29] shut it down so i can fix this and i
[20:32] listen to a testimony when i was a
[20:34] brother for the jeff coats
[20:35] the guy works at uh at the airport there
[20:39] in i think it's it's columbus i think it
[20:41] is
[20:43] and they were having problems with one
[20:44] of their computers and they could not
[20:46] figure they tried this and tried that
[20:48] and tried this and tried that
[20:50] and and he said you know and he just
[20:52] happened to walk by where
[20:53] all the ground wires were connected he
[20:56] bumped one and it just popped right out
[20:58] that ground wire for that computer was
[21:01] not connected
[21:02] they put the wire in there they sensed
[21:04] it back down the computer ran
[21:06] fine but here it's god doing and he had
[21:09] to acknowledge
[21:10] because none of them could figure out
[21:12] with all their brain power and all of
[21:13] their training and all their phds and
[21:15] whatever else they had
[21:16] they could not come to the understanding
[21:18] this is what is wrong the ground wire is
[21:20] loose
[21:21] and some of them had even checked it but
[21:22] obviously they didn't check the right
[21:24] one
[21:25] but here again if you come to the place
[21:27] in your life so i can do this myself
[21:30] that's what you've come to in this
[21:31] command i i can do this
[21:34] god i don't need your help and whenever
[21:36] you get to the place where you say god i
[21:38] don't need your help he just backs off
[21:39] and says go
[21:40] okay go for it but it talks about he if
[21:43] it talks about
[21:44] but the just shall live by his faith and
[21:47] this is a real interesting statement
[21:50] because it talks about a man that has a
[21:52] total reliance
[21:53] on god it's not just believing for
[21:56] something
[21:57] but this is an actual way of life where
[22:00] the creature is totally dependent upon
[22:02] the creator
[22:03] we have a little dog at home and when he
[22:06] sees the bottom of his bowl he comes and
[22:08] he nudges us
[22:09] and says hey my bowl is empty even
[22:11] though it had food in it still he says
[22:13] fill it up come on fill it up
[22:17] he relies on us because we have the food
[22:20] he doesn't have any access to it unless
[22:22] we provide it for him
[22:24] but i mean here there's a total reliance
[22:26] upon us
[22:27] to feed him but now we have to take and
[22:30] transfer that between us and between god
[22:33] do we come to the place where we have a
[22:34] total reliance upon him
[22:37] how many got up this morning
[22:40] why because god got you
[22:44] up there's no reason you had to get up
[22:49] you could have died last night
[22:52] you know i mean that that's assembled
[22:55] how many ate today
[22:57] because god provided it how do you
[23:00] you guys have jobs how why do you have
[23:02] jobs because god provided it
[23:05] if we begin to understand it's god doing
[23:08] for us
[23:09] it's god supplying our needs where
[23:11] really the reliance we have to have is
[23:13] on god
[23:14] so when we get up in the morning we say
[23:16] oh god thank you you've given me another
[23:18] day
[23:18] lord let me use this day to worship you
[23:20] lord let me use this day to praise you
[23:22] lord let me use this day to lift you up
[23:24] and exalt your name let others see
[23:26] christ in me
[23:27] and when as we go about our daily life
[23:30] um we last year we couldn't go anywhere
[23:35] and so we had 15 years we'd been in our
[23:37] house and we managed to keep the grass
[23:39] so you could actually find the house
[23:41] but i we figured it's time to actually
[23:43] do some yard work
[23:44] and so i went ahead and for for all
[23:46] summer long i mean they kept lows open
[23:48] and i used them quite a bit this summer
[23:52] last summer but it was but now
[23:56] i like to water my yard it takes me
[23:59] three hours sometimes
[24:00] four and say oh that's a waste of time
[24:03] no it's not
[24:04] because it slows my life down such that
[24:07] i can go and i can look at the beauty of
[24:09] the flowers we put in last year
[24:11] i can sit there and listen to the birds
[24:13] we're singing i can sit there and watch
[24:15] the squirrels they run here and as they
[24:16] run there and as they do their daily
[24:18] thing
[24:18] i can watch the little rabbits as they
[24:20] scurry across the path and i can
[24:22] i can i can begin to see the nature i
[24:25] can begin to see the creation which god
[24:27] himself has made
[24:29] i prayed once i said lord slow my life
[24:32] down so that i could i can observe you
[24:35] t where you can teach me something about
[24:37] the surrounding
[24:38] thing and we were driving i think it was
[24:40] in arizona
[24:42] and we're going through a valley down
[24:44] there
[24:45] and god and god kind of spoke to me says
[24:47] look around
[24:49] and i said yeah there's trees there's
[24:51] grass there's flowers there's all this
[24:53] beauty
[24:54] and he said where would you rather be
[24:56] would you like to be on the mountain
[24:57] where there's no grass where there's no
[24:58] trees where there's nothing
[25:00] or would you like to be down the valley
[25:02] where there's water and there's green
[25:03] grass
[25:04] and you can rest underneath the green
[25:06] trees and you can sit there by the
[25:07] watering brook
[25:08] which where would you rather be well
[25:12] some people think valleys are bad things
[25:14] to go through
[25:16] uh they may not all be that bad because
[25:19] that's a place you can rest it's a place
[25:21] you can relax it's a place you can
[25:22] actually enjoy
[25:23] some of the things which god has given
[25:26] you know when we take and we we begin to
[25:29] look at faith
[25:31] and then we begin to go into hebrews the
[25:32] 11th chapter we begin to read all these
[25:35] people
[25:35] abraham and and and isaac and jacob and
[25:38] all the other stories of the people that
[25:40] are in there
[25:42] we read them as stories they had to live
[25:46] it
[25:48] it wasn't a story to them they didn't
[25:50] have a bible
[25:51] they did not have anything to reference
[25:53] them
[25:54] they did not have anybody they could
[25:56] consult with
[25:57] god's god in his own in his sovereignty
[26:00] he began he approached
[26:01] abraham and he began to talk to him and
[26:03] i said abraham
[26:04] i want you to leave your family i want
[26:06] to leave everything behind i want you to
[26:08] go into a sit to a country that i'm
[26:09] going to show you
[26:11] and abra but he didn't tell him where
[26:14] but oh but this was the beginning of
[26:16] abraham's relationship
[26:18] with god his father tote sojourned up to
[26:22] a place called hair herron i think it
[26:23] was
[26:24] and his father finally died and then and
[26:26] then abraham and lot journeyed out into
[26:28] palestine
[26:30] but palestine when he got in there all
[26:31] of a sudden god said this is the land
[26:33] i'm going to give you and it was during
[26:35] a drought
[26:37] and abraham says this land
[26:41] so he journeyed on to egypt he journeyed
[26:44] on where he could
[26:45] you know egypt is a type of the flesh
[26:47] egypt is a type of you rely upon
[26:49] yourself
[26:50] and so he journeyed down into there and
[26:52] and but god
[26:53] created circumstances in his life which
[26:56] drove him back
[26:57] into palestine and then from that point
[27:00] on that's where he resided
[27:02] but god also told him he says until you
[27:04] separate from your brother or
[27:06] your from lot he says i can't bless you
[27:10] and so they were having and here again
[27:12] god created the disturbance between
[27:14] between abraham's uh flock of herdsmen
[27:18] and and
[27:19] and lots herdsmen and so all of a sudden
[27:21] they had this contention going
[27:23] going between them and abraham says hey
[27:24] look at we don't need to fight there's
[27:26] plenty of land out here
[27:28] you go to the right i'll go to the left
[27:29] you take the north i'll take the south
[27:31] let's not fight so what did this lot do
[27:34] he looked down into the sodom
[27:36] it was well watered it was easy living
[27:39] abraham had to stay up in the mountains
[27:41] up in the on the hill country where
[27:43] it was harder i mean there was water
[27:46] there were springs and stuff like that
[27:47] but you had to move your flocks and
[27:49] stuff like that from point to point to
[27:50] keep them watered
[27:51] and to be able to grow your crops but
[27:54] lots
[27:54] lot chose the easy road but also that
[27:58] brought his destruction
[28:00] abraham was there in abrah and and and
[28:02] and during all of this time
[28:05] god and abraham was developing a
[28:07] relationship
[28:08] where all of a sudden abraham came to
[28:11] god one day and he says look i'm getting
[28:13] old
[28:14] you said my children are going to
[28:15] inherit this but i don't have any
[28:17] children
[28:19] and the only one they would inherit
[28:20] would would would be eliezer
[28:22] my servant and god says no it's going to
[28:25] come through your wife sarah
[28:26] he said well okay how will i know this
[28:29] so god says i'll tell you what we're
[28:31] going to do i says do what you normally
[28:32] would do with
[28:33] with your countrymen when you make us
[28:35] when you make a covenant
[28:36] he said go and take an animal kill the
[28:38] animal take some other animals and put
[28:40] them in there
[28:41] and these and normally speaking one
[28:43] would sit in one half of the carcass one
[28:45] would sit on the other half of the
[28:46] carcass and they would make an agreement
[28:48] the agreement being that if you don't
[28:50] fulfill your part of the agreement
[28:51] you will become like the sacrifice you
[28:54] will die
[28:55] and so what happened was abraham sat
[28:58] there
[28:59] and then all of a sudden a light came
[29:00] through i don't have it in my notes so
[29:02] i'm kind of going by memory
[29:03] but a light came through there and and
[29:06] god was telling to abraham really you
[29:07] should go to hell
[29:09] but he says i'm going to give you the
[29:10] land i'm going to provide for you i am
[29:12] making a covenant with you
[29:14] and and i will keep that covenant i will
[29:16] see to it that you're blessed
[29:18] and so the god so that there was an
[29:20] establishment that was there
[29:22] but here again it had to come a
[29:23] relationship had had to be established
[29:25] between abraham and between god
[29:28] to the place where abraham could rest
[29:31] and when all of a sudden god told eight
[29:33] god told abraham take your newborn take
[29:35] your son
[29:36] take him up on the mountain and
[29:37] sacrifice him it had come to their
[29:39] relationship at that point in time
[29:41] where abraham was willing to take his
[29:43] son take him up unto the mountain and
[29:45] offer him as a sacrifice
[29:47] he believed that even if he was reduced
[29:49] to ashes
[29:51] god would restore him completely and
[29:53] they could go back down the mountain and
[29:54] return
[29:55] that is the relationship which god and
[29:57] abraham had
[29:58] had come to in in in the relationship
[30:01] between the two of them
[30:03] but see this is where we have to come
[30:06] sometimes oh things are being difficult
[30:08] here so yeah what do we do we head for
[30:10] egypt
[30:11] oh yeah i know how to do this i know how
[30:13] to do that i can take care of myself
[30:15] and so god creates circumstances to
[30:17] drive you out of that situation
[30:19] and to drive you back into a
[30:21] relationship with him where no longer
[30:23] will you rely upon yourself but you rely
[30:25] upon
[30:25] upon god we go and we look at another
[30:28] one's called david
[30:30] david was out there he was minding his
[30:32] own business taking care of the sheep
[30:34] and a lion came in and grabbed one of
[30:36] the sheep well
[30:38] um i don't like chasing after animals
[30:40] especially when they're bigger than i am
[30:42] but david ran after that he took his
[30:44] sling he killed the lion
[30:47] he rescued the lamb i don't know how
[30:50] much longer but all of a sudden the bear
[30:52] came in and did the same thing and so
[30:53] david went out there
[30:54] and he killed the bear why did he have
[30:57] to go through that
[30:59] he had to come to the place of his trust
[31:01] in god
[31:02] so when it came to goliath david would
[31:05] know that god had the ability to sustain
[31:07] him god had the ability to deliver him
[31:10] so that was a trial in david's life but
[31:12] see we go through trials in ourselves
[31:14] we get sickness comes upon us what do we
[31:17] do we have to learn to trust in god
[31:19] we have other circumstances arise in our
[31:21] lives what do we do we have to learn to
[31:23] trust in god
[31:24] and over time those circumstances and
[31:27] our interaction with god
[31:28] should bring us to the place where we
[31:30] learn to rest in him
[31:33] david was sitting there minding his
[31:35] business and taking care of the sheep
[31:37] one of the servants came out today and
[31:39] said hey your dad wants to see you need
[31:41] to head home
[31:42] so david says well okay so he meanders
[31:45] on home and
[31:46] and he says he opens the door there's
[31:48] this funny old man with his horn of oil
[31:50] and pops the cork i think of the cork
[31:52] takes it off and dumps his oil on top of
[31:54] david and says here
[31:56] the next king of israel david says huh
[32:01] and turned right around went back to
[32:03] feeding taking care of the sheep
[32:05] but then what happened all of a sudden
[32:07] god put an evil spirit upon saul
[32:09] and then and then somebody says hey do
[32:11] you know some of you can play some music
[32:12] to kind of quiet me down well yeah we
[32:14] hear there's this kid he knows how to
[32:15] play flutes and head of stringed
[32:17] instruments and that kind of stuff
[32:19] well go get him so all of a sudden david
[32:22] was brought before saul and
[32:23] he began to play music and stuff like
[32:25] that but then he could observe what was
[32:27] going
[32:28] on within the court he could begin to
[32:29] observe how do you rule a nation how do
[32:31] you have to govern how do you do this
[32:33] and the other
[32:34] it was the beginning of his education
[32:37] and then all of a sudden a war with the
[32:39] philistines rose up david was sent home
[32:41] back to the shape his brothers went down
[32:44] to the down to the valley and they began
[32:45] to fight with the philistine
[32:47] and his dad was concerned about his
[32:49] brothers and says hey why don't you go
[32:51] and see how it's going
[32:52] see how your brothers are doing and so
[32:55] david said well
[32:56] okay so he went there and all of a
[32:58] sudden this big man
[32:59] stands up there and makes his boats you
[33:01] one of you come out there
[33:02] you kill me he says and he says all of
[33:05] us will become your servants but if i
[33:06] kill you then you all have to become our
[33:08] servants and
[33:10] david listen to that he said who's this
[33:13] uncircumcised philistine
[33:15] he doesn't trust in the god that i know
[33:18] he doesn't trust in the god that
[33:19] delivered the lion and the bear into my
[33:21] hands
[33:22] he doesn't trust in the same god that
[33:23] feeds us and supplies our needs he
[33:25] doesn't trust in that god no he relies
[33:27] upon himself
[33:29] so david went before saul and says i can
[33:31] take care of this guy
[33:33] and saul looked at him and said well
[33:34] you're kind of a young man i don't i
[33:36] don't know if you should be doing this
[33:38] tried to put all of his metal armor and
[33:41] stuff on him well
[33:42] david was a short man saul was tall so
[33:44] he looked like a banny rooster i think
[33:46] brother bannon
[33:46] talked about he said i don't know what
[33:48] this stuff does
[33:50] he said let me go with what i know so he
[33:52] went he got some
[33:54] stones put him in the slate put him in a
[33:56] little pouch that he carries with him
[33:57] and then when when goliath got up there
[33:59] and made his big boats and david all of
[34:01] a sudden he ran
[34:02] towards goliath and goliath says ah i'm
[34:05] going to take and feed you to the birds
[34:07] and david says no he says i'm going to
[34:09] take your head off
[34:11] and as he ran toward there he picked up
[34:13] a stone he put in this thing and swirled
[34:14] around and let it go
[34:16] god directed that stone to make that
[34:19] stone go
[34:20] and penetrate where it had to penetrate
[34:22] and and goliath was knocked over
[34:24] and then then david took the goliath
[34:27] sword took it out of its teeth
[34:28] and cut elias head off
[34:31] but he had to be trained there had to
[34:34] come a place in his life
[34:36] where he had such a relationship with
[34:38] god that he could trust
[34:40] where he could rest and rest is based
[34:43] upon this trust
[34:45] you know you know and here again when we
[34:47] come and we look at
[34:49] i look at brother branham's life when
[34:52] brother branham was born he was a
[34:54] prophet
[34:55] he was born to be a prophet there was a
[34:57] gift placed in him
[34:59] angel would talk to him when i think it
[35:00] was a couple three years old or
[35:02] something like that and began to warn
[35:03] him tell him about some things
[35:06] but david but brother branham didn't
[35:08] understand any of this
[35:10] and and he was a renegade i mean he
[35:12] carried a sidearm and he was going to
[35:14] shoot some kids and to beat up on him
[35:15] and then he was going to take the one
[35:17] that killed his dog and him
[35:19] if he had if his dad hadn't stopped him
[35:21] he probably would have gone and killed
[35:22] that man
[35:23] but here again then god began to deal
[35:26] with with brother branham and says you
[35:27] have to accept me
[35:29] you have to come to a relationship with
[35:31] me
[35:32] and dave and brother branham refused
[35:34] that he refused him until finally one
[35:37] day
[35:37] god brought him down to the place where
[35:39] he was dying
[35:41] and brother brown says okay if you'll
[35:42] spare my life i'll serve you
[35:44] and from that point on god began to deal
[35:47] with him more
[35:48] that's when the visions became more act
[35:50] more active that's when you know
[35:51] different things began to change in his
[35:53] life
[35:54] but he he just became a christian
[35:58] he went to the church he went to because
[35:59] that's where hope was
[36:01] hope was the draw i mean he admits to
[36:03] that
[36:05] and uh but finally he got married and
[36:07] and things were going
[36:08] and he started he he couldn't agree with
[36:11] the baptist doctrine so he began to
[36:13] establish his own church and he just
[36:15] rented i think
[36:16] some some some hall or something like
[36:19] that
[36:20] but he be all he was was a baptist
[36:23] preacher
[36:24] but he kept getting visions and he says
[36:27] what are these visions but he knew that
[36:28] every time he had a vision it was true
[36:31] every time he followed the vision it was
[36:33] true he came to the place he began to
[36:36] to to believe in those visions he began
[36:39] to come to the place he knew he could
[36:40] trust
[36:41] those but he was still a baptist
[36:43] preacher
[36:44] until finally one day all of a sudden he
[36:46] got tired of all the stuff that was
[36:48] going on
[36:48] and he says i have to find out what's
[36:50] going on because
[36:52] either god will either meet with me and
[36:53] take this away from me or else i'll die
[36:56] that's when the angel came and says
[36:58] you're going to take a gift of divine
[37:00] healing around the world
[37:02] he said really so then he
[37:06] with that in mind he began to go out and
[37:08] begin to have healing meetings
[37:11] and uh the angel says nothing will stand
[37:13] before your prayer not even cancer
[37:16] and so here again but he so he he says
[37:18] well okay i have this gift so he began
[37:20] to use it
[37:20] but the angel says that is the wrong way
[37:23] to use it
[37:25] he said that's god a god has placed a
[37:27] gift in you
[37:28] it's for god to use not you but you see
[37:31] he began to advertise
[37:32] bring the hard one bring the lame bring
[37:34] the halt bring the blind bring the death
[37:36] come and watch god perform miracles
[37:38] and after four or five meetings or
[37:40] whatever it was
[37:41] god had to teach him a lesson he so he
[37:45] got up there and he made the head of
[37:46] prayer line and
[37:47] god just left he began to pray and
[37:52] god didn't hear that prayer the guy he
[37:54] came up and he left the way that he came
[37:56] he prayed for the next when the guy left
[37:58] worse i think the third one came up i
[38:00] think was the child if my memory serves
[38:01] me right
[38:02] brother branham realized god's not in
[38:04] this
[38:06] and so he set the meeting down then he
[38:08] went back and the angel said
[38:10] i told you don't do this
[38:13] and he had to come back i think he even
[38:15] referred himself as balaam
[38:17] he said he had to repent he had to
[38:19] repent because he was doing what was
[38:21] wrong
[38:22] but once he took the gift and gave it to
[38:24] god
[38:25] he said then it worked the way god had
[38:28] intended it for it to work
[38:29] but see that's the way with ministers
[38:32] the gift god places in the minister is
[38:34] not for the minister
[38:36] it's for you people we come and we study
[38:39] and we pray and we say lord
[38:41] we need your anointing we need your
[38:43] inspiration and and sometimes the
[38:45] inspiration comes and there are the
[38:47] times we wish it had
[38:49] and sometimes we wish that we could
[38:50] preach it under the same inspiration we
[38:52] had when it was given
[38:54] but here but but we we have no control
[38:56] of this
[38:57] we have no control over this and brother
[39:00] batman says it's you people
[39:01] that activate the gift it's you people
[39:03] that draw on it
[39:04] in some places i've been at and i get up
[39:06] my my texts and i start preaching and
[39:08] all of a sudden the people get excited
[39:10] they begin to draw
[39:11] and i can't keep up with it the other
[39:13] places i go and it's
[39:16] i don't ever i was at one place and it
[39:18] rained a lot
[39:19] and we had to clear this area and so it
[39:22] had a lot of mud
[39:23] and so they gave me this big shovel and
[39:24] so you're shoveling mud
[39:26] and shoveling mud is very tedious very
[39:29] hard
[39:30] and you don't accomplish anything okay
[39:32] it just kind of oozes around
[39:34] and sometimes that's what some services
[39:36] feel like i'm pushing mud
[39:37] you know but here again but regardless
[39:40] of that we're here to
[39:42] to do something and we we pray and we
[39:43] ask god god you have to intervene you
[39:45] have to take control
[39:46] you have to bring the inspiration you
[39:48] have to give us the words
[39:54] when we go back and we look at david
[39:57] david was in in his life yeah all of a
[40:00] sudden
[40:01] he went out and killed some philistines
[40:03] and saul got jealous
[40:04] and then david had to go and run for his
[40:06] life
[40:08] but there was something that stuck with
[40:09] him all during that time of
[40:11] when when he was running away from saul
[40:14] he said i have been anointed to be the
[40:16] king over israel
[40:19] and i have but i have to wait for god's
[40:21] timing to place me there but see we have
[40:25] been called to rule and reign with jesus
[40:27] christ
[40:28] that is our calling it's a spiritual
[40:31] kingdom that we rule and reign
[40:33] over it's not a physical kingdom but we
[40:36] have to be trained we have to come to
[40:38] the place
[40:38] where we have enough trust and faith in
[40:41] god that we can begin to do what god
[40:43] would instruct for us to do
[40:45] when i was in the baptist church they
[40:47] taught you you know mind over matter
[40:48] you know you believe and maybe god will
[40:50] and maybe god won't
[40:52] but in this message that we hear from
[40:53] here we understand god has given us the
[40:56] authority
[40:58] not the power but the authority
[41:01] we have the authority because of who we
[41:03] represent i represent jesus christ
[41:06] i am not him but i represent him because
[41:08] i represent him and if god anoints me in
[41:11] such a way
[41:11] that whatever i speak it has to it can
[41:13] be god and therefore we can cast demons
[41:16] out we can heal the sick we can raise
[41:18] the dead
[41:18] because it's not us it's the god that's
[41:20] in us he is the one doing these things
[41:22] and this is what we have to come to the
[41:24] realization
[41:26] we do not have to we do not have to we
[41:29] do not have to bring to pass
[41:30] the the promises that obligates god
[41:35] and if we can come in we can we can pray
[41:37] and we can come under the inspiration
[41:39] and the anointing of god
[41:40] then god is obligated by his own word to
[41:43] fulfill his word for in in our lives
[41:49] in christ the mystery of god revealed
[41:50] brother branham says if there was
[41:52] three things god wanted to accomplish
[41:54] he's at first to express
[41:55] himself completely god in christ and he
[41:58] did that
[42:00] but you have to realize what did jesus
[42:03] christ was a man
[42:05] he had passions like we all have he had
[42:07] desires like we all have
[42:10] he if he got hit or cut himself he would
[42:13] he'd bled
[42:14] if if he got bumped or something like
[42:15] that he hurt if he felt all the pains
[42:17] that we feel
[42:18] brother brown i think in in the
[42:21] story of anyway there's a story that he
[42:25] talks about he says you know brother
[42:26] jesus christ of god and simply place and
[42:29] all of a sudden he bowed his head
[42:30] because he had a severe headache
[42:32] and i can't think of the book right now
[42:34] but anyway it's irrelevant
[42:36] but he was a man he he suffered in
[42:38] everything the same way as we do
[42:40] but but he had he had come to the place
[42:43] like we read there in the beginning
[42:44] no matter what came on around him he
[42:46] never he never varied he knew who he was
[42:49] he knew that he came for a purpose
[42:51] he knew that god was going to do
[42:53] something for him he knew that
[42:54] he there was a cross waiting for him
[42:56] these are all the things that he knew
[42:58] but and so he just rested believing that
[43:01] god would direct his path
[43:02] he said one place he told the disciple i
[43:04] have need to go by way of samaria
[43:07] samaria is not the way to jericho no
[43:09] it's not but i have needs to go by that
[43:11] way
[43:12] he was in there after he had been
[43:13] preaching he told the disciples we're
[43:15] going to go to the other side
[43:16] and after he was exhausted he went to
[43:18] the boat he laid down and went to sleep
[43:20] and all of a sudden the storm came up
[43:22] and the disciples came back oh we're
[43:23] all going to drown look at the water's
[43:25] coming into the boat we're all going to
[43:26] die we're all going to perish and he
[43:28] looks around he says
[43:30] no no no we're not where's your faith i
[43:33] told you we're going to the other side
[43:36] nothing's going to stop us from getting
[43:39] there
[43:40] he said peace be still and the winds and
[43:43] the waves obey him
[43:44] but see he knew who he was he knew what
[43:46] his calling he knew he had an
[43:48] appointment on the other side
[43:49] he knew that satan could not stop that
[43:51] but see we have to come to the same
[43:53] realization in our life
[43:55] satan cannot stop the plan of god
[43:58] you know the only one that can stop
[44:00] god's plan is you
[44:05] by you unwilling to do as god directs
[44:08] you can stop god
[44:13] it's that simple we had a brother
[44:16] in our church they'd operate on his
[44:19] elbow
[44:20] and uh the operation was successful that
[44:23] he got an infection
[44:25] well they treated them for infection
[44:27] they irrigated it they opened it back up
[44:29] and flushed it with this that and the
[44:30] other
[44:31] put them on more antibiotics and stuff
[44:33] and it seemed to get better and then it
[44:35] got worse
[44:36] well you can only do that so many times
[44:39] and then the damage to that joint
[44:40] becomes excessive and there's nothing
[44:42] that more they can do
[44:44] and then god spoke to me and he says go
[44:46] pray for him
[44:47] but he's in a hospital in charlotte
[44:50] charlotte's a terrible city to drive in
[44:53] i don't want to go to charlotte
[44:55] but you have to go well okay
[45:00] so i went i found where the hospital was
[45:02] i'd been there a couple of times before
[45:04] that's why i knew it was terrible
[45:05] parking lots all that stuff but i found
[45:08] a place to park
[45:10] found out what room he was in went there
[45:11] we talked for a little bit and i says do
[45:13] you know why i'm here
[45:14] he said well no not really i said god
[45:16] told me to come here and pray for you
[45:18] we're dealing with a spiritual battle
[45:19] not a physical one
[45:21] oh so i prayed not that my prayers any
[45:25] better than anybody else's
[45:26] but god directed me so i went
[45:29] i prayed the infection cleared itself up
[45:32] and everything was fine
[45:34] but if i had refused he might have lost
[45:37] his arm
[45:39] i mean you understand where i'm coming
[45:41] from on this
[45:43] you can stop god so if god is directing
[45:45] you to do something do it like that one
[45:47] lady that
[45:48] she had given her seat over to a lady
[45:49] that had a sick child
[45:51] and she went and and as she was walking
[45:53] up to the balcony and god told her you
[45:55] go pray for the baby
[45:56] oh but brother branham's gonna pray she
[45:58] has a prayer card
[46:00] and they and the god says no you go pray
[46:01] for that baby
[46:03] well okay and so she went on i'm sure
[46:05] she was quiet i'm sure she was very
[46:07] respectful i'm sure
[46:08] in a very nice cords away i'm sure she
[46:11] she said would you mind if i prayed for
[46:12] your little baby oh no that'd be nice so
[46:14] she
[46:15] about her head she said a simple little
[46:16] prayer and then she went up to the
[46:18] balcony
[46:19] and then the child of the mother and the
[46:21] child was called before brother branham
[46:24] and brother banham looked at the baby
[46:26] and says well there's nothing wrong with
[46:27] this child
[46:29] and then god showed him what had
[46:30] happened he pointed the lady up in the
[46:33] balcony and says lady
[46:34] he said your prayer healed this boy this
[46:37] baby
[46:38] he said you at being a mother you could
[46:41] have compassion on this child or maybe i
[46:43] wouldn't
[46:44] and thank you for obeying god but see
[46:47] here again it's not
[46:48] it's not wrapped up in the prophet it's
[46:50] not just limited to him and to him only
[46:52] i hear too many people oh if the prophet
[46:54] was only here oh if the prophet was only
[46:56] here
[46:56] no he's not but god is and he's the same
[47:00] yesterday today and forever
[47:01] he doesn't need the prophet to operate
[47:03] through he needs you
[47:05] because you are his body you are the one
[47:07] that he dwells in
[47:09] but he has to get preeminence he has to
[47:12] get the same control in
[47:13] us that he did in jesus christ and what
[47:16] was in jesus christ there was a
[47:18] relationship there
[47:19] where no matter what came against him no
[47:21] matter what the situation was
[47:23] he never feared he never became anxious
[47:25] he never worried he'd ever
[47:27] he just said well lord i'm here because
[47:29] you sent me here now lord what do you
[47:31] want me to do
[47:32] but see that's how it has to come in in
[47:34] our lives
[47:38] then that havoc speaks of is not faith
[47:40] in itself but a real true confiding
[47:43] confiding faith it's one of a
[47:45] relationship of the creature to the
[47:47] creator it's an
[47:48] unshaken trust it's like a little child
[47:51] putting his hand
[47:52] in the hand of his father he trusts his
[47:55] father
[47:56] he has no reason not to trust his father
[47:59] if i can only get to daddy daddy will
[48:01] take care of me if i can only get to
[48:02] daddy daddy is stronger
[48:04] we had the deal when i was a young kid
[48:06] my daddy's bigger than your daddy my
[48:08] daddy can beat up your daddy you know
[48:10] my dad was wise enough not to get
[48:12] entangled in that kind of a nonsense
[48:15] but you know that's the faith i had in
[48:16] daddy okay
[48:18] but here again but we have to understand
[48:20] this is this is the relationship that
[48:22] god is trying to get us to have with him
[48:26] and even in havoc even though he he
[48:29] wrestled with this thought
[48:31] he said the chaldeans come he says
[48:33] what's going to happen to me
[48:35] can i survive the onslaught can i
[48:37] survive the destitute could i survive
[48:40] depending upon the outcome of these
[48:42] battles
[48:44] in habakkuk 3 it says when i heard my
[48:46] belly trembled
[48:47] my lips quivered at the voice rottnest
[48:49] entered into my bones and i trembled in
[48:51] myself
[48:52] that i might rest in the day of trouble
[48:54] when he cometh up unto the people he
[48:56] will invade
[48:57] when he invaded with his troops he was
[49:01] i mean he was scared but he goes on
[49:04] although the fig tree shall not blossom
[49:06] neither shall fruit be in the vines the
[49:09] labor of the olive shall fail
[49:11] the fields shall yield no meat the flock
[49:14] shall be cut off from the fold
[49:15] and there be no herd in the stalls
[49:18] though be we be destitute
[49:20] though he has nothing yet i will rejoice
[49:24] in the lord i will joy
[49:26] in the god of my salvation and that
[49:29] sound
[49:29] and that's in when i when i studied that
[49:31] that one verse up there
[49:33] it's the strongest way that they could
[49:35] possibly express this
[49:36] in the hebrew language it talks about i
[49:39] will not only rejoice but i will shout
[49:41] and i will dance and i will jump and i
[49:44] will praise him
[49:45] with with all with everything that is
[49:46] within me i will worship him as if i had
[49:49] everything i will join
[49:50] and rejoice and give glory and honor to
[49:52] god as if as if i was possessive of all
[49:54] things
[49:56] what he possessed did not dictate to him
[49:59] his relationship with god
[50:01] and this is where i was trying to tell
[50:03] the ones in india because
[50:05] we don't know what's going to happen
[50:06] there i mean there were times the people
[50:08] they had no food
[50:10] freddie went to get oxygen for his
[50:11] mother because she came down with coburn
[50:14] it was fifty dollars to get a tank of
[50:16] oxygen for two days
[50:19] their economy cannot you cannot sustain
[50:22] that
[50:25] i managed to send them some money and
[50:27] hopefully it helped out
[50:29] but here again it freddie had the cash
[50:33] but a lot of people didn't what were
[50:36] they going to do
[50:38] they couldn't get the oxygen because of
[50:40] the government
[50:41] because of what the government had done
[50:44] but see this is this is where we have to
[50:46] come in our relationship this is where
[50:48] we have to come in and trust
[50:49] i was reading when i in church which
[50:52] sometimes i just open my bible and read
[50:53] before
[50:54] the song service and stuff and in in
[50:57] psalm
[50:57] in isaiah excuse me 31 1-3
[51:01] it said woe to those that go down to
[51:03] egypt for help and stay on horses and
[51:05] trust in chariots because they are many
[51:07] and a horseman because they are very
[51:09] strong but they look not unto the holy
[51:11] one of israel neither seek either seek
[51:13] the lord
[51:14] yet he also is wise and will bring evil
[51:16] and will not
[51:17] call back his words but will rise
[51:19] against the house of the evil doers and
[51:21] against the help of them
[51:22] that work iniquity he said now the
[51:25] egyptians are men
[51:27] and not god their horses are flesh
[51:30] and they're not spirit and that struck
[51:33] me when i read that and then god began
[51:37] to deal with me on that
[51:39] why where do i trust him
[51:43] where do i put my trust what do i lean
[51:46] upon when i have a need
[51:49] we were flying to india uh this was last
[51:53] 2019 i think it was and uh we got we we
[51:56] flew into london
[51:58] made a connection and surely we have to
[52:00] take off then about an hour later they
[52:02] begin to serve food
[52:04] and they delivered the food and surely
[52:06] wasn't touching hers at all
[52:08] i mean it's not the best it's not you
[52:10] know
[52:12] not what it used to be it's put that way
[52:15] but i said why aren't you eating she
[52:16] says i have a terrible terrible
[52:18] headache oh
[52:21] first reaction okay we're about six
[52:23] hours from hyderabad
[52:25] uh we'll get there we got pills but
[52:27] they're in the luggage you know
[52:28] in the body of the ship of the plane
[52:32] and uh so i will get you some pills land
[52:35] you go to bed you'll get to get some
[52:37] sleep and it'll you know
[52:38] it'll go away and then god reminded me
[52:41] of this
[52:43] he said why did he go to egypt
[52:48] why why do you rest in yourself why do
[52:50] you trust yourself why do you trust your
[52:52] abilities
[52:53] i mean i worked in the hospital
[52:54] laboratory for 20-something years
[52:58] 40. oh wow that many okay
[53:01] but i know medical science i i know how
[53:03] to read the charts i know what the
[53:05] numbers mean
[53:06] within a certain range anyway and so
[53:08] when
[53:09] when we go to the doctors um the fact
[53:11] the doctor told me i was overprotective
[53:13] of her
[53:14] because every time they're gonna do
[53:15] something i ask questions and i ask
[53:17] lots of them if i don't like the answers
[53:20] i want another
[53:21] opinion okay i mean that hard to get
[53:24] along with i know
[53:26] but god was telling me why do you rest
[53:28] why do you trust yourself
[53:30] why don't you trust me this time
[53:34] well i didn't have any choice really i
[53:37] said well okay lord
[53:39] so i put my hand on hers and i said lord
[53:41] we're going because you have called us
[53:43] to go
[53:45] we don't have access to the medications
[53:47] we normally bring along but lord
[53:49] you're asking me to trust you you're
[53:50] asking me to believe you
[53:52] you say you are the god that heals and
[53:55] lord
[53:56] now i'm in need of that healing from my
[53:58] wife
[54:00] then an hour or so the headache began to
[54:02] subside by the time we land in the
[54:04] higher bed it was totally gone
[54:06] but see god was testing me
[54:10] when we were there um they slammed their
[54:12] brakes on a couple times and threw
[54:14] shirley around like a doll in a
[54:16] in a windstorm and then they we went
[54:18] over and we hit a dip once and even with
[54:20] a seat belt on her head hit the roof of
[54:22] the car and gave her a concussion
[54:25] and so on that trip really she suffered
[54:27] a lot
[54:28] in that trip but when she hit the top
[54:31] roof of the car
[54:32] i looked over and she had a concussion i
[54:35] said well lord
[54:36] we need you now. and so i reached my
[54:38] hand back and prayed and
[54:40] i watched you know okay the symptoms
[54:42] began to subside
[54:45] but see all along on that trip god was
[54:48] trying me
[54:49] do you trust me will you rely upon me
[54:53] you're going to run to egypt every time
[54:55] there's a problem or you will or you'll
[54:56] rely upon me
[54:57] this time and it's coming to the place
[55:00] in a lot of things we have to rely upon
[55:02] god
[55:04] my opinion for whatever it's worth it's
[55:06] going to get worse in this country
[55:08] it's going to come to the place where we
[55:10] may not have food it's going to come to
[55:12] the place we may not have fuel it's
[55:13] going to come to the place
[55:14] where where we could be basically
[55:16] destitute of all things
[55:18] i know all it takes is you have to sit
[55:20] there and crush one of the pipelines
[55:22] going across the mississippi
[55:23] uh well you people have things here
[55:25] where they can process oil
[55:27] and make make petroleum make gasoline
[55:29] out of it where i live they don't
[55:31] there was one time a few years back when
[55:34] they had to shut the refineries down
[55:35] it was two months before we could we
[55:38] could regularly get gas
[55:40] two months and even then it was it was
[55:42] rationed
[55:44] it could happen again it could make it
[55:46] so you all you have
[55:48] nice beautiful cars and they sit in your
[55:49] in your driveway and
[55:51] you know if unless you want to push it
[55:53] to work you're going to have to walk
[55:56] but i mean we don't know tomorrow we
[55:59] literally do not know
[56:00] tomorrow another example
[56:04] we all my brother he had plans for his
[56:08] retirement
[56:09] and uh he was making all of his
[56:11] preparations and he figured he was going
[56:13] to wait till a certain year and he was
[56:14] going to retire and get so much
[56:16] social security and had money in
[56:17] retirement and this that and the other
[56:20] then he had a heart attack
[56:23] and that changed his life
[56:26] i'm his wife he had appendicitis they
[56:28] took it out and then thanksgiving day
[56:31] all of a sudden he started having pains
[56:32] and
[56:33] she called up her brother which is a
[56:35] doctor and
[56:36] described the symptoms she says get him
[56:37] to the hospital now
[56:39] so she drove him into the emergency room
[56:41] and a doctor was prepping himself to do
[56:44] a heart cath on a patient
[56:46] they looked at my brother and five
[56:48] minutes at a time they went into the
[56:49] emergency room he was on the table
[56:52] that saved his life that gave him a one
[56:55] one heart cath on on the friday
[56:59] or i think it was the friday and then
[57:01] monday they had to give him put another
[57:02] stint in
[57:04] and uh after he had visited for us a
[57:06] while they put a
[57:07] third in but he had he didn't have any
[57:09] energy his heart there just wasn't the
[57:11] flow
[57:13] and then one day in church he was
[57:15] sitting there and he said he could stand
[57:16] up for the first
[57:17] song he may make it through the second
[57:20] before he'd have to sit down because he
[57:21] was exhausted
[57:23] and then god just spoke and says raise
[57:25] your hands and praise me
[57:27] so he did he saw the doctor the
[57:30] following week and he said your heart's
[57:31] as good as a 20 year old
[57:33] but see here again god god spared his
[57:37] life
[57:38] and then god healed him and now he
[57:40] preaches
[57:42] that was not part of his retirement
[57:44] ideas
[57:45] but but see god had to get his attention
[57:48] and god had to do something in his life
[57:50] to go ahead and and create circumstances
[57:52] in his life or all of a sudden now god
[57:54] could use him for what god wanted him to
[57:56] do
[57:57] okay and so this this is something you
[58:00] know that we all have to learn
[58:01] but like i say god was trying to teach
[58:03] me he says rely upon me don't rely upon
[58:05] what you can do
[58:06] don't rely live upon your own knowledge
[58:08] don't rely upon your own abilities
[58:10] yeah i mean i can do some things i i
[58:12] will admit to that
[58:14] but like like the brother like like the
[58:16] brother mike orders he had he he knew
[58:18] electricity i mean he'd been doing it
[58:20] for
[58:20] what 40 years he knew the substation he
[58:24] knew every wire was
[58:26] but he had to rely upon god to be able
[58:28] to fix things
[58:30] anyway it goes on when we talk about it
[58:34] in hebrews 4
[58:35] like we were reading he said let us
[58:36] therefore fear it means be cautious be
[58:39] watchful be on guard
[58:40] it's not being feared well i'm afraid
[58:42] i'm afraid no it's pay attention
[58:44] look at the things around you analyze
[58:47] what is going on around you
[58:49] be be mindful of these things he said
[58:52] lest a promise that was left us of
[58:53] entering into this rest
[58:55] we we seem to come short of it we don't
[58:57] enter into that
[58:59] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[59:01] well as unto them but the word preached
[59:02] did not
[59:03] profit them not being mixed with faith
[59:05] in them that hurt it
[59:07] and it's the faith not trying to believe
[59:09] for something but it's faith as a
[59:10] relationship it's faith
[59:12] as as a relationship between you and
[59:14] between god because only then can you
[59:16] rest
[59:18] because only when
[59:21] i we have a car and because of my
[59:24] relationship with the dealership
[59:26] i trust them they have never done me bad
[59:29] they've always treated me well they've
[59:31] always done what i have asked for them
[59:32] to do and sometimes they go the extra
[59:34] mile and they'll do something for me
[59:36] that i have not asked them to so i trust
[59:38] them
[59:39] but that trust came as a result of
[59:42] interacting with them
[59:43] on numerous occasions i was talking to
[59:46] one brother in another church and he
[59:48] said yeah he bought a
[59:49] he bought a honda and they tried to rip
[59:51] him off from the day one
[59:52] so he doesn't have any faith in that and
[59:54] that okay
[59:55] but faith is is based upon a
[59:57] relationship it's
[59:59] having if you have faith in someone
[1:00:02] because you trust them
[1:00:05] i mean there are some people i i'm i'm a
[1:00:07] simple-minded person
[1:00:08] i take everything at face value and
[1:00:11] somebody told me that's a dangerous way
[1:00:13] to be because people
[1:00:14] take advantage of that and i've learned
[1:00:16] that also
[1:00:18] but here again but
[1:00:21] if if i can come to the place with a
[1:00:23] relationship with a person where i have
[1:00:25] trust where i can trust them
[1:00:27] then i have faith that they will do what
[1:00:29] they say they will do okay
[1:00:30] but this is the relationship like i say
[1:00:32] that we have to come with god
[1:00:34] it goes on to verse three for we which
[1:00:36] have believed or we which to have trust
[1:00:39] we do enter into rest and so here again
[1:00:41] like i say to me this rest is based upon
[1:00:44] our ability to have faith and to be able
[1:00:45] to trust in god
[1:00:46] and if you trust him that'll if you
[1:00:49] trust in him that gives you the faith to
[1:00:50] believe in
[1:00:51] in him
[1:00:55] when you look at the people that into
[1:00:57] the promised land god had taken
[1:00:59] and delivered the children of israel out
[1:01:01] of egypt to them god was the god of
[1:01:03] history
[1:01:04] god was the god of abraham isaac and
[1:01:06] jacob they did not know that god
[1:01:08] but he said well i wasn't god sent to
[1:01:10] moses and all of a sudden moses comes
[1:01:13] along and says god has sent me to
[1:01:14] deliver you
[1:01:15] oh really yeah so the first miracle that
[1:01:18] the thing that they had brought judgment
[1:01:20] upon them all you guys are getting lazy
[1:01:23] and stuff like that so you guys have to
[1:01:24] go and get your own straw to build your
[1:01:26] own bricks and that made them so they
[1:01:28] really didn't have any confidence in
[1:01:29] moses
[1:01:31] but they but god began through moses to
[1:01:33] perform certain actions to bring
[1:01:35] judgment upon egypt
[1:01:37] and then they began to understand the
[1:01:39] god of abraham
[1:01:40] isaac and jacob they began to understand
[1:01:42] the might and the power
[1:01:44] that this god possesses and then god
[1:01:46] would come to long and
[1:01:48] and they brought him to the red sea and
[1:01:50] oh you know this is they began to cry
[1:01:52] oh you brought us out here to die you
[1:01:54] brought us out here to die better we
[1:01:55] just go back into egypt
[1:01:57] and we and you know become slaves all
[1:01:59] over again and
[1:02:00] then god spoke to moses and moses cried
[1:02:02] out to god what do you want me to do now
[1:02:03] what do you want me to do now what do
[1:02:04] like all these people grumbling and
[1:02:06] griping and complaining
[1:02:07] and moses says god says moses just to
[1:02:10] settle down boy
[1:02:11] he said take your rod smite the water
[1:02:14] it'll part oh okay
[1:02:18] so he did but here again it comes to the
[1:02:21] relationship
[1:02:22] but too often i find that people when
[1:02:24] they get into bad situations where do
[1:02:26] they run
[1:02:28] back to egypt they would rather go back
[1:02:31] to
[1:02:31] slavery to egypt than they would the
[1:02:34] freedom which god
[1:02:35] will give them if they would learn to
[1:02:38] trust in god and rest in god god says i
[1:02:40] will take care of you i will provide for
[1:02:42] you
[1:02:42] in fact that's the way i read this thing
[1:02:44] in habakkuk god if i put my trust in you
[1:02:47] if i totally take my life and i give it
[1:02:49] to you
[1:02:50] you are now under an obligation to take
[1:02:52] care of me
[1:02:54] because now you become my father and
[1:02:56] you're the one that has promised to take
[1:02:58] care of me
[1:02:58] and that's how i look at it i mean i
[1:03:00] might be interpreting this scripture
[1:03:02] wrong but that's what i've told god okay
[1:03:06] but see why did god send us a prophet
[1:03:10] why all of a sudden in in our generation
[1:03:14] did we see miracles and manifestations
[1:03:16] from god that the churches could never
[1:03:18] produce
[1:03:20] why could brother branham on thousands
[1:03:22] and thousands of times
[1:03:23] discernment and he would tell the people
[1:03:25] this what you're praying for this is
[1:03:27] your disease
[1:03:27] and all of a sudden he said everybody be
[1:03:29] quiet and bow your head because there's
[1:03:30] a demon here we have to deal with
[1:03:32] and he would cast the demons out and
[1:03:35] over and over and over again this
[1:03:36] happened
[1:03:38] to the place oh yeah if we can only get
[1:03:40] in touch with brother branham well if we
[1:03:41] can only get in touch with brother brown
[1:03:43] but brother branham was saying no no
[1:03:44] it's not me it's god
[1:03:46] and one place he says i was there i was
[1:03:48] just standing there in the river when he
[1:03:49] when the angel the light came down i was
[1:03:51] just standing there when he used my
[1:03:53] voice i was just standing there when he
[1:03:54] healed this person
[1:03:55] i would just happen to be the one
[1:03:57] standing there when god did this and
[1:03:58] this and this and this
[1:04:00] but see where does that god dwell today
[1:04:02] where is he now
[1:04:03] but he dwells in you and this is what we
[1:04:06] have to rely upon
[1:04:08] you know another thing i studied brother
[1:04:09] brown's life and ministry a couple years
[1:04:12] ago now and it was interesting brother
[1:04:14] branham went from a baptist preacher
[1:04:17] you know and he was studying through the
[1:04:18] bible and he looked at what a prophet
[1:04:20] was
[1:04:21] and he looked at how god was dealing
[1:04:23] with him and says
[1:04:25] i must be a prophet and so he began to
[1:04:29] acknowledge that
[1:04:31] so he stepped into the office if i could
[1:04:33] use it that way
[1:04:34] of a prophet and then then when the
[1:04:38] discernment started coming
[1:04:41] and all of a sudden he realized this the
[1:04:43] same way that god did with
[1:04:44] with abraham and sarah and then he began
[1:04:48] to expound upon this he began to relate
[1:04:50] to that so then he stepped into that
[1:04:52] office he used to say that billy graham
[1:04:56] was it was malachi 4.
[1:04:58] until after he preached the church ages
[1:05:00] when when when five i think of the
[1:05:02] visions that he had had come to pass
[1:05:04] i think it was that many yeah and he so
[1:05:07] he's oh we're at the end times five of
[1:05:08] the visions have been fulfilled he says
[1:05:10] oh we must be at the end time so he
[1:05:11] preached the church aid series
[1:05:13] at the end of the church age series the
[1:05:15] angel says now we read malachi 4.
[1:05:18] and he realized that's me
[1:05:22] and then he was willing to step into
[1:05:24] that office
[1:05:26] but it wasn't until 63. he says when the
[1:05:28] angel when the messenger begins to sound
[1:05:30] he says the messenger wasn't sounding
[1:05:32] when i was a baptist preacher the
[1:05:33] messenger wasn't sounding
[1:05:34] when i did the zerman or or the other
[1:05:37] thing he said that wasn't it he said
[1:05:38] when god put the sword in my hand he
[1:05:40] says that's when that's when the message
[1:05:42] began that's when i began
[1:05:43] and he says now i have a message i have
[1:05:45] to deliver to the people and i cannot
[1:05:47] turn back from that
[1:05:48] so in his life he had to slowly go from
[1:05:50] this office to this office to this
[1:05:52] office
[1:05:54] you were called as christians
[1:05:58] but you're also called to be the bride
[1:05:59] of jesus christ
[1:06:03] you were born a human being but now
[1:06:06] you're called to be sons and daughters
[1:06:07] of god
[1:06:09] it takes a huge change in our thinking
[1:06:12] oh yeah i'm just a sinner saved by grace
[1:06:14] in fact that that's what bothered me
[1:06:15] when i was in the bath
[1:06:16] in in the denominational system oh yeah
[1:06:19] you're a sinner
[1:06:20] saved by grace the emphasis was on i was
[1:06:23] a sinner
[1:06:24] i was always going to be a sinner i was
[1:06:25] always going to have mistakes i was
[1:06:27] always going to have problems always
[1:06:28] going to trying to overcome
[1:06:29] but in this message i find it no i'm a
[1:06:31] son of god that's been fully restored to
[1:06:32] my rightful position with god
[1:06:35] but still it takes a huge chance for
[1:06:37] information in my thinking
[1:06:39] do i am i acting as a sinners i by grace
[1:06:42] or now am i
[1:06:42] able to act as a son of god am i able to
[1:06:45] actually get into
[1:06:46] the channel where god can speak through
[1:06:47] me and do the things through me that
[1:06:48] he's wanting to do
[1:06:50] because see that's what we are called to
[1:06:51] be we are
[1:06:53] at the end time the end time is no
[1:06:55] longer future we are there
[1:06:58] but see we have to begin we have to step
[1:07:00] into the office
[1:07:01] of of being the bride of jesus christ we
[1:07:04] have to step into the office of being
[1:07:05] sons and daughters of god
[1:07:07] we have to be able to sit there and
[1:07:08] begin to realize this is what i
[1:07:10] am the bible says now are you the sons
[1:07:14] of god does not appear what you shall be
[1:07:16] but but when you shall see him you
[1:07:18] should just be him like he is
[1:07:19] that's now but you have to believe it
[1:07:24] [Applause]
[1:07:26] you have to believe this that's why god
[1:07:30] sent the prophet
[1:07:31] that one one minister i think anyway
[1:07:33] they they made mention of the fact you
[1:07:35] know during the church ages
[1:07:37] he was dealing with both vines when he
[1:07:39] gets to the
[1:07:40] to the last church age the lady is
[1:07:41] seeing church age no he was just dealing
[1:07:43] with a false one
[1:07:45] it took a prophet to this generation to
[1:07:47] tell the bride no you are not lukewarm
[1:07:50] no you are not reaching increasingly
[1:07:52] no what you are you are the son of god
[1:07:54] you are the pure
[1:07:55] pure virtuous sinless bride of jesus
[1:07:58] christ
[1:07:59] you are sinless in his sight and
[1:08:01] sometimes i wrestle with that one even
[1:08:05] but it has to it comes to the place in
[1:08:07] our thinking we have to be willing to
[1:08:08] step
[1:08:09] into that we have to be willing to get
[1:08:11] out of ourselves and quit relying upon
[1:08:13] ages and could relying upon our own
[1:08:15] thoughts and our own processes
[1:08:16] and our own intellect if you will and
[1:08:18] begin to come to
[1:08:19] come to grips with the fact no we are
[1:08:21] sons and daughters of god
[1:08:23] we have the authority of god because of
[1:08:25] who we represent
[1:08:31] one of the things when you look at the
[1:08:32] ones when they when they came into
[1:08:34] into the land of canaan before they were
[1:08:37] there when they were
[1:08:38] in the wilderness there's there's a
[1:08:42] i think it's a psalm 78 or something
[1:08:44] like that the question was well god did
[1:08:46] this but can he do this
[1:08:47] well god did this but i wonder if he can
[1:08:49] do this
[1:08:51] and they you know it but it was always
[1:08:53] can god they didn't believe it until god
[1:08:55] until god performed it but if they would
[1:08:57] turn that around like when
[1:08:59] when the spies went into the land ten of
[1:09:01] them came back says oh yeah
[1:09:02] we're grasshoppers in their sight we're
[1:09:03] just little puny things we can't there's
[1:09:05] no way we
[1:09:06] can do that because they left god out of
[1:09:07] the picture
[1:09:09] but the other two this is no god has
[1:09:11] given to us a promise
[1:09:13] and because of that promise he has given
[1:09:15] us the land it doesn't matter what we
[1:09:17] look like
[1:09:17] we could hobble in there you know with
[1:09:19] wooden legs and and and wooden
[1:09:20] broomsticks
[1:09:21] like that and we could slaughter all of
[1:09:22] them i mean
[1:09:24] with shamgar he just took an ox goat and
[1:09:26] he killed 600 philistines
[1:09:28] he had samson he just took a draw bone
[1:09:30] of an i don't know how many
[1:09:31] thousands he killed
[1:09:32] but i mean here again use what you have
[1:09:34] and what you have you have the word
[1:09:37] god is still god god did not die in 63.
[1:09:40] god did not god did not die when when
[1:09:42] the prophet was taken off the scene
[1:09:44] no god is alive today and he'll do the
[1:09:47] same thing but you have to believe
[1:09:50] it is all based upon your ability to
[1:10:00] believe
[1:10:02] revelations 10 8 and the voice which i
[1:10:05] heard from heaven spake unto
[1:10:06] unto unto me again and said go and take
[1:10:08] the little book which is open in the
[1:10:10] hand of the angel which standeth upon
[1:10:11] the scene upon the earth
[1:10:13] and i went unto the angel and said to
[1:10:14] him give me the little book
[1:10:16] he said let me take it eat it up it
[1:10:19] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[1:10:20] be in their mouth sweet as honey
[1:10:22] in other words you have to become with
[1:10:24] one with that word
[1:10:25] you have to sow feed on that word until
[1:10:27] really the word consumes you
[1:10:29] until you and the you you basically you
[1:10:32] and the word literally unite together
[1:10:33] and becomes the same
[1:10:35] and i went into the angel and said give
[1:10:37] me the little book and he said to eat it
[1:10:38] and he says i took a little book in the
[1:10:40] angel's hand and it was it was my mouth
[1:10:42] the sweetest honey and stuff he said but
[1:10:44] thou must prophesy
[1:10:46] it's not brother branham will prophesy
[1:10:48] this is revelations 10
[1:10:50] 10 11. brother branham was in
[1:10:52] revelations 10
[1:10:53] 7. no this is the bride's ministry
[1:10:56] it isn't it isn't relegated to the
[1:10:58] prophet no now it has come from the
[1:11:00] prophet down
[1:11:01] unto us and this is where we where where
[1:11:03] we need to become
[1:11:05] brother brown and wisdom versus faith he
[1:11:07] says jesus noted by experience he noted
[1:11:09] by revelation
[1:11:10] he know that he was that son of god that
[1:11:13] was to come into the world he
[1:11:14] knowed his standing he knowed he was
[1:11:16] born in the world for that purpose
[1:11:19] and that's the reason the word of god
[1:11:20] could work through him because he knowed
[1:11:22] what he was
[1:11:23] glory he said have you caught that yet
[1:11:25] that was in 62.
[1:11:27] have you caught the fact this is who you
[1:11:29] are
[1:11:30] jesus knew who he was do you know who
[1:11:32] you are
[1:11:34] because now we have to be willing to
[1:11:35] step into that office we have to be
[1:11:37] willing to step into that position
[1:11:39] and if we can ever step into the
[1:11:41] position and have the relationship with
[1:11:43] god that we should be having
[1:11:44] all of a sudden we can rest in him and
[1:11:46] then it doesn't matter wherever he
[1:11:48] guides us or directs us or whatever the
[1:11:49] circumstances might be
[1:11:51] because it's no longer relying upon us
[1:11:53] it's relying upon him
[1:11:54] it's all about him anyway it's not about
[1:11:56] us
[1:11:58] [Music]
[1:12:05] church on its condition brother banner
[1:12:06] makes this statement
[1:12:08] he said there you are the dove and the
[1:12:10] lamb united together
[1:12:11] that's when god and man became one
[1:12:14] that's when heaven and earth embrace
[1:12:15] each other
[1:12:16] he said that's when god was made flesh
[1:12:19] that's when god came down from the
[1:12:21] spirit form and was made amen and dwelt
[1:12:23] among us
[1:12:23] that's when all eternity embraced each
[1:12:25] other that's when the human race
[1:12:27] humans fallen race of adam's people and
[1:12:29] jehovah god and every angel come
[1:12:30] together
[1:12:31] when god and man was made one on that
[1:12:33] great memorial day
[1:12:34] when john baptized jesus
[1:12:39] you say you receive the holy spirit
[1:12:42] so what do you receive
[1:12:47] third person of a trinity
[1:12:51] or is it the same god that dwelt in
[1:12:53] christ
[1:12:54] now dwells in you the same god that
[1:12:58] dwelts in peter and paul and
[1:12:59] james and john the same one that dwelt
[1:13:02] in brother branham
[1:13:06] did you receive that god
[1:13:09] because if you did he will do through
[1:13:11] you the same thing he did through them
[1:13:13] there's no difference
[1:13:17] there is no difference but you have to
[1:13:19] believe
[1:13:21] you have to get out of your thinking and
[1:13:23] be able to embrace the fact of who you
[1:13:25] are
[1:13:25] and what you are so you can enter into
[1:13:27] this rest with god
[1:13:29] where you can come to the place where
[1:13:30] you so trust in him and you have so much
[1:13:32] faith in him that whatever you say
[1:13:34] you find in the word that's when all of
[1:13:36] us that's that's when you can believe
[1:13:38] this stuff
[1:13:39] remember in flesh he was just a man but
[1:13:42] in spirit he was god
[1:13:43] but a man in flesh therefore his body
[1:13:46] was a human being that was subject to
[1:13:47] temptation subject to sickness
[1:13:49] just the same as as ours he had to put
[1:13:53] he had to put on because he was a man he
[1:13:55] was human
[1:13:55] and then he was god in the spirit he
[1:13:57] says i and my father are one
[1:13:59] my father do with it and see this is
[1:14:01] where we have to come in our lives
[1:14:03] it isn't up to you to heal anybody
[1:14:07] it's up to you to pray we are a king
[1:14:10] we are we are a kingdom of priests we
[1:14:14] are kings and priests unto god
[1:14:16] kings rule what do we rule over
[1:14:21] satan's kingdom you have the authority
[1:14:25] to tell them to back off you have to
[1:14:26] tell them to take a hike you ever tell
[1:14:28] them to have a headache you have a
[1:14:29] television
[1:14:30] i don't want what you're trying to give
[1:14:31] me you enjoy it for the next couple
[1:14:32] three days
[1:14:33] i don't want that what you're trying to
[1:14:34] give me but see you have that you have
[1:14:37] that authority
[1:14:39] but you we failed to use it
[1:14:45] it says whosoever believeth in me shall
[1:14:47] never die believe
[1:14:48] believeth in me not on me but in me
[1:14:51] being in him believing
[1:14:52] if you abide in me in my words and you
[1:14:54] see in him believing
[1:14:56] ye and me and i knew that they might be
[1:14:57] one father even as you and i are one
[1:14:59] god in christ christ in the church see
[1:15:02] just as as we are one so they be one
[1:15:04] then how can you be one if you abide in
[1:15:06] me and my words and you see it's abiding
[1:15:08] my words in you and then ask what you
[1:15:10] will and if it isn't you no more it's
[1:15:11] the word that's in you it's the word of
[1:15:13] god
[1:15:14] it's about him it's not about us
[1:15:17] it's not what you do it's what he does
[1:15:20] it's what you allow him
[1:15:22] to do through you
[1:15:25] because often we say well i'm i don't
[1:15:27] know if i can do that i don't i don't
[1:15:29] feel good today i'm
[1:15:30] i'm just kind of a little awake brother
[1:15:32] branham says when the weakest of saints
[1:15:34] balance their leaves before god
[1:15:36] satan trembles
[1:15:39] because there all of a sudden that
[1:15:40] little weakling is getting in touch with
[1:15:42] what has more power
[1:15:43] than anything that you could even begin
[1:15:45] to imagine
[1:15:48] otherwise you're going to form what's
[1:15:50] known to me as a bride see all right
[1:15:52] i'll go with you and you will be a part
[1:15:54] of me you will be my bride my life will
[1:15:56] be in your body just like a husband and
[1:15:58] wife with one person you and i are going
[1:16:00] to be one
[1:16:00] at that day you'll know that i am in the
[1:16:02] father the fathers and me i and you and
[1:16:04] you and me
[1:16:05] oh i just love that satan gets so angry
[1:16:07] there see the oneness of god
[1:16:10] [Applause]
[1:16:11] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:16:13] all the christ was he poured into the
[1:16:15] church there you are
[1:16:16] it makes us all one in that sense we
[1:16:20] are part of the godhead you are a part
[1:16:22] of god from the beginning you have been
[1:16:24] fully restored to your rightful position
[1:16:26] with god
[1:16:27] and you have to embrace this
[1:16:30] i mean this is what i see around me this
[1:16:32] i hear these people pray
[1:16:34] and then pray like well you know god is
[1:16:36] out there someplace and god won't hear
[1:16:37] my prayers
[1:16:38] and and i'm not sure i have the faith to
[1:16:40] believe that god will do that
[1:16:42] yes you do
[1:16:45] god does not see you as a sinner
[1:16:48] god sees you as righteous as he is
[1:16:50] righteous
[1:16:52] so quit looking at yourself quit looking
[1:16:55] at your stumbling and your faults and
[1:16:56] your failures
[1:16:57] i have plenty of them every time i get
[1:16:59] out of bed in the morning i make a lot
[1:17:01] of them but it's not about me it's about
[1:17:03] him i just confess it to him and he puts
[1:17:05] it in the receivers of his forgetfulness
[1:17:07] and that's the end of it
[1:17:08] but see this is where we have to come in
[1:17:10] our relationship
[1:17:12] i get i i have come to the place in my
[1:17:14] life i rest
[1:17:17] i've actually come to the place of my
[1:17:18] life i rest
[1:17:20] does everything go well no i get up and
[1:17:23] i have certain things planned for the
[1:17:24] day and all of a sudden something
[1:17:26] happens and changes the whole day
[1:17:28] um i don't i don't control the future
[1:17:34] um that's that's not my place
[1:17:38] i mean there was times we were i think
[1:17:40] we were in arkansas and it was a tornado
[1:17:41] coming around and
[1:17:43] we looked at it and says well lord can
[1:17:46] you have it go around us
[1:17:48] he did he split it in two went around us
[1:17:51] and joined back together again and
[1:17:52] continued on its journey
[1:17:54] that's no problem we were in jamaica
[1:17:56] once and all of a sudden it was going to
[1:17:58] come right through where we were at
[1:17:59] i said well lord can you just veer it
[1:18:02] just a little bit to the north
[1:18:04] that's what it did all of a sudden story
[1:18:05] doing this curve it just
[1:18:07] okay well that's fine
[1:18:11] you'll see that's impossible no it's not
[1:18:14] jesus could say peace be still the
[1:18:17] wind's in the ways obeyed him
[1:18:19] brother ramses in the storm you stop and
[1:18:20] you go back and let the sun shine out
[1:18:22] for three or four days they were done
[1:18:23] hunting and
[1:18:24] that's exactly what happened that spoken
[1:18:27] word
[1:18:28] lies in you but you have to be
[1:18:34] i don't like driving through big cities
[1:18:37] every now and then i have to go through
[1:18:38] atlanta
[1:18:40] if i had the spoken word most of the
[1:18:42] people in lancer driving would be off of
[1:18:44] the road
[1:18:46] i would speak them out of existence so i
[1:18:48] could nicely go on my way
[1:18:51] but see that's not using it rightfully
[1:18:53] that that is not god's will
[1:18:55] but but you but but but other things
[1:18:58] come like the hurricanes and the
[1:18:59] tornadoes and stuff
[1:19:01] well lord you've given us the authority
[1:19:03] we just want to go around us
[1:19:05] we you know if you want to just get rid
[1:19:07] of it that's fine too but if you don't
[1:19:08] just have it go around us and that's
[1:19:09] what it did
[1:19:11] but see we have that authority that
[1:19:13] arrives within us
[1:19:14] and if we get in touch with our heavenly
[1:19:16] father and we can rest in him and we can
[1:19:18] trust in him
[1:19:19] and have the faith to believe that
[1:19:20] whatever we speak that's exactly what's
[1:19:22] going to happen
[1:19:23] god will honor that because he said he
[1:19:26] would
[1:19:27] this is what god was trying to tell us
[1:19:29] through the prophet it isn't the prophet
[1:19:31] could say this the prophet could say
[1:19:33] that and the prophet could see this
[1:19:34] vision and prophecy can do that no it's
[1:19:36] not about the prophet it was about god
[1:19:37] there was one thing i read i wish i
[1:19:41] could think of it right now but he said
[1:19:42] it's i think it's in zechariah or
[1:19:44] something like that in the first thing
[1:19:45] he said where
[1:19:46] he said go back and look and look at the
[1:19:48] words that the prophets have given
[1:19:51] where are the prophets they're all gone
[1:19:53] where's your fathers
[1:19:54] they're all gone but what happened to
[1:19:56] the word i gave through them
[1:19:57] that is what has been fulfilled well
[1:20:00] brother branham is not here but the word
[1:20:03] that he has given unto us that word is
[1:20:05] still here
[1:20:06] and what do we do we read that word we
[1:20:08] study that word we pray about that word
[1:20:10] and we try and take that word until it
[1:20:12] becomes a part of us
[1:20:14] and when that word becomes a part of us
[1:20:15] then all of a sudden that becomes god
[1:20:17] speaking
[1:20:18] through us when all of a sudden god
[1:20:19] takes control of our minds
[1:20:21] you know in our mouth and all of a
[1:20:22] sudden we open it up and he speaks
[1:20:24] to us because that's what god's trying
[1:20:27] to do
[1:20:27] now this is where we're at
[1:20:34] and in jesus christ the same he says you
[1:20:36] keep trying to trying to test your faith
[1:20:39] i wonder if i've got faith enough to do
[1:20:41] this have i got faith
[1:20:42] he said don't test your faith god said
[1:20:45] so do it anyway
[1:20:46] god said sue after you have tested your
[1:20:49] faith whether you had enough faith to
[1:20:50] come to the meeting or
[1:20:51] did you have enough faith to come to the
[1:20:52] meeting tonight did you test your faith
[1:20:55] to see if you had enough faith
[1:20:56] to eat your supper tonight you uh
[1:20:59] do do you think you'll have you'll have
[1:21:01] to fast well
[1:21:03] while it tests what to test your faith
[1:21:05] he said no he says
[1:21:07] he says he says this is this is all
[1:21:08] wrong it's not a matter of testing
[1:21:10] it's a matter of coming to a
[1:21:11] relationship with god where you rest
[1:21:19] brother brown says god was revealed in
[1:21:21] christ now how many believes that
[1:21:24] god was revealed in christ jehovah
[1:21:25] revealed in christ nowhere
[1:21:27] is god to be revealed in his church with
[1:21:29] his people in us
[1:21:30] the same spirit the same works the same
[1:21:32] manifestations
[1:21:34] the same love the same forgiveness
[1:21:37] the same long suffering gentleness
[1:21:40] patience
[1:21:41] peace mercy it wasn't about power it was
[1:21:44] about character
[1:21:46] it wasn't the power that you say oh man
[1:21:48] look at what i can do you can't do
[1:21:49] anything
[1:21:51] if god doesn't want doesn't honor your
[1:21:53] prayer you can't do nothing
[1:21:55] but yet if you have the character of
[1:21:56] christ and you have the relationship
[1:21:58] which god is trying to establish with
[1:21:59] you
[1:22:00] then all of a sudden he can come down
[1:22:01] and he can work through you and he can
[1:22:03] do things that you would never even have
[1:22:05] have thought about remember keep this in
[1:22:07] mind all that god was departing into
[1:22:09] christ and he was the fullness of the
[1:22:10] godhead bodily
[1:22:11] and all that christ was he's poured into
[1:22:13] the church god above us god with us now
[1:22:15] it's god it is the triunity of god
[1:22:21] so what about the predestined bride of
[1:22:22] jesus christ now
[1:22:24] do you believe the bride is
[1:22:25] predestinated amen they say
[1:22:27] the predestinated bride of christ christ
[1:22:29] now now the church
[1:22:31] the word the predestined right of christ
[1:22:35] now the church the word seed with
[1:22:37] everything that god promised to put into
[1:22:39] the church
[1:22:39] is in it right now that was in 62.
[1:22:47] god rich in mercy he says i'm only
[1:22:48] saying this not to not to mix up
[1:22:50] doctrine but to straighten it out
[1:22:52] that we might get away from this fear
[1:22:53] and the scare you don't know who you are
[1:22:56] you're not going to be but now you are
[1:22:58] the sons of god see you always were
[1:23:01] sons of god for when god had when god
[1:23:03] had you in his thinking in the beginning
[1:23:05] uh you you have to be of this some part
[1:23:07] of you had to be in there your life
[1:23:08] that's in you now
[1:23:09] had to be with god before well then then
[1:23:12] he before
[1:23:13] even before the material was not on
[1:23:15] earth he says in one place he knew the
[1:23:16] color of your scare he knew how
[1:23:18] fat i would be he knew that i would be
[1:23:19] going bald he knew i would be curly hair
[1:23:21] in my beard
[1:23:22] he knew he knew where i would live he
[1:23:23] knew everything about me
[1:23:26] and he loved me anyway do you realize
[1:23:30] that
[1:23:32] he knew you were a scoundrel he knew you
[1:23:34] were a renegade
[1:23:36] he knew everything that you have done
[1:23:38] from the time you were a child to the
[1:23:39] time you came to christ
[1:23:41] and he knows what you'll be tomorrow and
[1:23:44] he still loves you
[1:23:47] because you are his child jesus when he
[1:23:50] died on the cross at calvary he took
[1:23:52] care of all of your sins
[1:23:54] past present and future not so you can
[1:23:57] sin
[1:23:58] that's not the point but so that you can
[1:24:00] confess it and put it under the blood
[1:24:02] so you can re-establish the relationship
[1:24:04] you have with your with your father
[1:24:07] i know with i know i was in really
[1:24:11] trouble when all of a sudden my mom
[1:24:13] looked at me and said wait till your
[1:24:14] daddy gets home
[1:24:17] i had them did all of her books out of
[1:24:18] her bookcase yeah
[1:24:21] that was the wrong button to push so
[1:24:24] daddy came home and i made sure he had
[1:24:26] his slippers
[1:24:28] i made sure he had his paper i made sure
[1:24:30] he had a glass of water
[1:24:32] which is out of character for me and so
[1:24:35] he looked at me and he says have you
[1:24:36] been behaving today
[1:24:38] oh yeah daddy i was really really good
[1:24:42] today
[1:24:43] let me go talk to your mommy so then i
[1:24:46] had to go out and get a willow
[1:24:47] switch
[1:24:49] and i had to make sure it was just the
[1:24:50] right so it would have been just nice
[1:24:53] and dad used it on my bottom so i stood
[1:24:55] up for dinner that night
[1:24:58] but hell was still his son
[1:25:01] he still loved me in spite of everything
[1:25:05] i had done that day he still loved me
[1:25:07] i will always be his son well i have a
[1:25:10] heavenly father
[1:25:11] he knows the mistakes i make he knows
[1:25:14] i'm not perfect in myself
[1:25:16] my perfection's in him my righteousness
[1:25:19] is him everything i need is
[1:25:24] him branham one inflation talks about
[1:25:27] the fire when moses met the bush
[1:25:29] he said the fire left the bush and got
[1:25:31] inside moses
[1:25:33] okay so where's the fire now it's in us
[1:25:48] we have up here on this the psalm of gil
[1:25:50] the
[1:25:51] bomb of gilead
[1:25:55] this is a summation of everything i've
[1:25:57] been trying
[1:25:58] by the grace of god to present
[1:26:02] the one thing we have to up to now is
[1:26:04] supreme
[1:26:06] faith to what we have had
[1:26:09] something that he says now you cannot
[1:26:11] have that faith until you know perfectly
[1:26:12] what you're doing
[1:26:14] when you understand like like he says
[1:26:16] you walk you just say well i'm going to
[1:26:18] go home
[1:26:19] i'm going to go out and start the car he
[1:26:21] says that's all an act of
[1:26:22] faith tomorrow i will meet you at a
[1:26:24] certain place that's all an act of faith
[1:26:26] because you've just done it so much
[1:26:28] because it's a regular routine with you
[1:26:32] well that's the way the things of god
[1:26:34] are a regular
[1:26:36] routine with you
[1:26:40] you get sick he heals you you establish
[1:26:43] a relationship
[1:26:44] you have a need he supplies the need you
[1:26:47] establish the relationship
[1:26:49] it goes on in your life as i mean when i
[1:26:51] was first accepted jesus christ as my
[1:26:54] savior
[1:26:54] i mean how many years ago it's been now
[1:26:56] but over all of those years he's been
[1:26:58] teaching me
[1:26:59] to the place where i have learned over
[1:27:01] and over to begin to trust him
[1:27:04] i've seen him god healed my wife
[1:27:06] numerous occasions
[1:27:07] i've seen him heal me numerous times
[1:27:10] i've seen him take care of us when we
[1:27:11] were in india there's a couple times
[1:27:13] in india if god hadn't intervened we
[1:27:16] wouldn't be here
[1:27:17] but god intervened god's watched over us
[1:27:20] god took care of us
[1:27:21] and when i it's interesting when i am in
[1:27:24] in india
[1:27:25] i know i have no control so i trust in
[1:27:29] him
[1:27:30] now when i come home i think i have
[1:27:31] control
[1:27:33] no no no i think i do
[1:27:36] okay and sometimes i act like i think i
[1:27:39] do
[1:27:40] and then circumstances change but see
[1:27:43] it's this relationship
[1:27:44] it's the way that you live with him
[1:27:46] every single
[1:27:48] day you get up in the morning and says
[1:27:50] god thank you for another day of life
[1:27:52] god what do you want me to do today god
[1:27:54] i have to go to work today watch over me
[1:27:56] make sure nothing no harm comes to me
[1:27:58] while i'm at work watch me on the road
[1:27:59] as i'm traveling
[1:28:00] lord my we're family we're in need of
[1:28:03] groceries my family were in need of this
[1:28:05] my family were in need of that
[1:28:06] and then lo and behold he turns around
[1:28:08] and he supplies it
[1:28:10] because you're his child and so
[1:28:13] and so brother brown says see that's a
[1:28:15] faith you're going to go out and start
[1:28:16] your car why you
[1:28:17] you go out there you stick the key and
[1:28:19] you turn that ah it starts
[1:28:21] it's always started right unless you
[1:28:22] have a dead battery but i mean generally
[1:28:24] speaking
[1:28:25] it always does you go you go into the
[1:28:27] house and and
[1:28:28] you know it's dark you do you reach for
[1:28:30] the light switch you flip it on light
[1:28:31] comes on okay
[1:28:33] why it's it's supreme faith
[1:28:36] because it always happens and so what
[1:28:39] happens with god now you're walking with
[1:28:41] god and says well god i have this need
[1:28:43] and all of a sudden he supplies it
[1:28:44] that's supreme faith
[1:28:46] because you're willing to trust him
[1:28:48] you're willing to get out of yourself
[1:28:49] you're instead of running back into
[1:28:51] egypt instead of running back to you
[1:28:52] and relying upon yourself what are you
[1:28:54] doing now you're putting it in his hands
[1:28:56] and says
[1:28:56] god you take care of me god you supply
[1:28:58] my knees today and you watch him do it
[1:29:00] every single day
[1:29:02] and then you realize god you're still
[1:29:04] there god's just alive you're the same
[1:29:06] yesterday today and forever
[1:29:07] and you just walk with him
[1:29:10] and then something comes up well okay
[1:29:12] lord you knew this was going to happen
[1:29:14] okay you take care of it
[1:29:17] it's that simple but you have to be
[1:29:20] willing to get away from yourself you
[1:29:22] have to be willing to take it and put it
[1:29:23] in his hand
[1:29:24] he said this is the supreme faith that
[1:29:26] we must have
[1:29:29] see after you have trusted him and
[1:29:31] watched him do so many things
[1:29:33] till it becomes just a regular routine
[1:29:36] it becomes a way of life
[1:29:38] with you where really you put your hands
[1:29:40] in his and says god
[1:29:42] you must take my hand today because i
[1:29:43] can't see where the future goes
[1:29:45] god you have to take my hand today
[1:29:47] because things have come up and all of
[1:29:48] us i don't know what to do lord so you
[1:29:50] have to lead me
[1:29:51] and you have to guide me you have to
[1:29:52] take care of me and and
[1:29:54] and you will do that and you'll find
[1:29:56] he's more than willing to do that
[1:29:59] it's when you get like the other one in
[1:30:01] havoc of well i can do this myself and
[1:30:02] god says fine you go ahead and do it
[1:30:04] i'll just
[1:30:05] stand back and laugh you know
[1:30:09] it just becomes a way of life and that's
[1:30:11] the condition i think the church will be
[1:30:13] in
[1:30:14] just before the coming of the lord
[1:30:18] so the rapture will just go right on
[1:30:20] that way just a
[1:30:21] regular routine of following the
[1:30:23] scriptures
[1:30:24] and the plan of god and we're there
[1:30:30] we're there this is where we have to
[1:30:34] come
[1:30:35] this is what god's been trying to drum
[1:30:36] into my head for the last two years
[1:30:38] this is where i have to come in my
[1:30:40] relationship with him
[1:30:42] i have to come to the place where i've
[1:30:43] watched him every single day
[1:30:45] over and over and over again situations
[1:30:48] arise i had no control over and
[1:30:50] okay lord what do you want us to do now
[1:30:53] lord i'm trusting you because i don't
[1:30:54] have the answer for this
[1:30:57] and then he does he takes care of it
[1:31:00] and he said this is where it has to come
[1:31:02] just before
[1:31:03] the rapture we the bride must come to
[1:31:07] the place
[1:31:08] where we totally rest and trust
[1:31:11] in our god amen brother chad
[1:31:15] i just want to say praise god i was
[1:31:18] greatly edified by the word tonight
[1:31:21] and there was such a good reminder of
[1:31:23] where we're supposed to be living amen
[1:31:26] oh i thank god for that reminder you
[1:31:29] know i was thinking the whole time that
[1:31:31] he was talking i kept thinking about
[1:31:32] the relationship between husband and
[1:31:34] wife and how the wife just
[1:31:36] trusts that a husband's going to take
[1:31:38] care of her and christ is our husband
[1:31:40] and
[1:31:40] i don't think it's very i don't think it
[1:31:43] shows much faith and appreciation for
[1:31:45] him if we're constantly worried whether
[1:31:46] or not christ will take care of us
[1:31:49] i just want to be able to say he
[1:31:52] promised me
[1:31:53] and i trusted him and the wife becomes
[1:31:56] the reflection of the husband
[1:31:58] and our faith in him and our rest
[1:32:00] becomes a reflection
[1:32:02] of what a wonderful husband he is
[1:32:05] and i praise god i want to show what a
[1:32:07] wonderful husband he is
[1:32:10] not by wringing my hands and being
[1:32:11] nervous and being fearful every time
[1:32:13] something happens
[1:32:14] but i want to have such a confidence in
[1:32:15] him that i can reflect him
[1:32:18] because i trust him so much to take care
[1:32:20] of it and i know he's going to do
[1:32:21] something
[1:32:22] special i was thinking of
[1:32:25] sister marcia and her testimony she came
[1:32:27] down sunday for prayer
[1:32:29] and she prayed because she had these
[1:32:31] test results to read and and
[1:32:33] she had heard something that they were
[1:32:34] concerned about before and she didn't
[1:32:36] want to hear any bad news
[1:32:37] and after we prayed you remember what i
[1:32:38] told you sister marsha
[1:32:40] i said look forward to going and hearing
[1:32:42] the results
[1:32:45] look forward to going and hearing the
[1:32:47] results and praise god
[1:32:49] she got good results amen
[1:32:52] i think that's the approach we need to
[1:32:54] have all the time i'm looking forward to
[1:32:56] see what he'll do
[1:32:57] boy this is a bad situation this is
[1:32:59] terrible i can't wait to see what he
[1:33:01] does this time
[1:33:03] this is impossible it can't be fixed boy
[1:33:05] i can't wait to see what he'll do this
[1:33:07] time
[1:33:08] i want to live there amen i've not lived
[1:33:10] there like i want to but i want to live
[1:33:12] there
[1:33:13] praise god god bless you brother and
[1:33:15] always good to have you i appreciate the
[1:33:17] word
[1:33:18] amen remember to keep praying for
[1:33:19] brother nolan sister shirley

[1:49:56] by our praise
[1:49:59] as we glory
[1:50:05] in your embrace
[1:50:12] as your presence
[1:50:17] now fills this place
