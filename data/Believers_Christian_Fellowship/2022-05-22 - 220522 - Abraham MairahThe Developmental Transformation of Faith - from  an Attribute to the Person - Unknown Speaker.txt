on and on and on but amen we're looking forward to a day like that but this is the day that we take everything god gives us and we don't blow it out the whistle it's steam but it goes into power to make the wheels turn so these weekends like this are to bring something to us to give us strength to give us power so that we can go and serve the purpose that god has for us in this life amen so i thank god that he's been good to us strengthened us give us his word give us strength and now i want to yield my life to him to turn around and go out into the world and live his life amen surrendered to him and i appreciate everybody who's made this weekend happen all who labored and worked for the fellowships and those who hosted visitors god bless you we thank you for the visitors who come to be with us you're very welcome we've enjoyed having you and enjoyed fellowshipping together we just pray that god will bless you as many have to travel back today and tomorrow may god keep you on your journey and it's been good to be together also brother abraham will be traveling for the uh for probably about another four weeks he's traveling and visiting several different places in the united states and preaching and having meetings so just continue to hold him up in prayer this is just his first stop of several so we pray that god will use him in every stop and god will bless him encourage him and strengthen him amen so let's remember to keep him in prayer amen are you eager for the word this morning when the when the revealed word is your bridegroom you just love him more and more and you can't get enough of him amen amen when god is unveiling himself you just want him to keep unveiling himself i want to see i want to see more of christ than i did yesterday man i want more i want to be more of a partaker so i'm looking forward to the word this morning let's just turn our hearts and our attention towards the lord and receive what he has for us today and then we're going to invite our brother abraham to come take his liberty this is the last service so as far as i'm concerned whatever he hasn't preached yet he can preach it all this morning whatever he had to skip over before let's not skip it over and bedtime's a long ways away amen so we can stay in fellowship around the world amen god bless you let's sing brother man into [Music] the chamber be free [Music] speak to me gently [Music] is [Music] i even want screeching in the name of jesus christ and if everybody is doing fine what else can we do because we are a trophies of his sacrifice his love and we thank god that we are one of of those that he has saved throughout you know christian though and um certainly maybe you'll be seated for a moment a minute i just wanted to appreciate all of you and especially the grace of god and of course pastor chad for inviting me of course if he doesn't invite me i can't come so so he's the key here so yeah so i can't forget that so sometimes i ask him why do you invite me what do you think i i have but maybe you know like we were interrupting some kind of serious talk one time a day migration first time i think i came to the us and that immigration officials asking me can you tell me why they had to invite you to come and preach in the united states don't we have preachers in the u.s so i was like my guest is as good as yours i also don't know why they invited me they say i'm serious you have to tell me why do they have to invite you all the way from uganda i said i guess it's because i also invited him and maybe he wanted me also over here he said i can't understand you have to explain more so he went on and went on and went and he was really insisting and he asked me questions about my view about the trinity and blabla it was quite funny so and then he kept checking my bible to see if i've ever marked it or i'm some kind of mascaretta pretending to be a preacher so then eventually he said i don't believe you're a preacher although your bible is marked i said well you get a room i preached to you as someone and then his friend was smiling at him you know and if you want to prove our preacher then we get somewhere i preach you someone and you'll believe i'm a preacher so and then it went on he was insisting and then i said i think to answer your question let me also ask you a question you know kind of what i was preaching the other day the other night jesus answering the question with the question so i said you people in europe and america here you are always signing players from africa i mean you you you you support a good talent of a footballer a good runner whatever you get them from africa and you bring them here and they play for you and when they score it's not nigeria or ghana or cameroon or uganda scoring it's britain it's america is it because you don't have men here who can play football so his friend said today you got more than a match [Applause] so i said i guess should be the same way the same you know where it applies maybe the brother has seen something that's why he wanted me to come not because i'm special not because i'm better than the americans so well i was just on the point that i don't know why brother chad keeps inviting but me i know why will invite him so so but i am certainly humbled by your love and your concern and especially for those who have come from different places i i was really you know humbled my brothers who've come all the way i can see my friend you know who traveled from canada is it toronto is it and others have come from very far and then i was like my who am i this brothers came and sisters from verify so may god bless you so much and the saints here at lima you know that you have a special place in my heart in our hearts back home we have you and we always pray for you the best gift that you can give me is if i can see you in the rapture if i can see your face that that particular moment when and then we shall say you made it brother you married sister all that we've gone through all that you hear all that it doesn't matter but what matters is when you are there and nobody will ever push you back nobody will say you didn't qualify to come to heaven go back you have made it and no brother brahma says we are going to meet there are people we didn't expect and then the people that you expect to be there will not be there so maybe someone doesn't expect you'll be there but you'll be there and i think that is the best thing if you are a surprise to that person that he didn't expect you to be there but then you are there so just have a good deal with your god you are with your lord that lord i want to be there i want to be one of those maybe people don't want maybe some people would not be comfortable if i'm there but i don't know that he doesn't even have to consult anybody to take you there and he never consulted anybody in saving you he doesn't even make an application to your family if he wants to save you so he did it and we really love the lord thank the lord for that so it has really been a privilege for me and uh limas turned out to be something special for me so i appreciate sister angie you know she's always very busy knocking things up and down and burning her fingers you know just to make me comfortable and um they are just a special couple i appreciate them and and then well maybe you don't see that but me i see it so so i i really appreciate them and the whole family and and the youngest is always my closest friend there i always say yeah so i was enjoying the fellowship with them so certainly friends i may not have time to meet each one of you but you know that you're special to me in my heart and they will always list for your prayers that you pray for us we pray for one another we don't expect to stay here so long no we are going home we are already in the thing the move is on so may god bless you so much and maybe we can stand up and have a word of prayer loving heavenly father i want to thank you for such a good morning that you've given us and the privilege to be in the house of the lord for there are many who have wanted to be there but maybe they have been impeded by all forms of obstacles sicknesses accidents emergencies the lord we thank you that you gave us the grace to be here thank you the lord you've been gracious and manifested yourself and to us in the last two evenings and now we are here this morning the day that lord you conquer death hell grave and you rose and you put a difference between you and all men and we are grateful and never shall we be grateful enough that lord god you included us in this program of resurrection and i'm praying that god this morning you'll anoint your servant and may we experience the power of your resurrection the flow of the holy spirit the flow of your word have your way with your children and bless us with the very blessing of your princes lord we shall be careful to give you all your praise and honor would you not lord stretch forth your hand to touch the sick the afflicted the tormented lord to encourage the depressed and lord god restore those who are meandering moving away from the way encourages lord speak to us because you are the comforter and lord may we be encouraged by your word granted father anoint your servant and lord once more speak to your children in jesus name we pray amen while we are still standing i think i wanted to read some scripture here in the book of romans which i'll have to compare it with other scriptures i think which are you allow me to read before you see it in romans chapter three from verse one to three it says what advantage then have they do or what prophet is there of circumcision much every way she flee because that unto them were committed the oracles of god for what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect god forbid yeah let god be true but every man a liar i cannot just end there and we got the book of james chapter 2 verse 1. james chapter 2 verse 1 he says my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ the lord of glory with respect of persons and finally in the book of luke chapter 18 luke chapter 18 verse 8 i want to pick just part b which says nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on earth may god bless his word and bless you may be seated i think we know very well one of the purposes of the malachi foreign ministry was to restore the children back to the faith of their fathers the apostles and faith is very important of course when i talk about faith i'm talking about revelation and the prophet says the importance of revelation can never be overemphasized and then the bible comes and brings a very strong statement of about faith and says faith is our victory and without victory we are not going to sit with christ in his throne because revelation 3 verse 21 he says he that overcometh shall i grant that you'll sit with me in my throne like i have overcome and i'm sat with my father in his throne now i mean the bible doesn't say on my throat in my throne i mean you don't sit in the throne you sit on but the bible uses the word in because it's a domain it's not a regular seat so that throne is a domain so you sit in but now before you can sit where he sat or where he's sitting you must overcome and how do you overcome you overcome by faith and then it would be like common sense it could be like a generally accepted statement that all message believers have got faith and yes they have got faith but we are not going to overcome by the faith that we have got because the faith that you've got you can lose it that's why you have had people men of faith women of faith believers who believed the word just like when i was here the last time i was talking about that scripture in romans chapter 10 verse 17 which says faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god not hearing the word of god but by the word of god so faith comes by hearing and hearing the word so you hear the word by the word not by the ear because if it was just hearing by the ear everybody who hears the word of god preached would have faith but there are those who can sit hundreds maybe not hundreds tens and tens of years hearing the word being preached by they don't have that particular faith that overcomes the world until the world eventually overcomes them and you wonder why the world overcame them and yet they had faith in the world because when you got the bible in the book of mark i think if i can i have some some time to read that if you go to the book of monks chapter 9 mark chapter 9 we see the wickednesses the limitations of money faith because here he says in mark chapter 9 verse 23 jesus says unto him if thou cast believe all things are possible to them that to him that believeth and then you look at this man answering from the sincerity of his heart and he says straight away the father of the child cried out and said we tears lord i believe help thou my unbelief so the faith of a human being is always mixed with unbelief and they're afraid to fail i believe help my own belief so today i'm talking about the developmental transformation of faith you can put a dash from an attribute or a vacuum to the person because when we come here this man is saying i believe but help my unbelief and jesus actually just helped him his faith was not sufficient but he believed that's why he brought his daughter to jesus he believed jesus could heal him that's why you have come that's why we are here we believe the world we believe the message but we have to go beyond faces to develop you are not going to remain with the other faith that you started when having when you came to believe this message if you remain like that you will fail and that's why many like we have been following it up this week have always believed and ended on the office of the prophet the prophet said this the prophet said this the prophet said this and then if there is something that they think is not rhyming up right then they begin to fault the prophet like we're saying and this is just he was a victim like i'm a victim i cannot preach as a victim unlike you a victim and if we are victims who is the culprit are we going to make god a culprit because you never chose yourself you never brought yourself you never looked for god god looked for you and and god served you i never made myself a preacher like you know we saw yesterday amos was saying i was a gatherer of scammer fruit i was a husband i had my own plans and god followed me and called me and made me a prophet so i'm a victim man amaziah leave me alone i only come with that say the lord when he sends me if he doesn't send me i'm as dumb as anybody i have nothing of myself of my own of my only making but if the lion has sword if the lord god has spoken who can but prophesy glory be to god now i want us to look at this like paul is saying for what if some of them did not believe they did not believe what they claim to believe and they thought they believed but they didn't believe because they thought they believed i'm not good tanker twister because english knows my language but i think you are looking at what i'm thinking what i'm saying that's because they thought they believed that's how they failed to believe and i don't want you to sit here and think you believe and then you are defeated by you have ever thought thinking that you believe when you don't believe so what is the faith what is the faith that will overcome the world because the prophet says you come to receive the word by our faith that's an attribute something that god put in you that's why you say today i'm going to believe oh when you hear the word of god something deep in you clicks and tells you this is the truth but yes because you know this the truth doesn't make it the faith that will overcome the world and that's why very many people he had a bible being preached and they know this is the truth they know this message is true but that's not enough somehow somewhere they hit a snag on their kaput finished and then you begin to wonder this man i thought i had faith i thought his brother was strong i thought his sister was strong what was the problem they are in to develop so now it has to be god's own prevailing faith that's as fading faith so today we are trying to look at this because i want you to look at this as the bible saying jesus said when the son of man cometh shall he find faith he doesn't say hell shall he find a church with faith shalom shall he find believe us shall he find men of faith preachers of faith no shall he find faith so faith is identified as a person oh brother abraham i have a lot of faith you can have a lot of faith but today and then tomorrow you can have a lot of unbelief that's why we are getting shaken up by some of the things that are happening around the world you wake up and you hear like it's out of the blue something has happened and you wonder if this man this great man you know in africa they have a language especially south africa and like nigeria and zimbabwe they love the the one man of god you know great man of god man of faith and then tomorrow you wake up a great man of god is finished what happened what's going on something's wrong somewhere but you have to look at this because when you come here the bible is saying in the book of romans as we read the bible saying let's just look closely at vastly he says for what if somebody did not believe and yet you thought they believed or they thought they believed just because they were used by nature they received the oracles that's too that's what he was saying what made them stand out from the rest of the world they received the oracles of god were committed under them just like with the message has been committed on to us we have it we hate we receive it it's here but that's that guarantee that because you have received the oracles the word of god does it make you a believer does it make you faith no what about the children of israel when they left egypt whether they believe us they will believe us but where did the any belief that was manifested in the wilderness come from yet they left us believers of the message of moses but out of the believers of the message only two men they reached the promised land some things somewhere there a mystery so he says much as the oracles were given to them what if some of them didn't believe yet the oracles have been given they have the oracle what if some did not believe now listen shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect now he doesn't serve the faith of the church it's not the faith of the church anymore it's not the faith of the believer anymore it's the faith of god so what is going to stand what's going to prevail it will be the faith of god in the midst of all any belief perfect and belief whether the whole world is unbelievers but the faith of god is a man in a woman in that girl and that boy will stand and it will have its effect regardless so what is required now is not the faith of mahera the faith of brother chad the faith of brother kyle brother and so the faith of sister so and so that sister has got faith her brother has got faith oh brother i have great faith i have a faith i have faith today you have faith tomorrow you are weakening today you are very strong in the faith tomorrow you are weak oh brother my faith has dwindled why you just heard it you had an attribute but now it has to go to the person and this person called the faith will not bother will not be intimidated will not be silenced will not be subdued by any any belief by any opposition by all doubts because the faith of god himself god himself in a human being god believing his own word like brother abraham said it's not you is the believers the holy ghost they believe in you it's not you you cannot that's why those who use their brains cannot they go somewhere so far so good and so far so hard and now i give up so the faith has to develop otherwise we are doomed like you have seen so many doomed and i think it's happening our eyes to realize that not all who say they had their faith had that real faith they had the faith of just having beneficiaries recipients of the oracles that were committed unto them like the oracles were given to the children of israel but not all of them who received the oracles had faith so the bible is very clear here what if some didn't what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect god forbid every man is a lawyer a liar a faker a masquerader a pretender every man will try to show you that he's right every man will try to show you that he's serious every man even you yourself can deceive yourself you can try to encourage yourself come on man i'm a man of god come on i think i love god i think i think of the elect said it i should be that pride i think if i hold my hands like this and clap maybe if i go down on my knees and pray i think i should be a believer you can deceive by yourself by those kind of whatever it is but when it's going to happen according to you and that's what the purpose of all this preaching has been going on you see like you have been showing here a quote on the screen jesus had the perfect faith because he was the one and when you keep receiving the word receiving the word you become the word and when the word becomes you then the faith perfect faith of jesus christ himself is tough and according to you because jesus had perfect faith because he was the fullness of the words and the fullness of the word in its entirety in you forms faith and that's why time comes you begin to see people beginning to doubt part of the word and yet there were men of faith in the word so what happens they don't have the faith they don't have the faith of god they have their own faith and because they have their own faith they have their own revelation and they begin to talk about their own revelation the way they know they see this they see that they see that because they have their own faith but when you have the faith of god you have god it's revelation when you have the faith of jesus you have the revelation of jesus christ and you become the unfailing of jesus christ the uninvading of god the word and what are you living for you are living for the unevading of the words you are no longer yourself you are no longer for yourself you are no longer for your interests it's just the animating of the words faith of god from an attribute from a vacuum to a person now let us look at this so the fact is established and james the pastor of jerusalem what did he say he says don't have the faith of jesus christ don't have the faith of our lord jesus christ with that is the lord of glory with respect of persons you know we had a lot of respect of persons in the message who is who who to deal with who not to deal with who qualifies who doesn't qualify and then there was a lot of major wraps let's go to second corinthians i want to show you something here that is always synonymous with many faith secret corinthians 7 10 let's begin from verse 12 he says for we dare not make ourselves of the number so in the days of paul there was a number and paul the messenger was now already excluded from that number because he doesn't say i am part of the number the messenger he say we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that command themselves they command themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves they don't measure themselves by christ but they measure themselves by themselves the revelation according to brother son so if you preach it like him if you don't hey they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves hey they are prudent isn't it they are intellectual they are spiritual they are perfect no they are not wise but they think they are wise because they are trying to set a certain measure you have to be like the other one or you are nothing so whatever you do you are compared by the other one measured by the other one preach it like him be like him talk like him present it like him or you're nothing you have to be of that number and if you don't come to that number you are nothing but jesus says the five-fold ministry brings us to the stage of the measure of the fullness of christ so now the backsliding comes right in the minister of paul and paul is saying he's excluded from that number they were already those preachers who were already in a particular number numbered and you have to be part of that number if you are to be amounting to anything if you don't you are not included in that number you are nothing and paul says we dare not i dare not who are they we paul is talking about the rejected ones i must go and preach it there out here like we've seen yesterday we dare not make ourselves of their number or compare ourselves with some that command themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves comparing themselves among themselves are not wise listen but we will not boast of things without our measure but according to the measure of the rule which god has distributed to us a measure to reach even unto you blessed be the name of the lord so paul was keeping himself within the confines of the means of the rule that god had given him but others had gone to the measure that man had said and when you want to live a life of the faith set faith measure set by man and then you are comfortable within that realm and you think because i'm fulfilling the measures the requirements of the faith measure that man has set i am okay for you and then you begin to compare yourself among others in that number and then you measure up you try to square up and say yes i think i'm almost like him i'm almost like him so some of these backslidings going around that's some of these shocker events i just opened our eyes to know that there is no man you should measure up to there is no man's faith you can copy and paste no man is lifestyle there is only one man who never failed and that is jesus christ and that's the faith of jesus christ that you have to get in here glory be to god okay now in verse 14 he says for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure so god knows there is a certain measure you are supposed to be and within that measure he is able to give you sufficient grace to receive that faith the faith of jesus christ the faith of god but you are there business stretching yourself beyond the measure god gave you wasting time and paul is saying we stretching out ourselves beyond our measure as though we reach not unto you for we have come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel in other words god has come as far as use this simple local ministry to come as far as to you and then you have received the preaching of the gospel you know this word there's something beyond the life of man that you need now blessed be the name of the lord and then he says in an animal 15 he says not bursting of things without that is outside our measure beyond our measure that is of other main israelis so and so labeled so and so was great so and so was powerful yes that was his measure so keep keep referring to it to your own parent that's not you god deals with individuals he doesn't deal with groups i remain his labors i am under the minister of son so i i the other man of god is so decent that that is another man laboring that is not your measure that's not your portion where is your abortion what have you done where are you standing what is your relationship with god there is no man who is going to be like a booster for network that you have to connect through him to god oh i wish you know i i don't know how to bring it may god help me not bursting you know of things without or outside damage that is of other main is neighbors but having hope now listen he's writing to believers these corinthians were believers this is already a church but listen what he says having hope that when your faith is increased developed growing into that which is supposed to be they were already believers of the message so they didn't have that faith by default like the baptist would want to tell you that when you believe you receive the holy spirit no have you received the holy spirit since not when you believed hey and then there are those who say when you receive the word you've received it you've got the faith you don't need anything no when your faith is increased how does it increase the word growing in you as you keep receiving the word becoming the word you are becoming the faith because faith is the word so he says when your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly now who is going to analyze the minister of paul you who is going to enlighten the minister of william branham the recipients of the message when the word increases on the face of god the faith of jesus whom he introduced gets established so it's no longer the church believing now you stop putting there your ideologies your thinking your feelings your likes and dislikes and you let him have his way let him believe his word let him do what he wants to do forget about you what you know the doctor told me abcd if the bible says by his tribes i am healed and if i am i is if i am i is if that is english anyway i stop thinking i don't put there my mind i don't even think about the pain i don't think about the fact that i'm still lame if the world says i'm healed i is that it let him let him take over that it's not me believing his word is himself bringing the word and with him all things are possible i just step back i i just say cast be my thoughts i remove them my feelings what i know blessed be the name of the lord glory be to god and he says this is i mean this is the reason that you know we must have fooled in him you know we must be found in him and this is what paulus provost let me give you just a couple more scriptures and then we shall proceed when you come to revelation i mean philippians philippians chapter three let's see paul's wish philippians chapter 3 verse 9 he says and be phone in him be found in him not having my own righteousness and of course you know righteousness is faith abraham believed the god and it was imputed unto him for faith not having my own righteousness my own faith which is of the law that's the letter i have the word i know the word i read the message i listen to tips so that is the reason that that's what that's the evidence that i have faith no that's yours but that which is through the faith of christ who is christ the anointed one the anointed word not a dominant word a word in action so that faith of christ active faith faith is a fact but faith is also an act not having my own righteousness which is of the lord a letter but i which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith which face the faith of christ in you and if if we got also revelation chapter 14 and and maybe end it there with scriptures then we continue somewhere else if you find here in revelation chapter 14 verse 12 revelation 14 12 this is what he says here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commands of commandments of god and the faith of jesus keep it not the faith of our church our church we believe this no not the faith of the messiah believers but the faith of jesus keep it patiently glory be to god so they handle belief of some who claim to believe that means you can put in brackets they make believers and unbelievers they claim what if some did not believe does it stop you who has the faith of god in operation no we shall keep moving on now let me go on something i want us to you know to lay foundation on strongly let's go to the book of jude judy verse 3 it's jordan just one chapter beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you all free common salvation i don't know about america but back then in africa everybody wants to say praise the lord even catholics these days and protesters everywhere on the field praise the lord we thank god we are saved by grace god is good all the time and all the time god is good and that is man is nature come on well that is common salvation but there is something packaged within within it and he says it was needful for me to write unto you and to exalt you now listen that you should honestly contend for their faith not our faith that faith that's the faith of jesus christ which was delivered unto the saints and i want you to mark everybody there that faith which was delivered not manufactured not developed by man in other words it was a product made from heaven and put in a delivery van and the delivery van brought it and delivered to you [Applause] made somewhere else not made me in the pca fellowship here made there and then delivered not to the hypocrites make believers not to the church members not the believers but to the saints sanctified ones [Music] yeah so look at the criteria criteria now faith that was once delivered to the saints glory to god and i want us to look at this carefully who delivered this faith who delivered it we know to whom it was delivered and that it was once delivered and that we should contend for it but who delivered the faith once delivered today this faith is not given to sinners hypocrites making believers or any believers only given to say it's fine faith this faith is a heavenly product that was only delivered to saints fine we know it was made but now god had to pro fight a delivery van to deliver the faith oh i wish i was a good preacher let's see here the prophet says somewhere here he says god did it god did it per person don't worry god is good time wheels are moving just for faith in the order it's it's not god out of order it's you and i who is out of order is what does it and then he says as far as i know that's the only place in the bible that we are asked to contend but that was to contend for not our faith our faith but our faith don't contain for our faith that is somebody's faith human being's faith the faith of those in the number particular number special number but the faith that was once delivered to the saints and the prophet continues to say therefore the spirit that was in jesus was like all the water in the world and a gift of the spirit from jesus like a spoonful of the same water but the chemicals that is in the entire ocean is in that spoonful of water it's the same chemicals not just much of it we have it by major he had it without measure and then he says of course um genuine faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word so god in his great economy this is now me the end of quote keeps spinning the wheels of his word he keeps spinning the wheels of his word for the maturity of faith in the blood of believers so it becomes the like precious faith cut across like measure same faith same measure we only have measures when it is our level of faith but when it comes to that one is same faith because all of us need that same faith for the body church and then we shall receive the end of faith one of these days we shall not need faith when we go in the rapture we shall not need the faith we shall receive that's what the bible says in hebrews receiving the end of your faith but when before we that which will prepare us to receiving the end of faith is that faith which is like precious faith cut across that's what peter says in ii peter chapter one verse one now let me bring here quickly this so he says so it had to be this side had to be decided with sanctification because the church is referred to as saints the word saint means the sanctified one in other words we must contend for the faith that was once delivered to the sanctified one and he he puts it in singular not sanctified ones sanctification means to be called out set apart cleansed see cleansed and set apart for service now he says now the faith that was once delivered unto those people that's the faith that we are supposed to contend for you know what content means is to debate or to hold or to contend or you know fight for now some say well they must but messages we breathe we say we do you have it yes we have got that faith brett baptist say the baptist brethren yep the catholic says yep the pentecostals say yep everybody will say yes my church is contending for that faith that was in the days of the prophet now we bring it in our day every message in church says we are contending for that faith because my interest is not so much now outside there my interest is you that's why i'm here now let's go to this something special here so now let's go back in the other part of the scripture the army ministry and in the days of the saints this is the prophet saying and see what kind of faith they had and then it is let us contend for what they had that is the only way to be sure is that right and then he says now the first one to introduce the faith that the bible wants us to contend before was the lord jesus christ himself so he was goddess deliverer fan the one who introduced that faith john was the foreigner to speak of it coming but now they want to introduce that faith that the bible wants us to contend for was the lord jesus christ so jesus christ introduces that faith and then listen john was the foreigner to speak of it coming but christ was it so christ was their faith christ was it was that faith and christ was the introducer he was the deliverable and he was the deliverer of himself that's the faith so if you must have the faith who are you going to have you are going to have christ in you not just being a church member very thank you very much for being a good church member god bless you otherwise i would be preaching to you cheers here thank you for coming you are special i must appreciate you for that but that's not enough so part one who was the faith jesus christ himself who introduced it who was god is delivering jesus himself jesus was the delivery of one that delivered the faith from heaven to us to the saints the fullness of the word made flesh the word was god and the word became flesh and dwelt among us so the word becomes flesh again that's what you contain this for oh pastor pray for me i want to have faith i want to have more faith my faith is too little content for the world to become flesh in you no one is going to pray for you to have more faith you are supposed to contend you not to be prayed for but to content struggle fights get it so if god says content that means he has already equipped you with the capability to contend you are just the one sitting back and you think you can't do it pastor i don't have faith i don't you don't need to have faith you just have to be the temple of faith when a faith comes and dwells in you that's it just like paul says me i'm crucified with christ nevertheless i live so the life now that i'm leaving is not me leaving but it's jesus christ who reverse enemy glory of god so i'm awakening i'm a failure i'm a wretch of nothing nevertheless faith live within me it's not me who believes it's himself who believes is what i don't put there my mind i don't put there my thinking my thoughts my you know my desires i have just pulled back i'm dead he lives content for that glory to god christ was christ was who christ was the faith christ himself he was the one who brought the faith listen he was the one who brought the faith and he was it this is the message honestly containing for the faith so christ is the one himself he was the one who brought the faith because christ on earth was god's representation to the peoples now listen to the peoples on the new deal hallelujah so there is a new deal man [Applause] we are candidates for the new deal what is the new deal you just stop everything you end everything and he comes and takes over and it's not you nmo forget about yourself just surrender to him let him come and live in you and let him do what he wants to be done and that's god's new deal and that deal will not fail [Music] the other deal of the law lord i know the 10 commandments i know the laws of the torah i know this i know the message i wrote this quote i read this one i know this quote the prophet said this and then i was back he also said it is here and then you begin to scratch your head i think there is some problem because you are now bringing in your minds [Laughter] we are now in a new deal the new deal is you stop everything you receive the word the word has to come and the word has to be very new in its fullness and the word is faith of itself can you imagine when the word believes itself when the word believes itself and when the word manifests itself then when the word controls itself and when the word in you moves the way it wants to move when the word shows its glory when the word trusts power and then you are sitting there just saying amen do it lord hallelujah thank you lord thank you jesus it's you now lord me i'm a failure continue lord glory be to god and he says oh this just this is another message door to the heart oh there's just a lot of those doors let's find the door of faith close these other doors close these other channels then he says he brings in like in a quarter form and says now i have faith but don't you go to fooling with my faith that's what people say don't fool with my faith there's a lot of people who are going to fool with it even yourself can fool with it you can play a lot of games with your own faith glory to god but he says there is only one faith there is only one faith and that is the faith of god did we read it right these others are irrelevant as if they don't even exist oh i have faith i have i know you just have nothing god doesn't even recognize it heaven doesn't even recognize it oh the other brother if i can only be like please that is nothing glory to god there is only one faith just like there is only one lord jesus christ there is only one faith there is only one god one faith one lord one baptism glory to god [Applause] one faith that is the faith of god that's right and in the message there's another message here which is called be not afraid is how he says there is only one faith and that's the faith of god that's right god is faith god is faith you are human faith don't go very far you watch human faith don't go very far you go a little way you struggle on and struggle and faster i'm trying to press on i'm trying my wife let's try to you know things are hard but we must try you know you know you don't go far you watch human faith don't go very far but god is faith in you what does it look makes me laugh every bird makes me laugh everybody i mean because nobody will do me harm nobody can now bother me so whether you hate me you call me all sorts of names whether you call me not stupid foolish idiots i'll just not care because i don't exist actually i don't even exist [Applause] then you say what you want to say abuse me what you want to abuse i'll just love you anybody anyhow i don't care i'm just the dump the temple of faith it doesn't affect my faith my faith cannot now be affected but it has a lot of effect it has a lot of effect the faith of god will not be stifled their unbelief will not impede the faith of god shall it make the faith of god without effect no it will keep being effective but their unbelief will it affect the faith of god no way their words the amazings huh oh you call him a messiah whatever it is you know whatever go away don't prophesy here don't preach here this don't bring this here don't mention this here no problem no problem makes no problem no no it doesn't matter to me i just it makes you love everybody makes you laugh makes me love everybody everybody and the prophet says that's right that's what god is god's faith does to you makes you have the same feeling that jesus did oh same feeling some feeling that jesus did because the spirit of christ is new and now i want to bring you something which is a shocker here the prophet says here i think in the message where i think pentecost fame he says when you receive the holy ghost everything you have got need of between here and glory is right in you then when you receive the bible you know the holy spirit everything that you have need of between here name it now count it what do you need can you mention ionic everything that you have need of as long as you receive the holy spirit so it's very important to know whether you have him in you oh i'm the bride i'm the bride okay what proves where's the husband you are not the bride until the bridegroom has come and until you have united with him so don't take it presumptuous sin you must be sure so when you receive the holy ghost everything you have enough between now between here and glory is right in you then it ain't the faith that you need when you have the holy spirit in you you don't need the faith i'm reading your prophet it is the faith that you need you've already got faith because faith is the person of the holy spirit so when you receive the holy spirit when you receive christ in you you have already got faith so you don't need faith how do you need water of god [Applause] does it make sense in your english you've already got something and you need it no you've got faith you've got the holy spirit now he for he is your faith the holy spirit in you the person of christ in you is your faith now he said where your problem is but the thing you have to know is to know how to use that faith how to use just like you have any machine you bought it it's good but have you already this manual you misused it it will trouble you you can cut off your finger and you throw it off you can curse it yet you got it you are the one who bought it you have it but you should know how to use it that's why every device comes with a menu and they will always tell you before you use this thing please please read this manual carefully make sure you understand how it operates that's where we have a problem how to use faith how many believe here they have the holy spirit so when you have the holy spirit you have got faith you don't need faith faith is laying down and they are getting arrested doing nothing it's always crying out you know wanting to get into some action it's dormant and you are there oh i wish i got faith and god is looking at you say what what do you want me to do for you you when you have the holy ghost when you have the personal impression you've got your faith he is your faith but the thing that you have to know is how to use that faith see what i mean and if you'll just understand how to use it now the prophet says which we will try to this coming week to explain it you will see the exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ask or think for the lord to do that means you get the things things will begin to just work out and say so all along i had this like the third pool like when brother branham created this creature squirrels you thought he knew he has power to create he did but when god says do you want squirrels yes yes how many three speak and i say well the first one should be there before he could finish pointing the thing was there and then he rubbed his why did he rub his eyes the creator was already with him but he didn't know how to use and when to use god didn't come like with a pump and begin pumping him now i'm giving you the power to create oh you go and fast some three days the creator was already there the word think of brethren the word that sparkled the universe into existence all the stars the word that created every animal every bird every flower every fish everything the word is but you are scared you are you are failing to put it into use that you want some someone to push you into it rather and then maybe pray for you and shake it a bit and you feel hey i was shaking the preacher prayed until my body vibrated now i believe i think i'll be healed you have it in you you have it in your friend but just to use it that's the problem that's what you have to pray for content for that the operation guidelines of their faith that's in me [Music] but their faith is already there brother you don't need faith you got it i i i think one time i mentioned the hair statement i said peter costas who don't even believe baptism in jesus name can you pray for the sick they can pray for the lame and they walk in other words in essence they are not even saved he that believes and these baptists shall be saved but their baptism is in error so the unsaved they can pray for the lamb and they walk because they have faith what about me who is faith for them they have some measure of faith blessed be the name of the lord that is part a i'm now done with the party let me go to part b this faith special faith was delivered to the saints but when it was delivered to the saints listen once goods are delivered there has to be some offloaders eh do you know jesus said it on the purpose go you make the world of disciples for me and baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and the holy spirit that was a package that was a writing an inscription on a box so when you are going to the shop to buy you don't buy a whole box they are those people who offload a nanny pack and get the item that you need and that's the 5 40 ministry and that's why the devil is fighting two areas he's fighting faith in the world and they fight for the ministry some of these things are in the bible they are in the message you all have message books you all have the bible but you cannot pick them out there are riddles until a gift from five four minutes to fix it out and makes it plain and makes it clear and when you got to a shop you got different you know what you call what like supermarkets you call them what is the way you call them in america they say where you call it so you go to this you go to that you go to that you go to different places and buy different things and you gather them in your house and you call them my property but they never came from one shop and not one day you went to the campaign you bought a bed you bought this you bought a cupboard you bought this yes that is a carpenter then you went to the other shop you bought a mattress you bought pillows you bought bedsheets you bought a blanket you bought that so this has to unite with this to make a bed but you never bought them from one shop but then eventually it will be a complete house and it will be your property then you went to another shop you bought you know you you bought spoons and you know these and plates and cookers and what and all those things and kitchenware and all the table etiquette all the requirements you put it there then there's where you go to buy food that is where you buy spices but the things when they are coming from the factory they don't come in the volume that you buy them they are delivered to those big places and then the workers and parker them offroad and honey park and then they display for the buyer to come and buy now you have come to bcf shop and the holy spirit is displaying some goodies for you to buy today when brother chad is preaching he has also his own maybe for him he has also he displays something else a little bit different for me another one will come and display something else and you keep buying and the bible say buy and never sell it you can buy you keep buying big buy and it becomes u.s [Applause] until it becomes a complete home complete house five-fold ministry that's why this the faith in the word or the faith of jesus christ and the five-fold ministry are under attack i was asking one brother i said well i have no problem with listening to tips i listen to tips the church should listen to the tips of the prophet read the books of the prophet but i mean you cannot tell me to sit down not preaching where would you have got these people whom you want just to sit down to listen to a trap if god didn't use a man to unpack the boxes from the message and preach them even in the local language which they don't understand english why are you interested in putting down the foreign foreign ministry brother branham was not against the 540 minister the faith was delivered okay it's delivered to the shops fine who is going to any park who is going to display who is going to make it easier for a person to peak in one sermon god makes sure there are so many things there someone says to me i go to this the other one said to me i got this they don't send me i got this god spoke to me this god also spoke to me this oh god they answered my prayer oh i came with the question me i was sick i was healed me i had a problem in marriage right there are many things in there someone but it's the displaying capability of the holy spirit through a gift so he gave some to the apostles are prophets teachers vangris you know and then what for to bring the unit off so the unit of faith is gathering the pieces of the horror that was preached by the five-fold ministry and the whole world well i mean the whole world comes upon itself and forms the person of christ in you [Applause] and it's now the fullness that the unit a full complete unit of faith that has formed in you through the five-fold ministry the five foreign minister received it from the one who delivered picked it from the delivery van and now they unpacked it otherwise if i told you to come here and explain the seven thunders you'll just fumble you don't know you are not here to explain you are here to believe you are here just say amen i got it and to rejoice and to take your portion but then he makes the bald head and robin sleepless he has to scratch and stand and compare this and bring his squad and that quote and then he comes here and he begins to align things for you and say amen that's your work and that is his work and then he brings a colored raven from africa and then he comes and also displays his goodies and he'll pick you apart [Applause] let me go here that's of course ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 to 14. i'm not going to read that but let me bring you this quote let's go slowly and you see what the prophet says oh it is in the message called i think in the message um putting on the holy arm of god let's see what a prophet says oh god makes him so present in his army do you believe that now god said i sent them the what i sent them the word if just walked right over the top of it and disbelieved it i made it manifest and i crucified it i am getting tired i am now coming myself so here i come here i come and how is he coming god in you who was god above us the pillar of fire god with us and now in is god in us jesus christ the holy spirit what is it the same word the same god amen and he says no more trusting than anything else no more forget about anything else god come himself this was a money-sized job man sighs the job so he just brought it on down he calmed down himself in a man's size they won't have to do nothing about it they won't have to do nothing about it this particular new deal which it doesn't fail they'll do nothing about it he says just let them surrender to me and i will walk in them talking them speaking them whacking them oh let them just surrender open up and i will walk in them talking them speaking them work in them oh my that is it it will do i will do the work just let them humble themselves just let them just empty up the empty vessels okay borrow the empty ones don't bring the field you have to fill the quarter field the free water field bring empty ones don't come here with some kind of a classical leftovers in you just be empty make sure everything goes and then the christ he doesn't want to feel something which is already half filled or quarter field no not even a tennessee field empty let them just empty themselves i will just beat my enemy out of there through them he god christ in you will beat his enemies out there through you when he is hiding behind you about your skin he loves that i want to give him his pleasure want you glory to god does it you you can't do it you can't do it yourself now you are no match for him you are no match for the devil you are no match for the enemy but if you just let god do it get the word in you that's how to let god do it get the word in you then it will be taken care all of it to take care of all of it then he continues and he says this is the part i want you not to miss i'm finishing don't get tired now god fortified his army with the what with himself in the form of what listen carefully you'll say well god fortified us with the word no but how did that word come let me go back god fortified his ma his army with what with himself in form of prophets apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was god doing listen did you ever think what that officers of the church is it is goddess dress it's god is addressed inside the dress not even this outward inside inside the dress of god them offices so whoever touches the true genuine 5-4 ministry is touching god is inside the dress you can play with my shirt but don't play with my inside dress yeah you can pray with my trouser yes even when the other woman attacked he touched the helm of the garment of jesus not the inside one did you ever think of what that offices of the church is it's goddess dress inside address and that is an apostle a prophet a seer farsi before saturn ever gets it is danny told now today's preacher is also a prophet now he comes and says what is it god dressed up in his church and then he says this offices is goddess blessed aware when you see those offices pastors teachers evangelists what is it that's goddess dress where god is princess god is spirit god working through man god working through man to establish himself in the believer so you tamper with the genuine office begin to point fingers out and be little whom does pass past the chad think he's just bossing over us and thinking is as long as he's bringing you the word not himself okay what do you think is his interest i mean do you think we are here because we want money i think i would be a better businessman outside there if i was to devote this time to making money do you know the pain we go through some of you people the faces you are looking at us when we are preaching the demons the spirits in you how they make you react how some of them throw out time frames we think that is a job to enjoy thinking that you are sitting there my friend brother chad and you are going to answer for all these souls you think it's a joke it's not a joke and friends can you please allow this many do their work can you please say amen when they are doing it that's what i was telling you yesterday why are you why are you unhappy are you supporting the devil that i'm working on you are you annoyed oh you should be happy that more of the word is coming in you more of him today move him again until one day the fullness of him will be formed in you the unit of faith the unity of faith bringing the unity of faith all the unity of faith bringing the full unit of faith in you and then we go home but the moment you begin to doubt a ministry or fight or resist a ministry that is bringing the word in you you are unstripping god is inside where that's what the prophet says that is god is inside the dress you know all of us have got some fast clothing we put on you know how delicate it is how no man no man can tamper with that one and that's why the devil around the world has risen against genuine word holders those who are holding the king's sword he doesn't want them and i think you should not join the chorus of fighting them or resisting them because the whole purpose is when the fullness of the word of god that was an impact is packed in you by the 540 minister until the fullness of that person is in you that is the full faith complete faith and the devil doesn't want that to be achieved that's why you'll make you sleep he can't even make you fall or sick in the morning when you are coming and if you are spiritually sensitive you say why is the devil making me throw up now i slept very nice well now when i'm trying to dress to go to church i feel headache stomach up said this is the devil i'd rather go and follow sick in the church there must be something there today the devil doesn't want me to take that one and if you persist and come you'll believe me you will not even see that sickness you know when the dynamics the omega dynamics baby died you remember that tsunami to manis baby when she died when the baby died and you know what killed it disease of the head my head and it was the harvest time and many of them are dying of headaches today heavy high-minded proud arrogant interesting stiff-necked my head my head my head that's what killed them so this human puts the baby on the bed of the prophet and he brings to look for the prophet and what does the prophet do when the prophet comes he puts his nose on the nose of the baby bounced mouth ear ear covers and you know shakes himself over talk about desperation so what was he doing he bible says he laid over the body until the baby became warm and when i meet with you you know i mean when i meet my eye right i will meet with your left eye left hand with a right hand and it's like negative connecting to the positive and then the charging is going on and there was nothing interrupting that brooding until the baby got home until the life came back but you know when you come to church when the devil knows there is something now that's meant for you when you the holy spirit is brooding over you and the word is coming and you are starting to feel warm the devil said please god the show the washroom grass and then something from nowhere boils you and then the devil doesn't want you to get warm in the presence of the holy spirit that's why sometimes to make babies cry and you don't know why it's crying you go out it keeps quiet you come in he just cry the devil uses those stupid sometimes and then you go there and you are visa kissing your baby [Music] and you don't know that maybe the devil is wanting you to miss something pray against these demons that are failing you because these are the final touches since season final touches god is doing final touches on us we are about to go home so every time that you come in the house of god matters is very important and make sure any preacher whether he's just madly to fix a not maybe pastor abraham is just a nut fixer there are those who pick put big places look like fixing an engine and i'm not that one so i can come here just fixing that but without that nut the car is not complete and the inspector will come and he speaks well the snap is not fixed so but when the car was rolled to the point of the night fixer this time the car is you you can roll yourself beyond the net fixer before the nut fixer has fixed it so now we are coming to this time of the faith that overcomes the world we must overcome and it's going to be the faith of the lord jesus christ himself the faith of god not your faith not your mind not a faith not comparing you yourself at least i'm better than sister daniella well i think i treat my wife better than brother so and so treats his stop that nonsense you just say how do jesus treat her because i must become him that's my measure how would jesus treat her okay your wife you say okay now how would i treat jesus because jesus is in him and jesus is in me so how would i treat jesus in this person how would i respect him if jesus came in the form of this brother if jesus came to me in the form of this sister how would i receive him back to the garden of eden man who's both male and female on the one hand you're the bride on the other hand you're the bride group the bridegroom in you is the bridegroom for the other one and then the bridegroom in the other one is your bridegroom and you are the bride and the other bridegroom she's also the bride for this bridegroom and talk about fellowship talk about love talk about devotion talk about unity talk about respect submission to one another preferring one another supporting one another being there for one another that's the revelation that's the point it comes by the faith of jesus christ not the faith of bcf not the faith of brother so and so sisters of my faith i know my heart i know my faith stop quit that takes you nowhere let that faith graduate let it come to the level it wants to supposed to be from peace means of faith to the fullness of the reality of faith the faith of god himself and i'm not going to be afraid you are not going to be afraid no one will say but what about the other sister will she make it what about the other brother she's in trouble i mean we need to read to stand i mean this is oh brother greater in me i'm very weak you know i can't it's not any weakness that you're talking about anymore forget about that if it is weakness all of us are going to be weak but if it's strength then all of us have the same nature of strength and the bible says he is even going to support the weak of those ones weak for the poor is even for those who are weak in what the prophet is saying that means it's going to lift you up to this river amen because when you are moving in a bus it doesn't mean the other one who islam cannot walk we'll always remain under the bus as the bus goes somebody will lift that person up and and bring in the other person to also sit here and the weak and the upper body will all be in the same level as we go blessed be the name of the lord so let's be careful let's fight anything that is not the word that's why the devil is fighting the word he's fighting the message and he's fighting the five-fold ministry and anybody who is trying to stand with the truth is singled out fought for that because the devil knows the mystery blessed be the name of the lord so let's open up to mr perfect like i preached on friday who what went you out to see in the wilderness you went to see mr perfect you knew william branham no that is not the man it is the man he introduced that's what we went to whom would you go and go to see educator the genius most powerful man in the world no not that kind of change he wasn't anything but he introduced us to the masterpiece mr perfect mister everything the hell shall die [Applause] and he's here with us and he is to be in you and he's to guide you all away and i'm not going to bother about whether you make it or not because you as long as it's in you you've already made it it's as good as already done as good as already done as good as thank you already in heaven you have already that's why john saw john john is weeping but john is seeing john there already seated on the throne that he's one of the 24 elders he's one of them but he is whipping but he sees himself already and overcome he's already there seated his earphone is there so let's see ourselves as people who have already overcome as long
