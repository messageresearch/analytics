[0:00] ephesus was not a deceived church so i
[0:01] want you to hear what's said next
[0:03] because it's so important to realize
[0:05] we've received the word that removes
[0:07] deception so we're no longer a deceived
[0:09] people
[0:11] ephesus was not a deceived church
[0:14] it failed itself by not continuing in
[0:17] perfect love
[0:20] it didn't fail by deception
[0:23] it failed by not continuing perfect love
[0:26] and we've been given the message to pull
[0:28] back deception but we can still fail
[0:32] if we don't continue in perfect love
[0:34] now listen what he says next
[0:37] summary of ephesus he's going to start
[0:39] the summary
[0:41] fruits without love
[0:43] led to apostasy
[0:46] i want to read that again so it can soak
[0:48] in real deep
[0:50] fruits
[0:51] that means manifestations
[0:53] healings
[0:55] honesty
[0:56] family life
[0:58] fruits
[0:59] fruits of christianity
[1:01] fruits of clean living fruits of the
[1:03] word
[1:04] healings prophecies fruits
[1:08] fruits without love
[1:11] led to apostasy
[1:15] this wasn't a deceived church
[1:17] we're not a deceived people
[1:20] but that word has got to bring a divine
[1:22] love
[1:24] that word has got to bring us to a
[1:26] perfect love because that's the only
[1:27] thing that will enter in there and we
[1:29] can even have fruits but fruits without
[1:31] love will once again lead to apostasy
[1:35] we see so much emphasis sometimes placed
[1:37] on fruits amen we fruits of this and
[1:39] fruits of that there should be fruits
[1:41] naturally there are fruits fruits come
[1:43] from the word of god when the word is
[1:45] planted amen it brings forth fruit but
[1:48] we can emphasize fruit and still hate
[1:50] our brother and still speak evil of
[1:52] another one or somebody who believes a
[1:54] little different and we call them a name
[1:56] and
[2:00] fruits without love
[2:02] led to apostasy
[2:05] i say god
[2:06] help these fruits be with love
[2:09] above all let's get to the capstone
[2:12] friends above all let's not hang up
[2:14] somewhere in the journey we've got to go
[2:16] to brotherly love and when we hit
[2:17] brotherly love it brings the capstone
[2:19] into place amen because if you love your
[2:21] brother you can love god amen if you
[2:23] love god you've not seen how can you
[2:25] hate your brother who you have seen amen
[2:27] we've we cannot have fruits without love
[2:30] that led to apostasy
[2:32] but we must have fruits with the love of
[2:34] god and we'll want that bring that'll
[2:36] bring a translation amen a resurrection
[2:39] a new body because the only thing that
[2:41] could move there amen is perfect love
