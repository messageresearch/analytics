[0:00] the revelation of Christ the
[0:02] understanding of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:05] will bring us Escape help us to escape
[0:08] the pollutions of the world
[0:10] I want to escape the pollutions of the
[0:12] world I must know him
[0:15] he is the answer he is the solution
[0:18] I must know him I must know about him I
[0:21] must have the correct understanding I
[0:24] must know him and who he is in this day
[0:27] I must know him intimately today not
[0:31] where he was or where he will be but I
[0:33] must know him amen
[0:35] listen uh there's a lot of people that I
[0:38] have known in life but I don't know now
[0:41] right if you ask me about one of my
[0:44] childhood friends and say do you know
[0:45] such and such yeah I know him
[0:48] then they say well where's he live I
[0:50] don't know who's he married to I don't
[0:51] know is he married I don't know does he
[0:53] have children I don't know where does he
[0:54] work I don't know and you say I thought
[0:56] you said you know him
[0:58] the correct statement is I knew him
[1:02] and in that day I knew him when we were
[1:04] in fifth grade together you could ask me
[1:06] that day do you know sudden says and I
[1:08] would say yes I know him and you would
[1:10] say where does he go to school I know
[1:11] what's his favorite grade I know what
[1:13] does he like for lunch I know where does
[1:14] he live I know I know where's who's his
[1:16] mother and father I know because I know
[1:18] him
[1:20] Right But as time move on that friend of
[1:23] mine has now changed
[1:27] there's a greater revelation of him
[1:29] there was a certain Revelation I
[1:30] understood as a fifth grader but now as
[1:33] a grown man in his in his 40s amen with
[1:36] a family or a career or wherever he's at
[1:38] in the world and whatever he's doing I
[1:40] don't know him anymore
[1:42] I knew him and that's the same thing
[1:45] with trying to take a denominational
[1:46] understanding of Jesus Christ amen what
[1:49] he was in Luther's day was him that was
[1:51] him Amen to catch the Revelation that
[1:54] God was bringing in that day amen was to
[1:56] receive Christ was to come in contact
[1:58] with the knowledge of the Lord
[2:01] but now I can you can come this far and
[2:03] say do you know him well I knew him but
[2:05] what's he doing today amen how's he
[2:07] revealing himself today how's he
[2:09] manifesting himself today amen then you
[2:12] don't know him
[2:15] so I want to know him
[2:18] not to have known him or will know him
[2:21] but I want to know him now amen I want
[2:24] to know what he's doing I want to know
[2:25] what his desire is I want to know what
[2:27] he's thinking I want to know what his
[2:28] plan is I want to know what he's trying
[2:30] to accomplish in this day do you know
[2:32] how privileged we are as a people to
[2:33] know him amen by the Revelation not to
[2:36] say I have known him I knew where he was
[2:38] but I know him now amen
