========================================

i belong to jesus he purchased me and i'm all kids [Music] the blood of jesus [Music] is he purchased me and i'm all his [Music] praise the lord god bless you all this evening it's so good to see you amen it's good to be together it's good to worship the lord i appreciate the atmosphere and the songs that were sung and the sweet presence of the lord while we're standing let's go ahead and take our bibles and to turn to the book of revelation i'm going to continue on with the same thought that we started on sunday and we're just going to ask the lord to give us an extra major measure of grace as we move forward but i'd like to begin with revelation chapter 1 verse 1. i don't think i properly gave the title last time but i i wrote on the top of my paper here the mystery revealed in the revelation gaps the mystery revealed in the revelation gaps so we'll see if any of that makes any sense as we move forward let's read revelations one and one the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john so these things that he's going to reveal are things that must shortly come to pass two thousand years ago or shortly come to pass when he sent and signified it by an angel to his servant john amen let's bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father for your word god as it continues to unfold itself before us lord we see you more clearly than we ever have before and lord that's our desire to see you unveiled and while we pray that you just continue lord to unlock this word to your bride that you would whisper the secrets in our ears the love secrets of the mysteries that you've been revealing to us all along the way and god i pray that you give us eyes to see and ears to hear in our heart to perceive all that you have for us lord i pray that you'd anoint these lips of clay lord this vessel inadequate as it may be lord it's the method you chose and we're trusting in you to come and do the supernatural that you would speak eternal words through lips of clay that you would speak lord truth lord through lips that are failed my god we're trusting in you not in the lips lord not in the man but we're trusting in you that your holy spirit would come and pick up the gift that's laying here and use it for your glory and for the edification of your people bless us lord have the preeminence among us we pray in jesus christ's name amen you can all be seated if we can bring up the power point please brother franco we'll go to uh the first slide i'm gonna read a quote from brother branham out of the seventh seal and i come across this some time ago but i've always really enjoyed this quote brother bram says now where where are we at friends the seals and everything opening now we're getting in this between here there it is see where we're sitting i hope you get it i haven't got no education and i know what i'm talking about but maybe i can't explain it explain it explain it to make sense to you but i hope that god takes the words it's mixed up and divides them out right you see and lets you know what it is because we're at the door we're here at the time the brother says i've got no education but i know what i'm talking about brother venom knew he saw it he saw the revelation he knew but with limited vocabulary limited uh what he said limited education he knew what he was talking about but he couldn't explain it maybe in a way that it made sense to you amen but he saw it and it made sense to him but he was having trouble explaining it amen and so i i say god bless us today because i feel the same way amen there's some things that god are just dropping in my heart some things that are opening for me some of the things the prophet has said and i see it more clearly than ever before but how to say it i don't know and i may not be able to explain it in a way that makes sense to you but we're just going to pray that the holy ghost will connect the pieces i thought how amazing it is that the holy ghost gives revelation right he gives revelation but yet he still requires the preaching of the word that's what he wants so he takes a beautiful revelation and he passes it through a corrupted vessel that's been purged by the blood of jesus christ but yet still an imperfect vessel with inabilities and and and wrong forms of speech and all kinds of things and he brings it out in that halted fashion and and broke up and whatever and then we've got to depend on the holy ghost on the other side to take that that's broken up and messed up and put it back together in a perfect revelation again only god would set something up to work this way because god wants to make sure that it's by revelation not intellectual understanding but by revelation amen so he'll use a man who will get things wrong get details wrong say things wrong but the revelation will be true and it'll connect the revelation on the other end and it'll be true in the start and true and the finish and it can and and the man can mess it all up in between right like brother branham you know he'll he'll say things wrong and he'll catch himself and correct himself but it didn't change the revelation it was right amen so we just trust the lord to help us and when we look here at the beginning of the church age book we read this introduction out of the revelation of jesus christ last time but i'd like to read it again said through this volume will concern itself with the various major doctrines such as godhead water baptism etc found in revelation chapters 1-3 its main theme is the setting forth of a detailed study of the seven church ages this is necessary in order to study and understand the rest of revelation for out of the ages come the seals out of the seals come the trumpets out of the trumpets come the viles like the first burst of a roman candle the church ages come forth with a mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further light but once the brilliance of the seven church ages is given by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of revelation opens wide before our wondering eyes and we edified and purified by its spirit are made ready for his glorious appearing even our lord and savior the one true god jesus christ praise be to god so brother remember says we'll walk in the light the beautiful light one step at a time lord coming closer to him yeah children of the light accept his word keep walking and watch more unfold don't leave it no matter what somebody else says stay right in that and just keep walking with it watch it unfold and reveal itself and so brother remember said out of the church ages will come the seals out of the seals comes the trumpets out of the trumpets comes the vials amen and brother branham is not talking about one will start and stop and then the other will start and stop because we know that the seals are overlaid with the church ages and the trumpets also are overlaid and the vials have an overlay there's an overlap all the way through it's not like well out of out of the church ages come the seals know the seals and the church ages overlap have a big overlap but he's saying out of the revelation of one amen comes another and the revelation becomes another and comes another like a burst of a roman candle comes out and illuminates then there's more illumination then off of that more illumination amen until the whole of revelation is open before our wondering eyes amen so we should never stop this pursuit amen of the whole of revelation open before our wondering eyes we can't open it it takes the lamb to open it amen but we should never stop wanting to walk in the light as he is in the light [Music] and and if we just stay there if we walk with it stay with it walk with it watch it unfold and reveal itself amen we don't have to do anything just rest just keep walking with him and watch him do it we we're looking at the book of revelation and i put this here because we're actually looking in some ways at the construction of the book of revelation actually how it's written the order that it's written and you come to the introduction in chapter one you go to chapter two in chapter three and you have the seven church ages amen you end chapter three with christ on the outside he's been rejected and put outside the church ages outside of the laodicean church age and that's where we find him amen and then the very next thing that happens you come to chapter four amen chapter four is going to bring us into setting the scene setting the stage for the breach amen and in that you're going gonna find an open door in heaven and a voice from heaven saying come up higher so there's a rapture there's a catching up there's another revelation coming amen after jesus christ is put on the outside and the laodicean church age now there's another step to take and that's through the open door into heaven and to see what he saw and then we know we go to the breach let me move move through here and we find that between the seven church ages and between the seven seals there's what brother branham calls the breach and and in the breach there's this is a gap this is one of the mysteries in the gap we don't go straight from seven church ages right to seven seals because you've got to pass through the breach first because you've got to understand to go from the church ages to the seals there has to be an event that takes place so you've got to have a gap here because without a gap if the bible was written just from the seven church ages said to the revelation of the seven seals we wouldn't realize what has to happen for the revelation of the seven seals to come forth in order for the revelation of the seals come forth there's got to be something that takes place in the heavenly realm and there's got to be a call for one who's worthy to come and take the book of redemption and loose the seven seals and without somebody being able to come forth and fill fulfill the legal obligation in the courts of heaven a kinsmen redeemer a bowass type then we can't move into the revelation of the seventh seal seven seals so when brother branham is moving into the book of revelation he's actually moving if you watch his ministry he's moving according to the way the book is constructed so so brother branham we talked about the days of the ten toes and the two big uh toes in the eisenhower and khrushchev we went through all of that and in that day there will be a stone cut out of the mountain without hands to smite the image and the feet and brother benham recognizes that's it friends we're at the end brother adam when he saw that he knew you couldn't go past toes and so he knew we were at the end and he knew that those seals were sealed up until the time of the end and he knew now it's time for this mysterious book this book of revelation to unfold itself and he starts at that that that incident of slamming the shoe on the table in the u.n comes in the 12th of october 1960 and then brother branham comes right at the beginning of december and starts preaching the revelation of jesus christ series which is the church ages and then he goes into 1961 and he preaches revelation chapter four and he preaches revelation chapter five a couple parts on that and he stops and he doesn't do anything else he doesn't move into the seals he doesn't preach the seals he doesn't do anything because he can't do anything till somebody comes in the breach amen and can take the book and loose the seals because brother branham can't lose the seals so he can't just keep preaching he's got to stop and there's a gap right in our bible so we know that there's a gap there's a breach somebody's got to come and fill the breach so that we can move to the revelation of the seven seals the bible's actually written so that we can catch the mystery in the way it's written brother branham said even in the paragraphs even in the numbers of the verses the mysteries are laying there it's constructed in a way to draw us in and so now brother ben can talk about chapter four he can talk about chapter five but he can't take that book and loose the zeal so he can't go into chapter six so he waits a year and a half until he gets to search as this the time and it serves as this the time now he starts to to catch that it's going to be the third pool amen it could be could it be those seven mysterious thunders that's laying back there amen that holds the secret of the whole thing and he goes out west and he gets the the sword in the hand in january of 1963 amen and that sword is is the word in the hand amen it's the third pool it's the opening of the word that's coming into his hand and then in in in in january 28th we see the picture amen the cloud in the sky amen marking he says who is that he said that's our lord up there that's a major marker friends now brother branham now is watching the events unfold amen that now he's caught up into the constellation of the seven angels amen and he's told to go back east amen to preach the seven seals and he goes back and starches in march purchase the seven seals he doesn't know what they are he can't preach the seven seals by his own authority he can only preach because there was a there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the word that was worthy to take the book and loose the seals thereof amen and so he waits every day for an angel to come and bring him the fresh manna from heaven and he'll come out and preach it why because he can't he can't just go into revelation chapter 6 until somebody fulfills the requirements in the breach so when we read the message i mean when you start reading the message and you read the message it's like when you first start reading the bible it's it's old king james english you don't understand it i don't get all the words but you keep reading and keep reading and the pictures keep unveiling and unveiling and the same thing with the message you keep reading and you keep reading and you keep reading and all of a sudden you see something more than just the ink vlots on paper you see the story unfolding you see the timeline unfold you see the story of redemption it's unfolding right in the life of a prophet but the man says a word become a prophet becomes the word for his age his very life indicates what's happening amen and we begin to watch that so in the breach the breach is important and it holds a vital mystery and the vital mystery contained in the breach is the event that everybody's been waiting for for somebody to take the book and loose the seals thereof and then once that's happened now brother branham can come and preach the revelation of the seven seals so there's a great mystery here but the mystery is more than white horse red horse there's more there's a mystery in the gap between and the mystery in the gap is the one who's worthy to take the book has to come and reveal the book so who came see the mystery in the gap amen praise be to god brother ma'am says well hold on i want to i want to read this in the feast of trumpets so go into the prophet's chamber and watch them seven steps where where did the guard meet the challenge to bring the comer into the presence of the king at the top of the steps was in the seventh step there shows that we've got to come again with the same spirit that was on john he introduced the messiah he was greater than all the prophets he introduced it and we've got to come to a place again to something that's going to introduce the messiah so brother is telling you we've got to have a repeat of what happened in john's day he was elijah the same thing has to happen he he introduced the messiah after he introduced the messiah he said he must increase i must decrease then we've got to have another introduction of the messiah amen and then the prophet says i must decrease he must increase do we recognize what's happened the messiah has come to the gentiles brother man's not just playing with language he knows what he's talking about something's going to introduce the messiah and how will the people that's believing him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know they shall know their god now how he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word so my brother said we don't look for nail scars we look for the word made manifest the revealed word her mate her husband that's why this has to happen it wasn't in the reformers it wasn't in luther wesley and the pentecostals and them scripture says it wasn't but it will come that is his promise for this age we're living in the age that is coming will be in she must be identified in him any woman must be identified with her husband for the two are one and christ's bride has to be identified with him for the two are one and he is the word not the denomination the word we are to be children of the light and the light is the word which has made light for this age you know there's a lot of people who says we're children of the light but the only way to be a child of the light is to walk in the light he says what is the light to be a child of the light or an offspring of the light the light is the word which has made light for this age so you can't be the offspring of a light from a previous age no that's not walking in the light that's not a child of the light a child of the light amen the light is the light the word that's made light for this age amen and then when we receive that we're a child of the light children of the light how do we know light except it comes from the word all right the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it and the bible said so praise be to god brother says here in the breach this is kind of laying a foundation for where we want to go tonight lord willing so starting on the subject of the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals and i was just speaking this afternoon to a friend and maybe the lord willing sometime this summer if he doesn't take me home or i get to come back don't go overseas or something i'd like to strike again at the seven last trumpets and it all bridges together and then there's the seven last plagues and it all blends right together as we'll see as we go along then he comes along and says in the seals in the second seal all right notice the 17th chapter of revelation now everything is try to open your heart and let the holy spirit teach you now there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials now you see there are seven vials you know these sevens as we are going through they are they happen right at the same time following the plagues following the church age just the same because it is all sealed up in that one book everything and everything happens just in rotation one goes right into the other and the other into the other there's two spirits working god and the devil and he says in thinking man's filter is in 1965 and i'm anxiously waiting for the hour to where i can uh to we can all congregate in one place and preach on those seven plagues seven vials seven trumps and so forth they all happen right in a cluster and so forth they all happen right in a cluster that's the reason it'll take us about a week ten days or more to get through it in one single meeting if we can so brother branham still at the end of his ministry he's wanting to preach on the vials and the trumpets and all of that and tie them together because he says they all happen in a cluster and so so we've got to be careful that we we take what he says as what he says they all happen in a cluster and just see what the lord will show us all right where am i at okay now we go from the breach to the seven seals we're just walking through the bible you have one two three four five seals then in this bible you have seal number six here then in the beginning of chapter eight you have seal number seven and then you have a gap you have a gap between the sixth and seventh seal in your bible like a gap between the church ages and the seals there's a gap between the the six and seven seal then we move forward and the trumpets and then next you have the the trumpets they finish up over here with trump trumpet number six trumpet number seven and there's a gap in between the trumpets uh a gap between the sixth and seventh trumpet so brother banham says he says the gathering of israel is the trumpets the trumpets is to gather israel notice the very first trumpet sound blood fire hail and everything scattered the ground what was he doing bringing israel out of spiritual egypt see back into the homeland so so he's telling us that the trumpets are for israel they're a gathering in of israel bringing israel back to the homeland so the 144 thousand can be called out he says in recognizing your day and its message now the end of these seventh sabbaths which has been there was not there was to be the day of atonement which was the seven trumpets and the seventh trump which was to call a day of mourning back for the sacrifice or the atonement and we find out then that israel the seven trumpets was pertained only to israel let's get down he says and then and when i went in to pray i told the wife i'm going in sincerely i knelt down before god to pray and he revealed to me that them seven trump had sounded under the sixth seal and i've done preached it supernatural see it's the hand of god the whole thing it pertains to israel and we picked it up under the sixth seal you you you all who have that how the persecution of the jews the time of the gentiles has been in this pentecostal feast the trumpets all of them was sounded under the sixth seal and we picked it up last sunday under the feast of trumpets if you all want to get it what was it to do to rush the jews from all parts of the world back into their homeland it must be there in the opening of the seals under the sixth seal the seventh trumpet sounded in the sixth seal so brother graham's tying a couple things together there of the feast and of the seals but he's saying these trumpets sound under the sixth seal and and so we have that's important for us to know that the trumpet sound under the sixth seal and he says here in in the feast of trumpets in revelations 11 these are the two prophets called their ministry will be the ministry of moses and elias calling to israel out of the jewish traditions just as the seventh angel's message called the bride out of the pentecostal tradition remember moses and elijah call israel out of the old atonement of the lamb and sheep and blood and goats and sacrifice to the real living sacrifice to the word so the two witnesses are going to try to pull them out of judaism of the old order of sacrifices and old orders and tried to bring them in to the real living sacrifice the word the bloody lamb the bleeding word who bled for us and died for us so he's trying to trying to bring him out of the old order into the living word and the seventh angel's message now he's talking about himself now the seventh angel's message under the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seal is to walk call the people the bride out of the pentecostal world tradition to the genuine atonement the genuine atonement what's the atonement do the atonement atones for your sins to the genuine atonement the word christ impersonated in his word here made flesh among us we need that atonement which is the revealed word he says made flesh among us science has proved it by pictures the church knows what the world around we firmly know it for he's never told us one thing and thus saith the lord but what's been the truth did he not say down there on the river as john the baptist was sent with his message i looked up and she's 12 o'clock he looks up at the clock i looked up she's 12 o'clock the midnight hour is here friends upon us to show how perfect the scripture is what's he mean when he says the midnight hour is upon us isn't there a cry that went out in the midnight hour what was the cry that went out in the midnight hour behold the bridegroom cometh come out and meet him join up with him so the midnight out when he says when he's trying to explain now that those two prophets they're going to bring them to the the real living sacrifice the word he's going to show them where the real living sacrifice is the word so the the the seventh church age messenger has to bring him out of the old pentecostal world tradition amen into the true atonement which is the word because the word bled for you and the word died for you and when you received the word made flesh you received the benefit of that word when it was made flesh two thousand years ago and was crucified because the word bled for you the word died for you and now you can get a hold of the bleeding bloody word which is what the word made light in your day [Applause] and he's bringing us into that amen into that atonement so what's he bringing the church into into the feast of atonement the true atonement amen recognizing it's the word it's always been the word the word was god the word was with god the word was made flesh and dwell among us it's always been the word friends christ is the anointed word brother franco can you turn this on for me i'm going to try to use some something new this is a whiteboard app and i'm going to try to use this and just draw what we did with the feast of the lord now remember when you go all the way back to leviticus 23 you can read these feasts of the lord and we preached a a preached a series on that years ago but in the feast of the lord is the story of redemption the story of redemption is laid in the seven feast of the lord and if you understand that you understand the whole gospel story it's written right in the feast and so in the feast of the lord you have one two three four five six seven feast the first one is passover passover was jesus christ was slain on passover on the feast of passover he's physically slain he becomes our passover lamb and then you go to unleavened bread which is no leaven no sin mixed in with it and showing there's going to be a word and that's a seven day feast and for seven days i mean there's going to be some true word passing through each of the seven church ages amen and there's going to be real elect seed who get a hold of that unleavened bread in each of those days three is first fruits and first fruits is the resurrection jesus christ is the first fruits of the resurrection amen and he rose on the first day when jesus christ was here amen he was slain on passover he laid in the grave at the beginning of the feast of unleavened bread and he resurrected at the at the day of the feast of first fruits his life was matching the feast of jehovah so nobody would miss what was happening and they still missed what was happening then he was rejected amen whoops whoops bad news but then comes the feast of pentecost [Music] which is jubilee because pentecost means 50 50 days and in the feast of pentecost comes the seven church ages [Music] right so in the feast of pentecost comes the seven church ages and the jews are laying quiet they're rejected they've rejected the word through all of this time but god has promised that he's going to gather them back when he's done dealing with the gentiles he's going to turn back so then he's going to come to the feast of trumpets and this is what brother branham tells us this feast of trumpets is what these two witnesses are going to do amen trumpets trumpets is the sound of a trumpet is an inn gathering amen it's the inn gathering at the end of the harvest to gather all of israel back together so the feast of trumpets is the gathering together of israel amen and these prophets are going to come and they're going to explain what the end gathering has been all about and that end gathering started amen in world war ii that's what brother bam shows number six is atonement where they recognize jesus christ the slain slain lamb and they recognize the true and living sacrifice and seven is tabernacles booths dwelling places this shows the whole plan of redemption he came to redeem his people passover lamb he is the feast of unleavened bread through seven church ages he is the first fruits of the resurrection he is the jubilee the the pentecostal feast he that became the church the gentile church he comes back in the trumpets and starts gathering everybody back to israel back to the homeland so that those two prophets can show up and they can they can testify to them that what's that what they've missed what they missed back there and what's been happening in the inn gathering to bring them to the feast of atonement where they recognize christ the slain lamb and they mourn for missing it amen and then you have tabernacles because now you find the lamb with the 144 thousand amen on mount of olives dwelling together and he's tabernacled with them you see the whole feast but you realize within the feast of pentecost the gentile church goes through all of these feasts too because we receive a passover lamb he's our feast of unleavened bread we're feasting on through seven church ages amen he he's resurrected us into newness of life we've been caught up with him amen he is our jubilee amen and then he and the trumpets brother branham comes amen we've had a trumpet in all seven church ages brother branham said amen a messenger would come a seal would break a trumpet with sound declaring spiritual war amen and then a plague would fall a vile would pour out a plague would fall through seven church ages so there's been seven trumpets sounding in seven church ages amen and brother madam shows us that every time one came forth trumpet trumpet trumpet amen but in the last one he said there was one blast and seven thunders uttered their voice and there's one last trumpet amen that explains all the trumpets brother branham in the preaching of the seals preaches the thunders and brings us to the feast of trumpets to recognize the true atonement the word to bring us to the feast of atonement because he unveils the whole word now he takes away all the catholic dogma amen all the misunderstanding of the scripture and the seals unveil christ the word through the whole bible he said when the seals open it opened my bible which is the atonement the word bled for you the word died for you and he opened up the word and revealed the word bring us to the feast of atonement amen and what happened under the under the under the messenger the last messenger amen the holy ghost had been bound and denominational rivers for nearly 2000 years but to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy ghost full holy ghost not partial not dips not not bound by false understanding but when the word came back the life came back and now we've come to feast the tabernacles because he's dwelling in his bride so the gentiles have come through our feasts and brother branham said we're now we are now feasting under the seventh feast of feast of tabernacles the seventh church age so we are over here in the feast of tabernacles i want to go through this again because it's so important because this helps us understand all the things brother branham says that looks contradictory he says we're feasting under the seventh feast in the seventh century the feast of tabernacles but the feast of tabernacles he says is the seventh feast or the seven thousand year period since the fall of man which will be the millennium so then people heard brother bam said that so they said well we're in the millennium christ has come breach we've gone through the breach christ has come we're in the millennium that's not what he said because brother branham said that will be the millennium there'll be a thousand years on this earth under the feast of tabernacles when we all come back in glorified bodies tabernacles living on the earth for a thousand years so we've got the gentile bride is in the feast of tabernacles amen the jews are in the feast of trumpets they're still in gathering but the earth is under the feast of atonement under the sixth seal being purged by judgments until it's finally completely cleaned amen so that the feast of the feast of tabernacles can set in upon the earth so we can be in one place in redemption the jews can be another place in redemption and the earth can be yet in a different place in redemption oh i can't express you how important it says to understand that if we can catch that that we don't have to make them all line up perfect then all of a sudden brother branham just became a prophet who knows what he's talking about amen right we don't have to say well he said this said this but i am i think he misspoke there i don't think he meant i mean how could he be in the feast of tabernacles and feast the trumpets all at the same time hey feast the trumpets feast of atonement and feast of tabernacles are all going on at the same time depending on who you are and where you are in the redemption cycle [Music] and now the prophet knows what he's talking about and he says i have no education he says but i know what i'm talking about he says in the 70s he goes i looked right at it and i know what it is [Music] he didn't say he didn't know it he knew it amen but he couldn't explain it there was still some mystery part to it that couldn't be explained praise be to god this is important if you learn that then i i'll sleep good tonight i'm trying my best i get so worked up and i feel so pressed because i know how much is laying here i feel so pressed to keep rolling and rolling and rolling but i'm trying so hard to be still and go slow because these things are important brother branham thought it was worth talking about the feast of trump is to explain to us our redemption it's important we understand the feast of trump is to understand our redemption if the prophet needed to teach it then we need to pay attention to it we can't just say the trumpets feast no the prophet brought it to the bride it's bride's food we need to say lord let me eat that and digest it and become one with it and give me a revelation on that it's important so i want to go slow today if i can and just teach if i can just teach all right let's go through a little series of quotes here brother bam says now let me say this right here that every trumpet that blowed blowed under the sixth seal we'll get to it in a few minutes where we caught the seal all the trumpets sounded under the sixth seal but every trumpet sounded under the sixth seal under the persecution of the jews notice revelation now eight and beginning with the seventh verse all was calling out of israel natural in egypt now it's the calling out of israel in the spiritual sense he was making them ready to the feast of atonement every trumpet sounded the sixth seal under the persecution of the jews now he's starting to give you an indication of the sixth seal it comes with the persecution of the jews now feast of trump is again remember every trumpet sounded under the sixth seal only then when it sounded remember all trumpets sound on the sixth seal the sixth seal finishes the mystery under the sixth seal just before the seventh is open so the sixth seal finishes the mystery because the seventh seal doesn't say anything the seventh seal is the one breaking the mystery the feast of trumpets now again luke 17 30. what's that the revealing of the son of man and also malachi 4 turning the heart to the children back to the fathers in hebrews 4 12 a sword sharper the word is sharper than a sword this dividing of the soul and spirit and the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart what's brother brahm showing you his ministry 17 30 malachi 4 hebrews 4 4 12 all these scriptures that's promised this is to be between the sixth and seventh seal and the sixth and seventh trumpet so the question is did brother branham come between the sixth and seventh trumpet answer is yes so we're not looking to trumpets in the future trumpets are in the past when the two witnesses show up amen they're there to reveal to them what the trumpets have been just like when brother branham comes and reveals to us the seals he's showing us what has been it's going to be a repeat of the same cycle praise god i don't know what else to say the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal sounds at the same time and between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet there is a prophet to appear before the gentiles to call the people back to the original pentecostal doctrine and the two witnesses of revelation 11 appear to the jews to send them to jesus while the church is being taken up let's go over to revelation chapter 8 in our bibles if we go to revelation chapter 8 and just look at how our bible is constructed in chapter eight verse one we have the seventh seal and when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour so nothing was said then we go down to verse seven and it starts the trumpets and the first angel sounded and there followed hail fire mingled with blood and this is the trumpets and the trumpets come from seven through nine nine is the fifth trumpet uh six verse 13 to 21 is the sixth trumpet but then there's no seventh trumpet we have a gap and in the gap we have revelation 10. what happens in revelation 10. we have the mighty angel coming down with an open book not a closed book an open book in his hand seven thunders utter their voices john heard it he was gonna write it so it's time for john to hear the thunders but he was told to seal it up amen and like daniel was told to seal it up till the time of the end he was told to seal it up amen so he sealed it up and it says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god shall be finished right so what happens we have the mighty angel come down with an open book in his hand and and the mystery is finished under the voice of the seventh angel so where does brother branham come between the sixth and seventh trumpet we see it right there in the bible between the sixth and seventh trumpet he comes and then we have verse eight which another voice tells john to go and take the little book and eat it up and prophesy again so we have the ministry of the bride from 8 to 11. and then we start chapter 11. we go down to verse three it says i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy two thousand two hundred three score days that's three and a half years so now we we come we come to the the the we come to the ministry of the two prophets where in between the sixth and seventh trumpets do you see it is it there in the bible between the sixth and seventh trumpet we get to verse 15 and the seventh angel sounded there's your seventh trumpet so between the sixth and seventh trumpet we have the ministry of brother branham and we have the ministry of the of moses and elijah but he says it's between the 6th and 7th trumpet and the 6th and 7th seal so let's go back to revelation chapter 6. in revelation chapter 6 starts the seals and verse 1 and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder and one of the four beasts saying come and see that goes all the way to the sixth seal in verse 12 down to 17 the sixth seal but then no seventh seal because we don't get the seventh seal until chapter eight and then it's injected chapter seven and in chapter seven it starts after these things i saw four angels standing in the four corners of earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor in any tree and i saw another angel ascend from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt to to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees do we have sealed the servants of our god and their foreheads and i heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed 144 000 of all the tribes of the children of israel then it goes down 12 thousand three try brother branham comes to this and he says see it's the hundred and forty four thousand under the two to two prophets ministry in chapter 11 and he says that's where the trumpets come in right there where's the trumpets under the sixth seal because under the sixth seal is revelation chapter seven so after the sixth seal you have revelation chapter seven which is the calling out of the hundred forty four thousand and that's where the trumpets come in right there the bible's even written so we don't miss it it's written so we don't miss it i want to uh i want to do something i want to draw something let's go back to drawing i'm sorry franco i'm sure you're working overtime brother franco's so patient so kind to my face and i trust he's that way all the time but i i can be a challenge he's already done a slide for me but i just have to inject this right now if we go through the seals one two three four five six seven seals we just explained how through the seven trumpets that you can have different groups of people in different categories being redeemed on different timelines through the feast that we all agree we see that we all agree if you don't agree just come see me later but but so we broke we want to break the notion that everything happens at the same time like the feast of trumpets for the jews is not the same time we have the feast of trumpet for the gentiles or tabernacles is not the same time for every group so i want to break another notion in the seals so we have we have these seals let's just write oh man white horse red horse black horse pale horse right souls under the altar um judgment and then the mystery seal the coming of the lord so our old intellectual hybridized brain taking the word of god always messes it up do we agree with that and the old denominational way of thinking is whenever you number something those things have to come in sequence but just because you number something they do not have to come in sequence right let me let me prove that we've got the first four seals which overlay the church ages right and they happen in sequence one two three four right but when we get to the fifth seal the fifth hill souls under the altar and brother branham says those are the souls under the altar he said they're under a measure of grace they're in the lamb's book of life they're jews and he blinded them so that they wouldn't receive the word so that he could turn to the gentiles and get a gentile bride right and because of that they're under the sacrifice altar amen waiting for the time that they can receive white robes waiting for the 144 000 to be called out and to be killed as they were all right and so brother branham said they're jews the true jews who stayed true to the word that they could see he didn't hold them accountable for the part that he blinded them to and they're they're jews from the time of christ on so the fifth seal starts before the first seal is that right and the fifth seal goes all the way down in here to the end of the tribulation period and into the millennium is that true [Music] so it's not in chronological order always so when the bible says one two three four it doesn't mean you have to take it in chronological order one seal out of that can span all the seals the sixth field is judgment right brother branham says the sixth seal opened at the time that the sixth trumpet sounded right is that right which is the same time as the second woe which is world war ii because it's the time and the sixth trumpet that those demons came out of the river euphrates and went into the armies of hitler mussolini and stalin is that what he said that's part of the sixth seal so that means the sixth seal actually starts between the third and fourth seal is that true so it doesn't mean one one's done and then another then another then and then after four comes five after five comes six after six comes seven that's not the way it works in the seals is that true so if that's true for the seals let's let it be true for the trumpets and let it be true for the viles okay we unders do you understand what i'm saying so there's a couple things that we're learning by the grace of god that's going to break denominational understanding one is not everybody's in the same spot through the seven feast of redemption right and the seals don't have to happen in chronological order they can happen it's not they're ordered they're numbered but they're not numbered for chronological order necessarily and if we let that get broken in our mind a whole flood of things are going to open up let me do this let's go to the seals one two three four five six seven i'm just going to take my time i'm not going to get anywhere that i expected to get today but this is so critical that we understand that let's look at the numbers and let's try to understand the seals by something other than chronological order now just bear with me four is the number of deliverance is that right three went into the fiery furnace the fourth man was the one who delivered right it's the number of deliverance there's four stages to get to the wheat plant right i i am messing everything up stalk tassel shuck and wheat look i even got a racer look at that so now i'm going to say like brother brenham said he goes i've mapped this out on a piece of paper i may not have it all right right so don't i mean i'm just explaining something that i see so through the four church ages brother branham is it we see a destruction of the bride tree through four stages of an insect right and through four stages we see the bride tree come back right and the fourth stage brings it back to fruit which has the seed on the inside and the wheat plant goes down and the seed must fall into a ground and die lest it bite a bite alone so we see the wheat go into the ground and then come out through four stages three stages of growth but the four stages back to seed again and that's exactly what we see in the church ages when we get to the fourth church age we've come back to seed again and so we've got one two three four church ages now let's look at number five what's number five mean in the bible the number five represents grace who's under the altar jews who rejected jesus christ and for 2 000 years has rejected their messiah there is no way for them to have eternal life there is no way for them to get the white robe outside of grace it is the only way they have rejected their messiah they have crucified their messiah and they have continued for 2000 years to reject their messiah but yet they're under the sacrifice altar because god blinded them because he blinded them he won't hold them accountable and they're held in grace because they're part of the lamb's book of life and they're coming the fifth seal because the number five represents grace number six is the number of man and man in a fallen condition must be judged is that right and judgment does two things depending on whether you're seed or not judgment either purges or destroys that right so the sixth seal is the judgment seal because man in this fallen condition must be judged so under the sixth seal the earth is destroyed everything that's not of god is destroyed but there are three things that are purged under the judgment seal the 144 000 are purged the foolish virgins are purged and the earth is purged when under the sixth seal because the earth fell because man fell because man was given to me so under the man everything has to be judged under the number of man so it becomes the number of judgment that's why when jesus was on the cross it turned black about the sixth hour of the day because on the cross jesus was under the sixth seal he was under judgment so oh my mind is just exploding just bear with me 144 000 must be purged through the sixth seal the foolish virgin must be purged to the sixth seal and the earth must be purged to the sixth seal right but what about you and i because we're fallen too we come in a fallen condition amen we're just much part of the book of life as the 144 000 are we're just as much an attribute of god as the earth is is that true but all that must be persian the sixth seal and the truth of the matter is the bride must be persian the sixth seal also so when were you purged under the sixth seal you were purged under the sixth seal when you were in him nailed to the cross you were under your sixth seal and now there's no double jeopardy with god you don't have to pay twice for the same crime because you were with him on calvary under the sixth seal paying the price for all of your sins everything is judged under the sixth steel and purged under the sixth seal that's why when brother branham was looking at the seals he keeps making these statements he says he says there's just so much he says i think he's in the seventh seal or the sixth seal he says if i just told you everything that happened and make your head spin everything that i saw in that room would make your head spin make your head whirl maybe i don't remember how he said it and so brother bram says i can't hit at all and we just go around and around the clock he says but i'm just hitting the high places why is he saying all this because he says when when i saw the seals he said my bible became a new book to me because he's seeing the whole plan of redemption he's seeing everything open up so we've already been through the this is why the bride does not have to go to the tribulation period for purging she's been purged by the blood of jesus christ because that was the fullness of the word i'm part of the word i was there if i'm part of the word the fullness of the word bled and died it bled and died for me because i was part of that bleeding and dying there's no there's no jeopardy to the bride there's no danger for the bride there's no chance of being lost amen because god has already required the sacrifice and you've already been part of the sacrifice there's no way you can be lost amen god would be unjust he would defy all of his laws he would cease to be god if you were lost if he had that seed inside of you inside of jesus christ that day and now in you and you're lost then he ceases to be god because god has laws and god fulfilled his laws and you were part of the fulfillment of the law and now there's no jeopardy to you whatsoever praise god everything goes through the sixth seal everything it may not all go to the same time table but everything goes to the sixth seal in the seven what's the seven number seven represent completion and jesus christ is the complete revelation of the whole bible jesus christ is the complete revelation of god and jesus christ is all in all amen bringing us to the seventh seal which is him that's why brother branham says this is the end time seal everything finishes up on this seal why because it's the completion seal it ends the vials it ends the trumpets it ends the church ages it ends it ends destruction of the earth it even ends the ushering into the millennium everything ends time even ends on this seal because the seventh seal is completion praise be to god this is why i'm having such a hard time explaining myself because you see that just run through the whole bible i mean it just runs through the whole bible even i don't even know how to express it right but you even look in the old testament even in the old testament there was a gathering of trumpets to gather israel together and there was a tribulation that broke out and a famine in their land to bring jacob and his sons down into egypt right the circumstances that's what the trumpets were their circumstances in the earth the first world war the second world war fifth and sixth trumpet they were circumstances amen to drive israel back to her homeland to open up the way and drive her to her homeland so that she would be ungathered amen and now joseph is a perfect type of jesus christ joseph has been rejected by his brothers amen he's been thrown into the dungeon exalted on the right hand of pharaoh it's the story of jesus christ he's been given a gentile bride amen but now it is time to reveal himself to his brothers so he so now there are plagues that begin to fall there are judgments that begin the fall and there's a great famine in the land right there's a huge famine but joseph has been down here with the gentiles preparing for seven church ages preparing the gentiles for the famine and all the word is with josephs and he's the lord of all the grain all the wheat he's got the seed [Music] because he's been gathering through seven church ages amen now he's got the garner full at the end of the church [Music] and now he could let circumstances trumpets break out amen to drive them down to him amen but he cannot reveal himself and he puts him through tribulation now you're you've stolen from me now you're going to jail now i'm i'm grabbing this one and throwing him in prison you go back and tell your father come back a second time and what's he doing he's gathering little benjamin the 144 thousand he can't reveal himself to benjamin's presence and when benjamin comes present now he reveals himself to his brethren and his brethren say now will die because we're guilty we're guilty so now he's going to break to them the fifth seal and say no you meant it for evil but god meant it for good god god made you [Music] god allowed you i should say that god allowed you to reject me god allowed you to sell me out god worked this all out for your salvation to save much life to much people [Music] what is that it's the seals that's why when they open the seals my bible became a new book he opened up he took the seals off the whole bible that's what was happening now years later another christ comes moses the redeemer and they reject him too and when you reject the redeemer where do you go into the sixth seal and now in their bondage why are they in bondage anyways because they sold their brother joseph into slavery so now they have to go into slavery god's a just god all these things happened by his order they sold him to slavery now they become slaves now now moses has to go away from this people and he gets a gentile bride does the story look familiar at all at this point is it from rejected he goes into the wilderness he gets a gentile bride amen when the time is right amen the time of judgment 40 years he comes back and when he comes back moses breaks open the sixth seal because he starts to call for the same plagues that'll be in the tribulation period falling by the pro the two prophets ministry so what's he doing he's bringing them to the sixth seal and he's breaking open the sixth seal upon egypt and what happens after that he leads them back to the promised land they leads them out of egypt he leads them out and he brings them to mount sinai so that they can be married to god then they reject it then the cycle repeats then he comes in contact with him and then they reject it then he sends a prophet to him a prophet is always a type of christ brings a prophet to him restores the word to him they line up to it then through several generations of falling away amen they go back to rejecting him then a plague breaks out the sixth seal breaks open again and then chaos breaks out and then christ comes again in the form of another prophet the same story again and again and again and again the seals are so much more than white horse red horse black horse pants it's the story of redemption okay what do we say next i love the word of god it's all i can say this stuff means more to me than life this is the most thrilling thing to me and i say i may get the details wrong but the story is true the revelation is true [Music] let's go a little further into chapter 16 in our bibles and in chapter 16 we have the vials one two three four five six seven vials but there's a gap between the six and seven file my we shouldn't have we shouldn't have been surprised by now that there's a gap between the six and seven and here's the gap between the sixth and seventh file now this is where i want to wrap up for tonight if i can just on this point if i can if i can if i can if i can okay i don't know how to do this all right let's just read a couple things and see what happens i was coming back rather to hear to try to have about a 10-day meeting to speak on the subject of the seven last vials for in between those vials is the trumpets and i was telling you when i was going to preach on the seven trumpets that i would bring them in with the vials and the plagues and i thought it'd be a good time it goes on to say no i don't want to go there yet i don't want to go there yet i want to go over here brother bram says he's going to say something astounding here let's look at chapter 16 revelation chapter 16 and verse 12. we're going to look at the sixth vial and the sixth angel poured out its vial upon the great river euphrates and the water of thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared now we're going to get into the gap and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of the great day of god almighty behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garment lest he walketh naked and they see a shame and he gathered them together into a place called on the hebrew tongue armageddon that's the gap verse 17 and the seventh angel poured out his violent to the air and there came a great voice through the temple of heaven of the heaven from the throne saying it is done and there were voices and thunders and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty and earthquake and so great so brother brahms says in the message anointed ones at the end time well first i want to read this for out of trying to do god of service without it being his will from july of 1965. he says i was coming back rather here to try to about a 10-day meeting to speak on the subject of the seven last vials for in between those vials is the trumpets so the trumpets are in the gap in the vials so in the gap is everything in the gap of the seals is the trumpets in the gap of the vials is the trumpets in brother van say they all go together in one cluster he says in anointed ones at the end time so notice here something real quick while we're ending our talk notice revelation 16 13 to 14 if you want to put that down i won't have time maybe to go to it i want you to be sure and see it now notice this is the sounding between the sixth and seventh vial so brother graham's going to show you the sounding we just read it between the sixth and seventh bio he said well close we'll close out just in a minute if you can just bare mint few minutes longer closing out now notice revelation 16 13 to 14 between the sixth and seventh vial three unclean spirits like frogs did you notice that went out of the mouth of someone now notice quickly are you reading a trinity of spirits now denominational brother sit still just a minute don't get up and walk out of the room back there on the radio telephone hook up don't turn off your tape recorder off set still just a minute listen if you're born of god you will a trinity of frogs a frog is an animal that always looks backward he never looks where he's going he looks where he's coming from see don't you see there was trinitarianism born at remember three unclean spirits individual spirits are you getting it notice they look back to the nicey council where the trinity doctrine was born at not in the bible there's no such a thing they look back to the 19 council through the 19th council at nicea rome where the trinity was born to him notice where they come from notice and the trinity of frogs came out of an old trinity give birth to a new trinity their mother what it come out of a trinity the dragon the beast and the false prophet a trinity knew for when were these frogs come out this is the question listen when what's the timing when did the frogs come out when did it notice they was there all the time but it wasn't manifested until between the sixth and seventh vial just before the seals opened to reveal it so where are we in the gap between the sixth seventh vial amen in the gap between the sixth and seventh vial we see three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of three individuals three individual spirits he said they were there all along they go all the way back in the babylonian religion all the way back to the tower of babel they've been there all along but when were they revealed when did they come out they were revealed between the sixth and seventh vial just before the seals opened to reveal it so that means brother branham's ministry is in the gap between the sixth and seventh vial between the sixth and seventh trumpet between the sixth and seventh seal so many things we're looking for a way off in the future and there may be other manifestations but we've already been through this gap friends if you look at the gap at the spirits now look at verse 13 behold i come as a thief it's the coming of the lord in the gap between the sixth and seventh vial i come as a thief amen come like a thief amen he's like a thief he's not a thief because he come to get what was his and when you're taking what's yours you're not a thief but he snuck in amen he come in unawares [Applause] and then he says make sure you keep your garment so you won't be found naked that goes right back to revelation chapter 3 to the seventh church age right and then he says and he gathered them together into a place called hebrew tongue armageddon so the gap between the sixth and seventh seal includes brother branham's ministry all the way to the gathering to the battle of armageddon is in the gap so brother branham's ministry is there in the gap let's keep reading here and anointing ones at the end time for in the message of the seventh angel the mysteries of god would be known all these trinitarian things and false baptisms and everything was to be made manifest god help us to see that's truth and not think it's somebody trying to say something i feel that spirit resenting that i'm not speaking of myself brother i'm speaking of the angel of the lord that's in the camp that's exactly right notice trinity the dragon how many knows what the dragon was it was rome and the dragon stood before the woman to devour her child as soon as it was born that right what does beast mean in the bible power all right false prophet a false prophet a false anointed one see started where this is a false prophet singular false prophet the first pope and from there come out the and the mother of harlots and the whole thing a false trinity was rising not in the early days wouldn't be made manifest in the early days and went right on through with it but when the seven seals become when the seven seals become and opened those mysteries and revealed them that's when the three frogs three unclean spirits like frogs come out to manifest themselves a trinity doctrine against the truth praise the lord brother branham brought us right through the book of revelation oh friends there's something i want to get to i'm just trying with all my heart brother bam said he said when the sixth seal when it opened the persecution struck the jews in the literal standpoint he says when the six he'll come open it struck the jews in the literal standpoint and he says the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet sound at the same time so let's go back to revelation chapter nine now if we look at chapter 8 verse 13 we find an angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to sound and brother branham says that's three world wars world war one world war two world war three then you go to the fifth seal verse 12 is the end of the fifth seal it says the one woe is passed one ward war is past and behold there come two woes more hereafter and then we go into the sixth trumpet which is going to happen at the time of world war ii so now we know where we're at in the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal opens with the persecution to the jews in the literal standpoint and the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal happen at the same time open at the same time do we believe that this is good verse 13 and the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and adjacent and of brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouth issued fire smoke and brimstone by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire now brother branham says those were not natural chargers or horses he goes those were supernatural demons and they were released out of euphrates and went into the armies of hitler stalin mussolini to bring a bitter persecution against to the jews so the sixth seal opens with the persecution of the jews the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet open at the same time and world war ii and then we go to revelations 10 because brother branham's called into his ministry to go out and take a gift of healing to the peoples of the world right at the closing of world war ii his life is matching the scriptures and then he finishes his ministry then the bride takes an easter little book and prophesies again then it goes to the two witnesses which will prophesy in the three and a half year tribulation period then they'll be killed then they'll raise again and then you'll come to verse 14. the second woe is past and behold the third world cometh quickly and then the seventh angel sounded so all of this happens between the second and third world wars where are we at we're long past the second world war the horrors is shaking and trembling they know war could break out anymore where are we friends all of this has to happen between the second and third world war brother breton's life matches the bible and now our lives in time and the news and everything that's going on is matching the bible for us too it's all happening the same way so those those demons were released out of the river euphrates they went into the armies they brought a bitter persecution he said they shot them that they had no more bullets they gassed them till they ran out of gas he said they put bubbles in their veins they did every horrible thing to them and he says what was it the spirit of rome he said no it was germany and it was no he says they did the same thing to the jews that they did to the early christians showing it was the same roman spirit amen come back and brought a persecution and that was to drive them back to the promised land let's go to the gap between the 6th and 7th seal in revelation chapter 7. we saw the four angels released that were bound in the euphrates right they were released they released the army the army went in and persecuted the jews driving them back to their homeland but then in chapter seven verse one it says and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor the sea nor any tree and i saw another angel ascend from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads and then you go to the ceiling of 144 thousand what was it those four angels were holding the winds and brother branham says winds are wars and strife these are four angels holding the winds and and they the world war ii took place the armies went out but after it accomplished their purpose amen to get the jews to go back to their homeland he says now you stop don't hurt it no more until we finish sealing the hundred and forty four thousand so that's why war two stopped and that's why it was on hold but guess what those demons didn't go back into euphrates when they were released they were released and they're still waging war just somewhere different so the sixth seal the sixth trumpet sounds at the same time and let's go to the sixth vial let's go back to chapter 16. and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates it's euphrates again isn't that amazing the sixth trumpet was euphrates the demons came out the four angels were released the demons came now now the now the sixth angel pours out on euphrates and the waters thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared and brother branham has something to say about this he says in the feast of trumpets he said now revelation the ninth chapter the 13th verse notice real close under the sixth trumpet under the sixth trumpet note there was two hundred thousand horsemen that had been bound in the river euphrates was turned loose under the sixth trumpet now there's not two hundred thousand horsemen in the world but there was two hundred thousand horsemen noticed i want you to jot it down so you can read it they wasn't natural horses they breathed fire they had breastplates of jasper they had tails and the end of the tail looked like a serpent a snake said on the end of it stinging it was spiritual horses spiritual devils chargers that had been bound in euphrates all these years supernatural devils what was it the old roman empire being revived the persecution of the jews they had been bound for nearly two thousand years at the river euphrates can't cross to the promise can't cross can't cross euphrates what has to happen to your phrase to cross it dried up dried up can't cross to the promise a religious sect that was trying to get to the other side euphrates you know come through eden but they were bound there two hundred thousand devils of persecution and notice what happens under the sixth trumpet they were turned loose on the jews the persecution of the new supernatural devils nearly two thousand years then loosed by stalin hitler upon the jews further and he says there is that roman empire bound there by what the ecclesiastical powers which rome pagan rome became papal rome and was bound there in its traditions of christian what was binding it what was keeping it from crossing over one sect wanted to cross over to the other one when the demons were released out of euphrates they went and brought a physical persecution against the physical people but they also want to cross over to the other side and now euphrates has to dry up so that they can cross over to the other side but they're bound by religious tradition trying to make believe they're christian when it's nothing but pagan rome trinity doctrine worship of devils worship of dead saints it's nothing but devil worship and trying to pretend it's christian but it can't cross until euphrates dries up and euphrates doesn't dry up until the sixth vial and brother branham tells us when those demons were released out of the river euphrates they went into stalin hitler the armies of staller hitler mussolini brought a bitter persecution against the jews but then when that war stopped and he said to hold the winds stop the wars we're going to seal them now those demons crossed over euphrates and went into the ecumenical movement that started in 1962 with the vatican ii council and the vatican ii council was the vatican's ecumenical move from 62 to december 8th of 1965 and what was it it was the catholic church it was the demon powers the old roman empire crossing over and mixing with the protestants so brother brown tells us he says what was holding he said the ecclesiastical realm was still holding why because the protestants wouldn't mix with the catholics as long as there was still some word in that river as long as the protestants still had a word barrier trusting in the word believing the word separating them from the old pagan traditions amen but when they when they didn't care about the word anymore and all they cared about was their church anymore and the waters began to dry up and when they no longer cared about the word nobody cared if they mixed with the catholic church in an ecumenical move anymore after that comes the seals because brother ben says seals come at the revelation of the three unclean spirits in the gap between the sixth and seventh trumpet showing you brother branham had to be here at this time when this happened and he pointed to the ecumenical mood in the world council churches and said there it is where did those demons go they went into the world council of churches to bring a persecution against the denomination no against the bride but they'll never be successful because before they do it he'll whisk her away what's fighting you two hundred thousand two hundred million demons the same ones that shot bubbles in the veins of the jews and burnt them and gave them cyanide and all these other stuff what is that that's what's trying to fight you to get you to disbelieve the word and back down and compromise on it and not move forward in the light and settle down and have a denomination out of the message that's those demons are trying to do but they've been exposed by the prophet amen by his ministry that came in the gap between the sixth and seventh vial friends amen there i've got tons of quotes on this go read go read the notes we post them on the line and i might get back into some more of this but we're running out of time but let's go to the seventh vial 17 and the seventh angel poured out his violin to the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from from the throne saying it is done and there were voices and thunders and lightnings there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake and so great brother banham comes to the end of his ministry and in april of 1965 he's in los angeles california now this will be the last time he's ever in los angeles california and he's going to preach a message called choosing of the bride the last time he's in los angeles los angeles brother branham calls it uh he calls it like a mystery babylon it's the millstone that'll be cast into the sea he's all the way out the last part of the ministry the last time he'll be in los angeles and he's standing in los angeles preaching choosing of the bride and for his opening scripture reading he chooses two scriptures two scriptures the first one is eliezer praying that god will help him find a wife for isaac brother branham is preaching choosing of a bride brother branham's the eleazar for the day in his opening scripture and choosing la he said civilization has traveled from the east to the west now it's on the west coast and it can't go any farther it's bumping against the barrier and splashing back now civil and he said the gospel has traveled with civilization so now he's in los angeles california and he's at the end of at the end of the church ages the end of the gospel the end of civilization you see what i'm saying and he chooses two scripture readings the first one is eliezer praying to help him find a bride for isaac and the second scripture reading is revelation 21 and the ninth verse and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither and i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife does the first scripture reading pertain to brother bannon's ministry does the second scripture reading pertain to brother banham's ministry who showed us the bride the lamb's wife who did it it was one of the seven angels having one of the seven last plagues and we know that seven names that that angel to be the seventh angel so he's the seventh angel here is he probably the fifth angel over here and the third angel over here or is he the seventh angel see we have no problem saying brother branham fulfilled eleazar he fulfilled that was eliezer when he says when he's there at the beginning of choosing of a bride he's saying oh uh are you praying the prayer eliezer would you would you would you send a bride for isaac and everybody says that's brother brandon's ministry then he says then came to me one of the seven uh some the vile angels having one of the seven last plagues and and said to me i'll show you the bride the lamb's wife who was that i don't know can you say that was brother branham too can you say he's one of those vile angels can you say he's the one who came between the sixth and seventh vial and opened up the seals between the sixth and seventh vial can you say he's the vile angel that showed you the the lamb's wife the bride nobody in the message will fault you for saying he's eliezer but they'll sure look at you crooked for saying he's the seventh vial angel but he's the one who chose the scripture reading not me he's the one who read it at the beginning of choosing of the bride and when you read the seventh vial it says the seventh angel poured out his violent to the air and there was great voices out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done and there were voices and thunders and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty and earth awakened so great and brother branham at the beginning of choosing of a bride brings two scriptures eleazar and the vile angel pouring out the seventh vial amen and then at the end of choosing of a bride brother branham says oh capernaum capernaum that was exalted thyself above the angels if the mighty works have been done in you they've been done there you know whatever whatever he said he says but you'll be in the bottom of the sea the millstone cast into the sea what's brother branham doing he's predicting a giant earthquake that'll sink los angeles who is he what's he doing he's pouring out a vial friends he's a vile angel his ministry came between the sixth and seventh vial and here he comes at the end of his ministry all the way on the west coast saying it is done you are finished civilization is over the churches is over and there's nothing left but destruction praise be to god how much more do we have to go how much more do we have to wait on friends he's fulfilled the book of revelation there's more to happen but not for you and i he's brought us all the way through till we get to revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the bride say come which is exactly what is taking place in revelation 10 8-11 eating the little book and prophesying again saying come on come out from among her my people and come now have you seen the road map where are we well we got away from them vials i'm not waiting for no vials i saw it poured out we got to wait for them trumpets and the trumpets have sounded right what's the revelation i don't know i won't be here for that the two witnesses will be the ones who give that but when they start preaching they're going to be preaching history like the seals were preaching history what are all the plagues that i don't know what all the plagues were but i know what the six was the sixth was the drawing up of the separation between paganism and christianity where they're now comfortable joining themselves together to bring a persecution against the bride i know what the sixth vial was and i know what the seventh was it's a judgment that's gonna bring a great earthquake what's the rest of them i don't know they don't even have to happen in sequence remember our lesson from the seals they don't even have to happen in sequence this book of revelation is the bride's book and this book of revelation has been opened up friends it's been opened up but i for one i don't want to speak for anybody else but i for one have been afraid to move into it because it's risky to say those things it sounds to denominational understanding like it could be wrong but it's what the prophet told us it's what he taught and it's what he showed us amen and he told the bride she's got to read between the lines what lines eleazar my first scripture vile angel my second scripture and i come and brother branham wasn't planning on prophesying the sinking of los angeles when he started that do you understand that he said he didn't even know he prophesied he had to go back and listen to the tape again in the beginning he says somebody asked me amen there was another earthquake this morning or yesterday or whatever it was the one in seattle and he says they're asking me could that happen here he says i don't know maybe maybe not and he's pondering the issue but he doesn't know and he's not planning on saying that he picks his opening scriptures by inspiration and god the holy ghost falls upon him till he doesn't know what he's saying and at the end of that message he's pouring the file out in los angeles praise be to god amen it's all finished it's all done what's he doing now he's not in the churches he's done with the churches he's finished with the churches now he's bringing the last bride in amen so that he can get her out of the way so that he can turn to the two witnesses in revelations 11 to call the 144 000. two things have to happen now he's got to get the last bride to the revelation and he's got to get the last of the 144 000 into the promised land are they there i don't know is they here i don't know i don't know who's where and who's what but when he gets both of those things in place we take our flight we're not waiting for new information we're not waiting for a new message we're not waiting for another happening we're waiting for that last member to come in and 144 000 to be in position and our time is done and we're gone until then we're in revelations 10 11. prophesy again to kings and nations and we're in revelation 22 17 the bride and the spirit say come that's our commission saying what he said prophesy again not a new prophecy a repeat of the prophecy that's already come oh i just wish i understood revelations if we would just believe what the prophet said we would understand the book of revelations if we would just let him use the scriptures he wants to use to describe what's happening and trust him to pick the right scriptures then we understand the book of revelations but too many times old carnal understanding and old denominational teaching is tagged along and we say well that's for the future and that's not for us and so we're just going to stay here in the first few chapters of the book of revelation because the trumpets aren't for us and the vials aren't for us and it's all for us the whole book is for us it's all been open for us so that we can understand what day we live in what has happened what's transpired who we are and what our responsibilities are what a day to be alive what a day to be alive let's all stand oh i'm sorry that was a lot of information that's a lot of overload but i didn't even get to a fraction of it friends my my heart is so full it's almost like when god when god lifts your eyes to another layer then all of a sudden it all fills in we talk about the lantern you hold that lantern up and right at the edge of the lantern you can see the next step in the road but when you get up there to the next step everything around that on the else courts and all around now is illuminated and when you get up here all of a sudden everything opens up and i can see what's to the right i can see what's to the left i can see all this other stuff it's the same thing in the word of god every revelation opens up from genesis to revelation you move forward in the word again and it opens up from genesis to revelation you move forward in the word again that's that's why it's such an exciting thing the stimulation of revelation and from the initial illumination of the church ages come the seals and out of the seals come the trumpets out of the trumpets come the vile until the whole of revelation is open before our wondering eyes and we edified and purified by it i don't know about you but i'm edified let it purify us oh god let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father we thank you god for your word we thank you for the revelation of this hour lord forgive me if i've got details wrong or if i said things in a wrong way you know my heart lord god i just see what you're showing me i see what your prophet is saying i pray god that you would just give us the wisdom lord to start to express lord what you're showing to us as your bride in this day god take the words jumbled up and broken and crisscrossed and drawn out and sketched and read too quickly take it all lord and put it together in the hearts of your waiting children lord bring revelation by your spirit lord that they might catch the heart and meat of what's being said and the purpose behind it lord we love you and we just want to give ourselves to you afresh purge us and clean us by your word lord guide us by your holy spirit use us for your glory i pray o god in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you i i had quotes for everything i said i think but i had lots of quotes and they're going to be posted on the archives there's a little section that says notes you can download and read them i might get to them later this is something i want to go through again and again because sometimes something doesn't click the first time sometimes it's the second or third time through but i tell you what go listen to it again go through the notes because the book of revelation is opened up and the book of revelation is the revelation of jesus christ and jesus christ is my husband our mate our bridegroom and the book of revelation isn't scary is it something to be avoided it's the revelation of jesus christ our bridegroom and the prophet opened the book of revelation friends he opened it we just have to trust him and quit hanging back fearful because the baptist ideas all this happens in the tribulation period but if the prophet said it i say it's good stuff and i can believe it and i can believe the way he believed and if we get anything wrong god will show us friends because our motive isn't wrong our heart isn't wrong our desire isn't wrong we just got to be brave enough to move forward and say that's nothing but the truth that's exactly what he said praise be to god i understand what that's about amen praise god pray for me pray for me there's there's you don't understand how inadequate and un incapable i am of sharing what's in my heart you have no idea and you'll say many of you will say that was good brother chad i got it it was wonderful i understood what you were saying but i know the mess i know what he's showing and i know the the the revelation that's sparking off in my heart that i can't even see him put in the words i know how much better it actually is and i'm trusting for him to take all the pieces and bring it down to a reality in you and you say it's wonderful well explain it to me i can't but it's wonderful amen i'm hoping what takes place on this and takes place on that end because it's wonderful our husband is wonderful our bridegroom is wonderful his word is beautiful to me i love it all and everything we talked about today was history history all these things that we thought were future we're now looking at them from what the prophet said and we find out they're in the past that's why brother branham said over and over it may be later than you think [Music] over and over it may be later than you think i got a good i have a good impression it was later than what they were thinking it's been later than what i was thinking i said god open our eyes open our eyes to see all of the word lord i want to see all of my husband oh i want him fully revealed amen let's sing brother well i'm resting on the finished work of jesus christ today all circumstances will be gone the word of god will still remain [Music] i am bound for victory i am free my new day [Music] who i truly am i [Music] his am all things are possible with god are possible with god a great commission from my lord i have now received the prince of power of the air will never have a part in me as amateur creator i can change the atmosphere [Music] many spirits who i truly are [Music] are possible with god all things are possible with god he is the same today [Applause] the prophet came to show the life the pride must have it on display the hour has come for christ in us to be completely glorified want the spirit to be free to do the greater works in me i am free my new day has come now i can be who i truly am i am covered by his love all these are possible with god all things are possible with god i am who i truly am i am all these [Music] you know revelation is everything revelation on the word it's our inoculation to reasoning it's our inoculation the false doctrine revelation on the word of god that came through a prophet amen is our inoculation against denominational thinking against our own thinking once you see the structure of the bible matching time history world war one world war ii between world war ii and world war three everything happens in the gap between the sixth and seventh seals six and seven trump at six and seven five and we can look and see it all happen and somebody comes and says you know there's no record that 16 men fell off a bridge at jeffersonville what have you read the bible have you looked at the book of revelations you think this man made this up you think he was born just before world war one broke out you think he was here when world war ii come do you think he was there and made khrushchev found a shoe on the desk when the five kings come together from west north west and east do you think he made that cloud appear [Music] i mean what are you talking about 16 people that fall off a bridge who cares i mean have you not read the bible have you not looked at what happened amen the revelation of what's happened in our day finding it in the scriptures seeing it in history seeing it in our lives is the inoculation against all false lies and all kinds of nonsense what is it it's the revelation of the word as the keeping power for the bride why because she sees that ministry in the bible friends all the way books through the revelation and furthermore she sees herself in there along with the seventh angel there's the spirit and the bride say come you can't move the bride off of this word she's right she's rooted and grounded in the word of god that's become a living reality in the day that we're alive whole world's talking about tension with iran tension with china tension with russia new nuclear bombs from russia all kinds of trade wars and problems in the south china sea and there's always these little rumors world war three world war three oh when you hear that you should get so excited inside because hey you know what the two prophets ministry has to take place before the third woe under the second woe praise be to god i'll be gone before they start ministering if they start shooting ships in the south china sea i'm getting excited if north korea gets more nukes i'm getting excited if russia diplomacy falls apart with u.s diplomacy praise be to god i'm out of here before revelations 11. why because i see the scriptures i know where i'm at and i know what the news means [Music] she's inoculated against all the lies and all the ridicule and all the scorn she's been inoculated by what by revelation of the word [Music] don't let it trouble you that i said brother branham poured out the seventh vial in los angeles and there was no great earthquake in los angeles hasn't sunk because when a prophet does something and says something it doesn't have to happen for years and years and years and years somebody's got to do something to put it in action brother branham had to throw a stone in the air to start a whirlwind that would create he said see you've got to do something to make something else happen while that prophet was here he had to pour that vial out even if it would be decades before that los angeles would sing he had to pour it out while he was here remember jacob was a prophet and when laban come looking for his idols [Music] jacob said nobody here has him search the tents whoever took your idols will die is that what he said then find the idols rebecca had stolen she put him in her in in her in her goods and she was sitting on it when her father comes in lied hid it but jacob already said whoever took him will die years and years and years later rachel's alive she's alive she's alive she bears joseph after joseph comes benjamin she dies in childbirth with benjamin why because jacob said whoever stole those items would die it doesn't matter if it comes years later he had to pour out the prophecy right then and that prophecy would take effect when she was done fulfilling her purpose rachel had to bring forth benjamin when benjamin's born she's gone brother branham had to pour that vial out while he's here because he was one of the seven vile angels having one of the seven last spies [Music] praise god you know what's going to happen for sure los angeles is going to sink in a giant earthquake that's sure it's already been poured out it's already been spoken the prophet has already stood on the ground and declared the judgment he's already done something to set something in order and i guarantee the wheels are in motion now for a giant collapse of the west coast why because a prophet put it in motion prophecy sure your position in prophecy is sure praise god hallelujah we love the lord oh let's sing something else [Music] it's already victory is white it's already done one more time yes it's already [Music] the battle is over victory is one it's already done it's already mine it's already [Applause] it's [Applause] is already the victory is already mine and i'm already i'm the already is over the victory is [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Music] is [Applause] oh yes i'm already [Music] it's already done well it's already done it's already it's already done [Applause] [Music] it's already it's already done [Music] no one else can touch my heart like you do i could search for all eternity lord and find there is none else can touch my heart like you do and i could search for all eternity lord and find there is none like you sing it again well there is none like nobody else can touch my heart like you do i could and search there is [Applause] [Music] [Music] in my mind [Applause] [Music] they i can't explain here in my soul foreign [Applause] i feel [Music] [Music] and i know his it's moving me to hear my oh lord please come and take control i feel the pull i went to [Music] [Applause] he was drawing me to give a higher praise i know for [Music] sure i feel i know his fear is to me [Music] [Music] go ahead and have your seats we'll just sing this again quietly as the deacons begin to dismiss i feel i hear the call [Music] [Applause] moving me [Music] and i agree [Music] i feel the poor [Music] free he was drawing me to give a higher praise [Music] like a great bag i know for sure i'll reach the goal because i feel [Music] i hear the call [Music] moving me [Music] and i agree [Music] oh lord please come and take [Music] [Music] i can face tomorrow [Music] all fear is gone because i know yes i know he holds the future will life is worth the living just because he lives and because he lives i can face too much [Music] because he lives all fear is gone because i know yes i know he holds my future and life is worth the living just because he lives [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you
