[0:00] oh jesus
[0:18] oh lamb of god
[0:23] worth is your name
[0:32] praise be to god amen it's good to see
[0:35] you on this cold
[0:36] wintry snowy evening we praise god for
[0:40] being here safely and trust that will
[0:41] keep you all safe on the roads tonight
[0:44] and while we're standing let's just turn
[0:45] to john chapter 5.
[0:48] we're going to continue on in the series
[0:50] we're on and search the scriptures
[0:52] amen it's been hard to get away from so
[0:54] we're not going to fight it anymore
[0:55] we're just going to stick here
[0:57] amen and see what god will do well we're
[0:59] standing let's look at john chapter 5
[1:01] verse 39
[1:04] it says search the scriptures for in
[1:05] them you think you have eternal life
[1:07] and they are they which testify of me
[1:11] let's bow our heads dear heavenly father
[1:13] we thank you lord for the reading of the
[1:14] word
[1:16] but lord anybody with literacy can read
[1:18] words lord
[1:19] we need more than that we need more than
[1:21] what our minds can give us lord
[1:23] more than what an education can provide
[1:26] we need you to come down lord and give
[1:28] us a personal revelation of this
[1:30] by yourself lord that you would reveal
[1:32] to us yourself that we might see you
[1:34] for who you are in this hour at this
[1:36] time for god
[1:38] we love you lord and we love what you're
[1:40] doing and what you're revealing and
[1:42] we just give ourselves to you that you
[1:43] might have total and complete
[1:45] preeminence amongst your bride
[1:47] we ask that you take control of the
[1:48] service take these lips lord under your
[1:50] control
[1:51] to speak your words of eternal life in
[1:54] jesus christ's name we pray
[1:56] amen you can be seated
[1:59] we're gonna i'm gonna read a couple
[2:00] quotes here and then we're gonna jump
[2:02] back over to matthew chapter one
[2:04] it's amazing the more we look the more
[2:06] we find in the first few verses of the
[2:08] new testament
[2:09] so there's so much laying there and we
[2:12] just want to explore that
[2:14] you know i used to used to be when i
[2:16] would read the bible
[2:18] and then probably the least interesting
[2:19] part of the bible was the genealogies
[2:22] you'd get to the genealogies and it's
[2:24] like blah blah blah you don't even try
[2:25] to pronounce all the names it's just
[2:27] like
[2:27] you know z name a name m name in name
[2:30] and you're just skipping through it
[2:31] until you can get to the other stuff but
[2:33] now all of a sudden it's amazing the
[2:35] revelations that
[2:36] are laying in the genealogies because
[2:38] god wanted to place it in the bible
[2:40] and if he wanted to place it in the
[2:42] bible there's some benefit to it there's
[2:44] some reason
[2:45] that it's laying there and i say thank
[2:47] god and give us
[2:48] eyes to see more there's there's the
[2:50] more that god
[2:51] is revealing himself the more he's
[2:53] showing us he's taking scriptures that
[2:55] we've read but not
[2:56] understood places where he's been hiding
[2:59] but we've never seen him
[3:00] and he begins to unfold and we see him
[3:02] in plain sight
[3:04] in places where he was hidden before now
[3:06] we see clearly
[3:08] and if he's doing that what about the
[3:10] rest of the bible i mean there's a this
[3:11] is a big book
[3:12] and he's hiding all over here amen the
[3:15] threefold purpose his plan that he had
[3:17] before the foundation of the world it's
[3:19] been unfolding itself through this
[3:20] entire scripture
[3:22] so he's hiding all over the place he's
[3:25] just waiting for the bride to come
[3:27] and dig out the nuggets and find where
[3:29] he is amen
[3:31] brother brahm says in christ is the
[3:32] mystery of god revealed so notice now
[3:35] down through the ages he has been
[3:36] gradually letting this out
[3:39] slowly unfolding the mystery through the
[3:41] prophets and through the types
[3:43] now he can just go on to that and
[3:46] express himself
[3:47] so gradually slowly he's been letting
[3:50] the mystery out
[3:51] through the prophets and through the
[3:53] types the further down in the same
[3:55] message is all those things typed him
[3:58] just in type but yet the mystery was hid
[4:01] so he's been in the types he's been in
[4:03] the prophets amen he's been in all this
[4:05] he's been in the genealogies amen but
[4:08] he's been hid
[4:09] in there the mystery was hid them men
[4:12] didn't know what they were doing they
[4:14] only knew that they were led by the
[4:15] spirit to do some
[4:18] now holding it back in the last days for
[4:20] the great revelation
[4:22] but expressing it expressing himself in
[4:24] moses so now we know he's been
[4:26] expressing it in time
[4:28] but never revealing the mystery never
[4:30] revealing the secret
[4:32] amen but holding it back to the last
[4:34] days for the great revelation
[4:37] because the great revelation is the
[4:39] theme of the entire bible
[4:40] the great revelation is christ the
[4:43] mystery of god revealed amen
[4:45] so to get the mystery of god revealed
[4:47] you have to see christ
[4:48] and christ is the mystery of god
[4:51] revealed
[4:52] so he's been holding it back for the
[4:54] great revelation but
[4:56] expressing it expressing himself in
[4:58] moses and david and joseph and elijah
[5:01] and on down through we we could take
[5:03] each one of those prophets and bring
[5:04] their lives out and show it expresses
[5:06] jesus christ
[5:07] perfectly exactly yet never giving is
[5:11] secret in full
[5:13] so he can go back and he can show hey it
[5:15] expresses christ perfectly
[5:17] amen and in this aspect it's perfect and
[5:20] in this aspect
[5:21] and it's showing this angle of christ in
[5:23] this thing on christ but
[5:24] yet and though it shows it so perfectly
[5:27] in time
[5:27] yet it never gives us secret and full
[5:32] waiting for to make it known in the last
[5:35] days as he promised
[5:36] waiting for it to be fully comprehended
[5:39] see before he could express it
[5:42] hallelujah now it's been waiting and
[5:44] waiting for this great revelation
[5:46] waiting for it to be known waiting for
[5:48] the last days
[5:49] waiting for that to be known but not
[5:52] known to the whole world amen
[5:54] only known to the seed only known to the
[5:57] christ seed only known to the elect
[5:59] only known to the bride amen so the
[6:01] mystery has been held back but it's been
[6:03] declared
[6:04] it's been shown but it's been shown in
[6:06] types and in shadows
[6:07] and in the prophets and then in the
[6:09] genealogies and in everything else
[6:11] it's been shown but never the secret
[6:13] given in full
[6:14] holding back waiting till the last days
[6:17] for it to be revealed
[6:18] but it's not revealed to everybody it's
[6:21] only revealed to a
[6:22] certain small percentage of the people
[6:24] that are on earth
[6:25] and they are the elect predestinated
[6:27] bride of jesus christ
[6:29] he's only giving the love secrets to his
[6:31] wife
[6:33] and that's why you know sometimes the
[6:35] message becomes so complicated
[6:37] amen for for individuals because the
[6:39] message is not supposed to be
[6:41] intellectually learned and this is a
[6:44] this is a point that if we could just
[6:46] catch this and hold on to it
[6:48] it would help us so much amen it's not
[6:50] that we can come down
[6:52] and then i can teach you the message and
[6:54] as i teach it to you you can learn it
[6:56] like you learned algebra or like you
[6:58] learn trigonometry or
[7:00] any kind of difficult science physics
[7:02] you know physics is hard it's hard to
[7:04] grasp
[7:05] it's difficult to catch but with a good
[7:07] teacher and enough time
[7:08] we can work you up to where you can
[7:10] accomplish calculations in physics
[7:12] the message is not that way
[7:16] it doesn't matter how good a teacher we
[7:17] have and how much time we have and how
[7:20] slow we go
[7:21] amen and how often we explain it it's
[7:23] only to be known
[7:25] by revelation in fact brother brennan
[7:28] preaches
[7:29] when he comes to the third pool of his
[7:31] ministry he preaches it in such a
[7:33] strange way
[7:34] amen because he comes to the seventh
[7:36] seal and he's moving down through the
[7:39] seventh seal
[7:40] and as he gets down there he starts he
[7:42] stops and he starts looking back and
[7:44] starts pointing to visions
[7:46] he says remember the tent vision amen
[7:48] remember the vision of the
[7:50] baby shoe and me trying to string the
[7:51] thread so you can't teach
[7:53] spiritual things to the pentecostal
[7:55] babies remember the fishing line the
[7:57] first
[7:58] pool the second pool and he he's
[8:00] preaching the seventh seal
[8:01] and he's taking you right back to the
[8:03] visions amen and showing
[8:05] first pull i explained too much second
[8:07] pull i explained too much
[8:08] but when it come to the third pool he
[8:10] said now don't explain
[8:12] this so he's preaching the seven seals
[8:15] and he goes through that he starts
[8:17] showing this and showing that
[8:18] and he says now the sword in the hand he
[8:20] said this is this is your third pull and
[8:23] he and he says the
[8:24] remember the constellation of angels and
[8:26] sunset mountain and he's talking about
[8:28] all this
[8:28] and he says now i said i feel to stop
[8:31] right here
[8:35] stop you know i remember the first few
[8:36] times i read that
[8:38] i'm getting so excited and like like
[8:40] he's showing us the vision
[8:41] he's showing a sunset mount he's talking
[8:43] about the king's sword
[8:45] all right now he's going to come and tie
[8:47] all of this together and my heart
[8:48] i remember reading the seal book one
[8:50] time and i'm really digesting it and i'm
[8:53] going all the way through
[8:54] and i'm sitting there and i'm getting
[8:57] excited i'm anticipating the punchline's
[8:59] coming
[9:00] the punchline is coming he's going to
[9:01] tie it all together explain it and tell
[9:03] me what all of these visions
[9:04] all of these symbols and all these
[9:06] happenings meant and it gets
[9:08] to that point he says now i feel to stop
[9:09] right there
[9:11] i said no don't stop right there
[9:15] but see he said don't explain
[9:19] this this is not to be explained
[9:23] that's why brother branham would go and
[9:25] say now i hope you're reading between
[9:27] the lines
[9:27] now i haven't said it all but i've said
[9:29] just enough that if you're spiritual
[9:31] you'll catch what i'm talking about
[9:32] amen he doesn't have one message that
[9:35] you can come to one
[9:36] message where brother branham is now
[9:37] going to lay out the third pull
[9:39] the seventh seal and make it simple for
[9:41] everybody to understand
[9:43] so you go take this one message and you
[9:45] read through and by the time you get
[9:46] there
[9:46] it'll be easily explained he's not
[9:49] allowed to
[9:50] do that he is specifically told not to
[9:52] do that
[9:53] so the only way he can do it is come
[9:55] along and start preaching
[9:57] and start ripping types out of the bible
[9:59] types out of the bible
[10:01] in every message he's pulling this type
[10:03] of this one and this type of this one
[10:05] and then he starts saying now do you
[10:06] remember sunset mountain
[10:08] now do you remember sabino canyon now
[10:10] you remember this
[10:11] and he's trying to show you without
[10:14] telling you
[10:15] what's happening because he's told
[10:18] not to explain it and the confusing part
[10:22] is
[10:22] when you start to see the theme that
[10:24] he's pointing at
[10:25] and when he starts to point at this
[10:27] scriptural type in this pattern
[10:29] he comes and he preaches this day this
[10:31] scripture's fulfilled
[10:34] and he's placing us exactly in the
[10:36] scriptures where we
[10:37] are where jesus stopped his ministry he
[10:41] has to come back
[10:42] and pick the ministry up now and the
[10:44] vengeance
[10:45] of the day of our lord amen and now
[10:47] brother branham's coming
[10:49] he has this supernatural experience when
[10:50] he's breaching birth pains
[10:52] which is the sixth seal which is the
[10:54] judgment of the earth
[10:55] and he has his experience now where his
[10:57] pages stick together
[10:58] a priest has to come and he says he's in
[11:01] all of his robes and he's got his name
[11:02] he's in full priest garb amen it
[11:05] couldn't be another preacher in a suit
[11:06] god had it so ordained that you wouldn't
[11:09] miss
[11:09] that this is exactly what happened when
[11:11] jesus amen was in nazareth
[11:15] and he says here read it out of my book
[11:18] because the priest handed him the scroll
[11:20] and he read it
[11:23] jesus reads it brother brennam reads it
[11:25] he hands it back to the priest amen
[11:29] and then he goes on preaching birth
[11:30] pains he goes on preaching judgment
[11:32] and then he goes on praying what's he
[11:34] preaching he's preaching the latter half
[11:36] of the verse where jesus stopped 2000
[11:39] years before
[11:40] and now this whole scene takes place so
[11:42] that you and i can see
[11:44] this is the son of man ministry this is
[11:46] jesus christ
[11:47] and he's come back and he's picking up
[11:49] right where he left off
[11:53] and brother branham comes and he
[11:55] preaches amen this day the scripture's
[11:57] fulfilled
[11:58] and in there he starts laying out all of
[12:00] this stuff
[12:03] amen but he can't sit you down
[12:09] and he can't say now i'm malachi 4.
[12:14] and revelations 10 1 happened exactly
[12:17] like this
[12:19] and when i said this it was this
[12:21] scripture
[12:23] and when i got to the seventh thunders
[12:25] when i was preaching the seals
[12:26] i was actually christ with a loud roar
[12:29] thundering out seven thunders under
[12:31] their voice he said he can't do that
[12:33] he's not allowed to do that the angel
[12:36] told him not to do that amen
[12:38] that is not to be explained it's to be
[12:41] revealed
[12:42] to the predestinated bride
[12:44] [Music]
[12:46] and so now we'll start quote searches
[12:49] and
[12:50] quote wars and he said this and he said
[12:52] that and he said this
[12:54] amen brother branham was not explaining
[12:57] it in detail
[12:58] he was expecting us to pick up the theme
[13:01] of the ministry
[13:02] to read between the lines to catch what
[13:05] he didn't say
[13:07] one of these days i'm going to put
[13:08] together all of those quotes and i'm
[13:10] just going to come up and throw them up
[13:11] here so we could read them amen so you
[13:13] could catch
[13:13] what i didn't say so you could read
[13:15] between the lines i said just enough
[13:17] that you the spiritual will catch it
[13:19] amen he's not allowed to explain the
[13:22] third pull
[13:22] the seventh seal amen it's not his job
[13:25] to get you to understand it it's his job
[13:28] to preach it
[13:29] amen and it's the job of christ himself
[13:32] to reveal it to the bride
[13:33] and the bride will catch it her eyes
[13:35] will come open she says that's it that's
[13:37] him
[13:38] that's my mate the revealed word that's
[13:41] my husband
[13:43] and if that's my husband and he's
[13:44] unveiled himself to me that must mean
[13:47] i'm the bride
[13:48] [Applause]
[13:50] amen god's not just going around
[13:53] unveiling himself to every girl that's
[13:54] out there amen
[13:56] he's only unveiling himself in the
[13:58] secret chamber and the third pull
[14:01] amen in the holy of holies and only to
[14:03] his wife
[14:07] hallelujah so you can get into all kinds
[14:10] of debates and wars
[14:12] and ideas because we've missed the
[14:15] simplicity
[14:16] of the fact that the third pull was not
[14:19] to be
[14:20] explained you say well brother ben
[14:22] didn't say it that way
[14:23] brother branham wasn't allowed to say it
[14:26] that way
[14:29] brother branham after the seals he comes
[14:31] to a place where he says
[14:32] now we all know we're waiting for this
[14:34] one this prophet to show up and come on
[14:36] the scene
[14:37] he said that after the seals so i'm
[14:39] going to take a quote after the seals
[14:40] and that quote if i take it as an
[14:43] absolute
[14:44] fact that means brother branham could
[14:46] not be the fulfillment of malachi 4 in
[14:48] revelation 10 7.
[14:56] he says sometimes things are said in a
[14:58] certain way just to throw them off
[15:01] he can't tell you i'm malachi 4.
[15:06] he can't tell you this is elohim in
[15:09] flesh
[15:10] all he can do is read the story and then
[15:13] turn around at the end of service
[15:15] and start descending discerning the
[15:17] thoughts and the people's heart behind
[15:18] him
[15:18] but he can't tell you elohim is here
[15:22] in this prophet amen all he can do is
[15:24] read the scriptures and display the sign
[15:27] of the messiah
[15:28] it's not to be explained it's to be
[15:30] revealed
[15:33] hallelujah they say
[15:37] brother branham never said this and he
[15:40] never said that
[15:40] oh he most certainly did
[15:43] but he said it to the bride he didn't
[15:47] say it to the public amen
[15:48] he said it to the bride well on what
[15:51] tape is he only speaking to the bride
[15:53] all of them especially
[15:57] amen when you get down into the ministry
[15:59] brother brennan preaches the seals and
[16:00] he's going out
[16:01] and you can still hear him preaching in
[16:03] an evangelistic way
[16:05] after the seals he comes to the end of
[16:07] 1963 i believe it's a message in
[16:09] december of 1963
[16:11] and he's away from his home church and
[16:12] he's preaching to the people
[16:14] amen and he's come to the end of the
[16:15] service and he's calling an altar call
[16:17] calling people to repent
[16:18] and he makes the statement how do you
[16:20] know that your name
[16:22] won't be the last name that's written in
[16:25] the lamb's book of life tonight
[16:27] and then the book will be closed and not
[16:28] another name written
[16:32] now that's exactly contrary to what he
[16:34] teaches as a doctrinal fact
[16:36] he says nowhere in any place is there
[16:38] ever
[16:39] uh in the scriptures a record where
[16:42] jesus christ is currently compiling
[16:44] names
[16:46] he said that was compiled before the
[16:47] foundation of the world no names being
[16:49] added to it amen
[16:51] so he's not hey listen brother branham
[16:54] is not contradicting his teaching
[16:56] he's preaching in an evangelistic way to
[16:58] denominational people
[17:00] and he's preaching in terms that they
[17:02] understand
[17:05] but when he's teaching and breaking down
[17:07] the word
[17:08] amen he is teaching the type he's
[17:10] breaking it down he's teaching
[17:12] amen there's no names being added to the
[17:14] lamb's book of life there's no names
[17:16] being added to the book of life amen
[17:18] there can be a name blotted out of the
[17:19] book of life but no name can be added
[17:22] all the names were added before the
[17:23] foundation of the world so you have to
[17:25] believe the prophet amen
[17:27] and see the big picture by revelation
[17:30] in these statements are not stumbling
[17:33] anymore
[17:35] it's after the seals so maybe there's
[17:37] names being added no he said there's no
[17:39] names being added
[17:41] but then he said how do you know your
[17:42] name might be added oh my goodness it's
[17:45] got to be by revelation
[17:47] you see why it can't be by intellectual
[17:50] because all of a sudden we'll go along
[17:52] and say
[17:52] well i'll look for the last place he
[17:54] references and the last statement he
[17:56] makes
[17:57] as he goes his misery has to be the most
[17:59] correct
[18:02] it's not going to be that way friends
[18:05] amen you're not going to discover him
[18:09] in a quote search you're not going to
[18:12] know the truth
[18:13] in a quote shirt you're going to know it
[18:14] by revelation
[18:19] so we've got to be careful we've got to
[18:21] be careful
[18:23] we don't take somebody else's
[18:24] intellectual idea
[18:26] where they're starting the the the piece
[18:29] together stuff
[18:30] with an intellectual mind and says it
[18:31] says this and says that no it's by
[18:33] revelation
[18:34] amen and the mystery is laying there
[18:37] to be discovered but it's only going to
[18:40] be discovered
[18:41] by one person and that's the bride
[18:45] nobody else is going to discover the
[18:47] mystery they'll hear all the tapes
[18:49] read all the books but unless you're
[18:51] that predestinated elected seed from god
[18:53] you will not get this mystery secret
[18:56] and will not see it you'll still be
[18:59] looking for something to happen that's
[19:00] already happened
[19:03] because we missed it by revelation
[19:05] trying to discern it
[19:08] intellectually
[19:10] hallelujah
[19:13] let's go to matthew chapter one together
[19:16] that was a tangent amen
[19:21] that's why brother branham said above
[19:23] all else pray for revelation
[19:26] not for a bigger brain amen not for a
[19:28] better bible
[19:30] not for a concordance amen don't don't
[19:32] even pray
[19:33] that you can get a message search
[19:36] program because the search program can
[19:39] lead you astray
[19:42] pray above all for revelation
[19:45] it's the most important thing it's the
[19:47] key to the bride overcoming in this day
[19:51] now we'll look at matthew chapter one
[19:53] here we are at the beginning of the new
[19:54] testament
[19:55] we've been through this several times
[19:57] and we're probably going to be through
[19:58] it several more so i'm just going to
[20:00] give you fair warning
[20:01] amen god is good he loves us
[20:05] but starting with verse one the book of
[20:07] the generation of jesus christ the son
[20:09] of david the son of abraham
[20:12] abraham begot isaac and isaac begot
[20:14] jacob and jacob begot judas and his
[20:16] brethren
[20:18] and judas begot pharas and zerah of
[20:20] tamar
[20:21] there's our first women we're going to
[20:22] look at these four women here in the
[20:24] first six verses
[20:25] tamar pharris begat ezram ezram begot
[20:29] aram and abraham begat aminadab and
[20:31] amina dabigan
[20:32] nayasan and nasa begot solomon and
[20:35] solomon got
[20:35] boaz of rahab second woman
[20:39] and boazby got jesse and no no rahab
[20:43] and bosby got jesse i'm sorry and boaz
[20:46] we got obed of ruth third woman
[20:48] and obed begot jesse and jessie begot
[20:50] david the king
[20:51] and david the king begot solomon of her
[20:53] that had been the wife of uriah
[20:55] bathsheba number four so we're going to
[20:58] focus on these number four and we'll see
[21:00] how far we get we may only get as far as
[21:01] tamar tonight
[21:03] but that would be good that's a good
[21:05] start
[21:06] but i want to lay down something as an
[21:08] understanding as we go into this
[21:11] because these are the four women that
[21:12] are mentioned here
[21:14] in the beginning and the first six
[21:16] verses
[21:17] of matthew chapter one of the new
[21:19] testament it's four women
[21:21] and this number four is a number we've
[21:23] looked at but i want to look at it again
[21:25] as we go into this story so that we can
[21:27] recognize our number four
[21:29] brother branham said in in
[21:33] in the restoration of the bride tree
[21:40] i think that's the one i want
[21:44] the restoration of the bride tree
[21:48] no that's not that's the one i want it's
[21:51] the next one i want to come to
[21:52] but this first one i can't remember what
[21:54] it's out of i believe it's in 1961 i cut
[21:56] the top of it off somehow
[21:58] but in 1961 he preaches on the
[22:00] revelation
[22:02] uh revelation chapter four i believe is
[22:04] where we're at here revelation chapter
[22:06] four revelations chapter five in 1961.
[22:08] he says now remember god's guards of the
[22:11] ark are the mercy seat now remember to
[22:13] how many john saw how many
[22:15] four how many did he see he's seen four
[22:18] four living creatures now watch they've
[22:19] both seen the same vision
[22:21] and four is the number of earth did you
[22:23] know that how many knows now before
[22:26] you have to go into it four is an
[22:27] earthly number sure
[22:29] it's an earthly it's a number of earth
[22:31] of deliverance deliverance
[22:32] now keep that in your mind deliverance
[22:34] because i'm going to strike it just a
[22:36] minute real hard
[22:37] see deliverance now there was three
[22:38] hebrew children the fiery furnace but
[22:40] the fourth one came
[22:41] it was deliverance lazarus was in the
[22:43] grave three days but when the fourth one
[22:45] came
[22:45] he was delivered four is god's number of
[22:48] deliverance all right so we got that
[22:50] four is god's number of deliverance and
[22:52] that's why we have
[22:53] four gospels four gospels bring us to
[22:55] the book of acts the book of acts is
[22:56] deliverance
[22:59] amen so he's talking about the four the
[23:02] four cherubims that are around the
[23:03] throne
[23:03] guarding amen the mercy seat there's
[23:05] four of them he refers to the three
[23:07] hebrew
[23:08] children the fiery furnace the fourth
[23:09] one was this was the son of god himself
[23:12] amen christ himself which is the
[23:14] deliverer
[23:16] lazarus in the grave three days the
[23:18] fourth day he was delivered
[23:20] now in the message restoration of the
[23:21] bride tree from 1962
[23:23] he said four killers took it four
[23:25] messengers destroyed it
[23:26] and he's talking about the destruction
[23:28] of the bride tree four messengers of
[23:30] death took it away
[23:31] in dogmas four messengers of
[23:33] righteousness restore her back again
[23:36] prophesy son of man can these bones live
[23:39] wish we had time
[23:40] i got it wrote down here but i have to
[23:42] miss that prophesy
[23:43] can these bones live what's the four
[23:46] stages of the coming forth of that
[23:47] church
[23:48] what's the four stages of ezekiel's dry
[23:50] bones come forth
[23:52] but the life only come not when the
[23:54] senior skin was
[23:55] on them but when the wind blowed upon
[23:57] them that's when
[23:59] came come back that fourth message of
[24:01] life
[24:02] so he takes he takes the dry bones in
[24:04] ezekiel and it's a mighty army and it's
[24:06] laying there as dry bones in the valley
[24:08] amen is sick in these bowen lids he says
[24:10] thou
[24:10] knows he said prophesy so he prophesied
[24:12] and bone came to bone then sin you came
[24:14] upon it and then flesh
[24:16] and they were standing up erect a mighty
[24:18] army but there was no life yet
[24:20] and he said prophesy again when he
[24:22] prophesied again
[24:23] the breath of life came into him and
[24:25] it's the fourth stage that brought life
[24:29] there was these four anointings that we
[24:31] find in
[24:32] in revelation chapter six when he begins
[24:34] to open the seals
[24:35] and the first seal open amen and he
[24:37] heard the voice of the first beast
[24:39] amen and or he heard the the beast say
[24:42] come and see the first beast and there
[24:44] was a lion
[24:45] and so now we're talking the church ages
[24:47] the first four seals
[24:48] cover the church ages the first four
[24:51] creatures
[24:52] cover the anointing over the over the
[24:54] church ages so you have lion oxman and
[24:56] eagle
[24:57] all of the anointings that cover the
[24:58] seven church ages
[25:00] so four anointings cover seven church
[25:03] ages
[25:04] four stages of destruction destroy the
[25:06] bride tree four
[25:07] four stages of restoration bring it back
[25:09] again
[25:11] all right so four is restoration and
[25:14] four is tied
[25:15] to the church ages
[25:18] brother brahm says in the masterpiece
[25:20] notice here the life that was in the
[25:22] husk
[25:22] in the stalk and in the tassel in the
[25:24] husk all gathers in the seed
[25:26] and the life that was in the stalk went
[25:29] one went to make the other
[25:30] justification made a way for
[25:32] sanctification sanctification made a way
[25:34] for the baptism of the holy ghost the
[25:36] baptism of the holy ghost made a way for
[25:38] the holy ghost
[25:40] itself
[25:42] now listen this is the fourth stage so
[25:45] the baptism of holy ghost wasn't the
[25:47] finish
[25:48] that was the husk or that was the shock
[25:52] but the baptism holy ghost made a way
[25:55] for the holy ghost itself to come
[25:58] right down in perfection back to the
[26:00] word
[26:01] again to manifest itself
[26:05] back to the original seed back to the
[26:07] same jesus christ that went in the
[26:09] ground
[26:10] come back out as the grain amen the holy
[26:12] ghost itself
[26:13] back in perfection again the word
[26:16] that's the fourth stage the fourth stage
[26:19] of life amen the fourth stage of
[26:20] restoration
[26:22] so we've got in this number four we've
[26:24] got justification
[26:26] sanctification baptism of holy ghost the
[26:28] holy ghost itself
[26:30] we've got lion ox man and eagle and
[26:33] under the eagle anointing
[26:34] amen is the message of deliverance
[26:38] you have stalk tassel shuck and seed
[26:42] we have luther wesley pentecost in the
[26:45] word
[26:46] and bride so we see the four stages all
[26:48] right
[26:49] so it's really clear to us four is the
[26:51] number of deliverance there's four
[26:52] stages
[26:53] we could go all through the bible and
[26:54] find this four but you you'll have fun
[26:56] doing that you go and do that
[26:58] we're going to just now look at at the
[26:59] story of tamar
[27:01] so if you look at matthew chapter 1
[27:03] verse 3
[27:05] it says and judas begot pharas and zara
[27:08] of tamar
[27:09] now judas
[27:13] judas is the fourth son
[27:16] of israel all right
[27:19] so judas is number four himself
[27:23] so this is gonna show up all through
[27:24] this story this number four
[27:26] this number four of deliverance and then
[27:28] back to seed
[27:29] everything we just talked about we're
[27:31] gonna find in this story because what is
[27:33] god
[27:34] doing he is hiding the mystery
[27:37] in the types he's hiding in the
[27:39] characters
[27:40] slowly letting out but never revealing
[27:42] the whole thing until he gets to the end
[27:44] and then you can look back and say he's
[27:45] there and he's there and he's there and
[27:47] he's there
[27:48] and if we go back let's go back to
[27:50] genesis chapter 38 together
[27:53] genesis chapter 38 we're going to look
[27:55] at the the life of
[27:57] tamar now i've decided
[28:01] i made a decision and my decisions don't
[28:03] always stand when i get in the pulpit
[28:05] but i decided that i'm going to go slow
[28:08] and we're going to do a bible study so
[28:09] keep your bibles open and stay with me
[28:12] and we'll see what happens
[28:15] so if you look chapter 37
[28:18] starts off talking about the life of
[28:20] joseph joseph is favorite of his father
[28:23] joseph and we know joseph is a type of
[28:26] perfection he's a perfect type of christ
[28:29] we know that it's the type of christ in
[28:31] all brother brendon explains in detail
[28:33] all that he's done is typing christ and
[28:35] and here he's the beloved of the father
[28:37] hated of his brethren in verse 37 they
[28:39] hate him they take him they throw him
[28:41] into a pit
[28:42] amen then they they they take him out
[28:44] and they sell him to a band of medians
[28:46] going to egypt then they tear his
[28:48] garment they dip it in goat's blood and
[28:49] show it to his father and
[28:50] father believes that he's dead amen and
[28:53] and so verse 37
[28:54] ends uh chapter 37 verse 36
[28:58] says in the median medianite sold him
[29:01] unto egypt unto potiphar
[29:03] an officer of pharaoh and captain of the
[29:06] guard
[29:07] so now just as soon as joseph a type of
[29:10] christ
[29:11] gets out of the way
[29:14] we inject a chapter here that's
[29:17] different than all the others
[29:18] because if you look at chapter 37 starts
[29:20] talking about joseph
[29:21] skip 38 chapter 39
[29:26] joseph 40 joseph 41
[29:29] joseph 42 joseph 43
[29:32] joseph 44 joseph 45
[29:38] joseph
[29:40] it's the whole story of joseph it's all
[29:42] about joseph
[29:43] but we're going to break into the
[29:45] sequence and tear open something
[29:47] in the life of joseph which is a type of
[29:49] christ and after joseph is rejected of
[29:52] his brethren
[29:52] amen after he's thrown into pit assumed
[29:54] his dead how he's how he's sold out
[29:57] for 20 pieces of silver after that he's
[29:59] off the scene
[30:00] and we're going to tear open the story
[30:02] of joseph amen between his first and
[30:05] second comings and we're going to inject
[30:06] the church ages right
[30:08] here in chapter 38.
[30:11] amen this story repeats and repeats
[30:15] and repeats and repeats and not every
[30:18] type tells the exact same story it's
[30:20] always unfolding another
[30:21] angle amen and more color amen this
[30:24] one's in black and white
[30:25] this one we add a little color this one
[30:27] we have a few different colors
[30:29] and you put them all together and you
[30:30] can find the bride and working our way
[30:32] all the way through the old testament
[30:34] you can find the bridegroom and the
[30:36] bride the type of
[30:37] the male and the female working its way
[30:39] all the way through
[30:40] so here in the life of joseph after he's
[30:43] favored amen
[30:44] after amen he's the covenant son with a
[30:46] coat of many colors the rainbow covenant
[30:49] he's rejected amen he's cast down he's
[30:52] sold out
[30:53] amen and he goes down into egypt and
[30:55] he's gone and he's off the scene
[30:57] and right here we're going to inject a
[31:00] story
[31:00] that doesn't fit with everything else
[31:03] that we're talking about
[31:04] joseph joseph joseph joseph joseph and
[31:06] right here we're going to tear it open
[31:07] inject this and go right back to joseph
[31:10] why because you have in the life of
[31:13] christ
[31:14] they mean you've got to inject the
[31:16] church ages
[31:19] where do the church ages come in in the
[31:21] breach amen when you tear apart the
[31:23] seventh week amen
[31:24] after three and a half years amen in the
[31:27] 70 weeks of daniel
[31:28] amen he's cut off and then the church
[31:30] ages come
[31:31] in amen and then it's going to come back
[31:33] to three and a half years in the
[31:34] tribulation when he's dealing with the
[31:36] jews again
[31:37] so right here you've got to tear it
[31:39] apart and stick to church ages in here
[31:42] so chapter 38 is the church ages
[31:45] right here in the old testament in the
[31:48] story of the life of joseph
[31:51] and i i'm gonna i'm probably gonna jump
[31:54] all over the place
[31:55] you just forgive me but i love you
[31:59] amen so i want to find something here
[32:03] there's an interesting relationship
[32:08] between judah and joseph
[32:14] all right let's look here in first
[32:16] chronicles if you could skip over to
[32:18] first chronos we're coming back to
[32:19] genesis 38 so if you want to save your
[32:21] place there
[32:24] i'll try to do the same thing
[32:27] first chronicles the chronicles of the
[32:31] kings
[32:33] chapter 5.
[32:41] first chronicles chapter 5. now this is
[32:43] a slight diversion but i think it's
[32:44] going to help us
[32:45] understand why we've got joseph and
[32:47] judah right here in the story
[32:50] chronicles chapter 5 verse 1 now the
[32:53] sons of reuben the firstborn of israel
[32:55] for he was the firstborn but for as much
[32:57] as he defiled his father's bed
[32:59] his birthright was given unto the sons
[33:01] of joseph the son of israel
[33:03] and the genealogy is not to be reckoned
[33:05] after the birthright
[33:07] for judah prevailed above his brethren
[33:09] and out of him
[33:11] came the chief ruler but the birthright
[33:13] was joseph's
[33:15] so this becomes really important the
[33:17] firstborn is supposed to get the
[33:18] birthright
[33:19] so reuben was supposed to have the
[33:21] birthright but that didn't go to reuben
[33:24] because reuben defiled his father's bed
[33:26] and the birthright didn't go to the
[33:27] second or the third or the fourth
[33:29] it skips all the way down to the seventh
[33:35] i wonder why the birthright jumps all
[33:37] the way to the seventh
[33:42] it's amazing let's look at that in
[33:44] genesis 49.
[33:49] no no i'm sorry genesis 35. go back to
[33:52] where we were in 38 and go back a couple
[33:54] chapters
[33:55] and look at genesis 35. and look how
[33:58] they order the birth
[33:59] the birth here and we're going to look
[34:00] at genesis 35 23
[34:03] is not ordered in chronological order
[34:07] verse 23 it says the sons of leah reuben
[34:10] jacob's firstborn
[34:11] and simeon and levi and judah see
[34:14] judah's number four
[34:16] number four we already said the chief
[34:19] ruler the governor
[34:21] will come out of judah number four so
[34:24] who's coming out of judah
[34:25] number four is the number of deliverance
[34:27] so the deliverer will come out of number
[34:29] four
[34:30] because it's judah's line is the king
[34:32] line it's judah's line
[34:34] when you read matthew chapter one amen
[34:36] in the reading through it's judah's line
[34:38] that we're reading through coming all
[34:39] the way to christ
[34:40] because the deliverer has to come from
[34:42] number four because number four is the
[34:43] number of deliverance
[34:46] amen simeon and levi and jude and
[34:50] issachar
[34:51] and zebulon now we go to the sons of
[34:54] rachel
[34:55] second wife joseph and benjamin
[34:58] seven and eight isn't that amazing seven
[35:02] and eight
[35:02] you've got amen you've got christ and
[35:05] the bride and benjamin the 144 000
[35:07] properly placed in numerical order
[35:11] and then he goes to the concubines and
[35:14] the sons of bilhah rachel's handmaid dan
[35:16] and naftali
[35:17] and the sons of zilpah leah's handmaid
[35:19] gad and asher
[35:20] these are the sons of jacob which were
[35:22] born to him in padman aram
[35:24] so now we see the way that the bible
[35:26] orders them
[35:27] is perfect the birthright amen jumps
[35:31] from the first born of the first wife
[35:34] to the firstborn of the second wife
[35:39] why is that because the bible brother
[35:42] branham tells us
[35:43] that his goal all along was to have a
[35:45] gentile bride
[35:47] from before the foundation of the world
[35:49] his goal was to have a gentile bride
[35:51] amen
[35:52] and adam had the inheritance to all
[35:54] things and adam lost his inheritance
[35:57] so god comes and chooses abraham who is
[35:59] not
[36:00] a jew amen abraham is from ur of the
[36:03] chaldees
[36:04] he's not jew there's no jew yet amen
[36:06] before there was jew
[36:07] he called abraham and he brought him
[36:09] into the land
[36:10] and what adam lost he promised that
[36:13] abraham's seed is going to inherit it
[36:16] so there's a restoration promise to
[36:19] abraham seed
[36:20] not as a jew not as circumcised
[36:23] but as a non-jew he receives the promise
[36:26] of inheriting all things
[36:28] the thing that adam lost is now promised
[36:30] to abraham's seed
[36:34] not as a jew not a circumcised but it's
[36:37] a
[36:37] gentile promise for a gentile seed for a
[36:40] gentile bride
[36:41] [Applause]
[36:43] and so why does he have to change his
[36:45] name from abram to abraham
[36:48] a-b-r-a-h-a-m seven letters
[36:52] it was six it's got to go to seven why
[36:54] seven church ages gentile bride
[36:56] his name has to move to seven letters to
[36:58] signify the church ages
[37:03] but there's another reason god has to
[37:05] change his name
[37:09] because god has already ordained that
[37:11] there's going to be an end-time gentile
[37:12] prophet
[37:14] and that prophet's name is b-r-a-h-a-m
[37:18] seven letters so abraham's names changed
[37:21] from abram to abraham
[37:22] and brother branham comes at the end to
[37:25] confirm the promise that was given to
[37:27] abraham amen and be there to recognize
[37:31] christ's coming as the redeemer with the
[37:32] title deed in his hand
[37:34] now the promise coming into the hands of
[37:36] the seed of
[37:37] abraham that prophet has the same
[37:40] characters same number of letters
[37:43] b-r-a-h-a-m
[37:48] whatever spell it for me next time seven
[37:52] letters
[37:53] and we think we can check brother benham
[37:55] with the bible and correct him
[38:00] he was ordained from before everything
[38:03] was lining up all the way in the back
[38:06] indicating what it was going to be at
[38:08] the end because god already knew the end
[38:10] from the beginning
[38:11] and god is lining it all up to come to
[38:14] come to pass
[38:18] so now
[38:21] now he always wanted to have a gentile
[38:25] bride
[38:27] and that was his goal is always to have
[38:30] a gentile bride is that what brother
[38:31] brahm told us
[38:33] so now we come to the story of jacob
[38:35] who's going to become israel prince with
[38:37] god
[38:37] and now jacob he wants a gentile bride
[38:42] he wants rachel that's his desire from
[38:47] the beginning
[38:48] is to have rachel right but something
[38:51] happens and his father-in-law tricks him
[38:53] and he finds out that he's married to
[38:55] leah he didn't want leah
[38:57] he wanted rachel amen and god always
[39:00] wanted a gentile bride
[39:02] amen but first he comes to leah the jews
[39:05] but what he wants
[39:06] is rachel the gentile bride
[39:10] so he works his seven days that he's
[39:12] promised he works through the old
[39:13] testament amen
[39:15] and he gets leah the type of the jewish
[39:17] bride and he marries leah and when he
[39:19] when he goes into her and marries her he
[39:21] realizes this isn't the one i
[39:23] wanted i've been tricked amen but he
[39:25] doesn't put her away
[39:26] he holds on to her amen and he says what
[39:29] must i do
[39:30] to get the one that i wanted and he says
[39:32] if you'll promise to work seven more
[39:34] years and he promises right then to work
[39:39] seven more
[39:40] to he promises then to work the seven
[39:42] church ages
[39:43] because now joseph has come between two
[39:46] dispensations of seven
[39:47] now christ has come as the redeemer to
[39:50] die on the cross to pay the price
[39:52] to get leah and rachel at the same time
[39:56] so the at the end of seven years he gets
[39:58] leah and then he promises seven more and
[40:01] he's given rachel and marries her
[40:03] amen so for seven years he's married to
[40:05] rachel but rachel can't have a baby
[40:11] seven years no baby no baby no baby
[40:14] no baby then all of a sudden she
[40:16] conceives and brings forth
[40:18] and lo and behold who comes forth joseph
[40:22] the firstborn from the woman he
[40:26] originally wanted that's why the
[40:28] birthright goes to joseph
[40:30] because it was joseph he wanted to come
[40:33] through rachel
[40:34] it was never supposed to be reuben
[40:36] through leah
[40:37] he wanted a gentile bride and through
[40:40] that gentile bride
[40:41] he would reproduce himself on earth
[40:43] again and that's where the birthright is
[40:45] going to be
[40:47] so reuben had to fall
[40:50] because by the law amen reuben had a
[40:53] right to the birthright
[40:55] but when reuben fell in sin and took his
[40:58] father's concubine
[40:59] now jacob has a right to take that
[41:02] birthright
[41:03] and not assign it to number two number
[41:05] three number four
[41:06] but come down to the firstborn amen of
[41:09] the life he wanted from the beginning
[41:12] and give the give the promise of the
[41:14] birthright and to the firstborn of the
[41:16] chosen bride
[41:20] hallelujah friends
[41:26] this bible is amazing
[41:29] the prophet he doesn't get time to go
[41:31] through and explain
[41:33] every one of these details he said i
[41:35] just hit the high places
[41:36] just enough so that you'll know what it
[41:38] is you take these things and study them
[41:41] out
[41:42] what's he doing he's showing us the
[41:44] pattern he's showing us all of this
[41:46] stuff
[41:46] he doesn't have enough time in his
[41:47] ministry to tell us all of these things
[41:49] amen but he makes statements that he
[41:51] doesn't qualify
[41:52] he makes statements in the birthright
[41:54] and this woman in bringing forth christ
[41:56] and he and he says all of this and he
[41:58] doesn't qualify but if you just believe
[42:00] what he's saying
[42:01] and you go back and look in the bible
[42:03] everything he's saying he's taking right
[42:05] out of here
[42:06] amen and he's pulling out of the types
[42:08] truth that he's just preaching as
[42:10] truth but he's not telling you every
[42:12] time he i got that out of joseph's life
[42:14] and i got that out of jacob's life
[42:16] no he just recognizes true he preaches
[42:18] as it's true and when we go back and we
[42:20] see we say
[42:21] that's where he got that
[42:24] that's where it comes to the seventh
[42:26] that's where it comes to rachel's a
[42:28] seed coming forth from rachel it's all
[42:31] laying right there
[42:34] so the scepter the right to rule
[42:37] went to judah the first born forth
[42:40] because the four is the number of
[42:41] deliverance
[42:43] but the birthright comes to the seventh
[42:46] which happens to be the first of the
[42:48] right woman
[42:52] it's too perfect it's too perfect
[42:56] i hope i'm not losing you with all these
[42:58] numbers take out a pen and paper and
[43:00] just write them down
[43:01] because brother bam said if you miss the
[43:02] numerology of the bible you've missed
[43:04] the bible
[43:06] so hallelujah so we we find out
[43:10] let's look at one more passage of
[43:11] scripture
[43:13] genesis 49 just so we can see this
[43:16] promise to judah
[43:24] genesis 49 and 8
[43:28] judah thou art he whom thy brethren
[43:31] shall praise
[43:32] thy hand shall be in the neck of thine
[43:34] enemies thy father's children shall bow
[43:35] down before thee
[43:36] why because the king is coming out of
[43:38] judah david came out of judah solomon
[43:41] came out of judah christ come out of
[43:42] judah
[43:45] thy children my father's jones shall bow
[43:47] down before thee
[43:48] judah is a lion's welt from the prey
[43:51] from the
[43:52] the prey my son thou art gone up he
[43:54] stooped down he couched
[43:55] as a lion and as an old lion who shall
[43:58] rouse him
[43:58] the scepter the scepter is the rod to
[44:01] rule the scepter
[44:02] shall not depart from judah nor a
[44:05] lawgiver from between his feet until
[44:07] shiloh come
[44:08] and unto him shall the shall the
[44:10] gathering of the people be
[44:12] so this is a prophecy of coming of
[44:13] christ so now the scepter shall not
[44:15] depart
[44:16] from judah so the kingly lines coming
[44:18] through judah christ that's why the
[44:20] genealogy is so careful in matthew
[44:22] chapter 1
[44:23] to show that this is the genealogy of
[44:25] judah and christ is coming
[44:27] but christ is coming in such a unique
[44:29] way
[44:30] that he's he's now collecting these
[44:32] split promises
[44:33] where the right to rule goes to judah
[44:35] and the birthright goes to joseph
[44:37] now when jesus christ comes on the scene
[44:40] they come back together as one
[44:42] the right to rule and the birthright in
[44:44] him
[44:47] and we're joint heirs
[44:52] let's go back real quick to matthew i
[44:54] want to show you something just quickly
[44:58] now we've firmly established judah
[45:02] number four fourth born fourth tribe
[45:05] judah
[45:05] the right to rule the scepter the
[45:07] scepter will be in his hand
[45:09] amen the kingly line number four
[45:11] deliverance
[45:13] number seven the birthright goes to the
[45:14] firstborn of the right woman
[45:16] joseph so joseph and judah and christ is
[45:19] typing both
[45:20] and it comes together in christ so now
[45:23] we see these genealogies coming all the
[45:25] way down through
[45:26] but something funny happens when we get
[45:29] towards the end
[45:31] if we get go back to 16 verse 16
[45:34] matthew 1 verse 16
[45:39] and jacob begot joseph
[45:46] and jacob begot joseph
[45:50] and jacob begot joseph
[45:54] he's tying the two together right now
[45:57] the line of judah and the birthright of
[45:59] joseph is coming together
[46:01] because it's even in the same order
[46:03] jacob begot joseph
[46:06] and now it's going to come through the
[46:09] woman that joseph is betrothed to
[46:11] why these names why not aram and azram
[46:15] and abinadab and all the other names
[46:17] why do we come right back to jacob and
[46:20] joseph again
[46:21] because christ is coming with the right
[46:23] to rule and the birthright
[46:26] every name every punctuation
[46:31] is perfectly placed hallelujah
[46:34] let's go back to genesis 38
[46:38] hallelujah i like this slowing down a
[46:41] little bit stuff
[46:42] these are the things that we just skip
[46:44] right over sunday after sunday after
[46:46] sunday
[46:47] but i don't want to skip over them these
[46:49] nuggets are solid gold
[46:51] amen we're always trying to hit the high
[46:53] places
[46:54] praise the lord we got time it's cold
[46:58] and snowy who wants to go out in the
[46:59] snow anyway let's just stay here
[47:02] and talk about these things hallelujah
[47:07] so now let's look at genesis chapter 38
[47:10] we're going to look at the church ages
[47:11] inserted here in the life of joseph
[47:14] and it came to pass at that time that
[47:16] judah went down from his brethren and
[47:18] turned into a certain edualamite whose
[47:20] name was haira
[47:22] and judah saw there a daughter of a
[47:24] certain canaanite whose name was shua
[47:26] and he took her and went in under her
[47:30] so now judah listen this is very
[47:33] important
[47:35] judah went down from his brethren
[47:40] he didn't stay amen in the camp he
[47:43] didn't stay with his brethren
[47:45] he went down from his brethren and he
[47:48] went
[47:48] when he went down he found a canaanite
[47:51] whose name washua this word yeshua this
[47:54] name means
[47:54] wealth so now he marries the daughter of
[47:58] prosperity the daughter of wealth
[48:00] and now we see the church ages clearly
[48:02] coming through because the beautiful
[48:04] rich
[48:05] church is the false church and he comes
[48:08] through and he marries
[48:09] amen a canaanite a daughter of a canine
[48:12] named yeshua whose name was wealth
[48:14] amen and he took her and went in under
[48:16] her and she conceived and bear a son and
[48:18] called his name
[48:19] er and she conceived again and bear a
[48:21] son and she called his name
[48:23] onan and she yet again conceived and
[48:26] bear a son
[48:27] and she called his name sheila and he
[48:29] was at
[48:30] cesib when she bare him
[48:34] now i'm just going to point out a couple
[48:36] things and we'll get to it
[48:37] here in a little bit but he has one two
[48:40] three
[48:41] sons by this daughter yeshua the
[48:44] daughter of wealth
[48:45] the canaanitis and he has three sons and
[48:48] after when he gets to the third son it
[48:51] says she bear sheila and he was at
[48:53] cesib when she bear him this word cheseb
[48:56] means
[48:56] false now we're going to see
[49:00] that we've gone through justification
[49:02] sanctification baptism the holy ghost
[49:04] we've gone through we've gone through
[49:06] stalk
[49:07] tassel shock and the shock looks like
[49:11] the seed
[49:12] but it's not and here here's sheila
[49:14] comes down
[49:15] and he's born false
[49:19] looks like seed not seed it's just a
[49:23] shock
[49:24] hallelujah i told you the church ages
[49:27] are right here
[49:29] one two three sheila and she was born at
[49:32] false
[49:35] verse six and judah took a wife for ur
[49:38] his firstborn
[49:39] whose name was tamar now there's when
[49:42] tamar is going to slip in she's the
[49:43] first of the four woman
[49:44] women in the genealogy in matthew
[49:47] chapter 1.
[49:48] and so tamar has an interesting meaning
[49:50] to her name and i want to look at this
[49:51] just real quickly
[49:52] amen tamar means palm tree and palm tree
[49:56] has a significance in the bible
[49:58] amen none of this is by mistake and i
[50:00] want to qualify something
[50:01] early on i have no idea what all of this
[50:04] stuff means
[50:06] it just as it reveals as it fits you see
[50:08] it and you just talk about
[50:09] there's a lot more here yet to be
[50:11] discovered amen we're not catching at
[50:13] all
[50:13] first time through i'll tell you that
[50:14] but i bet we circle back around again
[50:16] and catch more
[50:18] so you just read it all read it we'll
[50:20] pray and god will just keep popping
[50:21] things out
[50:23] now i'm going to read some scriptures to
[50:25] you can write them down but for the sake
[50:26] of time it won't all turn
[50:27] but psalms 92 12 says the righteous
[50:30] shall
[50:31] flourish like a palm tree he shall grow
[50:34] like a cedar in lebanon and many times
[50:37] the righteous are
[50:38] typed with the palm tree because the
[50:40] palm tree is a very tall tree
[50:42] and it stands very erect and there's no
[50:44] break no limbs
[50:45] nothing it's straight and it types
[50:47] uprightness and righteousness
[50:49] and it goes all the way up to a crown of
[50:51] palm leaves at the top and has fruit at
[50:53] the top of the tree
[50:54] so it's it's a type of the righteous who
[50:56] are upright
[50:58] amen and not defiled there's no branches
[51:00] there's no breaks it's straight
[51:02] up unbroken so the righteous shall
[51:05] flourish like a palm tree he shall grow
[51:07] like a cedar in lebanon
[51:09] in the song of solomon's chapter 7 verse
[51:12] 6
[51:13] he says how fair and how pleasant are
[51:15] thou o love for delights
[51:17] this thy stature is like to a palm tree
[51:21] so here the bridegroom is describing the
[51:23] bride and he says your stature is like
[51:26] a palm tree in judges chapter 4
[51:31] verse 4 says endebra now now we've come
[51:34] to number four remember we're laboring
[51:36] on number four
[51:37] so now we've come to judges chapter four
[51:42] verse four to deborah the fourth
[51:45] judge of the judges and the fourth judge
[51:49] happens to be
[51:51] a woman hallelujah
[51:54] and deborah prophetess the wife of
[51:56] lapidoth
[51:57] she judged israel at that time verse 5
[52:00] and she dwelt
[52:01] under the palm tree of deborah between
[52:04] rhema and bethel and mount ephraim and
[52:06] the children of israel came up to her
[52:08] for judgment
[52:09] so this is such a famous place it's
[52:11] named after
[52:12] she lives under the palm tree of deborah
[52:16] hallelujah because the righteous shall
[52:18] flourish like a palm tree
[52:20] now when we come to john chapter 12
[52:22] verse 12 we're describing jesus's
[52:24] entry into jerusalem before he's
[52:26] crucified said on the next day much
[52:28] people that were come to the feast
[52:30] when they heard that jesus was come to
[52:31] jerusalem took branches of
[52:33] palm trees and went forth to meet him
[52:36] and cried hosanna
[52:37] blessed is the king of israel that
[52:39] cometh in the name of the lord
[52:41] so you see it's not just by coincidence
[52:43] her name is tamar
[52:44] tamar amen means palm tree and palm tree
[52:48] is is a sign of righteousness or
[52:50] uprightness
[52:51] and we're going to find this in this
[52:52] story as we continue on
[52:55] now let's look at back at verse 6 again
[52:57] in chapter 38.
[53:00] and judah took a wife of ur the
[53:02] firstborn whose name was tamar
[53:04] in ur judah's firstborn was wicked in
[53:06] the sight of the lord
[53:08] and the lord slew him and judah said
[53:11] unto onan go into thy
[53:12] go go unto thy brother's wife and marry
[53:15] her and raise up seed to thy brother
[53:17] and ona knew that the seed should not be
[53:20] his
[53:20] and it came to pass when he went under
[53:22] his brother's wife that he spilled it on
[53:24] the ground
[53:25] lest that he should give seed to his
[53:27] brother and the thing which he did
[53:29] displease the lord
[53:30] wherefore wherefore he slew him
[53:33] also so now the first son
[53:37] now they're married he marries tamar
[53:39] amen but tamar is not going to conceive
[53:42] by this first son because the seed is
[53:44] not coming forth in justification
[53:48] it's not going to come forth in
[53:49] sanctification it won't come forth in
[53:51] the baptism holy ghost
[53:53] but the seed will come in the fourth
[53:55] stage of deliverance
[53:56] and the fourth stage of the plan when it
[53:58] comes from the shuck back to the seed
[54:00] again amen so all three stages
[54:03] there's not going to be any seed
[54:05] although she was receiving her seed it
[54:07] never took
[54:10] remember what we said last time it's a
[54:11] predestinated womb for a predestinated
[54:14] position
[54:14] to bring forth why could the first
[54:16] husband bring forth no children
[54:18] she married amen they were living a
[54:20] married life amen but he was wicked and
[54:22] god took him and so judah said
[54:24] raise up seed to thy brethren amen and
[54:26] now
[54:27] he's told to perform the rights she's
[54:30] got a right amen
[54:31] because now she's the wife of the
[54:33] firstborn now the firstborn seeds got to
[54:36] come through this woman
[54:39] because onan is not to raise up seed for
[54:42] himself he used to go into tamar to
[54:44] raise up seed for his
[54:45] brother and onan is so
[54:49] wicked that he doesn't care about the
[54:51] birthright of judah he doesn't care
[54:53] about the leanings of christ
[54:54] he only cares about himself amen and he
[54:57] refused to give seed
[54:58] because it would mar his own birthright
[55:01] amen he wouldn't get the seed he would
[55:04] lose the inheritance now that earth's
[55:05] off the scene
[55:06] onan is the one who can inherit
[55:09] everything
[55:12] do you see where the devil is standing
[55:14] here in onan amen
[55:16] amen onan i mean the devil got adam off
[55:18] the scene
[55:19] he got adam the fall now the title deed
[55:21] of redemption has been lost
[55:22] and going up to the hands of the
[55:24] original giver and now
[55:26] onan comes on the scene to sit as a
[55:28] squatter
[55:29] and take possession of all the earth
[55:32] do you think that he wants her to
[55:35] conceive
[55:35] by the right seed line and bring forth
[55:38] christ absolutely not
[55:39] he doesn't want that to happen he's been
[55:41] working overtime to block that
[55:43] conception from happening
[55:44] and onan is called wicked because he
[55:47] wants to keep
[55:48] the birth right he wants to keep the
[55:50] inheritance but he's told
[55:52] by his father amen to bring seed for thy
[55:55] brother
[55:57] and he knew it wouldn't be his seed
[56:00] and so he refused in his wickedness
[56:04] he was wicked onan
[56:08] is just like amen the devil
[56:14] keeping the children of god from their
[56:17] promises
[56:18] keeping them from the revelation because
[56:20] if they get the revelation
[56:21] amen they're going to come to the right
[56:23] source receive the right seed
[56:24] and they're going to bring forth the
[56:26] firstborn and he's going to lose his
[56:28] inheritance if we take this and follow
[56:31] it all the way over in book of ruth
[56:32] in the book of ruth amen ruth comes back
[56:35] and she lays at boaz's feet
[56:36] and says die as a near kinsman
[56:40] and he says i am a near kinsman but
[56:42] there's a kinsman nearer
[56:44] than i and brother branham said that's
[56:47] the devil because of hybridization in
[56:50] the garden because of sin
[56:52] amen we come belonging to the devil
[56:54] first in this hybrid flesh
[56:55] amen and he was the one amen so when we
[56:58] go to the the bow as boaz comes in the
[57:00] city gate and he begins talking to the
[57:02] nearer kinsmen he says
[57:03] he says now amen nomi naomi's come back
[57:06] her inheritance is available you can
[57:09] have all the land
[57:10] you can have the earth you can have it
[57:11] all and he says i'll take it
[57:13] deal he says but
[57:17] you have to take ruth the moabite as his
[57:20] wife
[57:21] to raise up seed for the dead
[57:27] that seed is the one that was going to
[57:30] inherit it all
[57:31] right all that naomi had lost all the
[57:34] inheritance that was gone
[57:36] when you come in to ruth amen who ruth
[57:39] amen was the wife of the son amen and
[57:42] before she conceived she died
[57:44] and now a near kinsman will come give
[57:46] her the seed from the right line
[57:48] amen and that firstborn is going to be
[57:50] the one inheritance so now the nearer
[57:52] kinsmen which is a type of the devil
[57:54] the nearer kingdom says i cannot redeem
[57:59] brother branham says because he's not
[58:01] clean he's defiled because you have to
[58:03] be clean in order to redeem
[58:04] i cannot redeem but now the one that's
[58:07] near in the book of roots says i cannot
[58:09] redeem
[58:10] lest i mar satan's eden
[58:14] unless i mar mine inheritance
[58:18] how did he inherit it he caused sin
[58:21] in the garden of eden and man lost his
[58:23] right
[58:24] and now the devil steps in and he
[58:26] possesses
[58:27] not because he have rights of not
[58:29] because he has rights from the title
[58:31] deed
[58:31] but he has rights in the absence of the
[58:34] title deed
[58:36] and he sits as a squatter because nobody
[58:38] can make claims on it
[58:42] and if he will help get the bride
[58:46] to the full revelation of the full word
[58:48] where she reproduces a son
[58:50] he loses his satan's eden
[58:56] there's only been one story in the bible
[58:58] this bible is only telling one story
[59:02] he cannot do the work of redemption one
[59:06] he can't because he's defiled two he
[59:08] wouldn't do it anyways
[59:10] because if he does it he loses his right
[59:13] to satan's eden
[59:14] because this whole earth is coming back
[59:16] to the seed of abraham
[59:18] amen that's the promise
[59:22] so here onan because he knew it wouldn't
[59:24] be his because he would lose his
[59:26] inheritance because he could no longer
[59:27] has firstborn rights
[59:29] now he refuses to give seed
[59:33] and god kills him
[59:36] hallelujah i don't know about you but i
[59:40] love the word
[59:43] all right let's keep going
[59:53] verse 10 and the thing which he did
[59:54] displease the lord wherefore he slew him
[59:57] also
[59:58] then said judah to tamora his
[1:00:00] daughter-in-law remain a widow at thy
[1:00:02] father's house
[1:00:03] till sheila my son be groaned for he
[1:00:06] said
[1:00:06] lest per adventure he die also
[1:00:10] as his brethren did and tamar went and
[1:00:12] dwelt in her father's house and in
[1:00:14] process of time the daughter of
[1:00:16] yeshua judah's wife died and judah was
[1:00:19] comforted and went up into his
[1:00:20] sheepshears to timnah
[1:00:22] he and his friend hira the adulamite
[1:00:25] now here she's supposed to get the third
[1:00:30] son
[1:00:31] to come to the third stage of redemption
[1:00:34] but she's told
[1:00:35] to wait to go back to her father's house
[1:00:38] until sheila yeah sheila is grown
[1:00:41] and so now she goes back to his father's
[1:00:43] house but sheila is grown now and not
[1:00:45] given to tamar
[1:00:48] why because you don't get the seed in
[1:00:51] the third stage
[1:00:52] you get the seed in the fourth stage
[1:00:57] so now now tamar goes back
[1:01:01] and now judah's wife dies
[1:01:06] so with judah's wife dead
[1:01:10] where will the fourth husband come from
[1:01:15] where she can't get it in the third
[1:01:17] stage three sons
[1:01:19] where is she going to get the seed where
[1:01:21] is the fourth son
[1:01:22] at let's just keep reading
[1:01:26] verse 13 and it was told tamar saying
[1:01:29] behold thy father-in-law go with up to
[1:01:31] timnah to shear a sheep
[1:01:32] and she put her widow's garments off
[1:01:34] from her and he covered her with a veil
[1:01:36] and wrapped herself and sat in an open
[1:01:38] place
[1:01:39] which is by the way to timnath for she
[1:01:41] saw that sheila was grown
[1:01:42] and she was not given unto him to wife
[1:01:46] when judah saw her he thought her to be
[1:01:47] a harlot because she had covered her
[1:01:49] face
[1:01:50] and he turned into her by the way and
[1:01:52] said go to i pray thee let me now come
[1:01:54] in unto thee
[1:01:55] for he knew not that she was his
[1:01:56] daughter-in-law and she said what will
[1:01:58] thou give me
[1:01:59] that thou mayest come in unto me and he
[1:02:01] said i will send thee a kid from the
[1:02:03] flock
[1:02:04] and she said wilt thou give me a pledge
[1:02:06] till thou send it
[1:02:07] and he said what pledge shall i give
[1:02:09] thee and she said thy signet and thy
[1:02:11] bracelets and thy staff
[1:02:13] that is in thine hand and he gave it her
[1:02:16] and came in under her and she conceived
[1:02:18] by him and she arose and went away and
[1:02:21] laid by her veil from her
[1:02:22] and put on the garments of her widowhood
[1:02:25] and judah sent
[1:02:26] the kid by the hand of his friend the
[1:02:27] edualamite to receive his pledge from
[1:02:30] the woman's hand
[1:02:31] but he found her not then he asked the
[1:02:33] men of that place saying where is the
[1:02:35] harlot that was openly by the wayside
[1:02:37] and they said there was no harlot in
[1:02:39] this place and he returned to judah
[1:02:41] and said i cannot find her and also the
[1:02:43] men of the place said that there was no
[1:02:45] harlot
[1:02:45] in this place because she wasn't a
[1:02:49] harlot
[1:02:50] [Applause]
[1:02:52] there's no harlan in this place because
[1:02:54] she's not a harlot
[1:02:56] she has a right to the original seed
[1:03:00] she has a right to bring forth the
[1:03:02] firstborn
[1:03:03] she has redemption rights and her rights
[1:03:06] are being denied her
[1:03:08] and you come to the third stage and in
[1:03:10] the third stage there's no seed given to
[1:03:12] her
[1:03:12] amen so she's got to go beyond the third
[1:03:14] stage and come to the fourth stage and
[1:03:16] when she goes to the fourth stage
[1:03:18] it's not another son amen it's back to
[1:03:21] the original seed giver
[1:03:23] in the beginning it's back to the father
[1:03:28] not er not onan not sheila but when she
[1:03:31] comes to the fourth stage
[1:03:33] it's the original seed amen not another
[1:03:36] son
[1:03:37] not a second-hand experience but back to
[1:03:39] the original seed again
[1:03:44] she asks what were you giving me what
[1:03:46] pledge
[1:03:47] says what do you want she didn't
[1:03:49] hesitate she didn't ask you know
[1:03:51] new car or a new dress she wanted three
[1:03:54] things
[1:03:55] a signet ring his seal
[1:03:59] she wanted his seal his binding cord
[1:04:05] and his staff now i'm not going to
[1:04:08] pretend to know what all that means
[1:04:09] but i know it means a lot but i'll just
[1:04:12] share with you my revelation and what i
[1:04:14] see
[1:04:15] amen so she asks for three things
[1:04:19] the signet ring the binding cord
[1:04:22] and the staff the signet ring is judah's
[1:04:26] seal
[1:04:30] it's a symbol of his person
[1:04:34] because only that seal in his person
[1:04:37] could seal
[1:04:40] and only by his stipulations according
[1:04:42] to how he sealed it could the seal be
[1:04:44] broken
[1:04:46] so the seal represents his person
[1:04:51] so what's she asking for the seventh
[1:04:53] seal
[1:04:55] she's asking for the person the seal
[1:04:59] of christ the binding chord which i'm
[1:05:03] not sure what it represents it's a chord
[1:05:05] the definition is an accord or a twisted
[1:05:07] cord
[1:05:08] many people believe that it's different
[1:05:10] kinds of binding some some say a head
[1:05:12] wrap
[1:05:12] some say a binding that binds the signet
[1:05:14] ring to the rod or
[1:05:16] or ties the signet ring around the neck
[1:05:17] i don't really know i didn't see where
[1:05:19] brother ben said anything
[1:05:20] but but she asked for three things and
[1:05:23] then the third
[1:05:24] is a rod now i want to look at this rod
[1:05:26] for just a second
[1:05:30] she asked for the seal for the binding
[1:05:32] cord
[1:05:33] and for the staff and this staff the
[1:05:36] definition is a staff
[1:05:38] a branch or a tribe
[1:05:41] a branch of a wine or a tribe or the
[1:05:44] chief
[1:05:45] of a tribe
[1:05:48] to understand the significance of the
[1:05:50] rod we've got to go back to numbers
[1:05:52] chapter 17.
[1:05:54] because in number chapter 17 there's a
[1:05:56] dispute
[1:05:57] over moses's choice for his brother's
[1:06:00] family to be the priests
[1:06:03] remember that they started saying now
[1:06:05] how can aaron be the priest we're
[1:06:07] levites also
[1:06:08] amen and god told him to choose aaron
[1:06:10] and his sons
[1:06:11] but now there's a dispute and in the
[1:06:13] dispute
[1:06:14] god says bring 12 rods all the princes
[1:06:17] of the 12
[1:06:18] tribes bring their rod each rod
[1:06:20] represented a tribe
[1:06:22] representing a family and they each
[1:06:23] brought the rod and they took it into
[1:06:25] the sanctuary and laid it before the
[1:06:26] lord
[1:06:27] and he said the rod that buzz and blooms
[1:06:30] is the rod that i have chosen so they
[1:06:32] all inscribe their name on the rod
[1:06:33] they lay them in there moses comes in
[1:06:36] later amen and he pulls them out and
[1:06:38] they're all dead sticks
[1:06:39] but but aarons and aaron's has bloomed
[1:06:42] butted and bearing almonds it's already
[1:06:44] bearing fruit
[1:06:46] [Music]
[1:06:47] it's the one with life in it amen so
[1:06:50] this rod
[1:06:51] represents a tribe or a family
[1:06:55] and so now what does tamar ask for tamar
[1:06:57] now is holding in her hand
[1:06:59] she is holding in their hand the seal of
[1:07:02] judah
[1:07:03] amen she's holding the seal of judah
[1:07:08] she's holding the binding cord and she's
[1:07:11] holding
[1:07:11] the whole family in her hand
[1:07:14] because what is in her womb is the
[1:07:17] firstborn of judah
[1:07:19] with the firstborn rights and she's
[1:07:21] holding here's a woman
[1:07:23] holding amen the seal and the whole
[1:07:26] family without her
[1:07:31] this family can die without her the
[1:07:34] lineage of christ is marred
[1:07:36] she is not amen she is not just wanting
[1:07:39] a baby amen
[1:07:40] she is not just wanting a relationship
[1:07:42] she is not wanting a husband
[1:07:43] but there's something that she may not
[1:07:45] understand that's moving her
[1:07:46] because she is bringing forth christ and
[1:07:50] it's a motivation that's beyond her
[1:07:51] reasoning
[1:07:52] it's a motivation that's beyond amen her
[1:07:55] thoughts of being prudent her thoughts
[1:07:57] of being moral amen her thoughts of
[1:07:59] being correct but it would move her to
[1:08:01] do
[1:08:01] drastic things that she probably never
[1:08:03] thought she would ever do in her life
[1:08:05] amen but there was something moving her
[1:08:07] to bring forth the firstborn of judah
[1:08:10] because she was the wife of the
[1:08:12] firstborn
[1:08:12] and the seed's been refused been refused
[1:08:15] all through the church ages
[1:08:16] has been refused and in the third stage
[1:08:19] the holy ghost
[1:08:20] it didn't have the seed it was just a
[1:08:22] shock and it was refused to hurt too
[1:08:24] so what does she do she goes back in the
[1:08:26] four stage of redemption
[1:08:28] back to the original life giver back to
[1:08:31] the original scene
[1:08:32] and what's her motivation she must bring
[1:08:35] forth christ she doesn't want money
[1:08:39] she doesn't want a kid she wants the
[1:08:41] seal of judah and she wants the family
[1:08:43] birth rights
[1:08:47] hallelujah we don't want money amen we
[1:08:49] don't want prestige we don't want
[1:08:50] buildings
[1:08:51] we don't want money on this earth we
[1:08:52] don't want houses we don't want fame
[1:08:54] all we want is to bring forth christ
[1:08:58] that's why that seal means everything to
[1:09:00] us is the seventh seal open
[1:09:02] yes i'm holding it in my hand
[1:09:05] the rod of christ the family of christ
[1:09:08] it's in me
[1:09:08] amen i've received the seed in the four
[1:09:11] states from the original seed giver
[1:09:13] and i'm holding in the bride she's
[1:09:15] holding the rod
[1:09:16] amen she's holding the seal and the
[1:09:18] binding cord
[1:09:20] [Applause]
[1:09:22] it's not about a relationship it's not
[1:09:24] about a money it's not about a baby
[1:09:28] it's about the church ages it's about
[1:09:31] you and i
[1:09:33] in genesis chapter 38.
[1:09:37] we've done things we've never thought we
[1:09:38] would do
[1:09:40] to get this seal in this rod
[1:09:44] we've left jobs we've separated from
[1:09:47] family members
[1:09:49] we've left churches and friends and
[1:09:51] family
[1:09:52] we've done things we never imagined we
[1:09:54] would do
[1:09:56] so that we could get the right seed and
[1:09:59] the right time
[1:10:00] from the right source and we could get
[1:10:03] the tokens
[1:10:06] that prove who the seed giver is
[1:10:10] let's read just a little bit further
[1:10:13] let's go to verse 24
[1:10:20] and it came to pass about three months
[1:10:23] after that it was told judah saying
[1:10:25] tamar thy daughter-in-law
[1:10:27] hath played the harlot and also behold
[1:10:29] she is with child by whoredom
[1:10:32] and judah said bring her forth and let
[1:10:33] her be burnt
[1:10:38] the end of the church ages after four
[1:10:40] stages we find out
[1:10:42] that this little bride is pregnant
[1:10:47] and she's accused of whoredom following
[1:10:50] a false prophet believing false doctrine
[1:10:52] believing doctrines of devils she's been
[1:10:54] accused of whoredom
[1:10:58] but she's not a harlot she's not a
[1:11:01] amen but she's been accused of it by
[1:11:05] everybody else and all the other
[1:11:06] churches and family members
[1:11:07] and saying you believe things that are
[1:11:09] false and that's that's not right
[1:11:12] she's being accused of being a harlot
[1:11:15] but she's no harlot
[1:11:17] and judah said bring her forth and let
[1:11:18] her be burned
[1:11:20] when she was brought forth she sent to
[1:11:22] her father-in-law saying
[1:11:23] by the man whose these are
[1:11:27] i am with child and she said discern i
[1:11:30] pray thee whose are these
[1:11:32] the signet the braces the binding cord
[1:11:35] and the staff
[1:11:40] and judah acknowledged him and said she
[1:11:43] hath been
[1:11:44] more righteous than
[1:11:47] i because that i gave her not to sheila
[1:11:51] my son and he knew her again no more
[1:11:55] she comes down to the end accused of
[1:11:58] being a harlot amen
[1:12:00] accused of harajuku but she's pregnant
[1:12:01] she can't hide that she's pregnant
[1:12:04] hey then it's telling on her there's a
[1:12:06] seed inside of her
[1:12:08] there's a life growing inside of her and
[1:12:09] she can't hide it anymore but she's
[1:12:11] accused that it's a harlot i mean it's a
[1:12:14] false thing it's something that's wrong
[1:12:15] it's devils that are working in you it's
[1:12:17] all wrong you've been a harlot amen so
[1:12:19] she comes back
[1:12:20] before the chief of the tribe amen and
[1:12:23] she says
[1:12:24] whoever these items belong to is the man
[1:12:27] whose baby i am carrying
[1:12:29] and she shows them the seal and the
[1:12:31] binding cord
[1:12:32] and the rod
[1:12:37] and judah says she's got it
[1:12:40] she's got the seven seal she's got the
[1:12:42] binding cord
[1:12:43] and she's got the right family line
[1:12:46] she's a palm tree she's more
[1:12:50] righteous than i she is upright
[1:12:53] and holy and perfect her little act was
[1:12:56] an act of holiness
[1:12:58] it was an act of righteousness because
[1:13:01] she was motivated by a godly desire
[1:13:05] let's keep going
[1:13:09] he knew her again no more and it came to
[1:13:12] pass in the time of her travail that
[1:13:14] behold
[1:13:15] twins were in her womb huh imagine that
[1:13:19] she's going to bring four twins i wonder
[1:13:21] if that's ever happened before
[1:13:25] twins were in a room and it came to pass
[1:13:27] when she travailed that one
[1:13:28] put out his hand and the midwife took
[1:13:31] and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread
[1:13:33] saying
[1:13:34] this came out first
[1:13:37] so you have one that breaks forth first
[1:13:39] amen but his hand comes out
[1:13:41] she wraps a cord or scarlet cord amen
[1:13:43] and his hands withdrawn
[1:13:46] and it came to pass as he drew back his
[1:13:48] hand that behold his brother came out
[1:13:52] and she said how hast thou broken forth
[1:13:55] this breach be upon me
[1:13:56] therefore his name was called ferez and
[1:13:59] afterward came out his brother that had
[1:14:01] the scarlet thread upon his hand
[1:14:02] and his name was called zara
[1:14:06] why because the types have to stay true
[1:14:08] amen
[1:14:09] it wasn't the first one that looked like
[1:14:11] it was going to come forth
[1:14:12] but it's the second one it wasn't esau
[1:14:15] it was jacob it's not
[1:14:16] cain but it's a boy amen so he sticks it
[1:14:19] out
[1:14:20] sticks out his hand writes the court on
[1:14:21] it he's the one who's supposed to come
[1:14:23] forth but no
[1:14:24] fair as is predestinated there's a
[1:14:26] wrestling going on
[1:14:28] inside and as soon as the way is cleared
[1:14:30] as soon as his hand comes back in
[1:14:32] boom he bursts forth and he says how is
[1:14:34] this bursting forth and your name shall
[1:14:36] be fairest
[1:14:37] which means breach
[1:14:40] breach a breaking forth or a coming
[1:14:43] forth
[1:14:46] so tamar in the fourth stage of
[1:14:50] redemption
[1:14:52] brings forth from the original seed
[1:14:56] one that will burst forth out of the
[1:14:58] breach
[1:15:02] to come and reveal the rights of the
[1:15:08] firstborn
[1:15:10] the seven church ages laying in chapter
[1:15:13] 38 of genesis
[1:15:16] and the life of joseph friends it's more
[1:15:19] than a coincidence
[1:15:22] fair pharas now becomes which son
[1:15:27] number four he becomes the fourth son
[1:15:31] and in him is the lineage of christ and
[1:15:33] when you read down
[1:15:34] it's fair as you begot ezra ezram ezram
[1:15:37] abinadab all the way down through
[1:15:40] and here everything that brother rams
[1:15:43] told us and all the time
[1:15:44] we see it break forth right here in
[1:15:46] genesis
[1:15:49] i tell your friends it's amazing
[1:15:55] then when we're done when we're done
[1:15:58] here in 38
[1:16:00] we go back to 39 and
[1:16:03] joseph was brought down to egypt
[1:16:07] it's injected in the breach it's in the
[1:16:10] gap
[1:16:11] in the 70th week it's all right here
[1:16:16] then you go 39 then you go 40
[1:16:19] 41. you come over to chapter 41 and
[1:16:23] verse 45.
[1:16:25] it says in pharaoh called joseph's name
[1:16:30] zaphnath pioneer
[1:16:34] and he gave to him the wife asanath the
[1:16:36] daughter of
[1:16:37] potiphara priest of ahn
[1:16:42] you go right back from judah right back
[1:16:44] to joseph
[1:16:46] and joseph works his way through the pit
[1:16:48] through he works his way through
[1:16:50] uh the prison house and he comes to the
[1:16:52] right hand of pharaoh
[1:16:53] and pharaoh changes his name and calls
[1:16:56] him
[1:16:56] zaphnath payne and that name means
[1:17:00] the revealer of secret things
[1:17:04] that's the reference in my school-filled
[1:17:05] bible the revealer of secret things
[1:17:09] and when he changed his name to the
[1:17:11] revealer of secret things
[1:17:14] as the revealer of secret things he's
[1:17:15] given a gentile bride
[1:17:19] who did we marry the revealer of secret
[1:17:22] things
[1:17:24] who revealed these mysteries who did we
[1:17:26] get it from amen
[1:17:27] brother branham was just the mouthpiece
[1:17:29] amen it was christ who brought forth
[1:17:31] these mysteries
[1:17:32] it was joseph who brought forth these
[1:17:34] mysteries amen and when we knew him as
[1:17:36] the revealer of secret things
[1:17:38] then he was given a gentile bride
