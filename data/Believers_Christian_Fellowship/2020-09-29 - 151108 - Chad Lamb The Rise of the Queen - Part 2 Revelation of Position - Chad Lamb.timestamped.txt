[1:26] to saint john chapter 16.
[1:29] this morning i'd like to finish what we

[1:38] the queen part 2
[1:40] revelation of position amen so we find
[1:43] ourselves
[1:44] in the book of esther how many found
[1:46] themselves in the book of esther last
[1:47] time
[1:48] and then we're going to find ourselves
[1:49] in the book of esther again while you're
[1:51] turning there i just want to remind
[1:53] everybody that
[1:54] this coming saturday and sunday we have
[1:56] special meetings with brother
[1:58] abraham myra from uganda and the
[2:00] brothers and i got to meet brother
[2:02] abraham when he was down at the men's
[2:03] meeting and
[2:04] we had a really good time he got to
[2:05] speak there briefly and he's got a
[2:08] neat ministry he has an office he holds
[2:10] the office of a prophet he has a
[2:11] prophetic ministry in his life and it's
[2:13] been confirmed
[2:14] amen and so we're excited to have him
[2:16] here to minister for us
[2:17] he'll be ministering saturday night
[2:19] sunday morning and we're going to invite
[2:21] him back in the afternoon for whoever
[2:22] can make it
[2:23] and let him share his testimony so that
[2:25] one can go a little lengthy be one let
[2:27] everybody know
[2:28] he's got a testimony that is out of this
[2:30] world it is the book of acts
[2:32] in our day amen so we want to make that
[2:35] available to you all
[2:36] so just remember that there's been
[2:38] announcements for it
[2:40] also remind everybody that there is
[2:41] communion today
[2:43] so i'll be announcing that at the end of
[2:45] service let's look in saint john chapter
[2:48] 16.
[2:50] starting at verse 19.
[2:55] now jesus knew that they were desirous
[2:57] to ask him and said unto them
[2:59] do ye inquire among yourselves of that i
[3:01] said a little while
[3:02] and you shall not see me and again a
[3:05] little while
[3:06] and you shall see me verily verily i say
[3:08] unto you that ye shall weep and lay men
[3:10] but the world shall rejoice
[3:12] and you shall be sorrowful but your
[3:14] sorrow shall be turned into joy
[3:17] a woman when she is in travail has
[3:18] sorrow because her hour has come
[3:20] but as soon as she is delivered of the
[3:22] child she remembers no more the anguish
[3:24] for joy that a man is born into the
[3:26] world and you know therefore having
[3:28] sorrow
[3:29] and you now therefore having sorrow but
[3:31] i will see you
[3:32] again and your heart shall rejoice and
[3:35] your joy
[3:36] no man taketh from you so here we see
[3:39] that
[3:39] when jesus is telling them that he must
[3:41] go from them and now they're sorrowful
[3:43] but he says you shall sorrow and the
[3:45] world shall rejoice
[3:47] why when christ is put down the world
[3:49] rejoices because they're under the power
[3:51] of the prince of the power of the air
[3:53] and but he says but your sorrow shall be
[3:55] turned into joy
[3:57] for i go away i'll be gone a little
[3:59] while you'll see me know more but in a
[4:01] little while you'll see me again
[4:03] amen and he repeated the same thing in
[4:05] our day through the church ages
[4:06] he was put down and put down and put
[4:08] down but there's been a restoration back
[4:11] amen and he's come again and our sorrow
[4:13] has been turned into joy
[4:15] why because christ the king is here
[4:18] that's why our sorrows been turned into
[4:20] joy
[4:21] so this very much applies to us today
[4:22] let's keep reading
[4:25] we read verse 23 and in that day
[4:29] and in what day the day when your sorrow
[4:31] is turned into joy
[4:33] that's today for us that's this day
[4:36] because he was gone in a little while we
[4:38] saw him no more
[4:39] but we have seen him again the king has
[4:42] come
[4:42] and that day he shall ask sorry in verse
[4:45] 23 yeah and that day
[4:47] this day you ask shall ask me nothing
[4:49] verily verily i say unto you whosoever
[4:52] whatsoever you shall ask the father in
[4:54] my name he will give it you
[4:56] hitherto have you asked nothing in my
[4:58] name ask and you shall receive that your
[5:01] joy may be full
[5:02] these things have i spoken unto you in
[5:04] proverbs but the time cometh
[5:06] when i shall no more speak unto you in
[5:08] proverbs amen
[5:11] we're in that day no more proverbs is
[5:13] the full unveiling of the word no more
[5:15] hidden manna but the bread of life has
[5:16] come down from god out of heaven
[5:18] and we have beheld him amen but i shall
[5:22] show you plainly of the father
[5:24] at that day what day the day when he's
[5:27] not speaking proverbs anymore in the day
[5:29] when he's returned
[5:30] in the day when we see him and in the
[5:31] day when he speaks plainly of the father
[5:34] that's this day at that day you shall
[5:38] ask in my name and i say
[5:39] not unto you that i will pray the father
[5:42] for you
[5:42] for the father himself loveth you
[5:45] because you have loved me
[5:46] and have believed that i come out from
[5:48] god
[5:49] i come forth from the father and them
[5:51] come unto the world again
[5:53] i leave the world and go unto the father
[5:56] amen let's pray
[5:58] dear heavenly father we thank you so
[5:59] much for the reading of this word
[6:01] lord we ask that it would be more than
[6:03] just reading of the word but lord that
[6:05] you would
[6:05] be the divine interpreter of your word
[6:07] this morning lord
[6:08] we're looking to you to come and just to
[6:11] move on the scene lord and move me out
[6:12] of the way and
[6:13] i pray that you would take over these
[6:15] lips lord i yield myself unto you and i
[6:17] pray that your holy spirit would speak
[6:19] this morning to your people
[6:20] that we all can receive what we have
[6:22] need of this morning from you
[6:24] we glorify your name we yield ourselves
[6:26] to your word
[6:27] in jesus name we pray amen
[6:30] you can all be seated i just wanted to
[6:33] say
[6:34] friday night we had a youth meeting out
[6:36] of our house and a bonfire and
[6:37] i'd asked several of the a few of the
[6:40] youth to give a testimony
[6:41] of just what the lord had been doing
[6:43] recently in their lives and a few other
[6:45] picked up the
[6:46] inspiration and they gave some
[6:48] testimonies and i just want to say we
[6:50] have a wonderful youth group here in
[6:51] this church
[6:52] we are very blessed we have some young
[6:55] people who are committed to the lord and
[6:56] god is working mightily in their lives
[6:59] and i just sat there and i was so proud
[7:01] to be associated
[7:02] with these young people these young
[7:04] adults and these teens because they've
[7:06] got a hold of something that most of the
[7:07] world doesn't know anything about
[7:09] they're not ashamed of it they're not
[7:11] ashamed to talk about it they're not
[7:12] ashamed to talk about the word they're
[7:14] not shamed to say we don't believe in
[7:15] denomination they're not ashamed to use
[7:16] the name
[7:17] mention the name william branham in
[7:18] conversations they're not ashamed
[7:20] of the gospel and because of that the
[7:23] gospel is working mightily in their
[7:25] lives and they're overcoming
[7:26] and so i just want to say i'm very proud
[7:28] of them and you as parents should be
[7:30] very proud of them too
[7:31] god has done a work in our young people
[7:33] amen
[7:34] get back here to our subject the rise of
[7:36] the queen we're going to go to esther
[7:38] but i wanted to start hearing john
[7:40] because there was a promise that jesus
[7:42] was giving to his disciples and he says
[7:44] you won't see me a little while you'll
[7:46] see me then you'll see me again your joy
[7:47] will be full
[7:48] and then i'm not going to speak to you
[7:49] in proverbs anymore but there's coming a
[7:51] day when i'm going to speak plainly to
[7:52] you
[7:53] and i and i say we're in that day this
[7:55] is that day
[7:56] and he says in that day amen you just
[7:59] ask directly to the father in my name
[8:01] and he'll give it to you
[8:02] and i'm not telling you that i'll pray
[8:03] to the father
[8:05] amen but you ask yourself and he'll give
[8:09] to you because he loveth you amen
[8:11] why because the bride and the groom have
[8:12] become one
[8:14] amen i just want to remind you before we
[8:18] get into esther of this
[8:19] quote that we've been talking about
[8:21] quite a bit lately and christ is the
[8:22] mystery of god revealed
[8:24] he's talking about the seventh seal in
[8:25] this and i just want to bring it to your
[8:27] attention again
[8:29] he said god's great mystery of how it's
[8:31] a secret he kept it a secret
[8:33] nobody knows nothing about it even the
[8:35] angels didn't understand it see
[8:36] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[8:39] under our seventh
[8:40] mystery when the seventh seal was opened
[8:42] there was silence
[8:43] jesus when he was on earth they wanted
[8:45] to know when he would come
[8:46] he said it's not even the son himself
[8:48] don't know when it's going to happen
[8:50] see god has this all to himself it's a
[8:52] secret and that's the reason there was
[8:55] silence in heaven for the space of half
[8:56] an hour
[8:57] and the seven thunders uttered their
[8:58] voices and john was even forbidden to
[9:00] write it see
[9:01] the coming of the lord the seventh seal
[9:05] is the coming
[9:06] of the lord that's one thing he hasn't
[9:08] revealed yet of how he will come and
[9:10] when he will come
[9:11] it's a good thing that he doesn't know
[9:14] he has showed or revealed it in
[9:16] every type that's in the bible what is
[9:19] he showed or revealed
[9:20] the seventh seal his coming he showed or
[9:24] revealed it in every type that's in the
[9:25] bible
[9:26] not that we understand it in every type
[9:28] that's in the bible but we know it's
[9:29] there
[9:30] and by believing it's there he's
[9:32] revealing it more and
[9:33] more and more amen as the negative moves
[9:36] into the positive we're beginning to see
[9:38] what's been laying there for thousands
[9:39] of years is the picture of redemption
[9:42] that is the mystery of god the mystery
[9:44] of god is the mystery of redemption
[9:46] how he's going to reverse everything
[9:48] that went wrong in the garden and
[9:49] restored all back
[9:51] for his elect seed that is the mystery
[9:53] of redemption
[9:55] that's the mystery of god the mystery
[9:58] there's one mystery that's been revealed
[10:00] by the sounding of the seventh angel and
[10:02] that mystery has many
[10:04] mysteries laying under it but it's one
[10:05] mystery and it's the mystery of
[10:07] redemption
[10:08] how is he going to redeem his seed back
[10:10] to where they've fallen from
[10:14] and the seventh seal is the wrapping up
[10:16] the coming of the lord the finalizing of
[10:18] all that and he showed it
[10:19] or revealed it in every type that's in
[10:22] the bible
[10:25] therefore the entire bible is the
[10:27] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[10:29] the entire bible is an expression of one
[10:32] goal that god had
[10:33] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[10:35] entire bible
[10:36] what's that redemption that's the one
[10:39] purpose that's his one goal
[10:41] in the entire theme of the piper he had
[10:43] one desire
[10:44] and that's to restore fallen man back to
[10:47] the position he fell from
[10:49] oh it's so simple praise god
[10:55] and all the acts of the believers in the
[10:58] bible has been in type
[11:00] in expressing what god's great goal is
[11:02] and now
[11:03] in this last day he has revealed it and
[11:06] he
[11:06] shows it what what his great goal is
[11:10] redemption amen
[11:14] the bible is not broken down into a
[11:17] history with the jews and
[11:19] you know what he did in moses time and
[11:21] not broken down into individual stories
[11:23] it's one
[11:23] story it's not a story for the jews and
[11:26] then a separate one for the gentiles
[11:27] it's
[11:27] one story it's the story of redemption
[11:32] let's go back to esther we'll just do a
[11:35] really quick review and then move on
[11:38] in esther we find out that there is a
[11:40] queen her name's vashti which means
[11:42] beautiful
[11:43] and that queen uh was
[11:46] was bidden to come to a feast amen and
[11:48] this is a feast that's in the third year
[11:50] of the king
[11:51] and and if you look at the numbers we're
[11:53] going to see the numbers three
[11:55] the numbers 7 the number's 10 and the
[11:58] number's 12
[11:59] all the way through this this book it's
[12:02] amazing
[12:03] brother branham says if you miss the
[12:04] numerology of the bible you're going to
[12:06] miss the bible you're going to miss the
[12:07] meaning
[12:08] you have to go back and get it again so
[12:10] we can't miss what god is trying to show
[12:12] us
[12:12] because there's a reason it wasn't in
[12:14] the in this in the sixth reign
[12:15] the reason it wasn't in the first year
[12:17] of his reign there's a reason it was in
[12:18] the third year of his reign
[12:20] there's a reason why he had a feast for
[12:22] 180 days which is six months
[12:24] and after that and the seventh month is
[12:26] when there's going to be a change in the
[12:27] order of the queen
[12:29] there's a reason all these numbers are
[12:31] laid out there amen
[12:32] and then he had seven chamberlains which
[12:34] were seven eunuchs which were the seven
[12:35] servants that served before the lord
[12:37] which represent the seven spirits of god
[12:39] amen which represents the seven church
[12:41] age messengers and so
[12:43] he wanted vashti to come in the seventh
[12:46] month and in the seventh month he wanted
[12:48] her to present herself
[12:49] before all the nobles and so he didn't
[12:51] go himself
[12:52] he sent the seven chamberlains and the
[12:55] seven chamberlains went and delivered
[12:57] the message of the king to the queen
[12:59] and the queen refused the king by
[13:02] the chamberlains same thing that's
[13:06] happened in our day
[13:07] the church has refused the voice of all
[13:09] seven
[13:10] sounding in one day they refused the
[13:12] seven church age messengers
[13:14] amen and because of that the king put
[13:16] her away
[13:18] amen and then he decided
[13:22] he's going to get another one who is
[13:24] better than she
[13:26] all right we found out he's not looking
[13:29] so much for somebody more beautiful he's
[13:30] not looking for beauty he had beauty
[13:32] but beauty refused him the the thing
[13:34] that he's looking for is not just beauty
[13:37] he's looking for character someone that
[13:39] won't refuse him
[13:41] and how will they not refuse him amen
[13:44] they refused him by not listening to the
[13:46] chamberlains
[13:47] by not listening to the his voice as it
[13:49] came through the voice of the
[13:50] chamberlains
[13:52] now he's looking for somebody who's not
[13:54] going to refuse
[13:55] and so we find out that esther a girl in
[13:57] obscurity
[13:58] not known to anybody else through a
[14:00] process of time she goes through
[14:01] purification
[14:02] and the house of the women which was
[14:04] which was oversaw by another chamberlain
[14:06] haggai
[14:07] which is represents brother branham and
[14:09] our day the seventh messenger
[14:10] who is giving a message of purification
[14:14] amen a message of get out of this and
[14:17] stop that and don't do that and dress
[14:20] this way and talk this way and act this
[14:22] way
[14:23] amen what is it he's preparing esther to
[14:26] meet the king
[14:28] preparing esther to meet the king and
[14:30] they want to call it legalism it's not
[14:31] legalism
[14:32] it's the most liberating thing on this
[14:34] earth because we don't want to be
[14:35] rejected by the king and we can only
[14:37] come according to his word
[14:40] and so now we've had a chamber out here
[14:41] who's saying don't wear that
[14:43] don't go there don't talk that way don't
[14:46] believe those things
[14:49] it's not legalism he's not trying to
[14:51] make a church more beautiful he's trying
[14:52] to prepare her for her encounter with
[14:54] the king
[14:55] because he's getting a bride ready to
[14:57] meet the king so they're going to be an
[14:58] invisible union of the bride and the
[15:00] bridegroom
[15:01] he's trying to get her in position so
[15:03] that the king will find
[15:04] favor she'll find favor in the eyes of
[15:06] the king why
[15:07] she's come according to his will
[15:10] according to his desires
[15:12] according to his likings
[15:15] so we find out it was time that the
[15:18] virgins could go before the king
[15:20] and they all had an opportunity to go
[15:22] before the king
[15:24] and they all could take anything that
[15:26] they desired out of the house of women
[15:28] into their encounter with the king
[15:31] anything
[15:32] so who knows what they took who knows
[15:34] what their desire was
[15:35] but god never took away free moral
[15:37] agency and he still today has not taken
[15:39] away form free moral agency
[15:41] he'll tell you plainly without proverbs
[15:43] what's the right way
[15:44] this is the way walk you in it but
[15:46] you've got the choice
[15:48] amen if you want to dress him honestly
[15:50] it's your choice
[15:51] if you want to disbelieve part of his
[15:53] word it's your choice if you want to
[15:54] correct the prophet that's your choice
[15:57] you have a choice but there was only one
[16:00] virgin remember only one virgin that was
[16:02] accepted when she went into the king
[16:04] and made queen only one and that was the
[16:06] one esther which says
[16:08] of her when she went she required
[16:11] nothing but what haggai had
[16:14] had appointed unto her she took none of
[16:17] her own ideas
[16:18] none of her own thinking none of her own
[16:19] concepts none of her own wishes she laid
[16:22] it all down
[16:22] and she subjected herself and only took
[16:25] what haggai had required
[16:28] and there's going to be a bride in this
[16:29] day that's only taking what haggai said
[16:32] not what she thinks about it but what
[16:34] haggy i said
[16:36] amen a lot of people don't like that
[16:40] but if you want to be accepted of the
[16:43] king you're going to love that
[16:45] because remember haggai was the one
[16:47] who'd been in the inner chamber of the
[16:48] king's
[16:49] court haggai knew what the king was like
[16:51] haggai had gotten commandment from the
[16:53] king himself
[16:54] esther had never met the king
[16:57] none of these virgins had ever met the
[16:59] king but look at the pride of them
[17:00] that decided that they knew better than
[17:02] haggai what they could take what the
[17:04] king would like
[17:06] well i could take the hill like this oh
[17:09] surely he'll accept me
[17:10] surely this is okay in his sight they
[17:13] had never met him before and they don't
[17:14] know what his court's like and they
[17:16] don't know anything about him
[17:17] and they're rejecting the one voice
[17:19] that's been there done that and knows
[17:21] all about it
[17:22] [Applause]
[17:23] what pride and arrogancy in the church
[17:25] systems of the world today
[17:26] they're doing the exact same thing
[17:28] thinking that they found a good way to
[17:30] present themselves to the king
[17:32] and they don't even know who he is but
[17:35] haggie i had been there so haggai had
[17:37] required certain things
[17:38] and that's the only thing that esther
[17:41] took in and
[17:42] she accepted oh you betcha she was
[17:44] accepted
[17:45] and she was made queen so we pick up the
[17:48] story right there that's our
[17:50] ketchup we're caught up are we caught up
[17:53] amen
[17:53] do we find ourselves in esther
[17:56] absolutely this is
[17:57] my story amen
[18:02] so when we talk about esther last time
[18:05] we talked about choosing a bride
[18:06] but this time i want to talk about the
[18:08] revelation of position
[18:10] because esther has there's still things
[18:13] that are changing in her right
[18:14] she's the queen now but she needs to
[18:16] start acting like the queen
[18:20] she's been she's been called and she's
[18:23] been chosen
[18:25] she was called with all the fair young
[18:27] virgins she was chosen by the king
[18:29] when her time came to meet the king but
[18:31] now she's got to step
[18:33] into that position she's been called to
[18:35] and that she's been chosen for
[18:38] we're going to take a look at that let's
[18:39] start in esther chapter 2.
[18:43] verse 21 i don't know if we'll finish
[18:45] this today if not we'll just move on
[18:48] amen but we're going to we're going to
[18:50] monitor the time here and see how far we
[18:51] go
[18:53] esther chapter 2 verse 21 in those days
[18:57] this is right after that esther is
[18:59] chosen as queen
[19:01] in those days while mordecai sat in the
[19:03] king's gate two of the king's
[19:04] chamberlain's
[19:05] big thin and teresh of those which kept
[19:08] the door were wroth and sought to lay
[19:10] hand on the king ahazeras
[19:12] and the thing was known to mordecai who
[19:15] told it unto esther
[19:16] the queen and esther certified the king
[19:19] thereof in mordecai's name
[19:21] and when inquisition was made of the
[19:23] matter it was found out therefore
[19:24] they were both hanged on a tree and it
[19:26] was written in the book of the
[19:28] chronicles
[19:29] before the king now we find out here
[19:33] this is the first time that esther is
[19:36] going to
[19:37] send word to the king now that she's
[19:39] queen
[19:40] but look at the manner in which she does
[19:42] it she certifies to the king or sends a
[19:44] message to the king
[19:46] in mordecai's name all right
[19:49] now she didn't go
[19:52] herself she didn't make a special
[19:55] appointment
[19:56] she just sent words she she communicated
[19:58] to the king
[19:59] in mordecai's name and the thing was
[20:00] found out we're going to find out we're
[20:02] going to watch
[20:02] esther progress in her relationship with
[20:05] the king
[20:06] we're going to watch esther progress in
[20:08] her positional placement with the king
[20:11] because this is the first time and the
[20:13] first time she just sins word
[20:15] she just certifies to the king in
[20:16] mordecai's name
[20:18] amen and the thing the thing works out
[20:20] but we want to move from there a little
[20:22] bit
[20:23] it says after these things after the
[20:27] queen was selected after all of this
[20:29] after these things did the king ahazers
[20:31] promote haman
[20:32] the son of hemadetha the agagite and
[20:35] advanced him and set his seat above all
[20:37] the princes that were with him
[20:39] now this is the same time amen the same
[20:42] time that the queen comes into power
[20:45] is the same time that haman comes into
[20:47] power and haman is called an esther the
[20:49] enemy of the jews
[20:51] and haman is a type of satan all right
[20:54] and
[20:55] this is satan's eden and satan is coming
[20:57] to full power today
[20:59] amen so we always have two opposing
[21:01] forces on the earth amen
[21:02] where the the the powers of god and the
[21:04] powers of satan and they're always
[21:06] there's only two opposing forces
[21:08] there's not three there's not four
[21:09] there's not ten there's only ever two
[21:11] we ourselves we're falling subject to
[21:13] one or the other all the time as we make
[21:15] decisions
[21:16] and there's no neutral decisions we
[21:18] believe that
[21:19] there's no neutral decisions there's no
[21:21] gray area that we can operate in
[21:23] we are either being influenced by evil
[21:25] or we are either being influenced by
[21:26] righteousness
[21:28] so here at the time esther comes to
[21:30] power haman comes to full power and
[21:32] authority
[21:33] this is amazing i want you to watch
[21:36] mordecai also because mordecai is an
[21:37] interesting figure in esther
[21:40] mordecai we found out last time is a
[21:42] benjamite
[21:43] amen the benjaminite is the little tribe
[21:46] brother benham talks about and he types
[21:47] benjamin little benjamin with 144
[21:50] 000. so mordecai represents the 144
[21:53] thousand that are going to be saved
[21:54] amen that are going to be part of that
[21:56] elect that's called out through the two
[21:58] prophets in revelations 11.
[22:00] so but mordecai also in typology and
[22:04] esther
[22:04] represents christ in many ways so we're
[22:07] going to find that here
[22:08] it's amazing you know no type in the
[22:11] bible is exactly perfect
[22:14] right because god's doing several things
[22:15] he's telling what happened in history
[22:17] he's showing what happened in the future
[22:19] he's showing what's going to happen to
[22:20] the jews he's going to show what happens
[22:21] to the bride
[22:22] so god's always accomplishing so much in
[22:24] every story in the bible
[22:25] amen so we want to watch we want to
[22:27] watch mordecai he's an interesting
[22:29] figure
[22:32] so haman rises to power and haman's got
[22:35] a problem
[22:36] mordecai won't bow to him now
[22:40] you've got to think on first reading
[22:42] this and i've heard
[22:43] commentators from denominations say you
[22:46] know
[22:47] mordecai he's a good jew he just won't
[22:49] worship anybody he won't bow to anybody
[22:51] that cannot be true because if mordecai
[22:53] would not have bowed to a hazaris
[22:54] mordecai would be dead
[22:57] so it's not what denominations are
[22:59] thinking it's not that mordecai refused
[23:00] to bow down anybody
[23:02] he's a servant of the king a keeper of
[23:04] the gate he has to bow to azaris
[23:07] we understand that so this
[23:09] denominational thinking is absolute
[23:10] foolishness it's not that mordecai
[23:13] won't bow to anything else it's mordecai
[23:15] won't bow to haman
[23:18] he won't bow down to haman why because
[23:20] haman is an agagite
[23:22] comes from king ag which was the last of
[23:24] the amalekites
[23:27] the amalekites were the largest tribe of
[23:29] the canaanites
[23:31] so the malachites represent the
[23:32] canaanites which were which ruled canaan
[23:34] land which they were supposed to
[23:36] dispossess the land of
[23:37] and drive them out and they became their
[23:39] eternal enemies
[23:41] so here is why he calls him the the
[23:43] haman
[23:44] the enemy of the jews because he was an
[23:46] amalekite from king ag and agagite
[23:49] and this is the last time that we're
[23:51] going to see an amalekite in scripture
[23:54] hallelujah haman's about to meet
[23:56] destruction him and all his sons in his
[23:59] whole household and we're going to find
[24:00] out the destruction of the amalekites
[24:02] which is the destruction of satan
[24:04] is going to take place right here when
[24:06] the queen comes to power
[24:08] in esther so there's a reason that
[24:11] mordecai will not bow to haman
[24:14] because haman is the enemy of the jews
[24:17] haman is an agagite
[24:20] which is an amalekite amen
[24:23] i love the way god puts things in the
[24:25] scriptures
[24:28] verse eight let's skip down to verse
[24:29] eight and haman said unto king ahazerus
[24:31] there is a certain people scattered
[24:33] abroad and dispersed among the people in
[24:34] all the provinces of thy kingdom
[24:36] and their laws are diverse from all the
[24:38] people neither keep they the king's laws
[24:40] therefore it is not for the king's
[24:42] prophet to suffer them
[24:44] if it please the king let it be written
[24:46] that they may be destroyed and i will
[24:47] pay ten thousand talents of silver to
[24:49] the hands of those
[24:51] that have the charge of the business to
[24:52] bring it unto the king's treasures
[24:55] and the king took his ring from his hand
[24:56] and gave it to haman the son of
[24:58] hamadatha the agagite the jews
[25:01] enemy
[25:05] here he's got a problem with mordecai
[25:09] amen but to get mordecai he recognizes
[25:12] that the reason mordecai
[25:14] won't bow is because he's a jew
[25:18] and so now haman decides to wipe out all
[25:22] the jews the the people of god the
[25:24] chosen and elect of god
[25:26] he's going to wipe them out because
[25:27] mordecai will not bow and this reminds
[25:30] me of an interesting story
[25:32] i think in the book of luke
[25:36] let's go to luke chapter 4. keep your
[25:37] place in esther we're coming right back
[25:39] but let's look at luke chapter 4.
[25:56] luke chapter 4 jesus
[25:59] is in the wilderness being tempted of
[26:01] the devil
[26:04] we get to verse 5 and it says in the
[26:07] devil
[26:08] taking him up into a high mountain
[26:09] showed unto him all the kingdoms of the
[26:11] world in a moment of time
[26:13] and the devil said unto him all this
[26:16] power
[26:16] will i give thee this is political power
[26:19] power over the nations
[26:21] he said all this power will i give thee
[26:23] and the glory of them
[26:24] for that is delivered unto me
[26:30] who's the ruler of all the kingdoms the
[26:32] devil
[26:34] scripture tells us right here he's
[26:36] offering it to
[26:37] jesus this power all this power of all
[26:40] these kingdoms will i give unto thee
[26:42] amen and in the way he words it he says
[26:46] uh i will give to thee and the glory of
[26:49] them
[26:50] for that is delivered unto me
[26:53] so devil the devil has the power of all
[26:55] the nations and the glory of all the
[26:57] nations have been delivered unto him
[27:00] what did the king give to haman his ring
[27:03] amen amen
[27:09] delivered to me for that is delivered
[27:11] unto me and to whomsoever
[27:13] i will i give it is the devil lying
[27:17] no he's not lying amen he's the prince
[27:19] of the power of the air
[27:21] amen he is the ruler of satan's eden he
[27:23] sets as a king over this world
[27:25] amen and this is a type of haman and he
[27:28] says i've got the power and he's
[27:29] offering it
[27:30] to jesus but jesus only has to do one
[27:33] thing
[27:34] if thou therefore will worship me
[27:38] all shall be thine and jesus answered
[27:41] and said to him get thee behind me satan
[27:44] for it is written thou shalt worship the
[27:45] lord thy god and him only
[27:48] shalt thou serve haman was given a ring
[27:51] and haman want to destroy the jews
[27:53] because mordecai
[27:54] would not bow to him amen
[27:59] i love the typology
[28:03] now when he goes and make this decree to
[28:05] the king it's interesting
[28:07] what year in the reign of atazeras he
[28:09] decides to do this
[28:10] and at verse seven it says in the first
[28:13] month that is the month nisan in the
[28:14] twelfth year of king and hazaris
[28:16] they cast per in the lot before haman
[28:19] from day to day and from the month to
[28:21] month
[28:21] to the 12th month that is the month adar
[28:24] so in the 12th year he spent the whole
[28:26] year casting this lot before he goes
[28:28] into the king
[28:29] and he goes in amen he decides to do
[28:32] this he's not given the authority to do
[28:34] it until the 13th month
[28:36] but in the 13th or the first 13th day of
[28:39] the first month in the next year
[28:40] but it all takes place and transpires in
[28:42] 12 12 12
[28:44] 12. it's the number of the jews the
[28:47] number of the jews are going to be
[28:48] redeemed as 12 12 tribes
[28:50] amen so let's move on to verse
[28:54] or chapter four so it in the meantime
[28:56] just keep our story straight
[28:58] haman decides that he's going to he's
[29:00] going to cast this plan
[29:02] and he's going to overthrow all the
[29:03] god's people the elect of god
[29:05] and so he goes to the king and and the
[29:07] king gives him the power and the
[29:08] authority to do
[29:10] what he wants to do
[29:13] the devil shows to jesus that he's got
[29:15] the power
[29:16] and the authority over the kingdoms and
[29:18] the power and his glory
[29:20] is his has been delivered unto him right
[29:22] so we're keeping our type straight
[29:25] so then then mordecai then he writes a
[29:28] decree that
[29:29] that the people are allowed to destroy
[29:30] the jews and they're allowed to plunder
[29:32] their stuff and they're allowed
[29:33] to take all their things and he says on
[29:35] a certain day in a certain time
[29:37] then we can all attack the jews and have
[29:38] all their stuff so the plan is sealed by
[29:41] the king's
[29:42] king's ring and so nothing can change
[29:44] that amen
[29:46] it's amazing how we have received a law
[29:49] there's been a law and that law is cut
[29:52] that law is predicting our destruction
[29:56] there's been a law of the lord and it
[29:57] was written by moses and moses took the
[30:00] law of the lord and in that writing of
[30:01] the law
[30:01] he said the soul that sinneth that soul
[30:03] shall die amen
[30:05] and there was a substitute offered for
[30:06] sin for the covering but we're still
[30:08] we're sold under sin
[30:09] paul is telling us in romans 7 that
[30:12] which i would do i do not and that's
[30:13] what i don't know that's the thing i do
[30:15] and he says
[30:15] i find out that i'm a slave to sin
[30:19] amen in the law the decree the law of
[30:22] the land that was sealed
[30:24] amen it was our destruction
[30:27] hallelujah so we find ourselves in the
[30:30] same place
[30:31] so mordecai he's he's fasting he's in
[30:34] sackcloth and ashes and and they come
[30:36] and they tell esther about it and esther
[30:37] sends inquiry to find out why mordecai
[30:40] is so distraught and he sends a copy of
[30:43] the law
[30:43] that's going to destroy all the people
[30:45] of god and she reads that
[30:47] and she says what shall i do and he says
[30:49] you go unto the king
[30:51] we're going to pick up the story there
[30:54] remember last time mordecai talked to
[30:56] esther
[30:57] she certified to the king in mordecai's
[30:59] name
[31:01] now mordecai saying you go to the king
[31:05] she's progressing in her positional
[31:08] placement
[31:10] she's progressing or she needs to
[31:12] progress
[31:13] 411 this is her response all the king's
[31:17] servants and the people of the king's
[31:19] prophet says do know
[31:20] that whosoever whether man or woman
[31:22] shall come unto the king and to the
[31:24] inner court
[31:24] who is not called there is one law of
[31:27] his to put him to death except such to
[31:29] whom the king
[31:30] shall hold out the golden scepter and
[31:33] that he may live
[31:34] but i have not been called to come unto
[31:36] the king these thirty days
[31:40] i want to talk about the golden scepter
[31:42] for just a minute this is interesting
[31:45] the golden scepter the king and many
[31:46] times the kings their power authority to
[31:49] rule was represented in the scepter they
[31:51] held in their hand when they were on the
[31:52] judgment seat
[31:53] amen and here they have a law that
[31:55] nobody who approaches on the king will
[31:57] be accepted and the king
[31:58] unless he extends this scepter and this
[32:01] scepter is
[32:02] symbolic of his entire kingdom with his
[32:05] power and authority to rule
[32:08] so the scepter has a lot of symbology
[32:10] attached to that
[32:11] and unless they extended the scepter
[32:14] which was the power of the kingdom
[32:17] and you came up and touched that scepter
[32:20] received it it's extended and it's
[32:22] received then you're going to be killed
[32:26] all right so and it's a golden scepter
[32:30] it's not a silver it's not a wooden it's
[32:32] a golden scepter which is a type of
[32:34] deity
[32:35] amen so
[32:39] so she says i've not been called unto
[32:41] the king these 30 days
[32:43] i know that whosoever goes they're going
[32:45] to die except one thing
[32:47] except the king extend the golden
[32:48] scepter unto them other than that
[32:50] they're going to die so esther's afraid
[32:52] to approach unto the king
[32:55] not according to his bidding but
[32:56] according to her will
[33:00] she's afraid to go right to the throne
[33:03] of god esther
[33:06] knows that she's been called esther
[33:08] knows that she's been
[33:10] chosen but one thing esther doesn't know
[33:14] for sure
[33:16] she doesn't know what's in the back part
[33:18] of the king's mind
[33:20] she doesn't know what the king is
[33:22] thinking about her
[33:24] she doesn't know how much the king loves
[33:26] her she doesn't know if she'll be
[33:27] accepted
[33:28] or she doesn't know she'll be rejected
[33:30] so though she's called
[33:31] though she's chosen those she can send
[33:34] by certification certified to the king
[33:36] though the king can bid her to come at
[33:38] certain times she doesn't know for sure
[33:41] what's in the back part of his mind she
[33:43] doesn't know for sure
[33:44] how the king feels about her
[33:48] amen she's about to get a revelation
[33:54] verse 16.
[33:58] she tells esther finally decides she's
[34:00] going to go in so she says go gather
[34:01] together all the jews that are
[34:03] present in shushan and fast ye for me
[34:06] and neither eat nor drink three days
[34:08] night or day i also and my maidens will
[34:10] fast likewise and so will i go in unto
[34:12] the king
[34:13] which is not according to the law and if
[34:16] i perish
[34:17] i perish she knew
[34:21] she knew you're not supposed to go in
[34:24] there outside the appointed time
[34:27] but she didn't realize atonement was
[34:30] already complete
[34:31] the high priest has already been atoning
[34:33] for blood and now she can go boldly into
[34:35] the throne of grace
[34:38] she's still stuck in the old legal
[34:39] thinking only the high priest only once
[34:41] a year
[34:41] not outside the appointed time and not
[34:43] without blood can go in but she's failed
[34:45] to realize there's already been a high
[34:47] priest laying back
[34:48] there for seven church ages laying the
[34:50] blood stripes of atonement down
[34:51] and now she can boldly anytime she wants
[34:55] approaching to the throne of grace
[34:58] she's got to catch a greater revelation
[35:03] amen so she says fast for me three days
[35:08] esther five verse one now it came to
[35:11] pass
[35:11] on the third day
[35:14] oh do we love the numerology of god
[35:18] do we love his numbers on the third
[35:21] day that esther put on her
[35:24] royal apparel
[35:27] what did we learn last time brother
[35:28] branham said let this be the crowning of
[35:30] my ministry
[35:31] that i am clothing a bride amen
[35:35] in the word amen watch the royal apparel
[35:38] the royal apparel
[35:39] is the word of god and this bride has
[35:42] been clothed amen
[35:43] in the word of god and so now esther
[35:45] knows that when she's going to approach
[35:47] unto the king
[35:48] she can't just come any away she's got
[35:50] to wear the royal garment
[35:52] she's got to wear she's been trained in
[35:54] the house of haggai
[35:55] she knows what the right kind of dress
[35:57] is
[35:58] and that's to be dressed in his word so
[36:01] when she approaches him she approaches
[36:02] him
[36:03] covered in the word amen
[36:09] in the third day jesus says destroy this
[36:13] temple and in
[36:14] three days i'll raise it up again and he
[36:16] spoke of the temple of his body
[36:18] but we know that wasn't his last body
[36:20] he's got another body what is his body
[36:22] the body is the church amen the body is
[36:25] the bride
[36:26] and that body was destroyed by babylon
[36:29] in the dark ages but through three ages
[36:32] he's been restoring back
[36:33] and in the third age he's restored back
[36:36] now he's brought the the bride into the
[36:38] presence of the king
[36:40] and the third day
[36:43] so it came to pass on the third day that
[36:45] esther put on a royal apparel
[36:46] and stood in the inner court of the
[36:48] king's house
[36:50] over against the king's house and the
[36:51] king sat upon his royal throne in the
[36:53] royal
[36:54] house over against the gate of the house
[36:56] and it was so when the king saw
[36:57] esther the queen standing in the court
[36:59] that she obtained
[37:00] favor in his sight how could she not
[37:03] she's clothed in his word
[37:05] she's got the royal apparel on amen
[37:08] she's come at the right time she's
[37:10] coming the third day
[37:12] hallelujah
[37:16] in favor in a sight and the king held
[37:17] out to esther
[37:19] the golden scepter that was in his hand
[37:23] so esther drew near and touched the top
[37:26] of the scepter
[37:27] then said the king unto her what will
[37:29] thou queen esther
[37:30] and what is thy request i it shall be
[37:33] given thee
[37:34] to half of the kingdom
[37:39] is there any doubt nestor's mind what
[37:41] the king thinks of her now
[37:43] she may have been nervous about going to
[37:45] the inner chamber she may have been
[37:46] nervous about going of her own bidding
[37:48] of her own desire according to her own
[37:50] will before the king
[37:51] she may not have known for sure what was
[37:53] in the back part of his mind
[37:54] but as soon as she entered into his
[37:56] presence and he extended the golden
[37:58] scepter
[37:59] and she received mercy
[38:02] because he extended unto her mercy and
[38:04] she received mercy
[38:06] just as soon as she had then he makes a
[38:08] declaration not she but he
[38:11] what's your petition what shall be done
[38:14] for you
[38:14] it shall be done for you up to half
[38:18] my kingdom oh all fear melted away right
[38:22] then
[38:23] then she knows he loves me he loves me
[38:26] he really loves me he didn't say what is
[38:29] it you want
[38:29] just a short session just hurry and tell
[38:32] me what you want
[38:33] no he said i delight in you you found
[38:36] favor in my eyes
[38:37] i'm not just giving you mercy i'm glad
[38:39] you came
[38:43] i'm so glad you came i'm so happy about
[38:46] you approaching unto me
[38:47] not waiting for me to bid but you so
[38:49] desired it that you would come of your
[38:51] own
[38:51] and that you would put on the royal
[38:52] apparel i'm not just giving you mercy
[38:54] i'm giving you half the kingdom anything
[38:57] you ask for
[38:58] up to half the kingdom that's how happy
[39:00] i am that you came to me today
[39:03] oh esther's not afraid anymore if that
[39:06] was you
[39:07] if that was you where would fear go it
[39:10] would just
[39:11] twitter away and dissipate
[39:15] man i want to look at the scepter for
[39:17] just a minute
[39:19] let's look at the hebrews chapter 1.
[39:33] hebrews chapter 1 verse 8
[39:36] he's speaking of christ he says but unto
[39:38] the son he has said
[39:40] thy throne o god now catch the wording
[39:42] here
[39:44] who's he speaking to unto the son
[39:47] he saith the son is jesus christ
[39:51] unto the son he saith thy throne o
[39:54] god. how many gods do you see there
[39:59] how many gods is that did he just call
[40:01] the son
[40:02] god he just called the son god
[40:07] amen unto the son he saith thy
[40:10] throne o god
[40:14] amen is forever and ever
[40:17] a scepter of righteousness is the
[40:19] scepter of thy
[40:21] kingdom what is the scepter of the sun
[40:24] what's his scepter a scepter of
[40:28] righteousness
[40:33] how do you get righteousness
[40:39] esther needed the scepter to be extended
[40:41] unto her
[40:42] the golden scepter amen
[40:45] the symbol of authority the symbol of
[40:47] the kingdom
[40:49] she needed to be extended her and she
[40:50] had to come up and accept it
[40:54] the symbol the scepter of christ the
[40:56] scepter of the kingdom of god
[40:59] is righteousness a skeptic of
[41:01] righteousness how
[41:03] do we get righteousness
[41:06] the same way abraham got it how did
[41:08] abraham get righteousness
[41:10] abraham believed god and it was counted
[41:14] unto him for righteousness
[41:16] oh she needed mercy esther needed
[41:18] somebody to extend
[41:20] amen somebody to extend mercy in the
[41:22] scepter of the kingdom the power of the
[41:24] kingdom
[41:24] the the symbol of the power of the
[41:26] kingdom need to be access
[41:28] extended unto her and she had to accept
[41:30] it and now
[41:31] we know that christ has a scepter of
[41:33] righteousness but how do i get
[41:35] righteousness
[41:36] the only way i can get righteousness is
[41:38] if he extends his word to me
[41:42] that's the only way abraham got it and
[41:44] we're the royal seat of abraham we've
[41:45] got to get it the same way abraham got
[41:47] it by faith
[41:48] by faith and want by faith in god's word
[41:51] he believed god
[41:52] and it was counted unto him for
[41:54] righteousness because god gave him his
[41:56] word
[41:56] and abraham come up and received it and
[41:58] it was accounted unto him for
[42:00] righteousness
[42:01] and now in our day he's given us his
[42:03] word a golden scepter
[42:05] amen he said heaven it consists of his
[42:08] word god is the word
[42:12] christ is the word the bride is the
[42:16] word the kingdom is the word
[42:19] he's extended unto us a golden scepter
[42:24] mercy has been extended to the bride
[42:29] but she's got to go up and take it
[42:33] she's got to go up and take it i was
[42:36] studying on the scepter yesterday
[42:37] and it was amazing to me they don't know
[42:39] what the scepter looked like in this day
[42:41] but shortly after that when we move into
[42:43] the roman kingdom
[42:44] it said the roman scepters were always
[42:46] topped with an
[42:48] eagle on top
[42:51] oh i wish we had a picture of the
[42:53] scepter because could you just imagine
[42:55] esther walking up to a golden scepter
[42:56] with
[42:57] an eagle on top
[43:00] and where does she find mercy she
[43:02] touches the
[43:03] top of the scepter
[43:06] through the eagle anointing through the
[43:09] eagle anointing which is the fourth
[43:10] anointing to come to the church
[43:12] which is the anointing that shows the
[43:14] positional placing of the church
[43:15] which is the one that's the extension of
[43:18] the royal scepter in our day
[43:21] men you can't go anywhere else and find
[43:24] this
[43:25] you can't go anywhere else and find this
[43:27] kind of mercy extended from the king
[43:28] but the king has a very specific way
[43:30] that he's going to extend the mercy in
[43:32] our day
[43:32] and it's through the eagle anointing and
[43:35] the only way that you'll find mercy in
[43:36] his cords
[43:37] is if you come his way clothed in his
[43:39] clothes and then if he gives his word a
[43:41] revelation of his word to you
[43:43] then you've got to come and accept it
[43:47] outside of that is death
[43:52] amen
[43:55] he has extended his word and we have
[43:58] accepted it
[43:59] how many has touched the royal scepter
[44:02] how many has touched the royal scepter
[44:04] if you've touched the royal scepter you
[44:06] found mercy you're clothed in
[44:08] righteousness
[44:09] and he has said not thank you for coming
[44:12] now move along
[44:12] he said what is it that you want my dear
[44:16] up to half my kingdom i don't know about
[44:18] you but the word says i'm a joint heir
[44:21] with christ
[44:23] joint heir brother bam says 50
[44:26] 50. up to half the kingdom
[44:30] up to half the kingdom is mine why
[44:33] because he loves me
[44:36] hallelujah now esther knows
[44:40] brother branham said in revelation of
[44:42] jesus christ in the church age book
[44:44] now remember this this is when the angel
[44:47] tells him to pick up your pen and write
[44:48] and i refer to this all the time but i
[44:49] want to read it again
[44:52] christ at the true church is a
[44:53] continuation of the book of acts
[44:56] but the book of revelation shows how
[44:57] that the antichrist spirit would come
[45:00] into the church and defile it
[45:02] so first we want to see that christ in
[45:04] the true church
[45:05] is a continuation of the book of acts
[45:08] amen but the book of revelation shows
[45:12] how the antichrist spirit would come
[45:13] into the church and defile it
[45:15] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[45:18] now he didn't say that the antichrist
[45:20] spirit would come against the church
[45:22] making it lukewarm and powerless and
[45:24] defiling he said it would come
[45:26] into the church
[45:29] it's not the outside forces we have to
[45:31] watch and worry about that's not the
[45:32] problem it's never been the problem in
[45:34] the church
[45:35] never the outside forces it's always the
[45:37] inside
[45:38] forces because the antichrist spirit is
[45:40] trying to move
[45:41] inside to the church
[45:48] it exposes satan
[45:51] revealing his works the attempted
[45:53] destruction of god's people
[45:54] and the desecration of god's word right
[45:57] down to the time he is cast into the
[45:58] lake of fire
[45:59] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[46:02] knows that the people get the true
[46:04] revelation of the true church
[46:06] and what she is it's amazing brother bam
[46:09] says many times and he always says what
[46:10] not who
[46:12] what
[46:15] because she's made out of something
[46:18] she is part of something what is she
[46:23] the body of christ that's what she is
[46:26] what is she
[46:27] the word on earth the word made manifest
[46:29] what is she she is
[46:30] part of the godhead that's what she is
[46:37] when the people get the true revelation
[46:39] of the true church and what she is what
[46:41] is she
[46:41] part of the godhead he says brother i
[46:45] said you can no more be lost than god
[46:46] can be lost
[46:47] because god can't lose himself and god
[46:50] has had seed that he's sown into the
[46:51] earth and he's portioned himself
[46:53] out over time and that is him
[46:59] what is she part of the godhead
[47:03] amen are we afraid of being lost ain't
[47:06] no way in the world i'm afraid of being
[47:07] lost i can't be lost
[47:09] afraid of disbelieving this word there
[47:11] ain't no way i can disbelieve this word
[47:13] because i can't disbelieve it any more
[47:14] than jesus christ could disbelieve it
[47:16] because i'm made out of the same
[47:18] substance he was
[47:22] part of the godhead amen
[47:26] praise the lord what she is what she
[47:30] stands for and that
[47:31] she can do the greater works
[47:34] she's got to catch a revelation of what
[47:36] she is first
[47:38] and then she'll catch the revelation
[47:39] that she can do the greater works
[47:42] she will be an invincible army
[47:46] when when she realizes what she is when
[47:48] she recognizes the true revelation of
[47:50] the true church
[47:51] and what she is when she
[47:54] and what she stands for and that she can
[47:56] do the greater works when she catches
[47:58] all those revelations
[47:59] then she will be an invincible army why
[48:02] wouldn't she be an invincible army
[48:04] if she actually catches the revelation
[48:06] that she's part of the godhead
[48:07] what in the world you have to be afraid
[48:09] of
[48:10] if god before me who shall be against me
[48:13] what shall i say unto these things
[48:15] amen famine and peril and sword and
[48:18] nakedness and all these things
[48:19] what shall we say to these things if god
[48:21] before me who can be against me
[48:23] why is he for me because i have a
[48:24] special smile he likes
[48:28] why is he for me because i'm a part of
[48:30] him because down inside of me is an
[48:32] attribute a chip off the old block
[48:34] that's never going to be lost he knows
[48:36] his own he calls his own
[48:38] they are in the hand of christ and no
[48:40] man pluckett them out of his hand
[48:43] not because of a pretty smile not
[48:45] because i have a wide part in my hair
[48:49] which is beautiful
[48:53] but because of who because of what she
[48:56] is
[49:00] amen
[49:04] she will be an invincible army she can
[49:07] be nothing else
[49:09] god is invincible the children of god
[49:11] have to be
[49:12] invincible if they get a true revelation
[49:16] of the two spirits within the framework
[49:18] of the christian church
[49:19] and by god's spirit discern and
[49:20] withstand the antichrist spirit
[49:22] satan will be powerless before her
[49:26] he will be as definitely thwarted today
[49:29] is when christ was
[49:30] stood as every effort to gain power over
[49:31] him in the desert
[49:33] just want to remind you you know this
[49:35] how was satan defeated in the desert
[49:39] by the word it is written jesus jesus
[49:42] had the power
[49:43] to smote him into obliteration jesus had
[49:46] the power to throw him into the lake of
[49:48] fire right then
[49:49] jesus had the power to call for legions
[49:51] of angels amen he had the authority to
[49:53] do so but he would not because he was
[49:55] restrained by his own word
[49:56] and he was laying down a pattern that
[49:58] every believer
[50:00] every single believer can follow this
[50:02] pattern
[50:03] and this pattern is it is written
[50:07] the word says it is written
[50:11] who can say that you can you say it is
[50:12] written can you just quote the word
[50:14] you don't have to be strong you don't be
[50:16] good-looking you don't have to have
[50:17] anything figured out
[50:19] you can be as confused as confused can
[50:20] be about what's happening in your life
[50:22] you can be weak laying on your bed that
[50:25] tired and weak from cancer
[50:27] but you can still speak the word
[50:30] and it's the word it's the spoken word
[50:32] of god that's going to bring deliverance
[50:34] to the children of god
[50:36] amen it's got to be believed when it's
[50:40] spoken
[50:41] it's got to be believed
[50:44] he will be definitely thwarted today as
[50:46] with christ which stood as every effort
[50:47] to gain power over him in the desert
[50:49] yes satan hates revelation but
[50:52] we love it who loves it we love it
[50:57] hallelujah with true revelation in our
[51:00] lives the gates of hell cannot prevail
[51:02] against us
[51:03] but we will prevail over them
[51:06] we could probably read this quote every
[51:07] sunday
[51:09] because this is our victory right here
[51:12] this is what overcomes the devil this
[51:14] is what amen this is what totally
[51:16] thwarts his attempts to overcome us
[51:18] right here this revelation so esther had
[51:22] to come
[51:23] to this revelation esther had to come to
[51:25] a greater revelation
[51:27] in her walk she couldn't just take the
[51:29] revelation that i'm called
[51:30] she couldn't just take the revelation
[51:32] i'm chosen she couldn't just take the
[51:33] revelation i'm the queen
[51:35] but she had to experience it she had to
[51:38] hear it from the king's
[51:39] own lips
[51:43] the king had to tell her personally
[51:47] not through a messenger amen not through
[51:49] the chamberlains
[51:50] but there come a time when esther was
[51:52] brave enough to approach unto king
[51:55] there was a time when she went into his
[51:57] inner chamber
[51:59] amen and the king
[52:04] the king told her himself
[52:08] what would you want anything
[52:12] it'll be given to you up to half my
[52:15] kingdom
[52:17] her doubt just faded away she knew
[52:20] he loves me she caught a revelation
[52:23] right there that day
[52:24] this king loves me nobody's willing to
[52:28] give half their kingdom to somebody they
[52:30] tolerate
[52:32] or half their kingdom to somebody
[52:33] they're obligated to or half their
[52:35] kingdom to somebody in a pre-arranged
[52:37] marriage they don't even like
[52:40] but only in those that they delight in
[52:44] would they be willing to give half the
[52:46] kingdom
[52:51] brother branham says in recognizing your
[52:52] day in its message in 64.
[52:55] like israel back in her promised land
[52:57] she don't know how she got back there
[52:59] she was just automatically put back
[53:01] there why national force put her in her
[53:04] place
[53:05] now i'm going to say something national
[53:07] force put israel on her homeland
[53:09] national force will put the church in
[53:10] the world council of churches
[53:12] but the power of god will put the people
[53:14] in the bride
[53:16] not national force not governments not
[53:18] anything else you think persecution will
[53:20] do it persecution's not going to put
[53:22] anybody in the bride
[53:26] amen talk about the squeeze coming on
[53:29] and there is going to be a squeeze
[53:30] there's a persecution
[53:31] and i believe it's already set in motion
[53:33] but that's not going to put anybody into
[53:35] the bride
[53:38] no because the bride comes by revelation
[53:42] but the power of god will put the people
[53:44] in the bride the world forces this way
[53:46] and the world forces that way
[53:48] but god forces upward the spirit of god
[53:51] which is the word of god
[53:54] my word is spirit and life
[53:58] will put the bride in her place
[54:02] what's going to put the bride in her
[54:04] place the word of god the word of god is
[54:06] going to positionally place because it's
[54:08] the word that tells us we're joined
[54:09] heirs with christ
[54:10] is the word tells us that he delights in
[54:12] us
[54:16] so the word will put the bride in her
[54:18] place because she'll recognize her
[54:20] position
[54:20] in the word then she's in christ will
[54:23] put her
[54:24] in her place no national force will do
[54:26] it but the national force did drive
[54:28] israel to the homeland and the national
[54:30] forces of the council of churches will
[54:32] drive every organization into it
[54:34] but the power of god will raise the
[54:36] bride and to glory
[54:37] out of it amen
[54:40] not national force but revelation on the
[54:42] word it's the word
[54:43] that puts the bride into position that's
[54:45] why we love this word
[54:47] that's why if you neglect this word you
[54:49] don't know who you are
[54:51] and you don't know what your position is
[54:52] and you don't you don't know that the
[54:54] scepter's been extended
[54:55] and you don't know that whether or not
[54:57] you've actually taken it or not
[54:58] you don't have a revelation of that
[55:00] because we're neglecting the word
[55:02] brother branham said you let so much
[55:03] take it out of you
[55:05] he said you let your jobs and you let
[55:07] your family and you let your spouse
[55:08] you let so much take this out of you why
[55:11] because we're caught in this world
[55:12] called laodicea and we're tied up with
[55:14] all kinds of foolishness
[55:16] amen but that's not going to put us in
[55:18] position
[55:20] right sports endeavors and hockey games
[55:23] and
[55:23] whatever else it's not going to put us
[55:25] in position
[55:27] it's the word that puts us in position
[55:29] it's the word of god amen backed by the
[55:32] spirit of god that's got the power to
[55:33] positionally place the bride
[55:35] amen you can't hang back and wait for
[55:37] your wife you can't hang back and wait
[55:39] for your husband
[55:41] you can't stop moving on you can't pull
[55:44] back from the word for your children to
[55:45] save your children you'll never save
[55:47] your children
[55:48] outside of this word you'll never save
[55:50] your children
[55:52] amen you can't the only thing that's
[55:54] going to positionally place you
[55:55] the only thing is the word amen that's
[55:58] why we sell out to everything else
[56:00] around us
[56:00] we put the word preeminence in our life
[56:03] amen there's people who have the word
[56:05] will be preeminent in their life until
[56:07] college football season comes around and
[56:09] ohio state's back on the tube
[56:10] and then now the word's not preeminent
[56:12] anymore now ohio state's preeminent
[56:14] because it gets four hours of my time
[56:15] every week
[56:16] and the word might get 15 minutes a day
[56:18] or sunday and wednesday
[56:21] that's not going to positionally place
[56:22] you in the land that's not the power you
[56:24] need to overcome but the power you need
[56:26] is in the word
[56:29] and not that i hate football please
[56:31] don't think that
[56:33] but what's taking it out of us where's
[56:36] our distractions
[56:38] what is it what is it that's keeping us
[56:41] from finding our position in christ
[56:43] because it's not the word you can't
[56:45] spend too much time in the word and in
[56:46] prayer
[56:48] amen
[56:52] brother brahma goes on to say in christ
[56:53] is the mystery of god revealed the new
[56:55] birth is christ is re
[56:57] is a revelation god has revealed it to
[57:00] you this great mystery and that's
[57:02] a new birth pretty easy
[57:06] the new birth is christ is a revelation
[57:10] god has revealed to you this great
[57:11] mystery
[57:12] and that's a new birth but we make it so
[57:16] hard don't we
[57:17] we'll make it well if i don't speak in
[57:18] tongues well i never shouted i didn't
[57:20] dance in the spirit i've never seen
[57:21] tongues and interpretation
[57:23] where's that said where is that mention
[57:24] and where is that in the scripture as a
[57:26] requirement
[57:27] no the new birth is the revelation of
[57:29] jesus christ this great mystery
[57:31] unfolding to you
[57:32] you hear your name called as he unfolds
[57:34] the book
[57:35] amen now what are you going to do when
[57:38] you get all that group together where
[57:40] the revelation is perfectly in harmony
[57:42] and god expressing it through his word
[57:44] by the same actions the same things that
[57:45] he did making the word manifest
[57:47] oh if the church only knew it its
[57:50] position
[57:51] it will one day then the rapture will go
[57:54] when it knows what it is
[57:57] hallelujah i don't know about you but i
[58:00] want to go
[58:01] i'm looking for that rapture that's why
[58:03] i'm dedicating my life to this word
[58:05] to find my positional placement in the
[58:07] word and let the word
[58:08] chip off everything that's ungodly out
[58:10] of my life and get me fit for my
[58:12] positional placement
[58:13] so that i can find my place in this body
[58:16] so that we can go
[58:19] oh if the church only knew its position
[58:21] it will one day
[58:24] then the rapture will go when it knows
[58:27] what not who
[58:29] what it is what is it
[58:33] the very manifestation of the deity of
[58:35] god almighty on earth
[58:37] that's what it is amen
[58:41] well we can say it but believing it's
[58:44] differently than saying it
[58:45] we've got to know it it's got to become
[58:48] part of us
[58:49] until we don't blush when we say i'm
[58:51] part of the body of jesus christ i'm
[58:53] part of that bride
[58:54] which is the manifestation of the deity
[58:56] of god
[58:57] on earth this day
[59:01] that takes a tremendous let's get back
[59:04] to esther
[59:05] pick up our story in esther chapter five
[59:12] he she comes to the king and the king
[59:15] says
[59:16] what can i do for you
[59:21] in verse 3 he says
[59:25] what what is thy request it shall be
[59:27] given to thee to half
[59:29] of my kingdom
[59:32] and in verse 4 then and esther answered
[59:37] if it seemed good unto thee unto the
[59:39] king
[59:40] let the king and haman come this day
[59:44] unto the banquet that i have prepared
[59:45] for him
[59:47] then the king said cause haman to make
[59:49] haste that he may
[59:50] do that he may do as esther hath said
[59:54] so the king and haman came to the
[59:55] banquet and esther had that esther had
[59:58] prepared
[59:59] 6 and the king said unto esther at the
[1:00:01] banquet of wine
[1:00:02] what is thy petition and it shall be
[1:00:04] granted thee and what is thy request
[1:00:06] even to half of the kingdom it shall be
[1:00:09] performed
[1:00:10] then it then answered esther and said my
[1:00:12] petition and my request
[1:00:14] is if i have found favor in the sight of
[1:00:16] the king and if it please the king to
[1:00:18] grant my petition
[1:00:19] and to perform my request let the king
[1:00:21] and haman come to the banquet that i
[1:00:23] shall prepare for the
[1:00:24] for them and i will do tomorrow as the
[1:00:28] king
[1:00:28] hath said
[1:00:32] you know when things like this happen in
[1:00:33] the scriptures i always say
[1:00:35] what what
[1:00:38] what is she afraid how could she be
[1:00:41] afraid this is the second time he says
[1:00:43] west thy petition
[1:00:44] it'll be given to thee up to half my
[1:00:46] kingdom how
[1:00:48] could she's not afraid esther's not
[1:00:50] afraid here there's no way that esther
[1:00:52] could be afraid
[1:00:53] to tell the king because what's going to
[1:00:55] be different tomorrow than today nothing
[1:00:56] changes between tomorrow today
[1:00:58] except that now we have the first coming
[1:01:01] of the king
[1:01:03] but there's going to be two comings of
[1:01:05] the king
[1:01:07] hallelujah esther esther's going to find
[1:01:09] deliverance for herself and for her
[1:01:11] people
[1:01:11] not in the first coming of the king but
[1:01:13] in the second coming of the king
[1:01:17] and it's not when she approached unto
[1:01:19] the king
[1:01:20] that she's going to find deliverance
[1:01:23] it's when the king comes to her banquet
[1:01:25] of wine
[1:01:27] she invited the king to come to her
[1:01:29] inner
[1:01:30] chamber won't you come to my house
[1:01:34] to my and we know this is the
[1:01:35] entertainer because later we find haman
[1:01:37] throwing himself upon esther on the bed
[1:01:41] why don't you come to my inner chamber
[1:01:44] for my banquet of wines
[1:01:48] to have communion with me in my house
[1:01:53] this is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:55] when does the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:56] come to the church
[1:01:57] in the third day
[1:02:01] justification through looser
[1:02:03] sanctification through wesley but the
[1:02:05] baptism of the holy ghost in pentecost
[1:02:07] amen it's the third day of the three
[1:02:09] days of restaurants restoring the temple
[1:02:11] the three dispensations of time where
[1:02:13] he's bringing it back
[1:02:14] and the third day we have the holy ghost
[1:02:17] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:02:18] but guess what there's not deliverance
[1:02:20] in the third day
[1:02:24] there's not deliverance in the third day
[1:02:26] there's deliverance in the
[1:02:28] fourth day praise god let's go on and
[1:02:32] read it
[1:02:33] this is going to get good
[1:02:40] so esther asks if i have found favor
[1:02:42] this is my request come tomorrow
[1:02:46] then haman storms off and he tells his
[1:02:48] wife what a wonderful person he is and
[1:02:49] how the queen loves him
[1:02:51] and it's amazing that when the king
[1:02:53] comes to communion
[1:02:54] in the inner chamber of esther the queen
[1:02:56] the king comes to
[1:02:58] esther's house all right
[1:03:02] the first time the king came to esther's
[1:03:04] house was in the book of acts in the
[1:03:06] upper room when there was 120 there
[1:03:08] and that's the first time the king came
[1:03:09] to esther's house
[1:03:11] but when the king came to esther's house
[1:03:13] guess who else was there
[1:03:16] haman was there amen brother brahma said
[1:03:19] the man in the mirror is your enemy
[1:03:21] nobody else is your enemy that old sin
[1:03:22] nature that's inbred into you because of
[1:03:24] hybridization in the garden of eden
[1:03:26] your enemy your haman has been with you
[1:03:28] from day one
[1:03:30] and when you invite the king to come to
[1:03:32] your banquet of wine guess who's there
[1:03:34] haman's there brother ma'am talked about
[1:03:37] the white dog and the black dog right
[1:03:39] the white dog and the black dog you
[1:03:40] don't ever get rid of the black dog not
[1:03:42] in this life he's always there
[1:03:45] you got to keep him on a short leash you
[1:03:46] got to put him on a choker chain
[1:03:48] you got to put studs on the inside of
[1:03:50] that choker chain
[1:03:51] all right keep him tied down because
[1:03:54] haman's always there and in the first
[1:03:56] coming in the book of acts when the king
[1:03:57] came to his little bride
[1:03:59] there in acts 120 in the upper room
[1:04:01] guess who else was at that banquet of
[1:04:03] wines
[1:04:04] amen
[1:04:07] but now we've had the return of the
[1:04:08] baptism of the holy ghost in the third
[1:04:10] day
[1:04:11] and then that third day the king comes
[1:04:13] amen
[1:04:14] and who's there haman but the queen says
[1:04:17] i'm not going to tell you today and the
[1:04:19] third day
[1:04:20] but if you'll come back tomorrow which
[1:04:23] is the fourth day
[1:04:25] then we're going to find out what
[1:04:26] happens in the fourth day
[1:04:29] hallelujah brother branham says
[1:04:34] in revelations chapter 4 in 1961
[1:04:39] now remember god's got god's guards of
[1:04:42] the ark or the mercy seat
[1:04:43] he's got guards now remember that to how
[1:04:46] many john saw
[1:04:47] how many four he's talking about the
[1:04:49] four cherubims around
[1:04:50] the the throne of god how many did he
[1:04:53] see he saw four
[1:04:54] four living creatures now watch they
[1:04:56] both seen the same vision
[1:04:58] amen the four is the number of earth did
[1:05:02] you know that
[1:05:03] how many knows now before we have to go
[1:05:05] on into
[1:05:06] four is the earthly number sure like the
[1:05:08] uh
[1:05:10] it's the number of the earth of
[1:05:11] deliverance deliverance now
[1:05:13] keep that in your mind deliverance
[1:05:14] because i'm going to strike it just a
[1:05:16] minute real hard
[1:05:18] see deliverance now there was three
[1:05:19] hebrew children in the fiery furnace but
[1:05:21] the fourth one came
[1:05:22] in it was deliverance lazarus was within
[1:05:25] the grave three days but on the fourth
[1:05:27] one came
[1:05:27] he was delivered four is god's number of
[1:05:31] deliverance
[1:05:31] so it showed that these beings must have
[1:05:33] been something about the earth he's
[1:05:35] talking about the cherubims
[1:05:38] they're four four is the number of
[1:05:40] deliverance there's been four anointings
[1:05:41] through the church ages the lion knocks
[1:05:43] the man and the eagle
[1:05:44] he types it with matthew mark luke and
[1:05:45] john the same anointing on those four
[1:05:47] gospels
[1:05:48] but he says they're always there
[1:05:49] guarding the ark but he said it's
[1:05:51] deliverance doesn't come in one or two
[1:05:54] or three but four which happens to be
[1:05:57] the eagle anointing
[1:05:58] and the fourth anointing comes
[1:06:02] deliverance
[1:06:06] amen he says that
[1:06:12] in uh the seed is not here with the
[1:06:13] shuck in 65. now remember according to
[1:06:16] the revelation the whole mystery of the
[1:06:17] book is sealed with seven seals
[1:06:19] that the reformers didn't have a chance
[1:06:20] to bring forth four stages of reforming
[1:06:24] the four beasts four stages of reforming
[1:06:27] the four stages of four beasts that went
[1:06:30] out to meet the four powers
[1:06:31] so there's reformation finishes in four
[1:06:34] stages it's completed in four stages
[1:06:36] four is the number of deliverance
[1:06:40] so we pick up the story in verse five
[1:06:43] esther says come back tomorrow
[1:06:44] now there's a long gap between the first
[1:06:47] and second coming of the king
[1:06:50] because in scripture all of chapter 6
[1:06:55] which is the number of man all of
[1:06:58] chapter 6 is wedged right in between
[1:07:00] this first coming and second coming
[1:07:01] and we don't pick up the second coming
[1:07:03] again until which chapter
[1:07:05] chapter seven
[1:07:10] people thought they were just dividing
[1:07:11] out the chapters you know just however
[1:07:13] led and paragraphs and verses god
[1:07:16] is in the numerology in the bible
[1:07:20] five is the number of grace six is the
[1:07:22] number of man seven is the number of
[1:07:23] completion
[1:07:25] hallelujah so in in six
[1:07:30] haman can hardly enjoy his time with the
[1:07:32] queen
[1:07:34] because this mordecai oh this mordecai
[1:07:36] still wouldn't bow to me
[1:07:38] so he goes home and he's telling his
[1:07:39] wife oh how great i am and the queen
[1:07:40] even
[1:07:41] no man could go in but me and the king
[1:07:43] and oh it was wonderful
[1:07:44] but this mordecai and his wife said
[1:07:48] why don't you build a gallows 50 foot
[1:07:49] high on top of the house and then
[1:07:51] go to ask the king if you can hang haman
[1:07:53] it's a great idea so next day he comes
[1:07:55] in in chapter six which is the number of
[1:07:57] man
[1:07:57] it just shows the foolishness of man he
[1:08:00] comes in
[1:08:01] number six and it happens to be that
[1:08:03] that night the king can't sleep
[1:08:04] and the king asked for the chronicles of
[1:08:06] the of the records of the court to be
[1:08:08] read to him
[1:08:08] and there he reads how these two two
[1:08:10] rotten dirt bags were going to try to
[1:08:12] kill him but mordecai told him about
[1:08:14] that
[1:08:14] and he was saved and he says hey have we
[1:08:16] done anything for this mordecai
[1:08:19] he says no we haven't he says okay well
[1:08:22] end walks haman
[1:08:24] and he says haman what should be done to
[1:08:26] the man whom the king highly delighteth
[1:08:29] in
[1:08:30] well and of course he's like
[1:08:34] he's talking about me amazing how the
[1:08:38] devil plans his own destruction
[1:08:42] amen and how he's deceived by his own
[1:08:45] beauty
[1:08:46] is that what the scripture says about
[1:08:47] him he was deceived by his own beauty
[1:08:50] amen so haman says
[1:08:53] get the royal apparel put on your own
[1:08:55] clothes on that man
[1:08:56] put your crown on his head get your
[1:08:58] horse put him on your horse and lead him
[1:09:00] through the street and proclaim loudly
[1:09:02] with one of your most noble princes
[1:09:04] going before him saying behold this is
[1:09:06] the man whom the king highly favors
[1:09:12] the king goes good idea go get mordecai
[1:09:14] do everything you just said and do it to
[1:09:18] mordecai
[1:09:20] god's got a sense of humor so now haman
[1:09:23] goes
[1:09:24] chapter six he goes and he does all this
[1:09:27] stuff for mordecai because mordecai's
[1:09:28] got to be exalted
[1:09:31] amen so he does all this to mordecai
[1:09:35] then after that he goes home and he's
[1:09:36] fuming oh i'm going to get that mordecai
[1:09:39] he's going to hang on those gallows
[1:09:40] i built it just for him amen i've etched
[1:09:43] his name in the side of it we're going
[1:09:44] to get him
[1:09:46] and all of his people with him we're
[1:09:47] going to get him amen
[1:09:50] so so then we go to chapter seven and in
[1:09:53] verse six
[1:09:54] it's at that time that he's very upset
[1:09:56] and he's wroth that they come to get him
[1:09:58] to take him back
[1:09:59] to the second second banquet of wines
[1:10:02] in esther's house amen
[1:10:06] haman's always on the scene
[1:10:09] let's go to chapter 7 esther chapter 7.
[1:10:14] so the king and haman came to the
[1:10:16] banquet with esther the queen
[1:10:18] now remember when did they come in the
[1:10:21] third day
[1:10:23] or in the fourth day
[1:10:26] the fourth day four is the number of
[1:10:28] deliverance brother branham said in the
[1:10:29] restoration of the bride tree
[1:10:31] he said four killers took it he's
[1:10:33] talking about the bride tree and he's
[1:10:34] talking about four manifestations of the
[1:10:36] same bug
[1:10:36] that took it down to death four
[1:10:39] messengers destroyed it
[1:10:41] four messengers of death took it away in
[1:10:43] dogmas four messengers of righteousness
[1:10:45] restored back again
[1:10:47] four is the number of deliverance four
[1:10:48] took it down four bring it back
[1:10:51] what are those four messengers of
[1:10:53] righteousness the four anointings on the
[1:10:55] church ages amen
[1:10:57] prophesy son of man can these bones live
[1:11:00] look he's jumping ship
[1:11:02] he's moving from joel in the restoration
[1:11:04] of the bride tree
[1:11:05] now he's moving to ezekiel prophesy son
[1:11:08] of man can these bones live
[1:11:10] wish we had time i got it wrote down
[1:11:11] here but i have to miss that
[1:11:13] prophesy can these bones live what's the
[1:11:16] four stages of that coming forth of the
[1:11:18] church
[1:11:19] what's the four stages of ezekiel's dry
[1:11:21] bones coming forth
[1:11:22] but the life only came not when the
[1:11:24] sinew skin was on them but when the wind
[1:11:26] blowed upon them
[1:11:27] that's when came back that fourth
[1:11:30] message of life
[1:11:33] we got it i will restore saith the lord
[1:11:37] hallelujah glory praise be to god
[1:11:39] the fourth light is to come that will
[1:11:41] bring forth the same signs watch
[1:11:43] justification brought back the pulp
[1:11:45] sanctification brought back the bark
[1:11:47] the doctrine of holiness brought back
[1:11:49] the leaf pentecostals what is it
[1:11:51] pentecostal leaves clapping their hands
[1:11:52] joy rejoicing pentecostal
[1:11:54] what the fourth was the word itself
[1:11:57] the word made flesh fruits of the proof
[1:11:59] of the resurrection signs that christ
[1:12:01] was finally
[1:12:02] after justification been planted
[1:12:04] sanctification been planted
[1:12:06] baptism of the holy ghost organizations
[1:12:08] died out
[1:12:09] and christ has again centered himself
[1:12:11] like the cap of the pyramid
[1:12:14] he preached this in 1962 before the
[1:12:18] seals
[1:12:20] first line justification sanctification
[1:12:23] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:24] then coming of the cap
[1:12:27] that's the fourth stage that's the
[1:12:29] fourth anointing that's the eagle
[1:12:31] anointing
[1:12:31] that's that is deliverance
[1:12:39] he says in the masterpiece 1964 notice
[1:12:43] here the life
[1:12:44] that was in the husk in the in the stalk
[1:12:45] and in the tassel and the husk all
[1:12:47] gathers in the seed
[1:12:49] and the life that was in the stalk went
[1:12:51] one went to make the other justification
[1:12:53] made a way for sanctification
[1:12:55] sanctification made a way for the
[1:12:56] baptisms of the holy ghost
[1:12:58] the baptism of the holy ghost made a way
[1:13:00] for the holy ghost
[1:13:02] itself
[1:13:05] amen you couldn't marry
[1:13:08] amen the outpouring of the gifts you
[1:13:11] couldn't marry
[1:13:12] the holy ghost being poured out upon the
[1:13:13] people but you can marry the holy ghost
[1:13:16] itself
[1:13:17] because this is marriage time now it's
[1:13:19] not courtship time
[1:13:22] but the baptist holy ghost made a way
[1:13:23] for the holy ghost itself
[1:13:25] to come right down in perfection back to
[1:13:28] the word again
[1:13:29] to manifest itself now you know why the
[1:13:32] error of denominationalism had to be
[1:13:34] corrected because the holy ghost itself
[1:13:36] cannot come
[1:13:37] where there's error in the hearts of the
[1:13:38] people so he's got to dissolve the error
[1:13:40] of denomination
[1:13:42] the denominationalism of false teaching
[1:13:44] before he can come himself to indwell
[1:13:47] the people
[1:13:52] he says in the feast of the trumpets
[1:13:53] 1964 the holy spirit has been bound by
[1:13:56] these denominational rivers for almost
[1:13:58] 2 000 years but is to be loosed in the
[1:14:01] evening time by the evening time message
[1:14:04] the holy spirit back in the church again
[1:14:08] christ himself revealed
[1:14:11] in human flesh in the evening time
[1:14:16] hallelujah
[1:14:19] by the way i want to point out something
[1:14:22] here in esther
[1:14:23] that we haven't pointed out before
[1:14:26] esther in the third day she invites
[1:14:28] the king and haman to come into her
[1:14:29] inner chamber into her banquet of wines
[1:14:31] to have communion with her
[1:14:33] but then we know that she says come
[1:14:35] again on the fourth day come again the
[1:14:37] next day the fourth day which that's the
[1:14:38] number of deliverance
[1:14:40] he's showing he's showing how the bride
[1:14:44] is getting deliverance over the devil
[1:14:46] not in the third stage but in the fourth
[1:14:49] stage
[1:14:51] not just in the outpouring of the gifts
[1:14:53] of the holy ghost not just the baptism
[1:14:54] holy ghost but the holy ghost himself
[1:14:58] the personal holy ghost dwelling inside
[1:15:01] of you
[1:15:02] not an anointing on your flesh not an
[1:15:04] anointing on your spirit
[1:15:05] but a baptism in the soul
[1:15:09] fourth stage
[1:15:13] so in chapter six
[1:15:17] we have haman going home after the
[1:15:19] banquet getting all upset
[1:15:21] his wife giving him this great idea him
[1:15:23] going in the next morning as the king's
[1:15:25] waking up
[1:15:28] then haman's got to take mordecai
[1:15:31] and the garments and the crown and the
[1:15:34] horse and lead him through all of shunam
[1:15:36] shushem declaring this is the one whom
[1:15:39] the lord delights in
[1:15:40] then he goes back home and he's
[1:15:42] complaining to his family all these
[1:15:43] things and
[1:15:44] speaking even a mordecai then they come
[1:15:46] to get him for the banquet
[1:15:48] when is the banquet taking place
[1:15:51] in the evening time in the morning he's
[1:15:55] with the king
[1:15:55] all day he's leading mordecai around
[1:15:57] town the banquet of wines is taking
[1:16:00] place
[1:16:00] in the evening time this scripture is
[1:16:04] absolutely perfect this word is perfect
[1:16:09] oh my goodness those who think brother
[1:16:11] brandon made this up to to just exalt
[1:16:13] himself
[1:16:13] that's absolute foolishness that man had
[1:16:15] a seventh grade education
[1:16:17] how in the world could he make this
[1:16:19] stuff up
[1:16:20] i mean never mind
[1:16:24] there is no way there's no way in the
[1:16:26] world that he can make this stuff
[1:16:28] up they say he got it from larkin i mean
[1:16:30] i was talking to
[1:16:31] dwayne lawson the other day we were
[1:16:32] comparing notes he said brother branham
[1:16:34] could sum up all of larkin's life work
[1:16:36] in 30 minutes in preaching
[1:16:40] but in 30 minutes of preaching it's
[1:16:41] taken the rest of our lives to try to
[1:16:43] unravel what brother branham has brought
[1:16:44] in 30 minutes of preaching
[1:16:48] amen praise god
[1:16:52] he didn't copy lark and he corrected
[1:16:54] larkin i want that to go on the record
[1:16:56] because larkin had some major errors in
[1:16:58] what he taught so he did not copy larkin
[1:17:00] he
[1:17:01] corrected larkin he did not copy uriah
[1:17:03] smith he corrected uriah smith
[1:17:06] don't get that wrong i don't care how
[1:17:09] much of it is the same which is not a
[1:17:10] whole lot not as much as they claim
[1:17:12] but it doesn't matter this is the only
[1:17:14] one on earth that could correct larkin
[1:17:16] that could correct smith
[1:17:20] hallelujah so we get into
[1:17:23] chapter seven i love that at seven
[1:17:28] verse 1 so the king and haman came to
[1:17:31] the banquet with esther the queen now
[1:17:33] fourth day
[1:17:34] number of deliverance the second time
[1:17:36] the king has come
[1:17:38] all right and the king said again unto
[1:17:41] esther in the second day
[1:17:43] at the banquet of wine what is thy
[1:17:44] petition queen esther
[1:17:46] and it shall be granted thee and what is
[1:17:48] thy request and it shall
[1:17:51] and it shall be performed even to the
[1:17:54] half of my kingdom
[1:17:56] this is the third time he's told her
[1:17:57] this
[1:17:59] praise the lord then esther the queen
[1:18:02] answered and said
[1:18:03] if i have found favor in thy side old
[1:18:06] king and if it please thee let my life
[1:18:07] be given me at the petition
[1:18:09] in my people at my request what is she
[1:18:12] asking for
[1:18:15] she's asking for life
[1:18:18] she's asking for her life
[1:18:25] in this age what is it that we want
[1:18:29] what's the greatest desire of our hearts
[1:18:32] is life not this life
[1:18:36] i want my life i want the life i had

[1:18:41] was
[1:18:41] eternally predestinated to have i want
[1:18:43] my life back
[1:18:45] not the one that i've i found myself in
[1:18:47] because of hybridization in the garden
[1:18:49] not the one that i'm trapped in because
[1:18:51] of sin in the beginning that's not the
[1:18:52] life i want
[1:18:53] i want my life back my life the one that
[1:18:57] haman has taken from me
[1:18:59] who was it that caused the deception in
[1:19:01] the garden who was it that was deceiving
[1:19:03] eve in the garden
[1:19:04] who was that that was whispering to the
[1:19:06] woman amen who was that
[1:19:08] that was incarnate in the serpent who
[1:19:10] was that that was haman
[1:19:11] that was the devil and he's trying to
[1:19:13] take my life but i want my life
[1:19:16] and i'm coming to the king and the kings
[1:19:17] come to my inner chamber
[1:19:19] amen not the first time he came in the
[1:19:20] book of acts but now in this day
[1:19:23] in the fourth stage of the restoration
[1:19:24] amen and the wrapping up of all things
[1:19:27] under the eagle anointing
[1:19:28] i'm imploring the king and he's offering
[1:19:30] me anything i want up to half the
[1:19:31] kingdom but you know what i want
[1:19:33] i want my life back i want the thing
[1:19:36] that was taken from me back in the
[1:19:37] garden of eden i want that back
[1:19:40] eternal life amen eternal sonship that's
[1:19:43] what i want back
[1:19:48] hallelujah
[1:19:50] when are we going to get it back in the
[1:19:52] number four
[1:19:55] second time he come in the banquet of
[1:19:57] wines
[1:20:00] verse 4 for we are sold i and my people
[1:20:03] to be destroyed to be slain and to
[1:20:05] perish
[1:20:06] but if we had been sold for bond men and
[1:20:08] bond woman i had held my tongue
[1:20:09] although the enemy could not countervail
[1:20:11] the king's damage
[1:20:13] then then the king of hazeras answered
[1:20:15] and said unto esther the queen
[1:20:17] who is he and where is he that there's
[1:20:20] presumed in his heart to do so
[1:20:22] who in their right mind
[1:20:27] would try to take the life of my queen
[1:20:33] and esther said to the adversary it said
[1:20:36] the adversary
[1:20:38] in enemy is this wicked haman
[1:20:42] now get this then haman was afraid
[1:20:47] before the king and the queen
[1:20:53] haman was afraid before the king
[1:20:56] and the queen amen you know what scares
[1:20:59] haman to death
[1:21:01] to be exposed by a queen who's in her
[1:21:03] position
[1:21:04] by a queen who knows who she is and know
[1:21:06] whose he is and knows how to expose his
[1:21:08] works
[1:21:09] she knows who's trying to take her life
[1:21:11] it's not a mystery it's this
[1:21:13] wicked haman the aga guide the amalekite
[1:21:17] it's he take him he's the one who's
[1:21:21] taken my life
[1:21:21] it's not that we have any mystery now we
[1:21:23] don't know why we're so we're sold unto
[1:21:25] sin we don't have
[1:21:26] a denominational thinking of not knowing
[1:21:28] why i don't understand an apple in
[1:21:30] apricot why
[1:21:31] why do i lose eternal life
[1:21:35] we know who it was we know what it was
[1:21:39] the whole plan his whole plan has been
[1:21:41] unveiled to us
[1:21:42] and what's happened haman has been
[1:21:44] utterly exposed by this message
[1:21:47] all of his tactics all that he's trying
[1:21:49] to do all his deception
[1:21:50] how he's moving the nations how he's
[1:21:52] moving the denominations how he's doing
[1:21:54] everything it's been exposed and who is
[1:21:56] going to expose him
[1:21:57] who's going to defeat him the queen
[1:22:00] win in the second banquet of wines when
[1:22:03] the king comes into her in her chamber
[1:22:05] and he she says this wicked haman amen
[1:22:12] this wicked haman
[1:22:16] this amalekite that the jews could never
[1:22:18] be free from
[1:22:20] this son of agag that could never
[1:22:24] they didn't do what god had told them
[1:22:26] the first time and now
[1:22:28] they're dealing with ambalakites they're
[1:22:30] dealing with the son of ag
[1:22:33] and now we're dealing with haman
[1:22:36] the amalekite in my flesh he's my enemy
[1:22:42] but in my banquet of wine he's there
[1:22:46] he shows up but the king has come
[1:22:50] and now i'm telling the king this wicked
[1:22:53] haman
[1:22:55] this hybridization
[1:22:58] this evil that was sown into my flesh
[1:23:01] this wicked haman's got to go
[1:23:05] and guess who was afraid haman
[1:23:09] was afraid not just before the king
[1:23:13] because you know where the devil has
[1:23:15] access right now
[1:23:17] to the throne of god the devil's not
[1:23:20] afraid to go into the throne room of god
[1:23:22] is that what the scripture says that's
[1:23:24] what job tells us
[1:23:26] he's been there he talks to he talks to
[1:23:29] god
[1:23:30] they have conversations about the
[1:23:31] believers is that what the book of job
[1:23:32] says
[1:23:37] he he wasn't afraid in the presence of
[1:23:39] the king
[1:23:40] haman wasn't afraid in the presence of
[1:23:42] the king in fact haman knew that he had
[1:23:44] certain rights and privileges and
[1:23:45] authority had been given to him
[1:23:47] because they were they they were
[1:23:48] forfeited by adam and now he's got them
[1:23:51] amen they've been delivered to me that's
[1:23:53] what he told jesus these things have
[1:23:54] been delivered unto me
[1:23:56] he's got them he has the power and rule
[1:23:58] over them
[1:24:00] amen so he wasn't afraid in the presence
[1:24:04] of the king
[1:24:05] he was afraid in the presence of the
[1:24:07] king and
[1:24:08] queen when the queen exposed
[1:24:12] him that's what put fear in haman's
[1:24:15] heart and that's what gave her
[1:24:17] deliverance and that's what gave
[1:24:18] deliverance to the people of god
[1:24:20] amen
[1:24:24] praise the lord
[1:24:31] verse 7 and the king arising from the
[1:24:33] banquet of wine and his wrath
[1:24:34] went into the palace garden and haman
[1:24:36] stood up to make requests for the life
[1:24:38] to esther the queen for he saw that
[1:24:40] there was evil determined against him by
[1:24:41] the king
[1:24:43] then the king returned out of the palace
[1:24:44] and isn't it funny this is always the
[1:24:46] tactic of the devil
[1:24:48] when he knows he's in trouble he tries
[1:24:50] to make a deal with you
[1:24:54] every time he knows he's in trouble he
[1:24:55] tries to make a deal with you
[1:24:58] amen you know there's preaching
[1:24:59] anointing preaching coming across the
[1:25:01] pulpit that's just
[1:25:01] hitting you right between the eyes and
[1:25:03] you know that old devil that's been
[1:25:05] duping you into believing certain things
[1:25:06] he's being exposed right there
[1:25:08] and whether it's whether it's video game
[1:25:10] addiction or whether it's pornography or
[1:25:12] whether it's gossip or
[1:25:13] or whether it's wasting time and romance
[1:25:15] novels or whatever he's nailing you
[1:25:17] right between the eyes
[1:25:18] and all of a sudden he starts making a
[1:25:19] deal with you well don't go down
[1:25:21] we'll just do less of it right don't go
[1:25:24] get deliverance from the it's not an
[1:25:26] addiction it's just something you enjoy
[1:25:27] and it's okay
[1:25:32] we'll stop we'll stop we won't do it no
[1:25:34] more
[1:25:37] haman starts to make a deal with you
[1:25:39] when he's being exposed
[1:25:42] haman oh no no no no no no it's not like
[1:25:46] that
[1:25:47] really really it's not like no no no
[1:25:49] just just cut it back a little bit and
[1:25:50] everything's going to be all right
[1:25:52] it's not going to be all right it's time
[1:25:54] for haman to get hung on his own gallows
[1:25:57] it's time for haman to be destroyed by
[1:25:59] his own vices it's time for haman to go
[1:26:01] to where he was trying to take god's
[1:26:02] people trying to take mordecai
[1:26:04] it's time for haman to be destroyed and
[1:26:06] for esther to be completely delivered
[1:26:09] brothers and sisters we've come to the
[1:26:10] fourth stage of the ministry we've come
[1:26:12] back to four and it's time for complete
[1:26:15] deliverance
[1:26:16] i don't want to cope with my flesh i
[1:26:17] want to be delivered from my flesh
[1:26:19] i don't want to cope with the devil i
[1:26:21] want to be delivered from the devil
[1:26:22] i want to expose haman at every turn
[1:26:25] everything he does
[1:26:26] i'm going to go to the king he's doing
[1:26:28] this i want to be a tattletail
[1:26:32] hey hey hey god guess what haman's doing
[1:26:34] now
[1:26:37] i want to expose him in every part of my
[1:26:40] life
[1:26:40] i want to expose him in every trick and
[1:26:42] in every trap and i want that devil to
[1:26:44] be so afraid of me because i'm standing
[1:26:47] with the king
[1:26:48] and he's scared in the presence of the
[1:26:51] king and the queen
[1:26:52] he's not afraid when he get the queen to
[1:26:54] herself he's not afraid just in the
[1:26:56] presence of the king
[1:26:57] but he's scared to death before the king
[1:26:59] and the queen
[1:27:02] the whole world someday is going to
[1:27:03] stand before the king and the queen
[1:27:05] and then all that the devil has done
[1:27:07] through all the ages is going to be
[1:27:09] fully exposed in the white throne
[1:27:10] judgment
[1:27:11] and he's going to quiver because he's
[1:27:12] standing before the king
[1:27:14] and the queen we have to know our
[1:27:18] position brothers and sisters
[1:27:23] i want to go just a little bit further
[1:27:26] and then we'll wrap it up
[1:27:32] king goes to the palace garden
[1:27:36] haman was falling upon the bed where on
[1:27:38] esther was
[1:27:39] then said the king will he force the
[1:27:40] queen also before me in the house
[1:27:42] as the word went out of the king's mouth
[1:27:44] it covered haman's face
[1:27:46] and harman on one of the chamberlain
[1:27:47] said before the king behold
[1:27:50] also the gallows 50 cubits high which
[1:27:52] haman had made for mordecai
[1:27:54] who had spoken good for the king
[1:27:56] standeth in the house of haman
[1:27:58] then the king said hang him thereon
[1:28:02] all of his trappings all of his plan
[1:28:06] turned right back on his head
[1:28:09] brother brenham starts talking in the
[1:28:11] seal book maybe before but i was reading
[1:28:13] it in the seal book and thereafter
[1:28:15] do you remember his story of the drop of
[1:28:17] ink and clorox
[1:28:19] there's an interesting part of the story
[1:28:20] i'd like to bring out right now
[1:28:23] he says when that drop of ink he said i
[1:28:25] might have my chemistry wrong he's not
[1:28:27] trying to be a chemist he's just trying
[1:28:28] to prove a point
[1:28:29] he said when that drop of ink goes into
[1:28:31] the bleach it goes completely disappears
[1:28:34] you can't even see it anymore
[1:28:35] see what it do he goes it went back to
[1:28:37] its original form
[1:28:40] it went back to what it was before so he
[1:28:43] starts talking about the blood of jesus
[1:28:44] christ
[1:28:45] and he says if the clorox bleach that
[1:28:47] when we drop our sin our lives drop into
[1:28:49] that bleach
[1:28:50] it obliterates all sin and takes it back
[1:28:52] to what it was before
[1:28:53] and brother brennan said see puts it
[1:28:55] back on
[1:28:56] the devil
[1:29:01] the original source of all the problems
[1:29:03] the originator of all the troubles
[1:29:05] amen haman haman had this great
[1:29:08] elaborate plan
[1:29:09] he had these gallows built he had a
[1:29:10] destruction coming to all the jews but
[1:29:12] guess what
[1:29:13] everything that he had been working for
[1:29:14] however long he had been working in
[1:29:16] everything wrapped up and that he fell
[1:29:18] in his own pit
[1:29:19] he hung on his own gallows everything
[1:29:22] that he had worked out
[1:29:23] everything that he had accumulated all
[1:29:24] his plans was his destruction
[1:29:27] and now we've got a clorox bleach of the
[1:29:29] blood of jesus christ that if we by
[1:29:31] faith can step into that
[1:29:33] everything goes back to the original
[1:29:37] everything that he tried to do all of
[1:29:39] his plans through time
[1:29:40] all of his little uh treaties and all of
[1:29:43] his little undermining deals
[1:29:44] it goes right back to haman
[1:29:48] all fingers point back to haman when we
[1:29:50] cross through the blood of the of jesus
[1:29:52] christ and now it's not my sin
[1:29:55] now it's his sin i get deliverance he
[1:29:58] gets judgment
[1:30:01] hallelujah
[1:30:05] verse 10
[1:30:10] so they hanged haman on the gallows that
[1:30:12] he had prepared for mordecai
[1:30:14] then was the king's wrath pacified
[1:30:18] verse eight on that day
[1:30:22] did the king azaris give the house of
[1:30:25] haman
[1:30:26] the jews enemy unto esther
[1:30:29] the queen
[1:30:33] what's this think about this
[1:30:38] in the fourth day and the banquet of
[1:30:41] wines the second time the king comes
[1:30:43] do we believe he's come the second time
[1:30:46] do we believe this is the second coming
[1:30:47] of christ
[1:30:49] he's come where to my banquet of wines
[1:30:51] he's come to my house
[1:30:53] into my inner chamber and he's and i'm
[1:30:55] exposing haman there
[1:30:58] and after he comes there haman's got all
[1:31:01] this stuff and we see him
[1:31:02] in luke talking to jesus saying all
[1:31:05] these kingdoms
[1:31:06] and all of this stuff and the power and
[1:31:09] the glory of it i'll give to you for
[1:31:10] it's been delivered unto me
[1:31:12] but after haman in the fourth day is
[1:31:14] exposed
[1:31:16] all esther has to do is invite the king
[1:31:18] to come to her banquet
[1:31:20] she's not working she's inviting the
[1:31:23] king to come to a banquet
[1:31:24] jesus says behold i stand at the door
[1:31:26] and knock if any man hear my voice i
[1:31:27] will
[1:31:28] and open unto me i will come into him
[1:31:30] and sup with him
[1:31:31] and he with me what and a banquet of
[1:31:33] wines
[1:31:34] and sweet communion where in your house
[1:31:38] in your inner chamber and now in the
[1:31:41] second coming of the king he's in my
[1:31:43] inner chamber and haman is being exposed
[1:31:45] on the fourth day
[1:31:46] under the fourth anointing under the
[1:31:48] number of deliverance he's being exposed
[1:31:52] guess what happens next in chapter
[1:31:56] eight what's eight
[1:31:59] eternity new day in chapter
[1:32:04] eight esther
[1:32:07] didn't destroy haman the king destroyed
[1:32:09] haman
[1:32:10] and the king just allowed haman to
[1:32:12] destroy himself
[1:32:15] it was his own plan it was his own
[1:32:17] gallows
[1:32:18] he hung in his own plan
[1:32:21] but in the eighth day after deliverance
[1:32:25] is made
[1:32:27] everything that was haman's becomes the
[1:32:30] queens
[1:32:31] becomes esther's oh we may not be much
[1:32:34] of a people on earth today
[1:32:36] but you just wait because we're in the
[1:32:37] day of deliverance we're in the fourth
[1:32:38] day right now and the king's in my house
[1:32:40] and haman's being exposed right now and
[1:32:43] very shortly he's going to be utterly
[1:32:44] destroyed and guess what's going to
[1:32:46] happen
[1:32:46] we're going into the eighth day sometime
[1:32:49] after the millennium and all that was
[1:32:51] his
[1:32:52] it will be mine why because i'm a joint
[1:32:56] heir
[1:32:57] join heirs with jesus amen
[1:33:01] it's mine let's all stand
[1:33:05] i didn't get to finish this so we'll
[1:33:06] have to do this one more time
[1:33:08] how many love esther love the story of
[1:33:11] esther how many have found yourself in
[1:33:13] the story of esther
[1:33:15] better than that than that how many have
[1:33:16] found the plan of redemption in esther
[1:33:19] how many found the seventh seal in
[1:33:20] esther
[1:33:22] brother ben was right wasn't he he
[1:33:26] showed it in every type that's in the
[1:33:27] bible
[1:33:28] has he showed it in esther absolutely
[1:33:30] this entire scripture is telling us the
[1:33:32] same story
[1:33:33] it's the mystery of redemption and when
[1:33:36] is it unfolded
[1:33:37] in the last day you know what scholars
[1:33:41] want to do with the book of esther
[1:33:43] they want to take it out of the bible
[1:33:46] because they say they can't really
[1:33:48] validate it and they don't clearly
[1:33:50] understand why it's there and it doesn't
[1:33:52] really make sense and so they think
[1:33:53] esther should be removed from the bible
[1:33:56] how many think esther should be removed
[1:33:58] from the bible no way
[1:34:00] that's my book i'm there it's a story of
[1:34:03] redemption
[1:34:04] it fits perfectly in with the rest of
[1:34:06] the scriptures
[1:34:07] and you don't have to be a theologian
[1:34:08] and go to school for six years to figure
[1:34:10] that out
[1:34:11] all you got to do is listen to the
[1:34:13] fourth age messenger to the eagle
[1:34:14] anointing
[1:34:15] to the number of deliverance and you
[1:34:17] find out that esther's my book
[1:34:18] and it's a story and picture of
[1:34:20] redemption not just for the bride but
[1:34:22] for the 144 000
[1:34:25] oh this word is good musicians if you
[1:34:28] want to come
[1:34:30] come forward let's just ask the lord to
[1:34:34] bless his word
[1:34:36] how many so blessed when i was brother
[1:34:39] brother eugene bronze in edmonton he had
[1:34:41] this saying that he would he had with
[1:34:43] his church that i really enjoyed
[1:34:45] he talked about the road to emmaus and
[1:34:46] the breaking of bread
[1:34:48] and i've referred to it several times
[1:34:49] but he says
[1:34:52] how do you know that it was the lord
[1:34:54] that's been talking to you
[1:34:56] you come to church on wednesday night
[1:34:58] you come to church on sunday
[1:35:00] you listen to the message through the
[1:35:01] week and how do you know
[1:35:03] that it's the lord that's breaking down
[1:35:05] these scriptures how do you know it's
[1:35:06] the lord that is talking about the old
[1:35:08] testament prophecies
[1:35:09] see they didn't know at the time but
[1:35:12] when they sat down
[1:35:13] in the evening time across the table
[1:35:16] from jesus
[1:35:17] and he broke the bread personally to
[1:35:19] them
[1:35:21] their eyes were opened and they
[1:35:22] understood what he was talking about
[1:35:25] your heart might burn during the
[1:35:27] preaching of the word
[1:35:29] and the road to emmaus their heart did
[1:35:30] burn but it's not the burning of the
[1:35:33] heart that really means much
[1:35:35] because that could just be a man who's
[1:35:36] gifted in speaking
[1:35:38] that could just be somebody who's
[1:35:39] stroking the kitty the right way and you
[1:35:41] really like it
[1:35:43] but when you know that this was the lord
[1:35:46] all along on our journey to emmaus this
[1:35:48] morning is when he
[1:35:50] sits across your table and personally
[1:35:52] before your eyes breaks the bread
[1:35:55] and you know that's not a man that's
[1:35:57] jesus christ
[1:35:58] that's not a pastor that's not an
[1:36:00] evangelist amen that's not a teacher
[1:36:02] that's jesus christ how do you know i
[1:36:05] saw him break the bread
[1:36:06] he broke the bread for me did he break
[1:36:09] the bread for you
[1:36:10] this morning then you know who's been
[1:36:12] talking on this journey this morning
[1:36:14] it wasn't a man it was jesus christ
[1:36:16] himself breaking the bread
[1:36:19] amen we could take anything we want and
[1:36:21] make up all kinds of types and shadows
[1:36:23] out of it but that's not what we're
[1:36:24] after
[1:36:25] we want jesus christ to reveal himself
[1:36:27] in the word
[1:36:28] we want him to break the bread we don't
[1:36:30] want the thoughts of a man we want the
[1:36:32] thoughts of god almighty
[1:36:34] has he broken the bread to this morning
[1:36:37] oh then we just worship and praise him
[1:36:39] let's
[1:36:39] let's pray dear heavenly father we thank
[1:36:41] you lord

[1:36:56] this is the thing that's bringing me
[1:36:58] into life
[1:36:59] lord i'm so thankful for what you've

[1:37:12] yourself to us
