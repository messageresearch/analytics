[0:01] They believed Moses was a prophet of
[0:02] God. They believed that Moses, Amen,
[0:04] brought the plagues. They believed that
[0:06] through the voice of Moses, God
[0:07] delivered. They believed all of that.
[0:09] But the problem is they did not believe
[0:11] Moses's message. Cuz Moses' message was
[0:15] not, "I'm parting the Red Sea." His
[0:17] message was not, "I'm bringing plagues."
[0:19] His message was, I'm bringing you into
[0:21] the word. I'm bringing you into your
[0:23] heritage. I'm bringing you into your
[0:25] land. Amen. And now when they go to the
[0:27] land and it looks too hard and looks too
[0:29] difficult and they can't do it. Amen.
[0:31] They're looking at themselves, the
[0:32] unbelief that is in their heart starts
[0:34] to creep up. Amen. And it's not that
[0:36] they disbelieve who Moses is and they
[0:38] disbelieve the miracles of Moses and
[0:40] they disbelieve the supernatural. They
[0:42] disbelieve the message.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; But there was two who believed the
[0:50] message. Amen. They believed that what
[0:52] Moses had said about the word was true.
[0:55] that when Moses said, "God, come and
[0:57] told me, now is the time for
[0:59] deliverance. Now is the time to take
[1:01] your inheritance." That God had told our
[1:03] father Abraham, "I will bring your
[1:05] children back into this land." That time
[1:08] is now for the word. And there was only
[1:10] two people in all that camp that
[1:12] actually believed the message
[1:16] &gt;&gt; because the message wasn't go do signs
[1:20] in Egypt. That's not the message. The
[1:22] message wasn't part the Red Sea. That's
[1:24] not the message. The message is you're
[1:26] going back to your inheritance. You're
[1:28] coming back to be a holy nation. You're
[1:30] coming to be all that I already for
[1:32] ordained for you to be. That's the
[1:34] message. And in that message, they
[1:36] couldn't go backwards. In that message,
[1:37] they had to go forwards into the land.
[1:39] And in order to fulfill the message and
[1:42] in order to be the word made flesh, they
[1:44] had to go to the portion that was
[1:46] portioned out to them. They had to go
[1:48] take it. They had to possess it. They
[1:50] had to plant. They had to grow. They had
[1:52] to fight out the Canaanites. And they
[1:54] had to be established in their land. And
[1:56] that was becoming the word made flesh.
[1:59] That's what made the message believers.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was only one Moses, but they
[2:06] had to believe the message. Well, what
[2:08] does it mean to believe the message? It
[2:10] means to move on into the word and
[2:12] become the word and manifest the word
[2:14] and let the word flow through you. to
[2:17] come back to being the church that she
[2:19] was at Pentecost, to be established upon
[2:21] the doctrines of the fathers, to come
[2:23] back to everything that Paul said,
[2:25] everything that Peter said, everything
[2:27] that we were taught to be as a church
[2:30] &gt;&gt; with the full life, full manifestation,
[2:32] full gifts, everything.
[2:34] &gt;&gt; But not back to a one-man ministry, not
[2:37] back to everything being wrapped up in
[2:39] one man and that one man. No, that's not
[2:41] the message. The message is ye are the
[2:44] sons of God now. You are the sons of God
[2:46] and he's brought you back to your
[2:48] inheritance, back to your promised land.
[2:50] Now possess your land.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
