TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I hate you I hate to see your grace [Music] [Music] [Music] how I worship you you are my Lord sing it again make it a prayer [Music] I hate to see your grace I hate you love you Lord foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] oh it's Jesus I really want to see [Music] of this it means to me for that I really want to see let's say it again [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign if that's really your prayer today let's bow our heads and invite him to be here with us we just have a little short time together but it is your desire it's what's in your heart that makes him feel welcome you want the Holy Spirit to be close to you and make your heart open there's anything that's in the way you have something way upon your heart just set it to the side now set it to the side and say Lord I've come with an expectation and I I expect that you will speak to my need [Music] you will get what you expect if you expect nothing you will get nothing but if you expect that the god of creation can speak to you he will do so let us pray together heavenly father as we have come today the seasons are blurring together they're going by so quickly the phases the seasons of Life are going by so quickly the Lord there is one thing that grows brighter every day that is your word that is the work that you are doing in US so Lord as we have gathered together today and we are looking for what you would have for us we bow our heads Lord and just make it known specifically Lord we want to invite you to be here with us Lord what point is it that we talk about you but don't invite you to be here for God we can talk about things we can look at things but when you make it live it's it's real it's pertinent it's relevant and it connects with us wherever we happen to be today whatever situation we're in [Music] you are an ever-present God you are helped in our time of need and Lord there are many needs that are represented here today but Lord we believe that you're still a provider you're still a Healer you're still our champion it's an evil age but God the the evilness is growing dimmer and your light is growing brighter so Lord we commit our few moments we have to today into your hands ask that you'd have your way have your will Lord in Jesus Christ's name we commit it amen praise the Lord praise the lord it's wonderful to be together with you again today I greet you all you all I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus I pray that your testimonies have just multiplied since we've last been able to see each other God is good isn't he we live in a season that the world is just so obsessed with the darkness and the perversion but isn't it incredible that in the midst of that God just grows brighter sweeter more wonderful more personal every day I you know as much as we can talk or preach about it I just you know Saints the more we see the more overwhelming it is truly the more overwhelming that this message the grandness of this message is there are times when God just pulls back the veil a little bit more and you just want to go on a corner and weep and at the same time just scream and shout because your your heart is so full you just don't know what to do with yourself if you ever experienced that it's amazing thank you musicians I appreciate the worship this morning we're going to dive right into the word here I have a PowerPoint I don't know how much good it's going to do us because I don't know that we'll follow the presentation or the PowerPoint or not I do like to have at least when we're quoting things I know it's just much easier to kind of catch what's being said when it's written up on the screen that's helpful to me so I appreciate when ministers will do that so we try to do that today but I cannot I cannot commit to you that we will follow exactly this order as I was praying there's so many pieces to what God is doing right now that the challenges is not to find something to preach on there is just over an abundance and more and more and we could take days and weeks and months to focus on a detail the hardest part is to say Lord what is appropriate for today and what are we going to save for another day because it's so good we want to look at all of it but we want to make sure that we focus on What God Says is a priority for us today so this is what has been on my heart we're going to take a look at by the grace of God this little thought this morning and it is a it is a window into many other things but we want to take this one thought and there's a few pieces in here which I believe might be helpful to you by the grace of God we're going to pray that the Lord has his way precept upon precept let's go to the scriptures which are very familiar to us Isaiah 28 and as I like to say you know I I grew up in a message and I've been around preachers and message Believers my entire life and we've all heard quotes and read scriptures but when we read the scripture many times we want to read it like it's the first time we ever read it because there are times when the Lord will just bring out a detail that we might have read it for 50 years and the Lord will take one word one day and just highlight it and suddenly the meaning of that scripture begins to open up in ways that it never has I know older ones today that are in their 70s their 80s and they're just saying this is so the things that we are seeing are so fantastic I've been walking with the Lord all these years and it's I've just never seen these things before God can do those things today praise the Lord here in Isaiah 28 let's read verses 9 to 12 again familiar verses but we want to read it by God's grace like we have never read it before Isaiah 28 verses 9 through 12. Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line hear a little and there a little for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest this is the refreshing yet they would not hear may the Lord bless the word and you may have your seeds again there are many directions to go within these thoughts but I want to focus on a few things we want to build a little bit of a foundation like we always like to do we want to make sure that we have a good bearing in the scriptures and that is in fact much of what we want to talk about today is making sure that we have a good bearing that we have confidence in the scriptures we want to have confidence in the message that God has given us in this hour and we don't want to go beyond that there are times when we get so inspired by something and you know this is an example that I use often this is an example that I use often but it is it is so simple in that if you try to hit a Target and you overshoot the target overshooting the target is still a miss but many times when God tells us something he says now do this thing we get so inspired in us that we're going to do something above and beyond for God is it is that not true there are times when we feel like we want to do something so exceptional that we want to give God an exceptional gift but God says I want exactly the thing that I've asked you for nothing more nothing less there are times when we get caught up in depression and discouragement because we feel like we can never attain the things that God has said we can never do what God actually said because we feel like this thing is is bigger and it's farther away and it's bigger and farther away and the closer we get the bigger and farther away it becomes there's a part of that that's true God is is truly that amazing but there's an element of it that we put upon ourselves that we are are trying to do something for God we're trying to follow God's instruction but as soon as we get close to it in our minds we don't think we're worthy of it and we make it bigger than it is God did not give you something that's impossible for his children it's impossible for everyone else but it's not impossible for his children he said be thou perfect even as I am perfect and for anyone that does not have God in them we would say good luck we know that luck doesn't exist good luck because you can't because God is God and he has done the things that he has chosen to do and he has hidden them from the wise and The Prudent it's hidden it's a secret thing and when people aspire to be like God it's aspire to know the message though you might sit in a message Church though you might have grown up in the message you might have parents that are are believed that brother Branham is a prophet and that's a wonderful thing it's a wonderful start praise the Lord now what maybe you sit here today and you've been born and raised in a message Church been around message people your entire life what now friends are I believe that many are aware there's are Generations that are are moving on they're they're being laid to rest in the ground they're going off the scene those that knew brother Branham directly there are testimonies that are no longer being heard personally in the world there might be recordings of them but those individuals are going off the scene where is a generation that has a real personal experience with God that is so real that they can stand in front of the world with absolute absolute confidence and know that God is God and the message that God has given to them personally is real what a challenge to a generation we know that each generation has more Temptation than the last those that are sitting here today that might be in your maybe your late teens in your 20s the challenge that is set before you is impossible without God thank the Lord he said all things are possible through Jesus Christ Jesus Christ that strengthens me he is doing the work you are if you by by God's grace if you have given your heart to the Lord if God has called you you are God's people this is God's work you plant you water or who gives the increase God gives the increase so the generation that's sitting here this is always upon my heart that those that have been raised in a message Church there are there are unique situations unique pressures we take it for granted we think that they don't have trials well remember when we came out of a denominational Church my kids didn't have to go through that but they have trials just like you do they have different Temptations they have different trials maybe than what you experience and as you young people young girl ones are sitting here today God has something that he wants to do in you personally that the generations that are coming before you were held to a standard that were given a responsibility to hold and for you it's going to be a little bit different the world is changing there are those that are are coming of age they're being laid to Grant to rest in the ground they'll be raised when when the the gut calls them from the ground but the the generations that are going off the scene something has to happen something has to take place there has to be a generation that has a real Revelation that goes all the way back to what God began and intended in the beginning and it cannot be by natural inheritance man but how do we have that type of confidence we want to have confidence in God's word praise the Lord then we read our Bibles but the world reads their Bibles the whole Christian World reads their Bibles nowadays they might have different variety of Bibles interpretations of the Bible but they're reading a Bible how is it that we don't agree how is it that from message assembly to message assembly notice I didn't say church but from one assembly to another that believed that brother Brandon was a prophet believe that there's a message in this hour how is it that assemblies don't agree this is not multiple churches there is only one Church of God there's only one true group of elect and they are not separate we are joined together whether we like it or not we're connected because our father in Heaven called us named us put something in us and by that we are connected there is so much that we can find fault with one another I don't believe in there are times where people say well you just have to have fellowship with just because someone claims that they believe a certain way then you have to have fellowship with them now hold on now this is what we want to not this specifically but this idea of making an assumption we want to look at today and we want to build precept upon precept let me give you an example a physical example of this we're walking with the Lord and God has told us to go in this direction but remember that brother Branham told us that we are building a building not a wall is that right it's not just a straight wall there's a building that's being built and when God told us to go in a direction we go in that direction and we we go with the confidence that God told me to do this thing and we walk and we walk and God says take one step and we take one step and then we take another step but God didn't say that but God told me to go in this direction do you go only so far in that direction but if I take one more step I'm going to fall down the steps God told you to go so far and then he says turn left God's elect catch it and they move and don't think for a moment that you cannot make a mistake don't you think for a moment friend that you can't make mistake and find yourself out of the will of God because you can now God by his Grace Grace is not going to leave you there the identification of his children is that when he chastises his children which means they're wrong they're getting corrected they might have stepped a little too far but they say oh Lord Jesus forgive me if they've wronged somebody they go to the person and say brother sister forgive me for what I've done I need to get back on the wall God told me to go so far but I took one more step and I fell off into my own will I overshot the target there are times when we read the scripture and we believe that God May legitimately have told us to go in a direction and we went in that direction but God told us to stop or to turn and we missed it brother It seems impossible because it is it's impossible without god without the tutor that God gave you without the holy spirit it's absolutely impossible to please God it's impossible to follow his instruction let's continue on here this is from I wish I could take a picture right now you remember the Flies right one just landed on my Bible right here you don't remember that story my wife and I talking and a serious conversation with my wife and a fly comes through the room and hits me in the forehead well now they make these guns they shoot salt I don't know if you've seen those I'll just kind of leave it there 1963 the absolute so I needed an absolute so I took one God's word so I read in the word that he is the word Saint John 1 and upon this absolute I'll build my church that's right so I took him at his word revelation 22 19 and said whosoever shall take one word out of this or one word or add one word to it that's the absolute that's the end of all strife well that's pretty simple isn't it we open our Bible we read our Bible and then that's that all Strife is done should be right is that what happens that's not what happens this is the absolute just continuing on here from that same message this is the absolute whoever takes anything from it or adds anything to it God said I'll just take his part out of The Book of Life so that had to be the absolute and Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word then I know that this every word had to be said precept upon precept and line upon line that's the way it has to come just as it's written praise the lord we all agree I believe with those statements line upon line precept upon precept we believe the word now this is from Revelation chapter 5 number one so this is one thing that they might squabble about this in here about what it is but he's the one that divinely interprets it but on the back side here there's no one can do it it belongs to him it belongs to him and him alone he's the one that can reveal those seven Mysteries out and watch how every bit of it is on Redemption how the church was redeemed and what will be the redeeming so you mean to tell me that I can read this I can read what is written in black and white I can read the ink that is pressed upon these pages but not read the book I can read the front side of the book but there's something more that has been written I can memorize it I can get to know it I can read it front to back I can listen to the message I can memorize quote after quote after quote I can understand and I can talk about the message and I can make connections and all of these things but unless it's open Ed by him unless it's opened by the father or Peter where does this come from only from the Father which is in heaven how does this come only by the father line upon line precept upon precept but friends there are people that are reading line upon line but they still cannot see precept upon precept they're reading the front of the book They're reading the page of the book they really really want to understand but it can only come by the father and we cannot break our way into it you cannot study your way into it you cannot force your way in through a window God gave away and you must come God's way and you must make a request of him Lord I desire to understand [Music] as brother Benham taught us we didn't seek Him He sought us we're here because God has called us well brother I don't know if God loves me I don't know if God really cares about me that much are you here today well yes I'm here why are you here today because there's just I just really wanted to go to church there's a desire in me I want to do right I just can't seem to do right but if you want to do right there's a deep that's calling and if there's a deep that's calling there's a deep to respond it's that deep that's we're looking to respond we're looking for that deep [Applause] explain it's not reading the front of the book there's more to it let's go to Hebrews 9 if you would let's see if we can continue to lay a foundation here that we might understand Hebrews 9 . appreciate your prayers my voice will there's times when it when you when you preach it's really hard to hold back sometimes it's wisdom to hold back a little bit but it's hard and the voice doesn't like it so my voice is a little worn out I pray you just again just pray for me if you would Hebrews 9. verses 9 to 12. give me just a moment here I'm sorry I wrote down nine to twelve let's go to verse number 19 to 24. Hebrews 9 19 to 24. for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and Scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by law purged with the blood and without shedding of blood is no remission of sin let's read verse number 23 very carefully it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with ease but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these for Christ is not entered into holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us verse number 23 again it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these the picture that we are understanding that is being explained Moses presents the law he presents the law in the Old Testament they learned the law they're trying to obey the law these things are presented through Moses they're being presented as an example a type of a Heavenly pattern but what is being explained here is that this this heavenly pattern which is now Moses has set the law in order has set things in order there is something that is greater than these things though these things are representing a Heavenly pattern these things are for a season are doing a purpose but there is within that a greater thing it is not the natural that God is after and yet the natural is representing a spiritual pattern so let us say it this way within the line there is a precept so though you read the line you may miss the precept we read the precept excuse me we read the line but if we miss the precept we miss the message in the line brother I sit in a message church I've always believed the message again going back to our thoughts for the younger ones that are here today or for my heart is uh it's always burden for those that have grown up in a message church that they might have such confidence and it's the same situation where brother I sit in a message church but what is within that the young people know how to act they know how to do the part they know how to say the right words they are a physically representing the physically written words they know it I I witnessed it I witnessed those that would present on such some some were some young people that I grew up with were so good at representing themselves to the adults that they were they were really super spiritual but I knew what was going on in their private lives you see the things that God is calling us to it's more than we know this but I feel that the need in my heart to say it anyway it is more than presenting a good face we know it but friends we still at times we get caught in it and the moment when we do we start to Step Beyond what God is calling us to God has laid out these these patterns he's laid out the scriptures so that we might understand not what is written in black and white there is something here that has been captured written down but there's within it there's something that's so great that you cannot break your way into it is that simple there's a Heavenly pattern that this is what is being described here in Hebrews there's a Heavenly pattern but now God is that representation he is doing that thing literally he is in heaven representing he's given his life now in the book of Hebrews he's given his life now and he is represent he is he is doing the thing that the old testament's represented yeah it was written in the Old Testament Moses gave the law but the law was to represent something and within the law was something so precious that it was hidden from the world it was it was wrapped around it was hidden and it was not explained until the last days there's a message that's so great that you can read about it in the book and you can't get it but I really want to know what God has for my life but I really want to to know so we read our Bibles and that's a good thing we read our Bibles and we we do what we understand to do but what we're by the grace of God what we're highlighting today if I could say it this way God's word is so simple God's word is so real for every person sitting here today God's word has answers for every single thing that you have questions on but we make it something that is not we look at God's word and we change it not intentionally it doesn't matter how long you've walked with the Lord again you could be walking with the Lord for 50 years and when God opens a key to somebody opens up something in a certain way it can change your life even now today right now well brother I'm always already walking with the Lord I've been born again I know that God has done a work in me I believe this message which all with all my heart praise the Lord but now where are you at this is applicable for every single person that's sitting here today the place where you are at right now you can go further we are growing up until that moment where Jesus said at the moment when the wheat is mature it's cut down at the moment when maturity at full maturity is taking place at that moment God calls for us to leave this place how do we get there how do we know what the next step is the challenge the big question is always what do I do now how do I know how do I follow the leadership of God right now today Hebrews here in 24 we see this example of the heavenly the Heavenly pattern represented on Earth now here in 1962 presuming therefore basing back in the Old Testament I draw these conclusions for a little message now presuming Webster I've got it wrote out here Webster said to presume is to venture without actual Authority that's presuming or in parentheses he's got Webster taking it for granted just taking it for granted or to venture without authority to take something just for granted now that's something that the church must not do you're not sure of yourself if you're just presuming for you're just taking it for granted well brother Branham did it this way I'm just going to do exactly what brother Branham did I'm going to follow the word I'm going to do exactly what the word says then why aren't we boat builders because the word told God told Noah to build an ark then why aren't we all building an ark why aren't we doing that now we know the answer to that but let's use it as an example why are we not doing those things because specific instruction was given there was a requirement that was given and it was the word of God and here is Noah building an ark and of course we know that everyone disagrees with him but brother Madam gives give this this example this in the days of Jesus Jesus is walking on the Earth but Jesus if Jesus preached the message of Noah it would have been wrong how is that possible when the message that Noah received is the word of God there was a message that was given to Noah there was instruction that was given to Noah they followed the instruction but within the instruction was a representation of a precept there was something that was being represented by what Noah was doing that was bigger even than what Noah was doing God committed a precept that when judgment is about to come that he will give away of escape and here it is being played out in this dramatic scene Noah is building an ark in the instruction was a precept and there are times where we look at instruction that has been given and we confuse the instruction with the precept we hear the instruction we we want to be obedient but in the instruction we miss the precinct so we are following this instruction and this instruction and this instruction and this instruction and Our Lives begin to produce strife but God never produces strife not with his children not not amongst his children and not within his children God is the author of Peace God is presenting peace he's giving us a message of peace and when he gives us a message a message of Peace it produces peace but I'm following the instruction I'm trying to do what God told me to do but friends there are times when we are looking at the instruction and we miss the precept this is why Jesus said I come not to destroy the law but to fulfill the law the precepts are written in the law of Moses but if you try to only follow the law it produces death friends it's so close it seems that I have a genuine desire I desire to do what is right and I'm following the instructions of God but we miss the precepts we miss God's intention and in doing so we miss apply we misunderstand the precepts it is not just line upon line it is precept upon Precinct we're getting line upon line I am I'm learning what the message is I'm I'm learning all of these things about the message but within that the within that teaching within those line upon line upon line God is looking to do something God is looking to build something God doesn't give you a precept and leave it there God gives you a precept we pray on it it becomes part of us and he adds to that precept you understand this precept let's take for example Thou shalt not lie Thou shalt not lie itself is the law of Moses but it represents a precept God cannot lie God cannot lie if God speaks it it becomes he's the Creator he will never contradict himself he's the same he never changes when he presents something he is he as he says I'm God I change not he presents something to the world and he changes not and he says it's represented here in a line Thou shalt not lie but if you take the line and don't have the precept the letter killeth well brother I've got this part I've got this part but do we understand the picture of what God is looking to accomplish in Us in you and then how do we measure it how do I know if I'm actually seeing a precept or I'm just seeing the instruction of God in a legalistic way how do I know that I'm not overstepping the target not just hitting the target are we it's so simple it's like this God there's something that's set here God tells you to do this I want you to move this over here God's word perfectly fulfilled and to us we look at it like there are Shades of Gray did I do it right I'm insecure about it and God said just do this and move it there we may not understand all of it we may not know understand how it fits in a bigger picture but God just said do this from here and move it there and we do it that's representing something bigger there's a precept that God is expressing he will do it in your life he will do it in the situations that are taking place in the assembly he is presenting his precept and it's friends I tell you what the simplest things are the hardest things to preach what I see right now I see a picture that's so simple it's difficult to express it in words but it's so simple let us continue looking at what brother Branham is saying here don't presume believe don't venture out without Authority without scriptural Authority Samson presumed oh well my oh I know I I've I can't I can't get my locks anymore but I presume it's all right I'm still the same old guy I'm you know I I'm really I'm really a good person I made you know I I it was just a little mistake and here Samson we know what samsa does and he goes and he does what all the things that transpired and what is in his heart is I'm following the law I'm fulfilling it he thinks this but when he misses the precept he's now a million miles off but he thinks he's right there he's presuming he's stepping without Authority and there are times friends when we we take God's word and we want to step out in in life and we want to make decisions in life but we're stepping out without the authority of God's instruction but God gave this instruction to someone else and we know that when God does it one way he does it the same all the time yes again then why are we not all boat builders right but he does it the same all the time yes but what he does the same all the time is the precept the character within the instruction and we look at the instruction and we take the instruction and we miss by a million miles God's a desire God's precept that he's looking to express because we're following the instruction but the instruction isn't Meant For Us a million miles off how can we possibly understand how can we possibly have confidence in God's word is it the instruction maybe the instruction was given to a certain person I'll give you another example of this let's say you have two people that are they grow up in different ways and for one of them there's a temptation and they they really if they're just around us at all they're pulled into it it's a temptation to them for the next person it's not a temptation God will press on that one person you stay away from that stuff completely don't go anywhere near it and for the next person God says you go this way and they don't even think about it but they're in the presence of those things that are evil and it's a it's a it's a real temptation to this other person so here is this person's just walking along and the other person that God said you stay away from that stuff they look at the other person and say wow you hypocrite I heard the instruction of God God told me to stay away from that and look at you you look at you walking so close to that look at you doing all those things and that person is innocent in their heart they're not tempted by it they walk right by it and they're not tempted by it but the instruction given to one that person makes an assumption that God gave the same instruction to the other person they missed the precept in what God is giving them God was protecting them in the instruction they were given there's a precept the precept changes not God does not change he never changes his precept because the precept is his character he never changes the precept he takes the truth we look at the the message of Luther was a tremendous man he was a mighty man of mighty man of God in his age he stood up against the Catholic church we know that he split the world wide wide open the the anointing that was upon him the the ministry of Luther brought the world out of the Dark Ages you realize that split the world wide open there was no church there was no there was no uh Christian religion outside of the Catholic Church and he takes a step and and he he splits the world or splits the religious World open but you can't go back and say well I'm going to take the life of Luther and apply it to the day that I'm living in he hated Jews he wanted to kill all the Jews he hated if he believed that if someone rose up against the the king that they should be killed he was he was bearing the light of the day the moment that he's living in now the light that was there the light that was there the life that was there was of God I am God and I change not the life that is there with Luther moves on to the next day but what does the world do God told me to go this way I'm following Luther praise the Lord I'm following Luther I'm free of the Catholic church and they're walking walking and God says turn right I've got another messenger his name is Wesley and they come up to the edge [Music] yeah but I really like going this way off the edge they go right they heard the instruction but they missed the precept they came right up to the edge and God said now it's a change of instruction they may not understand the whole precept but the instruction changes and they deny the instruction of God and in it they deny the precept of God this is important friends because we may never understand as we sit here today we are never going to understand individually every one of God's instructions I can say that because the Bible says to each is given a Measure of Faith but you might be given part you're given part you're given part you're given part the body is representing the precepts of God the fullness of God's thoughts the fullness of God's precepts are presented in a body walking on the shores of Galilee here's a little man that comes walking and he just looks kind of rough and he's he's not much to look at it and yet all of God's precepts are represented in that one body that one natural body here in the last days God is looking to present all of his precepts in one body he said you are my body you're my hands you are my feet we get the instruction of God God gives you instruction to do such and such more than anything more than any contention more than any any other anything that causes contention more than anything that causes disagreement I have seen Time After Time where God has given instruction and it is taken as a precept and applied to everything that someone has seen and suddenly if you don't believe like me you're out but here's the thing friend the instruction to them might have been of God this is where things get so fine down so to speak we're splitting hairs because God gives an instruction to an individual and they're walking in the instruction that God gave them but that instruction was not for everyone but in the instruction was a precept in the line was a precept let's take another example of that I stand here today as a minister of the Gospel is everyone here today called to be a preacher to preach from behind a Pulpit no of course not each call to a part I have a line that I have to fulfill God called me to fulfill a role a time a place you stand here you do this but then God is calling you each of you that God is calling that God is pulling on he's calling you to fulfill a specific line well brother Nathaniel you're talking about the body working together again this is something that's always on my heart why is it because as you get in place as an individual as you're walking with the Lord the very next thing that begins to happen is God begins to put you in context in place it's no longer just about you it's line upon line precept upon precept as you're being being uh God is calling you he's pulling you to be in place you begin to work with others you begin to see others how can that happen when you think if you are perceiving that the instruction that God gave you is exactly the same instruction as the next person this is so confusing has been confusing over the years and has caused so much strife well God gave me instruction God give me different instruction well that can't be of God can't give you one instruction give me a different instruction that means that God changes no no it doesn't because within the instruction is a precept within the instruction is the mind of God and what you are expressing together is the mind of God one part is doing one part another part is doing another part now that's something that the church must not do you're not sure of yourself if you're just presuming for you're taking it for granted don't presume believe don't venture out without Authority without scriptural Authority Samson presumed oh well am I I ain't got my locks anymore but I presume it's all right I'm still the same old guy no no brother you've crossed the separating line he presumed he had just as much strength and said I'll just stretch myself I'll just stretch myself I'll just stretch out a little bit oh now I just I'm just as good a man as I ever was but he found that his strength was gone friends there's so much instability and the young people that are let's let's go back to this again the younger ones that are sitting here today when I was your age when I was 19 20 21 years old I hated that stage of life so much because all I wanted was to be confident I wanted to know where I fit and I didn't know where I fit and it ate me up inside it tore me up but these the things that the things that the Lord began to teach me as I I stand here today it's now been these years and I look back and I watch how the Lord was teaching me to walk not by sight but by faith to walk by faith in his word and to be confident to stand here today and and stumble through trying to explain something that's so difficult to explain but it's so valuable it's so treasured that if by the grace of God we can catch a glimpse of it it helps us to stand with confidence and when when we're trying to find our place in life and this is true of not just the younger ones but older ones trying to find a place in life you have to find the instruction of God for you that's hard that's hard because you have to understand that the instruction for you is maybe different than the next person God called each one to a different place and that means it's different the details might look different but within it is a precept and the precept never changes the instruction might be specific for the date and time but within it is God expressing something no no brother if you go beyond that no no you've crossed the separating line he presumed that he had just as much strength now let's go to II Peter the first chapter we want to take this these thoughts and and apply it and look at it as an example you find your place there just say Amen if you would I was talking to brother Jeremy last night and he mentioned that Brother Kyle had preached on perfect love God to love on Wednesday and I told brother Jeremy at the time I said well you you can be a witness to me that these things some of these things were in my notes and they're not because of what Kyle preached Brother Kyle preached on Wednesday so if we're looking at any things that that tie and continue that thought from Wednesday that was not intentional that's just the Lord doing that second Peter the first chapter let's read verses 2 to 11. foreign Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God of our Lord Jesus of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all the things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are we given unto us whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence added to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge we're going to stop there just for a moment if we look at this subject and let's take this this thought of the Capstone is love divine love verse number seven into godliness Brotherhood of kindness into brotherly kindness charity or love the top of this is love this is how simple that God gives us his precepts now we can look at this and say is this instruction is this a precept of God and this is both this is a precept of God and this is the instruction of God he says add to your faith virtue there's this one element of this that I want to focus on add to your faith add to your faith everyone that is sitting here today you can read through these scriptures and by the grace of God you can find where you are in these instructions all of us here today are somewhere on our journey growing in the Lord Within These instructions add to your faith virtue well brother I've heard this before I don't mean to criticize anyone but this is this is really what has been said go through the instructions of God and and someone might present this as an idea that well we live in this age so I'm going to go straight to Divine love is you know the message is here God is doing such a mighty work so I'm just going to go right to the Capstone I'm going to go right to I I believe I believe that this is the truth and and God is love and therefore I'm going to be full of love and I'm just going to be I'm going to epitomize everything that God is intending but God gave instruction here he said add to your faith virtue virtuous strength add to your faith what happens if you don't have faith how much love can you have if you don't have faith none how much virtue can you have how much strength can you have if you have no faith none how much knowledge can you have if you don't have virtue none because God said add to see as God is building throughout the church ages his church age upon Church ages things that have been building in you God is looking to do the exact same thing a principle a precept of God is that he is building line upon line and everywhere that God is building he's doing the same thing in the ages God is doing it in the age that we're living in the hour that we're living in God is doing it God is doing it in you as an individual if God is working in you he is building something I don't believe it's a coincidence that the first message that we have recorded is Faith is a substance go back and listen to that message and really carefully go through what brother random is talking about and see if your faith measures up measures up to what brother Branham is referring to I would challenge that sometimes our understanding of how how Faith even works doesn't align with what brother Brandon described he said God God has a faith Satan does it does things God does things and he said well who's doing that who's making those things move and he says neither one that's me that's me as an individual his faith was accomplishing something and if you've been born in a message Church born raised you might be a wonderful person much better person than you could look around and and maybe you measure up to be better than the people around you the Bible says compare not yourselves among yourselves but if you look around well you know I'm a pretty good person I'm a pretty good person but if you don't have faith there's nothing to build on there's nowhere to go there's nothing to add to if you don't have virtue knowledge brother Branham explained this knowledge is when something you have applied your faith something has taken place it's no longer Faith it's knowledge I now know it I don't have to say well you know I believe that God Is A Healer God Is A Healer it's knowledge to me I've seen it it's now knowledge I've built upon by the grace of God faith than virtue I'm seeing it take place and as God is looking that you would grow up in the Lord he's building line upon line precept upon precept within you and to just read the words it's not what God is after God is is after having a private conversation with you so that you can understand where you are and this is the beautiful part friends that when God identifies you and he identifies you in the scripture you just take it's like this when God identifies you in the scripture like we use the example we're walking along and we come to the edge of the instruction that God has given us and God is God is dealing with you in your life and you say well Lord I want to know what the next step is if you read the scriptures and it's just instruction and there's this one and there's this one and there are many things in the Old Testament that I don't understand there are many types and shadows that are taking place I don't understand them but there are precepts that are being represented and if I understand the precept I can follow the precept and when when I come to a place and God is pointing out he says now son this is where you're at in your walk okay Lord I believe it I may not be representing everything that God wants me to represent quite yet but I'm headed in that direction and when I find I've been looking at the Lord sits me down and I just kind of narrate it this way he says now son you got these weaknesses in your life and I look at those weaknesses and I say well Lord I want to know what to do next what do I do the Lord begins to deal with this and he'll set you where you are in Scripture and this is the beautiful thing when God sets you in the scripture do you know what to do you know what to to how to find out what to do next well Lord I stopped I don't want to go any farther your instruction told me to come this far I don't want to go any further what do I do and God shows you where in the art you are in the scripture and he says now now read the next verse and if you've caught the mind of God if God has pointed you to where you are in the scripture you read the next verses and it simply tells you what to do you find yourself in the pattern of God you simply follow pattern and God is looking at his precepts are so personal so real to us that he puts you in a situation he'll put you in a trial he'll put you in a place where you're under tremendous pressure and in that situation you say well Lord what do I do what do I do and he says what do you think but Lord I don't know he says but I've been teaching you you've come through trials you come through situations what did he say to Moses Moses I had you on the back side of the desert you already went through your education you're standing before this great challenge before you Moses why are you crying Moses why cry speak he had been going through his lessons he's learning he's growing through his lessons just like you were going through your lessons God is teaching us we're teaching us oh brother I'm in this trial and I just I come out of the trial and I go right back into another trial it's it's almost the same thing over and over and over again right because you haven't learned a lesson yet you want to stop going through the same trial learn the lesson you learn the lesson what do you do in school you pass the grade what do you do you go to the next lesson and once in a while the devil or the the devil will come along and the Lord will allow it the Lord allows the lesson to come along again and as that lesson comes along it you know years ago or maybe last week you go through the same situation and suddenly you're like yeah I mean I see it happening but it's fine it's okay and someone else has worked up they said well what why aren't you why aren't you disturbed by this why aren't you bothered because I've already been through that I already learned that precept where I'm standing that no longer matters it doesn't matter anymore what trial I'm going through what situation I'm going through it no longer matters because where I'm standing is clearly identified in God's precepts I'm standing so clearly not just following the instruction and and I hope that that makes sense today the instruction of God to one again we use the example of Noah we're not all boat builders we're not all boat Builders we're not all doing exactly the things that someone else in another age has done but there was a precept that was represented and God never changes he's building precept upon precept upon precept if we're standing in those things there is no contention there is nothing to argue about there is no strength why because we're standing not in the the details uh what comes to mind is I don't know if you've ever seen a H this is a anyone work with mathematics at all I know not very popular is it it's got a bad rap anyone seen those little they have a chart and they have all these dots on it you ever see that how they all these these dots on a chart and all it is is a bunch of dots but what's interesting is that all of those random seemingly random points if you analyze them you look at them I just say it this way if you analyze them you can draw a line that represents where all of those dots are pointing to it would call it a trend line and there's this line through all what seems like chaos there's a line that balances it all out there's a line that interprets what seems like chaos and the world that we live in seems like chaos and times when you're trying you're praying about God I want to apply your word to to my life it seems like chaos but when God begins to open it in what seems like this piece here in this sermon and that sort of I don't I didn't understand that sermon at all I didn't understand what was said here I didn't understand what was said there but Lord I feel like I don't understand what you're telling me and and God has just given you a puzzle piece it gives you a puzzle piece it gives you a puzzle piece and the date comes when he says all right now let me bring it all together for you and God just lays it out and the picture comes together oh it seems random but it's not I'm reading this line and I'm reading that line and I'm reading all these details but through all of it God is bringing together a picture and right through all of it God brings together a picture in your life and you begin to see it oh I thought I understood all of these lines I understood all these details but in the midst of it God was presenting a precept we can read the front of the book and study and analyze and try to understand what God is saying but we cannot break our way into the back of the book we have to look at the instruction that God is giving to us individually each one that's sitting here today you look at the instruction that God has given you and build line upon line precept upon precept by God's grace is God is God is doing the work when God begins to bring the pictures together the precept is what he's after he's looking to present my I wish I had a grander way to say it we take those things and we take them so so limited the grandness of God's word is so astounding I'm just going to say it like this for you today saying if you have a question before God or you have something that you're praying about God has been writing all of these lines brother random gave us a wonderful story a little example of this is a letter that was written to him you know if a lever letter was written for his wife from his wife he said anyone else could read that letter but I'm the only one that reads between the lines I'm the only one that's used the teardrop and God is writing your line your life lying upon line but as he begins to bring out what he intends to express the meaning in the words is bigger than the words how is it that brother Branham might say something he might you know misstate a fact or something to that effect and people will jump on that how is it that he can make such a what seems like an error but then also be speaking the truth because the message the precept that's being presented is greater than that we can fumble around and we stumble around and we try to do things for God and we make mistakes but in it God is presenting something that's greater than the sum of all of our mistakes it's greater than the sum of anything that we're striving to do as an individual and again for the younger ones here God is is doing something can be doing something in you if that's your desire can be doing something in you that's so great that God will establish you and it's personal to you God's not going to make this big show it's not going to be something that everyone's like you're a super Christian God's not looking to do that but God is looking to in you you said you want miracles to happen you want something miraculous to take place in your life if God does it it'll be done in private and then you want to go tell someone else and you can't you can tell them about it and they look at you I was talking to a brother on the way to service this morning we're talking about the world that we're living in people could look at the Miracles of God God could do something it you know the blind could see that the lame could walk and the world would look at it and say huh I I don't believe that or how did that happen couldn't have been God Show Me A Sign show me a sign and a sign is shown and you see I don't believe it God's not doing that for the world what God is looking to build in US is confidence only going as far as the word has described for us to go and no further because it's already perfect line upon line precept upon precept I'm going to invite the musicians to come and invite you all to stand if you would with me foreign you love the Lord today if we can sing that little song let your word be born in the manger of my heart friends there are so many there's so much spiritual work that needs to be done when I look at myself and I say Lord I want to be living your precepts every day I want to when I when I speak when I live when I walk when I go to work I want to live your precepts the very Mind Of God I want to do those things so badly but how do I get there how do I take one step with confidence how do I just move forward and never be swayed how do I move forward and and you know there are times where people will if you stand for God people will disagree with you but it doesn't mean that we're disagreeable we want to be truly with the love of God as God is building in us as we saw there in second Peter we want to get to truly Divine love different than what people think about it I'm not going to I'll save that for by the grace of God the brothers will continue to minister them that I'm sure but those these things are different than what people imagine and the reason why they can't they can't go there they don't have a vision of it is because they're trying to apply their understanding they're trying to apply the lines they're trying to apply their natural understanding of the scriptures and the natural understanding of the scriptures cannot produce God's precepts I will say today friends I wish I had a a grand way to express this it's just what's in my heart it's so simple it's it's hard because it's simple foreign but it really comes down to Absolute obedience to whatever God says never going any further never going short never going left never going right when God lays it out to hit exactly what he says and in that friends we can walk in such confidence that when Satan comes and tempts us we have an anchor that's so strong that were not even affected by it we're not even affected by the things that are going on in the world around us let's sing this little song [Music] that is [Music] [Music] [Music] Lord let's sing that once again [Music] that is [Music] [Music] in the manger foreign can we sing this little song the battle is the Lord's I appreciate appreciate hope that's all right [Music] if there is a source in times [Music] [Music] night alone you're your strength is going strong in your burden the battle is the Lord 's my name all the ways your strength is gone foreign [Music] so remember when the waters rise amazing time is gone foreign [Music] [Music] take her [Music] as they play that just very reverently before the Lord [Music] when the roads you walk when all the things seem just piled up and all the way that life has to offer [Music] those times our God is still an ever-present help in the time of need let us go before the Lord once again in prayer and ask that God will do what no man can do lead us and guide us and do only his perfect will you know the years ago I remember it was said if you pray you know Lord do whatever it takes people would say well be careful when you pray that because you know it could be really hard but you know a friend I encourage you today just tell the Lord Lord whatever it takes my one desire is that when the trumpet sounds I'm standing there with you on the other side when we're called to gather in the air that we're caught up to meet him we if we set any priority of what we desire God said if you're ashamed of me then I'll be ashamed of you let us pray Lord Jesus [Music] there are so many Transitions and Seasons that are coming to an end God as we are here today Lord I realize more and more every day that we cannot do anything without you there's a reason why the Capstone is saying grace Lord Jesus I'll pray that you will have mercy that your grace will overflow in disassembly [Music] Lord we're not worthy in ourselves but Lord Jesus we've set aside our own thoughts and we've taken up your calls Lord we stand clean confident before you that you are doing the mighty work that you claimed that you set out to do Lord we know that you're doing it Lord I pray that you will bless these people mightily bless the Saints Lord as they're struggling sometimes in life Lord I pray that the things that we have looked at today are Lord I've stumbled over my words forgive me [Music] Lord I pray that your people will catch it anyway Lord I pray that you will make the word simple and plain that the children can understand God I pray that you will heal those that are sick pray Lord that you will lead those that are struggling to find direction God I pray that you will help us Lord in the months ahead Satan would love to destroy the work that you have set out to do but God we are trusting in you what I'm trusting in you today I pray Lord Jesus that the testimonies will abound God I pray that you will continue to have your way truly Lord may your word be born in US when the road is hard and it's weary we will remember to walk by your precepts that we would forget not the words that echo in our hearts of how faithful and true and just that you are God I pray that you will have your way this afternoon be with the Saints as they go Lord and tomorrow as we Face the week we Face the work that we have in front of us Lord I pray that you would encourage them then also and bring them through their week thank you Heavenly Father may you be glorified in all things in Jesus name amen [Music] so when the road you
