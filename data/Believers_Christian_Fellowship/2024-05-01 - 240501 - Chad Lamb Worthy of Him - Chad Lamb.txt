work in our hearts and our lives we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all and while we're standing if you can turn to the Book of Matthew thank you musicians Matthew we'll we'll read from uh chapter 10 once we get there I just wanted to remind you in the morning we've got the um Bible Believers Christian School Chapel service in the morning so appreciate your prayers for that and then also uh tomorrow will be heading uh uh up to Southern Michigan with all the young adults we'll be going up there for a weekend getaway and some Ministry we're doing there so we pray uh just ask that you keep all of us in prayer for traveling mercies there and back and and that the Lord will really just speak to us there and bless our time together also brother Benjamin cot will be taking the service here on Sunday so if you could be remembering him in prayer as well that would be wonderful and then also if you could pray for brother Gabe Smith he'll be traveling over to Pittsburgh this Sunday to minister for brother Jean kadeema there and there's been some sickness going through their home so just pray that God will touch them all give them strength and I told him there must be a good service coming cuz a lot of resistance is usually a good sign so we just pray that the Lord will use our brother there mightily then there's one more thing I wanted to let you know that sister Jade Lynn is now in a place that she can receive mail so we took her address and we put it on all the bulletin boards so if you'd like to send her a letter or card she would really love to hear from you and it would be encouraging to her so that all that information is on the bulletin boards and so we we trust that God will bless her amen through US amen before we're seated let's read here in Matthew chapter 10 and we're going to read from verse 37 Matthew 10 and verse 37 he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find iten God bless you as you have your seats may the Lord bless us as we look at his word God bless you brother Paul and sister norgan it's good to have you back with us good to see you there amen we're expecting extra pool tonight from the two of you amen you've been gone for a while so you got to make up for it brother three times is hard amen so I've been meditating on this scripture for a while the Lord just dropped it in my heart and I've been meditating on it and thinking about it and and I and I want to understand it a little bit better so I started looking into it and it was astonishing he says he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me amen and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me and he keeps using this term worthy of me and worthy of me and I started thinking how in the world can we ever be worthy anyways but he's showing here in this scripture that anything that we put above Christ amen will knock us right out of the picture Al together that we can have no love be before his love that we can have no desire above the desire for Christ that if we if we if we love father and mother more than him we're not worthy of him and so then the question now this is the question I have if I love my father and mother less than him am I now worthy of him good question isn't it I think we'll get into that and we'll start answering that amen so so I I don't I don't know why I do this I like to ask questions that Boggle all of us but but as we get through the scripture I think we're going to see a picture emerge or at least I did and I want to I want to share that with you this word Worthy is interesting the word here that says worthy uh it means weighing or having weight having the weight of another a thing like value worth as much so it's something of equal value and and the reason it says having weight or equal weight is because if you refer back to the days of the balance when they would put so much product on one side of the balance and so much weight on the other to figure out what the value would be they would put weight on it or they would put coins or whatever on one side until the value came equal when the came equal in the balance is you know this was as worth as much as this right so that's what the this word is referring to if can we bring up the Whiteboard I'm going to draw a little picture and from for your [Music] amusement so I want to draw this out so we can get a mental picture and then I want to start working with it so if we if we look at a balance I actually practiced this and there'll probably be an engineer or two amongst us says that that's not equal it won't work so if we look at our balance here this is what I'm speaking of Lord okay so when when you put your product your wheat your whatever in one side and then you begin to put the the money or the weight or whatever represents it on the other side you keep adding and adding and adding until it bounces out when it balances out this is as worth as much as this all right so that's what that word means having a like weight or a like value uh a corresponding to a thing they're equal to one another and so now he says if you don't if if you love father and mother more than me you're you're not worthy of me you're not equal to me you're not uh corresponding to me in some way you're not coming to my level yeah and this is interesting so now all of a sudden if I just hate mom and dad now I'm at God's level no that that's not what he's saying so don't don't go down that path please but brother brandham preached another message and he preached a message called is your life worthy of the gospel and he preached it June 30th 1963 and I and I was recently studying that message and here's something that brother bandam says in the opening prayer said Lord Jesus any man physically or woman or child can move back the pages of this Bible Bible but there's no one that can reveal it but you I pray Lord of taking this text as it's placed upon my heart to send out Across the Nation for the people that they might know what type of life is required for them to live what's the subject is your life worthy of the gospel and this worthy of the Gospel has to do with this equal is it of same value as the gospel is it worthy of the gospel and so uh for so many has asked me is the Christian Life a life of church service is it helping the poor the needy or is it a constant member is it loyal is it loyal loyalty to the church and such questions father May the correct answer come tonight through these words as we make an Endeavor to bring them to the people so he wants the people to understand what does it mean to live a Christian Life and he's asking is your life worthy of the Gospel is your life equal to the gospel the good news the message amen there's there a correspondence between your life and the gospel and then he goes to his opening scripture in Luke 14 so if you could turn there with me we'll read this together so when he wants to preach on this subject this is the scripture that he goes to Luke 14 and verse 16 Luke 14 and verse 16 then said he unto me a certain man made a great supper and bade many and sent his servant at supper time saying to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must needs go and see it I pray thee have have me excused and another said I have bought five yolk of oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee have me excused and another said said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come so that that servant came and showed his Lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly unto the streets and Lanes of the city and bring in thither the poor and the maimed and the Halt and the Blind and the servant said Lord it is done as thou Hast commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of those men which were bden shall taste of my supper so this is the opening scripture that he opens with when he wants to preach is your life worthy of the gospel and he tells us that this supper amen is the Feast of the Lord and it's the message of the hour it's the word that God has sent in this hour and it's come to many many were bidden to come to this great feast of the Lord that he's provided in the end time but they made so many excuses and brother V say to starts to say say but my church teaches and and I go here and he starts showing all the excuses that people can have and what is he teaching your is your life worthy of the gospel and now I'm going to go on and read he doesn't read this portion but I'm going to read a couple more verses verse 25 and there went a great multitude with him and he turned and he said unto them if any man come unto me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and Brethren and sisters yay in his own life also he cannot be my disciple amen and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple am so Jesus now tells this story of the of the of the the man making a feast and and bidding those to come and those that were bidden to come they begin to make excuses and and if you look at their excuses they're all so carnal I bought a piece of ground I have Yol of oxen I have married a wife and they had all of these Earthly things that were hindering them from coming to the feast and brother benam saying this is the Feast of the Lord amen this is the the Feast of the wedding this is the king preparing a wedding and he's calling us to the feast amen and there's those that don't value the invitation to the feast more than they value carnal worldly things amen and I tell you this this this Parable is still playing out today because this Feast is still going on right now amen God has has taken the seals off the book He's prepared a seven course meal this is the great wedding Feast amen and he's bidding us to come to the Feast of the Lord and there's so many people that are tied up with work and family and all this other stuff that they're they're not selling out wholesale for this message amen and this is and then Jesus turns after he gives this Parable there went a great multitude with him and he turned and he said unto them if any man come to me and hate not as father and mother and wife and children and Brethren and sisters yay in his own life he cannot be my disciple praise God listen Jesus said it not me like when you read this this is a hard saying when you when some of his disciples walk away say that it's a hard saying this is a hard saying yes because we love our wives we love our children we love our mother we love our fathers we love our sisters we love our brothers but Jesus is saying unless you're willing to forsake all of that for me you're not worthy of me you're not worthy to be my disciple amen and then he goes on says and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple he's he's calling on us to give up our lives to make a complete surrender Amen to give up everything in this world for him Amen in the message is your life worthy of the Gospel I'm going to quote many quotes from that he says now you've either got to say in this that this is God's Will and God's desire or either something else that you can crop up that's better than what this is now you have to take one or the other and you can't serve God in Mamon that's right he says further down but if it's right you owe your life to it what more could you ever find that would be more of a benefit to you than to know that you you can have eternal life it's amazing that they were bidden to the feast and it was a great honor to be invited to this feast and I don't know about you but I feel it's the greatest honor of my life to be invited to this Feast of the message of the hour the word of God Jesus Christ that is now unfolded before his bride I can't think of any greater privilege on this planet amen it's worth forsaking family it's worth forsaking jobs it's worth forsaking all amen but when they were bidden to the feast amen there was some that made excuses and the excuses like I said were the carnality of life amen I've bought a piece of ground I I've got five yolk of oxen I've married a wife and and it angered the man who made the feast it anged angered him and he said they're not worthy of it go find somebody else who wants to come to my feast and and and so I I there's several things that I want to say and want to look at the moment that they made an excuse the moment they made an excuse they declared that they had a love greater than the love for the Lord his son in his Feast that's the truth there's no other way to look at it that's why he was so angry because it was such it was such a privilege to be invited to this Feast of the lord it's such a privilege to come amen but but the thing that they made the excuse about was the thing that they desired more to be than to be part of this Feast they desired the the the land that they bought they desired The Works that they could do they desire the the wife that they could have they desired it more than the privilege to being part of this Feast the sad part is that's still the same truth today there is people that will forsake they will absolutely forsake this invitation to eternal life this invitation to be one with Christ because of family yes sir because of work because of uh because of a wife because of a husband my wife won't believe so I'm holding back my husband won't believe so I'm holding back amen what right how dare we hold back on God how dare we re withhold ourselves from Jesus Christ just because a spouse doesn't want to come along amen that's not what Jesus told us in the scriptures you say that's hard that's hard but that's what our Lord told us amen and he said if you if you take this road you're not worthy of me if you take this road you cannot be my disciple the only way to be my disciple in any way be worthy of me is to forsake everything and take up your cross and follow after me that's the only way amen let's go to Philippians chapter 3 Philippians chapter 3 verse 7 but what things were gained to me those I counted loss for Christ yay doubtless I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith Paul the Apostle knew what it was like to have to forsake everything to give up friendships to give up position to give up status to give up a reputation to give up honor amongst his Brethren he gave it all up so that he could win Christ amen he forsook all and he took up his cross and he followed the Lord and he was a disciple amen and the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother B says but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery but the bride is standing on it that's her stand why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal his sin secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the car of the world you let some Pastor you let somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting hungry it's God trying to reveal it to you see the Revelation the last day is here what is it he's invited you to the feast and there's a tug inside for the feast what is holding us back amen what carnal Earthly thing is holding us back what Earthly love is greater than a love for God Amen amen so let's turn to Colossians chapter 3 together Colossians chapter 3 verse 1 Colossians 3:1 if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is your life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory amen what a tremendous reward eternal life for what for forsaking everything on Earth and turning all my attention on the things of Heaven amen amen is it I mean it's always comes down the the question is always here and and and we have to deal with it because we deal in this this life and we have human affections we have family and we have all kinds of things that tie us to this life but we have to hold all of that secondary to Christ that's right and we have to consciously do that because is it more noble listen is it Noble to compromise on the word because of a love for another human being how is that right how is it right right to to to change the word and manipulate and soften it amen because of a human love for somebody else how is that how does God view that amen we do some of these things to save ourselves and and we we we think we're doing it to save a spouse or to save a child or to save a loved one or to save a friend or a brother or sister amen because we don't want to leave them out and we don't want to but but but the word is the word amen and Christ is Christ and he's worth losing everything for he's worth being alone he's worth being destitute he's worth being rejected over he's worth he's worth [Applause] it and when we when we change the word for the love of a son or a daughter or we change the word for the love of a spouse what we've just declared is I value this relationship more than I value my relationship with Christ and we would never say that because somehow we want to make this Godly like somehow it's Godly to change the word for a son or daughter to help them along it's Godly somehow to change God's requirement for a spouse to help them along but how is it ever Godly to move away from the word when the word is God Amen these are these are hard things but it's the reality this is the word God is looking for a bride that he can have preeminence in not somebody that's on a some sort of halfway 70% % partnership with him that's not what he's looking for in this day he's not looking for another repeat of the church ages he's looking for a bride that's completely sold out to him and will forsake everything for him so now let's come to this issue of worthy because this is a still a question all right let's draw another balance here see I already got it off my dimensions and proportions aren't right but I learned how to use the Eraser so let's go up here and do this again and now let's draw this scale this balance like this now we'll go up here and and we'll go down here okay down here we have Christ and here we have me he's so much more valuable than me how am I going to bring this to a balance he said you're not worthy of you're not corresponding to me is your life worthy or in a correspondence of the Gospel of the the same worth how am I how am I going to balance this scale well you just have to hate your mother and your father there's a lot of people who hate mother and father but they're not balancing the scale so so what's it going to take to balance the scale because because I can't do it I can go up here and and and I can listen I can add joining Church I can add Good Deeds I can put in here fasting praying and I how am I what am I going to put on this side of the balance to bring it balance what can I do what what what works can I do what Deeds can I do what effort can I put forth what in the world can I do to balance this because I want to be worthy of I know that if I put anything before him I'm not worthy of him and and brother benham's asking the question now and is your life worthy of the Gospel he said is your life in correspondence or equal to or worthy the gospel that's been preached in this age and you think no there's nothing in me that's worth this message there's nothing in me that's equal to it in my flesh that is there's nothing that I can do to bring myself equal to this message is So Glorious it is Christ himself so what do I do so we're going to keep going a little further we'll get back to that question cuz it's a good question and the in the message he says we've got to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way we've got to be led by the Lord Jesus Christ if we don't we take an organizational life and a life that doesn't follow Christ daily is not worthy so he's told us all kinds of things that makes us not worthy if we love father and mother more than him we're not worthy if we love wife more than him if we love children more than him we're not worthy if we love our own life more than him we're not worthy if we don't take up our cross and follow him we're not worthy if we don't follow him daily we're not worthy we got a whole pile of not being worthy amen and how many feels the pile piled on you of not worthy amen not worthy not worthy not worthy but a life that doesn't follow Christ daily is not worthy and brother asking the question is your life worthy of the gospel now let's go to [Music] uh yeah let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter 5 all right 1 Corinthians or second Corinthians I'm sorry 2 Corinthians 5:14 For the Love of Christ constrain us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead so if he died for all of us we were all dead do you believe that we were dead spiritually and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but un him which died for them and rose again so this is the key amen he died for all why so that they so that uh I'm sorry so that they which live how should we live we live in Christ so that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again so now I'm dead and my life is hid in Christ I've crucified the flesh with the lust thereof now what has to happen is I have to die so that I can take my cross that I don't love my life more than him and I don't love any part of my life more than him this is so critical because some of these things are so subtle these little hooks that get in us that hold us back from an overcoming life are so subtle they're they're they're they're Family Ties and human affection and and and things that we tied to in the world and and lust of the Flesh and these things that have us tied and bound down amen and and that we don't sometimes realize what they're hindering in our spiritual walk and in our spiritual life and we must realize that there's got to be nothing that even compares or comes close to my love for Christ that if I have to stand alone I have to stand alone if no one will stand with me if that's the price I have to pay then by the grace of God God help me to stand with you before I stand with anything else help me God and so now this is a this is a quote that I want to start laboring on because we've got this balance that's all the way off and I don't know how I'm going to ever become worthy amen I know all the kind of things that make me not worthy there's a whole pile of that make me not worthy amen but what is going to make me worthy what's going to make my life worthy of the Gospel what's going to make me worthy of Christ and he says again in the same message a Christian is not a tool or some kind of mechanical wrench to a great big religious regime that's right a Christian is not some kind of a tool that keeps a religious organization moving a Christian that is not a Christian a Christian is to be Christlike amen and a Christian cannot be a Christian until Christ comes into the man the Life of Christ in him then it produces the life that Christ lived and you do the things that Christ did what am I talking about personal relationship to Christ what is it is your life worthy of the Gospel amen when brother B starts laying this out in your life worthy of the Gospel he starts talking about the way we Act and the way we dress and the compromise on the word and taking our our parents' religion and staying in the denominational system and being attached to the things of the world and not for he goes to all of that to show how many ways we're not worthy of the Gospel but I want to know how am I going to be worthy of the Gospel how am I going to have a life worthy of the Gospel I know all the things I do wrong and I know all the things that will keep me from it but there's got to be something that will measure up and level up my life and there's only one thing I know of because that the these Deeds aren't going to do it of them I can pile them on all day long I can go to church I can pay great M sums of money I can do all kinds of things it's not going to level it up but the only way it's going to level it up if I can get what's over here over here and when that comes in place now all of a sudden we've got Christ over here and we have Christ over here and that'll bring a balance in my life and make my life worthy of the Gospel amen amen hallelujah it's not something I can just put on and do but it's something I surrender to but what's hindering Christ in my life all of these other things that are making me not worthy not taking up my Christ loving my life wanting to try out my yoke of oxen wanting to stay with my field wanting to stay with my family that's all hindering the move of Christ in my life and keeping me off balance praise God but what's it going to to take an absolute complete surrender to the will of God and a laying down of my life completely and taking up my cross and following him so that the life that's on one side of this equation can move to the other side of the equation and bring a balance and now my life can be worthy of the Gospel why because of Good Deeds because of good character because no because Christ in me the hope of glory so if I have to measure up to Christ the word how am I going to measure up the if I don't measure up the Christ the word I'm not measuring the Christ I'm not worthy of Christ amen but to measure up to Christ the word it's going to take Christ the spirit that's right because it's the spirit of the word it's the spirit that comes in and gives me the power to live the word to make me worthy of the Gospel thank you amen Jesus told his disciples when he was departing he said in Luke 24:49 I'll just read it to you and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but T ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen he there was an equation there was something that was going to level this up Amen to make them their make their lives worthy of the Gospel amen because they had all just abandoned him and left him in his hour of need Peter says I'll never forsake you they all forsake you I'm ready to go to prison and even give my life amen and and and then the Bible says and so said all the disciples and a few hours from them they're all running for their life and they've abandoned him Peter's denying him he's cursing and we have all this disaster going on why because their their life cannot measure to the word right but he says T ye in the city of Jerusalem amen don't go out in the ministry don't go try to be a Christian don't go out and try to prove it don't go don't do anything until you're indued with power from on high if you're going to go out and carry the word you need the power of the word to manifest the word so that your life can be worthy of the Gospel amen amen if we don't catch this principle then all of a sudden the only thing we can do is go into legalistic thinking legalistic thinking leaves us completely absolutely void and we have no energy to even live we throw in the towel amen by 9:00 in the morning we've made so many mistakes we throw the tow and we give up I'm never going to get it amen but it's not that amen it's it's it's life worthy of the Gospel amen is a life that surrendered to Christ and by the power of the Holy Ghost is following Christ the word in every way amen is it a perfect life we're not talking about a perfect life we're talking about a surrendered life amen amen to be worthy of the Gospel doesn't mean I live a perfect life amen it doesn't mean I never have a fault I never have a mistake Peter certainly did even after the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen it's not that it's not Perfection that we're looking for it's having the perfect one inside leading in guiding and staying surrendered to that leadership the when when he says whoa that was wrong you go back and repent and you make it right amen you may go wrong but you've got you've got the equalizer on the inside to make make your life worthy of the Gospel Amen brother bam says I'm stilling the message is your life worthy of the Gospel when this takes place the thing you'll do then you'll find out that the spirit that comes in you from the New Birth you will believe and do everything that God says in his word is for you to do amen and everything that the Bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it with amen and you'll not stop day or night until you receive it that's right that's right and in all this time you'll certainly above everything bear the fruit of the spirit amen the spirit that comes into you from the New Birth it will believe and do everything God says in his word for you to doise God Amen that's what we need to have a life worthy of the Gospel without the spirit of God we're never moving the scale the balance can't budge I can't get it right I can't overcome my own flesh I I I I I can't have the boldness to stand on the word I keep what do I need I need the indwelling of Christ I need the one that gives me the power to say Amen to the word I need the one that gives me the power to deny my flesh and take the word I need the one that gives me the power in the face of opposition from the ones I love the most and something in me still gives me the power to say I'm sorry sorry I know that you're hurt and I know that you don't believe this and I know that you don't trust me and I know that you're upset with me but I have to go the way of the word I love you but I have no choice but to follow after Christ and take my cross and follow him daily I have no option I have to amen because there's a life inside of me pushing me to the word this isn't willpower if it was willpower we would have all crashed and and some of us have crashed but it was the spirit of God who picked us back up amen praise be to God aren't you so glad that when God had a requirement he had a way to meet the requirement when brother bam said is your life worthy of the Gospel I'm so glad he didn't start with the title because as soon as he said the title I say no cuz I'm looking at Flash and I'm looking at myself in the mirror and I'm looking at all my abilities and I'm not worthy of this gospel I'm not not worthy to be bid to the marriage supper I'm not worthy of the invitation I've got I'm not worthy to have a seat at the table I'm not worthy of any of that but he made me worthy amen he brought an equalization to me I was in the dumps I was distraught I was cast to the side in the junk heap of the of the rubble of life amen but he came and he paid a price and shed his blood for me to bring the balance back up so that he could put his life into me and make me worthy of the Gospel not because my efforts made me worthy yes sir because he made me worthy you know brother B's talking about in all of this he's talking about staying with your denomination he's talking about staying with the love of the world he's talking about uh having short hair and wearing makeup and and you think your life's worthy of the Gospel what he's not saying that if you stop wearing makeup you'll become worthy it's not what he's saying what he's saying is as long as you're rejecting the word there's no way you'll ever be worthy right because you need the person of the word to come in you need to be born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you need the indwelling of the power you need to be endued with power from on high so that you can say no to the flesh you can say no to the Temptation you can't do it on your own right it takes the spirit of God to bring the balance amen I so thank God the Apostle Paul was going the wrong way and all of his wisdom and all of his efforts and all of it and everything he had Zeal he had Zeal for God he had a desire to do things right but he was doing everything wrong until God come injected himself in his path amen and he filled him with the spirit amen and then what happened amen he made Paul worthy of the Gospel he made his life worthy of the Gospel why because he turned from a persecutor of the of the truth the one who was stand for the truth one who was rejecting it the one who believed it and taught it and gave his life for it how did that happen that wasn't the man that was God in the man amen Peter the disciples none of them could be worthy of the Gospel they needed Christ they needed Christ to tip the scale in their favor God's required for me to follow him above everything else and he's and he's required me to keep his word and obey his word then he's going to have to supply something to me because if that's his requirement I and myself can't meet that requirement so he's going to have to supply something to me to give me the power to meet the requirements amen I don't believe Jesus Christ wants a bride who's a compromiser no sir no do you no do you think Christ wants a bride who will take human relationships over their relationship to him I don't believe that sir well if if he wants a pure bride if he wants one that's sold out for him if he wants one that that'll leave all the Earthly things for him and be totally dedicated to him then he needs somebody that he can fill with his Spirit to give them the power to be the bride that he's called to be in this hour amen and so what has he done he supplied the spirit amen he he you know the Holy Ghost has been bound by these denominational Rivers for nearly 2,000 years why because they were held the the the fullness of the Holy Ghost was held back by wrong teaching and wrong understanding but in the end time amen and the end time message the Holy Ghost has come back and the fullness of the word has brought the fullness of the spirit which brings the fullness of the power to live the full word of God it is available today so that he can have a bride amen that won't be a compromising bride Why by his power by his Spirit that's why he's done what he's done in this day that's why he took the seals off the book that's why he he he moved the obscurity away and gave his eyes to see and ears to hear so that we can be what he's called us to be in this hour amen I was reading through this uh is your life worthy of the gospel and I came across this story brother Benham tells and he's talking about we've talked about it many times but he's talking about standing by the side of the bed when his little baby's dying and he talks about it's the darkest hour he ever had he prayed to God and like a black sheet come down God wouldn't hear his answer and then the devil starts speaking to him and this is where I'm going to pick it up he says then I begin to listen to him that's reasoning I thought that's right the devil was telling him God could easily change this situation but he's not and brother saying that's reasoning that was right God could change it but he wasn't he said and what have you done a young man and all your friends consider you a crank and you've been rejected and and you stay out preaching all night you sleep a few hours you get up and go to work the next day and this is how he repays you and brother vom somewhere else says and all that he was saying was true but I want you to catch what he said he said said he can tell he don't have to speak the word just look to your baby and it would live I said that's right and as much as you've done for him and yet that's what he does for you I said said that's right I begin to think well what see everything begin to break away when it come to reasonings the devil was reasoning in his mind and he was beginning to break but when it come to that that hung it stayed there I was just about ready to say then I'll quit but when I got down to all the reasoning Powers had broke away then it come to that eternal life that new birth what if it hadn't have been there what if it hadn't have been there and he says what if it what if it hadn't have we would have know we wouldn't have known one another the way we do now this church would not have been here like this and the thousands of millions around the world but thank God it was there then I thought what who am I anyhow who am I to question his majesty who am I to question the Creator that give me my very life here on Earth where did I get that baby who give it to me not mine anyhow he just loaned her to me for a while I said Satan get away from me I went over laid my hand on the baby I said God bless you sweetheart in a minute daddy will take you down put you on mommy's arms the angels will pack your little soul away and I'll meet you in that morning and I said Lord you give her to me you're taking her away though you slay me like job said yet I love you and believe you if you send me to hell I'll love you anyhow now I can't get away from that there you are just an intellectual it all broke away but you got to have personal relationship you've got to be born again what's he preaching is your life worthy of the Gospel he comes to his hardest test and if it was not for the Holy Ghost in his soul he would have failed the test he would have forsaken God he would have took the reasoning he would have went the intellectual Road and he would have quit the ministry and quit on God is that what the prophet told us but what happened what happened to him you know what was happening he was loving his wife and he was loving his daughter so much that he wasn't feeling the love of God Amen and the reasoning started to work because of his love for a wife and because of his love for a daughter and the reason he began to work and say God don't love you said when he got so far that was far enough and he knew that was wrong what was it that held it was that New Birth that held What What In His hour of Temptation kept him amen from giving in to the love for a child and the love for a spouse it wasn't that he didn't love his little girl it wasn't that he didn't love his wife but what happened is he realized he loved God more you've given her you take her away blessed be the the name of the Lord you know what that means I love you the most what held just I I can't express it enough what held this man in this hour was not his willpower was not his mind was not the only thing that held him was Christ on the inside the only thing that made him in his hour of Temptation worthy of the Gospel what was the worthy of the Gospel worthy of the gospel meant he was able to surrender to the will and to the word of God what made him able to surrender to God's Will and subject himself to God that way the only thing that made it possible was Christ Living on the inside cuz he was a seed of God he was part of the word he could not leave the word listen I'm glad I've never faced this test and I hope to God I never do I hope you never do but I've had some hard tests I've had some tests that took me to the point of breaking I've had some tests where family said they wouldn't go the way I'm going I don't even know how I made it I can't tell you I mean I know how but in myself I have no idea how I made it we went through such a struggle when we first came to this message I believed before my wife believed and we had just had a baby and and and Blake was only 6 weeks old and I had been hearing about the message and believing it and feeding on it was stirring in my heart and brother Jeremy invited me to come up to church in the old sanctuary and and Angie's parents were pulling on her to leave me to come back home because they thought this was a cult and they thought it was men dominating women and there was all kinds of evil things being whispered in her ear she had just delivered baby she had only been married a year her parents were telling her this is a cult her husband and her mind is losing his mind amen and she's losing her mind and I'm losing my mind one of the hardest Trials of my life amen but I I knew I had to come see if this is the truth something was stirring in my heart and I believed the word and I was believing the message and I had to come see and something was pulling me amen and we come to the moment we come to the hour amen Jeremy pulled up outside and I was going out the door and when I was going out the door my wife looked at me and said I cannot believe that you're leaving us I can't believe you're leaving me to go to those people yes she's holding a six- week old baby sitting on the couch crying praise God praise God I looked at her and I said I love you but I have to go I have to go see if this is the truth amen she looked at me and she said I may not be here when you get back am and I knew her parents were trying to pull her back home may not be here when you get back that was a long drive to Lia from Lebanon Ohio but I come to the service the service was amazing I heard the word preached I heard it preached in its Purity my heart was soaring because I finally was connecting with the reality that was inside of me then I had to get back in that car sister Carol's Jeep I had to get back in that car and take that 2-hour trip home the closer I got to home the quieter I got because I didn't know if she would be there or not listen I don't know how I made it yes I don't know how I walked out the door I have no idea how I closed it behind me me myself imagining back to the day I have no idea how I did that but it wasn't me there was another Power pulling me he was pulling a Son of God back to the word back to where I came from there was a magnetism that was beyond Humanity amen it was God what was he doing he was tipping the scale for me because I didn't have the power in myself thank amen amen how are we going to make it how are we going to face it when we come to our hours of decision and our times of loss and our times of separation and Hey listen there's separation all the time people are always coming and people are always going people are always believing the message and people are always stop believing the message and those you're friends with now they may not believe 5 10 years from now amen what's going to hold you in that hour what is going to hold you is it going to be your willpower your good teaching because you read the message no it's got to be something on the inside there's got to be a power you have to be endued with power from on high or we'll never make it friends there's our human side is too weak amen our natural affections are so strong sometimes but there's got to be a greater love above all other lovees have no idea I have no idea how I got from a 21-year-old boy ignorant and doesn't know anything and went through that I have no idea I got from there to here but I'll tell you one thing it wasn't my strength my power my ability amen it was nothing more than the life of Jesus Christ coming into me cuz I could not have done it on my own and you couldn't be sitting in the seat you're sitting in if it wasn't for the power of God and if we stay connected to this word and we stay following him it's because we forsaken all other and take taken him and his life has come in to tip the scale there's no other way friends human affection will eventually wear out the reasoning will eventually win the day we've watched it happen over and over and over again it's going to take a greater power you know what I think we should do I think we should wait in Jerusalem till were endued with power from on high I think we should seek the baptism of Holy Ghost and The Life of Christ to give us the power to live this word or we're not going to make it Jesus said in the Garden of Gethsemane father if it if thou be willing remove this cup for me nevertheless not my will but thine be done yes sir you know that's almost the same thing that brother brandham said standing at the bedside of his daughter that's right who was that Christ that was Christ and our brother that was that seed that taken over in the hour of crisis when it was beyond man when it was beyond human that seed took over that's right he said the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord back in the message is your life worthy he says he was full of Faith why he knowed his words couldn't fail he so lived by the word till he became the word oh God let me hold both my hands to God before this audience let me live like that let his word so become that me and his word is the same thing Let My Words Be his words let the meditation of my heart let him be my let let him be in my my heart on my mind tie his Commandments about the post of my intelligence tie them about the post of my heart let me just see him when Temptation Rises let me see Christ when things go wrong let me just see him when I get uh when I get ready and the enemy try to make me get angry let me see Jesus what would he do he was so much in the word till him and the word became the self-same thing why why because the spirit of the word comes into us to help us live the word we can't do it any other way amen he goes on in the message what shall I do with this Jesus called Christ God's body United as as his bride being one him and Christ together is the spirit working in the flesh of the church like it worked in the flesh of Jesus Christ because it's part of his body not Tain but one they are one a husband and wife is no longer two but one and Christ is his body body is one and the Same Spirit was in Christ is in his bride in his body that unites them together with all the word and God living in there himself manifesting it prise God what is that that is him making me worthy of the Gospel amen that is him making my life match his word glory to God because brother benam when he says your life worthy of the Gospel he starts showing how far off the word many lives are and he's saying is your life worthy of the gospel and he's not saying hey just just start doing right he's he's wanting people to recognize I don't have what it takes I'm falling short I'm way shorter than I need to be what do I need to do we need a wakeup call sometimes because what we need is the reality inside of us amen not group consensus not group strength we need an individual personal relationship with Christ Alone where when we're all by ourselves Christ gives us the strength in the hour of Temptation that's beyond human amen brother brandom didn't have his whole church there when he was standing by his baby's bedside he didn't have the support group he didn't have a text line he didn't have a prayer chain going on what he had was the indwelling of the spirit of God a seat of God and the power of God to give him power when he had no more power to give him strength when he had no more strength so that he could stay with the word of God and love Christ more than he loved anything else if you you love mother or father more than me you're not worthy of me if you love yourself more than me you're not worthy of me if you love your wife if you love your children more than me you're not worthy of me amen it's better just to say God make me worthy make me worthy of you Lord I I admit I'm weak in my flesh I I keep getting tripped up I don't seem to have the power to take the stand I need to take against my family I don't have the power the boldness to move out in your word I keep falling back I don't have the power in the hour of Temptation when I'm all alone Amen to resist the devil God make me worthy please come and make me worthy come and do something in me that I cannot do myself endue me with power from on high amen so that you can make me worthy of the Gospel thank you Lord God I said before I hope I never have to face a trial like brother Benham faced but we've all faced trials right we've all had separations and am but he who brought me through the last one is the same power I'm depending on to bring me through the next one the one that helped me overcome the first time yes when it was impossible is the same one that will help me overcome next time when it's impossible how is it the bride's going to stand on that word and take that glorious stand I tell you how she's going to do it it's going to be Christ living through her it's not going to be her and her human strength it's going to be Christ in her manifesting his own word what's it going to take it's going to take a surrendered life what's our portion in this what's our part trying harder heaping stuff on our side of the basket to try to listen we've tried all that I don't know how long you've been around but you've tried being a good boy and doing nice things and paying extra in the tithe and sending the missions and move the scale and you realize it doesn't work what am I supposed to do stop trying and surrender so God I give it if I lose my job so be it amen if I lose my family so be it if I lose my house if I lose my reputation so be it so be it am I remember I was reading the biography of uh uh Charles Spurgeon and Charles Spurgeon brother B said he was a great preacher back in the 1800s and and he was preaching the gospel and he had he had predestination down pat in his day and and he was preaching and they didn't like that that he was having such crowds and the and the paper started making fun of him other religious leaders started making fun of him they started slandering his name they started making little cartoons of him in the in the newspapers and it destroyed him he went into deep depression amen because he couldn't believe the things they were saying about him and then he he got alone with God and he and it I believe this was an excerpt from his diary from his journal and he said Lord Lord the only thing that I have in this world is my reputation but Lord if you want to take that I give it to you in the name of the Lord and when he surrendered he overcame that whole battle came out of depression amen come back to the front line preach predestination preach justification preach the truth of the word for that day and preach it like nobody else could what did he have to do first he had to surrender and die to himself if you love yourself more than me you have no part with me praise God wouldn't it be wonderful if we could say that my word and God's word is the same what I say he honors it because I do nothing until he tells me first it's what Jesus said I only do that which the father showeth me brother B you know in the in the in the message from the angel and pick up your pen and write that's what he tells us the bride is coming to yeah where she has his word and his word alone and she has thus say at the Lord or she keeps still that's right she's coming to the place where she only says and does what's in the word and what God tells her to do amen she's coming to the place where you can say my word and God's word is the same what I say he honors because I do nothing till he tells me first oh there is your example there is a life worthy of the Gospel how do you get there surrender through surrender let's turn to Hebrews 11 and I want to read this last scripture as we close Hebrews 11 11 and 32 and what shall I more say for time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack of Samson and jeffa of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scorings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were saw asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect when you look at this chapter The Heroes of Faith you know these were all the seed of God and they all had to forsake forsake lands forsake reputation be outcast be mocked be scourged be chased they went through all of these things but you know what the world wasn't worthy of them they were the children of God and they all lived their Day message each one of them surrendered to the message and Liv their message sir every one of them they what God told Abraham he lived it what God told David he lived it they lived their message and they lived their day and they suffered rejection separation and everything for it and what carried them through nothing more than a seed they didn't even have the indwelling of the Holy Ghost they had the holy ghost that could come on them but not in them they were empowered by God and moved by God but they had a seed inside of them to live out the word for their day and they became the word amen and now these having attained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect perfect brother BM said they're waiting on us that's right now look at the next verse wherefore because they're waiting on us wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight in the Sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God let us run with patience our portion of the race yes sir they surrendered let us surrender they gave up let us give up Let's Just Surrender Just Surrender say God come and finish the work you left for this day amen in me amen Lord you've ordained me for it but I can't do it is your life worthy of the Gospel if you look at the flesh I say no but if you look at the seed and the quickening power of God that's quickened the seed I say yes With God all things are possible praise God Amen let's all Stand Together amen musicians if you'll come and brother Ben let's just bow our heads and pray together dear Lord Jesus we're so thankful God that in this hour that we live in Lord it's an extreme Age extreme Darkness extreme perversion extreme in every way but God you've also done something extreme in this day you've taken the seals off of your book you've given us the full revelation of the mystery that was in the back part of your mind and God when your Prophet came to tell us this great mystery he said there was one desire you had one thing that you wanted to achieve one goal that you've had and all the Bible speaking of this one goal and it comes forth in a three-fold manner first you wanted preeminence in a man and you accomplish that in Christ Jesus but the second part is you want preeminence in the people and Lord you're doing that right now Lord God that you might display yourself in Bride form that you might come into the lives of individual human beings and you might make us worthy of the Gospel that you might live the gospel through US Lord and God I'm I want to surrender myself aresh to you Lord Lord and ask that you would help me God help me to overcome myself help me to surrender myself and every other thing that's carnal and Earthly Lord even my human affections Lord let me surrender all of them for you and help me not to put anything above you help me to die to myself my desires my preferences God when your Prophet stood by the side of the bed of his dying baby he died to himself God help me help me God by the power of your spirit to surrender myself to you help me God to take every other affection and desire and cast it down so that you might take preeminence in my life God help me not to enthrone any other desire above your throne no desire for a promotion no desire for a job or money or property no desire for Praise of men no desire for human affection God let me take no desire and put it above my desire for you God without your help we can do nothing but we're standing here Lord with our hands in the air saying come to me oh God Wash Me by the water of your word Purge me Lord help me to surrender myself to you more than I ever have before Oh that you might come and fill me more full than I've ever been of your spirit and power may you live your life through me speak your words through my lips manifest your word through my hands and my feet and my eyes and my mouth for god without you I can do nothing but with you all things are possible help me to surrender Lord and be pliable in your hands that you might take me and mold me into your very image and may you display your gospel through this Tabernacle of clay as I surrender to you I ask it in Jesus Christ's name bless your people Lord help us all godone help us to die in ways that we haven't died yet Lord help us to surrender those areas we haven't surrendered yet for God we all walk an Earthly life and we all have affections and desires but God we have to take up our cross daily help help us Lord today and tomorrow and the next day to take up our cross and crucify our flesh once again so that every desire comes subject to you God we need your help we need your spirit we need your power to come and Manifest this word Lord we're so thankful you've promised it and you've provided it now you're just looking for us to receive it and I receive it in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ according to the promise in your word may your spirit envelop me fill me take me under your control I don't want to live my own life anymore I want to live your life oh there's pleasures and desires Lord I want them all to fail in comparison to my desire for you God May everything else fall at your feet every desire every want every love may it fall at your feet and worship you and may you be Lord of all I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you know that picture of the scales I'm here Christ so outweighs me I can never can never bring it equal but if I can just keep emptying out and more of him can come in bring it a little more then he reveals a little more that I need to die to and maybe I can get that kicked off the scale and that he can fill that void and maybe it'll come a little more equal and a little more equal and a little more equal until we as his people come into that image he had of us before the foundation the world and our lives become worthy equal to in comparison as as same value in comparison to the gospel may God do it by his power and may we surrender and yield to it with everything that's in us we ask it in Jesus name God bless you brother Ben oh Jesus I Sur all Jesus I surrender all [Music] Jesus life Sur all the kingom of my home oh Jesus I Sur all [Applause] Jesus God surender Jesus I Sur all the kingom com
