today we just want to say lord jesus i love you i love you for who you are i love you for your handiwork i love you for your saving grace i love you for your mercies lord that you have poured out above and beyond all of my imagination lord there are no words that can touch that but god i pray that you will hear our hearts today that we might worship you and praise you with a pure heart that you might be pleased you might dwell in our praises and god that you might come and minister to us today certainly there is nothing that i can do for any individual here but god you're a mighty conqueror today you're the same one that spoke in the earth was formed the heavens and the earth were created [Music] you're that same god today here we are your creation lord we ask that you'll have your way in jesus name amen praise the lord jesus i greet you all in the name of the lord it's wonderful to be with you again time goes on so quickly and there has been much that's been happening in life around the world and of course with those that we know many have been laid to rest here recently and not just here in this area but around the world there are many saints that have been passing on but you know it's just a few moments until we have to have fellowship with them again it's not long friends be at peace in your heart that the god that you have served all the way up to this point knows what he is doing he has not left you he has not forsaken you and in the moments where you feel like your heart is just rent into just look to him he is still a comforter today he said i must go so the comforter will come he's still that comforter today we're going to take a little thought today and if you would turn in your bibles to matthew the seventh chapter we'll just read some verses here and then have you be seated praise the lord jesus in matthew the seventh chapter we will read verses 14 through 17. matthew 7 verses 14 through 17 because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves or ravening wolves you shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit and let's read verse number 18 as well a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit may the lord bless the word and you may have your seeds and if you don't mind you can turn down my monitors i really don't like to hear myself praise the lord it's good to be together in the house of the lord today you know as as we just mentioned uh and you can actually go ahead and turn them off my monitors up here um thank you very much there's many things that have been going on in the world today um and as we as situations are changing we are looking to understand the change of season what has god asked us for a year ago we looked back two three years ago of course situations have trained changed dramatically but as we said here today the one thing that troubles all of us many times as we are walking with the lord it is not it is not the the general direction if we've committed our hearts to the lord it's not a general direction that we question many times it is how do we take the word of god and apply it to our lives today we need answers today we need a gospel of good news that is applicable today that i might change the direction that i'm walking that i might walk in in a greater fullness of life each day to not stay stagnant to not be in one place but to continuously ever growing closer to the lord jesus does anyone have that prayer today if you want a greater dedication that means there is a greater dedication to be had there is a growing that we are growing too and in the moment when the harvest is full god calls calls in the harvest it's time to go home we're growing and god is maturing he has elect his children that are in the world he's allowing all of these challenges to come our way that we might grow up in him that we might know that the age that we're living in there is such a fine line we cannot be to the right we cannot be to the left there is a razor's edge that is right down the middle does anyone feel that you feel that in your heart that the the criteria the what is being required continues to go up and the difference between this side and that side grow closer and closer and closer we're going to by god's grace look at one element of this picture today this is an age-old discussion and many times a debate unfortunately but there are many thoughts that people have about how do i get closer to god and what is what does it look like what does it feel like what is the experience when i get closer to god when i go to pray what is my expectation when i go to a church service what is my expectation and things friends the thing that you're going to receive is your expectation so if you don't know what to expect what do you think you will receive you see as a child a child does not know what to to receive they don't know what to expect they are living by the hand that is feeding them but as a child is growing there comes an increase of responsibility where the child even as they grow do you want this food or do you want that food do you want to do this or do you want to do that small decisions are being put in front of the child that they might learn responsibility make decisions and buy it are learning to make better decisions but when we as adults are caught in the middle of not knowing where to stand the bible says that a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways and let's apply that to us today if we come to a service and we don't know what the expectation is we are double-minded because we don't know if the expectation is this side or it's this side you know we we have all asked ourselves at some point the question especially as a minister as i stand here today i have to ask myself what is my expectation i look at i listen to the message i'm listening what brother branham is is preaching and he gets to the end and he's there's a discernment that is moving and i know i don't have that office i don't have that gift and i look at that and say lord how can i compare myself to that it poses a question because we say what is our expectation because we we are not another person i don't have the gifts of not only brother branham but i don't have the gifts of the other brothers that are ministering brothers that are here today i don't have your gift and you don't have mine we cannot expect the same as another individual because we are different parts of the same body [Music] if you have if you look inside of a watch there's all these intricate little gears you look inside of a car there's these gears that that you put it in gear and it takes the power from the motor and it transmits the power from the motor to the wheels well the holy spirit is in the church and all the moving pieces of the church are supposed to be moving together and you might have a big cog you might have a big gear and then you might have a little gear and they're both required get even a little bit more mechanical that big gear will get you going down the highway it'll get you going moving at high speed but when you've got an obstacle to go over you know what you have to do you have to downshift you've got to get a smaller gear well thank god i'm not a smaller gear you need that gear we need that gear we need every single part of the body we cannot argue it we can't get away from it because it's god's design and when we know exactly where we fit we know exactly what our expectation is and we're not double minded things start to click into gear and when things click into gear the power starts to get to the wheels [Music] we don't have to get out and push god already designed it perfectly but the problem is this satan cannot take from you the power that god gave you but he can make you think you have what you don't he can give you something that looks so genuine that when you compare the two on face value they are identical so close it would deceive the very elect if if it were possible but friends on face value they're identical well brother there's got to be some difference no on face value they're identical we're going to by god's grace pull this apart a little bit today one one aspect we could take many many months going through this subject by the grace of god the lord it will just help us to hit some high points today as i believe i've said here before that i used to always question why brother ram said i can only hit the high points i can only hit the high points well brother branham you've got two hours you've got three hours but when you look at god's word when you look at your lifetime we can only hit the high points we don't have enough time in this life to go through every detail but we're praying by the grace of god that god allows us to catch what is critical that we're not double-minded that we're so stable where god places us that when the devil begins to buff it our roots are deep enough that we're not moved now you might begin to sway but your roots oh i've heard this before and it's a wonderful picture to just share it for a moment for these very large trees the winds begin to blow and the tree begins to sway and the roots are so deep they're really holding on but what happens is it starts to slightly loosen those roots and it starts to create a little bit of space and you know what happens the roots go even deeper this is why god allows us to be buffeted so that we get we get so comfortable sometimes in our position and god wants us to be shaken so that the roots that we already have begin to grow and dig down even further when the storm begins to blow and all the little trees that have no roots are pushed this way and they're pushed over that way you can stand there in the middle of a hurricane and just wave your arms and say blessed be the name of the lord god is my conqueror god is my victory how can you stand there and say that but i'm drawing from something you don't see i'm drawing from something that's so deep down in there i can't give it to you have to get it for yourself so by the grace of god let's look at this little subject today a secret closet and understanding emotion this is an age-old discussion about emotion is there emotion is there not emotion and you know i love to take things brother the god gave us a prophet for a reason i don't want to make something up i want to see what the prophet said about it i don't want to put my imagination to it i just want to see what the prophet said well the prophet said that it must be that oh and let me touch on this just for a moment again an age-old well brother brandon made this mistake or made that mistake you know friends he might mix up some detail at some point and i would make this distinction the world is all about my truth my truth my truth jesus said i am the way the truth there is no other there's only one truth and what they're really arguing about is the facts you and i might look at one event you might see that one set of facts i might see one set of facts we might testify and somewhere in the middle is the truth and everyone is testifying about what they believe is this and they believe that but but god has sent something so balanced so perfect so beautiful right in the middle of all of it and even if the prophet of god might say something that is out of some detail maybe misquote a scripture the fact itself if you're looking at that you might say well i don't see how this compares and of course we would always i would always encourage you be extremely reverent when you say that because what the prophet's looking at might be different from what you're seeing he might have something that he's looking at this we simply don't see but the truth is he's a man he's not jesus christ himself in the flesh but he is but now he gets so close right is it is it not is it is it not but the the fact is friend it's even difficult to say it that way the fact might be slightly different than what we expect but the truth never changes you're not going to walk away from something that the prophet preached and said well i don't know about that message i mean some people may but if you're a child of god you can't because you're hearing there's something between the words there's something between all the little details as we're just saying brother randomly say i can only hit the high points i can only hit the high points then how are we going to get the details you got to go talk to the author i love with the way that brother adam said it someone was challenging him on his bible he says you don't even know your bible he said yes but i maybe not but i know the author really well friends do you want to know the author today because we can memorize the whole bible all of the scripture and all the quotes we can have all of that and that's not a bad thing but it must come alive you must be talking to the author because the only way you understand what ezekiel was saying isaiah was saying is that you have to be talking to the same inspiration that they were talking to the only way you understand what brother branham was preaching about is to be talking to the same author that brother branham was preaching about [Music] praise god we want such perfect balance perfect balance and we want to be so confident in that balance that we cannot be swayed not by life not by death not by trial not by blessings well how can you be challenged by blessings oh brothers sisters it's the hardest time to serve god with your whole heart when everything's going really easy you don't have any pressure there's no pressure on you oh praise the lord i can slack off a little bit today but when we realize that the time is short we only have a few more minutes to serve almighty god who gave his life for us there's an urgency within us as brother batteries gets to 50 years old he says boy you better do something for the lord because their time is running out he's had 50 years he's won a million souls he said i should have been 2 million lord jesus what am i doing what are we doing if we're standing on the promises if we're standing on the word of god if we're living in the mystery of god as we believe that we are then something has to be different from the world i love the way it's heard a brother say this in the last couple days he says there must be action god always brings action god always brings life we've read here in matthew 7 we're going to we're going to take a few terms today a few terminologies and and give them a definition and this definition is not from these definitions are not from uh the dictionary these definitions are from the things that brother branham has described we want to understand them in a certain way in a certain light based on what was going on through brother branham's ministry and what's going on today we're going to use again just a couple of these words let's take a look oh there we go legalism living a law instead of grace legalism it has to be this way it has to be that way it has to be this way pentecostalism this is an interesting one pursuing gifts of god as the objective not the giver the gift emotionalism pursuing emotion as the objective give all of these things put it let us put it today in the light of what is the objective as the prophet taught us to do where what is your goal what is your objective what are you looking to obtain where are you looking to go fanaticism my motion is my direction emotion is not even the the destination emotion is the driver emotion is the thing that you're moving by that is fanaticism there is no check there is no word check there is no aligning with what we have been taught there is no aligning with god's word i feel it therefore it is i feel that god spoke to me therefore god spoke to me and i need to question nothing brother branham talked about a rushing mighty wind he said brother he describes the situation he gives this example he says brother a rushing mighty wind struck me in the face and he said the first thing i would do is ask where that rushing mighty wind came from but brother it's so great it's so spiritual maybe it is but maybe it isn't do you see friends how we can get an unsure footing very quickly this is not for children spiritual children children are moving by the things that are in front of them they're moving by the situation they're moving by the direction of their parents by the grace of god but as we begin to grow up in the lord it's easy for us to move by this this thing or that thing or this thing or that thing and we think it is god but the age that we're living in now we're not called to have some variation of what god has given us not some watered-down alternative but the true pure simple word of god living in us so how can we do that how do we know that this aligns with this and that this oh lord i know for a fact that i'm standing exactly where you have placed me to be because when we are in that place let me give you an example of it one time there was a little boy and this little boy had been out tenting the sheep and there was a lion that came we've looked at this example before we're all very familiar with this there was a little boy and a lion that came and he grabbed it by the beard and he slew it that's not physically possible but it happened but why did it happen because david had a confidence in something when he walked out on the field with goliath he said this is what's going to take place there was a confidence that that david stood in a place and he said this is where god placed me i'm not questioning it i'm not wishy-washy i know that god placed me right here and i will not move for anyone no matter how big the giant may be the measurement doesn't matter the facts don't matter because the truth is beyond that the truth is beyond his strength it's beyond his weapons and the devil wants you to believe that his weapons are so superior to you or who are you little person but when you know where you're standing at a little humble child of god and you stand before your goliath and you say this is what will take place well are you sure convince me i can't convince you it's not for me to convince you it's for god to know to tell me to give me a revelation that i'm standing exactly where god placed me and in this place the only way that you will be convinced is to watch well david's just running his mouth again these these these believers of this end time message they just think they're so holy there's got to be some time where they slip up it's not that we never make mistakes is it we do god doesn't but we do but whose testimony do we hold is it ours no we hold the testimony of jesus christ if your testimony truly is not your own god will keep your testimony god will make your testimony what he desires it to be you cannot hold it david could not hold his own testimony he just showed up i like to say it this way he showed up we showed up today and we let god drive a lot of driving analogies today i suppose but we want god to be driving i'm here lord i'm a vessel i'm a vessel i can't fill myself i can't feel myself and i can't pour myself out i show up lord you do as you will brother you're saying aye i mean of course us in general not just this person here you know the beautiful thing about god's order a service like this this is not about just a person speaking behind a desk talking from behind a desk this is about you personally whatever you need from god you ever stop and just consider that for a moment you mean i can sit here in an audience and god can speak to me directly yes that's the truth fanaticism my emotion is my direction this is a terminology from modern law and business it's called a bait and switch it's when you're sold one thing but you receive something else and this has been satan's trick from the beginning he sold to eve one thing but she got another she did not understand the value of what she was giving up and she did not understand the value of what she was receiving there was something that was pitched to her or there was a sales pitch that was given to her and she took it there was a bait but then behind the scenes there is a switch you know i told them i'm going to give them this but really i'm going to give them this generic knockoff you know brother i need something from the lord you come sincerely and you begin to pray the devil wants to convince you at every single moment that you've already received what you're after he wants you to feel like you already have it feel like you already have it and if god gave it to you then his mission is to convince you that you don't have it it's like someone who is they're they're they're desiring to walk with the lord and and the devil's fighting them fight him oh you can never be a christian you'll never be a christian you can never do that you're never going to live up to that expectation it's repeated repeated repeated trying to beat them down beat them down beat them down and as soon as god begins to work in your life you know what he's going to do you're the best christian that's ever lived do you know how spiritual where you really are you are so s look around you look around you are more spiritual than everyone that's what the devil does if he can't get you on this side he's going to try to get you on this side and if you're going that way he's just going to try to help you along if you're in a ditch trying to get out of the other ditch he's not going to fight you to stay in that ditch he's just going to try to push you across the road now you're in the other ditch this is the constant challenge that god has laid before us we start walking with the lord and and satan wants to push us this way or push us that way abate and switch so let's summarize just for a moment legalism living a law instead of grace pentecostalism pursuing gifts as the objective emotionalism pursuing emotion as the objective fanaticism my my emotion is my direction an abated switch sold one thing but received something else now let's see what brother random says about this now this is this is interesting because a lot of these questions or discussion questions or discussion will revolve around uh well it was at this time through the 1950s it was this way and afterwards it was this way are there a lot of things that change after the opening of the seals you better believe it but there was something fundamental that brother branham was fighting long before that there was something that was taking place in the religious community in the religious world and there was a move there was a shift things had begun at azusa street where god had had instilled a revival in humanity and something was sparked that that revival was not about emotion that revival was about the restoration of the gifts the restoration of the holy spirit this is what the prophet taught us and i would love to go through every quote where brother branham referred to these things friends there's hundreds and hundreds brother branham talks about this all the time if we will listen and pay attention to those details but see there god is doing something here to revive in azusa street and if i recall correctly it took about three years after azusa street for the upc or the united pentecostal church to be created i don't know if it was called the upc at that time but there was a denomination that was formed around the movement from azusa street three years does that mean make the azusa street revival wrong no it does not what man has always done remember that satan is not a creator he cannot create all he can do is take what what god has done and pervert perverted do you know that satan doesn't even have any new ideas he can only look at what god is doing and try to pervert it even his ideas he's not a creator he cannot make something up you say well brother he all this this is this is uh everything that's going on in the world we live in satan's eat and all this perversion all the perversion is exactly the opposite of what god is doing he's taken god's vision he's taken god's model and he's perverted it and he's pushed it to the people he says look take this and in azusa street something was happening there was there was something that was instilled in the people and they were becoming so in tune with god it was preparing the world it was a spark that went around the world and it was setting the stage for a messenger to come and there were certainly people that were emotional that were there certainly there's wonderful stories of the man i don't uh i can't recall his name offhand but the man that was there the the pastor if you will that was at the azusa street mission and there were stories about him being upstairs they would pray upstairs and when something was out of order he would bang on the floor he could hear it from upstairs he'd be praying 24 hours a day there was someone praying let me ask you this saints let's challenge ourselves today when is the last time that we were always praying well brother that was for them but didn't god doesn't the scriptures tell us to be praying without ceasing god is calling us to something and this is where we start getting into the heart of our message today where there is things that get so convoluted and the things that are true get convoluted with the things that are wrong and we look at the things that people have done with god's word and we say that's wrong not what they've done we get confused about what god has done and we mix it up we say that whole thing all of that over there i don't want to touch that there are scriptures in this bible that if we read through the scriptures it makes us uncomfortable every word every line lord oh i love it praise the lord well not that scripture oh oh brother that's a little fanaticism there what do you mean it's fanaticism it's god's word well brother that would take a level of commitment that i'm not prepared to do ah there is our problem now granted friends there are times when we misunderstand scriptures and we need to seek god until we understand them properly we don't want to go without permission we don't want to assume we don't want to usurp authority over god and say well i'm going to go here when god hasn't sent you there in his word we grow in that be patient seek god but seek god with a sincere heart and don't become complacent where you are because there's not one of us here today that would say i'm as fully dedicated to god as i would like to be not at one of us because we're battling in this flesh we're battling against what god has given us we're right in the middle of this transition where god is calling us out of this world and we're living in this state in this condition but we don't want to be here we've been given a vision this is not where we belong there's something in us that is pulling let's go back to the azusa street mission because i want to highlight by the grace of god just a little timeline as we see the things that have been developing as brother branham is is addressing the pentecostals primarily the pentecostal church and in the late 1940s and moving into the 1950s and he's watching and cooling off of this revival in the 1950s he talks about it all the time he says it's been this many years it's been almost 50 years since the azusa street revival what has happened here what has happened here he's seeing that the life of god that spark of god that god has placed in the world this spark is beginning to die now this is before 1963 this is before the opening of the seals is before god really begins to move and he he changes from the direction of speaking to the world the pentecostal group that have come out of the the denominations at that time now they're beginning to move back into the denominational direction and brother adam is seeing this and god sees it as well god's not surprised by this and he's he started that move he set the prophet on the a in the age to begin to restore back to the hearts of the re of the fathers and now that move is beginning to go back into laodicea because god is calling out the church is called out there there are those that have come out of denominations praise the lord we want nothing but god we want nothing but god's word there's a wonderful little story of a man that was there at azusa street mission he had this box he would bring it he'd put his his head in a box in a cardboard box i tell you what friends if you're desperate for god you might do things that people consider strange people might call you a fanatic it does not mean you're a fanatic being called a fanatic and being a fanatic are two different things but when you're pursuing the spirit of god you will do things differently than what the world does it will cause you to change directions from what the world does the way that you go about your day the things you do the things you see the way you talk and when you start getting desperate for god tradition starts to matter less and less i don't care where i sit in the church i just want to be in church well brother i've sat in this church this chair here for 20 years i'm you know if you're you're comfortable that's between you and the lord but if you sit there and if you're offended if someone were to take your seat i challenge you friend that you might have a spirit that you don't want because that's that becomes a tradition this is the definition of my spiritual walk how can a seat in a building be the definition of your spiritual walk well this gets down to where we live doesn't it it's not to embarrass or shame anyone that's of course not the purpose here the purpose is to challenge us to challenge me where we live every day and what is the purpose well it's the challenges brother you just said it's to challenge us but it's to challenge us so that we are shaking a little bit so that we have a greater revelation of what we're supposed to be standing so that when the devil comes along and he says you're a fanatic anyone been called a fanatic oh yeah does that make you one no it doesn't maybe by the world's terminology but that's not what we're talking about here that's what we have by the grace of god we've got these little definitions today to help us understand the way that these have been applied fanaticism my emotion is my direction i've seen it off and on i've seen it in different people my entire life friends i was born and raised in a message my grandfather was a minister in the message my father is a minister in a message i've seen it off and on my entire life you've got two people doing exactly the same thing one is a fanatic and one is a saint of god following the leadership of the holy spirit doing the exact same thing well but brother tell me what to do i can't i can preach to you the truth i can preach to you where to stand but you need to follow the leadership of god [Music] grow in that seek god in it oh brother but how do i know let's let's continue here and we'll by the grace of god maybe this picture will come together for you the purpose of this today is to help you this is not to make you feel bad about where you may be at spiritually by no means i get so excited when i sit in a church service and i'm challenged i feel so grateful to god that god would have a consideration of me and he would preach to my condition where i'm at because i want to grow in the lord i don't want to stay where i am let's see this is in 1955 enticing spirits now another thing that has taken place i believe and think that any man that's got an experience with god or a woman is bound to get a little emotional i just believe it that's right but you know what they've adopted emotionalism for the baptism of the holy ghost they've just got a lot of noise and there's nothing in it you live just as holy listen to this you live just as holy as you live noisy then you'll be all right emotions is certainly all right bodily exercise profit is little but enticing spirits has got all got over into the holiness group of people and they've got them just resting upon because they shout because they can dance because they can make a motion it started azusa street it's a move of god but this is in 1955 this is as the things are transitioning the pentecostal organization those that believe in the in azusa street experience they've heard the word they've heard it preached but their hearts are beginning to turn from god friends if you look at it and it's face value it looks the same but when you look from god's con god's perception one is godly and one is adultery they're not the same they're not even similar because one is beginning to worship the experience of emotion and as we said earlier the pentecostals went into to pursuing the gifts now they got so desperate to see the gifts in operation they didn't really care how they got there because if you don't have the gifts in operation openly in a service then you're not spiritual this is what they believe and friends it feels good it feels good to have the holy spirit move we'll get to this a little bit more in a bit it feels good to have the spirit moving in a service if he can can be good to just worship the lord and experience the blessings of god but that's what it is it's the blessings of god does that make it wrong it doesn't make it wrong that the blessings come and you you may scream and shout and and there's people that run the aisles it depends on the person some people jump up and down some people are quiet my mother hardly ever talks around people she's very introverted and you'll see her in a church service and she'll never do much more than she'll have her eyes closed and have her head down like this she's very reverent but i grew up hearing that woman pray all the time in her bedroom calling out to god and i felt more than i say we see feeling because there's brother branham even says as much we'll read this quote in a little bit there's times that we can't describe it it's like a feeling but it's more than a feeling it is a knowledge it's an absolute knowledge that there is the presence that is there with you by you next to you i grew up very familiar with that spirit the holy spirit being in our home i i grew up very familiar with people being genuine or being fake there's there's times when i've talked with many brothers about this but once you've seen the gen friends when you've seen the genuine you can't be convinced of something else when you've seen the real and someone else tries to give you something fake you compare the two by god's word and say that's not the genuine i've already seen it let's move along friends there are so many let's just pray that god helps us see the right picture today a beautiful simple holy righteous picture of god's balance live i just love that you live just as holy as you live noisy then you'll be all right my mother's not a loud person but it's one of the holiest women i've ever met emotions is certainly all right bodily exercise profited little but enticing experiences got over into the holiness group and they've got them just resting upon listen resting upon because they can shout because they can dance because they can make emotion but now let's jump to 1965. wait till that satisfaction comes and the satisfaction portion of the fullness of the holy spirit comes in then these joy bells of shouting and speaking in tongues and dancing in the spirit will come you won't have to listen you won't have to do it by music you won't have to you will do it when you're going down the road in the car you will do it when you're sweeping the floor you will do it when you're driving nails in the wall with your carpenter work wherever you go that that joy unspeakable and full of glory when you're in in the when the holy spirit is dealing with you personally you don't need an outside stimulation it's personal and this is this is such a this is such a thing because it's so open and and many people might might dance in church i'm not here to say right or wrong about dancing in church but let me just specify on this one thing friends do not try to say that it's dancing in the spirit if it's not dancing in the spirit if you have seen the genuine you will realize that dancing in the spirit has nothing to do with the music it has nothing to do with the world around that person they're shut off with god i saw a sister one time there was people were praying at the altar and i saw a woman spinning in circles with her hands in the air like this weaving in and out of the people with her eyes closed it wasn't moving to the music well brother does it mean that we all have to have that experience no absolutely not that's no evidence that itself is just that person experiencing the blessings of god and that may be fine as long as it's in order but friends we cannot package it up and say well we got the music going we've got this going and we've got that going and suddenly we're in the spirit don't call it this the holy spirit if it's not the holy spirit because when the holy spirit is moving you begin to move but you're not moving to the carnal world around you there is a spirit that is moving you you may cry you may shout you may run you may be quiet you may deal down you may do any number of things but it has nothing to do with anyone else it's personal no one else can take it from you and no one else can give it to you that's between you and god well brother i had this wonderful experience and i jumped and shouted praise the lord that's not evidence friend you might have a wonderful experience in the lord and that's the blessings of god that's not a bad thing but don't turn that into the evidence of a new birth it's not the same thing excuse me did we read this yes praise the lord 1959 the faith of abraham therefore that every person that's been born again of the holy spirit truly born not just thought they were born not went through some emotion but went through some not went through some sensation but truly born listen now they could have all the emotion sensation with it but you can have the sensation and emotion and not be born it's not evidence and it never was evidence that is what emotionalism as we have defined today that is what emotionalism is i am pursuing emotion as my objective well brother i would never do that the only way you know is to check with god well brother i you know us brothers we never cry do we no we would never do that how about get angry you ever get angry well maybe once in a while you got an emotion with that how about frustrated you got an emotion with that well brother yeah i'm not emotional oh sure you're not uh sure we think emotions i'm not mocking anything you understand what i'm saying oh oh brother i would never yes but you still have emotion you know why we have emotion because god made us that way but when satan comes along and he offers you something that looks like an experience with god but it's actually just emotion you just experienced a bait and switch well i wanted god but what i got was emotion well how do we know look at what it produces look at what it produced we just read in the beginning of service you you know paul does not go down these lines of saint paul does not go down these lines of thoughts accidentally he's looking at something spiritual and when we see the same thing spiritual that paul's looking at it makes a whole lot of sense paul's going down a line of thought and he's talking about straight is the gate narrow is excuse me this is not paul this is here in matthew there's a jesus speaking you should know them in verse number 14 because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life he's saying it's not an easy thing to find and he says beware of false prophets they'll come in in this way they'll come in with a lot of emotion oh but brother i feel this must be god give it the word test right we've learned that haven't we can we say amen to that we've learned to give it the word test everything we do we give ourselves we give everything else give it the word test i i think that's god i think it is well brother i know when god speaks to me oh do you really how about when the prophet of god was flying and and god grounded his plane and he's standing there he's going down the street god is that you and there's a policeman on the other side he stops and he looks in the window and he's embarrassed because he's just wandering around and he's there he's praying he says lord is that you the prophet of god who's spoken to god many many many times he's saying lord is that you if he questioned himself why would we not why do you think he shared that testimony with us that we might make that moment and verify it lord is this you because if it's just emotion the destination is going to be a motion it's going to be a zeal it's going to be a passion it's going to be a pride of life yes i am going to achieve oh are you because if god chooses to have us fail we will fail but when we get to the point where i said lord i don't know what is up and what is down i don't know which way to go i want to be confident but lord i don't even know where to be confident but lord would you teach me he says oh my son my daughter i've just been waiting for you to ask and the lord teaches us you know when a child my son is now almost two years old and oh he can move really well and he goes just as running as fast as his little legs can take him across the yard all the other kids are gone and he's he's just you know his little legs are just going and going and he just goes full tilt but you know he doesn't always have good balance he also doesn't slow down he hasn't really learned that yet sometimes we do that as christians we run full tilt and before we know it we're bouncing off of this and we're bouncing off of that and here we all beat up well god why'd you do this to me and he says i didn't do that to you you said why were you wrong why would you get ahead of me why were you getting out there in front of the in front of the leadership of the holy spirit because you know a good wife is looking to her husband husband minister to me give me direction you know a good husband will give direction as we sit here today as men we may not always have the answers i know for a fact we don't always have the answers is that right brothers yes amen well what do we do when we don't have answers we know the one that does we have an obligation to our homes to lead our homes to have things in order and to not move by emotion we've been talking about being in service but what about all of life yes god told me to do this are you sure are you sure do you just feel it do you have a zeal do you have a pride of life that's moving you in a direction this has to happen or is it all just a inflative inflated bit of emotion but i feel it so strong brother but we've been taught to not go by emotion emotion is not wrong what we do with it can be wrong and sometimes people have looked at this well look at what look at what the pentecostals did you know they turned it into emotionalism and because they were they were chasing the gifts and they'll go through it by emotion and they'll have this and they'll have that and they'll pump up the music so i'm i don't even want the blessings of god we may not say it that way but we get so nervous about a move of god that we don't want to be fanatical because the world might cause fanatical and the the neighbors might call us fanatical and we say well i don't i don't want that brother that's fanaticism i would caution you this way friend as convoluted and as as chaotic and as corrupted as things have become in that way don't blaspheme the holy spirit because when the holy spirit comes you may have emotion emotion is not the evidence but if we get so afraid of a move of god because well that that picture of someone doing this or doing that we've put a definition on it and it becomes legalism don't do this don't do that because we're looking at the evil results of an emotional uh the pursuit of emotion emotionalism we're looking at the evil results results of that and there's some times where let's just let's just put this throughout the in the open there's some times where ministries have pushed on people for an emotional response we all know that this is true if you've been around for for some years you know that this is true but here we are today what is the correct thing what is a a proper balance how do we know that we can stand in confidence and when the holy spirit begins to move we're not afraid of things being out of order we're confidently moving with the spirit and when the spirit says go we go and when the spirit says stop we stop we are not pursuing emotion though emotion may be there emotion is not the objective but emotion may be there this is why this subject this topic has been so confusing has caused so many uh corrupted ideas of what a move of god is supposed to be but remember this is a bait and switch situation remember that if if the satan can't get you an emotionalism he'll try to get you on the other side he'll try to get you so cold and starchy because you're terrified of an emotional experience that you won't allow the blessings of god to soften your heart we had this wonderful little exercise i even even have shared this before but we were talking about bitterness with our young people and we had all the young people went outside and they were digging roots out of the yard this was their challenge he said you had to go outside find a weed and you have to pull out the entire the entire route and you can't come back inside until you've pulled out the entire route it was really hot that day really it was really nice and cool inside but you know we came back inside and it was a very frustrating experience because there were uh all of the of course all the young people were out there pulling up weeds and they would break off you know how it is you pull off a weed and it breaks off but they had to get the whole wheat the whole excuse me the whole root system and there was one little weed that was this tall and those roots were this long oh and they were just boy they were determined to get those roots out we came back inside and we're talking about the experience now we're talking about the root of bitterness and as we talk about the experience i said well how how could it be easier what would make this easier one of the young ladies there uh her father enjoys plants and now as a plant business and they have to help with weeding and with watering the the flowers and water taking care of the plants and she just made this comment she says well you just water it you water the ground and the roots come right out you see when the holy spirit begins to move it begins to soften your heart it begins to soften your condition so that the word can take hold can take root and begin to remove those things that should not be there but if we're so starchy and afraid of a move of the holy spirit that we're a real tight well i'm not i'm not a fanatic i'm not going to look like a fanatic i'm not even going over there i'm not doing anything we get so locked down that the holy spirit is not able to move within us and soften our hearts and when the holy spirit has softened our hearts and he begins to move you will find that god will begin to minister to you in that condition the holy spirit has now softened you softened your spirit softened all the hard things from life and the challenges of life and the trials that we're facing and the hard situations that we're facing and all the contradictions and confusion that is in the world and the holy spirit begins to soften your heart and then he begins to minister to your needs but if you don't allow him to soften your heart that condition just stays there and you go to pull it out and the the roots break off you praise the lord the lord deliver me and a year later you find that thing grows up again and you just go through the cycle over and over and over lord i need deliverance lord i need deliverance you have to fully submit to god allow god to just saturate your being and you stop caring what other people think and i don't mean being out of order and making a big show that's not what we're talking about we're just talking about so being so submitted to god that you say god whatever it takes there was something that was true there was something that was genuine about that azusa street experience they were so genuine they didn't know anything god was teaching them about the move of the spirit and they were just trying to to do everything they could to pursue god why had that changed why should that be different for us we're not talking about going with emotionalism we're talking about pursuing god with every part of our being not afraid of what god is going to do god will never harm you god will never hurt you and all of the hurts and woes that we have in our heart we just want to get to know god we want to be closer to god we'll touch on this more in just a moment let's move along this is from 1965 invisible union of the bride of christ the grace of god spoke to you brought you to the altar you're seeking god's blessing you're seeking his word you're seeking the holy ghost you're seeking the favors of god and you are and you can really with all your heart surrender it now don't look for any emotion look for truth a truth that's from your heart by faith lord i'm willing to do anything that your word commands me to do i surrender myself with all that's in me does it mean that that person won't have emotion no it means they're not pursuing emotion emotion is not even in the picture there or not there it doesn't matter see again let's go back to the pentecostal organization the gifts became the evidence and they're pursuing the gifts and to get there they went the emotional route but friends if if we're just i need to have this i need to have this and let me touch on this even for a moment and and this is this really hits home and we've got to say this very carefully and i pray that you you consider this with a spiritual mind do you know that we can get so caught up in trying to seek a new revelation well did our hearts not burn within us oh there's a stimulation inside we're after that feeling [Music] but not looking for the word to actually have a result because the scripture says though i understand all mysteries and i have not love does it mean the mysteries are wrong of course not of course not but what you do with it if it be the true seed of god the true seed of god will bring up god it cannot produce anything else a good tree can only produce good brother i had this experience okay let's watch let's watch and see what happens brother i experience this great revelation praise the lord again we're speaking respectfully i've had this great revelation okay what does it produce in you you see if the devil can't get you on one side what is he going to do he's going to push you to the other well brother that's not emotionalism is it not we just want the stim we want the feeling of the stimulation of revelation we want something to be stimulating in us oh praise the lord but it's the feeling that we're after oh my so close it would deceive the very elect if it were possible now we know let me let me just caveat that a little bit we know that revelation comes from the lord is that right and god is giving he's opening those things to his children and that's exclusively for his children but someone can look at those things and they start putting the pieces together i've got all the facts i've got the facts i've got the facts oh yeah look at this and then this goes with this and this and it's stimulating me on the inside and i'm gonna i'm addicted to that stimulation that's emotionalism just like everything else it is christ in you this is the mystery that god is looking for the revelation of himself in you the ma what is the interpretation of god's word the manifestation of god's word how is god's word interpreted living in you not from here and not because my heart is warm and because i enjoy the service that's good that's not wrong but that's not the evidence praise the lord 1958 called out i wish now let's this is this is a good example to distinguish brother branham is explaining this here distinguishing between the blessings of god and the power of god this is a whole subject in itself which we're not going to spend a lot of time on but let's hear what the prophet says about this in 1958 the cold out i just wish i had some vocabulary to explain this this just now there's nothing can do it he can't explain it you know what it feels like every person in here under my control that's right the holy spirit is here the anointing it doesn't make me jump up and scream that's the blessings of god isn't that an incredible distinction he's saying i'm having this reaction but there is something else there is a different experience let's see as he continues a lot of times you pentecostal people gets fooled by that jesus had the greatest anointing of any man he read a scripture as i just read it now and he said this day the scripture is fulfilled in your eyes and what did he do he read the scripture and never run all over the place he sat down a precious and precious words come from his mouth the greatest anointing that had ever anointed because the scripture had said i've put my spirit upon him to sow judgment to heal the sick and so forth he said that's the blessings of your salvation that you're enjoying there the blessings not the power the spirit it's something to chew on isn't it i don't know about you but i want to understand every moment where i'm standing lord what do you want me to do now right right now i don't mean vaguely i don't mean some distant interpretation of it i mean in this moment right now what am i supposed to be doing that's pleasing to the father this moment right now this is brother branham expressing in this moment there is something different but this is not that there is a power that is here there's something that needs to happen and he's expressing that there is a difference does it make the blessings wrong what a great question because now we have to start figuring out where do we stand well he clearly says that you're looking for the power of god and it's easy to interpret that and say well you know the blessing's over here we're just looking for the power of god but remember that scenario of the rain falling falling on the earth it's softening our hearts and we've taken the blessing with god and set them off on the side and we can't figure out how we've lost the joy of our salvation we can't figure out how how we're always excuse me but our mind is just maxed out we feel like our mind is being ripped apart and we feel like the stress is just overwhelming we can't figure out why we're all worn out but when those blessings come god says you come through a trial you come through the the situation you need to come through spend a little time and in some blessings and worship god don't chase emotion but enjoy the blessings it's a gift from god we i love this scenario we have um i believe it was rebecca she's uh receives the the rebecca and isaac she receives the the gifts from the come from abraham comes through eliezer she gets the gifts i've probably used this example before but it's a wonderful scenario because abraham had sent some blessings for her and the gifts are given the bracelets and so on are given to rebecca and she's enjoying the wow this is this is impressive these gifts are impressive you know she she was spent the time on the camels and they're traveling and they get to where they're going or they almost get to where they're going and their she's been talking with eliezer eliza what's what's the master like who's this who's that what is this like what color does he like what does he like about this what do you like about that you know when she arrives and she sees isaac out there in the field she doesn't take off all of the gifts that she'd received and throw him on the ground and stomp on him they were they were little tokens of of the love of the father they had been given to her as a special thing and she didn't throw him down but she also didn't stop and say isaac i don't really need you i've got the gifts that's the difference the the they were a gift from the one she loved from the father indicating the the commitment of the son but she didn't throw them down and stomp on them and spit on them they were just they were just a part of the picture they had become a part of who she was she wasn't focused on that but it was still part of who she was i love to use this example and again may have used this example i've been saying this a lot today but these are things that have been in my heart for a very long time in general this is such a confusing topic and by the grace of god again today the lord just give us a little clarity but all of these things that people may come into the presence of god enjoy the blessings of the lord but you know i have two sons and they both have blue eyes all of my sons have blue eyes but not everyone with blue eyes is my son my sons have blue eyes but not everyone with blue eyes is my son all of god's children have the blessings of god but not everyone with the blessings is a child of god they might come so far but this is what the pentecostals as an organization have done they came so far and when the word came to them we know what the story is they came so far and they chose the gifts over a further move of god they choose chose the gifts over the opening of the word they didn't want to go further with god they come so far and they don't want to go any further does that make sense friends let's move along quickly here time's getting away from us 1965 the invisible union of the bride of christ the grace of god spoke to you brought you to the altar let's turn to matthew 6 if you would we're going to change the direction here for just a few minutes by the grace of god i don't want to keep you much longer praise the lord god is so wonderful in the times where we're going through such challenges the lord always has an answer has a way to comfort his people matthew 6 let's read just verses 5 and 8. as you saw the title of their thoughts today is a secret closet and understanding emotion so here in matthew 6 let's read verses 5 and 8. and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray and pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which sheth in secret shall reward thee openly now we're going to by the grace of god tie this in with uh this is here in 1963 now in the seventh seal there is a vision of course that brother branham is referring to here and we're just going to catch a snippet of it and then we're going to go back to where he explains a little bit more but here in the seventh seal he's talking about and just when he picked me up he took me up and sent me way up high to where a meeting was going on looked like a tent or the cathedral of some sort and i looked and there was a little box like a little place over in the side and i seen that light was talking to somebody above me that light that you see here there on the picture it whirled away from me like that and went over to that tent and said i'll meet you in there and said this will be the third pool and you won't tell it to nobody now let's read here in 1956 he's expounding on what this vision was a little bit more 1956 being led of the holy spirit exactly what we're referring to today and just then now i want you to watch this and listen how it is now so you watched the difference then i heard something whipping around where were like that was that always goes every time we have a healing service that just what happens that's just what happens that's the way it has always sounded sounded that way in the bush that time when i heard it it's always been that way and i felt it and i heard it rather going moving and i looked and here went that real soft light moving away from me and went down and went into that little building and then there's something different between the light and the angel because he's still here with me and the light had went into the building and this angel still speaking behind me which is a big man he said i will meet you in there. so then i said i don't understand why in there and he said watch and this woman went when she come out of there on the ambulance stretcher she was pushing the stretcher out the other side and she said the lady asked her she said what what happened she said i don't know it just happened she said i've been in the stretcher said i've been down in the bed for years and here come the man out packing his crutches and they asked him what said he didn't know and he was coming to the platform to testify and i said i don't understand that in there and watch he always he's always scriptural he said did not our lord say when thou prayest be not like the hypocrites that like to make a show and said enter into the secret closet and when you've done so close the door then pray to the father that seeth in secret and he that seeth in secret shall reward thee openly and he said remember that name that you were hunting that time you were dreamed about you were dreamed about i said yes he said i'll meet you in there this time it won't be a public show and the vision left me this scenario again we could spend much time on just this portion here but we want to tie it by the grace of god with what we are considering today and the reason why these two parts come together is because there is a secret place that god is calling us to and the devil wants you to believe that you're in that secret place when you're not the devil wants to convince you with emotion with legalism with pentecostalism satan wants to put everything in front of you and try to get your attention on something that will make you think that you're already in a secret place with god and for even friends if we've been there many times praying with the lord just between you and god no matter how many times you've been there there's times where we become complacent we become a little bit tired we become so busy with life as we were just talking about a moment ago your mind just feels like it's being ripped apart and as we look at this situation but the brandon has this has the visions relay it now now and the seven seal he says this is the third pool there's something profound here for us there's something that he's highlighting here in this one of this the most fantastic messages has ever been preached the seventh seal there's something that's happening and leading all the way up through azusa street all through the 1950s brother bannon is watching the divergence the separation of the move of god from the people and the people most of the people the pentecostals have chased off after this evidence and that evidence and people that thought they were were sincere they they chased after this doctrine and they chased after this doctrine there were some that chased after brother branham himself and they tried to worship brother branham and then they've had this doctrine about brother branham and had that doctrine about brother branham and and the summation of it many times becomes look at me i have this exclusive revelation that no one else has i'm exclusive and if you're not in my group you're out it's happened over the years but if we as god's children want to stand at the very end of time and say lord we have not deviated to the left we've not deviated to the right lord we've stayed right in tune with you so perfectly aligned that when you speak we hear you we're not caught by some glamour some by some glitz of of this great experience that makes us feel good even if it feels worse we're willing to take god's word do you know many times that god will permit that to be so you've got two choices and one is a harder thing oh that's really hard in the flesh i don't want to go that route but you have to give it up my mind goes back to watching my when my son was two and a half months old was was dying of rsv and bacterial pneumonia both of his lungs have had collapsed part way and he's only two and a half months old this very small little package and my wife and i have to after being there we prayed together and said lord when he was born we committed him into your hands and we will not take him back now this was our commitment to the lord you see when you get to the point where you're willing to put everything in god's hands and it's it is it does not matter what you feel like it does not matter what the situation looks like lord i will take your word no matter what the conditions are speaking to me no matter what everyone else is saying i don't care if they call me a fanatic i am not a fanatic i am not chasing my emotions my destination is not emotion i am not cold i am not starchy and when god calls on me to get shut in with him i am not going to accept anything that then genuine fellowship with him i won't take some bait and switch i won't take some false simulation some emulation of who i know god is and the age that we live in pulling every every direction to the left to the right up down you know that overshooting the target is just as bad as undershooting the target oh i'm gonna do this great thing for god god didn't ask you to he just asked you to do his word he said do exactly as i tell you and you'll hit the mark every time obedience is better than sacrifice just hit the mark that's where we want to be and god calls us he says come well brother i thought this is a natural secret place it should be we should have a natural place where we just go and shut the door but friends there is something even deeper than a natural a room a little closet where you go pray brother branham always set the example for us to go pray in secret physically in secret physically separate yourself but you can do that and knock it shut in with god it takes laying down everything well brother what do you mean everything i mean our hurts our sorrows our confusion our anger our desire to achieve everything and when the holy spirit begins to move we're not looking at some false evidence it's not the addition of emotion or lack of emotion that's nothing i may cry i may not cry what difference does that make i might be in the blessings of god i might scream at my child what difference does that make what i'm looking for is to be in his will i want to be so perfectly in his will that when someone calls me a fanatic i can confidently stand there and say i'm sorry you see it that way i don't have to rise up and defend myself and challenge that person i don't need to push on them i know where i'm standing and i can pray in love for them because the ground is soft it's been saturated with the holy spirit brother i've got hurts i've got anger then you need to get in the presence of god and stay there so many different ideas we can preach about this we can talk about it but it takes god to make it personal to you when you have a revelation of what it means to get shut in with god you watch the things in your life change because you're taking the word the word is the seed of god you're taking the seed of god and you're planting it in good ground you're watering the good ground spending time in the holy spirit and that seed continues to grow well lord i'm weak in this area let me go let me go uh i'm going to pray i'm going to go to church i'm going to see what brother chad is going to preach on sunday and my aunt my questions are going to be answered you come to church and you come with that attitude and the minister preaches and you get a strength in your heart now you have to go saturate in it it's not just one moment the church service is not the pinnacle of your week we're taking the word that we receive we want to take it home we want to apply it we want to live in it we want to saturate in it allow the holy spirit to move through you and move you in whatsoever direction he wills and satan will love to give you some false idea because if he gives you a false then you miss the genuine if he can convince you that you've already received something that you haven't you miss the genuine and friends as children of god we have been robbed many times by many false ideas that have come our way and i'm not talking about any particular person i mean this is the strategy of satan he's trying to give you something to push your attention to the left or right and sometimes the ground in us gets so we've been walking with the lord this doesn't make you not a son or daughter of god sometimes that god has done a tremendous work he might be a born again son or daughter of god but you get so buried that bored down with with life and with things that are just pressing on you you have to we have to be reminded to get in his presence to just be enjoy being in love with him enjoy the sweetness the tenderness the innocence of being in the presence of the holy spirit and when we get in that place we begin to commune with him he doesn't stay silent he begins to speak do you brother you know as an audible voice is it this is it that i don't know for you i don't know how god will deal with you that's between you and god we want a formula we want well is it going to have no no no no you personally get to know god brother why would we why would we take the time to emphasize this do you know that there are young people that are growing up here in this assembly that were not alive when brother branham was alive they don't remember the testimonies of azusa street there are many situations that we're growing up in we have not seen enough of the genuine this is not a criticism of anyone or certainly not of the assembly here or anything that of that effect this is what satan is trying to do in the age we're living in he's trying to give a false he's trying to get detention away from the genuine and when you're saturated like a sponge absorbing the holy spirit every day and the word is being preached it begins to blossom supernatural as a wonderful brother has said the supernatural is just natural it's just an attribute but we can take all the facts we can take all the scriptures and take all the facts and try to put it together and just hammer it and hammer and hammer it you know what we'll get nothing it's god's word he knows how to use it the holy spirit has been given to lead and guide us in all truth and righteousness let's summarize in this way from 1963 god hiding himself in simplicity there is one side that's highly intellectual cold and indifferent they deny everything there and the other sides get on the excuse me and the others get on the other side on the other side with a radical bunch of emotion and deny the word but that real true church stays right in the middle of the road now if you notice it's got the bible knowledge of what god said it's spiritual enough to be warm in its heart and it's just the road isaiah said it would be that way he said there will be a highway today friend what i see so clearly is that satan has presented so many false things to try to rob us of our blessings of the power of god of everything that god has for us but every word is ours not just the ones that we're uncomfortable with not just the ones that we don't understand all of it and there are times when brother branham starts talking about spiritual things i say brother branham i have never experienced that i don't know what you're saying but if if it's for me to understand god can minister to me to understand those things it's it's no it's no mystery to god when god wants to make it simple to you god makes it simple to you so what is our what is the heart of what we are looking at today the heart of what we are looking at today let's see if we we can back up to our take me just a moment here to back up to our a little summary slide of our definitions legalism living a law instead of grace pentecostalism pursuing gifts as the objective emotionalism pursuing emotion as the objective fanaticism my emotion is my direction and a bait and switch sold one thing but receiving another in this moment this is the thoughts for today let's go back to what we're considering at the beginning of service brother branham would discern the hearts and there would be this tremendous move of god what do we expect now at the end of a service it's easy to be nervous and try to emulate what brother branham did or what someone else does but see now we have to apply the very things that we've just been talking about what is it the thing that we're after the thing that we're after is that god's word be known that god's word the holy spirit might be able to saturate your being with freedom that you might not be afraid of being in the presence of god we've had so many wounds and and mis misguided ideas about what is the presence of god and what is the evidence of the holy ghost and all of these things over the years but god has so many blessings and richness for his children there is no need for us to take an imitation there's no need for us to take some other idea so we'll ask you this let's just stand together just so you're not nervous i'm not making a big altar call or or pulling on you for something special we're not doing that today but we now have an opportunity it's just you and god see the minister ministers will do everything that is in our heart to do to be able to encourage the saints of god but i also have been fellowshipping recently and brother jeremy and i were talking last night one plants one waters but god gives the increase no man can make you any different than what you are that's between you and god it's sovereign between you and god and that's just something for you to work out with the lord so what we're going to do now is just invite the musicians to come we're just going to worship the lord for a few minutes and then by the grace of god we're going to go home but if there's been anything here today in the content that we have looked at i encourage you if you have been challenged in your heart if you find that there's some things that have just been hanging in your heart you haven't been able to praise god and serve god and maybe there's a hang-up in your heart it's a good opportunity to just seek the lord you see sometimes when we're together we're all praying in the same direction we're not looking for an emotional output we're not looking for an emotional result we just want the holy spirit to have his way in sweetness and we can take that presence with us as we go home we want the lord to have his way from beginning to end can anyone say amen to that can we sing that song by his word i'll prevail by his word i'll never fail [Music] oh i'm breathing by his words [Music] i'll never [Music]

even as we grow and mature as christians lord we forget where we come from that our foundation has to be in an intimate prayer life with you private secret it's invisible to the world but lord it's so real and it's so personal god i pray that you will anoint us as we go our ways here in just a little little bit a few moments lord i pray that you would anoint us as we go that we have a greater desire to pray to be shut in with you that we find strength for the day that we're living in lord may our hearts be soft as we come to service on wednesday may our hearts be soft that the word just

of god but the temptation still lays there may god put blinders on us that we can't see anything else what is our destination brother is our wednesday night service no our destination is to be called to meet him in the air that's what we're fighting for that's what we're striving for that's what we're praying for lying upon line precept upon precept saints may the lord jesus walk with you may god
