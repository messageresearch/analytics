together let's just come in let's sing another song let's sing i give my mind we'll sing the song as we move together if you can screwed over if it's convenient and easy to do that while we sing let's

the lord let's take our bibles and turn to matthew 13 and we'll get right into the word reading matthew chapter 13. we're going to continue on with the with the subject of search the scriptures i've been enjoying it myself amen been wonderful we're going to take another look into ruth this evening by the grace of god also i'd like to announce while you're turning there that next wednesday a week from today we're going to have brother vernon manahan from the philippines will be here ministering for us so there was a little confusion he was supposed to be here that's the original date he was scheduled then last week he told me that he's going to come early and be here sunday so i scheduled him for sunday then he told me this morning he can't make it sunday so he's back to wednesday so we're back to the original plan so if there's something on the announcement sheet that's confusing that's the reason why so to be a week from today brother vernon brother vernon we've worked with for years he's kind of taken over the work in cambodia for brother nestor he was in the video that we showed last month so it'd be nice to hear from him and then also we should be in prayer this saturday for brother nathan and sister natalie they get married so we're all happy and excited for them so keep them in your prayers and then it's an exciting time praise the lord all right let's take a look at matthew chapter 13 verse 16 matthew 13 and 16. but blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for they hear for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them amen can you say amen amen i'm happy to be hearing and to be seeing what we're hearing and seeing and i just want more amen every time we come back it's i'm thankful lord for what you did but i'm here for more amen praise god let's just bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this word lord we thank you for the opportunity to come and hear it again lorne we haven't come here lord leaning on the arm of flesh or to look at human instrumentality but we've come in obedience to your word to gather ourselves together and we rely lord on your word when you said by the foolishness of preaching you chose to save souls and now we're trusting that you will do lord what you've promised to do we pray to anoint the words that will be spoken tonight take control of this vessel that you would speak your words of eternal life right and sow it right into our hearts lord that we might grow thereby and be what you've ordained for us to be in this age we give you our we give you glory and honor lord and ask that you would take preeminence in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated thank you thank you let's turn to matthew chapter one back just a few pages and we're very very familiar now with this passage of scripture i just think it's it's just amazing how much can come out of a few scriptures amen it's got it's gotten to be very exciting for me and and i never planned on it going this far and going this deep and i realize as we move on that we've gone through tamar and we've gone through rahab and now we're looking at ruth and you know we've missed stuff you know we've skipped over stuff but that's just the way it's going to be you know we'll go back if the lord allows time to continue as it is now we'll go back and we'll see more but we can only we can only preach as as god reveals so we look here in chapter one verse one the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham abraham begot isaac and isaac begot jacob and jacob begot judas and his brethren and judas begot pharas and zerah of tamar and pharas begot ezram and ezram begat abraham and they ran begotta meena dab and aminadab begot niacin and solomon begot boaz of rahab amen that's woman number two and boazby got obed of ruth and that's woman number three that's the one we're looking at out of these four women that are clustered here in the beginning of matthew let's turn back to the book of ruth chapter one we'll begin looking there keep your bibles handy we're going to stay in the book of ruth and read quite a bit today brother branham says in the message revelation chapter 5 from 1961 she said now i want to begin right here now today on ruth and boaz now there is four stations or four junctions in ruth and boaz the first is ruth deciding and that's what we talked about sunday was ruth deciding and we didn't get past that one that was just as far as we got if you look through the book of ruth it's broken down really clearly in the four chapters and the first chapter covers deciding second chapter covers serving the third is resting and the fourth is rewarded and so it's kind of neatly divided in the book of ruth so there's four stations or four junctions in ruth and boaz the first is ruth deciding man ruth first she had to decide whether she was going to go into this land or not with naomi she had to make a decision then after she got there the next thing she had to do was serve in the field of boaz out there barefooted gleaning behind the reaper serving then after she had found grace and bow as a sign then she had to wait till boaz done the kinsmen redeemership to take back all naomi lost in order to bring in ruth to moabite and then the next stage is ruth rewarded now watch ruth deciding perfectly oh if anybody say that the bible wasn't inspired there's something wrong with them every word of it's inspired every word of it fits right together just like a dovetail on a plank it goes perfectly together like cogs on a mighty wheel turning just time to the millionths of a second just exactly right amen and the more god peels back and the more we see we see how exact the bible is the exact in words and in phrases and the way things are lined and there's always strange things going on in the bible that when you first glance over it doesn't make any sense it's seeming like things were out of order or things are not recorded correctly or or things are phrased or worded in a funny or strange way and when you go back and when god peels it open it's exactly the way it's supposed to be so whenever we hit into these odd things we should stop and say there's something there amen i don't know what it is but there's something odd about this passage and it's not just odd for the sake of being odd it's odd to draw our attention because god is revealing himself he's hidden and revealed in simplicity and everything that he's ever going to teach his bride is laying right here in this book everything that he's going to do everything that we need to know is laying here amen but it wasn't for previous ages to know so he had to hide it in plain sight so he wrote it in a way that you could read it and read it and miss it and read it and miss it but when when he would just turn the dial in our understanding just a little bit amen and clear that vision just a little bit and focus the binoculars just a little more all of a sudden it clears up and we understand what's been laying there and it's been laying there the whole time and you don't have i've said this many times but we don't have to revise the bible we don't have to then argue you know over all of these things we just take it as it is and god has a way of unfolding and unfolding and unfolding so it's been exciting very exciting so he says there's four junctions in here we've been through the number four quite a bit there's these four women clustered in these first six verses of matthew tamar rahab ruth and bathsheba and then there's four stages of restoration four stages of the grain four anointings through the church ages we've been through all of these we even went through the four stages of elisha following elijah amen from from gilgal to bethel bethel to jericho jericho to jordan and once they crossed jordan amen now elijah's taken away but the ministry that was in elijah and the mantle was on elijah now falls on elisha and now coming back acro out of the veil through the veil into the holy of holies goes elijah and elisha but coming out is just elisha just the bride with the same ministry that was on crisis on her and now she's got the double portion and she's got the the mantle and she's got the ministry and now when you you cross over now they cross back over jordan and not they elisha crosses over jordan and he comes back to jericho and the 50 prophets meet him and say hey we've got 50 strong men we can go and find elijah he's saying you're wasting your time because that ministry is right here that anointing is right here you're wasting your time and they said no we want elijah and they run off for three days looking for elijah and they come back but he tells them no and they ask again and he says fine do whatever you want but you're not going to find anything amen so when they come back from looking for elijah after three days they say hey we couldn't find him he said that's what i told you from the beginning you're not going to find him amen what you're looking for is now in another form isn't the bible beautiful amen so now we know there was four stages to the wheat plant to be restored it was the the stalk the tassel the shuck and the wheat so we're going to follow this through ruth which is the restoration of the church let's look at ruth chapter 1 verse 1. now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehem judah went to sojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was elimelech in the name of the wife naomi in the name of his two sons melon and chileon ephrathites of bethlehem judah and they came into the country of moab and continued there and the lima like naomi's husband died and she was left in her two sons and they took them wives of the women of moab the name of the one was orpah in the name of the other ruth and they dwelt there about 10 years and maelon and chilean died also both of them and the woman was left of two her two sons and her husband so now we find that alimolec we talked about this sunday he leaves the promised land and a jew is never to leave his inheritance he's never to leave his position but now because of famine they leave the position and we talked about god bringing hardship amen in order to test our resolve and to test our faith amen that's why brother ben said sometimes you pray and after you pray you get worse and he said you should testify that's a sure sign that you got your healing but many times that getting worse is just a test to see if we really believe or not because if we believe our faith is not based on symptoms our faith is based on the word so whether we get better meaning or where to get worse that doesn't change the promise in the word that by his stripes we are healed so when you get worse that's the time to say praise god i'm healed because i'm not basing on how i feel in my body amen if i feel better then i've got faith if i feel worse i don't have faith it's not based on feelings revelation goes beyond feelings i've got faith in the word of god that his word won't fail and so now god will allow famine to strike no no not me this isn't a prosperity gospel amen this is the real true gospel this is a real true bible it's not always going to be prosperous you're not always going to be healthy amen you're not always going to have everything going for you amen because god is testing proving his children what's he looking for he's looking for a reflection of what he is hallelujah amen so now elimalek left and he goes and he leaves the promised land and goes into the denominations amen and there we're not wearing naomi's there then alimolec dies melin dies chilion dies and now she's gone through the the first three church ages and now she finds herself in the dark ages so we'll look at that in just a second but brother branham says in the message to kinsmen redeemer 1960 he says now this story starts out something on that manner as a lovable sweet woman her name was naomi which means pleasant alimonleck was her husband means worship pleasant worship was her family so you can see that everything started off fine when they first come together they were in the inheritance they were in the promised land she's pleasant her husband's worship we have pleasant worship that's how the family starts but some trouble comes along somewhere as trouble strikes and you begin to find out as brother brethren goes to say he says pleasant worship was her family they had a son maelon one one that means sickness and chile on the other meant weary gloomy sadness there was the family so you can see something has happened from the time these two come together in pleasant worship until now they're daming their children sickness and weary some amen so the their condition changed and now they're confessing the conditions around them and not confessing the promise that was given to abraham we're going to be very careful what our confession is and brother bam goes on to say and they came and they came a famine in the land of israel and the first mistake a jew ever makes is leave that land god gave them that land when abraham was given that land god told him not to leave that land and he made a mistake when he went down to gerar got in trouble a jew is never to leave palestine that's his lotted place amen and the church is never to leave the word that's her lotta place and that's what happened in the first church age she left the word and started taking man's ideas for a better understanding or something more reasonable or logical or easy to understand and she left her land and went down into moab brother brown typing moab here in the exodus journey in 1964 he preaches a message called god identifying himself by his characteristics and he's talking in the exodus journey he says on his road leading israel out to the promised land he came in contact with his brother his denominational brother moab now moab by no means were heathens that was lot's daughter's children one of their children had sprung moab now up there i want you to notice these two nations in contrast here was egypt a little scattered about no nation to go to no executives or no king or nothing or any dignitaries among them just a people on the road to a promised land and here they had to go through the land of moab it was right in the line of promise and moab also was a believers in jehovah and they had a prophet and israel had a prophet both of them had prophets so here they're believers in jehovah their their their cousins amen to the israelites amen they're not far off they're not wild heathens they're something similar to the israelites but their their brother vamp calls them the denominational group they got the denominational system and that's not where israel was supposed to go amen israel gets in trouble amen by allowing balaam to tempt them into mixing the worship between the two which they were supposed to be separated and here a few generations later elimelech because the promises are not coming to pass like he thinks they should come in the past is willing to leave the word and go back into denominational ideas and he's looking for bread and he's in the house of god's bread he's dwelling in bethlehem the house of god's bread and sometimes in the house of god's bread you can have famine in your life how is it possible we're the bride god loves me or the elect chosen how can this be going on the same reason it happened to israel is the same reason it happens to the bride to test her to prove that she will not fall like he fell this one's going to be tested she's going to be proven and she will overcome by keeping every word amen so they slip down to moab to the denominational group they never should have been there but but coming out now when they go to return there's going to be there's going to be four stages of restoration through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost which is really the restoration of the gifts and then the holy ghost itself and so when naomi comes out now we find two vines are coming out orpah and ruth orpa is a make-believer but ruth is the real believer orpah thinks she wants to go back to the land she says we'll go she's going she's determined to go but when when naomi begins to explain to her the hardship and the trial and the sacrifice she says no i think i'll go back to the denominations but ruth didn't care she went on so we find now let's skip down to verse 18. it says after naomi tries two times to send ruth back and ruth refuses in verse 18 she says when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her so they too went until they came to bethlehem and it came to pass when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this naomi and she said unto them call me not naomi call me mara which means bitter for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again empty why then call you me naomi which means pleasant seeing the lord hath testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me she's she's in thyatira right now she's in the dark ages she has nothing she's lost everything she went out full and she comes back empty but now there's going to be a restoration there's going to be the word coming forth she's coming back because she's heard there's bread in bethlehem she's heard about luther's revival she's heard that there's something that's going to bring me out of the dark ages and i can find bread amen she didn't find it in the denominations what she found was a loss of everything i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again empty verse 22 so naomi returned and ruth the moabite as her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of harvest praise the lord now now we talked about ruth deciding and that was chapter one now we're going to go into chapter two with his roots serving ruth serving the stage of sanctification and let's look at verse one and naomi had a kinsmen of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of elimelech and his name was boaz and ruth the moabite has said unto naomi let me now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him and whose side i shall find grace and she said unto her go my daughter and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto boaz who was of the kindred of elimalek now limalek happens to be the family that she's out of and she finds herself in boaz's field and this word hap means accident or chance fortune or fate amen so now they come they return back into the land and now they have nothing but but now ruth is going to go out and glean in the fields as somebody who's poor and in poverty she's going to go out and glean they have no inheritance they have no fields they have no income they have nothing but all she can do is is is take advantage of a of something in the law that allows the poor to glean behind the reapers in a field and so now according to the law she's going to go down there and get what bits and morsels she can get so that they can survive but it just happens by chance that she winds up and boaz's field and boaz is a type of christ amen and do you think that things happen by chance in the scriptures or was she ordained to find this field amen she didn't know she was ordained she woke up that morning to go out and find something that they might eat to live but she her footsteps were ordered by the lord amen and no doubt she had to make some sort of choice that morning to go out the door and go right or left to walk so far and stop at a certain place and no matter what circumstances moved her something moved her to a certain spot to a certain place where she would come to a certain field and in that field would be owned by boaz and that's the place where she would hat to light upon by chance because when you look at when you look at our stories those of us who are here that weren't raised in the message but just have come from outside amen there's just some happenstance some chance we just happened to meet somebody who had some odd beliefs and we were just curious enough to listen to a tape or read a book amen that wasn't by happenstance there was no accident there was no chance the footsteps of the righteous order of the lord god was going to make sure that you got into boaz's field to start gleaning out of the right field amen praise be to god it was her hat to light on the part of the field belonging to boaz it was your hap just to find amen to find the field of the kinsman redeemer of christ there's all kinds of fields out there but there's one that belongs to the kinsmen redeemer that's where the seed is verse four and behold boaz came from bethlehem and said unto the reapers the lord be with you and they answered him the lord blessed thee then said boaz into a servant that was said over the reapers whose damsel is this and the servant that was said over the reapers answered and said it is the moabitess damsel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab and she said i pray you let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves so she came and hath continued even from the morning until now that she tarried a little in the house then said boaz unto ruth hearst thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go thou after them have i not charged the young men that they should not touch thee and when thou art a thirst go into the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have i found grace in thy eyes that thou should have take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger amen and boaz answered and said unto her it hath fully been shown at me all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how thou has left thy father and thy mother in the land of thy nativity and are coming to a people who thou knewest not heretofore how does he know all that because this is christ she's not just in any field but he knows that you've left everything he knows that you gave up on the system you gave up on your father's belief your mother's belief you gave up on everything and you come here and he knows all about it amen she thinks she's pitiful she thinks nobody's going to take knowledge of her but here boaz the kinsmen redeemer already knows all about her life hallelujah you walk into church the first time you think nobody knows me i'm nobody but you've happened to the field of boaz and he knows all about your life and he can tell you everything about you where you've been and where you've come from and what sacrifices you've made to be there amen he says the lord recompensed thy work and a full reward be given thee of the lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust and she said let me find favor in thy sight my lord for thou hast comforted me and for that thou has spoken friendly into thine handmaid though i be not like unto one of thine handmaids this is interesting the way she talks because she says you've been good to me though i'm a stranger and you've talked friendly to me as your handmaid though not like one of your handmaids now you have to find out boaz here is an unmarried man and there's handmaids all around amen and there's women all around why is boaz an unmarried man and now this woman is saying i'm a stranger and i'm not like the other maids hmm maybe that's what boaz is looking for maybe that's what boaz has been waiting all his life for amen for the stranger amen for the gentile woman to come along who's not who's a stranger in the land and not like the other maids hallelujah and look at what he says it's almost as if a prophecy goes forth in verse 12 he says the lord recompensed thy work and a full reward be given thee i wonder what she's thinking when he says that i wonder if she's thinking i'll get lots of barley i wonder if she's thinking god will be good to me and i'll be able to glean really well and i'll be able to pound out what i've gleaned and thresh it out i'll have plenty of bread for me and naomi no no doubt her mind cannot fathom what's actually being spoken to her a full reward come to you the lord recommends to you a full reward amen not a partial reward in her wildest dreams she's only thinking partial partial partial enough bread for tomorrow and if i'm lucky maybe i can get two days worth while i'm in the field maybe i can get something to sustain me maybe i can go to church and get something for just to make my journey just a little bit more prosperous or when i need a deliverance in my body and healing maybe i'll go and i'll get what i need amen boaz is looking beyond tomorrow beyond the next day he's looking for a full reward and sometimes we have the mindset of ruth and we're gleaning just for today and trying to get another little bit just to pass us by until we can get back to church or god does something else for us amen we're not realizing we've come to the full reward amen not we haven't come to the time where i'm going to beat out a little threshing that i get by my own hands then i'm going to work it out and try to grab something just to keep me going a little longer but we've come to a full reward and by the time we get to the end of the story we find out that ruth is not amen gathering among the reapers anymore she's not picking up little bits that are left behind but now she is joint heir of the field and boaz is laying down lord recompenses the a full reward and she cannot even imagine what a full reward is i have not seen nor ear heard all that the lord has in store for us amen but it's time that we don't think like ruth thought in this stage that we come a little further down the road and we realize we've come to a full reward hallelujah i'm a stranger and not like your handmaids perfect amen perfect that's what i want brother branham says in the waters of separation now back to ruth just a moment and look at it when boaz seen her he fell in love with her and he commanded her not to leave that field but to stay right there and glean fastly that's what god does to every believer that once comes to christ stay with him don't be carried about with every wind of doctrine stay right with christ and brother man said this message is christ and this field is the message it's the word for this age amen and we've seen people so many times amen they're unstable in all their ways amen because they're working through the stages they meant justification make the decision now working it out but when they get to this stage sometimes they get a little discouraged they meant about how much wheat there or how much barley they're able to thresh out and they try it somewhere else and try it somewhere else and try this and go back amen when what you got to do is when you come to the message when you come to the field stay put stay right here and glean right here amen read your bible grab a message book listen to another tape quit dabbling in other fields quit fooling around with the denominational stuff quit getting the books off the shelf at the bible book story man stay in this field [Applause] sometimes we become double minded by looking at too many sources and a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways and we're taking the denominational mind and approach towards stuff and the message approach sometimes we just got to cut it all off and stay in this field amen until my condition and my position changes hey man he never told her how long to stay in the field he says you stay in the field well what am i going to do don't worry about what you're going to do stay in the field happens within the barley season don't worry about that do what boaz said stay in this field follow these reapers amen stay with these maidens and don't leave it i mean what happens when we go into wheat harvest stay here reap in this field what happens at the end of the week harvest don't ask that question you stay here because the one who told you to reap here is the one who will take care of what happens after the harvest amen we ask too many questions amen sometimes we want all the answers before we move forward but god doesn't give us all the answers before we move forward he says move and i'll explain it as we go amen sometimes we're afraid to move out in the things of god because we don't know what's going to happen next amen but we're not going to be told what happens next we have to move by faith because boaz said move bo i said stay here amen and she's to follow the reapers so if the reapers move she's got to move it doesn't matter if she still thinks there's good stuff laying back in that field that she can get he said you stay fast by these manes and you follow these reapers hallelujah praise be to god so she stays in the field we go to verse 14 and boa said unto her at meal time come thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar i love this at meal time she says you make sure you come to church because that's meal time all day long you stress it out you you go behind the reapers and you're picking what's being dropped but at meal time i want you to come to the table and listen to what he says boa said under at meal time come down hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the reapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left now she is working in the word amen and she's grabbing bits and she's grabbing pieces of the word and then she's taking it back and she's sustaining off of that but boaz is saying something's going to happen different at meal time in between meal times you're reading your bible amen you're reading the message amen you're trying to glean and grab what bits you can grab and take it back and chew on it amen and make bread out of it but at meal time something different is going to happen at meal time you're going to sit with the reapers amen and boaz christ himself is going to hand you parched corn amen not corn that you dug out not corn that you used to rest but corn that somebody else dug out somebody else dressed and somebody else cooked amen and boaz is handing you threshed out picked up threshed out ground down and parched roasted corn and he's handing it to you and she took it of his hand and then as she did eat and she was sufficed hallelujah amen even in the story of ruth you can't skip church because we know that there's a supernatural element taking place amen it's not the man in the pulpit if there's a gift laying there and that man can get himself out of the way and we can look beyond the veil we can see it's boaz here at meal time reaching out parched corn amen giving something to suffice and sustain you in your labors in your work as you grind it out every day meal time boaz is saying here's some parched corn i fixed it i prepared it i cooked it you didn't do anything for it hallelujah who doesn't want to miss meal time hey amen oh i just love it handed her parts corn she did eat and was sufficed and left and when she was risen up to glean boaz commanded his young men saying let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her not and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not i looked up this word purpose and it was very interesting this word purpose means to draw out or to spoil or to plunder or to take spoil and so what is he telling the reapers i want you to leave i want you to drop a spoil i want you to drop a plunder for her and she's going to come along and then like somebody who's come across treasure and here's not she's picking up little little stalks with a little bit left over that fell behind and every once in a while she comes into a handful it's a spoil for her amen it's a plunder amen no doubt she's super excited because now to get this much would have taken her an hour picking and picking and picking but every once in a while amen the reapers are told by boaz on purpose amen drop a purposeful a spoil amen a plunderful brother benham says then in the kinsman redeemer then he went to the young men he said now she's gleaning for life what are we gleaning for life this is our bread this is our life this is what sustains us this is the seed that gives us life which is the word she's gleaning for life now i want you reapers you angels in other words that's what they are said i want you angels you reapers every once in a while to drop a handful on purpose oh my don't let it all be so tiresome for her but every once in a while let her hear a good message let a good power of the holy spirit cover over her once in a while to let her know that i'm still there do some kind of a healing amongst her show some kind of a sign or a wonder that she'll know that i'm in her midst that's it aren't you glad in your journey that sometimes there's a purpose purposeful left left for you that they've dropped something on purpose and you come across it and are encouraged and sustained and excited amen amen brother bam also in 1957 and the message questions and answers on the hebrews he says something else about these angels said the outside of you is one man the inside of you is another man so the inside of you is the supernatural the outside of you is the physical in this being if you are spirit led by god you become a messenger of god or an angel god's messenger god's angel is the very same word can't separate it god's messenger or god's angel so sometimes you become the messenger the spirit of god of your spirit let you become the messenger and sometimes you're the one leaving handfuls of purpose behind amen while somebody's working their way through trying to figure out where they are and how they're going to live and what what this message is and as they're gleaned through sometimes you're the one who leaves a handful of purpose hallelujah let's go on to verse 17. so she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that that she had gleaned and it was about an ifa of barley and she took it up and went into the city and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed and her mother-in-law said unto her where hast thou glean today and where wrought us down blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee so the mother-in-law could tell there's a bunch there where did you go where were you how did you get this much word what have you been reading where have you been going to church what have you been listening to where have you gathered in one day amen what's taking the churches a lifetime to come up with how to where have you been reaping where have you been gathering all this word amen and she said blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee and she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought and she said the man's name with whom i wrought today is boaz and naomi said unto her daughter-in-law blessed be he of the lord who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead and naomi said unto her the man is near of canon to us one of our next kinsmen hallelujah and ruth the moabite said he said unto me also thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest and naomi said unto ruth her daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not in any other field so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother-in-law so she was told to stay there her mother-in-law encouraged her to stay right there don't let them find you anywhere else you stay right here if you can get that much word amen from where you went to church today you stay right there in that field if you can gather in that message you can get this much life-sustaining word amen in one day of gathering don't you go anywhere else that's the field of the near kinsman you stay right there and it says she stayed fast by the maidens verse 23 until the end of the barley harvest and of the wheat harvest now this is amazing because when you first read through this i i would just think that this all takes place in barley harvest but it doesn't amen they show up at the beginning of barley harvest and it runs all the way through till the end of the wheat harvest according to verse 23. and this is really important when you look at the feast of the lord because when you come to barley harvest i mean that's when you're coming into the first feast of the lord and the first one is passover after passover the next feast is the feast of unleavened bread and the next one after that amen is the feast of first fruits where they go to the field and they gather the first part of the field to come to harvest maturity and they lift it up and they wave it before the lord before the congregation and that first fruit is barley it's the barley harvest so jesus died at the beginning of barley harvest then they went into then they went into uh the feast of unleavened bread and jesus resurrected on the day after sabbath he resurrected at the feast of first fruits when the barley came up it's a sign of resurrection but then the wheat harvest is concluding about pentecost so the barley harvest is the first three feast but the fourth feast fourth feast number four is the feast of pentecost or the pentecost means fifty or in the old testament it's called the feast of weeks 50 days if you count from from the day after passover if you go seven sabbath seven weeks you have 49 days and the day after is pentecost 50 days so they call it the feast of weeks so from barley harvest the beginning of barley harvest to the end of wheat harvest is seven weeks or the seven church ages so here for seven weeks why was ruth gleaning for seven weeks so that we can come back later and look at this and say there's the church ages right there she's gleaning for seven weeks from the first of the barley harvest till the end of wheat harvest until the feast of pentecost hallelujah that is amazing to me in verse three now we've come to the end of the wheat harvest so now we're in the seventh church age and we're going to move in to ruth resting amen a type of the baptism of the holy ghost and in verse verse 1 chapter 3 verse 1 says then naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not boaz of our kindred with whose maidens thou wast behold he went on with barley tonight in the threshing floor wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me i will do and she went down into the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law obeyed her and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near kinsmen and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou has shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning and so much as thou followest not young men whether poor or rich and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman so her mother tells her to go down he's winnowing barley and so the window barley is is on the threshing floor when they've beat it and they've rolled the stones over it or had the oxen trample it whatever amen now the shaft is breaking apart from the wheat and they do it in the evening when the winds are blowing and they begin to toss it with a winnowing fork in the air and the wind blows the chaff and the dust and the dirt away and the seed falls back so now it's a time amen when he's when he's gathering all the seed and then he's gathering all the wheat together and now she's going to meet him where the word is she's going down to the threshing floor and she's going to she's going to meet boaz amen on the threshing floor and where is he laying down he's laying down by the heap of corn where do you find boaz where the full word is when the full harvest is taken and the full harvest amen of the word has come back amen been winnowed out and come back it's laying as a heap on the threshing floor that's where boaz is if you want to find boaz where's the heap of corn you'll find boaz where's all the word gathered together that's where boaz is amen and naomi knew where boaz would be not in the house not not up resting he's going to be where the word is where the harvest of the word is that's where he's at amen she goes down she uncovers his feet and she lays down on his feet like a servant and he startled midnight startled he sees a woman he says who art thou i'm ruth thy handmaid cover me with thy skirt that's the same word that was used earlier in chapter 2 and we look at it in 2 verses 12 when he says the lord recompensed thy work and a full reward be given thee of the lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust that's the same word a skirt down here when she says cover me with your skirt she's saying cover me with your wings cover over me and protect me amen cover me and he says he takes his skirt and he throws it over her saying you've come under my protection now he makes a promise unto her and look at what he says in verse 10 blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou has showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning kindness to who kindness to boaz where did she show kindness to boaz it's not kindness to boaz it's kindness to naomi amen thou showed more kindness in the latter end than in the beginning insomnia says they'll follow us not young men whether poor or rich she's not after a handsome man she's not after a young man she's not after something that makes her feel good she's looking for redemption this is what boaz realizes when she comes to the threshing floor she's not looking for an illicit relationship because he said all the city knows that thou art a virtuous woman he's not questioning whether or not she's virtuous or righteous that's without question that's already been proved she's laying down in humility and she's giving herself to boaz not for lust not for benefits not for what she gets out of deal but she's looking for redemption amen and her whole motivation is redemption amen because the bride's motivation is redemption she's not here for the benefit she's not here for the program she's here because there's something moving her to this word to this christ it's the whole plan of redemption is now hinged on this woman and the whole plan of redemption is now hinged on the bride there's something motivating you on a cold day to get in a cold car and drive to church why because you want the parched corn that boaz is going to give you amen because there's something moving you amen someday you said i'm giving myself to this boaz amen he's been feeding me they've been dropping handfuls of purpose he's given me parched corn but now there's something moving me to give more than my time in the field more than the gleaning i'm going to give all of myself to him now she throws herself at his feet as a servant says cover me and he knows what she's asking and he knows she's giving she is giving herself to him she's giving up her life and her rights to anything else and she's giving it to boaz why because of redemption he said your kindness is greater in the latter than it was in the beginning your motive is pure your desire is righteous what you want is it doesn't come from a human being it's not a human desire it's god's desire you have to remember ruth was married before and she was married before she was out of the land but outside the land she could not conceive she was a married woman married to a man but there's no baby amen so so naomi has nothing for her redemption amen she's left with nothing amen but now all of redemption the whole plan is resting on ruth orpas already turned back ruth was married to the firstborn now it's all resting on ruth and whether you like it or not the entire redemption plan of god is resting on you and i the whole works amen he says you're waiting on god he said god's waiting on you amen boaz brother man said fell in love with her in the beginning when he first saw her in the field boaz would have married her boys would have taken her she was boaz's choice from the beginning amen and he went ahead and he was protecting her and covering her before she realized it he told the young men don't touch her he told the reapers drop handfuls of purpose for her he told her come and drink sit in the shade come and sit at the meal he's already covered her he's already taken care of her his desire is already to her he's waiting for her to realize [Music] he's waiting for her to catch a revelation god has watched over you every day of your life amen he's made sure the young men don't touch you he made sure they dropped handfuls of purpose he's given you water to drink and food to eat he's watched over you every day of your life and he loved you when he first saw you in the field but he's waiting for us to realize this is the kinsmen redeemer this is the plan of redemption and i'm going to give myself to it [Applause] oh hallelujah thank you god i say god let me lay myself down at the feet of christ and say i'm your servant you didn't follow after young men she wasn't looking for a husband and babies for her own satisfaction she wasn't looking for a handsome young man amen to spend the rest of her life with and some fairy tale story that's not her motivation here on the threshing floor her motivation now amen she's laying herself on the threshing floor she's been threshed out and she's proving that she's seed who is it at midnight that's laying in the threshing floor the original seed christ and his bride laying on the threshing floor at midnight with what all the word heaped around them amen where are we at when we came to him it was christ and his bride laying on the threshing floor the original seed laying there with the word heaped all around them when at the end of wheat harvest amen at the end of the church ages oh do you love this word once you see the message you can't see anything else once your eyes are open then you see it here and here and here and here praise god brother branham said in waters of separation from 1955 and when he laid down ruth noticed this not ashamed to dispose herself to this man as a real troop born again church tonight is not ashamed to dispose herself to the holy ghost call of god went right down into the barn with this man give him trust every man that comes to christ must forsake everything on both sides and put his full faith in the lord jesus christ no matter what your mother says what your daddy says what this says or mama says or what anybody says trust christ don't be afraid she walked in and when he found out she'd give that trust he throwed his robe over her you you won't have to tell you what that means the holy ghost of course to cover with his own robe so he covered her over and she was now covered in verse 12 it says and now he says it is true that i am thy near kinsman howbeit there is a kinsmen nearer than i tarry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsmen well let him do the kinsmen part but if he will not do the part of a kinsmen to thee then will i do the part of a kinsman to thee as the lord liveth lie down until the morning brother brim said in the message kidsmen redeemer now quickly let's get down to the end of it now we find now the next morning when she woke up she was happy waiting and the man came he went down he had another kinsman that really had option on the woman first have i got time to get to that well just a minute we'll get part of it anyhow the next one in the parable that had an option on you was the devil because you'd sinned and the first you belonged to him because you were his property for you were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and he could not redeem it see he could not redeem it so christ came and was made man to take away our sins to redeem us do you see it and the other man couldn't do it the devil couldn't do it couldn't die for sins because he was the very perverter that made sin see he could not he'd mar his inheritance the other fellow and satan would mar his because he is a devil let's skip down to chapter four verse one we'll come back and pick this up but let's read down here then went boaz up to the gate and he sat down there and behold the kinsmen of whom boaz spake came by and to whom he said ho such a one turn aside sit down here and he turned aside and sat down and he took ten men of the elders of the city and said sit you down here and they sat down and he said unto the kinsmen naomi that has come again out of the country of moab selleth a parcel of land which was our brother elimalex and i thought to advertise thee saying buy it before the inhabitants and before the elders and my people if thou wilt redeem it redeem it but if thou will not redeem it then tell me that i may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and i am after thee and he said i will redeem it so now the first kinsman the near king said i'll redeem it then said boaz here's the catch then said boaz what day thou buyest the field of the hand of naomi thou must buy it also of ruth the moabitess the wife of the dead to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance. and the kinsman said i cannot redeem it for myself lest i mar my own inheritance redeem down my right to thyself for i cannot redeem it now this was the manner and former time in israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man plucked off a shoe and gave it to his neighbor and this was a testimony in israel therefore the kinsmen said unto boaz buy it for thee so he drew off his shoe so now he goes to the nearer kinsmen and brother branham said there was another near kinsman that had option on you first and that was the devil because you were born wrong you were born in sin you didn't come the way you were originally supposed to come but you come through hybridization amen and now because you're born wrong now the devil's got an option on you but the devil can't redeem you for two reasons one he's not righteous and can't live a pure life so he can't pay the price but two he'll mar his inheritance because until the bride comes into redemption he can sit as a squatter on the land and satan's eden amen and he can sit there until somebody can take the redemption right somebody can realize amen that the title book has been returned back amen and i've got title deed rights to this inheritance to this word and he sits there as though he owns the whole world running every kingdom in every nation he doesn't want to see you come into position because he'll mar his inheritance i'm ready for his inheritance to get marred how about you because boaz has already went to the gates boaz has already come back and boaz has already told us the redemption price is paid and now amen we're going to take back our rights which is going to kick the devil off of his so let's go let's go back let's go back to chapter 3. amen chapter 3 verse 14. and she lay at his feet until morning and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor also he said bring the veil that thou hast upon thee and hold it and when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the city amen and so now before anybody can recognize what's going on on the threshing floor there's going to be a secret that's taking place here before anybody that can recognize what's happening i want you to leave but before you leave i'm going to give you a token i'm going to measure out to you six measures of this word oh hallelujah take off your veil you're the secret before anybody can tell where i'm placing my secret before they can discern one from another take off your veil and in your veil i'm gonna put the six measures hallelujah amen praise god and amen and he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the city and when she come to her mother-in-law she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her and she said these six measures of barley gave him me for he said to me go not empty unto thy mother-in-law then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished a thing this day so when she saw the six measures of barley amen she knew amen this is a token you just sit still and see what happens amen you see what happens because he's already given you this revelation of the six seals he's already showed you what the six seals are amen and he showed it in white horse red horse black horse amen and she could take back those six seals and she could show them and they could pick them up and they could touch them and they could hold them but six is an incomplete number so there's got to be a seventh measure somewhere amen because seven is god's number of completion six is an incomplete number so he gives six and when you go through in revelations chapter six you go through six seals amen but there's no seventh tier you get over to revelation chapter eight when you get to the seventh seal it doesn't tell you anything there's nothing to hold on to nothing to touch nothing to investigate nothing to roll around under your microscope it says there was silence in heaven for half an hour for about the space of half an hour you don't have anything to dissect you don't have anything to poke at nothing to prod at because there's a mystery amen the seventh measure is a mystery measure she's got the six amen and now she can investigate the six and look at the six but where's the seventh oh hallelujah so just rest if you've got the sixth the seventh is on its way amen [Laughter] praise be to god praise be to god amen now brother branham says in revelation chapter 5 part 2 in 1961 he said in what next thing ruth was ruth was rewarded that's what the church did it entered into justification under luther then it went into sanctification under wesley went into the baptism of the holy ghost in this last days and now resting with the earnest of our inheritance that we know that something happened in us we've passed from death into life and waiting groaning with nature for that time when we will receive an immortal life and immortal fullness our bodies will be redeemed everything's redeemed and we're just waiting for him to return back from the gate amen then what ruth was rewarded that's when we'll be rewarded that's what this seven sealed book is going to open up to us brother venom is here in 1961 and he's looking forward he's wanting to preach the seals wanting the priest to seals and he says now ruth is rewarded that's when we'll be rewarded that's what this seven sealed book is going to open up to us what when she's rewarded and how she's rewarded what is these things they're mysteries they're not wrote in the word they have to be revealed by the holy spirit but if you'll notice actually they are revealed all down through the scriptures but they've been hid from the people all the way back before the seals he's recognizing that it's all down through the scriptures but it's been hid amen so what brother ben was talking about he's talking about the seven thunders he says because they're not even road amen those those seals in revelation chapter 5 when they were broken amen there was a symbol that went forth and that was written down in the word white horse red horse black horse pale wars it was written down but when the seven thunders uttered he said write it not something that's not even written what is that it's the revelation of the seven seals not even written but it's been all down through scripture but hid but the seven seals is going to open this up amen what seven seals the seven seals on the seven thunders what was told not to write that part that was spoken by christ but john heard it but john was told not to write it amen that seven sealed book is going to open it up to us and tell us now hallelujah now let's go to chapter 4 verse 9. now boaz is at the gates with the elders this is chapter 5 of revelation at the gate the gate is the judgment seat of every city so boaz is at the judgment seat with the elders and what is he doing at the judgment seat with the elders he's working out redemption of the bride what's he doing in revelations chapter 5 with all the elders that are there at the judgment seat he's working out redemption of the bride hallelujah verse 9 and boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people you are witnesses this day that i have bought all that was a lima lex and all that was chileons and melons and at the hand of naomi moreover ruth the moabite as the wife of baylon have i purchased to be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brother and from the gate of this place ye are witnesses this day and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we are witnesses the lord make the woman that is come unto thine house like rachel and like leah which two did build the house of israel and do thou worthily in ephrataf ephrata and be famous in bethlehem and let that let thy house be like the house of pharas whom tamar bear unto judah of the seed which the lord shall give thee of this young woman amen so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and when he went into her the lord gave her conception and she bear a son now remember this is the woman who was married before who never conceived she was down in the systems and she was married before but there was no conception no conception but now she moves back into the land she labors through the land she goes through three stages of grace but in the fourth stage of grace she's going to be rewarded what is her reward what is her reward not six measures of barley that's not her reward the revelation of the six seals is not her relord what is her reward it's that mystery seven amen who's the seventh seal it's the one dishing out the six the mystery is in the christ dishing out the six measures i'll give you this and i'll give you this and i'll give you this and she walks away with six measures where's the seventh he's the seventh and where does she get the seventh measure amen it's after he's worked it out in the gates amen and he's come back after he's worked out redemption and he goes and he takes the woman and to himself in an invisible union amen and then he sows the seventh measure of seed into the woman into the womb of the woman and the woman conceives on the seventh measure of seed not the seed that you can touch not the seed that you can roll around in your hand but the seed that nobody can see that nobody knows about that's not spoken the third pool when you get to this don't explain it why because it takes place back in the holy of holies back in the private chamber with just the bridegroom and the bride is where the seventh seal is revealed in her and she couldn't conceive and couldn't conceive and couldn't conceive but now she's got six measures saying hey the seventh is on its way amen and after he works it out at the city gate he comes himself and he takes her himself and he sows the mystery seventh seed not something you can measure not something you can weigh not something you could put under a microscope it's the unseen mystery and where is it it's alive inside ruth it's not dead seed the seed comes in and finds a bedding ground the seed comes to a seed that's already laying there the word comes through the word that's already laying there life comes to life and it springs to life and now where's the seventh measure the seventh measure is inside ruth and it's alive [Applause] hallelujah once you see the seals you see it all brother brahman said when those seals were opened it unlocked the mystery of the entire bible hallelujah be to god amen brother branham says in revelation chapter 5 part 2 from 1961 as soon as he advertised who was worthy this is revelations 5. who is worthy he was advertising the coming of the kinsmen redeemer and here he stood a lamb and what did he do walked over to the throne where the spirit of god was at and took the book out of the right hand of him that sets up on the throne and all the elders fell down and said thou art worthy because thou was slain see and then he became his book or at least the book of redemption or listen to this how brother brennan words this i want you to catch this or the book of intercession in the church age was finished listen to that he's talking about that book that he's taken out of the hand and sits on the throne and he says the book of intercession in the church age was finished why because we've come to the end of wheat harvest we've come to the end of the feast of weeks amen now we're coming to the fourth stage amen outside the church ages in the bright age when the bride unites with christ amen as she receives the revelation of the seventh seal which is he himself at the book of intercession in the church age was finished now he becomes the redeemer listen carefully now the revealing of how he did it is going to be in those seven seals what is the seven seals the revealing of how he's done it through the church ages he comes to the end of the church age and he looks back and shows how he's been redeeming all the way through hallelujah now we notice like when the book of the mediator work of him was done got that the book of the mediator work of him was done the work was finished now in the first three chapters of the church finished but now redemption redemption is to be revealed what is it when he took this book now try to put on your deep thinking because we if we ever get to those seven nights you're going to to get it now now notice redemption immediately after his intercession was done for the church then he reveals himself as the kinsman redeemer when does he reveal himself as the kinsmen redeemer immediately after his intercession was done for the church he's not done interceding for you and me for the bride when he's done interceding for the sins of ignorance through the church ages when he comes to reveal the full mystery now he's not interceding for the church anymore when that's done he comes and reveals himself as kinsmen redeemer and as he revealed himself to you as kinsmen redeemer then where does that put us he's worked it out at the city gates he's been before the judgment seat and the outers he's paid the price now he's come to take his bride to himself just put in to her the mystery of the seventh sowing of the seed and now it's alive in her amen what's in her the king line [Music] amen the prince of the house of judah the coming king is in her amen where where did boaz come from boaz came from the union of rahab and solomon what rahab was the harlot couldn't conceive couldn't conceive living in adultery living in prostitution no conception no baby until she comes into the land amen when she comes when she leaves the denomination she meets up with solomon who's the prince of the house of judah then there's a conception out of her comes the kinsmen redeemer boaz who does ruth happen to meet the kinseman redeemer boaz ruth was married outside the land couldn't conceive amen because she has a predestinated womb for a predestinated time for a predestinated seed that's why you couldn't settle down in baptism methodist and catholic that's why you had to move out of those things and there could be no conception there there might have been a mental conception but no soul conception because you had to come to the appointed place because it's not for you to have six measures it's for you to have the seventh measure and the seventh measure is sown in the secret place nobody was watching nobody could see my brother brandon preaches the seven seals six seals details details who's included what this symbol means scriptures detail explanation of why horse red horse black horse explanation of souls on the altar explanation of tribulation detailed explanation he gets to the seventh seal and he just starts reviewing the sixth seal he just starts telling you everything you've already learned and then after he tells you everything you already learned he starts to break into the seventh century he says now i feel to stop right here and then what does he start doing he starts saying remember the vision remember the dream remember the sword in the hand remember sabino cannon remember sir is what time it is he can't tell you what's taking place behind the veil that's for the bride in him alone boaz and ruth alone know what the seventh sowing of seed is know where it's at right praise be to god let's go on verse 13 again so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and when he went into her the lord gave her conception she bear a son man that didn't take long it didn't take years she had already worked through three stages of grace but when she comes to this one there's a conception right away he's already worked it out he's come to take her now look from that point on ruth is never mentioned again in this book boaz is never mentioned again in this book something happens verse 14 and the women the women said unto naomi blessed be the lord which hath not left thee this day without a kinsmen that his name may be famous in israel they're not talking about boaz they're talking about another kinsmen and he shall be unto thee a restore of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age for thy daughter-in-law which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven sons hath borne him why is ruth the gentile bride better to naomi than seven sons because naomi has been without the son for seven church ages but at the end of seven church ages ruth when she unites with boaz is going to conceive on the word and she's going to bring forth christ again amen and that christ when she leaves is going to be turned over to the jews who's going to be a restorer of her life and a nourisher of her old age and that's why this woman is going to be better to her than what she lacked for seven church ages amen verse 16 and naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and became nurse to it that word nurse if you look it up in the concordance means foster parent where's ruth ruth is gone ruth took a body change and got right on out of here and now this redeemer that came forth out of ruth is given over to naomi and naomi becomes the foster parent becomes the nurse for it because ruth is not on the scene anymore now it goes back to the jews brother branham said in the revelation of jesus christ 1960 now when is the gospel returning to the jews when the day of the gentile is finished the gospel is ready to go to the jews oh i could if i could just foretell you a little something that's fixing to happen right here see right in this day you see it's fixing to happen we get it in the church age and this great thing is fixing to happen we'll carry over to revelation 11 and pick up those two prophets elijah and the moses returning back again for the jews we're ready for it everything is setting in order just ready this gentile message this gentile message as the jews brought it to the gentiles the gentiles will take it right back to the jews again and the rapture will come so what happened he worked it out in the city gate redemption he come down to claim what he has redeemed what is he claiming he's claiming the gentile bride he goes into the secret chamber and the secret of the seventh seal is unveiled in her and now the life of boaz is living inside of her and she produces and what does she produce a kinsmen redeemer she brings forth christ again and it's turned over to naomi and naomi becomes the nurse at the foster parent and who where's ruth there's no more need to mention of ruth now ruth has turned the gospel back over to the gentiles and she's off the scene see this is the same thing that happened to rachel rachel was the preferred wife of jacob jacob wanted rachel but he had to take leah first through a trick and he had to work us seven years and he got leah which is the old testament typing amen the jews but what he wanted was rachel so he had to promise to work seven more church ages for rachel so he takes rachel and at the end of seven church ages rachel brings forth a baby and that baby is joseph which brother branham said is a type of perfection which is the type of christ and after she brings forth joseph now the seven years are completed amen and then there's more things that happen but then they begin to move back into the land and as they come back into the land now it's time for rachel to bring forth again when they get in the land rachel brings forth benjamin and who's benjamin brother bam said benjamin types to 144 000 jews now rachel's a type of the gentile bride she's already brought forth christ at the end of the church ages but now she's going to bring forth benjamin 144 000 and how does she bring forth benjamin she brings forth benjamin in her death as he's coming she's leaving as the gospel is going to the 144 000 the bride is leaving the earth she leaves when benjamin comes and ruth is no longer in the story when obed comes the kinsmen redeemer comes from her and goes back to naomi the story is perfect now let's go to verse 17 and finish this and the women her neighbors gave it a name saying there is a son born to naomi i thought it was born to ruth ruth brought it forth to give it back to naomi there is a son born in naomi and they called his name obed he is the father of jesse and the father of david obed means servant or service he is the father of jesse the father of david now look verse 18. now these are the generations of pharas how did pharaohs get here tamar these are the generations of pharas pharas begat hezron hezron begot ram ram began amina dab amin and that began naeson neishon begot solomon solomon begot boaz where did boaz come from rahab and boaz begot obed where did obed come from ruth and obed begot jesse and jesse begot david without gentile women the line of judah would be dead there'd be no redemption back in the land for naomi redemption is tied to the gentile woman they end with a little genealogy in the book of ruth and the little genealogy is explaining the gentile women's contribution to the line of judah all the way to king david praise be to god amen let's all stand if we haven't been convinced that the word is perfect then we've missed something amen this word is perfect musicians if you want to make your way up to the gym if you could come i just tell your friends it's exciting many prophets and righteous men have longed to see what your eyes see and to hear what your ears hear and i just want to say thank you lord i don't want to be ungrateful but i want to be grateful that i can open my bible and i begin to read my bible and it's not dry and it's not crusty and it's not lifeless and it wasn't written for 4 000 years ago but i can open my bible and i can say yep that's talking about me and that's talking about me and that's talking about me praise be to god you want to know you want to know how to take somebody's attention off of the world show them their position in christ show them the revealing of the word amen when you recognize your position in christ as the bride of jesus christ and all of redemption is hinged on you who cares who wins the super bowl who cares amen who cares about this and who cares about that all of a sudden it begins to lose its attraction because there's something else that you're attracted to and the attraction to this is greater than the attraction to the world now you can beat somebody up and say if you watch that old super bowl you're going to hell forget about it amen you can't take the desire for something out of somebody's heart all you can do is show them amen where the heap of corn is and where boaz is laying and say there's the full heap of word and there's the lord of the harvest and he's right there and if you want him you've got to give yourself to him and go down and lay yourself at his feet and if somebody gets interested amen and they go lay at this feed they're not going to care who wins this and who does that and what's happening in politics what's happening around the world amen we watch the news because we want to see the prophecy fulfilled but we're not tied to anything it's not an attraction anymore this has become my attraction my life my identification this is my genealogy and how how could we not be attracted to it and love it with all of our hearts the bride is the seed is so there's no point in a bunch of extra rules what's the point amen i'm just going to show you where boaz has been telling his reapers to drop handfuls of purpose and if you can't get excited about handfuls of purpose then there's nothing i can do for you if you can't get excited about walking up on a whole pile full of grain then there's not a thing in the world that i can do for you if you can't get excited about knowing where boaz is laying and that if you give yourself to him he'll accept you there's not a thing a preacher a minister a counselor can do for you but if something in you looks at that and says that's what i want then just pick up the handfuls of purpose go to thresh in a mountain go to eating them come to church and come to meal time and let him hand you parched corn keep getting nourished keep getting strengthened amen and when you find out where he's laying amen go in at the heap of corn and uncover his feet and lay down and say i give myself to you praise god i'm excited i'm happy amen there's a frostbite warning outside there's no frostbite here i'll give a frostbite warning nothing outside of the messages will come to life there's your frostbite warning but in this field there's grain in this field there's reapers this is the lord's harvest he's the lord of this harvest stay in this field hallelujah there's no frostbite warning here everything is toasty and fine god bless you you all be safe on the way home let's just pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus you are so wonderful lord it's only you who can take your word and reveal yourself laying right in it lord you've been there all along lord but somehow lord we couldn't see but now you've given us eyes to sea and ears to hear now you're unveiling yourself before us lord and we see you now let us be like ruth lord who will lay ourselves at your feet and say take me i'm giving myself to you will you cover me can i come and rest under your wings will you protect me and watch over me and take me into yourself god we give ourselves to you we want you to have your way guide us lord in this life take us lord and have preeminence in us bring forth that life within us lord that we might bear the life of the kingdom and redeemer inside of us for we believe you lord we know you god we trust in you we just pray god that you would take your word and make it live inside of us that would be more than a sermon lord but it would be a conception it would be more than something that hit our ears but it'd be something that that brings about a birth in our souls lord and it begins to grow and take over our lives and become totally consuming to us that's what we want we give ourselves to you and ask that you have preeminence and take care of us lord and guide us let us serve you every day of our lives lord we pray that you would take your children home safely today it would be dangerously cold outside lord we know that you've got your angels encamped around about us lord and we just pray that
