[0:00] here's John the Baptist he's the prophet
[0:03] right
[0:04] he's standing in the water
[0:06] something is revealed to him he
[0:09] what is it going to be is it going to be
[0:11] my death he said this he said that
[0:13] you're going to be introducing the
[0:14] Messiah but what happens he's standing
[0:17] there in the water he's doing what he's
[0:18] supposed to do you see the sign in the
[0:20] heavens
[0:23] that vindicates the word
[0:25] he says it's my Lord
[0:28] Behold the Lamb of God to taketh away
[0:30] the sin of the world
[0:31] their first fold then the Lord joins
[0:34] them in the water
[0:35] the prophet said God and His Prophet
[0:38] becoming one there in the water in the
[0:40] word
[0:41] can you accept it can you see what
[0:43] happened they're going to say the the
[0:45] prophet is making too much of himself
[0:47] what what happens there that's not some
[0:49] story he says Lord I'm not worthy of
[0:52] this me baptize you Ace of a man
[0:56] revealing this son of man suffer it to
[0:58] be so to fulfill all righteousness
[1:02] amen Christ descending God descending
[1:06] and then he goes out and he's left the
[1:08] scene and he's finding the bride
[1:11] individually while the prophet is
[1:14] continuing
[1:15] and you know the prophet said
[1:17] and they ask why does the Brothers still
[1:19] talk about the coming after the coming
[1:21] the coming he says you see what happened
[1:23] with John the Baptist the Forerunner he
[1:26] introduced him he ends up in prison
[1:29] he said he's seeing what's happening
[1:31] around him you remember 64 when he said
[1:34] I'm it feels like I'm preaching the
[1:36] souls in prison
[1:40] is that the third pool I've done this we
[1:43] preached a seal something should have
[1:44] happened do you not see perhaps it's he
[1:47] in it's in that message he said the
[1:49] seven seal brings him back to Earth
[1:50] feels like the Lost party's preaching
[1:52] the souls in prison he says uh maybe the
[1:55] last one has already come in can it be
[1:57] you know this go read the message if you
[1:59] haven't
[2:00] I hope it hasn't
[2:04] he was John in prison
[2:06] and he said brother Ram says in COD
[2:08] question and answer he said that Eagle
[2:10] Eye got filmed over
[2:13] he said he sent his his disciples to say
[2:17] go and ask him are you the one
[2:21] he was anointed to be the Forerunner
[2:23] when he was not revealing the seals in
[2:26] their time when he was not Elisa he was
[2:29] still a seventh messenger the seventh
[2:32] messenger is always going to say he's
[2:34] coming he's coming he's coming because
[2:36] he was still talking to laodicea in one
[2:38] message you see seventh messenger
[2:44] it just depends on who you are
[2:47] when you're reading because when you're
[2:50] reading you'll have a different
[2:51] experience
[2:52] and then he'll be Elijah if you read it
[2:56] and you say I hate this man well then
[2:59] you're reading as Jezebel
[3:01] I can't stand him he picks on me
[3:05] and then or I don't like him he keeps
[3:08] taking everything oh that's Ahab
[3:11] right everything from me he's always
[3:14] persecuting me
[3:16] but if you're the bride it's Eliza it's
[3:19] calling it's a son of man revealing this
[3:21] son of man glory to God so you can see
[3:24] whatever you want to see in there but
[3:26] the bride knows who he is
