========================================

this is the same problem that started this whole thing saints in the garden eve tried to fend for herself let's not go let's not get so spiritually lifted up in our position that we can start that we can start deviating from the pattern and do the same mistake that happened in the beginning to bring all of this about eve stepped out and tried to fend for herself she tried to shift for herself she tried to make something happen because she didn't have a proper understanding and she didn't have proper trust in adam to fulfill this word remember the word was multiply and replenish the earth the the motive was not a bad motive it was a motherly motive it was a motherly instinct she recognized that was her position she recognized that's what she was to do but brother branham says where adam lacked was he lacked in the knowledge of how to reproduce himself so adam is lacking in this knowledge god has withheld this knowledge from him at this point in time so how can he give it to his wife but in that meantime his wife gets impatient and she doesn't have trust in him let's put it this way adam adam lost his job and what did eve do did she stick with him or did she go try to fend for herself think spiritually i was praying in the back before i came out and you would just have to be really i'm just going to say this you all forgive me i'm it may sound really blunt but we've we've recognized the last several services god is trying to say something very specific very clear um to the point that it's almost laughable like this is kind of obvious at this point everybody's saying the same thing but nobody can help it we don't have anything else to say everybody's saying the same thing but i was just praying in the back before i came out and i was asking the lord it's like help me not to miss it what specifically is this about everybody's coming along and just saying the same thing everybody's in the same vein everybody's saying this what specifically is it and i didn't hear a voice but just what dropped in my heart was this very clear i don't want my bride trying to fend for herself that is what this is about saints that's as clear as i know how to make it maybe we should sing him and go out but that's as clear as i know how to make it that is the point of all of this the laodicean age is all about that woman fending for herself it's wrong in the natural and it's wrong in the spiritual
