and greetings this morning and on behalf of the family and we want to thank you for attending this morning to have a time of memorial and celebration of this wonderful life that has been lived and given to us our sister lou mcnulty was a blessing to all that knew them knew her and to the family and we just want to thank you this morning for being here i want to give my greetings to you all and say god bless you i know that this is a very treasured life that lays here before us and so we just want to take a few moments in the word of the lord this morning to speak to you i'm just speaking to brother jim yesterday about his mother and about the gears of life that she spent here and i said brother jim would to be something that you would have to say about your mom you would like repeated to the congregation this morning and he said brother wayne he said i just i just wanted you and the world to know that my mother was a believer of this end time message she believed this with all of her heart that it was her hope and it was the way we were raised he said she kept us boys in line with it and our family and it was something that she was tied to and you know being able to say that this morning not just because of the profession but because the life she lived she was known as a believer in the heritage and the reputation that was laid was that of a believer so this morning as we gather here at this kind of a time it looks very dark but yet the scriptures say that we sorrow but we do not sorrow as others knowing that there is a hole i'd like to read to you this morning from the book of thessalonians chapter 4. beginning at verse 13 apostle paul says i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them which also sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god the dead and christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words i think of the apostle paul writing this to the thessalonians knowing that this would be the comfort to the church this would be the comfort to every believer to know that we have a hope beyond the veil that we now see i look at this generation in this time that we're living and i find that we are a people of limited sight when god gave us the senses of our body and our eyesight was given to us it was only to contact these first three dimensions that we live in of time light and matter so therefore our own sight what we see limits us to what is here this morning but in the generation that we have lived god has given a grace to to send a gift into the earth that we might be able to look beyond the veil with another sight by the sense of faith that we would receive a word of absolute truth concerning what lays beyond the barrier that we now look at called the curtain of time i think of this today as our sister had great faith in what she heard and what she believed her faith was just beyond a confession but it was yet the life that she lived and she lived knowing that there was only just a small curtain between her and everything she knew was true and real i think of this as she was one who received a believer of this end time message having received a prophet in this age knowing that according to scripture that god made a promise at the end of the ages that he would send an eagle a great seer as we would hear it in the book of isaiah it would be called a watchman that would be set upon the tower that could look beyond the realm of what was seen in the immediate this was a prophet of god sent to us brother branham was a tremendous man of god but the gift that he was to this end time church goes beyond the parallel of any of the ministries that god has ever given and because of that gift we have an absolute truth this morning concerning what lays beyond this veil i think of this this morning of this great messenger of how that he would bring to us these truths that he would bring them not just from what he read as i have read to you this morning but yet through the experiences of life through the tragedy of death of his own family brother branham suffering the death of his wife and his daughter had come to a great tragedy of his life but to think the one who would bring the message of what was beyond the curtain with himself experience and look into the to the dark veil of death and to what seemed to be the end of all of his hopes and dreams early one morning getting a call that his wife was laying sick in the hospital nothing the doctors could do tuberculosis taking her life brother branham just that young man running to the hospital 22 year old daughter the scene gets darker as he walks into the halls and his friend dr dare tells him bill she's already gone he walks into the room you remember the sheet was already drawn the darkness was complete looked like the end of all the story but when he began to speak to her he called her name and he said hope see hope was not in the hospital any longer but hope was beyond the veil hope returned from the other side and began to speak to brother branham beyond the grave and said why have you called me back brother brown the thing that you have preached the thing that you called the holy ghost that's what this is bill she said when you called me i was going down a great avenue and it looked oriental with great big birds and trees and the men in white was leading me and you called me back bill you remember when she told him what was there and then she said now whatever you do you raise our children in this way that you call holy roller or the way of the holy ghost this that's beyond bill it's perfect love it is the holy ghost it wasn't this time alone that brother branham would receive hope from the other side but yet remember just a few days later great depression set on him as he began to look at the darkness more than the light and then that time he had the dream and or was carried into another dimension and he met a young ladies he's walking along and he was singing about the wagon and the trail and and he a little young woman walked up and began to talk to him and she called him daddy and brother branham turned and looked at her and said you call me daddy and she said yeah daddy she said i was your little sharon rose when we were on the earth and he thought back of course a little six-month-old girl standing there as a grown woman calling him daddy he looked confused thought confused brother brown said she said to me daddy don't you remember your teaching on immortality it's always been a marvel to me because she was only six months old she would have never understood or heard what he taught on immortality but yet up in heaven they know what william branham teaches on immortality they know it to be the truth because the doctrine that he carries according to immortality is not a doctrine that he read from a book or just got from ideas but it's heaven's truth it's what really happens to a person when they go beyond this veil these experiences stacked up into his life to give him a confidence a truth to preach the power of god and the life eternal life by the realities of jesus christ it's when he was about 50 years old again brother branham carried into a little bit of depression and laying in his bed and the lord began to speak to him press the battle bill press the battle and he said would it help you if you could look beyond the curtain and that famous sermon beyond the curtain of time was given when brother branham put his hands behind his head and was carried beyond the realms into the sixth dimension and there he saw millions of believers running to him at first he thinking they were all branhams and someone said to him said no these are your converts bill these are your converts these are the ones that believed these are the ones and when they began running toward him he said there they were all young people 22 years old in the in the prime of life remember his explanations of it when they began to shout out to him if you had not come we wouldn't be here to think that that message had so convinced them to believe upon the lord that they were in another dimension because of the word which they had heard it was in this place that brother branham would would see that the theophany was a reality it was a real body he said i was wondering what we would be in that celestial but it was there remember that he said they embraced him and hugged him and there he talked with them and he found that it was a real body not just a cloud floating not just up there playing a heart but brother brahm said a real body just like you are this morning that theophany is a real body there's no babies there and there's no old age there and there's no sickness no sorrow but there is a perfect body a body that has been prepared for you according to the lord jesus and the book of john he said that he would go and prepare a place for you and come again to receive you unto himself that there would be a place or a mansion brother brown said of course it meant a body there's a body prepared for you i think this morning of what brother branham said when he heard the voice of him saying that brother branham when you stand and are judged for the words you preached if you are accepted and you will be then we will be received with you and remember he said what paul preached i preached and they all with one voice said we're resting we're resting on that that's the rest of every believer this morning that this message is not something that is a fairy tale or some figment of imagination but it is a reality it is heaven's truth i think of this this morning according to apostle paul he went to that same realm and said that he knew a man that had been caught up there and remember he talks about the translation and what he saw in the third heavens but when apostle paul said saw it he come back and said that he was caught up into paradise he said and it is seeing things that was not lawful to be uttered paul wasn't able to tell you the details of the theophany he wasn't able to tell you the details of what happened in that dimension or what it was but he did write of it a few words when he said in the book of corinthians that if this earthly house of tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens paul knew that it was there but i think it's amazing he only wrote just a few words concerning it but when brother branham returned from that other land he made a tape and he made sermons and he made books and he published what was beyond the veil because it was the season it was now lawful for these things to be released to the church because there was believers that is on the cusp of the change from one dimension to another i think of this today of god given us such realities and first john john says beloved we are now the sons of god and doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is when brother adam reads that scripture he said it did not yet appear he said but it's not it's not even been revealed he said but i saw it i was there he went beyond that grave and come back and told us what was beyond the realm and if we are believers this morning we have a hope that is far beyond the hope of just thinking maybe it could be but there's a reality of what lays beyond the veil this is the season that god released the great mystery of the theophany and our sister was a believer she was such a believer that the words of a prophet anchored in her heart and she rested that this would be her guide and this would be her life beyond this region i say this this morning knowing that we are living in a in a generation of of change and we're living in a generation of criticism and agnostics and unbelief but let me assure you one thing this morning there is a reality to the word which we have heard in this generation that's an absolute truth concerning what god has intended for his church it has been released in this season concerning the theophany but isn't it amazing i'm just rehearsing it last night thinking over of the season that we live in this great angel of revelations 10 this brother jim to reveal the dawn to reveal the mystery of what we're looking at here this morning and it was when apostle paul spoke of melchizedek as he did beyond the realm he just spoke a few words and then he said according to this he said this doesn't belong to this age he said but it does belong to them that are of a full age i have many things to say but cannot say them now concerning melchizedek but when brother branham came and spoke of melchizedek he made tapes who is this melchizedek this great king melchizedek he told us the depths of the mystery of melchizedek and it's amazing that the mystery behind melchizedek is that it was the theophany of god in a human flesh that the reality of theophany became a reality in this great end time when this theophany took flesh and met with abraham you remember just shortly before abraham's body changed melchizedek came to him and there was a change it wasn't too many hundreds of years later that that same melchizedek came and was known as jesus christ who was the son of david and the son of abraham the only two men in the bible that spoke of melchizedek and jesus was called their son that melchizedek became jesus christ is true and in the time when this milk hazard it came there was a resurrection but in the last days when melchizedek returns to the church there will be both a body change and a resurrection and we are living in the season when melchizedek has returned in the form of the word to the church of the living god we are not here blind this morning we are not here we are here awaiting our change as apostle paul would say who is it that can change this vile body whether that you fall asleep or whether you're alive you're going to need a change and there's only one thing that can change anyone and that is god the presence of god in job 14 job recorded this when he said if a man dies shall he live again and all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change comes when when the change came to job he was beyond the veil and he was no more than a teaspoon of ashes laying in a tomb but in matthew 27 when jesus arose job arose with him he arose in a body a real body amen because he said thou shall call and i will answer and thou shall have a desire work of thy hand i i believe this morning as we speak over this matriarch this daughter of god this great believer the gift that god gave this family to hold them into the word of life i believe as we speak over this morning that there will be a morning when time is released for that great resurrection and whatever the grave is it will not be able to hold her whatever that she has found in god will raise her up there will be a roll call and this time it won't be just for resurrection it'll be a resurrection and a body change we are living on the cusp we're living in the moments that before this service is out before this day is finished these loved ones could reappear right among us in this very hour friends this is upon us i i believe with all of my heart that there are people sitting in this room that will never know what a funeral is but they'll be changed in their atoms i believe the moments of the resurrection are around us i believe the presence of god is already filling the earth i believe the angels of the lord are here gathering us getting this thing ready i believe this i believe that christianity is the only truth there is i believe that there is a resurrection power that lays within every believer this morning that has received that great gift of god i happen to believe what our sister believed i believed in resurrection not in replacement i believe that the son testifies of my faith i believe the trees testify of my faith the flowers which are here on this on this morning on this altar they testify of what i believe all nature testifies that there will be a resurrection and nothing shall hold it from coming i believe that this morning i believe the great resurrection is upon us and i'm glad to be able to be a part of it i'm glad to know that the same creator that gave that flower life and gave the tree life is the same one that gave us life and he said he would raise it up again i want to leave you this morning with the comfort of these words this is no longer a mystery our sister is in a land in a theophany body waiting that moment i pray it'd be a comfort to you god bless you this morning if you just bow your hearts heavenly father we thank you today we ask you lord for your blessing upon this family lord upon the friends the great lost that will be known in their lives our sister lord as job said the lord gave and the lord took but lord this morning you gave a mother and a wife you gave lord you gave peace and comfort to a home and father this morning i pray that your word your word would be given this morning to this home to this family may there be words of comfort throughout the days lord whenever they think on these things lord may they be able to grain a comfort from your word now father we commit this into thy faithful hands in the name of jesus christ we pray amen god bless you god bless you family brother ray god bless you brother dawn brother john brother jim family as brother tommy said we go back a long ways i think we our family moved here in 1978 i think brother don you moved here in 79 or around 79. so we've known each other and walked this avenue of life together many hours i know brother don sister lou and ruth and i spend a lot of time together a lot of memories together you recognize that life is very frail life is very short you know you have young people sitting here this morning that you think life is going to go on forever but the most important thing to do is to have your life prepared this little short span of time has nothing to do or i shouldn't say nothing to do but it's it's so small compared to eternity and so the lord jesus has given us an opportunity while we're here yet in this earth to make a choice and the prophet of god said even the choice that we make can determine our eternal destiny so we thank god for the promise be given on to us brother wayne talked much about the theophany i was thinking this morning the other morning when [Music] sister lou at i think around four o'clock in the morning step through the veil we had a prophet tell us that that theophany came and picked up that redeemed soul and he said if we live to see the coming of the lord and the translation we take this body or this soul and go to our theophany we're so thankful for the promised word of god and i just want to read a scripture in romans chapter eight moreover whom we did it predestinate then he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified then he also glorified the prophet was telling us once you have to receive the holy ghost in your being that that has a seed the seed has been quickened and that seed within that seed is everything that's needed for this life's journey so in the foreknowledge of god sister lou was in that for knowledge he knew that she would be born in a certain day and he knew her walk of life in other words a believer the plan of that son or daughter of god is all planned out you know we we we think we got it we're running the show but we're not really because almighty god has that believer under control and so because we are in the foreknowledge of god we predestinate it to make it so like we have the foreknowledge of god here we have the destiny here and so in between here the prophet of god said we bypassed our theophany and we were we were here to be tested and tried and and go through life's journey and and making many mistakes but god almighty has our his leadership in our life and so we we see here this morning that uh sister lou had an experience of god i didn't go back with brother dawn and and to see what year it was and whatever but because she was a seed of god she had a sea that could be quickened and so when this great message came over this age amen it it spoke to her heart and drew her into the kingdom of god and gave her a baptism of the holy ghost and gave her a new birth and paul was john john was speaking to us and saying verily verily i say unto you except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god jesus answered he said verily verily i say unto you except the man be born of the water in the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god you know i think that's why many people are sometimes they're trying to believe they're trying to believe but unless the one that's the interpreter of the word leaves within you you'll never be able to believe but when you're a seed of god god knows exactly what you have need of at a certain time and a certain amount of revelation for that certain day to keep you moving forward and there's really no death to a believer you know this flesh this flesh goes down this flesh you know resurrection was spoken all the way from the oldest book in the bible job amen resurrection was spoken all through the prophets resurrection was spoken through jesus for he was the resurrection and then we came we came and paul spoke about the resurrection and timothy spoke about the resurrection different ones spoke about the resurrection and along comes the prophet of god and speaks about the resurrection in a deeper manner that we've ever heard we had the bible for all these years but as the prophet william branham spoke and said that we have a greater witness in this age of the resurrection we have a firmer witness of the resurrection you know the prophet and a couple of brothers were out fishing one day and they caught this fish and he caught this fish and pulled the entos right out of it and it so happened that the spoken word was now in existence and so he said the lord jesus little fishy i give you by the name of jesus christ your life back to you and you know there was all kinds of children and all kinds of cancer cases all kinds of sickness at the same time almighty god was showing that amen he could do whatever he wants to he could raise whoever he wants to he could take whatever life there was and raise it up he was showing that jesus christ is interested in the most insignificant thing in your life and in my life sometimes we think oh you know we don't want to bother them in prayer because it it seems so small you know what he's interested you know he may be going through something right here today you may be sitting here today and you think it's so insignificant and and and you know he's interested in it you know what he's interested in because you're his son and daughter you're his child this morning he's interested in your hurts he's interested in your frustrations he's interested in your emotions i say thanks be to god we serve a living christ that's interested so much in our life's journey that he pre-planted from our birth to our death i say glory to god if we can serve a god like that that we can serve a god amen and when you've got jesus christ in your soul if he says yes it's good enough if he says no that's still good enough if he says wait a while that's still good enough to a believer i was speaking about the book of job i'm going to read in the 20 or the 33rd chapter he said yea his soul draw near unto the grave and his life to the destroyers if there be a messenger with him an interpreter how many ways we had a messenger an interpreter one among a thousand to show unto man his uprightness then he is gracious unto him and saith deliver him from the going down to the pit i have found a ransom or i have found an atonement o praise be to god his flesh shall be fresher than a child's he shall return to the days of his youth i love what brother branham said you know you know almighty god he said took a picture of you before the foundation of the world and that profile can never be disturbed it doesn't make any difference if it's death by whatever manner that profile is always there in heaven so cecilia took a journey in life she was an express word of god for this age you don't have to be a preacher you don't have to be a great prophet he could be a housewife and be the manifestation of jesus christ you know our sister loved the lord with all her heart and all her mind all her soul she was an example of the vindication that this word is true that it's possible it's possible to live a life beyond the flesh it's possible for jesus christ to live in human flesh it's possible to be the bride of jesus christ redeemed by the blood of the lamb i say thanks be to god she's leaving the legacy back to her family to her husband to us as the saints that knew her that she's not here she's in the land beyond the river she's a land where there'll be no more heartaches no more heart attacks no more aching in the flesh but while she was here she was formed into the image of the word she was formed into the character of the word but the brandon said that's all we take with us is our character we're not going to take our jobs we're not going to take our popularity we're not going to take our money we're going to take the christ-like character that's all that we will take with us i think of speaking about the resurrection i've always marveled at this what the prophet of god said that jesus christ had more success in my ministry here in jeffersonville indiana than he had in capernaum how many believers remember that he's not talking about william branham had that success he's talking about jesus christ had that success that there was more supernatural done in the life of brother ranum's ministry than there was [Music] in the land of israel when jesus christ was there we've had a visitation like no other age has ever had i think most of us here this morning are believers and so when we talk about a message i think sometimes they think about the message as something different than the bible but if you really have a revelation of the message it's christ it's not william branham in fact in paul's day it really wasn't paul it was the same jesus christ so we are we as the five full ministry it's not really us but we're speaking the word of god which is jesus christ and so if i quote from the scripture or if i quote from the message it's jesus christ he's a living god he's the same yesterday today and forever you know satan really doesn't have anything to do with the believer's destiny you know you know he thinks he's going to stop you at a certain time and oh he thinks that's the end of you and god raises you up you may come to your deathbed but if it isn't your time just remember if it isn't your time you'll stay here but like the prophet of god said if we're if he's finished with us and if we're finished and he's finished with the purpose of god for our lives why would we want to stay any longer i want to dwell a little bit on that purpose and i just spoke about it last sunday at the church actually but the purpose of god that the lord has for you as a believer there's nothing that can destroy that yay through the yeah i walk through the valley of the shadow of the dead brother venom said now that's not a dark valley that's a shadow and in order to be a shadow there has to be a light right so the purpose of god nothing can defeat that purpose that he has because you you and i have a purpose to fulfill some purpose here on earth we're not here just to be born and die but a believer is the manifestation of the word of god she's nothing but jesus christ living in flesh only the believers of this message can accept that because it sounds like antichrist it sounds like you're putting yourself beyond jesus christ we're not putting ourselves listen they accused jesus he said you're making yourself god he really wasn't making himself god god made him god we're not really making ourselves the bride of jesus christ he said you are the jesus christ the bride of jesus christ oh my there's so much we could speak about this morning and talking about this purpose of god i want to carry on with romans 8 what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered them up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifies who is either condemned it is christ that died he rather that he is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also make an intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or pearl in other words danger or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord praise be to god i want to read a quote from things that are to be if you just give me the liberty he said the old earthly tabernacle here you know what it is this body is like an old coat that you wear a coat that you once wear but now you have one so much better you don't use it anymore what do you do you hang it in the closet before you got one better you got a better coat it's more up-to-date than the one you used to wear that's worn out what is that garment you are the inside of that there that garment only done bore your image but you don't need it anymore you hung it up it's a rag that's the way this whole body is you're it's bore the image of the heavenly yet it is not you you are inside of that body you the spirit of god is on the inside of that body that's what makes the outside come into subjection because the inside is pulling in see bring it in line with the word of god you're inside yourself your being this body is just an old coat and someday what will you do with it for you was only a garment for a while that is like the earthly garment this body your real body your real self is on the inside of that old coat and now i know he said william brown but i'll say sister lou mcnulty someday it will hang in the earth's hall of memory of you you'll put it out yonder in the grave and somebody will put a tombstone up here lives so and so it'll lay there for a memorial of you the people just seen you in this and what you was your real you was on the inside of that oh my i think brother wayne related to this but in closing out i'll be closing in in a moment but when all of those ran up to the prophet beyond the curtain of time and said my precious brother then he said another woman hugged me and hope turned and hugged the other young woman i said i don't understand this this is something entirely different from our human love and this is what brother branham said [Music] i don't want to go back to that old body on the bed remember he was translated he was taken up then a voice spoke to me this is what you preached that the holy ghost is this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it i'd say today if you're sitting here without the holy ghost you're missing out on the greatest event that will ever be to mankind is a resurrection just think sister lou lived beyond the promise according to the scripture by 13 years she was given those years for a purpose this is what you preached is the holy ghost brother branham was wondering about in the you know he was saying someday he'll come to you and you're sent for a leader and god will come and when he does he'll judge you according to what you taught them first whether they go in or not we'll go in according to your teaching and that's when he asked will paul have to stand that will peter understand that and the voice said yes and the prophet of god got so happy he said i preached every word they preached i never deviated from it one side to the other were they baptized in the name of jesus christ i did too where they taught the baptism of the holy ghost i did too and then people screamed and said we know that and we know we're going with you someday back to earth jesus will come and you'll be judged according to the word that you preach this and then if you are accepted at that time which you will be then you will present us to him as your trophies of your ministry how many believes the prophet brought us what paul preached how many believes that he brought us what peter preached then don't we have an assurance if we'll stay with this word i think we got a word that's more than mechanics it's more than book learning it's when the dynamic strikes it and it brings a life that's the reality of jesus christ that's the baptism of the holy ghost that's the fire of god that's in your bosom they'll bring you to a living reality that jesus christ rose from the dead and he's alive today and you are the manifestation and sister mcnulty was the manifestation of that word and of that resurrection the mainnaulty family i love you the loved ones that are here we love you we love you all in the name of jesus this morning because you are the family of god excuse me and one day we'll spend eternity together we'll spend eternity together let's pray together lord jesus what a hope we have within us we sorrel not as other sorrow yet we do sorrow i pray in the coming days lord that you'll be with brother dawn and

[Music] me [Music] well i didn't trip coming up there so i think i might be okay just want to say real quick just thanks to everyone that took time out of their schedule today the musicians and brother tommy he says we go my earliest memory where tommy was he slept on the couch a lot so as a little kid but how he did that with all the kids especially his kids now anyways i when this was going you know started happening it's like ain't no way i'm doing anything cause you know i'm just gonna sit down there and you know be me grumpy or grampy i guess but anyways my uncle frank had posted something on the website and it's like wow we need to we need to read that because he talked in the gym and it's like how many times that uncle frank was around all of us you know probably a dozen not even that but while he uh a hero really uh kind of struck me and then some other people had made some comments too that i thought you know you think you know your mom and dad but other people had perspective too so it's like uh anyways before i get all weepy here and had everybody sitting there wishing i hadn't come up here but uncle frank anyways he said lula was passionate about everything she did or believed as a child on grassy creek she was willing to enter into all the childhood adventures that the short children partook of and that was not how i remember my mom she was not a risk taker so apparently when she was younger she uh must have been a little bit of maybe that's what attracted dad to her you know i don't know yeah it is a miracle that some of us did not end up injured or facing worse she and don raised two boys different as night and day but all i can so many ways and i'm like wow he picked that up seeing us six times because yeah everybody knows us we're a little bit different but anyways and then it always seemed to keep things on an even kill and she did that you know jim would be up here i'd be down here or vice versa but you know they managed to keep us keep us pretty much in line and this is the one that kind of really made me laugh she had a ready smile and a ready frown if she did not agree with the person she was talking to and i'm sure my kids were on the receiving end of that frown i know i was and of course even my my cousins you know yeah you didn't want to you know as they called her mama you didn't want to get on her bad side sometimes but anyways and then she and i must have inherited that same squinting i'd frown from the assing plan so yeah we've seen that before too i know she'll be missed by all the grandchildren great-grandchildren nieces and nephews there are still seven short siblings to reminisce discuss and cherish her memory and we pray that we pray that we all have made the grade with our creator and that the ed short family will have a great reunion ever heard of in our future home and then don thank you for being there for lou at all times i admire your fathering grandfathering and humanitarian abilities so that summed up dad pretty good too so anyways i had just a couple of people on facebook i just was kind of reading through those and thought you know it was for people i'm guilty for uh not taking time and i probably should have over the years apologize in advance and for what i didn't do in the past but brother tim pruitt he made some comments and he said i will always treasure the times that i have spent in the home of brother dons and sister lou when i was ministering at true word tabernacle sister lou was a wonderful hostess may god give strength and courage for this part of life's journey so yeah mom and dad they they had quite a few different ministers in their house and their wives and you know mom she treated everybody the same pretty much then uh i don't know if i should change the names to protect the innocent here but um sister tammy i guess i'll call her douglas because that's how we met her but she's married now it's tammy mills john's so sorry for your loss your mom was a unique and special lady um and i responded to her like you don't know the half of that unique and then my sister and i were remembering my sister and i were remembering how kind and friendly she always was to the teens and she was i know thinking back we had uh when we lived on mills road our landlord built a pretty good sized barn and of course dad ended up taking over about half of it and we took up the other half but we had lots of lots of young people over the years and she really weren't you know she didn't like to have her house messed up that was a no-no but she may have grumbled and everybody left but she let us she let us have our friends over and i remember hatfields and davises and andes and pretty much anybody wanting to play football on saturdays you know they were there at the house afterwards then uh another family friend sulein shepherd uh i will always cherish the quilt your mom made for me she is a special lady and i love her and yeah the whole quilt thing i took it for granted growing up our house was full of quilts and there's i'm not gonna ask for people to raise their hands i don't i know they kind of become a hot commodity up here at one point but there was a lot of quilts out there and wall hangings and stuff so and then another sister i can never forget her big smile sister kelly coley and then a couple of my daughters i had i can't can't say uh do this without saying this sister sharon mcgrady this is on my daughter melissa i'm sorry for your loss you sure what looked like her a lot she was a pretty lady and yeah there was a memory memory a picture we had with my when she was a lot younger at a short reunion and she had the big old purse mom always had big old purses and she was sitting there with her leg crosses like my mom and it's like as long as moles is alive we'll we'll have mom also and then uh jess wagner i'm i knew it was just jessica holtz apple please tell me johnny i'm so sorry for his loss that's what she called me was mcgonnie they lived this down the road from us on mills road so that brought a smile to my face so anyways i just again thank everyone for coming just telling dave davis last night if if i could get out stuff like this i do i appreciate you guys coming 10 degrees yeah i didn't have to come you know anyways i'm sorry for trying to make things a little bit light but mom had a really good sense of humor and actually you know even with the open casket she didn't want that but you know dad we just you know decided to do it but it's like yeah she might come out of there and tell us to shut this casket you know don't have people staring at her and then actually we picked the casket out the first one was a had an ohio state it's like my brother that's the one we need and dad goes yeah she'll climb out of that she won't stay in it but anyways appreciate you guys again love you all and before i totally lose it i think i'll step down but again
