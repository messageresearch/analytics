[0:00] if the bride was in adam or eve was in
[0:04] adam
[0:05] and the bride was in christ
[0:09] part of christ really part of christ
[0:12] when god took made eve he took part of
[0:14] adam
[0:16] it's the same substance
[0:18] it's like when when when when when
[0:20] michael angelo had that little statue of
[0:22] moses and was hitting with the hammer
[0:24] brother said that was a true masterpiece
[0:27] because that was calvary and he said and
[0:30] when he was hitting it he was part of
[0:31] his knee was just flew away
[0:34] but you understand the substance of the
[0:36] statue
[0:37] and the statue of that little piece is
[0:39] the same substance
[0:41] [Applause]
[0:42] therefore
[0:44] we were reading what we were reading
[0:46] this morning he calls us brothers
[0:49] because we come from a royal family
[0:53] amen amen so so what happens is if the
[0:57] bride was in christ was in him
[1:01] and christ was melchizedek in theophany
[1:04] form in the old testament that means the
[1:06] bride was in melchizedek
[1:08] [Applause]
[1:10] and if in and and before there was
[1:12] merchandise it was the pillar of fire
[1:14] that means the bride was in that logos
[1:17] and if the logos comes out of god that
[1:19] means the bride was in god
[1:21] [Applause]
[1:23] nobody can preach you out nobody can
[1:26] preach you
[1:28] do you understand this message is not a
[1:30] sect
[1:32] cannot be
[1:33] cannot can because it speaks of the
[1:35] family in heaven
[1:37] it speaks of your theophany
[1:39] it speaks of modern membership and be a
[1:41] nice person here no no i was born to be
[1:44] a bride
[1:49] even if you leave bcf you still are
[1:51] bright
[1:52] or if you come to bcf you are bright
[1:54] [Applause]
[1:56] nobody can preach you out
[1:58] you are not part of a system
[2:01] your joy doesn't come everybody in bcf
[2:04] loves me
[2:06] your joy comes from your father
[2:08] [Applause]
