[19:58] wanted to uh say thank you to um the
[20:01] seab bolts brother Ben and sister Amanda
[20:03] for the picnic on Monday we had a
[20:05] wonderful time and we enjoyed that and
[20:06] we're always thankful that they're so
[20:08] generous and open up their home and
[20:10] property for us to crash their place for
[20:13] hours on them and also thank you for
[20:15] everybody who helped I know Elizabeth
[20:16] Brooks helped quite a bit and there was
[20:18] a team helping with that so we really
[20:20] appreciate that it was perfect I told
[20:23] brother Ben whatever he does to order
[20:24] the weather every year he's got to keep
[20:26] doing it he's doing a good job amen but
[20:28] God was certainly good to us so we're
[20:30] thankful for that before we went to
[20:33] prayer I wanted to give you an update on
[20:34] brother Mike Bower uh we've got a prayer
[20:36] request in here that turned in from his
[20:38] family but uh brother Mike was admitted
[20:40] to the ER last night and he's been
[20:43] fighting a deep fungal infection in the
[20:46] lung so it's a deep tissue fungal
[20:48] infection and actually U he was referred
[20:51] to an infectious disease Doctor Who's up
[20:53] in Finley so they sent him to the
[20:57] Blanchard Valley Hospital fin so he
[20:59] could be near that doctor so he's
[21:00] currently in ICU there uh right now but
[21:04] they tried a couple weeks ago to start
[21:06] him on a drug to to try to get rid of
[21:09] this fungal infection and he had a ton
[21:11] of negative side effects to that drug it
[21:13] was an oral drug and it was actually he
[21:15] was uh couldn't eat lost his appetite
[21:18] had all kinds of other side effects and
[21:19] he's been getting worse and worse and
[21:21] worse and weaker and weaker so he talked
[21:23] to the doctor they discontinued the
[21:24] medicine last week but he continued to
[21:27] get weaker so they they wanted to send
[21:29] him up there and they're going to try uh
[21:31] uh the same medicine only they're going
[21:32] to try it through an IV and see if he
[21:35] can tolerate that better so our brother
[21:37] needs her prayers they they told him
[21:39] originally if the fungal infection would
[21:41] entered the bloodstream it could be
[21:43] lethal and so we just need to hold our
[21:46] brother up in prayer I went up to see
[21:47] him this morning though and he's in good
[21:49] spirits amen he's he was really good
[21:52] he's at peace he said I'm at peace he's
[21:54] trusting the Lord believing the word and
[21:57] it's so amazing to see some somebody
[21:59] who's in such a weak condition and the
[22:00] doctors tell him in a dangerous
[22:02] condition and they've not been able to
[22:03] help him but he's at total peace and
[22:06] he's trusting God and I left there very
[22:08] much encouraged we had a chance to pray
[22:10] together and talk for a little while but
[22:12] I was really encouraged but just pray
[22:14] for him pray that the doctors the staff
[22:16] there have wisdom that God will
[22:17] supernaturally give him wisdom for what
[22:19] he needs what they can do to help him I
[22:22] pray that those all the staff are tools
[22:24] in the hand of God that God would use
[22:26] them to help our brother and also pray
[22:28] pray for sister Elsie and the rest of
[22:29] the family because it's quite trying for
[22:32] all of them as well so I'd like for us
[22:33] to stand together and take this request
[22:36] to the Lord together as a
[22:39] congregation and ask the Lord to
[22:41] intervene let's just bow our heads
[22:43] together dear heavenly father we thank
[22:45] you Lord Jesus that in the time of
[22:48] trouble you're the Strong Tower that the
[22:49] righteous run into and are safe Lord all
[22:52] the things that have happened to our
[22:54] brother Mike he's he's undergone it Lord
[22:56] but there's a peace in his heart there's
[22:58] a Joy that's about him there's a light
[23:00] that's still emanating from him even in
[23:02] a physically weakened condition his
[23:04] Spirit he says his spirit is growing
[23:07] Lord I'm so thankful for that for his
[23:09] testimony I'm so thankful that you're a
[23:11] friend that Stith closer than a brother
[23:13] that you're so dependable in times of
[23:15] trouble that you never step away but
[23:17] you're always there Lord we're asking as
[23:20] a congregation that you would come on
[23:22] the scene for by your stripes our
[23:24] brother is healed you purchased for us
[23:26] our healing you bought back our
[23:28] Redemptive rights Lord and God I just
[23:31] pray now that you would give to my
[23:32] brother that healing that you purchased
[23:34] that you would move in his body and
[23:36] bring that body subject to your word and
[23:39] may it line up to your word and to the
[23:41] confession of our brother and to our
[23:42] faith God I pray that you would move on
[23:45] the scene that you would use the doctors
[23:47] the nurses and all the staff use them as
[23:49] Tools in your hand to help our brother
[23:51] get him the help that he needs Lord and
[23:54] I pray that you'd watch over his family
[23:55] that you'd strengthen them especially
[23:57] sister Elsie you'd watch over she
[23:59] travels back and forth on the roads and
[24:00] that you would strengthen her and put
[24:02] your peace in her heart and give her joy
[24:04] in the midst of the trial God I pray
[24:07] that you'd let the light that shines
[24:08] from our brother affect all that are
[24:10] around him and may he walk out of there
[24:12] with a tremendous testimony that you are
[24:13] the same yesterday today and forever
[24:16] that your power is not diminished and
[24:18] there's nothing that you can't heal and
[24:20] there's nothing that you can't deliver
[24:21] from oh God let your glory be seen in
[24:25] this trial we love you we ask that you'd
[24:27] bless us now this evening as we look
[24:29] into your word I pray God you'd open our
[24:31] ears to hear and our eyes to see the
[24:34] word that you have for us in this hour
[24:36] God I pray you take this vessel of mine
[24:38] under your control and may you use these
[24:40] lips Lord For Your Glory and may you
[24:42] speak the right word the the the pure
[24:45] word and season Lord may it have an
[24:47] effect in our lives and change us and
[24:49] equip us and strengthen us that we might
[24:51] serve you better we love you and we ask
[24:53] for all these things in Jesus Christ's
[24:55] name we pray amen
[24:59] and while we're standing won we turn to
[25:00] the book of Deuteronomy and we'll read a
[25:02] scripture there before we seated also
[25:04] want to thank sister Lucy for the
[25:06] special brother Tom it was always always
[25:08] good to hear Brother Tom sing a special
[25:10] always enjoy that amen God is so
[25:15] good praise the Lord Deuteronomy
[25:19] 5 Deuteronomy chapter
[25:23] 5 and we're going like to
[25:26] read just one verse while we're standing
[25:28] verse 32 Deuteronomy
[25:31] 5 and verse
[25:34] 32 ye shall observe to do therefore as
[25:36] the Lord your God has commanded you you
[25:39] shall not turn aside to the right hand
[25:41] or to the left God bless you as you take
[25:44] your
[25:46] seeds I'd like to take for a subject
[25:48] this evening just preach on focused on
[25:50] Christ just a a simple thought a thought
[25:52] that I had um actually since Sunday
[25:55] since I preached Sunday right after I
[25:57] preached this this came to me and I
[25:59] started uh ruminating on it and and you
[26:02] know we look at Deuteronomy they were
[26:03] commanded just to do as the Lord your
[26:05] God has commanded you and don't turn to
[26:07] the right or to the left but they wanted
[26:09] to straight stay straight with the word
[26:11] amen let's turn to Matthew
[26:14] 24 together
[26:28] Matthew
[26:30] 24 and verse
[26:36] 24 Matthew 24:24 says for there shall
[26:40] arise false christs and false prophets
[26:42] and shall show great signs and wonders
[26:44] and so much that if it were possible
[26:46] they should deceive the very
[26:48] elect and brother benam picks up this
[26:51] scripture and he he tell he goes over
[26:52] this over and over again and he tells us
[26:55] that the deception in the end time is so
[26:57] great that if it were possible would
[26:58] deceive the very elect and the anointed
[27:00] ones at the end time he says it only
[27:02] lets the wheat be known to the elected
[27:05] which are part of it notice how
[27:07] beautiful this is brought in here now
[27:09] notice the anointed ones will be able
[27:11] the true elected predestinated Ephesians
[27:14] 51 or 15 rather will be ordained elected
[27:17] they are the only ones that will not
[27:20] that will not be
[27:22] deceived notice the anointed Prophet
[27:24] false the anointed prophets will be
[27:26] false and there among it will be true
[27:28] anointed how are you going to tell it by
[27:30] the word amen so so he says that the the
[27:36] elected
[27:38] predestinated ordained elected they're
[27:40] the only ones who are not going to be
[27:42] deceived but the deception is going to
[27:44] be so great that if it were possible it
[27:47] would deceive the very elect if it were
[27:49] possible so that means it's not possible
[27:51] to deceive the very elect and it's not
[27:54] that the elect are wiser than anybody
[27:56] else because that's not true true amen
[27:59] but the elect has been given something
[28:00] to inoculate them against the deception
[28:02] in this hour and what they've been given
[28:04] is the word they haven't been given a
[28:07] brighter intellect they haven't been
[28:08] given a stronger willpower that's not
[28:10] what they've been given they've been
[28:11] given the word and if you'll just trust
[28:13] in the word and not turn to the right or
[28:15] the left but just believe the word
[28:17] that's been given she's inoculated
[28:19] against deception amen and so when we
[28:22] when we talk about the bride can't be
[28:24] deceived we can talk about you know we
[28:26] can't be deceived and we can't be
[28:28] deceived and the truth is I can be
[28:30] deceived all day long because I'm a
[28:32] human being and I'm gullible and I tend
[28:34] to fall for
[28:35] deception I tend to take people at face
[28:37] value and believe what they say and I
[28:39] can be taken for a ride any day of the
[28:41] week but the word can't be deceived the
[28:44] word can't be taken for a ride the word
[28:46] can't be deterred from its course and if
[28:48] I'll stay with the word and if the word
[28:51] in me will stay with the word that's
[28:52] brought to me we're going to make it to
[28:54] the
[28:55] destination so we make statements like
[28:58] the bride can't be deceived but we got
[28:59] to be careful and we recognize that has
[29:01] nothing to do with your and I brain and
[29:03] our abilities and us as human beings we
[29:06] can be deceived as much as anybody else
[29:07] can be deceived you can have somebody
[29:09] scam you out of thousands of dollars on
[29:11] a telephone scam and you can still be
[29:13] the Bride of Jesus
[29:17] Christ amen you can you can get a bad
[29:21] car deal and still be the Bride of Jesus
[29:23] Christ but you can't be deceived off
[29:25] this word why because he brought a true
[29:27] word Amen to inoculate against deception
[29:31] but we got to stay with the
[29:33] word and so we want to look at that
[29:35] today and and when I say that I also
[29:39] don't say it in a way that somehow we've
[29:43] got as human beings the ability to to
[29:46] determine ourselves whoever is right and
[29:48] whoever is wrong and we just start
[29:50] calling out right and wrong all over the
[29:51] place that's not our job either our job
[29:54] is just to stay with the
[29:56] word it's not it's not my job is not to
[29:59] come up here and tell you everybody else
[30:00] in the world who's a
[30:02] deceiver because somehow I'm bride and I
[30:04] can't be deceived so I can call
[30:06] everybody out amen that's not my job my
[30:08] job is here to keep pointing to the word
[30:10] keep pointing to the word keep pointing
[30:11] because if we keep walking through the
[30:13] word it's going to keep us from falling
[30:14] to the right or to the
[30:17] left amen so it to me it comes down to
[30:21] some of these things come down to
[30:22] attitude they're true statements but we
[30:23] can take a humanistic attitude to a true
[30:26] statement and we can get ourselves
[30:27] Tangled up in all kinds of knots but if
[30:30] we keep the right attitude towards the
[30:31] right thing it'll produce exactly what
[30:34] he said it would right
[30:37] amen so in the message trying to do God
[30:40] a
[30:41] service he
[30:44] says and the Kings dressed themselves
[30:46] and set before him to impress the
[30:48] prophet and he's talking about
[30:49] Jehoshaphat and Ahab when they came
[30:51] together and Ahab said would you go up
[30:53] with me to take this land from Syria
[30:55] it's our land according to uh what Moses
[30:58] had divided for us and they were sitting
[30:59] there and they they had a discussion and
[31:02] Jehoshaphat said shouldn't we consult
[31:03] God and Ahab said absolutely I got a
[31:06] whole team of prophets so they were
[31:07] going to call the prophets in to find
[31:09] out they were going to inquire the Lord
[31:10] whether they should go up to take this
[31:12] land or not so they dressed themselves
[31:14] and set before him to impress the
[31:16] prophet and here come I believe it was
[31:18] zedekiah come up and the great chief of
[31:20] the district councilmen or ever what he
[31:22] was came up there among them he made
[31:24] himself two big horns he said I have
[31:26] heard from God th thus sayith the Lord
[31:29] with these horns you'll push the syrians
[31:31] plum out of the land Oh Glory everybody
[31:34] thought that was wonderful fine watch
[31:37] how close it gets to that Razor Edge now
[31:40] between right and wrong and remember
[31:43] it'll fall on one or the other side till
[31:45] it comes down sometime like a honed
[31:48] razor between the difference of right
[31:49] and wrong it's got to be every word of
[31:52] God not just almost every word but every
[31:54] word and it's got down today not to
[31:57] Lutheran not to Methodist not to
[31:58] Pentecostals but to that honed age in
[32:01] this age where the Antichrist anointing
[32:03] is so perfectly it would deceive the
[32:05] very elected they'll fall on the wrong
[32:08] side if they don't watch it like a wedge
[32:11] it's so now's coming it's come down to
[32:13] the home down time like like a razor he
[32:16] said like a wedge to where everything is
[32:18] going to fall to one side or to the
[32:22] other and when he's talking here about
[32:25] uh Ahab and Jehoshaphat SE ing uh uh the
[32:29] Lord through the prophets amen what
[32:31] zedekiah did is zedekiah took what Moses
[32:34] had said and he had got an inspiration
[32:36] but that inspiration wasn't according to
[32:38] the word for his
[32:40] day right it was according to the word
[32:43] he could look where Moses had divided
[32:45] raymon Gilead he divided this portion of
[32:48] Syria they the syrians had taken it but
[32:50] that was a portion that was allotted to
[32:51] them and the original breaking up of the
[32:53] land so that they could look at the word
[32:55] and look back at the Bible and say I've
[32:58] got a scripture for this inspiration and
[33:00] yes we should go up and take it and the
[33:02] Lord's going to deliver it the problem
[33:04] is there was another Prophet who had
[33:05] just been there in that generation and
[33:07] that Prophet said no Ahab you're under a
[33:10] curse you're under condemnation you're
[33:12] not going up to take anything you're
[33:13] coming down yeah amen and although this
[33:17] Prophet had a scripture he could go to
[33:19] and he could say did not Moses say did
[33:21] not I get inspired and did not I have a
[33:23] sensation and didn't I have a strong
[33:25] feeling didn't I have a dream and I had
[33:27] all of this but it was contrary to the
[33:29] word for that
[33:31] day and that's why brother said it comes
[33:34] down to a hones razored edge it's so
[33:36] it's so sharp amen everybody was
[33:38] rejoicing and the reason they were
[33:40] rejoicing is because what zedekiah told
[33:43] them is what they wanted to
[33:46] hear what what Elijah had told them is
[33:49] not what they wanted to hear but what
[33:51] zedekiah told him is what they wanted to
[33:53] hear and so now they had gotten to
[33:55] themselves uh prophets having itchy
[33:58] ears and they wanted a prophet to come
[34:01] scratch their ear to tell them the thing
[34:02] they wanted to hear and use inspiration
[34:05] and use the word and use all of that
[34:07] just to deliver a message that was
[34:08] already something that they desired amen
[34:11] but but now there was another prophet in
[34:13] the land Micaiah and Micaiah was a true
[34:16] prophet of God and Jehoshaphat brother B
[34:18] said had just enough God about him to
[34:19] know there was something not right about
[34:21] this he said isn't there another one he
[34:24] said yes but I hate him why did he hate
[34:27] him why was it that he loved these 400
[34:29] and he hated this other voice because
[34:31] that other voice amen didn't tell him
[34:33] what he wanted to hear but told him the
[34:38] truth oh God I pray that you'd give me
[34:41] an ear for the truth even if I don't
[34:43] want to hear it even if my flesh doesn't
[34:46] like it even if it makes me cringe even
[34:48] if it makes me feel exposed amen God
[34:51] just tell me the truth and give me an
[34:53] ear to hear the
[34:55] truth so Micaiah
[34:58] comes and he gives his report and and it
[35:01] was exactly contrary to zedekiah's he
[35:05] even told him where zedekiah's anointing
[35:07] come from but brother B said how did
[35:09] zedekiah know that his vision was right
[35:13] how did God Micaiah know his vision was
[35:15] right and zedekiah was
[35:17] wrong he said he checked it with the
[35:20] word what word did he check it with the
[35:23] word that had just come from that
[35:24] prophet in that generation from Elijah
[35:27] amen he said it had to align with
[35:29] Elijah's prophecy for it to be right
[35:32] yeah right praise God so both of them
[35:35] could talk about inspiration both of
[35:38] them could talk about Visions both of
[35:40] them could talk about feelings both of
[35:42] them could talk about
[35:45] scriptures but
[35:47] Micaiah his anointing was in line with
[35:50] the word for the day what God was doing
[35:51] in that
[35:54] generation this is where brother B
[35:56] starts talking this is how this is how
[35:58] the deception works it's not deception
[36:01] between you know the Bible and a
[36:07] bar that's not the whole Razor's Edge
[36:11] that's not the wedge where it falls on
[36:12] one side of the other but it's between
[36:14] the Bible and the Bible yeah
[36:17] right my
[36:19] goodness between A Gifted Man and A
[36:21] Gifted
[36:23] Man amen and so he says it comes down
[36:27] here to this Razor's Edge between right
[36:29] and
[36:30] wrong and so now he says I'm referring
[36:34] right back to what brother B said
[36:36] remember it'll fall on one or the other
[36:38] side till it comes down sometimes like a
[36:41] hone Raisor between the difference of
[36:42] right and
[36:44] wrong and it it's a wedge now that's
[36:47] going to drop you off one side or the
[36:50] other and it's it's pretty tight he said
[36:55] it means be the difference between right
[36:57] and wrong is not very far apart that's
[37:02] right
[37:04] interesting so the question then is how
[37:07] are we going to make
[37:09] it it's a good question because when I
[37:11] start hearing quotes like this and I
[37:13] start thinking about myself and my Human
[37:15] Condition I start realizing
[37:18] listen I I loan people money that I
[37:21] shouldn't have loan money to cuz I
[37:23] believed
[37:24] them I believe
[37:26] things that the news said or somebody at
[37:29] work told me I believed it with on my
[37:30] heart there later to find out it wasn't
[37:31] true at
[37:33] all what am I going to
[37:37] do I say God you're going to have to
[37:39] help me that's all I can do is God you
[37:42] sent a prophet in this day and you put
[37:44] something in me to believe that prophet
[37:45] and you've got to carry me through
[37:48] because I can't rely on
[37:50] myself but I've got a promise in this
[37:52] word and I've got to rely on the
[37:55] promise because it's really tight
[37:57] between right and wrong it's really
[37:59] close it's not as far away as we would
[38:02] imagine
[38:03] sometimes let's turn to the book of
[38:16] Ephesians Ephesians chapter
[38:23] 1 Ephesians chapter 1:4
[38:29] he says according as he hath chosen Us
[38:31] in him before the foundation of the
[38:33] world that we should be holy and Without
[38:35] Blame before him in love having
[38:37] predestinated us into the adoption of
[38:39] children by Jesus Christ himself
[38:41] according to the good pleasure of his
[38:44] will that's it friends that's our
[38:47] consolation that's our hope that's our
[38:50] faith that's our life that's our
[38:52] guarantee it wasn't me who decided it's
[38:54] him who decided it wasn't my efforts
[38:56] that made it he already determined that
[38:58] I'm going to make him and we read this
[39:00] again he says according as he hath
[39:03] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[39:06] of the world that we should be holy and
[39:08] Without Blame before him in love having
[39:10] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[39:12] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[39:14] according to the good pleasure of his
[39:16] will amen that's my promise that's my
[39:19] scripture that's what I have stalk in
[39:21] amen it wasn't because it's dependent
[39:23] upon me but it was dependent on his
[39:25] choosing before the foundation of the
[39:27] world and he already predestinated me
[39:29] unto adoption what is adoption in this
[39:31] age adoption is the destination that's
[39:33] the goal we're coming un adoption Amen
[39:36] to the bride will come into the full
[39:38] stature of Jesus Christ and she'll
[39:40] receive a body change she's coming into
[39:42] the fullness of adoption that's the goal
[39:44] that's the target that's what we're
[39:46] striving for and how am I going to make
[39:48] it when the deception is the greatest
[39:49] that it's ever been and it's the
[39:51] deception in the word it's the deception
[39:53] with gifted men it's the deception all
[39:55] around how am I going to make it the
[39:56] only way way I'm going to make it is if
[39:58] I'm included in this scripture is the
[40:00] only way that I can make it there's no
[40:02] other way for me to make it I have to
[40:05] believe that I'm included in this
[40:07] because if I'm not included in this my
[40:09] case is
[40:12] hopeless amen and you can't put yourself
[40:17] in you can't make it happen you can't
[40:20] will it to happen you just have to
[40:22] receive it by faith and say that's me
[40:25] when you look in the mirror you say
[40:26] that's Mama that's me me that's me the
[40:28] Bible's talking about he's predestinated
[40:30] us into adoption that's me I believe
[40:32] it's me amen I don't have evidence or
[40:34] proof it's me but inside my soul I
[40:36] believe that I'm included in that and he
[40:38] chose me in him before the foundation of
[40:40] the world and that's the promise that
[40:42] I'm holding to because if I don't have
[40:44] that promise what do I
[40:49] have
[40:51] Amen brother B says in Christ is the
[40:53] mystery of God revealed he said
[40:54] denominations won't never touch that
[40:56] it's a revelation
[40:57] she knows it so did Eve know it but she
[41:00] fell but this one knows it and won't
[41:02] fall she's ordained Hallelujah she's
[41:05] ordained not to fall she won't fail fail
[41:09] she is predestinated not to when I read
[41:12] that my heart rejoices and I say amen
[41:16] that's got to be the truth because if we
[41:17] weren't predestined not to fail guess
[41:19] what you and I would do
[41:23] fail Eve was Eve was chosen she was set
[41:26] in perfection and she she had the word
[41:28] and she fell amen but this one this eve
[41:31] of the last day this last day bride she
[41:34] won't fail why won't she fall she's
[41:37] ordained she's ordained not to fall she
[41:40] won't fail she's predestinated not
[41:43] to that's our promise amen that's the
[41:46] promise we have to look to that's our
[41:48] strength that's our source of comfort
[41:50] that's the only thing that can give our
[41:52] souls
[41:54] rest if not we're going to be nervous
[41:56] wrecks
[41:59] there's a story brother Brenham tells
[42:00] and I he tells it in several places but
[42:02] I'm going to pick it up out of the
[42:03] message Investments and Investments he
[42:06] says this he says ER Baxter ER Baxter
[42:09] was uh one of his campaign managers for
[42:12] some time said ER Baxter one of my
[42:14] colleagues a very fine culture man many
[42:16] of you know er a very fine able minister
[42:19] of Canada he was telling me a little
[42:21] story one day he said brother brandham
[42:23] we ride bicycles and said when I was a
[42:25] kid we could we could go downtown get a
[42:28] sack of groceries for my mother and
[42:30] never touch the handlebars on the
[42:32] bicycle he said and this company came up
[42:34] here named Schwin was going to give a
[42:37] bicycle for any kid who could ride a
[42:40] foot wide board standing 2 feet high in
[42:42] the air for 30 yards and he said every
[42:44] one of us knew that we could do it and
[42:47] said there was one little boy
[42:49] there we never would even fellowship
[42:51] with him because he didn't look like he
[42:53] know too much he said so we thought we
[42:56] were just a little a little better class
[42:58] than he was and he qualified or he
[43:00] wanted to enter the race too and said
[43:02] you know what every one of us fell off
[43:04] that board but him and he said he rode
[43:07] it right out to the end and got off and
[43:09] bowed picked up a swin bicycle and
[43:11] started to ride away and said we boys
[43:13] met him down at the corner and said John
[43:16] we want to know how did you do it he
[43:18] said well now boys I'll tell you what
[43:20] happened said I watched what you all
[43:23] done and I went another way he said you
[43:25] see when you got on that
[43:27] when when you got on and they gave you
[43:29] that push you were better all of you are
[43:31] better Riders than I am you know that
[43:33] said because I can't ride without
[43:35] holding the handlebars a little further
[43:37] down he picks up the story he says he
[43:39] said I'm not the rider that you fellas
[43:41] are he said I see where you made your
[43:44] mistakes you were looking down like this
[43:47] and trying to balance it said that made
[43:50] you nervous and you fell off he said
[43:52] when I got on there they pushed me I
[43:54] just kept watching the end of the road
[43:56] and held steady
[43:58] amen I love that
[44:02] story because they wanted they all
[44:06] wanted to get across the
[44:08] board they all wanted to get the prize
[44:12] they all wanted to win the prize the
[44:14] newwin bicycle so they everyone got
[44:17] determined and and it was amazing that
[44:20] the one who won was the one who was the
[44:21] least skilled amongst them all I love
[44:24] the way brother R tells stories because
[44:26] it's so much like when Jesus was
[44:27] speaking to his disciples just using
[44:29] Parables to
[44:30] explain and he begins to to build on
[44:33] this story and we begin to find out the
[44:34] one who is the least skilled the one who
[44:36] is the least qualified the one who is
[44:38] the least likely to make it across he's
[44:40] the one who got across and won the prize
[44:42] because it wasn't based off raw skill
[44:44] raw talent and
[44:47] gifts so they said what was it they were
[44:50] so curious how did you do that when we
[44:53] couldn't do that and he said you made
[44:55] your mistake because you you tried to
[44:57] balance yourself and you kept looking
[44:59] down and you were trying to stay on the
[45:01] board he said so I didn't even try to
[45:04] look down and stay on the board what I
[45:05] did is I looked towards the goal I
[45:07] looked towards the end of the line I
[45:09] looked towards the promise and the prize
[45:10] and I just rode fixed my eyes on that
[45:13] and when I rode that way I stayed
[45:14] straight and I stayed on the
[45:16] board listen this is our goal what is
[45:19] our goal my goal is that adoption
[45:21] promise my goal is the change in the
[45:23] body my goal amen is the marriage supper
[45:26] with the Lord and I'm just fixing my
[45:27] eyes on that goalen writing because I
[45:29] don't have the skill to keep it on this
[45:32] board many of them fell to the right and
[45:35] many of them fell to the left hey guess
[45:38] what if you've been writing on this
[45:39] board for any length of time you've seen
[45:41] a lot of people fall to the right and
[45:43] fall to the
[45:44] left why because they're focusing on
[45:47] trying to stay on the board trying to
[45:49] stay right trying to trying to focus on
[45:52] what's right and what's wrong
[45:55] and but I wonder if sometimes we can
[45:58] miss the
[46:00] objective get so fixated on making
[46:05] sure making sure I'm staying on the
[46:08] board correcting every infraction and
[46:10] and what they start doing is
[46:12] overcorrecting right getting nervous and
[46:15] then anxiety starts to enter and fear
[46:17] starts to come along and maybe a little
[46:19] bit of pride is mixed in and and they
[46:21] they start overcracking start wobbling
[46:23] and they can't hold it on anymore and
[46:25] they flop off
[46:27] and I don't know about you but that's
[46:28] been my
[46:30] experience not just correcting
[46:31] overcorrecting because I'm afraid afraid
[46:34] to fall off afraid to be wrong afraid to
[46:36] be found wrong afraid of all of this
[46:38] stuff when when when I was so fixated on
[46:42] uh uh is this right or is that right or
[46:44] what's this look like or what's somebody
[46:45] think about this and I'm not staying on
[46:46] and I'm going to I'm so fixating I can't
[46:49] even ride down the road amen what I need
[46:52] to do is quit looking down and start
[46:54] looking up and find out where's my
[46:56] destination and just fix my destination
[46:58] because I believe by predestination I'm
[47:01] destined for that
[47:04] destination amen there's this is a
[47:08] treacherous Journey we're
[47:10] on and you know who's going to make it
[47:12] to the other side only the
[47:16] predestinated you know who's going to
[47:18] you know who's going to ride we just use
[47:19] the analogy the parable of riding the
[47:21] bike across the board you know who's
[47:23] going to be the only ones that get off
[47:25] on the other side and win the prize the
[47:27] only ones were those who were for
[47:28] ordained before the foundation of the
[47:30] world and so we need to relax under a
[47:33] promise and focus on the goal and just
[47:37] set our face like flint and move towards
[47:39] the
[47:40] goal
[47:43] amen and the the problem too is when we
[47:46] see so many people fail can you imagine
[47:48] those boys who got on there and the best
[47:51] boy in town the one who could do two
[47:53] sacks of groceries and never touch the
[47:54] handlebars he makes it about 10 feet and
[47:57] boom he's gone and everybody else in
[47:58] Line's thinking there's no way I can do
[48:00] it there's no way I can make it and the
[48:03] second best Falls and the third best
[48:05] Falls and then the stranger from out of
[48:07] town who claims to to do it with a
[48:09] Willie you
[48:11] know he falls the most gifted fail the
[48:15] most talented fail the most skilled
[48:19] fail how long's been how how long have
[48:22] you been serving the lord 10 years 20
[48:25] years 30 years 40 years some times the
[48:27] most gifted
[48:28] fail they fall the most
[48:33] talented those that do it the
[48:36] best they fall
[48:40] off because it's not it's not what
[48:44] matters what matters is what I'm
[48:46] ordained to
[48:48] be hey you and I may be the boy
[48:52] who nobody thought had a chance
[48:57] hey if that's the case then we don't
[48:58] have anything to prove to anybody they
[48:59] expect us to fall off anyways so let's
[49:02] not worry about
[49:03] it let's just fix our eyes on the prize
[49:07] which is
[49:08] Christ and just keep pedling towards
[49:11] him see we've got a little secret that
[49:14] everybody else doesn't have he
[49:16] predestinated me to come out on the
[49:18] other end he ordained it so it may not
[49:21] be the prettiest it may not be the
[49:23] flashiest I may not be able to do it
[49:25] with no hands
[49:27] I may not have all the skill and talent
[49:30] I may not be the best bike rider in the
[49:31] world Amen but I have been predestinated
[49:35] to make it to the other side and I'm not
[49:37] on this a I'm not on this board to put
[49:40] on the best
[49:42] show because I know I can't do it and if
[49:44] I start putting on a show I'm going to
[49:46] wind up in the ditch I'm here to make it
[49:48] to the other
[49:49] side amen I know to make it to the other
[49:52] side I can't rely on myself or my
[49:54] ability or my skill or even my eyesight
[49:57] or even my handon eye
[49:59] coordination because that's what those
[50:00] boys were trying to do they were trying
[50:02] to rely on their ability and their
[50:05] ability began to fail why because they
[50:07] weren't relaxing they weren't just
[50:09] moving forward they were they were
[50:10] attempting to do it they were managing
[50:12] it themselves they were trying even
[50:14] harder than they had ever tried before
[50:17] amen and I'm not here to try harder just
[50:19] to fail worse I'm here just to set my
[50:22] focus on the promise that he gave me and
[50:24] just move forward and I trust that he's
[50:25] going to bring me there because he
[50:27] promised
[50:30] to he said in Hebrews 12:1 if we could
[50:34] turn there together there's a couple
[50:35] scriptures I want to look at together
[50:36] real
[50:39] quick Hebrews
[50:48] 12 Hebrews 12 and
[50:53] one says wherefore seeing we also are
[50:56] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[50:58] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[51:00] in the Sin which does so easily beset us
[51:03] let us run with patience the race that
[51:05] is set before us looking unto Jesus the
[51:09] author and finisher of our faith who for
[51:11] the joy that was set before him endured
[51:13] the cross despising the shame and sat
[51:15] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[51:17] God for consider him that endured such
[51:20] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[51:23] lest you be wearied and faint in your
[51:25] mind
[51:27] let us look into
[51:28] Jesus the author that means he's the
[51:31] originator and the finisher of our
[51:34] faith who do I want to look at when I'm
[51:36] running this race who do I look at when
[51:38] I'm trying to navigate through life and
[51:40] make it from one end of life to the
[51:41] other without falling in the ditch to
[51:43] the right hand or to the left where
[51:45] should I put my eyes amen it shouldn't
[51:47] be on the right hand or on the
[51:49] left I tell you I I I'm not known for
[51:52] being the most U focused driver in the
[51:55] whole world
[51:57] cuz I like to see the deer in the fields
[51:58] in the house and this and that and this
[52:00] and that and every once in a while we
[52:02] feel the rumble
[52:04] strips thank God for rumble strips they'
[52:06] probably saved Our
[52:09] Lives amen because as soon as I start
[52:11] looking over here guess where I drive
[52:14] over here and when I start looking over
[52:16] here guess where I drive over here and
[52:18] for years I would get so frustrated
[52:19] because I would tell my wife I'd say hey
[52:21] look at that deer out there and I would
[52:23] look over and I would tell she's not
[52:24] looking
[52:27] and I get more animated look look look
[52:29] but she's staring down the road because
[52:30] she knows one of us have to be watching
[52:32] the
[52:34] road or we're going to wind up in the
[52:36] ditch so she started she made a deal
[52:38] with me she says you look at the road
[52:40] and I'll look at the
[52:42] deer I still don't think she looked at
[52:44] the deer I think she was just faking me
[52:47] out but the reality is yes people fall
[52:50] away yes there's D in the ditch yes
[52:52] there's train wrecks all over the place
[52:54] amen this isn't like this is a clean
[52:56] Journey with no wrecks it's not like
[52:58] everybody who come into the message is
[53:00] going to make it to the destination
[53:01] there's many people who identify with
[53:03] the word for many different reasons amen
[53:06] and we have to be we have to be willing
[53:07] to accept that it doesn't always work
[53:09] the way we think it's going to work and
[53:11] and not everybody is who they think that
[53:13] they are who claim to be and there's
[53:15] train wrecks
[53:17] everywhere and the longer that you serve
[53:19] the Lord the longer you walk this you'll
[53:20] find train wrecks all over the place but
[53:22] if I focus on the one who just fell in
[53:24] the ditch I'm going to feel the rumble
[53:26] strips in just a few minutes amen and
[53:28] worse I may go beyond that amen I've got
[53:30] to keep my Focus On Christ the author
[53:33] and finisher of my faith for he's the
[53:35] one that's drawing me to himself he's my
[53:37] destination he's my goal if 10,000 fall
[53:40] on my right and thousands fall on my
[53:42] left amen it's not going to change his
[53:44] word for
[53:46] me and I can't let that amen distract me
[53:49] and I can't let that frighten me because
[53:51] he's got a purpose in my life and
[53:53] there's a destination in my life and
[53:55] unless I F focus on that I'm going to
[53:57] find up I'm going to find myself
[53:59] derailed somewhere along the way now
[54:01] let's go to Hebrews chapter
[54:05] 3 Hebrews chapter
[54:11] 3 verse 14 Hebrews
[54:15] 3:4 says for we are made partakers of
[54:18] Christ if we hold the beginning of our
[54:20] confidence steadfast unto the end you
[54:23] know what that means you got to get on
[54:25] the board and you got to ride all the
[54:26] way to the other
[54:27] end amen that's what we got to do let's
[54:31] turn back to Matthew
[54:44] 24 Matthew
[54:52] 24 Matthew 24:13 but he that shall
[54:55] endure unto the the end the same shall
[54:57] be saved and was he saying again I've
[55:00] got to make it to the
[55:02] end I have got to make it to the end he
[55:05] who maketh to the end shall be saved he
[55:07] who maketh to the end gets the promise
[55:08] I've got to make it to the End Amen how
[55:10] am I going to make it to the end the
[55:12] only way I know of is the example
[55:14] brother B gave us in this little Parable
[55:16] is I've got to set my eyes Amen on the
[55:19] author and finisher of my faith and I've
[55:21] got to keep riding towards the promise
[55:23] that he promised me amen or I'm never
[55:25] going to win this
[55:27] surprise there's distractions all along
[55:29] the way and there's wrecks all along the
[55:32] way brother B said there's several
[55:34] quotes I'm going to read that says the
[55:36] same thing in different ways he says
[55:38] this is from 52 he says so you can just
[55:40] get a little too far on either side of
[55:42] the road don't you believe so I believe
[55:45] in an old-fashioned gonet message right
[55:47] straight down the middle of the road the
[55:49] isms is on both sides that's right he
[55:52] said there'll be a highway and a lot of
[55:54] people says that's the Highway of
[55:55] Holiness
[55:56] he says the Bible said there shall be a
[55:59] highway and he says and is a conjunction
[56:02] and a way and it shall be called the way
[56:05] of Holiness not the highway the way of
[56:07] Holiness that's the middle of the road
[56:10] the way in the highway so that comes
[56:14] from Isaiah 358 and Isaiah 358 says and
[56:17] a highway shall be there and a way and
[56:21] it shall be called the way of Holiness
[56:23] so brother M's telling us that that way
[56:25] he said there'll be a Highway and a way
[56:28] that should be the way of Holiness and
[56:29] he says people often say the Highway of
[56:31] Holiness but he said it's not the
[56:32] Highway of Holiness he says there's a
[56:34] highway and a way and he said the way is
[56:38] the middle of the
[56:39] road so now he's going to tell us what
[56:41] is this way of Holiness the way of
[56:43] Holiness is dead centner in the word of
[56:46] God Amen that's what he begins to teach
[56:48] us and tell us let's go to Matthew 7
[56:51] while we're here in Matthew
[57:02] Matthew chapter
[57:05] 7 let's look at verse
[57:09] 13 says enter you in at the Straight
[57:12] Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is
[57:13] the way that leadth to destruction and
[57:16] many there be which go there at because
[57:17] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[57:19] way which leadth into life and few there
[57:22] be that find
[57:23] it men the middle of the
[57:27] road he says in this next message in 54
[57:31] God who has provided away says friends
[57:33] I've always tried to keep a balance of
[57:34] the road you get way off on formalism
[57:37] you're just as formal and ritualistic as
[57:39] they can be people grab for that a lot
[57:42] then if you don't watch you'll get Plum
[57:44] off over on the other side and just as
[57:46] fanatic as you can be but there's a
[57:49] middle of the road where the true sound
[57:51] s gospel is preached and God moves in
[57:54] there vindicating the truth straight As
[57:56] the gate and narrow is the way but few
[57:58] there be that find
[57:59] it brother B's going to start talking as
[58:02] I go through this he's going to start
[58:03] talking about how we get off the road on
[58:05] the right and to the left and and he's
[58:07] not talking about sinful things like
[58:10] drinking and smoking and gambling that's
[58:12] not what he's talking about he's talking
[58:14] about cold formalism and
[58:16] fanaticism he's talking about taking the
[58:18] word and going either way with the word
[58:20] of God and we get off this road and we
[58:23] get wrecked up and we fall off but he
[58:25] said the true the way of of Holiness is
[58:27] the middle of the
[58:28] road right in 1955 Redeemer Redemption
[58:32] he says look stay where you are every
[58:34] man that's born of the spirit of God
[58:36] when he's set in Christ his eyes is on
[58:38] Calvary right in the middle of the road
[58:41] if he's just a little bit emotional the
[58:43] first thing you know he'll work out over
[58:45] here to a side and the first thing he'll
[58:47] become a fanatic if he don't watch and
[58:49] if he's just a little bit starchy
[58:51] educated he'll work over on this side
[58:54] and be so cold and stiff and starchy
[58:56] take all the spirit out of him if the
[58:59] devil can't keep you from seeing the
[59:00] truth he'll push you off the deep end
[59:03] with
[59:04] it which deepen
[59:08] either if he can't stop you from
[59:11] recognizing that this word and this
[59:12] message is the truth what he'll try to
[59:14] do is push you off the road one way or
[59:16] the other right e the cold starchy
[59:19] formal has no spirit in it or all
[59:21] spiritual moving into fanaticism and
[59:23] Sensations and get off the word and
[59:25] either way you wind up train wrecked
[59:28] along the way amen because if he can't
[59:30] get you to deny the word he'll get you
[59:32] to go too far in one of these two
[59:37] directions now in the message Hebrews
[59:39] chapter 1 from 57 now he says now on
[59:42] this side when people get converted
[59:43] their minds is set right on Christ and
[59:46] if they're just a little scholarly and
[59:48] don't keep under prayer they'll get real
[59:50] cold and stiff and starchy and
[59:52] indifferent and then if they're just a
[59:54] little bit nervous if you you don't
[59:56] watch they'll just get radical and Wild
[59:58] on this side see they go into Sensations
[1:00:00] and everything now but the real church
[1:00:03] is a real saying gospel right in the
[1:00:06] middle of the road it's not cold and
[1:00:09] starchy neither is it fanaticism now
[1:00:12] listen to this sentence listen to this
[1:00:13] sentence it's a real good old warm
[1:00:17] gospel heartfelt love of God going right
[1:00:21] down the middle of the road calling from
[1:00:23] both sides amen
[1:00:26] it's not wild and following every
[1:00:28] passion and every sensation and every
[1:00:30] dream and every vision and everything
[1:00:33] whether it's in the word or not in the
[1:00:34] word or can be confirmed and validated
[1:00:36] or not we just follow after it anyways
[1:00:38] neither is it so stiff and so formal
[1:00:40] that we don't allow God to move and we
[1:00:42] don't believe anything that we don't
[1:00:46] see but the truth the way of Holiness is
[1:00:49] right down the middle of the
[1:00:52] road and it's
[1:00:54] a it's a good old warm gospel heartfelt
[1:01:00] love of
[1:01:01] God it isn't this cold side that says I
[1:01:05] believe the message I know the doctrines
[1:01:06] I got it right I'm part of the Bride but
[1:01:08] has no good warm heartfelt love for
[1:01:16] God
[1:01:19] Amen we got to go right down the middle
[1:01:21] of the road calling from both sides
[1:01:26] oh I love this
[1:01:27] friends because what happens is both
[1:01:30] sides leave the word one way or
[1:01:33] another yes we we we either leave the
[1:01:37] word to follow after whatever feels
[1:01:41] good are we leave the word because we
[1:01:43] have no more feeling no more compassion
[1:01:45] no more feeling for people no more
[1:01:46] desire for Souls no and we can become
[1:01:49] super legalistic and rigid and have no
[1:01:51] more love and no more desire and no more
[1:01:53] tears streaming down our face
[1:01:57] yes but somewhere in the middle these
[1:01:59] two things come
[1:02:01] together you stay with the word and you
[1:02:03] have the truth and your heart is warmed
[1:02:05] by the love of
[1:02:08] God
[1:02:11] Amen let's turn together to Philippians
[1:02:14] chapter 3
[1:02:35] Philippians chapter
[1:02:39] 3 in verse 12 Philippians 3 and
[1:02:43] 12 says not as though I had already
[1:02:46] attained either were already perfect but
[1:02:48] I follow after if that I may apprehend
[1:02:51] that for which also I'm apprehended of
[1:02:53] Christ Jesus Brethren I count count not
[1:02:56] myself to have apprehended but this one
[1:02:57] thing I do forgetting those things which
[1:02:59] are behind and reaching forth into those
[1:03:01] things which are before I press toward
[1:03:03] the mark for the prize of the High
[1:03:05] Calling of God in Christ
[1:03:08] Jesus Apostle Paul was pressing towards
[1:03:11] a Mark that word Mark is a goal or a
[1:03:14] destination and he was had a mark fixed
[1:03:17] and he was pressing towards the mark and
[1:03:19] that Mark was the high calling of God in
[1:03:22] Christ Jesus amen he was predestinated
[1:03:24] for it he was moving for it amen he was
[1:03:27] destined for it and around Paul all
[1:03:30] kinds of travesties happened all kinds
[1:03:33] of backslidings and grumblings and
[1:03:35] fightings and disputings and and and all
[1:03:38] kinds of things happened all around him
[1:03:40] but he had already set his Mark amen and
[1:03:43] he was already pressing towards that
[1:03:44] Mark and none of these things could stop
[1:03:46] him from pressing towards that Mark
[1:03:48] because he had already set his
[1:03:50] goal there is a ton of distractions
[1:03:52] let's just say this way there's a lot of
[1:03:54] distractions around the Apostle Paul
[1:03:56] yeah a lot of discouraging things
[1:03:58] happened around the Apostle Paul amen he
[1:04:00] was discouraged by Fallout from Brethren
[1:04:03] he was discouraged by the judaizers
[1:04:05] coming from Jerusalem following him
[1:04:06] everywhere he went and then talking
[1:04:08] behind his back and trying to pull
[1:04:10] disciples away he was discouraged by
[1:04:13] Deus who left him he was discouraged by
[1:04:15] his split with Barnabas he was
[1:04:16] discouraged by a whole lot of things but
[1:04:18] he set them he set his face towards the
[1:04:20] mark of the High Calling of God and he
[1:04:22] kept moving on Amen I mean we can get
[1:04:25] discour wores about a lot of things and
[1:04:26] there's a lot of things to get
[1:04:27] discouraged about and there's a lot of
[1:04:28] things to get distracted with am mean we
[1:04:30] have Brethren who fall away we have
[1:04:32] other things that we disagree with we
[1:04:34] have doctrinal issues and listen
[1:04:35] Doctrine is not a dirty
[1:04:38] word it's a gospel word amen Doctrine is
[1:04:42] the covering of the tree that holds the
[1:04:43] life inside without Doctrine you can't
[1:04:45] hold the life in so Doctrine is glorious
[1:04:48] Doctrine is God's Gift amen the word is
[1:04:51] given for Doctrine amen and instruction
[1:04:52] in righteousness we need doctrine we
[1:04:54] love Doctrine Doctrine is Godly Doctrine
[1:04:57] is good but Doctrine wasn't given to us
[1:05:00] to divide us so we can fight it was
[1:05:02] there to keep the life in the tree right
[1:05:04] Doctrine was there to protect and guard
[1:05:06] The Life of Christ it wasn't something
[1:05:08] to argue about and it wasn't something
[1:05:11] for strife and it wasn't something for
[1:05:13] debate and it wasn't given for
[1:05:14] separation it was actually given to hold
[1:05:16] the life
[1:05:18] in so we love Doctrine yeah but I'm not
[1:05:22] going to take something So Glorious and
[1:05:24] turn it into a sword just to fight
[1:05:26] another brother I'm going to leave
[1:05:28] Doctrine as the covering for the tree
[1:05:29] and thank God for it amen and keep
[1:05:31] moving forward and if somebody else has
[1:05:33] different Doctrine that's okay that's
[1:05:35] not a problem amen but what God has
[1:05:37] given me is holding the life inside amen
[1:05:41] right keeping the little suck sap sucker
[1:05:44] from getting in and sucking the life out
[1:05:46] of
[1:05:47] it amen but we've had different
[1:05:50] doctrines and disputes and all kinds of
[1:05:52] things that get but that's not why God
[1:05:54] gave it Doctrine is something that's God
[1:05:56] given was Doctrine restored in the end
[1:05:58] time yes the truths were restored the
[1:06:01] doctrine came back the true teaching of
[1:06:03] the Apostles was here amen why to bring
[1:06:06] back the brid
[1:06:08] tree it wasn't given to us to separate
[1:06:11] and fight over it was given to hold the
[1:06:12] life in so we should be thankful for the
[1:06:15] doctrine God's given and not use it as a
[1:06:19] club
[1:06:21] amen we've had trials and difficulties
[1:06:24] but those trials and difficult these
[1:06:25] were never meant to knock us off the
[1:06:27] road amen they were actually probably
[1:06:29] given us to keep us going down the
[1:06:30] middle of the
[1:06:31] road we get distracted by our trials we
[1:06:34] get discouraged by bad things that
[1:06:36] happen and we don't understand why this
[1:06:39] happened to me and why that happened to
[1:06:40] me and why I find myself in this
[1:06:43] conflict and and this negative thing
[1:06:45] happened to me and the trials start to
[1:06:47] become a distraction to keep us from
[1:06:49] moving down the road and that's also not
[1:06:51] what God gave the trials for the trials
[1:06:53] were there Amen to bring character into
[1:06:55] our lives and keep us moving forward in
[1:06:57] Christ because we need him more than
[1:06:59] anything else amen I'll tell you
[1:07:02] something else with trials trials are a
[1:07:04] great motivation to just keep moving
[1:07:05] towards Christ because I want to get to
[1:07:07] the destination faster anyways I'm not
[1:07:10] excited about sticking around here any
[1:07:11] longer in the midst of my trials don't
[1:07:13] let me get distracted by that and fall
[1:07:15] to the right or left but oh God I want
[1:07:17] to press towards the mark of the high
[1:07:19] calling because I've got a destination
[1:07:21] and that destination is not in this
[1:07:23] world in this condition but I've got a
[1:07:24] destination that'll get me out of this
[1:07:28] condition May the trials of life and the
[1:07:31] pressures and the disappointments and
[1:07:32] the discouragements and all the bad
[1:07:35] things that happen may it be a
[1:07:36] motivation to keep me moving down this
[1:07:39] road because my exit is not to cause
[1:07:42] people to stop disputing with me that's
[1:07:43] not going to change
[1:07:45] anything my exit is forward on the other
[1:07:49] end of the
[1:07:52] board praise God
[1:07:56] you imagine the little boy riding
[1:07:59] down somebody over here says you ain't
[1:08:02] no good you can't do anything anyway and
[1:08:04] he turns over to yell at
[1:08:06] him that's not nice you shouldn't talk
[1:08:08] to me
[1:08:09] that
[1:08:13] way some point you just got to turn
[1:08:15] blinders
[1:08:17] on and say I'm going
[1:08:19] on I got to go on somebody doesn't like
[1:08:23] me I got to go on they don't understand
[1:08:25] understand me I don't got to they
[1:08:26] falsely accuse me I got to go on cuz
[1:08:29] that's not my destination in the right
[1:08:31] or to the left my destination is
[1:08:32] Straight
[1:08:33] Ahead there's all kinds of things the
[1:08:36] devil will try to use he'll try to use
[1:08:38] our own Ambitions and our own uh
[1:08:41] propensity to look for things that
[1:08:43] please
[1:08:44] ourselves so all along this path are
[1:08:47] shiny
[1:08:49] things shiny things that we like and
[1:08:52] shiny things we like to have and shiny
[1:08:54] things we like to possess amen and those
[1:08:56] can become distractions but that's not
[1:08:58] our goal we need to set our face on the
[1:09:02] destination there's all kinds of things
[1:09:04] that would like to knock us off but
[1:09:06] God's called us to press towards the
[1:09:09] mark of the prize for the High Calling
[1:09:12] of God in Christ Jesus there is a price
[1:09:15] to be
[1:09:16] won we have to keep that in
[1:09:19] mind in the message Escape hither come
[1:09:21] quickly from 1958 the prophet says you
[1:09:24] don't want do anything's wrong there's
[1:09:27] where the two great schools went off on
[1:09:28] the deep end the Armenian Doctrine
[1:09:31] you've got to do a certain thing and do
[1:09:32] a certain thing that's works and the
[1:09:35] other side the calvinist went bless God
[1:09:37] I'm saved I do what I want to see but
[1:09:39] the middle of the road is it if you love
[1:09:42] him you won't do anything
[1:09:45] wrong he's going to show that now
[1:09:48] there's there's two sides on this road
[1:09:49] that you can get off one's Armenian
[1:09:51] Doctrine one's calvinistic Doctrine The
[1:09:53] Armenian Doctrine is if you mess up
[1:09:55] you're back at square one you're done
[1:09:57] you got to repent you got to start over
[1:09:58] again it's Works based the other one
[1:10:00] calvinistic and it's all by grace and no
[1:10:02] matter what I do I'm going to make it to
[1:10:04] the destination so I can live any way I
[1:10:06] want and do whatever I want and both of
[1:10:08] these things are wrong brother Venom
[1:10:10] said the truth is right down the middle
[1:10:11] of the road amen and it's not there's a
[1:10:13] truth to Grace amen absolute truth to
[1:10:16] Grace amen there's a truth to works that
[1:10:18] God wants us he's ordained us to good
[1:10:19] works but we bring these two things
[1:10:21] together and all I want to do is please
[1:10:24] the one that I'm focused focused on so
[1:10:27] I'm not focused on the works and I'm not
[1:10:29] focused on the grace I'm focused on
[1:10:31] Christ and if I'm focused on Christ the
[1:10:33] grace and the works come together
[1:10:35] because that's who I'm focused on I'm
[1:10:37] here to please him I'm here to serve him
[1:10:39] I'm destined to move this direction
[1:10:41] towards the word amen and if I focus on
[1:10:44] that and move towards that the grace of
[1:10:46] God and the works of God will come
[1:10:48] together in the middle of the road I'm
[1:10:50] not focused on either I'm focused on
[1:10:53] him the problem is we lose our focus and
[1:10:56] we get derailed on one side or the other
[1:10:58] of debates and arguments and doctrines
[1:11:00] when we if we focus on him he's the
[1:11:03] source of all Doctrine he's what all
[1:11:05] Doctrine is about he's what every Bible
[1:11:07] verse is pointing to he's what every
[1:11:09] teaching is teaching about he's the one
[1:11:11] he's the source so let's focus on him
[1:11:14] and let everything pull together towards
[1:11:17] what we're focusing
[1:11:19] on we get focused on too many other
[1:11:23] things and it's just a distraction of
[1:11:25] the
[1:11:26] devil again brother B says it this way
[1:11:28] when a man is converted his eyes are set
[1:11:31] towards
[1:11:32] Calvary if he's just a little bit
[1:11:34] nervous if you don't watch him he'll
[1:11:36] he'll go over on the fanatic side if
[1:11:38] he's just a little scarly he will go
[1:11:40] over on the starchy side but right in
[1:11:42] the middle of the road is the same
[1:11:43] sensible Born Again spirit-led endowed
[1:11:46] Church of the Living God going straight
[1:11:48] down the road to Christ that's the real
[1:11:51] coming from both the sides one went one
[1:11:53] way one went the other shows fanaticism
[1:11:56] or either scholarly or just are too
[1:11:58] stiff to Bow they know more about the
[1:12:01] word than they know about the
[1:12:03] author oh man that's a
[1:12:06] statement they know more about the word
[1:12:08] than they know about the
[1:12:10] author oh God help us not to follow this
[1:12:14] path to know the words not life but to
[1:12:17] know him is life to know him you don't
[1:12:20] have to be a scholar you have to be a
[1:12:22] submitted person and when you submit
[1:12:24] yourself to Christ Christ is obligated
[1:12:26] to fill that vacancy that you poured out
[1:12:28] on the altar to him he's obligated to
[1:12:31] his word to do it and he will not fail
[1:12:34] you amen amen when we focus somewhere
[1:12:39] other than the destination than Christ
[1:12:41] we start to move towards what we focus
[1:12:44] on so many times we we can get into
[1:12:48] discussions and disputes and
[1:12:50] disagreements and and all of a sudden
[1:12:52] the only thing we're focused on is our
[1:12:55] our
[1:12:58] point because there's a disagreement on
[1:13:01] the message disagreement on Doctrine
[1:13:02] disagreement on a decision disagreement
[1:13:04] on whatever the disagreement is amen and
[1:13:06] we got then as soon as we get into a
[1:13:08] disagreement we take our eyes off of
[1:13:10] Christ and we put our eyes on the point
[1:13:12] that's in
[1:13:18] dispute that was never the point for the
[1:13:21] word that's never why God gave us the
[1:13:23] word not for disput D he gave us the
[1:13:25] word to point us to Christ that's right
[1:13:28] and the devil can distract Us by we've
[1:13:30] got to get something make some point get
[1:13:33] something right and get distracted what
[1:13:35] we need to do is just keep our eyes
[1:13:37] focused and keep riding down this
[1:13:41] board I want to turn to the book of
[1:13:43] numbers together
[1:13:57] Numbers Chapter
[1:14:02] 13 I think we're all probably familiar
[1:14:04] with the story takes place at ktie
[1:14:08] spia when Moses had sent 12 Spies into
[1:14:11] the land to spy out the land they came
[1:14:13] back and they started giving a report of
[1:14:15] the
[1:14:16] land numbers
[1:14:20] 13 verse 28 I want to begin at verse
[1:14:23] 28 said nevertheless the people be
[1:14:25] strong this is the report of 10 of the
[1:14:27] spies when they come back they they
[1:14:30] acknowledge that it was everything that
[1:14:32] Moses said it would be a land that
[1:14:33] floweth with milk and honey and all of
[1:14:35] these things but they said
[1:14:38] nevertheless the people be strong that
[1:14:40] dwell in the land and the cities are
[1:14:42] walled and very great and moreover we
[1:14:45] saw the children of anch there the
[1:14:47] amalekites dwell in the land of the
[1:14:49] South and the Hittites and the jebusites
[1:14:51] and the amorites dwelt on the mountains
[1:14:53] and the Canaanites dwelt by the sea by
[1:14:55] the coast of
[1:14:56] Jordan and Caleb Steed the people before
[1:14:58] Moses and said let us go up at once and
[1:15:00] possess it for we are well able to
[1:15:03] overcome
[1:15:04] it Caleb was looking at something
[1:15:07] different than the 10 spies were looking
[1:15:09] at verse 31 but when the but the men
[1:15:13] that went up with him said we be not
[1:15:15] able to go up against the people for
[1:15:17] they are stronger than we and they
[1:15:19] brought up an evil report of the land
[1:15:21] which they had searched un the children
[1:15:24] of Israel saying the the land through
[1:15:26] which we have gone to search it is a
[1:15:28] land that eateth up the inhabitants
[1:15:30] thereof and all the people that we saw
[1:15:31] in it were men of great
[1:15:34] stature now let's uh verse 33 and there
[1:15:38] were there we saw the Giants the sons of
[1:15:40] anak which came of the Giants and we
[1:15:42] were in their own sight as Grasshoppers
[1:15:44] and we were in their sight as we were in
[1:15:46] their sight verse 14 chapter 14:1 and
[1:15:50] all the congregation lifted up their
[1:15:52] voice and cried and the people wept that
[1:15:55] night and all the children of Israel
[1:15:57] murmured against Moses and against Aaron
[1:15:59] and the whole congregation said unto
[1:16:01] them would God that we had died in the
[1:16:03] land of Egypt or would God we had died
[1:16:05] in the wilderness and wherefore hath the
[1:16:08] Lord brought us into this land to Fall
[1:16:10] by the sword that our wives and our
[1:16:12] children should be appr prey were it not
[1:16:15] better for us to return unto
[1:16:18] Egypt and they said one to another let
[1:16:20] us make a captain and let us return into
[1:16:22] Egypt then Moses and Aaron fell on their
[1:16:24] faces before for all the Assembly of the
[1:16:26] congregation of the children of Israel
[1:16:28] and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the
[1:16:30] son of jeffan which were of them that
[1:16:32] searched the land rent their clothes and
[1:16:34] they spake unto all the company of the
[1:16:36] children of Israel saying the land which
[1:16:38] we passed through to search it is an
[1:16:40] exceeding exceeding good land if the
[1:16:43] Lord Delight in us then he will bring us
[1:16:45] into his land and give it us a land
[1:16:48] which floweth with milk and honey only
[1:16:50] Rebel not ye against the Lord neither
[1:16:52] fear ye the people of the land for for
[1:16:55] they are bread for us their defenses is
[1:16:57] departed from them and the Lord Is With
[1:16:59] Us fear them
[1:17:01] not we come back they come back from
[1:17:03] searching out the land with two reports
[1:17:06] one report is the land is good but there
[1:17:09] is no way that we can ride from this
[1:17:12] across this board and get on the other
[1:17:13] side it's too high it's too narrow the
[1:17:17] bike's too wobbly the tires are this and
[1:17:19] the air pressure is that and and be
[1:17:21] besides we saw everybody else who tried
[1:17:24] fall off
[1:17:26] do you
[1:17:28] understand there's no way we can take
[1:17:30] the land there's Giants there's walled
[1:17:32] cities there's there's strong people
[1:17:34] there's no way that we can take the land
[1:17:36] and so what they were looking at is they
[1:17:38] were looking at the challenge amen of
[1:17:40] trying to take the land but Joshua and
[1:17:43] Caleb were looking at something
[1:17:44] different they weren't looking at the
[1:17:46] challenge of taking the land they were
[1:17:48] looking at the promise that God had
[1:17:50] given them to give them the land what
[1:17:53] were they looking at the destination the
[1:17:55] mark of the prize of the High Calling
[1:17:57] they weren't looking down at the board
[1:17:58] trying to cross they were looking at the
[1:18:00] word trying to cross and they realized
[1:18:04] according to the word we can ride right
[1:18:06] across this board why how are we going
[1:18:09] to do it how are we going to take down
[1:18:10] the wall cities how will we def fight
[1:18:12] the Chariots there's there's more men
[1:18:14] than us they have armor than us they
[1:18:16] weren't looking at any of those things
[1:18:18] they were looking at one thing one thing
[1:18:20] they set their Vision on and it's God
[1:18:22] who said I will give you that land
[1:18:27] amen and we realize that those were the
[1:18:30] only two who made it in they set their
[1:18:32] focus on that and as they focused on it
[1:18:35] they kept pressing to it and what did
[1:18:37] they have to endure the next 40 years
[1:18:39] they had to endure falling off on the
[1:18:41] right and the left and falling off on
[1:18:42] the right and the
[1:18:44] left in their Journey from Egypt till
[1:18:47] they finally entered into the promised
[1:18:48] land amen there was the failure at the
[1:18:51] golden calf there was the failure with
[1:18:54] the fiery serpents there was the failure
[1:18:56] at at Bale peor amen there was the
[1:18:58] failure amen with daythan and abam and
[1:19:01] Kora amen there was the failure now at
[1:19:03] ktie Baria and they would walk through
[1:19:05] the Wilderness for 40 years and they
[1:19:07] would watch all of their friends that
[1:19:08] they came out of Egypt with die one by
[1:19:11] one by one but you know what that didn't
[1:19:13] stop them or deter them because what
[1:19:15] they were looking at never
[1:19:17] changed the focus in the journey never
[1:19:20] changed and when it came time for the
[1:19:22] punishment to end and the 40 years were
[1:19:23] over guess who was ready to ride across
[1:19:26] that board and take the land the same
[1:19:28] too with the same vision they knew if
[1:19:30] the Lord Delight in us they're bread for
[1:19:35] us amen you talk about two men who saw a
[1:19:39] whole lot of falling
[1:19:41] away they saw Millions Fall
[1:19:45] Away Fall by one trap Bale peor 70 some
[1:19:51] thousand di now they murmured against
[1:19:54] God and the fiery serpents and thousands
[1:19:56] of them
[1:19:57] died they they they they thought Moses
[1:20:01] was lost they needed a God to worship to
[1:20:05] take him back to Egypt to bring him up
[1:20:06] further in the journey and and they fell
[1:20:08] at the golden calf you know discouraging
[1:20:11] that is you know how many family members
[1:20:12] or
[1:20:16] friends but what got them to the
[1:20:17] promised
[1:20:19] land because they set their face for the
[1:20:23] mark of the high calling in Christ
[1:20:28] Jesus you know what we're on a journey
[1:20:31] through a
[1:20:32] Wilderness but we've got a destination
[1:20:37] friends amen there was those who
[1:20:39] disputed Moses there was those who tried
[1:20:42] to get power and position there was
[1:20:44] everything imaginable was going
[1:20:47] on they tried to hybrid the religion
[1:20:50] they
[1:20:53] tried but you know what those who
[1:20:56] focused on the word and on the promise
[1:20:58] they made it to the promised land
[1:21:01] amen there's a bride in this day that's
[1:21:04] predestinated to make it she's not going
[1:21:07] to
[1:21:08] fall she's not going to fall off of this
[1:21:11] board why because she's the best riter
[1:21:14] in town she's not the best writer in
[1:21:16] town she's not the most skilled or the
[1:21:19] most gifted or she's got one thing going
[1:21:21] for her she's got a promise and she's
[1:21:22] got a focus yeah and if we focus on the
[1:21:25] promise I guarantee we'll pedal right
[1:21:28] across this board because this bride
[1:21:30] won't fall she's predestinated not
[1:21:35] to listen distractions come they're
[1:21:38] going to come tomorrow they'll
[1:21:41] come somebody else you love will do
[1:21:43] something
[1:21:45] wrong somebody else will fall somebody
[1:21:49] else will fail another dispute will come
[1:21:51] up another misunderstanding
[1:21:55] I encourage you don't look to the right
[1:21:57] or the
[1:21:59] left don't look to the right or to the
[1:22:02] left but look to Jesus the author and
[1:22:05] finisher of our
[1:22:07] faith look to him he was the one who
[1:22:11] looked beyond
[1:22:13] Calvary to the promise that laid ahead
[1:22:17] and he walked to Calvary looking Beyond
[1:22:20] Calvary to the promise and endured the
[1:22:22] shame and was despised and rejected
[1:22:25] because he had set his face on another
[1:22:28] focus and he could walk the impossible
[1:22:31] of rejection and persecution and pain
[1:22:33] and suffering and he could walk it and
[1:22:35] not fall off because of the glory that
[1:22:37] lay ahead he endured the
[1:22:40] cross how is it that that we can walk in
[1:22:43] this world with so much disappointment
[1:22:45] how can we walk when all around us
[1:22:46] there's people falling to the right or
[1:22:48] the left how can we walk maybe we should
[1:22:50] set our focus on things that lay ahead
[1:22:53] amen amen
[1:22:56] and just forget about it put the
[1:22:58] blinders on and say I know where my
[1:23:01] destination
[1:23:04] is listen it can't last much
[1:23:08] longer it's not going to last
[1:23:11] forever whatever you're going through it
[1:23:13] can't last much
[1:23:16] longer just think about it life is only
[1:23:19] 80 90
[1:23:21] years it won't last forever whatever
[1:23:24] you're going through it'll
[1:23:26] end the trial you're in and I don't know
[1:23:29] anybody who's been through an 80 90e
[1:23:32] trial they start and they end they start
[1:23:36] mysteriously sometimes they end
[1:23:38] mysteriously but no matter where you are
[1:23:40] in the journey it's going to end it's
[1:23:42] this is not going to last forever and
[1:23:44] we're at the end time when for all of us
[1:23:46] it's going to end there's an end there's
[1:23:49] a there there's a goal there's a mark
[1:23:51] there's a prize there's something to win
[1:23:53] there's a prize that at the end of this
[1:23:55] board we just need to write down it and
[1:23:57] don't worry about who all fell off
[1:23:59] before but they were better Christians
[1:24:00] than me and they fell they were better
[1:24:02] Riders than me they were fell they were
[1:24:03] more skilled and they couldn't make it
[1:24:05] it doesn't matter none of that matters
[1:24:08] there's a goal and I'm predestinated to
[1:24:10] make the
[1:24:12] goal so what am I going to do every day
[1:24:15] I'm just going to keep pressing towards
[1:24:16] the mark of the high calling in Christ
[1:24:19] Jesus you know what Joshua and Caleb
[1:24:22] didn't know they didn't know how they
[1:24:24] were going to knock the walls down yeah
[1:24:27] they didn't know how to kill Giants and
[1:24:29] they didn't know where they were going
[1:24:30] to get armor and weapons yeah they
[1:24:33] didn't know how they were going to fight
[1:24:35] when they were outnumbered they didn't
[1:24:36] know how they were going to supply the
[1:24:38] army they didn't know there was a
[1:24:40] million things they didn't know but the
[1:24:42] things they didn't know didn't matter
[1:24:44] the thing they did know is the only
[1:24:45] thing they needed to
[1:24:47] know and I don't know how we're going to
[1:24:50] cross obstacles that we have yet to
[1:24:51] cross as a bride I don't know how I'm
[1:24:53] going to cross obstacles have to cross
[1:24:55] as an individual or my family will have
[1:24:57] to cross or this church will have to
[1:24:58] cross I don't know how we're going to
[1:25:00] cross it I don't know how we're going to
[1:25:01] overcome it I don't know how we we move
[1:25:04] Beyond it I don't know but one thing I
[1:25:06] know is the only thing I need to know
[1:25:08] that there is an author and a finisher
[1:25:10] of my faith and he predestinated me to
[1:25:12] cross that
[1:25:13] line and if I didn't believe that I
[1:25:16] should just quit now because there's no
[1:25:18] way I'm going to make
[1:25:20] it I just have to believe it
[1:25:24] I have to believe that I was in his mind
[1:25:26] before the foundation of the world and
[1:25:28] he wants me to make it to the goal
[1:25:32] because he wants me he's on the other
[1:25:33] end pulling
[1:25:35] me cuz an invisible string tied around
[1:25:38] my handlebars and he's over there
[1:25:43] and just keep focused to the one who
[1:25:47] altered our faith and is finishing our
[1:25:49] faith brother Bram says there's a
[1:25:51] thousand ways to die there's only one to
[1:25:55] live and that's
[1:25:57] Christ there's a million things that
[1:26:00] take your time and attention there's one
[1:26:01] worth focusing on that's Christ there's
[1:26:05] all kinds of ways to fall off of this
[1:26:07] road but there's only one way to stay on
[1:26:09] it and that's keep focused on
[1:26:12] Christ this message is a person it's the
[1:26:16] person of Christ all the doctrines are
[1:26:19] about a person that's the person of
[1:26:21] Christ the seals were Christ the
[1:26:24] unveiling of the seals the uncovering of
[1:26:26] the Mysteries it was all unveiling
[1:26:29] Christ the whole goal is the person of
[1:26:33] Jesus Christ where should I set my eyes
[1:26:36] and my affection on the destination amen
[1:26:40] how are we going to get there I don't
[1:26:42] know but if I just keep focused and if I
[1:26:45] just keep pedaling I believe I'm going
[1:26:47] to get there amen praise God let's all
[1:26:51] Stand Together musicians if you come
[1:26:58] please do you believe that the promise
[1:27:00] is
[1:27:01] yours can you believe like Joshua and
[1:27:04] Caleb regardless of what they
[1:27:07] saw regardless of the obstacles and the
[1:27:10] unsurmountable obstacles and the
[1:27:12] inability in themselves regardless of
[1:27:14] all of that they looked at the promised
[1:27:17] word
[1:27:19] listen we I don't know if you believe
[1:27:22] this or not but in the flesh
[1:27:24] we're the little
[1:27:26] boy I'm not talking about spirit in the
[1:27:29] spirit God sees us totally different but
[1:27:32] in the flesh we don't have anything
[1:27:36] going for
[1:27:37] us no big Financial backing no political
[1:27:40] support no no defense no great wisdom
[1:27:44] no we don't have
[1:27:47] anything the only thing we have is the
[1:27:49] only thing we need we have faith to
[1:27:51] believe the word of God and if we have
[1:27:54] faith in the word of God and can stay
[1:27:56] focused on that we don't need anything
[1:27:59] else we don't need supports we don't
[1:28:01] need props we don't need defenses we
[1:28:03] don't need all of these things we need
[1:28:05] one thing we need faith in the word of
[1:28:07] God and we need to stay focused on that
[1:28:09] and if we can stay focused on that and
[1:28:11] keep moving towards Christ it's all
[1:28:14] going to come out the way he
[1:28:16] predestinated it to come
[1:28:18] out amen let's bow our heads and
[1:28:21] pray dear Lord Jesus we thank thank you
[1:28:24] Father for this
[1:28:26] day
[1:28:29] God you known before the foundation of
[1:28:32] the world what you were going to
[1:28:36] do you knew who would make it and who
[1:28:38] would not you've predestinated a
[1:28:41] people God you've come through all kinds
[1:28:45] of messages through all kinds of word
[1:28:49] examples in the Bible to show us Lord
[1:28:53] that your word is all always all that's
[1:28:55] needed your promised word is always
[1:28:57] enough it's always sufficient you just
[1:29:01] need somebody that will believe it
[1:29:03] that'll receive it and that'll walk
[1:29:05] towards
[1:29:06] it God we want to be those people we
[1:29:09] want to be your calebs lord those who
[1:29:13] will take you at your word and believe
[1:29:14] the promise regardless of what everyone
[1:29:17] else says we want to be
[1:29:20] Caleb we want to be the Apostle Paul
[1:29:24] who who pressed towards the mark of the
[1:29:27] prize of the High
[1:29:29] Calling Lord though he was distracted
[1:29:31] and Shipwrecked and rejected and every
[1:29:33] manner of horrible things happened to
[1:29:36] him but he yet stayed
[1:29:39] focused Lord and you brought a prophet
[1:29:41] in this day his life Lord wasn't easy he
[1:29:44] went through so many difficult things
[1:29:47] personal trials and heartbreaks and
[1:29:50] heartaches rejection and criticism
[1:29:53] strife
[1:29:55] Lord he stayed focused on the calling
[1:29:57] with you called him
[1:30:00] for God now it's our
[1:30:02] turn it's come our time Lord to walk
[1:30:06] down this highway in the middle of the
[1:30:08] road to ride down this board as it was
[1:30:12] Lord God there's train wrecks on both
[1:30:15] sides there's
[1:30:18] obstacles but God we believe you've
[1:30:20] ordained us for this
[1:30:22] hour we believe that we're part of the
[1:30:24] people that you've called to make it to
[1:30:26] the Finish Line to come to the goal of
[1:30:29] adoption to be your very representation
[1:30:32] upon this Earth and a many membered body
[1:30:36] that will become the people that you can
[1:30:37] reflect yourself through
[1:30:40] completely and that we'll take a body
[1:30:42] change and we'll leave this world in a
[1:30:44] glorified body we believe that's the
[1:30:47] goal that's the
[1:30:49] destination and God we don't know how to
[1:30:51] get from here to there we don't know how
[1:30:54] to overcome the
[1:30:55] obstacles but God I know that you
[1:30:57] already
[1:30:58] know you've already ordained it you've
[1:31:01] already made a
[1:31:02] provision Lord give each of us Faith to
[1:31:05] keep pressing on to keep you in focus
[1:31:08] and keep
[1:31:10] striving Lord I pray you'd forgive us
[1:31:12] for the distractions that we've allowed
[1:31:15] to come along to knock us from one side
[1:31:18] to the other oh God I'm thankful for
[1:31:20] your grace that keeps pulling us down
[1:31:22] the road yes god without you there's no
[1:31:25] way we would have made it this far
[1:31:27] there's no way we'll make it one bit
[1:31:30] farther but God we know it's you who
[1:31:32] kept us and you who preserved us you're
[1:31:35] guiding us and you're leading us and
[1:31:36] you're drawing us to
[1:31:38] yourself God I pray that you would equip
[1:31:40] us with the word like we've heard
[1:31:42] tonight to put the blinders on to let
[1:31:46] whatever happens happen Lord but to stay
[1:31:48] focused on you for you're our bridegroom
[1:31:52] you're our husband you're the love of
[1:31:53] our Al you're the focus of all of our
[1:31:55] attention you are the goal you are the
[1:31:58] destination you are the
[1:32:01] prize God I pray Lord It's become about
[1:32:05] so many things that it shouldn't be
[1:32:07] about but God this message is you
[1:32:10] presenting yourself to
[1:32:12] us it's you making yourself available to
[1:32:15] us it's you revealing yourself to your
[1:32:18] bride and coming in Union with
[1:32:21] her God I pray that you'd help us to
[1:32:23] make that the primary objective of Our
[1:32:26] Lives is to connect with
[1:32:29] you L we love you we thank you for this
[1:32:32] message you've given us we thank you for
