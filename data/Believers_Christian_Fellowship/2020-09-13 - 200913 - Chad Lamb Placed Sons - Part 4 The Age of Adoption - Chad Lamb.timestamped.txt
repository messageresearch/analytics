[5:44] that'll be a nice time just to celebrate
[5:47] all the years of service of our precious
[5:49] brother
[5:50] also i wanted to give a little update
[5:54] i got a call from jeremy sanders on
[5:56] thursday
[5:58] on his brother roger he said that
[6:01] thursday they sent roger home from the
[6:04] hospital
[6:05] is that right brother roger thursday he
[6:07] went home thursday he went home from the
[6:09] hospital
[6:10] he had a liver transplant sunday
[6:13] afternoon at 4.
[6:15] everything went perfect they sent him
[6:17] home
[6:18] thursday and usually they're still in
[6:20] icu at that time
[6:23] they sent him home and from what jeremy
[6:25] was explaining to me is
[6:26] all the doctors are absolutely stunned
[6:29] at his recovery
[6:30] and amazed and we just thank god let's
[6:32] give god a hand clapping praise we thank
[6:34] god for that
[6:42] god is able to do exceedingly abundantly
[6:45] above all we could ask amen
[6:48] also we want to welcome the tim finley
[6:50] family somebody told me they're here
[6:52] visiting so god bless you
[6:53] you're welcome we're glad to have you
[6:55] here and before we read the word i'd
[6:57] like to have a word of prayer
[6:59] i had heard and found out that
[7:02] brother ron spencer's in the hospital
[7:04] he's been diagnosed with coven 19 and
[7:06] pneumonia
[7:07] and so he's been struggling with cancer
[7:09] already so we'd definitely want to hold
[7:11] our brother up in prayer
[7:12] that god will just touch him
[7:13] supernaturally and i guess some
[7:16] in the assembly they had a bit of an
[7:17] outbreak in the church and some in the
[7:18] assembly are sick as well
[7:20] so as we pray over the reading of the
[7:22] word let's just go ahead and bow our
[7:23] heads and we'll pray for our brother
[7:26] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[7:28] jesus
[7:30] for you are so precious to us lord
[7:32] you're a present help in the time of
[7:34] trouble
[7:35] we've watched lord as one by one you
[7:37] take care of every enemy that would come
[7:39] against you lord
[7:41] every foe that would try to defeat us or
[7:43] discourage us
[7:44] lord you have defeated them one by one
[7:46] by your word
[7:48] and though we're standing upon your word
[7:50] asking lord that you would meet the
[7:51] needs we lift before you
[7:53] know we ask for the entire assembly at
[7:56] brother ron spencer's church that you
[7:57] would bless
[7:58] each one and deliver them each one from
[8:00] this illness and the sickness
[8:01] you've been so faithful you've healed so
[8:04] many lord and delivered them from such
[8:05] circumstances we pray you would do the
[8:07] same for their whole assembly
[8:09] may the trial turn into a blessing and a
[8:11] testimony
[8:12] of your power and god especially for our
[8:15] brother ron lord he's already been
[8:16] struggling
[8:17] you've been helping him lord but we ask
[8:19] that you would just supernaturally touch
[8:21] him now and deliver him
[8:22] from this coven 19 and the consequences
[8:25] from that and the pneumonia and that you
[8:27] would bring him out lord and you would
[8:28] show yourself mighty
[8:29] on our brother's behalf but we ask in
[8:32] love for our brother we ask that you
[8:33] would just do a work
[8:35] that no human can do but we're not
[8:37] trusting in you to do it lord
[8:38] that you would raise him up for your
[8:40] glory that the testimony would
[8:42] reverberate around the world lord
[8:44] that you're the same yesterday today and
[8:46] forever
[8:48] we love you lord we ask that you would
[8:49] bless us as we read your word
[8:51] we pray god that your inspiration would
[8:52] be upon us lord to preach the gospel
[8:55] and god that you would give us ears to
[8:57] hear all that you have for us in this
[8:58] day
[8:59] that you would encourage us in places by
[9:01] your word
[9:02] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[9:06] while we're yet standing let's turn to
[9:07] the book of ephesians
[9:09] chapter one we're going to continue on
[9:11] with play sons part four
[9:13] but my subtitle for this is the adoption
[9:16] age
[9:17] or the age of adoption either one you
[9:20] want to word it
[9:22] ephesians chapter 1 we'll read this
[9:25] three verses here and then we'll have
[9:27] you be seated
[9:28] ephesians chapter 1 verse 3
[9:32] blessed be the god and father of our
[9:33] lord jesus christ who hath blessed us
[9:35] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[9:37] places
[9:38] in christ according as he hath chosen us
[9:41] in him
[9:42] before the foundation of the world that
[9:44] we should be holy
[9:45] and without blame before him in love i
[9:48] don't know what it is i've read that
[9:50] scripture hundreds of times and i can
[9:51] never get over the fact
[9:53] that he wanted me holy and blameless
[9:55] before him in love
[9:56] no matter what the devil tries to accuse
[9:58] me of or put blame on me
[10:00] god before the foundation world chose me
[10:03] to be
[10:04] holy and blameless
[10:07] verse 5 and having predestinated us unto
[10:10] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[10:12] to himself
[10:13] according to the good pleasure of his
[10:16] will
[10:17] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[10:19] wherein he hath made us
[10:21] accepted in the beloved amen you can
[10:24] have your seeds
[10:26] so right on the shoot we read this we've
[10:28] been over so many times we've expounded
[10:29] upon it but i can't get over how amazing
[10:32] it is that god before the foundation of
[10:34] the world
[10:35] already determined that i would be holy
[10:37] already determined that i'd be without
[10:39] blame
[10:39] already determined that i would be
[10:41] placed as a son
[10:43] amen and all for his good will and all
[10:46] for his good pleasure
[10:47] he has made me accepted in the beloved
[10:49] it wasn't based off my efforts my works
[10:52] my oh you know how good i got anything
[10:55] it was based completely upon his will
[10:58] and his desire
[10:59] from before the foundation of the world
[11:01] that
[11:02] that is a place to set our anchor that
[11:04] is a foundation to put our feet upon
[11:06] amen so if we i want to read here from
[11:10] the
[11:10] uh smyrnian church age out of the church
[11:14] age book
[11:15] brother branham says in this message now
[11:18] without getting too involved in the
[11:19] subject of the sovereignty of god
[11:21] for that would take a book in itself let
[11:23] me point out here that according to
[11:25] these verses jesus christ is choosing
[11:27] his own bride
[11:28] just the same as men choose their brides
[11:30] today the bride today does not simply
[11:33] decide she is going to take a certain
[11:34] man for a husband no sir
[11:36] it is the groom who decides and chooses
[11:38] a certain woman for his bride
[11:41] amen how many of you believe you're the
[11:42] bride of jesus christ
[11:44] amen that wasn't your choice amen all we
[11:47] did was surrender all we did was
[11:49] respond back to his choice amen and
[11:52] john 15 16 says he ye have not chosen
[11:56] me but i have chosen you now according
[11:57] to the word of god the bride was chosen
[11:59] before the foundation of the world
[12:01] this choosing of the bride was purposed
[12:04] in himself ephesians 1 9.
[12:06] and in romans 9 11 it says that the
[12:08] purpose of god according to election
[12:10] might stand
[12:12] you can't read it any other way the
[12:14] heart purpose
[12:16] oh let that lock in the heart purpose
[12:19] the eternal purpose of god
[12:21] was to take a bride of his own choosing
[12:24] i'm going to read that again i mean if
[12:26] you want to get to the heart of a matter
[12:28] let's get to the heart of the matter
[12:29] right here
[12:30] the heart purpose the eternal purpose of
[12:34] god
[12:34] was to take a bride of his own choosing
[12:36] and that purpose was in himself
[12:38] and being eternal was decreed before the
[12:41] foundation
[12:42] of the world amen there's so many things
[12:46] that
[12:46] that we can talk about and get caught up
[12:48] in and so many things that can be
[12:50] debated around scripture and around
[12:52] denomination and you know around
[12:54] scholarship
[12:55] i say on the word you get so much
[12:58] scholarship on the word and they start
[13:00] debating you know uh we can debate all
[13:02] the doctrines you may
[13:04] debate on the oneness of god versus
[13:07] trinitarianism we can debate on
[13:09] the serpent seed versus eating a
[13:11] physical fruit
[13:12] we can debate on water baptism by
[13:15] immersion water baptism in jesus name
[13:18] i mean we can have all of these
[13:19] discussions but really when it comes
[13:21] down to it what's the heart of the whole
[13:23] thing
[13:24] what was god's heart when god dwelt
[13:26] alone amen when he was just alone with
[13:28] his thoughts
[13:29] what was the very core purpose of god
[13:32] his
[13:32] heart that he wanted to express through
[13:34] the entire bible
[13:35] everything he created was for this
[13:37] purpose amen everything he created in
[13:39] heaven and earth was for this purpose
[13:41] everything he done through every prophet
[13:43] that come down through the age was for
[13:44] this purpose
[13:45] everything he allowed to be put in this
[13:46] bible was for this purpose
[13:50] do you understand everything that god
[13:53] amen would do was for this purpose and
[13:57] what was his heart purpose
[13:58] to have amen to take a bride of his
[14:02] own choosing
[14:05] and if you find yourself in that place
[14:07] you can say thank you lord jesus
[14:09] i'm so thankful to you lord let's turn
[14:12] to isaiah 46
[14:14] and look at a couple scriptures here
[14:16] isaiah 46.
[14:29] isaiah 46 and
[14:35] i'm going to look at verse 9 isaiah 46
[14:38] and 9
[14:41] and remember the former things of old
[14:42] for i am god
[14:44] and there is none else i am god and
[14:46] there is none like me
[14:47] declaring the end from the beginning and
[14:50] from ancient times the things that are
[14:52] not yet done
[14:53] saying my counsel shall stand and i will
[14:56] do all my pleasure
[14:58] i want to focus on this verse 10
[15:00] declaring
[15:01] the end from the beginning and from
[15:03] ancient times the things that are not
[15:05] yet done
[15:07] so god was declaring the end from the
[15:10] beginning
[15:12] in acts 15 18 it says known unto god are
[15:14] all his works
[15:16] from the beginning of the world so known
[15:18] unto god
[15:19] are all his works from the beginning of
[15:21] the world so
[15:23] that's very clear there's no other way
[15:24] to understand that
[15:26] that if it's if it's a work of god if
[15:28] it's god's work
[15:29] he knew it from the beginning he knew
[15:31] what he was going to do
[15:33] like i said before god is not adjusting
[15:35] to the times
[15:36] he's not adjusting to the situation it's
[15:39] not like god will do something
[15:41] then see what you'll do then he'll
[15:42] adjust his response based off what you
[15:45] do
[15:45] no all of his works were known to him
[15:47] before the foundation of the world
[15:49] so much so that he could declare the end
[15:52] from the beginning
[15:54] so he's not waiting to see how things
[15:56] will transpire
[15:58] amen and adjusting his plan according to
[16:00] that or making
[16:02] addendums amendments to his plan it's
[16:05] fixed amen he declared it from the
[16:07] beginning he knows what will be he knows
[16:08] all those works from the beginning
[16:10] are we clear on that so let's go back to
[16:13] genesis 1.
[16:20] genesis chapter 1
[16:25] and verse 26
[16:30] i don't know about you but i love
[16:31] serving a sure god
[16:34] where things are sure they're fixed
[16:36] they're solid there's not the
[16:38] shifting sand of men's ideas that change
[16:41] over time
[16:42] and adjust and flex by situations amen
[16:45] every church has its church decree amen
[16:49] and that
[16:49] the church decree of the church dogma
[16:51] begins to change because it's built on
[16:53] the ideas of man
[16:54] so it's always shifting it's always
[16:56] changing but god
[16:57] his word is solid as a stone it does not
[17:00] shift it does not change
[17:01] so if you ever can put your foot on that
[17:03] you can rest assured that thing will
[17:05] never move out from under you
[17:07] you're solidly placed on the word of god
[17:09] and god
[17:10] knew what he would do from before the
[17:12] foundation of the world
[17:13] and he declared the end from the
[17:15] beginning so if he declared the end from
[17:17] the beginning
[17:18] then i'd like to go back to the
[17:19] beginning and i want to find out what is
[17:22] it he's declaring from the beginning
[17:23] that's going to show what the end is
[17:25] going to be
[17:27] so we go to genesis chapter 1 verse 26
[17:34] and god said let us make man in our
[17:36] image after our likeness and let them
[17:37] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[17:39] and over the fowl of the air and over
[17:41] the cattle and over all the earth
[17:42] and over every creeping thing that
[17:44] creepeth upon the earth so god created
[17:46] man in his own image in the image of god
[17:48] created he him
[17:49] male and female created he them so now
[17:52] we come to the
[17:54] to the very uh beginning we're in the
[17:57] beginning
[17:58] uh when god is fashioning and forming
[18:00] the earth as we know it today and
[18:02] and and he and he takes you know the the
[18:05] six days of creation to come down and on
[18:08] the seventh he rested
[18:09] and and then he decrees and he and he
[18:11] says let us make man
[18:13] in our image in our likeness and let's
[18:16] give him full authority and rulership
[18:18] upon over all the earth
[18:20] so the plan of god from the beginning
[18:22] was to have a son
[18:24] fashioned in his own likeness amen and
[18:26] to make that son
[18:27] male and female amen and take that
[18:30] expression of himself in male and female
[18:32] and place it as a god upon the earth
[18:37] because adam was a minor god he was a
[18:39] son of god
[18:40] amen if he's a son of god you know
[18:44] a son of a dog is a dog
[18:48] i a son of a human is a human a son of
[18:51] god is a god
[18:53] amen there's no way to get around that
[18:55] he's not
[18:56] god amen he doesn't take the place of
[18:58] god but he's under god as a son of god
[19:00] and adam was placed as a god on this
[19:02] earth amen
[19:03] he was he was given charge over
[19:05] everything and he was given dominion and
[19:07] rulership over
[19:08] everything amen but we find as we go on
[19:11] that that within the man was male and
[19:14] female
[19:14] amen he was in one being he was male and
[19:18] female
[19:18] but god amen had a plan and
[19:21] god is declaring the end from the
[19:23] beginning
[19:25] see this isn't just a story that we put
[19:27] in a storybook and make little colorful
[19:29] pictures so little kids can see it
[19:31] everything god's wrote in his bibles for
[19:33] a purpose and it's placed
[19:34] specifically in order for a purpose so
[19:37] we come right down here to the very
[19:39] beginning
[19:40] and when when god is is building up he's
[19:42] making a setting he's setting the scene
[19:45] on earth with the plants and the animals
[19:47] and establishing the heavens in their
[19:49] place
[19:49] he's setting the scene he's setting the
[19:51] atmosphere he's setting the place
[19:53] for his great masterpiece to set in and
[19:56] that masterpiece
[19:57] is a man made in his image male and
[20:00] female
[20:01] them so he builds the setting he builds
[20:04] the backdrop
[20:05] then he takes amen his great desire the
[20:08] great desire of his heart
[20:10] amen and he takes that desire and he
[20:12] places it there
[20:13] amen but god's not done and unfolding
[20:15] what's in his heart
[20:16] amen because we find out that that he
[20:19] says it's not good that man shall dwell
[20:21] alone
[20:22] it is not good that man shall dwell
[20:24] alone i will make a help meet for him
[20:26] so they they search in all of creation
[20:28] for help me
[20:29] no suitable help meat was found amen so
[20:32] god
[20:32] lays down the man and takes a rib from
[20:35] his side and
[20:36] fashions a woman amen and any and the
[20:38] brother of him tells us he takes that
[20:40] feminist spirit
[20:41] amen that was in adam and he splits that
[20:43] out and puts it in the woman
[20:45] and now the crowning act of all creation
[20:48] is when he takes the man
[20:49] and he takes the woman and he puts them
[20:51] together amen and we know that that god
[20:54] said that he made them male and female
[20:57] and called their name
[21:00] adam god was not
[21:03] that god was not looking amen for this
[21:05] another expression to have another
[21:07] identity or another name
[21:09] or be or be another person amen these
[21:12] are
[21:12] these are two of the same amen these are
[21:14] two of the same
[21:16] male and female put back together as
[21:19] one he said that that's why he said
[21:22] they'll no longer be twain but there'll
[21:24] be one
[21:25] one flesh amen it's not a cue story it's
[21:28] not a type
[21:28] it's the living reality he was declaring
[21:31] from the beginning
[21:33] what is going to be in the end
[21:36] this isn't you know this isn't for
[21:38] flannel graphs this isn't for sunday
[21:40] school this is an absolute living
[21:41] reality of god
[21:43] god establishing what has been his
[21:45] heart's purpose all along
[21:46] amen was to have a man amen and as a as
[21:49] a minor god upon the earth and his
[21:52] bride with him the two being one and he
[21:54] called their name
[21:56] adam and what's he doing
[22:00] he's declaring his very heart
[22:03] purpose because
[22:06] after he did this work he rested
[22:10] i mean this is all written the way it's
[22:12] written for a reason
[22:14] he he did this work because he had
[22:16] finally expressed
[22:18] what was in his mind he finally
[22:20] expressed his very heart purpose
[22:22] he got it all set in place he got it all
[22:25] established
[22:26] and he had a son positionally placed as
[22:28] god upon the earth
[22:30] and now he could sit back and take his
[22:32] rest because he had completed
[22:34] amen the masterpiece he completed the
[22:37] work
[22:38] that would show what his desire was
[22:42] so now we can see in isaiah
[22:45] that that he's declaring the end
[22:49] from the beginning that's why in genesis
[22:52] you find
[22:53] the man and his wife as one amen
[22:56] living as as gods upon the earth having
[22:59] dominion over the whole earth
[23:02] and you find that they're in perfect
[23:05] harmony perfect harmony with the earth
[23:06] perfect fellowship with
[23:08] their father god amen perfect union with
[23:10] one another
[23:11] everything was established in perfection
[23:13] until sin came in and corrupted that
[23:15] they remember when god took his rest
[23:18] when god said
[23:19] and that when god took his rest he was
[23:21] declaring that it's now perfect
[23:23] because if it wasn't perfect he wouldn't
[23:24] take his rest he would keep working
[23:27] god doesn't do things halfway he doesn't
[23:29] do them the wrong way
[23:31] he doesn't leave him undone so when god
[23:33] took his rest he was declaring
[23:34] that it's now done this is perfect and
[23:37] when he looked at all that he had made
[23:39] he said behold it is very good
[23:44] so now we find that this being god's
[23:47] purpose from the beginning
[23:49] he's declaring the end and this is book
[23:51] of genesis that's why if you skip all
[23:53] the way over to the book of revelation
[23:54] and start reading
[23:55] and the end of the book of revelations
[23:57] it starts saying let me show you
[24:00] the bride the lamb's wife
[24:05] now we start finding at the very end of
[24:07] the book
[24:08] in genesis there's a wedding taking
[24:10] revelation there's a wedding
[24:12] there's a union taking place and many he
[24:14] goes to
[24:15] show you the city and the city's adorned
[24:17] like a bride he shows you the bride the
[24:19] bride looks like a city
[24:20] see aaron mentioned this a few weeks ago
[24:22] and i mean it sparked so many things in
[24:24] our hearts
[24:26] but and then and he says behold i'll
[24:29] show you
[24:30] the the i'll show you the the bride the
[24:32] lamb's wife behold i'll show you the
[24:34] marriage of the lamb
[24:35] you get all the way to the end of the
[24:36] book in revelations 22 and you have the
[24:39] spirit and the bride
[24:40] now say come so it starts off with a man
[24:44] in his bride and it ends with the lamb
[24:46] jesus christ the man
[24:48] the last adam the restored adam and his
[24:51] bride
[24:52] united back as one put back on the earth
[24:55] in dominion as gods on the earth
[24:58] he has declared the end from the
[25:01] beginning
[25:01] and if you want to understand all the
[25:03] symbolism in genesis
[25:05] you are in revelations you've got to
[25:07] understand the symbolism in genesis
[25:09] and when you understand that what he did
[25:11] in genesis to declare his heart's
[25:13] purpose
[25:14] when he says it is now very good i can
[25:16] now take my rest
[25:17] amen when that became corrupted now we
[25:20] see what the whole
[25:21] bible is about because god awakened from
[25:24] his rest and went back to work to
[25:26] restore his masterpiece
[25:29] and he will not stop until the
[25:31] masterpiece is restored again
[25:35] why that that from the beginning was
[25:38] declaring the end
[25:39] it was perfect it was the way he wanted
[25:41] it it was the image that was
[25:43] displaying what was in his heart and it
[25:44] was marred and now there'll be no rest
[25:47] there'll be no
[25:48] stopping this plan of god until we come
[25:50] right back to that thing again
[25:54] praise be to god so where are we going
[25:57] if you want to know where we're going
[25:58] just look where we've been
[26:00] if you want to know what god's doing
[26:02] look at the beginning the beginning
[26:03] declares the end
[26:06] and so now now we've been given
[26:10] a key amen through a prophetic ministry
[26:12] in this last day who would come and
[26:14] unlock these things by the grace of god
[26:16] to us that key
[26:17] now unlocks amen when he when he
[26:19] preached christ is the mystery of god
[26:21] to the whole is one purpose
[26:26] one goal one thought that god had
[26:29] one thing that he wanted to achieve
[26:31] that's why when he comes to priests
[26:32] christ is mystery of god revealed he
[26:34] says
[26:34] i take from my text the entire bible
[26:40] he goes to an opening scripture but that
[26:42] opening scripture is just to
[26:44] start pointing you in the right
[26:45] direction what he really intended to
[26:46] preach on in christ is the mystery of
[26:48] god revealed
[26:49] is the entire bible because the entire
[26:52] bible has been one purpose
[26:54] one goal one great work that god wanted
[26:57] to achieve
[26:58] and he had already declared it from the
[27:00] beginning
[27:01] amen and it already got marred and now
[27:04] he's he's reworking that masterpiece
[27:06] image to bring it all back to what it
[27:09] was and this whole bible
[27:10] is about god restoring back all that's
[27:13] been lost
[27:16] so now with this key we have a key of
[27:19] revelation
[27:20] a key of understanding because now
[27:22] everything in this
[27:23] bible must fit into that purpose
[27:27] if we start to get things in here that
[27:29] that don't relate to that purpose do not
[27:32] fit into this purpose
[27:33] then we have to ask ourselves what
[27:35] picture are we painting
[27:36] [Music]
[27:38] where are our puzzle pieces what picture
[27:40] what is the picture we're trying to get
[27:42] back to what is the thing we're trying
[27:43] to display
[27:44] because god has one work one goal one
[27:47] purpose
[27:48] one thing one heart's purpose that he's
[27:50] had in his heart
[27:51] amen to have a bride after his own
[27:53] choosing and every work that he's worked
[27:55] has been working to this
[27:56] end and now if we begin to look at the
[28:00] scriptures
[28:01] and we can't see that theme in the
[28:04] scriptures we're looking at
[28:05] amen then it's time to ask god for some
[28:07] revelation because
[28:08] because we're going to get something
[28:10] misfit somewhere
[28:13] because that's god's purpose and so
[28:18] we find then through the old testament
[28:22] the prophet of god tells us that god was
[28:24] building his body back
[28:26] and through the prophets amen through
[28:28] the law and through the the
[28:30] prophets it was based on the pedicle of
[28:32] the the four patriarchs
[28:34] and then then it was built up through
[28:36] the prophets and through the psalms and
[28:38] all of these things and until finally it
[28:40] come to the head
[28:41] which was a man jesus christ
[28:44] a perfect man the perfect lamb of god
[28:48] the the body that god made for himself
[28:50] to dwell in
[28:52] and that was the last adam or the
[28:55] restoration
[28:56] of adam but god already declared from
[29:00] the beginning what he would do
[29:03] his goal was not to get adam back in
[29:07] place as a singular figure
[29:11] with dominion now now jesus christ comes
[29:13] to the end of his ministry and he says
[29:15] all power in heaven and earth is given
[29:17] unto me
[29:20] what he's come back to to what adam lost
[29:23] and more because now he's reconciled
[29:25] heaven and earth not just
[29:26] the earth so all power in heaven and
[29:30] earth is given unto me
[29:32] and you think that's it finish line
[29:35] no not finish line because adam dwelt
[29:39] alone
[29:39] and god said it is not good
[29:43] it's not adam was there naming the
[29:46] animals he was there as
[29:47] god he was there as a god over the earth
[29:50] he was there
[29:50] doing uh he was the minor god he was the
[29:53] image of god
[29:54] he was he was there in a perfect setting
[29:57] in a perfect world but god would look
[29:58] down
[29:59] and see his he would see his son he
[30:02] would see
[30:03] oh go back to god's language
[30:07] genesis chapter 1 we'll make a man in
[30:09] our image after our likeness
[30:11] and he made them male and female
[30:14] he made them so when god made it in his
[30:17] image he made it male and female so the
[30:19] image of god is expressed in male and
[30:21] female
[30:23] and we look there at adam when adam was
[30:25] made in flesh there in the garden
[30:26] he was both male and female
[30:29] and god said this is not good
[30:33] that he should dwell alone and so
[30:35] although he had power
[30:37] although he had never sinned he was in
[30:38] perfection everything was just
[30:40] right seemingly it was just right it
[30:43] wasn't just right
[30:44] because it wasn't good that he should be
[30:46] alone
[30:48] because from the very beginning before
[30:51] there was a beginning
[30:52] before you could say beginning back in
[30:56] the eternal before there was time before
[30:57] there was creation before there was
[30:59] anything
[30:59] god had a heart purpose and what he's
[31:02] doing in genesis is declaring his heart
[31:04] purpose
[31:06] he looks down he says it's not good
[31:09] that's not good that man shall dwell
[31:11] alone
[31:11] i will make it help me and the only help
[31:14] me he could find
[31:16] was the help meet that will come from
[31:18] the side
[31:20] the ingredients for the help me were in
[31:23] adam because he had already made him
[31:25] male and female
[31:27] he was already made male and female in
[31:29] the spirit he was put in the flesh so he
[31:30] took a piece of his flesh
[31:32] and split the feminine spirit and put it
[31:34] into another vessel
[31:35] and he combined them back together amen
[31:37] and there was a prophecy that went forth
[31:39] from adam and said
[31:40] for this reason shall man leave his
[31:42] father and mother amen
[31:44] and they these twain shall be one
[31:48] and god said it is very good
[31:52] so when he worked through the old
[31:54] testament building
[31:55] building building building till he got
[31:58] all the way up to the perfect image of a
[32:00] restored atom
[32:02] the bible calls him the last adam why
[32:05] they'll never
[32:05] need another the last adam
[32:09] jesus christ the lamb of god the son of
[32:12] god
[32:13] he's standing upon the earth now he's
[32:16] done what god said he
[32:17] he's there decreeing lord i've done all
[32:19] that you asked me to do i've done only
[32:20] what the father showed me i've kept all
[32:22] of his word
[32:23] i've done everything that he told for me
[32:25] to do and he says all power in heaven
[32:26] and earth is given unto
[32:28] me but you realize
[32:31] we know that that's not the finish
[32:34] and how can we tell well we've got the
[32:36] benefit of being
[32:37] here at this end in 2020 looking back
[32:40] and say well it wasn't done then but in
[32:42] that day
[32:43] you could say it's not done if you
[32:45] understood what isaiah was saying that
[32:47] he declared the end from the beginning
[32:49] and if that's true then it can't be the
[32:52] last atom restored in a singular vessel
[32:54] now within that vessel has to be the
[32:57] female
[32:58] because it was already declared from the
[33:00] beginning the end will have to show the
[33:02] same thing the beginning showed
[33:03] and so now inside that singular vessel
[33:07] of jesus christ
[33:08] there was a bride inside and that's why
[33:10] god smote him
[33:12] through the rib amen took out the
[33:14] ingredients to make a bride
[33:15] amen and for seven church ages for the
[33:17] new testament
[33:18] he's now been building back the bride
[33:23] so now the whole bible declares
[33:26] one purpose one goal
[33:30] not 66 books one story
[33:33] one heart purpose one desire
[33:36] and everything has been working to this
[33:39] one
[33:40] desire old testament come to the
[33:43] headstone
[33:45] come through the capping off and there
[33:47] was a man
[33:48] with the fullness of god dwelling inside
[33:51] and then that man was male and female
[33:54] god would take that man to calvary like
[33:56] he took adam
[33:57] laid him down and smote him in the side
[34:00] took out what he needed to make
[34:03] his bride the spirit come out of christ
[34:07] amen the water and the blood came out
[34:09] and would begin to make a bride and
[34:11] now that bride would begin to be formed
[34:14] over seven
[34:15] church ages but in the end time
[34:20] what's he going to do at the end friends
[34:22] what's going to happen at the end of the
[34:24] seven church ages
[34:25] how will we know where is the prophecy
[34:28] laying where's the image that's going to
[34:29] tell us what's going to happen
[34:31] go back to genesis
[34:35] what's he going to do at the end after
[34:36] he gets his bride formed and fashioned
[34:38] and made
[34:39] and got to the place that she's supposed
[34:41] to be now
[34:43] he's going to bring adam back on the
[34:46] scene
[34:48] adam was asleep during the forming of
[34:51] amen amen adam was asleep during the
[34:54] forming of
[34:55] of his bride amen in jesus christ amen
[34:57] have been separated because
[34:59] because of the fallen nature of man and
[35:01] because of the fall through the first
[35:02] church ages
[35:03] he had been absent amen but now he's
[35:05] been building and building and building
[35:07] and building his bride
[35:08] but at the end what's he going to do
[35:10] he's going to do the same thing he did
[35:12] in genesis
[35:13] he's going to take these two and put
[35:14] them together and they'll no more
[35:16] between but they will be one
[35:19] one flesh one body one head united to
[35:22] one body
[35:23] amen connected together and you're gonna
[35:25] see the oneness displayed
[35:27] in the last day and god will declare it
[35:30] is now
[35:31] very good
[35:35] praise be to god see friends
[35:39] where do we find what we believe
[35:42] it's the whole bible
[35:46] that's why that's why
[35:49] you can have somebody ask you questions
[35:52] about the seventh seal what's the seven
[35:54] seals seven seals of mystery
[35:56] the seventh seal listen the mystery's
[35:58] been unveiled
[36:01] but what is the mystery where is it
[36:03] where is the seventh seal brother bear
[36:04] said i can show you all the way back in
[36:06] genesis the seventh seal coming right up
[36:09] what is the seventh seal it's the coming
[36:11] of the lord
[36:13] how is the lord coming amen the same way
[36:17] god made his first son coming in the
[36:20] form of
[36:21] man then splitting off of the man the
[36:23] feminine then uniting the two back
[36:24] together
[36:25] what is that that's the seventh seal
[36:29] what's this whole bible declaring the
[36:31] mystery of the seventh seal
[36:34] when those seals came off the bible it
[36:35] opened up the whole bible
[36:37] the whole bible has one mystery that one
[36:39] mystery has three folds
[36:40] amen to get preeminence in a man amen
[36:43] the last adam
[36:44] jesus christ he did that jesus christ
[36:45] get preeminence in the bride he's doing
[36:47] that now and to what
[36:48] restore back to the garden of eden
[36:51] that's the whole bible friends what is
[36:53] that that's the seventh seal
[36:55] so where's the sims deal show me the
[36:57] scripture show me where it's open
[37:00] where do you want me to start i mean
[37:02] should we just start genesis 1 1 and
[37:04] read all the way through
[37:06] it's all the seventh seal it's the
[37:08] seventh seal and then
[37:09] coming right on down through and god's
[37:12] showing us what
[37:13] his heart's purpose has been he never
[37:17] let out the mystery all at once and
[37:19] he only let it out in parts never
[37:20] revealing the whole mystery but he would
[37:22] save that for the end time
[37:25] and he doesn't tell everybody he only
[37:27] tells those
[37:28] who can receive it
[37:36] ram says in christ is the mystery god
[37:37] revealed
[37:39] is it predestinated there's the mystery
[37:43] he before christ or anything else was
[37:45] ever on the earth you see his great
[37:46] mystery
[37:47] that he chose the bride knowing eve
[37:50] would fall
[37:50] from disbelieving the word knowing that
[37:52] she would fall
[37:54] but he would choose a bride that would
[37:55] not fall that would hold to that word
[37:57] regardless of what all the rest of the
[37:59] world had to say about it
[38:01] they would hold to that word they are
[38:03] predestinated
[38:05] to stand there the adoption of children
[38:07] by jesus christ
[38:09] predestinated the church to that great
[38:12] glorious stand
[38:14] now remember we're talking about
[38:15] adoption and that word adoption is two
[38:17] words combined together that means the
[38:19] sun
[38:20] placed or set or put so it's the placing
[38:22] of a sun
[38:23] a sun that was already a sun a sun
[38:25] that's been a sun all along
[38:27] but that sun now is taken after it's
[38:29] after the sun's matured been tested by
[38:31] the tudor been
[38:32] trained by the holy ghost and placed
[38:33] into a position
[38:35] of power and authority and so now
[38:38] brother brennam's saying
[38:39] now he's going to he knew he knew that
[38:42] eve would fall
[38:43] but he had in his mind already
[38:46] hart's desire to have a bride after his
[38:48] own choosing she was predestinated
[38:51] she was predestinated not to fall
[38:54] i tell you friends if that doesn't take
[38:56] the scare and worry away i don't know
[38:57] what will
[38:58] amen no i'm afraid i'm going to fall
[39:00] away i'm afraid i'm going to backslide
[39:02] my if you're part of this you can never
[39:05] backslide enough to take yourself
[39:07] out of the mind of god in his heart
[39:09] purpose that he decreed before the
[39:11] foundation of the world
[39:12] what he determined the names that he
[39:14] wrote in the lands book of life
[39:15] before the foundation of the world
[39:16] there's not an eraser that can erase
[39:18] that there's not a deed you can do
[39:20] there's not a backsliding that you can
[39:22] do to take yourself
[39:23] out of that book if you were placed
[39:25] there before the foundation of the world
[39:28] as a bride as a as the elect member of
[39:30] the bride
[39:31] if you were placed there as an elected
[39:33] member of the bride amen
[39:35] chosen to be part of this final bride
[39:37] amen there's nothing you can do or
[39:39] anybody
[39:40] else can do to take you out of that
[39:43] so let all the scare go away just relax
[39:46] and be what god called you to be and let
[39:48] god flow through you
[39:49] all that nervous tension and fear and
[39:51] worry up and down
[39:52] it's never going to accomplish the
[39:54] purpose of god in our lives is going to
[39:56] tie us up in knots and bind us down
[39:58] amen we've got to get rid of that and
[40:00] say if god's word is true and i know
[40:02] that his word is true
[40:03] and i believe that i'm part of that word
[40:05] then i
[40:06] can no more fail than god can fail
[40:09] no more be lost than god can be lost if
[40:12] i'm a part of god
[40:13] if i've come from the mind of god if god
[40:16] knew me before the foundation of the
[40:17] world and determined that i would be
[40:19] here to play this part
[40:20] amen nothing is going to take that away
[40:22] from me
[40:24] so now what do i do now every bluff and
[40:27] scare tactic and mind battle of the
[40:28] devil
[40:29] i just resist it in jesus name because i
[40:31] already have my feet
[40:32] planted on a solid rock of god's word
[40:34] that is not shifting
[40:36] that has not moved since before there
[40:37] were rocks
[40:40] before there was a rock before there was
[40:41] an atom before there was a molecule or a
[40:43] bit of star dust
[40:44] he already decreed that i would be here
[40:46] in this day and not fail
[40:49] that's a rock that we can stand on
[40:51] friends that will give us confidence to
[40:53] face every trial
[40:55] face every trial every circumstance
[40:58] that comes our way the devil
[41:01] he's always bluffing bluff tactics and
[41:04] the scary thing is these bluffs look so
[41:06] real but we know this life is the vapor
[41:10] the mist the real ones on the other side
[41:15] so he can make the vapor and mist look
[41:17] so scary but don't
[41:18] don't worry this is the temporal not the
[41:21] permanent
[41:22] the permanent's coming
[41:26] he he said there would be a bride that
[41:28] would not fall regardless of what all
[41:30] the rest of the world had to say about
[41:32] it
[41:32] they would hold to that word they are
[41:35] predestined to stand there
[41:37] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[41:40] predestinated the church to that great
[41:43] glorious stand
[41:46] how will i stand when all the pressure
[41:47] comes how will i stand all the rejection
[41:49] how will i stand
[41:50] if the whole world turns against the
[41:52] message how will i stand
[41:54] because you've been chosen predestinated
[41:58] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[42:00] christ you've already been
[42:01] placed to make the stand in the mind of
[42:05] god that's your position
[42:06] the bride's position in the end this is
[42:09] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[42:11] if you're here at the end time and
[42:13] you're part of the bride
[42:14] then you've been adopted or positioned
[42:16] or placed in the mind of god before the
[42:18] foundation world
[42:19] to make the last stand in the last day
[42:23] and you won't fail
[42:26] how will i do it i don't know but look
[42:29] how everything else worked out in the
[42:30] bible
[42:32] i mean read the bible god's plan has
[42:34] never been thwarted
[42:35] his purpose has never been overrun i
[42:37] mean he's never lost
[42:38] yet everything that he chose to do he's
[42:40] doing everything that looked like it was
[42:42] going bad worked out good
[42:44] i don't know how he's going to do it but
[42:46] he's going to do it
[42:48] and that's my adopted place my place is
[42:50] to make that stand on the word and not
[42:52] fail on the word
[42:54] if god chose me to do that before the
[42:56] foundation of the world
[42:57] that he must have a mechanism in place
[42:59] that'll ensure that i get the job done
[43:02] he's not just depending uh you know he's
[43:05] not just depending on the fallacy of
[43:07] human flesh and a human
[43:09] intellect in a human mind but he has
[43:11] unlocked or released his spirit in full
[43:14] measure in this day
[43:15] because the spirit of god's been bound
[43:17] through false understanding and false
[43:19] teaching and false doctrine
[43:21] and got everybody so cobbled up and
[43:23] confused in their minds they don't know
[43:24] where they came from they
[43:26] don't know who they are they don't know
[43:27] what their purpose is on life and they
[43:29] don't know what god's plan is next
[43:33] but god amen and because the word was
[43:36] bound by denomination and doctrines and
[43:38] ideas of man the holy ghost was limited
[43:41] chained
[43:42] bound could not move in freedom but god
[43:44] had a mechanism in place
[43:46] in the last day because he had a bride
[43:49] chosen in him his heart's purpose to
[43:51] have a bride of his own choosing
[43:53] who would not fail on the word who would
[43:55] make the last stand
[43:56] who would reverse whatever was done by
[43:59] eve this bride is going to reverse the
[44:01] damage that was done there
[44:04] because she's not going to fail the same
[44:06] way amen
[44:09] so what mechanism did he release he
[44:12] opened his word
[44:14] he took the seals off of the book
[44:18] and when he took the seals off of the
[44:20] book the holy ghost himself
[44:24] in full measure came to abide in his
[44:28] bride
[44:29] and now it's not you or i but it's
[44:32] christ
[44:33] in me the hope of glory
[44:37] now it's not it's not just all the
[44:39] mechanisms that i had in my brain when i
[44:41] was born and all the ability that i had
[44:43] gained through life
[44:44] but there was something more amen
[44:46] there's a literal life of jesus christ
[44:49] abiding in his
[44:50] bride giving her
[44:53] the ability the strength to stand on the
[44:55] word and not
[44:56] fail by one word you realize
[44:59] eve fell by one word
[45:04] that means this bride cannot fail on
[45:06] even one word or she's in the same
[45:08] position that first bride was
[45:11] so she must stand on all the word how
[45:14] are we going to do it brother chad i
[45:15] don't even know that i understand it all
[45:17] it doesn't matter amen he's here he's
[45:19] leading us he's guiding us it's his
[45:21] spirit
[45:22] it's christ in us the hope of glory we
[45:25] just have to yield to that and trust in
[45:27] that
[45:27] trust in what he's made us trust in
[45:29] where he's put us
[45:32] you know he didn't call you in luther's
[45:35] day
[45:38] he called you today
[45:42] he didn't place you in another age he
[45:45] placed you today
[45:47] if he placed you today there's a purpose
[45:48] to be fulfilled in that place
[45:52] see he says i'm going to repeat this
[45:54] last statement he said regardless of
[45:55] what all the rest of the world had to
[45:56] say about it
[45:57] they would hold to the word they are
[45:59] predestinated to stand there the
[46:00] adoption of children by jesus christ
[46:03] predestinated the church to that great
[46:05] glorious stand
[46:06] now you see this secret now you see the
[46:10] secret do you see it now
[46:11] what's the secret amen she's the secret
[46:17] how do you know she's the secret because
[46:19] the beginning declares the end
[46:22] there was a secret in adam
[46:26] when god made adam and put him in flesh
[46:28] there was a secret in adam because there
[46:29] was a woman in adam
[46:31] and the animals could rub up against him
[46:33] and the animals could hear his voice and
[46:35] hear him call and he could speak and
[46:37] name them and he could do all the things
[46:38] that he could do in creation
[46:40] amen but there was a mystery there was a
[46:42] secret inside adam
[46:44] and that god intended for that secret to
[46:46] be expressed
[46:48] and that secret was a bride and then
[46:51] i wonder how surprised all the animals
[46:53] were when all of a sudden they saw
[46:54] two but had to realize that there's not
[46:58] two there's only one
[47:02] it's still hard for some of these
[47:03] animals
[47:07] to recognize it looks like two it looks
[47:10] like more than two
[47:11] it looks like a mini member body it
[47:13] looks like
[47:14] fingers toes hands it looks like
[47:16] thousands it looks like down through the
[47:18] church ages
[47:19] all compiled together it looks like
[47:21] possibly millions
[47:22] amen but they don't realize that's just
[47:24] one
[47:28] now you see a secret what too to restore
[47:31] falun eve as she was a prefigure
[47:34] of the church and now notice as god
[47:36] opened up the side of adam and took out
[47:38] eve by his own flesh and blood and
[47:40] divided his spirit from masculine and
[47:41] feminist to feminists
[47:43] and put it in eve took the rib from
[47:45] under his side and made eve out of it so
[47:46] god did the same thing
[47:48] taking out of the sight of christ the
[47:49] blood and the water and christ is the
[47:51] word and taking the word
[47:53] making up his church eve see back to
[47:55] himself
[47:56] again he's not making something else
[48:00] back to himself again redeemed by the
[48:03] blood that was come from his body
[48:05] you see it now god's great mystery
[48:09] now being unfolded that's been hid since
[48:11] the foundation of the world
[48:13] but pete prefigured it all the way down
[48:15] through now watch we find that
[48:18] he did that he did that and here here in
[48:21] ephesians and many other places
[48:23] but they will give you enough to now
[48:26] down through the ages he has been slowly
[48:28] unfolding this mystery that's why we say
[48:31] the whole bible is one story
[48:33] it's down through the ages he's been
[48:34] unfolding this mystery
[48:36] and now we've come to the end time where
[48:38] god is taking the mystery
[48:40] away from the mystery you realize
[48:44] it's not a mystery anymore it's a secret
[48:52] it's a mystery to the animals
[48:56] but to the children of god it's a secret
[48:59] because he's whispered his love secrets
[49:01] in our ears he's revealed to us the
[49:03] mysteries for us
[49:04] it's no longer a mystery it's a secret
[49:11] in the stature of a perfect man i'm
[49:13] going to spend some time in this message
[49:15] brother ben preached this in october of
[49:17] 1962.
[49:19] he said in this morning we want to speak
[49:21] on the subject or teach rather if we can
[49:24] building the living tabernacle building
[49:26] the living tabernacle of the living
[49:28] god's dwelling place
[49:30] the perfect man the living tabernacle
[49:33] of the living god where he dwells so
[49:36] when
[49:36] when brother bran was preaching stature
[49:38] of a perfect man this is his subject
[49:41] so he's talking about statue of a
[49:42] perfect man we can many of us know
[49:44] statute of perfect man we've read it
[49:45] we've listened to it he starts talking
[49:46] about the virtues that are in first
[49:48] peter and we'll turn there and read
[49:49] through those
[49:50] and you know you have all these virtues
[49:52] that are building up to the capstone of
[49:54] love seven virtues and the eighth
[49:56] is love and and we we can see this we
[49:58] can look at this
[50:00] um we can we we can look at this message
[50:04] and almost begin to look at it
[50:06] mechanically in a way
[50:07] that that these are steps of progression
[50:10] that
[50:11] i've got to go to faith and i got to go
[50:12] to temperance and i've got to go to all
[50:14] these things
[50:15] but what brother bannon's really trying
[50:17] to get us to back up and see
[50:18] is that god is building a living
[50:20] tabernacle for he himself to live in
[50:23] that's his subject and so don't don't
[50:26] lose the subject with all the details
[50:27] but focus on the subject
[50:29] and i'll read again this morning we want
[50:31] to speak on the subject or teach
[50:32] rather if we can building the living
[50:34] tabernacle
[50:36] now his title statue of a perfect man
[50:38] but his subject is building the living
[50:40] tabernacle
[50:41] building the living tabernacle of the
[50:43] living god's dwelling place
[50:44] the perfect man the living tabernacle of
[50:47] the living god
[50:48] where he dwells
[50:51] where is god in his dwelling place
[50:54] in his tabernacle where is that brother
[50:57] brethren's trying to show us
[51:00] let's go to ii peter we'll read some of
[51:03] this together
[51:16] second peter chapter one
[51:21] verse 3
[51:28] according as his divine power hath given
[51:30] unto us all things that pertain unto
[51:32] life and godliness
[51:33] through the knowledge of him that hath
[51:35] called us to glory
[51:36] and virtue whereby are given unto us
[51:40] exceeding great and precious promises
[51:42] that by these you might be partakers of
[51:44] the divine nature
[51:45] having escaped the corruption that is in
[51:47] the world through lust so i'm going to
[51:49] stop here and look
[51:50] at this word partakers of the divine
[51:52] nature you know we're given exceeding
[51:54] and great precious promises
[51:55] that by these you might be partakers of
[51:57] the divine nature
[51:59] amen and when i when i think sometimes
[52:02] if a partaker is something that
[52:04] you take or you take it to yourself or
[52:07] you take and you partake of it you eat
[52:08] it or whatever
[52:09] commune on it but i looked the word up
[52:11] partakers and
[52:12] in the word here means a partner
[52:16] an associate a comrade or a companion
[52:20] so it's not that we're just feeding on
[52:22] the divine nature or taking bits of it
[52:24] but we're called to be a partner in the
[52:26] divine nature a comrade a companion
[52:29] in the divine nature why it's back to
[52:31] male and female again
[52:34] his nature in her so by these precious
[52:37] promises
[52:38] we are made to be a partner an associate
[52:41] a comrade
[52:42] a companion of the divine nature having
[52:46] escaped the corruption is in the world
[52:47] through lust
[52:49] and beside this giving all diligence add
[52:51] to your faith virtue and virtue
[52:53] knowledge and knowledge temperance and
[52:54] temperance patience
[52:55] and patience godliness and godliness
[52:57] brotherly kindness
[52:58] and the brotherly kindness charity for
[53:01] if these things be in you and abound
[53:03] they make you that you should neither be
[53:04] barren
[53:05] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[53:07] lord jesus christ
[53:10] back to stature of a perfect man
[53:14] in paragraph 77 a body has thou prepared
[53:16] me god dwells in the stature of a man
[53:19] reflecting himself into that being
[53:21] perfect
[53:22] worship i just want to stop and think
[53:25] about that
[53:25] perfect worship oh i mean we could try
[53:29] to get the atmosphere just right in here
[53:32] and the songs just right and come and
[53:34] pray just right
[53:35] amen but but if we just come into a
[53:37] building and try to sing the right songs
[53:39] and
[53:40] hear the right word is that the right
[53:41] atmosphere we could never have perfect
[53:43] worship
[53:44] because perfect worship is when deity is
[53:46] tabernacled inside of you
[53:48] and you have fellowship with god in you
[53:54] christ in you the hope of glory amen
[53:57] jesus told his disciples
[53:58] my father and i we will come to you and
[54:00] make our abode with you
[54:03] this has been the purpose amen from the
[54:05] beginning that god would dwell
[54:07] in man amen
[54:14] he says a body has to help prepared me
[54:17] god dwells in the stature of a man
[54:19] reflecting himself into that being
[54:21] perfect worship god in us being his
[54:24] tabernacle
[54:25] god manifesting in worship when we use
[54:29] the word worship
[54:30] there's we we have the terms praise and
[54:32] worship praise is to sing out or shout
[54:35] out his declaration or to speak
[54:36] out his glory or to sing a song but
[54:39] worship
[54:40] really means to bow down in subjection
[54:43] to
[54:44] so we're going to have perfect worship
[54:45] perfect worship is the same as allowing
[54:48] him to have preeminence
[54:50] so god wants to be tabernacled in flesh
[54:54] in human flesh god wants to dwell in the
[54:57] tabernacle of human flesh
[54:59] amen and to have perfect worship there
[55:02] we have to worship by subjection by
[55:04] bowing down and allowing god to have
[55:07] absolute preeminence in us so there's no
[55:10] longer our thoughts
[55:11] our desires but it's his word on display
[55:14] through us it's his thoughts
[55:15] his will his desire
[55:18] perfect worship tabernacled
[55:21] uh being his tabernacle god manifesting
[55:24] oh how we could stay on that to
[55:25] you almost suffocating here from the
[55:27] heat notice that god has always at all
[55:30] time
[55:30] reflected himself in man
[55:34] further down the same message we're not
[55:35] building an organization
[55:38] i'm not here this morning to build an
[55:40] organization christ never sent me to
[55:42] build an organization
[55:43] christ sent me to build individuals to
[55:46] the stature of jesus christ
[55:48] that they might be the powerhouse and
[55:50] the dwelling place of the spirit
[55:52] by his word by his word see building up
[55:55] the individual to that place
[55:57] not building an organization to a
[55:59] greater denomination
[56:00] but build the individual to sons and
[56:02] daughters of god
[56:04] oh i tell you friends if brother banham
[56:06] wanted to he could have built a whole
[56:08] movement centered around himself he
[56:10] could have been the the great
[56:12] the almost like a god upon the earth
[56:14] with a denomination around him
[56:16] but he recognized that wasn't his
[56:18] purpose amen if he had done that he
[56:20] would have defeated the purpose of god
[56:22] because the purpose of god amen was not
[56:24] to just have another prophet that would
[56:26] show up like jeremiah isaiah or all that
[56:28] but he was wanting an eleazer to go and
[56:30] call him a bride
[56:32] amen he was he was wanting something
[56:34] more amen not just another
[56:37] display of power not just another
[56:39] demonstration of god's power and ability
[56:41] but he wanted to he wanted to show and
[56:43] vindicate this vessel
[56:44] so that the bride would trust this
[56:46] vessel so that he could go and fetch a
[56:48] bride
[56:49] amen for the son
[56:52] and so he said i we're not here building
[56:55] an organization
[56:57] we're not trying to have the best church
[57:01] waste of time we're not here trying
[57:04] to have the best assembly the bestest or
[57:06] the best at or the best church or do
[57:08] things the best way
[57:10] it's all an absolute waste of time
[57:12] friends because someday this building is
[57:13] going to crumble
[57:14] it's going to be on fire it's going to
[57:16] be whatever it's going to be
[57:18] amen but the purpose that we have amen
[57:21] is to go he says christ sent me to build
[57:24] individuals to the stature of jesus
[57:26] christ that
[57:27] they might be the powerhouse and the
[57:30] dwelling place of the spirit
[57:31] by his word that's why if
[57:34] we as a body of believers are successful
[57:36] in this amen it doesn't matter if the
[57:38] church disappears the building
[57:40] disappears tomorrow
[57:41] amen if we've worked to make individuals
[57:44] into the stature of jesus christ so that
[57:46] they will be the powerhouse of the
[57:47] spirit
[57:48] the work of god will diminish not one
[57:50] fraction of a second
[57:51] if this place vanishes
[57:55] if it burns down to the ground in an
[57:58] hour's time
[57:59] amen nothing will stop because our
[58:01] purpose is not to have a nice building
[58:03] nice church nice group of believers
[58:05] better than everybody else
[58:06] the purpose is to build children amen
[58:08] unto the stature of jesus christ that
[58:11] they might be the
[58:12] individual powerhouse themselves of the
[58:14] spirit
[58:17] the empowerment the encouragement the
[58:20] establishment
[58:21] the adopted placing of the bride of
[58:23] jesus christ is our only focus
[58:26] to call those at the bride amen saying
[58:29] come out of her my people and be ye
[58:31] separate
[58:32] and then move them into the stature of
[58:34] jesus christ by the word so that they're
[58:36] established on the word so that they
[58:38] become a partaker
[58:40] of the divine nature
[58:43] and they become the powerhouse of the
[58:45] spirit by his word
[58:49] brother branham is basically just
[58:51] quoting ephesians 4 the purpose of the
[58:53] faithful ministry
[58:54] ephesians 4 11 and he gave some apostles
[58:57] and some prophets and some evangelists
[58:58] and some pastors and teachers
[59:00] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[59:02] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[59:04] the body of christ that's the building
[59:06] up
[59:07] till we all come in the unity of faith
[59:10] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[59:12] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[59:14] the stature of the fullness of christ
[59:18] so what what's the purpose of the
[59:19] faithful ministry
[59:22] to build individuals into the statue of
[59:23] jesus christ so that they might be the
[59:25] powerhouse of the spirit
[59:27] by the word
[59:30] i'd say it this way
[59:34] the church is not here to support the
[59:36] ministry
[59:38] the ministry is here to support the
[59:39] church
[59:41] the bride to help the bride find her
[59:44] place to help the bride awaken to the
[59:46] word be established on the word
[59:48] to her place because she's to be
[59:52] one with christ she's to be the
[59:54] manifestation of jesus christ on the
[59:55] earth
[59:57] not only in the pulpit but in the body
[1:00:02] brother said again in the statue of a
[1:00:05] perfect man
[1:00:07] now that is the house that god dwells in
[1:00:08] not a building with a big bell on top of
[1:00:10] it
[1:00:11] and a high steeple see but a body has
[1:00:14] thou prepared me
[1:00:15] now if you think really clearly when
[1:00:18] brother man starts using this term a
[1:00:20] body has thou prepared me
[1:00:22] he is speaking of the tabernacle of
[1:00:24] jesus christ
[1:00:25] the old testament prophecy of jesus
[1:00:28] christ coming
[1:00:29] he says uh uh but uh but but god doesn't
[1:00:32] dwell on the temple made by hands but a
[1:00:34] body has thou prepared me
[1:00:36] showing that he was going to dwell in a
[1:00:38] body in the body of jesus christ
[1:00:40] now brother branham is picking up that
[1:00:42] same scripture
[1:00:45] you realize friends that scripture that
[1:00:48] that every other church knows about that
[1:00:50] everybody else in a in the christian
[1:00:52] world knows and they can apply that to
[1:00:54] jesus christ but a body house thou made
[1:00:56] me he comes suddenly into his temple
[1:00:58] amen the temple of jesus christ the body
[1:01:00] god dwelled in in fullness
[1:01:02] the fullness of the godhead bodily amen
[1:01:04] we can apply that scripture but there
[1:01:05] come a prophet in our day that can pick
[1:01:07] that scripture back up and say but it's
[1:01:09] not done
[1:01:10] yet how do you know it's not done yet
[1:01:12] because the
[1:01:13] beginning declared the end we haven't
[1:01:15] hit the end yet until we've seen what
[1:01:17] we've seen in the beginning
[1:01:19] [Music]
[1:01:20] so he picks that scripture you see why
[1:01:23] understanding how he declared the
[1:01:25] the in from the beginning shows you how
[1:01:27] to place the scriptures
[1:01:29] brother branham knew that that scripture
[1:01:31] wasn't done
[1:01:34] so he can pick it up and he says but a
[1:01:36] body has thou prepared me
[1:01:37] a body that god can dwell and god can
[1:01:40] walk and god can see
[1:01:41] and god can talk and god can work and
[1:01:43] amen
[1:01:44] living instrumentality of god
[1:01:47] god walking on two feet in you
[1:01:51] glory the footsteps of the righteous is
[1:01:53] ordered of god
[1:01:54] god walking in you for ye are written
[1:01:57] epistles read of all men
[1:01:59] and if the life that is in christ be in
[1:02:01] you you'll bear the life that christ
[1:02:03] bore
[1:02:04] this is this is the way if we recognize
[1:02:08] the last adam that's wonderful we
[1:02:09] recognize the whole christian world
[1:02:11] recognizes the last adam
[1:02:12] but you realize that's not the complete
[1:02:15] heart's desire of god
[1:02:16] amen when god saw that in the beginning
[1:02:19] he said it
[1:02:20] wasn't good that he should dwell alone
[1:02:22] he was going to make a help me
[1:02:23] so if we stop there we've stopped in the
[1:02:26] not good
[1:02:27] part the incomplete masterpiece the
[1:02:30] unfinished work
[1:02:31] i mean we've got to the place where we
[1:02:33] stopped before god stopped because god
[1:02:36] didn't stop and rest until he finally
[1:02:37] had these two back together as one
[1:02:46] so it's god walking on two feet in you
[1:02:52] god walking in you
[1:02:56] i know that's a tall order friends but
[1:02:59] it's the truth
[1:03:02] it sounds so impossible sometimes to
[1:03:05] human intellect but it's what god wanted
[1:03:08] it's his heart purpose from the
[1:03:09] beginning
[1:03:12] when john the baptist come walking out
[1:03:14] of the wilderness
[1:03:16] clothed in camel skins and eating
[1:03:18] locusts and he says repent
[1:03:21] for the kingdom of god as i hand
[1:03:24] it was god walking in two feet
[1:03:29] because john the baptist was the literal
[1:03:31] manifestation of the word
[1:03:35] and god is the word in the beginning was
[1:03:37] the word
[1:03:39] the word was with god and the word was
[1:03:40] god
[1:03:42] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:03:44] among us
[1:03:47] not only in jesus christ
[1:03:50] it was all encapsulated jesus christ all
[1:03:52] the word was there
[1:03:55] but it was the word in moses it was the
[1:03:57] word in jeremiah it was the word in
[1:03:59] david
[1:04:00] it was the word in solomon and all of it
[1:04:03] was in jesus christ
[1:04:06] but when john the batters come walking
[1:04:08] down
[1:04:09] amen it was the word of god walking out
[1:04:12] of the wilderness
[1:04:14] because the scripture said he would when
[1:04:18] he was
[1:04:18] when he was crying repent when he was
[1:04:20] calling them to repentance and baptism
[1:04:22] what was he doing he was making all the
[1:04:24] high places low
[1:04:26] and he's making all the low places high
[1:04:28] it was the word
[1:04:30] the word was now embodied in this
[1:04:33] vessel of john the baptist it was god
[1:04:35] the word
[1:04:36] encapsulated in a human being and he was
[1:04:39] the word
[1:04:40] walking on two feet
[1:04:46] jesus christ came the fulfillment of all
[1:04:49] the word
[1:04:51] come in him but now he's out a bride
[1:04:53] through seven church ages but he's
[1:04:54] promised that there would be a bride
[1:04:56] without spot a wrinkle one that was
[1:04:58] washed by the water of his word
[1:05:00] he's going to have a bride of his own
[1:05:02] choosing he will have a bride
[1:05:04] amen to declare at the end what he
[1:05:06] already showed at the beginning
[1:05:08] he will have a bride that will fully
[1:05:10] unite with jesus christ and the two
[1:05:12] shall be won
[1:05:14] it will happen because the beginning
[1:05:16] declares that he will happen
[1:05:17] so when you and i walk week by week and
[1:05:20] surrender and obedience to the word when
[1:05:22] we lay down
[1:05:22] our will and take his word when we
[1:05:24] surrender our thoughts and take what the
[1:05:26] prophet taught us on the word
[1:05:27] and let the word shape our thinking and
[1:05:29] not not the laodicea not the world
[1:05:32] amen not america culture but we let the
[1:05:34] word shape our thinking we repent to our
[1:05:36] foolishness
[1:05:37] and we take god's word we surrender our
[1:05:39] will to his we
[1:05:40] are the word god walking in skin again
[1:05:47] it's not it's not just i woke up and i i
[1:05:49] brush my teeth and
[1:05:50] i go about my business no this is the
[1:05:53] this is god's business
[1:05:56] you're here on god's business you're
[1:05:58] here on by god's plan by god's
[1:06:00] predestination by god's order by god's
[1:06:02] adoption
[1:06:03] placed you in this age
[1:06:06] and it is nothing less than the word of
[1:06:09] god walking in skin again
[1:06:13] when brother branham came and he was
[1:06:15] preaching and declaring all that he was
[1:06:17] declaring
[1:06:19] it was the same thing it was in john the
[1:06:20] baptist
[1:06:22] it was the word in flesh
[1:06:26] manifesting itself in that day
[1:06:29] we have no problem saying that was john
[1:06:32] the baptist we have no problem saying
[1:06:34] that was brother branham but we have a
[1:06:36] little bit of a problem when we bring it
[1:06:38] home to ourselves
[1:06:40] and i'll say we've got to go back and
[1:06:41] look at the beginning and if we got any
[1:06:43] struggle at all
[1:06:44] amen making that same making that same
[1:06:47] movement of thought and translating it
[1:06:49] into us as an individual
[1:06:51] we've got to go right back to the
[1:06:52] beginning again because until
[1:06:54] he's got a bride amen on this earth and
[1:06:56] united back to him
[1:06:58] that work is not done this bible is not
[1:07:01] complete
[1:07:02] [Music]
[1:07:04] and that's nothing less than the word
[1:07:07] it's not a sub word it's not a second
[1:07:09] word
[1:07:09] it's the word amen
[1:07:12] he is the word
[1:07:20] amen just a few things i just want to
[1:07:24] share i just
[1:07:25] i'm trying my hardest to take my time
[1:07:28] stop chad stop
[1:07:31] brother says in the statue of a perfect
[1:07:32] man
[1:07:34] he said these fellows once who required
[1:07:36] what these fellows are
[1:07:38] brother bam now he draws out on the
[1:07:39] board the statue of a perfect man
[1:07:42] and he lists these seven virtues going
[1:07:46] up to the capstone of
[1:07:47] of love and he goes all the way up
[1:07:52] and then he starts drawing the church
[1:07:54] ages beside it
[1:07:55] seven virtues seven church ages
[1:07:59] and now he's starting to say now these
[1:08:00] wasn't required what these was
[1:08:02] now he's showing that we've talked about
[1:08:05] so many times
[1:08:06] that that luther lived a greater life in
[1:08:09] the age of
[1:08:10] luther than they lived under the dark
[1:08:12] ages
[1:08:13] he recognized salvation by faith
[1:08:16] justification by faith
[1:08:17] amen and they began to move up and now
[1:08:20] there was more required to have that
[1:08:22] faith in the word and then then we moved
[1:08:25] into the wesleyan age and
[1:08:26] now they they had more than the lutheran
[1:08:28] age had because now they have
[1:08:29] sanctification
[1:08:30] you're justified but you also must live
[1:08:32] a clean and holy life
[1:08:35] and begin moving up and he said this one
[1:08:36] wasn't required but this was required
[1:08:38] and what he's showing is brother branham
[1:08:40] now has been talking about how
[1:08:42] god brings and he says the stature of a
[1:08:45] perfect man
[1:08:46] now when we look at the stature of a
[1:08:47] perfect man we could get all
[1:08:49] boggled up in our minds and we could say
[1:08:51] this is the stature of a man who never
[1:08:52] has any fault or failure ever in his
[1:08:54] life
[1:08:56] when you think well that'll never happen
[1:09:01] but he's saying when he's talking about
[1:09:02] the statue of a perfect man he's talking
[1:09:04] about a complete man or a mature man
[1:09:07] brother branham is talking about
[1:09:08] maturity which is exactly what ties into
[1:09:10] adoption
[1:09:12] because you adopt a son when he comes to
[1:09:14] maturity and shows himself a mature son
[1:09:17] so now he's talking about the stature of
[1:09:19] a complete or a mature
[1:09:21] son now he's talking about the church
[1:09:24] ages he goes from the individual
[1:09:26] now he flops over to the church and says
[1:09:27] see these weren't required what these
[1:09:29] were
[1:09:29] and this one's was required more than
[1:09:31] this and as it goes up as the revelation
[1:09:33] unfolds
[1:09:34] that there's more required because to
[1:09:35] whom much is given much is required
[1:09:37] so then he goes on and he says this
[1:09:40] wasn't required
[1:09:41] what this one was see but he brought his
[1:09:44] church up the same way
[1:09:45] he brought his church up the same way
[1:09:47] he's brought his people up
[1:09:51] and blasphemous names the next month
[1:09:53] just two weeks later he says
[1:09:55] this has to be first and when you have
[1:09:58] faith true knowledge
[1:09:59] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:10:01] love then the holy ghost comes down and
[1:10:03] seals you as a unit the same as he seals
[1:10:05] the church ages
[1:10:07] as a unit that's what i want to focus on
[1:10:10] now
[1:10:11] the same as he seals the church ages as
[1:10:14] a unit
[1:10:16] the way he makes his bride is the way he
[1:10:18] makes his individual
[1:10:19] made out of the same material like eve
[1:10:21] was made out of adam a rib from his side
[1:10:26] i want you to hold on to this thought
[1:10:28] and i'm going to go somewhere
[1:10:30] else i'm going to come back to this
[1:10:31] thought but
[1:10:33] when he gets to the statue of a perfect
[1:10:35] man and then again in blasphemous names
[1:10:38] he's starting to show that that that
[1:10:41] god's saying that that that at faith at
[1:10:44] the base
[1:10:45] amen somebody is born again amen they're
[1:10:47] born again by faith i mean they have the
[1:10:48] baptism of the holy ghost but they're
[1:10:50] working their way
[1:10:51] up in maturity and becoming a partaker
[1:10:54] they're sharing in the divine nature
[1:10:56] amen
[1:10:56] and at the top they come they come to
[1:10:58] maturity they come to completionist and
[1:11:00] they come to adoption
[1:11:02] i'll use those words and the holy ghost
[1:11:06] caps it off and fuses it all together
[1:11:08] and all these words that brother branham
[1:11:09] uses
[1:11:11] but he's describing this and he's going
[1:11:13] to flip over now and say
[1:11:14] now the church ages is the same way
[1:11:18] the way he does the individual that's
[1:11:19] the way he caps
[1:11:21] that's the way he encapsulates seals the
[1:11:23] church ages
[1:11:24] so now you realize whatever he's talking
[1:11:27] about for an individual
[1:11:28] the same thing's playing out for the
[1:11:30] church ages
[1:11:34] now brother branham says or no let's
[1:11:37] turn to matthew let's look at matthew
[1:11:38] together matthew 17.
[1:11:49] matthew 17.
[1:11:57] i'm going to really start getting into
[1:11:59] the meat of where i want to be
[1:12:02] all of that was foundation
[1:12:07] matthew 17 verse 1
[1:12:10] and after six days jesus taken peter
[1:12:13] james and john his brother and brought
[1:12:14] them
[1:12:14] up into a high mountain apart this is
[1:12:17] what we know as mount transfiguration
[1:12:19] it's amazing after six days
[1:12:23] there's going to be a mount
[1:12:24] transfiguration after six days
[1:12:27] or like maybe after six ages so
[1:12:30] matthew and mark uses the same language
[1:12:32] that after six days
[1:12:34] but luke is a little different luke says
[1:12:37] about an on the eighth day
[1:12:42] and you say what's going on here
[1:12:45] matthew and mark if we just read matthew
[1:12:47] and mark we would say
[1:12:49] after six days so on the seventh day
[1:12:52] amen we're going to have a mount
[1:12:53] transfiguration experience but luke goes
[1:12:56] over here and he throws a little wrench
[1:12:58] in the works
[1:12:59] he says about let's just look at it
[1:13:02] together let's go
[1:13:03] to luke chapter nine we've got time
[1:13:04] right we're not going anywhere
[1:13:08] oh you can i'll stay luke 9
[1:13:13] and i think it's verse 27 but let me
[1:13:16] look
[1:13:25] okay
[1:13:28] yeah luke 9 and 28 and it came to pass
[1:13:31] about an eight days after these sayings
[1:13:36] where did the seven go these guys should
[1:13:39] have got together before they wrote this
[1:13:41] because they're going to confuse people
[1:13:46] because we understand there's going to
[1:13:47] be something that takes place on the
[1:13:49] seventh day
[1:13:51] there's gonna be something that takes
[1:13:52] place in the seventh age but that thing
[1:13:54] that takes place in the seventh age is
[1:13:56] going to be a transition into the eighth
[1:14:00] the seventh is never mentioned after six
[1:14:02] after six
[1:14:03] and about on the eighth day and you
[1:14:05] wanna wonder what
[1:14:06] what are they talking about hey they're
[1:14:08] all talking about the same event
[1:14:10] they're not talking about two different
[1:14:11] events or two different happenings
[1:14:12] they're talking about the same event
[1:14:14] something's going to happen after six
[1:14:16] days that is going to bring them into
[1:14:19] the eighth day
[1:14:21] the bible is written so specific friends
[1:14:24] it's it's written
[1:14:25] the way it's written for a reason
[1:14:26] there's not contradictions
[1:14:28] there's mysteries laying there that god
[1:14:30] intends to move from a mystery to a
[1:14:32] secret
[1:14:35] so there's something going to happen
[1:14:36] after six days obviously on the seventh
[1:14:38] but but it's also going to be on the 8th
[1:14:44] amen if you can figure that out then i'm
[1:14:47] going to say there's a spirit of
[1:14:48] revelation in the room
[1:14:51] because we know we've if we've made that
[1:14:53] transition ourselves
[1:14:56] so let's keep reading back in matthew 17
[1:14:59] matthew 17 verse 1 and after six days
[1:15:02] jesus taken peter james and john his
[1:15:04] brother and bringeth them up into a high
[1:15:05] mountain apart
[1:15:06] and was transfigured before them and his
[1:15:08] face did shine as the sun
[1:15:10] and his raiment was white as the light
[1:15:12] and behold there appeared unto him moses
[1:15:14] and elias talking with him
[1:15:16] then answered peter and said unto unto
[1:15:18] jesus lord
[1:15:19] it is good for us to be here if thou let
[1:15:22] us make your three tabernacles one for
[1:15:24] thee and one for moses and one for elias
[1:15:26] while yes spake behold a bright cloud
[1:15:28] overshadowed them and behold a voice out
[1:15:30] of the cloud
[1:15:31] which said this is my beloved son in
[1:15:33] whom i am well pleased
[1:15:35] hear ye him and when the disciples heard
[1:15:38] this
[1:15:39] no i'm going to stop there here ye him
[1:15:41] is where i want to finish
[1:15:43] so now they they're on mount
[1:15:45] transfiguration
[1:15:46] and jesus is transfigured before them
[1:15:48] and they also see moses and they see
[1:15:49] elijah
[1:15:50] and it's amazing the spirit of
[1:15:52] revelation that is on this mountain
[1:15:54] because we'll put it this way
[1:15:58] peter james and john didn't have bible
[1:16:01] story books with pictures
[1:16:05] even if they had the drawing of moses
[1:16:07] and elijah would not be accurate to the
[1:16:09] way moses and elijah actually looked
[1:16:11] so these three men have never seen moses
[1:16:14] elijah nor a depiction of moses and
[1:16:16] elijah but when they get on mount
[1:16:17] transfiguration and they get caught up
[1:16:19] into that cloud where jesus was
[1:16:21] transfigured all of a sudden they have a
[1:16:23] spirit of revelation and i know who two
[1:16:25] these guys are
[1:16:27] they weren't introduced to them no there
[1:16:29] was no names exchanged
[1:16:31] but somehow they all come down why
[1:16:33] because they were caught up into the
[1:16:34] cloud on top of the mount
[1:16:36] where jesus was transfigured before them
[1:16:38] they saw him in his glory and when they
[1:16:40] did they knew who these two guys were
[1:16:44] there's things amen that are laying in
[1:16:45] this message there's things that are
[1:16:47] mysteries to some but secrets to another
[1:16:49] and there's something when god catch you
[1:16:51] up in the revelation all of a sudden you
[1:16:53] just know
[1:16:54] that's the way it is i know that's who
[1:16:56] that is i know that's who i am
[1:16:58] i know that's the way it is
[1:17:01] you hear somebody preaching something
[1:17:03] and all of a sudden they they take two
[1:17:04] scriptures and they just mention two
[1:17:05] scriptures they tie together and all of
[1:17:07] a sudden
[1:17:07] bang you were caught up in a cloud and
[1:17:10] saw jesus transfigured before your eyes
[1:17:11] and you knew what that scripture meant
[1:17:16] praise be to god hallelujah
[1:17:22] so now we see him caught up with moses
[1:17:25] and elijah and brother bram tells us
[1:17:26] moses
[1:17:27] represents the law and elijah represents
[1:17:30] the prophets
[1:17:31] so when you know when they when jesus
[1:17:33] says the law and the prophets were until
[1:17:35] john
[1:17:36] what jesus is saying is all of the old
[1:17:38] testament was till john but now we're
[1:17:40] moving
[1:17:42] so that term the law and the prophets
[1:17:44] just meant the whole bible
[1:17:46] as they had it to that day so when moses
[1:17:49] and elijah appear as witnesses
[1:17:51] moses moses and elijah represent the
[1:17:54] entire
[1:17:54] bible to that day the law and the
[1:17:56] prophets and
[1:17:58] and peter gets enthused in that
[1:18:00] atmosphere
[1:18:01] and he says oh let's build a tabernacle
[1:18:04] into all three
[1:18:04] and then the law the prophets and jesus
[1:18:07] and and listen to the voice
[1:18:09] he says this is my beloved son this is
[1:18:12] my son in whom i'm well pleased
[1:18:13] hear ye him he is
[1:18:17] everything they were talking about you
[1:18:20] don't need a temple to moses and a
[1:18:22] temple to elijah
[1:18:23] and a temple to jesus all you need to do
[1:18:26] is hear
[1:18:27] him he's the fullness of what they
[1:18:29] brought
[1:18:31] he was the full revelation of the full
[1:18:33] word you didn't need three temples you
[1:18:35] need three places of worship
[1:18:36] all you needed was the one who had been
[1:18:38] transfigured in his adoption
[1:18:40] brother branham calls this jesus
[1:18:41] adoption brought him up on a high
[1:18:43] mountain changed his garment before them
[1:18:45] he was transfigured they saw him
[1:18:47] glorified
[1:18:47] amen he was witness to by moses and
[1:18:49] elijah and god declared
[1:18:52] this is my adopted son in whom i'm well
[1:18:54] pleased hear him
[1:18:56] he's speaking for me
[1:19:00] praise be to god
[1:19:05] brother the man says in the message
[1:19:06] desperations from 63 god did the same
[1:19:08] thing by the son of
[1:19:09] on mount transfiguration he was
[1:19:11] overshadowed or a cloud
[1:19:13] was transfigured in his raiment shine
[1:19:14] like the sun and the voice said this is
[1:19:16] my beloved son in whom i'm
[1:19:18] well pleased moses and the law had
[1:19:21] failed and
[1:19:21] this is him here ye him he was placed
[1:19:25] he was placed as what he was placed as
[1:19:27] the fulfillment of the word
[1:19:30] you understand that moses and elijah are
[1:19:32] there to testify he's it
[1:19:35] they they want to go back to moses
[1:19:37] elijah he said forget them not not in a
[1:19:39] bad way don't
[1:19:40] don't mistake what i'm saying but don't
[1:19:43] look to him if you want to see moses
[1:19:44] elijah look here
[1:19:45] hear him this is him this is it
[1:19:49] so he was placed as the fulfillment
[1:19:52] of the law and the prophets brother says
[1:19:56] is your life worthy of the gospel he
[1:19:57] said he was worthy of the gospel so much
[1:19:59] that god said
[1:20:00] this is my beloved son in whom i'm well
[1:20:02] pleased hear ye him my word is he
[1:20:05] he is my word he and i are the same
[1:20:09] hear ye him my word listen my word is he
[1:20:14] he is my word he and i are the same
[1:20:19] now make sure we don't stop with adam in
[1:20:22] the garden by himself
[1:20:26] because the masterpiece isn't done yet
[1:20:28] the work of god's not finished being
[1:20:29] declared
[1:20:30] if all we have is the second adam in the
[1:20:32] garden by himself all power in heaven
[1:20:34] earth is given to me i'm the declaration
[1:20:36] of the full word and we stop
[1:20:37] there on mount transfiguration we have
[1:20:40] not finished the masterpiece
[1:20:41] or what god was declaring to be at the
[1:20:44] end when he showed us in the beginning
[1:20:47] that's why brother brahm could pick up
[1:20:49] this scripture a body house that'll
[1:20:50] prepare me he could bring it right back
[1:20:52] to our day and talk about the bride of
[1:20:54] jesus christ
[1:20:55] because he recognized what god declared
[1:20:57] from the beginning
[1:21:00] so he says
[1:21:04] my word is he he is my word he and i are
[1:21:07] the same
[1:21:08] mother says in the masterpiece but let
[1:21:10] us not forget that in the beginning when
[1:21:12] he smote the side of adam he took
[1:21:13] something from his side
[1:21:15] now the smiting of christ was for a
[1:21:17] cause that he might take from him
[1:21:20] one to be a family the bride he might
[1:21:22] take him a bride
[1:21:23] so when his masterpiece was perfected
[1:21:25] then he had to smite it
[1:21:27] to take from him not another piece not
[1:21:29] another creation
[1:21:31] but the same creation so he got his
[1:21:34] masterpiece done
[1:21:35] he had brother brahm tells us that he
[1:21:37] had gone to jordan to receive the
[1:21:39] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:21:42] and he had been tested and tried and
[1:21:44] proved himself a son
[1:21:46] and he'd been through every trial and
[1:21:48] every test and stood on the word and
[1:21:49] never failed the word and answered all
[1:21:51] their questions and stood all the trials
[1:21:52] of rejection and mocking
[1:21:54] and all this and he finally comes to
[1:21:56] mount transfiguration
[1:21:58] and in mount transfiguration he's
[1:21:59] declared to be the fulfillment of the
[1:22:01] word
[1:22:01] i'm adopting him i'm placing him it's
[1:22:03] all in him hear ye
[1:22:05] him and when he got to that place
[1:22:08] brother baby says now it was just a
[1:22:10] short time from there to calvary
[1:22:12] because he had an adopted son on the
[1:22:14] earth now he's got to keep working this
[1:22:17] masterpiece he can't rest he can't stop
[1:22:19] it's not over
[1:22:20] now he's got to say i got the second
[1:22:22] adam i've got him in position i got him
[1:22:25] in place
[1:22:25] he is all the word encapsulated in one
[1:22:27] body there's nothing left for me to do
[1:22:30] but
[1:22:30] strike this body and pull from his side
[1:22:33] something to make the bride
[1:22:35] [Applause]
[1:22:37] he got him adopted he took him over and
[1:22:39] smote him
[1:22:40] amen now he laid him down and now
[1:22:43] amen he's fashioning a bride
[1:22:52] praise god
[1:22:55] now i'm going to keep reading this quote
[1:22:57] i didn't even finish it
[1:23:01] now the smiling of christ was for a
[1:23:03] cause
[1:23:05] might take him a bride so when his
[1:23:07] masterpiece was perfected he had to
[1:23:09] smite it to take from him
[1:23:11] not another piece not another creation
[1:23:12] but of the same creation
[1:23:15] my brother don't think bad at this but
[1:23:16] think a minute
[1:23:18] if he took from him the original
[1:23:19] creation to make the bride for him
[1:23:22] he never made another creation he took
[1:23:23] part of the original creation
[1:23:25] then if he was the word what must the
[1:23:28] bride be
[1:23:30] it's got to be the original word living
[1:23:34] god in the word
[1:23:38] if adam was the original he had to take
[1:23:41] from the original to make
[1:23:43] the woman and if christ is the original
[1:23:46] word
[1:23:46] adopted son placed in position
[1:23:49] he had to strike him and take out of him
[1:23:51] the original he took out of him the
[1:23:53] original what was he
[1:23:55] what was she she's the word he's the
[1:23:57] word she's the word
[1:23:59] they're two parts of the same thing
[1:24:10] see brother goes back to blasphemous
[1:24:13] names now
[1:24:14] he says see a family when a son is born
[1:24:16] into it a son
[1:24:17] but the son had tutors to raise it and
[1:24:19] if that son never did come to be the
[1:24:21] right kind of son he never became heir
[1:24:23] but if he was the right son and the son
[1:24:25] that would obey his father
[1:24:26] then that son was adopted or placed
[1:24:28] positionally he became heir of what the
[1:24:31] father had
[1:24:32] and that's what god is was doing on
[1:24:34] mount transfiguration
[1:24:35] when he took his own son after he had
[1:24:37] been proven to be the right son
[1:24:39] see and that stood all the temptation he
[1:24:41] took him up on mount transfiguration and
[1:24:43] overshadowed
[1:24:44] him hear ye him he says and now moses
[1:24:47] and elijah
[1:24:48] jesus was glorified before them then his
[1:24:50] ramen shine like the sun
[1:24:52] now what was he trying to do here we
[1:24:54] find out that he went up there they
[1:24:55] found a cloud overshadowed him his
[1:24:57] clothing
[1:24:58] was changed the vesture that he was in
[1:25:00] and it shined like the sun and
[1:25:01] brightness and a cloud was over him and
[1:25:03] a voice saying this is my beloved son
[1:25:06] whom i am well pleased hear ye him
[1:25:11] he says who do you say this is from the
[1:25:13] end of 1964 and while
[1:25:15] he was yet speaking there was a voice
[1:25:17] come down said this is my beloved son
[1:25:21] hear ye him that's when they look back
[1:25:24] they seen jesus only
[1:25:25] there he stood he was the word that's
[1:25:28] all you have to hear
[1:25:29] is that word that's him
[1:25:32] in any age see what the word says for
[1:25:37] that age
[1:25:38] and watch god anoint it and go with it
[1:25:40] that's all
[1:25:42] when they they were wanting to go back
[1:25:43] to moses elijah but they didn't realize
[1:25:45] moses and elijah was only part of the
[1:25:47] masterpiece building up to the head
[1:25:49] now when jesus christ came amen he was
[1:25:52] in flesh all that they were
[1:25:57] and all that will be in the word was
[1:26:01] brought unto him
[1:26:03] he said hear ye him amen and
[1:26:08] and when they they were wanting to look
[1:26:09] back but he says no they looked they saw
[1:26:11] jesus only
[1:26:12] he said see that's all you have to see
[1:26:15] if all i have to see is jesus how do i
[1:26:17] see jesus
[1:26:18] you find the word for your age that's
[1:26:20] made manifest for your age and
[1:26:22] there he is don't look back look to him
[1:26:26] amen look for him and keep moving
[1:26:30] now i want to i want to make another
[1:26:32] jump
[1:26:35] and we're going to go back i want to go
[1:26:37] back and tie in where brother brahma
[1:26:39] said the way he works as individuals the
[1:26:40] way he works the church
[1:26:42] now remember jesus received the baptism
[1:26:45] of the holy ghost is the way brother
[1:26:46] brahm said it and explained it
[1:26:48] in the jordan and he was led by the holy
[1:26:50] ghost in the wilderness to be tempted to
[1:26:51] be tried to be tested
[1:26:53] because that was his stage of the
[1:26:54] journey
[1:26:57] but then he would come to mount
[1:26:58] transfiguration
[1:27:00] in the mount transfiguration he'd be
[1:27:01] glorified before them
[1:27:03] and he would be declared to be the word
[1:27:05] and hear ye him
[1:27:07] and a short time after that he would go
[1:27:08] to calvary
[1:27:10] so you have you have let's see this way
[1:27:13] you have
[1:27:14] the holy ghost baptism but at the end
[1:27:16] you have an adoption
[1:27:19] a placing a declaration an understanding
[1:27:23] to them of who this
[1:27:24] is he's my son he's speaking for me
[1:27:30] now i want to fast forward
[1:27:33] and go to sunset mountain because in
[1:27:36] sunset mountain is where that
[1:27:39] pyramid of cloud came down amen it was a
[1:27:42] brother man calls it a constellation of
[1:27:44] angels
[1:27:46] it's interesting he calls it a
[1:27:47] constellation because what else do we
[1:27:49] call a constellation
[1:27:50] whenever you talk to a constellation
[1:27:52] you're talking about stars
[1:27:55] so he's talking about a constellation of
[1:27:57] angels because these angels are the
[1:27:58] seven stars of the seven churches
[1:28:01] it's a constellation of angels
[1:28:07] and he he says here in the message of
[1:28:09] saying ashamed he said
[1:28:10] you see the picture the other day how he
[1:28:14] turned that picture sideways there and
[1:28:16] the very picture of those seven angels
[1:28:18] being lifted up
[1:28:19] turned it to the right hand side and
[1:28:22] there is the face of the lord jesus
[1:28:24] looking down to the earth again
[1:28:27] so we've all done this many times you
[1:28:28] see that that pyramid-shaped cloud
[1:28:31] constellation of seven angels
[1:28:32] brotherhood talks about
[1:28:34] you turn it to the right and you can see
[1:28:36] in the in the background hoffman's head
[1:28:37] of christ you can see the face of jesus
[1:28:39] christ
[1:28:40] and it was made or formed by brother
[1:28:42] branham said the wings of the angels or
[1:28:44] the seven angels actually formed the
[1:28:46] image of jesus christ in the sky
[1:28:51] and then the message uh approached our
[1:28:53] reproach for the cause of the word in 62
[1:28:55] he says
[1:28:56] right at the end he's right in december
[1:28:58] 23rd said i can just see them and their
[1:29:01] heads kind of turn sideways he's talking
[1:29:03] about the vision he saw the angels
[1:29:04] coming
[1:29:05] before he went out to arizona he's still
[1:29:08] in jeffersonville he's talking about
[1:29:09] this experience
[1:29:10] i can just see them and their heads kind
[1:29:12] of turned sideways those wings tipped
[1:29:14] back
[1:29:14] full armored and here they come so whoo
[1:29:17] like that and just go right down and
[1:29:19] just took me right into this pyramid of
[1:29:21] the constellation of them
[1:29:24] i seen i was off up off the ground
[1:29:29] so brother branham in the vision now
[1:29:31] he's describing the vision and he
[1:29:33] he sees the little birds go fly east a
[1:29:37] little pyramid form resting
[1:29:38] fly east and then the little doves come
[1:29:40] and resting in the shape of a pyramid
[1:29:42] fly east and then all sudden he hears a
[1:29:44] bang and here comes these
[1:29:46] these angels amen and they pick he said
[1:29:48] they picked me
[1:29:49] up into the constellation of themselves
[1:29:54] to take me back east and so now you find
[1:29:58] out that brother branham now he's in the
[1:30:02] vision he sees this happening in the
[1:30:03] vision now he goes out to arizona
[1:30:05] and he's out in arizona hunting and and
[1:30:07] now this
[1:30:08] whole event is going to take place where
[1:30:10] there's going to be a loud bang and
[1:30:13] there was a a constellation of angels a
[1:30:16] cloud
[1:30:17] amen and brother ben said i jumped up
[1:30:19] off the ground those angels stood right
[1:30:21] before me they told me go back east for
[1:30:22] the opening of the seven seals
[1:30:26] so here you have mount transfiguration
[1:30:30] jesus caught up on the mountain
[1:30:34] and up on the mountain he's in a cloud
[1:30:39] and in the cloud is moses and elijah
[1:30:44] moses and elijah the law and the
[1:30:47] prophets
[1:30:48] the old testament
[1:30:51] but now we're coming to the end of the
[1:30:53] seven church ages
[1:30:55] at the end of the seven church ages
[1:30:57] there's a prophet on the scene
[1:30:58] in fulfillment of the word but that
[1:31:00] prophet was more than just the prophet
[1:31:02] he was also part of the bride
[1:31:06] and as part of the bride also he goes to
[1:31:07] sunset mountain and he's caught
[1:31:09] up in a cloud just like mount
[1:31:12] transfiguration
[1:31:14] caught up in a cloud and in the cloud
[1:31:16] it's a constellation of
[1:31:17] seven angels or seven church-aged
[1:31:20] messengers
[1:31:21] representing the whole new testament
[1:31:26] it's the same thing friends
[1:31:29] same thing and now he's going to go back
[1:31:33] go back east amen for the opening of the
[1:31:36] seals and brother
[1:31:37] comes back for the opening of the seals
[1:31:38] and when he opened the seals he said
[1:31:40] it opened up the entire bible
[1:31:44] what was he given he was given a sword
[1:31:45] in the hand he was given the word of the
[1:31:47] lord
[1:31:47] and then he opened up the entire bible
[1:31:50] all of the mysteries revealed the great
[1:31:51] mystery of god
[1:31:52] revealed at that time but see it wasn't
[1:31:55] just for brother branham
[1:31:56] i mean the scripture says that that that
[1:31:58] mighty angel tore off those seals amen
[1:32:01] threw them down to the seventh church
[1:32:02] messenger who gave him to the people
[1:32:06] so it wasn't just for him what came for
[1:32:10] him
[1:32:10] came for you and i
[1:32:15] see i'd like to say it was
[1:32:19] more than just a man getting caught up
[1:32:22] into a cloud
[1:32:26] but if you'll allow me to say it this
[1:32:28] way
[1:32:30] it was the bride getting caught up into
[1:32:32] a cloud
[1:32:34] he was the wave chief the first one to
[1:32:37] come to harvest maturity
[1:32:38] the first one that could come to an
[1:32:40] adoption
[1:32:41] but he wasn't going to be the only one
[1:32:44] amen he was the first of an
[1:32:46] entire harvest that was coming to
[1:32:48] maturity
[1:32:49] amen and as the wave sheep he was the
[1:32:51] example he was the display
[1:32:53] he was portraying what god was going to
[1:32:55] do in all of the rest
[1:32:56] and so he goes up on sunset mountain
[1:32:59] amen at the closing the sun set for
[1:33:02] gentile age sunset for civilization
[1:33:05] sunset for church ages
[1:33:08] and on sunset mountain all the sudden
[1:33:10] he's
[1:33:11] caught into a cloud and in the cloud we
[1:33:13] find out later that that cloud was jesus
[1:33:16] christ
[1:33:18] and it was the seven church age
[1:33:19] messenger now it's not moses and elijah
[1:33:22] jesus fulfilled that but now it's been
[1:33:24] the entire new testament from the time
[1:33:26] of paul on
[1:33:27] now is all encapsulated in this cloud
[1:33:30] jesus christ the headship coming back to
[1:33:32] the body
[1:33:33] and brother branham representing the
[1:33:34] bride gets lifted off
[1:33:36] and what does he do he meets him in the
[1:33:38] air
[1:33:45] for what for the adoption of the bride
[1:33:52] all the way back in pentecost on the day
[1:33:56] of pentecost
[1:33:58] there was an outpouring of the holy
[1:33:59] ghost is that right
[1:34:03] just like jesus all the way back at
[1:34:05] jordan
[1:34:07] baptism of the holy ghost all the way
[1:34:09] back in the first the beginning before
[1:34:11] the first church age
[1:34:12] back in the first church there was an
[1:34:14] outpouring of pentecost the holy ghost
[1:34:16] fell but there's got to be a capping off
[1:34:19] time
[1:34:20] if jesus had a capping off time this
[1:34:23] bride has to have a capping off time
[1:34:25] and the way he did his sons the way he
[1:34:28] did jesus christ was an example to us
[1:34:30] the way he does the individual is the
[1:34:32] way he caps off the whole church age
[1:34:36] and he built the church age up through
[1:34:38] seven church ages
[1:34:40] he built jesus christ up through the law
[1:34:43] and the prophets and jesus was standing
[1:34:45] there in a cloud with the law and the
[1:34:47] prophets moses and elijah
[1:34:49] and he built the church up through seven
[1:34:51] church ages amen and there was brother
[1:34:53] branham the wave sheep representing the
[1:34:55] bride
[1:34:55] standing there with seven witnesses with
[1:34:58] seven stars
[1:34:59] with seven spirits
[1:35:05] declaring what now we've come to the
[1:35:08] adoption age
[1:35:09] at the end of the seven ages this is
[1:35:10] capstone age love age adoption age
[1:35:13] amen the maturity the bride has been
[1:35:15] maturing through seven church ages this
[1:35:17] one needed more than that and this one
[1:35:19] needed more than that
[1:35:19] this one needed more than that until
[1:35:21] finally he got a church that would break
[1:35:23] away from the nomination
[1:35:24] break away from man's ideas break away
[1:35:26] from man's thinking and where was that
[1:35:28] church represented it was represented in
[1:35:30] that one
[1:35:30] wave chief offering and they talked that
[1:35:34] wave sheave offering and took him to the
[1:35:35] top of a mountain
[1:35:36] encapsulated him in a cloud that was the
[1:35:38] presence of jesus christ with the
[1:35:40] witnesses of the seven church ages
[1:35:42] to say this is him hear ye
[1:35:45] him and when i say hear ye him i'm not
[1:35:48] talking about that
[1:35:50] man i'm talking about the same jesus
[1:35:52] christ when he said hear
[1:35:53] him on mount transfiguration mount
[1:35:55] sunset is declaring the same thing
[1:35:58] it's the holy ghost the person of god
[1:36:00] person of jesus christ himself
[1:36:02] has been bound by denominations and
[1:36:04] chained but to be loosed in the evening
[1:36:06] time by the evening time message
[1:36:08] the holy ghost back in the people again
[1:36:12] what is it it's the adoption age amen
[1:36:15] now we don't have to know where we're at
[1:36:16] i'm not in luther's age i'm not wesley
[1:36:18] age i'm not in the pentecostal age
[1:36:20] amen this is not the seventh age the
[1:36:22] world's in the seventh age but he
[1:36:24] lifted he lifted brother branham up
[1:36:27] into a cloud to show we've come to
[1:36:29] something else
[1:36:30] now
[1:36:34] about on the eighth day
[1:36:39] we've come to amen this church i'm not
[1:36:42] talking about us
[1:36:43] as individuals now don't take this in
[1:36:45] the individual way
[1:36:46] they're still being individuals being
[1:36:48] born into the body of jesus christ
[1:36:50] growing up into maturity being placed in
[1:36:51] the positions that's still
[1:36:53] currently going on friends but i'm
[1:36:55] talking over the last 2000 years
[1:36:58] there's been an adoption process going
[1:37:00] on amen and it started when he declared
[1:37:03] this is my children this is my body
[1:37:05] these are my sons amen all the way back
[1:37:07] on the day of pentecost
[1:37:09] and the holy ghost leadership has been
[1:37:11] leading the church and training the
[1:37:12] church they've been learning from taking
[1:37:14] men's ideas and
[1:37:15] falling in the dark age and suffering
[1:37:17] persecution
[1:37:19] same thing jesus christ went through
[1:37:24] coming through coming through coming
[1:37:26] through
[1:37:29] working through seven church ages
[1:37:33] until he comes to the final one
[1:37:36] after six days about on the eighth day
[1:37:44] now it's going to be the adopting of the
[1:37:47] church
[1:37:49] that's why brother brennan will come
[1:37:50] right back to preach the seals
[1:37:54] and they'll say i no longer call you
[1:37:56] church
[1:37:58] what's he doing he's placing the church
[1:38:01] this is positional placing
[1:38:04] see before the the spirit was always
[1:38:08] in in revelations uh chapter two and
[1:38:11] three the
[1:38:12] spirit is always speaking to two vines
[1:38:16] but now brother branham he's coming to
[1:38:18] an adoption time
[1:38:19] and he's not speaking to two vines
[1:38:21] anymore because one of those vines is
[1:38:23] getting the adoption and the other ones
[1:38:24] not
[1:38:28] and now he comes and he says i i'm not
[1:38:31] going to call you
[1:38:32] church any longer this is not the
[1:38:35] intertwining of of two branches this is
[1:38:38] not speaking in general term this is not
[1:38:40] the maturing and growing up
[1:38:41] faith amen now i'm not talking
[1:38:43] individual now i'm talking in a hole
[1:38:45] look at 2
[1:38:45] 000 years i'm no longer this is no
[1:38:47] longer growing up and
[1:38:48] building through justification
[1:38:50] sanctification baptist holy ghost
[1:38:51] restoration of the gifts
[1:38:53] all of that was maturing maturing
[1:38:54] maturing maturing because this bride is
[1:38:56] not just made up of you and i here at
[1:38:58] the end time but the bride is made up of
[1:39:00] the bride amen through all seven church
[1:39:02] ages
[1:39:03] he's been building up in maturity
[1:39:05] releasing his word slowly unfolding his
[1:39:07] plan
[1:39:08] letting out the mystery
[1:39:11] until finally he can come to a church
[1:39:15] that's come to maturity
[1:39:17] and say i'll adopt this church
[1:39:22] and in this adoption amen there'll be no
[1:39:24] creeds no dogmas
[1:39:26] no doctrines of man and i don't care
[1:39:28] what's happened in what's so called the
[1:39:30] message anymore
[1:39:31] that has nothing to do with me what's
[1:39:32] been happening over the last 50 years
[1:39:33] but there's been an adoption that's
[1:39:35] taken place and there's been a people
[1:39:36] who want the word and the word
[1:39:38] only that's been lifted out of
[1:39:42] denominationalism that's been lifted out
[1:39:44] of man's ideas and
[1:39:45] just want the word
[1:39:49] coming into an adoption and brother
[1:39:52] branham showed
[1:39:53] and jesus christ you know he's got he's
[1:39:56] got
[1:39:56] this three and a half year ministry he's
[1:39:59] got this
[1:40:00] baptism in jordan three and a half year
[1:40:02] ministry then he got mount
[1:40:03] transfiguration a capping off
[1:40:05] and declaration and here you him and
[1:40:07] then he says he's got just a short time
[1:40:09] to calvary
[1:40:09] in that short time the calvary is a
[1:40:11] short time not just to calvary
[1:40:14] but to resurrection
[1:40:17] to resurrection and rapture
[1:40:20] and now take that same pattern and lay
[1:40:23] it over the church ages
[1:40:26] you've got a baptism at pentecost you've
[1:40:29] got 2 000
[1:40:30] years of seven church ages amen then
[1:40:32] you've got an adoption process on mount
[1:40:34] sunset
[1:40:36] and then you've got just a short time
[1:40:39] brother jesus was just days or weeks so
[1:40:42] he went to calvary but
[1:40:43] it was based on a 33 year lifespan and a
[1:40:45] three and a half year ministry
[1:40:46] amen now we're going to take it back and
[1:40:49] overshadow that over the whole church
[1:40:50] what is a short time maybe 60 years
[1:40:54] maybe 65 years but after he comes to
[1:40:56] that adoption it's just a short time now
[1:40:58] to resurrection
[1:41:08] brother brahm says all the way back in
[1:41:11] revelation chapter 4
[1:41:13] part 2 in 1961 he says
[1:41:16] he's referring to john in revelation
[1:41:19] chapter four he says
[1:41:20] and there was a living creature what
[1:41:22] john represented the entire church
[1:41:25] was taken up he said i told you
[1:41:28] one person hearing a vision can
[1:41:31] represent an entire
[1:41:32] body of christ covered don't think
[1:41:36] brother taj is coming up with this on
[1:41:37] his own
[1:41:38] amen one person in a vision can
[1:41:40] represent the entire body of christ
[1:41:42] amen and brother branham and the vision
[1:41:43] was caught into the constellation of
[1:41:45] angels and
[1:41:46] one man in the vision can represent the
[1:41:47] entire body of christ
[1:41:53] he says in the message it is the rising
[1:41:56] of the sun
[1:41:58] as christ was the first one to race from
[1:41:59] all the prophets and so forth although
[1:42:02] typed in many places
[1:42:03] he was the first fruits of those that
[1:42:04] slept in the bride coming of christ
[1:42:07] coming out of the church they'll have to
[1:42:09] be a sheaf waved again in the last days
[1:42:11] oh my waving of the sheep what was the
[1:42:14] sheep the first one that come to mature
[1:42:17] the first one that proved it was a wheat
[1:42:18] that proved it was sheep
[1:42:20] hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm
[1:42:21] talking about it was waved over the
[1:42:23] people and the first time there will
[1:42:24] come
[1:42:25] forth for the bright age for a
[1:42:26] resurrection out of dark
[1:42:28] denominationalism
[1:42:29] will be a message that the full maturity
[1:42:32] of the word is turned back again in its
[1:42:34] full power and being waved over the
[1:42:36] people by the same signs and wonders
[1:42:38] that he did back there
[1:42:40] because i live you live also speaking to
[1:42:42] his wife because i live you live
[1:42:44] also what a resurrection that was what a
[1:42:48] resurrection this
[1:42:49] is to be quickened from the dead to be
[1:42:51] made alive in christ jesus by god's
[1:42:53] quickening power
[1:42:55] he was waved to them the word which he
[1:42:57] was was way back to them on the day of
[1:42:58] pentecost the word
[1:42:59] made manifest now when i say it's to be
[1:43:02] waved again
[1:43:03] in the last days that wave chief was
[1:43:06] waved again
[1:43:09] one man can represent the whole body of
[1:43:12] christ
[1:43:14] oh was that amazing that brother ben got
[1:43:16] caught into that constellation of
[1:43:18] angels where was he caught up into if
[1:43:20] you turn the picture to the right you
[1:43:21] can find out he was caught into the mind
[1:43:23] of god
[1:43:24] and to the mind of christ he was caught
[1:43:27] up into the mind of christ
[1:43:28] to go back to reveal the revelation of
[1:43:31] the mysteries that have tied up the
[1:43:33] entire book for all these years
[1:43:36] and in revealing those mysteries it was
[1:43:38] the in the entire bible the entire mind
[1:43:41] of christ
[1:43:43] was open in that day
[1:43:46] i'll tell you friends don't let brother
[1:43:49] brennan be the only one that was caught
[1:43:51] up in that cloud
[1:43:55] the cloud of what the seven church ages

[1:43:59] making up the headship of christ the
[1:44:01] word restored

[1:44:09] what is the headship the headship is the
[1:44:11] word
[1:44:11] all that's been lost is restored back
[1:44:14] that's what all those seven angels
[1:44:16] represent
[1:44:16] everything that was in portion portion
[1:44:19] portion
[1:44:20] portion portion now is all here
[1:44:24] don't let brother brendan be the only
[1:44:26] one caught up in the constellation
[1:44:27] don't let him to be the only one that
[1:44:29] goes into the mind of christ but i say
[1:44:31] oh god

[1:44:35] give me the revelation of jesus christ
[1:44:37] in this hour let me see the mystery that
[1:44:39] you declared from the beginning
[1:44:41] that i'm watching unfold in my life here
[1:44:43] at the end
[1:44:53] brother branham he goes from this
[1:44:56] experience
[1:44:58] early at night well late 1962 he has the
[1:45:00] vision
[1:45:01] 1963 he has the episode of sunset

[1:45:09] comes in july preaches christ is the
[1:45:10] mystery of god revealed
[1:45:13] then then we go all the way through
[1:45:18] to to 1960
[1:45:23] 3 the end of 1963 in october brother
[1:45:26] branham goes
[1:45:27] to colorado knows what happened in
[1:45:30] colorado
[1:45:34] i just want to quickly go through the
[1:45:35] events in colorado with you
[1:45:38] because i want to show that this whole
[1:45:40] idea of adoption
[1:45:42] is not just a little trivial idea
[1:45:45] but god proved it right god
[1:45:49] backed it up
[1:45:53] let's go i'm just going to read through
[1:45:57] some quotes
[1:46:00] brother branham's preaching he's telling
[1:46:01] the story he tells us several places but
[1:46:03] i'm going to pull mostly from he that is
[1:46:05] in you
[1:46:07] brother man we know was in colorado
[1:46:09] hunting with a bunch of brothers
[1:46:12] in october 1963
[1:46:15] 63 starts off with the cloud
[1:46:19] the happening at sunset mountain coming
[1:46:21] back to preach he's ending it off here
[1:46:24] and he's talking about there's a
[1:46:26] blizzard that was coming and
[1:46:28] everybody heard the broadcast blizzard
[1:46:29] coming blizzard coming and brother bam
[1:46:31] told him in the camp
[1:46:32] you want to stay you want to go they
[1:46:33] wanted to stay and try to get their deer
[1:46:34] and he says well if it just starts
[1:46:36] you just get right down to camp because
[1:46:37] i've seen that blizzard you can't
[1:46:39] survive it you'll get lost and all of
[1:46:40] these other things
[1:46:42] so all of a sudden the weather starts to
[1:46:43] turn bad and starts to break out
[1:46:45] and he said speak to those winds in that
[1:46:47] storm and it'll
[1:46:48] it'll go away now this bible lays before
[1:46:52] me
[1:46:52] which my life is in that
[1:46:55] i raised up i said i do not doubt your
[1:46:57] voice lord i say cloud snow
[1:47:00] rain sleet i resent your coming
[1:47:03] in the name of jesus christ go to your
[1:47:05] place
[1:47:06] i say that the sun must come out
[1:47:08] immediately and shine for four days
[1:47:10] till our hunting trip is over and i
[1:47:12] leave with my brethren
[1:47:15] he said immediately the wind started it
[1:47:18] was
[1:47:18] just roaring it just lightened up and a
[1:47:21] wind came from another
[1:47:22] direction and just pushed those clouds
[1:47:23] up and pushed them away
[1:47:26] and here you have a man
[1:47:30] a redeemed son
[1:47:33] a redeemed son a son that was born part
[1:47:36] of the fall
[1:47:37] a son that was born wrong but a redeemed
[1:47:39] son that had come to an adoption
[1:47:42] now he's saying you say to the storm
[1:47:44] it'll obey you
[1:47:47] this isn't jesus standing on the bow of
[1:47:49] the boat amen
[1:47:50] this is god in another form amen in a
[1:47:53] form of redeemed flesh
[1:47:57] he says you seek to storm and he spoke
[1:47:59] he just spoke out simply
[1:48:00] he said storm i resent your coming go
[1:48:02] away amen
[1:48:04] and son come out and shine for four days
[1:48:07] so that's exactly what happened he said
[1:48:09] then he says i picked up my gun
[1:48:11] wiped off the scope started to walk back
[1:48:13] down the hill and something said to me
[1:48:15] why don't you stroll with me
[1:48:17] through the wilderness walk with me i
[1:48:20] said yes lord with all my heart i would
[1:48:22] be one of
[1:48:23] the greatest things i could do was walk
[1:48:25] with you so i put my gun over my
[1:48:26] shoulder and i started walking down
[1:48:28] through that
[1:48:29] never an axe laid in it virgin timber
[1:48:32] walking through there and the message
[1:48:34] testimony says a great cathedral they
[1:48:37] were walking through a great cathedral
[1:48:39] virgin forest you know
[1:48:44] it goes on he says and so i went along
[1:48:46] like that something taken place all of a
[1:48:47] sudden
[1:48:48] in every motion principle i was a boy
[1:48:52] i thought as a boy and i had my head
[1:48:54] down and i looked up and i just as plain
[1:48:56] as i ever saw her
[1:48:58] there she stood before me with her arms
[1:49:00] out and i stopped rubbing my eyes i
[1:49:02] looked i said meeda is that you honey
[1:49:05] further down he says and that doe come
[1:49:07] walking now listen
[1:49:09] there had been hundred men shooting at
[1:49:10] them up there for four or five days
[1:49:12] scary the first sign of
[1:49:14] red and i had on a red shirt and red cap
[1:49:16] the first sign
[1:49:17] they're gone but they were standing
[1:49:19] there all three of them looking right at
[1:49:20] me
[1:49:21] i said mother take your babies and go
[1:49:23] out into the woods you're in my hands
[1:49:25] your life is in my hands but i ain't
[1:49:28] going to hurt you
[1:49:29] i promised god that i wouldn't and she
[1:49:31] walked closer
[1:49:32] she would look at me all of them walked
[1:49:34] closer till they came so close that they
[1:49:37] could eat out of my hands
[1:49:38] nearly they in the wind blowing right on
[1:49:41] them
[1:49:41] so she turned around walked back to a
[1:49:43] little piece all three of them
[1:49:45] and here she come back again walking
[1:49:47] right up to me
[1:49:48] i never moved just stood there i said go
[1:49:50] on out in the woods
[1:49:51] i love it too live see your life is in
[1:49:54] my hands but i'll spare you
[1:49:57] further on he says and i i wiped my face
[1:49:59] like that and just then something
[1:50:00] happened
[1:50:01] a voice spoke out just as clear right
[1:50:03] out of the blue skies not a cloud it all
[1:50:06] been
[1:50:06] within just a bit a little bit of time
[1:50:08] and a voice spoke out and said you
[1:50:09] remembered your promise didn't you
[1:50:12] i said yes lord he said i'll remember
[1:50:14] mine too
[1:50:15] i'll never leave you nor forsake you the
[1:50:18] burden left my heart
[1:50:20] it hasn't been there since may it never
[1:50:23] again
[1:50:25] in the message testimony he refers to
[1:50:26] the same thing he said i had been
[1:50:28] i had been feeling that horrible burden
[1:50:30] i've cried i've prayed
[1:50:32] i've confessed what can i do what is it
[1:50:34] that i've done
[1:50:35] like you had done something real evil
[1:50:37] like you had hurt somebody
[1:50:38] and you know you ought to make it right
[1:50:40] what was i condemned about
[1:50:42] i knew not i said lord if you'll only
[1:50:44] reveal it to me i'll make it right
[1:50:46] but what have i done but stand and
[1:50:48] preach and do all that i know to do
[1:50:50] and i've tried to live clean clear and
[1:50:51] just according to your words but what
[1:50:53] have i done
[1:50:54] and still that burden would not let up
[1:50:56] year after year
[1:50:57] i thought about on the mountain that
[1:50:58] morning and i started down
[1:51:01] and that's when he spoke to him said you
[1:51:02] remembered your promise
[1:51:07] he said back in the message he that is
[1:51:09] in you
[1:51:11] notice isn't that the truth isn't that
[1:51:13] the way it happened
[1:51:14] the rains just ceased and the wind
[1:51:16] ceased to blow what was it
[1:51:18] at my word no because he told me to do
[1:51:21] it
[1:51:22] and greater is he that is in us than any
[1:51:25] nature
[1:51:26] isn't the same god that would still the
[1:51:28] waves on the sea
[1:51:29] could make the winds go back to their
[1:51:31] place isn't he the same one that would
[1:51:33] darken the sun
[1:51:34] would make the sun shine well greater is
[1:51:36] he that is in you
[1:51:38] than he that is in the world
[1:51:42] brother branham after sunset mountain
[1:51:44] after going back and preaching the seals
[1:51:47] after positionally placing the bride
[1:51:49] i'll no longer call you church i'll call
[1:51:50] you bright i don't want you to be

[1:51:56] established your bride
[1:52:00] he goes to this colorado and
[1:52:03] has this experience where brother says
[1:52:06] there's a blizzard blowing
[1:52:07] a storm blowing in and he said it's it's
[1:52:09] sure death
[1:52:12] and so in the face of sure death
[1:52:16] god speaks to him and says go back to
[1:52:18] where you came from he's walking out he
[1:52:19] was trying to get to safety
[1:52:21] go back go back into death
[1:52:27] god was going to show him something we
[1:52:30] don't have to be afraid to face death
[1:52:33] we don't have to be afraid to face
[1:52:35] whatever storm comes whatever blizzard
[1:52:37] comes

[1:52:40] imminent death no way to find your way
[1:52:42] out of it
[1:52:42] if god says go you go because this is
[1:52:45] the adoption age
[1:52:48] this is the time for the manifestation
[1:52:50] of the sons of god
[1:52:52] now and into the millennium
[1:52:55] he told him to speak to the storm
[1:52:59] he gave him back control over nature
[1:53:06] he said i turned young again in every
[1:53:08] way
[1:53:09] i was a young man the way i thought he
[1:53:11] said one quote i looked at my hand
[1:53:12] looked up and there was my wife she was
[1:53:15] young too
[1:53:18] the animals had no more fear and brother
[1:53:20] brahms trying to explain
[1:53:22] how they've been shot at by a hundred
[1:53:23] men up there and all of this they should
[1:53:25] have scattered
[1:53:26] and they wouldn't leave it but he says
[1:53:27] go away and they come closer
[1:53:30] he has control of nature he's turned
[1:53:34] young again
[1:53:35] his wife is with him he's in virgin
[1:53:38] timber
[1:53:41] virgin timber and a cathedral a virgin
[1:53:44] timber
[1:53:45] never an ax laid to it and
[1:53:49] he's walking with the lord everything
[1:53:53] that adam lost was right there in that
[1:53:55] experience in canada
[1:53:57] or colorado adam had lost
[1:54:00] eternal life his youth forever amen he
[1:54:03] had lost
[1:54:04] his fellowship with god god could no
[1:54:06] longer come down in the cool of the
[1:54:07] evening and walk with him in the cool of
[1:54:08] the evening
[1:54:09] he had lost his fellowship with god he
[1:54:11] had lost eternal life he had lost
[1:54:13] harmony with nature he had lost his
[1:54:14] power to control nature
[1:54:17] and for a moment's time up on that
[1:54:20] mountain in colorado
[1:54:21] god took him to an experience that would
[1:54:23] show that this
[1:54:24] is the adoption age friends this isn't
[1:54:26] for another day
[1:54:28] this is for today this didn't happen far
[1:54:30] off this was not a preview for some
[1:54:32] far-off thing this was things that were
[1:54:34] taking place in our age to depict what
[1:54:36] age we're in so we could see
[1:54:40] we're not in the period of weight and
[1:54:43] weight and someday
[1:54:44] in weight we're in the period of now
[1:54:46] today
[1:54:47] this is the age of adoption this is the
[1:54:49] bright age this is the placing at the
[1:54:51] end of the church ages
[1:54:53] this is the bride that he wants to live
[1:54:55] in
[1:54:57] this is the bride coming of christ this
[1:54:59] is christ in the formation of the bride
[1:55:03] he wants she to be him
[1:55:08] he wants him to be so much alike that
[1:55:11] she will be in his very
[1:55:14] image we're not
[1:55:17] brother baby says we're not going to the
[1:55:18] marriage he said the marriage is here
[1:55:23] this is the time this is the age
[1:55:26] we're all individually individuals one
[1:55:29] coming in
[1:55:29] growing unto adoption getting placed but
[1:55:32] friends we are
[1:55:33] all every one of us know where we are in
[1:55:35] this age of adoption
[1:55:36] amen we're not back there in laodicea
[1:55:38] we're not back there in pentecost
[1:55:40] the pentecostal we are right up here in
[1:55:43] the adoption because he showed us
[1:55:47] all things are possible to them that
[1:55:50] believe
[1:55:51] all the words have been unveiled
[1:55:53] everything's been given to the bride
[1:55:55] amen all we're doing is just learning
[1:55:58] preeminence so god can tell us what to
[1:56:00] do and when to do it
[1:56:03] amen all the potential's been unlocked
[1:56:06] the way she's demonstrated it in ways
[1:56:09] that
[1:56:09] that are absolutely amazing in ways that
[1:56:12] we have not
[1:56:12] ever seen before and it was
[1:56:16] done that way so that we would know
[1:56:18] where we're at
[1:56:21] we've come to the adoption now what god
[1:56:24] wants to do
[1:56:26] he's going to do in and through his
[1:56:27] bride
[1:56:29] is that right yes when he brought jesus
[1:56:32] to mount transfiguration
[1:56:33] he says hear ye him they wanted to look
[1:56:35] back at moses they want to look bad
[1:56:37] elijah they wanted to build a tabernacle
[1:56:38] to them and he says no
[1:56:39] hear ye him now the bride has come to
[1:56:43] her age of adoption
[1:56:45] amen and now if he's going to do
[1:56:47] something on this earth he's going to do
[1:56:49] it
[1:56:49] in and through the bride
[1:57:00] i'm going to read a quote that's super
[1:57:01] super familiar
[1:57:09] but let's go back to genesis chapter 3.
[1:57:18] a couple weeks ago aaron mentioned this
[1:57:20] scripture you read it and it just
[1:57:22] was amazing i want to look at it
[1:57:33] genesis chapter 3 verse 8 this is after
[1:57:36] they have sinned
[1:57:38] adam and his wife have sinned
[1:57:41] genesis 3 verse 8 says and they heard
[1:57:43] the voice of the lord walking in the
[1:57:45] garden
[1:57:47] they didn't see anything in this
[1:57:50] scripture
[1:57:52] they heard the voice of god walking
[1:57:55] in the garden they didn't hear his feet
[1:58:01] you read the same thing i read they
[1:58:04] didn't hear
[1:58:05] him walking in the garden they heard his
[1:58:08] voice
[1:58:14] there's something amazing that's being
[1:58:15] established here at truth
[1:58:18] then in order for god to be present
[1:58:20] tense walking
[1:58:22] all you have to do is hear his voice
[1:58:29] and they heard the voice of the lord
[1:58:30] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[1:58:32] day
[1:58:33] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[1:58:35] from the presence of the lord
[1:58:37] god amongst the trees of the garden
[1:58:40] they hadn't seen anything yet but they
[1:58:43] knew he was present because they heard
[1:58:45] his voice
[1:58:48] they had not seen him but they were
[1:58:50] hiding from his
[1:58:51] presence because they heard his voice
[1:58:53] walking in the garden
[1:58:57] and the lord god called unto adam and
[1:58:59] said unto him where art thou
[1:59:02] and he said i heard thy voice in the
[1:59:03] garden same thing i heard thy voice in
[1:59:06] the garden
[1:59:06] and i was afraid because i was naked
[1:59:10] and i hid myself this passage of
[1:59:13] scripture
[1:59:14] never declares that they saw him
[1:59:17] but they heard him brother branham in
[1:59:20] this
[1:59:20] in this sermon in colorado i won't have
[1:59:22] time to read it all but in colorado
[1:59:25] brother branham says i looked to see
[1:59:27] something i couldn't see anything but i
[1:59:28] heard him i know his voice
[1:59:31] and he said why don't you walk
[1:59:34] with me what did adam lose
[1:59:39] that god coming in the cool the evening
[1:59:41] to walk with him he lost that fellowship
[1:59:43] brother branham he said i looked again
[1:59:46] to see because a lot of times i'll hear
[1:59:47] that voice i'll see a pillar of fire
[1:59:48] i'll see something
[1:59:49] he said i looked and i couldn't see
[1:59:51] anything
[1:59:53] i couldn't see anything
[1:59:56] but he said why don't you walk with me
[1:59:58] he said i'd love to lord
[2:00:01] and when the deer come and wouldn't go
[2:00:03] he said you dear go i'm just enjoying
[2:00:05] myself in the presence of the lord
[2:00:07] how did he know he was in the presence
[2:00:08] of the lord he couldn't see
[2:00:10] anything the only way he knew he was in
[2:00:12] the presence of the lord
[2:00:14] is because he heard his voice and he was
[2:00:17] walking with a voice
[2:00:22] he was walking with the voice of the
[2:00:24] lord and he knew it was the presence of
[2:00:27] the lord
[2:00:34] that's what brother bran would say to us
[2:00:36] it's not me
[2:00:38] i'm just a microphone i'm just a voice
[2:00:41] that he
[2:00:41] it's not the seventh angel it's the son
[2:00:44] of man
[2:00:44] it's the revealing of the sin you say
[2:00:46] it's not me he's just
[2:00:48] using my voice but when we heard that
[2:00:51] voice and it was god
[2:00:52] it was jesus christ the lamb taking the
[2:00:54] book and breaking the seals
[2:00:56] amen we were hearing the voice of the
[2:00:58] lord
[2:01:00] only it was coming through that that
[2:01:03] that man
[2:01:04] amen that man who lived on earth his
[2:01:06] vocal cords his tones his
[2:01:08] inflections amen but it was the voice of
[2:01:10] jesus christ
[2:01:11] because he didn't know those things he
[2:01:12] came and revealed them to him one by one
[2:01:16] it was god speaking to us
[2:01:20] so i want to with all of this in mind
[2:01:23] the age of adoption the adopting of the
[2:01:26] church at the end
[2:01:27] with hear ye him on mount
[2:01:29] transfiguration
[2:01:30] with all of these things i want to now
[2:01:32] read this quote
[2:01:33] out of the laodicean church age from the
[2:01:36] church age book
[2:01:39] it says a momentary consideration of
[2:01:40] church history will prove how accurate
[2:01:42] this thought is
[2:01:44] in the dark ages the word was almost
[2:01:46] entirely lost to the people
[2:01:48] but god sent luther with the word the
[2:01:50] lutheran spoke for god at that time
[2:01:53] but they organized and again pure word
[2:01:55] was lost for organization
[2:01:56] tense toward dogma and creeds and not
[2:01:58] simple word
[2:01:59] they could no longer speak for god and
[2:02:02] then god sent wesley and he was the
[2:02:03] voice
[2:02:04] with the word in his day the people who
[2:02:06] looked at us
[2:02:07] who took this revelation from god became
[2:02:09] the living epistles read and known of
[2:02:11] all men for their generation
[2:02:13] when the methodist failed god raised up
[2:02:15] others and so it has gone on through the
[2:02:16] years until the last day
[2:02:18] there was again another people in the
[2:02:19] land who under their messenger will be
[2:02:21] the final voice
[2:02:23] to the final age yes sir the church is
[2:02:27] no longer the mouthpiece of god
[2:02:29] it is its own mouthpiece so god is
[2:02:32] turning on her
[2:02:33] he will confound her through the prophet
[2:02:35] and the bride for the voice of god will
[2:02:37] be in her
[2:02:38] yes it is for it says in the last
[2:02:40] chapter revelations verse 17
[2:02:42] the spirit and the bride say come
[2:02:46] once more the world will hear direct
[2:02:48] from god as at pentecost
[2:02:50] but of course that word bride will be
[2:02:52] repudiated as in the first
[2:02:53] age oh would to god the church would
[2:02:57] code or hop
[2:02:58] best of best of all she should be
[2:03:00] fervent hot but she is not
[2:03:02] sentence has been passed she is no
[2:03:04] longer god's voice to the world
[2:03:06] she will maintain that she is but god
[2:03:08] says not
[2:03:09] oh god still has a voice for the people
[2:03:11] of the world even as he has given a
[2:03:13] voice to the bride
[2:03:15] that voice is in the bride as we have
[2:03:17] said
[2:03:18] and we will talk more about that later
[2:03:27] god doesn't live in a house made with
[2:03:30] hands
[2:03:32] but a body has thou prepared me
[2:03:35] when we come to the first fulfillment of
[2:03:37] that scripture
[2:03:38] it was a body jesus christ it was born
[2:03:40] in a manger and grown up and god dwelt
[2:03:42] in it
[2:03:44] and he says the words that i speak unto
[2:03:45] you they're not mine but what i hear of
[2:03:48] the father
[2:03:50] well it was god in flesh walking in
[2:03:53] their midst
[2:03:55] they missed it it was god in flesh
[2:03:59] speaking his words through human lips
[2:04:02] and they couldn't hear the voice of god
[2:04:08] god because sent a prophet in our day
[2:04:11] and he didn't know what those seals were
[2:04:13] he didn't make them up it come to him
[2:04:17] where did he get it he got it from the
[2:04:19] lord
[2:04:20] the lamb himself who was that that
[2:04:23] opened the seals who was it that broke
[2:04:25] the seals
[2:04:26] who was it it was the lamb
[2:04:30] but all we saw was the man in the pulpit
[2:04:36] in fact i didn't even see that all i
[2:04:40] heard was the voice
[2:04:43] but when i heard that voice what was
[2:04:46] thundering in our heart was
[2:04:47] more than the words of a human being
[2:04:51] to me it was the voice of god calling to
[2:04:53] me
[2:04:54] adam adam where are you
[2:04:59] i'm here lord
[2:05:02] there's been a redemption there's been a
[2:05:03] price paid we don't have to stay hidden
[2:05:05] anymore from the voice
[2:05:06] that comes walking in the garden
[2:05:10] but now when we hear the voice of god
[2:05:12] come walking in the garden
[2:05:13] what's been restored the word has been
[2:05:16] restored
[2:05:17] the word of god has been restored and
[2:05:19] now where is that word of god that word
[2:05:21] is
[2:05:21] in the bride restored through a
[2:05:24] prophetic ministry given
[2:05:26] back to us amen in forms of print and
[2:05:28] forms of tape
[2:05:29] but that word now is living taking on
[2:05:31] flesh and the bride
[2:05:32] god he always wanted a tabernacle to
[2:05:35] dwell in and now there's a tabernacle of
[2:05:37] a bride
[2:05:38] on this earth and the headship has have
[2:05:40] to has to have a body
[2:05:42] to unite with and we are in uniting
[2:05:44] signs and times
[2:05:46] christ is here in his bride it's the
[2:05:49] bride form
[2:05:51] christ in bright form and now the world
[2:05:55] there's another voice to the world
[2:05:57] but what is it it's the voice of god
[2:05:59] walking in his garden
[2:06:02] in the cool of the evening he told
[2:06:05] brother brandon won't you walk with me
[2:06:08] and in that experience all that was lost
[2:06:10] in eden he now no longer had a guilty
[2:06:12] feeling he didn't know where it come
[2:06:12] from he didn't know why he carried that
[2:06:14] burden
[2:06:14] he didn't know how to get rid of it but
[2:06:16] all of a sudden that guilty feeling that
[2:06:17] was
[2:06:18] that mysterious guilty feeling was gone
[2:06:20] no more condemnation
[2:06:22] no more dread no more guilt
[2:06:27] youthful wife restored to him virgin
[2:06:31] timber
[2:06:31] walking with god how did he know he
[2:06:33] wasn't gone not what his eyes could see
[2:06:35] but what he heard the voice of god
[2:06:39] and god come down amen to unite with his
[2:06:42] bride
[2:06:42] amen and his bride is his garden
[2:06:46] read song of solomon his bride is his
[2:06:49] garden
[2:06:50] that great city the new jerusalem is a
[2:06:52] garden water comes out of the throne and
[2:06:54] goes over every trellis and in every
[2:06:55] yard and every tree
[2:06:57] it's a giant garden
[2:07:00] you are his garden you're his planting
[2:07:03] you're his husbandmanship
[2:07:05] you're the project that he's been
[2:07:06] working on since the beginning
[2:07:10] and now i'd like to present to you the
[2:07:12] voice of god
[2:07:15] is walking in his garden
[2:07:18] why because the word's been restored
[2:07:23] not shrouded in church age not shrouded
[2:07:25] in dogma not shrouding the
[2:07:27] denominationalism
[2:07:29] but the holy ghost himself is here
[2:07:34] my brother said he has no voice but
[2:07:36] yours and mine
[2:07:37] he has no lips he has no hands he has no
[2:07:40] feet but yours in mind
[2:07:41] we're living out the word friends
[2:07:45] this is the adoption age what he always
[2:07:48] intended for a church to be
[2:07:50] this is the church that'll be that
[2:07:52] there'll not be another one it's this
[2:07:53] age we've come to adoption there'll not
[2:07:55] be another messenger there'll not be
[2:07:57] another
[2:07:57] great display of a messenger it's
[2:07:59] already done we've come to the age of
[2:08:00] adoption it's been
[2:08:01] shown what he's going to do what he's
[2:08:04] done
[2:08:06] and now it's for us just to have
[2:08:08] confidence in that and say god
[2:08:10] whatever you want to do do it right in
[2:08:12] this vessel
[2:08:14] i'm yours i'm not waiting anymore i'm
[2:08:16] saying i surrender all to you right now
[2:08:19] i'm yours you want to have a voice use
[2:08:22] these vocal cords
[2:08:23] i have nothing to say i have nothing to
[2:08:25] offer but if i just say what the word
[2:08:28] says
[2:08:30] then it's not my words if i just say
[2:08:33] what the prophet said then it's not my
[2:08:35] words
[2:08:35] amen it's his
[2:08:40] we've come to the age of adoption
[2:08:42] singularly
[2:08:43] there's still individuals coming in but
[2:08:45] this church has been capped off
[2:08:48] by the headship of jesus christ divine
[2:08:50] love
[2:08:52] and now we're not waiting we're not
[2:08:54] looking
[2:08:55] we're just surrendering as we walk
[2:08:58] brother branham
[2:08:59] you realize as a human being when
[2:09:01] brother branham was manifesting things
[2:09:03] that were absolutely extraordinary
[2:09:05] he was doing it in such an ordinary way
[2:09:08] when he was praying for his wife's tumor
[2:09:10] amen this is the last time there was a
[2:09:12] manifestation of the
[2:09:14] third pool that he begins to talk about
[2:09:15] his wife's tumor and he speaks the tumor
[2:09:18] out of existence but if you listen to
[2:09:20] that story brother brethren says
[2:09:22] we had prayed and prayed my wife and i
[2:09:25] and family and that tumor seeming like
[2:09:27] seemingly like wouldn't go anywhere so
[2:09:30] you realize
[2:09:31] brother branham wasn't he didn't come to
[2:09:33] this place of adoptionist place of
[2:09:34] maturity and he'd go around and nothing
[2:09:36] will stop me and i won't have any of
[2:09:38] this
[2:09:38] you got no tumor
[2:09:41] he come to a place of maturity where he
[2:09:43] knew how to handle himself in the word
[2:09:45] even in trials and difficulties and
[2:09:47] unanswered prayers
[2:09:50] this adoption isn't i'll speak the word
[2:09:53] nothing will ever happen nothing will
[2:09:54] stand
[2:09:55] are you kidding me jesus didn't live
[2:09:59] like that
[2:10:00] when they mocked him he just turned and
[2:10:02] went away
[2:10:04] when they were going to throw stoned he
[2:10:06] slipped through the crowd quietly
[2:10:09] he didn't call down fire from heaven and
[2:10:13] he he knew he was learning he knew how
[2:10:16] to act in maturity with the word
[2:10:18] brother branham comes he's had this
[2:10:20] experience in colorado he's had the
[2:10:22] sunset
[2:10:22] mountain experience he's had the opening
[2:10:24] of the seals he
[2:10:26] he spoke squirrels into existence and
[2:10:27] his wife has a tumor and they've prayed
[2:10:29] and prayed and it won't move
[2:10:33] pray don't get the wrong idea of
[2:10:35] adoption friends
[2:10:37] it's maturity it's place where god can
[2:10:39] put confidence in you
[2:10:40] you're going to stick with the word no
[2:10:42] matter what comes
[2:10:45] they prayed and nothing moved and it
[2:10:47] kept getting bigger
[2:10:48] and brother ben is worried and he's
[2:10:50] saying well they're going to have to
[2:10:51] have a surgery i don't want her to
[2:10:52] suffer but if they have the surgery now
[2:10:54] we can't make it back here for christmas
[2:10:57] they understand he he didn't come to
[2:11:00] this
[2:11:00] super revelated position where he always
[2:11:03] knew what was going to happen in every
[2:11:05] circumstance and
[2:11:06] had to answer for everything and could
[2:11:08] just speak whatever he wanted
[2:11:10] he was walking in humility and
[2:11:12] submission and god had a vessel so
[2:11:14] surrendered when god said speak he'll
[2:11:16] speak
[2:11:17] and if god didn't tell him to speak he
[2:11:19] wasn't going to speak
[2:11:22] come to this position and we didn't know
[2:11:24] what to do and
[2:11:25] he goes i was in the home and i was
[2:11:27] awful lonesome been there a couple of
[2:11:28] days and no one was there
[2:11:30] he he had just been returned back to an
[2:11:33] eden condition in colorado and now he
[2:11:36] doesn't know what to do about his wife's
[2:11:37] tumor and he's so lonesome and worried
[2:11:39] about his wife
[2:11:43] he kneels down to pray like he's prayed
[2:11:46] before
[2:11:48] you realize this wasn't a three-day fast
[2:11:51] this wasn't
[2:11:52] a super-duper something meeting council
[2:11:54] it was just he knelt down to pray like
[2:11:56] he had prayed for his wife before
[2:12:00] but this time god said stand on your
[2:12:04] feet
[2:12:06] he stood up on his feet he says whatever
[2:12:08] you say
[2:12:09] is what it'll be he said before the
[2:12:12] doctors touch her
[2:12:14] what did he have he had the power of the
[2:12:16] spoken word
[2:12:18] but he didn't have it in arrogancy and
[2:12:20] pride and self-assertion and his
[2:12:22] self-will
[2:12:23] he had it under absolute god had
[2:12:26] absolute preeminence over this vessel
[2:12:30] when god told him to speak speak when
[2:12:32] god told him to speak
[2:12:34] it was the same as god speaking
[2:12:40] we've come to the age of adoption but
[2:12:41] don't make it anything different than
[2:12:43] what brother bradham showed us
[2:12:46] the character the humility the reverence
[2:12:50] the respect the worship
[2:12:52] not having answers not knowing
[2:12:56] i think sometimes we think of where the
[2:12:57] bride we've come to adoption we come all
[2:12:59] the way we should have the answer for
[2:13:00] everything
[2:13:00] brother braham didn't have the answer
[2:13:02] for everything and we we try
[2:13:04] to figure out everything god's doing he
[2:13:06] didn't answer it but he didn't answer
[2:13:07] this prayer because of this reason and
[2:13:08] because when this moves then this will
[2:13:09] happen
[2:13:13] that's just spiritual pressure trying to
[2:13:15] explain everything
[2:13:17] instead of just walking as a mature son
[2:13:19] that says if he didn't tell me
[2:13:21] i don't know
[2:13:24] why didn't he answer your prayer i don't
[2:13:26] know
[2:13:28] but i trust him anyways
[2:13:32] we prayed for that wait a minute i don't
[2:13:34] know
[2:13:36] but i'm not backing down on the word by
[2:13:38] his stripes i'm
[2:13:42] healed
[2:13:44] we've come to adoption it's been proven
[2:13:47] it's been shown
[2:13:48] it's without question
[2:13:52] but that's just where now he can have
[2:13:53] confidence in this bride to carry this
[2:13:56] word
[2:13:57] and she has the word and the mind of
[2:13:59] christ will know what to do with the
[2:14:00] word
[2:14:02] she's not going to go with her own mind
[2:14:04] with her own way
[2:14:05] trying to prove something trying to make
[2:14:07] something happen
[2:14:08] trying to work something up she's just
[2:14:10] going to walk with absolute
[2:14:12] confidence that god is here he needed a
[2:14:14] vessel
[2:14:15] i'm the vessel it does i don't have to
[2:14:17] prove that to anybody
[2:14:20] you want proofread the adoption age
[2:14:22] point to sunset mountain
[2:14:25] point to colorado you don't have to
[2:14:28] prove anything
[2:14:28] god's already proved it we don't have to
[2:14:32] prove who we are we don't want to prove
[2:14:33] anything
[2:14:33] god called us god brought us into his
[2:14:35] kingdom god has showed us where we're at
[2:14:37] in time
[2:14:38] it's already done all we have to do is
[2:14:41] just surrender to it
[2:14:42] have confidence in god and not keep
[2:14:44] backing down on our confession
[2:14:48] and when god's ready he'll say stand on
[2:14:51] your feet
[2:14:55] whatever you say oh friends when god
[2:14:58] nudges you like that
[2:15:00] whatever you say it's the same as deity
[2:15:02] speaking

[2:15:08] been shown
