[0:00] just because your daddy your mama does
[0:03] not make you immune from repenting to
[0:06] your children
[0:08] come on Friends
[0:10] but what happens is we think well those
[0:12] are my children and I
[0:15] no no no no no no no no no no no
[0:18] no no no no no no they're God's children
[0:24] and and you know you know you know why
[0:26] listen I'll tell you this the moment you
[0:28] do what it'll do it's not just teaching
[0:31] your children repentance but it's also
[0:33] you learning humility
[0:35] because it's really humbling to go to a
[0:37] six seven eight year old and go
[0:41] sorry
[0:47] but it's also liberating
[0:50] because really you say yeah but we're
[0:52] supposed to make you're going to make
[0:53] mistakes
[0:56] that's the whole point
[0:58] listen friends that's why we need the
[0:59] grace of God
[1:00] that but but the thing of it is is we
[1:02] got to get out of our listen you're
[1:04] living in a fallen world and in a fallen
[1:06] condition and I don't care how much your
[1:09] name is on the Lamb's Book of Life you
[1:10] still make mistakes you still get carnal
[1:13] you still get in the flesh
[1:16] yes and and so it takes us it takes
[1:20] humility
[1:22] it takes humility to be able to Humble
[1:25] ourselves and say I made a mistake I'm
[1:27] sorry I shouldn't have said it like that
[1:30] I got under pressure you know we make
[1:33] mistakes and listen you know to think of
[1:35] it is then really what that does is that
[1:37] becomes a teachable moment
[1:39] because then you then your children
[1:40] realize okay wow that makes mistakes
[1:42] okay I see the Christian thing I see
[1:45] them live in this life he makes mistakes
[1:47] he repents he he does love God man he
[1:50] don't just act that way at church and
[1:52] Manny
[1:53] they may never say it because remember
[1:56] brother Branham says you'll live your
[1:58] best and your worst in front of your
[1:59] children
[2:03] and a lot of times we leave it up to the
[2:06] youth camp or special services or
[2:09] Brother Kyle or whoever you know uh to
[2:13] to to to to to bring them to an
[2:15] experience but actually brother Branham
[2:18] tells us that we're the best person to
[2:20] do it
[2:22] he actually says because they have your
[2:25] nature
[2:27] that's right but what's he telling us
[2:30] he's telling us
[2:32] they are you but then you have to be
[2:36] able to say hey I did that too
[2:38] yeah man I struggle with that same thing
[2:40] and oh man I had that problem too and
[2:43] you know what's your granddad he used to
[2:45] do that to me and and he shouldn't have
[2:47] done that to me and here I am oh man I
[2:49] thought I was yeah I'm just as bad as
[2:52] him and
[2:56] see but what are you doing you're
[2:58] actually making Christianity real
[3:02] yeah you're making it real friends
[3:04] because and I'm not talking about I got
[3:06] to apologize my children beat my
[3:08] children I went out on drunk I'm not
[3:09] talking about that you understand what
[3:11] I'm saying but I'm talking about the
[3:12] littlest thing
[3:14] I shouldn't have been frustrated when I
[3:15] said now I got I got upset and I said
[3:17] that in the wrong tone and I'm sorry see
