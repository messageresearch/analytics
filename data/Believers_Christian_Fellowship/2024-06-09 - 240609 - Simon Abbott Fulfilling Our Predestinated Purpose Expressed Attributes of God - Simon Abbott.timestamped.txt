[14:10] home I'm not as um refined as uh Blake
[14:15] God bless you thank you thank you hey
[14:17] God bless you Blake kind of coughs and
[14:19] blows his nose and quickly flicks the
[14:21] mic on without knowing anyone
[14:25] noticing I ain't that clever Lord's good
[14:29] and I'm thankful the Lord the Lord uses
[14:30] each and every one each and every gift
[14:32] and brother brother Blake you know I
[14:33] appreciate the song leaders I always
[14:35] appreciate the song I used to play the
[14:37] piano myself so you were always the
[14:39] first one out playing before church and
[14:42] you know when folks going into church
[14:44] and everyone's stressed out and busy
[14:46] with the things of the world that we're
[14:48] trying to leave behind but you're still
[14:49] thinking thoughts and the musicians are
[14:52] the first ones that have got to go into
[14:53] battle and it's a responsibility and
[14:56] it's something that um not everyone's
[14:58] aware there of until you've been in that
[15:00] position so we appreciate them but
[15:02] brother Blake there he was uh he was I
[15:05] think he was listening like yesterday
[15:07] brother brother uh John we went
[15:11] to Hans
[15:13] yesterday it's probably not the best
[15:16] idea when you've got to stand here the
[15:18] next day but on the on the way home I
[15:20] just had that song in my heart you know
[15:22] that deep yet I pray and higher every
[15:24] day and brother Blake sung that today
[15:26] and the songs are in line with all the
[15:28] Lord
[15:29] given us so we are thankful for that so
[15:31] we give greetings from back home the
[15:33] small group that we are and I just pray
[15:36] that the Lord blesses them watches over
[15:37] them this is the furthest we've ever
[15:39] come without the kids and
[15:41] uh don't really like it to be honest
[15:44] with you they're not they're not
[15:45] children anymore but they still are if
[15:47] you know what I mean and uh I know we're
[15:50] all children of the Lord but all is well
[15:53] so anyway all is well anyway and I'm
[15:55] sure brother Chad's doing just fine cuz
[15:59] he said I shouldn't say this but he sent
[16:00] me a picture of his little Crumpet this
[16:02] morning I bought him some little
[16:04] unhealthy snack from England you know so
[16:07] all is well the Lord's good so um if we
[16:11] can please just Begin by turn to
[16:13] Ephesians 1 if we can 3-1 Ephesians 1
[16:17] we're going to read
[16:22] 3-1 Ephesians 1 verse
[16:26] 3-11 The Lord's Good Sister this is zill
[16:29] here isn't it from Germany Z here it's
[16:33] nice that um someone for our well it's
[16:36] not really nice we're all from the same
[16:38] country you know the English shouldn't
[16:41] really say this but the English kind of
[16:42] don't like the old Germans but I've just
[16:44] got a love in my heart for them I love
[16:46] them to bit when I say the English you
[16:48] know the worldly English and I'm sure
[16:49] the Germans feel the same kind of
[16:51] way but we just love each other and I
[16:54] just I just love I love my I love going
[16:57] brother Andreas up there in Germany we
[16:59] just love each I just love him and I
[17:00] love the Saints there so it's nice that
[17:02] we're uh on foreign soil
[17:06] together but we're supposed to be uh
[17:09] like going into Canaan we're supposed to
[17:10] be like you know possessing the land as
[17:12] we go so all is
[17:15] well right try to calm down and I'm just
[17:17] talking nonsense by the way the more you
[17:20] get to know me there's more of that
[17:22] unfortunately all is well let's read
[17:24] verse 3 to 11 if we can amen blessed be
[17:27] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[17:28] Christ Christ who has blessed us with
[17:30] all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[17:32] places in Christ according as he hath
[17:34] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[17:37] of the world that we should be holy and
[17:39] Without Blame before him in love having
[17:41] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[17:44] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[17:47] according to the good pleasure of his
[17:48] will to the praise and GL uh to the
[17:51] praise of the glory of his grace wherein
[17:53] he hath made us accepted in the Beloved
[17:56] in whom we have Redemption through his
[17:59] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[18:01] to the riches of his grace wherein he
[18:03] hath abounded towards us in all wisdom
[18:05] and Prudence having made known unto us
[18:08] the mystery of his will according to the
[18:10] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[18:12] himself that in the dispensation of the
[18:15] fullness of times he might gather
[18:17] together in one all things in Christ
[18:19] both which are in heaven and which are
[18:21] on earth even in him in whom also we
[18:24] have obtained an inheritance being
[18:27] predestinated according to the purpose
[18:30] of him who worketh all things after the
[18:32] counsel of his own will amen let's just
[18:35] pray over the reading of the word Lord
[18:36] Jesus help us Lord we pray Lord Jesus
[18:39] let it just speak your word Lord nothing
[18:41] else but your word help us Lord we pray
[18:44] we just love you Lord show us something
[18:45] Lord of yourself show us ourselves Lord
[18:48] just clean the mirror a little bit this
[18:49] morning so we can see ourselves clearer
[18:51] lord it's our desire speak to us we pray
[18:54] we love you Lord and we bless your name
[18:55] amen amen so you may be seated
[18:59] so our thought this morning is uh
[19:01] fulfilling our predestinated
[19:04] purpose and um as a subtitle expressed
[19:08] attributes of God so fulfilling our
[19:11] predestinated purpose and we are and we
[19:14] are obviously we are expressed
[19:16] attributes of
[19:18] God so I'd like to look at
[19:20] predestination this morning and the
[19:23] revealing of our predestinated purpose
[19:26] because we do have a predestinated
[19:28] purpose now predestination is one of
[19:31] the it it's probably one of the most uh
[19:35] controversial
[19:36] subjects if you would speak to uh
[19:39] nominal Christians because
[19:41] predestination means you are or you
[19:43] aren't and people kind of don't like
[19:45] that now we're here today cuz we are so
[19:48] we can talk about it without it being
[19:49] cont you know what I mean but if you if
[19:51] you talk to your neighbor about
[19:52] predestination they kind
[19:54] of yeah they don't like it the
[19:56] predestination goes deep deeper than
[19:59] what we think and we know that it's
[20:01] something that we're all looking at all
[20:02] the time and it kind of it shows us
[20:04] where we're from it shows us our
[20:06] identity and predestination you know if
[20:09] we have eternal life then we are of God
[20:12] there is only one eternal life and so in
[20:14] order to
[20:15] see clearer we have to go back to when
[20:19] we first were
[20:22] predestinated and uh that was as we read
[20:25] in the scriptures before the foundation
[20:27] of the world I'd like to read a quote
[20:28] here his brother bam means great greater
[20:32] than Solomon he's
[20:34] here brother says it's in 62 in the
[20:37] beginning before there was anything it
[20:38] was God before a meteor before there was
[20:41] light before there was an atom before
[20:42] there was a molecule he was God but he
[20:45] couldn't he was the great controlling
[20:47] power of everything and he was
[20:50] everything in him now now in him was
[20:54] attributes you know what attribute mean
[20:56] raise up your hand anyone who knows
[20:57] attribute sure you you know what
[20:58] attribute is something that's in you
[21:00] it's got to display itself like an
[21:04] attribute like you love scenery and when
[21:05] you see the scenery something oh it just
[21:08] my it Thrills your soul now in God he
[21:11] wasn't God yet because God is an object
[21:14] of worship there was nothing for to
[21:16] worship him he was God but he wasn't God
[21:18] in that manner now he must he must have
[21:21] created angels then they begin to
[21:23] worship him next he had an attribute to
[21:26] be a father next he had Anri rute to be
[21:29] a son next thing he had an attribute to
[21:30] be a Healer next thing an attribute to
[21:32] be a savior see and all these things had
[21:34] to display themselves see and God to
[21:38] make man sin so he could punish him no
[21:41] and he put him on the basis of free
[21:43] moral agency and a man sinned himself so
[21:46] therefore God became a savior see it's
[21:49] only the attributes of God displaying
[21:51] themselves that we see okay so these are
[21:55] all obviously things that we know it's
[21:57] not it's nothing new but you know we see
[21:59] that before the foundation of the world
[22:00] that when God dwelt Alone with God he
[22:03] wasn't God now that's quite a statement
[22:04] to make but it's pretty clear when he
[22:06] explains it if if there's nothing to
[22:08] worship you then you can't be God
[22:10] although as he very rightly says in the
[22:12] beginning he was God although not yet
[22:14] manifested in that particular attribute
[22:17] of himself okay
[22:20] so when the angel were then created as
[22:22] brother says now suddenly he can be
[22:24] worshiped and the attribute of God now
[22:27] suddenly was
[22:29] manifested okay so this is quite
[22:30] important for us to understand and I'm
[22:32] going to say this a few times today
[22:34] because at that point God was God but
[22:37] the attribute of him right in the
[22:39] beginning when you read John 1 in the
[22:40] beginning was the word okay so that's
[22:42] the very beginning of time there is no
[22:44] time the very beginning of the beginning
[22:46] um yeah it's hard to get your head
[22:49] around but anyway um he he was God but
[22:52] that attribute of God hadn't manifested
[22:54] yet now when the Angels were created now
[22:57] suddenly he was worshiped and suddenly
[22:59] he could fulfill the attribute of being
[23:02] God okay so when the Lord dwelt alone
[23:08] with his thoughts and look at the end of
[23:10] the
[23:11] day brother R we use these Expressions
[23:14] when God dwelt Alone with his his
[23:16] thoughts if I dwell alone with my
[23:18] thoughts they jumbled up see when the
[23:20] Lord's dwelling alone it's an expression
[23:22] that we kind of use to get our peab
[23:26] brain like tiny little PE brain mind
[23:28] around kind of the concept of what we're
[23:30] talking about so we say God dwelt Alone
[23:33] with his thoughts and when he dwelt
[23:34] alone with his thoughts then to use that
[23:36] expression all of his attributes were in
[23:39] him so when we read John 1 in the
[23:40] beginning you can just like in the
[23:42] beginning just pause there everything
[23:44] that God was ever will be ever is now
[23:48] was in there right so everything
[23:51] absolutely everything we with no brother
[23:54] brother um Franco pardon me the um there
[23:57] was no uh with no exception it was all
[24:00] in there so I'm going to try to draw it
[24:01] here got sister last time sister Oh
[24:04] Sister Joyce bless her heart she'll be
[24:06] she'll be at home streaming but last
[24:08] time I think I drew sister
[24:10] Joyce yeah is she oh she's there that's
[24:14] sweet so sister Joyce I think I drew her
[24:16] in there so I'm just going to start here
[24:18] by
[24:19] uh my little I love drawing timelines
[24:21] and stuff so so this is now this is now
[24:24] way way back back back in uh
[24:29] I can't write
[24:30] time the beginning
[24:32] be beginning I can't spell very well
[24:36] that's one of my I'm so
[24:38] sorry I've usually I shouldn't say this
[24:40] I've usually got sister marrying and I
[24:42] write I'm a board and I look back cuz
[24:44] she's quite clever you know I kind of
[24:46] look back and I'm she looks at me she's
[24:48] like I'm like
[24:52] and so I guess she'll be streaming in
[24:55] now and brother Michael will be
[24:56] chuckling I'm sure but back in the
[24:57] beginning I think we can move this one
[24:59] can't we here that's it so back in the
[25:01] beginning and I think last time I was
[25:03] here I think I actually Drew this
[25:04] infolding this which I I love this kind
[25:06] of in I'm going to make it bigger this
[25:08] time and last time there was three I
[25:10] think but I'm going to draw it bigger
[25:12] like that because when God be and when
[25:15] God was back with his thoughts and all
[25:18] his attributes look he we can't get our
[25:21] head around it but he everything was he
[25:25] you can't even say he saw everything but
[25:28] in him everything was am so even me
[25:32] standing here today with this God bless
[25:35] you with this pen you know with this pen
[25:39] and we got sister Lan with the blue
[25:41] jumper on that was in him it was it was
[25:46] present tense back there although not
[25:49] yet
[25:50] manifested okay so now in here we we've
[25:54] got um um in here we've got brother says
[25:57] I'm I'm going to put the cloud which is
[25:58] going to be like this uh this one's the
[26:00] cloud and this one's the pillar of fire
[26:03] and then we've got here healer healer
[26:06] savior Savior and name me something else
[26:09] brother Brian another attribute of God
[26:13] huh deliver deliverer that's a good one
[26:16] yeah deliverer
[26:19] deliverer you could have given me some
[26:21] easy to
[26:23] spell so everything's in there
[26:26] everything is in there so now even and
[26:28] attribute of being a
[26:30] son okay so this is the important one
[26:32] now and I always put a little Pillar of
[26:35] Fire above that's the Sun so now
[26:38] remember so all these attributes
[26:40] absolutely everything was there and so
[26:43] if we now kind of zoom in on this on
[26:47] this
[26:49] picture although not yet manifested okay
[26:54] was God in Bride form amen now we always
[26:59] and we always look at the attributes of
[27:03] God as being the Savior being the son as
[27:06] being the Healer and all these things
[27:07] which is absolutely right we always kind
[27:09] of we never kind of mentioned that
[27:11] actually bride form was in there
[27:14] too and so I'm going to put a uh a
[27:17] circle around with a little arrow in
[27:20] infolding okay because now they are
[27:24] one the bride was not yet manifested yet
[27:27] okay
[27:28] so because she's still an attribute of
[27:32] God I've put that circle around which
[27:35] shows now that she is actually although
[27:38] she's a part of him she's in him amen so
[27:41] the arrow is showing that she's in him
[27:43] okay so she's in him she's not yet
[27:47] separated
[27:48] amen and uh we can see this is the
[27:51] attribute part so in now back in the
[27:53] beginning this is everything that God
[27:55] was okay and in him is this attribute so
[27:59] now if we read now let's just go back
[28:01] and read Ephesians verse three
[28:03] again what Ephesians verse three we've
[28:06] just read this it says now you will
[28:08] notice as we read this everything is
[28:11] written I want you to notice in past
[28:13] tense which is the whole predestinated
[28:17] thing so read it it says here blessed be
[28:20] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[28:22] Christ who ha past tense blessed blessed
[28:27] past tense blessed us with all spiritual
[28:29] blessings in present tense Heavenly
[28:32] places in Christ Jesus and as we read
[28:35] through um what we've read this morning
[28:37] you will see that things are in in past
[28:40] tense it's done so if we notice that
[28:43] everything that we
[28:45] are is in Christ Jesus so notice here it
[28:48] says in verse three has blessed us with
[28:49] all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[28:51] places notice in Christ Jesus so it's
[28:56] hard to get your head around right
[28:59] but let's just say I'm going to use John
[29:01] Brooks did I say that look James was an
[29:06] attribute of you right although not yet
[29:11] manifested when you were like 15
[29:14] 16 right in you although not yet
[29:18] manifested right and you couldn't see
[29:22] him but he was there now when we would
[29:25] go back further than we would see the
[29:28] manifestation of James but actually and
[29:30] we don't know what lays inside James
[29:32] until it manifests himself see if the
[29:34] Lord comes tomorrow then James is that's
[29:36] it that's it but if the Lord carries 10
[29:39] years you know now suddenly we'll see
[29:42] what was inside James as it were so
[29:46] although it's in there until it becomes
[29:48] manifested so the point I'm trying to
[29:49] say is that although you can't see it it
[29:52] don't mean it's not
[29:54] there
[29:55] right when was the lamb slay
[29:59] before the foundation but actually 2,000
[30:03] years ago but actually before the
[30:06] foundation of the world see if you would
[30:09] go back here where there is no time even
[30:11] though not yet manifested it is see what
[30:14] I mean okay
[30:17] so so she's in him but she's not yet
[30:21] separated so basically now and you know
[30:24] we want to
[30:25] see you know we want to see how position
[30:28] we want to see who we are we want to
[30:30] see we want to we want to have comfort
[30:33] to know that he's in control of our
[30:35] situation we want to we want to take
[30:36] comfort it says wherefore in the
[30:38] scripture says wherefore Comfort one
[30:39] another with these words talking of the
[30:41] Rapture talking about the Saints and
[30:42] those that are dead and but we comfort
[30:44] each other with these words we're
[30:45] comforting each other so now the same
[30:47] way now that the bride was in the
[30:51] Lord was like it was that Eve was in
[30:55] Adam before the Lord separated them see
[31:00] now now you could say well actually uh
[31:03] Eve wasn't actually because physically
[31:07] actually the Lord created her um from a
[31:11] rib and so on and so forth but actually
[31:13] when we read the scriptures we'll see
[31:14] another story because before Eve was
[31:16] taken out of Adam she was actually in
[31:19] him okay she was an attribute of Adam
[31:24] okay and now remember this quote that we
[31:26] just read here brother says attributes
[31:30] have to he said he said now attributes
[31:32] you know attributes it um he says here
[31:36] um all and all these things talk about
[31:38] he had an attribute to be son next thing
[31:40] attribute to be healer next thing
[31:41] attribute to your savior and all these
[31:43] things had to display themselves they
[31:46] have to an attribute is something that
[31:48] actually has to manifest itself now
[31:51] sometimes sometimes like like let's just
[31:54] say um brother
[31:55] John oh yeah brother John when he was
[32:00] younger he he never had the attribute of
[32:03] being a nice like soft and caring it's
[32:06] an example bro like you know he until
[32:10] when he had his child suddenly the
[32:13] manifestation of the attribute of him
[32:16] being this caring loving father comes
[32:19] out see what I mean
[32:22] so evees in Adam although you can't see
[32:26] it sometimes it takes time time for that
[32:29] manifestation to come out and now who
[32:31] knows when you read the scriptures who
[32:32] knows how long it was it wasn't like the
[32:34] next day that Eve came out no it wasn't
[32:38] it wasn't like the next day it could
[32:39] have been I don't know we we're not in
[32:41] time back then in theory time when we
[32:42] came after the fall it's one of those
[32:44] subjects that you can go around what was
[32:45] first chicken or the egg you know you go
[32:47] round and round but um like if if you
[32:50] would look then we don't know how long
[32:51] it was but these things take time and
[32:54] and for the Lord to say well you know oh
[32:57] I don't want to get ahead of myself
[32:58] let's wait let's wait okay so brother
[33:00] man brings out now how attributes have
[33:02] to display themselves so now Adam at the
[33:04] point of him being created he had this
[33:07] attribute of a female part having a
[33:10] bride but that attribute was still in
[33:13] him okay now remember Adam was made in
[33:18] the image of God all right so we're just
[33:20] going to read that let's go to Genesis 1
[33:23] 26 and
[33:25] 27 Genesis 1:26 and
[33:32] 27 so it says here and God said now
[33:37] notice you know it's another subject you
[33:41] know but but notice in this very first
[33:43] beginning of this verse 26 he says and
[33:45] God said let us now maybe someone's got
[33:47] a question somewhere about that one it
[33:48] says let us make man God now one person
[33:52] it seems one person God says let us make
[33:55] man in our own image now if you notice
[33:58] creation everything else has been
[33:59] created now but if you read the
[34:01] scripture further on all things were
[34:03] created through Christ Jesus amen okay
[34:06] that's this one that we see here okay
[34:09] all things were created through them so
[34:10] now at this point in time that the the
[34:13] the the the uh the Lord God um is is
[34:17] creating
[34:19] Adam making man in his own image it's
[34:22] the Lord Jesus Christ that is's now
[34:24] speaking okay so the Lord is speaking
[34:27] saying let us make man in our will who's
[34:29] he talking to well there the Son and the
[34:32] father they're both one person but it's
[34:34] the son who's saying let us make man the
[34:36] the image that we are in this image that
[34:39] I am in that I've come out this logos
[34:41] and now I'm in this form that I've
[34:43] created the heavens and the Earth and
[34:44] I've already done all the animals and
[34:45] the herbs of the field and all the rest
[34:47] of it so now let us make man he's done
[34:49] all the animals from the great it
[34:51] doesn't matter which way it was from the
[34:53] Frog to the chimpanzee or or the from
[34:55] the deer to the horse whatever it was
[34:57] but he done it all but now he says let
[34:58] us make man now we're on another story
[35:00] so now he says let us make man in our
[35:03] image okay let's let's read so he's so
[35:06] it's let us make man so this one saying
[35:07] us is this is this us is kind of two
[35:12] beings it's kind of two beings let us
[35:14] make man in our image we could actually
[35:18] I could have we could have
[35:20] just gone on to the subject you know
[35:22] where brother says I was in David I was
[35:24] in this I was in that I was in across
[35:26] the Delaware River cuz I'm going to
[35:27] American but in Christ Jesus I was in
[35:30] Christ when I created the heavens of the
[35:31] earth if he was in Christ Jesus when he
[35:33] created heavens and the Earth then you
[35:35] know let us make manone in our image
[35:36] that attribute was there although we
[35:38] couldn't see it it was there so let's
[35:40] not get into that one let us make manone
[35:42] in our image after the like after our
[35:44] likeness and let them have dominion over
[35:48] the fish of the sea over the fowl of the
[35:50] air over the cattle over the over all
[35:52] the Earth over every creeping thing that
[35:54] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[35:58] man in his own image in the image of God
[36:02] created he him male and female created
[36:05] he
[36:07] them so notice however Adam was that's
[36:12] how the Lord Jesus was amen however
[36:15] James is you want to see to be fair I
[36:17] think I said this last time didn't I if
[36:19] you want to see what an Abbot looks like
[36:20] just look at me we got the big teeth and
[36:22] the big forehead that's it you know and
[36:24] that's kind of how it is if you want to
[36:26] see the Father the the father looks like
[36:28] look at the son but if you want to see
[36:30] what how the Lord looked maybe what you
[36:33] know Moses saw when he turned his head
[36:35] into the Clift of The Rock and what did
[36:37] he see back parts of a man you know in
[36:40] the image of Adam so if you you could
[36:42] say well if you want to know what Adam
[36:44] looked like well Moses knew from his
[36:46] back part anyway you know what I'm
[36:47] saying in the image of God created he
[36:50] them so now that's how the that's how
[36:52] the Lord Jesus was see if you want to
[36:54] look at Adam you look at the Lord Jesus
[36:56] you look at the same one because he's
[36:57] made in image okay image being um you
[37:01] know not not the exact facial features
[37:03] obviously but you know what I'm saying
[37:05] read between the line so notice notice
[37:06] here singular we can see this singular
[37:08] here it says God created man in the
[37:11] image of God created he him so that's
[37:15] verse
[37:16] 27 so this is singular we noce singular
[37:19] God created man singular
[37:21] okay uh in the image of God created he
[37:24] him him is singular okay and then he
[37:27] goes on to say male and female created
[37:30] he
[37:31] them so somewhere in here is this kind
[37:34] of mystery which is for the denational
[37:37] world to understand I'm sure they would
[37:38] be scratching the head but that's
[37:41] it it's not hard
[37:44] so without so now within Adam now with
[37:48] it not yet being manifest is this
[37:51] attribute of himself in Bride form and
[37:54] it
[37:55] took you know it is his Simon when the
[37:59] Lord put him to sleep you know I just
[38:01] wonder if it was like you know within 3
[38:04] days that you know what I'm saying you
[38:06] know what I'm saying it's nice it's
[38:08] these these types he he puts him to
[38:10] sleep and in that time we know the quote
[38:12] where talks about it we'll get to that
[38:14] later on how the Lord Jesus was in him
[38:15] on the cross but you see the Lord she
[38:18] she's in there although he not yet
[38:20] manifested she's still there
[38:22] now don't be confused with Eve being
[38:26] there but not there don't be it's it's
[38:28] it's a hidden it's not yet manifest why
[38:30] I keep saying this otherwise you're
[38:32] going to get someone confused thinking
[38:33] well did he have forearms and two four
[38:36] ex no it's not like that it's like James
[38:39] and John yeah so if we'd have seen now
[38:44] Adam before Genesis 21 let's just read
[38:47] Genesis uh Genesis 2:21 sorry read
[38:50] Genesis it's just over the page Genesis
[38:55] 2:21 uh 21-22
[38:57] says and the Lord God caused a deep
[39:00] sleep to fall upon Ammon and he slept
[39:02] and he took one of his ribs closed up
[39:04] the flesh instead thereof and the rib
[39:06] which the Lord took had taken from man
[39:09] made he a woman and brought her unto the
[39:13] man so if you would have seen
[39:16] Adam before what we've just read here
[39:19] you would have seen one man okay if you
[39:22] would see Adam after that now you see
[39:24] two people
[39:26] yeah uh I'm trying to see where it says
[39:28] and he called their name
[39:30] Adam which one is it Genesis 5
[39:34] where what 5
[39:38] one no
[39:43] hey I'm glad we're family what is it
[39:46] help help me 52 52 52 this is uh that's
[39:50] it that's it there boom okay so it says
[39:53] male and female created we read from the
[39:54] verse uh verse one this is the book of
[39:56] generations of Adam in the day that God
[39:59] created man in the likeness of God made
[40:02] he him male and female created he them
[40:06] and blessed them and called their name
[40:08] Adam one name in the day when they were
[40:13] created that's it sweet thank you so we
[40:16] can see here that you know what we're
[40:17] talking about we can see these
[40:18] attributes that are not yet
[40:20] manifested now You' only seen one person
[40:23] before so the scriptures showing us that
[40:26] the Lord is pointing the scriptures
[40:28] pointing us towards the
[40:29] Lord being the same image as Adam now we
[40:34] we we've seen this that the brides
[40:36] hidden in Adam and then brought out a
[40:39] later date okay and the Adam at the
[40:42] point of Adam being created this is how
[40:44] the Lord looked right okay fine so we've
[40:47] read at the beginning which was
[40:49] Ephesians we've read how we were chosen
[40:52] in him let's just go back to Ephesians 1
[40:53] I think it's verse 4 that one isn't it
[40:55] Ephesians 1 verse4 Ephesians 1 verse 4
[40:59] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[41:02] before the foundation of the world that
[41:05] we should be holy and Without Blame
[41:06] before him in love okay so before the
[41:09] foundation of the world although not yet
[41:12] manifested you were in his body in he
[41:15] you were in him in that form that only
[41:18] the Lord
[41:19] knows so back then which is this one
[41:22] we're talking about you the bride were
[41:26] in him now you were his body so just
[41:28] turn over Ephesians 1 22 and 23 it's
[41:32] just there and he hath put all things
[41:34] under his feet and gave him to be the
[41:36] head over all things to the church which
[41:39] is his body the fullness of him that
[41:42] filth all in all so already now listen
[41:47] although not yet manifested we can see
[41:49] now by reading this
[41:51] scripture your
[41:54] predestinated purpose for being here
[41:56] your it wasn't manifested but your
[41:58] purpose for being here is to be his body
[42:01] amen okay the body of the
[42:03] bride and you were just waiting to
[42:05] become manifested let's just turn let's
[42:07] go to Jehovah Gyra brother B says in 16
[42:09] 1964 God separated cuty the body the
[42:13] bride of Christ has to come right back
[42:15] to the first now Eve was he says what
[42:17] was Eve her and Adam was the same they
[42:21] were called Adam they were Spirit when
[42:23] he formed man the first time he made him
[42:26] in him his own image and God is a spirit
[42:30] in the image of God created he him male
[42:32] and female created he them he was and
[42:34] then still there was no man to till the
[42:36] soil then God formed Man Out of the Dust
[42:39] of the earth and put this Jewel Spirit
[42:41] into him and that was the first Adam
[42:44] then when he separated Eve from Adam
[42:46] Adam fell by by disbelieving the word
[42:48] see that's right that's where the church
[42:50] fail today disbelieving the word
[42:52] okay so you can see how we we see how
[42:56] Eve came from Adam
[42:57] Adam was made in the Lord's image and we
[43:00] can read that when we reading this we
[43:02] reading when we read about Adam here
[43:04] when we see this quote where brother R's
[43:05] talking we are seeing ourselves because
[43:07] the Lord's already shown us that however
[43:09] Adam is that's how I am so now we can
[43:11] see it's it's it's got to be a perfect
[43:13] timee it's got to follow it's got to
[43:15] follow let's see rising of the sun I'm
[43:18] just trying to get a few a little
[43:19] background brother bam says
[43:22] uh and the rising of the Sun the spirit
[43:24] left him now this is now the typing of
[43:26] the Bride Christ and the bride we've
[43:28] looked at the eve and Adam this is this
[43:30] is Christ and the bride the spirit left
[43:31] him in the garden of Geer he had to die
[43:33] a man remember friends he didn't have to
[43:35] do that that was God God anointed that
[43:37] flesh which was human flesh and he
[43:39] didn't if he went up there as God he
[43:41] would never have died that kind of death
[43:42] you can't kill God but he didn't have to
[43:44] do it but remember he went there with
[43:47] you in him see God had I love this quote
[43:51] God had never separated the bride from
[43:53] the groom yet so when God looked down
[43:56] upon the body of Christ he saw both male
[43:59] and female it was all redeemed in that
[44:01] one body seed they are one the same the
[44:04] same word the same word spoke of the
[44:06] groom speaks of the
[44:07] Bride that's that's just that's just
[44:09] quite mindblowing really we're looking
[44:12] at a predestinated
[44:15] purpose and we're looking at our our
[44:18] position in Christ is
[44:20] predestinated predestinated means it's
[44:22] already planned out you know our I like
[44:25] to I'm a bit thick but you know I like
[44:27] to break it down like the our
[44:29] destination is pre it's
[44:31] predestination you know it helps me to
[44:33] kind of see it now it's like the old
[44:34] satav that was set up back then you know
[44:37] it's done you know before the foundation
[44:40] of the world so now I've got a
[44:41] question where did I
[44:44] begin where did you begin notice you
[44:49] know I personally I was
[44:51] manifested in
[44:53] 1980 yeah but when did I begin
[44:57] see what I mean when did you begin see
[45:01] we've got no memory of this but we're in
[45:04] this we we we we were an attribute of
[45:07] God back then you know way back before
[45:10] the world began and you know we're
[45:12] actually learning and growing and
[45:14] through the Revelation Lord is showing
[45:15] us what our identity is we've we've got
[45:18] the mirror of the word that becomes
[45:20] clearer and clearer and we're seeing the
[45:22] picture daily clearer amen you know it's
[45:26] it's like these tiny little pieces that
[45:27] come together here a little there a
[45:29] little you know um he kind of paints a
[45:31] picture you know I went to um went to
[45:34] Germany went to uh brother Andreas had
[45:38] was like a a chist like a family get
[45:41] Camp Family Camp convention and we went
[45:44] to a place called wburg it's where
[45:47] Martin Luther wrote the old um
[45:49] translated the
[45:51] Bible and uh it's it's it's a castle on
[45:54] a
[45:55] hill and
[45:57] unfortunately the guide wasn't that
[45:59] interested in
[46:00] Luther and they took all the time
[46:02] showing this huge castle well in this
[46:05] Castle there's this there's this room
[46:07] that is absolutely humongous it's
[46:10] huge and and it's it's just a one huge
[46:13] Mosaic you can look at it Wiki I guess
[46:16] and I think it's called the El Elizabeth
[46:18] room or something but it it's made up
[46:21] it's it's it's it's the roof as as I
[46:23] remember it's the ceiling the walls
[46:26] theyve got these colise
[46:27] things and it's it's this huge Mosaic I
[46:30] think those are a milliion 500 little
[46:33] pieces which I'm sure now dayss it would
[46:35] be like yeah big deal but back then I
[46:37] mean we're talking like you know it's
[46:39] it's huge so now but when you kind of
[46:41] get close up and you would kind of look
[46:44] real close you'd just see kind of blurry
[46:47] but kind of when when you kind of stand
[46:49] back and you can see all these little
[46:51] pieces come together suddenly you start
[46:53] to see what the picture looks like and
[46:56] the message the picture of the message
[46:58] if we would just kind of stand back and
[47:00] see all these little Revelations that
[47:01] the Lord shown us here a little there a
[47:04] little then we would see what was in the
[47:05] mind of the Creator way back there when
[47:08] you were still just in attribute form
[47:11] you would see it and so that's what we
[47:13] want to do we just want to try and Rise
[47:14] a little bit higher and see the picture
[47:16] a little bit clearer you know I um I
[47:19] think I think once I uh I ministered
[47:23] once on um back at home you know this
[47:25] there's like a city
[47:27] there houses here and houses there and
[47:30] there like this one's a like a castley
[47:32] thing here and and and and it's a wall
[47:35] City okay and this is the word this is
[47:38] this is this is like you could say
[47:39] message churches so this is like a wall
[47:41] all the way around the city is this wall
[47:43] and
[47:44] um and and so you get these you get
[47:48] folks that'll stand in in the
[47:51] city and this is all the word of God all
[47:54] these buildings are all the word of God
[47:56] right
[47:57] and this one is maybe
[47:59] uh this one's maybe Luther's message
[48:02] Luther Luther and this one's maybe the
[48:05] seals seals and uh want to say Luther's
[48:08] message like justification yeah
[48:09] justification and maybe this one's the
[48:11] the baptism baptism ISM and you know you
[48:15] get you get all these different parts of
[48:17] of of the
[48:18] message and this guy that's looking here
[48:21] now you got to read between the lines
[48:22] what I'm trying to say he's looking now
[48:24] from his point of view he can see this
[48:28] so he's uh he's uh uh how do I go that
[48:33] one look at that his his uh bck Winkle
[48:36] his um the angle of his view the angle
[48:40] of his view is is like he can see this
[48:43] much okay and he can see this one and
[48:46] this one and this one now you got
[48:47] somebody else who's here on this side
[48:49] and he can see this one but actually if
[48:51] you would look at the angle of his view
[48:53] there's a piece that he can't see so
[48:56] that's what you get you get oh like like
[48:57] in the message somebody might just grabb
[48:58] something and run with it and and
[49:01] actually they are
[49:02] right they're right they're seeing it
[49:05] how it is but they can't see the one
[49:07] behind it and the Lord's constantly
[49:09] telling us to come up higher because I
[49:11] can't draw an eagle but we're supposed
[49:12] to be this big eagle this big eagle
[49:14] flying higher and we can look down so
[49:17] we're trying to kind of we're supposed
[49:19] to rise higher and if you would just
[49:21] stand higher suddenly you can see all
[49:23] these little facets of the message so
[49:26] that's why we're trying to do we just
[49:27] want to raise a little bit higher and
[49:29] just kind of see all these little bits
[49:31] of of the word here a little there a
[49:33] little and build up this Mosaic picture
[49:36] of the revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:39] because you know so what's so important
[49:40] about knowing who see for me this I say
[49:42] burden like this it's like you've got to
[49:44] know who the Lord is you've got to know
[49:46] who you are because the revelation of
[49:48] Jesus Christ includes you this one if
[49:52] you this this is your identity the
[49:55] revelation of Jesus Christ is
[49:57] you and if you think about the word
[49:59] revelation it's it's the
[50:02] revealation of who you are it's the
[50:05] taking of the the the blanket off the
[50:07] statue it's seeing who you are it's
[50:10] revealing everything that was here back
[50:12] in him way back before time was amen all
[50:16] these attributes of God the revelation
[50:18] of Jesus Christ is showing us we've
[50:19] seeing this picture clearly of how he is
[50:22] his eternal plan and everything and it's
[50:24] including you you are part of the
[50:27] mystery of God you are part of this
[50:30] mystery and this mystery has been hid
[50:32] since the beginning of the world since
[50:33] the foundation of the world the mystery
[50:36] has been hid you've been in him that
[50:37] doesn't mean you didn't exist it just
[50:39] means that you weren't manifested yet
[50:41] amen now we have to realize that you are
[50:45] here no way or form are you here by
[50:48] chance in any
[50:49] way if you're sitting here and you
[50:52] haven't met the Lord yet that's not my
[50:54] chance if you're sitting here and you're
[50:56] praying for some some it's not by chance
[50:58] everything there is nothing here about
[51:00] us that is by chance in every way and
[51:02] and listen everything all of now I'm not
[51:04] talking about um you know the person
[51:08] here that I me I've got to be careful we
[51:10] don't get too many amens here the person
[51:12] here that likes that likes Taco Bell or
[51:14] whatever it's called you know we're not
[51:15] talking about that that's just junk
[51:17] we're not talking about somebody who
[51:19] likes uh this car or that car but we're
[51:22] talking about the attributes of God
[51:23] we're talking about those attributes of
[51:25] God and everything the attributes of God
[51:27] where the Lord's dealt with you in your
[51:28] life everything was in here I keep
[51:31] pointing down here you know what I mean
[51:32] I mean there so everything was in here
[51:34] everything that you are those things
[51:36] that the Lord's made you you see but
[51:39] it's only now after all these years
[51:40] after such a long time that you see the
[51:43] manifestation of what was in there it's
[51:46] coming out now we're seeing look we are
[51:49] seeing as the Lord changes us who was I
[51:51] with the other day I was with somebody
[51:53] and they told a real nice Tess brother
[51:55] bro
[51:57] jiah jiah tell him his testimony how the
[52:00] Lord came to him each test I'm not
[52:02] lifting one up the other it's just
[52:04] that's the one that comes to mind so
[52:05] brother it's like the testimony things
[52:07] that he sees things that the Lord shown
[52:09] him it's like this is now the character
[52:13] that the Lord's made in each brother
[52:15] here each sister here is this what was
[52:18] in the mind of God before the world
[52:20] began we see the Revelation the
[52:23] revealation of what was in God's mind
[52:26] for brother Brian you I mean sister Anna
[52:29] and Amanda see we can see that we can
[52:31] see it's revealed you what I mean and
[52:34] now you know the attributes that were
[52:37] hidden are sitting here back then it the
[52:41] Lord was male and female because he
[52:42] created him in the image of Adam it's
[52:45] clear but back then you couldn't see it
[52:47] but now I'm actually looking I am
[52:49] physically looking at what was hidden in
[52:52] God before the foundation of the world
[52:55] I'm physically looking turn around and
[52:56] look at your brother and sister look at
[52:58] them you are physically looking at what
[53:00] was there oh well I don't know what was
[53:03] there I'm looking at it see what I mean
[53:06] you got to see who we are it's in plain
[53:08] view we are not here by chance every
[53:11] little you know I don't think you even
[53:14] say in German we say an e canob we've
[53:17] got a corner missing in Swiss we say you
[53:19] know every little corner every little
[53:21] twitch that we've got the character that
[53:23] the Lord shaped it's there for a purpose
[53:25] amen there for a
[53:27] purpose let's just turn to Psalms 139
[53:30] Psalms 1
[53:32] 139 Psalms
[53:35] 139 and we'll read 13- 16
[53:40] 13-6 the Lord's
[53:45] good it says for thou Hast possessed my
[53:49] Reigns thou Hast covered me in my
[53:52] mother's womb now just I mean that just
[53:54] blows your mind away just
[53:57] but David Goes further yeah I mean like
[54:00] whoa whoa whoa you covered me in my
[54:02] mother's womb it's like whoa boom no no
[54:06] no David Goes further yeah I will praise
[54:10] thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully
[54:11] made marvelous are thy works and that my
[54:15] soul knoweth right well my substance was
[54:18] not hid from thee when I was made in
[54:20] secret and curiously wrought in the
[54:22] lower parts of the earth Thine Eyes did
[54:25] see my substance yet being imperfect and
[54:28] in thy book all my members were written
[54:32] which in continuance were fashioned when
[54:35] as yet there was none of them wo so now
[54:40] David is saying
[54:42] here but I mean I'm just going to put it
[54:44] in modern language my grandfather wasn't
[54:48] even born my grandfather was still
[54:51] getting flipped over in the furrow with
[54:53] the plow really between the lines yeah
[54:57] we we come from this Earth You Know
[54:59] mother eats minerals and stuff where's
[55:00] the minerals come from the lettuce
[55:01] where's the lettuce come from the ground
[55:03] so the minerals and vitamins were still
[55:05] getting flipped over in the furrow of my
[55:08] great grandfather when the Lord saw
[55:13] me your brain just turns to Mush when
[55:15] you start to think about it think about
[55:18] it curiously amazingly put together and
[55:21] now notice David is saying here that
[55:24] that I wasn't even born Thine Eyes verse
[55:27] 16 Thine Eyes did see my substance the
[55:30] minerals that were getting flipped over
[55:31] in the furrow okay when I uh yet being
[55:35] unperfect and in thy book all my members
[55:38] were written which in continuance were
[55:40] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[55:42] them yeah the Lord saw us in the Lord's
[55:46] book we were already written we were
[55:49] already done although not yet
[55:52] manifested so
[55:54] now I just want to draw this one
[55:57] wrong one here you go moving to one side
[56:00] so I want to and draw this one this is
[56:03] uh this is who can I pick
[56:05] on it's a man I've drawn a man so it's
[56:08] brother
[56:09] Gabe this is Brother
[56:13] Gabe brother Gabe is somebody who's been
[56:16] through a lot we've all been through a
[56:18] lot but brother Gabe's been through a
[56:19] lot so now here's Gabe and I'm going to
[56:22] go back a few
[56:23] Generations Mom oh I can't spell m mom
[56:28] and dad okay
[56:31] Mom
[56:33] Dad my hands going to be dropping off by
[56:35] the time I'm finished Mom Dad Mom Dad
[56:41] Mom Dad Mom Dad wake me up when I'm done
[56:45] Mom Dad Mom Dad Mom D Mom Dad are your
[56:52] brains turning to Mush
[56:54] yet not from bordom from like whoo this
[56:57] is crazy Mom Dad Mom Dad okay so we have
[57:03] physically gone back this is Brother
[57:05] Gabe this is his generation that's
[57:08] one that's actually when he was born
[57:10] here actually he's born here uh two
[57:13] three it's that three generations is
[57:15] that right I think that's right sweet
[57:19] so let's just say let's just say brother
[57:23] Gabe was thir brother Gabe's parents
[57:25] this is time here this is time obviously
[57:27] it's time time okay brother gab's
[57:30] parents were 30 years old they were 30
[57:34] okay when brother Gabe was
[57:36] born now you've got 30 years here
[57:39] because of their parents you got 30
[57:41] years here because of their parents and
[57:43] 30 years
[57:44] there we've only gone back three gen
[57:47] like 90 years yeah we've only gone back
[57:50] like 90 years forget the 4,000 years
[57:52] since
[57:54] Noah like uh like yeah no
[57:56] like forget that that we've gone back 90
[57:59] years just forgive me I can't understand
[58:03] it it's just it is so
[58:05] phenomenal it just your mind begins to
[58:09] look you know I don't want to get into
[58:11] it too much brother gab's parents were
[58:15] 30 that's quite a lot of life before
[58:18] brother Gabe was born yeah but he had to
[58:21] be conceived you know what I mean on a
[58:24] certain day right yeah
[58:27] and how
[58:28] many chances how can I say this how many
[58:31] chances of brother Gabe being born could
[58:34] have been over the 30 years yeah you
[58:37] know because his mom and dad were mom
[58:39] and dad and they lived as Mom and Dad
[58:41] right and it's not just you know you
[58:44] know what I'm saying it's the the the
[58:46] the chances are just
[58:49] like so then you know we sometimes we
[58:52] have parents that don't have a baby for
[58:54] like 10 or 15 years is then suddenly
[58:57] once born this is not by chance this is
[59:01] because this particular in order to get
[59:04] brother Gabe exactly as he is this
[59:07] particular one here had to wait 10 years
[59:11] because it had to be born in a certain
[59:13] way on a certain day during a war so
[59:16] that there would be that fear and
[59:19] certain C or missing from Brother Gabe
[59:22] in a certain situation or the way that
[59:25] he's just strong and he's just you know
[59:26] he's just you know he had to be that way
[59:29] and he comes from there yeah it's like
[59:32] you know people some some brother and
[59:33] sister I don't want to know but somebody
[59:35] maybe they kind of ho stuff you know ho
[59:38] stuff like kind of gather stuff up and
[59:42] without knowing it that's the character
[59:44] that you guys are a lot of people
[59:46] laughing at me right
[59:47] now and without you knowing it it's
[59:49] coming from the war or whatever it's
[59:52] been the time of depression in the I
[59:53] think you in the 20s wasn't it the 20s
[59:55] that time time of depression and within
[59:57] you is that built-in fear which makes
[1:00:00] you gather all the stuff and the Lord's
[1:00:02] got it in way I'm just telling some
[1:00:03] story that that that you can't even
[1:00:05] throw the tracks away that are old and
[1:00:08] smelly until you die it's all right
[1:00:10] you're laughing until you die and then
[1:00:14] the person that cleans out your house
[1:00:16] picks up the old smelly tract that you
[1:00:18] couldn't throw away reads it and comes
[1:00:20] to eternal life do you know what I mean
[1:00:21] you know what I mean it's it's just like
[1:00:23] you can laugh it's fine we're all good
[1:00:25] it's you see what I mean like every you
[1:00:27] know
[1:00:29] predestination goes further than what we
[1:00:32] think and you know brother R would say
[1:00:35] maybe hopefully it's not sacriligious
[1:00:37] look the timber that this Pulpit is made
[1:00:40] of you know how much they say that they
[1:00:42] say I think it was brother Steve golden
[1:00:43] was telling Josh something about the
[1:00:45] guitar how it sounds better older it is
[1:00:47] or the music that tones the wood or
[1:00:49] something you know how tone this wood
[1:00:51] is you know how much word this is soaked
[1:00:54] up yeah phenomenal so don't tell me that
[1:00:56] the Lord knew what exactly the materials
[1:00:59] that he would choose to have his word
[1:01:02] delivered and the the chairs that you're
[1:01:04] sitting on goes further than we think so
[1:01:07] now that's in the natural which to to
[1:01:09] the Lord yeah it's phenomenal but it's
[1:01:11] actually not that important you are
[1:01:12] important and everything about you is so
[1:01:15] important we've gone back like 90 years
[1:01:18] here and each parent has gone
[1:01:21] through Wars trial tribulation and
[1:01:26] everything listen you know within your I
[1:01:28] don't know much about it but you know
[1:01:31] the old DNA stuff it's got um like an
[1:01:33] imprint of everything about you in it
[1:01:36] your eyesight everything you need you
[1:01:40] know have you ever thought
[1:01:41] that maybe somebody's been given bad
[1:01:43] eyesight because they're not supposed to
[1:01:45] see something I don't know it's just the
[1:01:48] way that the Lord's doing it he's caring
[1:01:50] over your soul he's not looking like to
[1:01:53] to to to the things around you that's
[1:01:55] all to do with it but you see what I
[1:01:56] mean it's your soul it's your character
[1:01:58] it's that Eternal part of you you know
[1:02:00] the DNA is just so complex that it
[1:02:02] begins to blow your mind you know the
[1:02:05] the the job that your great great pick
[1:02:08] pick a number pick a number this goes
[1:02:09] back forever this one here this this one
[1:02:11] here this one here brother Gabe you you
[1:02:14] don't even know you can't even you know
[1:02:17] your granddad your granddad and maybe a
[1:02:20] great grand but you don't even know the
[1:02:21] next
[1:02:22] one that's how you know what I mean but
[1:02:24] let's just say this one was was a
[1:02:26] carpenter carpenter okay and May and
[1:02:29] maybe he I don't know when he was 21
[1:02:32] tripped and broke his leg and something
[1:02:33] and within him there's a fear of
[1:02:34] slipping on ice and it's come all the
[1:02:36] way brother Gabe had to have that I
[1:02:38] think we need to you say Simon you're
[1:02:40] just waffling on now no you've got to
[1:02:42] understand this plan of predestination
[1:02:43] and we see the natural types and who we
[1:02:45] are and how we are and then suddenly we
[1:02:47] can start to see the spiritual types and
[1:02:49] how the Lord's chosen us to manifest
[1:02:51] himself and we have to be in this kind
[1:02:53] of form that the Lord's made us in in
[1:02:55] order of him to manifest himself to the
[1:02:58] full
[1:02:59] potential you know brother R tells a
[1:03:02] story I'm just going to read this he
[1:03:05] tells a story of a pigeon that saves
[1:03:08] lives so this is time of the first world
[1:03:10] war brother so it's uh God hiding
[1:03:13] himself in Simplicity in 63 but says in
[1:03:16] the time of the first World War I had my
[1:03:18] father's older brothers there and my
[1:03:20] cousins were in that war many of them
[1:03:21] got killed but in one place there was a
[1:03:23] whole Regiment of soldiers American
[1:03:25] soldiers pinned out the German Army had
[1:03:26] pinned them down and machine gun fire
[1:03:28] big cannons whatever they had mottar
[1:03:29] fire whatever it was had them pinned
[1:03:31] down they couldn't get out and there was
[1:03:33] no way of getting out there was a whole
[1:03:36] Regiment of soldiers perishing in there
[1:03:37] because they was on every side they had
[1:03:39] planes they D send one up shoot it down
[1:03:42] a man tried to get out well just on
[1:03:44] every side there was nothing the Fine
[1:03:46] Guns failed all the military strategy
[1:03:47] had failed they were pinned in by the
[1:03:49] enemy there was no way of getting out
[1:03:51] there was nothing and finally one little
[1:03:53] soldier came up found a pigeon one of
[1:03:56] those Homer pigeons he calls it Homer
[1:03:57] pigeon homing pigeon that was their only
[1:04:00] hope they wrote a message and thought if
[1:04:02] this pigeon can only get through back to
[1:04:04] the main headquarters where it came from
[1:04:06] can take this message a message pigeon a
[1:04:08] messenger pigeon that was the only thing
[1:04:11] they had a simple little pigeon all
[1:04:13] their military things had failed but
[1:04:14] they got a simple little pigeon and they
[1:04:16] wrote the message and tied it on his
[1:04:17] little leg turned him loose with a
[1:04:19] blessing and a prayer that he would make
[1:04:20] it and of course the Germans seen the
[1:04:22] white pigeon going they fired at it and
[1:04:24] everything else one bullet went through
[1:04:25] his wing knocked the feathers out one
[1:04:27] stripped around its neck and cut his
[1:04:28] craw off the other struck its leg pardon
[1:04:31] me that had the message on it but this
[1:04:33] poor little pigeon kept flying trying to
[1:04:36] get the message in he must there was
[1:04:37] lives at stake finally with his
[1:04:39] struggles flopping in the air turning
[1:04:41] and fly and fell and he fell into the
[1:04:43] barracks of the camp where the soldiers
[1:04:44] was one soldier picked it up looked at
[1:04:47] him this little fellow said he's been
[1:04:49] shot he opened looked on his little leg
[1:04:51] on his little bruised leg and there was
[1:04:52] a note they read the note and it was
[1:04:54] covered in blood though covered with the
[1:04:55] message got through it got through they
[1:04:57] sent reinforcements quickly and saved
[1:04:59] the whole Regiment of soldiers if the
[1:05:01] little pigeon hadn't got through all
[1:05:03] them men would have perished and what a
[1:05:05] disaster that would have
[1:05:06] been
[1:05:08] right I've got a question for you have
[1:05:10] we ever looked at this story with a
[1:05:12] different
[1:05:13] angle you know what
[1:05:17] if brother Branham tells the story what
[1:05:21] if this one here this one here was one
[1:05:26] of those
[1:05:27] men see what I mean well if that was one
[1:05:31] of those men and through God's
[1:05:33] predestinated plan yeah and and we can
[1:05:36] we can look at the word so many so many
[1:05:38] different ways but just think about it
[1:05:40] if they had perished that one had
[1:05:42] perished yeah and then where would you
[1:05:45] be where would Anthony be if his great
[1:05:47] great-grandfather had perished he
[1:05:48] wouldn't be here see the Lord watches
[1:05:51] over his seed he his seed let's just
[1:05:53] read God hiding in simplicity already
[1:05:56] pardon me that starts the one with um
[1:05:58] with brother B but we read here how how
[1:06:00] look he says he says that would be such
[1:06:02] a terrible thing if the pigeon hadn't
[1:06:03] got through all them men would have
[1:06:05] perished what a disaster would be listen
[1:06:08] amongst the soldiers there was a seed
[1:06:10] laying there look and I know that's true
[1:06:12] because it's the same for me you know my
[1:06:14] my my my grand my granddad was uh my
[1:06:17] granddad was sent over I think it was
[1:06:19] like 2 three days after D-Day I I don't
[1:06:21] know that much about history I never
[1:06:23] really listened to be honest but you
[1:06:24] know I wasn't very good student went
[1:06:27] over to a D-Day and and just the way it
[1:06:30] all happened was him and his best friend
[1:06:32] there was there was mortifier coming in
[1:06:35] pardon me they jumped into a ditch
[1:06:36] together and when my dad woke up my
[1:06:38] granddad woke up his best friend was
[1:06:41] gone and his leg was gone but if he
[1:06:44] hadn't have
[1:06:45] survived where would I be you see how
[1:06:49] many times do we see these
[1:06:51] situations where you know it just it
[1:06:54] just it's phenomenal protection of the
[1:06:56] god over his seed you say well what do
[1:06:58] you on about why are you going on about
[1:07:00] this let's move on whoa whoa whoa slow
[1:07:02] down this is directly got to do with
[1:07:05] this amen because if you weren't here
[1:07:09] today how can you manifest God Amen how
[1:07:12] can you manifest God you
[1:07:15] know the
[1:07:17] Lord he shows
[1:07:20] us he's showing us how important we are
[1:07:24] we should we we need to see like the
[1:07:26] true predestination what it means to be
[1:07:28] truly predestinated then we can begin to
[1:07:30] understand who we are and why we are
[1:07:32] because I'm telling you what each one of
[1:07:33] us we've got we've got we've all got
[1:07:35] questions Lord why am I like this is it
[1:07:38] just me is it just me like like Lord why
[1:07:42] am I like this why why why listen this
[1:07:46] has taken thousands of years of
[1:07:48] complexes and problems to make us the
[1:07:51] way we are and he for a reason you know
[1:07:55] I just hope try I hope this kind of
[1:07:57] helps you to understand as well you know
[1:07:59] one one person's nervous one person's
[1:08:01] quiet and it seems everybody's unhappy
[1:08:04] with the way they are is anybody happy
[1:08:06] in here of how they are I mean come on
[1:08:08] is anybody happy no we've all got the
[1:08:11] why and we all question but I tell you
[1:08:13] it's for a reason it's for a reason you
[1:08:17] know God's made us this way for a
[1:08:18] purpose he wants to manifest himself
[1:08:21] through you and in order to do that to
[1:08:23] express himself you've got to a certain
[1:08:26] way remember you are expressed to all
[1:08:28] men you are Epistles read of all men
[1:08:31] you're the god word word of God on
[1:08:33] display let's just read brother says in
[1:08:35] 1963 look he says I love to shoot now
[1:08:38] he's talking about himself like and
[1:08:41] brother R had this question himself why
[1:08:43] why why Lord why says I love to shoot
[1:08:45] and targets not here long ago squ
[1:08:47] hunting down in Kentucky and I had a
[1:08:49] little model 75 it sounds I hope it
[1:08:51] doesn't sound sacrilegious to you to say
[1:08:53] this in a sermon but I will tell you I'm
[1:08:55] trying to make a point and this little
[1:08:56] rifle I trained it in and I've dealt
[1:08:58] with and dealt with fools and fooled
[1:09:00] with kids fooled with guns since I was a
[1:09:03] little kid I love them and this little
[1:09:05] model 75 I could just every time hit a
[1:09:07] squirrel's eye at 50 yards with
[1:09:10] it that's pretty good I had a paper from
[1:09:12] a range down there signed up driving
[1:09:14] nine bullets through the same hole at 50
[1:09:16] yards on a rainy windy day I got it
[1:09:18] signed up and notorized and that was the
[1:09:19] Lord helping me of course to do that
[1:09:20] that's unusual I say brother always he
[1:09:23] doesn't boast some of us can do good
[1:09:25] things the Lord also through this whole
[1:09:27] family tree thing we've got skills some
[1:09:29] of us have got skills to do things like
[1:09:32] that are unbelievable I mean
[1:09:34] like painting you know what I'm saying
[1:09:38] it's amazing like the painting but
[1:09:39] that's a blessing to somebody else and
[1:09:42] there's Carpenters there's Builders and
[1:09:44] there's welders there's there's people
[1:09:46] brother
[1:09:47] Richie is brother Richie just got skills
[1:09:50] in like knowing stuff about stuff you
[1:09:52] got brother Jonathan who's just like
[1:09:55] wires everywhere and he knows what he's
[1:09:57] doing but it's a blessing to somebody
[1:09:59] you see what I mean it's it's it's the
[1:10:00] Lord's so so it's not but we don't ever
[1:10:02] say well you know I mean you know what I
[1:10:05] mean no it's like oh the Lord helps me
[1:10:07] so brother R he's got these strengths
[1:10:10] but the Lord helps him he always
[1:10:11] realizes it's the Lord that's helping
[1:10:13] him so brother R continues he says I
[1:10:15] started to shoot the squirrel I found
[1:10:16] out I hit him somewhere else beside the
[1:10:18] eye I got nervous and I tried again on
[1:10:21] paper that's stick a piece of paper I
[1:10:22] guess and he wouldn't hit the target I
[1:10:24] couldn't hit with or quarter of an inch
[1:10:26] which is
[1:10:28] like that much or half an inch or
[1:10:31] something 50 yards but I knew I could do
[1:10:34] uh it would do better than that I've
[1:10:36] done everything to the gun that I know
[1:10:38] how to do nothing seemed to fix it up
[1:10:39] right so I wrapped it up in the Box send
[1:10:41] it back to to come the Examination for
[1:10:42] rebedding they wrote me a nice letter
[1:10:45] said I've uh I have my file at home said
[1:10:48] Reverend Brandon that rifle Will Group
[1:10:49] an inch that's that that much at 25
[1:10:52] yards so it's it's just a model 75 it's
[1:10:54] not a T gun it's just a little plinker
[1:10:56] he said you'll never get any better than
[1:10:58] that now that was intern a company that
[1:10:59] made the gun an inch at 25 yards 25
[1:11:02] yards is here to that wall over
[1:11:05] there um an inch and I drove nine
[1:11:09] straight holes at 50 yards so now here's
[1:11:12] my thought my wife said now look Bill
[1:11:14] she said if the company that made the
[1:11:16] rifle will say that it won't do no
[1:11:18] better than that then who are you to say
[1:11:20] that I said honey but here it is what it
[1:11:22] is I don't care what the company said
[1:11:23] I've seen it do it and I know way
[1:11:25] that'll do it and I sat down there when
[1:11:28] the other Brethren so now notice now
[1:11:29] immediately now he's going somewhere
[1:11:31] where he's out shooting the old
[1:11:32] squirrels okay and he says and I sat
[1:11:34] down there when the other Brethren were
[1:11:36] shooting at squirrels anywhere they
[1:11:37] wanted to hit them was all right mid
[1:11:39] Center back or whatever I sat under a
[1:11:41] tree and I was crying I said God I'm so
[1:11:44] nervous I can't hold myself together why
[1:11:47] did you make me a little nervous fellow
[1:11:49] like this and I realized I'm standing
[1:11:52] here the Bible before me and a voice
[1:11:53] just as plain as you would hear my said
[1:11:55] you were made thus for a
[1:11:58] purpose
[1:12:02] now this this picture here this is what
[1:12:06] it took to get brother Bram to where the
[1:12:10] Lord could use him this is what it took
[1:12:13] for him to be so nervous to do anything
[1:12:18] wrong yeah you know to get something
[1:12:20] wrong all these complexes that you know
[1:12:23] things that he had to go through to be
[1:12:24] molded and shaped into what God saw
[1:12:27] before the foundation of the world in
[1:12:29] order for him to bring the word to be
[1:12:32] able to take the sword of the word and
[1:12:34] to carry it his character had to be so
[1:12:37] shaped he was entrusted with the message
[1:12:41] amen so now remember just as we step
[1:12:44] along these Stepping Stones remember
[1:12:46] we've looked at Adam and Eve we've
[1:12:48] looked at the Lord Jesus and the bride
[1:12:49] we've looked at all these things we
[1:12:50] looked at the complexes we looked at
[1:12:51] predestination of the of the uh each one
[1:12:55] of you sitting here and we looked at
[1:12:57] brother bam how he's been shaped and
[1:13:00] molded and entrusted with the greatest
[1:13:03] Revelation
[1:13:05] ever right so nervous it had to be right
[1:13:11] okay and when he couldn't just do
[1:13:12] something in the natural that he knew
[1:13:14] was right that he could do he just B
[1:13:17] broke down in tears why am I like this
[1:13:20] why look the message that the Lord's
[1:13:23] given us through the prophet it's his
[1:13:25] word it's himself amen John 1 in the
[1:13:29] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:13:31] God the word was and but that's been
[1:13:32] handed down into hands of men entrusted
[1:13:36] with the
[1:13:38] word brother says things that are to be
[1:13:41] 1965 I believe that's the same thing we
[1:13:43] live today God bearing record of his
[1:13:45] word by vindicating what he said he
[1:13:47] would do now we know that this is the
[1:13:50] day of salvation where God is calling
[1:13:53] men from around the world from a life of
[1:13:56] sin unto a life of service am so God is
[1:13:59] calling men he's not talking about
[1:14:02] himself only now men around the world
[1:14:04] from a life of sin into a life of
[1:14:06] service and in that day God poured out
[1:14:09] his Spirit from on high great signs and
[1:14:10] wonders to to accompany the ministry of
[1:14:12] this day this is when the former and
[1:14:14] latter Reign are falling together we
[1:14:16] know that there is supposed to be great
[1:14:17] signs and wonders in which many gr
[1:14:19] denominations great denominations this
[1:14:21] is turned down listen carefully now he
[1:14:24] says but I'm very thankful for these
[1:14:25] open doors that I've had to go into and
[1:14:28] the inspiration it's give to young men
[1:14:31] like your pastor here that's cause them
[1:14:34] as I'm beginning to get old to know that
[1:14:36] my days are numbered and to know that
[1:14:39] these young men can take this message
[1:14:42] and sweep it on to the coming of the
[1:14:44] Lord if he doesn't come in my generation
[1:14:46] which I'm hoping to see him and I look
[1:14:47] daily for him watch I'm keeping myself
[1:14:51] prepared for that hour so
[1:14:56] this same message has been passed On to
[1:15:00] the Next Generation the same
[1:15:03] message okay now I've got a question is
[1:15:06] it the same
[1:15:07] sword of the word that was put into the
[1:15:11] hand on Sabino Canyon or is it another
[1:15:15] sword is it the same word that was
[1:15:18] preached in through the seals and all
[1:15:20] the way through or is it another one
[1:15:23] listen it's the same word it's the same
[1:15:25] sword we all kind of sit there and like
[1:15:28] wow when when we think about like like
[1:15:31] and I say that respectfully absolute all
[1:15:34] like you know saino cany the sword
[1:15:36] coming down wo whoa whoo the same
[1:15:38] sword's been put in your
[1:15:41] hands the same sword it's not another
[1:15:44] sword we always can't look it's human
[1:15:46] nature we always kind of look to
[1:15:48] somebody else as a role model and to
[1:15:50] look to but actually the role model that
[1:15:52] we're looking to as it were have been
[1:15:54] looking to in the flesh is saying listen
[1:15:56] now it's your turn yeah now it's your
[1:15:59] turn it's the same sword it's the same
[1:16:00] message yeah it's being passed on down
[1:16:03] and I'm telling you listen think of this
[1:16:06] it takes the same amount of reverence
[1:16:09] and sincerity yes for to stand here as
[1:16:14] it did for brother BR am think about it
[1:16:17] the Lord said to brother man you've got
[1:16:18] to be more sincere for
[1:16:21] this what have you seen the life that
[1:16:24] brother B lived have you seeing the life
[1:16:27] that he lived and he had to be more
[1:16:31] sincere well has the revelation of the
[1:16:33] word backed off since
[1:16:35] then so the level of
[1:16:38] sincerity has that backed off no n I
[1:16:41] tell you this is it's it's it's serious
[1:16:44] no wonder no wonder you get nervous you

[1:19:47] it then why don't we live the
[1:19:51] life because you are the word of God
[1:19:53] expressed yeah see on one hand we we've
[1:19:57] got such respect for this that we would
[1:20:00] never misrepresent or misquote this and
[1:20:03] yet he's saying that this is
[1:20:05] you so we've got to be so careful that
[1:20:08] day by day every day that we live if no
[1:20:11] one's watching you and you're going down
[1:20:12] the 75 home and you know you're doing 80
[1:20:14] when you're supposed to do 70 he's
[1:20:16] watching you someone's watching you
[1:20:18] somewhere what is it this level of
[1:20:21] responsibility it's this sincerity that
[1:20:23] we have to come to
[1:20:25] you would not misrepresent the
[1:20:27] scriptures don't misrepresent your life
[1:20:31] because your life is the scripture am
[1:20:33] you are the written Epistles of God read
[1:20:36] of all men come
[1:20:40] on you have been chosen to display this
[1:20:44] message and everything around the
[1:20:47] message to the
[1:20:48] world you listen you've been chosen
[1:20:52] before the foundation of the world to
[1:20:54] hold the sword of the Lord am think of
[1:20:57] it the word and he shaped us just like
[1:21:00] he shaped brother mam he shaped each one
[1:21:02] of us in such a way that we are so we
[1:21:05] feel we are just so it seems like we're
[1:21:08] battered you know at the end of the day
[1:21:11] me Old Nana me Nana used to love cooking
[1:21:14] jam tarts for me they were the best but
[1:21:17] you know when she'd been making the old
[1:21:18] dough to get it into shape she give it a
[1:21:20] good slapping you know what I mean if
[1:21:22] you want to get it into shape you've got
[1:21:24] to give it a slap you know what I mean
[1:21:27] and that's kind of how it is we've been
[1:21:28] shaped we aren't just here like that
[1:21:31] we've been shap not only by our parents
[1:21:34] we've been shaped by all those
[1:21:36] Generations back everything so listen we
[1:21:39] have to listen carefully we have to
[1:21:41] manifest God so perfectly to the full
[1:21:45] capacity in this day that you have got
[1:21:47] to be shaped to
[1:21:50] Perfection Perfection does not mean we
[1:21:52] look like some kind of sweet guy yeah on
[1:21:55] the outside Perfection means your
[1:21:57] character
[1:21:59] mate the Lord's chosen us as his vessel
[1:22:03] to carry on his work let's read it
[1:22:06] that's is just this this is just
[1:22:07] mind-blowing I know I think brother Chad
[1:22:09] read this a while like shortly P paman
[1:22:11] Church
[1:22:13] age um notice the harmony of the Father
[1:22:16] and Son never just never did Jesus Jesus
[1:22:18] never did anything until it was first
[1:22:20] shown him by the
[1:22:22] father should it be any different for us
[1:22:25] hey should it be any different for us
[1:22:27] amen come on come on that doesn't mean
[1:22:30] you got to see the writing on the wall
[1:22:32] yeah that mean we all know the word we
[1:22:34] all know how we're supposed to live and
[1:22:36] so if you go out in the
[1:22:39] morning look if you go out in the
[1:22:42] morning and you walk past the mirror and
[1:22:45] you put some color on your face the
[1:22:46] sisters or the men you wear some
[1:22:48] trousers that are a little bit too tight
[1:22:51] you know you're doing wrong amen listen
[1:22:53] carefully you know it's it's really nice
[1:22:55] thought oh it doesn't matter look maybe
[1:22:59] somebody who's kind of a bit wavery a
[1:23:02] bit shaky in the
[1:23:04] faith and maybe a young one maybe the
[1:23:07] they want to be popular so they put on
[1:23:09] some tight pants the
[1:23:11] boys or maybe the girls put a little bit
[1:23:13] of paint on listen carefully see that
[1:23:16] picture over there amen if I would take
[1:23:20] a pen right now and I say this just
[1:23:22] respectfully right if I would take a pen
[1:23:26] and start to put some coloring on that
[1:23:28] picture yeah I would be carried out of
[1:23:32] here in a
[1:23:33] bag listen carefully yeah by the same
[1:23:37] people that are shaky in their faith
[1:23:40] because that's why we're here today
[1:23:42] we're shaky in our faith right but
[1:23:45] you're not shaky in this you love the
[1:23:47] Lord that's why you're
[1:23:48] here you see what I mean yeah you've got
[1:23:51] such respect for the word of God you've
[1:23:54] got such respect for for for a picture
[1:23:56] of the Lord Jesus right and so would I
[1:23:59] you break your
[1:24:01] legs so why is it that we can feel that
[1:24:04] we can put some stuff on our
[1:24:06] face when it's this
[1:24:10] one come on listen I'm showing you you
[1:24:13] are him you are the female part of him
[1:24:16] if I would go and just add a little bit
[1:24:18] to that picture you'd kill me how does
[1:24:20] he feel about you come on how would you
[1:24:24] feel if I took that picture and
[1:24:25] Photoshop it I think they called and put
[1:24:27] some tight pants on come on put a shirt
[1:24:30] like like one of these jackets that they
[1:24:31] wear nowadays it's so tight it comes
[1:24:33] after at the back come on how would you
[1:24:35] feel that's showing disrespect what
[1:24:38] about you you are the Temple of the Holy
[1:24:40] Ghost you are God's Dwelling Place you
[1:24:42] are God expressed come
[1:24:44] on come on you know you are his chosen
[1:24:49] vessel to live through amen I'm not
[1:24:51] being nasty I'm not trying to like put
[1:24:53] you down try to lift you up and say look
[1:24:55] at your position come on look
[1:24:59] up I didn't finish this pamine church
[1:25:01] age Pam in church age notice the Father
[1:25:04] the the the harmony of the father and
[1:25:05] the son Jesus never did anything until
[1:25:08] it was first shown him of the Father
[1:25:10] John 5:19 the harmony now exists between
[1:25:13] the groom and his bride that's it this
[1:25:16] same Harmony listen you don't do nothing
[1:25:19] until the Lord shows you we need to
[1:25:21] listen to that Small Voice you know Al
[1:25:24] Bet you know you the Lord Jesus when he
[1:25:27] hears from the father it wasn't like a
[1:25:30] ding ding ding ding ding
[1:25:33] oh you know uh go to this place pray for
[1:25:36] this person D no it wasn't it's quiet
[1:25:38] voice quiet Small Voice just get up walk
[1:25:40] away do something just get up walk away
[1:25:42] do something we're the same for us we
[1:25:44] don't hear the big voice we need to
[1:25:45] listen to that Small Voice on the side
[1:25:48] so the harmony now exists between the
[1:25:51] groom and his bride to show her his Word
[1:25:54] of Life she receives it she never doubts
[1:25:57] it therefore nothing can harm her not
[1:25:59] even death for it's the same seed be
[1:26:01] planted the water will raise it up again
[1:26:03] pardon me here is the secret of this the
[1:26:06] word is in the bride as it was in Mary
[1:26:09] the bride has the mind of Christ for she
[1:26:12] knows what he wants done with the
[1:26:15] word she performs the command of the
[1:26:18] word in his name for she has the sayith
[1:26:21] of the Lord listen
[1:26:24] if
[1:26:26] look if this is uh how do I do this I
[1:26:30] got all these things here right here we
[1:26:31] go this is uh brother brother uh brother
[1:26:34] Ben seabolt this is
[1:26:37] Ben now for him in order for him okay to
[1:26:44] speak
[1:26:46] okay it has to be if he says anything
[1:26:49] it's Theus sayith Ben say something Ben
[1:26:52] something something there you are he
[1:26:54] just said something now I can now quote
[1:26:58] Ben and say thus saith Ben something see
[1:27:03] what I mean because it's Ben that said
[1:27:05] it yeah so if it was the Lord that said
[1:27:09] it if it's thus saith the
[1:27:12] Lord then it has to be
[1:27:16] him if it's not him it's not Theus
[1:27:18] sayith the Lord is
[1:27:20] it so actually when this one here now
[1:27:25] speaks when this one speaks it's thus
[1:27:29] saith the Lord now notice here brother
[1:27:32] Ram
[1:27:34] says she has she performs the command of
[1:27:37] the word in his name for she has listen
[1:27:40] carefully listen listen don't miss this
[1:27:42] and it's a shame we haven't got it up
[1:27:43] here so you can see it listen she
[1:27:45] performs the command of his of he of the
[1:27:48] word in his name for she has thus sayith
[1:27:51] the Lord she commands she every word
[1:27:55] that she speaks is in his name I'm not
[1:27:57] sure if I've said it before but um
[1:27:59] brother John brother um Chuck and sister
[1:28:01] Colleen she does without her knowing
[1:28:03] anything she does everything in brother
[1:28:06] Chuck's name what's your second name
[1:28:08] Chuck what's your second name Frei
[1:28:11] Frederick is that your second name no no
[1:28:12] no your
[1:28:13] surname huh Williams sweet so without
[1:28:18] knowing it she does every listen she
[1:28:21] wakes up in the morning and she makes a
[1:28:22] coffee in his name MH yes she's taken
[1:28:26] his name amen she does everything in
[1:28:28] when did we take his name we never took
[1:28:31] his name we always had
[1:28:32] it we were in him back then although not
[1:28:36] yet manifested it's the same thing so
[1:28:39] now this is what's talking about the
[1:28:40] bride of Christ she has the mind of
[1:28:42] Christ so she knows what he wants done
[1:28:44] with the word she performs the command
[1:28:46] of the word in his name she can't help
[1:28:48] it for she has thus saith the Lord eight
[1:28:53] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:28:55] and it comes to pass like the seed that
[1:28:57] is planted and watered it comes to full
[1:28:59] Harvest serving its purpose listen if
[1:29:02] we're living right okay the words that
[1:29:04] you speak will not come back void it's
[1:29:07] him speaking it's him speaking you if
[1:29:10] she has the sayth the Lord the only way
[1:29:12] that she can have the sayth the Lord is
[1:29:14] if yeah she is him amen it's if if he
[1:29:18] speaks through her that's the only way
[1:29:20] that is physically the only way I mean
[1:29:22] am I am I stupid or something brother
[1:29:23] brother I can quote now for the rest of
[1:29:25] my life brother thus saith brother Ben
[1:29:27] seol something that's absolutely the
[1:29:30] truth he can only speak it whatever he
[1:29:33] speaks is thus sayth then and whatever
[1:29:35] she speaks now because of this kind of
[1:29:37] revelation of the mystery that's been
[1:29:39] hid whatever we're saying and doing
[1:29:42] which is why it's so important that we
[1:29:43] live right is this thus sayith the Lord
[1:29:47] right continues he says those in the
[1:29:49] bride do only his will no one can make
[1:29:52] them do otherwise they have thus saith
[1:29:54] the Lord all they keep still they know
[1:29:57] that it has to be God in them doing the
[1:29:59] words fulfilling his own word mate
[1:30:02] fulfilling his own word
[1:30:05] ful fulfilling his own
[1:30:08] word okay mate this is he did not
[1:30:11] complete all his work while he in his
[1:30:13] Earthly Ministry and remember this is
[1:30:15] pick up his pen this is pick up your pen
[1:30:16] this is direct from this is actually
[1:30:18] this one who's telling brother Bram to
[1:30:20] write this down this one here this one
[1:30:23] here is saying listen listen Adam's like
[1:30:25] this you want to know what I look like
[1:30:26] this is Adam right yeah okay this is how
[1:30:29] I am I am this one this is Adam this is
[1:30:31] me you want to see what I look like look
[1:30:33] at Adam and now the same one is telling
[1:30:35] brother I'm tapping on his shoulder
[1:30:36] saying pick up your pen and write this
[1:30:37] cuz this is how it is this is how it is
[1:30:40] she has the sayith the Lord because it's
[1:30:42] me
[1:30:44] yeah fulfilling his own he not complete
[1:30:47] all his work while in his Earthly
[1:30:48] Ministry so now he works in and through
[1:30:51] the bride she knows that
[1:30:54] sister Colleen knows that when she goes
[1:30:57] shopping she's doing it in brother
[1:30:59] Chuck's name she do you know what she
[1:31:01] doesn't even think about it yeah she
[1:31:03] just does it she knows what to do with
[1:31:07] brother CH I hope brother Chuck's will
[1:31:10] she knows that he likes his choco
[1:31:12] pops I'm just saying do you know what I
[1:31:15] mean she
[1:31:17] knows the Lord's good right okay so he
[1:31:20] says uh didn't complete all his work
[1:31:21] while in his Earth Ministry so now he
[1:31:22] works in and through his bride she knows
[1:31:25] that for it was not yet time for him to
[1:31:28] do certain things that he must do now
[1:31:31] and now we see again just quickly this
[1:31:33] this this even though you were back here
[1:31:36] it wasn't yet time for you to be
[1:31:38] manifested it wasn't yet time there was
[1:31:42] a time when the attribute had to be
[1:31:43] manifested it had to come out there was
[1:31:45] a time and the time when the Lord Jesus
[1:31:47] was on his Earth it wasn't time to
[1:31:49] manifest himself in you back then it
[1:31:53] wasn't yet time but now he will fulfill
[1:31:57] through the bride the work which he left
[1:31:59] for this specific time it's crazy where
[1:32:04] is it that's mind-blowing we've been
[1:32:06] chosen to continue his work we've been
[1:32:09] chosen to complete his
[1:32:12] work you know we are we are
[1:32:16] predestinated to come to
[1:32:19] adoption you know we we're predestinated
[1:32:21] to to do his work and to to continue his
[1:32:24] ministry adoption means it's like at
[1:32:27] some point I'm trying to pick on
[1:32:29] somebody else now and I'm running out of
[1:32:30] options here it's like it's like uh
[1:32:32] don't don't smile at me brother that's
[1:32:33] it you're up that's it Justin so so uh
[1:32:38] Carter at some point Carter is going to
[1:32:41] be such a big fellow right that brother
[1:32:45] Justin is going to trust him so much
[1:32:48] then he says son take my ring you know
[1:32:51] what I me take my ring there's my cloak
[1:32:55] whatever you say in this in in in our
[1:32:58] situation our family life whatever you
[1:33:00] say it's going to be as good as me
[1:33:02] saying it that's adoption amen so you
[1:33:05] can see the weight of responsibility is
[1:33:08] huge but we are predestinated to come to
[1:33:12] that point sometimes you might be
[1:33:13] sitting there thinking Lord I'm never
[1:33:14] going to get there but just wait he will
[1:33:16] bring you to that point because we are
[1:33:19] predestination to get there the SAT has
[1:33:22] been set when back
[1:33:26] then we are here to do his work am and
[1:33:30] we know we are here we're predestinated
[1:33:33] to know what he wants done with his word
[1:33:36] amen let's turn to John the book of Book
[1:33:38] of John
[1:33:40] 20 John chapter
[1:33:43] 20 and as we read this just remember
[1:33:46] this quote that we've
[1:33:47] read from Brother bham talking about the
[1:33:50] position of the Bride the responsibility
[1:33:53] of the Bride how she's got thus say
[1:33:55] listen
[1:33:56] carefully she has thus sayith the Lord
[1:33:59] I'll just read this before we read this
[1:34:01] scripture I'm just going to read this
[1:34:02] quick because I we we made pauses in
[1:34:03] between those in the bride do only his
[1:34:05] will no one can make them do otherwise
[1:34:07] for they have thus sayith the Lord all
[1:34:09] they keep still they know that that it
[1:34:11] has to be God in them doing the works
[1:34:13] fulfilling his own word he did not
[1:34:15] complete all his work while his Earth
[1:34:16] ministri so now he works in and through
[1:34:17] the bride she knows that for it was not
[1:34:19] yet time for him to do certain things
[1:34:20] that he must do now but he will now
[1:34:22] fulfill through the bride that work work
[1:34:23] which you left for this specific time
[1:34:25] now we're going to read this John 20
[1:34:28] 19-23
[1:34:31] 19-23 and the Lord Jesus uh speaking
[1:34:35] here then the same evening being the
[1:34:38] first day of the week when the doors
[1:34:40] were shut where the disciples had
[1:34:42] assembled for fear of the Jews came
[1:34:44] Jesus and stood in the midst and said
[1:34:46] unto them peace unto you and when he had
[1:34:49] said this he showed unto them his hands
[1:34:51] and he said then were the deciples glad
[1:34:54] when they saw the Lord now just pause
[1:34:56] here one
[1:34:57] second I want to see I want you to just
[1:34:59] quickly see I'm just I'm just I'm just
[1:35:01] on this is on the fly so just just just
[1:35:03] see this this this spiritual type here
[1:35:06] of of when you uh receive when you
[1:35:08] realize who the Lord Jesus is when you
[1:35:11] get to this point so suddenly now we get
[1:35:13] to this Revelation seeing the revelation
[1:35:16] of Jesus Christ we
[1:35:17] see our position we see the wedding ring
[1:35:20] we see what it means we see this picture
[1:35:23] we see all this so now the Lord Jesus
[1:35:25] reveals himself he shows them the hands
[1:35:27] they realize now who it is what's the
[1:35:30] first thing he does let's read it now
[1:35:32] what does he say then Jesus said to them
[1:35:34] peace unto you as my father sent me even
[1:35:37] so I send
[1:35:40] you then said the uh and and then and
[1:35:43] when he had said this he said unto them
[1:35:44] receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins
[1:35:47] ye
[1:35:48] remit they are remitted unto them and
[1:35:51] whosoever sins you retain they are are
[1:35:53] retained that's a crazy
[1:35:56] scripture that's the Lord saying that's
[1:35:59] crazy that's like what Brian whatever
[1:36:02] you say and listen when the Lord said it
[1:36:04] here he said it to you personally bro he
[1:36:07] said to you if you forgive someone's
[1:36:09] sins here I can in no way remember them
[1:36:14] at the white Throne judgment because
[1:36:15] you've already remitted it and if
[1:36:17] someone does something to you Josiah
[1:36:20] someone upsets you if you don't forgive
[1:36:23] them
[1:36:24] you don't know how bad it is for them at
[1:36:26] the white Throne judgment this is the
[1:36:28] responsibility put lives in your hands
[1:36:31] this is the Lord Jesus this is exactly
[1:36:33] what we've just read in this quote yeah
[1:36:35] she's got thus sayth the Lord listen our
[1:36:38] Eternal purpose Eternal words can you
[1:36:41] imagine so the Lord as soon as we gain
[1:36:44] this adoption as it were as soon as we
[1:36:47] realize who we are our position as soon
[1:36:50] as we see the hands the nail prints of
[1:36:52] the Lord and we realize and we we have
[1:36:53] this revelation of Jesus Christ and and
[1:36:56] we're all just so happy immediately he
[1:36:58] puts the ring on his finger and
[1:37:00] Meanwhile we're thinking well praise the
[1:37:01] Lord I'm a king meanwhile that means hey
[1:37:04] look at this responsibility you've got
[1:37:07] lives on your hands how many times like
[1:37:09] brother Ben you know preaching U on the
[1:37:11] pride of life and stuff you look back on
[1:37:13] your life and all the things you've done
[1:37:14] wrong yeah but I look back on my life
[1:37:16] and I think all I tell you back in the

[1:38:28] about different things you talk about if
[1:38:30] you you know stick some paint on your
[1:38:32] face and it's a good example if you put
[1:38:34] it on there on the picture of the Lord
[1:38:35] Jesus you would be pretty upset but you
[1:38:37] do it to yourself and and you the things
[1:38:40] that we just say all these little
[1:38:41] examples yeah but if you would say if
[1:38:44] you would have somebody sitting here on
[1:38:45] a chair right now and you know either
[1:38:49] experience he gets to experience that
[1:38:51] what brother Ram experienc falling
[1:38:52] twisting falling in Hell Fire and you
[1:38:55] know when brother B was a child and he's
[1:38:57] going to fall like that forever and then
[1:38:59] he's going to be the white Throne
[1:39:00] judgment in bloody rags and then he's
[1:39:02] going to be sent to the Lake of Fire and
[1:39:03] so on so forth and you're sitting here

[1:39:06] him and he's crying his eyes out right
[1:39:08] oh you say look if you just forgive him
[1:39:10] then immediately that's gone and he'll
[1:39:12] just stand on and doesn't mean he goes
[1:39:14] to heaven or his bride but then he will
[1:39:16] just stand on whatever he does from you
[1:39:17] know if you had that chance IM me
[1:39:19] there's no question you yep forgive him
[1:39:21] forgive him in a heart
[1:39:23] amen but what about the person that you
[1:39:26] kind of like pushed in front of the
[1:39:28] supermarket
[1:39:29] yesterday do you know what I mean it's
[1:39:31] true because that person if you paint on
[1:39:35] the Lord jesus' face then you know on a
[1:39:37] picture of the Lord that not good that
[1:39:39] not good but if you curse the Lord
[1:39:43] that's not good yeah but remember this
[1:39:46] one so if you curse the bride you curse
[1:39:49] him the Lord Jesus says unto one of
[1:39:52] these little ones yeah of man if you
[1:39:54] offend one of these little ones it's
[1:39:56] better for you to be hanged about your
[1:39:58] neck and ched into the DPC who's been on
[1:40:00] a big before yeah I don't like
[1:40:02] water I can't swim that good and the
[1:40:05] cold I don't like it it's dark and
[1:40:07] horrible you know imagine being it's
[1:40:09] better for him to be thrown into the sea
[1:40:11] than to offend little Amanda sitting
[1:40:14] there yeah just to offend because she's
[1:40:17] so important she's a part of him so now
[1:40:21] we realize now so now it sounds Petty
[1:40:23] it's not this is the sincerity the level
[1:40:26] of sincerity that the Lord says you've
[1:40:27] got to be more serious you've got to be
[1:40:30] more sincere we've got to truly like
[1:40:33] just live that life you know what you it
[1:40:35] sounds D but brother Gabe I heard
[1:40:38] brother Gabe uh last was it last week
[1:40:40] week before the gab preached one thing
[1:40:42] that he said he stood out and you
[1:40:43] probably maybe some guys are sitting
[1:40:45] there thinking oh whatever but he said
[1:40:47] something about like tipping in a
[1:40:50] restaurant and I tell you that's that's
[1:40:52] affected me
[1:40:54] because I think how do they if I was
[1:40:56] talking to Brother John about it this
[1:40:57] morning I it brother John I was talking
[1:40:59] to somebody about it
[1:41:01] somebody it's like how does how that
[1:41:03] affects me it's like yeah Lord you know
[1:41:06] yeah it was brother John it's like it's
[1:41:07] like you know I just give him that tip I
[1:41:09] mean I haven't got that much money but
[1:41:10] you know what I mean I'd rather if if
[1:41:11] they would just like oh man again it's
[1:41:14] like whoa whoa whoa you've just said him
[1:41:17] again to the Lord see what I mean it's
[1:41:20] this to fulfill our everybody wants to
[1:41:23] be you know I said it again everyone
[1:41:25] wants to be the queen but no one wants
[1:41:26] to bake the the King's favorite cake you
[1:41:28] know everyone wants to keep you know
[1:41:29] just oh let somebody else do it no no no
[1:41:31] you are carrying the message you are a
[1:41:33] written Epistle of God you've got the
[1:41:35] weight of responsibility to live the
[1:41:36] life read of all men you you amen each
[1:41:40] one of us so now in that situation you
[1:41:42] know so went to the old Hunan yesterday
[1:41:43] and and and I had heard from somebody
[1:41:45] mentioned no names that she could be a
[1:41:46] little bit grumpy and and I thought Lord
[1:41:49] you know so she was nice she was nice
[1:41:50] mood yesterday I thought Lord I better
[1:41:51] just keep it that way and I give her
[1:41:53] trip you know what I mean thought Lord
[1:41:55] you don't want people to curse you yeah
[1:41:57] you me realize who we are it sounds
[1:42:00] Petty it's not Petty it's real it's this
[1:42:03] grave to use that word it's good word
[1:42:05] the grave realization of who we are amen
[1:42:10] amen you know what we read here is fits
[1:42:14] in perfectly with pick up your pen what
[1:42:16] the Lord Jesus writes she has
[1:42:20] got the she's got the Lord's will in her
[1:42:23] hands she's doing his will and that's
[1:42:25] why she does nothing but when he leads
[1:42:28] her to it we've got to listen to that
[1:42:29] Small Voice okay so we are this vessel
[1:42:33] which the Lord comes through so that he
[1:42:35] can now manifest himself as bride when
[1:42:38] the Lord was here he also wouldn't allow
[1:42:41] people to curse him behind his back if
[1:42:43] he could help it I mean sometimes you
[1:42:45] know I mean there was a lot of Jesus
[1:42:46] sometimes he just laid it down to the
[1:42:47] old Pharisees and I'm sure they didn't
[1:42:48] like him but do you I mean do you see
[1:42:50] what I mean we got to live that life of
[1:42:51] love and forgiveness
[1:42:53] we've got this predestinated position
[1:42:56] this calling that we've got and you know
[1:42:58] the calling this position this this High
[1:43:00] Calling that we have it's not just for
[1:43:02] in
[1:43:03] heaven it's not just for in heaven you
[1:43:05] know loads other PE people kind of think
[1:43:08] that the uh the calling that we have is
[1:43:10] just for when we're in heaven you know
[1:43:11] the the the kind of under the illusion
[1:43:13] that that well you know we're going to
[1:43:15] live here and just live well as good as
[1:43:17] we can you know
[1:43:19] and and then at some point it's going to
[1:43:22] be like his magic fairy just comes down
[1:43:23] and and we're just going to be changed
[1:43:25] and we're just going to be perfect it
[1:43:28] doesn't kind of work like that that's
[1:43:29] the whole point of the shaping and
[1:43:30] molding and making it's it we're
[1:43:33] supposed to be like Manana slapping the
[1:43:35] old pastry around to make it into the
[1:43:37] shape that she saw when when I said to
[1:43:39] her Nana can I have some Jam cake some
[1:43:42] some some tat she saw picture of me
[1:43:45] eating me Jam tat and so and so she
[1:43:48] slapped the old stuff around and made it
[1:43:50] into the shape and I love being H she
[1:43:52] was there
[1:43:53] and you know she she knew that so she
[1:43:56] saw that picture that she saw was
[1:43:59] manifested but it took a little bit of
[1:44:01] pushing around and making a molding and
[1:44:04] brother John and brother Bob and sister
[1:44:06] uh Susan you know in the uh in your
[1:44:09] restaurant back in the day you know the
[1:44:11] food didn't just make itself you had to
[1:44:13] make it and mold it and you your corn
[1:44:16] grits and all the stuff and I don't know
[1:44:18] the names of it you know what I'm
[1:44:20] talking about I haven't caught the
[1:44:21] Revelation but
[1:44:23] I'll get there it was it was I enjoyed
[1:44:25] it they invited us and I I never knew it
[1:44:27] was that good but he saw a picture of
[1:44:29] how it was and he had to make it and
[1:44:30] mold it to it's the same with us we use
[1:44:32] all these little examples and it seems
[1:44:34] silly but if we can just even for the
[1:44:35] young ones if we can just kind of
[1:44:37] understand a little bit how we are and
[1:44:39] what we are you know the Lord the Lord
[1:44:42] is showing us in this John 20 and 23
[1:44:46] that we have got this higher calling
[1:44:47] we've got a higher calling and we're
[1:44:49] written Epistles read of all men the
[1:44:51] scripture says us we have this we we are
[1:44:53] the word made flesh
[1:44:56] today you can't push it off on somebody
[1:44:58] else amen listen brother Ram was the
[1:45:00] prophet he lived the life he is the
[1:45:02] bride of Christ all those things that's
[1:45:05] not going to help you yeah you got to be
[1:45:09] yourself you've got to get there
[1:45:11] yourself you are individually you have
[1:45:13] to realize and have the Revelation that
[1:45:15] you were there personally alongside
[1:45:18] brother Brandon you were there alongside
[1:45:21] Paul and Peter and jam and John and
[1:45:24] there's more than one John cuz I'm
[1:45:25] looking at John I'm looking at John and
[1:45:27] I'm looking at John I'm looking at John
[1:45:28] there's John there's more than one
[1:45:30] they're all there in the in the in that
[1:45:32] we have to realize we got to
[1:45:34] see who we are and the fact that we are
[1:45:37] here our call is to manifest of the Lord
[1:45:40] Jesus Christ to the world the world will
[1:45:42] see Christ through you so we need to
[1:45:45] make sure that they're seeing the right
[1:45:46] picture yeah amen now whether you've
[1:45:49] been called to be a minister or a
[1:45:51] housewife or a grandmar grandpa or a
[1:45:54] school Kitty we are just as important as
[1:45:56] each other you know the sad thing is is
[1:45:58] that many many children they they kind
[1:46:00] of feel like like it's it's an adult
[1:46:03] thing it's you are just as important
[1:46:07] you're just as important you're just so
[1:46:10] important we can't describe you know the
[1:46:13] Lord Jesus would be
[1:46:15] incomplete if one member of his bride
[1:46:17] was missing if I listen it sounds D but
[1:46:20] if I would uh take a like a hair from
[1:46:23] from my from my head and put it on the
[1:46:25] floor in in theory I'm now incomplete
[1:46:27] you know what I mean right so if you
[1:46:29] take anything away hair is a little bit
[1:46:32] tricky but you know what I'm trying to
[1:46:33] say if you take a piece of my ear or
[1:46:34] something that I'm suddenly incomplete
[1:46:36] and when you look at me you'd be like
[1:46:38] well he's incomplete and the Lord Jesus
[1:46:40] without you each one of you here he's
[1:46:43] incomplete amen and that goes for the
[1:46:45] younger ones as well so the Young on
[1:46:47] don't ever think oh it's just me I'm I'm
[1:46:49] only small and it's this that
[1:46:51] no we are listen it doesn't matter how
[1:46:53] much oh well you know this one's got a
[1:46:55] bigger Revelation that one well some of
[1:46:57] these kides here have got more
[1:46:58] Revelation about working maths out than
[1:47:00] I have you know but we're all we're all
[1:47:02] part of the same body we are one body
[1:47:05] you know but we are just as important
[1:47:06] and we are vessels the Lord's got you
[1:47:08] see these vessels that he's using to
[1:47:10] manifest himself and to manifest the
[1:47:13] attributes of himself he's got them in
[1:47:14] schools he's got them on the police
[1:47:16] force he's got them in shops he's got
[1:47:18] them on the building site in the
[1:47:20] engineering shop he's got them
[1:47:21] everywhere these are all these these
[1:47:23] these vessels that the Lord is using his
[1:47:25] through his bride as we've read there
[1:47:27] the Lord's doing it through his bride
[1:47:28] and he's doing that so that he can reach
[1:47:31] all the world the world will be judged
[1:47:33] listen the bride will judge the world
[1:47:35] you don't even have to stand there and
[1:47:37] judge somebody if you get what I mean
[1:47:38] just your life alone you know why we've
[1:47:41] just seen you know we've seen brother
[1:47:43] Dave yeah and and uh uh brother Dave and
[1:47:48] brother Craig you know cutting hair
[1:47:49] there the the Westwood Barbers they've
[1:47:51] been living that life now how long's it
[1:47:52] been brother brother Craig 30 20 30 40
[1:47:54] years long time you've got 40 years
[1:47:58] worth of judging that you've done bro
[1:48:00] true right true why didn't you see that
[1:48:03] man living the life of God you've been
[1:48:06] there all those years you've driven past
[1:48:08] you've gone to that person in that shop
[1:48:10] you've done this you've done that your
[1:48:12] life alone you are the written epistle
[1:48:14] the Lord Brother R says that God will
[1:48:16] judge by his word and if you're the
[1:48:19] written Epistle of his word then you're
[1:48:21] also going to be a part of that
[1:48:23] see this weight of responsibility that
[1:48:25] we have the Lord's got in every possible
[1:48:27] situation he's he's got he's got he's
[1:48:29] got showing Christ in you the hope of
[1:48:32] glory your life there in Westwood
[1:48:34] Barbers and now brother Jeremy and Jack
[1:48:36] your life there is actually reflecting
[1:48:39] the hope of
[1:48:41] glory see when they see you they see
[1:48:44] something different they see the hope of
[1:48:46] glory they see a a way they see a road
[1:48:50] they see a street they see a physical
[1:48:52] call something that they can see the
[1:48:54] hope of glory Christ in you the hope of
[1:48:57] glory let's just turn a little corner if
[1:48:59] we can let's go to John
[1:49:01] 16 John chapter
[1:49:04] 16 John chapter 16 and we'll read
[1:49:11] 26-28 26-
[1:49:16] 28 so the Lord Jesus says at that day ye
[1:49:19] shall ask in my name now this is like
[1:49:22] back to brother colen sister Colleen and
[1:49:24] brother brother Chuck this is the same
[1:49:26] thing at that day um that day you shall
[1:49:29] ask in my name and I shall say not unto
[1:49:31] you that I will pray the father for you
[1:49:33] for the father himself loveth you
[1:49:35] because you have loved me and you have
[1:49:37] believed that I came out of God I came
[1:49:40] forth from the father and I am coming to
[1:49:43] the world again I leave the world and go
[1:49:46] to the
[1:49:48] father so notice now we've got this same
[1:49:51] story again there's
[1:49:53] Adam Adam I'm made him male and female
[1:49:56] here's Adam at the moment you can only
[1:49:58] see a man you can only see one but the
[1:50:00] female is in there and how you see Adam
[1:50:03] that's how I am that that's how I am you
[1:50:06] want to know how I am you look at Adam
[1:50:08] yeah but I can only see a man yeah it
[1:50:09] doesn't matter he she's in there you
[1:50:10] know cuz male and female created them so
[1:50:13] now we can show that the Lord Jesus is
[1:50:15] showing now I come from God and I go
[1:50:18] back to God what's this thing here where
[1:50:22] were you you come from God and you go
[1:50:25] back to God so when he's saying there's
[1:50:27] Adam look at Adam look at me he's also
[1:50:29] saying look this is me this is you I
[1:50:32] come from God the Father I come from the
[1:50:35] this this and I'm going back and this is
[1:50:37] what's with you it's the same story so
[1:50:39] although we can't remember it we too
[1:50:42] come back come from God and we will go
[1:50:44] back to God you know the bride we were
[1:50:49] born with um not knowing
[1:50:53] our identity we were born in a certain
[1:50:56] way that the Lord made us this there's
[1:50:58] this great big drama this play that's
[1:51:00] been playing out and and we've been made
[1:51:02] in such a way that we had
[1:51:05] Amnesia we we we were when we were born
[1:51:08] we didn't know our identity I've said
[1:51:10] look I've said this not here I've said
[1:51:12] it before it's like you know when you're
[1:51:14] born who's got to I'm going to pick on
[1:51:17] Blake Blake's got a little um oh my my
[1:51:21] mind's just
[1:51:23] Henry Blake's got little Henry so Henry
[1:51:27] knows that he's his dad now but when
[1:51:29] Blake was first had Henry he didn't
[1:51:33] know that Blake was his father now
[1:51:36] brother B talks about the sweet spirit
[1:51:37] being around the mother okay but
[1:51:40] actually if just just try to look at the
[1:51:43] little type I'm trying to bring Henry
[1:51:45] didn't truly know that Blake was his
[1:51:48] father and then he spends time with him
[1:51:51] and now he feels this love that Blake's
[1:51:53] got towards
[1:51:54] Henry and he kind of yeah that's that's
[1:51:58] my dad and he teaches him daddy daddy
[1:52:00] daddy you know and the Lord's teaching
[1:52:02] us you know say say son say bride oh
[1:52:05] bride bride you know we take these
[1:52:07] little teetering steps but but and just
[1:52:10] see the type I'm just I'm not tring be
[1:52:12] clever but now but little Henry he's
[1:52:14] still he he doesn't no 100% he can't lay
[1:52:18] his life on the fact that that Blake's
[1:52:21] his father he you know he he can't 100%
[1:52:25] he can't do you know what I'm trying to
[1:52:26] say but there comes a time when he gets
[1:52:30] more mature and this is why I say you
[1:52:32] got to read between the lines cuz now
[1:52:33] he's a
[1:52:34] teenager and he's getting sort of 15 16
[1:52:37] and he kind of he kind of Walks Like
[1:52:40] Blake and and and Blake's got this this
[1:52:42] thing where he sort of scratches his eye
[1:52:44] you know my um what's my my brother does
[1:52:46] something doesn't he my brother my
[1:52:48] brother does something brother my
[1:52:49] brother does something it's what my dad
[1:52:51] does and it's what my granddad does it's
[1:52:53] all the say I don't know it but my
[1:52:54] brother does it and my dad does it so
[1:52:56] now Blake he's got this way of twitching
[1:52:57] his eye and and and as as Henry is kind
[1:53:01] of walking he notices that he Twitches
[1:53:03] his eye he's like mate that's like my
[1:53:06] dad and then he looks in the mirror one
[1:53:09] time and and he starts to get these
[1:53:10] funny wrinkles that all the Lambs have
[1:53:11] got now I'm just saying that I don't
[1:53:13] know if you've got them so brother
[1:53:14] Chad's listening don't be offended it's
[1:53:16] just off the top of my head you get
[1:53:18] these like that lines across like your
[1:53:20] forehead like in a specific specific way
[1:53:23] and he looks and he's thinking
[1:53:26] wow this is and then suddenly this
[1:53:29] Revelation drops in his heart that's my
[1:53:32] origin I am manifesting all the
[1:53:35] attributes of my father and this is how
[1:53:38] it's been with us we've kind of like
[1:53:40] been pondering over these things and
[1:53:42] even the message has been out for so
[1:53:43] long now and pondering these things and
[1:53:45] pondering but there Comes A Time even
[1:53:47] though we kind of feel the love from the
[1:53:49] father and Henry feels the the the the
[1:53:52] love from brother Blake there comes a
[1:53:53] time when when actually the true
[1:53:55] Revelation drops in his heart the true
[1:53:58] Revelation drops in his heart and that's
[1:54:00] sort of where we are so we can't
[1:54:01] remember we were born with this Amnesia
[1:54:04] we can't remember this is listen I'm
[1:54:06] telling you this is we've looked through
[1:54:07] the scripture this is the sayth the Lord
[1:54:10] this is absolutely straight from the
[1:54:13] scriptures right but we were born not
[1:54:15] knowing this and we were kind of like
[1:54:18] stumbling around and we had absolutely
[1:54:21] no memory of it but it took the prophet
[1:54:24] to re bring this message and the message
[1:54:26] was to turn our hearts back am back to
[1:54:30] show us where we come from Back to the
[1:54:32] faith of the original see and it's
[1:54:35] taking this message to point us back
[1:54:37] just like the soldier my brother M talks
[1:54:40] about who had the Amnesia he'd come from
[1:54:43] somewhere he had came from somewhere he
[1:54:45] had an origin but he just couldn't
[1:54:47] remember where it was from and we're
[1:54:50] exactly the same we didn't we did not
[1:54:52] appear here just by chance we came from
[1:54:55] God we came from God and you know the
[1:54:58] message is showing us who we are where
[1:55:00] we are let's just read where brother
[1:55:02] Brown tells this story of the uh the
[1:55:05] soldier it's in' 64 and he's preaching
[1:55:07] spiritual
[1:55:08] Amnesia and brother says a French
[1:55:11] soldier I was told I was told this
[1:55:12] little story before we Clos I didn't
[1:55:14] know it was even that late I got about
[1:55:16] 10 pages of notes left here get some of
[1:55:18] time notice a French soldier they got a
[1:55:20] bunch of soldiers in from the Army and
[1:55:22] they had this Amnesia it shock on the
[1:55:25] battle and they had a program and they
[1:55:28] called up and let the people who had
[1:55:29] missing loved ones call to see if they
[1:55:31] could identify those boys no hope for
[1:55:33] them maybe one or two out of it C it and
[1:55:37] then the rest of them that was going to
[1:55:38] put them in a sanitarium where they'd
[1:55:40] have to stay the rest of their life I we
[1:55:43] can see nice spiritual type there you
[1:55:44] know for us we've recognized who we are
[1:55:48] but there's a lot of people that are in
[1:55:49] a sanitarium for the rest of their life
[1:55:51] they've got no hope for them brother
[1:55:52] says they was going up a hillside the
[1:55:54] train pulling they stopped at a station
[1:55:56] and they let the boys get out and
[1:55:57] stretch their legs and the guards got
[1:55:59] out on the hill to watch them because
[1:56:01] with amnesia why they had to watch them
[1:56:03] so they watched one young fellow there
[1:56:04] he got out and he began to look around
[1:56:06] at the water tank he looked all around
[1:56:08] over the hill he rubbed his face and he
[1:56:10] studed and he looked again and he seen
[1:56:13] the water tank and he looked all around
[1:56:14] at the station he started walking and
[1:56:17] instead of the Guard stopping him they
[1:56:18] followed him he went up over the hill
[1:56:21] down a little path turned to the right
[1:56:23] and went up another little Hill and he
[1:56:25] came to a log cabin and he looked and
[1:56:26] coming out on the porch an old man with
[1:56:29] a cane in his hand come out threw his
[1:56:31] arms around him he said my love my my
[1:56:33] son I knew you would return they told me
[1:56:36] you were dead but I knew you would
[1:56:37] return and the boy came to himself his
[1:56:40] Amnesia left him he could identify who
[1:56:42] he was he knew his father that's
[1:56:46] right you know it's taken the water
[1:56:49] tower of this message to point us back
[1:56:53] to bring us to remembrance who our
[1:56:55] father is not is was but is and it's
[1:57:00] taken this water tower to show us our
[1:57:03] identity to realize who we are the
[1:57:06] Lord's been holding the mirror of the
[1:57:07] word in front of us and our eyes were
[1:57:10] all matted up brother B calls it
[1:57:12] mattered yes it's your American language
[1:57:14] all matted up like you know and brother
[1:57:16] B tells about how early in the morning
[1:57:18] when it's cold his eyes would be all
[1:57:19] closed did anybody else experience that
[1:57:22] anybody in
[1:57:23] here anybody in here at all boom I'm not
[1:57:27] alone cuz I tell you I had it all the
[1:57:29] time when I was a kid seriously cuz like
[1:57:31] you know we had we had no Heating in the
[1:57:34] house it was freezy I scratched the ice
[1:57:35] off the window in the morning to look
[1:57:37] out the window and my eyes would always
[1:57:39] be like glued together absolutely and I
[1:57:40] had to like rip them apart and like wash
[1:57:42] them out and that's so I know what
[1:57:44] that's like and so was talking about how
[1:57:47] how his eyes would all be matted up in
[1:57:49] the morning and but when I eyes were
[1:57:52] mattered up the Lord like brother Bram
[1:57:54] he he said oh his mom would give him the
[1:57:56] eyes have and I I didn't I didn't get
[1:58:00] that one I just have to go find my way
[1:58:01] to the bathroom and like look out my eye
[1:58:03] a little bit and like wash it out myself
[1:58:05] but you know if we've got the mirror in
[1:58:07] front of us and we can't see clearly
[1:58:10] because our eyes are mattered up then we
[1:58:11] kind of need some isav of the word to
[1:58:13] clear our eyes out and that's that's why
[1:58:15] brother tells that story he's telling
[1:58:16] that story to to show us that there is
[1:58:19] something that can open our eyes there
[1:58:21] is something listen you have to take
[1:58:24] something and put it on your eyes it
[1:58:26] doesn't just come from nothing we've got
[1:58:28] to take something and and then so then
[1:58:30] we can see clearly you know listen if
[1:58:32] you looking into the mirror and you
[1:58:34] can't see the mirror clearly listen guys
[1:58:36] the mirror has always been here the
[1:58:40] mirror was it's not like oh the mirror
[1:58:42] just can't The Mirror's always been here
[1:58:44] it's just that we couldn't see clearly
[1:58:47] our eyes were all like gunked up you
[1:58:49] know we always were a child of God we
[1:58:51] always were look at it we always were
[1:58:53] we've seen in the scriptures it's not
[1:58:54] some made up something we always were we
[1:58:56] just couldn't see
[1:59:00] clearly we need to see the reflection in
[1:59:02] the mirror the picture that God saw from
[1:59:05] before the foundation of the world
[1:59:06] that's the one we want to see clearly
[1:59:08] you know we we want to see that picture
[1:59:09] clearly because because if we see this
[1:59:11] picture then we want to bring ourselves
[1:59:13] in line with that picture you know we
[1:59:16] want to bring ourselves in brother R he
[1:59:17] sings a story he brings that story about
[1:59:19] the little boy in the mirror and you
[1:59:21] know why does he bring all these stories
[1:59:22] they're not here for a just for
[1:59:24] something they're here for a reason he's
[1:59:26] bringing these stories because because
[1:59:28] he's describing our situation you know
[1:59:31] we we've never we never saw ourselves
[1:59:33] until we climbed up those seven steps
[1:59:35] till we walked forward we've never seen
[1:59:36] it and the prophet the message he
[1:59:39] brought the isav to clear our eyes of
[1:59:41] our understanding and I like this
[1:59:43] because let's read Ephesians
[1:59:46] 1:18 Ephesians
[1:59:48] 1:8 we are living listen in the days
[1:59:51] when this scripture is fulfilled it's
[1:59:53] being fulfilled in these days Ephesians
[1:59:56] 1:18 it says the eyes of your
[1:59:59] understanding being enlightened that ye
[2:00:02] may know what is the hope of his calling
[2:00:04] what is the riches of the glory of his
[2:00:06] inheritance in the Saints it's awesome
[2:00:10] see in fact should have read verse 17 as
[2:00:13] well but it's fine see through the
[2:00:15] message the eyes of our understanding
[2:00:17] have been enlightened we we've been
[2:00:20] enlightened we've seen the water tower
[2:00:22] we we we we we kind of we we've
[2:00:24] recognized where we are and what's going
[2:00:26] on and the Amnesia has left us so we can
[2:00:28] now see the
[2:00:30] father like to read uh the invisible
[2:00:34] Union of the um invisible Union of the
[2:00:37] bride of
[2:00:38] Christ in 65 like my little legal story
[2:00:41] as you've all heard it the old an old
[2:00:43] farmer set a hen one time and he didn't
[2:00:46] have enough eggs to go under the H so he
[2:00:48] found an eagle egg they put it under him
[2:00:50] when the eagle was born it was the fun
[2:00:52] looking chicken them chickens have ever
[2:00:54] seen the little old Eagle going along on
[2:00:55] the head cluck cluck cluck the little e
[2:00:57] Eagle said I don't know what that thing
[2:01:00] sounds like but I'm following her anyhow
[2:01:01] and they went out into the Bard and
[2:01:03] begin to scratch manure piles she said
[2:01:05] cl cl cl this is good you join ours and
[2:01:07] this is what the little old Eagle he
[2:01:09] couldn't eat that stuff see he just went
[2:01:11] along with the chicken because he didn't
[2:01:13] know he didn't know what to do and then
[2:01:16] she went out there and she would get
[2:01:18] this or that and little Eagle he just
[2:01:20] had to stomach it but he did didn't know
[2:01:22] how to do it he'd seen all the chickens
[2:01:24] doing it but there was something
[2:01:25] different he didn't like that so one day
[2:01:28] the mother she knew she had to she laid
[2:01:30] two eggs she be to hunt for one uh for
[2:01:32] the after the other one and flying
[2:01:34] around searching like the great Holy
[2:01:35] Spirit one day he flew over the barard
[2:01:38] that denomination and she looked down
[2:01:39] there and seen this her little baby she
[2:01:41] screamed it was the voice that something
[2:01:44] echoed from inside him listen you know
[2:01:47] when you hear these things when you hear
[2:01:49] something just something inside you it's
[2:01:51] the water Tower something inside is just
[2:01:54] like mate that sounds right something
[2:01:56] you can't help it just something just
[2:01:58] like yeah that sounds right and
[2:02:00] sometimes we can't even understand why
[2:02:02] it's like but we don't understand it but
[2:02:04] we know it's right so he says his a
[2:02:07] voice of something echoed on the inside
[2:02:09] of him that sounds right like the real
[2:02:12] PR predestinated born German
[2:02:14] predestinated by God hear the word of
[2:02:17] God it's music to him he knows it's the
[2:02:19] truth he's tired of that denominational
[2:02:21] stuff anyhow join this come out go with
[2:02:23] us we've got a social party we've got
[2:02:24] this we've got that it didn't sound
[2:02:26] right to the little fellow she said Son
[2:02:28] you don't belong in that group anyhow
[2:02:29] you belong to me you're mine he said
[2:02:31] Mama that sounds real how am I going to
[2:02:34] get out said just make a jump I'll catch
[2:02:36] you that's all you have to do just skip
[2:02:39] down to the bottom here he says why it
[2:02:41] was put there by
[2:02:44] predestination you were for ordained you
[2:02:47] were for ordained to a Son of God you
[2:02:49] were in God before the foundation of the
[2:02:52] world you're only manifested in this day
[2:02:55] for his honor and Glory how can you do
[2:02:58] it without honoring his word and stand
[2:03:01] with every word of God yes sir which you
[2:03:03] are a part of that word by
[2:03:05] predestination because look God is the
[2:03:08] word you believe it congregation says
[2:03:10] amen well then he always was the word in
[2:03:13] the listen he just said there's Adam
[2:03:16] there's Eve there's me brother R's just
[2:03:18] saying here notice here he says he says
[2:03:20] look God is the word you believe it
[2:03:22] congregation say yes uh wa a minute he
[2:03:24] says so he says I'm going up a little
[2:03:25] bit forgive me he says yes sir which you
[2:03:28] are a part of that word by
[2:03:30] predestination there's Adam there's Eve
[2:03:34] inside you are a part of the word by
[2:03:36] predestination because look the God is
[2:03:39] the word you believe it well then if he
[2:03:42] he always was the word in the beginning
[2:03:45] was the word he's quoting John 1 and if
[2:03:47] the Word was God then you were in God
[2:03:51] the word the part that you were to play
[2:03:53] was in God before the foundation of the
[2:03:56] world he seen you he knew you he
[2:03:59] predestinated it to you that's just like
[2:04:02] C capping the whole thing off really for
[2:04:04] me that's stunning we always
[2:04:07] were you always were an eagle you were
[2:04:10] just in the old barard however barard it
[2:04:12] was whether it was uh whether it was a
[2:04:15] Methodist
[2:04:16] Baptist end of the day like nowadays you
[2:04:19] struggle to find people that have come
[2:04:20] out of Methodist Baptist Pentecostal
[2:04:22] let's be honest cuz like you know the
[2:04:23] generation's moved on now so only the
[2:04:25] older generation that's come out from
[2:04:27] Methodist Baptist you know what I'm you
[2:04:28] that it's like most of the people have
[2:04:29] been born in the message so whether
[2:04:31] you're born under a message in a message
[2:04:33] church that's had a Baptist Spirit on it
[2:04:35] or a Pentecostal Spirit on it just read
[2:04:36] between the lines you know but whatever
[2:04:38] it is you sick of that junk and you've
[2:04:40] come out because you're an
[2:04:43] eagle and when the great mother Eagle
[2:04:45] came and called us to come up higher
[2:04:48] something inside recognized the water
[2:04:50] tower you just knew it were right right
[2:04:52] and if somebody says come up higher and
[2:04:54] you feel that it's right something
[2:04:57] inside you says it's right what are you
[2:04:58] going to do you're going to go up higher
[2:05:00] you want to go up higher you've got that
[2:05:01] desire to go up higher so now we know
[2:05:04] we're not chickens we are designed to
[2:05:07] fly we are designed to see this word
[2:05:10] we're designed to that's a terrible
[2:05:11] Eagle that's that we we're designed to
[2:05:13] see the whole thing
[2:05:16] clearly we're designed to fly come up
[2:05:19] here come into the heavenlies where you
[2:05:21] belong
[2:05:22] we are not supposed to be sitting down
[2:05:25] just like bouncing around we're supposed
[2:05:27] to be climbing in Revelation higher and
[2:05:30] higher you know back in the
[2:05:32] barnyard this is Simon by the way back
[2:05:35] in the farmyard there was five wise and
[2:05:37] there was five
[2:05:38] foolish you know and when they were
[2:05:40] first born yeah they were funny he was a
[2:05:42] funny I'm just saying now there's five
[2:05:43] eagles not one read between the lines
[2:05:46] the eagle was the funniest looking thing
[2:05:47] in the barnyard but those the old five
[2:05:49] wise five foolish but if you would put
[2:05:52] five five eaglets and five chickens in
[2:05:54] in in a barnyard together you know in
[2:05:57] the beginning as they're growing up
[2:06:00] together in the same church right
[2:06:04] they've they've all got feathers yeah
[2:06:07] they've all got little feet that have
[2:06:09] Got Claws Johanna knows a lot about the
[2:06:11] old chickens it's like they've all got
[2:06:14] beaks all of them the Eagles and the
[2:06:17] chickens yeah but the difference is is
[2:06:20] that when the Midnight Cry goes out and
[2:06:21] it's come up hither come up higher only
[2:06:24] the Eagle's got something in it that can
[2:06:26] fly because the old chicken is not in it
[2:06:28] to fly in fact he funny cuz brother
[2:06:31] John's got a few little chickens out
[2:06:32] those pullets he's got and the think
[2:06:34] they're Eagles it's like check me out I
[2:06:36] can fly and they're like flying up and
[2:06:38] smacking the fence they ain't made to
[2:06:41] fly but the eagle if he was there he'd
[2:06:44] just pop up and he'd fly see you are
[2:06:47] born to fly just set you've heard that
[2:06:49] cry set your wings to The Winds of Faith
[2:06:52] you've been born to fly and only the
[2:06:55] eagle only the predestinated Eagles in
[2:06:58] the old Barnyard could fly only them
[2:07:01] tell you you are an eagle you're born to
[2:07:03] fly we are a predestinated bride and we
[2:07:07] predestinate to fulfill what was in all
[2:07:10] the attributes that were in the mind of
[2:07:12] God from before the foundation of the
[2:07:14] world the lord is

[2:08:40] forgiven it's like yeah and it's not
[2:08:42] this like wow it's like a Lord help me
[2:08:45] to do the right thing help me Lord you
[2:08:48] know we want to be placed into that
[2:08:50] Kingdom Romans 8:28 and 29 let's read
[2:08:53] that Romans 8:28 29 I haven't even
[2:08:57] looked at a clock I don't have a clock
[2:08:58] up here but I don't want to be too long
[2:09:01] I cut I had to cut every like half out
[2:09:04] so we we're all good all is well Romans
[2:09:10] 8:28 and
[2:09:12] 29 says and we know that and I think
[2:09:15] I've said this before but if you notice
[2:09:18] this is a this is a fridge magnet
[2:09:22] Romans
[2:09:22] 8:28 the first part of it is a fridge
[2:09:25] mnet because everybody wants to bake
[2:09:27] they like live the life but not bake the
[2:09:29] cake like everyone wants to quote the
[2:09:30] scripture but only half the scripture
[2:09:32] and we know that all things work
[2:09:33] together for them that love God full
[2:09:36] stop fridge
[2:09:38] magnet goes further than that it says to
[2:09:42] them who are the called according to his
[2:09:45] purpose what's his purpose you're the
[2:09:48] called right so what's his purpose amen
[2:09:51] the mystery of his purpose to reveal
[2:09:54] himself in you his purpose is that
[2:09:58] everything that was in here okay and
[2:10:00] we've only written a few things down
[2:10:02] here okay everything that was in here is
[2:10:05] manifested through his bride in the end
[2:10:07] time his character you know love
[2:10:09] patience uh longsuffering humility all
[2:10:12] these things these are the these the
[2:10:14] attributes of God where was I 28 to them
[2:10:18] who are the called according to his
[2:10:20] purpose for for whom and wait you know
[2:10:23] just just quickly it says there in verse
[2:10:25] 28 and we know that all things work
[2:10:27] together for good to them that believe
[2:10:29] believe God to them that are the called
[2:10:30] according to purpose listen we can say
[2:10:32] definitely that we know that all things
[2:10:34] work together for good to these guys we
[2:10:37] know we know because this is
[2:10:41] predestination this we know is this
[2:10:43] faith that we have in predestination we
[2:10:45] know that all things work together for
[2:10:46] good we know that all the trials that we
[2:10:48] go through and and all the difficult
[2:10:50] things we go through to shape our we
[2:10:51] know that it's fine because we are
[2:10:53] called according to his purpose and he
[2:10:55] wants to his purpose is that he
[2:10:57] manifests himself and finishes his work
[2:10:59] through us that we have that that that
[2:11:01] humility and that life that that that
[2:11:03] that character that's been shaped so
[2:11:04] much that he can manifest himself
[2:11:06] through his bride verse 29 for whom he
[2:11:09] did Forno he also did predestinate for
[2:11:13] no is this what we're talking about he
[2:11:14] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[2:11:18] the image of his son that he might be
[2:11:20] the first born among many Brethren
[2:11:23] listen friends we are predestinated to
[2:11:26] be
[2:11:27] conformed to His Image there's Adam
[2:11:31] there's Eve Eve was the image of the
[2:11:33] female image of Adam amen the bride is
[2:11:35] the female image of the Lord that's how
[2:11:38] it is so back we we the L we been
[2:11:40] predestined to be conformed back to this
[2:11:44] one the drama that we're playing in it's
[2:11:47] already been written this is the whole
[2:11:48] point of predestination this drama this
[2:11:50] play that we are in we are fulfilling
[2:11:54] this we are manifesting these although
[2:11:58] not yet manifested but now are being
[2:12:00] manifested the attributes that were in
[2:12:03] the Lord Jesus Christ to be manifested
[2:12:05] through his bride we're playing our role
[2:12:09] It's a drama that we're playing in and
[2:12:12] it's already planned out now don't
[2:12:13] forget for all of us here you know from
[2:12:17] the youngest to the
[2:12:18] oldest if we can just clean our eyes of
[2:12:22] the gunk the matter what you want to
[2:12:23] call it do you does everyone call it
[2:12:24] matter is that brother Brown language
[2:12:26] everyone is that what you call it yeah
[2:12:28] matter yeah every matter every you if we
[2:12:30] can just clean our eyes a little bit
[2:12:32] Yeah amen if we can just see ourselves
[2:12:35] clearly you know we've listen we've been
[2:12:37] seing through glass Darkly but now we're
[2:12:40] in this face to face stage now we we've
[2:12:43] come up to the point to the mirror where
[2:12:46] the Lord's wiped our eyes away and we
[2:12:48] were beginning to see clearly and
[2:12:51] could it be could it be I preached this
[2:12:53] sermon like a year or two back cuz I've
[2:12:57] been in the I've been in the build uh
[2:12:58] I've been on the phone to the Builder
[2:12:59] Merchant and there was someone and all I
[2:13:01] could I don't even I haven't even looked
[2:13:03] for the song I'm not interested but all
[2:13:04] I could hear was her like could it be
[2:13:08] could it
[2:13:09] be could it be could it be and she's
[2:13:12] obviously singing to the radio and this
[2:13:14] just thought she could it be could it be
[2:13:17] that's so true could it be so this is
[2:13:19] like we get to the mirror and we're
[2:13:20] looking and it's like
[2:13:21] like I'm wiping the mirror and it looks
[2:13:25] like that and I'm thinking could it be
[2:13:28] could it be could it be this Revelation
[2:13:32] could it be we're getting to this face
[2:13:34] to face the mystery of of of of the
[2:13:36] mirror is getting clearer and clearer
[2:13:39] and the Mystery of our purpose what he's
[2:13:42] purposed in us you know we always were
[2:13:45] sons of God we always were but in the
[2:13:47] great theater role play thing that we're
[2:13:50] playing out here you know the part of
[2:13:52] the
[2:13:53] script part of the script that that that
[2:13:56] we've had to play is this soldier with
[2:13:58] amnesia part of the you know each I
[2:14:00] don't even I don't know much about
[2:14:01] theater or drama everyone's got like a
[2:14:03] script or whatever it is and and you've
[2:14:04] got you know everyone's got a job to do
[2:14:06] and you got to played the part and part
[2:14:09] of our role has been to have amnesia
[2:14:11] part of our role has been to not know
[2:14:14] who we are and then you know as as your
[2:14:18] identity as the mirror is getting
[2:14:20] clearer and clearer I think they call it
[2:14:22] not Crescendo that's music and finale or
[2:14:24] something you know the big finale it's
[2:14:26] like boom it's like whoa could it be and
[2:14:30] now we're suddenly looking at the
[2:14:31] revelation of Jesus Christ this great
[2:14:34] finale this this play that we've playing
[2:14:36] in the mystery of of who we've been all
[2:14:39] this time why we've been the way we are
[2:14:41] now we can see why is brother Gabe the
[2:14:44] way he is why cuz like 20 years ago did
[2:14:47] you Minister 20 years ago I don't think
[2:14:49] so 20 years ago
[2:14:52] however long right 21 years ago he
[2:14:54] wasn't ministering and he had such a
[2:14:56] hard life it's like why am I like this
[2:14:58] Lord why and like suddenly the time
[2:15:01] comes that it's manifest it's like
[2:15:02] that's why that's why we are carrying on
[2:15:06] his work as we come to a
[2:15:08] close we are fulfilling what he saw
[2:15:13] before the foundation of the world just
[2:15:15] turn to First Peter if you can first
[2:15:18] Peter 5: 10
[2:15:21] 1 Peter
[2:15:23] 5 verse
[2:15:25] 10 it says but the God of all Grace who
[2:15:29] hath called us unto his eternal glory by
[2:15:35] Christ Jesus after that you have
[2:15:37] suffered a while make you perfect
[2:15:40] establish strengthen settle you look
[2:15:44] we've been looking at predestination
[2:15:46] we've been looking at our personal
[2:15:48] predestination you know and we' been
[2:15:51] looking about you know it says here how
[2:15:53] we are called unto his eternal glory
[2:15:57] there's only one
[2:15:58] Eternal so if we're called unto his
[2:16:01] eternal glory it means that back then
[2:16:04] when it was just God dwelling in his
[2:16:06] thoughts you were called when you were
[2:16:08] chosen in him you were chosen to
[2:16:12] manifest his glory that's that's that's
[2:16:15] that's what you were chosen that's when
[2:16:17] you were chosen Eternal means no
[2:16:19] Beginning No End if there's no Beginning
[2:16:21] No End then it has to have been back
[2:16:22] there although not yet
[2:16:25] manifested so now the question is when
[2:16:28] did he call you it says here but the god
[2:16:29] of our of all Grace who have called us
[2:16:32] unto his eternal glory so the question
[2:16:34] now is when did he call
[2:16:36] you when did we begin I was born I was
[2:16:40] manifested in
[2:16:42] 1980 but actually when would I begin
[2:16:46] when were we called when was the lamb
[2:16:48] slain before the foundation of the world
[2:16:50] he said all these things it's kind of
[2:16:52] your mind gets a bit like you
[2:16:54] know because we start to think these
[2:16:56] thoughts and we just we can't put it
[2:16:58] together but it's like the Mosaic in the
[2:17:00] old Luther wbg thing You' got to step
[2:17:03] back a bit and just see the whole thing
[2:17:04] and just say Lord could it be could it
[2:17:07] be Lord help me just to see it you know
[2:17:11] he called us before the foundation of
[2:17:13] the world when he called us in Christ
[2:17:15] Jesus Remember the scripture in Christ
[2:17:17] Jesus and our eternal glory after little
[2:17:21] suffering you know suffering in this
[2:17:22] life is part of the script it's just
[2:17:25] part of the script it's part of the
[2:17:26] script and the script was written way
[2:17:29] back then the script us sitting here
[2:17:31] today was written back then he saw you
[2:17:34] you're manifesting what he want he
[2:17:36] wanted to have a bride that was hungry
[2:17:39] he wanted to have a bride that got here
[2:17:41] like super early for church because they
[2:17:43] want to hear from him he wanted the
[2:17:45] bride that was going to sit at his feet
[2:17:46] and just soak it up that's what he
[2:17:48] wanted is that you yes sir so therefore
[2:17:51] you are fulfilling his desire you're
[2:17:54] fulfilling his desire to have that that
[2:17:56] that bride part sitting hearing of
[2:17:58] himself hearing of your eternal security
[2:18:00] your Eternal the predestinated calling
[2:18:03] of you this is what he wants you're
[2:18:05] fulfilling that now and just this little
[2:18:07] bit of suffering in between it's part of
[2:18:09] the script that was written way back
[2:18:12] then you know everything that he is and
[2:18:15] Ever Was was back then everything you
[2:18:19] know you too were there you were there
[2:18:22] us being here today it was all there you
[2:18:24] know all your mannerisms and you know
[2:18:26] the old
[2:18:28] uh little lines and everything it's it's
[2:18:30] it's
[2:18:31] perfect it's perfect the mannerism is
[2:18:35] the character it's it's it's how it is
[2:18:37] it's it's God's thoughts being brought
[2:18:39] into manifestation God's thoughts being
[2:18:42] brought into manifestation we're the
[2:18:44] bride of Christ if we just realize that
[2:18:47] we know we didn't begin at Birth we
[2:18:49] didn't begin at Birth
[2:18:51] we we were manifested at Birth but we
[2:18:53] began back there although we were not
[2:18:56] manifest we were there we're attributes
[2:19:00] of God if you'd come forward brother
[2:19:02] Blake we're come from God we're going
[2:19:05] back to
[2:19:06] God you know let's read Ephesians
[2:19:10] 1:10 last scripture Ephesians 1:
[2:19:16] 10 in fact we'll read N9 and 10
[2:19:21] Ephesians 1:9 and 10 says having made
[2:19:25] known unto us the mystery of his will
[2:19:27] according to his good pleasure which he
[2:19:29] hath purposed in
[2:19:32] himself that in the dispensation of the
[2:19:35] fullness of times he might gather
[2:19:37] together in one all things in Christ
[2:19:41] both which are in heaven and which are
[2:19:43] on earth even in him you know in the
[2:19:47] fullness of times at the end everything
[2:19:50] that we see here all these attributes
[2:19:53] that were in there together the Lord
[2:19:55] will gather them all back together and
[2:19:58] they will be in him in the fullness of
[2:20:00] times everything all going back we are
[2:20:03] going back we're going back to and we're
[2:20:06] not going to be because now we're
[2:20:07] manifest so we don't go back to being
[2:20:08] thought but we are still all one he's
[2:20:11] Gathering all things together in himself
[2:20:13] you know I just pray that the Lord takes
[2:20:15] this small word and you know and just
[2:20:18] and just encourages you just to show you
[2:20:20] who you are look the youngest one to the
[2:20:22] oldest one you know this this plan here
[2:20:24] this plan here you know many of us where
[2:20:25] is it this this this predes this is
[2:20:27] predestination and you know each one of
[2:20:30] us this I heard brother a a brother told
[2:20:34] me a testimony yesterday about um about
[2:20:37] a family member who had a who had a
[2:20:39] child when it was physically impossible
[2:20:42] it was physically impossible but you see
[2:20:44] like if we would this this this I'm
[2:20:46] going to choose this one this one had to
[2:20:48] be you see and now now somebody
[2:20:51] somewhere along the line somebody had to
[2:20:53] that in order for brother Gabe to be the
[2:20:55] way he was somebody let's just say oh
[2:20:57] way back here somewhere like somebody's
[2:21:01] wife unfortunately had to pass
[2:21:03] away because brother Gabe's got to be
[2:21:06] who he is but you see that wife passing
[2:21:09] away made the husband the way he is and
[2:21:12] so now his DNA it's still affecting
[2:21:14] brother Gabe right but he looks
[2:21:17] different on the outside because
[2:21:19] actually he married again and this this
[2:21:21] wife was part of brother gab's DNA but
[2:21:23] it was still in there from him losing
[2:21:25] you read between the lines you got like
[2:21:27] like you know one one of them one of we
[2:21:29] don't know all the stories there's so
[2:21:31] many stories see like you know one of
[2:21:34] them's got to be brought into a adopted
[2:21:35] into a family one of them's going to be
[2:21:37] this one of them's going to be that it's
[2:21:38] perfect the point I'm trying to say is
[2:21:40] that you are so perfect there is no
[2:21:43] mistake sometimes we sit there and we
[2:21:44] think Lord why am I like this you know
[2:21:47] there's nobody why am I why am I such a
[2:21:49] failure why did I why is it cost why is
[2:21:51] it why do it cost me to stand here my
[2:21:54] livelihood my business everything that's
[2:21:57] everything that you know when the Lord
[2:21:58] called me to the ministry all my big
[2:22:01] stuff all the big fan it just just
[2:22:03] dwindled away it's cost his personal
[2:22:05] stuff but it's cost me it's cost me to
[2:22:08] stand here because but the Lord's done
[2:22:10] it that way so that we are humble in
[2:22:13] humility we're com here and say Lord we
[2:22:15] are nothing why have you made me like
[2:22:17] this why did you make brother Gabe like
[2:22:19] why has he got to cry behind the the
[2:22:20] public why has this brother got to break
[2:22:22] down when he because it's the way that
[2:22:23] the words got to be brought across in
[2:22:25] humility it's just what the Lord's got
[2:22:28] for us that's all we can say the Lord's
[2:22:29] good you know one day we're going to see
[2:22:31] the end of this great drama and when we
[2:22:34] see the end of the drama what a finale
[2:22:37] what if not then we will understand why
[2:22:39] we'll understand why we'll understand
[2:22:41] all the the family you
[2:22:45] know all the little Corners missing the
[2:22:48] E and up all these little things you
[2:22:49] know why is it we don't know but one day
[2:22:52] we'll see one all we know is that the
[2:22:54] Lord wants us like this let's just stand
[2:22:57] and pray if we
[2:23:01] can Lord Jesus we love you Lord Lord
