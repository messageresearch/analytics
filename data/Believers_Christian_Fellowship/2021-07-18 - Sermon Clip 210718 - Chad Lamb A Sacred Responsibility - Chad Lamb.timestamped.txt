[0:00] you realize in the garden of eden this
[0:04] was the goal
[0:06] this is what the devil was after
[0:09] and i'll tell you at the end time this
[0:12] is what he's after
[0:14] he is after the sacred motherhood of a
[0:16] body of christ amen the bride of christ
[0:19] bringing forth christ again upon the
[0:21] earth he's after that motherhood he's
[0:22] after that conception
[0:24] he's after that pure undefiled coming
[0:27] forth of the seed
[0:28] of christ right now he'll play with the
[0:32] church's
[0:33] womanhood to get her to let down on her
[0:35] covering to get her to
[0:36] to use some reasoning and drop some
[0:39] things and add some things
[0:40] he'll get her to mess with her
[0:41] motherhood because he wants to take her
[0:42] virtue because he wants to corrupt
[0:44] motherhood because when he corrupt
[0:46] motherhood in the beginning he brought
[0:48] defilement and began to establish his
[0:50] eden upon the earth
[0:51] amen but if this motherhood ever goes
[0:53] back to what it's supposed to be
[0:54] he's going to lose his eden
[0:58] the goal is the motherhood the sacred
[1:00] motherhood is what he's after
[1:02] why do you keep your womanhood so you
[1:05] can keep your virtue why you keep your
[1:07] virtues so you can keep your motherhood
[1:09] because that's the goal because a woman
[1:10] now is entrusted with characteristics
[1:12] because god
[1:13] she was instrumental in the fall but now
[1:15] god is going to use her for redemption
[1:16] and he's going to bring life through
[1:18] this vessel and because he's going to
[1:20] bring
[1:20] life she's been given a sacred trust and
[1:22] that sacred trust shouldn't mean
[1:23] everything to a daughter of god because
[1:27] it types the church
[1:29] that sacred trust to a church what's the
[1:31] church supposed to do in this day
[1:32] she's supposed to manifest the life of
[1:34] jesus christ she's supposed to bring
[1:36] forth amen adam was given a wife to
[1:38] reproduce himself amen that's what
[1:40] christ was given a bride for to
[1:41] reproduce himself but she fell
[1:43] but in the end time he's going to be
[1:45] presented with a virgin bride virgin of
[1:47] the word and what she's supposed to do
[1:48] represent it represent him reproduce him
[1:52] upon the earth again
[1:54] what's he after the motherhood
