[6:12] man it's good to be here together amen
[6:14] and the environment we live in
[6:16] it's good to be here together let's take
[6:19] our bibles and turn to the book of james
[6:22] as we begin in this verse this evening
[6:26] thank god for the privilege to be here
[6:28] and may he be glorified in all we do
[6:32] james chapter one we'll start in the
[6:35] book of james
[6:37] chapter one and i'm gonna begin reading
[6:40] from verse two
[6:44] my brethren counted all joy when you
[6:45] fall into diverse temptations
[6:48] knowing this that the trying of your
[6:50] faith work is patience
[6:51] but let patience have her perfect work
[6:54] that you may be perfect in entire
[6:56] wanting nothing praise the lord
[7:00] so count it all joy that's the challenge
[7:03] amen
[7:04] that's the challenge let's bow our heads
[7:05] and pray dear heavenly father we ask
[7:08] lord jesus that you would be glorified
[7:10] today
[7:11] that you would be high and lifted up
[7:12] lord in everything we would say and do
[7:15] may you have preeminence lord and take
[7:17] control of these lips lord to speak your
[7:19] words
[7:20] lord i pray that you would mold our
[7:22] hearts lord into your character that you
[7:23] would change us lord
[7:25] into your likeness that you would lift
[7:27] us up word by word
[7:29] we love you and we asked it lord that
[7:31] you would take control of this service
[7:32] now in jesus name we pray
[7:34] amen you can have your seats
[7:39] so um i just want to give you a quick
[7:42] update i did i was able to talk to the
[7:44] health department in allen county and it
[7:47] didn't change anything
[7:48] so i was hopeful but it didn't really
[7:52] matter much i implored i asked questions
[7:54] i ran scenarios and
[7:56] basically nothing's changed we have to
[7:58] wear the mask even if we're seated even
[8:01] if we're six feet apart from one another
[8:03] we still have to wear the mask in the
[8:05] service
[8:06] sunday school kids under 10 don't have
[8:09] to wear the mask but teachers do
[8:12] and the only time that the teacher's
[8:15] supposed to remove their mask in sunday
[8:17] school
[8:18] is if they're having trouble
[8:19] communicating
[8:21] so i don't i don't know i'm not
[8:24] interpreting that in any way but
[8:27] but anyhow that's what i was told
[8:30] and then also there there's an exemption
[8:34] for the hearing impaired whenever you're
[8:35] speaking to someone who's hearing
[8:36] impaired
[8:37] you can remove your mask so please if
[8:39] anybody's talking to brother wesley
[8:41] always take your mask off because he
[8:42] read he reads lips
[8:46] hey amen brother you're going to get a
[8:48] lot of fellowship in church
[8:52] amen so praise the lord
[8:55] if we're stuck in this situation we
[8:56] might as well enjoy it amen
[8:58] why be unhappy amen god is good
[9:01] also many of you might have heard that
[9:03] mike dewine announced today
[9:05] that starting tomorrow at 6 00 pm it's a
[9:07] statewide
[9:08] mass mandate so no shopping in wapawk
[9:12] you know it doesn't change anything now
[9:14] we're all in the same boat together
[9:16] which means the likelihood of a quick
[9:18] turnaround for allen county is now gone
[9:21] because now allen county is with the
[9:22] whole state so
[9:24] as columbus rises and falls so do we
[9:27] which means god is really desiring to
[9:30] test his children
[9:32] i'm convinced he's taylor made this one
[9:34] for us
[9:35] but god be praised we're going to be
[9:37] obedient we're going to love him anyhow
[9:39] we're going to praise the lord anyway
[9:42] man let's let's look together at first
[9:44] peter if we could turn over there
[9:45] quickly
[9:46] first peter
[9:51] chapter 1 first peter chapter 1
[9:55] and verse 6 wherein you greatly rejoice
[9:59] though now for a season if need be you
[10:01] are in heaviness through manifold
[10:03] temptations
[10:04] that the trial of your faith being much
[10:05] more precious than of gold that
[10:07] perisheth
[10:08] though it be tried with fire might be
[10:10] found in praise and honor and glory
[10:12] at the appearing of jesus christ so the
[10:14] scripture is consistent
[10:16] that these temptations and trials are
[10:18] good for us
[10:19] they're working a wonderful thing in our
[10:21] life we wouldn't ask for them
[10:23] we don't necessarily uh um in our human
[10:27] self
[10:27] want them to come along but god has
[10:29] designed it for our good
[10:31] and it's working something beneficial to
[10:33] us that we need
[10:34] so we say praise the lord in good times
[10:37] praise the lord and bad times praise the
[10:38] lord and all times praise the lord
[10:41] and i titled this today just so we can
[10:43] keep our thought together
[10:44] the danger of having it too good
[10:49] self-explanatory title the danger of
[10:52] having it too good
[10:54] i want to read from this quote in the
[10:56] united time and sign from 1963
[10:58] brother brahm says speaking of tension i
[11:00] was praying about it this morning
[11:02] what would you do if you didn't have
[11:04] tension just think of it tension is part
[11:06] of living
[11:07] that kind of encouraged me when i
[11:09] thought that if you had no tension you'd
[11:11] be like a ragdoll you wouldn't have no
[11:13] feelings
[11:14] there would be nothing you could work on
[11:16] like a husband and wife maybe if she
[11:17] wants to do something and
[11:19] they're trying to work together
[11:20] especially christians and the other one
[11:22] once and
[11:23] and when when you come together you find
[11:25] out what she's done
[11:26] she finds out see the tension really
[11:28] brings you closer together
[11:30] and somebody tells you that well said
[11:32] just think of that little wife that went
[11:34] under a lot of tension when you wasn't
[11:35] so good
[11:36] or the husband went under 10 under some
[11:39] tension when you wasn't so good then
[11:42] when it's all forgiven
[11:43] look how you feel about him my you you
[11:46] just see you just got to have tension
[11:48] that's all
[11:50] and just think if feelings what if you
[11:51] didn't have any feelings no pains or
[11:53] nothing
[11:54] what if there be no pain at all you'd
[11:56] have no feelings at all see
[11:58] and if you had no feeling then one of
[11:59] your senses would be gone see so
[12:01] see everything's just right anyhow so
[12:04] god just give us grace to stand up to it
[12:06] that's the thing
[12:08] if i just stand up with that grace and
[12:10] stand there and say
[12:11] we know that when this life is over the
[12:13] great one's on the other side where
[12:15] we're looking to go to
[12:16] and now we remember that all these
[12:18] things that's a tension that
[12:20] some people tries to introduce
[12:21] christianity that you're free from worry
[12:23] you're not
[12:24] no you're not he said you're free from
[12:27] tension oh no
[12:28] you add tension when you become a
[12:30] christian because you was kind of a slop
[12:32] go happy go lucky whatever
[12:34] it was out there not caring what you did
[12:36] but when you become a real
[12:38] christian every moment you're wondering
[12:40] am i pleasing my lord
[12:42] if i could hear from him it puts you on
[12:44] tension puts you on guard
[12:46] that's what makes you what you are so
[12:48] after all tension is a blessing
[12:53] so god creates situations that create
[12:56] more tension because it's a blessing
[12:59] tension is a blessing it's just the way
[13:01] you're looking at it
[13:02] it's just the way you're looking at it
[13:04] see if you just
[13:05] look the other side no matter how thin
[13:08] you slice anything you've still got two
[13:09] sides to it you see
[13:10] so you want to see both sides so tension
[13:13] i think oh my
[13:14] what's this tension if i could have been
[13:17] born without this tension
[13:18] well if i would have had if i wouldn't
[13:20] have had this tension
[13:22] i wouldn't have been what i am i
[13:24] wouldn't have been a christian perhaps
[13:26] it was this tension that drove me to
[13:27] jesus christ see
[13:29] it's been a blessed it's been a blessing
[13:31] thing in my life
[13:33] this is the prophet who suffered from
[13:35] nervous tension for much of his life and
[13:37] he really
[13:38] really suffered and he was saying here
[13:42] in 1963 that he's saying this tension is
[13:44] a blessing in my life
[13:46] it's the thing that drove me to jesus
[13:48] christ is the thing that creates
[13:49] desperation in life
[13:51] amen god god loves us so much
[13:55] that he doesn't i would say this way god
[13:57] doesn't spoil his children
[14:00] you know i've seen spoiled children and
[14:03] many of you have and
[14:06] and spoiled children always hate their
[14:08] parents
[14:10] they're always fussing and fighting with
[14:13] their parents they're never happy
[14:15] they're never satisfied they never have
[14:17] joy
[14:18] amen any joy that they have because a
[14:20] parent gives in to him is only temporary
[14:22] and it turns into frustration very
[14:24] quickly
[14:24] amen and spoiled children are never
[14:26] satisfied they're never happy and
[14:28] they're never at peace with mom and dad
[14:30] amen but children who have been brought
[14:32] up difficult and rough and
[14:34] and sparingly and not been spoiled they
[14:36] love mom and dad they're happy they're
[14:38] content
[14:39] i mean they can be happy with a stick
[14:42] i mean they can play games with a bottle
[14:44] cap and then they
[14:46] they can become joyful they become happy
[14:48] and so god will not spoil his children
[14:50] because god wants to maintain the right
[14:52] relationship with us
[14:55] if you look at what's happening in the
[14:57] government now there's been such
[14:59] a a spoiling of the american citizen by
[15:02] the u.s
[15:03] government trying to provide everything
[15:06] in fact you know when this thing first
[15:07] came down they want to give everybody
[15:09] extra money everybody get to check
[15:11] for nothing you did nothing but you get
[15:12] a check they want to give out another
[15:14] round of checks amen
[15:16] and the people that they're sending
[15:17] checks to are the people that's trying
[15:19] to
[15:20] topple over monuments and spray paint
[15:23] state houses and why because spoiled
[15:26] children hate their parents and are
[15:27] never happy
[15:30] can you imagine the original americans
[15:32] looking at what's going on now they
[15:34] would be dumbfounded amen
[15:36] the the americans nowadays have more
[15:38] than they ever had
[15:39] back then but the one thing they're
[15:40] lacking is character
[15:43] they have money they have jobs and cars
[15:47] houses stimulus checks but no character
[15:51] and in in power without character is
[15:54] satanic
[15:57] so god is going to make sure that his
[15:58] bride's going to have character because
[16:00] he's given his bride the word and the
[16:02] unfolding of the word brings power
[16:05] the revelation brings power and god is
[16:07] not going to give her
[16:08] the power of his word amen until she's
[16:11] got the character to handle it
[16:13] so god's going to make sure we go under
[16:15] tension we're not going to be spoiled
[16:17] children
[16:18] he's not going to give and give and give
[16:19] so we can turn around and shake our fist
[16:21] and his face and say we want more
[16:25] but god is going to make sure that we
[16:27] have enough trials
[16:29] enough troubles enough difficulties
[16:32] enough failures
[16:33] enough tension so that every portion we
[16:36] get we're grateful for
[16:38] every new morsel that comes every meal
[16:41] we say thank you
[16:43] amen how many children sit down at
[16:45] breakfast lunch and supper three meals a
[16:47] day that mom fixed and put on the table
[16:49] and how
[16:50] many still say thank you mom thank you
[16:52] for lunch thank you for suffering
[16:53] it becomes so routine we forget amen and
[16:56] we can do the same thing with god it
[16:58] becomes so routine so expected
[17:00] that we begin to forget amen how
[17:02] precious it is
[17:03] for god to give revelation how beautiful
[17:05] it is for god to give his word
[17:08] what a wonderful thing it is amen to be
[17:10] able to worship him in spirit and in
[17:12] truth
[17:14] so god makes sure that we learn the
[17:16] lesson the right way
[17:19] and at the end of the day
[17:23] we're thankful when we look back on a
[17:27] life
[17:28] that's had troubles
[17:31] it's not been smooth all the way there's
[17:33] been difficulties there's been losses
[17:35] there's been rejections there's been
[17:37] separations there's been highs and
[17:39] there's been lows
[17:40] and but you look back and you needed god
[17:42] and god brought you through this
[17:44] and he brought you through that and he
[17:45] brought and all it does is build a
[17:47] greater gratitude and love in your heart
[17:49] for god
[17:50] if it had been smooth all the way
[17:52] through and no trouble and
[17:54] and no pressures and no difficulties no
[17:57] disappointments no tears no
[17:58] anguish amen we wouldn't have the same
[18:01] level of gratitude
[18:03] and so when these things come like
[18:05] they're coming now and like we'll be
[18:06] coming in the future
[18:08] amen these things are good for us let's
[18:11] turn to the book of isaiah
[18:16] remember we're looking at the danger
[18:20] of having it too good
[18:23] isaiah 14.
[18:34] isaiah 14 and verse 12
[18:39] how art thou fallen from heaven o
[18:40] lucifer's son of the morning
[18:42] howarth thou cut down to the ground
[18:44] which has weakened the nations
[18:46] for thou has said in thine heart i will
[18:48] ascend into heaven
[18:49] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[18:51] of god i will sit also upon the mount of
[18:54] the congregation and the sides of the
[18:55] north
[18:56] i will ascend above the heights of the
[18:58] clouds i will be like the most high
[19:01] yet thou shall be brought down to hell
[19:04] to the sides of the pit
[19:06] let's turn from here over to ezekiel 28.
[19:19] ezekiel 28
[19:22] and verse 12. ezekiel 28 and 12
[19:27] son of man take up a lamentation upon
[19:29] the king of tyrus
[19:31] and send him thus saith the lord god
[19:33] thou sealest up the son
[19:35] full of wisdom and perfect in beauty
[19:38] brother graham says this is a
[19:39] description of lucifer
[19:41] thou sealest up the psalm full of wisdom
[19:44] and perfect in beauty now i want you to
[19:47] look at the condition
[19:49] that lucifer is in
[19:52] full of wisdom and perfect in beauty
[19:55] thou has been in eden the garden of god
[19:58] every
[19:59] precious stone was like covering the
[20:00] sardis topaz and the diamond the barrel
[20:03] the onyx and the jasper
[20:05] the sapphire the emerald and the
[20:06] carbuncle and gold
[20:08] the workmanship of thy tabernacle and of
[20:10] thy pipes was prepared in thee in the
[20:11] day that thou was created
[20:13] thou art the anointed cherub that
[20:15] covereth and i have set thee so
[20:17] thou wast upon the holy mountain of god
[20:19] thou has walked up and down in the midst
[20:21] of stones of fire
[20:22] that was perfect in thy ways from the
[20:24] day that thou was created till iniquity
[20:26] was found in thee
[20:28] by the multitude of thy merchandise they
[20:30] have filled the midst of thee with
[20:31] violence
[20:32] and thou has sinned therefore i will
[20:34] cast his profane out of the mountain of
[20:36] god
[20:36] and i will destroy the oak covering
[20:38] cherub from the midst of the stones of
[20:39] fire
[20:40] thine heart was lifted up because of thy
[20:42] beauty thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by
[20:45] reason of thy brightness
[20:47] i will cast thee to the ground i will
[20:49] lay thee before kings that they may
[20:51] behold thee
[20:52] that was defiled thy sanctuaries by the
[20:54] multitude of thine iniquities
[20:56] by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore
[20:58] i bring forth a fire from the midst of
[21:00] thee
[21:01] it shall devour thee and i will bring
[21:02] thee to ashes upon the earth and the
[21:04] sight of all them that behold thee
[21:07] all they that know thee among the people
[21:09] shall be astonished at thee
[21:11] thou shall be a terror and never never
[21:14] shalt thou be
[21:15] anymore so lucifer we find out
[21:19] brother of them tells us he talks about
[21:20] it many places lucifer was
[21:22] one of the covering cherubs as we found
[21:24] out here in ezekiel and god had said him
[21:26] so
[21:27] he was full of wisdom and perfect in
[21:29] beauty
[21:31] but but although he was perfect and i
[21:34] would also say it this way
[21:36] lucifer was highly revelated
[21:41] lucifer knew the word of god he
[21:44] he was there in the act of creation he
[21:47] he saw what was going on he was a
[21:50] covering cherub
[21:51] he was as close to god as you could get
[21:55] and he was designed to be full of wisdom
[21:58] and perfect in beauty
[22:00] and god made him i mean he was called
[22:03] lucifer
[22:03] lucifer means light bearer he was a
[22:06] light bearer
[22:07] so he was a carrier of the word he was a
[22:10] light bearer
[22:10] that means the shine or the morning star
[22:13] he was the son of the morning or son of
[22:14] the dawn
[22:15] or the sun from the beginning so he was
[22:19] he was he was perfect the bible says he
[22:21] was perfect the bible said he was full
[22:23] of wisdom not that he was lacking any he
[22:25] was full of wisdom
[22:26] and perfect in beauty by being full of
[22:29] wisdom and perfect in beauty
[22:30] and being as close to god as you could
[22:32] get amen he had it all
[22:34] good everything was good
[22:38] but he had it so good that the
[22:41] perfection in him
[22:43] corrupted him by all of his merchandise
[22:47] there was iniquity found in him there
[22:49] was violence in him
[22:51] amen in in his heart verse 17
[22:54] the heart was lifted up because of thy
[22:56] beauty
[22:58] thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[23:01] of thy
[23:01] brightness or thy splendor so he was
[23:05] i would say it this way he was too good
[23:09] his splendor and his brightness it
[23:12] corrupted him
[23:14] his wisdom amen it perverted him
[23:19] he had it so good he wasn't content with
[23:23] the full of wisdom and perfect and
[23:24] beauty
[23:25] that he had he wanted to ascend above
[23:29] the stars of heaven
[23:30] he wanted more he didn't have enough he
[23:32] wanted more
[23:33] he wanted to be exalted he wanted to be
[23:35] like the most high
[23:36] he was next to the most high mother verb
[23:39] said his right hand man
[23:40] equal to god co-equal to god in all ways
[23:43] except for creation
[23:46] so you couldn't get much better than
[23:49] this
[23:50] but but in all that perfect world
[23:53] full of wisdom perfect in beauty i mean
[23:55] the tabrets and the pipes and everything
[23:58] that he had
[23:59] amen all the perfection was able to turn
[24:02] to corruption within
[24:04] him and so
[24:07] it's not necessarily
[24:11] being close to perfect will solve the
[24:14] problem
[24:16] sometimes the closer you get to perfect
[24:18] it makes it worse
[24:21] having it easy having it perfect that
[24:24] not not necessarily going to solve the
[24:26] problem
[24:27] so lucifer amen was corrupted
[24:31] and and look at the destruction that
[24:32] will come from lucifer in verse 18.
[24:36] thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the
[24:38] multitude of thine iniquities by the
[24:39] iniquity of thy trapping
[24:41] therefore will i bring forth a fire from
[24:43] the midst of thee
[24:44] it shall devour thee
[24:48] lucifer is going to be destroyed within
[24:51] himself
[24:53] it looks to me like a self-destruction
[24:56] and this is what happens to people you
[24:59] you see all the
[25:00] time it's so good everything's so good
[25:03] everything's so perfect amen and they
[25:05] have a meltdown within themselves and
[25:07] they throw their whole life away they
[25:08] destroy themselves
[25:09] from within themselves and god is going
[25:11] to allow the same thing to happen to
[25:13] lucifer
[25:14] he's going to there's going to be a fire
[25:15] within the midst of him that will
[25:17] destroy him
[25:20] he has no character i'd say it like this
[25:24] if i could just put in my words
[25:25] he has everything but character
[25:31] he had power he had wisdom
[25:34] he had beauty he had authority
[25:38] but he had no character
[25:41] in the in the message the true vine and
[25:43] the false vine brother ram says now look
[25:44] at cain
[25:46] he came with sincerity but look in the
[25:48] background his daddy the devil
[25:51] he was influenced by his daddy the
[25:53] reason in heaven when he was up there
[25:55] he set up a kingdom more beautiful more
[25:57] elaborate pretty
[25:59] than what michael's was he tried to get
[26:01] a greater kingdom
[26:02] that's why he was kicked out pride
[26:04] beauty stuck up
[26:06] and when he come here there was a nature
[26:08] of him right in this boy and it
[26:10] hasn't died yet you believe that nature
[26:13] hasn't died yet
[26:14] it's in humanity always trying to
[26:18] do better have pride but but i want to
[26:20] think about when i look at this i think
[26:22] about
[26:23] what was michael's kingdom like if
[26:25] lucifer could do one better
[26:29] i wonder if even in the heavenly realms
[26:32] if michael i'm just wondering if
[26:34] michael's kingdom
[26:36] couldn't have still been humble even in
[26:37] the heavenly realms
[26:39] it was humble in such a way that lucifer
[26:42] was sure he could make one better
[26:46] and sirs we would see jesus brother says
[26:49] god doesn't live in glamour
[26:50] god lives in humility glamour comes from
[26:54] satan he lives in humility when he was
[26:57] here on earth he became the humblest
[26:59] among men the poorest among men
[27:01] who who was it wanted glamour satan he
[27:04] wanted his kingdom greater than
[27:05] michael's
[27:06] so he set it up in the north tried to
[27:08] outshine it
[27:09] son of the morning he says in christ is
[27:12] the mystery of god revealed
[27:14] notice lucifer in the last days is doing
[27:16] as he did it first
[27:17] what did lucifer do the first thing that
[27:19] lucifer done to separate the fellowship
[27:21] of god and man
[27:22] he wanted to build him a united kingdom
[27:24] a greater splendor and seemingly more
[27:26] cultured
[27:27] a greater kingdom than michael christ
[27:29] had you got it
[27:31] now now if you miss it just hold up your
[27:33] hand i'll say it again you see
[27:34] lucifer at the beginning his purpose and
[27:37] heart was to achieve a brighter
[27:39] and greater thing in heaven than christ
[27:41] had is that right
[27:42] by seemingly a more cultured more
[27:45] beautiful
[27:46] more splendor than the kingdom of christ
[27:49] that's amazing that means that the
[27:52] kingdom of christ
[27:54] this is i'm just going to put in my
[27:55] words just let me explain it the way i
[27:56] understand it i may be wrong
[27:58] but if that's possible it looked like
[27:59] the splendor of christ hadn't been maxed
[28:02] out on beauty and splendor
[28:05] that somehow god had made the the the
[28:09] kingdom of michael the kingdom of christ
[28:11] still in humility to where it wasn't
[28:14] maxed out to the top
[28:15] where lucifer was confident he could do
[28:17] one better
[28:20] because god is known in humility god is
[28:23] not known
[28:24] in glamour god is known in humility
[28:28] so it's amazing how everything started
[28:32] in heaven the war broke out in heaven
[28:34] and moved down to earth and continues on
[28:36] today
[28:37] and it's really the same thing that
[28:38] we're fighting with amen
[28:41] it was satan our lucifer was really
[28:44] battling within himself his perfection
[28:47] and his beauty and his wisdom
[28:49] was corrupting him from within and he
[28:52] could
[28:52] not because he had no character could
[28:54] not look at the beauty of humility
[28:56] humility didn't look right to him and he
[28:59] could do
[29:00] better than the humble kingdom of christ
[29:03] so he went about to do better amen and
[29:06] he wasn't satisfied with the portion
[29:08] that god gave him
[29:10] for he said i will build my kingdom on
[29:12] the side and my throne on silent i will
[29:14] exalt my
[29:15] throne above the stars of heaven i will
[29:17] be like the most high
[29:19] and the battle goes right back to the
[29:21] same one we've always had self-will
[29:23] versus the will of god
[29:24] he wasn't satisfied with his portion and
[29:26] his portion was beautiful
[29:29] we can we can fall into the same lot if
[29:32] we're not careful
[29:33] god has given us so much but let's not
[29:36] let the so much he's given us corrupt us
[29:38] but let god amen in his own way
[29:41] of dealing with his children bring
[29:43] enough tension and enough trials and
[29:45] enough pressure
[29:46] and enough heartache and enough
[29:48] disappointment amen to build in us the
[29:50] character
[29:51] amen to match the beauty of the word
[29:54] that he's given to us
[29:55] and the position he's put us in god has
[29:58] a desire
[29:58] to exalt his bride but he will not let
[30:01] his bride
[30:02] fall like lucifer fell so he will never
[30:05] exalt us
[30:06] amen above the character he's instilled
[30:08] in us to handle the position he puts us
[30:11] so the word has painted a picture of
[30:13] where the bride belongs
[30:16] and brother ben has told us our position
[30:18] in christ we know that position is done
[30:20] it's sealed before the foundation of the
[30:22] world we were in him we were in his mind
[30:24] we were positionally placed in the mind
[30:26] of god amen and that position is
[30:28] absolutely secure but god is allowing us
[30:32] now
[30:32] in a body of flesh to be subject to
[30:34] things upon this earth
[30:36] that does not match our spiritual
[30:38] position
[30:40] and if we try amen to if we try to
[30:43] circumvent the natural circumstances
[30:45] we're in
[30:46] by claiming our spiritual position amen
[30:48] we're going to exalt ourselves
[30:51] above measure beyond the place that god
[30:53] has allowed us to attain to yet
[30:57] you understand god is building us up by
[30:59] faith he's increasing us more and more
[31:02] and more
[31:02] we're already there we've already
[31:04] arrived it's a finished work
[31:05] we're seated in heavenly places in
[31:07] christ jesus but god is working on some
[31:10] character right now and we have to let
[31:13] him work on the character
[31:15] amen and not just claim my spiritual
[31:17] position and ignore all the things he's
[31:19] trying to do to build character and
[31:21] humility in my life
[31:22] amen so that as he lifts me the degree
[31:25] by degree by degree
[31:26] i can handle the position and the
[31:28] authority and the power
[31:30] of the word so i say
[31:33] praise be to god whatever comes praise
[31:36] be to god
[31:38] and you know my initial reaction many
[31:40] times is to begin to grumble and
[31:41] complain
[31:42] amen and it takes a little while
[31:44] sometimes to subdue the flash
[31:46] and remember this is a good thing if it
[31:49] is cross
[31:50] god's desk if he has signed off on if
[31:52] he's authorized this trial
[31:54] then this is a good thing for me and if
[31:56] god has not authorized this trial
[31:58] then then something is happening outside
[32:00] of his will for my life and now
[32:02] i'm not secure in my position in him
[32:05] you realize it's either he authorized it
[32:08] or he didn't
[32:08] if he didn't then where does that put us
[32:14] so if we're secure in our position in
[32:16] him then he's authorized to trial
[32:19] let's turn to jude i want to look at i
[32:21] just want to look at the approach and
[32:23] attitude and spirit of michael
[32:26] we see quite a bit in the scriptures
[32:30] about
[32:33] lucifer and there's
[32:36] not a lot of scriptures about michael
[32:40] but i want to look at this one in jude
[32:42] chapter 1
[32:44] verse 8. jude chapter 1 verse 8.
[32:48] likewise also these filthy dreamers
[32:50] defile the flesh despise dominion
[32:52] and speak evil of dignities yet michael
[32:55] the archangel when contending with the
[32:58] devil
[32:58] he disputed about the body of moses
[33:01] durst not bring against him a railing
[33:03] accusation
[33:05] but said the lord rebuked thee
[33:08] now the reason i read that is because
[33:10] we're looking at
[33:11] michael who has
[33:14] character we know michael has character
[33:18] amen
[33:19] and michael in his character when he
[33:21] begins when the devil begins to dispute
[33:23] with him
[33:24] over the body of moses he doesn't go off
[33:27] on him
[33:28] he doesn't give him what for amen he
[33:31] doesn't even bring a railing accusation
[33:33] amen and who better knows the character
[33:36] and life of lucifer
[33:38] who better knows the devil than michael
[33:42] they fought a war in heaven amen the war
[33:44] in heaven spelled out on earth and
[33:46] now they're here disputing over the body
[33:47] of moses but he would not even bring
[33:50] a slanderous accusation against him
[33:53] and he knew the character of the devil
[33:55] but he said the lord rebuked you
[33:57] i'm not dealing with you i'm not
[33:59] accusing you i'm not saying anything
[34:01] evil of you
[34:02] the lord rebuke you the lord deal with
[34:05] you
[34:05] but somehow we can feel justified in
[34:08] ourselves because we know the word and
[34:10] we know evil we know the devil
[34:12] and we speak we can speak things
[34:15] about the devil that michael wouldn't
[34:17] speak about the devil
[34:22] do you understand what i'm saying
[34:25] sometimes we get
[34:26] ideas that we call the devil names and
[34:29] we we say we're stomping on the devil
[34:32] and
[34:34] but we take an attitude it's an attitude
[34:37] friends
[34:38] that doesn't mean that the devil's not
[34:40] going to be placed
[34:41] satan will not be placed under her feet
[34:44] but who's
[34:45] placing him under her feet amen it says
[34:47] the
[34:48] god blessed be the god of all peace that
[34:50] will bruce satan shortly
[34:51] under your feet who's doing the bruising
[34:54] under your feet it's god who's doing it
[34:56] it's the power of god doing it it's not
[34:59] and it's not
[34:59] it's not uh it's not angry
[35:03] it's words it's not contentious railing
[35:05] accusations coming out of the bride
[35:07] that'll put satan under her feet amen it
[35:10] doesn't matter what's coming out of your
[35:11] mouth you can say all kinds of angry
[35:13] things and get all worked up and
[35:14] sweating
[35:15] stomp all over the pulpit but that's not
[35:17] changing anything
[35:18] it's the god of peace amen who's
[35:20] bruising satan under your feet
[35:22] [Music]
[35:24] so so if michael disputing over the body
[35:28] of moses
[35:28] i mean who was it that sent michael down
[35:31] to get the body of moses but god himself
[35:33] he was there on an errand for god
[35:35] he was there in obedience to the word he
[35:37] was there in his post of duty and the
[35:38] devil shows up and starts disputing with
[35:40] him over this body
[35:41] amen and he doesn't even bring a railing
[35:43] accusation he just says the lord rebuked
[35:45] him
[35:48] you know what makes us think
[35:52] if we take that same spirit that somehow
[35:56] if we start calling the devil names
[36:01] and say stuff like the devil's stupid
[36:05] come on how childish is that right how
[36:09] do you really think when lucifer was
[36:11] full of wisdom that the devil's stupid
[36:15] we only say that to make ourselves feel
[36:17] better
[36:19] to make ourselves feel powerful in our
[36:22] own human expression
[36:23] and our own human mind but the reality
[36:25] is the lord deal with you
[36:27] i'm not going to say anything because
[36:29] maybe god is letting you do this right
[36:31] now
[36:32] maybe the lord is letting you afflict me
[36:34] i'm not going to bring a railing
[36:35] accusation i'm not going to call you
[36:36] names
[36:37] i'm not going to spit fire at you i'm
[36:39] not gonna i'm not
[36:40] i'm just gonna say the lord deal with
[36:42] you i'm in the hands of my god
[36:46] and don't worry the lord will deal with
[36:48] him we don't have to worry about it
[36:51] so so you know
[36:55] it has a lot to do with attitude and
[36:58] it's
[36:58] easy to take the human nature and not
[37:00] the nature of christ
[37:03] but we have to subdue that human nature
[37:06] and that's a wrestling match that we all
[37:08] have
[37:08] every day of our lives is to subdue the
[37:10] flesh amen subdue that natural
[37:13] that natural spirit amen to let the holy
[37:15] spirit have free reign
[37:17] that the life of christ come out
[37:20] so we see the nature of michael here
[37:26] brother bram says in message conference
[37:27] with god now my catholic brother and
[37:30] also many of my proudest protestants
[37:32] i'm not hurting you but when you try to
[37:34] make jesus a little lesser god than god
[37:38] make him a lesser god you cut his feet
[37:40] off bring him down just a little bit
[37:42] under the head of god and make him a
[37:43] lesser god you're so wrong
[37:46] jesus was man he called himself the son
[37:48] of man
[37:49] that was a death blow to the devil the
[37:51] devil's high
[37:52] built himself a kingdom more beautiful
[37:54] than michael's
[37:55] cain his son wanted to make a pretty
[37:57] altar all out of fruits and things
[38:00] god doesn't dwell in that kind of beauty
[38:02] but god
[38:03] to strike the death blow to sin look how
[38:05] he come
[38:06] how did he choose to come there's a
[38:08] conference in heaven
[38:10] how are you going down how are you going
[38:12] to do it father said the angels
[38:14] there's a conference in heaven and
[38:15] they're asking how are you going to go
[38:17] down
[38:18] how are you going to do it father i'm
[38:20] going to become one of them
[38:23] my law of redemption is a near kinsman
[38:25] and i'll have to be a man myself
[38:27] that's the strike that knocks satan he
[38:30] couldn't come
[38:31] down with he could have come down with
[38:32] cherubims he could have come down
[38:34] the golden ladders there could have been
[38:36] anthem sung through the heavens and
[38:38] he could have walked to the earth and
[38:40] expelled everything
[38:41] but when he held the conference he
[38:43] decided to come as a babe
[38:45] in isaiah 9 6 we find that unto us a
[38:47] child is born
[38:48] a son is given and the government shall
[38:50] be upon his shoulders
[38:51] and his name shall be called the
[38:53] counselor prince of peace the mighty god
[38:55] the everlasting father and of his
[38:57] dominion there shall be no end
[38:59] this will be a sign unto you a babe not
[39:02] a god a baby
[39:04] look where he was born it had to be
[39:06] decided in the conference where he'd be
[39:07] born
[39:08] to make sure he was man he was born in a
[39:10] stable
[39:11] he chose instead of the ivory palace
[39:13] guard to bring him
[39:14] instead of an angel escort instead of
[39:17] rolling cherubims
[39:18] with the fineries of heaven he stuck
[39:20] himself put himself in a stable
[39:22] over the manure of animals the dirt and
[39:24] filth
[39:25] of the world that's how god chose to
[39:29] come
[39:30] when he come in flesh and
[39:33] and what gives us the idea that
[39:36] everything has to be nice for us
[39:39] where do we get the idea that god is
[39:42] obligated to make everything nice for us
[39:46] to the point that we start to get
[39:48] offended at god when trials start to
[39:50] come
[39:51] when we have and when we have losses
[39:53] when we have rejection when we
[39:55] we have all these things that happen in
[39:56] our life for our good
[39:58] we begin to become offended at god and
[40:00] question the integrity of god
[40:04] what right do we have amen to have
[40:08] everything perfect
[40:10] i think god wants character if he
[40:12] himself came in humility
[40:14] how does he want his bride and arrogance
[40:17] and pride
[40:19] or in humility
[40:20] [Music]
[40:22] let's look at isaiah 42.
[40:26] let's look at these prophecies of the
[40:29] christ coming
[40:31] isaiah 42
[40:34] we'll start with verse 1.
[40:43] isaiah 42 and 1 behold my servant whom i
[40:46] uphold mine elect
[40:47] and whom my soul delighteth i have put
[40:50] my spirit upon him he shall bring forth
[40:52] judgment to the gentiles
[40:53] he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause
[40:56] his voice to be heard in the street
[40:57] a bruised reed shall he not break in the
[41:00] smoking flack shall he not quench
[41:02] he shall bring forth judgment unto truth
[41:06] look at this nature that's coming forth
[41:11] he's sending his elect he's sending his
[41:13] servant to come down
[41:15] but he shall not cry nor lift his voice
[41:19] to be heard in the street a bruised reed
[41:22] shall they not break
[41:23] and the smoking flack shall not quench
[41:25] look how gentle
[41:27] and how timid and how mild natured
[41:29] christ came
[41:32] not what man wanted in a king
[41:35] not what man was looking for and a great
[41:38] deliverer
[41:39] but he comes so meek and so mild and so
[41:42] humble and so tender amen that
[41:46] that the world missed what was in their
[41:48] midst because of the humility
[41:50] because satan lucifer cannot see god in
[41:53] humility
[41:54] they can only see splendor
[41:58] praise be to god but the bride can see
[42:01] him in humility
[42:03] let's turn over to isaiah 53.
[42:12] isaiah 53. verse 1
[42:18] who hath believed our report and to whom
[42:20] is the arm of the lord revealed
[42:22] for he shall grow up before him as a
[42:24] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[42:25] ground
[42:26] he hath no form nor comeliness and when
[42:29] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[42:31] we should desire him
[42:33] he is despised and rejected of men a man
[42:35] of sorrows and acquainted with grief
[42:37] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[42:40] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[42:43] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[42:44] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[42:46] him stricken
[42:48] smitten of god and afflicted but he was
[42:50] wounded for our transgressions
[42:53] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[42:55] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[42:57] and with his stripes we are healed all
[42:59] we like sheep have gone astray we have
[43:01] turned everyone to his own way
[43:03] and the lord hath laid on him the
[43:05] iniquity of us all
[43:07] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[43:09] yet he opened not his mouth
[43:10] he was brought as a lamb to the
[43:12] slaughter and as a sheep before he
[43:13] shears his dumb
[43:15] so he opened not his mouth he was taken
[43:18] from prison and from judgment
[43:20] and who shall declare his generation for
[43:22] he was cut off out of the land of the
[43:23] living for the transgression of my
[43:25] people was he stricken
[43:27] and he made his grave with the wicked
[43:29] and with the rich in his death because
[43:30] he had done no violence neither was any
[43:32] deceit
[43:33] in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to
[43:36] bruise him
[43:37] he hath put him to grief when thou shalt
[43:39] make his soul an offering for sin
[43:41] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[43:43] his days and the pleasure of the lord
[43:45] shall prosper in his hand
[43:47] he shall see of the travail of his soul
[43:49] and shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[43:51] and shall
[43:51] shall my righteous servant justify many
[43:54] for he shall bear their iniquities
[43:56] therefore will i divide him a portion
[43:58] with the great and he shall divide the
[44:00] spoil with the strong
[44:01] because he hath poured out his soul unto
[44:03] death and he was numbered with the
[44:05] transgressors
[44:06] and he bear the sin of many and made
[44:08] intercession
[44:09] for the transgressors this is how christ
[44:13] came
[44:14] this is how christ was treated this is
[44:17] this was the plan of god for his only
[44:20] begotten son
[44:22] and if that's how the bridegroom
[44:25] come to earth and humility and how the
[44:27] bridegroom was treated and god's plan
[44:29] for the bridegroom
[44:31] i wonder what is god's plan for the
[44:34] bride
[44:36] what is god's plan for the bride and we
[44:39] should we
[44:40] be disappointed in diverse temptations
[44:43] and manifold temptations
[44:45] or should we begin to rejoice now amen
[44:47] because
[44:48] because if this is the way the
[44:50] bridegroom was on earth and this is the
[44:52] way he was treated and he was afflicted
[44:54] and
[44:54] and he was rejected and and he was
[44:57] unknown and
[44:58] he had no beauty that we should desire
[45:00] him what about his humble little bride
[45:02] amen because he's got to have a bride
[45:04] that matches his character
[45:06] he's got to have a bride that's a
[45:07] compliment to him
[45:10] amen and his bride you know we know the
[45:12] bride is beautiful the bride is is
[45:15] tremendous because it's god's chosen
[45:17] but her beauty may not be in what we
[45:20] consider beauty
[45:21] but it might be the beauty of humility
[45:23] that matches the humility of christ
[45:27] and brother brahm wasn't just joking
[45:29] when he said the way up is down
[45:32] it was a concept it was a reality it was
[45:34] a truth
[45:35] that that i myself want to be more
[45:38] comfortable with
[45:39] that the way up is down amen amen he
[45:41] that is a base in due time shall be
[45:43] exalted amen just just lower
[45:45] brother said if you want to see how i
[45:46] even go see how little you can become
[45:50] just be nothing amen be absolutely
[45:53] nothing
[45:54] and let god make what he wants out of us
[45:58] so in this life amen
[46:02] in this life the goal is not to be
[46:04] special
[46:06] the goal is to be nothing because god's
[46:09] going to do something special with
[46:11] nothing
[46:12] god's going to do something wonderful
[46:14] with nothing
[46:16] he's going to take nobody and do what
[46:17] only he can do
[46:20] let's go to second corinthians
[46:30] second corinthians chapter 12.
[46:37] i wonder sometimes
[46:42] if the word made flesh
[46:48] has always been crucified
[46:51] that's right the word made flesh has
[46:53] always been rejected
[46:55] it's always been cast away it's always
[46:58] come in humility
[47:00] it's always been low to the standard of
[47:02] the world
[47:04] it's always been ignorant to the wisdom
[47:06] of the world
[47:08] like in noah's day they had scientific
[47:12] proof
[47:13] that noah's message was wrong noah
[47:16] looked
[47:16] ignorant he looked foolish he looked
[47:18] childish in believing what he believed
[47:20] because they had scientific data they
[47:22] had instruments brother bannon said that
[47:23] could
[47:24] shoot the moon and see that there was no
[47:25] water up there
[47:27] and so the word made flesh and every day
[47:30] was rejected
[47:32] kicked around uh belittled
[47:35] it was it was treated badly
[47:38] every time so if we are the word made
[47:41] flesh
[47:42] what is our expectation in this day
[47:46] are we expecting a smooth ride and an
[47:48] acceptance from all
[47:50] a lifted up and put on a pedestal
[47:53] nothing bad ever happening
[47:55] i think if we have that expectation we
[47:57] have the wrong expectation
[48:02] christ learned obedience by the things
[48:04] he suffered
[48:06] christ is in you how are you learning
[48:09] obedience
[48:10] the same way let's look at second
[48:13] corinthians chapter 12
[48:17] verse 5.
[48:20] of such a one i will glory yet of myself
[48:23] i will not glory
[48:24] but in mine infirmities for though i
[48:26] would desire to glory i should not be a
[48:28] fool for i will say the truth
[48:31] but now i forbear lest any man should
[48:33] think of me
[48:34] above that which he seeth me to be or
[48:37] that
[48:37] he heareth of me and lest i should be
[48:40] exalted above
[48:41] measure through the abundance of the
[48:43] revelation there was given to me a thorn
[48:45] in the flesh
[48:46] the messenger of satan to buffet me lest
[48:49] i should be exalted above measure
[48:53] verse 7 is the love of god expressed
[48:58] verse 7 is the grace of god to the
[49:02] apostle paul
[49:05] because the apostle paul was given an
[49:08] abundance of revelation
[49:11] for lest i should be exalted about
[49:13] measure through the abundance of the
[49:14] revelation
[49:16] why did lucifer had abundance of
[49:18] revelation
[49:20] but what did paul get in god's love that
[49:23] lucifer didn't get
[49:24] paul got a thorn in a flesh an
[49:26] affliction that would abase him and keep
[49:28] him needy and dependent
[49:30] on god and keep him humbled that's one
[49:32] thing god did not give to lucifer
[49:37] so what would be greater to be in
[49:38] lucifer's position
[49:40] as an archangel perfect in beauty amen
[49:43] full of wisdom
[49:44] perfect in beauty with the taberns and
[49:46] the and the and the
[49:47] and the pipes and everything so perfect
[49:49] and so wonderful or would it be
[49:51] better to be paul afflicted and smitten
[49:54] amen with a thorn in the flesh
[49:56] humble and dependent and needy
[50:00] i would say god's love expressed would
[50:02] be expressed in paul
[50:03] amen to not let paul get exalted above
[50:06] measure because because with the
[50:09] abundance of revelation
[50:10] comes danger so i can say it that way
[50:14] the abundance of revelation brings with
[50:17] it danger
[50:20] oh praise be to god so god's love for us
[50:24] will send a thorn in the flesh an
[50:26] affliction a messenger of satan
[50:28] to buffet us to buffet me lest i should
[50:32] be exalted above measure for this thing
[50:34] i besought the lord thrice
[50:36] that it might depart from me and he said
[50:38] unto me my grace is sufficient for thee
[50:40] for my strength is made perfect in
[50:42] weakness
[50:44] most gladly therefore will i rather
[50:46] glory in my infirmities that the power
[50:48] of christ may rest upon me
[50:50] therefore i take pleasure in infirmities
[50:58] verse 7 is god's grace
[51:02] and love to paul
[51:06] verse 10 is paul's correct
[51:09] understanding and thankfulness expressed
[51:12] back to god
[51:15] therefore i take pleasure and
[51:17] infirmities
[51:19] and reproaches and necessities in
[51:22] persecutions
[51:23] and distresses for christ's sake for
[51:25] when i am weak
[51:27] then am i strong
[51:31] it's the opposite of what we think
[51:33] friends
[51:35] god god
[51:40] i would say it this way the pressure is
[51:42] increasing for the bride
[51:44] do you feel it
[51:47] and that's a good thing because the
[51:50] place that he wants to take her
[51:53] and the revelation he wants to give to
[51:55] her
[51:56] and the understanding that she will
[51:58] operate by
[51:59] is a very dangerous level of revelation
[52:04] it can be a very deadly very dangerous
[52:06] level of revelation
[52:08] amen in the position and the power that
[52:10] comes with that revelation that he wants
[52:12] to give
[52:12] to the bride and unlock under her is
[52:16] very deadly
[52:19] and the only way that god can unlock
[52:22] more is when he brings the affliction
[52:25] and the reproach and the necessities
[52:27] necessary to mold the character so that
[52:30] the
[52:30] the character rises to a level that god
[52:33] can unlock more
[52:35] so we keep praying for more revelation
[52:37] who has prayed for more revelation in
[52:39] the last couple of years
[52:40] well welcome to the show right
[52:44] we prayed for more revelation but but
[52:46] god cannot
[52:47] i mean god has predestinated this bride
[52:50] not to fall
[52:51] he must ensure that she will not fall
[52:53] god had predestinated the apostle paul
[52:56] and to the work that the apostle paul
[52:57] was going to do there was no one else
[52:59] that could do that job
[53:01] so god had to get the apostle paul into
[53:03] a place where god could give him an
[53:05] abundance of revelation
[53:06] but that that abundance of revelation
[53:08] would not corrupt paul
[53:10] and the only way that he could give him
[53:12] such revelation on the word
[53:14] was to bring such affliction in need and
[53:16] reproach
[53:17] that paul would not get lifted up no
[53:20] matter
[53:20] how much revelation god poured on
[53:23] because
[53:24] paul could not exalt himself because he
[53:26] was so abased
[53:31] god's love to paul and his affliction
[53:33] was better
[53:34] was a better love than he had the
[53:36] lucifer in his perfection
[53:41] amen i say god i thank you for what
[53:45] you're doing
[53:47] i thank you lord it's it it's
[53:50] put a put me in it's put me in a
[53:52] straight it's put me in contention
[53:54] it's put me in distress and i thank you
[53:56] for it lord
[53:58] i needed it let's go to isaiah chapter
[54:08] 6.
[54:10] how many believes god's going to unlock
[54:11] more of his word for us
[54:14] [Laughter]
[54:16] you just said it
[54:19] you just did it if he's going to then
[54:24] he's going to have to unlock
[54:26] more troubles
[54:29] trials pressures
[54:34] because it's only in humility
[54:38] and of a contrite spirit and humility
[54:40] and brokenness
[54:41] that god can give such authority and
[54:44] power
[54:46] isaiah 6 1 in the year that king uzziah
[54:50] died i saw also the lord sitting upon a
[54:52] throne high and lifted up
[54:54] and his train filled the temple above it
[54:56] stood the seraphims and
[54:57] one had six swings with twain he covered
[55:00] his face and with twain he covered his
[55:02] feet and with twain he did fly
[55:04] and one cried unto thee another and said
[55:06] holy holy holy is the lord of hosts
[55:09] the whole earth is full of his glory and
[55:11] the post of the door moved at the voice
[55:13] of him that cried
[55:14] and the house was filled with smoke then
[55:16] said i woe is me for i am a man undone
[55:18] because i am a man of unclean lips
[55:20] and i dwell in the midst of a people of
[55:22] unclean lips for mine
[55:24] eyes have seen the king the lord of
[55:26] hosts
[55:27] so isaiah's revelation amen did not
[55:30] exalt
[55:31] isaiah isaiah's revelation abased isaiah
[55:34] because when isaiah saw the holiness of
[55:36] god and the holy worship of the
[55:37] seraphims
[55:38] he realized that he was nothing and that
[55:41] he was unclean a man of unclean lips
[55:43] and he was abased by the revelation
[55:46] and here's what brother brahm says in
[55:48] the message influence from 63
[55:51] let's think he with two wings he had
[55:53] over his face
[55:54] in the presence of god humility or
[55:56] reverence and secondly
[55:58] he had two wings over his feet what was
[56:00] it in humility
[56:01] and third he flew with them but but put
[56:04] himself in
[56:05] action he put himself in action with two
[56:08] wings while two more wings covered his
[56:10] face in reverence
[56:11] two wings covered his feet humility two
[56:13] wings he was in action
[56:15] what was he doing he was showing the
[56:17] prophet
[56:18] by this he was showing the prophet how
[56:20] his prepared servants must be
[56:23] god god prepared service must be
[56:26] reverent humble and in action
[56:30] later he preaches influence again at the
[56:32] end of the year he says now
[56:33] in closing i might use these other two
[56:36] wings thirdly
[56:37] he could fly with these other two wings
[56:39] watch face covered by the holiness of
[56:41] god
[56:41] and in reverence his feet covered in
[56:43] humility and with two wings he could put
[56:45] himself in action to move
[56:48] god was showing his prophet how a
[56:50] prepared servant
[56:51] ought to be quit looking at uzziah
[56:54] here is your example i've set before you
[56:56] cover your face and reverence
[56:58] cover your feet in humility and go into
[57:00] action oh what an
[57:01] example he had looked at uzziah so long
[57:04] and seen it fail
[57:06] now god is telling him what to do show
[57:08] him a prepared servant
[57:09] he went into action so god through the
[57:12] vision was showing isaiah
[57:14] isaiah had watched uzziah but uzziah
[57:16] could not keep himself in humility
[57:20] isaiah was lifted up because he was king
[57:22] and when he was lifted up as king
[57:24] he thought he could transgress the word
[57:26] of god he thought that god had blessed
[57:28] him so much
[57:29] that he had risen to such a level his
[57:31] kingdom was such his blessing was such
[57:33] he was chosen of god placed of god amen
[57:37] he was defended by god and he was
[57:39] blessed by god
[57:40] so much that he thought he could
[57:42] transgress the word and he could go in
[57:44] and offer incense which only the priest
[57:46] could do
[57:48] and god is no respecter of person no
[57:51] matter how much uziah was
[57:52] chosen no matter how much he was placed
[57:54] no matter how much he was blessed
[57:56] as soon as he transgressed the word of
[57:58] god he was smitten with leprosy
[58:02] and isaiah had watched the blessings of
[58:06] uzziah
[58:06] the king the the anointed of god the
[58:09] place of god and he'll watch these
[58:11] blessings
[58:11] and he was he was really just following
[58:14] along with uzziah
[58:16] but he saw uzziah fail in humility
[58:19] and in reverence so god
[58:22] opens up a window in heaven and shows
[58:24] him amen in heaven he shows the lord
[58:27] high and lifted up and his train filled
[58:29] the temple and he sees the seraphims
[58:31] amen the holy seraph as brother benham
[58:33] said that had never
[58:34] sinned before
[58:38] god is so holy that the sinless
[58:40] creatures in heaven that worship him
[58:42] have to cover their face in huma and
[58:44] reverence and their feet and humility
[58:46] and he said he showed them in reverence
[58:48] and in humility
[58:50] and in action see the action
[58:53] doesn't work unless there's reverence in
[58:55] humility
[58:57] a prepared servant of god must be
[59:00] reverent
[59:01] humble and in action and
[59:04] sometimes we think all the works that we
[59:07] do
[59:07] amen are the things that matter but the
[59:10] action was the third part the reverence
[59:12] and humility was the first
[59:14] we've got to get reverence and humility
[59:16] first and then get into action
[59:20] that's god's plan
[59:23] but human beings just like lucifer has
[59:25] such a trouble
[59:27] cain had such trouble it's amazing that
[59:31] god when when god was going to bring his
[59:34] word he was going to bring a deliverance
[59:36] he was going to bring his children
[59:37] out of egypt amen he already had a
[59:39] chosen vessel named moses and moses was
[59:42] the chosen vessel of god
[59:44] and moses was raised with all the
[59:46] education with all the understanding
[59:48] with all the
[59:49] wealth and blessing of egypt as a son to
[59:52] pharaoh
[59:54] but god allowed that for a reason amen
[59:57] and with all that wisdom and with all
[59:59] that power
[1:00:00] amen he could do nothing for the kingdom
[1:00:03] of god
[1:00:05] he tried he put forth an effort he was
[1:00:07] rejected he ran away
[1:00:08] defeated into the wilderness and he and
[1:00:10] he left egypt defeated
[1:00:12] he left he left egypt rejected and
[1:00:15] dejected
[1:00:17] and for 40 years god worked to strip all
[1:00:20] that out of him
[1:00:24] i think god let it get put in him so god
[1:00:27] could strip it out of him so moses could
[1:00:28] realize that's not going to work
[1:00:31] 40 years of of the best education
[1:00:35] the the the best food the best military
[1:00:37] training the best of everything science
[1:00:39] and literature
[1:00:40] the best of everything produced nothing
[1:00:43] for god
[1:00:44] although he was the right man and the
[1:00:46] right season
[1:00:48] amen but he was using
[1:00:51] worldly wisdom and it didn't work so god
[1:00:54] let him go as
[1:00:54] rejected into the wilderness until moses
[1:00:57] got to the place
[1:00:58] where he he believed himself to be so
[1:01:01] incapable
[1:01:02] that when god come down in a burning
[1:01:04] bush through a supernatural encounter
[1:01:05] and spoke to him directly and said go he
[1:01:08] was so convinced he couldn't do it that
[1:01:10] he that he began to argue with god
[1:01:14] maybe you can say send somebody else oh
[1:01:16] god
[1:01:17] no not me send somebody else i can't do
[1:01:19] it i can't speak they won't listen to me
[1:01:21] he had he had so many excuses because
[1:01:24] god had finally got him to where he
[1:01:25] wanted him to be
[1:01:26] he was a base he knew he was worthless
[1:01:29] he knew he was incapable
[1:01:32] so what was the rejection in the
[1:01:34] wilderness journey about
[1:01:35] it was the getting to that place right
[1:01:37] there
[1:01:39] god wasn't not building up his
[1:01:41] self-esteem
[1:01:44] in the wilderness he wasn't building up
[1:01:46] his prestige and his wisdom and
[1:01:48] he wasn't building any of that he was
[1:01:50] breaking him down to humility
[1:01:52] amen to where he became a simple herder
[1:01:59] and god took him when he was low and
[1:02:01] incapable
[1:02:02] and unable and he marched him right back
[1:02:06] into the same place he was before
[1:02:09] and he left in his strength
[1:02:12] he left and he left capable and able to
[1:02:16] do something
[1:02:18] he came back completely incapable and
[1:02:21] unable to do anything
[1:02:23] and when he got to that place god put
[1:02:26] into
[1:02:27] into his servant's hands the spoken word
[1:02:29] of god
[1:02:30] the power to create where there was
[1:02:32] nothing before
[1:02:38] and then by moses through moses and
[1:02:41] in moses god did acts upon the earth
[1:02:45] amen that the earth had not seen
[1:02:49] and he delivered them with a mighty hand
[1:02:50] using moses using moses mouth using
[1:02:53] moses's body
[1:02:56] but not when moses was strong but when
[1:02:58] moses was weak
[1:03:00] and god would take that man and pour
[1:03:03] such an abundance of revelation into him
[1:03:05] that he would write the old testament he
[1:03:07] would write the law he would write the
[1:03:09] word that would set the stage
[1:03:11] for 4 000 years of judaism
[1:03:19] and then when it was time to write the
[1:03:21] new testament
[1:03:23] he did the exact same thing
[1:03:26] he took the apostle paul who was raised
[1:03:29] up
[1:03:30] a jew raised up a pharisee among
[1:03:32] pharisees
[1:03:33] of the tribe of benjamin raised up in
[1:03:35] the school of gamaliel
[1:03:36] he had everything going for him as a jew
[1:03:40] he had i mean he had prestige amongst
[1:03:42] the priests
[1:03:43] he had camaraderie amongst the priests
[1:03:45] he he was given letters from the high
[1:03:47] priest
[1:03:48] he had everything he needed to be
[1:03:51] everything that he wanted to be for the
[1:03:53] kingdom of god
[1:03:55] and god allowed it to go in just like
[1:03:57] moses the old testament and new
[1:03:59] testament pattern one another
[1:04:01] one's a shadow of the other and here
[1:04:04] comes the apostle paul
[1:04:05] he's moving down zealous to do something
[1:04:07] in his strength and then his power with
[1:04:09] his connections and his intellect
[1:04:11] do something for god and god strikes him
[1:04:13] down he meets the pillar of fire
[1:04:15] he's blinded and he's a based
[1:04:18] and now he goes blind led by the hand
[1:04:21] into the city
[1:04:22] into a house waiting for somebody that
[1:04:26] the very person he came to arrest
[1:04:29] the very ones he came to persecute and
[1:04:32] arrest and throw in the prison
[1:04:34] now he's got to be so humble the very
[1:04:36] one he on his high horse came to arrest
[1:04:38] and thrown in jail
[1:04:39] is the very one god's going to send to
[1:04:41] lay hands on him so he can receive his
[1:04:43] sight
[1:04:44] and speak to him commandments of the
[1:04:45] word of the lord and then he was going
[1:04:47] to go out
[1:04:48] into the desert in arabia and in the
[1:04:50] desert god was not building him up
[1:04:52] god was stripping him down
[1:04:57] and then when paul finally believed he
[1:05:00] knew nothing
[1:05:03] he gave up all his ability his prestige
[1:05:05] his connections
[1:05:07] god used him to write the new testament
[1:05:12] see god doesn't work the way man works
[1:05:16] god will take what's exalted and he'll
[1:05:19] bring it low so he can use it because he
[1:05:21] can't use it up here he can only use it
[1:05:23] down here
[1:05:24] he brought moses down here he brought
[1:05:25] the apostle paul down here
[1:05:27] and when it was broken and it was
[1:05:29] humbled and it was humiliated
[1:05:31] he was ready to use it
[1:05:35] when god in the old testament he he
[1:05:38] worked through moses that way but when
[1:05:40] it came time to announce when there was
[1:05:42] time for a forerunner to come
[1:05:43] to announce that christ was coming upon
[1:05:45] the earth amen he did it different this
[1:05:48] time
[1:05:48] he took somebody amen the john the
[1:05:51] baptist and sent him to the wilderness
[1:05:52] when he was a boy
[1:05:53] and did not let him get an education did
[1:05:56] not let him get indoctrinated
[1:05:58] did not let him learn culture or
[1:05:59] civilization or
[1:06:01] nothing he was raised in the wilderness
[1:06:03] because god needed a clean slate because
[1:06:05] he had such a job to do
[1:06:06] he had to come not knowing anything
[1:06:11] ignorant amen unlearned incapable amen
[1:06:15] no religious training no nothing
[1:06:18] and god could take that humble creature
[1:06:21] that was
[1:06:21] was clothed in camel's hair eating
[1:06:23] locust and honey
[1:06:26] and in humility he would become the
[1:06:28] forerunner and announcer of the coming
[1:06:30] of christ to earth
[1:06:32] so if that's the old testament pattern
[1:06:35] what do you think the new testament
[1:06:36] pattern is
[1:06:38] when it came time for for another
[1:06:41] forerunner amen god
[1:06:42] would take a a would take a man out of
[1:06:46] the hills of kentucky
[1:06:47] amen one of the most laughed at places
[1:06:49] in the united states
[1:06:51] one of the most backwards dejected and
[1:06:53] rejected places in the united states
[1:06:56] amen there's a lot of jokes told about
[1:06:58] that area
[1:07:01] he wouldn't let him get a formal
[1:07:03] education but his education was cut
[1:07:06] short
[1:07:07] no religious training whatsoever
[1:07:10] you see the pattern old testament new
[1:07:12] testament
[1:07:16] because what was he doing he was
[1:07:17] announcing his coming
[1:07:20] and god would take utter humility
[1:07:24] no seminary training no connections in
[1:07:27] the religious world
[1:07:29] no formal education no intellect no
[1:07:32] prestige no power no might no strength
[1:07:34] no nothing but ignorant and backward
[1:07:36] uncivilized amen when when finally the
[1:07:39] angel of the lord spoke to him and told
[1:07:40] him to take a gift of healing to the
[1:07:41] peoples of the world amen the prophet of
[1:07:43] god didn't even have a proper suit
[1:07:45] he pieced together a coat and a pair of
[1:07:47] pants and his coat had a rip
[1:07:49] aim and the pocket was ripped off he
[1:07:50] stitched it together himself and he was
[1:07:52] so ashamed of it he would hold his right
[1:07:54] hand over it to hide it amen and he
[1:07:56] would stick out his left hand
[1:07:58] and he would say pardon the left hand
[1:08:00] it's closer to my heart
[1:08:05] shaking his left hand it's closer to my
[1:08:07] heart and he didn't want people to see
[1:08:09] his humility and his shame and his
[1:08:12] raggedness
[1:08:14] and what was happening while he was
[1:08:16] walking in that ragged coat
[1:08:18] god was opening blinded eyes he was
[1:08:20] healing the sick
[1:08:21] lepers were being delivered amen he was
[1:08:23] doing miracle pulling miracle
[1:08:25] eight days straight amen i mean where
[1:08:27] there's thousands and thousands and
[1:08:29] thousands of healings
[1:08:30] amen and god uses something so humble so
[1:08:32] ignorant
[1:08:33] so broken so unconnected to do the most
[1:08:36] marvelous things that we have
[1:08:38] in recorded history
[1:08:45] i don't think we're ready yet
[1:08:51] i think god is making us ready
[1:08:57] i think god
[1:09:02] is going to continue to strip all self
[1:09:06] away
[1:09:08] self will self desire
[1:09:11] self respect
[1:09:17] self dependency
[1:09:21] self-esteem i think god's going to
[1:09:24] continue
[1:09:27] and i just say it for me i want to go
[1:09:30] willingly
[1:09:31] i want to make this process as easy as
[1:09:33] possible
[1:09:35] i want to humble myself i want to abase
[1:09:38] myself
[1:09:39] i don't want god to have to turn up the
[1:09:41] temperature
[1:09:42] amen to get me where i need to be
[1:09:44] because i believe i'm one of them i
[1:09:46] believe beyond a shadow of a doubt i'm
[1:09:47] one of them
[1:09:48] i believe god's going to do a work and
[1:09:49] i'm here for that work
[1:09:51] i believe it but god's got to get the
[1:09:52] character to match the work
[1:09:54] [Music]
[1:09:55] and i want to say right now lord i lay
[1:09:58] my life down i surrender
[1:09:59] all i do not want to have self-esteem
[1:10:02] self-will self-pride
[1:10:03] i don't want to have self-sufficiency i
[1:10:06] don't want anything of self
[1:10:07] i am nothing i know i'm nothing i'm
[1:10:09] incapable i'm unable
[1:10:11] i have nothing to offer i have nothing
[1:10:13] that you can use
[1:10:15] i don't have wisdom i don't have a
[1:10:17] strength i don't have
[1:10:19] money i don't i have nothing that you
[1:10:21] want
[1:10:23] nothing that i can do to help you along
[1:10:27] all i have is this vessel and i give it
[1:10:28] to you
[1:10:31] god is god is going to use these
[1:10:33] circumstances to get us where we need to
[1:10:35] be
[1:10:36] but let's just be willing
[1:10:39] willing to fall upon the stone and be
[1:10:41] broken again
[1:10:43] and fall upon the stone and be broken
[1:10:45] again and fall upon the stone and be
[1:10:46] broken again
[1:10:48] look at what god uses you have lucifer
[1:10:50] and michael
[1:10:51] look at the attitude of lucifer look at
[1:10:53] the attitude of michael
[1:10:54] you have cain and abel look at the
[1:10:56] attitude of cain and look at
[1:10:58] look at abel abel was replaced with seth
[1:11:01] seth
[1:11:02] line became herdsmen brother bram said
[1:11:04] simple
[1:11:05] simple herdsmens cain's lines became
[1:11:08] manufacturers
[1:11:10] amen makers of music and cities and
[1:11:12] manufacturing and metals
[1:11:15] in science and learning
[1:11:18] look at the difference between pharaoh
[1:11:20] and moses
[1:11:22] when moses came marching back into egypt
[1:11:25] look at the difference between jesus and
[1:11:27] caiaphas
[1:11:32] you see which side do you want to be on
[1:11:36] i say i'll take the lowly side i'll take
[1:11:39] the humble side the base side
[1:11:42] the side that has nothing can do nothing
[1:11:47] can offer nothing that's the side that i
[1:11:50] want to be on
[1:11:51] like seth and the herdsmen not cain and
[1:11:54] the brilliant ones
[1:11:56] who figured everything out
[1:11:59] so wise that they could build a tower
[1:12:01] unto heaven
[1:12:03] i would rather be like seth lyon the
[1:12:05] little herdsman
[1:12:06] who's just content hurting the flock and
[1:12:08] taking care of my family
[1:12:11] just content with the portion god gave
[1:12:13] me michael was content with the portion
[1:12:16] god gave him lucifer was not content
[1:12:18] with his portion
[1:12:19] no matter how great a magnificent a
[1:12:21] portion it was it was a greatest portion
[1:12:24] in heaven
[1:12:24] outside of michael's and he wasn't
[1:12:26] content with it
[1:12:30] i said god help me let's turn to
[1:12:33] philippians chapter 3.
[1:12:44] philippians chapter 3.
[1:12:50] and verse 4 i'll say it this way
[1:12:56] if we can't say it today with an honest
[1:12:59] heart
[1:13:00] i'm nothing i know nothing
[1:13:03] i can do nothing in my flesh
[1:13:06] i have nothing that i can offer him
[1:13:09] that'll do him any good
[1:13:11] that'll improve him any
[1:13:14] if we can't say that now i believe by
[1:13:17] the time this is over we will be able to
[1:13:19] say that
[1:13:22] philippians chapter 3 verse 4
[1:13:28] though i might also have confidence in
[1:13:30] the flesh if any other man thinketh that
[1:13:32] he had whereof he might trust in the
[1:13:34] flesh i more
[1:13:36] circumcised the eighth day of the stock
[1:13:38] of israel of the tribe of benjamin
[1:13:40] a hebrew of the hebrews as touching the
[1:13:42] law of pharisee
[1:13:44] concerning zeal persecuting the church
[1:13:47] touching the righteousness which is in
[1:13:48] the law blameless
[1:13:50] but what things were gained to me those
[1:13:52] i counted lost for christ
[1:13:54] yea doubtless and i count all things but
[1:13:56] lost for the excellency of the knowledge
[1:13:58] of christ jesus my lord for whom i have
[1:14:00] suffered the loss of all things and do
[1:14:02] count them but dung
[1:14:03] that i may win christ and be found in
[1:14:06] him not having mine own righteousness
[1:14:08] which is of the law
[1:14:09] but that which is through the faith of
[1:14:11] christ the righteousness which is of god
[1:14:13] by faith
[1:14:14] that i may know him and the power of his
[1:14:16] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:14:18] sufferings
[1:14:19] being made conformable unto his death if
[1:14:22] by any means i might attain into the
[1:14:24] resurrection of the dead
[1:14:25] not as though i had already attained
[1:14:26] either were already perfect
[1:14:28] but i follow after if that i may
[1:14:30] apprehend that for which also i am
[1:14:32] apprehended of christ jesus
[1:14:35] brethren i count not myself to apprehend
[1:14:37] it but this one thing i do forgetting
[1:14:39] those things which are behind
[1:14:40] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:14:42] which are before i press toward the mark
[1:14:45] for the prize of the high calling of god
[1:14:47] in christ jesus
[1:14:48] let us therefore as many as be perfect
[1:14:50] be thus minded and if any
[1:14:52] and if anything you be otherwise minded
[1:14:54] god shall reveal even this
[1:14:55] unto you nevertheless where do we have
[1:14:58] already attained
[1:14:59] let us walk by the same rule let us mind
[1:15:02] the same thing even
[1:15:05] and even in the area you've already
[1:15:07] attained have the same mind that you're
[1:15:09] pressing on
[1:15:10] that you're growing more that you're
[1:15:12] pressing towards the mark of the high
[1:15:13] calling in christ
[1:15:14] that you've not already arrived
[1:15:17] i've arrived in the plan of god i've
[1:15:20] arrived in the perfection of god
[1:15:22] but god in this life has me still on the
[1:15:25] journey of perfection
[1:15:27] getting my character to where he wants
[1:15:29] it to be to do what he wants to do in
[1:15:30] this life
[1:15:33] and i say god let me be like paul
[1:15:39] let me count everything but lost that i
[1:15:40] might win you
[1:15:43] that i might just win you
[1:15:47] we'll look at two more scriptures as we
[1:15:48] close let's go to matthew 18.
[1:16:05] matthew 18 1
[1:16:10] at the same time came the disciples unto
[1:16:12] jesus saying who is greatest in the
[1:16:14] kingdom of heaven
[1:16:16] and jesus called a little child unto him
[1:16:18] and set him in the midst of them
[1:16:20] and said verily i say unto you except
[1:16:21] you be converted and become as little
[1:16:23] children
[1:16:24] you shall not enter the kingdom of
[1:16:26] heaven
[1:16:28] whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[1:16:31] as this little child the same is
[1:16:33] greatest
[1:16:34] in the kingdom of heaven
[1:16:37] now we've got god's idea on it this is
[1:16:41] what christ thought
[1:16:43] the disciples were in many places in the
[1:16:46] scriptures they're
[1:16:47] arguing amongst themselves who will be
[1:16:48] greatest and who will have this position
[1:16:50] who will sit on the right hand and who
[1:16:52] will sit on the left when he comes into
[1:16:53] his kingdom
[1:16:54] and they had no idea what sacrifice it
[1:16:56] was going to take for him to come into
[1:16:58] that kingdom
[1:17:00] they had no idea what they were even
[1:17:02] really talking about
[1:17:03] they had felt good because they were
[1:17:05] with them they were in the campaigns
[1:17:06] they saw the miracles they
[1:17:08] they had passed out the bread that was
[1:17:10] broken they they had they had been
[1:17:12] part of the two by two that were sent
[1:17:14] out and they had saw miracles and demons
[1:17:16] cast out
[1:17:17] and they were just enthused and excited
[1:17:19] about being part of this ministry
[1:17:21] amen and so they began the the question
[1:17:24] who's the greatest and
[1:17:25] how do we know and and you know why do
[1:17:27] you ask the question who's the greatest
[1:17:30] unless you think one of them might be
[1:17:31] eating like you're a contender
[1:17:35] do you understand when you know you're
[1:17:37] nothing you don't even care i mean
[1:17:39] everybody else is greater than me so
[1:17:41] why even ask the question
[1:17:44] true humility doesn't is not concerned
[1:17:46] with who's on top
[1:17:48] who's the greatest one who's the most
[1:17:50] revelated who has the best understanding
[1:17:53] i mean who who has the best life when
[1:17:55] you're the lowest you're not even in
[1:17:56] contention so it's not even a question
[1:17:58] in your mind
[1:18:00] you know you know that you're in the
[1:18:02] bottom half of the bottom half
[1:18:06] so who's the greatest well it's going to
[1:18:07] be one of them out there
[1:18:10] but see the the whole debate was because
[1:18:13] they thought
[1:18:13] that possibly they were a contender for
[1:18:15] top place
[1:18:18] and so jesus in his wisdom he mean he
[1:18:21] gives them a lesson they'll never forget
[1:18:23] he brings a little child along and he
[1:18:24] puts a little child in their midst
[1:18:27] he said unless you humble yourself
[1:18:33] and become like one of these little
[1:18:34] children
[1:18:36] you shall not even see the kingdom
[1:18:40] don't even worry about who's greatest
[1:18:44] if you can't humble yourself and be like
[1:18:46] this child
[1:18:48] you won't even see it whosoever can
[1:18:51] humble themselves
[1:18:52] themselves and be like a child they
[1:18:54] shall be greatest
[1:18:55] in the kingdom of heaven where do you
[1:18:58] think brother branham gets the statement
[1:19:00] the way up is down
[1:19:03] right out of the scriptures the way up
[1:19:06] is down
[1:19:07] to become like a little child innocent
[1:19:10] submissive
[1:19:11] trusting believing just taking the word
[1:19:15] at face value just taking what he said
[1:19:16] and believing
[1:19:17] and standing on it and not reasoning and
[1:19:19] not figuring it out amen the little
[1:19:21] child
[1:19:22] doesn't figure out amen if daddy tells
[1:19:24] him something he believes that he's
[1:19:26] going to do it and he doesn't have to
[1:19:27] reason it out
[1:19:29] and he doesn't have to figure out how
[1:19:30] it's going to happen if daddy said it
[1:19:32] daddy means
[1:19:33] it's going to happen we need to be like
[1:19:35] little children
[1:19:37] without malice without contention
[1:19:39] without our own wisdom injected
[1:19:43] see there's two sides to us friends
[1:19:47] there's the god side in the human side
[1:19:52] and i think sometimes we try to make the
[1:19:54] human side equal to the god side
[1:19:59] and we say things
[1:20:02] uh
[1:20:06] sometimes we say things in a way
[1:20:11] to where i think that it's possible
[1:20:14] that we can corrupt ourselves with our
[1:20:16] own wisdom
[1:20:18] and our own revelation
[1:20:21] like we understand where we came from
[1:20:24] and where we're going
[1:20:27] we understand the plan of god from
[1:20:29] before the foundation of the world all
[1:20:31] the way through to the
[1:20:32] end we've been given illumination and
[1:20:35] we've got a certain brightness a certain
[1:20:37] splendor in revelation
[1:20:43] but paul was able to say i've not yet
[1:20:46] attained
[1:20:49] i've not yet apprehended that which but
[1:20:51] i'm apprehended by
[1:20:55] i don't think paul was talking about the
[1:20:57] spiritual side
[1:20:58] he's talking about the flesh side
[1:21:02] and see we can say things in such a way
[1:21:04] that we can be corrupted by our own
[1:21:06] splendor and our own brightness
[1:21:08] and not realize that there's areas in
[1:21:12] our lives that don't match the word
[1:21:14] and somehow because i know where i came
[1:21:16] from and i know where i'm going it's
[1:21:18] okay
[1:21:20] like there's areas of compromise and
[1:21:23] areas
[1:21:25] of ungodliness and there's areas
[1:21:28] that that don't match the scripture and
[1:21:31] but because we are so revelated have
[1:21:33] such an understanding
[1:21:34] amen and we believe we're children of
[1:21:36] god where we came from where we're going
[1:21:38] that somehow that these things can go
[1:21:40] unchecked in our lives and it's okay
[1:21:47] i say let's not be corrupted by our own
[1:21:49] brightness
[1:21:52] if anything let the brightness shine
[1:21:53] down inside and say lord let the
[1:21:56] brightness of your word expose all my
[1:21:58] bads
[1:22:00] don't let me use the brightness of your
[1:22:02] word to cover my bads
[1:22:04] but let the brightness of your word
[1:22:05] expose expose the pride
[1:22:08] expose the arrogancy amen expose the
[1:22:11] the lies that i tell myself to expose
[1:22:14] the hypocrisy
[1:22:19] sometimes we want the light to shine out
[1:22:23] but i want the light to shine in
[1:22:27] night the bright light of revelation to
[1:22:30] shine in
[1:22:32] because i don't believe revelation came
[1:22:35] to cover my error
[1:22:40] in a way that i don't have to deal with
[1:22:42] it and just ignore but i believe the
[1:22:43] revelation came to lift me
[1:22:45] up into a higher plane to live the very
[1:22:48] life that jesus christ lived
[1:22:52] i believe that's the purpose of
[1:22:53] revelation to bring us into a place
[1:22:55] where it's not us it's him it's not my
[1:22:58] dues
[1:22:59] it's not it's not my efforts it's him i
[1:23:01] surrendered all
[1:23:02] but i'm not going to keep pretending
[1:23:05] that i'm pretending that but let the
[1:23:07] light shine until i can come to reality
[1:23:10] with where i
[1:23:10] am lord i need you in this area of my
[1:23:14] life lord i need help in this
[1:23:15] lord i need you to root this out of me
[1:23:17] this is not pleasing to you
[1:23:19] god i need you i'm not going to use my
[1:23:21] splendor to allow corruption to grow
[1:23:23] and i keep hidden something that i need
[1:23:25] to be exposing
[1:23:31] lucifer was corrupted by his brightness
[1:23:33] by his wisdom by his perfection
[1:23:37] and say god let me not be corrupted amen
[1:23:41] but let me be ground down to
[1:23:44] nothing and rebuilt by your revelation
[1:23:48] let me humble myself as a child and be
[1:23:51] honest
[1:23:54] i've seen so many things that trouble me
[1:23:59] in myself outside myself so many times
[1:24:04] justifications for actions are given
[1:24:06] with a religious tone
[1:24:09] with a quote misused to justify
[1:24:14] my own willful desire
[1:24:17] we've seen it we've all seen it we've
[1:24:19] all experienced it
[1:24:20] we've probably all tried to do it if we
[1:24:22] just be honest with ourselves
[1:24:25] find a justificati you know i i really
[1:24:28] have a desire for this and i have a
[1:24:30] desire to do that and if i could just
[1:24:32] find a quote
[1:24:36] when we know in ourselves it's not what
[1:24:38] god wants
[1:24:41] but let the word lord expose me and root
[1:24:44] out all selfishness and all of self
[1:24:48] i want to base myself i want to become
[1:24:50] like that little child
[1:24:51] and be honest lord and be truthful
[1:24:58] praise god i think
[1:25:01] sometimes i think what i've seen
[1:25:04] sometimes
[1:25:06] is sometimes people become more dogmatic
[1:25:09] in the message
[1:25:11] to cover the own rottenness on the
[1:25:13] inside
[1:25:17] more dogmatic and make everybody else
[1:25:20] around them feel like an unbeliever
[1:25:25] point out flaws and point out this off
[1:25:27] the word and point out this
[1:25:32] sometimes i want to say brother quit
[1:25:33] pointing out everybody else's fault
[1:25:34] let's talk about yours for a while
[1:25:37] you've got such brightness that you can
[1:25:39] see flaws anywhere you've
[1:25:41] got a gift now let's use that gift on
[1:25:44] you for a few minutes
[1:25:48] and then all of a sudden the whole
[1:25:49] attitude changes
[1:25:52] i don't want that to be me
[1:25:56] if i ever do a fault-finding trip i want
[1:25:58] to do it right in my own heart
[1:26:01] and whatever i find i want to lay it
[1:26:03] before the lord and say god i need some
[1:26:05] help with this
[1:26:06] this doesn't match your word this isn't
[1:26:08] pleasing to you this is not what you
[1:26:09] want
[1:26:11] amen what kind of bride is he looking
[1:26:14] for
[1:26:15] one that's just like the bridegroom
[1:26:23] brother brenham said he talked about
[1:26:27] he went to that pentecostal meeting and
[1:26:29] the pastor was talking to him and
[1:26:31] all of a sudden the pastor introduced
[1:26:32] his wife
[1:26:34] and she said she had bob tear all
[1:26:36] painted up jewelry on and all this stuff
[1:26:39] and he said i i can't remember the exact
[1:26:41] words that he used but
[1:26:43] he said i thought you said your wife was
[1:26:44] a saint
[1:26:46] said she looks more like a hate
[1:26:51] and brother branham could judge that man
[1:26:55] by his wife
[1:27:00] because brother brown tells us in
[1:27:02] choosing a bride
[1:27:03] the kind of woman that a man will choose
[1:27:05] reflects what kind of character is on
[1:27:06] the inside
[1:27:10] so what kind of bride is christ choosing
[1:27:12] he's choosing a bride that reflects the
[1:27:14] character that's on the inside of him
[1:27:17] christ could come in utter humility he
[1:27:19] could come as a baby and a manger born
[1:27:21] over a manure pile
[1:27:23] god would he come in flesh that way he
[1:27:25] could come in such simplicity and such
[1:27:27] humility
[1:27:28] and jesus could be ill-spoken of and not
[1:27:30] speak evil back
[1:27:31] he could be smitten and not smite back
[1:27:33] amen he could subdue himself
[1:27:35] he could subdue his own nature and then
[1:27:36] he could humble himself
[1:27:38] and if he can do that his bride can do
[1:27:40] it too
[1:27:42] if he can live in humility if he could
[1:27:44] surrender his will amen to the plan of
[1:27:47] god
[1:27:47] then his bride can do it the same way if
[1:27:49] he can go through gethsemane then his
[1:27:51] bride can go through gethsemane as well
[1:27:55] if he could stand there and be crucified
[1:28:01] for to fulfill the word of god and the
[1:28:03] will of god
[1:28:05] his bride can stand and be crucified too
[1:28:12] i said god that's the life i want to
[1:28:14] live
[1:28:16] let's go to first corinthians i want to
[1:28:18] finish with this scripture
[1:28:24] first corinthians chapter 1.
[1:28:36] first corinthians 25 or chapter 1 and
[1:28:39] verse 25.
[1:28:40] musicians you can go ahead and make your
[1:28:42] way up and brother ben if you could come
[1:28:44] first corinthians 1 and 25 because the
[1:28:47] foolishness of god
[1:28:48] is wiser than men and the weakness of
[1:28:51] god
[1:28:52] is stronger than men for you see your
[1:28:55] calling brother and how that not many
[1:28:57] wise men after the flesh not many mighty
[1:28:59] many noble are called
[1:29:01] but god has chosen the foolish things of
[1:29:03] this world to confound the wise
[1:29:05] and god has chosen the weak things of
[1:29:07] the world to confound the things which
[1:29:08] are mighty
[1:29:10] and base things of the world and things
[1:29:12] which are despised have god chosen yea
[1:29:14] and things which are not
[1:29:15] to bring them not things that are that
[1:29:18] no flesh should glory in his presence
[1:29:20] but of him are ye in christ jesus who of
[1:29:23] god has made unto us wisdom
[1:29:25] and righteousness and sanctification and
[1:29:27] redemption
[1:29:28] that according as it is written he that
[1:29:30] glorieth led him glory
[1:29:32] in the lord lord let's all stand
[1:29:37] the scripture says he's chosen the
[1:29:39] foolish things of the world
[1:29:42] who wants to be foolish now
[1:29:47] he's chosen the weak things of the world
[1:29:49] who wants to be weak now
[1:29:53] you see if god wants to take the weak
[1:29:57] the foolish the rejected the downcast
[1:30:01] the
[1:30:01] nobodies so that no flesh can glory in
[1:30:04] his presence so that he can do a work
[1:30:05] through nothing
[1:30:06] then my goal is to be nothing my goal is
[1:30:10] to be
[1:30:10] foolish in the eyes of the world to be
[1:30:12] weak in the eyes of the world
[1:30:14] to be nothing because if i can become
[1:30:16] that
[1:30:17] then that's the very thing that he's
[1:30:18] looking for to show himself mighty and
[1:30:21] to do his work through
[1:30:23] so if we believe romans 16 that the god
[1:30:28] of all peace shall brew satan shortly
[1:30:29] under your feet what kind of vessel is
[1:30:32] he looking for to brew
[1:30:34] satan under your feet he's looking for
[1:30:37] weakness humility foolishness
[1:30:42] he's not looking for somebody who's got
[1:30:44] it all figured out and knows the answer
[1:30:45] to everything
[1:30:46] he's looking for somebody who doesn't
[1:30:48] know what's coming next and how to
[1:30:49] handle it
[1:30:51] he's looking for somebody who who
[1:30:53] doesn't know what the chaos in the world
[1:30:55] is going to equal to and what we're
[1:30:57] going to do next and how we're going to
[1:30:58] make the next decision and what he's
[1:30:59] eating the right thing to do is next
[1:31:02] that's what he's looking for and so i i
[1:31:06] myself
[1:31:06] am tired of trying to have the pressure
[1:31:08] of having it all figured out
[1:31:10] i decided i'm going to become foolish
[1:31:15] next time you ask me brother chad what
[1:31:16] do you think's going to happen next i'm
[1:31:17] going to tell you i have
[1:31:18] absolutely no idea
[1:31:22] do you think this could go this way and
[1:31:24] this could go that way sure
[1:31:26] but it may not and i don't know i have
[1:31:30] no idea
[1:31:31] all i know is he's got to figure it out
[1:31:33] i just got to keep my hand in his
[1:31:35] belittle he's big be nothing he's
[1:31:38] everything
[1:31:38] be foolish he's all wisdom i don't have
[1:31:41] to figure it out i don't have to give an
[1:31:43] answer i don't have to pretend to know
[1:31:45] all i have to know is him and i have to
[1:31:47] have the character to match his
[1:31:49] character
[1:31:49] and if i do he'll plug me up and do
[1:31:52] great things
[1:31:53] through nothing like he did with moses
[1:31:56] like he did with paul like he did with
[1:31:58] brother brethren like he did with john
[1:31:59] the baptist
[1:32:00] like he did with amos like he did with
[1:32:02] all of them
[1:32:03] look who god was looking for
[1:32:07] say lord i
[1:32:11] i want to take all my message merit
[1:32:13] badges and throw them in the trash
[1:32:16] and all my 40 years and have it figured
[1:32:18] out and know the word and i just want to
[1:32:20] throw it all away
[1:32:22] and say god i know nothing but you and
[1:32:26] anything you've revealed to me is by
[1:32:27] your grace
[1:32:28] not by my effort
[1:32:32] what you've given me you've given me by
[1:32:34] your grace and lord if i can stay low
[1:32:36] you can keep lifting me higher
[1:32:39] i can stay low you can keep lifting me
[1:32:41] higher
[1:32:43] the way up is down
[1:32:47] humility is his character
[1:32:51] jesus christ came an utter complete
[1:32:54] humility his bride
[1:32:58] is able to humble herself
[1:33:01] and if she's not convinced of that yet
[1:33:04] he'll make sure
[1:33:07] he'll make sure that by the time we're
[1:33:09] out of here
[1:33:10] that the same character that jesus
[1:33:12] christ had will be displayed
[1:33:14] in his bride and i
[1:33:17] just want to lay my life down and let's
[1:33:20] bow our heads and pray
[1:33:23] lord jesus we thank you father for this
[1:33:25] day
[1:33:27] we thank you lord for every trial
[1:33:30] every obstacle for all the tension lord
[1:33:34] god in the last short while the last
[1:33:38] several months lord
[1:33:39] you've begun to unravel our wisdom
[1:33:42] our resolve our strength
[1:33:47] you begin to expose lord our selfishness
[1:33:50] and our pride
[1:33:53] god i'm thankful for that
[1:33:56] lord i pray you'd forgive us lord
[1:34:00] that we can humble ourselves before you
[1:34:02] and admit our own
[1:34:05] say we were too proud lord we were too
[1:34:08] self-sufficient too confident in our own
[1:34:10] selves
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:12] but god we want to become like that
[1:34:14] little child that you used for an
[1:34:15] example
[1:34:17] we just want to be happy lord trusting
[1:34:21] joyful confident that you're in charge
[1:34:24] and everything's okay
[1:34:26] lord we don't want to be the great
[1:34:30] the mighty we just want to be the humble
[1:34:34] we just want to be the nothings of the
[1:34:36] world that you can pick up and do
[1:34:38] something with
[1:34:40] we want to be the humbled and the abased
[1:34:43] that really show your mighty power and
[1:34:46] your glory
[1:34:48] not the strength of our flesh but the
[1:34:50] strength of your word
[1:34:52] not the abilities of our flesh our
[1:34:55] humanness
[1:34:56] but your ability lord to bring us
[1:34:58] through
[1:35:00] god i pray that every trial would have
[1:35:02] its perfect work in us
[1:35:04] every bit of pressure lord would
[1:35:06] accomplish its purpose
[1:35:08] that our pride would diminish that our
[1:35:11] self-sufficiency would
[1:35:13] go away that our self-esteem would be
[1:35:15] crushed
[1:35:17] and that through humility and brokenness
[1:35:18] lord we can be vessels that you can use
[1:35:20] for your glory
[1:35:23] god i love you i thank you for your
[1:35:25] beautiful plan and your word
[1:35:28] i thank you god for the mighty things
[1:35:31] that you're going to do
[1:35:33] i thank you lord for the tremendous
[1:35:35] things that will be accomplished on this
[1:35:36] earth by your hand
[1:35:39] and god i just want to be a part of it
[1:35:41] lord
[1:35:42] i want to be the tool in your hand the
[1:35:44] vessel that you use
[1:35:47] i want you lord the god of all peace to
[1:35:50] bruce satan under my feet shortly
[1:35:52] lord all you need is some feet you could
[1:35:54] have mine
[1:35:56] you need a body you can have mine i
[1:35:59] surrender it to you lord
[1:36:01] in humility and reverence i give it to
[1:36:04] you lord
[1:36:06] i pray god that we can as your servants
[1:36:08] have the right approach and reverence
[1:36:10] and humility
[1:36:12] and an action lord that we would get the
[1:36:14] reverence and humility right first
[1:36:17] and then by your grace you would put us
[1:36:19] into action for your kingdom's work
[1:36:22] that we could accomplish your will upon
[1:36:24] this earth lord
[1:36:26] let our wills diminish and let your will
[1:36:29] increase
[1:36:30] oh and i love you with all of my heart
[1:36:33] take your people lord
[1:36:35] mold us into what you want us to be lord
[1:36:38] make us into what you desire for us
[1:36:40] and use us lord for the purpose you
[1:36:42] foreordained before the foundation of
[1:36:44] the world
[1:36:45] we're here by your plan we're here for
[1:36:47] your purpose we're here
[1:36:48] lord because you called us you placed us
[1:36:50] you for ordained us we're here lord
[1:36:53] now mold us into the character that you
[1:36:55] can use for your glory
[1:36:58] and god do a mighty work like this world
[1:37:00] has never seen
[1:37:02] nor because you have humble broken
[1:37:04] vessels
[1:37:06] that you can depend on that you can use
[1:37:09] may all the glory be yours lord and not
[1:37:12] any human beings
[1:37:14] may all the praise go to you and not any
[1:37:17] flesh
[1:37:18] that you might be glorified and
[1:37:20] magnified
[1:37:21] through us we surrender all to you
[1:37:25] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[1:37:30] brother ben can you sing

[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:43:02] empty and broken
[1:43:08] i came back to
[1:43:11] him a vessel
[1:43:20] [Music]
[1:43:22] unworthy
[1:43:24] but he did not
[1:43:27] despair he started over
[1:43:35] and i bless the day
[1:43:40] he didn't throw the play away
[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:43:50] over
[1:43:58] into this
[1:44:19] and it's all because
[1:44:33] the
[1:44:47] he wants me to
[1:44:50] stay but when i stumble
[1:44:55] and when i fall
