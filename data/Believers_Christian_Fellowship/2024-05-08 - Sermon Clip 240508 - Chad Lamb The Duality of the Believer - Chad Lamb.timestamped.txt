[0:00] you can be scared amen and not scared
[0:02] you can be grieving and happy you can
[0:05] have joy amen the peace that passes all
[0:07] understanding but turmoil going on on
[0:09] the outside amen don't pay attention to
[0:12] the flesh pay attention to the
[0:14] soul amen your flesh will go up and down
[0:17] your flesh will be troubled your flesh
[0:19] will be distressed your flesh will be in
[0:21] pain your flesh will be tired your flesh
[0:24] will have doubts don't pay attention to
[0:26] the flesh we're a dual person we've got
[0:29] to dig down to to the inside and say God
[0:32] I'm a happy person I've got joy in my
[0:34] heart I know who I am and I know where
[0:37] I'm going my feelings are sad I've Got
[0:39] the Blues I can't seem to make myself
[0:42] laugh but it doesn't change anything in
[0:44] my life nothing has changed I'm still a
[0:48] Son of God I'm still glorybound I'm
[0:50] still seated in Heavenly places in
[0:52] Christ Jesus though I weep in my pillow
[0:54] at night till I fall asleep I'm still
[0:56] seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[0:58] Jesus
[1:00] nothing's going to change that I'm a
[1:02] dual person I can have dual emotions at
[1:05] the same exact time I can have a joy and
[1:07] a peace in my heart when everything in
[1:09] my life is unsettled and I can feel like
[1:11] I'm coming apart at the seams but the
[1:13] reality is nothing is wrong everything's
[1:17] fine and you feel it and the feeling is
[1:20] real but the real the real feeling is
[1:22] not the real
[1:23] [Applause]
[1:24] reality the real reality is the Heavenly
[1:28] reality the soul reality ity is what is
[1:30] true everything else is the vapor
[1:33] everything else is part of this life and
[1:35] we had to fall into this life we had to
[1:38] understand the backdrop of sin and
[1:40] perversion and Corruption and we had to
[1:42] feel the full gamut of it so that we
[1:44] would understand the grace and the love
[1:46] and the mercy and the peace that passes
[1:48] all understanding and while we're
[1:50] journeying through this life we're still
[1:52] stuck in cockabur on the outside and
[1:54] we've got things that are going to
[1:56] trouble us and so be it it's going to be
[1:58] there we're never going to get it to go
[2:00] away until these items
[2:03] change but praise God at the same time
[2:07] the worst day of my life I'm still
[2:09] seated in Christ Jesus in Heavenly
[2:11] places I'm still born again I still have
[2:13] the Holy Ghost I'm still Glory bound and
[2:16] these atoms are going to change someday
[2:18] and I'm not going to have to deal with
[2:19] this anymore this is a temporary problem
[2:23] and I'm willing to deal with the
[2:25] temporary problem as I'm passing through
[2:27] to the permanent position
[2:32] don't let the depression don't let the
[2:34] the the the troubles don't let the
[2:36] stress don't let the sickness don't let
[2:39] the weariness don't let any of it Rob
[2:41] you from the reality that's in your
[2:44] soul sometimes we have to rehearse those
[2:46] things to
[2:47] ourselves and remember no matter how bad
[2:50] it is on this side I'm a dual person
[2:52] there's another side to the story and I
[2:55] may not be able to feel it now but I'm
[2:58] not dependent on my feel feelings I'm
[3:00] dependent on the reality of God's word
[3:02] it's the truth even if I can't connect
[3:05] with it in my emotions it's still the
[3:08] truth you know there's sometimes you
[3:10] feel it with everything that's in you
[3:12] there's other times you don't feel
[3:14] it does it change anything it doesn't
[3:17] change anything
