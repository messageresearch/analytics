[10:44] god bless you this morning
[10:46] let's just bow our heads in our hearts
[10:49] oh lord
[10:51] there's such a longing in us lord
[10:53] [Music]
[10:54] for the place that we've come from lord
[10:58] god by this anointed word of the hour
[11:00] you're lifting our amnesia till we
[11:02] recognize
[11:04] we weren't who we thought we were
[11:06] we were traveling through this life born
[11:08] of human parents living a natural life
[11:11] that's not who we really were but the
[11:13] word came and awakened us
[11:15] to who we really are lord
[11:18] where we really came from and
[11:20] what our destination really is lord
[11:23] there's such a longing in our hearts god
[11:25] to
[11:26] be unified with you in a greater way day
[11:28] by day word by word
[11:31] lord let that land be alive in us lord
[11:34] [Music]
[11:35] or let that promised land be living in
[11:37] our hearts may we be in communion with
[11:39] you
[11:40] may it move lord from
[11:43] a longing to a reality
[11:45] day by day
[11:47] give us the eye sabbath to see lord
[11:50] god give us the word that illuminates
[11:52] our path
[11:54] or may we walk as you walk in this life
[11:58] may we be what you've ordered us to be
[12:00] may we fulfill your purpose in our lives
[12:03] may you be glorified lord in all that we
[12:05] do in this journey
[12:07] for god we're walking towards you we're
[12:10] walking with you you're walking in us
[12:12] walking toward that destination
[12:15] but i pray you would take control of the
[12:17] service this morning
[12:19] as you've abided in the praises of your
[12:21] people according to your word you made
[12:23] your presence known
[12:25] god now i pray you make your presence
[12:26] known by the breaking of bread
[12:29] that you would take this word and break
[12:31] it for us lord for you're the great
[12:33] shepherd and you're the one we're
[12:34] looking to to feed us
[12:36] we come as your lambs lord eager and
[12:38] expectant
[12:40] we're hungry for more of you
[12:42] pray that you would provide lord the
[12:44] meat we have need of
[12:45] god we give you all glory and praise may
[12:47] you take preeminence and be glorified
[12:49] and all it's said and done
[12:51] in jesus christ's name we pray
[12:54] amen
[12:55] [Music]
[12:56] and god bless you it's so good to see
[12:58] you this morning
[13:00] this way god bless you brother mike i
[13:02] couldn't believe you turned 80.
[13:04] shocking news brother
[13:06] but you make 80 look good so
[13:09] praise god happy birthday let's take our
[13:12] bibles and turn to revelation 21.
[13:15] while we're still standing we'll read
[13:16] this and be seated
[13:18] amen i want to remind everybody the
[13:19] communion service today we'll come back
[13:22] for that and let you know that the
[13:23] fellowship hall is open if you brought
[13:25] something to eat and like to eat in
[13:26] there
[13:28] or go get something and bring it back it
[13:29] is open now
[13:31] and also at the end of service our
[13:33] sister rachel barnes is
[13:35] uh requested to be baptized in the name
[13:37] of the lord jesus christ and so we're so
[13:40] thankful for her she was baptized when
[13:42] she was younger but she can't shake the
[13:44] burden that she feels to recommit her
[13:47] life to god and do so by baptism and she
[13:49] knows what brother venom said there's no
[13:51] scriptural requirement to be baptized
[13:53] again she knows that and she knows she
[13:55] doesn't have to but there's a burden in
[13:57] her that desires too strongly wants to
[13:59] needs to for her own conscience saying
[14:01] and so we're happy to help her in that
[14:04] amen and be praying for that god will
[14:06] manifest all he desires to manifest in
[14:09] her life
[14:10] it's a good day amen it's been a good
[14:12] time for the williams family
[14:14] may god keep blessing them amen
[14:17] amen let's read revelation 21 7 together
[14:27] he that
[14:28] overcometh shall inherit all things
[14:32] and i will be his god and he shall be my
[14:34] son
[14:35] amen let's just
[14:37] ask the lord the blessed reading of his
[14:39] word is receded
[14:40] amen i want to
[14:42] look at this scripture now i've read
[14:44] this scripture several times over the
[14:45] last
[14:46] few services so it's not new to us
[14:49] but you know every once in a while you
[14:51] get on things and thoughts and
[14:53] meditations and directions the lord's
[14:55] leading you and you just can't get off
[14:57] of it amen no matter no matter what you
[14:59] can't get off of it and you've preached
[15:01] it but then god drops one more nugget
[15:03] and then you preach it again and he
[15:04] drops one more nugget so
[15:06] we're going to be talking about things
[15:08] we've been talking about i mean for a
[15:10] little while so i don't mean to be
[15:12] repeating and i hope to you it doesn't
[15:14] come across as repeating but this is
[15:16] just something god is really dealing
[15:17] with us on and giving us direction and
[15:20] continually unfolding more and more as
[15:22] we go along and so i i pray that god
[15:26] will just keep dropping those nuggets so
[15:28] their understanding goes deeper and it
[15:30] becomes richer and our vision becomes
[15:32] clearer on everything even we've
[15:33] believed before amen there's still more
[15:36] layers to everything we believe amen
[15:39] there's deeper realities to everything
[15:41] we've accepted and so in this
[15:43] this scripture was one that we've talked
[15:45] about he that overcometh shall inherit
[15:47] all things and we know brother branham
[15:49] told us he said overcoming was not god
[15:52] putting you into a pipe and pulling you
[15:54] out the other side and saying now you're
[15:56] an overcomer you had nothing to overcome
[15:58] god did everything for you but we we
[16:01] realized that god gives us choice amen
[16:04] god never takes away choice and god is
[16:07] actually expressing his plan through
[16:09] choice
[16:11] and so he's called individuals and he's
[16:13] put he's put faith in his children
[16:16] remember he put faith in job he had
[16:18] confidence in job
[16:20] and he had confidence that when job was
[16:21] put to the test that job would not fail
[16:24] to believe amen and so god had
[16:26] confidence in job god has confidence in
[16:28] you and i god has confidence in our
[16:30] brother levi and his family right now
[16:33] so so we know that that god
[16:36] uh the promises are to the overcomer but
[16:39] the overcomer is not the one who has
[16:42] taken a a lazy approach to the gospel
[16:45] and just says whatever happens will
[16:46] happen and if god wants it it'll happen
[16:48] if he doesn't want it but he wants those
[16:50] who will make their choice amen those
[16:52] who will press those who will seek the
[16:54] lord those who will make decisions for
[16:57] god's sake for the word regardless of
[16:59] the consequences
[17:02] and so i was looking at this and and i
[17:04] want to bring this in this context
[17:07] uh in the breach brother branham says
[17:10] like jacob being supplanter
[17:13] and when he got in contact with the
[17:15] angel he held on
[17:17] and the angel tried to pull away he said
[17:19] i'm just not going to let you go he held
[17:22] on until he got what he wanted for and
[17:24] his name was changed from sir planter
[17:26] which means deceiver to what to a prince
[17:28] with god israel he prevailed now this is
[17:32] interesting in the context of what i've
[17:34] been meditating on and dwelling on
[17:37] that
[17:37] that you realize that
[17:40] jacob in a time of need in a time of
[17:43] trial jacob begins to move amen back
[17:46] towards his homeland he's being drawn
[17:48] back by circumstances amen he's coming
[17:50] back for the fulfillment of the word and
[17:52] he gets pressed in a tight situation and
[17:55] he moves by himself alone across the
[17:57] river and when he's there he meets a man
[18:00] and he wrestles with that man till the
[18:02] break of the day and we know that that
[18:04] man amen when when he leaves this
[18:06] wrestling match when he leaves this
[18:08] confrontation he walks away and says i
[18:11] have met god face to face so he knows
[18:14] something about that angel about that
[18:16] man that he met amen but the way brother
[18:18] branham says this here he says he come
[18:20] in contact with the angel now how was
[18:23] how was jacob ever going to come in
[18:26] contact with that angel unless that
[18:28] angel made contact with jacob
[18:31] like who made contact with who really
[18:35] like if you want to go make contact with
[18:37] an angel go find one you know go knock
[18:39] on the door go make one appear go go
[18:41] make contact with an angel amen the
[18:43] angel had to make himself
[18:45] present to jacob had to come to jacob
[18:47] jacob couldn't find him
[18:50] so that means god wanted this
[18:53] interaction with jacob amen it was god
[18:55] who initiated god who started the ball
[18:58] rolling god amen but there had to be
[19:01] something in jacob also so there had to
[19:03] be two parts to this scenario that we
[19:05] watched play out there had to be the
[19:07] part that jacob could not do that only
[19:09] god can do and there had to be the part
[19:11] that jacob did amen
[19:14] and so he said uh he held on and the
[19:16] angel tried the angel tried to pull away
[19:21] now listen
[19:23] the angel was trying to get away from
[19:25] jacob
[19:29] i i hope god will help me say these
[19:31] things right because i don't want to say
[19:33] anything wrong but the angel you're
[19:36] telling me the angel couldn't get away
[19:39] like he was too weak and he wasn't
[19:40] strong enough and didn't have
[19:42] supernatural powers to pull away from
[19:45] jacob he was pulling away and he even
[19:48] says let me go amen and jacob says i
[19:51] will not let you go this whole scenario
[19:54] is playing out for a purpose friends
[19:56] amen the the the the angel is not able
[20:00] to pull away from jacob and listen i'm
[20:02] just going to share it just the best i
[20:05] know how i don't believe the angel was
[20:08] not pulling away from jacob because he
[20:10] was physically incapable of pulling away
[20:12] from jacob but i believe the angel
[20:14] couldn't pull away from jacob because of
[20:16] who jacob was
[20:20] not because of jacob's physical strength
[20:22] but because of who jacob was and what
[20:25] jacob represented and what jacob was
[20:28] coming to amen and now jacob got a hold
[20:30] of the angel and the angel couldn't pull
[20:32] away i don't think jacob was so
[20:34] physically strong that he could grab a
[20:36] hold of this supernatural being and the
[20:38] supernatural being could not physically
[20:40] get away i don't think it was a test of
[20:43] strength amen i think it was the
[20:45] position jacob held with god that gave
[20:47] him the strength to hold on to that
[20:49] angel
[20:53] let's look at hosea 12 if we could turn
[20:55] together i want to look at a couple
[20:57] scriptures there's quite a few
[20:58] scriptures i want to go through
[21:09] daniel then hosea
[21:11] i say that for my benefit not yours
[21:14] i have a hard time sometimes finding
[21:18] the books hosea chapter 12.
[21:23] and we're going to start at verse 2.
[21:27] and the lord also had controversy with
[21:29] judah and will punish jacob according to
[21:31] his ways according to the doings will he
[21:33] recompense him
[21:35] he took his brother by the heel in the
[21:37] womb we know jacob did when esau was
[21:39] born he come out holding on to his heel
[21:42] and that's how he got the name
[21:43] jacob or sir planter
[21:45] and so
[21:47] it says here he had power i'm sorry he
[21:49] took his brother by the heel in the womb
[21:52] and by his strength he had power with
[21:54] god
[21:56] think about that by his strength he had
[21:58] power with god yeah he had power
[22:02] over the angel
[22:05] and prevailed
[22:07] he wept and made supplication unto him
[22:10] he found him in bethel and there he
[22:11] spake with us
[22:13] so i want to focus on he had power with
[22:16] god and i want to take out of this a
[22:18] text for tonight power with god
[22:21] he had power with god he had power over
[22:25] the angel
[22:26] and prevailed
[22:29] i don't know about you but something
[22:31] about that statement is so
[22:33] so impactful to me
[22:35] that jacob we know jacob as a human
[22:37] being a man born in an earthly way that
[22:41] jacob he had power with god and jacob
[22:44] had power over the angel and prevailed
[22:50] let's go to genesis chapter 32.
[22:54] and look at this
[23:03] genesis 32 and 24
[23:06] this is the story of jacob coming back
[23:08] into the land
[23:10] genesis 32
[23:13] and 24.
[23:18] and jacob was left alone and there
[23:20] wrestled a man with him until the
[23:22] breaking of the day
[23:24] and when he saw that he prevailed not
[23:26] against him he touched the hall of his
[23:28] thigh and the hollow of jacob's thigh
[23:30] was out of joint as he wrestled with him
[23:33] and he said let me go for the day
[23:34] breaketh and he said i will not let thee
[23:36] go except thou bless me
[23:39] and he said unto him what is thy name
[23:41] and he said jacob and he said that thy
[23:43] name shall be called no more jacob but
[23:46] israel for as a prince has thou power
[23:48] with god and with men and hast prevailed
[23:53] and jacob asked him and said tell me i
[23:55] pray thee thy name and he said wherefore
[23:57] is it that thou just asked after my name
[24:00] and he blessed him there and jacob
[24:02] called the name of the place pineal for
[24:04] i have seen god face to face and my life
[24:07] is preserved
[24:09] and as he passed over penul the sun rose
[24:12] upon him and he halted upon his thigh
[24:14] therefore the children of israel eat not
[24:16] of the sin which shrank which is upon
[24:18] the hollow of the thigh unto this day
[24:21] because he touched the hollow of jacob's
[24:23] thigh in the sinew that shrank
[24:25] so now he's wrestling with this angel
[24:27] and this angel touches him
[24:29] and die and he cripples him he he as a
[24:33] physical uh fact it cripples jacob and
[24:36] and jacob is wrestling and he says let
[24:39] me go for it's the break of day he said
[24:41] i will not let you go till you bless me
[24:44] now we know afterwards jacob says i have
[24:46] met god face to face so what is this
[24:49] telling us about jacob who he's
[24:51] wrestling with who touched him and who
[24:54] he said i will not let you go until you
[24:57] bless me
[25:00] who is he wrestling with what's taking
[25:02] place here what what is the impact of
[25:05] what is going on who what is the
[25:07] significance of what's happening there
[25:09] is a man on earth who's scared amen
[25:13] who's been a cheat all his life who's
[25:15] coming back into the land but there's a
[25:17] promise in his life he's got the
[25:19] birthright amen he's got the blessing
[25:22] the birthright from abraham is moving
[25:24] down through this individual he's
[25:26] walking with the birthright and he's a
[25:28] deceiver he's a human being like any
[25:30] other human being and he's and he's
[25:32] connived and cheated his way to get
[25:34] everything he has and now he's he's left
[25:37] his father-in-law under deception and
[25:39] snuck away amen and now he's coming into
[25:41] the land and he's fearful he's afraid of
[25:44] his brother because he cheated his
[25:45] brother this isn't a bold man this isn't
[25:48] a man with integrity this isn't somebody
[25:50] that you would look at with great
[25:52] respect and great honor a great person
[25:54] in the earth
[25:58] but he has the birthright amen and god
[26:00] knows what's down inside and what his
[26:02] positioning and who he really is amen
[26:05] not what he's done but who he is
[26:09] because what he's done does not always
[26:12] indicate who he is amen
[26:15] and so when he's coming scared and
[26:17] separating his flocks and his servants
[26:20] and his wives and his children and going
[26:22] by himself amen jacob was not going to
[26:25] knock on an angel's door he was not
[26:26] going to meet god he was not going to
[26:29] make god do something for him but god
[26:31] when he got into this condition god came
[26:34] on the scene and presented himself as a
[26:37] man to jacob and when jacob there was
[26:39] some significance
[26:43] and jacob knew it amen because jacob got
[26:46] a hold of this man and would not let go
[26:48] and jacob was not fighting for his life
[26:50] he was not trying to kill this man and
[26:52] this man kill him because as i he says i
[26:55] will not let you go till you bless me he
[26:58] knew this vessel contained the blessing
[27:00] this man had something for me and
[27:03] jacob's trying to get what this being
[27:05] can give him
[27:09] you understand
[27:12] and the very fact that he presented
[27:14] himself there shows you that this is
[27:16] god's will
[27:18] this is what god wants this is god's
[27:21] will god wanted to present himself in
[27:23] this form
[27:24] to
[27:25] jacob this day in this condition in this
[27:29] situation amen and when jacob got a hold
[27:32] of the angel amen the angel had the
[27:35] power to him
[27:40] but he says let me go
[27:44] and he says i'll not let you go till you
[27:46] bless me.
[27:48] and the blessing came
[27:50] in the changing of a name
[27:53] there was a change that was taking place
[27:55] there was a new identification that was
[27:58] coming
[27:59] and that new identification would bring
[28:01] also with it a blessing so when jacob
[28:04] began to wrestle with this being with
[28:06] this individual amen as he wrestled with
[28:09] this and was calling for a blessing what
[28:11] he was receiving was a change amen what
[28:14] is receiving was a change of identity a
[28:16] change of walk amen everything in his
[28:19] life was about to change amen but he
[28:21] knew enough when he was presented with
[28:24] this opportunity he didn't walk away he
[28:27] didn't he didn't bypass it he didn't
[28:29] just say god bless you good day and move
[28:31] on but when he came in contact with
[28:33] something that he sensed was real and
[28:35] something that he was since was able to
[28:37] help him amen he wrestled with it and
[28:39] wrestled with it and wrestled with it
[28:41] until the change came he wrestled with
[28:44] it till he got what he was seeking he
[28:46] wrestled with it tell he was blessed
[28:48] until everything changed in his life
[28:55] hosea said he had power
[28:58] over the angel
[29:00] and prevailed
[29:04] friends that's an amazing statement
[29:07] we're going to come back to genesis and
[29:08] look at it
[29:10] here so we're going to come back to
[29:13] chapter 32 but i want to look at exodus
[29:15] 32
[29:17] for just a minute
[29:25] exodus 32 and verse 7.
[29:32] in exodus 32 verse starting verse 7
[29:35] and the lord said unto moses go get thee
[29:37] down for thy people which thou brought
[29:39] us out of the land of egypt have
[29:41] corrupted themselves
[29:42] they have turned aside quickly out of
[29:44] the way which i commanded them they have
[29:46] made them a molten calf and have
[29:48] worshipped them and have sacrificed
[29:50] there unto and said these be thy gods o
[29:53] israel which have brought thee up out of
[29:54] the land of egypt and the lord said unto
[29:56] moses i have seen this people
[29:59] and behold it is a stiff-necked people
[30:01] now therefore let me alone that my wrath
[30:03] may wax hot against them and then i may
[30:06] consume them and i will make of thee a
[30:08] great nation
[30:10] now look at the instructions god is
[30:12] speaking to moses and god said this is
[30:14] what's happened this is what they've
[30:16] done this is the kind of people they are
[30:18] now leave me alone
[30:20] is this what he says
[30:22] this is the mouth of god this is the
[30:24] word of god this is a commandment from
[30:26] god to moses
[30:28] leave me alone
[30:31] let my anger wax hot then i may consume
[30:33] them and i will make of thee a great
[30:36] nation
[30:37] and moses besought the lord his god and
[30:40] said lord why doeth i dot thy wrath wax
[30:43] hot against thy people which thou has
[30:45] brought forth out of the land of egypt
[30:46] with great power and with a mighty hand
[30:49] wherefore should the egyptians speak and
[30:51] say for mischief did he bring them out
[30:54] to slay them in the mountains and to
[30:55] consume them from the face of the earth
[30:57] to turn from their fierce wrath and
[30:59] repent of this evil and turn from thy
[31:02] fierce wrath and repent of this evil
[31:04] against thy people
[31:06] who is moses talking to
[31:09] what kind of conversation is this amen
[31:12] god speaks to moses face to face
[31:15] he is face to face with god and god is
[31:18] saying this is what's going on this is
[31:19] the people i'm i'm done with it leave me
[31:22] alone that my anger may wax hot and i
[31:24] can consume them and i'll raise up a new
[31:26] nation out of you and moses said don't
[31:28] do it
[31:30] don't you think what your enemies will
[31:31] think do you think god didn't know what
[31:33] they would think
[31:35] do you think moses is telling god
[31:36] anything god did not know or god has not
[31:39] considered before
[31:41] do you think moses has more wisdom than
[31:43] god
[31:45] do you think moses has a better idea
[31:47] than god
[31:50] but moses now
[31:51] he says
[31:53] turn
[31:54] now he's commanding god
[31:58] turn from thy fierce wrath and repent
[32:07] who's talking to who
[32:11] repent of this evil against thy people
[32:15] remember abraham
[32:17] isaac and israel like god had forgot
[32:22] remember abraham isaac and israel thy
[32:24] servants to whom thou swearst by thine
[32:26] own self and says unto them i will
[32:29] multiply your seed as the stars of
[32:30] heaven and all this land that i have
[32:32] spoken them will i give unto your seed
[32:34] and they shall inherit it forever now
[32:36] he's reminding god of the word
[32:41] of the promise he made abraham seed now
[32:43] he's remind first he says all your
[32:45] enemies will think that you couldn't get
[32:47] it done
[32:49] repent of this don't do it
[32:51] and don't you remember
[32:53] what you said
[33:00] and the lord
[33:02] repented
[33:04] of the evil which he thought to do unto
[33:06] his people
[33:09] brother benham says in souls that are in
[33:11] prison
[33:13] he said there was a scripture that
[33:14] always puzzled me how that moses could
[33:16] tell god a better idea than god had till
[33:19] i found out that it was the spirit of
[33:21] christ in
[33:22] moses
[33:24] that wasn't just moses talking to god
[33:27] there was something else in moses and it
[33:29] was another part of god amen another
[33:32] attribute of god it was god talking to
[33:35] god
[33:38] no man can talk that way to god no no
[33:41] sin born sexual born creature can stand
[33:44] in god and say god you're wrong on this
[33:46] you're wrong on that repent of this
[33:48] don't you even remember the promise you
[33:50] made no one can talk like that and live
[33:52] friends
[33:54] but it wasn't just moses moses was
[33:57] playing the part he was called to amen
[33:59] god was giving an ear to moses not
[34:01] because of moses not because of his
[34:03] natural birth not because of his
[34:04] education his good looks his ideas he
[34:06] was lending ear to moses because moses
[34:09] was playing a part that god needed him
[34:11] to play and it was another part of god
[34:15] it was another attribute of god that was
[34:17] expressing standing in the gap throwing
[34:19] himself before the people later he'll
[34:21] say god amen forgive your people and if
[34:24] you must blot a name out blot my name
[34:26] out and not theirs and brother man
[34:28] points to that and say see that's christ
[34:30] throwing himself in the breach standing
[34:32] in the gap
[34:37] it wasn't the man
[34:39] that had the right to contend with god
[34:46] it was the god in the man
[34:52] and the god in the man
[34:55] did not say well if that's what you want
[34:56] to do your god you know everything and
[35:00] you must be right
[35:03] you understand there's a motivation that
[35:04] came over moses there's an inspiration
[35:07] that welled up of him because of his
[35:08] position because of who he was amen
[35:11] because of the part that he was playing
[35:13] there's an inspiration to come and in
[35:15] that inspiration he'll begin to contend
[35:17] with god he'll begin to to bring
[35:19] another idea to god and try to convince
[35:23] god that this is not a good idea
[35:27] and god needed him to play that part
[35:29] because god must be just but he also is
[35:31] a god of mercy but he needs somebody to
[35:34] stand in the gap and throw himself in
[35:36] the breach and stand up for the people
[35:38] that he's going to bring judgment so he
[35:39] was playing another part of god and he
[35:42] was playing it under inspiration and god
[35:44] was pleased with what moses was saying
[35:47] it's not that moses amen
[35:49] outsmarted outwitted outmaneuvered god
[35:53] and when he said god repented of the
[35:55] evil it wasn't as though god now god's
[35:58] he's all fired up and his wrath is hot
[36:00] and he's going to go down and slam and
[36:02] start over and moses starts rebuking him
[36:04] and he starts getting sheepish
[36:06] puts his hands in his pockets and
[36:09] won't look moses in the eye
[36:14] and when moses is done he
[36:16] kicks the ground
[36:18] says all right i won't kill him
[36:22] god didn't want to kill him that was
[36:24] never the plan the plan was have an
[36:27] intercessor amen the plan was have
[36:29] somebody stand in the gap but god's got
[36:31] to come in judgment before that
[36:32] attribute could rise on the occasion
[36:34] moses was anointed amen moses was
[36:36] inspired moses was playing another part
[36:39] of god god was playing one part moses
[36:42] was playing another part and god wanted
[36:44] him to play that part
[36:48] and when he said god repented brother
[36:50] branham said god has never had a new
[36:52] thought about anything
[36:54] so moses did not bring him a new thought
[36:57] he knew all things he knew the end from
[36:58] the beginning he knew the plan and the
[37:00] exodus journey amen but he had to have
[37:03] moses and moses had to have another part
[37:05] of god amen so that god's plan can come
[37:07] to fruition amen because god amen amen
[37:11] god is one amen but god has divided
[37:13] himself as attributes and they're all
[37:15] playing their part at different times
[37:17] like a great symphony of god so that god
[37:19] could bring his whole plan down and show
[37:21] his characteristics to his children
[37:24] and brother ben says i never understood
[37:27] how moses could have a better idea than
[37:29] god
[37:31] until i recognized it wasn't moses
[37:34] it was god
[37:38] so you can say
[37:39] i think it would be safe to say even
[37:41] though i don't have the scripture for
[37:43] this but i don't think it's contrary to
[37:45] scripture to say moses contended with
[37:48] god and prevailed
[37:50] i don't think that's opposite to what we
[37:52] saw
[37:54] moses contended with god and prevailed
[37:56] how
[37:58] not because of his wisdom
[38:01] not because of his strength
[38:03] but because of who he was
[38:10] now let's go back to genesis 32.
[38:21] genesis 32
[38:25] verse 27.
[38:32] and he said unto him
[38:34] what is thy name and he said jacob
[38:36] he said thy name shall be called no more
[38:38] jacob
[38:40] but israel
[38:42] for as a prince has thou power with god
[38:45] and with men
[38:46] and has prevailed
[38:48] this word power in this sentence means
[38:51] to contend to have power to kent to
[38:54] contend with to persist to exert oneself
[38:58] this is what he had with god the ability
[39:00] to exert himself
[39:02] the ability to contend with
[39:08] the ability to have power with
[39:13] and he says thou
[39:15] has power
[39:16] the ability to contend with or persist
[39:18] with or to exert oneself
[39:23] and with god in men and has prevailed
[39:26] this word prevail means to overcome
[39:29] to have power to be able
[39:32] to be able to gain or to accomplish to
[39:35] be able to endure to be able to reach
[39:38] to prevail over or against to overcome
[39:40] to be the victor
[39:43] this is the power that he has
[39:46] with god and man and has prevailed he
[39:49] has overcome he has become the victor
[39:55] and i want to look at this name he was
[39:56] given israel
[39:58] because the name is very interesting the
[40:00] name israel and it says uh in verse 27
[40:04] again but jacob will not be thy name no
[40:06] more
[40:07] be called no more jacob but israel for
[40:09] as a prince thou has power with gone
[40:12] so
[40:14] we know that that name
[40:16] is uh israel means prince with god but
[40:18] in the hebrew when you get down to the
[40:21] to the hebrew there's the the strong's
[40:23] concordance and also many others that i
[40:24] looked at but strong's concordance says
[40:26] this
[40:27] israel means god prevails
[40:33] god prevails
[40:36] and in many concordances in many uh
[40:39] hebrew dictionaries it means the same
[40:40] thing god prevails it also means a
[40:42] prince with god and because the word
[40:44] prevails the same word for prince
[40:47] in israel
[40:48] l is god
[40:51] and so this word means god prevails
[40:55] so jacob's name in the prevailing over
[40:58] god the contending with the angel the
[41:00] holding on and not letting go the power
[41:02] he had with god the power he had over
[41:04] the angel was evidence that god
[41:06] prevailed it was not jacob prevailing it
[41:10] was god prevailing in jacob
[41:15] it changed his name amen because his
[41:17] name changed his nature changed
[41:19] everything changed it was no longer
[41:21] jacob prevailed over laban with his
[41:23] deceit he prevailed over his daddy with
[41:26] his deceit he prevailed over esau with
[41:28] his deceit jacob knew how to prevail
[41:31] this was not jacob prevailing amen that
[41:34] kind of prevailing would never prevail
[41:36] over this angel but there was a
[41:37] different prevailing because of the
[41:39] birthright because of who he was because
[41:41] of the time he was coming to because of
[41:43] the condition of the age that he was in
[41:45] amen there was another prevailing that
[41:48] was deeper than the mind that was deeper
[41:50] than the nature that he was born with
[41:52] but this was god prevailing in jacob
[41:56] [Music]
[41:59] it was god wrestling with god
[42:06] i hope you don't think i'm crazy
[42:09] but i hope you can see the scriptures
[42:12] it was a attribute of god manifesting
[42:15] part of god's plan called to take a
[42:17] position in god's great economy amen
[42:19] there had to be an anointing in his life
[42:21] there had to be an attribute expressing
[42:22] his life there had to be something that
[42:24] was moving him because of god's ordained
[42:27] plan amen he was moving into the
[42:28] promised land he had to get into
[42:30] position he had to be in the right place
[42:32] amen esau couldn't kill him amen none of
[42:35] these things could happen he he was
[42:36] ordained he was the expression of god's
[42:39] thought for that day
[42:43] he was the word being made manifest in
[42:46] that day
[42:48] it was jacob
[42:50] abraham isaac jacob they were the
[42:52] expressions of god in those vessels in
[42:55] their day and it was the expression of
[42:57] god's in god's great plan the word of
[42:59] god and the promise of god was now being
[43:01] expressed in jacob so there was a
[43:03] portion of god and jacob amen and that
[43:05] portion of god had a he had a special
[43:08] position with god not anybody amen can
[43:11] just go find god grab a hold of god hold
[43:14] on to the angel of the lord hold on to
[43:16] this image of a man until he prevails
[43:18] and overcomes and gets a blessing it
[43:20] doesn't work that way friends god showed
[43:23] up because he wanted him to grab a hold
[43:24] of him god came on the scene because he
[43:26] wanted jacob to wrestle with him
[43:34] praise be to god
[43:40] brother ben says convinced in concern
[43:43] jacob one night you know he had left
[43:45] laban and he was on his road over
[43:48] the desire come in his heart to visit
[43:50] his homeland and now we find out that he
[43:52] was afraid he was afraid to meet his
[43:55] brother so he got down to business
[43:57] before he crossed jordan and prayed all
[43:58] night and he wrestled with the lord
[44:00] wrestled all night and he said i'll not
[44:02] let you go i like that
[44:06] hold on to him right stay all night with
[44:08] him
[44:10] andrew did stay all night with him and
[44:12] he wrestled with the angel all night and
[44:14] the angel said it's coming daylight i
[44:15] must leave he said i'll just not let you
[44:18] go i want something in me that's
[44:21] different i want something in me that
[44:23] changed me
[44:28] how did he know that this angel could
[44:30] make that change
[44:32] what mental conception he had
[44:34] did the angel first give him his card
[44:36] and say see on here i
[44:39] but it was something in him amen met the
[44:42] reality and when something in him met
[44:44] the reality he was not going to let this
[44:46] go until that changed me amen there's
[44:49] something i need more there's something
[44:51] i need more than what i have i cannot
[44:53] overcome me but
[44:55] by whatever mechanism he knew he knew
[44:58] that what he got a hold of had the power
[45:00] to make a change in him
[45:04] said i want something in me that will
[45:06] change me and you notice as soon as the
[45:08] lord blessed him the blessing that he
[45:10] asked for he was ready then to cross the
[45:12] river and go see his brother why he
[45:14] wrestled all night he stayed with he
[45:16] stayed with god all night long and
[45:18] wrestled with god
[45:19] now you just said hey leave me alone now
[45:21] i'm tired the blessing would have never
[45:24] come
[45:27] that's what brother branham says
[45:30] the blessing would have never come i
[45:32] always when i read the bible so many
[45:34] times i read the bible you see
[45:35] circumstances work out and things happen
[45:37] and i always ask what would have
[45:38] happened if they hadn't
[45:40] said done and you never know i mean you
[45:42] could surmise all day long and you never
[45:44] really know but brother brennam tells us
[45:46] if he had not held on the blessing would
[45:49] have never come
[45:52] but i ask you the question
[45:55] did god want him to hold on or not
[46:01] i have to take my jacket off for this
[46:02] one
[46:06] when the angel said let me go did he
[46:08] really want him to let him go
[46:13] when there's a promise of god you want
[46:14] manifest in your life and it looks like
[46:16] god's shaking you off does god want you
[46:18] to shake off does god want you to back
[46:20] down does god want you to turn tail and
[46:22] say well it must not be for me it must
[46:23] be for somebody else i must not no when
[46:26] it's presented to you god wants you to
[46:28] hold on like jacob held on
[46:30] god presented himself to jacob so jacob
[46:32] would hold on amen and god didn't make
[46:34] it easy for him god afflicted him and
[46:37] crippled him before he blessed him
[46:40] this meeting with god this meeting with
[46:43] the man amen it was having a negative
[46:45] effect on him
[46:48] i ask you a question if you're wrestling
[46:51] with a man that has the power to touch
[46:52] your thought and you instantly
[46:54] are you going to keep a hold of him are
[46:56] you going to let him go and say he you
[46:57] could go now
[47:01] what is he holding on for more crippling
[47:03] more destruction
[47:07] he was holding on because he knew that
[47:10] this man can bless me
[47:13] if it cripples me he can bless me
[47:16] if if it afflicts me he can bless me if
[47:19] i wrestle all night he can bless me if i
[47:21] wrestle two nights he can bless me if
[47:23] i'm still holding on in the morning
[47:25] there's no place else i can get what i
[47:27] need this is the only source that i have
[47:30] and i have no option but to hold on
[47:32] until he blesses me
[47:34] if he afflicts me if he tells me to go
[47:36] away if he shakes me off if he tells me
[47:39] i'm no good it doesn't matter i have no
[47:42] other option
[47:48] this is how god deals with his elect
[47:50] [Music]
[47:51] jacob elect he's elect
[47:54] this is how god deals with his elect
[47:57] he shows up as a man
[48:03] he's an angel as a man but it's really
[48:06] god
[48:12] and jacob
[48:13] somehow gets entangled with this man
[48:18] the bible doesn't tell us all that
[48:22] and jacob knows somehow
[48:25] that this is the solution to my problem
[48:29] he knows it
[48:31] he probably doesn't know how he knows it
[48:35] how is it you know it that this word is
[48:37] the only way
[48:39] it wasn't your intellectualism it wasn't
[48:41] your good upbringing but there's
[48:42] something in you that knows this word or
[48:44] this hour is the only way there is no
[48:46] other way nothing else can deliver me
[48:48] nothing else can save me nothing else
[48:50] can change me
[48:52] i mean the same way you know that this
[48:54] word is it the only thing that can
[48:56] deliver you is the same way that jacob
[48:58] knew that this angel was that had the
[49:00] power to deliver me and there's no other
[49:02] way and while he's wrestling he comes
[49:04] under great pain and affliction
[49:08] but he does not let go because i still
[49:12] have no other place to go
[49:16] i'm telling you getting a hold of this
[49:18] word sometimes will you amen
[49:20] getting a hold of this word will cause
[49:22] affliction it'll cause pain it'll cause
[49:24] suffering
[49:28] and if you haven't experienced any of
[49:30] that i'm questioning what you got a hold
[49:32] of
[49:34] because whatever with this word this
[49:36] living word of bread of life the lord
[49:39] jesus christ the word of the hour when
[49:41] you get a hold of it amen it begins to
[49:44] change you amen it begins to affect you
[49:46] it begins to change the way you walk and
[49:48] afflictions come amen but that's not the
[49:50] time to turn loose of what you got to
[49:52] hold up amen because that's the only
[49:54] thing that can save you
[49:58] got a hold of it amen couldn't turn it
[50:00] loose even after being crippled couldn't
[50:02] turn it loose the angel's now saying let
[50:05] me go what if god looked at you and says
[50:07] leave me alone
[50:11] that's what jesus said to the woman who
[50:13] had a child grievously vexed with the
[50:15] demon he said leave me alone
[50:21] he called her a dog and said the
[50:23] children's better not for dogs amen she
[50:26] wasn't contesting that she didn't care
[50:27] if she was a dog or whatever he had to
[50:29] be called she just knew this is the man
[50:31] that can change the situation and nobody
[50:34] else can
[50:36] if he calls me a dog if he tells me to
[50:38] go away if the disciples make fun of me
[50:40] it doesn't change anything because
[50:42] that's the only source i have to go to
[50:46] she says she says oh son of david she
[50:48] called him by the wrong name
[50:50] she had no rights to him as son of david
[50:53] have mercy upon me and he just ignored
[50:55] her she cries out again and he says it's
[50:58] not right to give the children's bread
[51:00] unto dogs
[51:04] most of the people in this world if they
[51:06] come in contact with the living god and
[51:08] god says something like that to them
[51:09] they just put their head down and walk
[51:10] away
[51:14] god is not looking for those kind of
[51:16] people
[51:18] that is not what god's searching for
[51:20] god's searching for the one
[51:22] he can afflict and they won't let go
[51:24] he's searching for the ones he can shake
[51:27] and they won't turn loose he's searching
[51:28] for the ones he can call a dog and they
[51:30] won't leave he's searching for the ones
[51:32] that he can say leave me alone it's
[51:34] coming the break of the day and he's
[51:35] looking for the ones that will say i
[51:37] will not let you go because he's looking
[51:39] for the other part of himself
[51:43] he's not looking for people to make a
[51:45] church he's looking for the rest of
[51:47] himself
[51:48] he's looking for the counterpart the one
[51:50] that recognizes the one that holds on
[51:53] the one that endures to the end the one
[51:55] that knows this is the only hope that i
[51:57] have i have no other hope i will not
[51:59] turn loose i don't care if you slay me
[52:02] yet will i serve him
[52:08] what is that it wasn't you and your
[52:09] beauty it's not you and your wisdom it's
[52:11] not you and your willpower god will make
[52:14] sure by the end of your wrestling match
[52:16] you have no willpower left you don't
[52:18] have no intelligence left you have
[52:19] nothing left the only thing you have
[52:21] left is god on the inside that grabs a
[52:23] hold and says i cannot let go until you
[52:26] bless me
[52:28] that's what god's looking for he doesn't
[52:30] make it easy because it's not for the
[52:31] ones who are looking for it easy this
[52:33] ain't a laodicean message for laodicean
[52:36] people this is a bride message for his
[52:38] bride and his bride has his character
[52:41] inside of them and that's what he's
[52:42] looking for
[52:44] and he won't make it easy
[52:47] how many times have you said why does it
[52:49] have to be so hard
[52:54] i hope i'm not the only person who ever
[52:55] said that but i've said that a lot
[52:57] actually
[52:59] why does that have to be so hard it's
[53:01] one fire to the next fire it's one
[53:02] affliction to the next it's one trial to
[53:04] the next trial
[53:05] it's one heartbreak one difficult
[53:07] situation one upset
[53:10] from one to the next to the next to the
[53:12] next because that's the only way he can
[53:15] find the one with the birthright
[53:21] this message came to you amen
[53:25] not because you came to it
[53:28] jacob didn't come to the lord the lord
[53:31] came to him
[53:35] and this message came to you
[53:37] not for you to play with
[53:40] not for you to have tea with
[53:42] not for you to have a passing
[53:43] conversation
[53:47] god came your way one day to see what
[53:49] you would do about it
[53:53] i can imagine now i forgive me if i
[53:57] imagine wrong but this is chad's
[53:59] imagination
[54:01] it's not scripture but my imagination
[54:04] that the angel of the lord is wrestling
[54:07] with jacob
[54:10] and my question on my mind is
[54:13] is he enjoying it or does he hate it
[54:16] is it part of the plan
[54:19] or is it not part of the plan
[54:23] not that he's enjoying afflicting jacob
[54:26] i don't think the affliction brought him
[54:28] joy even though he was changing his walk
[54:30] i don't think the agony brought him joy
[54:33] i think what was bringing him joy was
[54:35] seeing a son act like a son
[54:38] i can just imagine him wrestling with
[54:40] him going that's my boy
[54:41] and trying not to smile
[54:44] that's just my imagination i may be
[54:46] wrong
[54:50] but god wanted jacob to overcome
[54:55] god did not end that battle
[54:58] to shut jacob down and have him walk
[55:00] away defeated
[55:02] god entered that wrestling match for
[55:05] jacob to overcome
[55:07] and when jacob began to overcome he had
[55:09] to recognize it wasn't jacob now you're
[55:11] israel now god is prevailing
[55:16] jacob is dying and god is prevailing
[55:20] jacob is changing the old man the old
[55:23] nature it's dying and now i'm going to
[55:26] give you another name because in this
[55:28] wrestling match jacob is dying amen but
[55:31] something else is coming to life inside
[55:33] of jacob and i'm going to give the name
[55:35] of that thing that's come alive and you
[55:37] the name of israel which means god
[55:40] prevails
[55:42] and it was god prevailing
[55:44] in his son
[55:49] brother brahms says in the message the
[55:50] seed is not air with the shuck
[55:53] so did you ever see an eagle compromise
[55:56] no sir there's no compromising in him
[55:58] neither does a genuine christian he
[56:00] ain't soft he'll hunt till he finds it
[56:02] amen yes sir he'll find his meat he
[56:05] wants fresh manna he'll get down there
[56:07] and dig till he finds it he'll fly
[56:09] higher and higher if there's none in
[56:11] this valley he'll rise a little higher
[56:13] the higher you go the more you can see
[56:15] it's time for eagles of this day to get
[56:17] to flying higher dig into god's promises
[56:20] not live on vulture food that's been
[56:21] killed years ago get out of it
[56:24] politics voting in voting out saying
[56:27] this that and the other the holy spirit
[56:28] has no more right of way in the church
[56:30] than nothing no more prayer meetings
[56:32] no more agonizing with god to fulfill
[56:36] his word
[56:38] in case you're wondering this in 1965
[56:43] no more prayer meetings no more
[56:45] agonizing with god to fulfill his word
[56:51] no more believing that the word is still
[56:53] the same yesterday today and forever
[56:57] they just vulturized down get a
[56:59] denomination put their name on the book
[57:01] and got lazy and soft and sets back
[57:03] there gloating in some kind of
[57:05] dedicarian and then supposed to be at
[57:07] least a hawk that's a similar brother to
[57:09] the eagle the the prophet that brought
[57:11] the true word and manifested it
[57:14] relies on half rotten man-made theology
[57:16] where does he get it in some man-made
[57:18] sunday school program she some educator
[57:20] killed for him back in some seminary
[57:23] tell them that the days and miracles has
[57:24] passed there was no such thing as
[57:25] baptism of the holy ghost all this
[57:27] nonsense you mean to tell me that an
[57:29] eagle would eat that he couldn't do it
[57:31] no sir neither will a christian eat on
[57:33] the dead or carrying from old
[57:35] denominational doctrines and things they
[57:37] want the word of god fresh and the
[57:39] promise of the hour
[57:40] god promised rabbits in the days of
[57:41] luther he promised other things in the
[57:43] days of others but he has promised us a
[57:45] full square meal the full seven course
[57:47] menu for all the seven seals are open
[57:50] and everything is ready for the word of
[57:51] god to those who can receive
[57:56] so where brother abraham says in the
[57:58] same quote he says no more agonizing
[58:01] with god
[58:02] to fulfill his word
[58:06] no more wrestling with the angel
[58:11] no more getting ahold of what you sense
[58:13] has the power to change you
[58:16] no more uh no more laboring with god and
[58:20] saying god but your word says no more
[58:22] taking the role of moses say lord don't
[58:25] you remember your promise to abraham
[58:27] isaac and jacob no more saying god don't
[58:29] you remember your promise on the day of
[58:31] pentecost when peter said if i repent
[58:34] and baptize in the name of the lord
[58:35] jesus christ i shall receive the gift of
[58:37] the holy ghost and i'm not moving until
[58:39] you fill me with the holy ghost
[58:42] why because i'm reminding you of your
[58:44] word i'm doing what moses did i'm saying
[58:46] do you remember what you said through
[58:48] peter do you remember what's in the book
[58:50] of acts do you remember what was said on
[58:52] the inaugural day and lord i've repented
[58:54] i've been baptized in your name and now
[58:57] i'm receiving the baptism of the holy
[58:58] ghost and i'm here to receive it lord
[59:00] and i'm not turning loose till i get it
[59:06] no more laziness no more soft dotiness
[59:10] no more vulturizing down and letting
[59:12] everybody else do everything for you
[59:14] amen but now it's god in you amen christ
[59:17] in you the hope of glory god manifesting
[59:20] his counterpart in you one part's here
[59:22] giving the word the other part's here
[59:24] trying to come and saying uh give me the
[59:26] book
[59:28] and the other part's saying take it
[59:35] that's written that way for a reason
[59:39] a voice saying go to the angel and take
[59:41] the little book and eat it up amen go to
[59:44] the angel the angel wrestling with the
[59:46] angel the angel with the open book and
[59:48] you say give me the book
[59:52] and the angel says
[59:54] take it
[59:57] i wonder if he's looking for another
[59:59] wrestling match
[1:00:04] i wonder if he's looking for somebody
[1:00:06] else that will reach out and try to get
[1:00:07] it
[1:00:09] or does he have to cut it up in really
[1:00:11] little pieces and marinate and soften it
[1:00:14] and put in the pressure cooker and get
[1:00:15] all the bones out of it
[1:00:17] and does you have to take the open book
[1:00:19] the word and say now um my mom open your
[1:00:21] mouth choo-choo here comes the train
[1:00:26] do you understand what i'm saying he's
[1:00:28] looking for the counterparts
[1:00:30] he's looking for somebody to say give me
[1:00:32] that book i've got to have that book
[1:00:35] that open book revelation the revelation
[1:00:37] that's entire contained in the entire
[1:00:39] book i got to have it give it to me god
[1:00:41] give it to me now
[1:00:43] [Music]
[1:00:44] i don't think that's not i don't think
[1:00:46] that's contrary to his desire i don't
[1:00:48] think it's contrary to what he's looking
[1:00:50] for i think it's the very thing that
[1:00:51] happened in jacob when jacob was coming
[1:00:53] into his birth right he said i will not
[1:00:55] let you go until you bless me and now
[1:00:57] there's an open book and a mighty angel
[1:00:58] that's come with a revelation open in
[1:01:01] his hand amen and you've been instructed
[1:01:03] to go to that angel and take the book
[1:01:07] but when you go to the angel to take the
[1:01:09] book to get the book he says take the
[1:01:11] book and i'm just curious i'm just the
[1:01:14] way i'm wired i'm curious is he looking
[1:01:16] for somebody else who will persevere is
[1:01:18] he looking for somebody who will reach
[1:01:19] out and take it or is he looking for
[1:01:21] somebody that'll say i'm here lord if
[1:01:23] you want to give it to me you can if you
[1:01:24] don't that's okay too
[1:01:28] what do you mean that's okay too
[1:01:31] it's okay with you that you don't get
[1:01:32] the revelation of the hour it's okay
[1:01:34] with you that the open book doesn't
[1:01:36] become your meat
[1:01:38] i'll tell you it's not okay with me
[1:01:40] there's something inside of me i'm not
[1:01:43] okay with that i'm not satisfied with no
[1:01:45] revelation of the word i'm not satisfied
[1:01:47] with no eating of the book because i
[1:01:49] know that's my inheritance that's the
[1:01:51] title deed the redemption that's the
[1:01:53] solution to all of my problems lays in
[1:01:55] that open book and i'm not going to be
[1:01:57] satisfied till i take it until i eat it
[1:02:05] too many people want to come to church
[1:02:06] and hear a good sermon
[1:02:08] that's not what any of this is about
[1:02:12] come church have a nice place to take
[1:02:14] your family hear a good encouraging
[1:02:15] sermon some instructions on how you know
[1:02:17] being nice to your neighbor and being a
[1:02:18] good dad and being a good mom
[1:02:21] and we'll feel good about being with the
[1:02:22] bride we're the bride with the bride and
[1:02:24] we'll go home and we'll do it again on
[1:02:25] wednesday and we'll do it again on
[1:02:26] sunday and my kids will get older and
[1:02:28] they'll get married in the church and
[1:02:29] we'll have a good time and the grandkids
[1:02:31] will be gathered around and we'll always
[1:02:32] have fun together
[1:02:34] always be nice
[1:02:36] that is not why the message came that
[1:02:39] just starts a new system a new
[1:02:41] denomination a new lazy vulturizing down
[1:02:44] and just getting into a form of religion
[1:02:46] and a system now called the message
[1:02:50] but god is looking for his israels amen
[1:02:53] god is looking for his princes amen
[1:02:55] because it's the princes that have power
[1:02:56] with god
[1:02:58] he's looking for kings and priests amen
[1:03:01] he's looking for a different breeding
[1:03:02] he's looking for somebody amen that has
[1:03:04] a different genetics on the inside
[1:03:11] we're not here to be generational
[1:03:13] believers
[1:03:15] in my father's footsteps that's what the
[1:03:17] israelites did and they failed
[1:03:20] we're not here to you know have a family
[1:03:23] heritage of the message
[1:03:26] we would all love that
[1:03:27] but what we want is every individual to
[1:03:30] go to the mighty angel and take the book
[1:03:32] amen they say give it to me because they
[1:03:34] take it say i'm taking it amen i'm
[1:03:37] eating it and i'm eating it all
[1:03:40] if you've got to do that by yourself do
[1:03:42] it by yourself
[1:03:45] if not another member of your family
[1:03:47] will do it you do it all by yourself
[1:03:49] because god is watching what you do with
[1:03:51] his word when he passes by when the
[1:03:54] angel of the lord comes by what do you
[1:03:56] do do you say it was nice to meet you it
[1:03:57] was a pleasure oh my i feel so
[1:03:59] privileged to be in your presence or do
[1:04:01] you reach around grab his mantel roll it
[1:04:03] around in your hand and hold on and say
[1:04:05] i gotta have something from you i can't
[1:04:07] keep going this way i gotta have that
[1:04:09] open book i gotta have that revelation i
[1:04:11] gotta have a change that completely
[1:04:13] changes me
[1:04:15] [Music]
[1:04:17] if you slay me i'm not turning loose
[1:04:20] if you afflict me i'm not turning loose
[1:04:22] if you call me a dog i'm not turning
[1:04:24] loose if you tell me to let go i'm still
[1:04:26] not letting go
[1:04:29] he told moses to stand aside and moses
[1:04:31] got right in his way
[1:04:34] so what the bible said amen
[1:04:37] he told moses to stand aside and moses
[1:04:39] did not hearken to the voice of the lord
[1:04:46] am i writing the bible on my own
[1:04:50] moses no no no no no listen listen
[1:04:52] listen listen
[1:04:53] all right god listen
[1:04:57] remember when you brought them out of
[1:04:58] egypt and what they're going to say and
[1:05:01] they'll just say you couldn't take them
[1:05:03] in and
[1:05:04] and god and
[1:05:05] and and and repent of this lord don't do
[1:05:08] this
[1:05:10] and remember what you told abraham
[1:05:12] isaac and jacob
[1:05:14] oh i'm sure god was
[1:05:16] if god had buttons to bust they were
[1:05:18] busting
[1:05:19] because that's what he was looking for
[1:05:22] that's what he wanted
[1:05:25] we wanted too many things easy
[1:05:28] but brother branham said christians are
[1:05:30] rugged
[1:05:32] they're not hot bed plants they don't
[1:05:34] need to be babied and petted they're
[1:05:36] rugged
[1:05:37] what he said
[1:05:39] you can't shake a believer off the word
[1:05:44] he's like a pit bull once he gets a hold
[1:05:46] of a tire
[1:05:48] you're not getting the let loose
[1:05:51] there's a believer who says this is god
[1:05:55] and i gotta have god
[1:06:00] let's turn to genesis 18.
[1:06:02] we went through this but i just want to
[1:06:03] go through it again
[1:06:05] if that's all right
[1:06:08] it's too late to say no
[1:06:11] this is 18 23.
[1:06:22] god's come down
[1:06:24] on the plains of memory and told abraham
[1:06:26] that
[1:06:27] they're now going to judge sodom
[1:06:30] verse 23 and abraham drew near and said
[1:06:32] wilt thou also destroy the righteous
[1:06:34] with the wicked
[1:06:37] per adventure there would be 50
[1:06:38] righteous within the city will thou also
[1:06:40] destroy and not spare the place for the
[1:06:42] 50 righteous that are therein
[1:06:48] and he says listen verse 25
[1:06:51] that be far from thee to do after this
[1:06:53] manner
[1:06:57] he's now calling god's character
[1:07:00] into question
[1:07:06] he said god you're going down islam but
[1:07:07] what if there's 50 down there that's
[1:07:09] righteous you wouldn't destroy the 50
[1:07:13] you wouldn't destroy the
[1:07:14] the righteous with the unrighteous you
[1:07:15] wouldn't destroy it because of the 50.
[1:07:18] he says
[1:07:19] that be far from thee to do after this
[1:07:21] manner
[1:07:22] to slay the righteous with the wicked
[1:07:25] and that the righteous should be as the
[1:07:26] wicked that be far from thee shall not
[1:07:28] the judge of all the earth do right
[1:07:33] who's he talking to
[1:07:36] who does he think he is
[1:07:40] it might just be christ in another form
[1:07:45] who does abraham think he is we know
[1:07:48] he's the elect seed of god we know he is
[1:07:51] the mystery of christ that's being
[1:07:52] unfolded in the old testament being
[1:07:54] unfolded through him we know that and
[1:07:56] now god comes down and he's letting
[1:07:58] abraham know hey i can't hide anything
[1:08:00] from you
[1:08:01] why couldn't he hide it from him
[1:08:04] because he's part of him
[1:08:08] i can't hide it from you and i begins to
[1:08:11] tell him about sodom well abraham has
[1:08:14] somebody he loves down in sodom
[1:08:17] and abraham he begins listen abraham
[1:08:20] begins to contend and barter with god
[1:08:25] and in his contending and bartering with
[1:08:27] god he's actually evoking the character
[1:08:31] of god to rise up
[1:08:33] he's saying god if far be it from you to
[1:08:35] do a thing like that i mean that
[1:08:38] wouldn't be like you to treat the
[1:08:40] righteous with the wicked wouldn't the
[1:08:42] judge of all the earth do right
[1:08:47] speaking to god like he's a child
[1:08:54] and god says no
[1:08:56] i won't destroy it for 50.
[1:09:00] see god wasn't upset at abraham
[1:09:04] god didn't get angry with abraham
[1:09:07] god was watching for abraham to respond
[1:09:12] abraham was playing the part god wanted
[1:09:14] him to play
[1:09:16] he goes on to 40 to 30 to you know all
[1:09:19] the numbers i'll pick it up in verse 32
[1:09:22] and he said oh
[1:09:23] let not the lord be angry he had done
[1:09:25] this with god i think four times already
[1:09:27] or something like that he kept saying
[1:09:29] and god would say he would relent to
[1:09:31] abraham abraham for fifty you what he
[1:09:33] said okay for 50. he says well what
[1:09:35] about for you know 45 or 40 whatever the
[1:09:37] number is and and god relents no i won't
[1:09:40] then he asks again and he asks what is
[1:09:42] he doing he's bartering with god
[1:09:45] he's negotiating with god
[1:09:50] he gets down verse 3 he said oh let not
[1:09:51] the lord be angry and i will speak yet
[1:09:53] but this once per adventure 10 shall be
[1:09:55] found there
[1:09:57] said i will not destroy it for ten sake
[1:09:59] and the lord went his way as soon as he
[1:10:01] had left communion with abraham and
[1:10:02] abraham returned into his place
[1:10:05] now we know god did not find 10 because
[1:10:07] he destroyed sodom and he said he
[1:10:09] wouldn't so there was not 10 righteous
[1:10:11] in sodom
[1:10:13] but chapter 19 verse 29
[1:10:16] says
[1:10:18] and it came to pass when god destroyed
[1:10:20] the cities of the plain that god
[1:10:22] remembered
[1:10:23] abraham
[1:10:25] and sent lot out of the midst of the
[1:10:27] overthrow when he overthrew the cities
[1:10:29] in which lot dwelt
[1:10:31] god did not remember lot but he
[1:10:33] remembered abraham
[1:10:35] abraham who interceded with god abraham
[1:10:38] who threw himself in front of god
[1:10:39] abraham who was bartering what was
[1:10:41] abraham bartering for a wicked city amen
[1:10:44] an evil city amen who was very wicked
[1:10:47] and it was well known that they were
[1:10:48] wicked amen but he was bartering for a
[1:10:50] reason there was a motive in his heart
[1:10:52] there was something he was trying to do
[1:10:54] he was standing in the place of
[1:10:56] intercession
[1:10:58] and god could not relinquish because
[1:11:01] abraham said i'll say this and i'll say
[1:11:03] nothing else
[1:11:04] 10.
[1:11:05] and god said i won't do it for 10.
[1:11:08] and abraham held his word he didn't say
[1:11:10] anything else
[1:11:12] and you have to imagine now
[1:11:14] i say this but i could be wrong but
[1:11:16] you'd have to imagine abraham all night
[1:11:18] toss and turn hoped god would find 10.
[1:11:23] brother branham said when you read the
[1:11:24] bible you have to read between the lines
[1:11:26] because the bible condenses its truths
[1:11:29] i mean this is this is the whole
[1:11:30] character of god but will condense it
[1:11:32] down into one line two lines a paragraph
[1:11:36] so no doubt abraham
[1:11:38] tossed and turned all night and
[1:11:40] and had a had a a night where he
[1:11:42] wondered what would happen because he
[1:11:44] told god he wouldn't say anything else
[1:11:46] ten zen he said ten god said ten and
[1:11:48] abraham i'm sure was hopeful that that
[1:11:51] would be enough
[1:11:52] he's probably thinking you have lot
[1:11:54] of his wife he's got two daughters he's
[1:11:56] got some other daughters and son-in-laws
[1:12:03] that might get it 10.
[1:12:08] when abraham got up that morning he went
[1:12:09] and he looked he saw it was all smoke
[1:12:14] i wonder how he felt
[1:12:17] i wonder if he felt like
[1:12:19] i shouldn't have said i won't say no
[1:12:21] more
[1:12:24] i wonder how he felt
[1:12:26] i wonder what thoughts were going
[1:12:27] through his mind as he looked at the
[1:12:28] smoldering ruins of sodom and the smoke
[1:12:31] going up like a furnace
[1:12:34] you think he didn't think about lot
[1:12:37] lot's wife
[1:12:38] and his nieces
[1:12:42] but god remembered abraham
[1:12:46] he remembered the role abraham was
[1:12:47] playing he remembered the desire of
[1:12:49] abraham's heart he remembered abraham
[1:12:52] bartering with him he remembered abraham
[1:12:54] contending with him and he remembered
[1:12:56] abraham and he saved lot which was the
[1:12:58] object that he was after to begin with
[1:13:02] god knew his heart god wasn't angry with
[1:13:05] abraham he wasn't going to punish
[1:13:06] abraham he wasn't upset with abraham but
[1:13:08] god honored abraham remembered abraham
[1:13:11] and saved lot not because of lot but
[1:13:13] because of abraham
[1:13:18] you have to ask yourselves what kind of
[1:13:19] people are these
[1:13:21] what kind of person is jacob what kind
[1:13:23] of person is abraham what kind of person
[1:13:26] is moses what kind of people are they
[1:13:28] and i want to say they're people just
[1:13:30] like me they are children of almighty
[1:13:32] god they are the heritage of the lord
[1:13:34] they are attributes expressed in their
[1:13:36] day of almighty god
[1:13:39] expressing to me how i ought to live in
[1:13:42] this day
[1:13:46] see
[1:13:47] to moses it wasn't trivial
[1:13:51] it wasn't light
[1:13:52] it was life and death
[1:13:55] to abraham it wasn't trivial it wasn't
[1:13:57] light it was life and death
[1:14:01] i want to turn to the book of acts if
[1:14:03] you could turn with me there
[1:14:10] i hope you don't think the bible's dead
[1:14:14] and i hope you don't think these are
[1:14:15] just for the old testament
[1:14:20] i hope you can begin to see
[1:14:22] who you really are
[1:14:26] if there's a people on the earth that
[1:14:27] have power with god
[1:14:29] who would they be
[1:14:33] if there are people on this earth who
[1:14:35] can prevail over the angel
[1:14:39] take the book
[1:14:40] and eat it
[1:14:42] who would they be
[1:14:46] ask yourself am i one of them
[1:14:49] is that who i am
[1:14:52] is that who god wants me to be
[1:14:54] or am i just a church member
[1:14:58] do i just want
[1:14:59] just to have a house and a job and a car
[1:15:02] and raise my family and go to church and
[1:15:05] just that's all i want
[1:15:08] i hope that's not all you want
[1:15:13] i hope you're tired of going to church
[1:15:15] and being challenged
[1:15:17] challenged on your walk challenged on
[1:15:19] your revelation challenged by the truth
[1:15:21] i'm tired of going to church and being
[1:15:23] challenged challenged challenged
[1:15:26] well i hope that's not who you are
[1:15:31] i hope the challenge of the word is
[1:15:33] calling you higher
[1:15:35] i hope the challenge in the word and the
[1:15:37] revelation is saying listen it's me come
[1:15:40] up higher amen don't stay where you're
[1:15:43] at rise amen stretch your wings and fly
[1:15:46] you've got to move on we've got to go
[1:15:48] farther we've got to rise above where we
[1:15:50] are we can't stay like this forever we
[1:15:52] got to keep moving with god
[1:15:59] i hope we recognize who we are
[1:16:02] it was never easy for any believer ever
[1:16:06] in the day in the age they lived
[1:16:10] it was never simple it was always
[1:16:12] complicated
[1:16:14] it was never without strife it always
[1:16:16] had strife
[1:16:17] it was never without rejection it was
[1:16:19] never without wrestlings it was never
[1:16:21] without all of these things every age
[1:16:24] everyone they had their own trials
[1:16:28] god didn't make it simple because the
[1:16:30] gifts or the rewards are to the
[1:16:31] overcomers
[1:16:34] god made it simple then there's nothing
[1:16:35] for you to receive
[1:16:38] because he gives all the rewards amen to
[1:16:41] the overcomers
[1:16:43] and the inheritance goes to the
[1:16:44] overcomers
[1:16:46] and god makes promises to the overcomers
[1:16:48] so god in his faithfulness and his
[1:16:50] generosity make sure that you have
[1:16:52] plenty to overcome so you can get plenty
[1:16:54] of rewards
[1:16:58] acts chapter 27.
[1:17:10] acts chapter 27
[1:17:13] the apostle paul
[1:17:15] is being sent to rome
[1:17:17] he's been arrested but he's committed no
[1:17:19] crime
[1:17:21] he has no official charge
[1:17:23] because the centurion just picked him up
[1:17:25] because he was being beaten by the jews
[1:17:27] and he had to rescue him the only place
[1:17:29] to rescue him was to hide him in prison
[1:17:30] so he kept him hiding in prison for a
[1:17:32] couple years but paul had never done
[1:17:34] anything wrong there was no criminal
[1:17:36] trial there was nothing no charges
[1:17:38] against him
[1:17:41] every official that tried him said he is
[1:17:43] worthy of neither death nor bonds every
[1:17:46] one
[1:17:48] but god had already told him
[1:17:51] fear not
[1:17:53] for as thou has testified in jerusalem
[1:17:55] so shall thou testify of me in rome
[1:17:58] so paul knows he's going to rome the the
[1:18:01] lord told him he was going to rome when
[1:18:03] he was arrested he knows his destiny is
[1:18:05] in rome
[1:18:07] is that right
[1:18:09] not because he committed a crime or did
[1:18:10] anything wrong because he has to testify
[1:18:12] in rome
[1:18:15] in the journey
[1:18:18] they're sailing and they're sailing at
[1:18:19] wintertime
[1:18:21] and paul tries to encourage them not to
[1:18:23] leave this harbor this port because he
[1:18:26] tells him don't go let's wait this
[1:18:28] winter and the captain of the ship tells
[1:18:30] the centurion who's in charge of the
[1:18:32] soldiers no we must go and the captain
[1:18:34] believes is the master of the ship and
[1:18:35] they go on and then they get caught in a
[1:18:37] terrible storm a typhoon and this
[1:18:40] typhoon is raging for multiple days it's
[1:18:42] raging by the time it's over and by the
[1:18:44] time they shipwreck it'll be 14 days
[1:18:48] and paul's on the ship and the the
[1:18:51] the soldiers are on the ship there's 200
[1:18:53] and some souls on the ship over 250
[1:18:56] souls on the ship
[1:18:58] and paul had been journeying with him
[1:18:59] for a while and the centurion had been
[1:19:02] really good to him because when they
[1:19:03] stopped at different ports he would give
[1:19:04] him liberty to go be refreshed with his
[1:19:06] friends
[1:19:08] it appears that luke was traveling with
[1:19:10] him because luke is the one who's
[1:19:11] writing this and luke says we we
[1:19:13] dispatch we lose from this so it looks
[1:19:15] like at least he has one companion maybe
[1:19:17] more traveling with him
[1:19:19] they have the merchants or the the the
[1:19:21] sailors on the merchant ship the master
[1:19:23] of the ship the centurion the soldiers
[1:19:26] the prisoners
[1:19:27] and in this time paul is on has had
[1:19:30] ample opportunity to know some of them
[1:19:32] at least
[1:19:34] like i said the centurion was good to
[1:19:36] him
[1:19:37] who knows who else he had contact with
[1:19:38] and communication spoke with and the
[1:19:41] weeks that they were journeying
[1:19:43] but they come to the storm
[1:19:46] and the storm is such a storm that even
[1:19:49] the sailors knew that all was lost like
[1:19:51] there was no
[1:19:52] hope there's no chance
[1:19:54] that the seamen who had been through
[1:19:56] storms before knew that we're finished
[1:20:00] let's look in verse 20
[1:20:03] and when neither sun nor stars in many
[1:20:05] days appeared
[1:20:06] and no snow small tempest lay on us
[1:20:10] all hope that we should have been we
[1:20:13] should be saved was then taken away
[1:20:16] there's no hope now
[1:20:19] but after a long abstinence
[1:20:22] paul stood forth in the midst of them
[1:20:24] and said sirs
[1:20:25] you should have hearkened unto me and
[1:20:27] not have loosed from crete and to have
[1:20:29] gained this harm and lost
[1:20:31] and now i exhort you to be of good cheer
[1:20:33] for there shall be no loss of any man's
[1:20:35] life among you
[1:20:37] but of the ship
[1:20:38] for there stood by me this night the
[1:20:40] angel of god whose i am and whom i serve
[1:20:44] saying fear not paul
[1:20:47] thou must be brought before caesar
[1:20:50] now stop don't read on please don't read
[1:20:52] on you ruined the whole thing for me
[1:20:58] what's paul doing in a long abstinence
[1:21:02] sleeping
[1:21:06] my personal opinion is he was praying
[1:21:11] because luke was the one writing this
[1:21:13] and said we saw that there was no more
[1:21:15] hope all all hope was lost
[1:21:18] but paul appeared after long abstinence
[1:21:21] he hadn't been around on the deck he
[1:21:23] hadn't been visible to the soldiers and
[1:21:25] sailors and centurion and
[1:21:28] even luke
[1:21:29] his companion
[1:21:31] he was off by himself separated
[1:21:35] and my opinion is he was praying
[1:21:37] because during the abstinence while he
[1:21:39] was gone the angel of the lord and says
[1:21:42] fear not
[1:21:44] thou must be brought before caesar
[1:21:47] so it makes you wonder was he asking
[1:21:49] about the prophecy
[1:21:52] was he maybe reminding god god you told
[1:21:54] me i will testify in rome
[1:21:57] because you got to think these it wasn't
[1:21:59] just like a little wave and some rain
[1:22:00] and a little bit of splashing over the
[1:22:02] boat they had already thrown out every
[1:22:04] bit of merchandise on the ship
[1:22:06] they had thrown out all the extra tackle
[1:22:09] they had gotten rid of everything the
[1:22:11] light and the load so that they wouldn't
[1:22:12] sing they had nothing they absolutely
[1:22:14] had nothing no hope nothing
[1:22:18] but paul had the word of the lord that
[1:22:20] told him he's going to go to rome
[1:22:23] so now paul is in a long abstinence
[1:22:26] separated not visible amen any and and
[1:22:30] while he's in this absence which i
[1:22:31] believe was prayer and intercession
[1:22:35] the lord said to him
[1:22:40] where am i
[1:22:46] okay
[1:22:48] he said yeah
[1:22:51] the angel that's verse 23 again for
[1:22:53] there stood by me
[1:22:54] this night the angel of god whose i am
[1:22:57] and who whom i serve
[1:22:59] saying fear not paul thou must be
[1:23:02] brought before caesar and lo god hath
[1:23:04] given thee all them that sail with thee
[1:23:12] what was paul worried about
[1:23:15] what was paul asking for
[1:23:19] what was the purpose of paul's long
[1:23:21] abstinence
[1:23:22] i can't say for certain but all i can
[1:23:24] say was the angel's response
[1:23:27] the angel's response to paul was
[1:23:30] don't fear paul thou must be brought
[1:23:32] before caesar and lo
[1:23:34] i have given you every soul that is in
[1:23:37] the ship
[1:23:39] every soul whether they're believer or
[1:23:42] not believer amen whether they whether
[1:23:44] they were a soldier or a merchant or a
[1:23:48] companion
[1:23:49] every soul was given to paul not by
[1:23:52] their merit but because of paul they
[1:23:54] were given to paul
[1:23:57] they weren't given to god they weren't
[1:23:58] given to christ they were given to paul
[1:24:01] i want to say what kind of man is this
[1:24:03] amen what kind of man is this that in
[1:24:06] the midst of a hopeless situation god
[1:24:08] will come to this man and then the angel
[1:24:10] whose i am and whom i serve what kind of
[1:24:14] angel was that that was the angel of the
[1:24:15] lord that was god himself
[1:24:18] [Music]
[1:24:20] come to paul and said don't fear paul
[1:24:23] you must be brought before caesar
[1:24:28] and i give you
[1:24:31] every soul
[1:24:33] that is in the ship with you
[1:24:37] friends what kind of person
[1:24:40] has power with
[1:24:42] god what kind of power is this
[1:24:48] what
[1:24:49] what kind of
[1:24:51] what kind of
[1:24:53] people
[1:24:54] are we dealing with
[1:24:56] when we talk about paul
[1:24:58] when we talk about abraham when we talk
[1:25:00] about moses when we talk about jacob
[1:25:04] i believe we're talking about a god race
[1:25:09] a god race a supersede
[1:25:12] that's who i believe we're talking about
[1:25:15] that paul's very presence on that ship
[1:25:18] and listen they didn't listen to him
[1:25:22] he told them not to leave they didn't
[1:25:24] listen to him they got themselves in the
[1:25:27] fix because they didn't listen to him
[1:25:28] but in getting themselves into the fix
[1:25:30] they got paul in a fix and paul in the
[1:25:32] long abstinence is doing something
[1:25:35] and in this long absence the angel lord
[1:25:37] says fear
[1:25:38] not you're going to appear before caesar
[1:25:41] and
[1:25:42] i have given you every soul
[1:25:45] that's in this ship
[1:25:47] look what paul does next
[1:25:53] verse 24 he's saying fear not paul thou
[1:25:55] must be brought before caesar and lo god
[1:25:58] hath given thee
[1:25:59] god hath given thee all them that sail
[1:26:02] with thee
[1:26:04] wherefore sirs be of good cheer
[1:26:07] for i believe god that it shall be even
[1:26:10] as it was told me
[1:26:14] paul never told them you have to believe
[1:26:18] paul says be of good cheer i believe god
[1:26:21] amen and i believe it'll be done so what
[1:26:24] he told me if you don't believe that's
[1:26:26] up to you but i believe and because i
[1:26:29] believe you're going to be saved
[1:26:33] because i believe god because i'm here
[1:26:36] because i have a destiny
[1:26:38] in caesar's court because in my
[1:26:40] abstinence i i met an angel and the
[1:26:42] angel told me that i am going to go to
[1:26:45] caesar and that all the souls on the
[1:26:47] ship were given to me to me
[1:26:50] they were given to paul
[1:26:52] do you understand that i give to thee
[1:26:55] every soul meaning nobody's going to die
[1:26:58] paul comes out and says cheer up
[1:27:02] the sun is up
[1:27:04] the trial's over
[1:27:06] hey listen waves were crashing over the
[1:27:08] ship the sails were torn the tackle was
[1:27:11] gone he says be of good cheer amen be of
[1:27:14] good cheer it's all over i've heard from
[1:27:17] the lord you're all going to be saved
[1:27:21] and they must have believed him
[1:27:23] because they all started eating
[1:27:26] he says he says here
[1:27:31] verse 25 therefore serves be of good
[1:27:33] cheer i believe god that it shall be
[1:27:34] even as it was told me how be it we must
[1:27:38] be cast upon a certain island but when
[1:27:41] the fourteenth night was come as we were
[1:27:43] driven up and down in adria about
[1:27:46] midnight the shipment deemed that they
[1:27:48] drew near some country i'm not going to
[1:27:50] read all that you read it all later but
[1:27:52] paul tells them to take meat and eat and
[1:27:54] they start eating because they had not
[1:27:55] been eating for some period of time
[1:27:57] because they were so worried and so
[1:27:58] troubled amen and paul was so convinced
[1:28:01] and believed god amen he convinced him
[1:28:04] to eat and they eat
[1:28:06] when it come time to go ashore he told
[1:28:08] them to eat because you're going to need
[1:28:09] strength they listened to him but all
[1:28:11] those souls were given to
[1:28:14] paul
[1:28:18] what kind of man
[1:28:20] is this
[1:28:31] brother bam says in blind bartimaeus
[1:28:34] we got faith to believe that god can do
[1:28:36] it and we'll do it
[1:28:37] let's take a hold of it and hold on just
[1:28:39] don't let it go stay right with it if it
[1:28:42] don't come now it'll come ten minutes
[1:28:44] later hour later two weeks later month
[1:28:47] later no matter when it comes i gotta
[1:28:49] hold and i'm going to stay with it
[1:28:52] let's turn to the book of daniel
[1:28:58] we're also very familiar with this but i
[1:29:00] just i just wish to read it daniel
[1:29:02] chapter 10.
[1:29:12] daniel chapter 10
[1:29:14] verse 11.
[1:29:16] an angel would come and touched
[1:29:18] daniel he says in eleven and he said
[1:29:21] unto me o daniel
[1:29:22] a man greatly beloved
[1:29:26] daniel is in a special position with god
[1:29:32] daniel
[1:29:33] is greatly
[1:29:35] beloved
[1:29:36] he said to me doe daniel a man greatly
[1:29:38] beloved understand the words that i
[1:29:40] speak unto thee and stand upright for
[1:29:42] unto thee am i now sent and when he had
[1:29:44] spoken this word unto me i stood
[1:29:45] trembling
[1:29:46] then said he unto me fear not daniel for
[1:29:49] from the first day that thou did set
[1:29:51] thine heart to understand
[1:29:53] and to chasten thyself before thy god
[1:29:55] thy words were heard and i am come for
[1:29:57] thy words but the prince of the kingdom
[1:30:00] of persia which stood in me one in
[1:30:01] twenty days but lo
[1:30:03] michael one of the chief princes come to
[1:30:05] help me and i remain there with the
[1:30:08] kings of persia
[1:30:10] now i am come to make thee understand
[1:30:12] what shall befall thee thy people in the
[1:30:14] latter days for yet the vision is for
[1:30:16] many days
[1:30:18] we've talked about this before but when
[1:30:20] we preached several weeks ago i'm moving
[1:30:22] the heavenlies from earth but daniel
[1:30:25] daniel is a man
[1:30:26] but when this man set his heart to pray
[1:30:29] and inflicted himself and began to fast
[1:30:31] and pray for the revelation to come the
[1:30:33] very day he set his heart to seek god
[1:30:36] god sent an angel
[1:30:39] this angel now the moving of this angel
[1:30:42] was going to trigger a sequence of
[1:30:45] events that was going to bring the
[1:30:47] collapse of babylon and the collapse of
[1:30:50] the medes and the persians i'm sorry and
[1:30:51] bring in through alexander great bring
[1:30:54] in the greek empire
[1:30:56] but it was dependent on a man
[1:30:59] on earth
[1:31:01] not just any man
[1:31:03] one that was greatly beloved
[1:31:06] a special man of a special race of a
[1:31:09] special seed line and when that man
[1:31:11] began to pray amen heaven went into
[1:31:14] action and began to move and warfare
[1:31:16] broke out and we've talked about all of
[1:31:17] that but but now
[1:31:19] because daniel's still praying and
[1:31:21] because daniel set the heavens in motion
[1:31:24] he stays in prayer for 21 days daniel
[1:31:27] doesn't pray for a day get no answer and
[1:31:29] stop daniel wants to know there's
[1:31:31] something motivating him to have the
[1:31:33] answer and he's sticking with it until
[1:31:36] the answer comes
[1:31:38] and while he's sticking with it it's not
[1:31:40] as if nothing's happening in his
[1:31:42] perspective nothing's happening but if
[1:31:44] we had heavenly vision you would see
[1:31:46] that there was a lot happening and what
[1:31:48] was happening what daniel's fasting
[1:31:51] daniel sprang was triggering events this
[1:31:53] event this event now we'll get michael
[1:31:55] michaels involved and now i'll go back
[1:31:57] and i'll fight again i'll stand against
[1:31:59] the king of persia and after that the
[1:32:01] the prince of greece shall come
[1:32:05] nations were going to be toppled amen
[1:32:07] changing towers and kingdoms are going
[1:32:09] to take place because daniel was
[1:32:12] motivated to know something out of the
[1:32:14] word
[1:32:16] daniel saw the time of a promise and
[1:32:19] daniel begin to pray and fast and
[1:32:20] afflict himself to know the answer to
[1:32:23] the question is this the time sirs
[1:32:28] and as he began to pray an angel was
[1:32:31] dispatched warfare broke out things
[1:32:33] began to happen and after the message
[1:32:36] came through he brings a revelation to
[1:32:38] him and he goes back for a time of
[1:32:39] changing of powers
[1:32:42] i say what kind of man is this
[1:32:45] he's the same kind as the rest we've
[1:32:47] talked about
[1:32:50] brother branham says in the message
[1:32:51] accepting god's provided way at the end
[1:32:53] time
[1:32:56] he said
[1:32:57] cry for your needs that's god's provided
[1:32:59] way didn't jesus explain it when he said
[1:33:01] the unjust judge to the woman that cried
[1:33:03] day and night
[1:33:06] cry for it let's look at that in luke
[1:33:08] chapter 18. turn with me to luke chapter
[1:33:10] 18.
[1:33:29] in luke 18 verse 1
[1:33:32] he said he said a spake a parable unto
[1:33:34] them to this end that men not always to
[1:33:37] pray and not to faint
[1:33:40] so jesus teaches a parable for one
[1:33:42] purpose for this purpose and the purpose
[1:33:45] of the parable is that men will learn to
[1:33:47] pray and not faint
[1:33:51] saying there was in a city a judge which
[1:33:53] feared not god and neither regarded man
[1:33:56] there was a widow in that city and she
[1:33:58] came unto him saying
[1:33:59] avenge me in my adversary
[1:34:01] and
[1:34:02] and he would not for a while but
[1:34:04] afterward he said within himself though
[1:34:05] i fear not god nor regard man
[1:34:08] yet because this widow troubleth me i
[1:34:11] will avenge her lest by her continual
[1:34:13] coming she weary me
[1:34:15] and the lord said hear what the unjust
[1:34:17] judge saith
[1:34:18] and shall not god avenge his own elect
[1:34:20] which cry day and night unto him though
[1:34:22] he bear along with them i tell you that
[1:34:25] he will avenge them speedily
[1:34:26] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:34:28] shall he find faith on the earth
[1:34:31] jesus told them this parable to this end
[1:34:34] so that men will know how to pray
[1:34:36] without fainting
[1:34:38] he's telling you by the parable don't
[1:34:41] give up
[1:34:44] he might be telling you by the parable
[1:34:46] if i could say it this way that the
[1:34:48] widow prevailed over the judge
[1:34:54] i would say it this way the widow had
[1:34:56] power with the
[1:34:58] judge and the widow woman prevailed over
[1:35:02] the judge and jesus is using this as an
[1:35:04] example to teach us how to pray and not
[1:35:07] faint don't give up amen we're not here
[1:35:10] to pester god god's not going to get
[1:35:11] pestered and get upset with us but he's
[1:35:14] looking for somebody that will stick
[1:35:15] with it amen that'll stay with it
[1:35:18] that'll persevere he's looking for the
[1:35:20] other part of that attribute
[1:35:23] the other man goes and says
[1:35:25] cry for your needs that's god's provided
[1:35:27] way didn't jesus explain it when he said
[1:35:29] the unjust judge to the woman that
[1:35:31] crieth day and night how much more will
[1:35:33] the heavenly father give them the spirit
[1:35:34] who cry for it day and night
[1:35:36] seek keep seeking knock keep knocking
[1:35:40] just keep on till the open stay out with
[1:35:42] it cry until the promised word is
[1:35:44] vindicated then you got it you don't
[1:35:46] have to worry no more you see the bible
[1:35:48] promised it then stay right there and
[1:35:50] cry until you get it
[1:35:54] if you see the bible promised it stay
[1:35:56] right there and cry till you get it
[1:36:00] you mean
[1:36:02] you mean
[1:36:03] i shouldn't quit crying
[1:36:06] i think that's what he said
[1:36:09] do you mean that maybe
[1:36:11] i could even do what moses did and said
[1:36:13] god remember in your word when it says
[1:36:16] by your stripes i'm healed
[1:36:19] could you maybe remind god of the word
[1:36:23] amen and maybe that's what he's looking
[1:36:25] for maybe he's looking for that other
[1:36:26] part of the attribute but he said god
[1:36:28] you've got to fulfill your word god what
[1:36:31] about your enemies that say this word
[1:36:32] isn't true
[1:36:34] god what about all of those that say
[1:36:36] that many days and miracles are passed
[1:36:38] what about all of those that said he
[1:36:39] used to heal doesn't heal anymore god
[1:36:41] what will all your enemies think when
[1:36:43] they hear i've already testified at work
[1:36:45] i've already told others that i'm
[1:36:46] believing your word god what about your
[1:36:48] character and god do you remember what
[1:36:50] you said
[1:36:53] is there still a people on the earth
[1:36:54] that has power with god
[1:36:59] he said
[1:37:02] cry until you get it now listen how
[1:37:04] brother brahm describes this
[1:37:06] if a little baby sees a cookie and he
[1:37:08] wants it he'd just cry and cry and cry
[1:37:10] and stick and kick and scream and holler
[1:37:12] and turn red in the face
[1:37:14] his mommy will get him a cookie and it's
[1:37:15] all over see he got what he saw what he
[1:37:18] wanted if he wants to lick off your ice
[1:37:20] cream cone he'll just keep raising a
[1:37:22] fuss till he gets it
[1:37:24] well that's the way we're supposed to do
[1:37:28] is that what he said
[1:37:29] that's the way we're supposed to do
[1:37:32] if i see a promise in the bible that's
[1:37:34] god's word then i just stay there and
[1:37:36] cry out until god gives it to me and
[1:37:38] he'd do that get you off his hand he'll
[1:37:41] do that to get you off his hands
[1:37:43] you see that would be in in the natural
[1:37:45] but he's wanting you to do it he likes
[1:37:48] for you to ask ask abundantly that your
[1:37:50] joys might be full cry until his word is
[1:37:53] vindicated now friend let's watch just a
[1:37:55] minute and i'll cry until the word is
[1:37:57] vindicated
[1:38:00] let's turn to james chapter 5.
[1:38:10] james chapter 5
[1:38:12] and verse 16.
[1:38:18] james 5 and 16
[1:38:20] confess your faults one to another and
[1:38:22] pray one for another that you may be
[1:38:24] healed the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:38:27] righteous man availeth much is that true
[1:38:32] i think we're supposed to have
[1:38:33] fervent effectual prayer
[1:38:37] verse 17
[1:38:39] elias was a man subject to like passions
[1:38:41] he's going to use this as an example of
[1:38:43] how you have to pray fervently
[1:38:47] elias was a man subject to like passions
[1:38:49] as we are and he prayed earnestly that
[1:38:51] it might not rain and it rained not on
[1:38:53] the earth by the space of three years
[1:38:55] and six months and he prayed again and
[1:38:57] the heaven gave rain and the earth
[1:38:59] brought forth her fruit
[1:39:02] what is he showing as an example to us
[1:39:06] he didn't say well god you know god told
[1:39:09] elias to go say it's not going to rain
[1:39:11] and it was just easy he just said didn't
[1:39:13] rain didn't rain it was time to rain he
[1:39:15] said let it rain that's not how the
[1:39:17] bible depicts it that's not how the
[1:39:18] bible shows it it said he prayed
[1:39:20] earnestly that it wouldn't reign he
[1:39:22] contended for he prayed for it he sought
[1:39:25] god for it and it rained not and then it
[1:39:27] was time to reign again after the mount
[1:39:29] carmel showdown he put his face between
[1:39:32] his knees and he began to pray and he
[1:39:34] sent a servant he said go see if there's
[1:39:36] rain there was no rain he came again he
[1:39:38] prayed more what was he doing he was
[1:39:40] praying earnestly friends
[1:39:43] he wasn't saying well if god said he
[1:39:46] wants it it's going to happen if he
[1:39:47] doesn't want it it ain't going to happen
[1:39:49] no he sat there with his face between
[1:39:51] his knees and earnestly sought god for
[1:39:52] reign to keep the promise to keep the
[1:39:55] word to keep what was spoken
[1:39:59] and he did this seven times and on the
[1:40:01] seventh time his servant says i see a
[1:40:03] cloud coming out of the sea like a man's
[1:40:06] hand
[1:40:07] and he said run until ahab this is it
[1:40:11] i hear an abundance of rain
[1:40:14] even for elias in the prophecy it wasn't
[1:40:17] trivial it wasn't light it wasn't easy
[1:40:19] he had to pray earnestly
[1:40:22] that it would rain
[1:40:28] brother brahman says in questions and
[1:40:30] answers on the seals
[1:40:33] like you look in the bible it says knock
[1:40:35] and it'll be open seeking ask to be
[1:40:37] given now if you'll notice it's knocketh
[1:40:39] just constantly knock
[1:40:42] not one knock but knock it the continual
[1:40:45] knocking
[1:40:47] stay right there like the unjust judge
[1:40:49] wouldn't answer the woman he just kept
[1:40:51] knocking on her door saying i'm on your
[1:40:53] hand not seek say lord i love i'd like
[1:40:56] to have this amen that's not it stay
[1:40:58] right there till you get it you know
[1:41:00] it's going to come so he promised it so
[1:41:02] just stay right there till you hold
[1:41:05] on to it
[1:41:08] he says in god's provided way for this
[1:41:11] day in 1964 there is no better way they
[1:41:13] never found a better way for a baby to
[1:41:15] get what it wants than to cry for it
[1:41:18] would you give him a bounce hey junior
[1:41:19] you're only three days old but now when
[1:41:21] you want to when you want your bottle
[1:41:23] raise up this little bell and ring it if
[1:41:24] it works it don't work the baby cries
[1:41:26] for what it wants that's god's provided
[1:41:28] way the louder you cry don't whip the
[1:41:31] little fella he's only following god's
[1:41:32] provided way
[1:41:34] he's not talking about when he's 10
[1:41:35] right
[1:41:37] talking about an infant
[1:41:40] he's coming god's provided way
[1:41:42] he wants something that's right it's the
[1:41:44] only way he knows to call his mother
[1:41:46] scream for it cry for it that's right
[1:41:48] god recommends this for his children god
[1:41:50] recommend recommends this for his
[1:41:52] believing children
[1:41:54] he did not intellectual speeches not
[1:41:56] some great theology theology to teach he
[1:41:58] wants you to cry for your needs and
[1:42:01] that's right cry out for it you're too
[1:42:03] stiff and starchy you'll never get it if
[1:42:05] you're ready to limber yourself up a
[1:42:07] little and cry god will give it to you
[1:42:09] he likes to hear his children cry cry
[1:42:11] your needs to god god wants it that's
[1:42:13] his provided way cry out for it that's
[1:42:16] the way the baby cries that's the way he
[1:42:18] wants you to cry cry how long how long
[1:42:21] does a baby cry until he gets satisfied
[1:42:24] and that's the way the believing
[1:42:26] christians should do god's child if you
[1:42:27] see that god made the promise don't give
[1:42:29] it up cry till it's answered cry though
[1:42:31] you see god vindicates his word then god
[1:42:34] vindicates his word and proves it it's
[1:42:36] here then you don't have to cry no more
[1:42:38] you got it walk away and thank him for
[1:42:40] it until you do that scream out till you
[1:42:42] get it i like that persistent holding on
[1:42:46] not a hybrid plan not one that has to be
[1:42:49] babied petted packed around christians
[1:42:51] are real genuine born articles of god
[1:42:54] they fight for their position they fight
[1:42:56] for their finishes they fight till
[1:42:58] they're finished on this earth every
[1:43:00] move of it is a fight
[1:43:05] god didn't call us to a picnic he's
[1:43:06] called us to a battle
[1:43:11] god tells us a story
[1:43:14] through the prophet
[1:43:17] we've heard about moses we've talked
[1:43:19] about daniel we talked about elijah or
[1:43:21] yeah elijah
[1:43:23] talked about abraham talked about daniel
[1:43:26] we talked about paul
[1:43:29] but brother branham tells us a story
[1:43:30] about another great one that has power
[1:43:32] with god
[1:43:34] god tells us the story of another great
[1:43:36] christian that prevailed
[1:43:39] that overcame and prevailed
[1:43:42] and this was a little black woman a poor
[1:43:44] woman down in the south
[1:43:48] brother bam says
[1:43:49] and this old colored woman when i passed
[1:43:52] by
[1:43:53] she said good morning parson
[1:43:57] so i'm minister in the south as a parson

[1:48:11] felt more welcoming at home than i did
[1:48:13] in that little home
[1:48:16] i want to tell you why
[1:48:18] because one of those rare breeds was in
[1:48:21] that house
[1:48:22] one of those rares see the super seed
[1:48:24] was there amen amen the seed of god was
[1:48:26] abiding in that house one of those rare
[1:48:29] individuals that had power with god one
[1:48:31] of those rare individuals that could
[1:48:33] wrestle and overcome was living in that
[1:48:35] house and she wrestled all night till
[1:48:38] she brought up a storm god brought up a
[1:48:40] storm because she wouldn't let this boy
[1:48:42] die in that condition she was
[1:48:44] interceding for his soul i ask you what
[1:48:47] kind of woman is this
[1:48:49] what kind of power does she have
[1:48:53] what kind of human being is this that
[1:48:55] can begin praying for her baby all night
[1:48:58] and god will bring storms up god will
[1:49:00] reroute flights god will ground planes
[1:49:05] god will cause a man to keep walking to
[1:49:07] mrs plane miss his plans miss whatever
[1:49:09] he's got in his mind
[1:49:11] to direct that man right to her door
[1:49:15] what kind of woman is remember friends
[1:49:18] this had nothing to do with the prophet
[1:49:19] it wasn't his vision it wasn't his
[1:49:21] prayer it was hers she directed all of
[1:49:24] this
[1:49:26] because she was asking god i'm just like
[1:49:29] this woman in the bible this is who i am
[1:49:32] i'm one of your bible characters where's
[1:49:34] the other bible character
[1:49:38] where's my elijah so god had to send her
[1:49:41] an elixir
[1:49:44] we know the intercession of the woman
[1:49:47] worked because brother branham prayed
[1:49:48] for the boy
[1:49:50] he left
[1:49:51] he said some time later he was traveling
[1:49:53] back through tennessee and there was a
[1:49:55] boy working there at a hamburger stand
[1:49:57] he said great big tall strong fella says
[1:49:59] do you remember me he says no he says
[1:50:01] you remember one night when you prayed
[1:50:03] for a boy laying on the bed that's me he
[1:50:05] said and i'm a christian now i'm serving
[1:50:07] jesus
[1:50:09] what kind of person are we dealing with
[1:50:12] i'm said she was the same stock that
[1:50:15] moses was she's from the same stock as
[1:50:18] jacob she's of the same stock as the
[1:50:20] apostle paul and i'm of the same stock
[1:50:23] friends
[1:50:24] and that woman didn't pray a passing
[1:50:26] prayer she didn't pay a trivial prayer
[1:50:29] over a morning breakfast they meant she
[1:50:31] got down all night and prayed and she
[1:50:34] wrestled with god until she prevailed
[1:50:40] god is looking for the counterpart
[1:50:43] god is looking for somebody that
[1:50:45] believes him so much they won't stop
[1:50:48] he's looking for somebody that's got so
[1:50:50] much faith in his character
[1:50:53] that says lord you can't not fulfill
[1:50:55] your word
[1:50:56] they got so much confidence in his
[1:50:58] nature and his character and in his
[1:51:00] promises that they'll even remind god
[1:51:02] god this can't fail because you said do
[1:51:05] you remember your word you told me that
[1:51:07] i could have this lord it's not like you
[1:51:09] to withhold it
[1:51:13] oh praise god friends what kind of
[1:51:16] person are you
[1:51:18] what kind of person was moses what kind
[1:51:20] of person was jacob what kind of person
[1:51:22] was this washer woman and i want to ask
[1:51:24] you what kind of person are you amen is
[1:51:26] there something inside of you says this
[1:51:28] word is true and it has to work amen the
[1:51:31] promise for my healing has to work the
[1:51:33] promise for my children has to work the
[1:51:35] promise that i've been given has to work
[1:51:40] i'm the same kind of stock of the same
[1:51:43] seed i've got the birthright the same
[1:51:46] thing that was in them is in me and i've
[1:51:48] got the same desire and i'm not taking
[1:51:51] it trivial and i'm not taking it lightly
[1:51:53] but i'm going to wrestle with this till
[1:51:55] it comes to pass
[1:51:57] i'm going to hold on to that promise
[1:51:59] with both hands until it comes to pass
[1:52:01] in my life i'm not going to make excuses
[1:52:03] i'm not going to explain it away but i'm
[1:52:05] going to stay with it and wrestle and
[1:52:07] wrestle and wrestle and wrestle until i
[1:52:10] prevail
[1:52:16] and when i wrestle
[1:52:18] and wrestle and wrestle until i prevail
[1:52:23] do you know what i'll say
[1:52:26] god won the victory
[1:52:28] because it wasn't me
[1:52:31] it was god that prevailed in me
[1:52:34] it wasn't that washer woman it was god
[1:52:37] in that washerwoman
[1:52:40] she didn't have the power to ground that
[1:52:42] plane
[1:52:43] she didn't have the power to see a
[1:52:44] vision of a dream of a prophet coming it
[1:52:48] was god working through her vessel to
[1:52:50] save that boy
[1:52:52] he could no longer pray for himself but
[1:52:54] he had one that could intercede for him
[1:52:56] and she happened to be of the right seed
[1:53:01] see it's not you and i we're called the
[1:53:03] labor to cry out to pray but you'll
[1:53:06] never do it as a human being born of
[1:53:08] your earthly mom and dad amen you can
[1:53:10] cry and cry and cry and nothing's going
[1:53:12] to happen it's not about noise it's not
[1:53:14] about emotions but there's something in
[1:53:16] you that's more than you there's
[1:53:17] something deep inside that says god
[1:53:20] can't fail this word it has got to
[1:53:22] happen amen it's got to happen for the
[1:53:24] sake of god it's got to happen for the
[1:53:26] sake of god's children it's got to
[1:53:28] happen for the word's sake
[1:53:31] and i can't let down on it i can't back
[1:53:33] down on it i can't give it up i believe
[1:53:36] it's going to work and i'm not going to
[1:53:37] give up till it works
[1:53:40] and when it works and god fulfills his
[1:53:42] word
[1:53:44] maybe you're israel
[1:53:47] maybe it was god
[1:53:50] that was really prevailing
[1:53:53] maybe it was
[1:53:54] god
[1:53:55] the seed gene of faith down inside of
[1:53:58] you crying out
[1:53:59] to god the father of the sea gene saying
[1:54:03] bring it to pass and the two omnipotents
[1:54:05] were coming
[1:54:06] together to fulfill his word
[1:54:12] we always look at it as so easy and
[1:54:15] i mean like a fairy floating through and
[1:54:19] i'll have this and i'll have that and
[1:54:21] let this be
[1:54:24] and the prophet of god's ministry how
[1:54:26] many nights did he spend in prayer how
[1:54:27] many days did he spend in his cave
[1:54:30] how many hours seeking the lord how many
[1:54:33] fastings before prayer meetings
[1:54:36] god was working on both ends
[1:54:39] god is faithful to keep his word how
[1:54:42] faithful are we to
[1:54:43] hold him to his word and believe his
[1:54:45] word and hold on to it until it comes to
[1:54:47] pass he's faithful are we faithful
[1:54:50] he's determined to see it through are
[1:54:52] you determined to see it through
[1:54:54] he's determined to keep his word are you
[1:54:56] determined to see it through
[1:54:59] what kind of seed are we
[1:55:02] i say god i believe by faith whatever
[1:55:05] that washer woman is i am
[1:55:08] whatever moses was i am amen whatever
[1:55:10] jacob was i whatever it was moving
[1:55:12] through them that's the same thing
[1:55:14] moving in my heart it's more than
[1:55:15] intellect it's more than emotion there's
[1:55:17] a driving force inside of me that says
[1:55:19] this word is it and it has to come to
[1:55:21] pass god's nature won't fail god won't
[1:55:24] let it down this is the only way
[1:55:28] and i'm not going to turn it loose until
[1:55:30] i see the fulfillment of every promise
[1:55:32] in this end time
[1:55:34] everything that's been restored
[1:55:36] everything that the title deed book has
[1:55:38] been given because that title deed book
[1:55:40] is back in the hands of man again it was
[1:55:42] cast down and thrown down to the seventh
[1:55:44] church aged messenger who turned around
[1:55:46] and gave it to the church
[1:55:48] what does that mean the title deed book
[1:55:50] is back friends we've got it back in
[1:55:52] everything that adam lost has been
[1:55:54] restored back to us and i won't stop
[1:55:56] crying till we get it all amen i won't
[1:55:58] stop crying to the very nature of god as
[1:56:01] manifest as the one who keeps his
[1:56:02] promises
[1:56:05] we're going to hold on to it we're going
[1:56:07] to pray for we're going to cry out for
[1:56:09] god to fulfill it we're going to remind
[1:56:11] him
[1:56:13] we're going to remind him of sunset
[1:56:16] mountain
[1:56:17] we're going to remind him of march 1963
[1:56:20] the preaching of sales we're going to
[1:56:21] remind him god you did this you promised
[1:56:24] this this is the season this is the hour
[1:56:27] this is the end time and if it's the end
[1:56:29] time which you declared through a
[1:56:30] prophet then it's the time for all end
[1:56:32] time prophecies
[1:56:35] and i'm holding on to them all
[1:56:38] maybe god is looking for a little bride
[1:56:42] who has power with god
[1:56:46] and who will prevail
[1:56:49] not change god's mind not correct god
[1:56:53] but play the other part of redemption
[1:56:56] the part that god plays
[1:56:58] and the part that you and i play
[1:57:02] let's be faithful
[1:57:04] let's recognize who we are
[1:57:07] listen if you don't know who you are do
[1:57:09] you know how to pray
[1:57:11] can you hold on if you don't know who
[1:57:13] you are
[1:57:15] can you grab a hold and never let go if
[1:57:17] you're still in doubt of who you really
[1:57:18] are
[1:57:20] well it's time to wrestle aloud till you
[1:57:22] know who you are
[1:57:24] and when you know who you are you know
[1:57:26] what your rights are in the book
[1:57:28] and when you know what your rights are
[1:57:29] in the book now you know what to hold on
[1:57:31] to and how to hold on you hold on till
[1:57:33] it comes to pass
[1:57:37] it's not
[1:57:39] easy it's not simple it's not for
[1:57:41] everybody
[1:57:43] a lot of people get brushed off
[1:57:47] when they get afflicted
[1:57:49] they let go when their leg is smitten
[1:57:53] they stop when jesus calls them a dog
[1:57:59] they stop when they find rejection with
[1:58:01] family they stop when they have a
[1:58:04] a pastor get go to the world and reject
[1:58:07] the truth they stop they stop they stop
[1:58:09] they stop
[1:58:11] but not everybody will stop
[1:58:15] there's a seed on the earth
[1:58:17] they'll say though he slayed me yet will
[1:58:19] i serve him
[1:58:21] though he afflict me i'll not let go
[1:58:23] though he called me a dog i still have
[1:58:25] no place else to go to get this promise
[1:58:27] fulfilled
[1:58:30] everybody else tells me you're nothing
[1:58:32] it doesn't matter to me what they label
[1:58:34] me all that matters is i'm standing here
[1:58:36] right in this present call me a dog send
[1:58:38] me away tell me it's not for me i'm
[1:58:40] telling you god i got no other place to
[1:58:41] go
[1:58:43] there's nowhere else to go there's no
[1:58:45] other truth out there there's nothing
[1:58:47] else that will deliver this is the only
[1:58:48] thing i got and i don't care what you
[1:58:50] tell me or what doubts pass through my
[1:58:51] mind and how the devil tries to get me
[1:58:53] to believe you're not this and you're
[1:58:55] not that i'm telling you i've got no
[1:58:57] place else to go and i'm staying right
[1:58:58] here
[1:59:00] until everything is fulfilled in my life
[1:59:02] i'm staying right here
[1:59:06] maybe that's the reason for the
[1:59:07] challenges friends
[1:59:09] maybe that's the reason for the
[1:59:11] difficulties maybe that's the reason
[1:59:13] you're limping today
[1:59:17] because you wrestled with the lord
[1:59:19] maybe that's the reason that he tells
[1:59:21] you to shoo you away he doesn't answer
[1:59:23] your prayer instantly and he doesn't
[1:59:25] make everything work out really quick
[1:59:27] maybe he's looking for his counterparts
[1:59:33] the part of him that can endure and see
[1:59:35] the word all the way through to the end
[1:59:38] if god will see the word all the way
[1:59:39] through the end he's going to have a
[1:59:42] people that can see the word through all
[1:59:43] the way to the end
[1:59:46] if you're believing for your loved ones
[1:59:48] believe all the way to the end
[1:59:50] god has given you faith a witness in
[1:59:52] your heart that they're yours hold on to
[1:59:54] it all the way to the end
[1:59:56] if you've got if you believe the promise
[1:59:58] of healing in the bible is yours hold on
[2:00:00] to it all the way to the end
[2:00:02] don't turn it loose don't be afraid to
[2:00:04] remind god hey god i'm still here and
[2:00:06] i'm still believing
[2:00:09] i'm still
[2:00:10] here my morning checkup
[2:00:13] i'm still here and i'm still believing
[2:00:15] that you're god that does not lie and
[2:00:17] your word says and i'm just reminding
[2:00:18] you of what i'm believing
[2:00:22] maybe that's what he's looking for
[2:00:23] rugged christians rugged believers of
[2:00:25] the same stock that they've all been in
[2:00:28] everyone in this bible was a rugged
[2:00:29] believer
[2:00:31] every one of them had opportunities to
[2:00:33] be brushed away and turned aside and
[2:00:35] rejected and criticized and scorned and
[2:00:37] every one of them pushed through all of
[2:00:38] that to stay true to the calling for
[2:00:41] their day to stay true to the word for
[2:00:43] their day
[2:00:45] did we think it was going to be any
[2:00:46] different
[2:00:48] maybe it's designed that way
[2:00:51] so god can identify his elect
[2:00:54] maybe it's designed that way so he can
[2:00:56] shake off all the non-elect
[2:01:01] but there's a couple little bulldogs
[2:01:03] that he can't shake off
[2:01:06] no matter how hard he shakes no matter
[2:01:07] how many disappointments strike the
[2:01:09] church there's a couple that just have
[2:01:11] dug in and they just won't let go
[2:01:14] shake a little harder and inside i can
[2:01:16] imagine you're going that a boy
[2:01:20] get off hold on get off hold on
[2:01:27] do you understand what i'm saying
[2:01:30] the question is what stock are you of
[2:01:32] and i believe i'm in that stock not
[2:01:34] because of my merit or my strength i've
[2:01:35] failed a thousand times ten thousand
[2:01:38] times i've let down been lazy tried to
[2:01:40] take the easy route i've done all of
[2:01:41] that but through it all there's still
[2:01:43] something in me says i gotta have it i
[2:01:44] gotta have it i gotta have it i gotta
[2:01:46] have it
[2:01:47] no matter how many times i let down the
[2:01:49] bar and i slip and i get lazy and i get
[2:01:51] laxed and i forget to pray and no matter
[2:01:53] how many times i do that there's still
[2:01:55] something that raises up and says but
[2:01:57] it's true and it will come to pass and i
[2:01:59] believe it
[2:02:01] that's not me
[2:02:03] that's god who's prevailing through me
[2:02:05] amen the one that brings me back to
[2:02:07] repentance it's not me it's god working
[2:02:10] through me the one that keeps holding on
[2:02:12] to the promise keeps believing the word
[2:02:14] keeps rehearsing the things that are
[2:02:16] true that's not me friends the be me
[2:02:18] would have let go but the god me is
[2:02:20] holding on
[2:02:23] and it's god prevailing
[2:02:25] with god it's god having power with god
[2:02:28] it's god on both ends
[2:02:31] say let us yield to that god part let
[2:02:33] the mind go
[2:02:35] let all comforts of life and all
[2:02:36] laziness go and let's just give in to
[2:02:39] our calling
[2:02:40] and say lord i'm holding on
[2:02:43] for all the promises
[2:02:45] every promise
[2:02:47] in the book
[2:02:49] is mine
[2:02:51] every chapter
[2:02:53] every verse
[2:02:54] every line
[2:02:57] and i'm not satisfied until i taste the
[2:03:00] fruit
[2:03:01] of the whole book
[2:03:04] let's all stand and pray
[2:03:13] sister rachel if you want to go around
[2:03:15] back whoever would like to go with you
[2:03:18] you're welcome
[2:03:20] musicians if you'd like to come for the
[2:03:22] bin
[2:03:23] let's just bow our heads and pray
[2:03:27] oh lord jesus we thank you god
[2:03:30] for what you tell us out of your word we
[2:03:32] thank you god for the picture that you
[2:03:34] paint for the truth that you revealed to
[2:03:37] us
[2:03:39] god you're encouraging us to stay with
[2:03:41] it you're encouraging us not to give up
[2:03:45] because moses didn't give up when he was
[2:03:47] interceding lord
[2:03:49] jacob didn't give up when he was
[2:03:50] wrestling
[2:03:52] paul didn't give up
[2:03:54] until the souls were saved
[2:03:57] i pray god that you'd help us not give
[2:03:58] up
[2:04:00] the the woman that grounded brother
[2:04:02] venom's plane she didn't give up till
[2:04:04] her baby was saved
[2:04:07] god help us not to give up till we see
[2:04:09] the fulfillment of your word
[2:04:11] help us never to find a place to set
[2:04:13] camp
[2:04:14] get comfortable get lazy
[2:04:17] but help us to constantly hold on to
[2:04:19] that promised word
[2:04:21] and wrestle and not let go till we see
[2:04:24] it all the way through to the end
[2:04:27] god we don't have the strength in
[2:04:28] ourselves any more than jacob had in his
[2:04:30] human flesh to stop an angel
[2:04:34] but god there was something else in
[2:04:37] jacob
[2:04:38] that was you
[2:04:40] and because there was something else
[2:04:41] that was you
[2:04:43] he could prevail over the angel the
[2:04:44] angel could not break free because the
[2:04:47] angel could not break free from you
[2:04:51] god there was something in the wisdom of
[2:04:53] moses that wasn't the wisdom of moses
[2:04:56] when he began to intercede and implore
[2:04:58] on behalf of your children
[2:05:00] god it wasn't his intellect it wasn't
[2:05:03] the power of his argument it was you
[2:05:05] lord
[2:05:06] you couldn't resist yourself
[2:05:10] god i pray in this day
[2:05:12] as we yield to the life on the inside of
[2:05:14] us to the reality that who we really are
[2:05:17] lord may it be you inside of us
[2:05:20] not us prevailing over you but you lord
[2:05:23] having power with yourself you
[2:05:25] moving yourself into action
[2:05:29] maybe you on both ends lord
[2:05:32] fill us lord with your spirit direct us
[2:05:35] by your holy ghost keep us holding on
[2:05:37] lord
[2:05:38] let it be your nature your strength your
[2:05:40] power expressing in these humble weak
[2:05:42] vessels
[2:05:44] maybe your faith lord you're overcoming
[2:05:47] that's overcoming through us
[2:05:50] help us to yield to it to surrender to
[2:05:52] it to let it have expression
[2:05:55] god what kind of people were they in the
[2:05:57] bible
[2:05:59] they were a super
[2:06:00] race what kind of people are you calling
[2:06:03] for today
[2:06:04] a super race
[2:06:06] let it be the manifestation
[2:06:09] of the super race in us
[2:06:12] god i pray that you would
[2:06:14] strengthen us equip us
[2:06:16] let us make our choice
[2:06:19] help us lord to make our decision and
[2:06:20] stick with it
[2:06:22] that we might be the overcomers in this
[2:06:24] day
[2:06:25] we love you for your word we ask god
[2:06:27] that you would bring every bit of it
[2:06:29] into manifestation
[2:06:31] for you promised it
[2:06:33] you're not a liar but you tell the truth
[2:06:36] and we're expecting we're believing
[2:06:38] we're watching
[2:06:40] until we see every bit of it made
[2:06:42] manifest and come to fullness
[2:06:45] god bless your people those that are
[2:06:47] praying for loved ones
[2:06:48] may they hold on and see the salvation
[2:06:50] of their loved ones
[2:06:53] those that are holding on for healing
[2:06:55] may they be more determined than ever to
[2:06:57] hold on may they be encouraged in the
[2:06:59] inward man to hold on until they see the
[2:07:01] manifestation of their healing
[2:07:04] those that need deliverance i pray that
