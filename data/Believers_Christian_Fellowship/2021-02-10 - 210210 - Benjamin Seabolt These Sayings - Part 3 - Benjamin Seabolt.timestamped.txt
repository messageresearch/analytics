[6:23] we're so grateful number one to have a

[6:26] that can be filled and then no
[6:30] he which can fill it if you would just
[6:34] take your bibles we'll go
[6:35] straight into the word this evening
[6:40] go to john chapter 10.
[6:51] beginning in verse 24. we'll just read
[6:54] this
[6:55] portion of scripture very familiar i
[6:57] just want to continue with
[6:59] this topic of these sayings
[7:04] that jesus declared
[7:08] john chapter 10 verse 24 says then came
[7:11] the jews
[7:12] round about him and said unto him how
[7:15] long dost thou make us to doubt
[7:18] if thou be the christ tell us plainly
[7:22] jesus answered them i told you and ye
[7:24] believe
[7:25] not the works that i do in my father's
[7:27] name
[7:28] they bear witness of me but ye believe
[7:31] not
[7:32] because ye are not of my sheep as i said
[7:35] unto you
[7:37] my sheep hear my voice and i know them
[7:40] and they follow me
[7:41] and i give unto them eternal life and
[7:43] they shall never perish
[7:45] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[7:47] my hand
[7:48] my father which gave them me is greater
[7:51] than all
[7:52] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[7:54] my father's hand
[7:55] i and my father are one
[7:59] then the jews took up stones again to
[8:02] stone him
[8:03] let's just pray together
[8:06] precious lord jesus we just want to
[8:10] thank you once again for this
[8:11] opportunity that you've given
[8:13] to us lord to gather together with your
[8:16] children father
[8:18] lord to gather again
[8:22] lord around you the revealed truth for
[8:24] our age
[8:26] lord not around a man's idea or
[8:29] just a good thought or some philosophy
[8:32] lord but to
[8:33] gather around a person
[8:36] god himself and i pray that you would
[8:39] just come
[8:40] this evening lord that you would do that
[8:43] which
[8:43] no man can do and that you would take
[8:45] the book
[8:46] you would loose the seals and that you
[8:48] would just speak to us
[8:50] and accomplish that which your divine
[8:52] purpose
[8:53] has purpose before the foundation of the
[8:55] world for this service
[8:57] we just submit ourselves to you both
[8:59] speaker and here
[9:00] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[9:02] the bride says
[9:04] amen god bless you as you would have
[9:06] your seats i want to go ahead and read
[9:08] this quote again that we've
[9:09] based this topic off of very familiar
[9:13] but in 1965 the sea does not air with
[9:15] the shuck
[9:17] brother random said luther had
[9:19] justification wesley had
[9:21] sanctification the pentecostals had the
[9:24] restoration of the gifts
[9:26] but when the word came
[9:30] now they could produce that
[9:32] justification will save a man speaking
[9:34] of luther
[9:34] sure it was a carrier of the word just
[9:37] the same as i believe the stalk is part
[9:39] of the wheat
[9:40] sure it is but it's a carrier it ain't
[9:43] the life
[9:44] then along comes sanctification how many
[9:47] believes in sanctification
[9:49] you believe the bible you have to so
[9:52] still that's not it but then came the
[9:55] pentecost the restoration of the gifts
[9:58] speaking in tongues there they called
[10:00] that the initial evidence
[10:01] which brought forth what the shock
[10:05] but they denominated but when you come
[10:09] to say
[10:10] i and my father are one and these other
[10:13] things
[10:14] then the shuck pulls away from it but
[10:16] the real genuine
[10:18] bride church will bring forth the entire
[10:20] word of god
[10:21] in its fullness and in its strength for
[10:23] he's the same
[10:24] yesterday today and forever
[10:28] so it's very obvious here this is what
[10:31] we're drawing our context from
[10:33] when he says that when you begin to say
[10:37] i and the father are one and these other
[10:40] things
[10:42] implying similarity
[10:45] you begin to say that the shock pulls
[10:49] away from it
[10:51] and i just want to to look at this
[10:55] before we would move forward as brother
[10:58] branham is breaking this down
[11:00] he says the lutheran produced
[11:03] justification
[11:04] wesley produced sanctification the
[11:07] pentecost
[11:09] produced the restoration of the gifts
[11:13] but when you come to say i and my father
[11:16] are one
[11:17] and these other things the shock pulls
[11:20] away from it
[11:22] well he just identified the pentecostal
[11:25] revival
[11:26] at the restoration of the gifts as the
[11:29] shock
[11:30] that would pull away from that
[11:33] so by default
[11:37] if you're not preaching i and my father
[11:40] are
[11:40] one and these other things call yourself
[11:44] what you want
[11:45] you're shuck
[11:50] that's per the prophet that's not me
[11:51] that's per the prophet
[11:54] and he note if you'll notice at the
[11:56] beginning
[11:59] of this statement he says luther had
[12:01] justification
[12:02] wesley had sanctification pentecostals
[12:04] had the restoration of the gifts
[12:06] but when the word came
[12:11] so he's he's laying another dispensation
[12:14] in there
[12:15] he's laying another age in there he's
[12:18] laying another turning of the corner in
[12:20] there
[12:21] and he's saying that that when the word
[12:25] come remember if you if you'll look at
[12:27] the beginning of that paragraph and then
[12:29] at the end of it
[12:30] he's putting those two together when the
[12:32] word
[12:33] comes it will declare i and my father
[12:35] are one and these other things
[12:38] and anything short of that is shock and
[12:41] as i've said before we
[12:42] we don't want to discount the shuck
[12:44] because without no shuck there's no seed
[12:47] so we we don't want to point fingers as
[12:50] this is shock and this is shuck and i'm
[12:52] better than that because i'm not shocked
[12:53] and so forth if there's no shock there's
[12:56] no seed and as i said before brother
[12:57] branham himself said
[12:59] leave that shuck alone it was a good
[13:02] shock but what i don't want to do is get
[13:05] confused and identify
[13:06] and try to identify something as seed
[13:09] that's not seed when it's really shock
[13:11] and we don't have to use our definitions
[13:13] for that or even our mind for that
[13:14] because the prophet has given us a clear
[13:16] definition
[13:17] that anything that's not preaching i and
[13:20] my father are one and these other things
[13:23] the shock pulls away from that
[13:27] don't get hung up on when i say
[13:29] preaching these other things is then it
[13:31] has to be a man behind a pulpit
[13:32] preaching these other things
[13:34] remember our lives preach the gospel
[13:37] that's what we're concerned about so we
[13:39] can call ourselves bride all we want we
[13:41] can call ourself message all we want but
[13:43] if we are not
[13:44] living epistles preaching i and my
[13:46] father are one and these other things
[13:50] we're still in a shuck face and that's
[13:53] what we want to get away from
[13:56] i'm going to do a really quick review
[13:58] for maybe somebody that wasn't here for
[14:00] the other services uh
[14:02] again this will be really quick but i
[14:03] want to lay this basis back in here so
[14:06] that you
[14:06] so that everybody understands where
[14:09] we're coming from
[14:11] we learned that one of these other
[14:15] things
[14:16] was to be about the father's business
[14:19] and we learned that the definition of
[14:21] the father's business was to destroy
[14:23] denominational thinking
[14:24] by explaining the scriptures with their
[14:27] true spiritual meaning
[14:29] and to fulfill the scriptures that are
[14:31] written
[14:32] of yourself we learned that the bride
[14:36] has power to remit sin of unbelief by
[14:38] presenting the living word for the day
[14:40] the same as jesus and any other true
[14:42] believer
[14:43] through the ages did we learn that all
[14:46] hell is against the revelation of christ
[14:49] to the individual
[14:53] the spirit of truth says jesus christ is
[14:56] come in the flesh
[14:58] which is the true bride doctrine that
[15:01] this spiritual bride
[15:02] is the word made flesh flesh and blood
[15:05] again
[15:06] jesus christ misses jesus christ come in
[15:09] the flesh
[15:13] you can take that with a superficial
[15:15] understanding
[15:16] and say okay i believe that anything
[15:19] that says jesus christ is come in the
[15:20] flesh
[15:21] is of god but look at the implications
[15:28] because if the spirit of truth says
[15:30] jesus christ
[15:31] is coming the flesh what does the spirit
[15:35] of
[15:35] falseness say i don't know if that's a
[15:37] word but
[15:39] i'm going to say it anyhow what does the
[15:40] spirit of falseness say
[15:43] what does the spirit of untruth say
[15:49] it's not going to come and say no jesus
[15:52] christ
[15:52] is not come in the flesh what it's going
[15:55] to do is it's going to say
[15:56] jesus christ was come in the flesh or
[16:00] jesus christ is coming in the flesh
[16:03] because this the antichrist spirit in
[16:05] the last days would be so close to
[16:07] deceive the very elect
[16:09] it's not going to if it was possible but
[16:12] it's
[16:12] not going to deceive the very elect if
[16:14] it was possible
[16:15] with just an utter declaration that no
[16:18] that's impossible jesus christ is not
[16:20] come in the flesh
[16:25] but it will say jesus christ was come in
[16:26] the flesh
[16:28] it will say he is coming in the flesh
[16:32] and they may even say that with the
[16:33] superficial understanding of he yes he's
[16:35] in he is
[16:36] in the flesh but then they won't admit
[16:39] what flesh he's in
[16:41] that's the revelation that all hell is
[16:43] against because
[16:44] that's the revelation that the spirit of
[16:46] truth brings
[16:48] anything other than that is antichrist
[16:53] when the spirit of truth comes
[16:56] one of the statements that he will make
[16:58] is wilt thou be made whole
[17:01] as we went over the situation with the
[17:03] lame man laying there beside the pool
[17:05] for 37 38 years whichever it was
[17:08] he did not the spirit of truth does not
[17:10] come and ask you if you will be reformed
[17:14] the spirit of truth comes and asks you
[17:16] will thou be made whole
[17:17] he is not into reformation anymore
[17:20] saints
[17:22] he's definitely not into
[17:24] self-reformation
[17:27] but he will come in this age
[17:31] and he will say i and my father are one
[17:33] and these other things
[17:35] and he will pose that question to you
[17:37] will thou
[17:38] be made whole not just reformed
[17:43] we learned that the son does nothing but
[17:46] what the father shows him
[17:50] we learn that whosoever would hear the
[17:52] words of the son and believed on him
[17:54] that sent him hath passed from death and
[17:57] to life
[18:00] we learned one of those other things was
[18:02] you could make a declaration to search
[18:04] the scriptures
[18:05] for they are they that testified me
[18:12] i am come in my father's name
[18:18] the work of god is to believe on him
[18:21] whom he hath sent
[18:26] and probably the most important thing
[18:28] that we learned is that antichrist
[18:29] denominational spirit
[18:32] is within our own framework of our soul
[18:35] our spirit and our body
[18:37] that's probably the most important thing
[18:40] it's not in the church down the road
[18:42] it's not in the church across the
[18:43] country it's not in the church across
[18:44] the world
[18:45] the antichrist spirit within the
[18:47] framework of the christian
[18:49] church walks around on our own two feet
[18:52] each and every day
[18:53] and we have to be able to discern that
[18:56] that hybrid spirit that intellectual
[18:58] spirit
[18:59] that would give a superficial
[19:00] understanding of the word and not a true
[19:03] revelation of the word
[19:05] that would declare anything but
[19:08] i am jesus christ come in the flesh
[19:12] and we have to discern that and we have
[19:14] to withstand that
[19:16] most importantly and again i just want
[19:18] to say that as we would move forward
[19:20] through this
[19:21] this is not these are not uh necessarily
[19:24] anything
[19:24] new that we're going to be preaching our
[19:26] pastor has been preaching this
[19:28] uh he's been preaching it good he's been
[19:30] preaching it thoroughly we've uh
[19:33] definitely enjoyed that um so like i
[19:36] said this is kind of just
[19:38] me coming behind all of that and saying
[19:40] this
[19:41] is that this that we have been hearing
[19:45] is these other things and like i said
[19:48] i'm the slow farmer who takes a long
[19:50] time to do that and
[19:51] lays a really wide foundation and so on
[19:53] and so forth but that's just me
[19:56] but we can relax and and these things
[19:59] are not just
[20:00] new to us these have been preached
[20:03] and they've been preached in depth but
[20:06] we want to give
[20:07] proper placement to these and truly
[20:10] recognize
[20:12] what is what exactly is happening
[20:16] because when because brother branham
[20:17] says when you come to say these things
[20:20] the shucks going to pull away
[20:24] when you come to say these things the
[20:26] shucks going to pull away
[20:28] so if we've already been saying these
[20:30] these things
[20:32] even if we haven't realized we've been
[20:34] saying these things it still doesn't
[20:35] change the process that the shuck is
[20:37] going to pull away
[20:39] so it gives us a proper understanding of
[20:41] what's going on in our lives
[20:42] and again we have to keep our
[20:46] focus where it is appropriate
[20:49] and the shock pulling away is nowhere
[20:52] else but
[20:53] right here right here with us
[20:56] if we put it anywhere else we're going
[20:58] to miss it saints
[21:00] as we gave the example it gave no
[21:03] it gave no benefit to peter and john
[21:06] to know judas was shocked it gave
[21:09] no benefit to them because when the
[21:12] squeeze came
[21:12] and the pressure came they deserted just
[21:15] like everybody else
[21:16] did but what changed that
[21:19] was when they got a proper revelation of
[21:21] the shock within themselves
[21:24] and then were able to withstand that
[21:27] that's what made the difference so we
[21:29] want to
[21:30] focus on what's worth focusing on
[21:34] so with that being said we're going to
[21:35] pick up where we left off in john
[21:37] chapter
[21:37] 6 and
[21:41] verse 31 this is after
[21:44] they chased him across the sea they came
[21:46] to him
[21:48] and was asking him how he got over to
[21:50] the other side without them
[21:52] knowing he got to the other side and he
[21:55] just confronted them and said look
[21:56] you're here for the fishes and the
[21:58] loaves
[21:59] i know i get it so he discerned their
[22:02] spirit
[22:03] told them what they was after but then
[22:04] he continues
[22:06] uh we continue with that story here in
[22:08] verse 31.
[22:11] jesus spoke to them they replied back
[22:16] our fathers did eat manna in the desert
[22:19] as it is written he gave them bread from
[22:21] heaven to eat
[22:23] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[22:25] i say unto you
[22:26] moses gave you not that bread from
[22:28] heaven
[22:30] but my father giveth you the true bread
[22:33] from heaven
[22:36] now this wouldn't mean too much if this
[22:39] was all that he said
[22:40] but if you'll go back to verse 27
[22:48] let's go back to 627
[22:52] he says labor not for the meat which
[22:55] peri
[22:56] perisheth but for that meat which
[22:58] endureth unto everlasting life
[23:01] which the son of man shall give unto you
[23:07] so he just told them just previous the
[23:09] son of man
[23:10] is going to give you the meat that you
[23:12] need but now he says
[23:14] my father will give you that meat he
[23:17] will give you that bread
[23:20] there was probably somebody in the crowd
[23:22] that caught that
[23:23] and began to have a question what
[23:25] exactly is he trying to say
[23:27] and who is he trying to make himself
[23:29] because here he's saying my father is
[23:31] going to do it but yet here he's saying
[23:33] i'm going to do it
[23:36] a little bit of confusion there
[23:40] 33 says for the bread of god is
[23:45] he which cometh down from heaven and
[23:48] giveth life unto the world so now he
[23:51] said my father's going to give this to
[23:53] you i'm going to give this to you but
[23:55] actually it's he that's come down from
[23:58] heaven
[24:01] see how you can take a shallow
[24:02] superficial understanding of something
[24:04] that's being said and just
[24:06] clearly miss it they were just telling
[24:10] him
[24:11] tell us if thou be the christ quit
[24:13] making us doubt
[24:15] tell us plainly and he's like
[24:18] i told you my father was going to give
[24:19] you the bread i told you i was going to
[24:21] give you the bread now i've told you
[24:22] that i'm here giving you the bread
[24:24] i've told you and you won't believe me
[24:28] what do you want me to do and then they
[24:31] get mad
[24:32] at him and want to stone him he just did
[24:34] what they asked him to do
[24:35] he told them plainly and they want to
[24:37] kill him
[24:40] the bread of god is he which cometh down
[24:44] from heaven and giveth life unto the
[24:47] world
[24:48] then said they unto him lord evermore
[24:52] give us this bread and jesus said unto
[24:55] them
[24:57] i am the bread of life
[25:02] this is one of the other things that we
[25:05] have to declare
[25:07] not just him i
[25:10] am the bread of life
[25:16] he that cometh to me
[25:19] shall never hunger and he that believeth
[25:23] on me
[25:24] shall never thirst
[25:28] it's easy to vocalize that but as our
[25:31] life declaring that
[25:33] is our life declaring i am the bread of
[25:37] life
[25:39] and if you're seeking life and if you're
[25:41] hungry for life
[25:42] you can come to me and you can be filled
[25:45] if you're
[25:45] thirsty you can come to me and you can
[25:48] have drink
[25:51] when you begin to say i and the father
[25:55] are one
[25:56] and these other things the shuck will
[25:59] pull away
[26:03] try waking up tomorrow morning looking
[26:05] yourself in the mirror and saying
[26:06] i am the bread of life
[26:10] and see what your hybrid spirit does
[26:14] see how badly it recoils
[26:17] see how hard it starts laughing
[26:23] but remember the hybrid spirit is from
[26:26] the father of lies
[26:28] and he does nothing but tell lies he
[26:31] can't recognize the truth because he has
[26:33] no capacity to recognize the truth
[26:36] so just because two-thirds of you will
[26:38] laugh hysterically
[26:40] and recoil when you say that doesn't
[26:42] change the fact that you're a
[26:43] carrier of the bread of life therefore
[26:46] making
[26:47] you the bread of life therefore enabling
[26:50] you to give to somebody who's hungry
[26:52] and in need when you begin to say these
[26:56] things
[26:57] the shuck will pull away we're going to
[27:00] go back to
[27:00] or skip forward to john 7 because this
[27:03] ties
[27:04] right in with this john 7 37
[27:07] in the last days the great day of the
[27:08] feast
[27:10] jesus stood and cried saying if any man
[27:13] thirst so he's he's told them if you're
[27:16] hungry you can come to me
[27:18] if you're seeking the bread of life you
[27:20] can come from me but now
[27:21] you can come to me but now here he
[27:23] stands up on the last day of the feast
[27:25] and he says if any man thirst let him
[27:28] come unto me and drink
[27:30] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[27:32] hath said out of his belly shuffle
[27:35] rivers of living water well you say
[27:37] that's fine if you're thirsty go to
[27:39] jesus go to jesus he'll give you drink
[27:41] he'll give you bread
[27:42] he'll give you everything that you need
[27:45] where are they going to go saints
[27:48] where are they going to go
[27:52] they have to come to a dispenser of
[27:54] water
[27:55] they have to come with a dis to a
[27:57] dispenser of bread
[27:59] they have to come to the spirit of truth
[28:04] there is no other spirit of truth there
[28:07] is no other heavenly manner
[28:09] there is no heavenly water outside of
[28:11] the message for this hour
[28:15] is jesus going to come down a 40-foot
[28:17] jesus on a cloud
[28:19] and start passing out message books is
[28:22] he going to give them tapes
[28:24] how is that going to transpire saints
[28:28] it's going to be a living life
[28:32] living bread living water a dispenser of
[28:36] eternal life
[28:37] walking around in hybrid flesh
[28:41] that is the manner that he has chose to
[28:43] come in
[28:44] we cannot bypass that manner
[28:48] as paradoxical as that may be
[28:52] it's not going to change and we have to
[28:55] become comfortable with that
[28:57] we cannot point people anywhere else
[29:01] there's nowhere to point them and if
[29:04] you're in a position in your life that
[29:05] you
[29:05] can't point them to yourself you need to
[29:08] change i need to change
[29:10] because we have to declare this we have
[29:14] to declare this in order to get the
[29:15] shock to pull away
[29:17] we have to declare this with our life
[29:23] verse 39 he says but this he spake of
[29:25] the spirit
[29:27] which they that believe on him should
[29:29] receive for the holy ghost was not yet
[29:31] given because
[29:32] that jesus was not yet glorified many of
[29:35] the people therefore when they heard
[29:36] this saying
[29:37] said of a truth this is the prophet
[29:41] others said this is the christ but some
[29:44] said shall christ come out of galilee
[29:46] hath not the scripture said that christ
[29:49] cometh out of this
[29:50] of the seed of david and out of the town
[29:53] of bethlehem
[29:54] where david was
[30:00] so they had a problem with historical
[30:02] facts
[30:05] that spirit's not dead they couldn't
[30:08] find his birth certificate
[30:12] so that's going to change who he is and
[30:13] what he's doing
[30:16] that spirit's not dead how foolish hath
[30:22] not the scripture said
[30:24] that christ cometh of the seed of david
[30:26] and out of the town of bethlehem where
[30:28] david was
[30:29] yes it did say that and that's where he
[30:31] came from
[30:32] but they couldn't prove it they didn't
[30:34] know it
[30:40] you follow me saints that has
[30:43] no bearing on the fact just because they
[30:45] can't prove it
[30:47] just because they don't have the
[30:48] documentation that would satisfy
[30:50] satisfy them that does not change the
[30:52] fact that he fulfilled the scriptures
[30:53] and he
[30:54] he was who he said he was and he was
[30:56] doing what was prophesied of him to do
[31:00] so there was a division among the people
[31:02] because of him
[31:04] and some of them would have taken him
[31:06] but no man laid hands on him
[31:09] then came the officers to the chief
[31:11] priests and pharisees and they said unto
[31:13] him
[31:13] why have ye not brought him
[31:17] the officers answered never a man spake
[31:20] like this man
[31:23] then answered they the pharisees
[31:27] are ye also deceived
[31:32] are you caught in this cult too
[31:35] are you worshiping that man too
[31:44] next question have any of the rulers or
[31:47] of the pharisees believed on him
[31:51] have we had a council on this yet
[31:55] does does the majority approve of this
[31:58] teaching
[32:00] is the mainstream christian ranks okay
[32:02] with this
[32:05] that spirit's not dead but when you come
[32:09] to say i and the father are one and
[32:11] these other things that spirit will pull
[32:12] away
[32:14] [Music]
[32:15] john 8 12 then spake jesus again unto
[32:19] them saying
[32:20] i am the light of the world
[32:24] he that followeth me shall not walk in
[32:26] darkness
[32:27] but shall have the light of life the
[32:29] pharisees therefore said unto him
[32:31] thou bearest record of thyself thy
[32:35] record is not true this is so comical
[32:38] because here they are in chapter
[32:40] whatever chapter i was just
[32:42] in demanding him
[32:45] tell us plainly who you are
[32:48] and he says okay i'm the bread of life
[32:50] i'm the water
[32:52] i'm the light you bear record of
[32:55] yourself
[32:57] you're wrong
[33:01] he can't do anything to please them
[33:02] saints they demand him to do something
[33:05] and he does it and they want to kill him
[33:08] he's already told them they demand for
[33:11] them
[33:12] for him to tell them again plainly and
[33:14] he does
[33:15] and they want to kill him
[33:18] how do you win that how how do you win
[33:22] that i have no idea i have no idea
[33:25] but jesus never backed up on this they
[33:28] said tell us he said i'm the bread
[33:30] they said tell us he said i'm the water
[33:32] he said tell us i'm the light
[33:35] i and my father are one my father gives
[33:38] you the bread i give you the bread
[33:43] plainly as explicit as he can
[33:49] and they can't receive it and want to
[33:51] kill him
[33:55] jesus answered and said unto them though
[33:57] i bear record of myself
[34:00] yet my record is true for i know once i
[34:03] came and whether i go
[34:05] but ye cannot tell once i come and
[34:07] whether i go
[34:08] there's the answer to the problem
[34:13] they didn't know who their father was
[34:17] he did they didn't know where they come
[34:20] from
[34:21] he did i am one that bear witness of
[34:25] myself
[34:25] and the father that sent me beareth
[34:28] witness of me
[34:30] then said now remember this is not just
[34:32] jesus speaking these are things that we
[34:33] have to declare
[34:35] so don't get lost don't get lost in the
[34:37] reading
[34:39] anything you see there in your bible
[34:40] that's read that's one of these other
[34:43] things
[34:44] sorry i wasn't supposed to tell you that
[34:45] to the end i just gave myself away
[34:48] that's one of the other things that we
[34:50] have to say that we have to declare
[34:53] don't leave this 2000 years ago
[34:57] i am one that bear witness of myself
[35:00] and the father that sent me beareth
[35:02] witness of me
[35:06] can we declare that saints
[35:09] can we declare that
[35:12] then said they unto him where is thy
[35:15] father
[35:16] and jesus answered ye neither know me
[35:19] nor my father if ye had known
[35:23] me ye should have known my father also
[35:28] and he said unto them ye are from
[35:31] beneath
[35:32] i am from above ye are of this
[35:36] world i am not of this world
[35:39] i said therefore unto you that ye shall
[35:42] die
[35:43] in your sins for if
[35:46] ye believe not that i am she i mean
[35:49] i am he
[35:53] ye shall die in your sins
[35:58] jesus never backed up one iota
[36:04] never took a half a step back never even
[36:06] stumbled
[36:07] never even stuttered i am the bread
[36:10] i am the water i am the light i am the
[36:13] way
[36:14] i am the truth i am from above you're
[36:16] from beneath
[36:17] unless you believe this you will die in
[36:19] your sins
[36:25] but yet he was still the humblest man
[36:27] that ever walked the face of the earth
[36:31] knowing all things had been given to him
[36:35] he girded himself and washed his
[36:36] disciples feet
[36:38] see this revelation is never one that
[36:40] will puff you up
[36:41] but this revelation is one that you will
[36:43] never back away from either
[36:45] you can declare these same saints and
[36:48] you can do it with the right spirit the
[36:50] right attitude and the right humility
[36:53] and it will be one hundred percent truth
[36:56] but you can declare these things with
[36:57] the wrong attitude with the wrong spirit
[37:00] and be one hundred percent wrong
[37:03] we have to say the right thing with the
[37:05] right spirit
[37:07] but just because it raises us enough
[37:10] raises an offense
[37:11] does not mean it's wrong and does not
[37:13] mean that we should not declare it
[37:16] jesus never backed up in fact i would
[37:19] say that he laid it on thicker
[37:22] he had a chance when he declared that i
[37:24] am the bread that come down from heaven
[37:25] and they've resisted that
[37:26] he had a chance to back up and just say
[37:29] okay well i won't say anything else
[37:31] but he didn't he didn't
[37:34] because out of that crowd there might
[37:36] have been one
[37:37] who needed to know you know what
[37:41] he said he was the bread that came down
[37:43] from heaven but yet he said that the
[37:44] father would provide that
[37:46] and then he said he's here doing it now
[37:48] see there was there may have been just
[37:50] one to catch it and it was to him
[37:54] it was worth the offense to the rest
[38:02] to be like jesus
[38:05] just to be like jesus
[38:09] on earth i long to be like him
[38:15] it's more than a song
[38:21] that was in chapter 8 jesus comes to
[38:24] chapter 9
[38:25] and just in case that wasn't enough he
[38:28] says as long
[38:29] as i am in the world
[38:32] i am the light of the world
[38:36] when the bride goes up where's the mercy
[38:39] at
[38:42] gone brother branham says when she goes
[38:45] up there is no
[38:46] more mercy
[38:52] so long as i am in this world
[38:55] there is mercy on the place on the
[38:57] planet earth
[38:59] you say well that's pretty bold
[39:03] can you say it why can't you say it
[39:08] if your life is not in compromise to
[39:10] this revealed word you can say that
[39:12] and you don't even have to blush and
[39:15] it's true
[39:16] you say well i'm bearing record of
[39:18] myself
[39:20] to be like jesus
[39:23] just to be like jesus jesus publicly
[39:26] declared okay
[39:27] i am bearing record of myself but it's
[39:29] true
[39:30] search the scriptures they are they that
[39:32] testify of me
[39:37] he did not back up on the word because
[39:40] of the effects on the unbeliever
[39:44] we cannot back up on the word because of
[39:47] the effects it has on our hybrid spirit
[39:49] in our hybrid flesh
[39:51] we have to declare it and that
[39:55] will bring it under subjection
[39:59] so we're going to go back now to john 6
[40:03] verse 36.
[40:07] jesus said but i say unto you he's
[40:09] speaking to that same group
[40:11] that he just told that he was the bread
[40:12] that came down from heaven
[40:15] he says but i said unto you that ye
[40:18] also have seen me and believe not
[40:22] all that the father giveth me shall come
[40:25] to me
[40:26] and him that cometh to me i will in no
[40:29] wise
[40:30] cast out
[40:34] for i came down from heaven not to do my
[40:37] own will
[40:39] but the will of him that sent me
[40:43] let me ask you this why did you come
[40:45] down from heaven
[40:50] to work a job
[40:53] to have some hobbies to buy a new house
[40:57] buy a new car
[40:58] to get a promotion
[41:03] to raise children
[41:08] why did you come down from heaven
[41:12] please don't tell me you've never been
[41:14] in heaven because i got something i'm
[41:15] getting to here in a second it'll be
[41:16] really bad if you say that why did you
[41:20] come down from heaven
[41:24] for i came down from heaven
[41:28] not to do my own will but the will of
[41:32] him that
[41:33] sent me this
[41:36] one verse with a proper revelation
[41:40] will cause sanctification and worldly
[41:42] entertainment and worldly living to
[41:44] never have to be preached again
[41:51] i have come down from heaven to do
[41:54] that which my father has sent me to do
[41:59] i have come down from heaven not to do
[42:01] my will
[42:03] but to do the will of him that sent me
[42:09] that's a really hard statement to apply
[42:12] to any kind of worldly entertainment or
[42:15] worldly living
[42:18] in fact i would almost say it's
[42:20] impossible
[42:23] see i don't need a whole list of things
[42:26] to go down you should not do this you
[42:27] should not do this shame on you if
[42:29] you're on this shame on you if you're
[42:30] involved in that
[42:32] i don't need that list anymore all that
[42:34] i need is this
[42:36] for you have come down from heaven
[42:40] to do your not your own will
[42:44] but the will of him that has sent you
[42:47] get a revelation of that
[42:50] your vices your habits your bad habits i
[42:54] would say
[42:55] will go by the wayside saints because it
[42:58] is
[42:58] the word that sanctifieth this
[43:01] is the word that has come to heal our
[43:03] diseases
[43:04] this is the word that has come to heal
[43:06] our vices this
[43:08] is the word that has come to draw us out
[43:10] of the world
[43:12] you say well i can't say that yet okay
[43:16] okay the first step to fixing the
[43:19] problem is recognizing there's a problem
[43:21] let him fix the problem pray that he
[43:25] would give you this revelation
[43:28] that i have come down
[43:31] from heaven not to do my own will
[43:35] but to do the will of him that has sent
[43:38] me
[43:45] there is so many things that that will
[43:49] alleviate with a proper revelation
[43:53] that i don't have time to make a list
[43:54] for it
[43:57] but when you catch the first part of
[43:59] that
[44:00] that i am come down from heaven that
[44:03] should do something for you to take
[44:04] worldly entertainment away
[44:07] brother brandon says christians are
[44:08] entertained by the holy ghost
[44:12] i can be entertained on that for a
[44:14] little while
[44:15] in fact i might get a little carried
[44:17] away when i start getting entertained on
[44:20] that i
[44:22] am come down from heaven not to do my
[44:25] own will
[44:27] but the will of him that sent me
[44:31] let's just make it as simple as simple
[44:33] to as can be
[44:35] when you roll out of bed tomorrow and
[44:36] your feet hit the floor and you go
[44:38] do whatever you're getting ready to do
[44:41] can you take the father with you
[44:44] is that the father's business
[44:50] it's that simple saints the scripture
[44:51] says everything that we do
[44:54] we have to do in the name of the lord
[44:56] jesus christ
[44:58] everything our hobbies our habits
[45:01] our behavior
[45:06] everything you say well i can't do that
[45:10] you can do that because that's the
[45:12] position the word puts us
[45:14] in and if the word puts us in that
[45:16] position it has to make a way for that
[45:18] to happen
[45:19] he has to bring the spirit of truth for
[45:22] the truth
[45:23] he has to bring a spirit to manifest the
[45:26] truth
[45:26] he has to bring the spirit to put that
[45:28] into action
[45:30] it is possible don't put it out of reach
[45:35] we have to declare these things because
[45:38] this is one of the other things we have
[45:39] to declare
[45:40] to make the shuck pull away
[45:43] and this is the father's will which hath
[45:45] sent me
[45:46] that of all which he hath given me i
[45:48] should lose nothing
[45:50] but should raise it up again at the last
[45:52] day and this is the will of him that
[45:54] sent me that everyone that seeth the son
[45:56] and believeth on him
[45:57] may have everlasting life and i will
[46:00] raise him up at the last day
[46:01] that's pretty bold you're going to raise
[46:03] him up at the last day
[46:08] then the jews murmured against him
[46:10] because he had said
[46:12] i am the bread which came down from
[46:14] heaven they still haven't got over that
[46:15] and he's already said like four other
[46:17] things that's just totally blowing them
[46:18] out of the water they're still mad that
[46:19] he said he was the bread
[46:26] then jews the then the jews murmured at
[46:29] him because he said
[46:30] i am the bread which came down from
[46:32] heaven
[46:34] and they said the exact same thing that
[46:38] your hybrid spirit says to you
[46:41] is this not jesus the son of joseph
[46:45] whose father and mother i know
[46:54] how is it then that he saith
[46:57] he is the bride of jesus christ how
[47:00] is it that he saith he is the dispenser
[47:03] of eternal life
[47:05] is this not sister karen that i know
[47:10] i know her mother i know her father i
[47:13] know her
[47:14] and she's declaring that
[47:18] is this not sister elsie that i know
[47:21] is this not brother mike that i know
[47:23] bring it home saints
[47:26] is that not what he tells you every time
[47:27] you look in the mirror
[47:30] that's benjamin that i know i know his
[47:34] daddy
[47:34] i know his mommy don't try to say that
[47:38] to me you're bearing record of yourself
[47:42] because i know you i've got the birth
[47:45] certificate
[47:48] you're right i am bearing record of
[47:50] myself
[47:52] but my record is true
[47:56] because he that has sent me bears record
[47:58] of me
[47:59] and you're the father of lies you're the
[48:02] author of lies you can do nothing but
[48:04] lie
[48:04] because you're hybrid and that's what
[48:06] hybrids do is they tell lies
[48:11] in spite of everything
[48:14] we must declare that revelation
[48:17] even when the response from two-thirds
[48:20] of us
[48:21] is this is this
[48:24] not put your name in there
[48:28] the son of joseph whose father and
[48:30] mother we know
[48:32] is this not the same guy
[48:36] that blew up three days ago that i know
[48:40] is this not the same mommy who lost her
[48:42] temper four days ago
[48:44] that i know she's the dispenser of
[48:48] eternal life
[48:50] she's the water she's the bread she's
[48:52] the light she's the truth she's the way
[48:54] and if i don't believe that i'm going to
[48:56] die in my sins
[49:04] once the word is spoken it's true
[49:08] conduct does not change that
[49:12] once he has chosen
[49:15] nothing will change that
[49:21] jesus therefore answered and said unto
[49:23] them
[49:24] i'll stop talking now seeing that you
[49:26] all have a problem you all just relax
[49:28] go to church sunday wednesday pay your
[49:30] tithes
[49:32] pray every once in a while it's okay
[49:36] everybody just chill out
[49:40] jesus said unto them murmur not among
[49:43] yourselves
[49:44] no man can come to me except the father
[49:46] father with
[49:47] which hath sent me draw him and
[49:51] i will raise him up in the last day
[49:54] it is written in the prophets and they
[49:58] shall all be taught of god
[50:01] every man therefore that hath heard and
[50:05] hath learned of the father cometh unto
[50:07] me not that any man hath seen the father
[50:10] save he which is of god
[50:14] he hath seen the father
[50:21] no man can come to me except the father
[50:27] which hath sent me draw him
[50:31] and i will raise him up in the last days
[50:35] it is written in the prophets and they
[50:38] shall be all taught of god
[50:42] every man therefore that
[50:46] hath heard and
[50:49] hath learned of the father
[50:53] cometh unto me
[50:58] this is the part where i told you all
[50:59] that i've shared this with before you
[51:01] have to act like you never heard it
[51:02] before
[51:05] not that any man hath seen the father
[51:08] save he everybody say save he
[51:12] save he which is of god
[51:16] he hath seen the father
[51:23] it is written in the prophets they shall
[51:25] be all taught of god
[51:27] every man therefore that hath heard and
[51:29] hath learned of the father cometh to me
[51:34] see saints it can't deceive the very
[51:37] elect
[51:38] because she's already been taught before
[51:42] you say well i don't remember that
[51:44] neither do i
[51:47] but if you can receive truth now
[51:50] it's because you've already received
[51:52] truth before
[51:56] what chance of that what
[51:59] chance are you going to be deceived if
[52:02] you've already received
[52:04] truth before you've already been taught
[52:06] of the father before
[52:07] you say well what form was that in i
[52:09] don't know but it was a form that i
[52:11] could be taught in
[52:13] and it was a form that i could receive
[52:15] that teaching and know it was true
[52:17] to the point that i would resist the
[52:18] devil's lie in heaven and kick him out
[52:27] every man therefore that hath heard
[52:31] and hath learned of the father cometh to
[52:34] me
[52:36] not that any man hath seen the father
[52:41] but that's what save means
[52:44] but he which is of god
[52:50] he hath seen the father you say well i
[52:53] don't remember that
[52:54] neither do i what form was that in i
[52:57] don't know
[52:58] but i could be taught in that form i
[53:01] could resist the devil's lie in that
[53:03] form
[53:04] and i saw my father in that form
[53:08] and that's why i can be taught now
[53:15] why i can see him now
[53:18] and that's why let's go to john 3 13
[53:20] don't turn there you don't have time
[53:22] and no man hath to send it up to heaven
[53:26] but he that came down from heaven
[53:31] even the son of man which is in heaven
[53:34] how many times we've read that and we
[53:36] said oh yeah the son of man was in
[53:37] heaven and now he's on earth
[53:38] no read it again no man
[53:43] no man nobody
[53:47] hath ascended to heaven remember this is
[53:50] an eternal word if it applied then it
[53:52] applies now
[53:53] so do you intend to go to heaven
[53:57] somebody say yes for goodness sakes
[54:01] if you intend to go to heaven you better
[54:04] have already been to heaven
[54:06] because you're not going to heaven if
[54:07] you haven't already been there
[54:09] this is an eternal word word this was
[54:12] not just applying in jesus's day he's
[54:14] not just saying
[54:15] that people that have died up to this
[54:17] point
[54:18] none of them have gone to heaven
[54:21] except they came down from heaven this
[54:23] is an eternal word this applies now
[54:25] so if you intend to go to heaven that
[54:28] means you've already been to heaven
[54:30] and if you haven't already been to
[54:32] heaven you're not going
[54:36] because if you weren't in heaven you
[54:38] were not taught of the father
[54:40] and there's no way for you to get back
[54:42] to heaven unless you are taught of the
[54:44] father here
[54:46] if you were not already in heaven there
[54:48] is no way for the
[54:49] for you to have seen the father and for
[54:51] the father to have seen you and to
[54:52] recognize you as his child
[54:58] if you had not been to heaven
[55:02] you cannot ascend to heaven
[55:06] per jesus no man
[55:10] hath ascended up to heaven but he
[55:14] which came down from heaven
[55:17] even the son of man
[55:21] which is in heaven the son of man does
[55:25] not just apply to jesus's corporal body
[55:27] who is vocalizing these words
[55:31] we're familiar with that teaching i hope
[55:34] brother random says what does the son of
[55:37] man ministry do
[55:38] what's its purpose to produce the son of
[55:41] man
[55:42] again the son of man is the fullness of
[55:46] the word
[55:46] in flesh jesus
[55:49] said that the son of man
[55:53] let me back up for a second because i
[55:54] want to lay a trap for you are you the
[55:56] word made flesh
[56:00] if you were the word made flesh you are
[56:02] the son of man
[56:04] and if you were the son of man you have
[56:07] been to heaven and you have descended
[56:08] from heaven
[56:10] and while you were in heaven you were
[56:13] taught of the father
[56:15] you saw him and he recognized you
[56:19] and that's why here even now in a
[56:22] hybrid condition you can receive this
[56:26] message
[56:28] you can recognize him you can see him
[56:31] in the form that he has chose to come in
[56:34] the
[56:34] revealed word the reason that people
[56:38] have such a problem
[56:39] recognizing 1963 as the coming of the
[56:42] father
[56:43] is because they hadn't seen the father
[56:45] before period
[56:47] because if you would have seen the
[56:48] father and been taught of the father and
[56:50] he would have recognized you as his
[56:51] child
[56:52] you would recognize that he said i'm
[56:53] going to come in the form of the
[56:54] revealed word and that is me
[56:56] nothing different if you can't recognize
[57:00] him now
[57:02] in the form that he chose to come in
[57:04] it's because you didn't recognize him
[57:06] then because you weren't there
[57:09] i am from above year from beneath
[57:13] there's still those classes of people
[57:16] your hybrid spirit did not see the
[57:19] father
[57:20] that's why it tells you every day that
[57:22] he didn't come
[57:25] that's why he tells you every day he's
[57:26] definitely not in you because he didn't
[57:28] come there's no way for him to be in you
[57:32] your hybrid spirit was never taught of
[57:35] the father
[57:36] that's why it lies to you every day and
[57:38] tells you that you can't be
[57:40] taught of the father that you're going
[57:41] to be lost
[57:43] that you're going to be deceived
[57:46] your hybrid spirit came from the father
[57:48] of lies that's why it lies to you
[57:53] because the father of lies got kicked
[57:55] out of heaven
[57:58] he was not properly taught by the father
[58:02] because he couldn't receive that
[58:03] teaching he resisted it
[58:08] that's why your hybrid spirit reacts to
[58:10] the word
[58:12] the same way today it's because it's
[58:15] what it did back then
[58:18] it's going to do the same thing today so
[58:21] when your hybrid
[58:22] spirit resists the word now recognize it
[58:25] for what it is it's your hybrid spirit
[58:26] it's not you
[58:28] because you were taught of the father
[58:30] you
[58:31] did see the father you were in heaven
[58:33] and you have descended from heaven and
[58:35] you're going back to heaven
[58:37] amen
[58:45] jesus told them murmur not among you
[58:48] among yourselves i'll say to you
[58:52] murmur not to yourself
[58:57] he has declared this of you
[59:00] he has declared this of us saints
[59:05] he is the one obligated to fulfill it in
[59:07] our lives
[59:08] there is no way that we can do these
[59:10] things that he's tasked us with doing
[59:13] but he can do them let's believe what he
[59:17] said
[59:19] let's not murmur let's not
[59:22] murmur up here
[59:26] well the word says this but i don't see
[59:28] how that's possible that can't be me
[59:30] okay maybe my pastor maybe the maybe the
[59:32] musicians
[59:33] maybe the song labor not me not me nope
[59:40] murmur not amongst yourself
[59:43] do you intend to go to heaven you've
[59:45] already been to heaven
[59:48] it's that simple and if you were in
[59:49] heaven you were in todd of the father
[59:52] can you receive the word for your day
[59:55] if you can receive the word of word for
[59:57] your day that means you were already
[59:59] taught of the father saints
[1:00:03] you say you keep saying the same thing
[1:00:04] over and over and over i know
[1:00:06] sorry but somebody's got to believe that
[1:00:09] somebody's having a hard time believing
[1:00:11] that it's true saints
[1:00:13] it's true i cannot mechanicalize it for
[1:00:16] you
[1:00:17] i am sorry maybe one day we'll be able
[1:00:19] to i cannot mechanicalize it for you
[1:00:22] i cannot draw you a picture i cannot
[1:00:25] tell you the terminology that fits that
[1:00:30] i don't know what form it was i just
[1:00:32] know it was a form that i could be
[1:00:33] taught
[1:00:35] by the father i could kick the devil out
[1:00:37] of heaven
[1:00:38] and that i could see the father
[1:00:41] you say well what if that was just a
[1:00:43] thought
[1:00:44] we've already had that discussion god's
[1:00:47] thoughts are real
[1:00:49] if it was just a thought i'm okay with
[1:00:52] that
[1:00:53] i don't need to mechanicalize it anymore
[1:00:56] i'm okay with that
[1:00:59] 47 verily verily i say unto you he that
[1:01:01] believeth on me
[1:01:02] hath everlasting life i am that bread of
[1:01:05] life
[1:01:06] your fathers did eat men in the
[1:01:08] wilderness and are dead this is the
[1:01:10] bread which cometh down from heaven that
[1:01:12] man may eat thereof and not die
[1:01:14] i am the living bread which came down
[1:01:16] from heaven
[1:01:18] saints he is not backing up on this
[1:01:22] if any man eat of this bread he shall
[1:01:24] live forever
[1:01:25] the bread that i will give is my flesh
[1:01:28] which i will give for the life of the
[1:01:30] world
[1:01:31] the jews therefore strove among
[1:01:33] themselves saying
[1:01:34] how can this man how can this man give
[1:01:37] us his flesh to eat
[1:01:39] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[1:01:41] i say unto you
[1:01:42] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[1:01:44] man and drink his blood ye have no life
[1:01:47] in you
[1:01:47] whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh
[1:01:50] my blood hath eternal life
[1:01:52] and i will raise him up at the last day
[1:01:54] for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood
[1:01:57] is drink indeed
[1:01:59] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:02:01] blood dwelleth in me
[1:02:02] and i in him
[1:02:08] he that eateth my flesh
[1:02:11] the word and drinketh my blood
[1:02:15] revelation on the word dwelleth in me
[1:02:19] and i in him
[1:02:23] as the living father hath sent me and i
[1:02:25] live by the father
[1:02:27] so he that so he that eateth me
[1:02:30] even he shall live by me
[1:02:34] this is the bread
[1:02:37] which came down from heaven what is what
[1:02:40] is the bread that came down from heaven
[1:02:44] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:02:47] blood dwelleth in me
[1:02:49] and i in him that is the bread that's
[1:02:52] came down from heaven
[1:02:54] that is the bread that has still come
[1:02:56] down from heaven that is the bread
[1:02:58] that is on earth that came down from
[1:03:00] heaven that is the bread
[1:03:02] that you are that came down from heaven
[1:03:04] that is your
[1:03:06] life that came down from heaven walking
[1:03:08] on earth today
[1:03:10] the revealed word being manifested
[1:03:13] revelation to the revealed word
[1:03:18] that is the bread which came down from
[1:03:21] heaven
[1:03:22] not as your father's diddy manna and are
[1:03:24] dead
[1:03:26] he that eateth of this bread what
[1:03:30] bread the revelation that i and my
[1:03:33] father are one
[1:03:36] shall live forever these things said he
[1:03:40] in the synagogue
[1:03:41] synagogue as he taught in capernaum many
[1:03:44] therefore of his disciples when they had
[1:03:46] heard this
[1:03:46] said this is a hard saying
[1:03:50] who can hear it
[1:03:54] in the scripture
[1:03:58] nobody answered that question
[1:04:02] but i can answer that question
[1:04:06] this is a hard saying who can hear it
[1:04:11] those that were taught of the father
[1:04:15] those that hath seen the father those
[1:04:18] that were in heaven with the father and
[1:04:20] now have descended
[1:04:21] to do the will of the father those
[1:04:25] can receive it
[1:04:28] 61 then when jesus knew in himself that
[1:04:31] his disciples murmured at it
[1:04:33] he said unto them doth this offends you
[1:04:39] doth this offends you
[1:04:50] i and my father are one and these other
[1:04:52] things
[1:04:54] does this offend you
[1:04:59] okay let's argue about it let's debate
[1:05:01] about it
[1:05:04] let's build fences about it
[1:05:07] let me build myself up about it let me
[1:05:08] put you down about it
[1:05:12] it's not what he did does this offend
[1:05:15] you
[1:05:17] okay well what if you see the son of man
[1:05:20] ascend up
[1:05:21] where he was before
[1:05:24] what will you say about that well that
[1:05:26] offends you too
[1:05:32] you say well that was jesus remember
[1:05:34] john 3 13
[1:05:36] no man hath ascended up to heaven but he
[1:05:38] that came down from heaven
[1:05:40] even the son of man which is in heaven
[1:05:42] amen
[1:05:45] don't debate about it don't argue about
[1:05:47] it just keep giving the word
[1:05:49] just keep giving the word if there's a
[1:05:51] seed there it'll spring to life
[1:05:53] just keep giving the word does this
[1:05:55] offend you
[1:05:58] what will you do when you see the son of
[1:05:59] man ascend up into heaven where i was
[1:06:02] before
[1:06:05] 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth
[1:06:08] the flesh profiteth nothing
[1:06:13] the words that i speak
[1:06:19] the words that i speak unto you
[1:06:25] they are spirit and they are life the
[1:06:28] words that i speak
[1:06:31] you speak the words you speak the words
[1:06:35] that i speak
[1:06:36] they are spirit and they are life saints
[1:06:39] if we have a problem with that
[1:06:41] we've got a problem with the message
[1:06:44] because if that's not true that
[1:06:46] means there is another option besides
[1:06:47] this message
[1:06:51] and if there is another option besides
[1:06:54] this
[1:06:54] message we're lost and foolish people
[1:07:01] there is not another way jesus said i
[1:07:04] am the way.
[1:07:11] the words that i speak unto you
[1:07:16] they are spirit and they are life
[1:07:22] does that offend you
[1:07:27] i and my father are one and these other
[1:07:29] things
[1:07:31] the words that i speak
[1:07:34] you say you are a hybrid individual
[1:07:36] you're right
[1:07:37] and if it was the hybrid individual
[1:07:39] speaking those words we would have a
[1:07:40] major problem
[1:07:42] but the hybrid individual cannot speak
[1:07:44] those words saints
[1:07:48] when i say speak i don't mean vocalize
[1:07:51] the hybrid individual cannot live cannot
[1:07:54] speak those words
[1:07:56] there has to be something within to live
[1:08:00] those to speak those
[1:08:01] words to be a written epistle and i have
[1:08:05] no shame declaring to you that the words
[1:08:09] that the seed within me put whatever
[1:08:10] terminology you want to on it i don't
[1:08:12] care
[1:08:13] the seed within me the soul that came
[1:08:15] from god the words that it speak
[1:08:17] are spirit and they are life and if you
[1:08:19] do not believe them you will die in your
[1:08:22] sins
[1:08:24] it's a paradox we have to accept the
[1:08:27] paradox
[1:08:29] and i'm not so concerned about saying
[1:08:31] that to where somebody else believes it
[1:08:33] i'm concerned of saying that to where i
[1:08:35] believe it
[1:08:37] i'm not concerned if you can convince
[1:08:39] your co-worker of that
[1:08:41] i'm concerned if you can convince
[1:08:42] yourself of that
[1:08:48] does that offend you hybrid spirit
[1:08:52] good i'm going to say it again
[1:08:56] and if that offends you what are you
[1:08:58] going to do when you see me ascend back
[1:08:59] up into heaven to where i came down from
[1:09:03] you're probably going to have a major
[1:09:05] problem with that because there's no
[1:09:06] more mercy for you anymore
[1:09:08] and you're the father of lies and the
[1:09:10] author of lies
[1:09:13] i'm not concerned about convincing
[1:09:16] somebody else
[1:09:16] you should not be concerned about
[1:09:18] convincing somebody else
[1:09:20] convince yourself have the proper
[1:09:23] revelation yourself
[1:09:24] if you have the proper revelation
[1:09:26] yourself and you come across the seed of
[1:09:28] god
[1:09:29] and you say i my father are one and
[1:09:31] these other things quickly that seed
[1:09:33] will spring to life
[1:09:34] i assure you it's impossible for it not
[1:09:37] to spring to life
[1:09:38] it's impossible you cannot take a
[1:09:41] genuine seed and put it in the ground
[1:09:42] and put the proper water on it and the
[1:09:44] proper light on it and not have a
[1:09:46] response
[1:09:48] it has to respond
[1:09:51] but don't try to convince somebody else
[1:09:54] that they and their father are one and
[1:09:55] these other things if you don't even
[1:09:56] believe it yourself
[1:10:00] don't try it it won't work
[1:10:03] the words that i speak unto you they are
[1:10:05] spirit and they are life
[1:10:08] matthew 10 backs this up behold i send
[1:10:11] you forth as sheep in the midst of
[1:10:13] wolves
[1:10:13] biggie therefore wisest serpent and
[1:10:15] harmless as doves
[1:10:17] verse 40 he that receiveth you receiveth
[1:10:20] me
[1:10:22] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[1:10:24] that sent me
[1:10:29] acts 2 6. and it came to pass that as i
[1:10:33] made my journey paul speaking
[1:10:35] and was come nigh into damascus about
[1:10:38] noon suddenly they're shown from heaven
[1:10:39] a great light round about me
[1:10:41] and i fell under the ground and i heard
[1:10:42] a voice saying to me saul saul
[1:10:44] why persecutest thou me this is one of
[1:10:47] my favorite scriptures in the whole
[1:10:49] bible
[1:10:51] and i answered who art thou lord and he
[1:10:54] said unto me i am jesus of nazareth
[1:10:58] who thou persecute us and we all know
[1:11:01] paul never saw jesus paul was
[1:11:04] persecuting the early church
[1:11:08] he was persecuting people that had been
[1:11:10] in heaven and came down from heaven and
[1:11:12] were doing the work of god
[1:11:15] they were doing the will of the father
[1:11:17] and paul was persecuting them
[1:11:19] and god himself came and said i am jesus
[1:11:23] who you are persecuting
[1:11:26] see we're not out in left field when we
[1:11:28] preach these things saints they're all
[1:11:29] through the bible
[1:11:32] all through the bible she
[1:11:36] is him if we can't get comfortable with
[1:11:40] that
[1:11:41] you might as well eat drink and be merry
[1:11:45] you might as well just burn your bibles
[1:11:48] burn the churches
[1:11:49] shut everything down and just be happy
[1:11:52] and live whatever your hybrid spirit
[1:11:54] tells you to live
[1:11:56] because that is the message saints
[1:12:00] that is what we are returning back to we
[1:12:03] are returning back to genesis
[1:12:05] 5. he created man
[1:12:08] male and female created he them and
[1:12:11] called their name
[1:12:11] adam that is the message
[1:12:16] that is the message and that is what the
[1:12:19] prophet has
[1:12:19] came and in 1200 different ways
[1:12:23] tried to tell us
[1:12:27] i am jesus of nazareth
[1:12:30] whom thou persecutest
[1:12:34] matthew 25 40 and the king shall answer
[1:12:37] and say unto them
[1:12:38] verily remember we're talking about the
[1:12:40] words that i speak unto you they are
[1:12:42] spirit and they are life
[1:12:44] and the king shall answer and say unto
[1:12:46] them verily verily i say unto you
[1:12:48] in so much as ye have done unto one of
[1:12:50] the least of these my brethren
[1:12:52] ye have done to me
[1:12:56] he's the one that's put in this in this
[1:12:58] position saints
[1:12:59] not ourselves
[1:13:03] we're coming to a close just hang with
[1:13:05] me i know it's a wednesday night
[1:13:07] we're right about the hour mark we're
[1:13:08] going to wind this up really quickly
[1:13:10] but just stay with me through the rest
[1:13:12] of this second corinthians 5
[1:13:15] 17 therefore if any man be in christ he
[1:13:18] is a new creature
[1:13:19] old things are passed away behold all
[1:13:21] things are become new
[1:13:23] and all things are of god who hath
[1:13:26] reconciled us to himself by jesus christ
[1:13:28] and hath given to us the ministry of
[1:13:30] reconciliation
[1:13:32] who hath given it he gave it
[1:13:36] we may not even ask for it he gave it
[1:13:41] because he had seen us before he had
[1:13:43] taught us before
[1:13:44] and we came to do his will he has to
[1:13:47] give us
[1:13:48] the ministry of reconciliation
[1:13:51] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[1:13:54] as though god did beseech you by
[1:13:57] us that's a mouthful
[1:14:03] god's going to beseech you by me
[1:14:07] god's going to beseech me by you
[1:14:11] you're in a hybrid condition yeah
[1:14:14] saul saul why persecutest thou
[1:14:18] me so were the early christians in a
[1:14:21] hybrid condition
[1:14:22] god had zero problem identifying himself
[1:14:25] as them i did not say with them i said
[1:14:28] as
[1:14:28] them
[1:14:33] big difference if he would identify with
[1:14:35] them
[1:14:36] he did not he identified as them
[1:14:41] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[1:14:43] as though god did beseech you by us
[1:14:46] we pray you in christ's stead
[1:14:51] be ye reconciled to god
[1:14:57] these other things are not just
[1:14:59] something we're pulling out of a hat
[1:15:00] somewhere saints
[1:15:01] these other things are not just things
[1:15:03] that brother brandon made up because it
[1:15:04] sounded good
[1:15:06] in fact these other things got him
[1:15:07] kicked out of churches he had no reason
[1:15:10] to say these other things unless they
[1:15:11] were true because the response that he
[1:15:14] got was the same response that jesus got
[1:15:17] unpopular take up stones to stone him
[1:15:19] he's possessed to the devil
[1:15:23] he's false we know him
[1:15:27] he's the son of charles and alibranum
[1:15:31] he had no other reason to teach these
[1:15:33] other things saints
[1:15:34] it benefited him nothing unless they
[1:15:36] were true and that there was somebody
[1:15:38] that needed to hear him
[1:15:40] verse 21 for he hath made him to be sin
[1:15:44] for us who knew no sin that we
[1:15:47] might be made the righteousness
[1:15:51] of god in him
[1:15:54] that's a mouthful the righteousness of
[1:15:56] god
[1:15:58] brother branham says in the church age
[1:15:59] book if you accept
[1:16:01] jesus christ as your savior and you must
[1:16:05] you automatically accept that you are
[1:16:07] the righteousness of god
[1:16:10] to reject one is to reject the other
[1:16:13] it's not optional and if you accept him
[1:16:16] as your personal savior just in
[1:16:18] christianity 101 as
[1:16:20] simple as it comes you automatically
[1:16:23] accept yourself
[1:16:24] as the righteousness of god tell me
[1:16:28] that the righteousness of god does not
[1:16:30] have the power to remit sins on earth
[1:16:32] tell me the righteousness of god is not
[1:16:35] the bread that has come down from heaven
[1:16:37] tell me that it is not the water that
[1:16:39] this world needs
[1:16:41] tell me that it is not the light that
[1:16:43] this darkness needs
[1:16:48] it is and it is the only bread it is the
[1:16:51] only water it is the only life
[1:16:55] and the righteousness of god is what it
[1:16:58] has been
[1:16:59] from now back to whenever time started
[1:17:02] the revealed word for that age
[1:17:07] when you take the revealed word for that
[1:17:10] age
[1:17:11] and you put it in flesh hybrid or
[1:17:14] not that is the righteousness of god
[1:17:20] tell yourself that when you wake up in
[1:17:22] the morning
[1:17:24] doesn't matter what your hybrid spirit
[1:17:26] says
[1:17:28] just tell it hybrid spirit
[1:17:31] hybrid spirit why persecutest
[1:17:34] thou me and if you're real lucky
[1:17:38] it will ask you the same question
[1:17:41] who art thou
[1:17:46] i am jesus whom thou persecutest
[1:17:51] as the musicians come john 10
[1:17:54] jesus answered them verse 34
[1:17:57] is it not written in your law ye
[1:18:01] are gods see jesus did not back up on
[1:18:04] this word
[1:18:05] in fact he had a problem that they did
[1:18:08] not believe it
[1:18:12] this wasn't just something he was
[1:18:13] throwing out there okay well if you
[1:18:14] believe it okay if not okay
[1:18:18] jesus had a problem that they did not
[1:18:20] believe what he was saying
[1:18:23] he said is it not written in your own
[1:18:25] law
[1:18:26] that i said ye are gods
[1:18:38] is it not written in your law that i
[1:18:40] said you're god's
[1:18:47] it's almost like he was saying he was
[1:18:48] the one that wrote the law
[1:18:52] nobody asked him a question about that
[1:18:54] they were too mad that he would
[1:18:55] he already said that he was the bread
[1:18:56] that came down from heaven they couldn't
[1:18:58] get over that
[1:19:00] if he called them gods unto whom the
[1:19:04] word of god came has the word of god
[1:19:05] came to you
[1:19:09] don't leave this on the paper saints
[1:19:12] don't leave this 2000 years ago
[1:19:14] if it applied then it applies now
[1:19:18] and if we reject the implications of
[1:19:21] receiving the revealed word for our age
[1:19:25] we are rejecting christ
[1:19:29] we cannot receive the word in a
[1:19:31] superficial intellectual understanding
[1:19:33] and accept
[1:19:34] christ we have to receive him in the
[1:19:36] trueness of the fullness of the word
[1:19:39] and we have to bear the implications and
[1:19:42] believe the implications
[1:19:43] that it comes with regardless if
[1:19:47] two-thirds doesn't believe it
[1:19:50] two-thirds didn't believe it in heaven
[1:19:52] what makes you think your two-thirds are
[1:19:54] going to believe it now
[1:19:57] not going to happen it doesn't change
[1:20:00] the fact that it's true
[1:20:03] and jesus is not going to be happy if
[1:20:06] you don't believe that
[1:20:11] is it not written that i said you're a
[1:20:14] gods
[1:20:14] if he called them gods and to whom the
[1:20:17] word of god came
[1:20:18] and the scripture cannot be broken say
[1:20:20] ye of him who the father hath sanctified
[1:20:22] and sent into the world has he
[1:20:24] sanctified you has he sent you into the
[1:20:26] world
[1:20:27] thou blasphemest because i said i am the
[1:20:31] son of god
[1:20:36] if he sanctified you and he sent you
[1:20:39] into the world
[1:20:41] if you say anything other than you are
[1:20:44] the son of god or the daughter of god
[1:20:46] you're blaspheming
[1:20:50] if i do not the works of my father
[1:20:52] believe me not
[1:20:54] but if i do though ye believe me not
[1:20:58] believe the works
[1:21:01] remember what the works were
[1:21:04] not your conduct the
[1:21:07] works was to believe on he which god
[1:21:12] sent
[1:21:15] believe the works have you believed on
[1:21:19] who god has sent
[1:21:21] don't say amen to that thinking about
[1:21:23] brother branham
[1:21:25] do you believe on he who god has sent
[1:21:31] that ye may know and believe
[1:21:36] that the father is in me and i
[1:21:40] am in him
[1:21:45] right back to square one
[1:21:50] jesus cried and said he that believeth
[1:21:52] on me this is chapter 12
[1:21:53] believeth not on me but on him that sent
[1:21:56] me
[1:22:02] jesus cried and said
[1:22:05] he that believeth on me believeth not on
[1:22:08] me but on him
[1:22:11] that sent me
[1:22:14] and he that seeth me seeth him that sent
[1:22:17] me
[1:22:20] i am a light unto the world
[1:22:24] that whosoever believeth on me should
[1:22:27] not abide in darkness
[1:22:30] when you begin to say i
[1:22:33] and the father are one and these other
[1:22:36] things
[1:22:38] the shock will pull away
[1:22:45] he that seeth me
[1:22:48] seeth god
[1:22:51] for god has sent me and i'm here to do
[1:22:53] his will
[1:22:56] you say well kind of no
[1:23:00] not kind of
[1:23:03] he that seeth me seeth him
[1:23:07] that sent me you remember the little
[1:23:09] story that brother branham told about
[1:23:10] the woman that confronted him on this
[1:23:12] and he said she says you're preaching
[1:23:14] the oneness of god wrong
[1:23:16] jesus was saying that when you see him
[1:23:18] you've seen god like
[1:23:20] when you when i've seen you i've seen
[1:23:22] your wife
[1:23:25] he says oh no oh no
[1:23:28] or she said that it's the same as you
[1:23:30] and your wife are one
[1:23:31] and he said oh no he said jesus said
[1:23:34] when you've seen me you've seen the
[1:23:35] father
[1:23:37] when you've seen me you do not see my
[1:23:39] wife
[1:23:42] see we just thought that was a little
[1:23:44] carnal story he dropped in there
[1:23:47] we didn't realize it was actually one of
[1:23:48] these other things
[1:23:51] that jesus had said i and my
[1:23:54] father are one and when you have seen
[1:23:58] me you have seen the father
[1:24:03] that's bold saints but don't back up on
[1:24:07] it because it's true
[1:24:09] the father consists of the word
[1:24:13] the father is the word and if we have
[1:24:17] received the word
[1:24:19] because we've see we've received he that
[1:24:21] he has sent
[1:24:22] and we believed on what he has said to
[1:24:24] be true if we have received that we have
[1:24:27] received the father
[1:24:29] and therefore if we have received the
[1:24:31] father jesus said
[1:24:33] he that seeth me seeth him that sent me
[1:24:38] and i am a light
[1:24:41] into the world that whosoever believeth
[1:24:44] on me should not
[1:24:45] abide in darkness
[1:24:49] two more scriptures then we'll close if
[1:24:51] you'll play something quietly please
[1:24:53] john 13 verily verily i say unto you he
[1:24:56] that receiveth whosoever
[1:24:58] i send receiveth me
[1:25:02] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[1:25:06] that sent me
[1:25:08] saints he is saying the same thing so
[1:25:11] many different
[1:25:12] ways that we can't miss it
[1:25:17] they then ask him to say it plainly and
[1:25:20] he did
[1:25:21] and they still missed it we now
[1:25:24] through a vindicated messenger can see
[1:25:26] these things
[1:25:28] and he is saying them over and over this
[1:25:31] is in chapter 8
[1:25:32] chapter 10 chapter 12 chapter 13 chapter
[1:25:36] 18
[1:25:36] he is saying the same thing over and
[1:25:39] over
[1:25:40] and over
[1:25:45] because he knows that one day
[1:25:50] it will come to the point that we
[1:25:53] as hybrid individuals with 66 percent
[1:25:58] against us will have to say and believe
[1:26:01] these things
[1:26:04] i and my father are one
[1:26:09] john 18 pilate therefore said unto them
[1:26:11] art thou
[1:26:12] a king jesus answered
[1:26:15] thou sayest i am a king to this
[1:26:19] end was i born and for this cause came i
[1:26:22] into the world that i should bear
[1:26:25] witness
[1:26:26] unto the truth everyone
[1:26:30] that is of the truth heareth my
[1:26:34] voice
[1:26:38] brother branham says what we need today
[1:26:41] is thousands of lived
[1:26:46] voices thundering out
[1:26:52] not passing out matches message books
[1:26:54] saying read this
[1:26:55] there's nothing wrong with that we
[1:26:57] should do that
[1:26:59] not sending an mp3 file and saying tell
[1:27:02] me what you think of this
[1:27:04] we should do that we should do more of
[1:27:06] that
[1:27:09] that's not what he was after though he
[1:27:11] says
[1:27:12] what we need is thousands of lived
[1:27:16] voices declaring i and my
[1:27:19] father are one and these other things
[1:27:24] that's what we need thundering out
[1:27:32] but there are some of you that believe
[1:27:34] not for jesus knew from the beginning
[1:27:37] who they were that believe not and who
[1:27:39] should betray him
[1:27:40] and he said therefore said unto you that
[1:27:43] no man can come unto me except it were
[1:27:46] given of him of my father
[1:27:48] we went back to chapter six i'm sorry
[1:27:50] i'm just going to finish this up
[1:27:52] this is the end of chapter 6.
[1:27:55] therefore i said unto you that no man
[1:27:57] can come unto me accept it given
[1:27:58] it was given unto him of my father from
[1:28:01] that time
[1:28:04] from what time from the time that he
[1:28:06] declared i am the bread
[1:28:08] i am the water i am the life i have
[1:28:11] descended out of heaven to do the will
[1:28:13] of thought of my father
[1:28:15] from that time
[1:28:18] many of his disciples went back and
[1:28:21] walked
[1:28:21] no more with the message of the hour
[1:28:29] i find it coincidental that that's in
[1:28:31] chapter 6 verse 66
[1:28:34] not a good verse to be found in
[1:28:38] then jesus said unto the twelve will
[1:28:40] thou will ye
[1:28:42] also go away then simon peter answered
[1:28:45] to him
[1:28:46] lord to whom shall we go thou
[1:28:49] hast the words of eternal life and we
[1:28:52] believe and are sure that thou art the
[1:28:54] christ the son of the living god
[1:28:57] jesus answered them thank you peter
[1:29:02] thank you i'm so glad you'll stick with
[1:29:04] me i love you all
[1:29:08] jesus answered them have not chosen you
[1:29:11] 12 and want to use the devil
[1:29:15] don't expect the message to get easier
[1:29:17] saints
[1:29:19] if you are having a tough time
[1:29:21] swallowing i and my father are one and
[1:29:22] these other things don't expect it to
[1:29:24] get easier
[1:29:26] [Music]
[1:29:28] don't expect it to get easier because
[1:29:30] it's at that time
[1:29:33] it's at that time that he declares i've
[1:29:34] chosen you and one of you is the devil
[1:29:37] it's at that time the antichrist spirit
[1:29:39] really starts being revealed and
[1:29:40] declared
[1:29:42] not out there saints in here
[1:29:48] have not i chosen you twelve and one of
[1:29:51] you is a devil
[1:29:55] maybe he could say to us have not i
[1:29:57] chosen you 33 percent
[1:30:00] and 66 percent of you is a devil
[1:30:03] yea yea lord
[1:30:06] but where would i go thou alone has the
[1:30:09] words of eternal life
[1:30:12] he spake of judas as carrick the son of
[1:30:14] simon for he
[1:30:15] was that that should betray him being
[1:30:19] one of the twelve praise the lord i got
[1:30:21] through chapter six
[1:30:22] let's stand
[1:30:37] every man therefore that
[1:30:40] hath heard have you heard
[1:30:45] and hath learned have you learned
[1:30:49] of the father cometh to me not any man
[1:30:53] hath seen the father save he
[1:30:57] which is of god are you of god
[1:31:00] he hath seen the father
[1:31:04] the form that the father has come in
[1:31:07] saints is the revealed
[1:31:09] word let it teach you
[1:31:14] see it be
[1:31:17] lifted up in the heavenly places where
[1:31:20] you were before
[1:31:23] don't back up on it declare the word of
[1:31:26] god
[1:31:27] regardless if 66 of you doesn't believe
[1:31:30] it or not
[1:31:32] not concerned about that 66 percent it
[1:31:35] is going to
[1:31:36] one of them 133 percent is going to go
[1:31:39] and be no more
[1:31:40] the other 33 percent is going to have
[1:31:41] its dna changed
[1:31:43] it'll take care of itself
[1:31:46] i'm concerned with the seed my soul
[1:31:49] my heart my true desires whatever you
[1:31:52] want to call it
[1:31:53] and i accept what he has said about me
[1:31:57] i accept the fact that i and my
[1:32:01] father the word are one
[1:32:04] i hope you can accept that i believe you
[1:32:06] accept that
[1:32:08] it should change our life saints a true
[1:32:10] revelation of that should
[1:32:12] change our lives and put us in a place
[1:32:16] that we can then declare
[1:32:19] i will do nothing i will do nothing
[1:32:23] outside of what my father showed with me
[1:32:25] i will do
[1:32:26] nothing i will crucify myself
[1:32:30] each and every day i will crucify my
[1:32:32] will each and every day
[1:32:33] to only do that which is of the father's
[1:32:37] business
[1:32:38] that's the point of it saints it's not
[1:32:41] to get lifted up
[1:32:43] it's to be humbled down that's the point
[1:32:46] of that revelation
[1:32:47] let's pray together precious lord jesus
[1:32:50] we thank you for this time that you've
[1:32:51] given us lord
[1:32:54] we would just pray that you would come
[1:32:56] lord and
[1:32:57] take the words that have been spoken
[1:33:00] lord we
[1:33:01] know that they are true because you have
[1:33:04] declared them
[1:33:05] and you have re-declared them through
[1:33:07] your vindicated messenger
[1:33:09] and we are here testifying that we
[1:33:13] are demonstrating the works of god by
[1:33:16] believing
[1:33:17] on him who you have sent and we accept
[1:33:23] that which he has told us and he has
[1:33:26] told us
[1:33:27] that we and our father
[1:33:31] are one and these other things lord
[1:33:35] i pray that you would just make them a
[1:33:37] reality in our life
[1:33:38] i pray that you would just be with us as
[1:33:40] we would go from here
[1:33:42] lord we're still in a carnal hybrid
[1:33:44] world
[1:33:45] and there's snow on the roads and it's
[1:33:47] slick and it's icy and it's cold
[1:33:49] but we have a scripture that says that
[1:33:51] the angels of god are encamped about him
[1:33:53] that fear him
[1:33:55] lord so we're not scared of that we
[1:33:58] would just relax in knowing that you're
[1:34:00] guiding us
[1:34:01] you have safely got us here you will
[1:34:03] safely deliver us home
[1:34:05] and we pray that as we would go about
[1:34:10] from this time forward that you would
[1:34:12] allow us
[1:34:13] to be about your business we ask these
[1:34:16] things thanking you in the name of the
[1:34:19] lord jesus christ
[1:34:20] amen god bless you saints let's sing
[1:34:23] brother ben
[1:34:24] as our pastor would come o father
[1:34:32] [Music]
[1:34:36] oh father we
[1:34:41] are one
[1:34:48] [Music]
[1:34:56] [Music]
[1:34:59] [Laughter]
[1:35:10] [Music]
[1:35:12] we
[1:35:14] [Music]
[1:35:20] we are
[1:35:28] [Music]
[1:35:38] we are
[1:35:45] praise the lord you know i was thinking
[1:35:48] right as brother ben was talking and he
[1:35:51] even made the statement but i wrote it
[1:35:53] on my paper before he said that
[1:35:55] he said your body and your mind cannot
[1:35:58] believe
[1:35:59] that you've been in heaven because it
[1:36:02] hasn't been there
[1:36:05] there's only one part of you and that
[1:36:07] was the part that was an attribute of
[1:36:08] the father
[1:36:10] and that's the part that brother brent
[1:36:11] is talking about not what you see
[1:36:14] not the mind that you think with but
[1:36:16] there's some part of god
[1:36:17] that god has chosen to distribute in the
[1:36:20] earth in this time
[1:36:21] and that part is in you and that's part
[1:36:24] of god that's part of the word that's
[1:36:25] part of his mind
[1:36:26] that's the part that he wants to take
[1:36:29] and he wants to finish his work with
[1:36:31] and what he's asking for us is to
[1:36:33] believe him and to surrender
[1:36:35] and to try to stay out of his way so
[1:36:37] that he can do it
[1:36:39] it's not what we're going to be able to
[1:36:40] do we will never be able to do anything
[1:36:42] to begin with but
[1:36:43] we've got to believe that god is chosen
[1:36:46] it's god's choosing it's a part of god's
[1:36:48] life and i've just got to get this
[1:36:51] hybrid self out of the way
[1:36:52] and die and let god do what god wants to
[1:36:55] do
[1:36:55] [Music]
[1:36:57] man i'd like to i was reading today and
[1:37:00] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:37:02] and brother benham said the bride
[1:37:03] becomes the word
[1:37:05] by letting the word flow through her
[1:37:08] you become the word by just letting the
[1:37:11] word flow from surrender
[1:37:13] surrendering and letting him have his
[1:37:15] way
[1:37:16] amen and when brother man's preaching
[1:37:19] christ is the mystery of god
[1:37:20] revealed i just so realized and i
[1:37:21] realized during the preaching tonight
[1:37:23] that preeminence is the key without
[1:37:26] his absolute total preeminence it's
[1:37:30] impossible
[1:37:31] [Music]
[1:37:32] because there's the hybrid self can do
[1:37:34] nothing
[1:37:36] i want to read a couple scriptures while
[1:37:37] we're standing i don't want to hold you
[1:37:39] longer just to hold you longer but i
[1:37:41] just want to read something out of
[1:37:43] uh john chapter 5. go back to john
[1:37:51] john chapter 5
[1:37:54] [Music]
[1:37:58] i believe it's john 5.
[1:38:03] john 10. yeah
[1:38:06] john chapter 5
[1:38:11] and let's go to verse 17.
[1:38:15] but jesus answered them my father
[1:38:17] worketh hitherto
[1:38:18] and i work therefore the jews sought the
[1:38:22] more to kill him because he not only had
[1:38:23] broken the sabbath
[1:38:25] but said also that god was his father
[1:38:28] making himself equal with god
[1:38:30] they realized that if he said god with
[1:38:32] his father and he was the son of god
[1:38:35] then he made himself equal to god let me
[1:38:37] go over here to
[1:38:38] john chapter 10 what what our brother
[1:38:40] ben had just read
[1:38:43] he says verse 29 my father which gave
[1:38:45] them me is greater than all and no man
[1:38:47] is able to pluck them out of my father's
[1:38:49] hand
[1:38:50] i and my father are one then the jews
[1:38:53] took up stones again to stone him
[1:38:56] jesus answered many good works have i
[1:38:58] shown you from my father for which of
[1:38:59] these works
[1:39:00] do you stone me the jews answered him
[1:39:03] saying for a good work we stone thee not
[1:39:06] but for blasphemy because thou being a
[1:39:08] man maketh thyself
[1:39:09] god jesus didn't say he was god he said
[1:39:13] god was his father
[1:39:15] but they drew the equal sign now let's
[1:39:18] go to john chapter 20.
[1:39:23] this is after jesus resurrection and he
[1:39:26] shows himself to mary
[1:39:30] verse 16 john chapter 20 verse 16.
[1:39:34] jesus said unto her mary she turneth
[1:39:36] herself in saith unto him
[1:39:37] rabboni which is to say master jesus
[1:39:41] says unto her touch me not for i am not
[1:39:43] yet ascended to my father
[1:39:44] but go to my brethren and say unto them
[1:39:47] i ascend to my father
[1:39:50] and your father
[1:39:54] and to my god and your god
[1:39:57] [Music]
[1:39:59] when jesus had died and he resurrected
[1:40:01] he didn't just leave it his
[1:40:03] father only he said i go to my father
[1:40:06] and your father meaning you have the
[1:40:09] same father
[1:40:11] you are brethren he calls you his
[1:40:14] brethren
[1:40:16] you've come from the same life amen
[1:40:18] you've come from the lame same life
[1:40:19] source
[1:40:20] you're part of the same word you're part
[1:40:22] of the same thing amen
[1:40:24] and it in and the message has come to
[1:40:27] awaken us to who we really are we can no
[1:40:29] longer identify with the outer man we
[1:40:31] have to identify with the reality of
[1:40:33] what's going on inside
[1:40:35] this message didn't come to quicken our
[1:40:36] minds it came to quicken the seed of god
[1:40:38] on the inside
[1:40:40] and the mind may never be able to fully
[1:40:42] comprehend it but there's another part
[1:40:44] of you that come from god
[1:40:45] that says i don't know how i don't
[1:40:47] understand why
[1:40:49] amen it's not reasonable always but i
[1:40:51] say that's true
[1:40:52] i come from god and i go to god
[1:40:56] and now if i could just surrender myself
[1:40:58] to this word and let this word flow
[1:41:00] through me i become the word by letting
[1:41:02] the word flow through me
[1:41:03] it's not what i do amen it's not it's
[1:41:06] not just words that come in on my mouth
[1:41:08] but it's what he does through me
[1:41:10] that's what all he wanted in this hour
[1:41:13] he's just
[1:41:14] asking me to believe him ender
[1:41:17] surrendered him
[1:41:19] these things are so hard because we
[1:41:21] realize we're not talking about
[1:41:24] this man i can't get anything right
[1:41:29] i can't say anything right i can't even
[1:41:31] think right
[1:41:33] we're not talking about this man we're
[1:41:35] talking about a portion of god that he
[1:41:37] placed down inside
[1:41:39] and he's quickened by the word and he
[1:41:41] wants to through that attribute of
[1:41:42] himself he wants to display himself
[1:41:44] if you can just die to self and say god
[1:41:47] i believe the word
[1:41:49] let the word flow through me let that
[1:41:52] light
[1:41:53] let the light that's inside come out let
[1:41:55] the life that's inside come out
[1:41:56] let the word that's inside come out but
[1:41:59] the reality
[1:42:00] that's trapped inside of this tabernacle
[1:42:04] let it come out lord rent the veil of my
[1:42:07] flesh
[1:42:09] let me die and surrender and show
[1:42:12] yourself mighty
[1:42:14] in this life praise be to god
[1:42:19] how many feels incapable
[1:42:21] [Music]
[1:42:22] but how many believes by the grace of
[1:42:24] god this is the hour
[1:42:26] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:42:30] we're not capable but he is and he
[1:42:33] didn't ask us to do it he asked us to
[1:42:35] believe
[1:42:36] and confess his word and watch him do it
[1:42:41] i mean let's just bow our heads and pray
[1:42:44] lord jesus we surrender ourselves afresh
[1:42:46] to you
[1:42:48] god you told us that you are the vine
[1:42:51] and we are the branches
[1:42:53] and the branch can do nothing without
[1:42:55] the vine
[1:42:57] and lord without you we can do nothing
[1:43:00] but lord we believe it is you
[1:43:02] we believe it's you you've been
[1:43:04] quickened within our hearts and we
[1:43:05] believe that's you
[1:43:06] lord wanting to manifest yourself
[1:43:08] through these tabernacles
[1:43:11] i pray god that you give us a greater
[1:43:12] surrender than we've ever had before
[1:43:15] that we could surrender to your word in
[1:43:17] everything and that we would know that
[1:43:18] everything we've heard in this message
[1:43:20] is what you've showed us father and we
[1:43:22] only do that which you show
[1:43:24] us and you've showed us your word in the
[1:43:26] message of the hour
[1:43:28] now may we confess it may we live it
[1:43:30] maybe more than words but may it be a
[1:43:32] manifested life
[1:43:34] god we surrender to you and ask that you
[1:43:36] would take complete control
[1:43:38] for without you we can do nothing
[1:43:42] god i pray that you'd give us the right
[1:43:45] confession
[1:43:47] the right words the right approach to
[1:43:49] you lord
[1:43:51] for god we're trusting in you lord
[1:43:54] you've called us to this hour
[1:43:56] you've sent an anointing in your word
[1:43:58] your spirit is here
[1:44:00] to quicken this word to life oh god
[1:44:03] we're just trusting in you to do it
[1:44:06] i pray that you take control as we go
[1:44:08] from here may we go knowing that these
[1:44:10] things are a living reality they're true
[1:44:13] you have no hands but our hands you have
[1:44:16] no mouth but our mouth lord
[1:44:18] all that you were you poured into christ
[1:44:20] amen and all was in christ is now poured
[1:44:23] into his body which is the bride on
[1:44:24] earth in this day
[1:44:27] god do you have a deity tabernacled in
[1:44:29] flesh once again
[1:44:31] oh god help us to realize how important
[1:44:34] it is that we just obey
[1:44:36] that we surrender that we humble
[1:44:38] ourselves we can't humble ourselves
[1:44:40] enough lord
[1:44:41] but if we could just lord to humble
[1:44:43] ourselves and stay out of the way
[1:44:45] that you can do what you've always
[1:44:47] intended to do
[1:44:48] in this hour through these vessels
[1:44:52] while we give you preeminence we pray
[1:44:54] you take a greater preeminence
[1:44:56] for that's what's necessary to manifest
[1:44:58] this life
[1:45:00] oh we pray that you bless our brother
[1:45:01] ben that you would continue to inspire
[1:45:03] him and anoint him that he might preach
[1:45:05] the word
[1:45:06] and god that you would bless him and his
[1:45:08] family bless us as we go from here
[1:45:10] may we shine the light of the gospel in
[1:45:12] every dark crevice in this world
[1:45:15] and may others see and come to life lord
[1:45:19] or we just give you preeminence in jesus
