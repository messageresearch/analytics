Well, it's the highway to heaven, and none can walk up there. But the pure in heart is the highway to heaven. I'm walking up the king's highway. Well, my way gets brighter, my load gets lighter.

Lord, we want to receive more from you as you unveil yourself to us, as you instruct us yourself. May Lord, your word be meat to us, Lord. May it sustain us and strengthen us and give us life.

We ask that you would bless us now as we look into your word. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you all. Amen. As you know and you heard and you received, I'm sure the email and the text that uh Sunday afternoon our sister Nancy Marorrow passed away. And uh and we're very thankful for Sister Nancy. Amen. She had lived 85 years upon this earth. She had been healthy and strong all the way up till the last two years. and her body just began to wear out and it was just time for her to go home and we're so thankful that she passed peacefully without struggle just in her sleep at home with her family around. So, we're thankful for that. And so, just want to let you know that there'll be a memorial service here this Saturday at 11:30 a.m. here in the sanctuary. So, if you're able to join us for that, that'll be nice as we remember the life of our sister. Uh also, there'll be a fellowship dinner to follow over in the fellowship hall. Uh wanted to also let you know that the sanctuary will still be open for prayer time Saturday as well uh from 3 to 10. So we'll keep that as regular. Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles now to Genesis chapter 22. Let's go there together. Just want to uh uh greet Sister Joanne, Sister Rebecca's mom. God bless you, Sister Joanne. It's good to have you here from Edmonton. I'm glad she gets to stay. She's going to be here for a few more weeks and it's always nice to have her come and visit with us. She's certainly not a stranger to us. Amen. So, we we're glad to borrow her from Edmonton for a little while. So, hopefully it's a little warmer here than it is there, so you can at least enjoy that. Amen. Praise God. Genesis 22 verse1 it says and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee in the land of Mariah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. Amen. May the Lord bless you as you have your seats. May the Lord bless us as we look into his word this morning. If we could bring up the PowerPoint, please. I want to take for a subject this afternoon. I say this morning, but I mean this afternoon. Uh I want to take for a subject reverential trust. So hopefully that comes up there, reverential trust. And you'll see where I get this title in just a moment. Uh but when I when I look at this uh scripture, this is the scripture that we just read. It came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham. This is Genesis 22. And we're going to spend some time in Genesis 22. We'll start there, take a couple scriptures, and then we're going to back up and then we'll we'll come back to it after a little while. But when he says he did tempt him, this word means to test, to try, to prove, to tempt, to assay, to put to the proof test. And brother Brandham said God loves to test his children. He loves to prove his children. Amen. Because because God knows what's on the inside and he loves to put it to the test. Amen. to demonstrate what's on the inside. And so God did tempt Abraham. And how did he tempt him? By asking him to offer Isaac. And then uh in Genesis 18, we have this statement about Abraham that is to me very profound. In in 18:18 he said, "Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him, for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him." God knew what Abraham was. God knew about Abraham. God understood Abraham. God knew it was in Abraham. And he knew he could put his trust in Abraham. God knew who he called. &gt;&gt; He knew who he called before he called him. Amen. And and God was working with Abraham through his life to develop Abraham and to bring out of him certain virtues and characteristics. Amen. But he says, "For I know him that he will command his children and his household after him." God knew he would. It wasn't a question. God knew he will. And he's speaking of the future. He will command his children in his household after him to do what? and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment. Amen. That the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him. So God, it's an amazing statement that he makes. God says, I know that he'll do this. I know he'll command his children in his household. I know that he'll lead them in the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. God chose him because this was who Abraham was. This was his nature. This was inside of Abraham. But God needed Abraham to display this so that God could fulfill all that he had spoken of Abraham. So God knew it was Abra in Abraham. But God needed it to be expressed in Abraham. So that God could keep his word in Abraham. &gt;&gt; So God had to develop these things in Abraham and draw them out of Abraham because God wanted to fulfill his promise in Abraham. He already knew that Abraham would do it. He knew it was in Abraham, but he needed Abraham to do it so that he could confirm his word to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. And guess what? We're seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; So when we look at Abraham's life, we can start to see the way God is dealing with us. He already knows what we're going to do. He's ordained us into good works, which he has ordained before the before the foundation of the world. He before ordained that we should walk in them. So God already knows what we're going to do. He knows what's inside of us, what's in the seed. Amen. But God needs those characteristics to come on display so that he can perform his word that is promised to us. He needs us to live this life. &gt;&gt; But he knows we will. But he needs us to so that he can. &gt;&gt; So God is working with us. Amen. Because he knows the potential that lays in us and all the circumstances on our life are God working with us to bring that out so that he can fulfill his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Amen. Life is not just treasury. Life is not just going through the motions. Not life is not just getting up and going to work and doing that and and I do that. That's part of my life. And then I serve God. That's another part of my life. No. All of life is God working with us. Amen. To draw these things out of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's nothing mundane. There's nothing routine. There's nothing without significance. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He says this of David in Acts 13. And he says, "And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king, to whom also he gave testimony and said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfill all my will." We talked about this before. What made David a man after God's own heart? Because God knew he shall fulfill my will. And we already talked about this. David wasn't a perfect man and he didn't do everything right. Neither was Abraham a perfect man and did everything right. But God knew that he would do this right. And God knew that David was a man after his own heart that would do all of his will. &gt;&gt; Even if he would do things that were wrong, he was correctable. He would come to line up with the word again. And God knew that he shall fulfill all my will. And that was a man after God's own heart, one that should fulfill his will. And his will is his &gt;&gt; word. &gt;&gt; He knew David would keep the word in line to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then when we go to Genesis 22:11 and 12, we had just read 22:1 and2 when God did tempt Abraham. And now he says in 11, and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham, and he said, here am I. And he said, lay not lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearthst God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. Amen. God already knew in Genesis 18, he's going to he's going to command his household and command his children, amen, to keep them in the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment. He already knew what was in Abraham. And and God already knew that Abraham fears him. When he came to this place of offering Isaac, there was something about it that so moved God that God said, "For now I know that thou fearest God, seeing that thou has not withheld thy son, thine only son from me." And I want to look at this word fear. When we we've talked about it, and I think you've heard brother Ram talk about it. We know the fear of the Lord, the fear of God. Thou fearest God. Amen. I want to look at this term for a minute. This word here it's used is is this word uh uh yre. It means fearing, reverent, and afraid. And it can mean all of these things. And in the context that it's used, it can it can it can hold uh different meaning. So the one that I'm looking at right now is reverent. I want to look at this word reverent. It's not necessarily to be afraid. Although this word means to be afraid. It can be used in a way that you're terrorized by something. You're fearful like in in great terror and fear, but it also can mean you're aed by something and mesmerized by it and give reverence to it. It's the same word. It can mean both things depending on how it's used. The the Hebrew word, Amen. When I looked it up, began to study it, it's really interesting. The Hebrew word is based off an emotional response. It's it's a Hebrew word is an emotional response that has the core or root to to to to to have your inward spilling out. Something like that. It means this is a reaction to something. You have an inside reaction. You're moved on the inside. And that can be fear as in terror, but can also be reverential awe and amazement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can be both. Amen. So, it depends on on the way that the word is used. But here we're looking at the word reverend. You see here where it says that it comes from 30 3372. You see this is 3373. This is just a number reference in the in the Strong's concordance. So if we go to the word 3372, it's this word. It's the the same word in a different tense. Yay. to fear, to revere, to be afraid, to fear, be afraid, to stand in awe, be aed by, to reverence, to honor, to respect. Amen. So when he feared God, it wasn't that he was afraid of God's punishment. He was afraid of God's terror. Amen. But it was this use of the word to stand in awe of, to be awed, to reverence, to honor, to respect. It's a high degree of reverence and respect because of awe and amazement and the worthiness of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a word like it that's used in the Greek and we find its use in the New Testament. And I'm going to share that with you so we can get an understanding of its use. In 1 Peter 3, it says, ' Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands, that if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives, while they behold your chase conversation coupled with fear. That word fear is not women who are in terror of abuse by their husbands, &gt;&gt; but women who reverence and respect and honor their husbands, and that will be a a a means by which their husbands can be converted. Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. So, this is the same. This is a Greek word, but it's it's the it's the same meaning. It means the same thing. It's used in very much the same way. Look how it's used here in Job. Job 1:8. And the Lord said unto Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth? A perfect man?" That means complete or fully mature. An upright man means that one's correct. One that fearth God, same word used the same way. and escueth evil. That means one who turns away from evil or rejects evil. Amen. So this is this is uh uh this is God speaking of Job. This is this is his his description of Job. Amen. Job is a perfect man, an upright one. Man of fear of God. He wasn't cowering in the corner waiting for God to throw stones at him. He had a great deal of reverence and respect for God. &gt;&gt; That's this fear of God. He was awed by God and he reverenced the amazing God. Amen. And so that's that's the way the word is used. Amen. There is a there's a definition in the the Skullfield Bible. I read a Scullfield Bible. And when I looked at this word, it referenced me over to Psalms 19:9. So I'm just going to turn over there real quick and read that to you and read the note that's there. Psalms 19:9. It says, "The fear of the Lord is clean." The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever. the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. But then Scoffield uh puts a note down here and he puts in he says the fear of the of the Lord a phrase of the Old Testament means piety meaning reverential trust with hatred of evil. That's where I got the title reverential trust. When I looked at that, it was amazing to me. It's a great deal of reverence, but it's a reverence in a perfect God. It's a reverence in an amazing God. It's a reverence that brings trust in God. &gt;&gt; And I think that's what Abraham was able to manifest. Amen. There when he obeyed the Lord, he had a trust and a confidence in this perfect God and this amazing God. And he had such reverence and honor that he could trust him. Amen. The same thing in a in a woman for her husband can have the same kind of reverence. So I took for a title tonight the reverential trust. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we want to look at that as the fear of the Lord. Uh I want to look at this scripture as we begin and then I I'll start to explain. Hebrews chapter 6 verse 13. It says, "For when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself." &gt;&gt; That's how sure this promise is. God swore by himself, &gt;&gt; saying, "Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee." And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. For men verilely swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. Wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutil immut immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us. Amen. This is a wordy. &gt;&gt; Does anybody agree? &gt;&gt; Okay. I hope it wasn't just me. I hope you're not all like perfectly sens sensible to me, Chad. What's wrong with you? But I want to break it down just a little bit. He says, "Men, when they make an oath, what they they they swear by the greater, right? And but God could swear and by none greater or nothing else, so he swore by himself." Amen. So he could cons he he secured the promise by his own reputation. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so uh uh he promised this to Abraham that surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee. And he secured this promise by his own nature by his own self, his own person. And and after Abraham had patiently and dirty obtained the promise for men verilely swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of strife. That means an end of striving, an end of trying, an end of pressing. There's an oath of confirmation. God made the promise and he based it upon himself. And he said, "So Abraham's striving was over and he ever was over. It's confirmed. It's sealed. It's done. You've got it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise. So this is not just for Abraham also, it's for the heirs of the promise. Who's the heir of the promise? I'm an heir of the promise. &gt;&gt; So he wanted to show the heirs of the promise the immobility of his counsel. Immability means unchanging. It cannot change. It cannot under any circumstances change for no reason. &gt;&gt; That's imu immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie. So this word counsel, amen, means God's counsel or his will or you could say his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so the immobility of his purpose. Amen. God, listen, brother Benham, when he goes to the seventh seal of Christ is the mystery of God revealed. He says God had one purpose in the whole Bible. The mystery in the back part of God's mind was God's purpose. Amen. And everything that's been revealed to us and everything we understand and all the doctrines that have been tied together was to show us one thing. God's great purpose. Why did God do all of this? Why did God to begin to bring forth from himself in creation? Why did the logos come out? Then after that, why did the heavenly host? Then after that, why creation on the earth? Why did he put man? All of this was God's purpose. And it's a the immutability of his purpose. Nothing will stop or defeat God's purpose. God had a purpose in it all. in all of it and nothing's going to stop the immut immutability of his purpose. And that's what the seventh seal has brought us back in contact with is God's original purpose. And God's original purpose was to become a family. All of his attributes made in the flesh upon the earth with fellowship one amongst another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. &gt;&gt; So God willing to show unto the heirs of promise us the the the immobility of his purpose confirmed it by an oath by his word &gt;&gt; that by two immutable things. This is number one and this is number two. By two immutable things. His purpose and his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see the two immutable things? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; His counsel and his oath. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That by two immutable things, his purpose can't change and his word cannot change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; By two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie. that we not Abraham we &gt;&gt; might have strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope that is set before us &gt;&gt; and that hope which enterth in beyond the veil is what it goes on to say amen so that's our hope and our purpose so so God when he made this promise amen to Abraham he made the promise because of his purpose amen the reason he called Abraham he didn't call Abraham because he felt sorry for Abraham he didn't call Abraham Because Abraham was somehow living a superior life to everybody else. He went and found Abraham because he had a purpose for Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that purpose was going to be performed. And then he confirmed the promise to Abraham because of his purpose. And because he had a purpose and he had a promise, he confirmed it with an oath. Amen. So that by these two immutable things, we understand that God's purpose cannot change and his word cannot change. And if he promised it to Abraham, it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and that so that he could show us the immobility of his counsel and that he we might have strong consolation so that we can rest because God purposed it and he promised it and nothing's going to stop it to the heirs of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is us. &gt;&gt; So we're included in this. &gt;&gt; And I say that for this for this next reason. Brother Benham said, "Now we find that his royal seed is travels the same journey. That's bride of Christ travels the same journey that Abraham did." And so brother Benam is showing us in Abraham's life and he's typing Abraham's life and his journey through life with the with the journey of the bride. And we know this because he shows us the plains of memory. The plains of memory is when God comes down in flesh. Amen. And he discerns Sarah's heart and the tent behind him and a time to confirm the promise. And and brother Bam shows that that happens in the day that the prophets here. He said he said God is using my body. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. God just stepped into a temporary body on the plains of memory to come down to confirm the promise. Amen. With his back turned to the tent, discern Sarah's heart. And the prophet of God showed us the exact same thing that God temporarily stepped into a body. With his back turned to the crowd, discern the hearts of the people. He's showing us we're walking the same journey Abraham's walking. Abraham, amen, is a type of the believer. The promise was to Abraham and to his seed. And he said that seed was one, not many. And that seed was Christ. &gt;&gt; So everybody is part of Christ is part of this promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the bride, bride of Christ travels the same journey that Abraham did. So, now that we've been in Genesis 22, when God was going to test Abraham and that Abraham passed the test and that God was so pleased with him, he says, "Now I know that thou fearest me. I want to go back and follow Abraham's journey with all of this in inside." Okay? And we're going to do it quickly. It's not going to take long. Praise God. I don't think Amen. &gt;&gt; You guys didn't say amen. That means you didn't believe it or agree with it or something. I'm going to have to start doing a better job. Genesis 12. Let's turn there together. I just want to note and remind ourselves that God knew Abraham before he chose him. before he called him. I mean, God knew Abraham. &gt;&gt; Before Abraham's first encounter with God, God knew Abram. &gt;&gt; He knew what he would do with him. He knew what his purpose was for him. He knew the promise he would give him. He knew what he was going to accomplish in his life. &gt;&gt; But God God works with Abraham to get Abraham to a certain point. &gt;&gt; And that's what I want us to see. God labored with Abraham. He was patient with Abraham. He built Abraham and brought Abraham to a place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every time Abraham messed up or didn't quite get the message right or didn't quite fulfill it right, God didn't cut him off and throw him away and start over. &gt;&gt; God was working with him. When we get here to chapter 12 verse 1, it says, "Now the Lord had said unto Abram, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, into a land that I will show thee, and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing, and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that cursth thee, and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed." God starts off with a promise to Abraham. In his first meeting with Abraham, he starts off with a promise. And he he first he gives him a c commandment. He said, "Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house and to a land that I will show thee." Amen. Then he then he confirms the promise and I will make of thee a great nation and a bless thee and I will do all of these things. But when we go back to the first line here in verse one, he says, "The Lord had said, you had said past tense." When we get to Genesis 1, he's referring to something he had said in the past. And that's important because if we back up and go to uh 11:31 31 it says, "And Tara took Abra Abraham his son and Lot the son of Heron his son's son and Sarai his daughter-in-law his son Abram&lt;unk&gt;'s wife and they went forth with them from of the Chaldes to go into the land of Canaan. And they came into Heron and dwelt there." And the days of Terara were 205 years. and Terara died in Heron. So when we look at this, Amen. Now Terara has died. The next thing he says, now the Lord had said, God had already told Abraham to get thee out of the country, out from that country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house into a land that I will show thee. And God was going to send him where? To Canaan land. Where was Terara on his way? To Canaan land. He had taken Abraham and he had taken Lot and he had taken them all from south Mesopotamia all the way down from southern Mesopotamia and he moved them all the way up to Heron which is all the way up to the top of Mesopotamia right over where you cross into Syria. It's on the edge of Syria actually part of Syria crossing down into Canaan land. Amen. This is where brother Brandham said God had told him to separate from his nation from his kindred. But he took his dad along. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; right. He took his dad along. Amen. No doubt there was maybe some conversation. He said, "Dad, I've got to go to Canaan land." I don't know what the conversation was like, but whatever it was like, Terara said, "Okay, son, let's go." But God didn't say, "Let's all go." He told Abraham, "I want you to separate," Amen. "From your country and from your kindred." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From your family. Amen. And God was calling him for total separation. But Abraham wasn't beginning with perfect obedience to total separation. He was going along with a group of family. Amen. They were separating from their country from all the other &gt;&gt; kindred but he was still there with dad and he was still there with Lot. &gt;&gt; Y amen. &gt;&gt; Then when Terara died. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we read here what God had already told Abraham. God had already told him. And so now when we come to verse four it says we go back to chapter 12:4. It says, "So Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him, and Lot went with him. And Abram was 70 and5 years old when he departed out of Heron. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Heron, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan. And unto the land of Canaan they came." And brother Ram makes this statement here in the message absolute. So the Bible said when this when it when his orbituary was written he said Abram Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God. Why did you ever think why he was absolute positive and the only thing he had to do was separate himself from his people and God never did bless him until he did. He took his daddy his daddy died. He took Lot. Then after Lot separated from Abraham, then God came to them and said, "Now walk through the land. See, obedience, promise under conditions always goes with God and his word." So, brother Ram is showing us that that that Abraham, although he believed the word of God, he believed the promise, he believed what God told him, he was in motion, he was moving over to Canaan. Amen. He wasn't fully obeying the word, &gt;&gt; but he believed it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Oh, I hope you can see yourself. I hope you can look back over your journey, seed of Abraham, and say, "Listen, I believe the word of God, but I didn't always obey it fully, and there was things I might have been confused about, and I didn't see it the way I see it now." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But God's been working with me all along. God's been leading me on the journey step by step. God's never forsaken me, and he never changed his mind about me. And there I look back now then, you know, I look back now over my journey of truth and I'm ashamed at some things I allowed and things I permitted and things that still hung on to me. But praise God, I never doubted that this message was true. I never doubted the word of promise that he gave to me. I may have been confused about and misunderstood parts and didn't fully obey. But praise God, he never gave up on me. The promise was for me. He knew what I would be and he knows what I'm going to be and he's willing to work with me to get me there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he Abraham didn't do exactly right, but Abraham believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We go over to Genesis 13 now verse 5. Go to chapter 13:5. And Lot also which went with Abram had flocks and herds and tents. Now we're still dealing with Lot. and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together. And there was a strife between the herdman Abram&lt;unk&gt;s cattle and the herdman of Lot's cattle. And the Canaanite and the parizzite dwelt in the then in the land. And Abram said unto Lot, "Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen, for we be brethren. Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If thou will take the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left. So now God, listen, God promised Abraham, and God's going to keep the promise. &gt;&gt; Abraham believes God's promise, but he's not in full obedience. There's either a misunderstanding or he has a lack of character at this point. There's something going on to where Abraham's not able to fully separate from his kindred. &gt;&gt; He's separated now from his nation, but he hasn't separated from his kindred. So God allows circumstances to build. &gt;&gt; Amen. Has God ever allowed circumstances to build in you to push you to more of his word? Oh, the grace of God, the abundant grace of God to allow the strife amongst the herdsmen to create tension. Amen. It's all bad. No, it's all good, friends. It's all been good. It all is good. It all will be good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the strife. And Abraham has to deal with the strife. And how is he going to deal with? He just says, "You know what, Lot? We're brethren. Let's have peace. You get to pick wherever you want to go. And wherever you want to go, I'll go the other way. Let's separate now for peace." &gt;&gt; So, we know what what Lot chooses, but but now there's a separation. And I just want you to see that God, Amen, never gave up on Abraham saying, "Well, he still got Lot with him. I'm going to go find somebody else." God knows how to deal with all circumstances in our life. &gt;&gt; He's, if you're heir of the promise, you're heir of the promise. He's not going to change. Who's heir of the promise? You are heir of the promise. So, he's going to work with you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so thankful God didn't leave me alone. I'm so thankful God didn't see me in my disobedience and in my error and in my confusion and say he ain't getting it. I'm going to go find somebody who will. But God made circumstances rise up in my life that caused me to wake up. Amen. And even if I don't fully wake up immediately, God works something in my life and later I come too. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, thank you, God. &gt;&gt; I didn't realize what that was hindering me. I didn't realize that was holding me back." Amen. So Abraham so kindly, Amen, gives him the first choice, the best choice. And brother Rem says, Abraham was changed. And look, when a man got God called Abraham and he and he told him he wanted him to separate himself from all of his unbelieving kindred. And when God calls a man to work for him, he calls you from total annihilation, from all the things of the world and the sins of the earth. Separation. God never did bless Abraham till he fully obeyed him. &gt;&gt; Amen. He took his father. The old man was always a hair in the soup or excuse that expression. But he was always wrong. And Abraham and then he got Lot. And then he finally went down there. And after Lot separated himself, then God said to Abraham, "Rise and walk through the land. I've give it all to you. It's all yours." See? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He never fully blessed him till Abraham fully obeyed. And you'll never be able to get anything from God and have favor with God, my brothers and sisters, wherever you are, until we fully obey the word of God. You make yourself miserable by just half-heartedly approaching it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, that was a good statement. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We make you make yourself miserable by just halfhearted approaching it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it doesn't work out. And and things don't work out and and why isn't it working out? and and we don't understand, but we become miserable ourselves because we don't just throw ourselves all the way into the word and just give everything for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; After he separated, let's look at verse 14, chapter 13:14. And the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated from him, "Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where there are northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward. For all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever. and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. Arise, walk through the land in the length of it, and in the breadth of it, for I will give it unto thee. Before this point, God had said, "I'm going to give you a land. I'm going to make you a nation, and all the nations of the earth are going to be blessed in you. I'm going to make you a people." Amen. But that's the farthest his revelation went until God brought him to another level of separation. And when he came to another level of separation from unbelief. Amen. Then all of a sudden said God says now, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to show you something else. &gt;&gt; Not a new word, not a new promise. This is the same word, the same promise, a greater revelation, a further unveiling of the same promise. He said, "Now look to the north and to the from where you are right now." Where was he right now? He was in total separation from unbelief. Amen. And he had come to he had come to fully obey the first commandment. And how did he get to that point? Listen, it wasn't his own strength. It wasn't his own willpower. It wasn't his own might. God helped him get there. &gt;&gt; Because God knew what was in him. And God needed him there. &gt;&gt; And God couldn't give him another revelation until he come to this point. So something was hindered in Abraham's walk and in Abraham's life. He was the recipient of the promise. Amen. The promise rested upon him. He was in the land in Canaan land, but he didn't know which portion was his. He didn't know how much was his. He just know he's giving him a country and he's walking around all over the place that's his, &gt;&gt; but he doesn't yet know because he doesn't know the further unfolding of the prophecy. And then all of a sudden, when God, amen, allows circumstances and circumstances wrought their purpose. And in the purpose, amen. He so willingly separates from Lot and gives Lot the best of everything. Now, as soon as Lot separates, he says, "Now look around. It's all yours. As far as you can see this way, as far that way and to the east and to the west, it's all yours. Now rise up and walk in it, for I've given it all to you." &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. He will never fully bless until Abraham fully obeyed. Abraham needed help getting there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've needed help getting there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've needed some help getting there. &gt;&gt; I believed his word. Love God with all my heart, but certain things were were were either blind spots or trappings or things that were so hooked into me I didn't realize what they were doing to me. But God in his great mercy allowed circumstances to rise up that would force a level of separation from something of the world world or or whatever that it might be. But after the separation comes, amen, it was God's mercy and grace to allow the strife, to allow the tension, to allow the problem, to allow the sickness, to allow the layoff, to allow whatever it was that happened to us. It was the grace of God. And then in separation, amen, all of a sudden God says, "Now look, Amen. There's more that I want to show you about what you already know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, God's so good. But then when brother Benham says, uh, you'll never be able to get anything from God until we fully obey the word of God. I'm so glad God is helping with this. Hallelujah. If &gt;&gt; this was just left to us only, friends, you know, I I would like for you to come to me tonight and explain to me where all your blind spots are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because if you can explain them to me, they're not blind spots. They're just complexes. They're just besetting sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we probably still have blind spots. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; So as God begins to reveal and God begins to speak through the preaching of the word, through the message, through circumstances in life, and we begin to separate and and move away and get rid of these things or let them fall away from us or separate from us or whatever, then we're coming into a greater obedience all the time. And we're doing so with joy. And we're doing so willingly. When Abraham finally got to it, he was willing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was willing. very willing. Willing. So much willing he would take the worst property, the worst land, the worst grazing ground. And and and and Lot took the best. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But by the time separation came, he was so willing for separation. He was willing to sacrifice the better of the land. He was willing to sacrifice himself to have this separation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he would take the he would take the low end. He would take the bad end of the deal and give Lot the best end of the deal. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then God blessed him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Abraham came to this place of separation, he made himself vulnerable. He come to a place where he said you take whichever place you want. And when he says you take the place you want, it left Abraham vulnerable &gt;&gt; because Abraham was going to get whatever was left over. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said that Lot looked to the land of Sodom and Gomorrah because it was well watered. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the reason they had strife is because of all their herds and all their cattle and everything that needed to graze. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the problem was over grazing land. And what did Lot take? Lot took the best grazing land. What did he leave Abraham for? Brother Bam said he left Abraham back up in the rocky land where his cattle were starving to death. Oh, I love it when God gets us to the place where we're willing to make ourselves vulnerable for separation. &gt;&gt; I'll take the worst. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If I have to give up the job, God, I'll give up the job. &gt;&gt; I'll take the lower job to be in church instead of the higher job and be separated from your promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll take the low land. I'll take the rocky land. I'll take whatever. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just so I can have Amen. so I can be in the right position, in the right place, and do the right thing. &gt;&gt; I love it when God finally gets us to us where we're willing to sacrifice ourselves. When we're willing to lay it down, when we're not fighting for the best, and we're not fighting to be first, and we're not fighting for self-p protection. We're not fighting for self-promotion, but we're willing to separate from whatever so that we can stay in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, God knows how to get us there, friends. But he knows what's in us. And he knows when we get there, we'll say, "Yes, Lord. That's what I want. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you make yourself miserable by just half-heartedly approaching it. What a statement, friends. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is true today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is true every day. Just whether we're in or out, half this, half that, committed, not committed. Listen, we make ourselves miserable by a halfheartedly approach to it. &gt;&gt; When God did things in the kingdom of God, he needed people who gave all. Amen. Last Wednesday we were speaking about three different women. We talked about Ruth, we talked about Tamar, and we talked about Mary. When we look at Ruth, Ruth, I want to read here from Ruth chapter 3 verse 6. And she went down into the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her. And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn. And she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down. And it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid, and he turned himself, and behold, a woman lay at his feet. And he said, "Who art thou?" And she said, "I am Ruth, thine handmmaid. Spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmmaid, for thou art a near kinsman." We've talked about this before, but I want to bring it to your attention again. When Ruth went that day, she prepared herself according to the way Naomi said. She dressed herself, bathed herself, prepared herself, and she knew what she was going to do. And what she was going to do was put herself in a very risky position. She was going to go in a way that seemed really terrible and risky. She was going to offer herself to a man. And she was going to she was going to offer herself to this man for redemption, for redemptive purposes because this man was the kinsman redeemer. And when she went, you know, in the morning, he said, "Go out while it's yet early." So nobody knows a woman was at the threshing floor. She shouldn't have been there. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? She's dressed. She's prepared. Boaz is Mary. He makes himself merry. He lays down at the heap of corn. And there's a moment, if I could just dramatize it, there's a moment in time where she's waiting for Boaz to fall asleep. She's waiting for his breath to get heavy. She's in between time. She's here. She's at the point of decision. She's heard what Naomi said. We need redemption. There's no other option. I can give myself to this man. She doesn't know what Boaz will say. She only knows what the law is of kinsman redeemer. She knows who she is in this whole program. What Naomi's told her. And she knows who Boaz is, but she doesn't know how Boaz will react to her. And she gets to this place where she comes to the point of all or nothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. You don't do this half-heartedly. &gt;&gt; You don't bump into him at the dinner when everybody's gathered around say, "Hey, you know, what do you think? Um, can we be friends?" &gt;&gt; There's no halfway to do this, friend. There comes a time in Ruth and Ruth's life. There comes a moment in time where now she's waited long enough. It sounds like he's asleep. Everybody else has fallen asleep. It's now or never. But when she goes into that place she's not supposed to be and the privacy of the hidden inner chamber and she uncovers his feet and she lays down at his feet. Listen, she's in the hands of Boaz from that moment on. She has to trust in the integrity of the kinsman redeemer because there's no turning back from this point. If he wakes up and sounds the alarm and why are you here? Everybody come here. They're going to take her out and stone her as an unrighteous, unholy woman, unworthy &gt;&gt; because of what she was trying to do. &gt;&gt; So Ruth can't do this half-heartedly. When she gives herself to Boaz, it's all or nothing. And now she's dependent on the integrity of somebody else, which is Boaz. She had enough experience with him and knows who he is in the community and seen his character. She must have some confidence in Boaz and his position as kenan redeemer or she would never be able to throw herself at his feet not knowing what the outcome would be. &gt;&gt; Listen, this is what Christ is looking for. Do you know enough about him? He's our kinsman redeemer. Have you seen his character enough that you can trust him with your life, with your reputation, with your honor, with everything you've got? She's giving up her honor, her reputation. He says, "All the villages know you're a virtuous woman." If he says the wrong thing at that moment, they'll all know she's not a virtuous woman. She's worked hard to uphold her reputation. She's been faithful to Naomi. She's kept her integrity, and she's giving it all to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the only way to serve God, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the only way to come to this message. You don't come halfway. This message is Christ. This is the headship. This is the bridegroom looking for a bride to marry. You don't come with one foot in, one foot out, waiting for something to go wrong. You This is all or nothing, friends. &gt;&gt; This is either the fullness of redemption or it's not. It's either truth or it's not. We don't come halfway. But I've seen enough of the integrity of Christ in this message to know I can trust the kinsman redeemer. I can lay myself down at his feet and he's the one who's got to guard my reputation and declare me virtuous and get give me my honor. &gt;&gt; I can't do it for myself anymore. I've given myself away to a kinsman redeemer. Now I trust him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Tamar, amen, put on the the veil and the and the clothes of harlotry and she went to do what she felt like she needed to do for redemption for the seed line. Amen. She went to play the harlot with Judah. You realize she come to a point of no turning back. &gt;&gt; She come to a place when she made up her mind and made her decision. That was not a halfhearted decision. There's no way to do that half-heartedly. &gt;&gt; You can't do that halfway. That was a fullon 100% commitment. I'm going all the way. This is the only hope for me. This is the only chance that I've got. If it's not this, then I'll be left destitute and I've got a right &gt;&gt; to that seed line. &gt;&gt; She went. Amen. She did what she had to do. She asked for the tokens that she asked for. Amen. But when it came time for judgment to be passed three months later, word had come. She's a harlot. She's going to be stoned. Judah pronounces judgment. Bring her here and burn her. &gt;&gt; I mean, she comes to Judah. Listen, all she does is lay out the tokens. &gt;&gt; She doesn't argue. She doesn't persuade. She doesn't beg. She doesn't do anything. &gt;&gt; She said, "I'm pregnant by the man who owns these. You discern whose these are." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Basically saying, "You decide whether I'm righteous or not." &gt;&gt; She had to trust in Judah to be a righteous judge. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because if Judah protected himself and he covered it up and he lied, she was being burnt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But Judah is the judging tribe. Judah is the king tribe. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is the lion of the tribe of Judah, the judge, the righteous judge. And here I in the story of Ruth, Boaz is playing the part of Christ. &gt;&gt; In the judges here, Judah is playing the part of Christ as the judge to judge righteously. Amen. And he looks at the tokens and he realizes, amen, this woman is more righteous than I. And he declares her virtuous. He declares her sinless. He declares her right. Amen. Why? She came. What? What was her s salvation? She came to the point of no return. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the way I believe this message, friends. It's the point of no return. There is no halfway believing the truth. Amen. Brother BM's a prophet. He's right about this, but he's wrong about this. and he got some of these dogs right, but I don't understand about that and I'll still take my own idea on these things and I want to mix it with what I feel about that. Hey, that's going to make you miserable. &gt;&gt; But if we come to this message, we got to come like Ruth coming to Boaz and we got to come like Tamar giving herself completely up. Amen. Her reputation and everything giving it completely up for redemption, for the right to receive the seed from the seedgiver himself. &gt;&gt; Thank you. trusting in his character, not mine. &gt;&gt; Trusting in the character of Boaz, trusting in the character of Judah, and now I trust in the character of Christ, who is the messenger, who is the bridegroom, who is the headship, who is the word that's been restored. I've seen enough to know he's trustworthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. So important, friends. Mary was the third we looked at. Mary said, "Behold, the handmade of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word." And the angel departed from her. Mary, when she receives conception, it's the point of no return. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How do you on all three of these women? How do you back up from this? &gt;&gt; How do you explain it away? &gt;&gt; Hey, it's a one-way street, friends. and coming to Christ for me is a one-way street. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God was looking for Abraham to keep moving into the promise and separate and move and separate and move. I'm going to go back to this quote here. He says, "Now, as we notice going just a little further, we find that when Abraham had separated himself from Lot, and I want you to notice the Christian act in Abraham, he said, Lot, you take the choice." Lot being backsliden in his heart, he looked, he took the well-watered plains of Sodom and Gomorrah. But Abraham had to take the poor. He had to take the barren ground. He was satisfied. No matter what his estate was, he was satisfied that God was with him. &gt;&gt; Oh my f my friends, my friends. No matter what his estate was, he was satisfied with God. I am an heir of Abraham. I'm Abraham's seed. I'm part of this promise and I'm satisfied. If I've got to miss out on the promotion, if I've got to miss out on the extra this or the inh the the reputation of that, if I've got to miss out on something, I am satisfied in my estate because I am satisfied that God is with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'd rather have him than have all the gold in the world. I'd rather have him than have the best reputation. Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember there was a I was reading the biography of Charles Spurgeon. I was just telling my wife this yesterday. Charles Spurgeon. Amen. He was a young preacher. He was converted at 7 or 15, started preaching at 17. By 19, he was the pastor of a of a large congregation in in the metropolitan area of London. And he got notoriety and fame. He had a booming voice. He he he he was a gifted preacher and he started getting popular and people started moving in. And when he did, jealousy creeped up and all of a sudden the the the newspaper started a smear campaign against him and the cartoonist started drawing very unflattering pictures of him with captions and articles that really spoke evil of him, right? &gt;&gt; And and Spurgeon went through this time of great depression. He was rattled when all of this stuff happened and and the papers were writing this and they were smearing him and other ministers were saying things to him. And in the biography, I he got to this place and it really moved me. It touched me in depression and agony. He was praying and praying day after day. He couldn't understand why they were doing this to him and what it all meant. And he made this statement is something like this. It's not an exact quote, but something like, "God, the most precious thing I have to me is my reputation." And he said, "It's the only thing I have that is mine alone." Think about that. It's the only thing I have that is mine alone. His reputation and his reputation he had earned. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What he would think is his good reputation. The reputation he wanted to honor and uphold. And you don't share your reputation with anybody else. &gt;&gt; He's the only thing I have that's mine alone. He said, "But God, if you want it, I give it to you &gt;&gt; for Christ's sake." &gt;&gt; And he was willing to go right back. His depression ended. He came out of it. He went right back and kept preaching like he always preached. And they kept the smear campaign. And they kept all the evil. And they did all the things that they did before, but he kept on preaching and hammering away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes the separation we have to go through is not people, is not jobs, is not physical. Sometimes the separation we have to go through is our own reputation. &gt;&gt; What people think of us and how they view us and what they say about us or how we want to be viewed ourselves. We need to separate from that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And unify with Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and all three of those situations we talked about with those women, they were willing to give up their reputation and what people thought of them and risk it all to be a further part of the word. And are we willing to do the same thing? Let's go to Genesis 17. We're going to keep picking up the story and following Abraham through Genesis 17 and we're going to go to verse 18. And I want you to see something here. And Abraham said unto God, "Oh, that Ishmael might live before thee." And God said, Sarah, thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed, and shall and thou shalt call his name Isaac, and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him. And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee, behold, I have blessed him, and will make him a fruit, will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. 12 princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. So I I read that because I wanted you to see how dear Ishmael is to Abraham. When we talk about Ishmael, we talk about him as a renegade, as a problem maker for Isaac, for the fighting between the seed. But that's not how Abraham viewed him. Right. &gt;&gt; This was Abraham's son through Hagar. And Abraham had raised him to this point. He was 12 or 13 at this point. And Abraham loved him. And no doubt they spent a great deal of time together. And he had affection for for Ishmael. And Ishmael was his son. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Carrying his genetics, maybe some of his likeness. Amen. Maybe some of his characteristics. And he loved him dearly. And when God come to confirm the promise to him that he was going to have a son by Sarah, he said, "Oh, that Ishmael might live before thee. Oh, God, could you spare Ishmael, too?" And God says, "It's going to be Isaac." &gt;&gt; Clearly, it's going to be Isaac, but don't worry about Ishmael. I will bless him, too, because he's your seed. I'll make a nation out of him, and 12 princes shall come out of him. But my promise is going with Isaac. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, we see the love that that Abraham has for Ishmael. Cuz I don't like to read the Bible and go through these things and and miss how important certain things are and miss the relationship and the love Abraham had for Ishmael. We all look at Ishmael and kind of smile when we think of Ishmael. That is not what Abraham thought of Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They got they had morning breakfast together. They did chores together. Ishmael sat on his knee. He told him stories. He told him about Jehovah. He sowed into him good things because he wanted him he wanted him to carry on. He wanted him to to be saved. We could say he wanted him to love God. He wanted to put into him all these good characteristics. He wanted to set him up. He wanted him to be blessed. He was proud of him. He laughed at his jokes. He was proud of him when he won the foot race against the servants. This is what Abraham thought of Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like you would &gt;&gt; if you had a son. Genesis 21. Let's read from verse 9. Genesis chapter 21 and verse 9. And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne unto Abraham, mocking. Wherefore she said unto Abraham, cast out this bond woman and her son, for the son of the bond woman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac. And the thing was very grievious in Abraham's sight because of his son. Do you feel Abraham's pain? &gt;&gt; Do you see why it would be very grievious in his sight? And God said unto Abraham, "Let it not be grievious in thy sight because of the lad and because of the bond woman." And all that Sarah has said unto thee, hearken unto her voice, for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. And also of the son of the bond woman will I make a nation because he is thy seed. And Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away. And she departed wandering in the wilderness of Beersa. We thought separation from Lot was hard. when he separated from Lot and he just couldn't bear the thought after Tara died, his dad died. Now Lot doesn't have anybody because Lot's dad was already dead, which was Abraham's brother. He had already died. So Tara had taken Lot under wing. Now Tara, which would have been Lot's grandpa, now he dies. So Abraham has a feeling for Lot and he takes Lot along and he can't bear the thought of leaving Lot behind and all the things they go through and finally God works the circumstances where he has to separate from Lot and then God confirms the promise. But you think God surely wouldn't ask for more. &gt;&gt; Surely God wouldn't ask for more separation. &gt;&gt; Surely not. Surely that was enough. But sure enough God had a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. God had a plan and God had a promise and God had his word. &gt;&gt; And now he asked Abraham to send Ishmael away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Ishmael takes the bond woman, takes the lad, takes Ishmael, he would have been 13 approximately at this age, and he gives him bread and a bottle of water and sends them away. And can you imagine what was happening in his heart when they walked away? didn't know what would happen to him. Didn't know. And you say, "Surely God wouldn't ask for more separation." And the answer says is, "If it serves his immutable purpose, &gt;&gt; he will." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He told Abraham because he knows Abraham's love for the boy. And God was good to Abraham. God didn't know Ishmael anything. But because of Abraham, he says, "I'll make a nation out of him." And God protected him when he's at the point of death, the angel of the Lord heard his prayer. And because of the the prayer of the Lad, not the bond woman's prayer, but the prayer of the lad. He saved him and built him up and he became a nation and 12 princes. And he got all that God promised he would have. That's God's mercy and goodness because of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Abraham loved Lot. That's why that's why God went and sent a rescue mission in the into Sodom and brought him out by the hand. When Lot delayed, he took him by the hand, the angel did, and brought him away. Not because of Lot. Because the Bible said God remembered Abraham and brought Lot out of Sodom. He didn't do it for Lot. He did it for Abraham because Abraham loved Lot. Listen, God is not unfaithful. He may ask for separation. We may separate from family. We may separate from friends, but don't stop loving them and interceding for them because Abraham never stopped interceding for them. Your love for them may mean their salvation. &gt;&gt; So don't think God is hard-hearted. He's not. God's loving and tender and merciful. God didn't know Lot anything and he didn't know anything to Ishmael. But he did it because of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So keep loving the ones you love and keep interceding for the ones you love. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is kind. God is good. God is just. But God has a purpose. And his purpose is immutable. And his purpose is perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all things work together for good. And we have to believe that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God had asked Moses or Abraham, I'm sorry, asked Abraham to send Ishmael away. And you think, my how how much could one person suffer? And that's only one side of the equation because we're not seeing what God wants to do for Abraham. &gt;&gt; All of this is because God wants to confirm the promise. God wants to bring forth the promise. God wants to manifest the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's doing great things through Abraham. But it's going to take total separation from all unbelief. And so he sends him away and and let's go to uh now let's go to chapter 22. Let's go back where we started. All of these things happen. He he has to separate from his home country and his kindred and he goes and then he is separate from his father. God takes him in death. Then he goes with Lot. Then he has to separate from Lot because of the circumstances. And then circumstances rise in his own house between Sarah and between the bond woman and between the seed of Sarah and the seed of the bond woman. He's mocking and her strife. And Sarah's upset. And now all the circumstances in his home press him into a position. And in the press, God confirms to him that send Ishmael away. And and and he sends Ishmael away. And after all of these things, you say, Abraham's done good. We come to chapter 22. And it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him,"Abraham," and he said, "Behold, here I am. Here I am." And he said, "Take now thy son, thine own thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Mariah, and offer him therefore a burnt offering upon one of the mountains, which I will tell thee of." &gt;&gt; Amen. He had already separated from his father, from Lot, from Ishmael, and now Isaac. &gt;&gt; And now Isaac. &gt;&gt; I believe all of that was God's training, &gt;&gt; working with Abraham, bringing and developing Abraham, bringing faith in Abraham, character in Abraham, a willingness in Abraham to obey the word of God. Because as Abraham moves on his journey, you see the testing gets harder, but the obedience becomes more deliberate, more instant. God is working with Abraham because Abraham's the recipient of the promise, but God needs him to get to a place of total obedience and total surrender so that God can perform his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it says, "Now, I want you to think of this. After all that Abraham's been through, it looked like a lot, but it was all training. And the training all came to this point. It came to pass after these things. God tempted him. Now he said, "Take thy son Isaac, thy only son Isaac, whom thou lovest." It's amazing how the scripture added this &gt;&gt; for emphasis. Whom thou lovest. You could just, we could take that as it being inferred, but no, God stated it clearly. whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Mariah, and offer him therefore a burnt offering upon one of the mountains, which I will tell thee of. Now look at verse three. It's the most astounding verse in all, one of the most astounding in all the Bible to me. And Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass. No conversation, no delay, no questions, nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not a but God. But every other time it was a delay in action. It was but Lot, you know, and Lot my this and this and I take him along and I can't just leave him abandoned. He's an orphan. And and then then there's Ishmael, but God that Ishmael might live before they know my promises with Isaac. I'll do something good for Ishmael, but it's Isaac. And then the strife comes and Sarah says, "Send him away." But God, oh, it grieves him terribly. And God says, "Don't be grieved because of the lad." Amen. send him away. And there's always this back and forth. There's always this inward struggle. There's always this questioning God delay in response, delay in action until God finally gets Abraham to a place through the training that he trained Abraham. Abraham learns to respond to the voice of God because there's nothing better than responding to the voice of God. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what we think. It doesn't matter how we feel. We can feel. It's good to feel. We can have thoughts. That's fine. We have thoughts. Amen. But Abraham got to the place of obedience. And that's where God wants to get us to where we see the word, we say amen to the word, regardless of the consequences. &gt;&gt; I just can't imagine coming to a place where God tells him, "Now, you sent one son away. So your your c your your cousin's gone. Lot's gone. Your nephew's gone. Your dad's gone. Everybody's gone. You separated from everything. Now, this son that's so dear to you that you love, I want you to offer that son to me. And he wakes up in the morning with no rebuttal, no conversation, no butts, nothing. &gt;&gt; And he loads up the car. &gt;&gt; Let's go, son. &gt;&gt; God, help me get to this place. &gt;&gt; This is the destination for the bride. I believe this with all my heart. Brother Bham said, we're following in the journey of Abraham. This is where we're coming to, friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Abraham rose up early in the morning, saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him. And Isaac his son, and claved the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went into the place of which God had told him. Then on the third day, Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place a far off. And Abraham said unto his young men, "Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you." Yeah, &gt;&gt; we know why he says this because he's got faith that God's going to raise him up. &gt;&gt; He doesn't know what's going to happen. He doesn't know how it's going to happen. But he's seen God confirm this promise over and over in every way. God can't lie. He's immutable in his purpose and he's immutable in his oath. &gt;&gt; God said Isaac and he moved everything away. I tried it this way. Didn't work. Separate all this. But Isaac, it's going to be because God said it's going to be Isaac. And I don't care if he has to raise him from the dead. He's coming back. We're going to go and we're going to come back. There was in my in my opinion, there was no doubt in Abraham's mind that he was going to slay his son. &gt;&gt; Not a not a doubt, not an inkling of doubt. He claved the wood. &gt;&gt; He took the knife. &gt;&gt; He bundled the sticks. He was going to slay him and he was going to burn him. Amen. But one thing Abraham had come to terms with in his life and come to an absolute perfect faith and if God said it, it will be. And he said, "My seed will be in Isaac, and in Isaac will my seed be. There's no other option. It's going to be Isaac. I don't know how God's going to do it. I don't know what way he's going to perform it, but Isaac's going to live again." &gt;&gt; And he told him, "We're going to worship and come again." Come again. Who? We, the we who go, the we who come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son. And he took the fire in his hand and a knife, and they went both of them together. Friends, this is the point of no return. &gt;&gt; He's going all the way with the word, trusting in the integrity of the one who gave him the promise that he'll keep the promise. And he doesn't have to understand why God is doing this, why God is asking this. He doesn't need to have those questions answered. All he needs to know is that God promised it and he cannot lie. &gt;&gt; And Isaac spoken to Abraham his father. He said, "My father." And he said, "Here am I, my son." And he said, "Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?" Now listen carefully, friends. And Abraham said, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering." &gt;&gt; So they went both of them together. Who had provided Isaac? God. &gt;&gt; Who had promised it'd be Isaac? God. Who had to restore Isaac? God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't know. &gt;&gt; He didn't know what was going to happen. He didn't know how it was going to happen. He knew one thing. God made the promise. So God's going to have to provide for himself. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he's going to provide himself a lamb because God said it's going to be Isaac, but he told me to slay Isaac. I'm not here to figure out which is right and which is wrong. I'm only here to obey and believe and I don't care how it's going to happen. But it's up to God now for a son. God's going to have to provide himself a lamb &gt;&gt; for a burnt offering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's exactly what God did. He provided himself in Jesus Christ as the lamb for the burnt offering. Why? Because of the immutability of his purpose that he would have a race of himself on this earth and fellowship together. Because of that, he provided himself a lamb for a burnt offering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had to because his purpose is immutable. He has to have his children on this earth and fellowship together. &gt;&gt; So what did he do? He provided himself a lamb. &gt;&gt; He became Isaac. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't know all of that at this point. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He just knows he's going to obey. &gt;&gt; And they went both of them together. Verse 9. And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said,"Abraham, Abraham." And he said, "Here am I." And he said, "Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do now neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearest God, seeing that thou hast withheld thy son, thine only son from me." Oh, God stops him dead in his tracks. Said, "Stop." Amen. Stop. Now I know thou fears me. And you get in this language. You get in this description from God that God is so super pleased with this. At no point did Abraham back down. At no point did he back out. At no point did he come up with a compromise. That's what they did with Hagar. Amen. That's what he did with Lot. That's what he did with his dad. But he finally comes to the place he's not fixing a workaround. He's not compromising. He's not playing with the promise or the word of God. He's just taking it straight down the middle as it was. And this was the hardest commandment of them all. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But God had grown him into a position of faith through all the experience he's had and got him to this place where when he said, "Take thy son." He woke up in the morning, he packed a car, he took his son, and they were off without further discussion. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's where we're coming to, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ben makes this statement. The comforter said that old Job said this time, "Though he slay me, yet I'll trust him." He's anchored in the word. He knowed what the word said and that was his comfort. That was his faith to receive him, to hold him. And Abraham knew that he was gone. So of his son, he was dead. Sarah's wound was dead. His manhood was dead. And yet God give him this boy because that he promised him that. And if the same one that promised him that told him to sacrifice the son, he knowed that God was able to raise him from the dead. Everything he was telling me, oh, I'm sorry, this is a different quote. He He was able to raise him from the dead. This comes from Hebrews. He knew that he was able to raise him from the dead because he received him from the dead. Abraham's life stream dried up. He was dead. Sarah's wound was dead. It was an impossibility. Everything was dead. But he received him as a figure from the dead. And if God could do that, what's raising a dead? What's raising a charred body back to life? Nothing to God. &gt;&gt; He could slay him, burn him, and sit back and wait for God to raise him up. &gt;&gt; Cuz God's word is immutable. His oath is immutable. His purpose is immutable. &gt;&gt; If God ever loved you, he always loved you. If God thought of you standing in flesh, amen, in the millennium in joint air with Jesus Christ, nothing's going to stop you from getting there. And who cares if you get sick here? Who cares if you die here? Who cares if you lose your wealth here? Who cares if you lose everything? That's my promise. And nothing will stop it. &gt;&gt; If I wind up, Amen. the only one who still believes this message. God, help me to hang on to this message because it's immutable. It's unmovable. It's the word of God. There will be a change of the body. There will be a millennial reign. There will be glorified sons and daughters of God in a millennium with him. They will be there. And I believe I'll be there. And so what what happens to me now? I've got a promise. &gt;&gt; It's immutable. His purpose about me is immutable. His oath to me is immutable. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter the circumstances, highs, lows, good, bad, success, failure, health, sickness. What does it change the word of God and the purpose of God? Nothing. &gt;&gt; I loved when we were at the retreat. Amen. And and and brother Daniel White said, he said, "If it's 2,000 years from now, somebody will be preaching the message. &gt;&gt; We'll still be believing it because it's still every word the truth. It doesn't matter if it happens the way we think or some way we didn't think. If we understand or don't understand, I don't have to understand. I only have to believe." And the immutability of his purpose. &gt;&gt; And that's what God revealed through the seventh seal. His purpose. One purpose, one goal, one thing God wanted to achieve. &gt;&gt; Oh, God be praised. &gt;&gt; I want to share one quote with you as we finish. This is when brother Ben's staying at the hospital bed where his baby girl is dying. Said, "Everything was telling me was the truth. Satan was speaking to him. Everything that he would say just fall right in line. say here I was just then about ready to say then that's the way he has to act and I won't serve him just as I said that there was something came from somewhere else way down on the inside said who are you to begin with the Lord gave and the Lord taken away &gt;&gt; see that's the inside man don't reason at all &gt;&gt; I looked back and I thought how did I get on earth I come from a bunch of drunkers how did I get there who gave me life who gave Give me that wife who give me that baby. Listen, brother Brandham is going through the same inward conversation that Job went through when God came down and spoke to him. He said, "Gird up thy loins like a man I'm going to talk to you. Who do you think you are? Who created the earth? Who are you giving counsel to? Who are you giving advice to? Who are you going to ask questions to, Job?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who are you going to ask if we're doing right or wrong? I mean, who set the bounds of the heavens? Amen. Who put the heavens in place? Who put the earth in its place? Who set the bounds of the sea? who created all these things? And Job, you know what Job said? I spoke once, I'll never speak again. I spoke twice. I'll put my hand over my mouth lest I should speak again. &gt;&gt; He learned who he's talking to. Now, brother Benham gets in the same spot. And he starts going to the same thing. Who am I anyways? &gt;&gt; Who gave me that wife? So, what am I to say he was wrong for taking my wife away? He gave me the wife. He has every right to take her away. Who gave me the baby? He gave me the baby. He's got every right to take it away. And brother Bam starts to come back into the right frame of mind. &gt;&gt; Where did my wife come from? Where did my life come from? I said, "Though he slay me, yet I'll trust him." He goes right to where Job went. &gt;&gt; I said, "Get away from me, Satan." I laid my hand over on the baby. I said, "Sharon, honey, I'll lay you on your mother's arms in a few minutes when the angels of God come to take you away. But one day, Daddy will see you again. I don't know how it's going to be, honey. I can't tell you how when he turns his back upon me won't even hear for you. He let my wife die. Me holding her by the hands crying for her. My daddy in his arms died on his arm right there looking up at me trying to get his breath. And I prayed as hard as I could. How could I face the public again to preach divine healing? How could I preach he was a good God and let my daddy die a sinner? How could I preach that? I don't know how, but I know he's right. &gt;&gt; The word of God shall never fail. It'll triumph. No matter what that is, then I know there was something inside of all reasoning, something inside of all emotions, everything else like that. There was a inside man that held in that hour. Nothing else could have done it. Every reason, everything could be showed. Everything could prove that I was wrong and I was in the wrong. But the word of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world held on the inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad it held on the inside, friends. I'm so glad God knows where his seed is and he knows what's in his seed and he knows what his seed is capable of. And I'm so glad God is working with us to bring that life to the forefront. &gt;&gt; God knows, amen, that that seed will keep with the word. He knows it won't forsake the word. He knows that word that that life inside of us is willing to separate. It's the predestinated seed word from before the foundation of the world. It will come to obedience to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you look at Mary, I want to we looked at Abraham's journey and we see where he got to in this last temptation. To me, it was such a strong temptation, but where God had brought him to, he passed with flying colors. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every other stage in the journey, there was this back and forth, this missteps. But when he got to this stage of the journey, he come to the place he said, "So be it. So be it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the way it'll be. He didn't doubt the promise. It didn't change what he believed about Isaac, but he just did what God said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You realize when Abraham got to this place, there was no external pressure. &gt;&gt; There was no strife between herdsmen. Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; God didn't take his dad away to make it easier for him to make the decision. &gt;&gt; God did that in his baby phase. Let's say, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; As he grew now, there was a strife between herdsmen that made it expedient for separation. God used the circumstances to help Abraham along. And even when he had to separate from Ishmael, Amen. There was strife within his home and tension within his home. But when he came to this place, there was zero external pressure. &gt;&gt; There was nothing pushing him to take this action. &gt;&gt; There was nothing demanding he take this action. There was nothing. There was nothing, no pressure. He was going to relieve by taking this action. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God didn't have to coersse him. God didn't have to push him. God didn't have to make him uncomfortable. God didn't have to do anything. By the time Abraham got here, all God had to do was speak and be quiet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; God help us. This is why when you read here when when the angel of the Lord says,"Abraham, Abraham," he watches Abraham. Amen. I don't know what was going through God's mind. I don't want to I I don't want to falsely portray it, but can you imagine? Amen. He's watched Abraham. He knows what's in Abraham. He knows what Abraham's capable of. He knows his immutable promise and and his purpose. Amen. He's watching Abraham and he's worked with him all these years. And finally, he says, "I'm going to test Abraham." The Lord tempted. &gt;&gt; The Lord did tempt Abraham. One more test, Abraham. I got another test for you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Take thy son, thy only son, the one that thy love. &gt;&gt; Take him to the place where I tell you, and and offer him as a burnt offering. and and God's omnipotent. God knows all things. So, there's no God waiting. But let's just say in the drama, God's waiting. I wonder what he'll say this time. And Abraham doesn't say anything. &gt;&gt; Abraham doesn't pray. &gt;&gt; Doesn't fast. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Doesn't ask for anything. Watches him as he wakes up in the morning. He wakes up in the morning. What's he doing? What's he doing? He's splitting wood. Can you imagine God as a father saying, "That's my boy." &gt;&gt; He's splitting. God knows what he's going to do. God's not nervous. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Splitting his wood. Look, he's packing the car. &gt;&gt; Look, he's got wood. Look, he he's Look, he's sharpened his knife. &gt;&gt; He believes me. &gt;&gt; He's got confidence in me. He's putting his trust fully in me. No coercion, no outside circumstances, no pressure. &gt;&gt; Just obedience to the simple commandment of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; He goes all the way through the motions, all the way to separation from the servants, all the way to Mount Mariah, all the way to binding his son, all the way to building building an altar, laying out the wood, tying up his son, laying his son down, unchaththing the knife, raising it up. The whole thing is proving that he believes God's word. He trusts in God. He put all his trust in God and none of his trust in himself. And just before he plunged a knife into his throat or his heart, the angel of the Lord says, "Stop. Stop. I can't take no more. Now I know you fear God. Now I know you're everything I knew you were. You just demonstrated what I knew was inside of you. What I knew you were capable of, what I placed you here for, and what I called you for." &gt;&gt; Amen. We think we've got troubles. God is standing on the sidelines saying, "That's my boy. That's my girl." They're believing despite the circumstances. Look, they're moving forward. They're not begging me to change the circumstances. They've resolved and they're moving on. &gt;&gt; Oh, this bride is going to come, amen, to the full image of Christ. Amen. Christ after he r battled out Gethsemane, he walked silently, willfully all the way to Calvary. Amen. &gt;&gt; He let him spit on him and mock him and accuse him and do all those things and never said anything back because he knew the immutability of God's purpose and the immutability of God's promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was another little lady who didn't need any pressure. Ruth was under pressure. There was a winter coming and there was no food. There was starvation. There was poverty. She was moved. Tamar was under pressure. She was destitute and had no no inheritance and nobody to take care of her. But Mary was fine. &gt;&gt; Mary had no trouble. &gt;&gt; We don't think we don't know that she was destitute. She had parents. She was engaged. She was about to be married. She was going to begin her family. She had somebody that loved her. Somebody that was going to take her. God used no external circumstances or pressure to get Mary to submit to his word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Mary is a type of the bride. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The angel came to her when life was good. &gt;&gt; Came to her when she had no need. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "Mary, would you give yourself to me and give your life to me &gt;&gt; and be fulfill the purpose that I have for you?" &gt;&gt; He didn't say those words exactly, but they're all implied. &gt;&gt; Said, "Behold, thou are highly favored of the Lord. God has favored you. You're going to conceive in your womb, and you're going to bring forth, and you're going to do, and you're going to do." And she's got a question. How's that going to be? I don't know a man. And he says, "The Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you. thing formed in you. And besides this, Elizabeth is pregnant. And she just says, "Be it unto me according to your word." &gt;&gt; He didn't have to coersse her. He didn't have to set the circumstances around her. He didn't have to get her to the place where she's going to have to say yes or bad things were going to happen. She could say no and nothing was going to happen perceivably. He didn't get her backed into a corner. He didn't get her against the Red Sea. He didn't get her into starvation. He didn't get her anywhere. He come to her when life was good and things were going fine and she could have just continued on down the road the way she was. But she was able to say, "Be it unto me according to your word. I want to give my life, my flesh, my being, my reputation, everything to that word." &gt;&gt; Listen, when this message came my way, everything was fine. Me and my wife were happy. We were early married. We just had a baby. Everything was going fine. and the word of God come and turn my life upside down, caused family separation, all kinds of separation, caused everything. I mean, all kinds of chaos broke out in my life. But I'm here now a little down the road from the journey. And I say, "Thank God for the separation. Thank God for the circumstances. Thank God for the pressure. Everything was fine until the word come and I said yes to the word and everything fell apart. Praise God. Let it fall apart. The thing I said yes to first is the thing I still say yes to. Be it unto me according to that word. &gt;&gt; I love this word. I love this message. I love this Christ. &gt;&gt; And God shamefully has had to use a lot of pressure along the way &gt;&gt; to get me to pop into his plan. &gt;&gt; But oh, how I want to come to this picture &gt;&gt; where the word of God can say this and I say yes. And God can lead me this way and I'll say yes, Lord, if that's what you want. But how does that work compared to I don't know how it works compared to anything. All I know is what the word says &gt;&gt; and I'll do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not external pressure, not circumstances. Listen, I don't want to wait for a a squeeze and a persecution to get serious about God. I want to wake up in the morning and seek him early &gt;&gt; with no pressure. &gt;&gt; You know when prayer gets the best when troubles happen. You know when church attendance improves? When trouble strikes your home. &gt;&gt; I don't want to live like that anymore. I want to give him my best. I want to serve his word regardless high, low, good, bad, anything going on. I want to follow the word and obey the word. I want to pray because I love him, not because I need him to come and rescue me. I want to tell him I love him in the morning. I want to read his word, not because I'm desperate for an answer. I want to read his word because I love his word, because he's told me to stay in his word. &gt;&gt; I want to come to church not because I'm going to get some great thing out of it or because I I have a great need. I want to come to church just because his word said come to church. &gt;&gt; I want without external pressure, without coercion. I just want to obey the word. &gt;&gt; I believe that's what God's growing. That's why he's worked with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Has he worked with you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like you did Abraham. &gt;&gt; Do you see yourself in the story? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I see myself in the story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to leave you with three quick scriptures. Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not into thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No understanding trusting the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ye that fear the Lord, this is the same word, fear, reverence, and awe. Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you fear the Lord, trust in the Lord. He is their help and their shield. This is the last one I'll leave you with. They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth forever. &gt;&gt; I want that to be me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe the promise is for you? &gt;&gt; Are you an heir of the promise of Abraham? Are you seed of Abraham? &gt;&gt; Is your journey somewhat like Abraham's? &gt;&gt; Oh, may all of our destination be Abraham's. &gt;&gt; May with the things God taught us and trained us bring us to this place of obedience where God can get his purpose out of our lives and be so pleased &gt;&gt; with that purpose. &gt;&gt; Can I Can we read one more scripture? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you in Genesis 22 still? I hope so. Genesis 22. Verse 12 again, 22 and 12. And he said, ay not thy hand upon thy lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearthst God, seeing that thou hast withheld thy son, thine only son, from me. And Abraham lifted up his eyes. He saw a ram. He went and and all of that. Now, let's go to verse 15. And the next thing God says, "And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, and said, By myself have I sworn, sayaeth the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply the thy seed, and as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore, and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy. and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice. &gt;&gt; We are still benefiting from Abraham's obedience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God just confirmed the promise he already made, but he confirmed it with such strong language. &gt;&gt; When Abraham got to this level of maturity into this place of obedience, God reconfirmed what he had already told him all the way through. But he confirmed it with such joy, with such strong language, with such a covenant, by swearing by himself. &gt;&gt; He confirmed the covenant. What is it that pleases God? &gt;&gt; Oh, only faith &gt;&gt; pleases God. &gt;&gt; But faith is in believing something. And the action of faith is to do what we believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when Abraham by faith moved, God was pleased. &gt;&gt; And I want my faith. Amen. To please God. &gt;&gt; Man, let's all stand together. Musicians, if you'll come. And Blake, if you'll come. Amen. I love that little Bible study on Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, tomorrow, if something happens and pressure comes and we have to move to the word, Amen. and you have to make a choice or separation or some difficulty, just say, "Praise God. God's training me like he did Abraham." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's teaching me that only obedience to his word is the only thing that'll work because word God's word can't fail. And his promise to me is sure. I can't lose. I can't be defeated. I can't miss out because of the immutability of his counsel. &gt;&gt; No matter what happens, friends, we can't lose. That's right. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what we see or what we feel. What matters is what he promised. &gt;&gt; We must stay with that. When when Abraham woke up in the morning and loaded the car and loaded it up and got Isaac, he felt, I'm sure, a lot of things. Amen. But one thing he knew for sure, God's word can't fail. &gt;&gt; And I believe God's word can't fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Lord Jesus, we thank you. Thank you so much for a sure word. There's been a sure word of prophecy that we've received and you've opened up the veil of your word and you've showed us who you are and what your purpose is, but you've also revealed to us who we are. And God, in all of that, Lord, you've been training us and teaching us and working with us like you did Abraham. You brought him to a point in life where he could fully surrender to your will, where he could lay it all down and he could give up all reasoning and all emotions. He had to give up emotion. He had to give up reasoning. He had to lay it all aside to follow your word. And God, we believe you're growing us in the same way. And God, may you help us to get to the place, like your prophet said, standing by the bedside of a dying baby. He said, I found there was something inside of emotions, something deeper than reasonings, and that was a seed of faith that you planted there. God, may we learn to rely on that faith in your word, Lord, and that picture you've painted for us of who we are and your purpose in our lives. And may that become the ultimate truth that guides us, Lord. May our faith in that give us the ability to weather every storm, to cross every sea, to go through every obstacle. May it hold us in every trial because nothing that you said in your promise can change. Lord, bless your people. Help us to grow into your likeness, into a perfect faith, into a place, Lord, where we don't need to reason. We don't need to feel. We just see according to your word and we obey. God, I pray that you would move on everyone that's here. If there's anyone, Lord, that's miserable because of a half-hearted commitment. God, would you get them out of their misery? Would you encourage them, Lord, through circumstances, through the word to move out of a half-hearted commitment and move into a full surrender to move out of one foot in, one foot out partial belief that they would move into a full commitment and a surrender to your word for this hour. May they give up reasonings, give up thoughts, give up emotions, and jump in with all their being into the revelation of the hour. And may they find you faithful and them able to put their confidence in you. For you're the high priest. You're the intercessor. You're the kinsman redeemer. You're the judge. And God, we can lay ourselves at your feet trusting in you. we can give ourselves to you wholly trusting in you, God. If there's anyone here that's not fully trusted in you yet, may they not stay on the edge, but they may they come all the way to the threshing floor and lay at your feet. May they stop playing church and moving around the edges of truth, but may they fully commit themselves to your word, God. May they find you faithful and able to redeem and to uphold and to judge righteous. May they find you able to keep your word and keep your promises and keep your covenants. May they put their trust holy in you and commit all the way. Draw them in. Bring them according to your word and according to the seed in their life. Bring them all the way to the full commitment to where there's no more misery. There's only life and life abundantly. But I pray that you'd seek them out and find them. Give them courage. And for the rest of us, would you continue to teach us and work with us, Lord, forgiving us, Lord, of our failures and where we m make mistakes and where we're blind. Would you continue to draw us nearer to you and work with us along the way and train us and teach us until we can come to a place of perfect faith? Help me Lord I pray commit myself to you and I commit this congregation to you and this service to you. May it have a long effect in our lives Lord as your word unfolds within us. We ask your blessings over all these things in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Oh, how I long to be in love with you. Till all the world just fades from you. A deep calling to the deep.
