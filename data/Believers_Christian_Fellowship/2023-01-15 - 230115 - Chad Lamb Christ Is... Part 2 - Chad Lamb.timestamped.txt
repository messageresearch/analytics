[16:26] God it's your grace that has kept us and
[16:30] it is your power that has drawn us Lord
[16:33] God we could no more be here unless
[16:36] you've made a way for us to be here well
[16:39] we just pray now that you would take
[16:40] preeminence among us as we turn our full
[16:43] attention to you
[16:44] Lord we love to sing your praises and
[16:47] worship you and sing how wonderful you
[16:49] are and what you've done now we look
[16:52] into your word for the same thing Lord
[16:54] that you might declare yourself unto us
[16:55] and show us what day and hour that we're
[16:58] living in and our purpose and your plan
[17:00] for us in this life
[17:02] and God may we surrender to this word
[17:05] yield to it Lord and allow you to take
[17:07] control of Our Lives
[17:09] we pray you take control of these lips
[17:11] of clay and know that you would speak
[17:14] your words of eternal life through a
[17:16] human vessel I yield myself to you and
[17:19] ask that you would take control father
[17:21] we love you we want to see you unveiled
[17:24] before us in this day in Jesus Christ's
[17:27] name we pray
[17:29] amen
[17:31] amen let's take our Bibles and return to
[17:35] Hebrews
[17:36] 13 and as you're turning there I want to
[17:39] show you a picture that I failed to show
[17:41] you last week little Marcus Ilya losing
[17:45] off
[17:46] I was born a little over a week ago and
[17:48] you know he went into special care and
[17:51] we weren't able to get a picture to show
[17:52] you when he announced his birth but God
[17:54] was so good to this little boy and he
[17:56] got to come back home on Friday and the
[17:59] family's doing well and so we thank God
[18:01] for that amen everything is perfect
[18:03] brother Ilya wrote a testimony out
[18:06] brother alien sister Natasha said we
[18:08] wanted to express our gratitude for all
[18:10] the prayers messages calls and support
[18:12] baby Marcus is home happy and healthy
[18:15] praise God for his faithfulness Healing
[18:18] Hand and care for us amen and thank you
[18:21] I was so happy when I heard that they
[18:24] were all home amen that's where they
[18:26] want to be so thank God for that that
[18:28] was wonderful also I praise God for the
[18:31] healing of sister Shelley I was able to
[18:33] talk to her yesterday and she gave me
[18:35] that testimony and what a miracle amen
[18:38] God is so good I love it when the doctor
[18:40] say I have no idea what happened and I
[18:42] can't explain it it doesn't make any
[18:44] sense to me it's sister Shelly told me
[18:46] she said the doctor said I don't know
[18:48] what happened and she told me she said I
[18:50] said I know
[18:52] God moved on her amen and we're so
[18:54] thankful for that amen what an
[18:57] encouragement to us
[18:59] I mean let's look at our Bibles to hear
[19:00] Hebrews 13 8. I'd like to continue on
[19:03] the same thought we were on on Wednesday
[19:05] and that was the title Christ is and
[19:09] like we said before that's a uh I mean
[19:11] that's such a statement Christ is you
[19:14] can finish that with so many things
[19:15] there are so many phrases that would fit
[19:18] so many things that you could say
[19:19] because Christ is all and in all amen
[19:22] but I just want to take another look at
[19:25] this like we did on Wednesday Hebrews 13
[19:28] and 8 says Jesus Christ the same
[19:31] yesterday and today and forever
[19:34] now let's look at Colossians chapter one
[19:36] together
[19:42] Colossians chapter 1
[19:47] verse 25
[19:49] Colossians 1 and 25.
[19:53] wherever I am made a minister according
[19:55] to the dispensation of God which is
[19:57] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[20:00] of God even the mystery which had been
[20:02] hid from ages and from Generations but
[20:04] now is made manifest to the Saints to
[20:07] whom God would make known what is the
[20:09] riches of the glory of this mystery
[20:12] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[20:15] you the hope of glory
[20:17] amen God bless you as you have your
[20:19] seeds
[20:20] Christ in you the hope of glory Jesus
[20:24] Christ the same yesterday today and
[20:25] forever
[20:26] so if the great mystery is Christ in you
[20:30] amen and we know that Jesus Christ the
[20:33] same yesterday today and forever then
[20:35] where is Jesus Christ working amen it's
[20:38] Christ in you the hope of glory
[20:41] amen I tell you I was in the back
[20:43] working feverishly because I don't know
[20:45] I don't know why it is like this but you
[20:48] study all day you study for days you you
[20:50] put so many things and you got so many
[20:52] things in your mind you write things
[20:54] down I got things on notes but it seems
[20:57] like always you're waiting for that vein
[20:59] where it all lines up all this stuff
[21:01] that's all over and there's so many
[21:04] thoughts that are scattered throughout
[21:05] my mind and if you could just imagine
[21:07] your mind like a desk and you've got pay
[21:10] piles of papers everywhere amen and
[21:13] that's what it was like as as I was
[21:15] meditating on this subject and preparing
[21:17] and I'm like God I don't know how to put
[21:19] all these piles together I don't know
[21:20] how to make them one sermon and so when
[21:23] I was in the back there or really this
[21:26] morning it all started lining up and I
[21:28] wanted to do a PowerPoint and I love and
[21:30] hate PowerPoints at the same time
[21:32] I love them because it's so nice for us
[21:35] to read through quotes at the same time
[21:36] I hate them because I I hate putting
[21:39] them together amen so I was working
[21:41] feverishly back there and I couldn't get
[21:44] it to work right and I just thought well
[21:46] praise God anyhow
[21:48] the word is the same we're going to
[21:50] preach the word so I got myself all out
[21:54] of sorts and I got myself nervous and I
[21:56] said Lord I'm just going to relax and
[21:58] trust in you how many will trust him
[22:00] with me amen that God himself will come
[22:03] and Minister through a gift he's placed
[22:05] there so if you see me stumbling my
[22:07] notes or in my PowerPoint I got it out
[22:09] of order just don't worry about it just
[22:11] keep pulling God has a way of delivering
[22:13] amen he can use whatever means he wants
[22:15] he can use media he can but what he's
[22:17] going to use is a gift that he's placed
[22:19] in a human vessel and so we're going to
[22:21] have to rely on that and trust him Amen
[22:24] to do what he's promised to do for us so
[22:26] I'm going to look at the uh the
[22:28] PowerPoint brother Frank yeah okay it's
[22:30] a I want to look at a few quotes here
[22:32] and I've got some things that that I'd
[22:35] like to share and some things on my
[22:36] heart that I might pull out of my notes
[22:38] and not use the powerful Point
[22:39] exclusively but I'd like to start with
[22:41] this quote
[22:43] he says God's word come only by the
[22:45] Bible God's Bible is the printed form of
[22:48] the Son of God because the Bible said
[22:51] that is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[22:52] is God revealing himself through Christ
[22:55] and Christ is the word remember it's
[22:58] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[23:00] and forever so this is the printed form
[23:03] of the son of God
[23:05] but when you go to read through this
[23:06] this is also a record of people's lives
[23:11] right so we read when we read from
[23:14] beginning to end in this Bible we're
[23:16] we're reading about human beings
[23:18] is that correct we start off reading
[23:21] about Adam and his wife and then we read
[23:23] about Abel and Cain and we read about
[23:25] Seth and and Cain's lineage and we're
[23:28] going to Noah and then we go you know on
[23:31] to uh Abraham and Moses and we're
[23:33] reading as we read down through this
[23:36] Bible we go from one person to the next
[23:39] to the next to the next you have the
[23:41] children of Israel you have David you
[23:43] have the prophets you you have all of
[23:45] this then you know you come into the New
[23:48] Testament and you've got Peter and
[23:49] you've got Paul and James and John the
[23:51] disciples and you've got the New
[23:53] Testament Church and then you've got the
[23:55] saints that are gathered in Corinth and
[23:56] the saints that are gathered in Ephesus
[23:58] and the saints that are gathered in uh
[24:00] the thessalonica and and you're reading
[24:04] what really when you're reading this
[24:05] Bible you're reading about people
[24:09] but it's the written record of the son
[24:12] of God
[24:13] so where is Jesus Christ manifesting
[24:16] himself it's through people
[24:19] it's it's it's he's manifesting himself
[24:21] through human beings and so we see that
[24:23] this is the printed form of the Son of
[24:25] God it's God revealing himself through
[24:28] Christ and Christ is the word now
[24:31] remember we talked about on Wednesday
[24:33] and I don't want to I'm trying my best
[24:36] not to repeat repeat everything that we
[24:38] said on Wednesday but I just want to
[24:40] labor and in a minute in a minute and
[24:41] move forwards with some other thoughts
[24:43] and um but remember we talked about gone
[24:47] uh and and this is some strange
[24:49] statements brother Brenner makes some
[24:50] strange statements that makes us think
[24:52] like nobody else has ever made us think
[24:54] he said way back in the beginning before
[24:57] there was time before there was anything
[24:59] before God was really God
[25:02] and you think how was was there a time
[25:05] when God he said he was Elohim the
[25:07] self-existent one the great Eternal
[25:10] being and men and that Eternal being
[25:13] became God when he created a heavenly
[25:16] host that would worship Him amen because
[25:18] God is an object of worship is that
[25:21] right
[25:22] so he became God Amen but we know that
[25:26] God is eternal he has no beginning and
[25:28] no end is that correct also
[25:31] but yet before he was God Amen he was
[25:35] Elohim amen and then Elohim was manifest
[25:39] as God when there was those that would
[25:42] begin to worship him so we see it's the
[25:44] same God he hasn't changed nothing's
[25:47] changed it's just manifestations or ways
[25:50] of expressing himself amen and we know
[25:53] that when God was alone when that great
[25:55] Elohim was alone he was alone with his
[25:58] thoughts amen is that right
[26:00] and he's alone with his thoughts and and
[26:02] and he uh uh he he desired for these
[26:06] thoughts which were his attributes which
[26:08] were parts of himself so when we think
[26:10] about the thoughts of God we're not
[26:12] thinking about uh like us who can have a
[26:14] trivial thought that'll come and it'll
[26:16] be silly or or it won't make sense and
[26:18] we'll forget it these were gone when God
[26:21] had these thoughts they were thoughts
[26:23] about himself about him expressing
[26:25] himself amen and these thoughts are
[26:29] Eternal these thoughts are real these
[26:31] thoughts are his attributes
[26:33] he was thinking of you and I he was
[26:35] thinking of his family and he was
[26:36] thinking of he was thinking of the
[26:38] written record of the son of God
[26:40] amen
[26:42] and so as he began to express these
[26:45] thoughts and he began to express himself
[26:47] amen he began to take on many different
[26:50] titles in that expression amen he was he
[26:53] became from Elohim he's now expressed as
[26:56] God because he's an object to worship
[26:58] he's expressed as the word when the word
[27:00] comes out now it's an expression of God
[27:02] and because the word was with God and
[27:04] the Word was God
[27:06] and that expression amen when when that
[27:09] word started to manifest he called that
[27:11] Christ and we're going to get to that in
[27:12] a minute and Christ is the word and
[27:14] Christ is the word the anointed word for
[27:16] the hour amen but that was still God
[27:18] expressing himself
[27:21] and
[27:22] and we'll say it I'll say it oh man I
[27:25] don't know how to say it but just say it
[27:27] just bear with me and help me
[27:29] that was before he was Jesus
[27:34] in the beginning was the word amen and
[27:36] all things were made by him and without
[27:39] him was not anything made and he is the
[27:42] head of all things and we know all of
[27:44] these things but but we know that that
[27:46] if we go to Genesis it says God made the
[27:49] heavens and the Earth is that right
[27:52] but God made the heavens and the Earth
[27:54] but when we go to Colossians when we
[27:56] start talking about the Son of God we're
[27:57] talking about Jesus Christ he says by
[28:00] him all things were made which are in
[28:02] heaven and were Earth all things were
[28:03] made by him and for him and without him
[28:05] was not anything made that was made and
[28:07] he is the head over it all so you say
[28:10] who made it God or the word
[28:15] and the answer is yes
[28:18] who made it God of the word and because
[28:20] God is the word the word is the way of
[28:23] God expressing himself
[28:25] amen so so so and but when that word is
[28:30] expressed it calls it Christ it's also
[28:33] his son because the word came out from
[28:35] him and what came out from him was the
[28:38] son so he is he is the son the Son of
[28:41] God Christ amen and that was back before
[28:44] he had a name but later when that full
[28:47] word that full thought of God the word
[28:49] of God was modeled and confined in the
[28:52] body of Flesh he took on a name and that
[28:54] was Jesus Christ and that was his name
[28:56] past present and future
[29:00] so you think about Adam and his and the
[29:03] woman in the beginning with the original
[29:06] when the woman was formed and you could
[29:08] say where did the woman come from the
[29:10] woman was already there
[29:13] do we understand this when Adam was in
[29:15] spirit form before he was made flesh the
[29:18] woman was there
[29:20] there come a time that the woman had to
[29:22] be expressed and as she was expressed it
[29:25] was a further expression of Adam but she
[29:27] was there already in Adam
[29:30] amen So Adam then was taken from Spirit
[29:34] he was put in a body of Flesh so that he
[29:37] could he could intermingle with the
[29:39] creation that he was ruling over and he
[29:41] was put on a body of Flesh and the woman
[29:43] was there
[29:44] is that right
[29:46] we believe that
[29:47] so God separated out a portion of Adam
[29:51] and he separated out the feminine
[29:52] Spirits from Adam and he formed the
[29:55] woman amen this is not this is not when
[29:59] the uh I don't even know how to use
[30:01] English words I don't know this was not
[30:04] when the woman this is when the woman
[30:06] came into manifestation but it really
[30:08] wasn't her start because her start was
[30:10] already an atom
[30:12] but it's when she came into
[30:14] manifestation in which she came into
[30:16] manifestation you can say this is the
[30:18] manifestation of the woman that's true
[30:20] but you can also say this is Adam
[30:25] is that true it was a further
[30:27] manifestation of Adam it was Adam's
[30:30] Spirit Adam's flesh it was Adam so you
[30:32] could say you could call it woman but it
[30:35] was still Adam
[30:37] so that's why when he created the male
[30:39] and female he called their name Adam
[30:41] there was no separation and
[30:43] identification they were the same two
[30:45] parts of the same or two vessels
[30:48] containing the same I don't know how to
[30:50] describe it amen there's so many things
[30:52] in the spirit world world that we try to
[30:55] relate to with with our carnal
[30:57] understanding with a language that has
[30:59] been developed to understand things we
[31:01] see taste feels touching here
[31:04] is that right
[31:06] But but so our language is limited to
[31:09] this creation
[31:12] and so it's so hard to find adequate
[31:14] words to describe amen things that that
[31:17] that that are go far beyond the tangible
[31:20] in this life
[31:22] so you could call her a woman but you
[31:26] could call her Adam and that's what she
[31:27] was called Adam
[31:30] now she did not get a name until she
[31:33] separated from her husband and adultery
[31:35] and as she did she she conceived and she
[31:37] received a name and their name was Eve
[31:40] is that right
[31:42] until that point she was called woman or
[31:46] Adam
[31:48] but once she was given a name she was
[31:50] given the name Eve
[31:52] now you can use that name past present
[31:57] and future
[31:58] now so so
[32:01] in the day that God laid Adam down and
[32:06] pulled a rib out of Adam and and made
[32:09] the woman in that day no one would have
[32:13] looked at her and said eve
[32:15] makes sense
[32:17] I don't even know why I'm going this way
[32:19] just keep pulling okay please help me
[32:21] out
[32:22] no one would have said eve they would
[32:25] have said Adam
[32:27] all right later amen she would get a
[32:31] name and we know that name is not really
[32:33] a good thing that she got a name
[32:36] but once she got that name now you can
[32:39] go back and say uh back in the beginning
[32:43] God laid Adam down and he pulled Eve out
[32:46] of Adam you can say that now because now
[32:48] we know it because now we know the name
[32:50] that's been associated with that
[32:51] expression but back then you would have
[32:53] never said
[32:55] Eve
[32:57] so that's why you know we we looked at
[32:59] the scriptures on Wednesday that Moses
[33:02] amen he forsook Egypt to Bear the
[33:05] reproach of Christ
[33:07] and Christ was that rock that spiritual
[33:09] rock that followed them through the
[33:11] Wilderness and so we we talk about uh
[33:14] that was Christ nobody in that day would
[33:16] have said Jesus Christ
[33:19] because he hadn't been formed yet he
[33:21] hadn't taken a name he hadn't come into
[33:23] flesh uh uh the flesh body and so nobody
[33:27] would have said Jesus Christ nobody said
[33:29] Jesus Christ amen but afterwards when he
[33:32] received the name now you can go back
[33:35] and say that was Jesus Christ all the
[33:37] way through
[33:38] past present and future
[33:42] and so
[33:43] uh
[33:44] there's a scripture that I want to look
[33:46] at
[33:47] I believe
[33:48] it's Ephesians
[33:50] let me let me go there
[33:59] Ephesians chapter 3.
[34:05] Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 14.
[34:17] Ephesians 3 and 14. for this cause I bow
[34:20] my knees into the father of our Lord
[34:21] Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in
[34:24] Heaven and Earth is named
[34:27] so now the whole family in Heaven and
[34:28] Earth has a name and that name is Jesus
[34:31] Christ amen and what is Jesus Christ he
[34:35] is the word he is the Son of God he is
[34:38] the thought of God declared and
[34:40] expressed that is Jesus Christ so that
[34:43] is why the whole family in Heaven and
[34:45] Earth is named Jesus Christ because the
[34:48] whole family is the expression of God
[34:52] and he's the head of all of that and
[34:54] that is the name that's why in this day
[34:57] when the bride has been identified as
[34:59] part of Christ she doesn't take on a
[35:01] name she doesn't take on Blasphemous
[35:03] names like Eve did amen her name is
[35:06] Jesus Christ she is Mrs Jesus Christ
[35:10] so she recognizes that she is a further
[35:13] expression of Christ
[35:15] okay praise God
[35:17] let me get back to it let me get back on
[35:20] track
[35:23] in the message well I had to be
[35:24] Shepherds he said in Christ is the word
[35:26] the anointed word made manifest and now
[35:29] we're looking at Christ is Christ is and
[35:32] so I I say this and and there's some
[35:35] statements that that we make sometimes
[35:36] that we don't know how to make a better
[35:38] one we we when we say Jesus Christ is uh
[35:42] the denominational understanding our
[35:44] carnal mind goes to just that vessel
[35:47] amen that God was in reconciling the
[35:50] world unto himself amen the one that
[35:52] came out of Nazareth the one that was
[35:54] born in Bethlehem the one that was
[35:55] nailed to the cross and so sometimes we
[35:57] limit Jesus Christ to that figure of
[36:01] Flesh
[36:03] but before that that Christ took on a
[36:07] human name he was the same person he was
[36:10] Christ
[36:12] and since amen that body has left the
[36:15] Earth the spirits come back it's the
[36:17] same spirit it's the spirit of Christ
[36:18] which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[36:21] today and forever
[36:24] so what is Christ who is Christ he's the
[36:26] anointing he is the word the the word
[36:28] May the anointed word may manifest these
[36:31] two quotes are from Wednesday can you
[36:33] receive the word all the word of Christ
[36:35] Christ is the anointed word he is the
[36:38] word anointed
[36:40] Christ means the anointed one the
[36:42] anointed word for that day made manifest
[36:45] so that Christ is the word anointed
[36:49] that's why brother Branham said that
[36:51] that if you are an attribute of God you
[36:54] are a siegene of God you are part of the
[36:56] word
[36:58] and that means there's something in you
[37:01] that is part of the thought of God Amen
[37:04] that's expressed in this hour so there's
[37:06] something in you that is part of the
[37:08] word amen but there must come an
[37:10] anointing upon that word to make it live
[37:12] and when that anointing comes on that
[37:15] word which is the spirit of God it takes
[37:17] the word that's inside and quickens it
[37:19] to life and makes it live and now it
[37:21] becomes the manifested word which is
[37:24] expressing Christ the word made manifest
[37:26] is Christ
[37:28] so now whereas Christ expressed where
[37:30] the words expressed where the anointed
[37:32] word is expressed that's where Christ is
[37:34] being expressed
[37:36] praise God
[37:39] so in this message we we went through
[37:41] Wednesday as well Christ has identified
[37:43] the same in all generations now when
[37:45] Moses come he could not have to know his
[37:48] message neither could Moses have took or
[37:50] no it took Moses's message neither could
[37:52] Joshua have took any of their message
[37:53] see each one Isaiah could not have took
[37:56] another's each message is for that age
[37:59] and with the AIDS that we're living in
[38:01] uh
[38:02] when that word is interpreted God's
[38:04] speaking that word out and making the
[38:06] word for that age live giving the
[38:08] interpretation of it that is God in
[38:11] Christ
[38:12] manifesting see because Christ is the
[38:15] word and when the word is made manifest
[38:17] that is Christ in every age
[38:21] all right we're all on the same page
[38:23] he says God will judge the world not by
[38:26] any certain group he will judge the word
[38:28] by Jesus Christ and Christ is the word
[38:30] he is the word in the beginning was the
[38:33] word the word was with God and the Word
[38:35] was God and the Word was made Flash and
[38:37] dwelt Among Us so he is the expressed
[38:41] word of God in every age he makes him
[38:44] the same yesterday today and forever
[38:48] so now when we go to that statement
[38:49] Jesus Christ and we know this was a
[38:51] major theme of brother Branham he quoted
[38:53] this this verse we've talked about it
[38:54] before but I don't know how many times I
[38:56] never went to find out how many times
[38:58] because you would have to search it in
[39:00] different ways he phrased it but I would
[39:01] say hundreds maybe thousands of times he
[39:04] he expressed Jesus Christ the same
[39:06] yesterday today and forever it was the
[39:08] theme of his ministry
[39:11] and what is Jesus Christ the same
[39:13] yesterday today and forever it's not the
[39:16] body of Flesh that was back there with
[39:19] Moses it was the word that was back
[39:21] there with Moses
[39:23] it wasn't the body of Flesh that was
[39:25] nailed to the cross that was back there
[39:27] in Jeremiah's day or back there in
[39:29] David's day it was not that was not it
[39:32] was Jesus Christ of course it's Jesus
[39:34] Christ but then he was only known as the
[39:36] word amen as it was coming through
[39:38] prophets now the word takes on body
[39:41] receives the name and that's Jesus
[39:43] Christ and will always be Jesus Christ
[39:45] so now you can look back and say that
[39:47] was Jesus Christ
[39:50] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[39:52] and forever he is the expressed word of
[39:56] God in every age
[39:58] makes him the same yesterday today and
[40:01] forever
[40:04] on the wings of a snow white dove he
[40:06] says now what God is showing him here
[40:08] is this on these sacrifices is speaking
[40:11] of Christ that how God
[40:13] took Jesus to Calvary and tore him apart
[40:16] and received the body up into heaven and
[40:19] sent the spirit down upon us that the
[40:21] same Spirit was on him has to be on you
[40:24] to dovetail with the body to be the
[40:26] bride at the end time see that's right
[40:29] won't be a denomination now it'll be the
[40:31] word what he was
[40:33] so you have to have the same Spirit upon
[40:36] the word the bride will have to be the
[40:38] word this is why in our age no
[40:40] denomination will work
[40:42] I mean there's no way a denomination
[40:44] will work this has to be the end of
[40:46] denominational systems because the
[40:48] nominational systems are adding to or
[40:50] taking from the word amen so there's no
[40:53] way this could be a denominational bride
[40:55] she must be separated from denomination
[40:57] to be United with Christ because Christ
[40:59] is the word she must be all of the word
[41:03] so the whole denominational thing will
[41:05] not work in this day
[41:08] so let's read Romans 8 again
[41:11] so then they that are in the flesh
[41:13] cannot please God but you are not in the
[41:15] flesh but in the spirit if so be that
[41:18] the spirit of God dwell in you now if
[41:20] any men have not the spirit of Christ he
[41:23] is none of his I don't read any further
[41:26] I know it's up there please don't read
[41:28] I want to look at verse 9. you are not
[41:31] in the flesh but in the spirit if so be
[41:34] the spirit of God dwell in you
[41:36] so you're still in flesh
[41:39] but you're not in the flesh
[41:41] you're in the spirit
[41:43] that's what I'm telling you human
[41:45] language is pathetic to try to
[41:46] understand God
[41:48] because you're not in the flesh but
[41:50] you're in the spirit but you're living
[41:51] in the flesh but you're not living by
[41:54] the spirit of the flesh or living by the
[41:56] desire of the flesh you're living by the
[41:57] spirit because the spirit of God is in
[41:59] you
[42:00] so you're not in the flesh but you're in
[42:01] the flesh
[42:03] but now you're in the spirit why how are
[42:06] you in the spirit because God's spirit's
[42:07] in you
[42:08] so am I in the spirit is the spirit in
[42:11] me
[42:12] or is it both
[42:15] you see Cardinal Minds never going to
[42:17] get this
[42:18] there has to be something deeper taking
[42:20] place in the soul I mean that goes
[42:22] beyond language
[42:25] this has to become a reality not words
[42:28] this has become a reality because
[42:30] language will never express this reality
[42:32] it's got to be something that's living
[42:34] inside each one of us
[42:36] so you're not in the flesh but in the
[42:37] spirit if so be that the spirit of God
[42:39] dwell in you so you're correct that the
[42:41] spirit of God is in you right
[42:43] now if any men have not the spirit of
[42:45] Christ he is none of his so I have to
[42:47] get the spirit of God and the spirit of
[42:48] Christ
[42:50] is that what the scripture
[42:53] I'm not in the flesh but in the spirit
[42:55] if the spirit of God is in me now if no
[42:57] man I'm not the spirit of Christ I'm
[42:58] none of his so I've got to to be right
[43:01] I've got to have the spirit of God but
[43:02] I'm also going to have to have the
[43:03] spirit of Christ
[43:05] so how do I get the spirit of God in the
[43:06] spirit of Christ and Lester the
[43:08] self-same thing
[43:10] unless it's just other ways of
[43:12] expressing the same thing maybe it's
[43:14] just other words attached to the same
[43:17] thing amen and it's not confusing at all
[43:19] the spirit of God is the spirit of
[43:21] Christ the spirit of Christ is the
[43:23] spirit of God
[43:25] that's why we get so bogged down by
[43:28] language you know we we talk about
[43:30] receiving Christ as our savior and then
[43:33] needing to receive the Holy Ghost as if
[43:34] it's something different
[43:36] I know it's a greater experience I'm not
[43:38] talking about that we receive Christ as
[43:40] our savior we acknowledge that he died
[43:42] on Calvary for us but now we've got to
[43:44] go on and receive the spirit so I've got
[43:46] Christ and now I need the spirit of God
[43:48] no Christ is the spirit of God the
[43:51] spirit of God is the spirit of Christ it
[43:53] is the word it is it's everything it's
[43:55] all the same they're just different ways
[43:57] of expressing
[43:59] the same thing
[44:01] it goes on in verse 10 and if Christ be
[44:03] in you
[44:04] the body is dead because of sin but the
[44:07] spirit is life because of righteousness
[44:10] so
[44:14] so the Christ is in me
[44:18] is that right
[44:20] question is this Christ in you
[44:24] so Christ can be in me and you at the
[44:26] same time
[44:29] also when Jesus Christ resurrected God
[44:32] took the body up to heaven and he and he
[44:35] took the spirit and he sent it down to
[44:38] man is that right
[44:39] so the question is is that flesh body
[44:42] laying up there dead and Limp like a
[44:45] ragdoll just flopped over a chair
[44:47] somewhere or is it have life
[44:50] I don't think the body's just laying
[44:52] there a dead mutilated body flopped over
[44:54] I believe Jesus Christ has life
[44:57] so how did he take the spirit out of him
[45:00] and send it down to us and he still has
[45:02] spirit and how can his Spirit be in me
[45:04] and be in you
[45:05] still being him
[45:09] it's because the carnal mind will never
[45:11] understand the things of the spirit
[45:13] so Christ being you the body is dead
[45:15] because of sin but the spirit is life
[45:17] because of righteousness
[45:19] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[45:21] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[45:23] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[45:25] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[45:27] spirit that dwelleth in you
[45:29] so now the spirit is or the flesh is
[45:31] dead because of sin this flesh is dead
[45:33] I've died to it because of the sin
[45:35] that's in it but now I'm alive by the
[45:38] spirit of Christ that's come in me which
[45:40] is also the spirit of God that's come in
[45:41] me and quickened me to life and now the
[45:44] spirit if the same spirit that raised
[45:47] him from the dead be in me it'll raise
[45:49] this body from the deadness of sin and
[45:52] Quicken it into newness of life so that
[45:54] it'll begin to manifest the life that's
[45:56] on the inside so it's not just a dead
[45:58] body laying there but now there's a
[46:00] spirit that's come to Quicken it to Life
[46:02] to Live to manifest the word
[46:06] amen so are you dead yes Paul says I'm
[46:10] dead and my life is hidden Christ he's
[46:12] dead but he was alive
[46:14] amen dead to the flesh but alive in
[46:17] Christ and Christ alive in him was
[46:19] making his flesh live the word
[46:22] praise God
[46:25] and the message the world is falling
[46:27] apart he says but when God come and was
[46:29] manifested Among Us he handled him we
[46:32] handled him with our hands he said God
[46:35] first Timothy 3 16 without controversy
[46:37] great is the mystery of godliness for
[46:39] God was manifested in the flesh so who
[46:41] was that in flesh was it Christ or was
[46:43] it God
[46:45] the answer again is yes I'm telling you
[46:47] this is an easy test to pass all you
[46:49] have to put is yes on every answer
[46:53] was it God or was it Christ the answer
[46:55] is yes
[46:57] you see wow the trinitarian doctrine was
[47:00] formed by the mind of human beings
[47:04] they didn't understand even the language
[47:06] of the Bible
[47:08] it looks like he'll say that God and
[47:11] then Jesus Christ is separate and then
[47:13] the spirit is a separate person
[47:15] altogether and then and they're looking
[47:17] at this and and the human mind has no
[47:20] option but to try to rationalize it with
[47:22] the world it understands
[47:26] but that's the wrong way to understand
[47:28] God or an interpret his word
[47:32] so without controversy great is the
[47:35] mystery of godliness for God was
[47:36] manifest In the Flesh scene of angels
[47:38] believed on in the world received up in
[47:39] the glory see now that was God With Us
[47:42] God over us God With Us now God in us
[47:46] all that God was he poured into Christ
[47:48] all that Christ was he poured into the
[47:51] church at that day you'll know that I am
[47:54] in the Father the father and me I and
[47:57] you and you and me so it's been God all
[48:00] along you see his same works the church
[48:03] is ordained to carry on his work with
[48:06] the same Spirit you couldn't carry on
[48:08] the same work without the Same Spirit
[48:10] That's right The Same Spirit comes on
[48:13] The Same Spirit Carries On the work
[48:19] in perfect places and I declare to you
[48:21] that Christ is the Holy Ghost
[48:24] I love this quote
[48:26] brother man makes it so simple he said
[48:28] God is his word say Christ is the word
[48:32] is that right
[48:33] he said God is spirit and Christ is the
[48:35] spirit and now he says I declare to you
[48:37] that Christ is the Holy Ghost amen so if
[48:40] you receive the Holy Ghost you receive
[48:42] Christ amen whose life is in you it's
[48:44] the life of Jesus Christ in you
[48:46] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[48:48] declare to you that Christ is the Holy
[48:50] Ghost the word Christ means the anointed
[48:52] one just a person that's anointed that
[48:54] is the Christ the anointed one and the
[48:57] reality is as we talk about this we all
[48:59] know this
[49:01] but we don't know it amen we know it
[49:03] amen in our heart but in our mind things
[49:06] get discombobulated
[49:08] and look at first John 5 7 for there are
[49:11] three that bear record in heaven the
[49:13] Father the word and the Holy Ghost and
[49:16] these three are one
[49:20] they're not like one these three are one
[49:23] but they're different ways that God is
[49:25] manifesting himself or expressing
[49:27] himself so the Father the word and the
[49:29] Holy Ghost well I guess that leaves
[49:31] Jesus Christ Plum out
[49:34] I don't see mentioned in the scripture
[49:36] unless you see him mentioned in the
[49:38] scripture
[49:39] presidents do you see him mentioned in
[49:41] the scripture yes he's the word amen
[49:44] so the father of the word and the Holy
[49:46] Ghost but we know Christ is the Holy
[49:48] Ghost
[49:50] Jesus says the father and I are one
[49:53] so how are we going to divide them all
[49:55] up and separate them they are one amen
[49:58] just ways of expressing
[50:02] in Ephesians in the church age it says
[50:05] to be anti-word is to be anti-jesus
[50:08] to be anti-orders to be Antichrist
[50:10] because the spirit and the word are one
[50:13] if your anti-word you will have to be
[50:15] Antichrist
[50:17] so if you're anti-word you're anti-jesus
[50:19] because Jesus Christ is the word
[50:22] praise God let's turn to numbers 11 read
[50:25] something together
[50:46] I am so trusting and depending on God to
[50:49] help us as we move forward here
[50:52] numbers 11 verse 10.
[50:55] in numbers 11 the people are crying out
[50:58] and murmuring because they want meat to
[51:00] eat they're in the wilderness journey
[51:01] and they're murmuring
[51:03] and it says in verse 10
[51:05] of chapter 11 and numbers
[51:08] then Moses heard the people weep
[51:10] throughout their families every man in
[51:12] the door of his tent and the anger the
[51:14] Lord was kindled greatly Moses also was
[51:16] displeased
[51:17] and Moses said unto the Lord wherefore
[51:20] hast thou Afflicted thy servant and
[51:22] wherefore have I not found favor in thy
[51:24] sight that thou layest the burden of all
[51:27] this people upon me
[51:29] have I conceived all this people have I
[51:31] begotten them that thou should have say
[51:33] unto me carry them in thy bosom as a
[51:35] nursing father bearth the suckling child
[51:37] into the land which thou swearst into
[51:39] their fathers
[51:42] um it's worse unto their fathers When
[51:44] shall I have flesh to give unto all this
[51:46] people for they weep unto me saying give
[51:48] us flesh that we may that we may eat I'm
[51:51] not able to Bear all these people alone
[51:53] because it is too heavy for me and if
[51:57] thou deal thus with me kill me I pray
[51:59] thee out of hand if I have found favor
[52:01] in thy and let me not see my
[52:03] wretchedness and the Lord said to Moses
[52:06] gather unto me 70 men
[52:08] of the Elders of Israel whom thou
[52:11] knowest to be the Elders of the people
[52:13] and officers over them and bring them
[52:15] unto the Tabernacle of the congregation
[52:18] that they may stand there with thee and
[52:21] I will come down and talk with thee
[52:23] there and I will take of the spirit
[52:25] which is upon thee and I will put it
[52:27] upon them and they shall bear the burden
[52:30] of the people with thee that thou bear
[52:32] it not thyself alone
[52:35] so God is going to do something
[52:37] wonderful for Moses Moses is a man amen
[52:40] he is he is struggling under the burden
[52:42] of caring for the people and he says go
[52:45] get 70 men true Elders princes and he
[52:48] bring them around the Tabernacle and I
[52:51] will take the spirit that's in you and
[52:53] put it upon them
[52:55] now let's go over to verse 24.
[53:02] and Moses went out and told the people
[53:04] the words of the of the Lord and
[53:06] gathered the seventy men of the Elders
[53:08] of the people and set them round about
[53:09] the Tabernacle and the Lord came down in
[53:12] a cloud and spake unto him and took of
[53:14] the spirit that was upon him and gave it
[53:16] unto the seventy elders and it came to
[53:18] pass that when the spirit rested upon
[53:20] them they prophesied and did not cease
[53:24] but there remained two of the men in the
[53:26] in the camp the name of the one was
[53:28] eldad and the name of the other was me
[53:30] Dad and the spirit rested upon them and
[53:33] they were of them that were written but
[53:35] went not out into the Tabernacle and
[53:37] they prophesied in the camp
[53:39] and there ran a young man and told Moses
[53:41] and said eldad and me dad do prophesy in
[53:44] the camp and Joshua the son of nun the
[53:47] servant of Moses one of the his young
[53:49] men answered and said my Lord Moses
[53:52] forbid them and Moses said unto him
[53:54] envious thou for my sake would God that
[53:58] all the Lord's people were prophets and
[54:00] that the Lord would put his Spirit upon
[54:02] them
[54:04] so now this is a tremendous passage of
[54:07] the scripture for me because now we see
[54:10] that Moses under the burden cries out to
[54:12] God and God says gather 70 men and I'll
[54:16] take the spirit that's on you and I'll
[54:17] put it on them now when we speak
[54:20] logically as human beings if we would
[54:22] say something like that we would believe
[54:25] that God took the spirit that was on
[54:27] Moses put it on them and now it's not on
[54:29] Moses anymore it's on them
[54:32] because if I'm going to take this
[54:34] controller from here and I'm going to
[54:36] put it over here or I'm going to take it
[54:37] out of my pocket and I'm going to give
[54:39] it to Anthony's pocket you'll see
[54:40] something move but that's not how this
[54:43] works God can take this put it in
[54:45] Anthony's pocket and leave it in my
[54:47] pocket at the same time
[54:49] the ministry of Moses diminished not one
[54:52] centimeter after God made this move amen
[54:55] I don't know how the spirit can divide
[54:57] itself I don't know how it can be here
[54:59] and there and everywhere at the same
[55:00] time and work in full capacity I don't
[55:03] comprehend it intellectually but I
[55:05] believe it by faith that whatever amen
[55:08] whatever Christ is he is in me whatever
[55:10] is in you he's in me whatever he is here
[55:13] he's on the other side of the planet
[55:14] amen whatever wherever amen God his
[55:18] spirit is in US
[55:22] thank you
[55:23] amen
[55:25] that's why
[55:28] so many times we think carnally about
[55:31] all these things even about the coming
[55:33] of the Lord
[55:34] that now he can't come unless we see a
[55:38] nail prince and a hand
[55:40] but but he sent his word
[55:44] and he is the word
[55:46] is he the word
[55:48] amen
[55:50] so he sent his word and we live in the
[55:53] time where the word has been fully
[55:55] revealed and given back to the bride so
[55:58] if you receive the full revelation of
[56:00] Jesus Christ I mean how can you have the
[56:02] full word and not have him
[56:06] and when the full word came back the
[56:09] spirit it unlocked the fullness of the
[56:11] Holy Ghost back into the church again
[56:13] how can you get the Holy Ghost and not
[56:16] have Christ
[56:18] not have him
[56:20] you see it we live in a day we know it
[56:24] through the church ages there's been a
[56:25] limitation because of the doctrines of
[56:27] man because of the the limiting of the
[56:30] word there was limiting of the
[56:31] outpouring of the spirit or the
[56:32] expression of the word but now we're not
[56:34] living in the limited time now we're
[56:36] living in the full measure of the full
[56:38] revelation of Jesus Christ Christ is
[56:40] here amen he has unveiled himself the
[56:43] seals have been taken off the book he
[56:45] has returned to his church
[56:48] amen
[56:49] how is it all work I don't know
[56:52] where is this and where is that I mean
[56:55] it's like we want to take beakers
[56:57] and we want to take a vessel that's
[57:00] Christ this is Christ this is the spirit
[57:01] and he's poured a little bit in here and
[57:03] a little bit in here and a little all
[57:04] around the world until until that you
[57:07] know this one's got more than this one
[57:08] and there's none in here and I ran out
[57:12] there's no running out this is Spirit it
[57:14] doesn't work like natural
[57:18] it doesn't work by the same laws it
[57:20] doesn't work by the by the same methods
[57:22] amen I don't know how it works I don't
[57:24] look at me and say brother Ted how does
[57:25] it work I don't know how it works I
[57:27] don't know if there's a measurement at
[57:29] all I have no idea but I know that
[57:31] Christ is in his bride amen all that God
[57:34] was he poured into Christ all that
[57:36] Christ was he poured in the church that
[57:39] didn't mean there was no other
[57:40] expression anywhere else at any other
[57:42] time in heaven it means whatever he is
[57:44] he in full measure of that full capacity
[57:47] full life of that he put in Christ
[57:51] whenever the full capacity full measure
[57:54] Full Life of Christ he put into his
[57:56] church
[57:59] amen
[58:01] praise God
[58:03] so now God takes the spirit that's upon
[58:05] Moses
[58:06] and he puts it in the 70.
[58:09] and as soon as that Spirit comes in then
[58:11] they begin to prophesy and they do not
[58:13] see say Amen they weren't prophesying
[58:16] before remember how brother Branham said
[58:17] if the spirit of Beethoven coming to you
[58:20] you would compose music
[58:22] is that right and so he said as the
[58:25] spirit of Christ come in you'll live the
[58:26] life of Christ amen he said if John
[58:28] Dillinger's Spirit came in me he goes
[58:30] I'd go rob banks
[58:32] because that Spirit Well now the church
[58:34] has received the spirit of Christ which
[58:36] is the word how could she do anything
[58:38] but manifest the word
[58:41] how can she take denominational
[58:43] understanding how can she limit God's
[58:45] word how can she stay Amen in her own
[58:48] desires contrary to the god word of God
[58:50] how can I God how how in the world can
[58:53] we say we receive the spirit of Christ
[58:55] and continue on Amen and some of the
[58:58] things of the world that we did before
[58:59] no we now we receive the spirit of
[59:01] Christ Christ will live his own word and
[59:04] that's the whole point of receiving the
[59:05] spirit of Christ so that his word will
[59:07] live in bodies of Flesh
[59:10] amen
[59:11] so now there was a dilemma because God
[59:15] said Gather them up into the Tabernacle
[59:17] amen and so there was 70 and the
[59:20] scripture says their names were also
[59:22] written there's two names eldad and me
[59:24] dad I don't know if I'm pronouncing it
[59:26] right but but you get the point
[59:28] I don't know if you can pronounce it any
[59:29] better
[59:32] they weren't at the Tabernacle so there
[59:35] were 68 in the Tabernacle and there was
[59:37] two outside the Tabernacle and God said
[59:40] bring them up to the Tabernacle and I'll
[59:41] take the spirit off you and put it on
[59:42] them and when God poured out the spirit
[59:44] of Moses upon them amen those outside
[59:47] the Tabernacle in the camp it hit them
[59:49] at the exact same time
[59:51] and these in here are prophesying these
[59:54] two out here in the camper prophesy but
[59:56] but I thought you had to be at the
[59:58] Tabernacle and I thought God was going
[1:00:00] to take physical stuff and put physical
[1:00:02] stuff on physical people and they were
[1:00:04] going to begin to prophesy so you would
[1:00:06] have to be here to get the physical
[1:00:07] stuff but it's not physical it's
[1:00:10] spiritual and when God designated that
[1:00:12] that Spirit that's in Moses will come to
[1:00:14] these seventy it didn't matter where
[1:00:16] they sat it came to the seventy
[1:00:20] and they begin to prophesy amen and now
[1:00:23] I mean now a young man comes in and
[1:00:25] tells Moses he's going to tell on them
[1:00:27] they're in trouble for prophesying in
[1:00:29] the can
[1:00:31] and even Joshua says forbid them and he
[1:00:34] says why forbid them amen wood to God
[1:00:36] God wants all of his people to be
[1:00:39] Prophets
[1:00:41] God wants this Spirit upon everybody not
[1:00:43] at just upon one amen that's what God
[1:00:46] desired I mean Moses is expressing God's
[1:00:49] desire God would want everyone to have
[1:00:52] this Same Spirit upon them amen but they
[1:00:54] refuse to unite with God at Sinai and
[1:00:57] God's now working through Moses but but
[1:00:59] God would want everyone to receive this
[1:01:01] spirit and so nobody was upset that they
[1:01:03] got it outside the Tabernacle
[1:01:06] see how the spirit world works
[1:01:09] you've got to come up here to get it but
[1:01:11] they got it
[1:01:13] how did they get it because there was a
[1:01:15] point in time that God was going to take
[1:01:17] what was on Moses and give it to the 70.
[1:01:21] and it wasn't working in physical
[1:01:23] dimensions in physical ways
[1:01:27] and when that same spirit that was on
[1:01:29] Moses was only 70 it hit those in the
[1:01:31] Tabernacle we hit those outside the
[1:01:33] Tabernacle why because their names were
[1:01:36] written down
[1:01:39] because their names were written down
[1:01:42] so at the time so the names of the
[1:01:46] seventy were recorded
[1:01:48] and that recording showed who would
[1:01:51] receive that spirit
[1:01:53] is that right
[1:01:55] these are the ones that will receive the
[1:01:57] spirit so when God released the spirit
[1:02:00] that was on Moses to come unto those who
[1:02:02] are written down amen it didn't matter
[1:02:05] where their physical location was when
[1:02:07] God released that Spirit it hit
[1:02:09] everybody whose name was on the book
[1:02:13] thank you
[1:02:13] praise be to God why because they were
[1:02:16] eligible to receive the spirit that was
[1:02:18] in Moses and when the spirit of Moses
[1:02:20] hit them amen they begin to prophesy
[1:02:22] both in the Tabernacle and outside and
[1:02:25] I'll tell you this bride in the end time
[1:02:27] her name is written down it's been
[1:02:29] recorded in a book and when God
[1:02:31] designates that this is the time for the
[1:02:33] spirit of Christ to be released in full
[1:02:35] measure amen it doesn't matter amen
[1:02:38] where you're at you can be anywhere in
[1:02:40] the world but that spirit will come and
[1:02:42] hit you and it also doesn't matter on
[1:02:44] time you can say well that was released
[1:02:46] maybe in 1963. I wasn't born for myself
[1:02:49] till 1977. it's not bound by time amen
[1:02:53] it was released to the names that are
[1:02:55] written in the book and my name is
[1:02:57] written in the book and now there's upon
[1:02:59] me the same spirit that was upon Christ
[1:03:05] only my expression is portion
[1:03:08] my personal what God wants to do in this
[1:03:11] Tabernacle of Flesh there's a portion of
[1:03:13] deity taking up resonance and this amen
[1:03:16] and brother Branham when he when he
[1:03:18] begins to describe this now realize he's
[1:03:20] trying to use English he's trying to use
[1:03:22] the same uh the the same flawed
[1:03:25] principle that I'm trying to use that's
[1:03:27] why it's the foolishness of preaching
[1:03:28] that city of Souls
[1:03:30] but brother remember says you ought to
[1:03:32] the ocean and you dip
[1:03:34] your spoon
[1:03:36] into the ocean
[1:03:37] and pull out all the chemicals that are
[1:03:40] in the entire ocean is in the Spoonful
[1:03:43] only in a portion
[1:03:46] so what do you have how much of Christ
[1:03:48] do you have you have all of Christ
[1:03:53] if you have a portion of Christ you have
[1:03:55] all of Christ
[1:03:58] oh I I don't know how to make that sink
[1:04:00] in I hope to God that it sinks into
[1:04:03] every one of us amen that if you get the
[1:04:05] Spoonful you can say well I've only got
[1:04:07] a portion amen you've got a portion with
[1:04:09] everything that's in the word is in you
[1:04:13] the full life of the word amen with the
[1:04:16] thought of God behind it is now poured
[1:04:18] unto you you say but I just got a little
[1:04:19] piece are you you've got everything that
[1:04:22] was ever in the Bible is in you every
[1:04:24] healing is in you every word is in you
[1:04:27] every manifestation is in you
[1:04:32] but we're by the thought of God and by
[1:04:35] the word of God we're here to express a
[1:04:37] certain expression
[1:04:40] so
[1:04:43] Moses is a spirit
[1:04:45] was poured out on the 70.
[1:04:48] and all of those whose name were written
[1:04:51] down got it
[1:04:53] when God released it
[1:04:55] but it's not like Moses fell over dead
[1:04:59] Moses was still moving and not like
[1:05:01] Moses Ministry ended Moses was still
[1:05:03] ministering
[1:05:05] Moses was still performing Miracles
[1:05:07] Moses was still giving the word of the
[1:05:09] Lord Moses was still leading the
[1:05:11] children of Israel Moses was still doing
[1:05:14] everything that Moses did before the
[1:05:16] moment from what I can tell in the
[1:05:17] scripture Moses didn't lose anything
[1:05:21] but they also got the spirit because it
[1:05:23] was going to take the spirit of Moses
[1:05:25] for them to carry the burden of Moses to
[1:05:28] help the people
[1:05:30] so what spirit is it going to take at
[1:05:32] the end time for the bride to manifest
[1:05:33] Christ it'll take his spirit
[1:05:36] in full measure
[1:05:39] I tell you I'm so glad I can say my name
[1:05:42] was written down
[1:05:45] and that when God in this end time took
[1:05:48] the denominational barriers and chains
[1:05:50] that was holding back the spirit of God
[1:05:52] and released it to come back upon the
[1:05:54] people my name was included in that list
[1:05:57] who can receive that spirit
[1:06:00] and I thank God for it
[1:06:05] he said now we noticed that God began to
[1:06:08] make him a bride for Christ and the
[1:06:09] bride must be identified with him and in
[1:06:11] him because it is part of him now the
[1:06:14] brightest part of him she is part of him
[1:06:16] the word for that day the bride becomes
[1:06:19] part of the word for it's Christ
[1:06:22] now you believe that we have to be in
[1:06:25] Christ in Christ we have to be of Christ
[1:06:28] in Christ part of Christ
[1:06:32] so the bride becomes part of the word
[1:06:34] for it's Christ
[1:06:36] it's Christ expressing through bride
[1:06:39] form in this day
[1:06:41] but
[1:06:42] how much of Christ
[1:06:45] I'd say all of Christ
[1:06:48] you know when those those 70
[1:06:52] got a a portion of the spirit of Moses
[1:06:57] God was going to take the spirit that
[1:07:00] was on Moses and put it on the 70.
[1:07:04] so this is just how human brain works
[1:07:09] all right I take one whole divide it 70
[1:07:12] times
[1:07:14] and you each get apart
[1:07:17] is that right
[1:07:18] sorry Moses you don't have anything left
[1:07:22] I don't want to do that so I'll leave
[1:07:24] half with Moses and I'll take half and
[1:07:26] I'll cut that up into 70 parts
[1:07:29] and you get
[1:07:30] no
[1:07:31] whatever Spirit Moses has they had what
[1:07:34] the first one had the 17th had
[1:07:37] it was not portioned out like that it
[1:07:40] was given unto them the spirit that was
[1:07:42] in him was given unto them amen and it
[1:07:45] was the same it was the same in
[1:07:46] characteristics it was the same in power
[1:07:48] it was the same in everything only they
[1:07:50] had a certain they had a certain
[1:07:52] manifestation that they were going to do
[1:07:54] in helping to Bear the burdens of the
[1:07:56] people they may not be writing the law
[1:07:58] they may not be amen the final judge in
[1:08:01] all matters but they were bearing the
[1:08:03] same burdens so they received the same
[1:08:05] Spirit not a partial Spirit not a not a
[1:08:08] piece off the corner of the end that's
[1:08:10] left over for the 70th but whatever
[1:08:12] Moses had they had
[1:08:15] foreign
[1:08:16] so whatever Christ had this bride has
[1:08:21] and who gets it those whose names were
[1:08:23] written down
[1:08:25] let's go to revelation 10. I'm gonna
[1:08:28] read it here I've got it on the screen
[1:08:29] revelation 10.
[1:08:31] I wrote down 8 to 11 but I'm just going
[1:08:33] to take verse 10. we know Revelation 10
[1:08:36] is when the mighty Angel comes down with
[1:08:38] a book in his hand and and seven
[1:08:40] Thunders utter their voices and the
[1:08:42] seventh angel when he begins the sound
[1:08:44] the mystery of God will be finished as
[1:08:47] he declared to the servants the prophets
[1:08:48] we know all this then we come to
[1:08:50] Revelation 10 and 8 and John is told to
[1:08:54] go and take the book and eat it
[1:08:57] and John's the type of the Bride
[1:08:59] it says and he took the little book out
[1:09:01] of the Angel's hand and he ate it up and
[1:09:03] it was in in my mouth sweet as honey and
[1:09:06] as soon as I had eaten it my belly was
[1:09:07] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:09:10] prophesy again
[1:09:13] thou must prophesy again before many
[1:09:16] peoples Nations tongues and kings
[1:09:19] here we see brother Branham said Elijah
[1:09:23] and Elisha Ministry was just the same as
[1:09:26] Jesus Christ and the bride male and
[1:09:29] female and we saw Christ working amen
[1:09:32] through Elijah Ministry in our day amen
[1:09:34] but there's a little bride he's going to
[1:09:36] take and eat the open book but she's
[1:09:38] told to prophesy Again by what spirit
[1:09:41] will she prophesy again whatever Spirit
[1:09:43] prophesied the first time she'll
[1:09:45] prophesy again
[1:09:47] and and you know what you know uh uh
[1:09:49] that we've talked about this so many
[1:09:51] times even the term prophesy again shows
[1:09:54] that she doesn't have her own prophecy
[1:09:56] I think this is so important to
[1:09:58] recognize in the end time it's not like
[1:10:00] amen the bride can go off like a Loose
[1:10:02] Cannon and come up with anything she
[1:10:03] wants to come up with no she's here to
[1:10:05] prophesy again which means she's
[1:10:07] prophesying what's already been
[1:10:08] prophesied
[1:10:10] because this bride under her Messenger
[1:10:12] will be the final voice to the final age
[1:10:14] so that means in order to be the final
[1:10:16] voice to the final age the voice of God
[1:10:18] in this day she must be under her
[1:10:21] messenger
[1:10:23] not equal to and not above she must be
[1:10:26] under her Messenger to be the final
[1:10:28] voice to the final life but what is it
[1:10:30] it's the voice of God where's the voice
[1:10:32] of God coming through coming through his
[1:10:34] bride why because she's eaten the book
[1:10:36] she's become one with the word she's
[1:10:38] received the word and the spirit of the
[1:10:40] word and now she is through prophesy
[1:10:43] again whatever has been prophesied shall
[1:10:45] prophesy again
[1:10:48] so we look at this word prophecy because
[1:10:49] sometimes many times we think well if
[1:10:51] we're going to prophesy then the bride's
[1:10:53] got to be getting New Revelations she's
[1:10:55] got to give something she's bringing the
[1:10:57] bride doesn't have to bring one new
[1:10:58] revelation to prophesy again she's
[1:11:00] prophesying what's already been given us
[1:11:03] through the prophet messenger
[1:11:06] so the word prophesy means to speak
[1:11:09] forth by divine inspiration
[1:11:12] it also means I'm going to skip down to
[1:11:15] the bottom one to utter forth declare a
[1:11:18] thing which can only be known by divine
[1:11:21] revelation
[1:11:23] praise God
[1:11:25] not everybody will catch this message
[1:11:31] she has to eat the book
[1:11:35] she
[1:11:36] and and I love I mean this is just so in
[1:11:39] the theme of what we're talking about
[1:11:40] tonight
[1:11:41] what does it mean to eat the book I mean
[1:11:43] can you're not ripping Pages out
[1:11:47] but neither is just listening to a tape
[1:11:49] eating the book
[1:11:52] neither is just walking through the
[1:11:54] store eating a meal
[1:11:57] cooking the service is not a cooking a
[1:11:59] meal is not the same as eating a meal
[1:12:01] but to eat the book to take the book and
[1:12:04] eat the book is she has received the
[1:12:06] word into herself
[1:12:08] and she has become United with this word
[1:12:11] and now this word is in her
[1:12:15] more than just say I'm
[1:12:20] I know where to go get the food I know
[1:12:22] where the storehouse is I know where the
[1:12:24] canned goods are I can turn on the stuff
[1:12:25] but you see we've got to eat the book
[1:12:28] we've got to take the word that was
[1:12:30] preached amen not just listen to it but
[1:12:32] we must take it into ourselves brother
[1:12:34] Brandon says you say I believe the
[1:12:36] message brother Branham I believe the
[1:12:37] message he says that's good but that's
[1:12:39] still not it yet you must take it take
[1:12:42] it unto yourself we got to become one
[1:12:44] with it
[1:12:46] you must identify with it let it
[1:12:49] identify us and we'd be identified with
[1:12:51] it
[1:12:53] so we know just to prophesize to speak
[1:12:55] forth by divine inspiration
[1:12:57] you can or this one um definition 1B the
[1:13:02] idea of foretelling future events
[1:13:03] pertaining especially to the kingdom of
[1:13:05] God but one sea to utter forth declare a
[1:13:09] thing which can only be known by divine
[1:13:11] revelation amen and that is this message
[1:13:14] it can only be known by divine
[1:13:16] revelation
[1:13:17] and the bride is the only one who can
[1:13:20] get the revelation of it so who else can
[1:13:22] prophesy again only she who has eaten
[1:13:25] the book and has Christ on the inside
[1:13:27] can prophesy again
[1:13:29] nobody else can if not we're just going
[1:13:31] to repeat what somebody else says amen
[1:13:33] we're not here to repeat what somebody
[1:13:35] else says we're here to take it take it
[1:13:37] into ourselves digest it let it become
[1:13:39] one with us and then whatever it is in
[1:13:41] US Amen Let it speak out from us
[1:13:45] and you say well brother Chad I'm not a
[1:13:47] preacher oh oh there's so many ways to
[1:13:49] speak the message there's so many ways
[1:13:51] to prophesy and you can declare your
[1:13:53] message by living your message
[1:13:56] [Music]
[1:13:58] what does it do it declares
[1:14:01] it speaks you know the the Bible talks
[1:14:04] about the heavenly host the the Stars
[1:14:06] where God wrote his first Bible the
[1:14:08] Heavenly Host is is spilled out there
[1:14:10] and it's placed in divine order and it
[1:14:12] speaks of the word of God the whole Plan
[1:14:15] of Redemption is in the stars and and
[1:14:17] and the Bible says that their language
[1:14:21] their voice goeth out and speaketh Night
[1:14:24] by night they utter his speech
[1:14:27] is that what the Bible says about the
[1:14:29] Stars why because it's the first Bible
[1:14:32] it's on display every Star positionally
[1:14:35] plays shining with the brightness God
[1:14:37] gave it in the position that God put it
[1:14:39] in amen shining night after night right
[1:14:42] where God put it not moving around where
[1:14:44] God put it shining the amount of light
[1:14:46] God gave it to shine in conjunction with
[1:14:48] the other stars that are around it all
[1:14:51] make up a sign in the Zodiac that tells
[1:14:53] a story of redemption and God says their
[1:14:56] voice goeth through the ends of the
[1:14:58] Earth night after night they utter his
[1:15:00] speech there's not a language there's
[1:15:01] not a place where their language is not
[1:15:03] known
[1:15:05] that's not audible words coming out of
[1:15:08] your mouth that's the word manifested on
[1:15:11] display
[1:15:12] when each of us get in our position that
[1:15:15] God has placed Us in this end time
[1:15:16] shining with the light that God's given
[1:15:18] us in the place that God's given us
[1:15:20] there is a there is a light an
[1:15:22] illuminance a revelation that's coming
[1:15:24] out of our life
[1:15:27] and it's speaking
[1:15:30] Revelation 19 verse 9 and he saith unto
[1:15:34] me right blessed are they which are
[1:15:36] called unto the marriage supper of the
[1:15:37] lamb and you say them to me these are
[1:15:39] the true sayings of God and I fell at
[1:15:41] his feet to worship him and he said unto
[1:15:43] me see thou do it not I am thy fellow
[1:15:46] servant and of thy Brethren that have
[1:15:48] the testimony of Jesus worship God for
[1:15:51] the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[1:15:54] Prophecy
[1:15:56] what's this Spirit it says prophesy
[1:15:58] again what's the spirit of Prophecy
[1:16:00] what's prophecy supposed to do the
[1:16:02] testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[1:16:05] Prophecy
[1:16:07] what is this testimony
[1:16:10] it's translated witness 15 times
[1:16:13] and the bottom definition is one who
[1:16:15] testifies a testimony as in before a
[1:16:18] judge
[1:16:20] what is the spirit of Prophecy
[1:16:22] it's the testimony or the witness of
[1:16:24] Jesus Christ
[1:16:26] what are we supposed to do as we live
[1:16:28] our life we are supposed to witness the
[1:16:30] life of Jesus Christ we are his
[1:16:32] Witnesses
[1:16:34] our lives are testifying that he lives
[1:16:40] brother mem says in the rising of the
[1:16:42] son the son has got to be revealed again
[1:16:45] in the bride in the last day
[1:16:49] the quickening power that's the the life
[1:16:51] of Jesus Christ the quickening power has
[1:16:54] got to come Quicken them out of these
[1:16:55] dead denominations and Creeds to a
[1:16:58] Living Word
[1:16:59] of the Living God we read this last time
[1:17:02] the sun has got to be revealed he's got
[1:17:05] to be revealed where in the bride and
[1:17:09] the last day
[1:17:10] in you and me who have the testimony of
[1:17:13] Jesus Christ and the spirit of Prophecy
[1:17:16] to live the life for this day
[1:17:20] it says in the message I have heard but
[1:17:22] now I see he came around he said now as
[1:17:25] it was in the days of lot so shall it be
[1:17:27] at the time when the son of man is being
[1:17:29] revealed now watch the son of man was
[1:17:32] revealed to Abraham's group as a man a
[1:17:35] prophet in the form of human flesh an
[1:17:37] ordinary man with dust on his clothes
[1:17:39] and Abraham called him Elohim
[1:17:42] now Jesus Promised here that in the last
[1:17:44] days the son of man will be revealed
[1:17:46] again to that same type of group The
[1:17:48] Royal Seed of Abraham just before the
[1:17:51] fire falls
[1:17:53] I wonder I want to pay a little bit of
[1:17:55] attention to this for a few minutes
[1:17:56] we've been through this many times so we
[1:17:58] know that on the planes of memory that
[1:18:00] Abraham received the visitation and that
[1:18:02] visitation was God in the form of Flesh
[1:18:06] and that's what brother Branham says
[1:18:08] here
[1:18:09] in the time when the son of man is going
[1:18:11] to be revealed it'll be as it was in the
[1:18:13] days of lot it'll be like it was in
[1:18:15] Sodom and over and over brother Branham
[1:18:16] says we're in a Sodom condition these
[1:18:18] are the days of lot
[1:18:20] and the son of man is to be revealed to
[1:18:23] Abraham's group as a man a prophet and a
[1:18:28] form of human flesh
[1:18:30] an ordinary man with dust on his clothes
[1:18:33] and Abraham called him Elohim
[1:18:37] an ordinary man with dust on his clothes
[1:18:40] and Abraham called him the self-existent
[1:18:42] one
[1:18:44] the almighty God
[1:18:46] amen and we know that God had taken the
[1:18:48] element of the earth and he made a
[1:18:50] temporary body for him to dwell in amen
[1:18:52] so Abraham wasn't speaking to the
[1:18:54] temporary body he was speaking to the
[1:18:56] life inside
[1:18:57] and the life inside that body was Elohim
[1:19:00] and had dust on his clothes and it ain't
[1:19:02] and it ain't me and it ain't me the calf
[1:19:05] the goat that was fixed for it drank
[1:19:07] milk ate butter amen we know that what
[1:19:09] was it it appeared to be a man but what
[1:19:12] it was was Elohim in the man
[1:19:15] it looked like a man but it was God in
[1:19:17] the man
[1:19:19] is that right
[1:19:20] it looked like a man I tell you when
[1:19:22] brother Branham was standing on the
[1:19:24] platform amen when he was talking and
[1:19:26] and he was having conversation and
[1:19:27] talking about his day it looked like a
[1:19:29] man amen but when he turned his back to
[1:19:31] the crowd and began to discern the
[1:19:32] thoughts in their heart amen there was
[1:19:34] another life inside that man there is
[1:19:37] something else there we could recognize
[1:19:39] that's not just a man amen that's not
[1:19:41] just a man in a suit that's not just a
[1:19:42] man who told us about hunting and where
[1:19:45] he's been and he traveled from this city
[1:19:46] to that City there's more to that man
[1:19:49] than what I see
[1:19:52] that was God in that man that was Elohim
[1:19:55] in that man that was Christ in that man
[1:19:57] that was the Holy Spirit in that man
[1:20:00] that was the word the person of the word
[1:20:02] in that man
[1:20:04] you can pick any title you want you can
[1:20:06] use them
[1:20:07] but it was God and a man
[1:20:10] he said now Jesus Promised
[1:20:13] here that in the last days the son of
[1:20:15] man will be reviewed again to that same
[1:20:17] type of group The Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:20:19] just before the fire falls
[1:20:23] and I want you to watch
[1:20:25] what brother Banner says this is so
[1:20:28] important this is really the heart
[1:20:31] well one of the hearts of what I want to
[1:20:33] say one of my piles of paper on the desk
[1:20:36] now we'd say he's raised from the dead I
[1:20:39] didn't say it the word here said it they
[1:20:40] said he raised from the dead he says
[1:20:43] he's the same yesterday and forever you
[1:20:45] believe that
[1:20:46] he promised these things to happen in
[1:20:48] the last day that the same son of man
[1:20:51] would be made manifest remember that was
[1:20:54] not Jesus talking to Abraham there
[1:20:58] that could discern the thoughts and
[1:20:59] Sarah's mind behind him that was not
[1:21:01] Jesus he had not yet been born
[1:21:07] but it was a man in human flesh that
[1:21:09] Abraham called Elohim the great Almighty
[1:21:14] now
[1:21:17] this is interesting
[1:21:19] brother Branham says that that that was
[1:21:22] the revealing of the son of man that was
[1:21:24] the son of man being revealed amen back
[1:21:27] in in Abraham's day but it was Elohim
[1:21:29] come in a body of Flesh and it was God
[1:21:31] speaking to Abraham and he says he shows
[1:21:34] right back to that time just like it was
[1:21:36] in the days of Sodom Jesus Christ says
[1:21:38] the son of man will be revealed but we
[1:21:40] know that the son of man is Jesus Christ
[1:21:43] is that right you believe the son of man
[1:21:45] is Jesus Christ
[1:21:47] yes he called himself the son of man
[1:21:50] over and over and over again the son of
[1:21:52] man is Jesus Christ but brother Branham
[1:21:53] says that was not Jesus talking to
[1:21:56] Abraham there
[1:21:58] he says that is not Jesus he had not yet
[1:22:00] been born brother Branham is talking
[1:22:02] about the manifestation of the man of
[1:22:05] Flesh Jesus the flesh man hadn't been
[1:22:07] born yet what was it the same life that
[1:22:10] was going to come into Jesus amen was
[1:22:12] there that day and another body of Flesh
[1:22:15] what was it it was Elohim in a body of
[1:22:18] Flesh and Elohim and a body of Flesh was
[1:22:21] revealing a mystery to Abraham amen and
[1:22:25] in doing so he was Discerning the
[1:22:27] thoughts of Sarah and the tent behind
[1:22:29] him and also speaking of the destruction
[1:22:30] of Sodom at the time of Sodom brother
[1:22:33] bam said we've come back to all of these
[1:22:35] conditions amen what is it it's God
[1:22:37] again when Jesus Christ was standing
[1:22:40] here and he was Discerning the thoughts
[1:22:42] that were in the heart of the people
[1:22:43] that was the sign of the Messiah it was
[1:22:45] done to Abraham so long ago what was it
[1:22:48] the same Elohim that was in that body
[1:22:50] that went back to the elements was now
[1:22:52] in Jesus Christ
[1:22:55] is that right and now that word took on
[1:22:58] its name and so now it's Jesus Christ to
[1:23:00] say so you can say that wasn't Jesus it
[1:23:03] was Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:23:04] today and forever
[1:23:06] but it wasn't that one expression of
[1:23:09] that body of Flesh
[1:23:12] that was that was given 33 years upon
[1:23:15] the Earth
[1:23:17] but it was the same life
[1:23:21] that was not Jesus he had not yet been
[1:23:24] born
[1:23:25] but what was it it was Elohim
[1:23:29] what was he doing he was manifesting
[1:23:31] Christ
[1:23:32] was it Christ
[1:23:34] yes
[1:23:36] but it wasn't Jesus The Man from
[1:23:38] Nazareth yet
[1:23:39] he would get that name when he became a
[1:23:41] body of Flesh
[1:23:44] when he was born
[1:23:46] and Jesus says As it was in the days of
[1:23:49] Sodom
[1:23:50] now watch close
[1:23:52] in the days of Sodom so will it be at
[1:23:54] the coming of the son of man when the
[1:23:57] son of man is being revealed not no more
[1:24:00] as a church see not no more the bride is
[1:24:02] called see in that day the son of man
[1:24:04] will be revealed what to join the church
[1:24:07] to the Head unite the marriage of the
[1:24:09] Bride the bridegroom call will come
[1:24:11] right through this when the son of man
[1:24:14] will come down and come in human flesh
[1:24:17] to unite the two together
[1:24:20] that the son of man come down in human
[1:24:21] flesh and brother Banner's Ministry amen
[1:24:24] what was he coming to do the bridegroom
[1:24:26] call will come through this what's the
[1:24:28] bridegroom call come out and meet him
[1:24:30] amen the bridegroom cometh
[1:24:31] the Midnight Cry amen we've heard it
[1:24:34] amen now it's the son of man revealing
[1:24:36] himself through a son of man and when
[1:24:38] the son of man will come down and come
[1:24:40] in human flesh to do what to unite the
[1:24:42] two together
[1:24:44] the church has to be the word he is the
[1:24:46] word and the two unite together and to
[1:24:49] do that it'll take the manifestation of
[1:24:52] the revealing of the son of man
[1:24:55] not a clergyman do you see what I mean
[1:24:58] it's son of man Jesus Christ will come
[1:25:02] down in human flesh Among Us
[1:25:05] what's he typing it with back on the
[1:25:07] planes of memory but he said that wasn't
[1:25:09] Jesus he he's not saying that wasn't
[1:25:11] Jesus Christ the word what he's saying
[1:25:14] is it's not that body that was hanged on
[1:25:16] a cross it was another form it was
[1:25:18] Elohim prefiguring what would come later
[1:25:20] in another day
[1:25:24] that's why brother Ben said we don't
[1:25:26] look for nail prints we look for the
[1:25:28] word made manifest
[1:25:31] we don't want to get hung up and wait
[1:25:33] for another dispensation and miss our
[1:25:35] dispensation
[1:25:37] because who was it who was it standing
[1:25:40] on the platform Discerning the thoughts
[1:25:42] and hearts of the people
[1:25:44] it was Christ
[1:25:46] it was Christ
[1:25:47] it was Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:25:50] today and forever
[1:25:52] it was Elohim in another form
[1:25:56] it was the almighty self-existing God
[1:25:58] who was who was there before he was God
[1:26:01] then he became God but he was still
[1:26:03] Elohim
[1:26:04] then he became the word he was still
[1:26:06] Elohim amen as the word was expressed he
[1:26:08] was still Elohim
[1:26:11] and it was Elohim in that body of Flesh
[1:26:13] and it was still Elohim
[1:26:15] revealing himself to Abraham and now it
[1:26:18] was Elohim and Jesus Christ he's still
[1:26:20] Elohim he's expressing himself and now
[1:26:22] that same life amen that took on the
[1:26:25] name of Jesus Christ is there on the
[1:26:27] platform working in that Prophet to show
[1:26:30] us he's the same yesterday today and
[1:26:32] forever
[1:26:38] he will make his word so real that it'll
[1:26:42] unite the church in him as one the bride
[1:26:44] and then shall go home to the wedding
[1:26:46] supper
[1:26:47] she's already United said we go to the
[1:26:49] wedding supper not to the marriage so
[1:26:51] you fill your flesh self of the Flesh of
[1:26:53] the Mighty Men because the marriage of
[1:26:55] the Lamb has come but the Rapture is
[1:26:57] going to the wedding supper when the
[1:26:59] word here unites with the person and
[1:27:01] they too become one then what does it do
[1:27:05] then it manifests the son of man again
[1:27:09] the son of man was manifest in William
[1:27:12] Branham who was it it was Jesus Christ
[1:27:15] it was Elohim in a form manifesting
[1:27:18] himself so you would see whatever was on
[1:27:20] the plans of memory is here
[1:27:23] whatever was there in Jesus Christ when
[1:27:25] he walked by the Sea of Galilee is here
[1:27:27] it's the same person whatever form he
[1:27:30] takes it's the same one it's God
[1:27:34] and he's revealing himself showing the
[1:27:36] sign of the Messiah so that we would
[1:27:38] know who's present
[1:27:40] and he come to make his word so real
[1:27:42] that it'll unite the body and the head
[1:27:45] together as one to do what to manifest
[1:27:47] the son of man again
[1:27:49] Jesus Christ through you and I
[1:27:53] not the church theologians the son of
[1:27:55] man the word and the church becomes one
[1:27:58] whatever the son of man done he was the
[1:28:01] word the church does the same thing
[1:28:04] now this manifestation has come
[1:28:08] to unite
[1:28:10] the bride body you and I with the
[1:28:14] headship the person of the word to do
[1:28:17] what to manifest the son of man again
[1:28:19] which is what the life of Jesus Christ
[1:28:22] in you
[1:28:24] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:28:27] was he supposed to live what am I
[1:28:29] supposed to do am I supposed to get a
[1:28:31] tent am I supposed to go on a campaign
[1:28:32] I'm supposed to do healing Services no
[1:28:34] you're supposed to stay in your position
[1:28:35] and shine light
[1:28:37] you're supposed whatever amount of light
[1:28:39] he's given you whatever job and whatever
[1:28:41] correlation of the stars in whatever
[1:28:42] order whatever position you stay there
[1:28:45] and you shine the light of this word
[1:28:47] amen and Jesus Christ will be making
[1:28:49] himself appear unto people
[1:28:51] as he lives in you and I
[1:28:55] same one
[1:28:56] it's the same person it's the same
[1:28:59] Spirit that's been poured out without
[1:29:01] measure all that God was he poured into
[1:29:03] Christ all that Christ was he's poured
[1:29:05] into his church and in the end time
[1:29:07] whatever is held back the full fullness
[1:29:09] of the Holy Ghost has been released by
[1:29:11] the opening of the word to come back in
[1:29:13] the church so it's the full life of
[1:29:15] Jesus Christ it's Elohim in another form
[1:29:18] expressing himself
[1:29:21] that's the day that we live in
[1:29:26] and some people we we sometimes get hung
[1:29:30] up on the physical but he's there and
[1:29:32] he's not here and I haven't seen the
[1:29:34] nail Prince and and listen this is
[1:29:37] spiritual friends
[1:29:39] this is not like dividing up 70 parts of
[1:29:43] Moses spirit and put it on them I don't
[1:29:44] know how it worked but it worked amen I
[1:29:47] don't know how they got Moses spirit and
[1:29:48] prophesied like Moses amen because their
[1:29:50] names were written down but Moses still
[1:29:52] had Moses spirit and he still prophesied
[1:29:55] I don't know how it all works but I know
[1:29:57] one thing it works
[1:29:59] because we saw it work in that man
[1:30:05] and God's provided a place of worship he
[1:30:07] says but he promised just before the
[1:30:09] coming of the end time
[1:30:12] the world would get like it was in Sodom
[1:30:14] when a man come down in human form three
[1:30:16] of them two angels and God himself that
[1:30:19] was God
[1:30:20] and the Bible said it was now he come
[1:30:22] down and he manifests himself there by
[1:30:24] turning his back to the tent where Sarah
[1:30:25] was and told Abraham what Sarah was
[1:30:27] thinking in the tent that's right Jesus
[1:30:30] himself said at that day when the son of
[1:30:32] man is being revealed in other words the
[1:30:35] son of man the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:30:38] himself
[1:30:39] the church will come through
[1:30:40] justification through Luther through
[1:30:42] sanctification through Wesley through
[1:30:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the
[1:30:46] Pentecostals and go right on into the
[1:30:48] Perfection of the son of man that when
[1:30:50] husband and wife will be the same self
[1:30:53] persons
[1:30:55] where is Christ he's in his bride
[1:31:00] where is his bride well she's in Christ
[1:31:06] let's go to a scripture
[1:31:10] I don't feel like I'm doing a fair job
[1:31:12] to express this but let's go to a
[1:31:14] scripture in John John Chapter 3 The
[1:31:16] Gospel to John chapter 3.
[1:31:22] John chapter 3.
[1:31:33] and I'm going to go John chapter 3 verse
[1:31:35] 1.
[1:31:38] foreign
[1:31:42] there was a man of the Pharisees named
[1:31:45] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same
[1:31:48] came to Jesus by night and said in him
[1:31:49] Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[1:31:51] come from God for no man can do these
[1:31:53] Miracles that thou doest except God be
[1:31:55] with him
[1:31:56] Jesus answered and said unto him verily
[1:31:58] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[1:32:00] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:32:02] God so now Jesus is speaking a spiritual
[1:32:05] terms but Nicodemus being a regular
[1:32:07] human being like you and I he is
[1:32:10] absolutely confused by this term born
[1:32:12] again
[1:32:13] Nicodemus saying unto him how can a man
[1:32:15] be born when he is old can he enter the
[1:32:17] second time into his mother's womb and
[1:32:19] be born Jesus answered verily verily I
[1:32:21] say unto thee accept a man be born of
[1:32:23] water and of spirit he cannot enter the
[1:32:25] kingdom of God that which is born of the
[1:32:27] flesh is flesh that which is born of the
[1:32:30] spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said
[1:32:33] unto thee thou must be born again the
[1:32:35] wind bloweth where it listeth and thou
[1:32:37] Hearst the sound thereof but cast not
[1:32:39] tell whence it come and whether it goeth
[1:32:42] so is every one that is born of the
[1:32:44] spirit
[1:32:45] the spiritual birth is invisible
[1:32:48] it doesn't work like the physical birth
[1:32:51] and he says You must be born again and
[1:32:53] Nicodemus said he says how can a man
[1:32:55] when he's old be born again and through
[1:32:57] the second time in his mother's womb he
[1:32:59] says no be born of the spirit and it's
[1:33:01] like the wind the wind comes from
[1:33:03] somewhere and it goes somewhere you have
[1:33:05] no idea where it started and where it
[1:33:07] ended and you try to go go ask a
[1:33:09] meteorologist to tell you the starting
[1:33:11] point of wind
[1:33:13] on the earth and the ending point that
[1:33:16] wind started here on the map and it
[1:33:18] ended here on the map it works totally
[1:33:21] different than anything we understand I
[1:33:23] I don't know how it started I don't know
[1:33:25] where it ended but one thing we know is
[1:33:27] that when it blows through the tree I
[1:33:28] see the effect of it
[1:33:30] I see that the wind and you can say
[1:33:33] there is the wind you're not seeing the
[1:33:35] wind you're seeing the effect of the
[1:33:37] Wind
[1:33:38] and the effect of the wind lets you know
[1:33:40] that's where the wind is
[1:33:42] so he says so is everybody that's born
[1:33:44] of the spirit he that's born of the
[1:33:46] spirit you don't know where he came from
[1:33:48] you're not seeing where he's going
[1:33:49] because his life didn't start on this
[1:33:51] Earth his life started before and will
[1:33:53] continue beyond
[1:33:55] but what you're seeing in the spiritual
[1:33:57] birth amen is the birth has come to him
[1:34:00] amen and quickened the seed the part of
[1:34:02] him that was meant to be him from the
[1:34:03] beginning has come to life by coming
[1:34:05] encounter with the word for his day and
[1:34:08] now that part has started somewhere
[1:34:10] before and when it's like the wind
[1:34:13] and you can't see where a man starts and
[1:34:16] where he finishes but you can see the
[1:34:18] rustled of the leaves and say that's the
[1:34:19] wind right there and you can see the
[1:34:21] life that a person lives and say that's
[1:34:23] Jesus Christ in my brother and my sister
[1:34:27] that's the word
[1:34:29] so you must be born of the spirit
[1:34:34] and then verse 9 Nicodemus answers and
[1:34:36] saying unto him how can these things be
[1:34:39] Jesus answering is said unto him art
[1:34:41] thou master in Israel knoweth not these
[1:34:43] things listen Nicodemus to be a master
[1:34:46] in Israel knew some pretty complicated
[1:34:48] stuff
[1:34:49] he knew with timelines he knew
[1:34:52] genealogies he knew prophecies he knew
[1:34:55] he studied and he knew some pretty
[1:34:56] complicated stuff but but Jesus marveled
[1:34:59] that he didn't understand this simple
[1:35:00] thing
[1:35:01] now he must be born it's easy just be
[1:35:04] born of the spirit
[1:35:06] verse 10 Jesus answered and said in him
[1:35:08] our thou master in Israel knoweth not
[1:35:10] these things verily verily I say unto
[1:35:12] thee we speak that we do know and you
[1:35:15] then testify that we have seen and you
[1:35:17] receive not our Witness
[1:35:19] if I have told you Earthly things and
[1:35:21] you believe not how shall you believe if
[1:35:23] I tell you of you Heavenly things
[1:35:26] and no man hath Ascend it up to heaven
[1:35:28] but he that comes down from heaven even
[1:35:30] the son of man which is in heaven
[1:35:33] let's think about this for a minute
[1:35:36] Jesus Christ is the son of man is that
[1:35:38] right called himself son of man where
[1:35:40] was he he was on Earth
[1:35:43] no he was in heaven
[1:35:45] let's read it again I'm confused
[1:35:49] no man hath ascended up to heaven but he
[1:35:52] that came down from heaven even the son
[1:35:55] of man oh okay so he came down from
[1:35:57] heaven
[1:35:58] which is in heaven
[1:36:00] so did he come down from heaven or is he
[1:36:02] in heaven
[1:36:04] the answer again is yes
[1:36:06] you're all passing the test
[1:36:10] the spirit doesn't work like the natural
[1:36:12] the reason we're confused on the coming
[1:36:14] of the Lord is we are trying to
[1:36:16] understand it naturally physical by
[1:36:19] physical things and it's spiritual
[1:36:24] Jesus Christ is the son of man he says
[1:36:26] no man's ascended into heaven but he
[1:36:28] that's come down from heaven the son of
[1:36:30] man which is in heaven so has the son of
[1:36:33] man come down yes where was he he was
[1:36:35] there where was he in heaven how can he
[1:36:37] be there in heaven at the same time
[1:36:38] because heaven is not a physical Place
[1:36:40] Heaven is a dimension
[1:36:43] amen say brother explain it to me I
[1:36:46] can't explain it to you
[1:36:49] I don't understand but I know that Jesus
[1:36:52] was in heaven and standing on Earth but
[1:36:54] but we know that he come down from
[1:36:56] heaven he did he come down from heaven
[1:36:58] he said he come down from heaven we sing
[1:37:01] songs that he came down from heaven but
[1:37:03] he's telling you that though he came
[1:37:04] down from heaven he's still in heaven
[1:37:08] how can he be in heaven and come down
[1:37:09] from heaven because Jesus he's not
[1:37:12] worried about language and your
[1:37:13] understanding of language he just says
[1:37:15] it and by Revelation you have to catch
[1:37:18] it that it's true
[1:37:21] not only that but let's go to Colossians
[1:37:25] let's go to Colossians
[1:37:27] oh my God help us
[1:37:31] we are in so far over our heads
[1:37:34] because none of us can comprehend this
[1:37:36] intellectually
[1:37:38] but this is the reality
[1:37:40] this is the real reality what we've
[1:37:43] thought as reality is only a vapor a
[1:37:45] Mist a mirror it is not the reality this
[1:37:48] is only the negative not the positive we
[1:37:50] this is our reality but it is not the
[1:37:53] Ultimate Reality there's a greater
[1:37:55] reality than this reality and we're
[1:37:57] trying to understand the message in the
[1:37:59] Bible only by this limited reality
[1:38:01] you've got to tap into something that
[1:38:03] goes beyond the veil Amen to catch a
[1:38:05] revelation from God it's so much more
[1:38:08] than physical it's spiritual
[1:38:11] Colossians 3 and 1.
[1:38:18] Colossians three and one if ye then be
[1:38:20] risen with Christ seek those things
[1:38:22] which are above where Christ sitteth on
[1:38:24] the right hand of God
[1:38:26] set your affection on things above not
[1:38:28] on things on the earth for you are dead
[1:38:30] and your life is hid with Christ in God
[1:38:34] so Christ
[1:38:37] is in heaven
[1:38:40] but he promised to live with the
[1:38:42] Believers
[1:38:43] in the Believers
[1:38:46] and he tells us here that you're dead
[1:38:49] and your life is hid with Christ and God
[1:38:51] so Christ is in heaven and my life is
[1:38:55] hid with Christ so maybe I'm not even
[1:38:57] here
[1:38:59] maybe I'm in Christ
[1:39:01] in heaven
[1:39:04] or maybe I'm here
[1:39:07] is my life here or is my life in heaven
[1:39:11] the answer is yes
[1:39:13] let's go to Ephesians chapter 2.
[1:39:21] Ephesians chapter 2 verse 4.
[1:39:36] for God who is rich in Mercy
[1:39:39] for his great love we're with he loved
[1:39:41] us even when we were dead and sins hath
[1:39:43] he quickened us together with Christ by
[1:39:45] grace are you saved and hath raised us
[1:39:47] up together and made us sit together in
[1:39:49] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:39:51] amen
[1:39:53] so where are you at where is your life
[1:39:57] at my life is hid in Christ with God
[1:39:59] Amen and Christ is sitting on the right
[1:40:02] hand of the father and my my life is
[1:40:04] hidden him and I have resurrected with
[1:40:07] him and raised with him and I'm seated
[1:40:08] with him in Heavenly places right now
[1:40:12] but brother Chad you're crazy I'm
[1:40:14] looking right at you you're only looking
[1:40:16] at a physical thing that your eyes are
[1:40:18] picking up amen this is all frequency
[1:40:21] it's all moving amen at a certain
[1:40:23] frequency if you were if if you were
[1:40:26] moving at a different frequency you
[1:40:27] wouldn't even see me
[1:40:31] I know I'm blowing so many Minds I'm
[1:40:33] blowing my own mind
[1:40:36] if I was I mean there's there's all
[1:40:38] kinds of ultraviolet
[1:40:40] there's all kinds of rays in the light
[1:40:42] spectrum that's moving through this and
[1:40:44] you can't see it
[1:40:46] because it's moving at a different speed
[1:40:47] but if you move at the same speed that
[1:40:50] that's moving then you see it it becomes
[1:40:51] visible to you
[1:40:52] so what we think is reality is not
[1:40:55] reality God's word is reality God is
[1:40:58] reality all those things that go beyond
[1:41:01] human comprehension are your ability to
[1:41:03] touch it taste it feel it that's why it
[1:41:05] has to be apprehended by faith and that
[1:41:07] faith can only come by God
[1:41:12] so the question is
[1:41:15] am I here
[1:41:18] or am I there
[1:41:21] and it's funny because when I say there
[1:41:22] I point like this but
[1:41:24] I don't know exactly
[1:41:26] where there is
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:31] but the I want to ask you
[1:41:34] am I here
[1:41:36] expressing The Life of Christ through a
[1:41:39] c Gene that God's quick in their life
[1:41:40] yes I am here
[1:41:42] manifesting in this dimension the next
[1:41:45] question is am I in heaven seated with
[1:41:48] Christ Jesus the answer is yes
[1:41:51] so I am here and I am there and I don't
[1:41:54] know if here and there is the same exact
[1:41:56] place I don't know
[1:41:58] but all I know is there's more to me
[1:42:01] than what you see and we are not limited
[1:42:03] by physical laws physical properties all
[1:42:06] these that's only the limitation that
[1:42:08] this body is under in a certain
[1:42:10] dispensation in a certain period of time
[1:42:11] to express a certain part of God's
[1:42:13] character
[1:42:15] so it's limited it's bound but the life
[1:42:18] on the inside is not bound
[1:42:20] it's free
[1:42:22] so I am here and I am there
[1:42:25] Jesus was here and he was there
[1:42:29] and the question is where is Jesus
[1:42:31] Christ now
[1:42:34] if it's been true and every other day it
[1:42:35] can be true he can be there and here
[1:42:39] is that right
[1:42:40] he can be there in here
[1:42:44] praise God
[1:42:45] I don't know how else to describe it may
[1:42:48] God give greater revelation
[1:42:51] and the choosing of a bride he says the
[1:42:52] other is pregnated by the word of God
[1:42:54] and will bring forth the finished body
[1:42:57] of Jesus Christ which is the bride the
[1:42:59] body of Christ isn't finished yet how
[1:43:01] many knows that a man and a woman is one
[1:43:03] and Christ is one body the word the
[1:43:05] bride will have to be the rest of that
[1:43:07] body and the two together make one body
[1:43:10] again like Adam was at the beginning man
[1:43:12] his wife are one so Christ is uniting
[1:43:15] with his body they are becoming one body
[1:43:18] amen where is that body Apostle Paul
[1:43:21] says ye are the body of Christ that body
[1:43:25] is here present he's present with the
[1:43:28] body
[1:43:29] it's his body a further expression of
[1:43:32] himself
[1:43:34] amen
[1:43:36] well how can the Bride come
[1:43:38] and fail to manifest everything that was
[1:43:40] promised of him
[1:43:41] and the groom come and he wouldn't be
[1:43:44] the bride
[1:43:47] read that again
[1:43:49] how can the Bride come and fail to
[1:43:50] manifest everything was promised of him
[1:43:53] and the groom come
[1:43:55] so the
[1:43:56] is the groom coming
[1:43:58] did the groom come
[1:44:01] did the ministry of the son of man in
[1:44:03] the end time what was the son of man to
[1:44:05] do to make the word so real that it will
[1:44:06] unite the two together
[1:44:08] the bridegroom and the bride did the
[1:44:10] groom come
[1:44:12] and and the groom come and he wouldn't
[1:44:15] be the bride
[1:44:18] so when the groom comes
[1:44:20] what does he look like
[1:44:22] when the groom comes what are we looking
[1:44:25] for
[1:44:27] when the groom comes to unite when the
[1:44:29] head comes to the body and the groom
[1:44:30] comes to unite with the with the bride
[1:44:32] what does he come like he comes and he
[1:44:37] wouldn't be the bride what is he Jesus
[1:44:40] Christ and the formation of the Bride
[1:44:46] things that are to be if we are those
[1:44:49] attributes of God we cannot live by
[1:44:51] Creeds we cannot live by
[1:44:52] denominationalism we must live by the
[1:44:55] word because the bride is part of the
[1:44:57] bridegroom like like any wife is part of
[1:45:00] her husband therefore we must be that
[1:45:02] word bride and what is the word bride
[1:45:04] the manifestation of this hour the bride
[1:45:07] not a Creed or denomination but a living
[1:45:09] Oracle of God a living attribute of God
[1:45:11] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:45:13] of God in the formation of the Bride
[1:45:16] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[1:45:19] we're now living
[1:45:20] how could the groom come and not be the
[1:45:23] bride
[1:45:24] I says why brother Benham said we don't
[1:45:26] look for nail scars
[1:45:28] we look for the word made manifest
[1:45:30] where is Jesus Christ is he there yes is
[1:45:32] he here yes
[1:45:34] explain it I don't know
[1:45:37] I can't
[1:45:39] but he's poured all that God was he
[1:45:42] poured into Christ
[1:45:43] and all that Christ was he's poured into
[1:45:46] this end time bride
[1:45:48] I can't explain it but I want to live it
[1:45:52] I may not be able to comprehend the
[1:45:54] intellectual I may not be able to graph
[1:45:55] it on a piece of paper but I want the
[1:45:57] full effect of that to take effect in my
[1:46:00] life
[1:46:01] I want the fullness of the word to
[1:46:03] manifest through me and I want to be
[1:46:05] changed by the life that's here to
[1:46:07] change me
[1:46:08] and I want to display whatever he is I
[1:46:11] want him to be that through me
[1:46:15] in future home brother Adam says if you
[1:46:18] are the bride
[1:46:19] the bride is part of the husband
[1:46:22] and the only place that you ever
[1:46:24] recognize is to recognize what part of
[1:46:26] the husband that word you are or you
[1:46:29] can't recognize being the bride how many
[1:46:31] sees that you have to recognize your
[1:46:35] position
[1:46:37] but the man says there's a he's telling
[1:46:39] telling us that you have to recognize
[1:46:41] your position
[1:46:43] you have to know where you are
[1:46:45] we're not a denomination we're not stuck
[1:46:48] in denominational understanding we're
[1:46:51] not in the church ages as far as living
[1:46:53] that kind of church-aged life and church
[1:46:55] age dispensation
[1:46:56] where are we we're all the way up into
[1:46:59] the headship the very mind of Christ has
[1:47:01] been given to us
[1:47:02] and when you know what part you are amen
[1:47:06] it brings an identification to who we
[1:47:08] are and that identification brings a
[1:47:11] life
[1:47:12] remember before Moses you know knew what
[1:47:16] he was he thought he was something but
[1:47:18] then he kind of lost that what his
[1:47:21] mother had taught him he lost it but
[1:47:22] when he come in contact with the Living
[1:47:24] God the pillar of fire that Pillar of
[1:47:26] Fire reconfirmed and told him who he
[1:47:29] really was and who he really was had to
[1:47:32] be made manifest and now that life began
[1:47:35] to live he began to live the life of the
[1:47:38] Redeemer
[1:47:39] Mary she thought that she was a regular
[1:47:42] person living a regular life amen but an
[1:47:44] angel came and gave her identify a
[1:47:46] different identification when she got
[1:47:48] that identification she received the
[1:47:50] Life of Christ
[1:47:51] and when she did it manifest Christ
[1:47:56] understand the day we live in
[1:47:59] and we recognize our
[1:48:01] then there's a power that comes with
[1:48:03] position and God can live his life
[1:48:06] through us
[1:48:08] let me read one quote out of Christ as
[1:48:09] the mystery of God revealed
[1:48:11] and when the word moves on down into the
[1:48:14] body from the head what is it the same
[1:48:16] word nothing can be added or taken from
[1:48:19] it so that same word moves from the head
[1:48:21] as the day comes close down into the
[1:48:23] body down into the body vindicating that
[1:48:26] they are one
[1:48:27] they are husband and wife they're flesh
[1:48:30] of his flesh word of his word life of
[1:48:32] his life Spirit of a spirit amen how do
[1:48:35] you know it Bears the same record same
[1:48:37] fruit same word same manifest same
[1:48:40] manifest Christ see manifest Christ same
[1:48:43] life same God Same Spirit same word same
[1:48:46] book amen same signs things that I do
[1:48:49] show you also oh Hallelujah my notice
[1:48:53] the Vindicated word in his body is his
[1:48:57] victory and the reason of his death
[1:49:02] think about it
[1:49:04] why did Christ die
[1:49:07] to redeem the lost to redeem what was
[1:49:10] Fallen what was separated from why did
[1:49:11] he die to bring back to God
[1:49:14] the attributes of God that were
[1:49:16] separated out
[1:49:18] why did he have to do that
[1:49:20] I mean because all the way back in the
[1:49:22] Garden of Eden amen Adam was
[1:49:26] but part of himself was put into the
[1:49:28] woman and that woman fell and he went
[1:49:30] with her to redeem her causing all of
[1:49:32] mankind to be lost so what what was
[1:49:35] Calvary all about Calvary was all about
[1:49:38] redeeming back what was Fallen to United
[1:49:40] with the bridegroom again to return it
[1:49:43] back to Eden
[1:49:45] that's why when we receive the life of
[1:49:48] Jesus Christ and let that life through
[1:49:51] flow through US amen that is his victory
[1:49:55] and think about think about Moses when
[1:49:59] Moses now knew his position and he
[1:50:01] stepped into his god-given position amen
[1:50:04] there was nothing on earth that could
[1:50:06] stop Moses
[1:50:07] Moses was Unstoppable because he was in
[1:50:11] his position
[1:50:12] because how can you stop God it was God
[1:50:15] and Moses
[1:50:16] that's why when brother Brandon was here
[1:50:18] showing the sign of the Messiah he
[1:50:20] seemed Unstoppable amen nobody could
[1:50:22] nobody could stand in that presence
[1:50:24] without being exposed amen it worked
[1:50:26] night after night after night why
[1:50:27] because he was in his position doing
[1:50:29] what he had to do to call out a bride
[1:50:33] so there's power in position and power
[1:50:35] and understanding when we get into our
[1:50:37] position there is nothing in this world
[1:50:40] that can stop us from manifesting the
[1:50:42] portion of the Life of Christ that's in
[1:50:43] your life
[1:50:45] that's why when we know who we are we
[1:50:47] know our position this is the hour that
[1:50:50] he's living in a many-membered body this
[1:50:52] is Jesus Christ in the form of his bride
[1:50:54] and God has given me a portion of this
[1:50:56] life to live and anything that would
[1:50:58] hinder me from living that Life of
[1:51:00] Christ has got to go it cannot stop God
[1:51:03] from coming forth
[1:51:05] that's why whether it's a husband a wife
[1:51:07] a mother a father an employee whatever
[1:51:09] it is that you're doing if you're in if
[1:51:11] you're in the channel of God living the
[1:51:13] life that God's called you to live and
[1:51:15] there's something there to stop that
[1:51:16] expression that thing has got to go
[1:51:18] nothing could stand before Moses amen as
[1:51:21] Moses was doing what God wanted him to
[1:51:23] do
[1:51:25] and nothing could stand before you and I
[1:51:27] if we stay in our position
[1:51:30] and manifest the life of God
[1:51:33] we have faith to pray for our healing
[1:51:36] how do you have faith to pray for your
[1:51:37] healing because if it's hindering me
[1:51:38] expressing Christ I can pray for my
[1:51:40] healing
[1:51:41] because I'm not here just for myself I'm
[1:51:44] not here just by myself and I'm not here
[1:51:46] just for myself but by a revelation
[1:51:48] God's given this hour I've been planted
[1:51:50] here by the Eternal will of God and the
[1:51:53] predestinated plan of God and I'm here
[1:51:55] for a purpose and I must live that
[1:51:57] purpose
[1:51:58] and if anything would stop that purpose
[1:52:00] I I just I just believe it's got to go
[1:52:04] because I'm not here for myself
[1:52:07] I'm here to be an expression of Christ
[1:52:11] man let's all stand
[1:52:15] I pray that God will just put those
[1:52:17] pieces together
[1:52:19] there's so much there that I just can't
[1:52:22] just can't get my fingers around it's
[1:52:25] Beyond The Human Side there's a living
[1:52:27] reality
[1:52:29] but I pray that God would open up to you
[1:52:32] the possibilities
[1:52:34] musicians if you could come
[1:52:36] Blake if you could come
[1:52:39] I just pray that we no longer view
[1:52:42] things through natural eyes anymore
[1:52:44] that we don't limit just what we see
[1:52:47] there is no limitation what is the
[1:52:50] limitation
[1:52:51] there is no limitation because it's God
[1:52:54] now living his life through us
[1:52:57] we're not limited by what we can touch
[1:52:59] we're not limited by what we can see I
[1:53:02] mean when when Philip was expressed in
[1:53:04] Christ he wasn't even limited by the
[1:53:06] distance he could travel on horse or
[1:53:07] Chariot or foot
[1:53:09] why he wasn't living for himself he
[1:53:12] wasn't living by himself he was there to
[1:53:14] express a portion of the Life of Christ
[1:53:16] amen and when God had need of him to go
[1:53:18] from here to there there was no
[1:53:19] limitation
[1:53:21] don't be limited in prayer life don't
[1:53:24] think now I've got to go I've got to
[1:53:25] walk over to a certain place and I've
[1:53:27] got to kneel down and fold my hands a
[1:53:29] certain way listen you're already seated
[1:53:31] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:53:33] Christ is in you and you're in Christ
[1:53:35] where are you I don't know I'm in him
[1:53:39] where is he at the right hand of the
[1:53:41] father
[1:53:42] he's in heaven I'm in heaven
[1:53:46] but I'm here
[1:53:47] and he's here
[1:53:50] so there must be a link behind this veil
[1:53:53] of Flesh between me and Heaven
[1:53:55] there must be a conduit an Open Door a
[1:53:58] channel there must be a portal between
[1:54:00] two dimensions
[1:54:02] now we're talking science fiction amen
[1:54:05] if any of you ever grew up with the
[1:54:07] science they're they're in the soul of
[1:54:09] the children of God there there's a
[1:54:12] portal I don't know what else to say
[1:54:13] listen I can't tell you if I got it
[1:54:15] right or wrong all I know is there's a
[1:54:17] reality here
[1:54:19] there's a portal down inside of you amen
[1:54:22] that that is a doorway in the heaven
[1:54:24] you're in heaven and you're here you're
[1:54:26] straddling two Dimensions at the same
[1:54:28] time you're not doing it with your shoes
[1:54:30] and the leather and the clothes but
[1:54:32] something spiritual is there something
[1:54:34] natural is here and that's spiritual
[1:54:36] from there is living in the natural here
[1:54:38] and moving it in the plan of God
[1:54:42] and I want to stop thinking about one
[1:54:44] day I'll get over there and I'm here and
[1:54:46] he's there and I hope that he can come
[1:54:49] here
[1:54:52] you know so many times we want to call
[1:54:55] God on the scene when we get into
[1:54:56] trouble and say oh God come from heaven
[1:54:58] and help me he's in you
[1:55:01] he's only as far away as we place him
[1:55:04] amen and you can see how this mentality
[1:55:06] makes it so hard for us to overcome
[1:55:08] because we started thinking that I'm way
[1:55:10] down here and God's way up there and I'm
[1:55:13] in the pit in the middle of trouble and
[1:55:15] I need a God from a far-off distance to
[1:55:17] travel a long ways and come down and
[1:55:19] help me out and what we do is we start
[1:55:22] damaging our own faith because we're
[1:55:24] believing for the wrong thing
[1:55:27] but when we tap into this reality and
[1:55:30] recognize that it's him that's in me
[1:55:32] amen even if it's a teaspoon of God it
[1:55:36] has all the ingredients of God inside of
[1:55:38] me and whatever he was he always is he's
[1:55:41] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:55:45] and if Jesus Christ is in me if
[1:55:47] yesterday he could part water
[1:55:49] if he could walk on water if he could
[1:55:51] break bread he can still do it
[1:55:56] I don't want to put him far away
[1:55:59] I don't want to put him in the past and
[1:56:01] I don't want to put him in the future
[1:56:04] where is Christ he's in me
[1:56:09] is he in you
[1:56:12] is he in you is he in you
[1:56:15] the spirit that was in Christ has been
[1:56:17] pulled out in full measure into his
[1:56:19] bride
[1:56:21] did that leave him anything
[1:56:25] he's still Christ
[1:56:27] he's still the person of Jesus Christ
[1:56:30] but she's the fullness of his word the
[1:56:33] full expression the full life is in her
[1:56:38] I don't know how it works but I believe
[1:56:41] it
[1:56:42] and I want to live like I believe it
[1:56:46] I want to live in the midst of tragedy
[1:56:49] that I can just say God help me and see
[1:56:52] the supernatural work around me
[1:56:54] I want to live in faith where I know
[1:56:57] that wherever he takes me wherever he
[1:56:58] leads me wherever life takes me that I
[1:57:01] know everything will work out because
[1:57:02] I'm not here of my own and I'm not here
[1:57:04] for myself
[1:57:06] that there's somebody else that's living
[1:57:08] through me and if I can keep surrender
[1:57:11] to that and he can move me in his path
[1:57:13] then everything that would hinder that
[1:57:15] has to get out of the way
[1:57:16] and every time I come into an obstacle
[1:57:19] now it's either it's another way for God
[1:57:21] to manifest his word it's another way
[1:57:23] for God to either turn me display him
[1:57:25] he's doing something I haven't lost God
[1:57:28] every time I get in trouble
[1:57:32] I want to live with faith in who I am
[1:57:35] and who he is
[1:57:38] so many things Jesus speaks that are
[1:57:41] absolutely so contrary to understanding
[1:57:44] I mean he begins to speak in the Book of
[1:57:46] John he says if I go away I must go away
[1:57:48] and I will send you another comforter
[1:57:51] I have to go so he can come
[1:57:54] but I'll come to you
[1:57:58] so
[1:57:59] is the comforter going to come or is
[1:58:01] Jesus going to come
[1:58:02] and then Jesus will say Amen if you
[1:58:05] believe in me then my father and I will
[1:58:07] take up our Abode in thee yeah
[1:58:09] so now I mean you you've got three
[1:58:12] Spirits in you the spirit of Christ the
[1:58:14] spirit of God and the spirit of the
[1:58:15] comforter
[1:58:17] unless they're all the same
[1:58:21] so have you received the spirit of the
[1:58:23] word or the spirit of Christ
[1:58:25] or have you received the spirit of God
[1:58:29] it's the same
[1:58:31] and whatever it's done before it can do
[1:58:33] today
[1:58:36] I
[1:58:38] listen I am here Made Alive by the
[1:58:41] spirit
[1:58:42] Quicken this flesh has been quickened to
[1:58:45] live the word by the spirit of him that
[1:58:47] raised up Christ from the dead I'm here
[1:58:50] something in my soul is alive
[1:58:53] but I'm also somewhere else
[1:58:56] at the same time
[1:58:59] God help us
[1:59:00] help us to break out of the natural
[1:59:03] into the Supernatural and live
[1:59:06] Supernatural lives in human flesh
[1:59:10] let's bow our heads
[1:59:13] your lord Jesus
[1:59:15] I pray God that you would come on the
[1:59:17] scene in each of our hearts
[1:59:20] and Quicken this word to a reality Lord
[1:59:25] God I as a human being have failed
[1:59:28] completely failed to express
[1:59:31] the fullness of this thought
[1:59:33] the depth and the reality of this true
[1:59:36] revelation
[1:59:39] God I don't know that any man can
[1:59:43] but God
[1:59:44] you can bring the reality alive in each
[1:59:47] of us
[1:59:49] God I pray that you would help everybody
[1:59:51] that's here today myself included
[1:59:54] help us to stop the limited thinking
[1:59:58] help us to stop putting you off
[2:00:01] putting you far away putting you in the
[2:00:04] future
[2:00:05] but God help us start living
[2:00:07] [Music]
[2:00:08] as if eternity is now
[2:00:12] for it truly is
[2:00:15] God lived through each one of us
[2:00:16] manifest yourself in US
[2:00:19] God I'm not
[2:00:21] I don't want to be guilty of waiting
[2:00:24] for something to come when it's already
[2:00:26] come
[2:00:28] I don't want to be waiting for something
[2:00:30] to open when it's already open
[2:00:33] God I don't want to live below my
[2:00:35] privileges and I don't want to live as
[2:00:36] though I'm not a believer
[2:00:39] God I want to live to the full life of
[2:00:41] this word
[2:00:43] with the full expression that's
[2:00:44] available
[2:00:46] God we can live you've called us to live
[2:00:49] above sin
[2:00:51] above the desire of the world above the
[2:00:54] desire of this flesh you've called us so
[2:00:56] much higher
[2:00:58] God come and help us to live that
[2:01:01] God I pray that you would just flow
[2:01:03] through us and to others
[2:01:05] that we can boy be that final voice to
[2:01:08] the final age that you can use our lips
[2:01:11] however frail they may be
[2:01:13] that you can use our bodies however
[2:01:15] whatever they may be male or female
[2:01:18] young or old it's inconsequential
[2:01:20] it's not the body we're looking at it's
[2:01:22] the life on the inside
[2:01:25] God live your life through these vessels
[2:01:28] of clay
[2:01:29] and help us to express you day by day
[2:01:31] and to prophesy again
[2:01:34] help us to be witness Lord that you're
[2:01:36] alive for your living in US
[2:01:39] God I pray that you would do the final
[2:01:40] work that you've left for this time
[2:01:43] that you would do it through each one of
[2:01:44] us
[2:01:46] but I love him
[2:01:47] I thank you for your word it is so rich
[2:01:50] these things in the spiritual that we've
