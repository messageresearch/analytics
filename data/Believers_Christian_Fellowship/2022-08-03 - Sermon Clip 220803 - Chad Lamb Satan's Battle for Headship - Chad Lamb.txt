TRANSCRIPT
========================================
david wasn't looking at his eyes the only thing he heard when when that philistine boasted was a challenge against the word of god everybody else saw a challenge against their person and they saw themselves versus goliath david saw god versus goliath this is why it's good to know who you are and whose side you're on and who's in you amen to know that you're a child of god standing for the word of god if you don't have that settled you'll never win a battle because you're looking at yourself versus this devil you're looking at yourself versus this sickness yourself versus this situation amen but when you realize that something contrary to the word is coming and challenging the word in your life challenging whether this word is true or not challenging whether or not he's the same yesterday today forever challenging whether or not he already paid for healing when he died on calvary challenging whether or not biased stripes are already healed when you think it's you amen fighting against this challenge amen you'll do the same thing the israelites do hide out in the tent and hope it goes away but if we can go like david and say i have been i mean i am a part of the circumcision i'm part of israel i'm part of the chosen i have a seal of god in my life and furthermore i've been anointed for this day amen because the anointing is on the bride to overcome in this day so i've been anointed to the word i mean i've been anointed to defy the armies of the enemy and when something comes in i don't have to run and hide and hope it goes away all i need to do is say amen the god who's delivered me from this and deliver me from that and deliver me from this will deliver me from this also because it's nothing more than a challenge against the word of god and i'm here representing the word of god i am a representative of the very manifested word of god and this philistine this demon is challenging the word of god not challenging me as a person david as a person was no match for goliath as a person and you as a human being are no match for a devil these devils have been around amen for thousands and thousands of years amen their chief captain is perfect in wisdom they have been deceiving mankind for thousands of years you and your intellect are zero match for a devil that's why you can't look at yourself and fight an enemy you can't you can't take the devil's challenge and withstand him when you look at yourself you have to see that this devil is attacking the word of god that's supposed to be manifesting in my flesh because god wants his word on display and he wants it on display in his body and you have to know where that body is who that body is and know that you're a member of that body and if you know that you're a member of that body now it's not you fighting the devil amen it's the word of god through you fighting that devil
