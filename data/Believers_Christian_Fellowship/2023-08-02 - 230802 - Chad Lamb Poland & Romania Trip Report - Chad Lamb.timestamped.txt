[4:53] [Applause]
[4:57] will give the glory to Jesus
[5:05] wonderful
[5:12] you may be seated
[5:14] it's good to be back
[5:16] and just wanted to tell a little bit
[5:18] about our trip tonight also
[5:20] and uh
[5:22] it was a long 12 days but it was worth
[5:26] it
[5:27] was good to see the the Saints
[5:29] and uh it's it's very interesting you
[5:33] know when you go and you see the
[5:34] different languages and the different
[5:36] cultures and things but
[5:39] there's always you know the one thing
[5:40] that brings us together it's the word of
[5:42] the hour and it's so nice to see how
[5:44] they worship and uh you know just their
[5:48] whole lifestyle and when they sing they
[5:50] really sing they put their whole heart
[5:51] into it and uh
[5:53] when we headed out I know we were having
[5:56] a heat wave here and also we were
[5:59] supposed to heat be a heat wave over
[6:00] there in Romania too and so uh
[6:03] at the campgrounds it was in a tent they
[6:05] had a set of tent up so it had been very
[6:07] very hot it would have been 90 95
[6:09] degrees in that tent and they had
[6:11] between five and six hundred people
[6:14] but uh we were praying that the Lord
[6:17] would take care of it and he did we had
[6:19] a thunderstorm roll through the night
[6:21] before and it stormed and then
[6:24] the temperatures from there on hour like
[6:26] 75 degrees during the day and 55 at
[6:28] night so it was very nice a wonderful
[6:31] time
[6:33] there was um I think four people that
[6:36] got baptized
[6:38] after the morning services
[6:40] they had a nice mountain river that ran
[6:43] right through there and so they would
[6:44] just go back behind the cabins there in
[6:46] the river and baptize the people so it
[6:48] was really nice
[6:51] we started out in the Poland
[6:55] I think we uh four or five days in
[6:57] Poland I think brother Chad preached
[7:00] four times in six days
[7:02] when we first got there
[7:04] um
[7:06] I felt bad for them they kept adding
[7:07] days and adding days you know he looked
[7:09] on his phone and they would say brother
[7:11] we want you to take the first three
[7:13] services
[7:14] and then they'd add another one and add
[7:16] another one and a thing before he got
[7:18] done he preached nine times
[7:20] and then and because I think you know
[7:23] three days of travel we were gone 12
[7:25] days so he you know he preached quite a
[7:28] bit
[7:29] and I think the one Saturday morning he
[7:31] preached three consecutive Services
[7:33] preached the morning service we took an
[7:36] hour break for lunch and then they come
[7:37] back and he had to preach to the couples
[7:40] right after the couples they moved the
[7:42] couples out of the tent and then moved
[7:44] the ministers in the tent and he
[7:45] preached to them for about an hour and a
[7:47] half so it was quite quite the day
[7:50] so I'm sure he's quite worn out but he
[7:53] was a blessing to the people
[7:55] and a lot of the Saints they they send
[7:58] their greetings to you and you wouldn't
[8:00] believe how many people stream in and
[8:02] they want to thank the musicians a lot
[8:04] of them say tell you musicians uh you
[8:07] know thank you they enjoy the music
[8:09] and a lot of them the services they
[8:12] stream our services constantly and
[8:14] Romanian I think there's almost eight to
[8:16] ten different countries that were there
[8:19] from Spain to Hungary to Czech Republic
[8:22] Moldova
[8:25] Romania
[8:27] Germany
[8:29] I know I'm forgetting some but they're
[8:31] all all UK and they all came and it's
[8:35] amazing how they can even though there's
[8:37] a language barrier but they figure it
[8:39] out somehow
[8:40] you know they may know a little bit of
[8:42] Romanian or they may know a little bit
[8:44] of Polish but there's you know it's
[8:46] being translated from English
[8:48] the Polish and in Romanian
[8:52] but like the people from Hungary they
[8:54] don't understand any of it
[8:55] so their pastor
[8:57] will listen to the English because he
[9:00] understands English and they'll put a
[9:02] headset on and he will speak it so his
[9:04] congregation can hear
[9:06] or his little flock that he brought so
[9:08] they can hear it in Hungarian
[9:11] but it's really something to see the
[9:14] different
[9:15] bride around the world
[9:19] so I don't want to take too much brother
[9:22] Chad will cover the rest of it

[13:14] give us understanding that you would
[13:16] give us Lord the heart to perceive all
[13:18] that you want to share with us today

[13:24] glorified in all we say and do for we
[13:26] love you Lord we want to lift you on
[13:29] high we want to give you the preeminence
[13:31] that you deserve

[13:34] every way
[13:35] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[13:39] amen God bless you while you're standing
[13:41] let's turn to Proverbs chapter 25 and we
[13:43] read one scripture and then we'll let
[13:46] you be seated and we'll do a bit of a
[13:47] trip report
[13:48] it is certainly very good to be home
[13:51] Amen brother Jonathan and I arrived at
[13:54] about 1 30 a.m this morning and slept a
[13:57] few hours and we've had a good day so we
[14:00] thank God for taking care of us giving
[14:01] us energy and strength and I've been
[14:03] excited to get to this point in the day
[14:05] to see everyone once again Proverbs
[14:08] chapter 25
[14:11] let's read this one scripture verse 25
[14:13] Proverbs 25 and 25.
[14:16] as cold Waters to a thirsty Soul so is
[14:19] good news from a far country man God
[14:22] bless you as you take your seats amen
[14:24] I've I've read that scripture numerous
[14:27] times and a trip report as we come back
[14:29] but it's always the same it's true amen
[14:32] no matter how many times we read it it
[14:34] doesn't change the fact that it's true
[14:35] amen good news from a far country is
[14:40] refreshing amen
[14:42] and then we're going to get into a bit
[14:45] of a trip report and I'll share just a
[14:47] few Thoughts with you from the word as
[14:49] we go into that but first I want to
[14:50] bring greetings from everyone to
[14:52] everyone else there was just too many
[14:54] names to list from too many to to to you
[14:57] all amen then brother Jonathan shared
[15:00] some of that but especially from brother
[15:02] yatzik brother Samuel those Brothers
[15:05] who've been here before brother Nathan
[15:07] they really want to send greetings to
[15:09] all of you all of their friends all the
[15:10] familiar faces God bless you all and
[15:12] like Jonathan was sharing so many wanted
[15:16] to express their thanks and gratitude to
[15:18] the whole congregation they just
[15:19] appreciate the whole body here
[15:21] especially the song leaders and the
[15:23] musicians they numerous people wanted us
[15:26] to thank the song leaders and the
[15:27] musicians and I just want to say thank
[15:29] you and God bless you for all that you
[15:31] do it's a blessing to all of us we've
[15:34] known it for so long we appreciated
[15:35] every service but it's also affecting
[15:38] the lives of others and it's been
[15:40] encouragement and a blessing to them and
[15:42] so yeah this has been uh this has been a
[15:45] good trip it was a very very tiring trip
[15:47] very tiring trip and I was so thankful
[15:51] that brother Jonathan was able to come
[15:52] along uh instantly when I decided that I
[15:55] would come to Romania which was a trip
[15:57] that had been canceled a couple times we
[15:59] were supposed to go but had been
[16:00] canceled a couple times I instantly
[16:03] thought of brother Jonathan because you
[16:05] may or may not know some of you may know
[16:06] but sister Irina was born in Romania and
[16:10] so that's her birthplace her father was
[16:14] responsible for translating a multitude
[16:17] of of sermons into Romanian he was the
[16:19] main translator for years for voice of
[16:21] God into the Romanian language so
[16:23] everybody there knows her family and
[16:26] she's famous which made brother Jonathan
[16:28] famous he was he was famous by proxy
[16:31] Association amen and also sister irina's
[16:35] brother does the voiceovers for the
[16:37] tapes so he's the Romanian voice of
[16:40] brother Branham in Romania so they all
[16:43] know her brother they all know her
[16:44] father and know the family so it was
[16:46] very fitting but brother Jonathan would
[16:48] join in and and he made so many
[16:50] connections and so many people knew of
[16:53] her family so it was a lot of fun to
[16:55] have him along and and people really lit
[16:57] up when he told him who he was married
[16:59] to and who her family was and so brother
[17:02] brother Jonathan you're gonna have to
[17:04] take your wife they're all waiting for
[17:05] her to come
[17:06] so hopefully you get a chance to go back
[17:10] amen we want to thank everybody who was
[17:13] praying for us it was really needed I
[17:16] can I can tell you that I needed it but
[17:18] God came through and it was a huge
[17:20] blessing I just there was there was
[17:23] almost like a supernatural strength if I
[17:25] could say it that way something that is
[17:27] just beyond human ability and I know it
[17:29] was the saints that were praying and
[17:31] many of you sent a little text a note
[17:33] dropped a little note and I want to say
[17:35] thank you I appreciate that very very
[17:37] much it warmed my heart made me feel
[17:39] good to know that those were remembering
[17:41] to pray and they dropped a little note
[17:43] or said something in a text I would say
[17:45] God bless you all each one who did that
[17:47] and all who didn't text I know there's
[17:49] many praying as well and it was a real
[17:52] blessing to me to brother Jonathan we
[17:54] appreciated it the trip went really well
[17:56] all the flights all the exchanges
[17:58] everything went fantastic and so I thank
[18:02] God for that also I want to thank the
[18:04] brothers who preached here while I was
[18:06] gone on the flight back we had a long
[18:08] flight back across the ocean and I had a
[18:11] chance to listen to all three sermons in
[18:13] a row and I was blessed by each one of
[18:15] them it was an absolute blessing I'm so
[18:18] thankful for the brothers who were able
[18:19] to take the services and I mean I missed
[18:22] them when they were priest here but I
[18:24] got to listen to them back to back and
[18:26] that was really special amen they all
[18:28] were feeding off one another was quite a
[18:31] blessing appreciated brother John Kadima
[18:33] coming back and sharing what the Lords
[18:35] are doing amen so just remember to keep
[18:37] them in prayer I'm really excited for
[18:39] what God's doing for the Saints in that
[18:42] area
[18:43] um you know when brother John started
[18:46] helping out over there he had no vision
[18:47] of what would happen no idea and it was
[18:49] just a small group amen but he didn't
[18:51] realize there was a lot of Believers in
[18:54] that area that had no place to go and
[18:55] brother John didn't know that they were
[18:57] driving some of them two or three hours
[18:59] just to have fellowship and there was
[19:01] actually quite a number of Believers
[19:03] there and after brother John started a
[19:05] church and people knew there was a
[19:06] pastor and they had voted him in his
[19:08] pastor and they found a place one by one
[19:10] they're gathering in they have visitors
[19:12] almost every service so you can see the
[19:14] hand of God God wanted to do something
[19:16] in Pittsburgh
[19:17] and I have in my flesh I should say I
[19:21] have mourned the loss of Brother John
[19:23] his amens were so encouraging having him
[19:27] here all the time plus he was a veteran
[19:30] Minister been ministering so long and
[19:32] started numerous churches he was just
[19:34] good to have around he was good to
[19:35] minister we all enjoyed him but but it's
[19:38] pretty selfish of us to want to hold on
[19:40] to him when there's such a need there
[19:42] and so I'm so thankful that he's there
[19:44] that he's ministering so it was great to
[19:46] have him come back and give an update
[19:48] and show some pictures and I just want
[19:50] to remind you all if any of you are
[19:51] going out
[19:53] to Lancaster County to go visit the
[19:55] Amish out there and go Sight and Sound
[19:56] Theater like some of you do if anybody
[19:58] takes a vacation that way include
[20:00] brother John in your stop amen stop over
[20:02] there for a service it would encourage
[20:04] him and I'm sure you would be blessed
[20:06] appreciate Brother Kyle taking the
[20:08] Wednesday night service and also I want
[20:10] to give you an update I had said he was
[20:12] supposed to go last Sunday to Junction
[20:14] City but I didn't know at the time I
[20:16] made the announcement that they had made
[20:17] some change in the schedule down in
[20:19] Junction City but he'll be going this
[20:21] Sunday so remember to pray for those
[20:23] Services Brother Kyle will be there this
[20:24] Sunday and then also at the end of the
[20:26] month he's going out to visit Brother
[20:28] Rich Cobb in Oregon for the weekend of
[20:30] the 26th and 27th so keep him in prayer
[20:32] and then I appreciate it brother
[20:34] Emmanuel I appreciate that service
[20:35] Sunday brother Emmanuel was a real
[20:37] blessing and also want to let you know
[20:39] brother Emmanuel will be traveling to
[20:41] the Congo leaving August 8th is that
[20:44] right brother uh August 9th it'll be
[20:47] gone for about a month amen so be
[20:49] praying for him they've got a lot of
[20:51] services planned he's going with brother
[20:53] Randy Cyrus and him and brother Randy
[20:55] will be going together to the Congo and
[20:58] they're probably going to preach 30 or
[20:59] more times right brother
[21:02] amen so there you go so be I imagine
[21:05] he'll appreciate I was gone 11 12 days
[21:09] and I needed lots of prayer a whole
[21:11] month brother we're gonna have to pray a
[21:12] whole lot for you amen so remember to
[21:15] keep him in prayer as he travels as well
[21:16] that God would guide them God would
[21:19] bless them
[21:21] amen as you all know while we were gone
[21:23] our brother Mark coli passed away and it
[21:26] was quite a shock I was shocked when I
[21:28] got the news and quite a surprise and
[21:30] you all know that really has changed the
[21:33] lives of those five children just
[21:35] immediately and also brother Les and
[21:37] sister Kelly coli so I appreciate
[21:40] everybody gathering around them to
[21:42] support them to show them love to pray
[21:44] for them I really appreciate the sisters
[21:46] who jumped on board quickly to start
[21:48] preparing meals I just want to say God
[21:50] bless you all I'm sure they're going to
[21:52] need all the encouragement all the love
[21:55] all the prayers all the whatever support
[21:57] we can give in the coming weeks and
[21:59] months but you know
[22:02] all I can say is if God trusted job God
[22:06] really trusts brother lesson sister
[22:08] Kelly and knows what's in them and and
[22:11] what they can do and provide for those
[22:14] five children and so I say let's do all
[22:17] we can to help them and love them and
[22:19] pray for them and don't forget to drop
[22:21] them a little notes into my car and hug
[22:24] their neck when you see them and the
[22:26] kids and welcome them and let them know
[22:28] that we're for them we're here to help
[22:30] in any way that we can we'll grieve with
[22:32] them we'll Rejoice with them we'll help
[22:34] in any way possible but that was quite a
[22:37] challenge I called brother Les to check
[22:39] up on him today
[22:40] and I asked him how he was doing he said
[22:42] oh I'm doing fine
[22:43] and he said his well pump went out today
[22:46] and so they had a problem with the well
[22:48] pump lost water had no water all day
[22:51] that's why they weren't able to make it
[22:52] this evening and I thought my goodness
[22:55] what a stack of Trials
[22:57] there must be huge blessings in store
[22:59] there must be tremendous things God's
[23:02] wanting to do because it's sure been a
[23:04] trying time
[23:06] so just remember them in prayer I think
[23:07] brother Tommy was able to go and help
[23:09] him out today and they were able to get
[23:11] things hopefully by now get things going
[23:12] but yeah I just when things like that
[23:15] happen one after the other at the other
[23:17] we can go into despair we can say God is
[23:20] God he's on the throne he's Mighty he
[23:23] wants to show himself Mighty God's going
[23:26] to do something special through all of
[23:28] this I believe with all my heart so just
[23:31] remember them in prayer
[23:33] hey man if we could pull up the
[23:34] PowerPoint brother Franco
[23:38] let me go into that
[23:39] also I want to say it's been good to
[23:41] have sister Hannah Levy here God bless
[23:43] you Sister Hannah I know she'll be
[23:45] leaving this Sunday to go back to
[23:47] Arkansas but it's been good to have you
[23:49] here amen's been good to see you in your
[23:51] seat worshiping the Lord so we'll miss
[23:54] you when you're gone
[23:55] but it's been nice to be together
[23:58] hey man let's look at this PowerPoint
[24:00] together I want to show you some
[24:01] pictures and explain to you some of the
[24:03] trip it was uh it was quite nice uh to
[24:08] go back to Poland and see the Believers
[24:09] there again we went to two places we
[24:11] went to Poland and we went to Romania
[24:13] you can see their proximity to one
[24:15] another there I was originally only
[24:18] going to go to Romania Romania was on my
[24:20] heart like I told you before we had
[24:21] tried to schedule this twice and it got
[24:23] canceled because of covert restrictions
[24:25] and brother yatzik had called earlier
[24:29] in uh in the year and he had asked me to
[24:32] come and I told him I was just too busy
[24:35] I wasn't able to make it and I couldn't
[24:37] do it this year and so he called me back
[24:42] two three weeks later and he said I was
[24:44] walking and praying brother Chad and it
[24:46] just come on my heart not to give up so
[24:48] easily so he called and he says brother
[24:52] I really really would like for you to
[24:54] come and I went through the list I said
[24:56] no bro I just I don't think that I can
[24:58] I'm too busy and I said I've got to go
[25:00] to this place and I've got to go to this
[25:02] place I've got to go to this place and I
[25:04] mentioned Romania and he goes Romania
[25:06] that's not far away brother you could
[25:08] you could combine us and them together
[25:11] and and after a man's been walking and
[25:13] praying
[25:15] and feeling like you ought to try again
[25:17] it's hard to wiggle out of that amen so
[25:20] that's what we did we just extended the
[25:21] trip a little bit and stopped in Poland
[25:23] first and then went down to Romania
[25:26] this is a picture brother Jonathan and I
[25:28] in the in the plane you can see
[25:30] everybody's boarding this is the
[25:32] beginning of our trip I I still I'm I'm
[25:35] a grandpa now an elderly so I have an
[25:37] excuse for not mastering the art of
[25:38] selfies I'm still terrible at it
[25:41] and I hope I never get good at it really
[25:43] actually I hate the whole technology end
[25:47] of things and now that I'm a grandpa I
[25:49] can say stuff like that I hate those
[25:50] newfangled things
[25:54] praise God
[25:56] but I may never get it right but that's
[25:58] okay I always look at the wrong end of
[26:00] the camera and my kids make fun of me
[26:01] but I got to do something to have them
[26:03] have some pleasure and enjoyment in life
[26:05] you know
[26:07] so brother Jonathan snapped up this
[26:09] picture I wasn't aware he was taking it
[26:12] but this is this is actually a lot of my
[26:15] travel time whenever I'm traveling
[26:17] especially when I travel alone and
[26:19] there's nobody to fellowship with this
[26:20] is this is what I do this is what I do
[26:22] in airports is what I do on airplanes is
[26:24] preparing and it's not so much preparing
[26:27] as far as putting together notes and
[26:29] even knowing what you're going to preach
[26:30] more than anything it's keeping yourself
[26:32] in the right atmosphere you got to
[26:34] constantly keep your fed on the right
[26:36] atmosphere because as you're traveling
[26:37] through airports and traveling in Planes
[26:39] everything around you is the wrong
[26:41] atmosphere every picture on every screen
[26:43] every advertisement amen and so you just
[26:46] have to constantly feed your soul and
[26:48] stay in the right channel so it's always
[26:51] nice to have a brother along because
[26:53] when we had long layovers and downtime
[26:54] brother Jonathan and I we just
[26:56] Fellowship on the word constantly
[26:58] non-stop the whole time and it keeps
[27:00] that right atmosphere going all the time
[27:02] so I really appreciated that it was
[27:04] really nice
[27:06] so we went to two different churches in
[27:08] Poland we were at brother yatzik's for
[27:09] special weekend meetings which had three
[27:11] services a Saturday and two on Sunday
[27:13] and then we traveled over to a brother
[27:15] Robert Fisher and we had a service on a
[27:19] midweek a Tuesday night service and then
[27:21] we traveled to Romania for the Family
[27:23] Camp and uh it was near a little uh well
[27:26] near a city called sabiu right in the
[27:28] central part of Romania
[27:30] and so this is brother yatzik and his
[27:33] wife amen we had a nice time with them
[27:35] this is the third time I've been to
[27:37] their place and it's it's become quite
[27:39] comfortable it's quite uh familiar now
[27:42] and so I always enjoy seeing them and
[27:43] they're always treat us so well this is
[27:46] Brother yatzik's house this is from the
[27:48] garden amen the reason you're finally
[27:51] seeing his house and seeing his garden
[27:52] is because Jonathan went
[27:57] I am horrible at taking pictures and I
[28:00] should do better I tell myself every
[28:02] trip I'm going to do better but then I
[28:04] knew Jonathan was taking him so I was
[28:06] worse than ever I mean this is like the
[28:07] worst ever I don't even like to take
[28:10] pictures I don't even enjoy taking
[28:11] pictures but he got some really nice
[28:14] pictures and I was really thankful for
[28:16] him this this house is a testimony for
[28:19] brother yatzik and he told me before but
[28:21] he refreshed my memory on this trip this
[28:24] is the house brother yasick was born in
[28:25] he was born in this house
[28:27] he lived in this house all of his life
[28:29] but as a young man when he accepted the
[28:32] Lord they were raised Lutheran when he
[28:34] accepted the Lord he began to he was
[28:37] really converted he became a Christian
[28:38] accepted Lord and he was praying all the
[28:41] time and witnessing and going out into
[28:43] the woods and praying and it became a
[28:45] shame for his parents
[28:47] and his father he went out to pray one
[28:49] night every evening he would go to the
[28:51] woods and pray and this time he went to
[28:52] the woods and pray to pray and as he was
[28:55] leaving his father said uh where are you
[28:57] going he said I'm going to pray and he
[28:59] says if you go out to pray don't come
[29:01] back you're not welcome here anymore
[29:04] and he said I have to pray he went out
[29:06] to pray and he prayed in the night and
[29:08] when he come back all the doors were
[29:10] locked and he was kicked out of his
[29:12] house and he spent that night sleeping
[29:14] outside on the concrete
[29:16] from there he just started wondering
[29:18] amen different people take him in
[29:21] eventually you know he got married he
[29:23] had his own home and had all of that and
[29:25] many years later
[29:27] and his parents invited him back and
[29:30] told him they would give him this house
[29:31] the Lord had changed their heart turn
[29:33] their hearts towards him and now the
[29:36] house he was chased from the house he
[29:37] was kicked out of is his house
[29:40] the house he was born in is his house
[29:42] amen the bottom level is a separate
[29:45] apartment that's where his parents lived
[29:46] when they were older and now his son
[29:48] lives there with his wife and their two
[29:50] children and so the house is quite a
[29:52] testimony quite a blessing when he
[29:55] shares What the Lord Has Done amen if we
[29:58] lose anything we've really lost nothing
[30:01] well we lose for the gospel God will
[30:03] repay amen we don't have to worry God
[30:06] keeps really good records
[30:08] he said no one has forsaken house or
[30:11] homes or lands or father or mother or
[30:14] wives or children for my sake that he
[30:16] won't restore in this life and in the
[30:18] world to come and the life to come so we
[30:21] see that in the lives of many Saints but
[30:24] the other and his wife they keep quite a
[30:26] nice garden and so their Garden he's
[30:28] explained to me is blueberry plants how
[30:30] he plants them and how he raises them
[30:32] and boy it was blueberry season so we
[30:34] had a good time we picked them and ate
[30:36] them and talked and fell as shipped it
[30:38] was nice so I think we arrived on Friday
[30:41] Saturday evening began the services this
[30:44] is the the front of brother yatzik's
[30:46] Church there amen and they have quite a
[30:49] nice place this church is quite a
[30:51] testimony also it used to be a disco
[30:52] club
[30:53] Praise of God
[30:55] now the dance floor is filled with
[30:57] Believers praising the Lord and
[30:58] worshiping I think that's a good
[31:00] transition to make amen
[31:02] so we'll see here we'll just get a
[31:04] portion of their worship service here
[31:16] [Applause]
[31:19] yeah foreign
[31:24] [Applause]
[31:49] Amen brother Samuel was such a good
[31:52] translator I enjoy working with him and
[31:55] and I got comfortable with him by my
[31:57] side over the times that we traveled and
[31:58] even when we traveled to the other
[32:00] Church in Poland he came along and he
[32:02] translated there and he's fantastic he
[32:04] gets into the same frame of mind he can
[32:07] follow the thought and just keeps
[32:08] everything running so smooth so here's
[32:10] from the side you can see going to the
[32:12] back uh the church it's not very big but
[32:15] they just recently remodeled it they did
[32:17] an excellent job during covert they
[32:18] remodeled it all they've got some side
[32:20] overflow space they really packed the
[32:22] place out I think they can hold 120 130
[32:25] something maybe in the sanctuary and I
[32:28] think they had upwards of close to 200
[32:30] people for the meeting so they were
[32:32] packed out they had people up in the
[32:34] Loft which is their Fellowship Hall down
[32:36] in the basement which is a Sunday school
[32:38] room and so they had people everywhere
[32:40] watching on monitors and so people had
[32:43] come from all over and I ran into a very
[32:45] familiar face here this is Brother jury
[32:48] and his wife brother Benjamin will
[32:50] remember Brother jury we stayed in their
[32:52] house and and he's a pastor from Hungary
[32:55] the group from Hungary a group of
[32:57] Believers come from Hungary came over
[32:58] for the services and brother Ben they
[33:01] say hello God bless you they send
[33:03] greetings so we had a we had a wonderful
[33:06] time with them it was so I didn't expect
[33:08] to see him there so I was like so
[33:09] excited when I saw him because we made
[33:11] such a connection with them when we were
[33:13] in Hungary back several years ago I
[33:15] think it was back in 2019 four years ago
[33:18] and that was a special trip and I have a
[33:20] special testimony from that trip I'd
[33:22] like to share uh tonight but it was
[33:25] really good to see them then there was
[33:27] somebody else that was very special that
[33:28] we ran into
[33:30] a sister zabila
[33:32] sister zabila and her friend from
[33:33] Germany they came in for the meetings
[33:35] and so it was really nice to see her in
[33:38] the congregation there smiling I told
[33:40] her I said I wish I could get a
[33:41] cardboard cut out of that smiling face
[33:43] and take it everywhere I go so you just
[33:45] smile at me and make me feel good it was
[33:47] nice so it was good to have her there
[33:49] and then we were able to visit didn't
[33:51] have a lot of time to visit with her so
[33:53] I missed out on that but we had a little
[33:54] bit of time she's doing well and looking
[33:56] forward to her visit here in September
[33:58] so she'll be joining us for the retreat
[34:00] so that'll be nice so we had a service
[34:03] on Saturday two on Sunday then Sunday
[34:06] evening we went out to Fellowship to
[34:08] dinner with some of the ministers and
[34:10] their wives from the church there and
[34:12] there's a there's a like a lot it's like
[34:15] a lodge on top of the mountain and it's
[34:16] all traditional traditional wood and
[34:19] they serve traditional Polish food
[34:20] brother illy and I were there when we
[34:22] were there last year for Easter and it
[34:24] was wonderful and the food is just as
[34:26] good brother Italia I ate your portion
[34:30] I I eat till I spoiled and I ate extra
[34:32] for brother ellia because I knew he'd
[34:34] want me to but we had a really nice
[34:36] Fellowship uh his brother yatzik and and
[34:39] his wife and then brother Joel Missouri
[34:41] that's brother Nathan who visited here
[34:43] with brother yatzik twice that's his
[34:44] brother he's a minister there in the
[34:46] church next to him is brother Daniel
[34:47] Missouri he's an evangelist that's
[34:49] worked out of church for years and I'm
[34:51] hoping that he can come sometime he's a
[34:53] wonderful brother next to him is uh
[34:55] brother Tom he's another young Minister
[34:57] and then you have myself and brother
[34:59] Jonathan and then Samuel and his wife
[35:01] Esther and another sister there it's
[35:03] been a nice Fellowship after the service
[35:05] then Monday we went to Brother Roman and
[35:08] Czech Republic we went over to the Czech
[35:10] Republic side which is only like a 15
[35:12] minute 20 minute drive and there's a
[35:14] family of Believers the Missouri family
[35:16] this is Nathan's parents place remember
[35:18] Roman's been a deacon in the church
[35:20] since the church started so him and
[35:22] brother yatzik have worked together from
[35:24] the beginning the year 2000 and um and
[35:28] we had a wonderful Fellowship so I just
[35:30] we had a video that they sent me in the
[35:32] fellowship I just want to show it to you
[35:33] because this is is what I love I told
[35:35] the I told him everywhere I go I never
[35:38] travel to preach I only travel for
[35:40] Fellowship
[35:42] I realized on this trip I've realized it
[35:44] before but it hit me with impact again
[35:47] what a privilege it is to go meet
[35:50] brothers and sisters on the other side
[35:51] of the world to travel long distances to
[35:54] go to another culture with another
[35:57] language with another a whole nother set
[36:00] of of circumstances and find the Same
[36:03] Spirit the same desire for the word the
[36:05] same connection the same love the same
[36:08] it's just absolutely amazing and I on
[36:10] this trip I realized that I'm an
[36:13] extremely privileged person because not
[36:15] everybody gets this chance it's rare
[36:18] it's few and and I never want to take it
[36:20] for granted and that's why I want to I
[36:23] want to come and show you this this
[36:24] video I'm getting ready to show you the
[36:25] fellowship around their their table and
[36:28] around their little living room area
[36:29] there and
[36:31] and I I want to share that experience
[36:33] with you because maybe you all won't get
[36:35] to travel to the other side of the world
[36:37] and and visit our brothers and sisters
[36:39] there but I want to tell you amen it's
[36:41] it's beautiful it's wonderful it's the
[36:44] same thing we have here only there
[36:47] and you realize the bride is worldwide
[36:49] the body is all over the globe and it's
[36:53] the same the same love for the world
[36:55] that were the same connection to our
[36:57] Lord the same desires and the same the
[37:01] same sweet Gentle Spirit
[37:04] remember when brother Branham he would
[37:06] be having a prayer line and somebody
[37:08] would be the one in the prayer line and
[37:10] they would step forward and brother
[37:11] Brandon would say now don't be afraid
[37:14] that's him
[37:17] and he says don't you feel that real
[37:20] sweet Gentle Spirit
[37:24] amen I can tell you I felt it in
[37:26] fellowship with my brothers and sisters
[37:29] it's wonderful amen amen and I pray that
[37:32] if you ever get the chance that that if
[37:34] God ever opens the door and gives you
[37:36] the chance that you take the opportunity
[37:38] because I you know I've traveled a lot
[37:41] now I've been in a lot of different
[37:43] countries in a lot of different places
[37:44] and
[37:46] you know it's funny because when you
[37:48] walk through the airport after you visit
[37:49] a place like for the Philippines for
[37:51] instance you walk to the airport and you
[37:53] see these postcards with these beautiful
[37:54] white beaches
[37:56] in a turquoise colored water and palm
[37:59] trees and and I have never seen that in
[38:02] the Philippines
[38:04] because I don't go to see that I go to
[38:06] see the Believers and usually I see a
[38:08] believer's house or a hotel room in a
[38:10] church and a car and I go from a car to
[38:13] a hotel room from a hotel room to a
[38:14] believer's house to a car to a church
[38:18] right brother Kyle
[38:20] no turquoise blues water white sandy
[38:22] beaches and palm trees and hammocks
[38:24] that's not for us
[38:26] but when you've seen the Believers in
[38:28] every country you've seen the most
[38:29] beautiful thing in that country
[38:32] but remember said the beauty of the
[38:34] church is the character of the people I
[38:35] want to say the most precious beautiful
[38:37] thing in every nation in the world is
[38:39] the saints of God
[38:40] [Music]
[38:42] and when you've seen that you've seen
[38:43] the best that a nation has to offer
[38:45] there's no point in seeing anything else
[38:48] you've seen you've been to the top
[38:49] there's nothing else but going down
[38:52] amen so I want to show you this
[38:54] Fellowship
[38:58] [Music]
[39:00] say
[39:02] [Music]
[39:09] s
[39:10] [Music]

[39:17] he said
[39:18] [Music]
[39:20] [Applause]
[39:22] [Music]

[39:43] [Applause]
[39:52] [Applause]
[39:58] [Music]
[40:14] [Applause]
[40:15] [Music]
[40:17] is
[40:21] [Music]
[40:25] everything
[40:29] foreign
[40:33] [Music]
[40:40] I travel 24 hours to sit in that living
[40:43] room
[40:44] and share the testimonies that we share
[40:46] talk about the word and sing like that
[40:50] that come at the end of the meetings the
[40:54] day after the meetings were over you
[40:56] talk about restoring whatever was put
[40:58] out was being restored right there and I
[41:01] thank God if you ever get the
[41:02] opportunity take the opportunity and go
[41:05] visit our brothers and sisters wherever
[41:08] you can find them
[41:10] so that was Monday we went over enjoyed
[41:12] that Fellowship Tuesday we traveled to
[41:15] the other Church in Poland this is
[41:17] brother Robert Fisher he's the pastor
[41:19] there he's actually a brother who's
[41:21] traveled to the United States quite a
[41:22] few times we just never had the
[41:23] opportunity to meet so I'm hoping to get
[41:25] to see him again sometime we had a
[41:27] really nice service there Tuesday
[41:28] evening and then we got done late that
[41:32] evening drove over to Krakow stayed in
[41:34] the hotel at the airport and then we got
[41:36] up Wednesday and flew to Romania
[41:40] everything was difficult the flights we
[41:42] had three flights over two flights to
[41:44] Romania coming back two flights to get
[41:47] to Krakow then stay the night coming
[41:49] back we had three flights so we'd float
[41:52] brother Jonathan and I have flown 10
[41:54] separate flights to get there and back
[41:56] and that's rough that's all I can say is
[42:01] I'm tired of airplanes and I hate the
[42:03] seats in those things
[42:05] praise God it was worth it for the
[42:07] fellowship when we got to the camp the
[42:09] campground actually will only
[42:12] accommodate 150 people so there's a
[42:15] little Valley it's a mountainous area
[42:16] and there's a little Valley that runs
[42:17] through this mountainous region and it's
[42:20] like a kind of a vacation area in the
[42:23] mountains so there's a lot of what would
[42:24] be like airbnbs rental homes through
[42:26] there so the Believers fill the valley
[42:29] by renting all the houses so it's a
[42:31] valley full of Believers by the time
[42:33] this Camp rolls around and this was the
[42:35] house brother Gabrielle matanye brother
[42:37] Gabrielle is the one who invited us
[42:39] there brother Gabriel if you remember he
[42:41] was here last year with his wife he
[42:43] preached here for us one service and we
[42:46] know him from traveling to Romania about
[42:49] six years ago I was there and preached
[42:51] the camp for him six years ago I believe
[42:53] it was and so brother Gabriel rented
[42:56] this and we stayed here with a few other
[42:58] brothers and had a nice fellowship and
[43:01] this was like
[43:02] oh I don't know just a few hundred yards
[43:04] down the road from the camp so it worked
[43:07] out good we got a picture here of the
[43:08] mountains you can see this is from the
[43:10] garden area looking up to the mountains
[43:12] so everywhere you looked was like this
[43:14] it was a beautiful area as brother
[43:16] Jonathan told you it was 95 to 100
[43:18] degrees there the week before we showed
[43:20] up the projected temperature was I
[43:23] looked at it a week out and it was hot
[43:26] and I was saying oh Lord help us
[43:28] as as outside meetings you know it gets
[43:31] hot and Under the Tent it just bakes and
[43:34] I just don't know I I don't sweat I melt
[43:38] and I figured I'd just be a puddle of
[43:40] Nothing by the time it was over but as
[43:41] Jonathan said the storm came in it
[43:43] cooled everything off and it stayed nice
[43:45] and cool the whole time and it was a
[43:47] blessing for all the Believers
[43:49] so at this meeting we had another
[43:51] speaker was I've shared the meetings
[43:53] with brother Andreas bogg from
[43:55] Switzerland and this brother is a
[43:59] fantastic brother I'd heard good things
[44:01] about brother Andreas and from different
[44:04] different brothers that I know in Europe
[44:06] and even here in the United States
[44:08] talked about what a nice brother he was
[44:09] what a good Ministry he had but I never
[44:12] had a chance to meet him I don't even
[44:13] think I knew even what he looked like I
[44:15] don't think and when I met him we got
[44:17] the chance to fellowship and I really
[44:19] really enjoyed this brother he took
[44:21] three of the services there and then did
[44:24] a a youth meeting and every service he
[44:27] preached I enjoyed I was on the edge of
[44:28] my seat I enjoyed it and I enjoyed the
[44:31] word and the gift that's in our brother
[44:32] and so I'm just praying that he gets to
[44:35] come here sometime and and Minister
[44:37] because I found another good friend in
[44:39] the ministry and he was a real blessing
[44:41] to visit with him
[44:43] you can see here the tent that that we
[44:45] had
[44:46] uh this tent they ordered I think I
[44:50] don't remember I forgot the dimensions
[44:52] but it was a pretty big pretty sizable
[44:54] tent they originally ordered 400 chairs
[44:57] I believe it was 350 or 400 chairs uh
[45:00] the first night the crowd started to
[45:02] fill it all up and they knew more would
[45:03] come in as we got to the weekend so they
[45:05] ended up ordering more chairs they ended
[45:07] up having 450 chairs then they they
[45:10] ended up they couldn't get any more
[45:11] chairs so they got benches and chairs
[45:14] from all over the campground and brought
[45:15] them I think they had really close I
[45:17] think it was pretty close to 550 people
[45:20] that ended up showing up so it surpassed
[45:22] their expectations and it was quite a
[45:25] well-attended camp ended up like brother
[45:28] Jonathan was saying we had Believers
[45:30] from Romania Hungary Serbia Ukraine
[45:33] Poland Czech Republic Italy Spain
[45:35] Moldova UK Germany and I don't know
[45:39] where else there could have been others
[45:42] so it was quite interesting to go around
[45:44] and meet all the brothers and find out
[45:45] where they were from it was quite
[45:47] interesting
[45:48] I'm gonna play a little clip of the song
[45:50] service
[45:51] [Music]
[46:01] everything
[46:11] amen this is Brother Andreas and this is
[46:13] Brother Gabrielle matanye you may
[46:15] remember him after you see the picture
[46:17] of him being here he translated for all
[46:20] the services for brother Andreas and
[46:23] then he and his family and his church
[46:25] they're the ones who organized the camp
[46:27] and it was quite an undertaking he's got
[46:29] a son Reuben and Reuben was like what we
[46:32] say the camp director he had a lot of
[46:34] people helping him but he was a very
[46:35] very busy man but he did a fantastic job
[46:38] so we appreciate him and like I said
[46:40] this is one of the services I enjoy I
[46:43] enjoyed so much sitting and feeding on
[46:45] the word I enjoyed so much listening to
[46:48] the brother preach and a brother with a
[46:50] Clear Vision on the word and and that
[46:52] fresh take you know I always love that
[46:55] fresh because it's outside my own head
[46:57] outside my own understanding and he got
[46:59] a good vision for the word and so I
[47:01] really really enjoyed it and fed from it
[47:03] and we had a nice time and this is uh
[47:06] The Interpreter who interpreted for me
[47:07] this is brother raiol raiol was a
[47:10] fantastic translator he did the
[47:12] Translating for me and here we are
[47:14] preparing for a service they're all in
[47:16] singing we're out sitting in front of a
[47:18] little cabin on a little wooden picnic
[47:20] table and this is what I got into the
[47:22] routine of always doing this with my
[47:24] translators because the the translator
[47:28] he's got to uh he's got a difficult task
[47:32] he's got to take what you're saying and
[47:34] communicate it to the people in their
[47:36] language and you would think all you
[47:38] would have to do is just repeat after me
[47:40] but the problem is he's got to carry the
[47:43] thought
[47:44] not just repeat after me because if he
[47:47] doesn't know where you're going he could
[47:49] be thinking you're going one way with
[47:51] where you're preaching because you know
[47:52] sometimes when we preach we go around
[47:54] the Cow Shed
[47:55] you know that old saying to get to our
[47:57] point and he doesn't know the journey
[47:59] you're on if he doesn't know the
[48:00] destination then he's not going around
[48:03] the Cow Shed he's off to a whole nother
[48:05] path you know so I would always sit down
[48:08] and go through the scriptures with me
[48:09] because I found so many unusual
[48:12] translations of the Bible and other
[48:14] languages some languages are do a very
[48:16] good job some languages are just strange
[48:18] so we'll go through and make sure what
[48:20] I'm reading matches what they'll be
[48:22] reading in their Bible so we do all of
[48:23] that and then I start telling what my
[48:26] inspiration is and I go through a few of
[48:27] my quotes and I want to tell them what
[48:29] my thought is what my main inspiration
[48:31] is what I'm hoping uh the message I'm
[48:34] hoping to convey to the people through
[48:36] the preaching so he knows the desire
[48:38] amen and whenever you preach there's
[48:40] always new things that come fresh
[48:42] scriptures you never thought of fresh
[48:44] quotes that you don't have and there's
[48:47] always fresh stuff but if this brother
[48:49] knows what my inspiration is he knows my
[48:51] desire and he knows my main thought he
[48:53] can stay with me wherever we go
[48:55] and I found that this works out so well
[48:58] and and brother rail was able to catch
[49:01] it I mean when I would be able to just
[49:03] when we were sitting here at the table
[49:04] he would be going amen amen amen he was
[49:08] getting in the thought he was getting in
[49:09] the inspiration and then when we go to
[49:12] the platform we just it works seamless
[49:14] it works so well and he did a fantastic
[49:16] job and I really appreciated the brother
[49:19] you can see him in action here
[49:22] yes
[49:28] [Music]
[49:44] praise God
[49:46] amen
[49:48] I've had people say before
[49:50] the Chad why don't you preach like that
[49:52] at home
[49:54] this is why I say why don't you pull
[49:55] like that so it's a fair statement you
[49:58] know we can it works on both sides
[50:01] but when you realize that this is a camp
[50:03] meeting
[50:04] this is individuals coming from all over
[50:07] and coming to quiet and for Europe
[50:09] there's quite a large Gathering to
[50:11] gather that many Believers and there's
[50:13] anticipation there's enthusiasm there's
[50:15] excitement they they've they've really
[50:17] worked to get there they've spent their
[50:18] money spent their time they've driven
[50:20] from all over and there's quite an
[50:22] atmosphere and so you realize I want you
[50:25] to see that clip so you realize one
[50:26] thing amen it's not the ability of the
[50:29] preacher it's the atmosphere
[50:32] amen a good atmosphere can make a
[50:36] mediocre preacher fly amen
[50:38] I know because I'm a mediocre preacher
[50:42] but you know what I mean it's it's the
[50:44] atmosphere the anticipation brother
[50:46] Benham said the people are 50 of the
[50:48] gift you know the gift is there and so
[50:50] it's it's we've all been in meetings
[50:53] like that where it's just it's just
[50:55] energy there's an anticipation there's
[50:57] an excitement amen and and then you get
[51:00] what you expect
[51:01] but remember said and so it's always
[51:03] exciting it's always a thrill and and
[51:05] the people here were so hungry so
[51:08] desires of the word so respectful for
[51:10] the word pulling and it was so wonderful
[51:12] I enjoyed the atmosphere it was good and
[51:14] I really loved being with them
[51:16] as brother Jonathan said there were
[51:18] several baptisms and here's one sister
[51:20] who uh got baptized
[51:45] praise God it was exciting everybody was
[51:48] rejoicing
[51:49] at the baptisms
[51:52] this is us here I think the the last day
[51:55] brother well rayol and I myself and uh
[51:59] they had us they asked me to pray for
[52:02] this family you can't see but there's a
[52:03] sister on the other side of his brother
[52:05] it's his wife and their little baby this
[52:08] man grew up as a believer
[52:10] but he had left he had left a message he
[52:13] had backslidden and he he married a
[52:16] sister he married or not a sister he
[52:18] married a woman and he married a
[52:19] Catholic woman and they were married in
[52:21] a Catholic Church
[52:22] in
[52:24] they came to the camp
[52:27] and one of those who was baptized was
[52:29] his wife amen she was baptized in the
[52:32] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I think it
[52:34] was on Friday and on Saturday they
[52:37] wanted to dedicate their lives to the
[52:38] Lord and dedicate their son to the Lord
[52:40] and as a family they want to be
[52:42] dedicated to the Lord and so they asked
[52:44] us to pray with them and that was a
[52:46] tremendous pleasure you see somebody go
[52:48] a long way around but they come right to
[52:50] the destination God had for them and if
[52:53] if God if this if for whatever if his
[52:57] brother had a block God opened the door
[52:59] through his wife amen and he followed he
[53:01] he he didn't resist he surrendered his
[53:05] life to the Lord and it was a privilege
[53:07] to pray with them to see it God do a
[53:09] work of restoration
[53:11] man I've got one more clip I want to
[53:13] play this is Saturday night Saturday
[53:15] night at the uh end of the preaching uh
[53:18] brother Andreas preached the evening
[53:20] Services I did the morning Services
[53:21] brother Andreas preached and it was a
[53:24] wonderful service it was tremendous
[53:26] wonderful atmosphere and and we prayed
[53:29] for a few people a few people came
[53:30] forward to be prayed for and then the
[53:32] Brethren just sang and sang and saying
[53:34] they wouldn't dismiss they just kept
[53:36] singing and in a Romanian style they
[53:39] have their own style and I enjoyed it
[53:41] they were rejoicing they were happy and
[53:43] I enjoyed it I just wanted to play a
[53:44] short clip for you
[53:50] thank you
[53:55] [Music]
[54:04] [Music]
[54:11] praise the Lord that was happy
[54:15] I have no idea what they were saying but
[54:16] my heart was saying praise God praise
[54:18] God praise God I don't know what the
[54:20] words were but it caused me to praise
[54:22] God and rejoice and it was quite a
[54:25] blessing and so that that was a
[54:30] fantastic uh group of Believers
[54:33] fantastic environment and it was just a
[54:36] privilege to be with them it's a
[54:37] privilege to shake their hand privilege
[54:39] to hug their neck a privilege to to see
[54:42] them
[54:43] you know
[54:45] we were all at one time together in the
[54:48] mind of God
[54:50] we're all attributes of God together and
[54:52] we had Fellowship together
[54:55] amen because remember God's thoughts are
[54:57] literal they are real they're not like
[54:59] our thoughts and we can't even
[55:02] comprehend that I don't even when I say
[55:04] that I don't even know what I'm talking
[55:05] about
[55:06] but something in me knows that we had
[55:09] Fellowship there
[55:10] amen because there's such a reconnection
[55:12] like a magnetism when you meet in this
[55:14] life and that's what it was with the
[55:16] Brethren there so the
[55:18] Services there ended Sunday as brother
[55:22] Jonathan said we had quite a bit
[55:23] Saturday was a was a full day absolute
[55:26] full day I felt like I was in the Pulpit
[55:29] all day long but God gave us
[55:31] Supernatural strength it was just and it
[55:33] just flowed and I just thank God for it
[55:36] I had about one minute 30 seconds notice
[55:39] that I was going to preach to the
[55:41] ministers
[55:44] I don't know
[55:46] one minute and 30 seconds is not enough
[55:48] time to figure out what you're going to
[55:50] preach just in case you didn't know
[55:53] so it was just
[55:55] can you speak I thought we were doing
[55:57] questions and answers they told me all
[55:58] along we were going to do questions and
[56:00] answers so I was prepared to do
[56:01] questions and answers when I thought it
[56:03] was odd because I was supposed to get
[56:04] the questions ahead of time but I didn't
[56:06] get any questions
[56:08] for questions and answers then all of a
[56:10] sudden the brother Gabriel said we'd
[56:12] like for you just to share to speak with
[56:13] the ministers so I I did I just walked
[56:16] through the pulpit no song service no
[56:19] nothing and and you have to remember 10
[56:21] minutes earlier I just finished an hour
[56:24] over an hour service for the married
[56:26] couples
[56:28] and just an hour before that before
[56:30] lunch I just finished a two-hour sermon
[56:32] so we'd preached the morning service
[56:34] took a lunch break come back and
[56:36] preached over an hour to the couples I
[56:38] never left the tent I went and sat down
[56:40] 10 minutes later they had the couples
[56:41] out the ministers in and they says can
[56:44] you speak and I just
[56:48] but praise God whenever you need God
[56:51] God's there
[56:53] you couldn't make that happen you can't
[56:55] plan these things you can't just expect
[56:57] to have no plan and God show up on the
[57:00] scene because that's you know just to
[57:03] say oh I'm just going to wing and I'm
[57:04] not going to play anything we're going
[57:05] to have a meeting that's foolishness
[57:08] but when something just happens like
[57:10] that and you have to depend on God you
[57:11] find out God's always there
[57:13] God's always there
[57:15] sometimes it's spiritual laziness to say
[57:17] well I'm not gonna pray anything I'm
[57:18] just going to go and see what happens
[57:21] that's not what we're called to
[57:23] know but when something happens and you
[57:25] have no control I found God always
[57:28] faithful
[57:29] always faithful always on the scene and
[57:32] you find that you do the best you can
[57:34] but when it comes down to it it's God
[57:37] you you should study a minister should
[57:40] study he should seek the Lord he should
[57:42] have an inspiration he shouldn't know
[57:44] that what he's preaching is in the word
[57:45] you should take the time to seek it out
[57:48] but when you can't God's still there
[57:50] amen whichever way it works God's always
[57:53] there and you find the leading of the
[57:56] Lord is so interesting it's never what
[57:58] people think it's never what I think
[57:59] it's always and you look back and you
[58:01] say that was the leading of the Lord but
[58:03] while it's happening you just don't know
[58:05] I mean you feel to go away a certain way
[58:08] you feel to do a certain thing and you
[58:10] just trust that's the best is the best I
[58:11] know how I didn't have a dream I didn't
[58:13] have lightning bolts from Heaven I
[58:15] didn't I just feel like this is what I
[58:17] should do amen and and you know that it
[58:20] could be you it could be God you there's
[58:22] no way for you to know when you don't
[58:24] know until it's over and you look back
[58:25] and God's confirmed it and that was God
[58:29] praise God I love it
[58:32] amen I love preparation
[58:36] I love a plan
[58:38] I love a plan with details
[58:40] I like stuff to start at the minute
[58:44] that's me
[58:45] but oh how God likes to test me
[58:50] so he sends me places where people have
[58:52] a totally different idea of how things
[58:53] should go
[58:56] where time is blending into eternity
[58:59] already
[59:00] but praise God I find that if I can just
[59:03] relax God's always on the scene
[59:06] and he doesn't he doesn't need
[59:08] any of our own thinking it just needs a
[59:10] vessel that he can use that would be
[59:12] surrendered and so God was so good to us
[59:15] there and he helped us all along the way
[59:17] we didn't I guess we ministered for a
[59:19] while I don't know how long maybe 30 40
[59:21] minutes just sharing from our heart to
[59:23] the ministers and then we did a little
[59:25] over an hour questions and answers and
[59:27] it was no preparation it was no read
[59:30] this question think about it pray find
[59:33] the answer they would just stand up and
[59:35] ask a question
[59:36] sometimes they would stand up and ask a
[59:38] question and I mean it was a Zinger I
[59:41] mean it was a
[59:42] and I would just laugh because what in
[59:45] the world am I supposed to do now
[59:48] and and you know I just smile and I put
[59:51] my head down and and all I could say was
[59:54] wow yeah
[59:56] and then all of a sudden
[59:58] quotes would come scriptures would come
[1:00:01] and I would remember things that I had
[1:00:03] read and so God was just on the scene
[1:00:05] and I just thank God for him and we just
[1:00:07] pray
[1:00:08] by the grace of God that whatever we did
[1:00:11] there was helpful
[1:00:12] because we never go to hurt when Our
[1:00:14] intention is never to hurt or to confuse
[1:00:16] our greatest desires to help God's
[1:00:19] people greatest desire to do something
[1:00:21] to encourage do something to bless do
[1:00:23] something to lift somebody just a little
[1:00:25] bit higher and do whatever we can
[1:00:27] whatever our part is and so we pray by
[1:00:30] the grace of God we were able to do
[1:00:31] something that would be helpful
[1:00:34] so we um we got done on Sunday Monday
[1:00:38] morning we got up to drive we were
[1:00:39] catching afternoon flights so we drove
[1:00:41] back to Cebu packed up had breakfast
[1:00:44] drove and we had about two hours just to
[1:00:46] walk around the town it was a neat old
[1:00:48] town and we walked around but they have
[1:00:51] all these old churches there they have
[1:00:53] the Catholic Church they have the
[1:00:54] Orthodox Church they have the Lutheran
[1:00:57] Church and they're massive old beautiful
[1:01:00] structures
[1:01:01] so I put a couple pictures in here this
[1:01:03] is the inside of the Catholic Church
[1:01:06] it's unbelievable the Catholic church is
[1:01:10] different here in the United States than
[1:01:11] it is in Europe
[1:01:13] much much different I mean the amount of
[1:01:15] gold I mean the
[1:01:18] it's unbelievable I walked through this
[1:01:20] church
[1:01:21] and then brother Jonathan and I went to
[1:01:23] the Lutheran Church and all these
[1:01:25] churches are trying to outdo each other
[1:01:27] with their buildings you know now the
[1:01:29] Protestants have to build one bigger and
[1:01:31] their steeple has to be higher than the
[1:01:33] steeple you can just see it
[1:01:36] and I thought God take me back to that
[1:01:39] tent on a campground with a grass floor
[1:01:43] that's the Church of the Living God not
[1:01:46] the big fancy building these buildings
[1:01:48] are cold and they're dead amen but where
[1:01:51] was life life was with 500 and some
[1:01:54] people packed into a campground into a
[1:01:56] into an old tent
[1:01:59] with a grass floor and whatever chairs
[1:02:01] they could find worshiping the Lord I
[1:02:04] said that's where I want to be that's
[1:02:06] where God's children are
[1:02:08] in the we can go ahead and turn that off
[1:02:11] I just wanted to share some scriptures
[1:02:13] with you but I want to share a couple
[1:02:15] testimonies
[1:02:17] there was a very very uh wonderful
[1:02:21] testimony for me personally it was a
[1:02:23] blessing to me it blessed me in an
[1:02:25] unmeasurable ways and when I share it
[1:02:27] with you you'll understand why I hope
[1:02:30] the last day Sunday as we were wrapping
[1:02:32] up and leaving there was a young man
[1:02:34] that came to me he's probably in his
[1:02:36] early 30s and he said brother Chad I
[1:02:39] just wanted to thank you and he shook my
[1:02:41] hand
[1:02:42] and
[1:02:43] this testimony starts all the way back
[1:02:46] when brother Ben and I
[1:02:48] went brother vincible and I traveled to
[1:02:50] Serbia back I believe it was 2019 I
[1:02:53] believe was the years either 2018 or
[1:02:55] 2019.
[1:02:57] and this brother comes up to me to shake
[1:02:59] my hand and say God bless you and he
[1:03:02] says you probably don't remember me but
[1:03:04] I'm brother Yanko Thomas's brother and I
[1:03:07] didn't remember seeing the brother I
[1:03:08] didn't remember knowing him he says
[1:03:10] years ago you were in Serbia
[1:03:13] and he says do you remember when we had
[1:03:16] the meetings in Serbia and his brother
[1:03:18] brother Yanko Thomas he organized the
[1:03:20] meetings and if you all remember do you
[1:03:23] remember the trip that brother Ben and I
[1:03:25] took when there was a young man on the
[1:03:28] plane that had
[1:03:30] um he he
[1:03:33] I don't know what you call it
[1:03:35] he had like an anxiety attack and it
[1:03:38] looked like it was drug-induced and he
[1:03:39] really went out of his mind and he got
[1:03:41] aggressive and the the Marshalls on the
[1:03:43] plane had to come and Tackle him the
[1:03:46] plain clothes dressed people on
[1:03:47] international flights that was the first
[1:03:49] time I saw there are those Among Us
[1:03:52] on a plane with authority they they
[1:03:55] talked with him they got him down they
[1:03:57] zip tied his hands and we we were
[1:03:59] rerouted back through Detroit our plane
[1:04:02] had already taken off we were going to
[1:04:04] cross the ocean they rerouted us to
[1:04:05] Detroit they had to change all of our
[1:04:07] flight we had to spend the night in
[1:04:09] Detroit
[1:04:10] then we had to reroute through Paris
[1:04:12] which we weren't supposed to go through
[1:04:13] Paris then we couldn't catch the plane
[1:04:14] in time in Paris so we had to spend the
[1:04:17] night in Paris so on the way there we
[1:04:19] spent the night we weren't supposed to
[1:04:20] spend any nights anywhere we're supposed
[1:04:21] to fly there and get there a day before
[1:04:23] the meetings but because this guy had
[1:04:27] this episode the police had to escort
[1:04:29] him off we landed the police come and
[1:04:31] got him escorted him off and everybody
[1:04:33] on the plane is mad because now they're
[1:04:35] gonna they're gonna disembark the plane
[1:04:37] we all had to get off the plane and and
[1:04:39] all two 250 300 people had to change all
[1:04:43] of their plans because of this man
[1:04:45] and everybody was mad and everybody was
[1:04:48] upset and it was extremely difficult for
[1:04:51] brother Ben and I it is extremely
[1:04:53] difficult for me because I knew I was
[1:04:55] going to be late for the meetings and I
[1:04:56] had to preach the opening service on
[1:04:58] whatever night this was and with my
[1:05:01] nature you just don't mess with my
[1:05:03] schedule you know
[1:05:04] I have to be there this isn't right and
[1:05:08] so so we got rerouted got there we got
[1:05:11] there a day late to the meetings there
[1:05:13] were special meetings for three days got
[1:05:14] there a day late I ended up preaching a
[1:05:17] day after I was supposed to preach ended
[1:05:20] up starting the meetings then
[1:05:23] well here we are four years later and
[1:05:25] this young man comes to me said do you
[1:05:27] remember that when you had all that
[1:05:28] trouble you and brother Ben I said yeah
[1:05:30] he said I want you to know that was for
[1:05:32] me
[1:05:34] said I couldn't get there the first day
[1:05:37] I had to work I couldn't get there and
[1:05:40] he said the message you preached touched
[1:05:42] my life in a special way I was baxton
[1:05:44] and I had left the message and I came
[1:05:46] back to the Lord in that service
[1:05:48] he said if you had preached what you
[1:05:50] preached the day before I wouldn't be
[1:05:51] standing here today
[1:05:55] for four years
[1:05:57] we had no idea why it was just an
[1:05:59] interesting story to tell people
[1:06:02] but now you realize
[1:06:05] what God will go through for one soul
[1:06:10] what God will do
[1:06:13] I mean brother Ben and I weren't mad we
[1:06:16] took it in stride but I don't think we
[1:06:17] were happy either but I mean were we
[1:06:20] it was difficult it was trouble Summit
[1:06:23] it made me more nervous it backed up our
[1:06:25] plans it made difficulty for the
[1:06:27] Brethren and Serbia all these 300 people
[1:06:29] who had to change their plans who knows
[1:06:31] what they were going for business going
[1:06:32] for pleasure going for whatever how many
[1:06:34] plans were ruined
[1:06:37] we had to pay for two extra nights in a
[1:06:39] hotel
[1:06:42] because this man had to be there when
[1:06:45] this certain word would come forth so
[1:06:46] the two could connect
[1:06:48] and he could give his heart back to the
[1:06:50] Lord
[1:06:51] when that brother told me that it just
[1:06:53] took the breath out of me and I realized
[1:06:56] how wonderful God is
[1:06:58] and are the footsteps of the righteous
[1:07:00] are ordered of the Lord and I said God
[1:07:02] forgive me for every time I've ever
[1:07:04] complained for anything in my life
[1:07:06] complain for being late in traffic
[1:07:08] complained for being stopped for
[1:07:09] standing in a line for anything God
[1:07:11] forgive me help me never to complain
[1:07:13] again
[1:07:14] because God has our lives ordered and he
[1:07:17] knows what he's doing
[1:07:18] that testimony just it did something for
[1:07:21] me
[1:07:22] and I found
[1:07:24] I found whatever we pray for we commit
[1:07:27] ourselves to the Lord we pray that God
[1:07:28] will direct our steps we pray for all of
[1:07:30] this and after we pray for that
[1:07:32] everything in the world goes wrong
[1:07:34] and the question is does it go wrong or
[1:07:36] does it go right
[1:07:37] is wrong right
[1:07:39] sometimes wrong is right
[1:07:41] and if we've committed our life to the
[1:07:43] Lord and asked him the the to guide us
[1:07:46] and to lead us in the in the in the
[1:07:48] watch over our footsteps and I believe
[1:07:49] he will
[1:07:51] and and this has helped to increase my
[1:07:53] faith in that I've seen him do it so
[1:07:56] many times so many testimonies like that
[1:07:58] but this one had a huge profound impact
[1:08:01] and I couldn't wait to get back and tell
[1:08:03] y'all especially brother Ben because he
[1:08:05] suffered with me through all of that
[1:08:08] you know there was another testimony
[1:08:10] from the camp there there was a brother
[1:08:13] named brother Gregory he was he's a
[1:08:15] Romanian brother but he lives in uh
[1:08:17] Germany now he goes to brother Wall's
[1:08:20] church and he was at the meetings and we
[1:08:22] had seen him the whole time we were in
[1:08:23] Romania and the brother was walking with
[1:08:25] a crutch he had one of those crutches
[1:08:27] that has the arm cuff with the handle
[1:08:29] and he had one of those crutches and he
[1:08:31] was going around just on one side and he
[1:08:33] was favoring one side and he had his
[1:08:35] obvious there was something wrong and he
[1:08:36] had used the crutch up and down steps
[1:08:38] and as he walked and we saw him for like
[1:08:40] three days with that crutch through the
[1:08:42] meetings and then even we had a
[1:08:44] fellowship after the Sunday meeting in
[1:08:46] the evening and he was there and then
[1:08:48] Monday morning he came because he was
[1:08:50] going to be one of the drivers to help
[1:08:51] get us to the city and I noticed he
[1:08:53] didn't have the crotch and I didn't
[1:08:55] think anything of it I didn't I couldn't
[1:08:57] speak with him because he spoke only
[1:08:59] Romanian and German
[1:09:01] and so I just noticed he didn't have it
[1:09:03] so we were getting ready to leave and we
[1:09:05] were going to Bow our heads and pray
[1:09:06] before we went in the cars to go to Cebu
[1:09:08] and he said I'd like to share a
[1:09:10] testimony so he's sharing it through
[1:09:12] brother matanya he's translating for us
[1:09:15] and he says I was walking with a crutch
[1:09:17] I had a lot of pain in my leg and there
[1:09:19] was something wrong and I don't remember
[1:09:20] what the problem was I can't remember
[1:09:22] now but he had a problem with his leg
[1:09:24] had pain in his leg
[1:09:25] and he said I woke up this morning
[1:09:28] and I was talking to God and I told God
[1:09:30] how much I appreciated the word and
[1:09:33] respected the word that he preached and
[1:09:35] I received it as from the Lord
[1:09:38] that I all the word that was preached
[1:09:40] during the camp he said I received it as
[1:09:42] from the Lord and I believe it was from
[1:09:44] you Lord and he was appreciating God for
[1:09:46] the word he had and he was surrendering
[1:09:48] to what he heard
[1:09:49] and he says when I stood up he said the
[1:09:51] pain was gone in my leg everything's
[1:09:53] here
[1:09:55] amen
[1:09:56] [Applause]
[1:10:01] and then while he was talking he was
[1:10:03] speaking in Romanian so I didn't know
[1:10:05] what he was saying but I was getting the
[1:10:07] point because he was pointing down and
[1:10:08] he was stomping the injured foot on the
[1:10:10] ground so I got the point he feels good
[1:10:15] and I was I was thinking about
[1:10:17] uh I was just meditating on that
[1:10:21] what did this brother do to get healing
[1:10:27] what he did is he did the same thing
[1:10:29] anybody does to get healing
[1:10:32] what do we do to get healing
[1:10:34] we reverence the word
[1:10:37] even if you have hands laid on you
[1:10:39] that's referencing the word
[1:10:40] even if you have anointing well that's
[1:10:42] referencing the word even if you claim
[1:10:44] it by faith you're still reverencing the
[1:10:46] word because our healing comes by our
[1:10:47] faith in the word
[1:10:49] and so what did this man do he wasn't
[1:10:52] asking God to heal his leg he was
[1:10:54] telling God that he received the word
[1:10:55] that was preached during the meeting and
[1:10:58] he surrendered to it and believed it was
[1:11:00] from the Lord what'd he do he respected
[1:11:02] Christ he respected the anointed word he
[1:11:05] expected the pre-respected the preaching
[1:11:07] of the word and while he just was
[1:11:09] showing honor to God and respect for the
[1:11:12] preaching God healed his leg
[1:11:16] and I didn't pull up the quote I wish I
[1:11:18] would have now but brother Brennan makes
[1:11:20] a quote where he talks about he's
[1:11:22] looking forward to the time that people
[1:11:24] will receive their healing in their seat
[1:11:26] during the preaching of the word
[1:11:31] oh praise God
[1:11:34] I believe we live in that day where we
[1:11:36] can honor and reverence the word of God
[1:11:38] and the word will take care of
[1:11:41] everything
[1:11:42] let's turn together to Psalms 107 and I
[1:11:44] would like to read a scripture together
[1:11:48] Psalms 107 I just want to share a couple
[1:11:51] thoughts for about 10 minutes as we
[1:11:53] close Psalms 107 verse 19.
[1:12:06] Psalms 107 verse 19 then they cry unto
[1:12:09] the Lord in their trouble and he saved
[1:12:11] them out of their distress he sent his
[1:12:13] word and healed them and delivered them
[1:12:16] from their destructions
[1:12:18] how did he heal how did he deliver he
[1:12:20] sent his word
[1:12:21] what has he sent us in this day his word
[1:12:24] how will he heal how will he deliver he
[1:12:27] has sent his word
[1:12:28] amen
[1:12:30] when we talk about the word we're not
[1:12:32] talking about a repeating of of words
[1:12:35] that you can read by having literacy
[1:12:38] we're talking about a person we're
[1:12:40] talking about God the word was with God
[1:12:42] the Word was God
[1:12:44] the word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[1:12:46] Us amen the the revealed word for the
[1:12:48] hour is Jesus Christ the anointed word
[1:12:51] it is God it is Christ it is our
[1:12:54] bridegroom it is our husband we're not
[1:12:56] talking about words on paper we're not
[1:12:59] talking about words that men speak from
[1:13:01] their own thoughts I mean we're not
[1:13:03] talking about that we are talking about
[1:13:05] a realm so much higher than that when
[1:13:07] we're talking about the word we're
[1:13:09] talking about God
[1:13:11] because the word was with God and the
[1:13:14] Word was God
[1:13:16] God in the word is the same thing
[1:13:19] and the anointed word is Jesus Christ
[1:13:23] he is the word
[1:13:25] and so now giving reverence to that I
[1:13:28] don't think we can reference it enough
[1:13:31] and this man this Gregory he never was
[1:13:34] anointed with all hands weren't laid up
[1:13:36] and there's nothing wrong with that
[1:13:37] that's all still the word that's all
[1:13:39] fine but just his respect and honor and
[1:13:42] reverence and submission to the word
[1:13:44] that he had heard preached during the
[1:13:46] camp
[1:13:50] what what really blessed me with this
[1:13:53] testimony the testimony itself blessed
[1:13:56] me
[1:13:56] but what really blessed me is before the
[1:14:00] service has started I was praying and I
[1:14:02] said God
[1:14:03] I pray that you would vindicate the
[1:14:06] ministry of the word to the people so
[1:14:08] that they know these things are true
[1:14:15] you know in doing in doing that
[1:14:20] I never called for a manifestation
[1:14:23] never called for a prayer line never
[1:14:26] I just asked God to vindicate his word
[1:14:28] so that people would know
[1:14:31] and without any of those things God did
[1:14:33] exactly what I asked him to do he
[1:14:34] Vindicated his word
[1:14:37] he Vindicated his word he proved that
[1:14:40] the preaching of the Gospel is still his
[1:14:42] way
[1:14:44] that he still is using ministers who he
[1:14:48] can use to preach the word and anoint
[1:14:50] them with the Holy Ghost and the
[1:14:52] anointed preaching is still God's way
[1:14:56] and I was so very and that was I didn't
[1:14:59] have any that wasn't my expectation like
[1:15:02] to hear the brother's testimony I wasn't
[1:15:04] expecting it I didn't know what God
[1:15:06] would do I just wanted God to let the
[1:15:07] people know that this word is true
[1:15:09] amen that's what I wanted and God did
[1:15:12] that
[1:15:12] there was a few people who came up
[1:15:14] Saturday evening for prayer brother
[1:15:16] Gabrielle matanya he opened up if
[1:15:17] anybody would like special prayer
[1:15:19] special needs for special prayer and
[1:15:21] there was a couple dozen who came one by
[1:15:23] one and it was different ministers
[1:15:24] praying but Gabrielle was praying
[1:15:26] brother Andreas and myself were praying
[1:15:29] for different ones who would come and
[1:15:31] there was one man who came and he was
[1:15:33] praying for healing for a friend he was
[1:15:34] standing in for a friend who had some
[1:15:36] injury to a leg or or something like
[1:15:39] that and and the next day Monday we were
[1:15:41] going to leave brother Gabrielle told me
[1:15:43] he says I got a text message he said
[1:15:45] that man wanted to let me know his
[1:15:47] friend is healed
[1:15:48] said praise God it was so simple I mean
[1:15:52] it was really so simple it wasn't
[1:15:54] anything that was really Dynamic it
[1:15:57] wasn't a super Dynamic prayer it wasn't
[1:15:59] anything it was really just really
[1:16:00] simple just power heads together and
[1:16:02] we'll pray and that was it but God
[1:16:05] honored his word because they were
[1:16:07] honoring God's word
[1:16:09] the honor went back and forth
[1:16:11] people were receiving God's word and
[1:16:13] honoring God and God was honoring those
[1:16:16] who honored him
[1:16:18] I thought it was beautiful and it
[1:16:20] blessed me
[1:16:22] and I started thinking about this and
[1:16:25] this is just a couple of quotes that I
[1:16:27] want to share
[1:16:28] thinking about how privileged we are
[1:16:31] that God
[1:16:34] you know the word has been delivered to
[1:16:36] us and under the preaching of the word
[1:16:38] God is giving of himself
[1:16:42] every time he's giving of himself
[1:16:44] when you listen to that tape God's
[1:16:46] giving of himself when you listen to the
[1:16:48] prophet when you come to the church and
[1:16:51] you come to the preaching of the word
[1:16:52] God's giving of himself
[1:16:55] and our attitude towards that means
[1:16:58] everything
[1:17:00] that means everything if we recognize
[1:17:02] what this is
[1:17:04] you know we're not going to hear a
[1:17:07] certain brother preach that's not what
[1:17:09] we're going for
[1:17:10] if we're going for that we need to
[1:17:12] change our thinking a little bit and Fly
[1:17:13] Above the carnal and move out of that I
[1:17:17] I am going to hear from God I'm going to
[1:17:19] receive something from God and God has a
[1:17:22] way to do that he has many ways to do
[1:17:24] that but one of the ways God does that
[1:17:26] is through the fivefold ministry he
[1:17:28] takes a vessel clay vessel pot that's
[1:17:32] just as no different than anybody else
[1:17:34] but there's one that he's chosen he's
[1:17:36] put a gift in and he's going to use that
[1:17:37] as a channel my inspiration he's going
[1:17:40] to channel himself out to the people and
[1:17:42] now you're not receiving the words of a
[1:17:44] man now when we sit in our seats and
[1:17:46] receive the word and say Amen to the
[1:17:48] word we're receiving God
[1:17:51] we're receiving God we're receiving uh
[1:17:55] uh he's he's giving us another portion
[1:17:57] of himself he's unveiling himself to us
[1:18:00] in a in another way in another form and
[1:18:03] and our attitudes towards that means the
[1:18:05] world Amen brother Gregory had the right
[1:18:08] attitude towards the preaching of the
[1:18:10] word and he was healed
[1:18:13] man
[1:18:15] praise God
[1:18:16] it really just has done something for me
[1:18:19] I looked into this message look from
[1:18:22] 1963 brother Ben said there's nothing
[1:18:24] like music you know God heals by music
[1:18:27] did you know that God heals by music God
[1:18:29] heals by love
[1:18:31] got healed by medicine God heals by
[1:18:33] prayer God has many ways of healing
[1:18:35] depends on what type that you need
[1:18:37] sometimes a little love stretched out
[1:18:39] will just cure an old sore an old place
[1:18:41] that's been a grudge or something it'll
[1:18:43] heal it right over Just a Little Love a
[1:18:46] Little care
[1:18:48] and the message he cares do you care he
[1:18:51] says
[1:18:52] and we believe that doctors help people
[1:18:56] I believe that God heals by medicine God
[1:18:58] heals by surgery God heals by
[1:19:00] understanding
[1:19:02] by understanding
[1:19:04] that's a gift revelation
[1:19:07] God heals by love
[1:19:09] a little love goes a long way let
[1:19:11] somebody be all upset and just show them
[1:19:14] you care for them God heals by love God
[1:19:16] heals by prayer God heals by Miracles
[1:19:19] God heals by his word God heals whatever
[1:19:22] Source it is God heals by it it's God
[1:19:25] that heals for he said I'm the Lord that
[1:19:27] healeth all thy diseases
[1:19:31] I started thinking about the simplicity
[1:19:34] of coming to church
[1:19:37] coming to church just coming to church
[1:19:42] in our attitude towards that
[1:19:45] means everything
[1:19:47] the way we come the our approach to it
[1:19:50] our our the the the way we approach it
[1:19:54] and our attitude towards the Simplicity
[1:19:56] of coming to church on a Sunday and
[1:19:57] Wednesday will determine what we get out
[1:20:00] of the service and what we leave with
[1:20:05] and
[1:20:07] during the service now brother Brandon
[1:20:09] makes this statement he said God heals
[1:20:12] by understanding you can look at it two
[1:20:14] different ways by understanding one
[1:20:15] another in love or by understanding the
[1:20:18] word
[1:20:19] God heals my understanding God heals by
[1:20:21] love God heals by prayer God heals by
[1:20:24] the word
[1:20:26] he says doctors God heals by music God
[1:20:30] heals by medicine God heals by surgery
[1:20:32] God heals
[1:20:34] but if you look at all the things that
[1:20:35] God says he heals by
[1:20:38] let's start to think of how many you
[1:20:40] find in a church service
[1:20:42] and coming together according to the
[1:20:44] word of forsaking not the assembling of
[1:20:46] ourselves together
[1:20:48] you have love
[1:20:50] because of the fellowship when we greet
[1:20:52] each other after church when we turn and
[1:20:54] shake each other's hand when we greet
[1:20:56] them coming in and going out that's an
[1:20:57] expression of love
[1:20:59] God heals by prayer
[1:21:01] God heals by the word God heals by music
[1:21:10] this the simple Act of coming to church
[1:21:12] without even asking to be healed or
[1:21:15] asking to be prayed for just coming to
[1:21:17] church is a source of healing amen
[1:21:20] how many of you ever felt a little under
[1:21:22] the weather and kind of crummy and were
[1:21:24] sick or injured and didn't really feel
[1:21:25] like coming to church but you came to
[1:21:27] church anyways
[1:21:28] and how many went home feeling fine
[1:21:30] raise your hand
[1:21:33] what was that it wasn't your lucky day
[1:21:38] amen because just honoring God honoring
[1:21:41] word he's providing just in a simple
[1:21:43] church service he's providing so many
[1:21:45] things that the prophet said we're
[1:21:46] healed by by music by Prayer by a good
[1:21:49] Atmosphere by the word by love
[1:21:55] oh if we had the right attitude towards
[1:21:58] that and the right attitude towards each
[1:21:59] other how much more could we get out of
[1:22:01] the simple Obedience of just coming to
[1:22:03] church
[1:22:05] amen
[1:22:08] Hebrews 10 24 says and let us consider
[1:22:11] one another to provoke unto love and the
[1:22:13] good works not forsaking the assembling
[1:22:15] of ourselves together as the manner of
[1:22:17] some is but exhorting one another and so
[1:22:19] much more as you see the day approaching
[1:22:23] part of the Apostle Paul tells us he
[1:22:26] tells us to symbol ourselves together
[1:22:27] brother Bram takes this and tells us
[1:22:29] from the same scripture he tells us go
[1:22:31] to church
[1:22:32] everybody needs a home Church where they
[1:22:34] Fellowship together everybody needs a
[1:22:36] church and then you got to ask
[1:22:38] yourselves why did why did Apostle Paul
[1:22:41] give this commandment why did God give
[1:22:43] us the Commandment why the the prophet
[1:22:45] encourage us to go to church and have a
[1:22:47] home church and he said if the Holy
[1:22:48] Ghost is in your heart you can't wait
[1:22:49] for them doors to open to come in
[1:22:51] fellowship with your brothers and
[1:22:52] sisters
[1:22:53] why now the question was who is church
[1:22:56] for
[1:22:57] what is this commandment all about then
[1:23:00] you realize God doesn't need this
[1:23:03] I need this
[1:23:05] this commandment is for me for my
[1:23:07] benefit for my welfare for my growth for
[1:23:10] my strength for my healing amen God
[1:23:12] would not have had the Apostle Paul give
[1:23:14] us this commandment God doesn't need us
[1:23:16] to come to church
[1:23:18] we need to come to church we need
[1:23:22] Fellowship we need one another we need
[1:23:24] love we need
[1:23:26] this is something we need this is for
[1:23:29] our benefit this is not a the keeping of
[1:23:31] a law to keep a law this is not a
[1:23:34] requirement to get into heaven this is
[1:23:36] God's supplying a need
[1:23:38] God giving us the best thing he can give
[1:23:41] us what we need what will benefit us
[1:23:43] what will bless us and if we come now if
[1:23:46] we see that this is for us now we come
[1:23:48] with the right attitude towards what God
[1:23:50] has asked us to do for our benefit we
[1:23:53] can get the full benefit out of what
[1:23:55] God's asked us to do
[1:23:56] but it all depends on our approach
[1:24:00] brother Brown said it's your attitude
[1:24:02] towards your approach towards the Divine
[1:24:05] working of God will determine what
[1:24:07] you'll get out of it
[1:24:10] if you come and say well glory to God
[1:24:12] stand there and chew your chewing gum
[1:24:13] and say I'm just going around to see
[1:24:15] them Holy Rollers is doing I didn't see
[1:24:18] nothing I never seen them just a bunch
[1:24:21] of Maniacs look if you come to criticize
[1:24:23] the devil will give you something to
[1:24:25] criticize
[1:24:27] that's easy
[1:24:29] criticizing is easier if you want to sit
[1:24:32] in the house of criticism and come to
[1:24:34] church with that the devil is your best
[1:24:36] friend and he's on your side and I mean
[1:24:38] he'll open your eye you talk about
[1:24:40] Revelation you'll get Revelation if you
[1:24:42] come with a spirit of criticism the
[1:24:44] spirit of revelation will strike you and
[1:24:46] you'll see every fault possible
[1:24:49] it's amazing
[1:24:50] it's amazing how clear your vision will
[1:24:52] be
[1:24:54] because you'll be anointed of the wrong
[1:24:55] spirit
[1:24:57] because that criticizing spirit's not
[1:24:59] from God
[1:25:00] in his E I mean criticism is easy
[1:25:05] but he says if you come to find good
[1:25:08] God will show you something good
[1:25:10] it depends on what you're looking for
[1:25:15] when we come to church what do we come
[1:25:17] for what was our attitude and Company
[1:25:19] what was our motive in coming what did
[1:25:22] we desire in coming
[1:25:23] you know there's many reasons we come
[1:25:26] and it's not like we can put this off of
[1:25:28] this is this person's reason and this is
[1:25:30] this no we each one have come to church
[1:25:32] for many different reasons over the
[1:25:34] years
[1:25:35] all of us
[1:25:36] some of us have come out of obligation
[1:25:41] some of us have come for our family
[1:25:45] some of us have come so that we can have
[1:25:47] Fellowship afterwards
[1:25:50] I mean I should just say me I shouldn't
[1:25:51] say some of us Through The Years my
[1:25:54] motive and my desire and my purpose in
[1:25:56] coming has not always been pure for
[1:25:58] every service I came to
[1:26:02] and I realized looking back
[1:26:04] that I got out of the service
[1:26:07] what my attitude and expectation was
[1:26:12] but oh God if I see the potential oh God
[1:26:16] help me to come with different Vision
[1:26:18] different expectation help me come
[1:26:21] realizing that this is Supernatural this
[1:26:23] is your provided way this is something
[1:26:25] you you want to give us and it and it's
[1:26:28] not only the preaching it's the whole
[1:26:31] package it's the fellowship it's the
[1:26:33] love it's the worship it's the
[1:26:35] opportunity to express your love to God
[1:26:37] through the songs it's the atmosphere
[1:26:39] the music creates it's the atmosphere of
[1:26:42] quiet time before coming and praying and
[1:26:43] quieting ourselves it's the whole
[1:26:45] package comes together to bring healing
[1:26:48] and it's not just physical healing we
[1:26:51] need emotional healing we need mental
[1:26:53] healing amen we we need we need our past
[1:26:56] heal from us we need all kinds of
[1:26:58] healing and we can get it if we come
[1:27:00] with the right attitude
[1:27:02] [Music]
[1:27:04] praise God
[1:27:06] in Galatians 4 Apostle Paul says in my
[1:27:09] Temptation which was in my flesh ye
[1:27:11] despise not he's talking about when his
[1:27:14] trial his fleshly ailment you despise
[1:27:16] not nor rejected
[1:27:18] but recede me as an angel of God even
[1:27:22] ask Christ Jesus
[1:27:27] I've read that before
[1:27:30] but when you really stop and read what
[1:27:33] Paul's writing it's remarkable
[1:27:36] he says you received me as an angel of
[1:27:39] God well I can take that an angel's a
[1:27:41] messenger and received you as a man you
[1:27:43] received me as an angel of God okay yeah
[1:27:46] that makes sense I can go along with
[1:27:48] that intellectually as a human being
[1:27:51] but the next statement is going to take
[1:27:53] a revelation from God not intellectual
[1:27:55] understanding
[1:27:56] you receive me as an angel of God even
[1:27:59] as Christ Jesus
[1:28:04] they received the Apostle Paul in his
[1:28:07] ministry as Christ Jesus
[1:28:14] you were talking about walking a Razor's
[1:28:16] Edge now we're getting down to the
[1:28:17] razor's Edge and only the only the elect
[1:28:20] could walk this by faith
[1:28:22] because if you make Paul Jesus Christ
[1:28:25] and the person you've made him
[1:28:27] Antichrist
[1:28:29] but if you make you if you make what's
[1:28:32] working through him in the ministry
[1:28:34] coming through anything different than
[1:28:35] Jesus Christ you're wrong
[1:28:39] so when brother Branham was here amen
[1:28:41] somebody asked a question of questions
[1:28:42] answered could you be Jesus Christ or
[1:28:44] could Jesus Christ look like you or they
[1:28:46] were kind of him hauling around with the
[1:28:47] question and brother Benham says now now
[1:28:50] in one way that's right and in one way
[1:28:52] that's wrong
[1:28:53] so to make me the person of Jesus Christ
[1:28:55] would we make me Antichrist
[1:28:57] but to say that Christ was in me or
[1:28:59] using me or something like that now that
[1:29:01] would be exactly right
[1:29:03] so now when they receive the Apostle
[1:29:05] Paul the Apostle Paul was not the the
[1:29:09] full embodiment of Jesus Christ
[1:29:12] but who was ministering through Paul who
[1:29:15] was bringing the word who was that amen
[1:29:18] remember brother Brenham said the five
[1:29:21] full ministry is the dress where the
[1:29:23] inner dress wear the under close
[1:29:27] of of Jesus Christ
[1:29:30] so
[1:29:31] what is inside the underclose
[1:29:35] Jesus Christ
[1:29:37] who's the veil hiding and remember it's
[1:29:40] the five-fold ministry that was the
[1:29:42] undergarment amen the underneath clothes
[1:29:44] this is what brother Branham tells is
[1:29:46] the underneath clothes so what does that
[1:29:47] make the fightful ministry the very
[1:29:49] closest thing on earth to Jesus Christ
[1:29:54] because they're touching his skin
[1:29:56] the underneath clothes
[1:29:59] so how should we approach the preaching
[1:30:02] of the word
[1:30:03] how should we approach our brothers and
[1:30:05] sisters how should we approach the
[1:30:07] fellowship
[1:30:09] well I can take him as an angel of the
[1:30:12] Lord because angel means messenger
[1:30:15] can we go by Revelation a step beyond
[1:30:18] that
[1:30:21] well I can believe that for Paul because
[1:30:22] it was written in the Bible
[1:30:25] see that's all the intellectual side
[1:30:28] but by Revelation can we go above that
[1:30:30] and unlock the full potential of obeying
[1:30:33] the Lord the full potential of the
[1:30:35] Simplicity of coming to church but
[1:30:37] coming with the right frame of mind I
[1:30:39] have not come to hear a man preach I
[1:30:41] have come to hear Christ Jesus speak
[1:30:42] through a vessel he chose and placed a
[1:30:45] gift in before the foundation of the
[1:30:46] world and I'm trusting that God will
[1:30:48] operate by the Holy Ghost through that
[1:30:50] vessel
[1:30:53] I'm coming to see my brothers and
[1:30:55] sisters which are not just merely flesh
[1:30:57] and blood but they're the attributes of
[1:30:59] God that have been distributed into this
[1:31:01] world that I had fellowship with before
[1:31:02] the foundation of the world and when I
[1:31:04] hugged them I'm not hugging a human
[1:31:06] being amen I'm embracing an attribute
[1:31:08] inside of that amen coming back in
[1:31:11] contact with what I was in contact
[1:31:12] before the foundation of the world
[1:31:15] if we can come without the carnal side
[1:31:17] and go beyond the carnal side and not
[1:31:20] just you know it's it's 6 p.m eat our
[1:31:23] dinner in a hurry oh we got church
[1:31:25] tonight I'm so tired
[1:31:27] got to put a tie on there some of us put
[1:31:30] a tie on
[1:31:32] gotta wash my face I gotta
[1:31:35] eat my dinner real fast and oh I'm just
[1:31:37] so tired it'd be nice to have a night
[1:31:39] off
[1:31:42] Hey listen I fought those thoughts
[1:31:45] before
[1:31:48] but that's the natural side that's the
[1:31:51] natural life that's the way the natural
[1:31:52] world is
[1:31:54] you're tired you've worked the kids are
[1:31:56] fussing one of them might be having a
[1:31:58] fever and that's just the excuse it
[1:32:01] might
[1:32:04] I've been there I know
[1:32:09] I don't have to point out what you're
[1:32:10] doing all I have to do is point out what
[1:32:12] I've done and if I point what I've done
[1:32:14] if I point out what I've done I've
[1:32:16] exposed everybody
[1:32:20] because we've all lived a natural human
[1:32:22] life we're all stuck
[1:32:24] but then all of a sudden if something
[1:32:25] another sweeping thought can come in on
[1:32:28] top of all those thoughts and say but
[1:32:30] God said
[1:32:33] but God said
[1:32:35] and I want to honor God and I want to
[1:32:37] show what's important in my life and I
[1:32:39] want to come for other reasons not even
[1:32:41] to get something I just want to go show
[1:32:42] God that I love him more than I love my
[1:32:44] rest more than I love my job more than I
[1:32:46] love anything else that I love God the
[1:32:48] most
[1:32:49] if you honor God and your honor his word
[1:32:52] the word will work and ways we never
[1:32:54] imagined it's not like one for one
[1:32:59] God's so much more than that I I came to
[1:33:02] show God I love him I came to have
[1:33:04] Fellowship I came to hear the word but
[1:33:06] God did more than that he healed me he
[1:33:08] lifted my spirit he healed that stress
[1:33:11] that it was building up in me and by the
[1:33:12] time I walk out of the service I'm not
[1:33:14] stressed anymore the very reason that I
[1:33:16] was feeling not to come to church is all
[1:33:17] eliminated by the service by the
[1:33:19] preaching of the word by the singing by
[1:33:21] the fellowship and I go home completely
[1:33:22] different than the way I can
[1:33:26] I don't know about you but I've had many
[1:33:28] times in my life I've contemplated
[1:33:30] you're sitting on the edge should I go
[1:33:31] or not go I don't really feel good I'm a
[1:33:33] little bit late I'm feeling rushed go or
[1:33:35] not go and there have been there I've
[1:33:38] made I've made decisions on both sides
[1:33:39] so we'll just get the cat out of the bag
[1:33:42] I made the decision because I was at
[1:33:44] that cusp I had to make a decision and I
[1:33:46] was a little bit tired a little bit worn
[1:33:48] a little bit this and had just enough
[1:33:49] excuses
[1:33:51] to stay home and I stayed home
[1:33:54] and it was the most miserable night of
[1:33:56] my life
[1:33:57] has anybody ever missed church because
[1:33:59] you were too rushed too tired not
[1:34:00] feeling good and you stayed home
[1:34:01] miserable feeling like you missed
[1:34:03] something and I'm missing something and
[1:34:05] I should be there and it's too late now
[1:34:07] and I made the wrong choice
[1:34:10] I've been there
[1:34:14] and whenever I get there I said I will
[1:34:15] never do this again God help me please
[1:34:17] never to do this again
[1:34:20] but there are times when we need the
[1:34:22] other choice
[1:34:23] say no I'm going anyways
[1:34:25] and I'm so glad I did
[1:34:29] so glad I did
[1:34:32] the sermon is not about church
[1:34:33] attendance
[1:34:34] I hope you understand
[1:34:36] it's about our attitude our approach to
[1:34:40] God towards the word of God
[1:34:43] the same thing's true for reading your
[1:34:46] Bible for praying for reading the
[1:34:48] message for listen the same thing the
[1:34:51] right attitude the right approach
[1:34:53] I had a brother tell me that they were
[1:34:55] playing a tape in the church every once
[1:34:56] in a while he likes to play a tape kind
[1:34:58] of like what we do they do it a little
[1:34:59] different but he says they were playing
[1:35:01] that tape in church
[1:35:02] and there was a sister sitting there
[1:35:04] that needed to be healed there was
[1:35:06] something wrong oh I'll tell you a
[1:35:09] I I hope I get the details right
[1:35:13] yeah it was a sister yeah a sister with
[1:35:16] diabetes
[1:35:17] and when we were in the house of
[1:35:21] uh the more uh
[1:35:25] whatever the house where we were all
[1:35:26] singing and having Fellowship I showed
[1:35:28] you the video
[1:35:29] uh the Missouri house when we were
[1:35:31] sitting in that house one of the
[1:35:33] daughter-in-laws of one of the sons was
[1:35:35] telling us a testimony they were in the
[1:35:37] church and that night they were playing
[1:35:38] a tape in the church and she had been
[1:35:40] diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and the
[1:35:43] brother Branham said you little sister
[1:35:45] there sitting there with diabetes the
[1:35:48] Lord stand to your feet in the Lord Heal
[1:35:50] you she stood up and was instantly
[1:35:52] healed
[1:35:54] and never had a problem with diabetes
[1:35:56] again
[1:35:59] what was that
[1:36:01] it was her respect to the word of God
[1:36:04] her attitude towards that this is this
[1:36:07] is they're playing a tape this isn't
[1:36:10] even life preaching but God honored her
[1:36:12] attitude
[1:36:14] amen and if God would not let one of
[1:36:17] Samuel the prophet's words fall to the
[1:36:19] ground will he let one of brother
[1:36:20] branhams fall to the ground if you can
[1:36:23] believe it's for you if you can believe
[1:36:24] it amen she just she took it without
[1:36:27] thinking she took it without reasoning
[1:36:29] she just took it
[1:36:31] and God honored her respect Amen to the
[1:36:33] word of God
[1:36:34] what a testimony
[1:36:37] I say God if you can do that you can do
[1:36:39] anything if I can just respect you in
[1:36:41] your ways
[1:36:43] brother Bram goes on to say he says your
[1:36:44] attitude God can send a gift
[1:36:47] and no matter what it depends on what
[1:36:50] attitude you take towards it
[1:36:53] listen
[1:36:54] the gift whether it's brother branham's
[1:36:57] gift for healing
[1:36:58] whether it was the gift of Deliverance
[1:37:00] or the gift in the Pulpit to preach that
[1:37:03] gift cannot override your bad attitude
[1:37:07] no matter how powerful the gift is Jesus
[1:37:10] Christ himself could not override
[1:37:12] unbelief
[1:37:13] because when he went and took Capernaum
[1:37:16] he could not do many mighty works
[1:37:17] because of their unbelief
[1:37:19] even brother Branham as powerful as the
[1:37:22] gift of healing was within him that gift
[1:37:24] could not override your bad attitude
[1:37:29] so he says depends on what attitude you
[1:37:31] take towards it
[1:37:33] this is why it's so horrible to
[1:37:35] criticize Ministry
[1:37:37] so horrible to criticize brothers and
[1:37:39] sisters with a gift whether singing or
[1:37:42] or whatever playing it's a horrible
[1:37:44] thing to criticize
[1:37:46] because if God sends a gift we need to
[1:37:48] re receive it is from God
[1:37:51] because our attitude towards that
[1:37:52] depends on whether it will work for us
[1:37:54] or not
[1:37:57] it depends on what attitude you take
[1:37:58] towards it look at them who smote his
[1:38:00] look at them who smote his face and spit
[1:38:03] on him and everything was no virtue
[1:38:05] there
[1:38:06] they were touching the Lord they laid
[1:38:08] their hands on him
[1:38:10] and they got no strength whatsoever from
[1:38:13] their contact
[1:38:14] physical contact
[1:38:17] but a woman that believed it believed
[1:38:20] it was touched the Hem of His Garment
[1:38:23] and was healed
[1:38:25] the soldiers had hand-to-hand contact
[1:38:27] hand to face contact they were touching
[1:38:30] his skin she never touched his skin she
[1:38:32] touched the Hem of His Garment and God
[1:38:33] honored her reverence and respect and
[1:38:36] her attitude and she was healed
[1:38:38] instantly those soldiers got no healing
[1:38:42] same person same gifts same everything
[1:38:46] is that right it depends on what you
[1:38:48] think about it
[1:38:50] God sends it it's your attitude towards
[1:38:53] any Divine gift determines what you get
[1:38:55] out of it
[1:38:57] that's why you can have two people go to
[1:38:59] church one person will go with the
[1:39:01] answer to their question with
[1:39:02] Deliverance with Direction and the other
[1:39:03] person said I got nothing out of that I
[1:39:05] don't even know what he was talking
[1:39:06] about
[1:39:09] the real question is not not what the
[1:39:14] man was preaching the real question
[1:39:15] sometimes is how did you come through
[1:39:17] those doors
[1:39:19] because how you came through those doors
[1:39:21] is how you went right back out
[1:39:23] you came expecting an answer you came
[1:39:25] with reverence you came with respect you
[1:39:26] came believing you came knowing that
[1:39:28] this is the place God answers that God
[1:39:30] uses the ministry God brings his word
[1:39:32] I'll get my answer you get it
[1:39:34] praise God you come and say oh this
[1:39:36] brother's preaching
[1:39:44] and we go right back out the way we came
[1:39:46] in
[1:39:49] sometimes it's not the brother preaching
[1:39:51] sometimes it's our attitude towards the
[1:39:54] gift
[1:39:56] that doesn't mean every brother preaches
[1:39:58] right and everything that said you know
[1:39:59] what I mean
[1:40:01] preachers are humans too they make
[1:40:03] mistakes they say things wrong that's
[1:40:04] normal
[1:40:06] but we have to have the right attitude
[1:40:09] we have to have the right attitude
[1:40:13] but everyone says see you see it's your
[1:40:17] approach to God what brings the results
[1:40:20] what brings the results the gift
[1:40:23] no my approach to the gift
[1:40:26] is what brings the results
[1:40:28] brother Brennan said to the people he
[1:40:30] said that's the reason I can help you is
[1:40:33] because you believe in me
[1:40:34] if you didn't believe me I couldn't help
[1:40:36] you
[1:40:38] so you see how important are approaches
[1:40:42] I say God give me the right approach
[1:40:46] I want to have the approach that brother
[1:40:48] Gregory from Germany had when one day he
[1:40:52] was that night he was hobbling on a
[1:40:54] crutch I saw him at night Sunset 10
[1:40:57] o'clock at night he's on a crutch
[1:41:00] the next morning he comes to pick us up
[1:41:02] when we finish our breakfast no crutch
[1:41:04] what happened between Sunday night he
[1:41:06] was expressing his reverence for what
[1:41:08] was preached and believing it came from
[1:41:10] God
[1:41:13] I said God let me have that reverence
[1:41:15] towards you and toward the things that
[1:41:17] come from you let me have reverence God
[1:41:21] let me respect your way and honor your
[1:41:23] way respect your gifts let me come to
[1:41:26] church with an expectation
[1:41:30] let me come with the right attitude let
[1:41:32] me come knowing this is your method your
[1:41:34] place your way this is where I belong
[1:41:36] this is where you've placed me in God
[1:41:39] and I'm expecting to hear from you I'm
[1:41:40] expecting to get healed I'm expecting to
[1:41:42] walk out of here better than when I came
[1:41:44] there
[1:41:46] amen let's all stand
[1:41:50] you can see it's been a good trip for me
[1:41:54] it's not just a trip I feel like every
[1:41:56] time I travel and everywhere I go I
[1:41:58] learn something
[1:41:59] something opens up on a different level
[1:42:01] God is always teaching me it's not you
[1:42:04] know you know the in reality with God
[1:42:06] it's never just give give give it's
[1:42:08] always give and receive
[1:42:10] give and receive and that's been the way
[1:42:12] it is everywhere I've ever went and some
[1:42:14] of these testimonies that I heard they
[1:42:16] just absolutely blessed my soul and they
[1:42:19] settled something in me and I realized
[1:42:22] you know what I'm going to have to watch
[1:42:25] my attitude
[1:42:26] I'm going to have to check up and make
[1:42:31] sure that I'm approaching things of God
[1:42:33] the right way
[1:42:35] I always want God God you heal me God
[1:42:37] you deliver me God you do this God you
[1:42:39] say my family God you do you do you do
[1:42:41] you do and the question is what am I
[1:42:43] doing
[1:42:44] what's my attitude what's my Approach
[1:42:46] what's my surrender what's my submission
[1:42:49] sometimes God has already done it
[1:42:53] you mean brother Ted he's already done
[1:42:56] it you have a believing Church there's a
[1:42:59] Ministry that will preach the word we
[1:43:00] have the message of the hour we have God
[1:43:03] has already done it
[1:43:06] It's just sometimes we're out of
[1:43:08] sequence with what God's already
[1:43:09] provided the healing's already here the
[1:43:11] Deliverance is already here if you've
[1:43:13] got emotional strain the healing's here
[1:43:15] if you've got a physical need the
[1:43:16] healing's here if you need direction in
[1:43:18] your life amen the son of man is still
[1:43:21] here
[1:43:22] yeah he's pretty he's already provided
[1:43:24] God I need this God I need that and
[1:43:26] God's already provided it in God's
[1:43:28] provided way we just have to have the
[1:43:30] right attitude and the right approach
[1:43:32] towards it and we'll draw out of it
[1:43:34] everything he's given for us
[1:43:36] what did he send he sent his word
[1:43:39] what has he sent this day through
[1:43:40] through the seventh Angels through the
[1:43:42] prophet of the eight he sent the word
[1:43:44] what do you have need of whatever you
[1:43:46] have need of is in the word this message
[1:43:48] contains what we need it's our approach
[1:43:50] to it that'll determine what we get out
[1:43:52] of it
[1:43:54] our approach to one another
[1:43:56] is our approach to the things of God our
[1:43:58] approach to brothers and sisters
[1:44:00] is our approach to the things of God our
[1:44:03] approach with the ministry our approach
[1:44:04] to brother Branham our approach to the
[1:44:06] Bible our approach to this is our
[1:44:08] approach to God Amen
[1:44:12] I want to hey this is the greatest
[1:44:15] Revelation that has struck the Earth
[1:44:17] because it's what's been sealed in the
[1:44:19] back part of God's mind is now unsealed
[1:44:21] and available to the children of God by
[1:44:24] revelation
[1:44:25] I believe that holds the answers holds
[1:44:28] the healing holds the delivery I believe
[1:44:29] it holds everything
[1:44:31] it'll just take my approach to it amen
