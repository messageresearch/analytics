[12:02] come to hear your word we've come to
[12:05] receive from you that portion that
[12:07] you've reserved for this day a special
[12:10] portion Lord that only you can meet out
[12:12] for God you know what portion needs to
[12:15] come in due season Lord and God we're
[12:17] just asking that you would take control
[12:19] of this festival and that you would
[12:20] bring your word the way you desired to
[12:22] bring it and God I pray you would help
[12:24] me just to stay out of the way and stay

[12:44] forth may we receive it Lord with
[12:46] gladness and with joy and may it
[12:48] translate into a life within us Lord we
[12:51] love you and we ask that you would come
[12:53] and break the bread of life this evening
[12:56] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[12:59] amen amen God bless you it's certainly
[13:01] good to be here with you this evening
[13:04] amen it's good to see more and more
[13:05] coming back after bouts of sickness so
[13:07] praise the Lord I hope that that has
[13:10] passed us for this season but may God be
[13:13] glorified he's been good to us if um if
[13:16] you could while we're standing let's
[13:18] turn to the book of
[13:19] Isaiah Isaiah
[13:21] 61 also want to let you know that uh at
[13:24] the communion service we took a vote for
[13:26] the trustees in the super uh Sunday
[13:28] School superintend it and all were
[13:30] confirmed once again by the body and
[13:32] they expressed their confidence in these
[13:33] brothers so we thank God for that and
[13:35] thank God for all of you being here to
[13:37] take part in that amen God has certainly
[13:40] provided everything that we have need of
[13:43] amen amen let's begin reading here in
[13:46] Isaiah
[13:48] 61 um I'm going to begin in verse one
[13:51] Isaiah 61 verse
[13:54] one the spirit of the Lord God is upon
[13:57] me because the Lord has anointed me to
[13:59] preach Good Tidings unto the meek Heath
[14:02] sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to
[14:04] Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the
[14:06] opening of prison to them that are bound
[14:09] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[14:11] lord we know that when Jesus was present
[14:14] he took the scroll when he read that
[14:16] scripture and he said this day this
[14:18] scripture uh this what did he
[14:22] say Amen say it again fulf this day the
[14:26] script fulfilled amen praise the Lord
[14:28] that's the word I was looking for this
[14:29] day this scripture is fulfilled in your
[14:31] eyes and then he sat down and glorious
[14:34] words proceeded from his mouth amen but
[14:36] that brother B said was his first coming
[14:38] the second part pertains to his second
[14:40] coming and that pertains to our day and
[14:43] here's what he says
[14:45] next uh I I'll read verse two again to
[14:47] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[14:49] comma that's where he stopped in the day
[14:51] of the Vengeance of our God to comfort
[14:54] all that more and so the day of the
[14:55] Vengeance of our God is this day this is
[14:58] the day that the Lord will take
[14:59] Vengeance he comes as a judge judgment
[15:01] has already begun and it will continue
[15:03] on and break loose completely in the
[15:06] tribulation period but he listen to what
[15:09] else he says to comfort all that mourn
[15:12] so it's not just only judgment but
[15:15] there's also a comforting portion in the
[15:16] second comment to ano to appoint unto
[15:20] them that mourn in Zion to give unto
[15:22] them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for
[15:25] mourning the Garment of Praise for the
[15:27] spirit of heavy this that they might be
[15:30] called Trees of Righteousness the
[15:32] planting of the Lord that he might be
[15:36] glorified that's the part that pertains
[15:38] to us amen amen God bless you as you're
[15:41] seated may the Lord bless us as we look
[15:43] into his
[15:45] word so the part I want to pull out of
[15:47] there is the U the planting of the Lord
[15:49] that we might be Trees of Righteousness
[15:51] the planting of the Lord not our
[15:53] planting his planting we didn't plant
[15:55] ourselves we didn't put ourselves here
[15:57] we didn't do he did it at all amen so
[15:59] it's the planting of the Lord so let's
[16:01] turn together to Matthew
[16:05] 13 and I'm going to I want to look at
[16:08] two Parables today and I'm going to
[16:09] mainly focus on these two Parables and I
[16:12] want to
[16:13] um I want to look at both of them one
[16:16] right after the other and and and tie
[16:17] them together in Matthew
[16:21] 13 let's begin by reading verse 24
[16:24] Matthew
[16:26] 13:24 he says here another Parable put
[16:29] he forth unto them saying the Kingdom of
[16:32] Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed
[16:34] good seed in his field but while men
[16:37] slept his enemy came and S tears among
[16:39] the wheat and went his way but when the
[16:43] blade was sprung up and brought forth
[16:44] fruit then appeared the tears also so
[16:47] the Servants of the householder came and
[16:49] said unto him sir did not thou sow good
[16:52] seed in thy field from whence then hath
[16:54] it tears he said unto them an enemy hath
[16:57] done this the servant said unto him wilt
[16:59] thou then that we go and gather them up
[17:02] but he said nay lest while you gather up
[17:04] the tears you root up also the wheat
[17:06] with them let both grow together until
[17:09] the Harvest and in the time of harvest I
[17:11] will say to the Reapers gather you
[17:13] together first the tears and bind them
[17:15] in bundles to burn them but gather the
[17:17] wheat unto my barn so this is the the
[17:20] parable the parable of of of the man
[17:25] this is the Kingdom of Heaven is likened
[17:27] to a man which swed good seed in his
[17:30] field so it's about a man sowing good
[17:33] seed into his field then afterwards
[17:36] comes an enemy now when Jesus goes to
[17:39] interpret this he picks it up here in
[17:40] verse 34 I and I want to read just ahead
[17:43] of where he begins the interpretation
[17:45] verse 34 he says all these things spake
[17:47] Jesus unto the multitude in Parables and
[17:50] without a parable spake he not unto them
[17:52] that it might be fulfilled which was
[17:53] spoken by the prophet saying I will open
[17:56] my mouth in Parables I will utter things
[17:58] which have been kept secret from the
[18:00] foundation of the world so this Parable
[18:02] is a secret that's been kept a truth
[18:05] that's been kept secret from the
[18:07] foundation of the world verse 36 then
[18:10] Jesus sent the multitude away and went
[18:12] into the house and his disciples came
[18:14] unto him saying declare unto us the
[18:16] parable of the tears of the field he
[18:19] answered and said unto
[18:21] them he that Seth The Good Seed is the
[18:24] son of man the field is the world the
[18:28] good seed are the children of the
[18:29] Kingdom but the tears are the children
[18:31] of the wicked one the enemy that SED
[18:34] them is the devil the Harvest is the end
[18:37] of the world and the reapers are the
[18:38] angels as therefore the tears are
[18:41] gathered and burned in the fire so shall
[18:43] it be in the end of this world the son
[18:45] of man shall send forth his angels and
[18:47] they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all
[18:49] things that offend and them which do
[18:51] iniquity and shall cast them into a
[18:53] furnace of fire there shall be wailing
[18:55] and nashing of teeth then shall the
[18:57] righteous shine forth as the son in the
[18:59] Kingdom of their father who ha ears to
[19:02] hear Let Him hear so this Parable is a
[19:06] secret that's been kept secret a truth
[19:08] been kept secret from the foundation of
[19:10] the world and we see it explains to us
[19:12] the serpent seed how let's go back up to
[19:16] verse 30 uh
[19:19] 37 he that Seth The Good Seed is the son
[19:22] of man the field is the world the good
[19:27] seed are the children of the Kingdom but
[19:29] the tears are the children of the W
[19:31] Wicked one so into the world was sown a
[19:35] good seed and that good seed were the
[19:38] children of the Kingdom but after the
[19:40] good seed were swn into the field Along
[19:42] Came an enemy and the enemy SED another
[19:45] kind of seed and that other kind of seed
[19:47] became the tears brother frankco if you
[19:49] could pull up the Whiteboard I'm going
[19:50] to go to it here just in a second so I
[19:53] want us to recognize that the good seed
[19:55] are the children of the Kingdom brother
[19:57] Bram said in modern events in 1965 he
[20:00] said then if you are a son of God or a
[20:02] daughter of God you were in God all the
[20:04] time but he knew what bed in time that
[20:07] you'd be planted he knew when you would
[20:09] come forth because he SED good seed into
[20:11] his field which is the world and he SED
[20:14] his good seed into his field because he
[20:17] owned the world and he knew when that
[20:19] seed when that crop would come up in
[20:21] what season he knew you would be sitting
[20:23] here tonight he knew when you would come
[20:24] forth he knew what was going to happen
[20:26] in our lives he knew what bed in time
[20:29] that you would be planted so now you're
[20:30] made a creature a Son of God manifested
[20:33] son or daughter of God to meet the
[20:35] challenge of this hour to vindicate the
[20:38] true and living God of this hour the
[20:40] message that's coming forth in this time
[20:43] that's right you was done there before
[20:45] the foundation of the world so before
[20:46] the foundation of the world God sowed
[20:48] seed he SED seed into the world and he
[20:51] knew when those seeds would spring forth
[20:54] he knew when you were going to come on
[20:55] the scene and you were predestinated for
[20:58] for the day and age that you sprung
[21:00] forth amen because this is what he said
[21:03] you were made a creature a Son of God
[21:06] manifested son or daughter of God to
[21:08] meet the challenge of the hour what
[21:10] challenge of what hour the hour that
[21:12] you're living in that's when you came
[21:13] forth that seed was made to meet the
[21:16] challenge of the hour to vindicate the
[21:18] true and living God of this hour the
[21:20] message that's coming forth in this time
[21:23] so if we go if we go
[21:26] here oh I hope I get this
[21:30] right so if we
[21:34] look at the
[21:36] seed in this Parable the seed are the
[21:47] children of the
[21:50] Kingdom all right so the seed that was
[21:53] sowed was the children of the Kingdom
[21:55] that means you and I were part of that
[21:57] seed that good seed
[21:59] amen all right Mark 4 let's go over and
[22:02] look at this other Parable now this is
[22:04] the second one that I want to look at
[22:06] and compare with this
[22:16] one Mark 4 and verse 2 and he taught
[22:21] them many things by Parables and said
[22:23] unto them in his Doctrine hearken behold
[22:26] there went out a s to sew and it came to
[22:29] pass as he sewed some fell by the
[22:31] wayside and the fowls of the air came
[22:34] and devoured it up and some fell on
[22:36] Stony ground where it had not much Earth
[22:38] and immediately it sprang up because it
[22:40] had no depth of Earth but when the sun
[22:42] was up it was scorched and because it
[22:44] had no root it withered away and some
[22:47] fell among thorns and the Thorns grew up
[22:49] and choked it and it yielded no fruit
[22:51] and other fell on good ground and did
[22:53] yield fruit that sprang up and increased
[22:56] and brought forth some 30 and some 60
[22:58] and some
[23:00] 100 then he comes down to the
[23:02] interpretation in verse 13 let's just
[23:04] skip down there and he said unto them
[23:07] know you not this Parable and how then
[23:10] will you know all Parables the swer Seth
[23:13] the word so what was the seed that the
[23:16] sewer went forth to sow that seed was
[23:18] the word right the swer SED the word and
[23:21] these are they by the wayside where the
[23:24] word is sown but when they have heard
[23:26] Satan cometh immediately and taketh away
[23:28] the word that was sown in their hearts
[23:30] and these are they likewise which are
[23:32] sown on Stony ground who when they had
[23:34] heard the word immediately received it
[23:36] with gladness and have no root in
[23:38] themselves and so endure but for a Time
[23:41] afterward when Affliction or persecution
[23:43] arises for the word's sake immediately
[23:45] they are offended and these are they
[23:48] which are swn among Thorns such as hear
[23:50] the word and the cares of the world and
[23:52] the deceitfulness of riches and the lust
[23:54] of other things entering in choked the
[23:57] world and it it became unfruitful and
[24:00] these are they which are swn on good
[24:01] ground such as hear the word and receive
[24:03] it and bring forth fruit some 30-fold
[24:07] some 60 some
[24:10] 100-fold so now we're going to look at
[24:14] this Parable in this
[24:17] Parable the seed
[24:19] now in this Parable is
[24:23] not the children of the
[24:25] Kingdom but this seed
[24:29] is the
[24:30] word so we want to look at both of these
[24:33] Parables together it's amazing how
[24:36] sometimes uh when when God is using a
[24:38] parable he'll use a parable of a seed
[24:40] being swn and that seed is the children
[24:42] of the Kingdom then he makes a parable
[24:44] of seed being swn and that seed being
[24:46] sown is the word and I'd like to take
[24:49] for a title uh for tonight word comes to
[24:53] word word comes to word and we're going
[24:56] to find out that there is a direct
[24:58] correlation between these
[25:00] seeds praise be to God brother M says in
[25:04] the greater than Solomon is here he said
[25:05] all that the father has given me will
[25:07] come and I'm happy for that so we don't
[25:09] know who is and who is not we just
[25:11] scatter forth the seed that's all we can
[25:13] do some Falls by the wayside some Falls
[25:16] this way and that way but some does fall
[25:19] on good ground that's that that ground
[25:22] that's been prepared by God to receive
[25:25] the seed so some Falls this way some
[25:28] Falls that way and brother B says we
[25:30] don't know who's who or what's what we
[25:32] just scatter this seed we just preach
[25:34] the word we just witness we testify we
[25:36] do whatever amen and some Falls this way
[25:39] some Falls that way amen and it's not
[25:41] our responsibility where it falls it's
[25:43] only our responsibility to scatter it
[25:46] but he says but some falls on good
[25:48] ground ground that's been prepared by
[25:51] God to receive the seed so what is good
[25:53] ground good ground is predestinated
[25:56] ground ground that's been prepared by
[25:58] God to receive the
[26:00] seed he says in works of Faith Express
[26:02] from 1965 any seed has to have its
[26:05] ground of course I want you to catch
[26:08] that don't don't let that slip by any
[26:11] seed has to have its
[26:13] ground now if you think about that if
[26:16] I'm going to plant blueberries I need
[26:18] acidic soil if I'm going to plant cedar
[26:21] trees I need a certain kind of soil but
[26:23] if I'm going to PL plant oak trees I
[26:24] need a different kind of soil amen
[26:26] there's a there's ground for every soil
[26:29] amen and some some things grow better in
[26:32] different kinds of
[26:33] ground that's clear you you see a
[26:36] diverse species when you go into the
[26:38] mountains into the valleys and different
[26:40] levels of the mountains at different
[26:41] elevations there's different species of
[26:43] trees and plants because they all have
[26:45] their ground amen so a seed has to have
[26:49] the right kind of ground for that seed
[26:51] to
[26:52] grow so any seed has to have its ground
[26:55] of course therefore all he before knew
[26:58] see he already knew what was going to
[27:00] happen notice Jesus said again about the
[27:02] seeds some fell on rocks others on mixed
[27:04] ground see over where there's Thorns
[27:07] thistles and everything else it could
[27:08] grow it couldn't grow and others on good
[27:11] ground good ground good soil which had
[27:13] been prepared already
[27:17] prepared you know when we look at this
[27:21] brother B's using this uh uh a parable
[27:24] and he's looking at the good ground and
[27:26] he's showing that that's predestined
[27:27] ated Ground God knew where that seed
[27:30] would fall so the ground is prepared
[27:33] ground prepared ahead of time it was
[27:35] prepared for the seed ever got
[27:37] there it wasn't prepared after the seed
[27:40] got there so if you're farming and in
[27:42] the analogy and you prepare a field amen
[27:44] you select the field that you want Amen
[27:46] to sew the seed in and in that field you
[27:49] clear away the stones and then you break
[27:51] up the stumps and you cut down the trees
[27:52] you do whatever you're going to do to
[27:54] prepare this field for seed and then you
[27:56] disc it and till it and you do whatever
[27:58] you're going to do before you sew the
[28:00] seed in it amen so whatever plot was
[28:02] carved out of the Wilderness was by the
[28:05] choice of the
[28:09] farmer it was his choice and he prepared
[28:12] it he predestinated it before the seed
[28:14] ever got there amen so it's not the
[28:17] ground preparing itself to receive the
[28:19] seed amen it was already prepared Amen
[28:22] to receive this seed all right so the
[28:26] seed goes everywhere so that you know
[28:29] the scriptures can be used in many many
[28:30] ways and each Parable and each each
[28:33] story can be used and many times we use
[28:35] this Parable Amen to to try to to
[28:38] encourage people don't let the cares of
[28:40] Life choke you out amen don't be a
[28:42] shallow believer and don't be all that
[28:44] but that's not really the depth of the
[28:46] meaning of this amen it can be used that
[28:49] way and certainly it's not wrong all
[28:50] those things remain true but that ground
[28:53] didn't prepare itself that ground was
[28:55] already prepared this is different
[28:57] categories of people this is this is a
[29:00] predestinated people that's prepared by
[29:02] God to receive this seed and this seed
[29:05] won't grow in this ground or that ground
[29:07] or this ground this seed will only grow
[29:09] in the prepared ground the predestinated
[29:12] ground and when that seed will go in
[29:14] there the acidic is just right the
[29:16] mineral content is just right it's got
[29:18] everything it needs for that seed to to
[29:21] to rot to to uh root to grow amen and
[29:25] bear fruit
[29:28] he says in the parable in verse
[29:30] 20 it
[29:32] said and these are they which are sown
[29:35] on good ground such as hear the word and
[29:38] receive it and bring forth fruit so what
[29:41] is the good ground the good ground let's
[29:45] look again the good ground hears the
[29:48] word and receives it and brings forth
[29:53] fruit how do you know where the good
[29:55] ground is it's not just the one that
[29:56] says uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
[29:58] that's not the good ground amen the good
[30:00] ground is the one that hear the word
[30:02] receive the word and bring forth fruit
[30:05] that's the right kind of predestinated
[30:07] ground right so now the seed is the
[30:11] children of the Kingdom but when we come
[30:13] down here the children of the kingdom is
[30:15] also the good
[30:19] ground that this seed is going to be swn
[30:24] into so we're talking about two seed
[30:27] seeds amen one is one is the children of
[30:29] God one is the word of God one is the
[30:31] good ground one is the seed but every
[30:34] seed has to have its ground and every
[30:36] ground has to be prepared for the seed
[30:38] and these two things have to come
[30:39] together to bring forth
[30:41] fruit amen you can't just have a seed
[30:44] laying there that seed's got to go into
[30:46] the ground amen so you can't just have
[30:48] seed without ground you can't have
[30:50] ground without seed but when you have
[30:51] seed that goes into the right kind of
[30:53] ground then what do you have you have
[30:55] fruit that life that's in that seed
[30:56] comes forth and manifest and brings
[30:58] forth
[30:59] fruit amen let's go to Acts chapter
[31:07] 13 Acts Chapter
[31:11] 13 Verse
[31:22] 46 acts 13 and: 46 then Paul and
[31:26] Barnabas waxed bold and said it was
[31:28] necessary that the word of God should
[31:30] first have been spoken to you but seeing
[31:32] you put it from you and judge yourselves
[31:34] Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn
[31:36] to the Gentiles for so hath the Lord
[31:39] commanded us saying I have set thee to
[31:40] be a light of the Gentiles that thou
[31:42] should us be for salvation into the ends
[31:44] of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard
[31:46] this they were glad and glorified the
[31:48] word of the Lord and as many as were
[31:50] ordained to eternal life
[31:52] believed amen they were the good ground
[31:55] amen they were the seed that had been
[31:57] sown amen by the son of man into the
[32:00] Earth amen and they could receive they
[32:02] were the good ground that was PR
[32:04] prepared ordained to receive the seed
[32:06] that Paul and Barnabas came sewing the
[32:09] Jews couldn't receive it amen because
[32:11] the prophecy over Paul was that he would
[32:13] be a light unto the Gentiles and light
[32:15] to the end for salvation to the end of
[32:16] the world but he first had to come to
[32:18] the the Jews the Jews had to reject it
[32:21] what the seed that he had wasn't for
[32:23] them right then amen so they rejected it
[32:25] but there was a prepared soil amen and
[32:27] and listen uh uh Paul did not have to
[32:30] make the soil prepared the soil was
[32:33] already prepared all Paul had to do was
[32:35] seow the seed and he sowed the seed and
[32:38] some rejected it wrong soil some
[32:41] received it right
[32:44] soil amen for for us I mean we sew the
[32:48] seed all the time and sometimes it looks
[32:50] like it's falling into good ground like
[32:52] this is good ground it'll surely take
[32:55] amen but we don't know the the the
[32:57] content of that soil we don't know the
[32:59] makeup of that soil and that that seed
[33:01] goes right in there and can never come
[33:02] to life and we're sure that they'll take
[33:04] it we're sure that they'll believe it I
[33:06] mean they already look like a Believer
[33:07] they already act like one I'll give them
[33:09] the word and they'll take it and nothing
[33:11] happens then we look at a plot of land
[33:13] and it looks overgrown it doesn't look
[33:15] like nothing's going to grow here amen
[33:16] and you sew the seed and lo and behold
[33:18] we're surprised they actually believe it
[33:21] amen like I told them and they didn't
[33:23] stumble I said something about serpent
[33:25] SE and they said I could see that
[33:30] that soil was prepared soil Paul didn't
[33:33] have to prepare the
[33:34] soil we we are not here to to preach a
[33:38] Reformation to till up ground and make
[33:39] it good-look soil so we could sew the
[33:41] seed we're just here to sew the message
[33:43] of the hour the true Revelation the word
[33:45] of God for this day and there's already
[33:48] a prepared soil that'll meet
[33:51] this it'll find its place amen it'll go
[33:55] to the right place we don't have to to
[33:57] worry about it we don't have to strain
[33:58] we don't we don't have to get upset and
[34:00] listen when when the SE SE the seed so
[34:02] went out to se seed a mean there was a
[34:04] lot of it that that looked like it took
[34:06] you know it took and it sprang up but
[34:08] before it could ever come to fruit it
[34:10] withered
[34:12] away you know we've seen that you've
[34:16] seen that it can be discouraging but
[34:19] don't worry it's not your
[34:21] fault you know the seed swer is never
[34:24] criticized in this Parable he's not told
[34:26] that he's loud and he's no good and he's
[34:28] spilling seed everywhere he's never
[34:29] criticized the problem wasn't with the
[34:31] seed sore the problem was with the
[34:33] soil with the
[34:35] ground so for us we don't need to worry
[34:37] about it God's got prepared soil out
[34:40] there we've got a bag full of seed and
[34:43] there's prepared soil
[34:45] somewhere that's not my responsibility
[34:48] I'm not responsible for making the soil
[34:51] right and prepared I'm only responsible
[34:53] for
[34:54] sharing amen praise God now brother R
[35:00] says and the God who is rich in Mercy
[35:02] from
[35:03] 1965 says many of you can fellowship
[35:06] with me on this thought when you was a
[35:09] little boy or a little girl you would
[35:10] walk around and there would be certain
[35:12] things that would just where it wouldn't
[35:14] bother the other kids it seemed like
[35:16] there was something in you that cried
[35:18] out there was a god somewhere yet you
[35:21] were a sinner you remember that
[35:23] certainly now what was that that was
[35:25] that little form of life in you then
[35:28] what was that that seed that the son of
[35:30] man swed into the field it was that form
[35:33] of life in you then brother vom calls it
[35:35] a form of life he calls it a seed calls
[35:38] it a gene he calls it an attribute he
[35:40] calls it part of the
[35:41] word and it was in you all
[35:45] along he said then after a while you
[35:47] heard the gospel maybe you went to
[35:50] church you picked out this and that and
[35:51] went from denomination to denomination
[35:53] but one day you being part of God you
[35:56] had to to be part of the word so you are
[35:59] part of God you come from God within you
[36:01] is a part of God an attribute or a gene
[36:03] or part of the word a seed all that's in
[36:06] you is part of God so if you're part of
[36:08] God you have to be part of the
[36:12] word so let's read this again one day
[36:15] you being part of God you had to be part
[36:17] of the word and when you heard the word
[36:19] you know where you come from you know
[36:21] that was the truth you were always the
[36:23] seed was in you always the word listen
[36:27] now the word seen the word that was in
[36:29] you that was before the foundation of
[36:32] the world saw the word and you came to
[36:34] it now let's look at that the word seen
[36:36] the word which word saw what word amen
[36:40] there was a word in here and there was a
[36:42] word for the age amen and and one saw
[36:45] the other and one saw this and this one
[36:47] saw that what however they saw what saw
[36:49] what I don't know but they came together
[36:51] they were magnetized to one another the
[36:53] word seen the word that was in you that
[36:56] was before the the foundation World saw
[36:57] the word and you come to it why cuz you
[37:01] was prepared ground let's go to John
[37:04] chapter
[37:10] 6 John chapter
[37:13] 6 verse
[37:24] 63 Jesus speaks here says it is the
[37:26] spirit that quickeneth the flesh
[37:28] profiteth nothing the words that I speak
[37:30] unto you they are spirit and they are
[37:33] life so the word itself is Spirit the
[37:36] word itself is life so down in you was a
[37:39] little form of life what was that part
[37:42] of the
[37:43] word the the message of the hour has
[37:46] what in it life it's part of the word so
[37:49] there's a life that's going to connect
[37:51] with a life there's Spirit that's going
[37:54] to connect with the spirit because the
[37:55] word I speak to you is Spirit the the
[37:57] spirit and the spirit is going to come
[37:58] together the life and the life is going
[37:59] to come together the word and the word
[38:01] is going to come
[38:02] together amen I want to I want to go to
[38:07] a new sheet here but there's several
[38:09] quotes that I just pulled little phrases
[38:11] out because I want to uh write some
[38:13] things down here on the board I want to
[38:14] look at these things
[38:16] together in the fourth seal brother bam
[38:18] said the word itself is spirit it's
[38:21] spirit in word
[38:23] form
[38:25] so
[38:28] the
[38:32] spirit and the word are the same thing
[38:35] amen the word itself is spirit it's
[38:39] spirit in word
[38:42] form then in the message perseverance
[38:44] from 63 says God and the word is the
[38:46] same this is God on print and he's
[38:49] holding his
[38:51] Bible so
[38:55] God equal to the
[39:00] word in trying to do God a service from
[39:02] 1965 he says Christ is the
[39:05] word
[39:10] so
[39:12] Christ is the word
[39:15] am says in Christ is the mystery of God
[39:17] revealed he said the Bible is Christ he
[39:20] is the
[39:21] word but brother Bram just said that
[39:24] this is God in print form
[39:27] but then he said the Bible is Christ so
[39:31] is the Bible God or is the Bible
[39:35] Christ I love
[39:37] it it's so simple now let's go let's go
[39:42] uh before we go any further let's go to
[39:44] F uh first John turn with me all the way
[39:46] back to the end of the New Testament and
[39:48] go with me to First John chapter
[39:55] 5
[40:01] so 1 John chapter
[40:06] 5 1 John 5 and verse
[40:09] 7 for there are three that bear record
[40:12] in heaven the Father the word and the
[40:14] Holy Ghost and these three are
[40:17] one all right so we know that these
[40:23] three are
[40:25] one all right it doesn't say the father
[40:28] and the Son and the Holy Spirit it's the
[40:30] father and the word and the Holy Spirit
[40:32] and these are one and brother Brenham
[40:33] says the the spirit is the word he says
[40:37] God is the word Christ is the word God
[40:40] is the Bible Christ is the Bible praise
[40:43] God now let's go to the next quote now
[40:46] in Christ is the mystery of God he says
[40:48] how did he what happened in the
[40:49] prefigure now he opened Adam's side and
[40:52] took part of his flesh which was Adam to
[40:54] make Eve the bride has to be the word
[40:57] for he is the word so where did the
[40:59] Bride come from she came out of Christ
[41:02] so out of Christ comes the
[41:07] bride so she is part of Christ and she
[41:10] is part of Christ then she has to be
[41:13] part of the
[41:15] word because Christ is the word so out
[41:18] of Christ amen remember he said he smot
[41:21] him under the rib on Calvary and took
[41:24] out of him the elements just like he he
[41:25] took one of the ribs of Adam and he made
[41:27] the woman and he took the elements the
[41:29] water and the blood and he made his
[41:31] church he made his bride and she is and
[41:33] she is uh uh she is flesh and bone of
[41:36] Jesus Christ according to the scriptures
[41:38] so she is part of Christ and being part
[41:41] of Christ Christ is the word she's also
[41:43] part of the
[41:45] word praise be to
[41:47] God now let's look at this next
[41:50] one now you see the seals when he was in
[41:54] his mediator work back there redeeming
[41:56] but someday he comes forth to get this
[41:58] book that he's redeemed and all that's
[42:00] in the book would be him for that's the
[42:03] believer the words in the book and the
[42:05] word is him so in this book of
[42:08] redemption in this title deed the book
[42:10] of redemption The Book of Life the Bible
[42:13] the the the record of Christ whatever
[42:14] you want to call this book amen he says
[42:17] the book is him which is Christ but what
[42:19] is the Believers the words in the book
[42:21] so that means the bride is part of that
[42:23] book and that book is Christ amen
[42:26] she's part of the
[42:29] book praise God let's keep
[42:33] going in the in the message it is the
[42:35] rising of the sun he says why he's an
[42:38] eagle an eagle to an eagle the word
[42:41] before the foundation the word to the
[42:45] word the word predestinated to the word
[42:48] written for the hour you realize your
[42:50] position he hunts for it he's talking
[42:52] about the parable of the mama Eagle
[42:54] hunting out her baby the Eagle's hunting
[42:57] out that lost eagle and that Eagle's
[42:59] down in the chicken yard thinking it's a
[43:01] chicken hatched out under a hen doesn't
[43:03] have its identification doesn't know who
[43:05] it is properly until the eagle flies
[43:07] over and when the eagle flies over amen
[43:10] and lets out a scream whatever's inside
[43:12] of that eagle identifies with that
[43:14] scream and recognizes and there's a
[43:17] resonation on the inside and then
[43:20] realizes it's an eagle because it looks
[43:21] up sees an eagle and goes to fly and
[43:23] then brother BM takes that story says
[43:25] it's an e Eagle to an eagle amen the
[43:28] word before the foundation the word to
[43:30] the word the word predestinated amen
[43:33] that's the seed that was swn into the
[43:35] field the word predestinated to the
[43:37] written word for the hour that's the
[43:39] word to Seer
[43:41] sewing the word comes to the word the
[43:44] word of the the seed of the word comes
[43:46] to that seed that was planted by the son
[43:48] of man before the foundation of the word
[43:50] and that's good ground and then when the
[43:52] word comes to the word then it manifests
[43:54] the life inside that seat seed and
[43:56] brings forth fruit some 60 some 30 some
[43:59] 60 some
[44:01] 100-fold evidence that it's good
[44:04] ground so let me go
[44:08] here so when we look
[44:10] at a son or
[44:14] daughter of
[44:17] God we know that they are the
[44:20] word they are part of the word they come
[44:23] out of God which is the word they are
[44:24] part of Christ which is the the word
[44:26] they are they are the
[44:28] word and then we know that the
[44:34] scriptures is the
[44:37] word so now we know that the word comes
[44:40] to the word so now the scripture comes
[44:46] to the predestinated
[44:47] word what is
[44:51] this the
[44:54] word for
[44:56] this
[44:59] season
[45:01] comes to
[45:03] the
[45:07] predestinated
[45:09] word so the word comes to the word and
[45:13] the word comes to the
[45:18] word they are magnetized for one another
[45:21] they are predestinated to go together
[45:23] the seed that was planted he knew what
[45:25] bed and ground you would come forth and
[45:27] he knew he knew what ground he would
[45:29] prepare for the last day for the very
[45:32] last uh the last of the Gentile
[45:34] dispensation the wrapping up of all time
[45:36] and he knew what word to bring forth and
[45:38] he knew where to sew this word because
[45:39] he doesn't bring forth his word in
[45:41] season and have no place to plant that
[45:43] word he doesn't just let it float around
[45:46] amen realize he's got to have a ground
[45:48] already prepared to receive that word or
[45:51] else he doesn't bring the word on the
[45:54] scene right brother bam taught us that
[45:57] that that every farmer knows when to
[46:00] plant seed he said you don't plant corn
[46:02] amen the same time you plant beans you
[46:04] don't plant beans the same time you
[46:05] plant wheat you have to know your
[46:07] seasons and know when to bring the seed
[46:09] out of the seed bag and cast it on the
[46:11] ground you got to have it in the right
[46:12] season and God's not here he's not
[46:15] bringing Lutheran seed and casting it
[46:17] out in the wrong season because it won't
[46:19] grow right but he's got the right word
[46:21] for the right season he's got a ground
[46:23] prepared and everything is just right
[46:25] and so he bring the seed forth cuz he's
[46:27] already got a ground that'll receive it
[46:29] when God starts breaking the word and
[46:31] breaking the word it's evidence he's
[46:33] already got ground here that that seed
[46:36] was predestinated to land in to do what
[46:39] not to say I got the seed I got the seed
[46:41] no it's supposed to land in good ground
[46:43] to bring forth fruit that's inside the
[46:47] seed you say I got the seed I got the
[46:50] seed that's no more than the guy who's
[46:52] casting out the bag of seed saying I got
[46:54] the seed I got the seed but but it's got
[46:56] to go into the ground it's got to come
[46:58] forth It's got to grow through the
[47:00] process of growth and it's got to bear
[47:02] fruit which is the life of the
[47:05] seed praise
[47:07] God
[47:09] Amen woo I like
[47:16] it I know for most of us this is review
[47:19] but I love the review amen I love the
[47:23] reality so now we come here and we see
[47:26] the
[47:27] word the word is
[47:30] Christ or Christ is the
[47:34] word but we
[47:36] know that the word is also
[47:40] God
[47:42] Amen right and we know that the word is
[47:47] also
[47:50] Spirit
[47:52] right so
[47:54] God if I could write this down
[47:58] here is the
[48:00] originator of the
[48:02] word the word came from God the Word was
[48:05] God the word is
[48:07] God it never lost its God property but
[48:10] it came out of God it's the mind of God
[48:13] on display he's the originator of the
[48:15] word the spirit brother B says is the
[48:19] life of the
[48:21] word and he also
[48:24] says that's the life of the word and
[48:31] lifegiver to the word
[48:34] am and
[48:37] Christ is the Living
[48:40] Word the anointed word for your day it's
[48:43] the word that's living present tense
[48:45] Christ has always been the present tense
[48:48] Living Word not was not will be it was
[48:51] Christ in Noah yes it was Christ in
[48:53] Jeremiah but that's not Christ now
[48:56] that's where Christ was Christ is always
[48:58] present tense the anointed word The
[49:00] Living Word so God is the originator of
[49:02] the word he's still the word the word is
[49:04] still him amen uh the spirit is the life
[49:07] of the word or the lifegiver to the word
[49:09] and Christ is the Living
[49:11] Word so what is the bride today the
[49:14] bride today is supposed to be the
[49:16] manifested Living Word she's a part of
[49:18] Christ Christ is being displayed in her
[49:20] form he's manifesting himself amen she
[49:23] is part of the word
[49:26] praise God not going to go any further
[49:28] with that now I want to get into the
[49:29] next part this is this is what I really
[49:32] get excited about in The patmas Vision
[49:35] in 1960 he says man is omnipotent you
[49:39] don't believe that but he is a man fully
[49:41] surrendered to God is omnipotent did he
[49:44] not say in Mark 11:12 whatsoever things
[49:46] you say and don't doubt in your heart
[49:48] it'll come to pass you can have what
[49:50] youve said what happens when two
[49:53] omnipotents meet when God and man comes
[49:57] together through omnipotence something's
[49:59] got to shake whatsoever you'd say with
[50:02] that creative power of omnipotence of
[50:04] God knowing that he's promised it and he
[50:06] said it in his word it creates a power
[50:09] that goes out yonder and brings things
[50:10] to pass things that is not it makes them
[50:13] as though they are because two
[50:15] omnipotents have
[50:17] met what what two omnipotence have met
[50:20] amen the seed the word the the the the
[50:24] life of God in inside a child of God
[50:27] with the the the word for this age when
[50:30] those two come together amen there's
[50:32] Faith to believe it it falls in good
[50:33] ground what is that that's two
[50:35] omnipotence coming together and when two
[50:38] omnipotence coming together you can't
[50:40] stop the word from
[50:42] manifesting amen why because it's God in
[50:45] God it's Christ in Christ it's the word
[50:47] in the
[50:49] word do you understand God did it before
[50:52] the foundation of the world he's the son
[50:54] of man that sowed seed into his field he
[50:56] prepared the ground ahead of time he
[50:58] brought the right SE right the right
[51:00] seed in the right season and brought
[51:02] forth the right soil at the right time
[51:04] and he made sure the two got together he
[51:07] sent a seed sewer your way one day amen
[51:10] and that seed sewer may have tossed seed
[51:12] Here There and Everywhere amen but he
[51:14] happened to get some over in your field
[51:16] and when it come into your field amen
[51:18] two omnipotence come together and your
[51:21] life
[51:22] changed what religion couldn't do for
[51:24] you before what did nomination couldn't
[51:26] do for you before when this
[51:28] predestinated seed of the hour the
[51:30] anointed word for the hour hit the good
[51:32] ground of the predestinated seed in your
[51:35] soul the two come together two
[51:37] omnipotence met and your life changed
[51:39] you quit talking the way you talked you
[51:41] quit walking the way you walk you quit
[51:43] thinking the way you
[51:46] thought that wasn't you cleaning up your
[51:48] life that was the seed coming to its
[51:51] resting
[51:52] place that was the word coming to the
[51:54] word the word predestinated and the word
[51:57] for this age came
[52:00] together it's worked in every age and it
[52:02] works in this age it's the power that's
[52:05] being released in our lives it's not us
[52:07] working our way into something it's not
[52:09] our us pushing or proding or pulling or
[52:12] it's not us trying to create something
[52:15] by by Strife or by effort or by whatever
[52:18] amen that's all human that's not going
[52:20] to work amen but it's just a yielding
[52:23] ourselves it's just a surrender what God
[52:25] already
[52:27] ordained God has already placed it in
[52:29] you and he's already brought it forth in
[52:31] this age and you didn't have anything to
[52:34] do with that seed getting in your soul
[52:36] and you didn't have anything to do with
[52:37] the word coming forth in this
[52:39] age so what do you think that you're
[52:42] going to do now to make it do something
[52:44] amen it's not your effort all you can do
[52:47] is say beat unto me according to Thy
[52:49] word all you can do is surrender to it
[52:51] and let those two omnipotents come
[52:53] together amen listen it's beyond you
[52:56] it's beyond your thinking it's beyond
[52:58] your efforts it's beyond your desire
[53:00] it's beyond anything that's in you as a
[53:02] human being it's so much deeper than
[53:04] your human realm it's the part that was
[53:06] intended to be you from the beginning
[53:08] it's the thought of God that's coming
[53:10] into manifestation in this season it's
[53:12] not you it's him in
[53:16] you so now all human efforts is just
[53:20] it's just a failure to begin
[53:24] with oh my so we don't try brother oh my
[53:28] I hope you know me better than that by
[53:30] now amen we should give our whole heart
[53:31] to it we should give our whole life to
[53:33] it we should give us surrender we should
[53:34] give all obedience but we're never going
[53:36] to make anything happen amen just by our
[53:38] own will and by Our Own Strength amen
[53:40] it's got to be something he has ordained
[53:42] before the foundation of the world and
[53:44] when he brings those two pieces together
[53:46] and then all of a sudden click it
[53:48] unlocks a
[53:53] power we know that there's a life in
[53:56] this
[53:57] word that's right the word has life it's
[54:01] a gerz word it already has life in it is
[54:05] that true
[54:07] yeah when the seed sewer went forth all
[54:10] the seed in his bag already had life in
[54:13] it it was gerti seed good seed it all
[54:17] had life in it but it didn't all come to
[54:24] life it only came to life in the good
[54:28] ground this message is good
[54:31] seed it's good seed it has life in it it
[54:34] has eternal life in it it is Christ this
[54:37] message is Christ it is the Original
[54:39] Seed this message has life in it it is
[54:42] life it is the lifegiver amen but you
[54:45] can cast it all over the place and no
[54:47] matter how much life it has it'll never
[54:49] spring forth to life and manifest until
[54:51] it falls in good ground too omnipotent
[54:55] Ence have to come together two parts of
[54:57] God have to be linked together that's
[54:59] the way God set this thing up in the
[55:01] beginning that's the way it always works
[55:03] he showed it all the way in the Garden
[55:05] of Eden because Adam could never
[55:07] reproduce himself without a bride he was
[55:09] going to take two parts of Adam and two
[55:11] parts of Adam uniting back together is
[55:14] going to produce life amen so two parts
[55:17] of God two parts of the word coming back
[55:20] together is going to manifest life amen
[55:23] you can't force feed you can't make
[55:25] somebody a Believer you can't do
[55:27] anything amen and neither can you say oh
[55:29] if I polish the seed and I get it listen
[55:32] The seed's Good Seed it doesn't need you
[55:34] to do anything to it you don't have to
[55:36] polish it up you don't have to soften it
[55:38] up you don't have to do any the seed is
[55:40] perfectly good and has perfect life in
[55:42] it and it doesn't matter you can preach
[55:44] it and preach it and preach it and
[55:45] preach it and see no manifestation
[55:47] there's nothing wrong with the
[55:50] message nothing wrong with the word the
[55:53] life is still in the word the problem in
[55:55] the soil amen because as soon as that
[55:57] seed hits the right soil it Springs to
[56:01] life you can't manufacture it you can't
[56:04] manipulate
[56:05] it nothing you do will work nothing of
[56:09] your human effort will
[56:14] work praise
[56:17] God brother B said in the message on the
[56:19] wings of a snow white dove in
[56:21] 1965 said like the Chinese Laundry
[56:25] used to do the here he would
[56:27] write he couldn't write English so he
[56:29] wrote on there and tore a piece of paper
[56:31] and handed you
[56:33] apart and you remember the Chinese
[56:35] laundries when they used to do that
[56:37] their two ends had to
[56:39] compare to get your clothes you couldn't
[56:41] fool him cuz he had the other end of it
[56:43] you might recopy your name but you can't
[56:45] ret that paper so it had to be the same
[56:49] piece of
[56:53] paper listen brother Bam's parables are
[56:56] so
[56:57] simple and he speaks in Parables that so
[57:00] that seeing they won't see and hearing
[57:02] they won't hear but blessed are your
[57:04] eyes for they see and they
[57:07] hear you go to the and
[57:10] takes a piece of paper he takes that
[57:11] piece of paper and he tears it a certain
[57:13] way he gives you one copy and he keeps
[57:15] one copy then he washes your clothes and
[57:18] for you to come back and to redeem your
[57:19] clothes for
[57:21] Redemption you have to have the half
[57:24] that matches his
[57:28] half and you
[57:30] can't you can't get another piece of
[57:35] paper it has to be the same piece of
[57:38] paper it's got to be the original yeah
[57:43] right that's he goes on to say so that's
[57:45] the way they done it in the Oriental
[57:47] days or long ago in eastern days they'd
[57:49] kill an animal stand between it tear the
[57:51] pieces of goat skin apart one took one
[57:54] and when the Covenant was confirmed they
[57:55] brought the pieces together and they had
[57:57] to dovetail just
[57:58] exactly now what God is showing him here
[58:01] is this on these sacrifices is speaking
[58:03] of Christ that how God took Jesus to
[58:06] Calvary and tore him apart and received
[58:07] the body up into heaven and sent the
[58:09] spirit down to us that same Spirit was
[58:12] on him as to be on you to dovetail with
[58:14] the body to be the bride at the end time
[58:16] see that's right don't be a denomination
[58:19] now it'll be the word what he was but
[58:23] like the word has to come to word like
[58:25] cell to human cell cuz your body's being
[58:28] built it isn't one cell of a human next
[58:29] of a dog next of a pig no it's all human
[58:32] cell that's the way the body of Christ
[58:34] is all word of God word coming to word
[58:38] and then word building upon word and so
[58:41] now amen he he he tore Jesus Christ amen
[58:44] at Calvary and now he sent down his
[58:46] spirit amen but the the spirit amen is
[58:49] in the word is that what he said the
[58:51] spirit is in the word and the spirit is
[58:54] lifegiver to the word and it's the life
[58:55] of the word and now he's come down here
[58:58] and we're we are carrying around one
[59:01] half of this
[59:04] ticket we didn't know it we had no idea
[59:07] we didn't know we were
[59:09] redeemable we didn't know anything amen
[59:12] oh we're carrying around one half of
[59:13] this ticket amen but there's a matching
[59:16] piece to this ticket amen and nothing
[59:18] else will substitute and you can't
[59:20] change it out you can't exchange it you
[59:22] can't get a new one you can't recreate
[59:24] it it's already there it has to be an
[59:26] original tore off piece tore off of the
[59:31] original we're walking around with a
[59:34] tore off
[59:36] piece and one day we had to come in
[59:40] contact with
[59:41] Christ is that right and Christ is the
[59:45] anointed
[59:47] word that's why brother said this
[59:49] message is Christ it's the word for
[59:52] today it's the anointed word of the hour
[59:54] it's the message of the hour and when
[59:56] you came in contact with the message of
[59:59] the hour all of the sudden they
[1:00:02] dovetailed what was in you and this
[1:00:06] message clicked bang and that's
[1:00:10] Redemption amen that is our Redemption
[1:00:13] that's what redeemed us that's what
[1:00:14] pulled us out of the myy clay that's
[1:00:16] what opened our eyes amen that's what
[1:00:18] you reunited us with God Amen that's
[1:00:20] what saved us all of these things
[1:00:22] happened why because I was walking
[1:00:23] around with a tick and I didn't know I
[1:00:26] didn't know I had half a golden ticket
[1:00:28] in
[1:00:29] me amen amen I had a ticket to Heaven I
[1:00:33] had a ticket to Redemption I had a
[1:00:34] ticket to everything Adam lost I had
[1:00:36] half of a ticket inside of me I had a
[1:00:38] ticket to Christ and a ticket to heaven
[1:00:40] and a ticket to eternal life but I
[1:00:42] didn't have all of it myself I couldn't
[1:00:44] get there on my own I had to come in
[1:00:46] contact with somebody who was the other
[1:00:48] ticket holder amen and these two tickets
[1:00:50] come together and when the tickets come
[1:00:52] together I had the admission slip to
[1:00:55] heaven and eternal life and Redemption
[1:00:57] back to God and everything that I had
[1:00:59] lost and the fall it all came back amen
[1:01:01] and what was the other half of the
[1:01:03] ticket it was Christ himself the word
[1:01:06] alive today that was the other half of
[1:01:08] that
[1:01:11] ticket praise
[1:01:13] God when two omnipotents
[1:01:16] meet then the power of the word is
[1:01:21] Unleashed brother BM says I've got this
[1:01:24] quot qu here from 1965 where he says by
[1:01:27] one spirit Spirit of God which is the
[1:01:30] lifegiver to the word the seed to
[1:01:32] vindicate that seed for That season he
[1:01:36] is the
[1:01:38] lifegiver I'd like for you to turn with
[1:01:40] me to Luke Chapter or yeah no let's go
[1:01:43] to Isaiah first let's go to Isaiah
[1:01:45] chapter
[1:01:53] 7
[1:02:00] Isaiah
[1:02:09] 7:14 Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord
[1:02:12] himself shall give you a sign Behold a
[1:02:15] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[1:02:18] shall call his name
[1:02:22] Emmanuel let's go over to Luke chapter
[1:02:26] 1 The Book of
[1:02:30] Luke let's go to chapter
[1:02:40] one in Luke chapter 1 let's go to verse
[1:02:46] 28 let's go to verse 26 verse 26 and in
[1:02:50] the sixth month the angel Gabriel was
[1:02:52] sent from God into a city of Galilee
[1:02:54] named Nazareth to a virgin a spoused to
[1:02:56] a man whose name was Joseph of the House
[1:02:58] of David and the virgin's name was Mary
[1:03:01] and the angel came in into her and said
[1:03:03] hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is
[1:03:05] with thee blessed art thou among
[1:03:09] women when we read Isaiah 7 when Isaiah
[1:03:13] gave this prophecy I think it was about
[1:03:15] 700 years or something like that before
[1:03:18] we we see in the the the the events that
[1:03:20] are transpiring in Luke that seed went
[1:03:23] for it was written down it was put in a
[1:03:26] scroll it was read for hundreds of years
[1:03:28] by priests and it was read by other
[1:03:30] Scholars and scribes amen and that word
[1:03:34] had life in
[1:03:37] it that word was full of life it had
[1:03:41] life in it it was a gerti seed but
[1:03:45] brother Brenham said that that that word
[1:03:48] that was spoken by Isaiah was going
[1:03:50] around and around the earth for 700
[1:03:52] years it was in motion and what was it
[1:03:55] doing it was waiting for good
[1:03:58] ground it was waiting for a resting
[1:04:00] place it was waiting for the
[1:04:01] predestinated place for it to land it
[1:04:04] had it was alive it was Living Word it
[1:04:07] had life in it it had the power in it of
[1:04:09] transformation it had the power within
[1:04:11] it to bring itself to pass it had
[1:04:14] everything it needed there was only one
[1:04:16] thing it was lacking it had to have good
[1:04:18] ground to fall in so that that word
[1:04:20] could bring forth the life that was in
[1:04:22] the
[1:04:22] word and verse 700 years it's moving
[1:04:25] around the earth and around the earth
[1:04:27] waiting for what waiting for the
[1:04:29] predestinated plan of God we think oh
[1:04:31] what a shame that word doesn't have a
[1:04:33] landing place there's nobody good enough
[1:04:35] nobody's worked themselves into that
[1:04:37] position nobody's uh remained a virgin
[1:04:39] nobody is a holy enough has nothing to
[1:04:42] do with any human effort God knew
[1:04:45] exactly amen before the foundation of
[1:04:47] the world what day that little virgin
[1:04:49] would be there and when she would be
[1:04:50] going to the well and he knew exactly
[1:04:52] what Gabriel would say to her on that
[1:04:55] day because she was good ground amen and
[1:04:58] that that that prophecy is moving around
[1:05:00] and around amen and he says to her hell
[1:05:03] there highly favored of the lord well
[1:05:05] she had no
[1:05:07] idea and he begins to express to her
[1:05:10] what her role is in
[1:05:13] Redemption begins to tell her her place
[1:05:16] in the scriptures and what scriptures
[1:05:17] she's supposed to be manifesting at that
[1:05:20] day and she
[1:05:22] listen she's the PRI destinated ground
[1:05:26] to bring forth this
[1:05:31] seed this seed is the prophecy of God
[1:05:35] that has life in it amen and it's got
[1:05:38] the it's got the ability to produce
[1:05:41] itself right okay we we
[1:05:45] agree she is the predestinated Virgin
[1:05:49] that was spoke of in Isaiah amen when
[1:05:52] God said when Isaiah said a virgin shall
[1:05:55] conceive God already knew it was Mary
[1:05:59] amen but guess what she could do nothing
[1:06:02] on her
[1:06:04] own she couldn't produce the prophecy
[1:06:07] she couldn't produce Emanuel she
[1:06:09] couldn't do anything and guess what the
[1:06:12] seed of the word the prophecy couldn't
[1:06:13] do anything on its
[1:06:17] own but there had to be two parts that
[1:06:20] come together amen and when the two
[1:06:22] things come together bam two omnipotence
[1:06:25] come together two parts of the word come
[1:06:28] together two parts of God connected amen
[1:06:30] from the mind of God now in manifested
[1:06:33] Earth and all of a sudden when what what
[1:06:35] when these when these two parts came
[1:06:37] together when she received the word for
[1:06:40] her Day from a messenger that messenger

[1:06:45] time and you're the one she said be it
[1:06:47] unto me according to Thy word and when
[1:06:49] she surrendered to that word that word
[1:06:52] fell in good ground amen and she asked
[1:06:54] how will these things be seeing I know
[1:06:56] no man and he says the Holy Ghost shall
[1:06:59] overshadow you why cuz the Holy Ghost is
[1:07:01] lifegiver to the seed

[1:11:55] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[1:11:58] Water by the word that he might present
[1:12:00] it to himself a glorious church not
[1:12:03] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[1:12:07] but that it should be holy and without
[1:12:11] blemish that prophecy has been
[1:12:16] circling

[1:12:23] of the Water by the word and that he is

[1:12:56] when is he going to present himself a
[1:12:59] spotless bride he's going to present
[1:13:00] himself a spotless bride when this water
[1:13:03] is doing the washing and we're living in
[1:13:05] this day
[1:13:08] amen amen let's look back at chapter
[1:13:11] 4 in verse 12 chapter 4 one chapter
[1:13:16] previous chapter 4:12 for the Perfection
[1:13:19] of the Saints for the work of the
[1:13:20] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[1:13:22] Christ till we all come in the unity of
[1:13:24] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[1:13:26] Son of God unto a perfect man unto the
[1:13:29] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:13:31] of Christ there is a prophecy laying
[1:13:33] here that God has sent gifts and those
[1:13:36] gifts are to preach a word and that word
[1:13:38] is to work through those gifts amen
[1:13:40] until it brings a church into Perfection
[1:13:42] into the stature of the fullness of
[1:13:43] Christ amen and that is taking place
[1:13:46] this
[1:13:47] day that day is this day that prophecy's
[1:13:49] been rolling around and around and
[1:13:51] around but now the fullness of the word
[1:13:53] has come to bring this prophecy to pass
[1:13:56] and it's taking place all around us day
[1:13:58] by day what's he doing he's bringing us
[1:14:01] into the full stature of Christ until
[1:14:04] she be so much like him she will be
[1:14:09] him that's the fullness of the stature
[1:14:11] of Christ that's what's taking place
[1:14:14] today let's go to Revelation
[1:14:22] 19
[1:14:23] Revelation
[1:14:32] 19 Revelation 19
[1:14:37] and7 let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:14:40] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:14:41] Lamb is come and his wife ha made
[1:14:43] herself ready and to her was granted
[1:14:46] that she should be array in fine linen
[1:14:48] clean and white for the fine linen is
[1:14:50] the righteousness of the
[1:14:52] saints that prophecy has found a landing
[1:14:58] place there is a bride that is clothed
[1:15:01] in the white linens of the word she is
[1:15:05] being dressed in the word the prophet
[1:15:07] was here to bring the wedding garment
[1:15:10] and bring it to us Amen to clothe a
[1:15:12] bride for Christ and as we yield to that
[1:15:15] word we're putting the wedding garment
[1:15:16] on Amen and she's being prepared and the
[1:15:19] and the marriage of the L lamb has come
[1:15:21] the marriage is taking place now
[1:15:25] amen I'm not pointing to a
[1:15:28] prophecy there's a prophecy living in me
[1:15:31] not pointing to a word there's a word
[1:15:33] living in me and just as Mary she came
[1:15:35] to the word listen Mary came to the word
[1:15:38] the word came to her the word comes to
[1:15:40] the word when when Isaiah 7 said a
[1:15:43] virgin shall conceive that's the word
[1:15:45] Mary was going to be the Fulfillment of
[1:15:46] that part that said a virgin she was a
[1:15:49] virgin she was the
[1:15:52] word and she's going to receive amen the
[1:15:55] life of God within her amen and bring
[1:15:57] forth Christ bring forth a son bring
[1:15:59] forth Emanuel amen and she was that
[1:16:02] vessel she was that good ground but
[1:16:04] listen the first thing she had to do was
[1:16:06] recognize that today is the day for the
[1:16:08] prophecy I am the place of the prophecy
[1:16:10] and I believe what this messenger saying
[1:16:12] and then she had to surrender to it and
[1:16:14] say be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:16:16] and when she did the Holy Ghost
[1:16:18] overshadowed her and she conceived the
[1:16:20] word but the rest of the prophecy was
[1:16:23] she shall bring forth the son so now the
[1:16:26] word was working in her to finish the
[1:16:30] prophecy she was the good ground but
[1:16:33] that seed fell in that good ground and
[1:16:35] when it fell into the good ground she
[1:16:37] was the Virgin but the Virgin had to
[1:16:38] produce a son and that son had to be
[1:16:40] Emanuel god with us and so now the seed
[1:16:43] starts a process inside of her of
[1:16:45] growing and growing for nine months go
[1:16:48] to 10 months comes the delivery day and
[1:16:50] now what does she do she produces the
[1:16:52] fruit of that that word when Christ is
[1:16:57] born Amen in these prophecies we know
[1:17:00] where the landing place is we know that
[1:17:02] the hour is we know it's time for all of
[1:17:04] these some of these prophecies are still
[1:17:06] in
[1:17:07] process he's still bringing us to the
[1:17:09] fullness of Christ we're still coming
[1:17:11] into His Image we're still growing into
[1:17:12] all things the head he's still washing
[1:17:14] us with the water of the word we're
[1:17:16] still being clothed in the Garment we're
[1:17:18] still in the marriage ceremony we're
[1:17:20] still in the union with Christ we
[1:17:21] haven't yet gone to the marriage supper
[1:17:23] some of these prophecies are still in
[1:17:25] process amen but though they were in
[1:17:27] process Mary still know who she was
[1:17:29] where the word was what life was in her
[1:17:32] and that life was producing
[1:17:37] itself and that's where we
[1:17:40] are these prophecies aren't rolling
[1:17:42] around waiting to find a place they
[1:17:44] found a place by the grace of God and by
[1:17:46] the grace of God he prepared a soil and
[1:17:48] by the grace of God I believe I'm part
[1:17:51] of
[1:17:52] that and now I just need that word that
[1:17:56] I've received to do the work that the
[1:17:58] the life is in the word it has its own
[1:18:00] life it has its own transforming power
[1:18:03] it has the power to reproduce itself
[1:18:05] when it gets in the right soil and I
[1:18:08] believe by God's grace it's getting into
[1:18:10] the right soil and now oh praise God let
[1:18:14] the sunlight shine let the water of the
[1:18:16] Spirit fall and let that life that's in
[1:18:19] the word reproduce itself in this good
[1:18:22] ground
[1:18:26] sometimes the seed is the person
[1:18:28] sometimes the seed is the
[1:18:30] scriptures but these two things have to
[1:18:32] come together to bring forth
[1:18:36] life so amazing the Bible uses these
[1:18:40] analogies and it's full of them
[1:18:43] gardening and farming and Seed sewing
[1:18:46] and
[1:18:48] harvest now we realize we're in the
[1:18:51] harvest season
[1:18:55] and the harvest season comes at the end
[1:18:57] of the growth
[1:18:59] stage and God when we go to the first
[1:19:03] Parable he SED seed into his
[1:19:06] field but that seed was going to come
[1:19:09] through a whole maturing
[1:19:12] process until he was ready to receive
[1:19:15] back the seed that he had
[1:19:19] planted as it goes through the process
[1:19:21] when it first falls in the
[1:19:24] ground that stage of that wheat plant
[1:19:27] responds to the
[1:19:29] season so when it first falls in the
[1:19:31] spring amen those first Springs rains
[1:19:34] that dampness and the cool nights and
[1:19:36] the warming up of the day it starts to
[1:19:38] break that seed and it starts to take
[1:19:40] root and then you see two little sprigs
[1:19:42] coming out what the seed is responding
[1:19:44] to the environment of the day to the
[1:19:47] season that it's in then as the rains
[1:19:50] continue to to to fall and it keeps
[1:19:52] getting warmer it grows a stock and it
[1:19:54] keeps growing and getting longer amen
[1:19:56] and then as the days become longer and
[1:19:59] the sunlight progresses and and the
[1:20:01] moisture starts to fade off then it goes
[1:20:02] into the tassel and then then the pollen
[1:20:04] comes out and it pollinates and and now
[1:20:07] the seed starts to Bud and it's always
[1:20:09] responding to the season that's in now
[1:20:12] listen amen now now we can think of this
[1:20:15] as the children of God as a whole but
[1:20:16] you also think of it as yourself
[1:20:20] amen amen but in the final
[1:20:24] stage the rain
[1:20:26] stops and the full power of the sun amen
[1:20:30] begins to beat on that
[1:20:33] seed and what's it
[1:20:35] doing it's making it it's prepping it
[1:20:38] it's making it right for
[1:20:41] Harvest brother Bram says in Christ is
[1:20:44] revealed in his own word he says the
[1:20:46] thing that's the matter with the message
[1:20:48] today is those who obtain it in their
[1:20:50] hearts must lay in the presence of the
[1:20:51] sun to get right
[1:20:53] red you can't pick up the message and
[1:20:56] you can pick up the message and then let
[1:20:57] the sun bake all the greenness out of
[1:20:59] you see making mature Christians see
[1:21:03] what I mean God is coming soon to
[1:21:05] receive his church and we must have that
[1:21:07] type of Christian for him to receive the
[1:21:09] wheat has got to get
[1:21:12] ripe where is this word where is this
[1:21:15] word that we've received where am I in
[1:21:17] the process where are the children of
[1:21:19] God in the process they're right at the
[1:21:21] end of harvest season
[1:21:23] and the full measure of the word has
[1:21:25] come the full light of the s n is
[1:21:27] shining and what is the full light doing
[1:21:29] in the Hot August sun when the moisture
[1:21:31] is not falling amen what's it doing it's
[1:21:34] baking all the greenness or immaturity
[1:21:37] out of the seed because in order for it
[1:21:39] to go through the Harvest process which
[1:21:41] means to be cut
[1:21:43] down taken to the threshing floor beat
[1:21:46] flailed fogged stomped on by oxen with a
[1:21:49] wiing fork tuck stuck under thrown into
[1:21:51] the air winds of persecution blowing
[1:21:53] across it falling back on more beating
[1:21:56] more tossing more all of that what is
[1:21:58] that that's the final stage of harvest
[1:22:00] and for that seed that part of the word
[1:22:02] amen to come to the Harvest it can't
[1:22:04] have any greenness in it because
[1:22:06] greenness makes it soft it makes it doy
[1:22:09] it's milky and if you take it through
[1:22:10] that process it'll crush it and break it
[1:22:12] and it'll fall
[1:22:17] apart we've come to the final
[1:22:20] stage the word has to come to full
[1:22:23] maturity and what happens in full
[1:22:25] maturity it firms
[1:22:28] up then everything else around it pulls
[1:22:32] away in the final stage there's
[1:22:35] separation why is there separation
[1:22:38] because that hot sun has to bake the
[1:22:40] greenness
[1:22:42] out that hot sun has to bring that seed
[1:22:44] to the final stage of maturity amen so
[1:22:47] that it can go to the Garner and and
[1:22:49] it's got to get that seed right or else
[1:22:52] it'll never make it through the final
[1:22:54] stage of
[1:22:55] harvest but guess what the shuck can't
[1:22:58] take it the stalk can't take it they
[1:22:59] flourished in their season but they
[1:23:01] can't take it in this season the only
[1:23:03] thing that can take it is the
[1:23:07] seed that's why the shut pulls away and
[1:23:09] falls out that's why everything turns
[1:23:11] brown and dead that's why there's no
[1:23:13] life anywhere else but there's life
[1:23:15] inside the seed amen but the but the the
[1:23:18] life inside the seed that seed has got
[1:23:20] to be able to carry that life all all
[1:23:22] the way into the Garner in order to
[1:23:24] carry that life into the Garner it's got
[1:23:26] to be prepared it's got to be I I hate
[1:23:28] to say it this way but it's got to be
[1:23:31] hardened it's got to be firmed up it's
[1:23:33] got to be able to take the pounding able
[1:23:36] to take the tribulation able to take the
[1:23:38] rejection able to take all of that it's
[1:23:40] got to be able to take it friends and I
[1:23:42] believe with all my heart we're in the
[1:23:44] final stage amen you see the way God is
[1:23:46] breaking the word to us amen you see the
[1:23:48] message that was preached last Wednesday
[1:23:50] amen about the pride of life and all the
[1:23:53] things in our life guess what the shuck
[1:23:55] can't take that kind of preaching cuz
[1:23:56] the shuck wants to be told you're a good
[1:23:58] boy and you're a good Christian and
[1:24:00] you're a bride and you're fine amen but
[1:24:02] the seed's got to get in Condition it's
[1:24:04] got to go through the next phase it
[1:24:06] can't be soft it can't be milky it is
[1:24:09] going to get crushed it's going to get
[1:24:10] broken amen when the World Council

[1:24:16] to break loose amen you got to be firmed
[1:24:19] up and to be firmed up there's got to be
[1:24:21] a bright sunlight that'll root out all
[1:24:23] your immaturity and find out where it's
[1:24:25] laying and all of a sudden you lay there
[1:24:27] and all of a sudden it's like you're
[1:24:28] sucking and you know what's it doing

[1:24:34] moisture that's that makes it fat and

[1:24:57] trembling ready to turn loose of the
[1:25:00] seed because that seed's about ready to
[1:25:03] be snapped off the top thrown into a
[1:25:07] threshing floor trotten on with oxen
[1:25:09] tossed all around to take into the
[1:25:15] Garner why does it feel like we can't
[1:25:17] get away with
[1:25:21] anything why does it feel like I think
[1:25:24] something I'm just thinking it I didn't
[1:25:26] say anything I didn't do I just had this
[1:25:29] thought and all of a sudden God comes
[1:25:31] through the pull pit amen and through a
[1:25:32] human vessel has no idea he comes and he
[1:25:35] start to open up my thoughts and condemn
[1:25:37] all of my thinking and all of my
[1:25:39] feelings and all my selfishness and all
[1:25:41] of my pride and all that what's he doing
[1:25:44] the hot son of the word has come to a
[1:25:46] level it's trying to suck all the
[1:25:48] greenness out of the seed so it can go
[1:25:50] to the next stage why it's got life in
[1:25:52] it the life that he wants to draw back
[1:25:54] to
[1:25:58] himself we got to sit there and say it
[1:26:02] feels
[1:26:08] good suck the greenness suck the
[1:26:12] moisture you see as it's drying up it's
[1:26:15] not as
[1:26:17] pretty it's not as fat and plump and
[1:26:20] pretty it starts to dry and get brown
[1:26:22] down and it's
[1:26:23] pale there's no more milk in it there
[1:26:26] it's not juicy
[1:26:28] it's
[1:26:33] dry and our old life becomes nothing
[1:26:36] amen our outer self becomes nothing amen
[1:26:38] it becomes dry it becomes nothing
[1:26:40] special it becomes nothing that I want
[1:26:45] anymore it's got to be firmed up got to
[1:26:49] be
[1:26:49] hardened to go to the next stage
[1:26:53] I thank God that he knows this
[1:26:56] process he knew where to plant his seed
[1:26:59] he knows who his seed
[1:27:01] is on one hand I'm the
[1:27:05] plant I'm the wheat plant he's growing
[1:27:09] me all the way to
[1:27:11] harvest on the other hand I'm the ground
[1:27:14] that the that the word is growing
[1:27:16] through and it's coming all the way to
[1:27:18] harvest but either way it's the same
[1:27:21] process God's going to bring all of his
[1:27:24] prophecy to
[1:27:26] life he's going to bring forth fruit and
[1:27:28] he's going to bring that fruit to a
[1:27:29] harvest condition and he's going to
[1:27:31] return it back to
[1:27:33] himself and God knew what season to
[1:27:37] plant the seed and he knew what ground
[1:27:39] he would plant it
[1:27:41] in and for years we say I'm bride I'm
[1:27:44] bride I'm bride I'm bride and you know
[1:27:46] what we were right and I thank God for
[1:27:48] the faith to be able to say it that's a
[1:27:51] privilege
[1:27:53] but I think we're beginning to realize
[1:27:55] what it means to be
[1:27:57] bride what it means to be like
[1:28:00] Christ when Christ went through the
[1:28:02] final stages of redemption when he went
[1:28:04] to pay the price of redemption he lost
[1:28:06] self he lost dignity listen he was
[1:28:09] crucified naked friends he was stripped
[1:28:12] he was beat he was rejected he was
[1:28:14] mocked and made fun of he was spit
[1:28:18] upon he was hardened yeah he could go
[1:28:22] through it he didn't defend himself he
[1:28:24] didn't call the angels that were sitting
[1:28:26] on every tree to come and rescue him he
[1:28:28] went right through the will and word of
[1:28:30] God to manifest the full word of God and
[1:28:32] never defended himself never protected
[1:28:34] himself never promoted
[1:28:36] himself and he could have done all of it
[1:28:39] way better than you and I can do it amen
[1:28:42] but he left us an example and we wanted
[1:28:44] to be bride and we wanted to be just
[1:28:46] like him and we'll be so much like him
[1:28:47] in the end we will be him I think that
[1:28:50] that's absolutely the truth that's a
[1:28:52] prophecy that's come from a prophet that
[1:28:54] in this end time she will be so much
[1:28:55] like him she will be him she will be so
[1:28:57] much like him she won't defend herself
[1:28:59] protect herself she won't she won't even
[1:29:02] correct the errors when they bring false
[1:29:03] accusations he won't defend
[1:29:06] himself I think she's going to be so
[1:29:08] much like him she will be
[1:29:12] him when they threw Stones he didn't
[1:29:14] throw them back when when they punched
[1:29:16] he didn't punch back when they spit he
[1:29:17] didn't spit
[1:29:20] back he yielded and surrendered to the
[1:29:23] will of God and said be it unto me
[1:29:26] according to thy will and the word came
[1:29:28] to full
[1:29:30] manifestation in that good ground he was
[1:29:33] the seed and the seed was living in
[1:29:36] him I Believe by the grace of God we are
[1:29:39] the seed and the seed's been swn in us
[1:29:41] and the seeds coming to fruit in
[1:29:45] us but God's going to work his Harvest
[1:29:49] process and the light's going to shine
[1:29:53] guess
[1:29:54] what if there's any
[1:29:57] greenness it's going to come
[1:30:01] out it's going to come
[1:30:05] out if we're of the group that needs to
[1:30:07] be told we're special and we're perfect
[1:30:09] and we're lovely and everything's great
[1:30:12] about
[1:30:13] us brother B said we got to lay in the
[1:30:15] presence of the sun to bake all the
[1:30:17] immaturity out to bake all the greenness
[1:30:20] out so that we can finish the commission
[1:30:24] finish the work that he left for this
[1:30:27] day when two omnipotence come together

[1:30:33] power say I don't know that I can go

[1:34:19] all she could do was receive the word
[1:34:21] word and that was by
[1:34:24] Grace but when she received the word
[1:34:27] your word produced itself in
