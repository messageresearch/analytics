[0:00] you know there was prophecies laying in
[0:01] the Bible amen Prophecies of Joel
[0:03] Prophecies of David types and shadows
[0:05] All Through the Bible when we come to
[0:07] the day of Pentecost amen and Jesus had
[0:10] died he had resurrected amen he had
[0:12] shown himself to disciples he had raised
[0:14] again they knew that Jesus was the
[0:16] Messiah they knew that he had died they
[0:18] knew he raised again they they knew he
[0:21] was on the right hand of power they knew
[0:22] all of these things but yet they were
[0:24] waiting for something amen they were
[0:26] waiting for a designation for a marker
[0:28] for a happening for an event
[0:31] to launch them into their Ministry
[0:34] and so they were waiting for 10 days in
[0:36] the upper room amen but then all of a
[0:38] sudden the promise of the fathers came
[0:41] the Fulfillment of the scripture amen
[0:44] the prophecy now come into manifestation
[0:46] and when that happened amen The Men Who
[0:49] were frightened before the men who who
[0:51] were discouraged and unsure and
[0:53] uncertain and all of these things that
[0:55] were going on now all of a sudden they
[0:57] were filled with the spirit of God they
[0:58] changed with a boldness they ran out
[1:00] into the street and with a boldness they
[1:02] proclaimed this is nothing but the word
[1:04] of God this is that and this is this and
[1:07] this is that and now they were taking
[1:08] the word and they were placing it
[1:12] what happened to their faith when they
[1:14] realized this is the scripture fulfilled
[1:16] this is the prophecy come this is the
[1:18] marker of time now it's not a prophecy
[1:21] now it's a happening
[1:23] it's no longer a prophecy it's a reality
[1:26] it's a manifestation the prophecy is now
[1:28] real what did it do to them it increased
[1:31] their faith it gave them lying like
[1:32] boldness it gave him the ability to go
[1:34] out on the face of everything and now
[1:35] declare the truth who were hiding before
[1:37] now the Spirit came according to the
[1:39] word and they were men that were bold
[1:41] they knew who they were they knew their
[1:42] position they knew what they were
[1:44] supposed to do
[1:47] and now there's something that's going
[1:49] to come under the revelation of the
[1:52] Seven Seals under the sounding of the
[1:55] seven Thunders under the third pool
[1:57] under the revealing of the Mysteries
[1:59] under the seventh Angels Ministry
[2:03] that will bring us back to that same
[2:05] faith
[2:08] what is it
[2:10] it's the revealing of the Mysteries
[2:13] what do you mean brother Chad
[2:15] it's the time date stamp marker you are
[2:20] here
[2:21] you are here and if you can receive it
[2:25] you are it
[2:29] and it brings us right back to the faith
[2:31] of the fathers now I know this is the
[2:34] day for prophecy to be filled modern
[2:36] events May clear by prophecy that is
[2:38] this what you see now is that prophecy
[2:40] being fulfilled amen when he promised
[2:43] that he would have a bride he's having a
[2:45] bride right now when he promised he
[2:46] would wash her with the water of the
[2:48] word the washing is taking place right
[2:50] now
[2:52] this is that we know who we are when the
[2:55] spirit was held back because the word
[2:57] was held back through the nominational
[2:58] rivers but in the evening time it's to
[3:00] be loosed by the evening time message
[3:02] the Holy Ghost back in the people again
[3:04] why there's no more false teaching
[3:07] barrier there's no more misunderstanding
[3:09] barrier but now when the word the
[3:11] revelation of the word comes back it it
[3:13] unlocks and unbinds the moving of the
[3:15] spirit to come back and make us what it
[3:18] intended to make us in the beginning he
[3:20] said You shall be endued with power from
[3:22] on high and ye shall be my Witnesses
