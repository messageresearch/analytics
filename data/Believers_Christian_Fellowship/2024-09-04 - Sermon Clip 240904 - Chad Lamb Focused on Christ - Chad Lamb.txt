TRANSCRIPT
========================================
listen it can't last much longer it's not going to last forever whatever you're going through it can't last much longer just think about it life is only 80 90 years it won't last forever whatever you're going through it'll end the trial you in and I don't know anybody who's been through an 80 90e trial they start and they end they start mysteriously sometimes they end mysteriously but no matter where you are in the journey it's going to end it's this is not going to last forever and we're at the end time when for all of us it's going to end there's an end there's a there there's a goal there's a mark there's a prize there's something to win there's a prize at the end of this board we just need to ride down it and don't worry about who all fell off before but they were better Christians than me and they fell they were better riters than me they were fell they were more skilled and they couldn't make it it doesn't matter none of that matters there's a goal and I'm predestinated to make the goal so what am I going to do every day I'm just going to keep pressing towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus you know what Joshua and Caleb didn't know they didn't know how they were going to knock the walls down yeah they didn't know how to kill Giants and they didn't know where they were going to get armor and weapons yeah they didn't know how they were going to fight when they were outnumbered they didn't know how they were going to supply the army they didn't know there was a million things they didn't know but the things they didn't know didn't matter the thing they did know is the only thing they needed to know and I don't know how we're going to cross obstacles that we have yet to cross as a bride I don't know how I'm going to cross obstacles I have to cross as an individual or my family will have to cross or this church will have to cross I don't know how we're going to cross it I don't know how we're going to overcome it I don't know how we move Beyond it I don't know but one thing I know is the only thing I need to know that there is an author and a finisher of my faith and he predestinated me to cross that line and if I didn't believe that I should just quit now because there's no way I'm going to make it I just have to believe it I have to believe that I was in his mind before the foundation of the world and he wants me to make it to the goal because he wants me he's on the other end pulling me cuz an invisible string tied around my handlebars and he's over there and just keep focused to the one who altered our faith and is finishing our faith brother BM says there's a thousand ways to die there's only one to live and that's Christ there's a million things that take your time and attention there's one worth focusing on that's Christ there's all kinds of ways to fall off of this road but there's only one way to stay on it and that's keep focused on Christ
