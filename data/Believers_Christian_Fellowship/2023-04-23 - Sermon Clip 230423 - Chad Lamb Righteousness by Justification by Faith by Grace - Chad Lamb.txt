========================================

before the law God had righteous servants Abel was righteous Abraham was righteous the question is how were they righteous they were righteous by faith before the law the children of God were declared righteous by faith because they believed God Abel believed God Abraham believed God they didn't believe the same part does that make sense they believed the present tense God the I am God The God Who was coming to them by Revelation and giving them the word for their day and when Abel received the Revelation for his day he was declared he witnessed that he was righteous when Abraham received the the instructions from God the word of God for his day it was imputed unto him for righteousness praise God then the law comes and then all the Deeds started amen but before the law remember the law came as a failure of Israel to keep the word of God and come up into the mountain and exodus to come to Sinai they ran away and brother bam said that's where they made their fatal mistake in Exodus 19 they chose law over Grace God wasn't going to give them the law he was going to give them Grace all he was going to give them was the Ten Commandments and that was it the book of ordinances and all the laws and the rituals it came after they turned from God and sent Moses up God was going to deal with them with Grace where they would receive a revelation of the word and when they and that Revelation as they believed it would be imputed unto them for righteousness that's how it was before but now that the law was fulfilled in Christ and he became the ultimate sacrifice freeing us from the bondage of the law it has gone right back to what it was before now it's righteousness by Faith by a revelation in your God in your day in Jesus Christ today you see how the message opens the whole Bible things that are fundamental to Christianity they've been absolutely lost they've been they've been they've been hijacked amen and they've made it repeat after me prayers repeat after me I believe Jesus died for me on a cross 2000 years ago and they're repeating this and they're acknowledging what happened Amen in in declaring people to be righteous and to be justified but my goodness the Revelation from the Bible it's everybody who had imputed righteousness it was declared righteous or witnessed to be righteous were people who believe the god of their day the I am present tense of God and the Bible so opens up the Revelation the truth of justification the truth of righteousness and the message has taken us back to the realities of these things
