[0:01] satan's deception is to make you believe
[0:04] that you are saved when you're not
[0:10] the only other tactic that he has
[0:15] the only other tactic that he has
[0:20] is if you really are saved
[0:22] to make you believe you're not
[0:27] that's his two
[0:28] tactics he is going to convince you that
[0:32] you are saved when you're really not
[0:35] or
[0:36] if you really are
[0:39] he's going to try to convince you you're
[0:40] not
[0:42] because he knows if you have that proper
[0:44] understanding and you have the
[0:45] indwelling comforter he is powerless
[0:47] before you because the scripture says if
[0:49] my heart does not condemn me nothing can
[0:51] stand in my way
[0:55] so because religious is his business
[0:59] that's the only thing that he has
[1:01] i got to convince you you're saved
[1:03] before you really do get saved but if by
[1:05] perchance you do get saved before i
[1:06] convince you you're not saved i have to
[1:08] make you believe that you're not saved
[1:09] when you really are saved
[1:12] that is his business
[1:14] and that is what takes the comforter
[1:17] away from us
[1:20] that is why the seals had to be loosed
[1:23] that is why we had to have a vindicated
[1:25] prophet come and tell us what is right
[1:28] and what is wrong and that is why we
[1:31] have to die to any of our own thinking
[1:34] and strictly
[1:37] legalistically
[1:39] militantly
[1:40] take what he said is truth
[1:44] because anything else
[1:47] is going to leave us running around the
[1:49] cow shed
[1:52] anything else
[1:54] is going to bring us down
[1:58] from our proper position
[2:00] anything else is going to bring
[2:02] condemnation into our heart
[2:05] remember religion is satan's business
[2:08] you're not going to beat him at it
[2:11] you are not going to beat satan at
[2:14] religion
[2:16] it is his business and he has spent
[2:18] thousands and thousands and thousands of
[2:20] years just in this dimension mastering
[2:23] it let alone what he did in the other
[2:25] dimension
[2:26] you are not going to beat him with your
[2:29] mental prowess
[2:33] we have one chance saints we have one
[2:37] hope
[2:39] and that is to take what the voice said
[2:41] to us
[2:42] and if he said
[2:45] that the evidence of receiving god in
[2:48] your being
[2:50] is to believe
[2:52] on him who he hath sent
[2:54] and yield completely to that word
[2:57] that is the one and only evidence
[3:00] and you have done that
[3:02] do not allow satan to talk you out
