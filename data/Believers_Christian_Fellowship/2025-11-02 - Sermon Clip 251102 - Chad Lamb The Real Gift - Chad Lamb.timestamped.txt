[0:00] This is the mind of God. This is the
[0:04] family album.
[0:06] This is where I find my identification.
[0:10] Amen. I took the kids and I I took them
[0:12] to Malachi 4 and repeated what brother
[0:15] Gabe did a few weeks ago when he says,
[0:17] you look at Malachi 4 and says, "Behold,
[0:19] I that's God send you."
[0:22] &gt;&gt; That's the mystery.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet. And we believe we
[0:26] know who that is.
[0:28] William Brandham.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; So those who receive the prophet
[0:35] &gt;&gt; and receive his mis ministry, who are
[0:38] they?
[0:40] &gt;&gt; I'll go through it again.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Behold, I
[0:44] send you
[0:47] &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; So this scripture identifies three
[0:51] people.
[0:53] &gt;&gt; That identifies God. It identifies
[0:55] Elijah the prophet. And it identifies a
[0:58] people who Elijah the prophet was sent
[1:01] to.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; So if you've received the ministry of
[1:05] Elijah the prophet,
[1:07] &gt;&gt; who are you?
[1:11] &gt;&gt; Did you just identify yourself
[1:13] scripturally?
[1:15] &gt;&gt; You just identified yourself
[1:17] scripturally. You didn't look in your
[1:19] mirror. You didn't look at your past.
[1:20] You didn't look who your parents were.
[1:22] You didn't consider what you done right
[1:23] yesterday or wrong yesterday. You found
[1:26] your identification in the prophecy for
[1:28] this day. I'M PART OF THE PROPHECY.
[1:32] BEHOLD, I SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET.
[1:35] I'VE RECEIVED THAT ELIJAH the prophet.
[1:37] SO, HE SENT ME. I'M IN THE WORD.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; I'M PART OF THE WORD.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; I FOUND MY IDENTIFICATION IN THE MIRROR
[1:45] OF GOD'S WORD.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; What about where the carcass is, the
[1:52] eagles will be gathered.
[1:55] What carcass? Brother Bram said, "The
[1:56] fresh kill of the word, where the word
[1:58] is fresh for your day."
[2:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; The fresh mana that fell. Not the old
[2:02] carryover from a previous age. Not what
[2:04] had been killed the day before on the
[2:06] road, but the fresh kill of the word,
[2:08] which is what? The message of the hour.
[2:10] And the fresh kill of the word is where
[2:12] the eagles are gathered. The question
[2:14] is, is this message the fresh kill of
[2:16] the word?
[2:18] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU ATTRACTED TO IT?
[2:20] &gt;&gt; Are you feeding on it?
[2:22] &gt;&gt; Do you like it? YEAH.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; THEN WHAT'S YOUR IDENTIFICATION? ARE YOU
[2:26] AN EAGLE
[2:27] &gt;&gt; BASED OFF WHAT? THE WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT
[2:29] YOURSELF. NO. BASED OFF THE WORD OF GOD.
[2:32] I'M AN EAGLE. I FOUND MY IDENTIFICATION
[2:34] IN THE WORD TO BREAK MY AMNESIA.
[2:38] &gt;&gt; You say, "BUT I CAN'T CALL MYSELF AN
[2:40] EAGLE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID
[2:41] YESTERDAY." LISTEN, I DON'T CARE WHAT
[2:42] YOU DID YESTERDAY. I'M LOOKING AT THE
[2:45] PROMISE FOR THIS HOUR. AND THERE'S GOT
[2:46] TO BE A PEOPLE WHO CAN IDENTIFY
[2:48] THEMSELVES WITH THE WORD OF GOD AND STOP
[2:51] RELYING ON FEELINGS AND STOP GOING UP
[2:53] AND DOWN EVERY FIVE MINUTES BUT COME
[2:55] BACK TO THE BASIS OF FAITH IN THE WORD
[2:57] AND FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE BY THE WRITTEN
[2:59] WORD.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; THIS DOESN'T CHANGE YOUR EMOTIONS
[3:02] CHANGE. THIS DOESN'T CHANGE YOUR YOUR
[3:05] IDEAS CHANGE. YOUR EMOTIONS CHANGE. YOUR
[3:08] RESOLVE TO DO GOOD CHANGES.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; But this word can't change. Amen.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; We have to find our identification in
[3:18] the word.
