Joshua 24 and 14. now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and served the Lord and if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites and whose lands you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord amen God bless you as you take your seeds you can see here that Joshua is speaking to the children of Israel he is giving them the opportunity to make a choice and he's telling him to choose you this day whom you will serve you have options he's saying you can choose the the gods your father served on the other side of the flood you can choose the gods of the amarites and whose lands you go into he says but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord amen and uh brother man tells us that God has a law of choosing and he talks about free moral agency and tonight I just want to talk for a little bit about the responsibility of free will amen we talk about the I want to talk about responsibility of free will when I was meditating on this and thinking about it we talk about Free Will and brother random talks so much about free will free choice free moral agency they all tied together amen and it's a it's a wonderful thing he said God put man equal to him when he gave him free choice and and it it's a it I don't know it seems like a wonderful thing but the more I meditate on it I wonder how wonderful it is I almost wish God would take away my free choice and just I I would prefer that God didn't leave it up to me to choose that he would just choose for me and that I would do everything just he would come down and do it for me but God has set this life up in certain way that he wants to prove all things and everything must be proved and everything must be demonstrated Faith must be demonstrated and the thing that overcomes the world is Faith so God had to set the world in such a way that Faith could rise to the occasion and can prove who is seed and who is not and so God had to allow this operation of free will or free choice or free moral agency but with that comes a tremendous amount of responsibility if God was going to put us on an equal basis with him amen then then it means we we operate as minor gods in a way because we can make choices amen and so uh it comes with a a heavy responsibility here Joshua's he's demonstrating this law of choice that God has made brother Benham says you don't have to serve God if you don't want to you don't have to serve God if you don't want to amen if you don't want to if you don't want to follow his statutes you don't have to he doesn't Force anybody if we're going to serve God we're going to serve God because we choose to because we have a heart to and we know that behind all of that is the sea Gene of God that God has planted something in the soul amen that's a part of himself that will respond to the word we know what we know all of that and I'm I'm just wanting to get down to the operation of Free Will for today so we know that if we ever choose God it's him choosing us and drawing us it wasn't us of ourselves amen but God still has this structure in this life a free choice and and so many things in life we don't get instructions in the mail and I would absolutely love instructions in the mail I'd love to go to the mailbox every Monday and pull out my instructions for that week and these are the decisions that you make and these are the choices that you make and this is what I want you to do Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday and that would be so wonderful amen because I would want with all my heart to do what he he told me to do but actually God has has structured this world and this and this natural life that we live in such a way that he wants us to get an education amen you know well I'm just going to read this quote here and then we'll go into that and the message of prisoner he says now we're all born a free moral agent to make any decision that we wish to God justly does that because he must put every man on the same basis or he put the wrong man he put the first man on the wrong basis that he put on free moral agency see we're just exactly tonight like Adam and Eve there's no difference right and wrong sets before either one of us life and death we can make our choice up to you to make it that's the way Adam and Eve did and see and they made the wrong choice and now by that put the whole race of human race under death and the penalty of death and then God came down in the form of man and took that death and paid the penalty of death his subjects that desired to to be free could go free now if he took us without the same way that he did Adam and Eve and just pulled us through something said I'll save you whether you want saved or not then he put Adam and Eve on the wrong basis you see but each one of us has to choose this day between death and life God did this for a purpose he set man and with free moral Agency for a purpose then we know that God Amen he he initially said man in the Garden of Eden with free more Legacy to make his own choice because God knew that they would fall but he couldn't make them fall but he gave them the ability to make their own choice amen because God knew in his mind that they would fall because he had attributes within himself that must be displayed and those attributes could not be displayed and they're the attribute of savor could not be displayed unless something was lost it needed to be saved attribute of healer could not be displayed unless something was sick and when someone was sick and needed to be healed unless someone needed to be redeemed he couldn't be a redeemer amen so he he is all of these things so he wants amen he allows the circumstances to be such that man can choose because God cannot make him fall and be just God cannot force him Amen to fall into sin and to leave the world and still be considered a just God Amen so what he does in his Justice is he allows man to choose for himself amen knowing that the circumstances will get such a way that the man will make the wrong choice but it puts the attributes of God into action to display themselves and now man learns something about God now we can experience God as a savior now we can experience God as a Healer now we can experience the mercy and grace of God to forgive us of our sins and wash us from unrighteous [Music] so you see God didn't just leave the free moral agency in place so that Adam and the woman could fall and make their mistake and so he could go into action amen and then he would take it away and now each one of us have to come like robots no he left this he left the law of free choice in place because free choice is part of our education we come to this life amen to learn about God to know God to understand things that we could not understand in a perfect environment so this is our school we're in school now here we're gaining character for reigning in the future so here we're learning and we're growing and increasing in character and in knowledge and an understanding and part of that process is going to require a law of free choice to be in place so that we can make some wrong choices in life and have to repent and recognize God as our savior our healer our deliverer the merciful god who has forgiven me of my sins the gracious God who has forgiven me and so God left the free choice because it works into his his plan for his children to know him not to be like the angels in heaven who worship him but don't know what it means to be saved they don't they never lost they don't know what it means to be saved they were never sick they don't know what it means to be healed amen they were never they never were in need of redemption they didn't need God to forgive them amen they were the angels that were held and kept in Perfection and so God allows this Free Will free choice in order for his his attributes to to be displayed not just through the world but to us and also in the in the education that we're here if we look at the education that the the all of God's children have received through the Bible it all kept pointing back to one thing that his word is the only way he would give his word and his children would always choose another way he would give his word and and they would choose to go back into idolatry give us word and they would forsake the word they would make their choices Joshua is saying this day you have a choice and they're all saying we choose the Lord we will serve the Lord amen he declared what for his household they would do they all made the same way but just a few Generations later they were serving the gods of the people that they were supposed to conquer and drive out they made their choice to go backwards amen and so but that set up another cycle of falling of apostasy and failure and judgment and Redemption and restoration and then it would cycle again and every time they were learning to take the word and keep the word Above All Else that nothing but the word works and what was making this lesson what was grinding the lesson in it was free choice because they could choose to do wrong and because they did choose to do wrong would start a whole nother cycle and at the end of that cycle there would be children of God standing there saying we want nothing but the word because nothing but the word will work and in our life we have a we have free choice and many of us have been through some Cycles we've been through Cycles because of our choices amen but at the end of the cycle there's one thing that always comes to the front nothing but the word will work amen I want nothing but the word in my life I I don't want my own will I don't want my own desire but my deepest desire is to please him and my deepest desire is to keep his word yeah because this cycle is an education that is teaching me nothing else will work brother Branham says in the choosing of a bride said there's another choice that we have in life that's a life's companion a young man or young woman stepping out on life has been given a right to make a choice the young man chooses the young woman has a right to accept or reject it but it's still a choice on both sides both men and women they have a right to to a choice also you have a choice as a Christian you have a choice of the church here in America so far that you could go to that's your own American privilege to choose any church that you want to belong to that's a choice you don't have to go to any of them if you don't want to but if you want to change from Methodist to Baptist or Catholic to Protestant or so forth there's nobody can tell you or make you to make you come to any certain church that's our freedom that's what our democracy is every man can choose for himself freedom of religion is a great thing God help us to keep it as long as we can you have also a choice you can choose this church you can choose whether in this church whether you will choose a church that will guide you to your Eternal destination you can choose a church that has a certain Creed that you might think that Creed is just what you want or other church as another Creed and then there is the word of God you have a choice of you have to make the choice there's an unwritten law Among Us of choosing brother remember goes through so many things you have a right to choose your wife or you have the you know the woman has a right to choose whether she'll accept the offer of a man or not the right to which church you want to go to which Doctrine you want to believe what job you want to work amen where you want to live there's all these choices that have been God has been given to us to make and we can make these choices amen but but all of these choices have consequences every one of these choices has consequences brother Branham said you better pray boy before you get married he says because you could ruin your whole life same thing with the girl you better pray amen and let God give you spiritual Insight because you can ruin your whole life but it's the same is true for which church you attend it's the same thing it's true for ever what you accept to choose to believe same thing is true for where you live and and what job you have and all of these things we better pray because these choices have consequences amen and God has given us the ability to choose we can we can choose and that choice will have an outcome that's why I titled this the responsibility of free will because we have to recognize the responsibility let's turn to Isaiah 65 just for I want to catch a quick verse here Isaiah 65 Isaiah 65 and verse 12. therefore will I number you to the sword and you shall all bow down to the slaughter because when I called you did not answer and when I spake you did not hear but did evil before in mine eyes and did choose that wherein I delighted not now he's telling the sword is coming I'm numbering you to the sword destruction is coming because when I spake you didn't hear when I called you didn't come and you chose the thing that I delighted not in and now you know now Israel can be coming under the falling under the sword being numbered to The Sword whatever kind of Destruction that would be and they would have no right to cry out God why are you letting this happen to us because he already told them why it was happening to them because they didn't heed the call they didn't listen when he spoke and they chose that which he didn't Delight in and their choice brought about their destruction it wasn't God it was them [Music] I mean they couldn't cry out in the day of Calamity oh God why are you doing this to me no it's it's oh God forgive me for doing this to myself that's the problem with our culture and that's the problem with the America that we live in is everybody wants to blame somebody else everybody wants somebody else to be responsible or take responsibility for their actions nobody wants to take responsibility for their own actions amen Amen brother bam says in the marriage of the Lamb he says so many say if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing I'll serve him but that's up to you see you've got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they did overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down amen it says she she has made herself ready I like that word you see God could not push us through a little pie pull us out the other end and then say blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself I have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to God I just I I love this because brother random now is taking the responsibility and putting it back on us because we want so many times to cry out to God God why are you letting this happen to me and many times if we'll just reflect on what's going on in our lives we will recognize this is happening because of our own choices because of our own choices and we want somebody else we want somebody else to blame and many times the way we pray demonstrates that we're accusing God God why is this happening why why are you letting this happen and then when we do recognize that it's our wrong choices then we say things like God why didn't you stop me because we know that God is powerful and that God could stop us we've we've seen him stop people before amen we saw him stop brother Branham before he drank and before he smoked and God stopped him amen and we see God stop some of the Patriarchs and things that they were going to do but God didn't always stop them amen sometimes he let them go amen it depend on whether or not like for brother Branham he needed that vessel to stay clean and pure because he had a work for him to do that would benefit the entire bride but it doesn't mean he didn't let brother Manna make decisions and make mistakes he made decisions and he made mistakes and we'll look at that here in a minute it wasn't that he always stopped him but when he stopped him he stopped him for our benefit same thing down through the life of the Patriarchs amen when God injects himself and stops somebody he does it for the benefit of the greater good for all of us but there are times amen that we must make our choice so that we can learn the lesson that only choosing the word will work amen and there's consequences for our choices we we have and we suffer many times as consequences but those consequences are tremendous lessons to keep us from making the same Choice again David he made a decision one day to take another man's wife it was not something that was forced upon him that was him exercising his free will and then exercising his free will he had an innocent man killed he took another man's wife amen and when Nathan the prophet came and exposed it there was consequences for his action and he said the sword shall never depart from thy household and David repented and said God has also forgiven you amen but there's still a sword that was in his household two of one of his sons killed another one of his sons one of his sons raped one of his daughters I mean there was tremendous amount of trouble what was the consequence it was the consequences of David's free choice amen and when David was exposed by Nathan David never said anything silly like God why didn't you stop me or he never said God it was her fault she didn't cover herself brother Branham said she didn't she knew where the king took his walk and she didn't pull the shade but he's willing to take responsibility for himself and say I have sinned amen and God forgave him of his sin but there was still consequences and the consequences remain there everything in life has consequences good and bad and we have to we have to uh to me this is where I'm at it's better just to own it from day one and try to excuse it away it's so much better just to come to terms with this that I am responsible for my own actions amen I mean it's like if I speed and I get a ticket what right do I have to be angry ask brother Shea how many people get mad at him because he gives him a ticket and is mad and ain't what did the police officer do he didn't push the gas pedal he wasn't the one in control you were the one in control amen I worked with a man one time he got super angry with me because he got caught drinking while he was canoeing on the Little Miami River and the Little Miami River is supposed to be alcohol free amen and and he was he was drinking beer and and he come into work and he was just ranting and raving about the park ranger the park ranger was parked on a bridge and he was using binoculars to find me and they're not allowed to do that amen they're not and he's going to go to court and fight it and I just asked him I asked him two questions I said were you drinking he said yes I said did you know you weren't supposed to drink he said yes that seemed silly but that's the way people live and that's the way we have lived we make choices amen and the consequences come around and then we get angry about the consequences and we get upset about the circumstances and things that are happening amen when we recognize we should be recognizing this is my fault amen this is happening because of me amen amen I I just wrote down a few examples because it's so simple and it's in everyday life that we need to come to terms with this amen I I went a little while ago because I noticed I was having trouble hearing and uh I went for an uh audio test or whatever and I found out that I have a little bit of hearing loss especially in my left ear and when I when I found out the lady started asking me questions he was doing the test she goes have you ever worked in a loud environment I said yes she goes did you wear hearing protection I said no and they looked at it and they said this is classic typical uh high frequency hearing loss by damage that happened earlier from noisy environments said his textbook and I said you know what I could get angry that I'm struggling to hear I could get mad but the reality is I knew when I had that job that there was extremely loud noises and I knew that I should get hearing protection but most of the time my hearing protection was out in the truck and it was a long walk out to the truck and back yeah and I took my chances because I was young and because I stuck my head in that cabinet dozens of times and I didn't come out deaf I started to assume there was no consequences for my actions and here I am 20 years after that that employment and I'm struggling with some hearing loss and and now I'm recognizing it's nobody's fault but my own it's my own fault and and you could say God why did you let this happen to me but the problem is I knew that there was consequences and I knew what the potential was and God has Set This World up for us to learn and he is not going to take away all the consequences amen because it defeats his whole purpose so we sometimes think as child of children of God that we are so privileged that this law won't work for us but I'm telling you it works better for us than anybody else yes amen we we we do all kinds of silly things I remember being on vacation with the family amen and I remember them all laughing at me because I would soak myself in sunscreen they thought it was funny ha ha ha look at that he's afraid of the Sun Well when you're bald-headed if you've suffered the consequences once you don't ever want to do it again but lo and behold that night everybody turned up sunburned now who's laughing and whose fault is it amen somebody made an offer it's here it's available there's a whole tube put it on Amen we're out in the sun no it feels so good but you see that is life and it has to be that way it needs to be that way it's for our benefit and we laugh about the sunscreen but that's a minor example but there's major things in life that happen the exact same way I mean there's there's consequences amen you get in relationships with people you're not being in relationships as boys and girls amen and you you as a young lady lose your virginity you will never get it back no matter how much a child of God you are you'll never erase that Mark in your life amen doesn't mean you're not a child of God doesn't mean you won't be forgiven but there'll be consequences for the action and it will never be erased God will forgive you he can even go on to bless you you can have a blessing you can have a family you can have all kinds of these things but there's still never the consequences never go away because you carry that in your conscience and in your heart the rest of your life amen but but God has given a protection for that already and he's delivered it amen in his word amen and all we have to do is listen to him and make the right choice amen and then we won't suffer the consequences so if it's if it's sunscreen hearing protection whatever it all works the same way and we we it would do us good to stop pretending that we're not in this uh in this law free choice and it puts the responsibility on us so when the when now we've been we've been put on an equal basis to God now the responsibility has been put on you and I what choice will we make where would we go what will we do it's it seems so simple but it it's so true man let's look at uh let's look at Genesis 13. I want to go to this story foreign and verse 5. in lot also which went with Abram had flocks and herds and Tents and the land was not able to Bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was Strife between the Herdman Abraham's cattle and the Herdman of lots cattle and the Canaanite and the parasite dwelt then in the land and Abram said unto lot let there be no Strife I pray thee between me and thee in between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be Brethren is not the whole land before thee separate thyself I pray thee from me if thou will take the left hand then I will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then I will go to the left so now Lord has given a choice it's his choice his free choice you choose the way you want to go Abraham's not going to influence his choice but whichever way you go I'll go the other way and give you room verse 10 and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt as thou comest and desire then law chose him all the plain of Jordan and Lot journeyed East and they separated themselves the one from the other Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards Sodom but the men of Sodom were Wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly we all know the story and we know the conclusion to the story but lot made a choice and lot made a choice amen based off pleasantness pleasure easier living brother Benham said Abraham stayed up in the Rocky ground block went down to the well-watered valley but the well-watered valley had sin the well water Valley had Sodom and he pitched his tent towards Sodom amen and he did not do that Amen to be trapped inside him he didn't do it be part of the wickedness of the city amen he made that choice because he could have a better life how many people have made choices for a better life than they've suffered spiritually because of it choices for a better job for a career for a a job that takes them away from fellowship a job that moves them to a place with no no Fellowship no church whatever reason people choose things amen for a better life amen and I I would venture to say lot did not end up with a better life but Abraham have stayed separated and took the rocky ground he wound up with a better life we'll continue in the story in chapter 19. 19 and verse 12. Genesis 19 and 12. and the men said unto lot hast thou hear any besides it's the two angels that have come to rescue him they say unto him having any here besides son-in-law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thou Hast in the city bring them out of this place for we will destroy this place because the Cry of them is waxing great before the face of the Lord and the Lord has sent us to destroy him and lot went out and speak unto his sons-in-law which married his daughters and said up get you out of this place for the Lord will destroy the city but he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons-in-law and when the morning arose when the angel hasten lot saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here lest I be consumed in the iniquity of the city and while he lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters and the Lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the city and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said Escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plane escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed and I skipped down to verse 26. but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt so we see that lot's Choice had consequences the consequences of Lot's choice is he wasn't just pitched towards Sodom but it wasn't much long after until he was in Sodom and his daughters were now married and they had husbands and and who knows where the husbands came from but you can assume that they came from Sodom around about that area and now his daughters are married there and then he goes to try to rescue his family at the bidding of the of the Angels amen and his sons-in-laws looked at him as one that mocked wouldn't listen to him he lost his daughters and Sodom he lost his wife because his wife's heart was in Sodom and even though she was brought out she turned back amen look at all that lot loss when lot made a choice for a better life I'm telling you Lima may not be the most prosperous Pace on Earth it may not be the most beautiful place on Earth but there's fellowship with Believers here amen there's people who hold to the word of God that will encourage us in our walk amen that will preach the word of faith that will stay true to the message and encourage us that way amen I don't want a better job somewhere else amen I'd rather take a lesser job and stay in the place of God than choose a better life and lose my family everything I mean there's other places that are more prosperous there's other places that are more beautiful amen and and we all know that and many of you have moved from some of those places to this place and God bless you amen you chose the rocky ground but but we choose for the word's sake not for pleasure not for personal growth amen not for the our plans in life but we choose for the word we choose careers that way we choose workplaces that way we choose friends we choose spouses we choose all of these things because we put the word first because our our choices have consequences where we live will have consequences where we raise our children in the environment we raise them in will bear consequences where where we choose to make our place of employment and and and what all that entails will have consequences and so and then when the consequences come what right does lot have to get mad what right does lot have to shake his fist at God or to say God why didn't you stop me from going to Sodom and and I mean the reason I can say that so boldly is because I've prayed something like that in the past God you could have stopped me why did you let me do this amen but God has an unwritten law of choosing amen and he's not going to take it away because it works so well to the lesson that we have to learn is that my way will always end in destruction there's only one way and that's his way and so now whatever free choice he's given me I will exercise that to go his way amen brother Venom you said this about Samson he said Samson got into Bad Company and you always can remember that when you're in Bad Company you're out of the will of the Lord my other my own Southern mammal used to tell me if you lay down with a dog that's got fleas you're going to get up with fleas that's rather a rude expression but it's got a lot of common everyday sense to it you just can't associate yourself with the things of the world and expect to stay spiritual and humble before God you can't lay out a fellowship all the time and expect to stay spiritually strong you can't feed on the things of the world every day and expect to stay spiritually strong I mean these these things are not laws I mean there's a this is no legalism to it it's the it's just it may be rude but it's everyday common sense [Music] I mean just like you you can't eat junk food every day and expect to stay fit and look like a bodybuilder it's not going to work this is good old everyday common sense I mean this is basic understanding this is the way the world works this is the way we live in this life so we need we need to own it and understand it and be conscious about the choices we make and not so flip it sometimes and not giving heed but really pay attention to the choices that we're making and say why am I making this choice and why are the potential consequences of this choice amen it matters friends it matters I was meditating on this service and thinking God why in the world am I preaching this service and I just come to the conclusion that there's somebody right now at a point that needs to hear this I don't know who maybe several maybe one I don't know but the point is we've got choices to make and we're going to Bear the responsibility for the choice and every choice will have a consequence every choice how much sleep you get Bears a consequence I mean everything what we eat how much sleep we get where we work what we look at what we listen to it all bears a consequence and God is not going to tell you you can't listen to this radio station but you have to listen if God's not going to come with an audible boy a Audible Voice into your vehicle and say Amen don't turn that one on turn this one on no you get to make that choice but you already know what the right choice is you already know you you already know I mean he's not going to tap you on the shoulder amen when you're enjoying some entertainment of the world and say don't choose that you already know you made the choice amen and God will let us and then bear the consequences amen there are so many things that you learn over life you know you learn the hard way so many things that even we in our house we we would allow for a period of time and and then we would start to get bad consequences then you ask yourself why did I ever let that why did I let it in the door why did I allow that and then also you got to go back and clean up your mistake and make other decisions and and then you can start bearing consequences of a better decision but it does no good to get mad at the children right yeah I mean you let them watch little cartoons where every character on the cartoon is sassy and sassing their parents and smart Alec and your kids are sassing you and get smarter like it's not going to do any good to beat the kids amen that was your choice amen you brought it that influence in your house and allowed that to influence your children and then you want to get mad at them for being influenced by what you allowed there comes time when we got to get real and we got to say listen now this is my fault amen but we're not going to do this anymore I'm telling you this is wrong but it's my fault not your fault but from here on we're not going this way anymore and if you choose to go that way from now on now you'll bear the consequences but there Comes A Time To be honest and say this is my fault amen it's not it's not everybody around I mean you can say why do they even allow programming like that how bad has the world got when you can't even watch a what nonsense it's our choice we I mentioned this I don't know remember which service one of the last couple Services where brother Ben says why is this Satan's Eden why has God allowed it he's allowed it to prove that she's not like Eve had free choice she made her choice amen we've got choice but by great God's grace we're going to make different choices we're going to stick with the word so there's no there's no law there's no somebody coming to question you or coming to your house for a house visit and sit down now brother sister have you done this this week or done that have you allowed this in your home and no we bear our own consequences for our own actions amen we don't have to serve God but we can if we want we don't have to choose the word but we can if we want but every choice has a consequence I want to look at a little story in the Bible just real First Kings 22. First Kings 22. and 41. and Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to Reign Over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel Jehoshaphat was 30 and 5 years old when he began to Reign and he reigned 20 and five years in Jerusalem and his mother's name was azubah the daughter of shilohai and he walked in all the ways of Asa his father he turned not aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord nevertheless the high places were not taken away for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places and Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel now we know the king of Israel at this time is Ahab so Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of uh Israel which is Ahab and he went up and he entered into a league with Ahab and brother Branham said says so one time Jehoshaphat which was a son of a righteous man and a righteous man himself he came down to see Ahab and there's where he made his fatal mistake see at this time the the kings of Judah were righteous Kings amen and the Kings of Israel were unrighteous there was a split between the 12 tribes ten made the Northern Kingdom of Israel two which was Judah and Benjamin they made the southern tribe of Judah Amen in in the southern tribe of Judah was still in the lineage of David right and so now there was a king over Israel and a king over Judah and now Jehoshaphat was a righteous King over Judah who was serving God but up in ahab's realm and in Israel Ahab had given over to his idolteress wife Jezebel and brought brought mixed religion in an idolatry in and this was a corrupt Nation now and so Jehoshaphat now made peace with Ahab and went into a league and brother Branham said that's where he made his fatal mistake he should have stayed separated it was a choice that Jehoshaphat made but that choice had long reaching circumstances repercussions he says again he says first name Jehoshaphat the righteous man came down to visit Ahab then he got himself in trouble you can't mix right and wrong together and get anything out of it you can't put oil in water it won't mix neither can your Associates and your Affiliates be with the things of the world and still live a Victorious Life the Bible said come out from among them and be separate saith the Lord we have to make choices the king made his choice and so he We Know by reading the scriptures there was several times that he was in ahab's company he would travel up to Israel and he would be in ahab's court right remember when Ahab asked him to go against Syria with him and and they called for all the prophets and they called for Micaiah I mean Jehoshaphat was there in the court he was spending time in ahab's home right and you can't spend time in somebody else's home without that influence coming into your home that's just good old common sense and let's go to Second Kings now chapter eight let's watch this as this progresses second Kings chapter eight verse 16. Second Kings 8 and 16. and in the fifth year of Jerome the son of Ahab king of Israel Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah Jehovah the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to Reign 30 and two years old was he when he began to Reign and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem and he walked in the way of the Kings of Israel now this is the son of Jehoshaphat King now of Judah the righteous Kingdom that served God but now he is walking in the way of Israel as did the house of Ahab for the daughter of Ahab was his wife and he did evil in the sight of the Lord it just took one generation his children he would go up up the ahab's place and go up to ahab's house and and who knows what the intermingling was and the children but somehow jehoshaphat's son was interested in ahab's daughter and now there was a marriage and that marriage began to be the corruption of Judah amen if Jehoshaphat would have stayed separate this would have never happened amen but he went and mingled with what he knew was unbelief what he knew was adultery he should have never went it sounds so nice he made peace it was the wrong kind of Peace because it brought him into compromise and it brought his children and his kingdom into compromise and now he marries his son to ahab's daughter and brother Branham says in the thytime church age now it said here that this had children now what were they they were daughters he's talking about the Catholic church and the Protestants for they were churches just like her now here is very interesting point Jezebel and Ahab had a daughter that daughter married jehovahum the son of Jehoshaphat and in Second Kings 8 16 it says Jehovah walked in the way of his father-in-law he went right into adultery by his marriage he brought God fearing and God worshiping Judah into idolatry that is exactly what all these daughter churches have done even as I've pointed out to you they started in the truth in Marion the organization and leave the word for tradition hey brother Ben points right to that story and shows what's happened in the church ages but Ahab and Jezebel had a daughter and that daughter married to Joshua because Jehoshaphat and they have became friends and that daughter married jehoshaphat's son and now that daughter was just like her mother she was raised in that environment and now brings that right down into Judah where did this start jehoshaphat's choice let's look at still in second Kings chapter eight let's turn to verse 25. and in the 12th year of Joe room the son of Ahab king of Israel did ahaziah the son of Jehovah king of Judah begin to Reign now Jehovah and the daughter of Ahab have a son and that son's name is ahaziah so his mother his grandmother is Jezebel his mother's the daughter of Jezebel he said 2 and 20 years old was a ASI when he began to Reign and he reigned over one year in Jerusalem and his mother's name was athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel earlier it said she was ahab's daughter Omri is ahab's Dad so they're they're under the dynasty of Omri amen just like all the kings were sons of David she was a daughter of Omri because he was the first king in this lineage but it was Ahab and Jezebel's daughter married to Jehovah produced ahaziah now I want to keep following the story because it's amazing amen let's hold your place in Second Kings but let's jump over to Second Chronicles second chronicles 22 and we're going to come right back to Second Kings second chronicles 22 and 3. second chronicles 22 verse 2. 40 and 2 years old was ahaziah when he began to Reign and he reigned one year in Jerusalem his mother's name also was athaliah the daughter of Omri he also walked in the ways of the House of Ahab for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly his mother was Jezebel's daughter and she became his counselor to do wickedly let's go back to Second Kings and go over to verse 11. Second Kings 11. Second Kings 11 and one this is a super interesting story but we're just pulling little pieces out says and when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the Royal seed all the seed Royal but jehoshaba the daughter of King joram sister of aiziah took joash the son of azai and stole him from among the king's Sons which were slain and they hid him even him and his nurse in the bed Chamber from athaliah so that he was not slain and he was with her hid in the house of the Lord six years and athlete did Reign Over All the land it is so amazing amen that that brother bam shows this so clearly I'm not going to read all the quotes but this is the Catholic Church having a daughter now the daughter amen brings the Protestants into denominationalism the same system as the mother amen the same system of idolatry brings it in and brings a corruption about and that's what aphaliah is doing at the death of aiziah now the woman is going to take the throne kill all the Royal seed what she's trying to do she's trying to stop all the elect in trying to stop all the word okay but there was something hid through six ages that was going to come out in the seventh age amen and the Word was going to be restored in the seventh age because Joe Joe Ash was going to become King when he was seven years old but oh what happened this is a type of the churches this is a demonstration of another cycle it's showing the fall the failure the choice the tying back in amen and showing the destruction of the elect it's showing everything I mean we're we're looking at absolutely the church ages here and what caused this to come in the scene a righteous man Mixed Company where he shouldn't have mixed company he made the wrong choice and the wrong choice had huge consequences because now Judah falls into idolatry and now what became the destruction of Israel and caused their dispersion now becomes the destruction of Judah and causes their dispersion what was it it was as simple as a choice a choice what caused the Fallen ruined nation of all Humanity a choice amen what caused every problem we've ever had was a choice is there our choice or somebody else's choice but it was a choice and the choices have affected us but oh how many good things have happened in the kingdom of God because of a choice if it's got the power for such destruction it's also got the power for such life amen if it's got the power to destroy and to tear down and ruin life it has the power to give life amen to bring a rebuild Amen to redeem it's got the same power amen I was also meditating on brother Brown's life story and I want to just bring some quotes from him he says he says uh in the message life story from 1951 he's talking about the conversation he had with his mother-in-law after he'd been to Mishawaka had the experience coming in to the Pentecostal people preaching there had a list of invites all over and during the conversation you say well I remember when we started off her mother said well hope she said you can go of course that's sin but I'm telling you I said if you do your mother will fill a grave with a broken heart oh my there it was and here's where I made my mistake friends this is the prophet of God The God Who stopped him from drinking and smoking didn't stop him from making this choice why because there was a lesson in it that was extremely valuable he said here's where I made my mistake friends I listened to my mother-in-law instead of listening to God and if I would have went ahead then this great thing would have been manifested before this and the church had been further along but listen to my mistakes here's where sorrow started skips down a little bit he says no I never forget trouble started my father took sick died on my arms just a little bit after that my brother was riding on the side of a car a 15 year old the man that he was hitchhiking and picked him up was drinking hit his head upside of a post broke his neck turned his liver over and he died in my other brother's arms and I was standing in the platform preaching when it happened they come and told me I tell you the way of a transgressor is hard don't you pay any attention to what anybody in the world tells you you do what God says no matter what you think about brother random said God why didn't you stop me you stopped me from drinking the drink you stopped me from smoking the cigarette you sit down the whoosh of the Whirlwind and and brought my mind back to the why amen but but there is such a lesson here and he's given the lesson out the way of a transgressor's heart only do that which God says no anybody else says he goes on he says he's talking about the flood now that came and he was out in his boat he was trying to pick people up and get him to safety and he was in a home where a woman was crying my baby my baby and he thought there was a baby there and the house began to break loose from the foundation and he runs back into his boat and he says I ran out real quick and jumped in the boat threw my hands down in the water and pulled the slip knot I sleeting cold the wind blowing blizzarding and I got into the boat I tried to pull the string on the starter I couldn't get it to start it and the current caught me this way and got me out onto Market Street sweating me out into the river there's the Ohio Falls crushing just below there the waves high as this building here romping like that with such a current and me standing in that boat pulling the string trying to get that motor to start and it wouldn't start seemed like I could hear somebody say now where's that bunch of trash at because that's what his mother-in-law called those people the Pentecostal people bunch of trash don't take my daughter amongst that trash I tell you brother the way of a transgressor's heart don't you let no one call you trash no I pulled that string and it wouldn't start and I said oh God I did that which is wrong this is somebody taking responsibility for their choice not saying God why didn't you stop me but God you know my mother-in-law was such a hard woman we would have had trouble it would you know how difficult it's not what he says now he takes responsibility for his choice he says God I did that which is wrong please I don't want to die out here in this River my baby and wife laying out there very sick please God don't let me die I was pulling that string and it wouldn't start and I turned around and the boat was half full of water almost then going on towards the Falls I knew just 10 minutes longer would be too much I pulled again I thought oh God forgive me for my sins and I pulled again and when I pulled that time the motor spluttered I pulled again and it started what did he have to do he had to come to terms with the consequences of his actions and he had to take responsibility for his actions and he had to own up to it and say Lord forgive me for my sins further down he talks about his wife passing away then and then he gets worried that his little daughter eight months old is laying in a hospital she got meningitis from her mother and he goes into Caesar and he said I've seen that little thing I knelt down on the floor and I said oh dear God I'm sorry that I did what I did I said you took my wife my darling away from me now you're taking my baby oh God please don't take my little girl I love her with all my heart I said I'll serve you I've done all I know to do except go when you told me two down there I said please don't take my baby that I love her oh no please tell me God I said take me instead of her as I raise my eyes look like a black sheep come unfolded I know she was going then I raised up and looked at her I said God bless you honey I said your daddy's darling I laid my hand over on her head and I said oh God said I don't know why you're tearing me up like this but I said still that doesn't change my faith in you said as job of old though you slay me yet I believe you with all my heart said I Trust You Lord said Sharon Rose God be with you honey in a few minutes the angels will come pack you little soul to mother and I will pick you up from here and lay you in mother's arms and bury you tomorrow said Lord I've done all I can it's now it's not my will now let thy will be done tell you what a horrible story but brother Branham told it as the consequences for his actions he was faced with the decision he could make a choice do what God told him to do or stay under the influence of his mother-in-law and he didn't want trouble so he listened to his mother-in-law and he says that's when my troubles began that's when sorrow started and all of these things he relates he ties it to that event amen and and brother branham's not blaming God he's not blaming his mother-in-law but he's recognizing I'm the one who did wrong I think it would be so much better for all of us if we stop blaming those around us it's just absolutely stop blaming everybody around us and start recognizing most of what I suffer with is my choices most of what I'm still struggling with and listen there's consequences there's things that you you and I and all of us here have done maybe decades ago and we're still suffering the consequences of those choices and we may still suffer in our minds or maybe in our bodies or maybe financially or physically in some way we may suffer the consequences for the rest of our life on this Earth and I'm telling you that's a good thing it may look like a bad thing but that's a good thing because it motivates us like never before to say God show me the right way that's the way I want to go show me your way that's the only thing I want because I'm still bearing consequences from my decisions amen from decades ago and it's motivating me not to ever do it again yesterday prophet of God says so we really believe that God never changes his mind about what he said he always keeps it true this is what brother brother Bam's going to say this and we're going to kind of balance things up here for a minute he says but he has a permissive will now there there's where the trouble Lays we try to work on God's permissive will and he will permit it but also if we take his permissive will though it's not right he will make his permissive will work out together to glorify his perfect will there is nothing will go wrong with God he knows just where the clock is a ticking at tonight there's nothing wrong every lick is hitting just exactly the way it should be everything we think it's wrong but he knows it's right it's supposed to be like this those scars that you got God knew about them you can listen you can you can take this two ways you can go an extreme one-way you can go an extreme the other way I've seen people so extreme in this that they're not even sorry for the wrongs anymore they say well that's what God wanted to happen I I mean I I I cheated and I lied and I stole from somebody and and then and I've got a erect life and a wrecked marriage and wrecked relationships all around me but that's what God wanted God knew from before the foundation world I'm a Child of God it's all working right on time listen brother Branham never took that attitude even though he knew that the permissive will will always work together for the perfect will of God and nothing will stop what God's going to do don't you ever stop being sorry for your sins and the consequences to other people I've heard people say that and it makes me sick to my stomach amen they will be caught in adultery they will be caught in pornography they'll be caught doing all this and later on they say well God knew it was going to happen anyways my goodness what are you saying it was your choice God never made you do it you did it of your own choosing amen and God and His Mercy because he chose you before the foundation of the world has a way in his grace to work it back into his perfect will but don't you dare take it flip it or lightly like it's a no thing that's still your choice you chose it you bear the consequences and your choice causes other people to bear the consequences and don't ever take it flip it like well God knew anyways God Must Have Known it's okay it's all working out for his good at the core that may be true but that's where the trouble Lays is what you took the permissive will of God and you need to own it we all need to own our decisions and our choices is this the way brother Brown's life had to go I believe that with all my heart I believe this is the way it had to go the circumstances though tragic as they were they needed to be that way did he need to grow up in a home of an alcoholic he needed to grow up in the home of an alcoholic although it left scars on him did he need to make the mistakes that he made I believe they all worked together for good but the prophet of God was willing to own his mistake and say I was wrong it's my fault and say that the whole church would be further down the road if I had chosen right correct Choice the first time look what he's doing he's taking the responsibility for the condition of the entire church at that time based off his decision don't go to an extreme in this and act like everything's fine in this life it's not fine in eternity everything's fine but in this life there are consequences for choices don't ever forget it and don't ever treat it lightly and don't ever speak like that to the people that you have damaged by your choices all you're going to do is ruin things and what you need to do is say it's my fault it's my fault friend it's my fault honey it's my fault children this is my fault and I'm sorry and I believe with all my heart God can even take this and make it work for good and something good could come out of it but it's my fault and I'm sorry for your suffering that's the way life is we are here in this Natural Life operating in a natural way for our education to learn about God to gain character for reigning so that we know more about God and how to live according to his word and while this life is structured this way we are all subject to the responsibility of free choice and we need to be real with it brother Branham says all the way in Christ is the mystery of God revealed 1963. this is many many years later after the loss of his wife and his daughter says now we come back here and to visit he's living in Tucson Arizona at the time he come back he said the climate in this place I certainly don't like because it just breaks me down as soon as I get here I can cross the top of the knobs up there and come down the valley and I'm here about 10 minutes and I get hives and get sick weather swimming head everything looks spooky dark and I just have to get out of it see and the other day I was talking to the wife but what brings me first what brings me here is you people see this church I tell you of all the places I ever went in my life this is my favorite place to come preach the gospel and it looks like that we can make a tape from here that's 10 times better than anywhere else that's the reason I say where God is doing something let's stay right with it now he's going to get back to a subject but I think where the great thing is that was me failing to go out at the first time when he called me and therefore he makes it kind of rough on me when I come in obedience is better than sacrifice here's the prophet of God still suffering a consequence of his actions from way more than a decade more than 15 years before he's still suffering the consequences and he's not angry or bitter he gets swimmy-headed breaks out in hives he has sinus he has all kinds of this stuff when he comes into that climate and he says I think the reason is because I failed to go out and he kind of makes it rough on me amen and here he is bearing a consequence when God could take it away is that right God wants him to come and preach in that place surely God will take it away no it's a tremendous reminder for the prophet to stand up and say obedience is better than you listen to me amen this is what I'm suffering with today because of what I did back then and I'm telling you obedience is better than sacrifice man we want God to take away all consequences for our actions we want brother Brown said we treat God like a Santa Claus come to him and we want something we need something we want him to but we still live in this life I thank God that someday will escape all of this and there'll be no memory no memory of the sin no memory of the failure no consequence no scars amen nothing debilitating in our minds or an emotional realm no no physical scars no limitations no Financial tragedies no family I'm so glad we're going to escape from this but until we escape from this we have to live with this reality and I said God help me to put your word first in everything it will work out amen it will not fail the day that Abraham gave the choice to lie it looked like lot got the better end of the deal but just wait a little while and you'll find out that lot got the worst end of the deal he had tragedy for the rest of his life and sorrow and suffering because of his choice to better himself and Abraham stayed in the Rocky ground and he got everything blessings and visitations and a promised son and everything that you could possibly get Abram God and he stayed separated from Sodom stayed in a what seemed like a worse condition but he stayed with the word and he got the better man make choices not for Prosperity take choices not for comfortable living make choices not for ease make choices for the word amen make choices for obedience it will always pay off you talk to the Saints who've been around for seven or eight decades they'll tell you that what I'm telling you is nothing but the truth they've had a they've had time in their life to see a few Cycles and after you've seen it a few times it's like watching the cycle through the judges amen they they would they'd have a judge raise a mom they would have a Revival and then before too long they would let the idolatry creep back in and lazy living and then another outside force would come and take them captive or put them under bondage they'd cry out to the Lord he would raise up another judge and here comes another cycle and it happens again in another cycle and another cycle and another cycle well you've been around for several decades you've seen enough Cycles to know that it will always cycle until I take the word and then get into a different cycle brother Brown said in the Hebrew series you know you say well we can't backslide absolutely and when you backslide you're going to get it don't you worry Abraham got it and the rest of them got it and you'll get it don't you think it gives you a right to sin it doesn't you pay for everything that you do you'll reap what you sow you do one little sin and you'll reap a whole Washed Up full that's right but brother that don't mean to say that you're lost it doesn't change anything in the economy of God about your sonship it doesn't change anything in God's purpose for your life but what a little change is the circumstances here in this dimension let's look at Galatians chapter 6 together I just want to read this and then one more scripture Galatians chapter 6. in verse 7. Galatians 6 and 7. be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth through his flesh all of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not this is a principle with God and it doesn't change giving your heart to the Lord doesn't change this principle believing the message being born again doesn't change this principle in life he goes on to say in the Hebrews series he says you'll make mistakes you'll fall you'll willfully do wrong you'll go out sometime and do things that don't mean that you're lost that means that you're going to get correction you can't be lost if you're a siegene of God you can never be separated from the love of God you can never be separated from the plan of God because you were in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world but he planted that seed in the part of the earth and made that part of the earth subject to the laws of the Earth what four for our learning let's learn remember brother Branham when he was in Africa he was told to stay in a certain city I believe it was Durban I don't remember Durbin they were going to move away but he was told to stay and they were putting all kinds of pressure on him all kinds of pressure we've already got lined up meetings we've got ministers we've got obligations they're trying to get him to move and he and even brother Bosworth and brother Baxter are against him amen trying to get him just to go along with the program and the only person who stood with him was Billy Paul dad just do what the answer of the Lord says but God wakes him up and tells him this is what he says he says he said go on said go on said they got you tied into it go on but remember you'll pay for it this is what God says to him go on they've got you tired I see you're in effects they've got you tied into it but remember you'll pay for it and he gave me some signs to know that this is what's going to happen and the signs all come to pass he says and he said by that you'll know that I give you permission to go but remember you'll suffer for it remember he took an amoeba and he got so sick that he thought he was going to die and he was sick for a long period of time and they couldn't do anything to help him he thought I was going to die and then God Amen miraculously healed him but God told him I'd give you permission to go you're tied into it but remember you're going to pay for it why because he already knew the perfect will of God and he wasn't able to resist what these ministers were doing and God was going to teach that Prophet a lesson that was going to come in handy later and benefit all of us [Music] thank you listen we've got consequences is there anybody in the room that doesn't have any consequences for any of your actions everything's been wonderful and you don't have any negative consequences I mean even if you're a four-year-old you've had a spanking by now so you've had negative consequences for your actions but you know what they're there some of them remain some of them we still have to deal with or suffer under but don't let them keep us from our purpose but let them push us into our purpose don't let the things I mean there are things that sometimes I'll have a flashback in my mind of the way I acted in the past things I've said and things I've done and when that mental image comes up I get a literal shiver down my spine at the shame and regret of things that I have done but I don't want that to keep me from my purpose or cause me to shut down or quit pursuing after the things have gone but I want the remembrance that still lingers three decades later I want the remembrance of that to push me to the will of God I mean to keep me in the word and keep me making the choosing the word above everything else above my feelings above pleasure above Easy Living above it all all I want is his will because his will always comes out right amen and here we come to the message birth pains birth pains and brother Branham takes out a little piece of paper and birth pains and he wants to read a message that was given in tongues and interpretations he was preaching and he spoke and uh Danny Henry ran up to him threw his arms around him and said if that wouldn't be sacrilegious that could be the 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelation and then he speaks in an unknown language what is known language he speaks in French and there's three people there that can translate amen and so they bring the translation and brother branham's going to read it there and he gets to this part of the note he said he said I would like to read this note this is the original note of one of them and it was from the man that hadn't that had interpreted I may not be able to call his name just right Victor Ledoux he is a full-blooded Frenchman now here's the message because thou has chosen the Narrow Path what is that that's a choice because thou has chosen a narrow path the harder way thou has walked of your own choosing God didn't make him God gave him the opportunity to choose and he choose he chose but listen that Prophet had chose wrong before and bore the consequences for the rest of his life amen he knew what it was to choose wrong and bear consequences but by the grace of God he also knew what it was to choose right and bear those consequences thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou has walked of your own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise decision God didn't pick it for him although it was God's perfect will and this Dimension he left it for him to make and he says you had made you have picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision oh this is going to bring you and I right into the picture because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision thou has made this in itself is that which will give and make come to pass the tremendous victory in love divine that's what we're living in that's what we're experiencing that's why we're benefactors up at one point the prophet of God could say my decision has held back the progress of the whole church but now in tongues and interpretation God is telling them your decision the correct decision the precious decision my way in itself amen this because of this momentous decision what decision the one the prophet made because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven A wasted what a glorious decision thou has made not not God's not saying not I forced you or I did this no he's saying you chose it and it was the right choice and it's a glorious decision this the decision the prophet made in itself is that which will give and may come to pass to tremendous Victory and love to find we now are bearing the consequences of the prophet's decision if it has the power for negative it has the power for good it has the power for death it has the power for life and I say God used my decisions for the power of life let my choices bring life let my choices open up a greater way let my choices bring deliverance and healing and all kinds of things let my choices be your choices let my choice be the correct and precise way man oh God help us to stay in the word help us to stay in prayer help us to stay sensitive to the leading of the holy spirit so that we are not flipping about life that we're not bulldozing our way through but we're actually patient and saying God I need to make the right decision I want to know what is your word and your will cause that's my decision is going to be it doesn't always work out perfect we don't always get messages from heaven we don't always get a perfect answer sometimes we just have to make the decision we feel is best and even then sometimes we'll learn it's wrong and there'll be consequences for that but oh it all works together for good friends it's all there for our training to teach us that we have to have the word or nothing else and his way is the only way now we can we can hate the power of free choice or we can grab a hold of it with all of its responsibilities and say I've experienced the power of a wrong decision and it's powerful some of you have made some seriously wrong decisions I've made some seriously wrong decisions that we're still living with yes but the power of a decision can be in the right way can be just as powerful and not just for decades but for eternity [Music] there's a responsibility that comes with free choice let's not take that responsibility lightly look at one more scripture in Revelation chapter 19 and then we'll end here Revelation Chapter 19 Verse 7. Revelation 19 and 7. let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready what is that a choice a choice that the bride has she gets to make a choice like Esther got to make a choice of what she'll take in to meet the king this bride has a choice and it's been given to her the garment's been presented the wedding garment has been given amen the prophet was here to dress Amen to the bride and the clothing of the word amen but this bride has a choice to make herself ready now somebody else made her ready but she's got to take that word and put it on she's got to come in line with God's will God's desire God's word for this age and this bride this wife had the what's rejoicing all of Heaven is rejoicing why are they rejoicing because this bride has made herself ready we have a choice friends I want to choose the word man let's all Stand Together musicians if you'll come and brother Blake if you'll come this is bow our heads and pray dear Lord Jesus I thank you for your word God you're so merciful to us that we have come down to this end time lord and you have opened the seals you've revealed the Mysteries you've explained the church ages we know the dispensations of the past what you were doing in Moses's day what you were doing in Jeremiah's day what you were doing through the judges what you've done through seven Church ages and you've opened it all up for us to learn and to benefit Lord you showed us our position you showed us how Eternal our position is how secure it is but you've also showed us through a prophet how life works and what we need to do in this life to be pleasing to you God I pray that you'd help us help each one of us help me God help me to surrender my life fresh again and help me Lord to use this this power of Free Will and free choice that you've given to me help me to use it to choose your will God continue to reveal your will to us show us your word continually unveil yourself so that we know which way to walk in and help us Lord to make the precise incorrect decision help us to of our own will of our own choosing of our own desire choose the precise the correct way which is your way show it to us Lord show it to us Lord give us more of your spirit to help us overcome The Temptations of this world and help us to choose your way that's our desires to choose your way and God let the consequences of those decisions bring in a full effect in our lives and in the lives of those that are around us we love you God we ask that you would bless us help us as we go from here help us to understand who we are the age that we're living in and the environment we're in the purpose by which we're in that environment how it works and operates and how we can operate with that so that you can get the greatest benefit Lord have your way in us oh God help us to stay consecrated and separated unto you may you get Glory out of our Lives as our desire is Lord have your way with us we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] ER you are the heart I am the place [Applause] [Music] and me this is what I pray change my heart oh [Music] God make it ever Church change my heart oh God may I be like you you are the Potter y [Music] [Applause] holy holy this is what I pray I pray make it ever true change my heart oh God may I be like you one more time so change my heart make it ever truth change my heart oh God [Music] and here I am in Lord here I am I give all myself to thee the Lord he here [Music] here I am alone here I [Music] had your spirit [Music] here [Music] I am here I am I give all myself [Music] you're right [Music] [Applause] [Music] Here I Am Lord [Music] here I am here I am taking your Fearless [Music] one more time here I am Here I Am Lord here I am I am here I am [Music] myself to the Lord here I am [Music] Here I Am Lord here I am let your spirit move through me Lord hear rise one to do thy will O Lord [Music] I will oh Lord so take me break me [Music] one two thy will [Music] want to do and I will [Applause] I want to do thy I will oh Lord so take me break between [Music] [Applause] what I want to do I want to do thy will hold [Music] I want to do I will oh Lord so take me break me [Music] once more oh I want to do thy will O Lord I want to do thy will O Lord so take me [Music] home [Music] more of you [Music] more of you I've had it all but what I need just [Music] [Music] [Applause] the empty and bear Lord hear my prayer more of you more of you more [Music] of you I'm heading on all but what I am just for ever of things I've had I feel yeah [Music] empty and bear Lord hear my prayers [Music] only here [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] holy Only You Lord oh Lord [Music] only [Music] you're the fan mountains that I that I run [Music] Only You Lord [Music]
