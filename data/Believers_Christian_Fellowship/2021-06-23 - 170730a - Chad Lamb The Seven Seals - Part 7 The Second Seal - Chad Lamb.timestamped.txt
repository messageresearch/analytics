[0:25] back and
[0:26] see what god's going to do again what
[0:28] he's going to say because his word
[0:30] means everything to us this is more than
[0:31] life when this natural life is going
[0:33] it's this word that's going to raise it
[0:35] up again amen
[0:37] it's this word that has prepared a place
[0:38] for me to go when i leave this body
[0:40] there's a home for me to go to amen
[0:43] and in this life i'm just reflecting
[0:45] that life and
[0:46] it's all based on the word amen it's not
[0:48] based on our thoughts it's not based on
[0:50] our experiences
[0:51] it's not based on how we feel about it
[0:53] it's based on the word
[0:55] and that's what we want praise the lord
[0:58] we want to just greet our visitors

[1:30] things happening it's just fun to

[1:38] baptized after surface today so god
[1:40] bless you
[1:41] we'll be happy to do that at the end of
[1:43] the service so let's take our bibles and
[1:45] turn to the book of revelations
[1:47] we're going to continue on in the seals
[1:58] revelations chapter 6
[2:06] praise the lord revelation chapter 6 and
[2:10] verse 1
[2:11] and i saw when the lamb opened one of
[2:13] the seals and i heard as it were the
[2:15] noise of thunder
[2:16] and one of the four beasts saying come
[2:17] and see and i saw and behold a white
[2:20] horse and he that sat on him
[2:22] had a bow and a crown was given unto him
[2:24] and he went forth conquering
[2:26] and to conquer and when he had opened
[2:29] the second seal i heard the second beast
[2:31] say come and see
[2:32] and there went on another horse that was
[2:34] red and power was given to him
[2:36] that sat there on to take peace from the
[2:38] earth that they should kill one another
[2:41] and there was given unto him a great
[2:43] sword
[2:44] just bow our heads dear heavenly father
[2:47] we ask that you would come and that you
[2:48] would just
[2:49] minister lord your word unto us god i
[2:52] pray lord as we just sacrifice ourselves
[2:55] right now and lay ourselves down on your
[2:57] altar
[2:57] we pray that you would come and take
[2:59] these vessels of kalelo and you would
[3:00] anoint us
[3:02] you would anoint these lips to speak and
[3:03] you anoint all of our ears to hear
[3:05] lord and we might receive what you have
[3:07] for us in this hour
[3:09] we love you lord and we ask that you
[3:10] would just give us of your spirit to
[3:12] receive your word
[3:13] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[3:17] you can be seated
[3:22] praise the lord we're going to continue
[3:24] on with the second seal
[3:25] and just see where we get i'm going to
[3:28] read a couple passages out of the seal
[3:29] book if you brought your seal book you
[3:31] can turn to that
[3:32] i'm going to be reading there's just a
[3:33] few things i think it's neat to read out
[3:35] of
[3:35] your own seal book so we'll open that up
[3:38] to the second seal
[3:39] and then in the in the book i have it's
[3:42] page 159
[3:43] it's at the beginning of the second seal
[3:47] we're going to be in the third paragraph
[3:49] and i think
[3:55] i think actually i'm going to jump over
[3:57] i'm sorry
[3:59] to the third seal if you'll turn to the
[4:01] third seal with me
[4:03] i want to read something else first
[4:06] third seal in my book it is page 207.
[4:14] i'm sorry 206. paragraph 14.
[4:19] brother ben was talking about preaching
[4:20] this seal and he says
[4:22] on page 206 paragraph 14 sometimes when
[4:26] we just read and now be real careful
[4:29] and when you read get the tapes listen
[4:31] to them real close
[4:34] so brother branham's not wanting us to
[4:35] take a casual glance at these seals
[4:38] but he's telling us to read it and get
[4:40] the tape and read it real
[4:42] close why because there's so much more
[4:46] here
[4:47] than just the history of the church ages
[4:49] there's more happening in the seals
[4:52] than just an explanation of what's went
[4:54] wrong over seven church ages
[4:56] and how the antichrist moved he's
[4:57] telling us a whole lot more in these
[4:59] seals
[5:00] and he's constantly trying to get the
[5:01] people to see something else he's
[5:03] constantly saying if you read through
[5:04] your seals
[5:05] i hope you're catching it now i hope
[5:07] you're seeing this
[5:08] i'm just testing to see if you'll get it
[5:10] on your own now amen
[5:12] read your seal book and see brother
[5:13] branham's wanting the church to catch
[5:15] revelation
[5:16] amen so let's go back to the second seal
[5:20] page 159 paragraph 3
[5:24] and we'll read this together it says
[5:28] it is now we pray father that you will
[5:31] come tonight and will break the second
[5:33] seal for us
[5:34] and as the poet has said he would like
[5:36] to look a past the curtain
[5:38] of time and that's our desire lord is
[5:40] just just to look a past
[5:42] and see what lays ahead
[5:46] so here brother branham's asking him to
[5:48] break the second seal
[5:49] in the second seal when he begins to
[5:52] explain it
[5:53] is all about the persecution of the
[5:55] early church and how they laid down
[5:57] their lives
[5:58] and how the red horse was rioting as the
[6:00] catholic church got power
[6:02] and they began to kill and martyr the
[6:03] saints and that's all past
[6:07] but here in his opening prayer he's
[6:09] saying lord
[6:10] open this second seal so we can see what
[6:13] lays ahead
[6:16] see why you have to read real
[6:19] because if you don't really read real
[6:21] careful you think that brother branham
[6:23] and breaking the second seal
[6:24] is explaining church history but he's
[6:27] not explaining church history
[6:29] he's showing church history so that we
[6:30] can see something that lays ahead
[6:34] hallelujah just look past and see what
[6:37] lays ahead
[6:39] and we pray that the lamb that had been
[6:41] slain will come among us now and break
[6:43] the seal
[6:44] and reveal it to us the things we have
[6:47] need
[6:48] to see now
[6:51] you realize why you have to read
[6:54] real careful because he's not telling us
[6:57] this breaking of the seal is not telling
[6:59] us the history
[7:00] the breaking of the seal will tell us to
[7:03] see what lays
[7:05] ahead hallelujah
[7:10] now let's go to paragraph 18. let's
[7:15] turn to my book page 161.
[7:26] paragraph 18 page 161 and now we're
[7:29] trusting now that the lord will bless us
[7:30] in our efforts tonight the first seal i
[7:32] certainly enjoyed that
[7:34] the first seal the blessing that went
[7:35] with it to me and now i don't want to
[7:37] keep you too long but you see
[7:39] i'll be going now just again in a few
[7:41] nights and after this is over
[7:43] and we have to just kind of suffer a
[7:46] little while
[7:48] that's the second seal we just kind of
[7:52] have to suffer
[7:53] a little while and we'll get into that
[7:56] more and you'll see but that
[7:58] is the second seal let's keep going and
[8:02] we'll see
[8:03] let's go through our powerpoint we'll
[8:04] back up just a little bit
[8:07] so we not we find out now that we're
[8:09] we're talking about this
[8:11] seals this this seven sealed book of
[8:14] redemption this entire bible
[8:16] that's been sealed up with seven seals
[8:18] and there's going to come a time
[8:20] in the transition of of of
[8:23] redemption when this book is not going
[8:25] to be sealed anymore
[8:27] this book is not going to be in the hand
[8:29] of the original uh
[8:30] the one who gave it the original owner
[8:31] anymore but now something has to
[8:34] transition it's got to move from one
[8:35] hand to the other
[8:36] it's got to move from the great eternal
[8:38] spirit god it's got to move to the man
[8:40] christ jesus amen the one who came
[8:44] as christ as god made himself a body and
[8:46] stepped into that
[8:47] and made his own blood and he shed that
[8:49] blood for the price of redemption and
[8:51] now he's come back
[8:52] to take redemption claims back to man
[8:55] and when he does he's going to open the
[8:56] book and show the mysteries of
[8:58] redemption
[8:59] what's been happening what's happening
[9:01] now and what's going to happen in the
[9:02] future
[9:03] and so so he has to open these seals
[9:06] because these seals have everything to
[9:08] do with redemption brother branham told
[9:10] us
[9:11] many times he says now several times in
[9:13] the seals he says now go look back at
[9:15] jeremiah
[9:16] go back and look at jeremiah now in
[9:18] jeremiah
[9:19] there was there was an open scroll and a
[9:22] sealed scroll
[9:23] and what jeremiah had done is he went
[9:25] and he redeemed a piece of land
[9:27] because they were going to go into
[9:29] babylonian captivity
[9:30] which is a type of the church going into
[9:33] the captivity of babylon which is the
[9:35] catholic system
[9:37] and before they go into babylon what he
[9:39] does is he buys a piece of land
[9:42] because you have to understand that the
[9:44] jews their inheritance was a physical
[9:46] piece of property land
[9:47] but for us our inheritance is the word
[9:51] and so he has to pay a redemption price
[9:54] amen for the inheritance pay a
[9:57] redemption price for the land and when
[9:59] he would pay that redemption price
[10:01] it was recorded that the price was paid
[10:04] and that
[10:04] now there's going to be those that come
[10:07] behind
[10:07] jeremiah and those that come behind him
[10:10] when they come
[10:10] out of babylonian captivity are going to
[10:13] have a right to what's been paid for
[10:16] but but they have to record it and they
[10:19] record it in an open document
[10:21] and they record it in a sealed document
[10:23] and then and they put it in an earthen
[10:25] vessel and they store it up
[10:26] so that when they come out of babylonian
[10:28] captivity when the captivity is ended
[10:30] and the restoration comes
[10:32] now those who have rights to that
[10:34] portion
[10:35] of the land those that have rights to
[10:37] the word they're going to come back and
[10:40] peel open the seal and read the document
[10:42] and compare the open
[10:44] with the clothes and they'll dovetail
[10:46] together and when they dovetail together
[10:48] then you know that it's time for the
[10:50] land to go back to the rightful
[10:52] air and when they open the seals and
[10:55] we've seen
[10:56] we've seen the symbol form of the seals
[10:58] in the open book and then we see the
[11:00] thunders that are the closed seals and
[11:02] at the sounding of the seven thunders
[11:04] when that's taken away
[11:05] there's a comparison made the bible
[11:07] dovetails together
[11:08] and we find out that we have the right
[11:10] of inheritance
[11:12] amen that we're going to the inheritance
[11:14] that the word belongs to us that we're
[11:16] part of the word we were always part of
[11:18] the word the word is for us the word
[11:19] belongs to us and will never be
[11:21] separated from the word
[11:22] because there's been a price that was
[11:24] paid
[11:25] now remember jeremiah paid the price
[11:27] long before they returned out of
[11:29] babylonian captivity
[11:30] jesus christ paid the price long before
[11:32] we returned out of babylonian captivity
[11:35] but we become out of babylonian
[11:37] captivity and now we're standing here
[11:39] the seals are open he's sitting on the
[11:41] throne he's holding the open book amen
[11:46] and he's come to tell us that we're the
[11:48] heirs
[11:50] joint heirs with christ
[11:53] these seals are exciting friends
[11:56] they're not in doubt anymore we're not
[11:58] in question who gets the inheritance
[12:00] who's the inheritance for
[12:02] is it for muslims is it for baptist is
[12:04] it for presbyterian
[12:05] no it's not for any of those it's for
[12:07] the children of god those that will wear
[12:09] no title
[12:10] amen those that will pin no badge on but
[12:12] those that will come right back to the
[12:14] original word
[12:15] those are the ones who are eligible for
[12:17] inheritance because they are the
[12:18] original word
[12:19] coming back to the original world
[12:21] signifying that they have the right of
[12:23] inheritance
[12:25] that's why the original word that's why
[12:27] the seals had been broke off
[12:28] the mysteries have to be revealed so
[12:30] that the original word can be laid out
[12:32] because only those who are part of the
[12:34] word can come to the word
[12:38] this is the test here's my word can you
[12:40] receive it
[12:41] and when you can receive it by faith it
[12:43] indicates that you are
[12:45] part of the word coming to the original
[12:47] word meaning you've come from the same
[12:49] source this word come from
[12:52] when you can believe every word that's
[12:54] written in this book it indicates that
[12:55] you came from the same place this book
[12:57] came from
[12:59] but when you reject what's written in
[13:00] this and you reject the prophet of the
[13:02] hour reject the message that he gave
[13:04] through vindication
[13:05] you have rejected it shows that you do
[13:07] not have rights to inheritance
[13:09] because the book of redemption when it
[13:11] peels open reveals all the mysteries of
[13:13] the bible and shows us
[13:15] this is the truth the seed of god says i
[13:17] believe that
[13:20] the non-seed said no that's not it then
[13:23] they don't have rights of inheritance
[13:26] why he came to show your name in the
[13:28] book
[13:30] how do you see your name he reveals the
[13:32] mystery that's what's calling
[13:34] your name what's he calling he's not
[13:36] calling
[13:37] chad and bob and larry and susie he's
[13:39] not calling that
[13:40] what's he calling he's calling for the
[13:42] original word
[13:43] he's calling for the word that's in you
[13:45] and the only thing that will call your
[13:47] name
[13:47] which is christ will be christ
[13:50] because the whole family in heaven and
[13:52] earth is named jesus christ
[13:54] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[13:56] amen it's christ
[13:57] being revealed the word being made
[13:59] manifest and when the word is
[14:01] unlocked it will only call the word
[14:06] that's why denominations will reject it
[14:08] that's why in this hour it's been so
[14:09] rejected
[14:10] it's not rejected by the word it's
[14:13] rejected by the false vine
[14:16] hallelujah
[14:20] so this these seals are everything to us
[14:25] it's showing us so much more than church
[14:29] history
[14:32] souls that are in prison now we've read
[14:33] this many times but we're going to keep
[14:35] laying it out so we see this
[14:37] the mystery was in the seven seals when
[14:39] these seven seals was opened that opened
[14:41] up the entire
[14:42] bible that means it cannot
[14:46] relate only to the new testament church
[14:50] these seals cannot only pertain to the
[14:52] new testament church
[14:53] to the seven church ages if it opened up
[14:56] the entire bible
[14:57] the seven seals it was sealed with seven
[14:59] mysteries and then these seven seals
[15:01] held the entire
[15:02] mystery of it and so now
[15:06] the veil has been taken away and now by
[15:10] the revealing of the word
[15:11] he's calling all he's calling his bride
[15:14] to come stand by his side the king
[15:17] theophany has come down the mighty angel
[15:19] has come down
[15:20] in the full revelation of his full word
[15:22] with full power to back it up and what's
[15:24] he doing by revealing the mysteries he's
[15:27] calling for his bride to come stand by
[15:29] his side
[15:31] and there's those that are saying that
[15:33] ain't nothing but the truth
[15:35] hallelujah now remember it's one of my
[15:40] favorite quotes now
[15:42] out of the church age books now remember
[15:44] this christ in the true church is a
[15:45] continuation of the book of acts
[15:48] but the book of revelation shows how the
[15:50] antichrist spirit would come into the
[15:51] church and defile it
[15:53] making it lukewarm formal powerless it
[15:56] exposes satan
[15:57] revealing his works attempted
[16:00] destruction of god's people
[16:01] and the discrediting of god's word now
[16:04] you can
[16:05] we we've mentioned this but i just want
[16:07] to lay this down so this doesn't leave
[16:08] us this is
[16:09] important to catch satan is not working
[16:12] in the bar room the house of
[16:13] prostitution the drug house
[16:14] he's not working there that's where
[16:17] people in a hybrid condition without the
[16:19] word of god go
[16:20] on their own right you move away from
[16:24] god it'll be amazing how fast your life
[16:26] will deteriorate
[16:28] you leave this word you leave this
[16:30] spiritual anointing that goes with the
[16:32] word
[16:32] then your life will spiral downhill you
[16:35] leave the message
[16:36] and you go out you're going to wind up
[16:37] with tattoos and shaved heads and
[16:39] piercings and marriage and divorce and
[16:41] adultery and
[16:42] everything else because you cannot
[16:44] sustain without the anointing that comes
[16:46] with the revealed word
[16:49] so so so devil's not he's not
[16:52] he's not out there in all of those
[16:55] things because his
[16:56] main work his works what he's doing has
[16:59] been
[16:59] has been unlocked or unveiled by the
[17:01] book of revelation
[17:03] and what is he trying to do he's trying
[17:05] to destroy god's people
[17:07] and discredit god's word that's the only
[17:09] thing he's doing he's not doing anything
[17:11] else
[17:12] that's his main objective so if he's
[17:15] trying to destroy
[17:16] god's people and discredit god's word
[17:19] where
[17:20] is he working in the bar room
[17:23] and the sports club and the where is he
[17:26] working he's trying to work in you and
[17:28] me
[17:29] he's trying to work right here right in
[17:31] our midst he's trying to come across
[17:33] and he's trying to bring deception and
[17:36] move us away
[17:37] but the book of revelation reveals his
[17:40] whole scheme
[17:41] reveals his whole plan amen
[17:46] so this this book of revelation shows
[17:50] how the antichrist spirit would come
[17:52] into the church and defile it
[17:55] make it lukewarm formal and powerless
[18:00] see when he begins to work in and he
[18:02] begins to come
[18:03] in he always comes in as the white horse
[18:05] you'll remember and the white horse is
[18:07] innocent harmless looks good he has to
[18:10] mimic christ so it looks like it's okay
[18:13] amen and it's it's it's got really no
[18:16] authority over your life it doesn't have
[18:18] a crown
[18:18] amen he's got a bow but no arrow so he
[18:21] really can't hurt you
[18:22] so it looks harmless and when he comes
[18:24] in harmless
[18:25] his whole objective is to change horses
[18:29] he does not want to ride the white horse
[18:31] all of your life
[18:32] that's not what he came in for he didn't
[18:34] want to ride the white horse all the way
[18:35] through the last 2
[18:36] 000 years his objective has always been
[18:38] to get on the pale horse
[18:40] which is which is death which is
[18:42] spiritual death eternal separation from
[18:44] god
[18:45] that's his plan it always has been his
[18:47] plan but he doesn't show up with
[18:49] spiritual death
[18:50] he shows up with compromise
[18:53] he shows up with slight deviation from
[18:56] the original word
[18:57] he shows up with reasoning against the
[18:59] word of god
[19:00] and that's how he slips in and when he
[19:01] does he defiles the church
[19:04] and when he defiles the church he makes
[19:06] it formal
[19:08] lukewarm and powerless
[19:12] god hates a powerless church
[19:16] amen so what will
[19:19] what will give the church power
[19:21] obedience to the original word
[19:24] the life that comes with the word will
[19:26] give the church power
[19:27] the life the fire of god the holy ghost
[19:31] that comes with the revealed of the
[19:33] revealing of the word
[19:34] and the revealed word of the hour will
[19:36] keep you keep it from getting cold
[19:38] because you'll have the fire of god
[19:40] keep it from getting formal because
[19:41] you're not your own you're not in
[19:43] control
[19:43] god's he's running the ship he's behind
[19:45] the steering wheel
[19:46] keeps you from becoming formal and keeps
[19:48] you becoming powerless because you have
[19:50] the power of the word
[19:54] but it exposes satan this book of
[19:56] revelation
[19:58] revealing his works the attempted
[20:00] destruction of god's people
[20:02] and the discrediting of god's word
[20:05] right down to the time he is cast into
[20:07] the lake of fire he fights that he
[20:08] cannot stand it
[20:10] he knows that if the people get the true
[20:11] revelation of the true church and what
[20:13] she is
[20:14] what she stands for and that she can do
[20:16] the greater works
[20:18] she will be an invincible army
[20:21] so in order to be an invincible army you
[20:23] have to see the two spirits
[20:26] and that's what the book of revelation
[20:28] came to expose
[20:29] was the two spirits that's what the
[20:31] revelation of the seven seals does
[20:33] is exposes the two spirits and in order
[20:36] to be an invincible army you have to
[20:38] recognize the two spirits
[20:42] hallelujah this is going to get right
[20:44] down to home
[20:46] it's going to come right right down to
[20:48] sit in your seat with you
[20:53] that he fights that he can't stand it he
[20:56] knows that if the people get the true
[20:57] revelation of the true church and what
[20:59] she is
[21:00] what she stands for and what she can do
[21:02] the greater works
[21:03] she will be an invincible army if they
[21:05] get a true revelation of the two spirits
[21:07] within the framework of the christian
[21:09] church and by god's spirit
[21:10] discern and withstand the antichrist
[21:12] spirit satan
[21:14] will be powerless before her
[21:17] so if you haven't seen the antichrist
[21:19] spirit fully exposed
[21:21] how are you going to resist the
[21:23] antichrist spirit but the seals
[21:25] fully expose the antichrist spirit and
[21:27] then when
[21:28] when you see his deception and you don't
[21:30] fall for his deception
[21:32] and you find out how christ comes
[21:34] raising a standard against
[21:36] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[21:37] that god will raise a standard against
[21:39] it and you find that in the four living
[21:41] creatures
[21:41] now you find what the defense tactic is
[21:44] or how to combat that
[21:45] antichrist spirit and as soon as you go
[21:48] right to the scriptural way of doing
[21:49] this
[21:50] you have overcoming power he is now
[21:52] powerless over you
[21:53] when he is exposed he is powerless over
[21:56] you it's like somebody has a cunning
[21:58] scheme that's going through the
[21:59] neighborhood
[21:59] and a little kid is knocking on the door
[22:01] and he's a poor little ragged kid with a
[22:03] little jar
[22:04] and he says i'm trying to raise money
[22:06] for orphans i'm an orphan down here
[22:08] and i need some money would you give me
[22:09] some money oh my goodness what deception
[22:12] you're like oh cute little kid poor
[22:13] hungry thing and you're dropping coins
[22:15] in this thing
[22:16] but then your neighbor comes along and
[22:18] then he tells you hey
[22:20] is the kid coming to your door knocking
[22:22] your door asking for money
[22:23] don't give him any money his dad's one
[22:25] of the richest men in town
[22:26] and he sends his kids out collecting
[22:28] money
[22:30] now when you know the scheme he's
[22:33] powerless over you
[22:36] when he's been exposed it's simple it's
[22:38] so simple once he's been exposed
[22:40] he's like no i'm sorry i'm not going to
[22:41] do that
[22:43] well you reason the word no i'm sorry
[22:44] because that's how you always start
[22:47] will you compromise just a little bit no
[22:49] no no no because compromise leads to
[22:51] spiritual death eternal separation from
[22:53] god
[22:55] i'm not going to compromise the word i'm
[22:56] not going to deny the word i'm not going
[22:57] to deny what the prophet taught us
[23:00] why because i will not compromise on the
[23:02] word
[23:04] hallelujah satan will be powerless
[23:07] before
[23:08] her he will be as definitely thwarted
[23:09] today as when christ was stood as every
[23:11] effort to gain power over him in the
[23:13] desert
[23:14] how did christ withstand his every
[23:15] effort with it
[23:17] is written
[23:20] not not ideas not concepts not self-help
[23:23] amen not group therapy not support
[23:26] systems not
[23:27] any of those things it is written that's
[23:30] how he defeated the devil that's how we
[23:32] defeat the devil
[23:33] we don't need a buddy system to overcome
[23:35] the enemy we need the word of god
[23:38] hallelujah
[23:42] yes satan hates revelation but we love
[23:45] it
[23:47] with true revelation in our lives the
[23:49] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[23:51] but we will prevail over them
[23:54] so we see that there's two vines there's
[23:57] two vines and only two vines
[23:59] there's two spirits and only two spirits
[24:03] brother branham says in this message
[24:08] it's pretty amazing he says in victory
[24:11] day
[24:12] it never gives the inward man a chance
[24:14] to operate
[24:15] we are trying being soul body and spirit
[24:18] but when the natural mind the two spirit
[24:20] spiritual forces that works in you is
[24:23] your mind and your spirit
[24:25] now the macro mind that's highly
[24:27] polished will try to achieve something
[24:29] by his intelligence
[24:31] and when he does that the very thing
[24:34] when he does that he throws himself away
[24:36] from the spiritual man that's in him
[24:38] and there what causes the trouble right
[24:40] there see he tries to make it out
[24:44] himself so we find out
[24:48] that these two vines are in the
[24:51] christian church
[24:52] they are in the true church because
[24:54] they're in you
[24:58] there's two vines in you
[25:02] there's the inner man and the outer man
[25:06] right second corinthians 4 16 says for
[25:09] which cause we faint not but though our
[25:11] outward man perish
[25:13] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[25:16] and paul says i love the law and the
[25:20] inward man.
[25:21] so he's talking about a difference
[25:22] between the inward man
[25:24] amen that which has been born again and
[25:26] the outward man which is your old carnal
[25:29] nature your old self
[25:30] amen that's fallen in a hybrid condition
[25:33] will never be right till it's made over
[25:35] again and what is he showing is there's
[25:37] two vines
[25:38] brother banner said these two vines are
[25:40] intertwined
[25:43] where are they intertwined in you
[25:49] you have to see the deception and
[25:52] trickery of the
[25:53] false vine the antichrist and resist him
[25:58] he's not trying to work out there he's
[26:01] not
[26:02] trying to bring you deception through
[26:05] the pentecostal
[26:06] denomination
[26:09] because the pentecostal denomination
[26:11] won't bring you deception
[26:14] you're not going to be deceived by that
[26:16] but you're going to be
[26:17] it's got to be so close that it could
[26:19] deceive the very elect
[26:21] if possible that's how close it has to
[26:24] be
[26:24] so this starts hitting pretty close to
[26:26] home
[26:28] brother branham says in the interval and
[26:30] man never knows what it is to live a
[26:32] victorious life until he completely
[26:34] overcome who who does he completely
[26:38] overcome
[26:39] himself that's the biggest enemy you god
[26:43] is yourself
[26:44] that's the reason you can't rise up in
[26:46] faith because you got intellectuals
[26:47] there
[26:48] your intellectual part says well this
[26:50] and or that or it's reasoning
[26:53] we want to cast down reasoning the bible
[26:55] tells us
[26:56] there's two parts of you two faculties
[27:00] you know when somebody starts to tell
[27:02] you that what you believe isn't
[27:03] reasonable
[27:04] you should shout and say hallelujah i
[27:07] don't want
[27:07] reasonable faith because that's
[27:09] intellectual faith and that will never
[27:10] produce the word of god
[27:12] that's why a seminary has never been
[27:14] able to produce anything
[27:16] but a cold formal powerless church
[27:19] because by intellectual understanding
[27:21] and reasoning and
[27:22] figuring out the word and reasoning out
[27:25] and trying to uh
[27:26] place it and make it work in our modern
[27:29] society and our modern culture
[27:30] will always lead to spiritual death
[27:34] but it's your intellectual part that
[27:36] you're fighting
[27:38] it's your intellectual part it's the
[27:40] intellectual part
[27:41] that that got even trouble
[27:44] it was the intellectual part that the
[27:46] serpent came to and began to reason with
[27:49] her
[27:49] and begin to show her he being ashore
[27:52] that it's beautiful and
[27:53] and it's good to make one wise and and
[27:55] there's nothing wrong with this
[27:57] and there's a better way and you'll know
[27:59] a little bit more and what's wrong with
[28:01] knowing a little bit more
[28:04] oh my goodness that's your enemy
[28:07] you have to completely overcome who
[28:10] yourself hallelujah
[28:17] amen brother branham says in the
[28:20] resurrection of lazarus abel led his
[28:22] lamb away
[28:25] by a grapevine sacrificed him on the
[28:27] altar and abel died
[28:29] on the same altar his sacrifice lamb
[28:31] died
[28:32] and every believer that comes to christ
[28:34] must die on the same altar with his
[28:37] dying lamb
[28:39] christ and die in christ to be a new
[28:41] creature
[28:42] die out to the things of the world
[28:44] become born again a new creature in
[28:46] christ jesus died on the same altar of
[28:49] self-sacrifice
[28:53] you must be born again in 1961 like cain
[28:56] when he slew abel abel died on the altar
[28:59] with his sacrifice
[29:01] after abel offered his sacrifice and
[29:03] killed a sacrifice for his sin
[29:04] then he died on the same altar with his
[29:06] sacrifice in order to be born again you
[29:09] have to die
[29:10] on the altar with your sacrifice just as
[29:13] dead as he was and you're born again
[29:16] now remember jesus didn't die on calvary
[29:21] jesus died in gethsemane
[29:24] amen and we have to come to gethsemane
[29:26] amen
[29:28] praise the lord you have to die to
[29:31] self-will
[29:32] die to self-preservation die to your own
[29:34] ideas die to your own feelings
[29:36] and that's what jesus was doing he was
[29:38] completely dying out in gethsemane
[29:41] he was asking lord if this cup could
[29:44] pass me amen that was a man with
[29:46] intellectuals
[29:47] asking the lord if there's no other way
[29:49] but when the lord would give no other
[29:51] way
[29:51] there was a faith in the man a true seed
[29:54] of god a true
[29:55] god himself in flesh was saying amen
[29:58] amen be it unto me according to thy word
[30:02] let it be but but you see now you see
[30:05] now
[30:06] that he had to die at gethsemane
[30:12] you have to die on the altar with your
[30:15] sacrifice just as dead as
[30:16] he was and you're born again
[30:20] you have to completely overcome who
[30:24] yourself i say lord kill me
[30:29] kill me dead all over again lord
[30:32] let the old vine and me die
[30:36] let thee let the false vine in me die
[30:40] and let christ live the seed is not
[30:43] there with the shuck no to see how close
[30:44] it looks matthew said saint matthew 24
[30:46] 24
[30:47] the two spirits in the last days the
[30:49] church spirit of the church people
[30:51] and the bride spirit of the bride people
[30:53] would be so close together till it would
[30:54] deceive the very elected if it was
[30:56] possible
[30:57] that's how close that's amazing he said
[30:59] the church spirit of the church people
[31:02] and the bride spirit of the bride people
[31:06] now this can look really really far away
[31:08] until you come home and you realize
[31:10] as brother harold beckett said one time
[31:12] at camp i thought it was amazing
[31:14] he said you don't have to look very far
[31:15] in your church to find three types of
[31:17] believers
[31:18] he said you yourself are three types of
[31:20] believers amen
[31:21] he said your carnal self your flesh is
[31:23] an unbeliever
[31:24] he said your spirit is a make-believer
[31:27] amen but your soul that life in your
[31:29] soul
[31:30] is a genuine believer and so you don't
[31:33] have to look very far to find three
[31:35] types of believers amen
[31:37] you don't have to look very far to find
[31:38] out what the church spirit of the church
[31:40] people is
[31:41] he just wants to put a holy ghost
[31:42] anointing on your spirit
[31:45] brother branham said you can have the
[31:46] holy ghost on your spirit
[31:48] every day of your life and die and go to
[31:51] hell
[31:53] that's how deceptive this is he wants he
[31:56] doesn't mind if you have tingling
[31:57] sensations and you feel the presence of
[31:59] god
[32:00] and when god's sweeping down through the
[32:02] auditorium that you
[32:03] feel it the same as the one next to you
[32:05] feels it he doesn't matter
[32:06] he doesn't care what you feel he doesn't
[32:08] care if you say i believe the message
[32:10] because brother branham said that's fine
[32:12] but that's not it yet
[32:14] that's just being able to read that's
[32:16] being able to take a mental conception
[32:18] and acknowledge that it matches the
[32:19] scriptures
[32:20] and i agree with that but you have to
[32:21] take the life of the message
[32:23] you have to take the life of christ and
[32:24] it's got to come in and you've got to
[32:26] die to everything
[32:28] but that every way of thinking
[32:31] every way of feeling every bit of
[32:33] reasoning that goes against the revealed
[32:35] word of the day
[32:36] you have to completely die out to that
[32:40] what he says about the way we should
[32:42] live and the way we should conduct
[32:43] ourselves and marriage and divorce and
[32:44] the way we dress and the way places we
[32:46] go
[32:47] we have to die to all of our little
[32:49] reasonings and our excuses
[32:51] and our making excuses for why we don't
[32:54] fully obey
[32:54] you've got to die
[32:58] completely die on the sacrifice on the
[33:01] altar with your sacrifice
[33:05] and then you're born again
[33:09] and it's not you that lives it's not you
[33:12] that does the works
[33:14] it's not you it's not a life that you
[33:16] live
[33:17] it's a life he lives through you
[33:20] but he's not going to share the dwelling
[33:23] place with your reasoning
[33:25] he is not going to share the dwelling
[33:27] place with the antichrist spirit
[33:30] that will reason the word and make
[33:32] excuses for why
[33:34] and be in a hybridized condition
[33:36] spiritually
[33:38] that has to die and we can slay that old
[33:42] vine and let it die
[33:43] and receive christ what is christ christ
[33:47] what is he he's the word made manifest
[33:53] we can receive jesus christ the living
[33:55] word may manifest in our hour
[33:57] and bring newness of life then it's not
[34:00] a life you live
[34:02] it's the word life living through you
[34:05] if you receive the word and let the
[34:06] washing of the water the word sanctify
[34:08] you and wash out
[34:10] how's it going to wash out you say
[34:11] that's true
[34:13] you said it it's true i commit myself to
[34:16] it and let the word wash it out of you
[34:19] it didn't say you wash yourself the
[34:21] washing of the water of the
[34:22] word washes it out of you but you can't
[34:24] resist it you have to submit to it
[34:32] hallelujah
[34:34] let's take our seals book and the second
[34:36] seal
[34:37] and turn to paragraph 212.
[34:49] page 184 the seals book
[34:53] paragraph 2 12 it says now watch
[34:56] satan's duty is to pervert the word of
[34:59] god
[35:00] to wisdom's reasonings
[35:04] satan's duty let's get this if you want
[35:06] to find out what his job description is
[35:08] satan's duty is to pervert the word of
[35:11] god to wisdom's reasonings
[35:13] then he marks his subjects by rejecting
[35:16] the original word
[35:19] they don't reject the hybrid word they
[35:20] don't reject the reasoned word
[35:22] they don't reject the word it's been
[35:23] passed down from denomination
[35:25] denomination denomination and mixed with
[35:27] ideas
[35:27] and entered into the message with mixed
[35:29] ideas and stayed mixed with ideas
[35:31] that's not that's not that's not what
[35:33] they receive he marks them
[35:36] by rejecting the original word and
[35:38] that's what malachi 4 came to do
[35:41] that's what revelation 10 7 came to do
[35:43] is bring us back to the original faith
[35:45] of the original fathers
[35:48] and when we reject that we've been
[35:50] marked amen
[35:54] so now let's look at this second seal
[35:57] i told you before when brother branham
[36:00] said now we just have to suffer a little
[36:02] while that that's the second seal
[36:04] and some of you looked at me like what
[36:05] in the world are you talking about
[36:07] let's let's look at what he says in
[36:09] paragraph 3 17.
[36:12] of the second seal page 197
[36:15] and the second seal page 197 paragraph
[36:18] 317
[36:24] he said now they that sure
[36:28] they should kill one another they should
[36:30] kill each other his bow had no arrows at
[36:32] first
[36:32] but his great sword did he done his
[36:34] killing later and changed from white
[36:36] horse to red horse
[36:37] the same exact devil with the sword now
[36:40] remember see he doesn't
[36:41] want to stay on the white horse
[36:44] so there's a battle plan here there was
[36:46] a battle in heaven the battle in heaven
[36:48] came to earth and it's playing out the
[36:50] same thing that took place there
[36:52] is just repeating down here and so
[36:55] and so we find out that the first thing
[36:58] in heaven was a battle
[36:59] lucifer was kicked out and come to earth
[37:01] and he polluted eden
[37:02] then he's been polluting ever since and
[37:04] now from the battle in heaven it's come
[37:06] to the battle on earth
[37:07] and it's finished on earth at the time
[37:08] of the battle of armageddon now anyone
[37:10] knows that the battle started in heaven
[37:12] and so they kicked them out michael and
[37:14] his angels overthrew them just ran out
[37:16] and when they did he dropped right down
[37:18] in eden and here started the battle down
[37:21] here
[37:22] god had his children all fortified up by
[37:24] his word but eve stuck her neck out
[37:26] and i believe you're right maybe and
[37:27] there it went and it's been
[37:29] ever since same tactics
[37:33] same plan same thing what he did in
[37:35] heaven he's doing now he drops down to
[37:37] eden and what does he do in eden
[37:38] when he goes down to eden he doesn't get
[37:40] a troop of baboons
[37:42] he doesn't go and start a church of the
[37:43] serpent he doesn't do any of that he
[37:45] comes right down and he wants to go
[37:47] where god's at
[37:48] he wants to work where god's working he
[37:50] wants to be he wants the destruction of
[37:52] god's children
[37:53] amen in the discrediting of god's word
[37:55] he had serpents that were so close they
[37:57] were almost like humans they could talk
[37:58] with humans they could
[37:59] be a walk in an upright condition they
[38:02] may have been stronger they were
[38:03] intelligent
[38:04] they he could have built mass vast
[38:05] armies with the with the serpent but he
[38:07] didn't want the serpent
[38:08] they mean he was only going to use the
[38:10] serpent to get even closer
[38:13] he wants to be where god is he wants to
[38:16] work where god's working
[38:18] and then he wants to take over where
[38:20] god's ruling
[38:22] so now we see his tactics we're not to
[38:25] be deceived
[38:27] so he comes in with a white horse this
[38:29] white horse he has a bow but no arrows
[38:32] he really can't hurt you and he has no
[38:34] crown but he receives a crown
[38:37] and he comes forth to conquer now you
[38:40] have to understand
[38:41] we talked about this i think last sunday
[38:44] we have to understand his purpose
[38:46] is to conquer
[38:49] but how does he conquer he conquers by
[38:52] deception
[38:53] it's the deceitful spirit that's gone
[38:55] now and corrupt then what's the
[38:57] deception
[38:57] i'm not here to conquer you i have no
[38:59] arrows
[39:02] i have no crown i'm not here to hurt you
[39:05] i'm not here to conquer you when the
[39:06] nicolaitan spirit started off it was
[39:08] just a saying
[39:10] and the staying was deeds and man it was
[39:11] just a fellowship amongst ministers
[39:13] what's wrong with the fellowship amongst
[39:15] ministers but then it became a doctrine
[39:17] and it began to rule amen
[39:19] so it starts off i'm not here to hurt
[39:20] you i have no arrows
[39:22] i'm not wearing a crown i have no
[39:24] authority over you i mean
[39:26] you can come and go as you please
[39:30] you can jump in this compromising out
[39:32] anytime you want
[39:36] you can take a little it's okay it's not
[39:38] going to hurt you
[39:39] you can defy what the prophet of god
[39:41] said just a little bit it's all right
[39:43] god still loves you that's what he told
[39:44] eve
[39:46] he told eve the same exact thing well
[39:49] surely surely god wouldn't kill you i
[39:51] mean come on
[39:52] you're a daughter of god you're a child
[39:53] of god you come out of adam he loves
[39:55] adam he loves you
[39:56] he's not going to kill you and so he's
[39:58] coming in why through deception
[40:00] and the deception he's coming to conquer
[40:03] but he never looks like he's coming to
[40:04] conquer
[40:05] he looks like he's just coming to
[40:08] fellowship
[40:11] and then when you come in he receives a
[40:13] crown
[40:14] and in the early church who crowned this
[40:16] white horse rider
[40:17] it was the church themselves that put
[40:20] the crown on his head
[40:21] and it's you yourself to give the white
[40:23] horse authority
[40:24] when he shows up at your door with
[40:26] reasoning against the word
[40:27] with compromise on the word of god he
[40:29] shows up and he's got no authority over
[40:31] you he has no arrows he can do nothing
[40:33] to you
[40:34] all you have to do is roar as a lion
[40:36] with the pure word of god
[40:37] and say does not the scripture say did
[40:40] not the prophet teach us
[40:41] doesn't the word tell us amen and he'll
[40:44] flee from you because he has no arrows
[40:46] and he has no crown
[40:48] but when you entertain that compromise
[40:50] when you entertain that deception and
[40:52] bring it in
[40:53] you put the crown on his head
[40:57] and when you put the crown on his head
[40:59] he changes horses
[41:02] and now he comes as a red horse
[41:08] see first stage white horse he was a
[41:10] teacher but an antichrist spirit in his
[41:12] doctrine
[41:13] and his quality it was innocent it
[41:15] couldn't hurt nothing
[41:16] seemed like couldn't hurt anything
[41:19] seemed like
[41:21] how can this little video hurt you how
[41:23] can this little thing hurt your kids how
[41:25] how how can this hurt you it couldn't
[41:27] hurt you seemed like
[41:29] right just going on that's the way satan
[41:31] comes in
[41:32] he's a slick bird
[41:36] but god raised up a standard
[41:40] brother bam said satan raises up those
[41:43] four horses
[41:44] watch the strudent there's this fellow
[41:45] that we're talking about here satan
[41:47] we're unfolding him right here just
[41:50] stripping him down by the scriptures and
[41:52] letting you see who he is
[41:54] what's supposed to be done you remember
[41:56] he's not tried to go in and be a
[41:58] communist satan hasn't
[41:59] he's an antichrist so close that jesus
[42:01] said would deceive the very
[42:03] elect don't look around
[42:06] for the white horse you look right here
[42:09] for the white horse
[42:13] but god raised up a standard against it
[42:15] the pure word which is christ
[42:18] paul's teaching brother benham said paul
[42:21] was roaring out those early apostles
[42:23] roaring out with the pure word of god
[42:24] with the pure revelation of the word
[42:26] they were writing the bible that you and
[42:28] i are still reading
[42:30] amen and that was the combat to this
[42:32] antichrist spirit of white horse and
[42:34] it's still the combat to the antichrist
[42:36] spirit of white horse
[42:37] and brother branham came to restore us
[42:39] back to the original teaching
[42:41] he said when he went beyond the curtain
[42:42] of time they say you have to be judged
[42:44] with your group he said well paul has to
[42:45] be judged
[42:46] and he said yes he said well good
[42:48] because i preached what paul preached
[42:50] and the millions that were there which
[42:51] is you and i
[42:52] i was standing there and i hollered
[42:55] we're resting on that
[42:57] and i'm still resting on that that he
[42:59] preached what paul preached
[43:00] amen and if paul was a vindicated
[43:02] messenger if he was a light to the
[43:04] gentiles the fulfillment of old
[43:05] testament prophecies
[43:06] if he laid it down and brother brethren
[43:08] restored it back to us
[43:10] god cannot change his word amen god
[43:12] cannot manipulate his word god has to
[43:14] honor his word
[43:15] and if we went back to the original
[43:17] faith of the original fathers then i am
[43:19] resting on that
[43:21] how many of you are resting on that
[43:25] hallelujah that's what defeats the white
[43:27] horse
[43:31] don't forsake god has given us through
[43:34] miraculous vindication god has put his
[43:38] seal on the message of the hour
[43:41] don't you reason it those things you
[43:44] read that you don't understand that
[43:45] don't compute you can't add them up
[43:47] don't you go to reasoning it don't you
[43:49] go to get out your spiritual calculator
[43:51] and try to work out the formula
[43:53] you just wait till god reveals it don't
[43:55] reason it don't question it don't cast
[43:57] it to the side
[43:58] you just wait because in the hour we
[44:00] have need of it god will reveal it
[44:04] the prophet of god told us the same
[44:05] thing in the seals i can't turn to it
[44:07] right now but
[44:08] he said that the disciples come to him
[44:10] and said now we know
[44:11] that you're the son of god for no man
[44:13] can do these things let's be of the
[44:14] father
[44:15] and brother braham said jesus must look
[44:17] at him said oh now do you know
[44:20] amen now do you know i mean it's been so
[44:23] long with you and you don't know me
[44:25] now you know right and so the disciples
[44:28] were walking with the lord much like we
[44:30] have been for 50 some years
[44:33] and saying oh now i get it
[44:37] it was jesus christ that came down in
[44:39] 1963.
[44:41] it was the mighty angel it was the
[44:43] theophany king theophany it was christ
[44:45] amen come down
[44:46] in the fullness of his word with the
[44:48] full life of the word that was christ
[44:50] oh i get it now now you get it
[44:55] are you are you just now getting it
[44:58] so the the bible pattern never changes
[45:00] disciples are with him sleeping with him
[45:02] talking to him
[45:03] he's there watching over them
[45:04] instructing them doing everything amen
[45:06] through the message of the hour
[45:07] they're listening to the tapes and
[45:08] they're not realizing it this is king
[45:10] theophanies come down
[45:14] and all of a sudden we say oh now i know
[45:18] this is the lord of glory in this word
[45:20] amen this that i'm receiving
[45:22] when i take this word in and get that
[45:24] life that's the king theophany life
[45:27] amen hallelujah that's the life of jesus
[45:30] christ
[45:33] and so now i said he said now you know
[45:36] and brother branham said this it's
[45:38] interesting in the seals
[45:40] he said see maybe it wasn't supposed to
[45:43] be
[45:44] until just that time there
[45:48] god's awakening things in your heart now
[45:51] he's awakening things in his bride right
[45:52] now and maybe it's just not supposed to
[45:55] be in this
[45:56] till this time but when he's troubling
[45:58] the waters
[45:59] get in when he's troubling the waters
[46:02] jump in when you see him stirring when
[46:04] you see the word when he's unlocking and
[46:06] unveiling it you throw yourself
[46:08] in there as fast as you can and you say
[46:10] god i want it all
[46:11] amen if it scours me if it tears the
[46:13] height off of me
[46:14] i want it all because the way i lived
[46:16] last year is not good enough
[46:19] what i've accepted for 50 years is not
[46:21] good enough
[46:22] we're supposed to be growing in the
[46:24] knowledge and grace of christ jesus
[46:26] we're supposed to be growing into the
[46:28] head which is christ we're not supposed
[46:30] to be staying the way we were
[46:31] receiving the message 50 years ago and
[46:33] believing god sent a prophet
[46:35] and there's malachi forward and that the
[46:37] seals are open that's not good enough
[46:39] for a rapture
[46:40] if it was good enough for a rapture we
[46:41] would have taken a rapture
[46:44] but he's got to bring a greater
[46:45] revelation and a greater revelation
[46:47] comes with a greater cost
[46:49] and a greater sincerity we've got to
[46:51] come to this feast of passover
[46:52] not with the old unleavened bread of
[46:54] malice and wickedness but we come to
[46:56] this feast of passover which is what
[46:58] christ our passover lamb we must come
[47:01] with the
[47:02] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[47:06] amen that's what the that's what the
[47:08] lord told the prophet when the prophet
[47:09] of god
[47:10] amen he saw this a vision of this mamba
[47:13] snake trying to bite his friend amen
[47:15] and that's the worst kind he said the
[47:17] worst devil that was satan himself
[47:21] trying to bite him and he couldn't buy
[47:23] it brother brandon was trying to bite
[47:25] him
[47:26] and he said you have the power to bind
[47:27] him but you must be more
[47:29] sincere
[47:34] and brother venom started to speak and
[47:36] he bound him and he says
[47:38] you can unbind him too
[47:43] why would you ever want to unbind the
[47:45] serpent
[47:48] i mean we all want to bind him
[47:53] but why would you want to unbind him
[47:59] brother man is seeing a principle here
[48:03] life and death is in the power of the
[48:05] tongue
[48:08] we have the power by the restored word
[48:10] of god through sincerity and truth
[48:13] to bind the serpent but you also have
[48:17] the power to unbind him in your life
[48:20] as soon as brother branham unbound that
[48:22] serpent he went right back come right
[48:24] after him he was going after
[48:25] doing the same thing he was doing before
[48:28] he has to be bound but only in sincerity
[48:32] but you have the power also to unbind
[48:36] that certain that's why when compromise
[48:39] comes in
[48:40] and we agree with and we reason on the
[48:42] word we begin to
[48:43] unbind the serpent
[48:46] and we find out he starts to do things
[48:48] to us we don't like and take us down
[48:49] past we don't like
[48:51] when we find out a little ways down the
[48:52] road that we don't like where we're at
[48:53] and how did we get here and why am i
[48:55] here
[48:55] and why is my life dry and why am i in
[48:58] my dark ages
[48:59] why is everything why am i in a desert
[49:01] place amen
[49:03] did you unbind the serpent by a
[49:06] confession
[49:07] different than the word
[49:10] brother branham was struggling with this
[49:12] it must be more sincere and he asked the
[49:14] lord to show him
[49:15] and his bible opens to this passage in
[49:17] scripture
[49:18] and it says you you have to come to this
[49:20] feast of passover
[49:21] not with the leavened bread of malice
[49:23] and wickedness but with the unleavened
[49:25] bread of sincerity
[49:27] and truth you know what brother branham
[49:29] said he did
[49:30] he said i started fasting and praying
[49:34] fasting and praying he realized that
[49:37] what i have
[49:38] isn't enough this is the prophet of god
[49:42] he's coming to a greater revelation that
[49:44] he can bind this serpent
[49:46] and but he has to do it he can only do
[49:48] it through sincerity and truth
[49:49] amen the disciples came one time to
[49:51] jesus and they weren't able to cast out
[49:53] a demon remember
[49:54] there was no problem with the promise no
[49:56] problem with the word but they had to
[49:58] have a different
[49:59] level of sincerity and jesus said why
[50:02] why is your faith so small and he cast
[50:05] him out
[50:05] and he said this one comes out not but
[50:07] by prayer
[50:08] and fasting
[50:11] so when brother venom finds out he
[50:13] combined this serpent and the lord shows
[50:15] him that you have to keep this feast of
[50:17] passover
[50:17] with the unleavened bread of sincerity
[50:20] and truth you can be sincere and
[50:23] sincerely wrong amen
[50:24] you can be you can have the truth and
[50:26] not be sincere but when you put
[50:28] sincerity together with truth
[50:30] now you're keeping the feast of the
[50:32] passover which is the crucified jesus
[50:34] christ
[50:37] so brother venom had to be more sincere
[50:41] brothers and sisters we're not cruising
[50:42] along waiting for god to do something
[50:46] in heaven are we getting to the time
[50:47] we're getting to the time all right
[50:49] king wraps your time rapturing faith
[50:53] comes down
[50:54] and all of a sudden we go up he's given
[50:56] us rapturing grace
[50:58] it lies on them tapes and it's got to
[51:00] convert by revelation to rapturing faith
[51:03] precept upon precept line upon line here
[51:07] a little there a little what's he doing
[51:08] he's building his church into the full
[51:10] stature of jesus christ
[51:12] and will manifest it with the full power
[51:14] that jesus christ had when he was here
[51:15] on earth
[51:16] we're cut we've got to be growing into
[51:18] it we can't just be cruising along
[51:21] riding brother branham's coattails into
[51:22] the rapture you know sitting around
[51:25] and saying i believe the message it's
[51:26] all going to be all right with me he
[51:28] says you get into the message you
[51:30] receive the messenger you receive
[51:32] the life and then that life has to grow
[51:37] into rapturing faith a church should be
[51:40] growing into a rapturing condition
[51:43] if you find your life sliding backwards
[51:45] or staying level the same way it's been
[51:46] for years
[51:48] my fire and my zeal and my hunger for
[51:50] the word of god
[51:51] if you find that it's hard to listen to
[51:53] tapes it's difficult to read books
[51:55] that come in the church as exciting as
[51:57] it used to be you're in a backslid
[51:59] condition
[52:01] you need to get back amen to the
[52:03] fervency and desire for the word of god
[52:05] come back to sincerity and truth
[52:07] start fasting and praying and say god
[52:10] bring me back my first love that i'll do
[52:12] the first works
[52:13] i'm growing cold and formal and
[52:15] powerless
[52:17] that's the works of the devil
[52:21] you shouldn't have a powerless religion
[52:24] when the devil comes and strikes your
[52:26] home there should be a consecration in
[52:29] that home of sincerity and truth
[52:30] that can take the word and believe it
[52:32] and cast the devil out
[52:34] god hates a powerless religion
[52:41] amen where are we supposed to be
[52:48] all right let's go back
[52:54] we want to bring up the red horse
[52:57] second seal
[53:01] let's read now back on page 197 of the
[53:04] second seal
[53:07] paragraph 317.
[53:12] they should kill one another they should
[53:14] kill each other his bow had no arrows at
[53:16] first
[53:16] but his great sword did he done his
[53:18] killing later
[53:19] and changed from white horse to red
[53:21] horse the same exactly
[53:23] the devil with the sword what did jesus
[53:26] say
[53:27] jesus said they that take the sword will
[53:29] perish by it
[53:31] don't fight back
[53:34] remember when i said in the beginning he
[53:36] said we must suffer just a little while
[53:38] i said that's the second seal now listen
[53:41] he says if you take the sword you'll
[53:43] perish by it don't fight back
[53:45] jesus that night when he when he told
[53:47] said that to peter took his sword and
[53:49] just
[53:50] do like he did just go ahead now now
[53:53] remember
[53:54] he has got a sword he is going forth a
[53:56] sword in his hand
[53:58] riding red horse wading through the
[54:00] blood of
[54:01] everybody that disagrees with him
[54:06] now do you understand it how many
[54:08] understands what the seal is now
[54:11] he just told you what the seal is
[54:15] all right let's read it again in case
[54:16] you missed it remember the seal is
[54:19] represented by a red horse this
[54:21] antichrist has got off his white horse
[54:23] he's now riding his red horse
[54:24] this red horse is given a sword his
[54:26] objective was to take peace from the
[54:28] earth and kill
[54:29] that they might kill one another in fact
[54:32] let's read that we want to catch that in
[54:33] revelations chapter 6 i don't want to
[54:35] miss this
[54:39] verse three chapter six verse three and
[54:40] when he had opened the second seal i
[54:42] heard the second beast say
[54:43] come and see and there went out another
[54:46] horse that was red and power was given
[54:47] to him that sat there on to take
[54:49] peace from the earth that they should
[54:52] kill
[54:52] one another and there was given unto him
[54:54] a great sword
[54:55] so objective is to take peace from the
[54:57] earth and to kill one another
[55:01] so here here we have
[55:04] in the garden of gethsemane
[55:08] jesus is now he's now here he knows his
[55:12] hour has come
[55:13] it's time it's time for him to lay down
[55:16] his life he's wrestled out in gethsemane
[55:18] he's asked if there's another way
[55:20] he knows there's no other way so jesus
[55:22] is now taking the ox anointing
[55:25] because the knock anointing is a
[55:27] sacrificial animal it lays down its life
[55:29] and it bears under burdens not like the
[55:32] lion but now like the ox
[55:34] and now jesus has wrestled it out in
[55:36] gethsemane and now he's ready to lay
[55:39] down his life
[55:40] he told him he was going to now that he
[55:42] wrestled it out
[55:43] now the time has come but but peter is
[55:46] not
[55:46] in the same anointing with jesus
[55:50] peter is under a different influence
[55:52] than what jesus is under
[55:53] peter was sleeping while jesus was
[55:55] praying
[55:56] and peter wasn't catching the same
[55:58] spirit that jesus was catching amen
[56:01] and he said what did jesus say he said
[56:03] i'm in first i'm in uh uh
[56:05] back in the seals second seal paragraph
[56:07] 3 18.
[56:09] what did jesus say they that take the
[56:11] sword will perish by it
[56:14] don't fight back
[56:17] jesus that night when he told said that
[56:19] and peter took his sword
[56:20] he said just do like he did just go
[56:22] ahead now remember he's got a great
[56:25] sword he's going forth a sword in his
[56:26] hand
[56:27] riding red horse wading through the
[56:29] blood of everybody
[56:30] that disagrees with him now do you
[56:33] understand it
[56:35] how many understands what the seal is
[56:37] now
[56:39] how many here understand what the seal
[56:41] is now the antichrist spirit is going
[56:44] through
[56:44] killing everyone who disagrees with him
[56:49] but the spirit of christ now is not
[56:52] fighting back
[56:53] surrendering and laying down his life
[56:58] keep reading
[57:01] peter was not under the right anointing
[57:06] if he was in the right anointing he
[57:08] would have caught the same anointing
[57:09] jesus christ caught
[57:11] but peter was not yet converted and he
[57:13] did not have the right anointing
[57:15] peter is moving through the seals
[57:19] and i want to show you that
[57:22] let's read in matthew 16.
[57:36] matthew chapter 16. it's a great portion
[57:39] of
[57:39] scripture we read it
[57:42] all the time
[57:47] verse 13. when jesus come unto the coast
[57:51] of caesarea philippi he asked his
[57:52] disciples saying
[57:54] whom do men say that i the son of man am
[57:56] and they said some say that thou art
[57:58] john the baptist
[57:59] some elias and others jeremiah are one
[58:01] of the prophets
[58:02] he saith unto them but whom say ye that
[58:04] i am and simon peter answered and said
[58:07] thou art the christ
[58:08] the son of the living god and jesus
[58:10] answered and sent unto him blessed art
[58:11] thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood
[58:13] hath not revealed it unto thee
[58:15] but my father which is in heaven and i
[58:17] say also unto thee that thou art peter
[58:19] and upon this rock i will build my
[58:20] church
[58:21] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[58:23] against them and i will give unto thee
[58:25] the keys of the kingdom of heaven
[58:27] and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[58:29] shall be bound in heaven
[58:30] and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[58:32] shall be loosed in heaven
[58:33] so here we find out peter comes to a
[58:36] direct revelation from the father of who
[58:37] jesus christ is
[58:39] he's standing here in the whole world in
[58:41] turmoil on who this is and he says who
[58:43] do you say this is
[58:44] and he says daughter christ the son of
[58:46] the living god he says flesh and blood
[58:47] never told it to you revealed to you my
[58:49] father which is in heaven and besides
[58:51] this i'm going to give you the keys to
[58:52] the kingdom
[58:54] so peter's got himself in a good spot if
[58:56] you were there and the lord had just
[58:57] told you that
[58:58] and spoken to you you'd be like i got it
[59:02] i got it i know who he is i have a
[59:04] personal revelation from the father of
[59:05] who the son is
[59:06] and i've got the keys of the kingdom of
[59:08] promise to me everything's in the bag
[59:10] i'm okay
[59:14] peter's chums with the lord you know i
[59:16] saw it
[59:18] lord loves me i'm the best because they
[59:20] were always arguing over who's going to
[59:21] be the chief among them
[59:23] they're carnal in their mind they're
[59:25] always disputing back and forth who
[59:27] should be the chief
[59:28] who should be among them when he comes
[59:29] on his throne who's going to be the
[59:30] chief deputy of the land
[59:32] they've got carnal thinking carnal
[59:34] understanding missing what's going on
[59:35] spiritually
[59:36] now hear peter who's been wondering
[59:38] who's going to be the best now he says
[59:40] oh you got it nobody else got it you got
[59:42] it and you're getting the keys
[59:44] if you were peter how would you feel
[59:46] pretty good
[59:48] verse 20. very next verse
[59:53] that he charged the disciples that they
[59:55] should tell no man that he was
[59:56] jesus christ drop down the very next
[59:58] thing that happens
[59:59] from that time forth began jesus to show
[1:00:02] unto his disciples
[1:00:03] how that he must go into jerusalem and
[1:00:05] suffer many things of the elders and
[1:00:06] chief priests and scribes
[1:00:08] and be killed and be raised again the
[1:00:10] third day
[1:00:11] so the next revelation he brings them
[1:00:13] after this
[1:00:14] incident is that he has to go and be
[1:00:18] killed
[1:00:18] amen he has to go and be killed and
[1:00:21] raised again the third day
[1:00:23] then peter took him and began to rebuke
[1:00:25] him saying
[1:00:26] be it far from thee lord this shall not
[1:00:28] be
[1:00:29] unto thee but he turned and said unto
[1:00:32] him peter
[1:00:33] get thee behind me satan
[1:00:36] thou are an offense unto me for thou
[1:00:39] savers not the things that be of god
[1:00:41] but the things that be of men
[1:00:46] what a turn of events for peter
[1:00:50] he had it all wrapped up everything was
[1:00:52] going good and and he says
[1:00:54] one thing and the lord turns around and
[1:00:57] says get thee behind me
[1:00:58] satan how would you like the lord to
[1:01:00] look at you and say get thee behind me
[1:01:02] satan
[1:01:04] what was it peter was under the
[1:01:07] influence of the white horse rider
[1:01:10] because the white horse rider is trying
[1:01:12] to reason the word
[1:01:14] because he knew jesus christ was the son
[1:01:16] of god he was the christ he was the word
[1:01:18] and the word just said i'm going to be
[1:01:19] killed and i'm going to be raised again
[1:01:21] the third day that's the word that's
[1:01:22] thus saith the lord
[1:01:24] and now peter starts to reason with thus
[1:01:26] saith the lord
[1:01:27] and whenever you reason with thus saith
[1:01:29] the lord that's the antichrist spirit
[1:01:32] amen peter no doubt loved the lord no
[1:01:34] doubt didn't want to see this happen
[1:01:35] in his intellectual mind and his
[1:01:37] reasoning thinking everything's going so
[1:01:39] good
[1:01:40] that's not going to happen he begins to
[1:01:41] rebuke the lord
[1:01:43] he repeat begins to rebuke the person of
[1:01:45] the word himself
[1:01:47] and say far be it from thee that shall
[1:01:48] not happen and jesus turns right around
[1:01:51] and he he doesn't say peter this is you
[1:01:54] he says peter that he says get thee
[1:01:56] behind me satan
[1:01:57] he recognizes this is the same white
[1:01:59] horse that was riding in eden
[1:02:02] this is the same thing that came to me
[1:02:04] in the wilderness this is the same
[1:02:05] spirit
[1:02:06] now it's in peter speaking back to me
[1:02:08] look how close the deception is friends
[1:02:11] peter just got a divine revelation from
[1:02:14] the father himself
[1:02:15] the father god dropped into peter an
[1:02:18] understanding of who jesus was and jesus
[1:02:20] says you're going to get the kingdom
[1:02:22] the keys to the kingdom and immediately
[1:02:24] after that the white horse anointing the
[1:02:26] antichrist comes right into the same
[1:02:28] vessel
[1:02:28] and speaks back to jesus out of the same
[1:02:31] lips that our revelation from god
[1:02:33] is now speaking antichrist words
[1:02:37] and jesus recognized it like that he
[1:02:40] said get thee behind me satan
[1:02:44] see the deception friends you cannot
[1:02:48] reason the word of god
[1:02:51] if these things have to happen they have
[1:02:54] to happen
[1:02:56] if these things have to be this way it
[1:02:58] has to be this way
[1:03:00] because does sayeth the lord it ain't
[1:03:02] changing
[1:03:05] anything that would try to get you to
[1:03:07] say something
[1:03:08] different than the message is an
[1:03:11] antichrist spirit
[1:03:13] and it comes from satan
[1:03:16] jesus was there the messenger of the
[1:03:18] hour
[1:03:19] the word made manifest he'd come in the
[1:03:22] ministry
[1:03:23] of a prophet he was standing there on
[1:03:26] earth as a prophet
[1:03:29] prophesying that i must go and
[1:03:32] i must be abused and i must be killed
[1:03:35] and i'll raise again the third day
[1:03:37] and peter was denying the prophetic
[1:03:40] ministry of the saith the lord
[1:03:44] same thing happens to us when we reason
[1:03:46] with brother branham
[1:03:48] reason the message try to
[1:03:51] properly place what he was saying
[1:03:54] correct him where he was wrong on the
[1:03:55] word
[1:03:56] oh my goodness friends that's the white
[1:03:58] horse
[1:04:00] that's the white horse anointing you
[1:04:02] better be careful with that kind of talk
[1:04:04] you better stay away from that if you
[1:04:06] don't understand it say i don't
[1:04:07] understand it
[1:04:08] if it doesn't make sense you say it
[1:04:10] doesn't make sense to me but don't you
[1:04:11] dare say he was wrong
[1:04:15] you wait till god gives you a revelation
[1:04:17] or you find in the message where brother
[1:04:19] branham switches or
[1:04:20] he says i was wrong on that but you
[1:04:22] don't dare tell him he was wrong
[1:04:25] that's the antichrist spirit trying to
[1:04:26] get you to reason the word
[1:04:28] coming in like he did the eve
[1:04:31] coming in like he tried to jesus he went
[1:04:34] directly to jesus it wouldn't work
[1:04:35] so what's he always do he always comes
[1:04:37] through number two
[1:04:40] you think you think that lucifer did not
[1:04:43] see this whole thing with
[1:04:45] with who do men say that i am and the
[1:04:47] revelation that comes and
[1:04:48] now peter's going to get the keys to the
[1:04:50] kingdom amen do you think lucifer didn't
[1:04:52] see that so where does lucifer goes he
[1:04:54] always goes to number two
[1:04:58] and tries to get to number one
[1:05:03] hallelujah we love the lord
[1:05:07] the devil is being exposed the
[1:05:09] scriptures are stripping him down
[1:05:12] the word and the word only
[1:05:17] so this is peter now think about this
[1:05:20] that seed dropped in peter's heart
[1:05:22] now we don't we don't have any record
[1:05:25] that peter repented
[1:05:28] from what he said to the lord we don't
[1:05:31] have any record that he repented
[1:05:33] the lord rebuked him but we have no
[1:05:35] other record that peter ever come to
[1:05:36] repentance
[1:05:37] for allowing the white horse to to
[1:05:39] influence him for saying something
[1:05:40] than what the word says we're trying to
[1:05:42] reason the word
[1:05:44] so let's turn over to matthew 26.
[1:05:48] we're going to the garden of gethsemane
[1:05:52] you're going to see the progression of
[1:05:53] the antichrist
[1:05:55] remember he doesn't want to stay on the
[1:05:57] white horse he wants to get on a
[1:05:59] different horse
[1:06:02] matthew 26 verse 47
[1:06:10] and while he spake lo judas one of the
[1:06:12] twelve came with him a great multitude
[1:06:14] with swords and staves from the chief
[1:06:16] priests and elders of the people
[1:06:18] now he that betrayed him gave him a sign
[1:06:20] saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same
[1:06:22] as he
[1:06:23] hold him fast and forthwith he came to
[1:06:26] jesus and said hail master and kissed
[1:06:27] him
[1:06:28] and jesus said unto him friend wherefore
[1:06:30] thou come
[1:06:31] then came they and laid his hands on
[1:06:33] jesus and took him
[1:06:34] now i want you to stop for a minute
[1:06:37] jesus knows good and well who judas is
[1:06:41] he knows what judas is doing because he
[1:06:43] told judas he looked at him when he
[1:06:45] dipshot with him he said what thou must
[1:06:47] do do it quickly
[1:06:48] and judas went out he knew he was the
[1:06:50] son of perdition from the beginning
[1:06:52] he knew it when he chose him he knew it
[1:06:54] from the beginning who he was
[1:06:55] and he knew what he was doing that night
[1:06:57] of the last supper when he went away
[1:07:00] but look at what jesus says to him
[1:07:03] he says friend wherefore art thou come
[1:07:07] you know in billy paul's testimony he
[1:07:09] said you couldn't tell brother branham's
[1:07:10] enemies from his friends
[1:07:14] jesus has wrestled it out in gethsemane
[1:07:18] and now they're coming to betray him
[1:07:20] they're coming to kill him
[1:07:23] and what's he doing he's laying down his
[1:07:26] life and he's
[1:07:28] not fighting back
[1:07:34] this is the second seal friends this is
[1:07:37] our example
[1:07:39] then came they laid hands on jesus and
[1:07:41] took him and behold one of them which
[1:07:43] were with jesus stretched out his hand
[1:07:45] and drew his sword and struck the
[1:07:46] servant of the high priest and smote off
[1:07:48] his ear
[1:07:49] now i just want to take note that he was
[1:07:51] not trying to cut off his ear
[1:07:56] we have to realize the objective with
[1:07:58] the sword here was not the ear
[1:08:01] he was trying to kill this man he was
[1:08:04] trying to
[1:08:04] split his skull up and trying to cut his
[1:08:07] head off i don't know
[1:08:08] who weaved and who wagged and who zigged
[1:08:10] and who zagged but whatever happened he
[1:08:12] missed and hit his ear
[1:08:14] amen
[1:08:20] he said he drew his sword and struck the
[1:08:23] servant of the high priest and smote off
[1:08:25] his ear
[1:08:25] then said jesus and him put up again thy
[1:08:28] sword into his place
[1:08:29] for all those that take the sword shall
[1:08:31] perish with the sword
[1:08:33] thinketh down that i cannot now pray to
[1:08:36] my father
[1:08:37] and he shall present presently give me
[1:08:39] more than 12
[1:08:40] legions of angels but how then shall the
[1:08:43] scriptures be fulfilled
[1:08:45] that thus it must be
[1:08:49] here he's walking in the word he's
[1:08:51] catching the right anointing for the
[1:08:53] hour the right spirit to combat the
[1:08:55] antichrist
[1:08:55] if jesus would have fought back he
[1:08:57] wouldn't have been jesus
[1:09:00] because what's jesus doing he's walking
[1:09:02] in full surrender to the word
[1:09:04] what the word says you must die he's
[1:09:06] going to die he's not fighting it he's
[1:09:08] not reasoning
[1:09:09] he's not running away and hiding he's
[1:09:11] not hoping that the whole thing will
[1:09:12] blow over
[1:09:13] he's facing it like an ox
[1:09:17] because he's got the ox anointing upon
[1:09:18] him but peter
[1:09:20] peter received seeds of discrepancy all
[1:09:23] the way back when jesus was first
[1:09:24] talking
[1:09:25] and saying that i'll be killed and i'll
[1:09:27] raise again the third day there was a
[1:09:28] seed of discrepancy that dropped into
[1:09:30] peter's heart
[1:09:31] from the antichrist spirit and he
[1:09:33] rebuked the lord and he refused the word
[1:09:35] and he reasoned with it and said you'll
[1:09:36] not be killed and he was rebuked but he
[1:09:38] didn't repent
[1:09:40] and the white horse just changed to the
[1:09:42] red horse in peter's life
[1:09:46] because he took a sword and tried to
[1:09:47] kill
[1:09:50] see he doesn't want to stay on the white
[1:09:51] horse friends something as simple
[1:09:53] as just saying oh lord you're not going
[1:09:55] to die
[1:09:57] turned into peter trying to kill a man
[1:10:00] and jesus under the oxenoin thing picks
[1:10:03] the man's ear up
[1:10:04] or touches his touches his ear and heals
[1:10:06] him
[1:10:10] jesus tells us we see the same story in
[1:10:13] the book of john they come to him he
[1:10:15] says whom do you seek they said jesus he
[1:10:17] says
[1:10:17] i am he and they all fall backwards
[1:10:21] think about this he's demonstrating he
[1:10:23] has the power to smite them all
[1:10:26] dead he has the power to deliver himself
[1:10:28] that's what he told peter put up the
[1:10:30] sword think not that i cannot pray to
[1:10:32] the father and he'll send me 12 legions
[1:10:33] of angels but then how is the word going
[1:10:35] to be fulfilled
[1:10:36] because i have to walk with the word
[1:10:40] the word and the word only but the
[1:10:42] antichrist is constantly trying to stop
[1:10:44] the word
[1:10:46] peter was under an antichrist anointing
[1:10:48] trying to stop
[1:10:49] the word and it looked so good it looked
[1:10:53] like he was defending the lord that he
[1:10:55] was fighting for jesus christ
[1:10:56] he was defending the message of the hour
[1:10:58] against all the hypocrites against all
[1:11:00] the
[1:11:01] right and he had the wrong anointing
[1:11:05] under the wrong spirit and he was trying
[1:11:07] to kill
[1:11:12] see when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:11:15] god will raise a standard against it
[1:11:19] don't fight back he said
[1:11:24] let's look at the second seal paragraph
[1:11:27] 197
[1:11:38] paragraph 197 on page 182 of the seal
[1:11:41] book
[1:11:48] that's the same thing today haven't you
[1:11:50] heard these old devils come say if you
[1:11:52] believe
[1:11:52] in divine healing here's somebody's eye
[1:11:54] won't you open their eyes
[1:11:56] smite me blind smite me blind that's the
[1:11:58] same old devil
[1:11:59] come down off the cross we would believe
[1:12:01] you if you be the son of god turn these
[1:12:02] stones in the bread same devil
[1:12:05] you just walk away see
[1:12:08] don't fight back you just walk away see
[1:12:12] no
[1:12:12] that's the way jesus did it he never
[1:12:14] clowned for any of them
[1:12:16] put a rag over over his hand over his
[1:12:19] precious eyes like that
[1:12:21] and they took a stick and they hit him
[1:12:22] on top the head said tell us
[1:12:24] if you're a prophet now tell us who hit
[1:12:26] you they changed the stick one to
[1:12:28] another
[1:12:28] now tell us who hit you and we'll
[1:12:30] believe you're a prophet he never opened
[1:12:32] his mouth
[1:12:33] he just sat there see he don't clown he
[1:12:36] just does as the father says you see
[1:12:38] lets them go ahead their time is coming
[1:12:41] don't worry
[1:12:42] yes sir now they touch this garment they
[1:12:44] left no they felt no virtue
[1:12:46] so he's saying they're beating jesus
[1:12:48] jesus knows who's beating him
[1:12:51] they're putting a rag over his eyes and
[1:12:53] mocking him you're a prophet tell us
[1:12:54] who's hit you
[1:12:55] he knows but he doesn't speak a word
[1:12:57] because he's under the ox anointing
[1:12:59] he's bearing down under the burden amen
[1:13:02] he's sacrificing his life
[1:13:04] why because that's what the word calls
[1:13:06] for
[1:13:09] in the second seal he talks about people
[1:13:11] making fun of the christians he says
[1:13:12] they
[1:13:13] that's what they say while you bunch of
[1:13:14] holy rollers why
[1:13:16] you got you get he says you bunch of
[1:13:18] holy rollers and now brother
[1:13:19] says why we get the world
[1:13:22] the meek shall inherit
[1:13:25] the world that's what jesus said
[1:13:30] we don't have to fight back
[1:13:35] let's go to genesis i want to start
[1:13:37] showing the progression of the seals
[1:13:40] so we can see that these seals unlock
[1:13:42] the mystery of the whole bible
[1:13:45] genesis chapter 3.
[1:13:48] this is after the woman's deceived she
[1:13:50] gives also to the man
[1:13:52] and then we're going to pick up that
[1:13:53] story here in verse 6 chapter 3 verse 6.
[1:13:57] and when the women sold that the tree
[1:13:58] was good for food and then it was
[1:14:00] pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be
[1:14:01] desired to make one wise
[1:14:03] she took of the fruit thereof and did
[1:14:05] eat and gave also into her husband with
[1:14:07] her and he did eat
[1:14:08] and the eyes of them both were open and
[1:14:10] they knew that they were naked and they
[1:14:12] sewed fig leaves together
[1:14:14] and made themselves aprons and they
[1:14:16] heard the voice of the lord god walking
[1:14:18] in the garden in the cool of the day
[1:14:19] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[1:14:21] from the presence of the lord god
[1:14:23] amongst the trees of the garden
[1:14:25] you know why when you begin to deviate
[1:14:27] from the word it's hard to come to
[1:14:28] church
[1:14:30] this is it right here they had disobeyed
[1:14:33] the word of god they had deviated and
[1:14:35] now it's hard
[1:14:36] to come to church it's hard to listen to
[1:14:39] the message
[1:14:40] it's hard to read the books it's hard
[1:14:43] why because you've broken fellowship
[1:14:47] it's broken fellowship and now here they
[1:14:50] are in broken fellowship why
[1:14:52] because of the lie of the white horse
[1:14:55] the power the anointing of the white
[1:14:57] horse sowing a seed of discrepancy
[1:14:59] just something that looked good but it
[1:15:01] wasn't good looked innocent wasn't
[1:15:03] innocent
[1:15:03] and they sowed that seed of discrepancy
[1:15:05] and they received what came from the
[1:15:07] white horse
[1:15:07] and now they're in broken fellowship
[1:15:09] with god
[1:15:14] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[1:15:16] from the presence of the lord god
[1:15:17] amongst the trees of the garden
[1:15:18] and the lord god called him to adam and
[1:15:20] said unto him where art thou
[1:15:22] and he said i heard thy voice in the
[1:15:23] garden and i was afraid because i was
[1:15:25] naked and i hid myself
[1:15:27] and he said who told thee thou was naked
[1:15:29] now here's the question
[1:15:31] who told thee that i was naked hast thou
[1:15:34] eaten of the tree wherewith i commanded
[1:15:35] thee that thou shall does not eat
[1:15:37] and the man said the woman
[1:15:40] gave me and i did eat and the lord said
[1:15:43] unto the woman
[1:15:44] what is this that thou has done so he
[1:15:46] asked her what have you done
[1:15:48] and the woman said the serpent beguiled
[1:15:51] me
[1:15:52] here we've just changed from white horse
[1:15:54] to red horse
[1:15:57] now there's strife amongst the family of
[1:15:59] god
[1:16:00] what used to be perfect harmony in the
[1:16:02] garden of eden all the beasts were in
[1:16:04] harmony with adam and the woman
[1:16:06] and the man and the woman were in
[1:16:07] perfect harmony from one another amen
[1:16:09] they were in perfect harmony with the
[1:16:11] serpent
[1:16:11] everything was in perfect harmony there
[1:16:13] was no strife no malice no wars no
[1:16:16] rumorings no backbitings none of those
[1:16:18] things they weren't there
[1:16:19] until after the white horse came in and
[1:16:22] when they accepted the white horse
[1:16:23] he changes horses and he goes right to
[1:16:25] division and strife
[1:16:28] because his job is to take peace
[1:16:31] from the earth his job is to take peace
[1:16:33] from your earth
[1:16:35] his job is to take peace from your
[1:16:37] family from your home between you and
[1:16:39] your children between you and your wife
[1:16:41] between you and your brothers and
[1:16:42] sisters in the church that's the red
[1:16:44] horse anointing
[1:16:46] whenever there's strife and conflict
[1:16:48] that's the influence of the red horse
[1:16:50] until we begin to fight he says when you
[1:16:52] bite one another be careful lest you be
[1:16:54] consumed
[1:16:56] one of another
[1:16:59] immediately the white horse switches to
[1:17:02] the red horse
[1:17:04] adam who told you you were naked that
[1:17:07] woman
[1:17:10] woman what has thou done that serpent
[1:17:13] from harmony to war
[1:17:17] instantly you want to know why there's
[1:17:19] strife in your home
[1:17:21] go find where the white horse come in
[1:17:24] go back and find where the white horse
[1:17:26] has come in and led the compromise
[1:17:28] compromise will come to strife and when
[1:17:30] you come to strife
[1:17:32] amen you have to recognize that there's
[1:17:34] only one power in the world that will
[1:17:36] ever break the power of the red horse
[1:17:40] that's the anointing of the ox because
[1:17:43] you can never fight the red horse with
[1:17:45] the red horse
[1:17:47] if you fight the red horse with the red
[1:17:48] horse then antichrist wins
[1:17:51] but the only way to break the power of
[1:17:53] the red horse anointing
[1:17:55] is with the ox anointing the red horse
[1:17:57] come against jesus christ to kill him
[1:17:59] he took the ox anointing and under the
[1:18:01] ox anointing he completely broke the
[1:18:04] power of the red horse anointing
[1:18:06] to a now in the church ages they would
[1:18:08] give their lives willingly and freely
[1:18:10] and with joy
[1:18:10] they would make a sacrifice of
[1:18:12] themselves why because the the sacrifice
[1:18:14] that went before them had broke the
[1:18:15] power of the red horse
[1:18:17] and now the red horse had no power over
[1:18:19] them
[1:18:20] and now they would give their lives in
[1:18:22] the dark ages
[1:18:23] through persecution they would give them
[1:18:25] willingly they would give it freely
[1:18:27] why because i've already overcome
[1:18:29] because that was the anointing that was
[1:18:31] on the age
[1:18:31] and that was the power that would break
[1:18:33] the power of the red horse
[1:18:36] remember under that anointing the church
[1:18:38] was growing
[1:18:42] the church wasn't supposed to start an
[1:18:43] army they weren't supposed to get a
[1:18:45] militia
[1:18:45] they weren't supposed to go join
[1:18:46] themselves with another government to
[1:18:48] deliver themselves
[1:18:49] they were supposed the seed was supposed
[1:18:51] to go into the ground and die
[1:18:52] they were under an anointing and that
[1:18:54] anointing was to give their lives for
[1:18:56] the gospel
[1:18:57] amen and it was breaking the power of
[1:18:59] the red horse
[1:19:01] if they had aligned themselves with the
[1:19:02] government if they had found themselves
[1:19:04] a militia or got a bunch of armaments
[1:19:06] and trained for war
[1:19:07] they would have been the red horse
[1:19:08] fighting the red horse
[1:19:13] somebody has to take the auxinoid thing
[1:19:18] if there's red horse in your home and
[1:19:20] every day it's strife
[1:19:22] and conflict and war and fighting
[1:19:24] somebody has got to take the red horse
[1:19:26] anointing
[1:19:28] somebody's got to become a sacrificial
[1:19:30] animal somebody's got to lay down their
[1:19:32] life
[1:19:32] when they lay down their life it's going
[1:19:34] to break the power of the red horse
[1:19:38] because when the enemy comes in like a
[1:19:39] flood god raises a standard
[1:19:41] against it to combat it he said
[1:19:45] so how did he combat the red horse with
[1:19:47] the ox
[1:19:50] hallelujah you see now
[1:19:54] where white horse always moves to red
[1:19:56] horse
[1:19:57] cane came under the influence of the
[1:20:00] white horse the antichrist
[1:20:02] he tries to produce a substitute
[1:20:04] different than what revelation would
[1:20:06] have given him
[1:20:08] so he comes up with a beautiful altar
[1:20:09] with a beautiful sacrifice
[1:20:11] that took a lot of work he labored for a
[1:20:14] long time to
[1:20:15] to plant the fields and to produce the
[1:20:17] flowers and to produce the vegetables
[1:20:19] and
[1:20:20] he worked and he labored and he worked
[1:20:22] and he labored and he was doing
[1:20:23] according to his own intellect according
[1:20:25] to his own mind
[1:20:26] he was going to worship the lord the way
[1:20:28] that he thought it was the best way to
[1:20:30] worship the lord
[1:20:33] but god doesn't want worship the way you
[1:20:35] think you should worship the lord
[1:20:36] he wants worshipped according to
[1:20:37] revelation of the true word
[1:20:39] that's the way he receives worship and
[1:20:41] that's the way when abel
[1:20:43] abel didn't work abel didn't labor abel
[1:20:45] had a requirement and the requirement
[1:20:47] was blood he had to bring a lamb
[1:20:49] and he had to kill it he had a work to
[1:20:50] do but his work was based on revelation
[1:20:54] he wasn't saved by his works he was
[1:20:55] saved by revelation his works was
[1:20:57] evidence that he had faith
[1:21:01] so his works taking a lamb and slaying
[1:21:03] it was
[1:21:04] evidence that he received the revelation
[1:21:06] of what it took to be free
[1:21:08] a substitute offering cain received no
[1:21:10] revelation so cain
[1:21:11] is working and laboring and producing
[1:21:14] something that the
[1:21:15] the antichrist spirit is telling him
[1:21:16] this is good this is beautiful
[1:21:18] look it's it it'll make you wise you
[1:21:21] look wise you look intelligent producing
[1:21:23] this
[1:21:25] it's beautiful it's desirable it's all
[1:21:27] the same thing that he fell by
[1:21:30] he produces this and it's not accepted
[1:21:35] abel waits for revelation from the lord
[1:21:37] and he gets revelation on the eternal
[1:21:39] word that never changes
[1:21:42] see because the lamb was slain before
[1:21:43] the foundation of the world
[1:21:45] but god wrote his bible before there was
[1:21:48] ever paper in ink
[1:21:51] this was already written this was
[1:21:53] already word that word is unchangeable
[1:21:55] that word is eternal
[1:21:56] and that word will never change and so
[1:21:58] abel had to wait for revelation of the
[1:22:00] word that was already
[1:22:02] written to tell him how to overcome his
[1:22:03] situation and the only way that he could
[1:22:05] overcome it was by the blood of an
[1:22:07] innocent lamb
[1:22:09] because that was already written in the
[1:22:11] word of god before moses ever penned it
[1:22:16] hallelujah we didn't get our bible over
[1:22:19] the last
[1:22:20] 6 000 years we've had a bible before
[1:22:22] there was a earth there was a bible
[1:22:27] when he set the stars in the heaven he
[1:22:29] wrote the bible
[1:22:30] amen before he wrote the bible it was
[1:22:32] complete in his mind
[1:22:34] amen it's we're just now coming to
[1:22:36] what's always been
[1:22:38] we're just now learning what he's always
[1:22:39] known and what he's always desired and
[1:22:41] what he's always wanted we're just now
[1:22:43] stepping into what's always been a
[1:22:45] reality
[1:22:48] so now abel has to come that way
[1:22:51] by revelation of the word he comes by
[1:22:53] revelation of the word
[1:22:54] and his sacrifice is accepted why he
[1:22:57] comes
[1:22:58] under the lion anointing the pure
[1:23:02] word hallelujah
[1:23:06] how did paul get it by revelation how
[1:23:08] did abel get it by revelation
[1:23:10] what was it the pure word
[1:23:13] so with the lion anointing he offers the
[1:23:15] sacrifice he's accepted
[1:23:17] now cain is wrath why is he angry
[1:23:22] because he's moving to red horse
[1:23:24] anointing
[1:23:25] antichrist is changing his tactics
[1:23:27] changing his power
[1:23:29] he's leaving innocency he's leaving i
[1:23:31] can't hurt you he's leaving it's just an
[1:23:33] idea it's just a way to worship it's
[1:23:35] just a nice plan
[1:23:37] and he's moving into wrath
[1:23:41] god comes to cain and says just do as
[1:23:43] abel does and will it not be well with
[1:23:45] thee
[1:23:47] and then we find out he goes and he has
[1:23:48] a conversation with abel
[1:23:51] and it's not recorded but brother
[1:23:52] branham said it's like a love letter you
[1:23:53] got to read between the lines
[1:23:57] he goes and has a conversation with abel
[1:23:59] and somehow
[1:24:00] during this conversation he becomes so
[1:24:02] angry that he kills abel
[1:24:05] what did abel say
[1:24:08] i'm curious because the whole con
[1:24:11] the whole discussion was why was your
[1:24:13] sacrifice of substitution blood
[1:24:18] we accept it and why was mine of works
[1:24:20] of my hand and
[1:24:21] fruit like mama ate an apple
[1:24:26] or there's a problem in the blood
[1:24:31] brother said cain thought that it was an
[1:24:33] apple
[1:24:34] so he thought giving fruits was the
[1:24:36] right sacrifice abel realized that there
[1:24:38] was a problem in the blood
[1:24:41] and he gave blood and so now this
[1:24:45] discussion is all about
[1:24:47] why is mine not accepted and why is
[1:24:49] yours so if abel would have just simply
[1:24:52] childlike gave him the revelation that
[1:24:54] he had of the word
[1:24:55] it would have exposed cain for who he
[1:24:57] was
[1:25:00] and cain got so angry he killed his
[1:25:04] brother
[1:25:05] why did he kill his brother he had moved
[1:25:08] from white horse
[1:25:09] to red horse take peace from the earth
[1:25:13] that they might kill one another
[1:25:15] this just didn't happen in the church
[1:25:16] ages this has always been happening
[1:25:19] this happened in heaven before it came
[1:25:21] to earth he's exposing the tactics of
[1:25:24] the devil he's exposing his battle
[1:25:26] plan he's exploding the riding path of
[1:25:27] the horse rider so that we can see him
[1:25:29] and resist him and stand against him and
[1:25:31] we know exactly how to stand against if
[1:25:33] you stand just like abel
[1:25:35] abel didn't fight back he gave up his
[1:25:37] life
[1:25:39] brother branham said he died on the
[1:25:41] altar with his sacrifice
[1:25:45] hallelujah that's our example friends
[1:25:50] follow every pattern in the bible and
[1:25:52] you'll follow this pattern of the
[1:25:54] of of the horse riders and the four
[1:25:56] living creatures
[1:25:58] i want to look at one more before we go
[1:26:00] let's look at numbers together
[1:26:04] we can go everywhere we can find this
[1:26:06] everywhere
[1:26:07] we're just going to look in the book of
[1:26:09] numbers
[1:26:21] numbers chapter 20.
[1:26:31] numbers chapter 20 verse 2.
[1:26:36] and there was no water for the
[1:26:37] congregation and they gathered
[1:26:38] themselves together against moses and
[1:26:40] against aaron
[1:26:42] and the people chode with moses and
[1:26:44] spake saying would god that we had died
[1:26:46] with our brethren died before the lord
[1:26:48] and why have you brought up the
[1:26:50] congregation of the lord into this
[1:26:52] wilderness
[1:26:53] that we and our cattle should die there
[1:26:56] and therefore have you made us to come
[1:26:57] up out of egypt to bring us into this
[1:26:59] evil place
[1:27:00] it is no place of seed or figs or vines
[1:27:03] or pomegranates
[1:27:04] neither is there any water to drink so
[1:27:06] here we have
[1:27:08] a pretty bad situation for moses the
[1:27:11] congregation gathers together there's no
[1:27:12] water
[1:27:13] and they start chiding against him again
[1:27:14] they've done this multiple times
[1:27:16] and here they come why did you lead us
[1:27:18] out this isn't a place of pomegranates
[1:27:20] and water and all these things that you
[1:27:21] talked about
[1:27:22] why did you bring us out of egypt why
[1:27:24] did you why did you why did you
[1:27:25] and moses is saying all i ever did was
[1:27:28] what the lord said
[1:27:30] moses is walking in pure obedience
[1:27:34] to the word that's all he's doing
[1:27:37] he's not doing anything the word's doing
[1:27:39] it through him
[1:27:41] he's not leading them the pillar of fire
[1:27:42] is leading them he's not making
[1:27:44] decisions the lord's making decisions
[1:27:46] he's being led by the word and when he's
[1:27:48] being led by the word
[1:27:49] now they're attacking him for following
[1:27:51] the word
[1:27:53] and they're blaming him for all their
[1:27:55] problems just like people like to blame
[1:27:57] the message for their children going
[1:27:59] into the world
[1:28:00] they like to blame brother branham for
[1:28:01] the breakup of their marriage
[1:28:03] it isn't brother branham's fault it
[1:28:04] isn't the message fault it's your own
[1:28:06] disobedience to the word of god that
[1:28:08] caused it
[1:28:10] you have let the white horse deceive you
[1:28:12] in doing something other than the word
[1:28:14] amen and it's caused destruction in your
[1:28:15] life destruction in your family
[1:28:17] it's not the message's fault and just
[1:28:19] because there was a man who
[1:28:20] misrepresented the message don't blame
[1:28:22] brother branham and don't believe jesus
[1:28:24] christ
[1:28:24] because the message is jesus christ and
[1:28:27] the minute you say it's the message is
[1:28:28] fall you're saying it's jesus christ's
[1:28:30] fault
[1:28:30] because when you say why did you why did
[1:28:32] you why did you if it was done according
[1:28:34] to the word
[1:28:35] you're pointing your finger right at god
[1:28:39] you have to be careful about the way we
[1:28:40] speak with our mouths
[1:28:46] hallelujah
[1:28:49] so moses in obedience to the word comes
[1:28:52] to strife
[1:28:54] they come against him verse 6 and moses
[1:28:56] and aaron went from the presence of the
[1:28:58] assembly into the door of the tabernacle
[1:29:00] of the congregation
[1:29:01] and they fell upon their faces and the
[1:29:03] glory of the lord appeared unto them
[1:29:05] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[1:29:07] take the rod and gather thou the
[1:29:09] assembly together
[1:29:10] thou and heir and thy brother and speak
[1:29:12] ye unto the rock before their eyes
[1:29:14] and that shall give forth his water and
[1:29:15] thou shalt bring forth
[1:29:17] to them water out of the rock so thou
[1:29:20] shalt give the congregation in their
[1:29:22] beast drink
[1:29:23] and moses took the rod from before the
[1:29:25] lord as he commanded him
[1:29:27] and moses and aaron gathered the
[1:29:28] congregation together before the rock
[1:29:30] and he said unto him here now ye rebels
[1:29:33] must we fetch you water out of this rock
[1:29:35] and moses lifted up his hand and with
[1:29:37] his rod he smote the rock twice and the
[1:29:39] water came out abundantly
[1:29:40] and the congregation drank and their
[1:29:42] beast also and the lord spake unto moses
[1:29:45] and aaron
[1:29:46] because you believe me not
[1:29:49] to sanctify me in the eyes of the
[1:29:50] children of israel therefore you shall
[1:29:52] not bring this congregation into the
[1:29:54] land
[1:29:55] which i have given you what did moses do
[1:29:58] that was so wrong
[1:30:01] moses took the red horse anointing
[1:30:07] every other time that they would come
[1:30:09] against moses
[1:30:12] god would say separate yourself
[1:30:15] i'm going to destroy them and start over
[1:30:17] with you they'd come to moses why have
[1:30:19] they let us out here we're gonna die out
[1:30:21] here
[1:30:22] why have you brought us out here that
[1:30:23] our children will die and and god would
[1:30:25] go to moses
[1:30:26] or moses would go to god and god would
[1:30:28] say separate yourself i'm gonna smite
[1:30:29] them and what did moses do
[1:30:31] moses would throw himself in the breach
[1:30:35] and brother branham said that was the
[1:30:37] spirit of christ
[1:30:38] in moses he said i used to say
[1:30:41] how is it his brother remember used to
[1:30:43] be confused by this passage of scripture
[1:30:45] you say how is it that that moses could
[1:30:48] give god a better idea
[1:30:50] when god said i'm going to smite him
[1:30:52] kill him and start over
[1:30:53] and moses said no don't and the lord
[1:30:55] repented himself from what he was going
[1:30:56] to do
[1:30:57] how is it that moses could change the
[1:30:59] lord's mind
[1:31:02] because it wasn't it was not changing
[1:31:04] his mind
[1:31:05] it was coming to his original thought
[1:31:10] he was testing moses
[1:31:13] because why there had to be be a display
[1:31:16] of the life of christ god had to say he
[1:31:20] would destroy the people so moses could
[1:31:22] throw himself in the gap
[1:31:24] and he took the spirit of christ again
[1:31:26] and again
[1:31:28] and again but moses had finally had
[1:31:31] enough
[1:31:32] they come against him and he said ye
[1:31:34] rebels
[1:31:37] now he's fighting back
[1:31:41] and when moses fights back it keeps him
[1:31:44] out of the promised land
[1:31:48] let's read another passage in
[1:31:49] deuteronomy
[1:31:51] let's go to deuteronomy 27.
[1:31:57] deuteronomy 27 verse 12.
[1:32:06] in deuteronomy our numbers i'm sorry i'm
[1:32:08] i told you wrong numbers not deuteronomy
[1:32:11] numbers 27 verse 12
[1:32:15] and the lord said unto moses get thee up
[1:32:17] unto this mount abram
[1:32:19] and see the land which i have given unto
[1:32:21] the children of israel
[1:32:23] and when thou has seen it thou also
[1:32:25] shall be gathered into thy people as
[1:32:27] aaron thy brother was gathered
[1:32:28] for ye rebelled against my commandment
[1:32:30] in the desert of zen in the strife of
[1:32:32] the congregation
[1:32:34] to sanctify me at the water before their
[1:32:35] eyes that is the water
[1:32:37] of meribah and kadesh in the wilderness
[1:32:39] of sin
[1:32:41] this word meribah the waters of maribel
[1:32:44] means
[1:32:44] strife in the waters of strife
[1:32:49] this is why moses was kept out of the
[1:32:52] promised land
[1:32:53] let's go to psalms we're going to it's
[1:32:55] going to become even more apparent in
[1:32:56] psalms psalms 106.
[1:33:00] psalms 106 verse 32.
[1:33:05] in psalms 106 verse 32 says they angered
[1:33:08] him also at the waters of strife
[1:33:10] so that he went ill with moses for their
[1:33:13] sakes
[1:33:15] because they provoked his spirit so that
[1:33:17] he spake
[1:33:18] unadvisedly with his lips
[1:33:22] to catch that why was moses kept out of
[1:33:25] the promised land
[1:33:26] they provoked him they provoked him
[1:33:31] they angered him also at the waters of
[1:33:33] strife meribah
[1:33:35] so that it went ill with moses for their
[1:33:37] sakes
[1:33:38] because of them their strife it went bad
[1:33:40] for moses why
[1:33:42] because moses was supposed to take the
[1:33:45] anointing of christ
[1:33:47] and he took the anointing of antichrist
[1:33:51] because they provoked his spirit so that
[1:33:54] he spoke
[1:33:54] unadvisedly with his lips
[1:34:04] brother branham said in the second seal
[1:34:05] he rose up in the time of moses you know
[1:34:08] how they did and wanted to say well
[1:34:10] you're not the only holy one in the
[1:34:11] bunch
[1:34:12] and nathan and core and god said just
[1:34:14] separate yourselves i'll just
[1:34:15] up the earth and swallow them you see
[1:34:17] then the people got to complaining
[1:34:19] i'll just take the whole thing away and
[1:34:20] there moses took the place of christ
[1:34:22] then to throw himself in the breach and
[1:34:24] say
[1:34:24] don't do it lord of course after he'd
[1:34:27] ordained moses to do this he didn't come
[1:34:29] over moses
[1:34:30] because he was acting like christ in
[1:34:32] that time it was christ
[1:34:34] in moses see brother brown tells us the
[1:34:37] story
[1:34:38] of elisha and the she bears
[1:34:41] when those children were they were they
[1:34:43] were making fun and mocking elijah and
[1:34:45] elisha called for
[1:34:46] two she-bears to come out of the
[1:34:47] wilderness and kill the children
[1:34:50] and it was because of the disrespect of
[1:34:52] their parents for the servant of god
[1:34:53] and they began to sow seeds of
[1:34:55] discrepancy and just saying things
[1:34:57] against elijah
[1:34:58] and elisha now in his anger against that
[1:35:01] he takes the wrong anointing and brother
[1:35:02] branham said that wasn't the spirit of
[1:35:04] christ
[1:35:06] he said he was wrong moses
[1:35:09] he said things out of his lips that was
[1:35:11] unadvisable
[1:35:13] unadvisedly spoke out of his lips and it
[1:35:16] kept him from the promised land
[1:35:18] elijah he did this and he shouldn't have
[1:35:20] done it and brother branham
[1:35:22] the lord comes to brother benjamin said
[1:35:23] there's a trap for you tonight
[1:35:27] what's the trap the trap while he's
[1:35:29] preaching he realizes there's two
[1:35:31] a young couple and a boy and a girl down
[1:35:32] sitting in the front and they're making
[1:35:34] out and they're making a scene and
[1:35:36] making a mockery of christianity and
[1:35:38] it's upsetting the prophet amen
[1:35:40] and they just won't stop and they just
[1:35:42] won't stop and they just won't stop
[1:35:44] and finally the lord tells him whatever
[1:35:46] you say
[1:35:49] he could smite them dead they could have
[1:35:52] all manner of diseases whatever judgment
[1:35:54] he wants to judge them with he can judge
[1:35:56] him he's getting upset
[1:35:57] he's asking to stop they won't stop
[1:35:59] they're causing a disruption
[1:36:00] he's being upset in the spirit and the
[1:36:02] lord said whatever you say
[1:36:04] and he looked at them and says i forgive
[1:36:08] you
[1:36:10] why moses had failed elisha had failed
[1:36:13] but here he comes amen after after we
[1:36:16] received
[1:36:17] the atonement under jesus christ after
[1:36:19] he come and received the holy ghost the
[1:36:21] spirit of christ
[1:36:22] now he looks down and he says i forgive
[1:36:24] you
[1:36:26] brother man comes to a message i'd like
[1:36:27] for you to listen to it if you can call
[1:36:29] standing in the gap
[1:36:30] and the whole message is about this
[1:36:32] standing in the gap and he finds out
[1:36:34] i got upset with the people i was angry
[1:36:38] with them because i thought they should
[1:36:39] have received the message he preaches
[1:36:40] after the seals and they've rejected the
[1:36:43] seals and he says
[1:36:44] i was calling them rickies and requettas
[1:36:48] and god give me to understand that i
[1:36:50] shouldn't do that
[1:36:52] i lost the feeling for the people what
[1:36:55] is this
[1:36:56] he wasn't wanting to stand in the gap
[1:36:58] anymore he wasn't wanting to lay in the
[1:37:00] breach
[1:37:00] he wasn't wanting to take the ox
[1:37:02] anointing for the people anymore
[1:37:04] he was upset he was angry he felt like
[1:37:06] they had rejected him he felt like they
[1:37:08] should have heard the message
[1:37:09] and god comes and rebukes him
[1:37:13] he's driving down the road and he's
[1:37:16] having these thoughts of i'm just going
[1:37:17] to be like an old testament prophet i'm
[1:37:19] going to go off into the wilderness and
[1:37:20] i'm going to stomp out
[1:37:22] this is a man under hurt feelings
[1:37:26] i'm going to stomp out and deliver my
[1:37:27] message and go back
[1:37:29] and he said that was just an excuse so i
[1:37:30] could finish it hunt
[1:37:32] and do what i wanted
[1:37:36] and he said he sees all of a sudden
[1:37:39] there's two bums eating next to them
[1:37:40] they get up
[1:37:42] and one of them looks like fletcher broy
[1:37:44] hill his his brother-in-law
[1:37:47] and it's him brother bram sees himself
[1:37:49] as a bomb with
[1:37:50] his brother-in-law fletcher roy hill
[1:37:52] who's a bomb living on the streets
[1:37:55] and he sees them together and even billy
[1:37:57] paul says dad that looks like you and
[1:37:59] fletch
[1:38:01] and they guys pay and they leave brother
[1:38:03] branham's driving down the road and
[1:38:05] billy paul falls asleep and the lord
[1:38:06] begins to speak to him
[1:38:08] you go through with your plans you'll be
[1:38:09] just like the bone
[1:38:11] your wife will leave you you'll be a bum
[1:38:15] and brother branham goes through this
[1:38:16] whole thing and he recognizes the lord
[1:38:19] in his mercy shows him a mountain
[1:38:21] range with seven peaks and says your
[1:38:23] name is written in that mountain
[1:38:25] that's your ministry that's a sign
[1:38:27] that's an everlasting sign
[1:38:30] that you're supposed to be doing what
[1:38:32] you're doing
[1:38:33] and brother branham has to repent and he
[1:38:36] comes
[1:38:36] and that's what that's what standing in
[1:38:38] the gap is all about it's all about this
[1:38:40] he says he says i'm like moses moses
[1:38:44] lost the feeling for his people
[1:38:46] and i've lost the feeling for the people
[1:38:50] and he's struggling with this but he
[1:38:53] surrenders
[1:38:55] he repents amen he comes to a place
[1:39:00] brother venom is in the message
[1:39:03] and questions and answers on the seals
[1:39:05] this is just an example
[1:39:07] he says then the fellow here trying to
[1:39:10] debate it once here in the tabernacle
[1:39:12] said brother branham
[1:39:14] was wiggled out of all of them he won't
[1:39:16] he won't this one
[1:39:17] said he's talking about the godhead and
[1:39:19] this man is debating with brother
[1:39:21] branham and the tabernacle
[1:39:22] here it shows three different persons
[1:39:24] exactly perfectly said matthew third
[1:39:26] chapter here was john standing
[1:39:27] preaching here come the son walking up
[1:39:29] to be baptized he went in the water and
[1:39:31] was baptized by john
[1:39:32] went back out of the water and low he
[1:39:33] said the heavens was open unto him and
[1:39:35] he said down from the heaven came the
[1:39:36] holy ghost like a dub descending
[1:39:38] and the voice from heaven saying this is
[1:39:40] my beloved son
[1:39:41] the three distinct persons right at one
[1:39:44] oh my
[1:39:45] you know it just goes to show that
[1:39:47] people without the baptism and not
[1:39:48] called to the officers of the minister
[1:39:50] has no business to be in the pulpit
[1:39:52] that's right i could take that person
[1:39:53] now by the help of god and tie them in
[1:39:55] such a knot
[1:39:56] it take and make their head swim look i
[1:39:58] don't care what
[1:40:00] he pauses he says now i don't mean that
[1:40:04] now that don't sound right forgive me i
[1:40:06] didn't mean that lord
[1:40:10] i didn't know i felt him check me on
[1:40:13] that
[1:40:15] so i didn't mean to say it that way i'm
[1:40:18] sorry
[1:40:18] i believe that the holy spirit could
[1:40:20] reveal to the person some secret that
[1:40:22] sounds
[1:40:22] better that sounds better
[1:40:26] he wouldn't take the red horse anointing
[1:40:30] he wouldn't fight back when somebody
[1:40:33] railed against him
[1:40:34] now don't don't be mistaken the ox
[1:40:37] anointing is no weak anointing
[1:40:41] brother branham was death on sin
[1:40:45] he would stand in the pulpit and he
[1:40:47] would rip the height off of the devil
[1:40:49] night after night after night you can
[1:40:51] strive with the devil you can fight with
[1:40:53] spirits you can call out sin
[1:40:55] but the moment he went to a person god
[1:40:57] rebuked him
[1:40:59] you don't go after people
[1:41:03] jesus comes and he's laying out the word
[1:41:05] he's laying out the principles
[1:41:07] and he says you can't receive me because
[1:41:08] you're not part of me because i come
[1:41:09] from the word and he's laying this out
[1:41:11] and and they ask him a question he gives
[1:41:13] them the word they ask him a question
[1:41:14] they give him the word
[1:41:15] when the pharisees and sadducees ran out
[1:41:17] of word they started calling him names
[1:41:21] you're bl's above you have a devil
[1:41:22] you're mad you're illegitimate born they
[1:41:25] called him every name but why
[1:41:26] they were destroying his character they
[1:41:29] went to character brother ben said
[1:41:31] there's more than one way
[1:41:32] to kill a man you don't have to stick a
[1:41:33] knife in his back to kill him you run
[1:41:34] down his character and hurt his
[1:41:36] influence it's the same as killing him
[1:41:39] what were they doing to jesus they were
[1:41:41] killing his influence running down his
[1:41:42] character
[1:41:43] amen the same thing that happens in
[1:41:45] churches all the time same thing that
[1:41:47] happens amongst ministry all the time
[1:41:48] what is it it's nothing but the red
[1:41:50] horse anointing
[1:41:53] trying to kill taking away peace so that
[1:41:56] they kill one another
[1:41:58] you kill their influence you attack
[1:41:59] their character brother brenham said
[1:42:01] you're guilty of it
[1:42:07] they ran out of word and when they run
[1:42:09] out of the word they went to name
[1:42:10] calling
[1:42:12] but jesus never went back to name
[1:42:14] calling
[1:42:15] he would call out their condition no
[1:42:17] problem that's in the word he'd lay out
[1:42:18] the scriptures
[1:42:19] he would tell him who he was but he
[1:42:21] wouldn't resort to name-calling
[1:42:24] brother branham wouldn't resort to
[1:42:26] name-calling he had
[1:42:28] one name that was ricky and rickett and
[1:42:29] he was told not to say that no more
[1:42:32] amen we're not to name corn
[1:42:36] we're not to attack people we have
[1:42:39] nothing against people
[1:42:40] brother branham said it's the system not
[1:42:43] the people
[1:42:44] it's the devil on the people when jesus
[1:42:46] turned around he looked at peter
[1:42:48] it wasn't peter it was satan he said
[1:42:51] satan get thee behind me
[1:42:53] it was the devil that we're fighting
[1:42:55] it's the enemy it's the antichrist that
[1:42:57] we're against
[1:42:58] it's the system that we're against but
[1:43:00] never the people
[1:43:01] the moment we go to fighting people we
[1:43:04] are under a red horse anointing
[1:43:08] look at every false doctrine that swept
[1:43:10] through the message
[1:43:13] starts off in an innocency
[1:43:17] we just have a thought we're just
[1:43:19] talking about this we have an idea
[1:43:21] maybe it could be maybe this is
[1:43:25] this i'm just saying maybe what if it is
[1:43:29] and then they begin to accept it and
[1:43:30] it's something that brother rem didn't
[1:43:32] say
[1:43:32] it's a deception it's off the word in
[1:43:34] some way it's counter to the scripture
[1:43:36] in some way
[1:43:37] and now we'll take it and now we believe
[1:43:39] it and now you put a crown
[1:43:41] on his head then he changes horses
[1:43:45] and and every time
[1:43:48] he goes to take peace from brethren
[1:43:52] there's one thing god said there's an
[1:43:53] abomination and that abomination is he
[1:43:56] that soweth discord among brethren is an
[1:43:57] abomination
[1:44:00] and then it's always been an abomination
[1:44:01] and always will be an abomination you
[1:44:03] can't change things that are an
[1:44:05] abomination
[1:44:06] just like it's an abomination for men to
[1:44:08] wear a parallel pertaining to a woman
[1:44:10] or a woman to wear apparel or pertaining
[1:44:11] to a man or for man to lie with a woman
[1:44:13] as man
[1:44:14] or a man as a woman those are all
[1:44:15] abominations those are abominations that
[1:44:18] never change
[1:44:19] so is he that will so strife amongst
[1:44:21] brethren is the same kind of abomination
[1:44:25] why because the red horse comes with a
[1:44:27] sword to take peace
[1:44:30] that they kill one another and you can't
[1:44:33] you can't say well it was that doctrine
[1:44:36] and them and that and that
[1:44:37] oh my goodness if you think you've been
[1:44:39] standing in truth you're just as guilty
[1:44:41] we are all just as guilty
[1:44:44] what causes most of the problems with
[1:44:46] false doctrine
[1:44:48] i'll tell you right now instead of
[1:44:51] sitting down and saying brother
[1:44:52] let's talk about this show me what
[1:44:55] you're seeing
[1:44:56] i don't understand let's talk about this
[1:44:58] well i don't agree there but i still
[1:45:00] love you brother and
[1:45:01] i can't see it let's pray for one
[1:45:02] another let's get back together and talk
[1:45:04] but immediately when something would
[1:45:06] come that sounds different immediately
[1:45:08] we'd
[1:45:08] fight against it
[1:45:12] that don't sound right and immediately
[1:45:14] we put it down and
[1:45:15] start into character defamation
[1:45:19] well you're surprised you don't believe
[1:45:21] the message you're off the word blah
[1:45:22] blah blah blah blah
[1:45:25] now you can attack the doctrine
[1:45:29] you can attack the spirit but you can't
[1:45:31] speak against the person
[1:45:36] most of the problems we've had are
[1:45:38] self-inflicted
[1:45:40] if we were to take the ox anointing when
[1:45:42] the red came
[1:45:43] most of these false doctrines would have
[1:45:44] never set up into a separate camp
[1:45:47] the thing would have washed its way out
[1:45:48] but what caused it was the division and
[1:45:50] now we've got to fight against this and
[1:45:52] fight against this
[1:45:52] instead of just stopping and waiting for
[1:45:54] the spirit to reveal it we begin
[1:45:56] fighting in strife and it's an
[1:45:58] abomination against god and it's nothing
[1:46:00] but
[1:46:00] the anointing of the antichrist spirit
[1:46:02] in the message
[1:46:06] because that's where he's trying to
[1:46:07] bring deception is wherever god's throne
[1:46:09] is
[1:46:10] wherever god is working wherever god is
[1:46:12] that's where he wants to be
[1:46:16] happens in your home let's say
[1:46:20] let's say let's say a man we'll just say
[1:46:23] it this way
[1:46:25] let's say a man goes and buys a bass
[1:46:27] boat
[1:46:28] right there's nothing wrong with a bass
[1:46:30] boot
[1:46:31] right he falls in love with his bass
[1:46:34] boat it's not a sin to buy a bastard
[1:46:38] okay
[1:46:40] but his family's not in agreement his
[1:46:42] wife's not so sure
[1:46:44] but it's just such a good idea i'm just
[1:46:46] gonna get this boat
[1:46:48] and he starts laying out on weekends
[1:46:49] fishing
[1:46:51] starts missing church starts being
[1:46:53] separate from his family
[1:46:54] not spending time with his wife and all
[1:46:56] of that
[1:46:57] and now now what started off an
[1:47:00] innocency
[1:47:01] is very quickly going to bring strife
[1:47:03] into the home
[1:47:07] instead of somebody taking the ox
[1:47:09] anointing
[1:47:10] they're both going to take the red and
[1:47:11] red horse anointing and it's going to
[1:47:13] bring a sword and it's going to bring
[1:47:14] division and strife in the home
[1:47:16] because whenever we bring compromise in
[1:47:19] right
[1:47:20] now we have to defend our compromise
[1:47:26] what what if oh
[1:47:29] what if a man decides you know what all
[1:47:32] my life as a kid i grew up
[1:47:34] in and we watch football it's just
[1:47:36] something we do we just watch football
[1:47:38] and i'm not going to get a tv i'm not
[1:47:39] i'm just going to get this
[1:47:41] little whatever i can watch it on
[1:47:44] and then he gets more involved and more
[1:47:46] involved and now
[1:47:48] all day on saturdays watching all the
[1:47:49] games and then when it's bowl season oh
[1:47:52] my goodness you got to watch i
[1:47:53] mean i followed the team all the way
[1:47:54] through
[1:47:56] and then his kids come around and he's
[1:47:58] watching the game and every time the
[1:48:00] commercial comes on he's got to flip the
[1:48:01] device down or tell his kids to leave
[1:48:03] the room
[1:48:05] all right and what's he doing he's
[1:48:07] moving through the white horse
[1:48:10] for a personal desire for compromise
[1:48:14] and he slips in through the white horse
[1:48:17] rider
[1:48:18] and now when his wife comes and tells
[1:48:20] him are you sure that's all right
[1:48:22] what do you mean it's all it's all right
[1:48:24] there's nothing wrong i'm not doing
[1:48:25] anything wrong
[1:48:28] he put a crown on his head and he's
[1:48:31] moving
[1:48:32] i'm just trying to relax i work so hard
[1:48:34] i provide i'm just trying to take some
[1:48:36] time for me
[1:48:39] he's moving from the white horse to the
[1:48:41] red horse
[1:48:43] why when we let compromise in now we
[1:48:46] have to defend
[1:48:47] our compromise because if it's not
[1:48:49] compromised you don't have to defend it
[1:48:52] it stands on its own there's no guilty
[1:48:54] conscience there's no reason to get
[1:48:55] upset
[1:48:56] this is what the word says i'm just
[1:48:57] doing what the bible says
[1:48:59] but when we allow the white horse to
[1:49:01] come in through compromise
[1:49:03] very soon you watch it'll turn into
[1:49:06] strife
[1:49:08] and now you have to take the red horse
[1:49:11] anointing
[1:49:12] to fight for your compromise
[1:49:15] see how subtle the devil is friends
[1:49:18] it's not out there it's not the
[1:49:21] denominations
[1:49:22] it's not the pentecostal system it's two
[1:49:25] vines right here
[1:49:27] it's where the throne of god is he's
[1:49:29] trying to come in and he's trying to
[1:49:31] take
[1:49:31] and he's trying to rule over the sons of
[1:49:33] god he's trying to exalt himself above
[1:49:35] the sons of god
[1:49:36] he's trying to get me to serve him hal
[1:49:40] white horse red horse black horse
[1:49:43] all wound up into the pale horse
[1:49:46] where do you stop him white horse
[1:49:51] the word and the word only
[1:49:56] but it has no arrows it can't hurt me
[1:49:59] seemingly then when you find out there's
[1:50:02] strife in your home
[1:50:04] and there's division and you're
[1:50:06] defending compromise
[1:50:07] and you're against brothers because a
[1:50:09] brother said something to me about my
[1:50:10] compromise
[1:50:11] how dare he judge me they're all judging
[1:50:13] at that church everybody they're up on
[1:50:15] their high horse
[1:50:18] no you're on the red horse friend
[1:50:21] fighting for your compromise hating it
[1:50:24] when the word is exposing your
[1:50:26] compromise
[1:50:26] when the pastor starts to get down to
[1:50:28] compromise there'll be all kinds of
[1:50:30] talking what is it
[1:50:31] sowing seed amongst brethren it's the
[1:50:34] red horse anointing defending our
[1:50:35] compromise
[1:50:36] defending church life i just want to
[1:50:38] come to church i just want to have a
[1:50:39] good
[1:50:39] if i could just have a good church where
[1:50:41] my family could come
[1:50:43] and i could just have a place that's
[1:50:44] safe that i wouldn't get ripped to
[1:50:46] pieces every week if i could just come
[1:50:48] and have a nice church where i could
[1:50:50] come to church and worship god and go
[1:50:51] home
[1:50:52] i would be happy and so would the devil
[1:50:58] that's the words of the antichrist not
[1:51:01] christ
[1:51:02] because mary said be it unto me jesus in
[1:51:04] gethsemane said let it be according to
[1:51:06] your word
[1:51:07] we have to die completely die
[1:51:11] to every thought that's contrary to the
[1:51:13] word completely die to everything that's
[1:51:16] different than the message of the hour
[1:51:18] die die die die paul says
[1:51:21] i die daily
[1:51:25] white horse reasoning against the
[1:51:27] message
[1:51:29] disagreeing with this kind of preaching
[1:51:33] because i just want to have a church to
[1:51:35] go to i just want to have a nice place
[1:51:37] to take my family
[1:51:39] why do we have to hear about this all
[1:51:41] the time because we're exposing the
[1:51:43] devil
[1:51:45] starts white moves red
[1:51:49] after red he goes to black horse
[1:51:52] and we don't have time for the black
[1:51:54] horse today
[1:51:57] brother venom tells a story
[1:52:00] we'll close with this because it's a
[1:52:02] perfect display of the ox anointing
[1:52:05] remember the story tells us the little
[1:52:07] lady who become a christian and had an
[1:52:08] alcoholic husband
[1:52:12] oh my goodness if that don't take the
[1:52:15] height off of you
[1:52:17] nothing will a little woman had an
[1:52:20] alcoholic husband
[1:52:22] and he would lay out and he would drink
[1:52:24] and he would fuss
[1:52:25] and stomp and this woman had a hard time
[1:52:29] brother brenham
[1:52:30] said and one day her husband
[1:52:33] goes down to the bar and he's with his
[1:52:34] friends and they're talking about what
[1:52:36] hypocrites christians are and they smoke
[1:52:38] and they drink do all this and
[1:52:39] they're not there's no real christian
[1:52:41] and the man says there is one
[1:52:44] my wife's a real christian why could he
[1:52:47] say that
[1:52:48] because she wasn't living in compromise
[1:52:51] she wasn't at war with him over his
[1:52:53] drinking
[1:52:55] she didn't take the sword to him
[1:52:58] and fight and cause strife and division
[1:53:00] because he drank
[1:53:01] because he was an alcoholic
[1:53:04] in laodicea we would say she's got a
[1:53:06] right to be upset
[1:53:08] yes she has a right to be upset she
[1:53:09] doesn't have a right to war hey
[1:53:12] she has a right to be heard she has a
[1:53:13] right to be upset she has a right to ask
[1:53:15] him to be different she has a right to
[1:53:16] do that
[1:53:17] but she has no right to war
[1:53:21] and so now this man
[1:53:25] he tells his friends there's a real one
[1:53:26] my wife said no
[1:53:28] you know they don't believe it they've
[1:53:29] never seen one so let's go home and act
[1:53:31] real drunk
[1:53:32] and we'll just cause a ruckus and you
[1:53:33] see so they go home and they stagger in
[1:53:36] like they're drunk and they say
[1:53:37] we want ham and eggs she says okay honey
[1:53:39] she fixes ham and eggs she seats all his
[1:53:41] friends
[1:53:42] what's she doing she's serving him what
[1:53:44] is she doing
[1:53:45] she is bearing the burden of christ
[1:53:50] she taking the ox anointing that bears
[1:53:54] down under the burden
[1:53:57] and lays down their life
[1:54:00] he says we want these and he fixes it
[1:54:03] and they're in there causing a ruckus
[1:54:04] she brings it in and he says you know i
[1:54:06] don't like my exists when he throws she
[1:54:08] he throws them in the floor she says
[1:54:11] that's okay honey i'll fix them the way
[1:54:12] you like them
[1:54:18] i would have liked to been there see so
[1:54:22] many times we say
[1:54:23] i'd give him a piece of my mind that's
[1:54:24] what moses did
[1:54:27] kept him out of the promised land
[1:54:30] we don't want a piece of your mind you
[1:54:31] need all you can get
[1:54:34] keep it to yourself
[1:54:37] right i would tell him you would be
[1:54:40] moses
[1:54:43] it's not going to work friends when the
[1:54:46] enemy
[1:54:47] this is the enemy brother bennett said
[1:54:49] sometimes he'll challenge you just to
[1:54:52] see how you'll
[1:54:53] react what anointing will you take
[1:54:57] what spirit will dominate your life when
[1:54:59] the enemy comes in and raises up a red
[1:55:01] horse
[1:55:02] how will you react will you react with
[1:55:04] the red horse
[1:55:05] or will you take the ox this woman she's
[1:55:09] she's mad and she's she's not mad he's
[1:55:11] mad he's throwing her stuff they go out
[1:55:13] there
[1:55:13] and she says honey honey i'll fix you
[1:55:14] more i'll do it the way you like it
[1:55:16] and they go on out and they're out there
[1:55:19] and they hear her in there
[1:55:21] singing she said snubbing a little bit
[1:55:23] she was crying
[1:55:25] she wasn't happy this wasn't easy she
[1:55:27] wasn't having a good time me and jesus
[1:55:29] were okay
[1:55:30] she was crying she's saying jesus had to
[1:55:33] bear across from me
[1:55:35] shall he bear a cross alone i don't
[1:55:37] remember all the words but
[1:55:39] there's a cross for me to bear
[1:55:42] and now she realizes she's under the ox
[1:55:44] anointing she's bearing down
[1:55:46] as a sacrifice brother ben said those
[1:55:50] men heard her in their singing
[1:55:52] and they knew she was real and one said
[1:55:54] yeah she's a real christian
[1:55:56] they came in brother rem said she let
[1:55:58] her husband and all those friends to the
[1:56:00] lord that night
[1:56:01] because the only thing that can break
[1:56:03] the power of the red horse
[1:56:05] is the ox anointing you'll never
[1:56:08] break the power of the red horse
[1:56:10] anointing with the red horse anointing
[1:56:12] all it is would be an intellectual bait
[1:56:14] and everybody's throwing down and coming
[1:56:16] with comebacks
[1:56:18] put downs and comebacks put downs and
[1:56:19] come back and i'm smarter and wittier
[1:56:21] and i finally talk so much you can't
[1:56:22] talk no more and i won
[1:56:25] red horse versus redhorse i remember
[1:56:27] more quotes i remember more scriptures
[1:56:28] let's go
[1:56:30] red horse but the only way to break the
[1:56:33] power of the red horse
[1:56:35] is with the ox anointing listen friends
[1:56:39] there's there's a war within you and the
[1:56:42] devil's trying to get you to take these
[1:56:44] annoying things
[1:56:45] and they'll do it in your home and
[1:56:46] they'll do it with your children and the
[1:56:48] worst mistake i've ever made is fighting
[1:56:50] the red horse with the red horse
[1:56:53] when i started looking at this you talk
[1:56:55] about one man who's been flattened i've
[1:56:57] been
[1:56:57] flattened because i'm guilty of this my
[1:57:00] whole life
[1:57:02] my whole life taking the red horse and
[1:57:05] fighting the red horse
[1:57:07] but when the red horse comes into your
[1:57:08] home amen
[1:57:10] the only way to break the power of the
[1:57:12] red horse is with the ox anointing
[1:57:14] now realize friends the ox anointing is
[1:57:17] not a compromising spirit
[1:57:19] the ox anointing doesn't give in for
[1:57:23] the ox anointing means he will not have
[1:57:26] peace
[1:57:27] he's giving his life
[1:57:31] and the church ages when they were when
[1:57:33] they were being slaughtered
[1:57:34] if they would compromise and recant they
[1:57:36] could live
[1:57:37] but the ox anointing is not one that
[1:57:39] compromises it's not one that recants
[1:57:41] it's not one that deviates on one word
[1:57:44] of god
[1:57:46] the ox anointing is a strong anointing
[1:57:48] that bears down
[1:57:49] under the word under persecution under
[1:57:52] strife
[1:57:52] and just keeps plotting alone
[1:57:55] they never deviated from the word they
[1:57:57] never changed from the word
[1:57:59] nobody is saying peace at all cost
[1:58:01] absolutely jesus said i did not come to
[1:58:03] bring peace
[1:58:03] but a sword that they'll kill you
[1:58:07] thinking that they do god of service
[1:58:08] they'll kill your character they'll fame
[1:58:10] your name
[1:58:11] they'll kill you thinking that they do
[1:58:12] got a service he didn't come to bring
[1:58:14] peace but a sword
[1:58:15] he didn't come so you compromise to have
[1:58:17] peace in your home
[1:58:18] he didn't come to compromise that peace
[1:58:20] at work he came so there'd be no
[1:58:22] compromise
[1:58:22] and i would bear down but i won't fight
[1:58:25] back
[1:58:27] see this little this little woman she
[1:58:29] bore down under the burden of her
[1:58:31] confession of her faith she didn't
[1:58:35] compromise for her husband
[1:58:37] she didn't drink a little with him to
[1:58:39] get up close to him so she could win him
[1:58:40] to the lord by being like him
[1:58:43] she stayed coldly separated she didn't
[1:58:45] drop the bars
[1:58:46] of her holiness her modesty she didn't
[1:58:48] drop the bars
[1:58:50] of her submission to her husband she
[1:58:52] didn't drop the bars of the word one
[1:58:54] iota for him
[1:58:56] but she did not fight him she submitted
[1:59:01] we don't change the word for peace we
[1:59:03] stay with the word and it means we'll
[1:59:04] have no peace
[1:59:06] and if we stay with the word to make
[1:59:08] sure we have no peace
[1:59:10] it means at some point you will have to
[1:59:12] take the ox anointing
[1:59:14] and the ox anointing will not compromise
[1:59:17] for peace it'll give its life
[1:59:22] for the word and never fight back
[1:59:26] we've made a mistake i've made mistakes
[1:59:30] but there's a path called repentance
[1:59:34] and say lord i'm sorry that was
[1:59:37] sharp words and cutting divisive
[1:59:39] language i have been under the power of
[1:59:42] the red horse anointing
[1:59:44] i'm sorry lord that i did not
[1:59:47] understand what i was doing but now i
[1:59:50] understand what i'm doing
[1:59:53] and i'm going to take your ox anointing
[1:59:57] and i'm going to bear under the burnings
[1:59:58] and i'm going to become a sacrificial
[2:00:00] beast of burden
[2:00:01] i'm going to lay down my life
[2:00:04] brother branham said
[2:00:08] he was talking to brother levail he had
[2:00:10] baptized with the level and they went
[2:00:12] over to get something to eat
[2:00:14] and brother leville says how do you let
[2:00:16] people rail on you all the time like
[2:00:18] that
[2:00:18] how do you let them say things about you
[2:00:20] like that
[2:00:23] and brother branham said you know he
[2:00:25] said he's one of the finest man i know
[2:00:27] but he's a little quick on the trigger
[2:00:28] sometimes
[2:00:31] brother graham said oh he said he said
[2:00:34] remember the story of david
[2:00:37] when david was a rejected king absalom
[2:00:39] was trying to take over his kingdom
[2:00:41] he was the rightful king and the
[2:00:42] rightful spot he should have been there
[2:00:44] but he realized that his sin had caused
[2:00:46] this problem
[2:00:48] and now he's leaving he's leaving humble
[2:00:51] he's leaving humiliated and there's a
[2:00:53] man there spitting on him
[2:00:56] cursing him and one of his one of his
[2:00:59] servants says i'll take the head off he
[2:01:01] takes his sword
[2:01:02] i'll cut his head off and david said
[2:01:06] don't do it maybe the lord told him to
[2:01:08] do that
[2:01:10] don't do it brother ram tells that story
[2:01:13] then he goes home
[2:01:15] they start talking about the tax
[2:01:16] collector reopen the case
[2:01:18] he's at home and he's talking and
[2:01:20] there's a question about whether they
[2:01:22] should go back to arizona or stay in
[2:01:23] jeffersonville
[2:01:24] and brotherhood said i don't know
[2:01:25] whichever i'm fine with it i'll serve
[2:01:27] the lord either place
[2:01:28] and then somebody railed out against
[2:01:30] this tax i said that all that tax
[2:01:31] collector something or like that
[2:01:33] he said no more than thinking what i
[2:01:34] just told brother lee i said
[2:01:36] don't say a thing maybe the lord told
[2:01:38] him
[2:01:39] to do that what did he do he took the ox
[2:01:42] anointing
[2:01:43] he wouldn't fight back even in the
[2:01:45] privacy of his own
[2:01:48] home
[2:01:51] sometimes with strong willpower we'll
[2:01:53] not fight anybody to their face but
[2:01:55] we'll go home and our family will hear
[2:01:56] about it all day
[2:01:58] and all night that person and that and
[2:02:00] how they they and
[2:02:01] i can't believe this and blah blah blah
[2:02:02] it's red horse just the same whether
[2:02:04] you're facing the person or not
[2:02:06] you've got a spirit of war a spirit of
[2:02:08] fighting a spirit of strife you're
[2:02:09] taking a sword
[2:02:10] and you're defaming their character
[2:02:12] amongst your children
[2:02:15] that's what got those children killed in
[2:02:16] elijah's day
[2:02:19] sometimes we'll do it in our minds we'll
[2:02:22] compromise on something and something
[2:02:23] will be preached or somebody will say
[2:02:25] something but they don't understand i
[2:02:26] don't know
[2:02:28] and we go off on our minds like a
[2:02:29] machine gun it's the red horse friends
[2:02:33] trying to get you to believe it trying
[2:02:34] to get you to act on it trying to get
[2:02:36] you upset in your spirit
[2:02:37] when you have to lay down your life and
[2:02:39] say if that's the word and the lord
[2:02:40] reveals it to me i'll do it
[2:02:43] if that is the word and that's what god
[2:02:45] wants i'll do it
[2:02:48] totally different spirit sometimes we'll
[2:02:50] do it in our minds sometimes we'll do it
[2:02:52] in the privacy of our homes or in our
[2:02:53] cars
[2:02:54] but either place we do it is still the
[2:02:56] red horse anointing friends
[2:02:58] we have to take the ox anointing and the
[2:03:01] only thing that will defeat the red
[2:03:02] horse anointing
[2:03:03] is the ox anointing what a lesson we've
[2:03:07] learned
[2:03:08] let's all stand
[2:03:15] musicians if you'd come please
[2:03:20] brother branham said
[2:03:23] in the testimony of a true witness
[2:03:27] he said one of the very first signs of
[2:03:30] christianity
[2:03:32] is he refused to kill a man
[2:03:36] he said that's right and you can kill
[2:03:38] him more ways than just sticking him
[2:03:40] with a knife
[2:03:41] speak against his character many ways
[2:03:44] you can do it
[2:03:45] he said one of the first signs of
[2:03:47] christianity is refuse to kill a man
[2:03:51] and he said you can kill him not just
[2:03:53] with a knife or a gun
[2:03:55] but with words and you speak against his
[2:03:58] character and damage his influence
[2:04:00] he said then you're guilty brother
[2:04:03] branham even went so far and says
[2:04:05] he that looketh upon a woman to lust
[2:04:07] after her is guilty already in his heart
[2:04:09] and brother ben said
[2:04:10] what about the woman right
[2:04:13] and brother ben connected it to this
[2:04:17] he said paul said you fight and you
[2:04:20] still
[2:04:20] strive and you bite at one another these
[2:04:24] things ought not to be
[2:04:26] brother ram said you're guilty of what
[2:04:29] killing killing the character killing
[2:04:32] the influence
[2:04:33] with what the red horse anointing it
[2:04:36] doesn't matter what somebody comes
[2:04:37] against you with
[2:04:38] you lay down your life and you sacrifice
[2:04:40] and stay right with the word
[2:04:42] don't compromise for peace there's no
[2:04:44] compromise for peace
[2:04:46] we stay with the word but we give our
[2:04:48] lives
[2:04:49] we let them kill us spit on us call us
[2:04:51] names marcus call us
[2:04:53] holy roller beat you on the head who
[2:04:55] prophesied
[2:04:56] and he never spoke a word back
[2:04:59] judas come in deception jesus knew what
[2:05:03] he was coming for
[2:05:04] he knew he was already sold out he knew
[2:05:06] judas was a devil from the start
[2:05:08] he comes to me says friend why have you
[2:05:11] come
[2:05:12] can we take that same anointing it's
[2:05:15] part of christ
[2:05:17] say god i need an extra dose
[2:05:20] of your ox anointing i want the spirit
[2:05:23] of christ on me
[2:05:24] that i don't fight people i'll fight
[2:05:26] systems i'll fight devils
[2:05:28] i'll fight the antichrist i'll fight
[2:05:30] false doctrine all day long

[2:05:38] brothers and sisters i won't fight
[2:05:39] the neighbor i won't fight the stranger
[2:05:41] but i'll fight the devil
[2:05:44] and the only way i can fight him when he
[2:05:45] comes against me with the sword
[2:05:47] is by laying down my life in surrender
[2:05:53] it's a high calling paul said i'm
[2:05:56] i press towards the high calling
[2:06:01] paul wasn't pressing for a mediocre
[2:06:04] christian walk
[2:06:06] paul was not pressing for a church life
[2:06:08] paul was not pressing just to come to
[2:06:10] church and go home and everything's okay
[2:06:12] paul was pressing for the high calling
[2:06:15] of christ jesus
[2:06:17] the mark of the high calling paul said i
[2:06:20] keep under my body
[2:06:22] lest by any means i should be a castaway
[2:06:24] that keep under my mighty means to beat
[2:06:26] black and blue what's he beating black
[2:06:30] and blue

[2:06:33] the inner man can flourish this is the
[2:06:36] scriptures friends

[2:07:37] we recognize by your word that we're
[2:07:38] deficient in so many ways
[2:07:41] but lord you've never asked us to have
[2:07:43] enough

[2:07:47] climbing a ladder of some sort of works
[2:07:49] program
[2:07:51] you've asked us to surrender
[2:07:54] you never said when you get to this
[2:07:56] station in life i'll do something for
[2:07:58] you when you finally climb up here
[2:08:00] but you said when we die if we can go
[2:08:03] down and the likeness of your death will

[2:08:06] resurrection
[2:08:08] and lord we just want to die a little
[2:08:09] more right now lord

[2:08:22] flood with a sword to take peace lord
[2:08:24] and to destroy i pray that you would
[2:08:26] give me the ox anointing to bear under
[2:08:28] the burden not fight back
[2:08:30] to surrender my life to give up my

[2:08:41] devil in our lives

[2:08:48] out so that i can resist him and he can
[2:08:50] flee
[2:08:51] you're showing us his hiding places
[2:08:53] you're showing us where he's working in
[2:08:55] our lives
[2:08:56] so that we can resist him there and he
[2:08:58] will have to flee
[2:08:59] we will be free from all the influence
[2:09:01] of the antichrist because of your word

[2:09:55] and he wants to be obedient we've got to
[2:09:57] sit down and have a conversation two
[2:09:59] weeks ago
[2:10:00] and i just was impressed that he felt a
[2:10:03] pull when he had a desire to be obedient
[2:10:05] he knows what the word says and he's
[2:10:07] going to obey it and we're going to
[2:10:08] believe with him that god's going to
[2:10:10] keep his portion of the word
[2:10:12] then he's coming in full obedience with
[2:10:13] a full heart to receive all that god has
[2:10:16] for him
[2:10:16] and we know that god will keep his word
[2:10:19] amen
[2:10:20] benny because you love the lord jesus
[2:10:22] christ and you want to be identified
[2:10:24] with him if you accepted him as your
[2:10:25] sacrifice and atonement

[2:10:29] lord jesus christ

[2:10:46] let him never stray away lord but that
[2:10:48] you would shepherd him and guide him all
[2:10:49] through life
