[0:00] Who is this MelkiseDC? He says God come
[0:03] down and became flesh and died to death
[0:05] in Christ so that he could clean the
[0:07] church in order to get into it for
[0:10] fellowship. Now we're getting into real
[0:12] redemption. Not not a lamb, not just
[0:16] shedding blood, not just a covering, but
[0:17] he was going to do something to erase
[0:19] the sin. Amen. And he could have limited
[0:22] fellowship, amen, along the way. But God
[0:25] has to make a way for unlimited
[0:27] fellowship.
[0:29] And so he came and became flesh and died
[0:32] to death in Christ so that he could
[0:34] clean the church. So what was the
[0:36] purpose of shedding of blood? For
[0:37] sanctification. So he could clean the
[0:39] church in order to get into it. For what
[0:43] purpose? For fellowship.
[0:47] Now then he says God loves fellowship.
[0:51] That's what he made the man at the first
[0:53] time for was for fellowship. God dwells
[0:56] alone with cherubams. So God's wanting
[0:58] this fellowship. So he came down himself
[1:00] in a body of flesh and gave his own
[1:03] life. Amen. So that he could sanctify a
[1:05] church so that he could send back his
[1:07] spirit to live inside of you. For what
[1:09] reason? For fellowship. So now where do
[1:12] you fellowship with God at? Not in
[1:15] church, friends. Not you fellowship with
[1:17] God in your soul. Amen. Where God has
[1:20] entered in. Amen. by the power that was
[1:22] released at Calvary, by the shedding of
[1:24] blood, by the sanctification of the
[1:26] spirit, so that he can enter in and
[1:29] dwell in you and be with you and be in
[1:31] you. Brother Brandham said, Amen. the
[1:34] this woman challenged brother Brandham
[1:35] because of the oneness doctrine and
[1:37] said, "Who was Jesus praying to when he
[1:39] prayed to the father in the garden of
[1:40] Gethsemane?" And he said, "Let me ask
[1:42] you a question." Yeah. Amen. Said, "Do
[1:44] you have the Holy Ghost?"
[1:46] Yes. He said, "Then who do you pray to
[1:48] when you pray?" Amen. How far away is
[1:51] this fellowship? Amen. It's as close as
[1:54] you let it be. Amen. God wants to
[1:57] fellowship with you. That's why he died.
[1:59] That's why he sanctified you. That's why
[2:00] he filled you with his spirit because he
[2:03] wants to fellowship with you. We go to
[2:06] egoentrical view again, right? God
[2:09] wanted me and he died for me and he
[2:10] filled me with the Holy Ghost so I was
[2:12] sealed so I can go to heaven. Listen,
[2:14] that's that's our little human pebbrain
[2:16] perspective. But God did that because
[2:19] there was something he wanted.
[2:23] He wants your fellowship. He wants you
[2:25] to talk to him. He wants you to love
[2:27] him. Amen. He wants you to share your
[2:29] life with him. And he wants to share his
[2:30] life with you. That's why in this
[2:33] generation under this message, amen, the
[2:36] veil has been taken away. So that we
[2:38] could see what God has designed and
[2:39] wanted all along. So they're not stuck
[2:41] in a church denomination egoentrical
[2:44] view all surrounding us. But we can back
[2:46] up and go all the way back to the back
[2:48] part of God's mind and find out what he
[2:50] wanted all along. He wanted himself
[2:53] replicated as a family and flesh on the
[2:55] earth and fellowship with one another.
[2:58] Amen. God wanted to fellowship with
[3:00] himself.
[3:02] That's why he wants to live in you.
[3:04] Because he wants to fellowship with you
[3:06] in a deeper way than we could ever
[3:08] imagine. We're out.
