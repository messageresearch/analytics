[0:00] because that's what I've been meditating
[0:01] on. Not that we want to make each other
[0:03] mad, but I would I would rather rather I
[0:06] rather than being complicit to watching
[0:08] a train wreck. Amen. I'd rather say
[0:10] something
[0:11] &gt;&gt; rather than sitting BACK AND WATCH A
[0:13] FAMILY go off the rails and watch
[0:15] somebody go into utter destruction or a
[0:17] MAN GO OVER THE FALLS AND JUST keep my
[0:19] mouth shut because I can only say nice
[0:20] things and I can only compliment. I can
[0:22] only praise, but I can never question. I
[0:24] can never ask if everything's all right.
[0:26] I can never share a concern.
[0:29] God, help us not to be complicit. Help
[0:31] us not to be, Amen, sitting there
[0:33] watching, doing nothing, but let's be
[0:35] good friends
[0:37] &gt;&gt; and love one another with a real
[0:40] sacrificial love. A love that causes us
[0:44] to get out of our comfort zone. A love
[0:46] that causes causes us to risk
[0:49] ourselves for the benefit of somebody
[0:51] else. Risk our reputation. Risk somebody
[0:54] getting upset at us. risk being able to
[0:57] have an uncomfortable conversation.
[0:59] Amen. Risk it for the love and benefit
[1:01] of another human being
[1:04] &gt;&gt; or just stay safely behind our own safe
[1:06] shelter and have eyes to see but never a
[1:09] mouth to speak.
[1:11] So God help us. Help us to be true.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham said remember love is
[1:16] corrective always. Genuine love is
[1:18] corrective. So you must be able to stand
[1:20] the correction.
[1:23] Brother said, "I've all my life I've
[1:25] cherished friends. There's nothing I
[1:28] love like people, and I wanted people to
[1:31] love me." I put this in here because
[1:32] Brother Brennan was a rejected little
[1:34] boy. All of his life. He wanted friends,
[1:36] and he loved people, and he felt the
[1:38] rejection all the time. And he said this
[1:40] also, "I was misunderstood so much to
[1:43] when I'd be talking on the street to
[1:45] someone and somebody else would come
[1:46] up." Well, they'd walk away and leave me
[1:49] stand. and I love people, but no one had
[1:52] nothing to do with me. I was what they
[1:54] called the black sheep. Here's a man
[1:56] with the rejection complex. And here's a
[1:58] man who just wants people to love him
[2:00] and he loves people. Amen. But this is
[2:02] man's been called to be a prophet of the
[2:04] age. And he's been a one who's got to
[2:06] cry out AGAINST SIN AND CALL OUT to the
[2:08] man going over the falls again and again
[2:11] and again. And what does he get in
[2:12] return? Rejection. Rejection. Rejection.
[2:16] &gt;&gt; But I didn't reject him. I'M THANKFUL HE
[2:19] CALLED OUT AGAINST SIN. I'M THANKFUL HE
[2:21] CALLED out against my problem, my issue,
[2:23] my church, MY FORM OF BELIEF. I THANK
[2:26] GOD THAT A MAN WHO didn't want to did. A
[2:29] MAN WHO DIDN'T LIKE IT did it anyways. A
[2:31] MAN WHO WASN'T HOSTILE, HE WASN'T
[2:33] CRITICAL. HE WASN'T CUTTING anybody
[2:35] down, but he was under a commission of
[2:37] God. And he loved human beings enough to
[2:39] tell the truth out OF THE BIBLE. AND I
[2:42] THANK GOD THAT HE DID.
[2:44] &gt;&gt; WHY SHOULD HE BE THE ONLY ONE IN AN AGE
[2:46] THAT DONE IT? WHY NOT WE? AMEN. FOLLOW
[2:49] SUITS. AMEN.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God. To me, that's real love.
[2:53] Because that man did not want the
[2:55] rejection that followed being honest.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; HE WOULD GO STAND. HE WOULD BE PREACHING
[3:01] the truth. Amen. To ministers who were
[3:04] getting up OUT OF THE BACK AND WALKING
[3:06] OUT AND DROVES OF THEM were walking out.
[3:08] WHILE HE WAS PREACHING, I WAS NOT
[3:09] disobedient to the heavenly vision. AND
[3:11] HE HAD TO STAND there and finish his
[3:13] sermon. A MAN WHO WAS REJECTED AS a boy
[3:16] who just wanted people TO LOVE HIM HAD
[3:18] TO STAND THERE AND deliver what God
[3:19] placed ON HIS HEART WHILE PEOPLE WERE
[3:21] SHAKING their heads and walking out.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; And I thank God he did.
[3:27] &gt;&gt; To me, he's a friend.
