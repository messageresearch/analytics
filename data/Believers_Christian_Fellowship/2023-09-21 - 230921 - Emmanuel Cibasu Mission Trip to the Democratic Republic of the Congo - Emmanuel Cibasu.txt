I just want to say it's good to be back home and good to see beautiful faces tonight and I don't know where to start from just want to let you know that there are many many Souls that are being blessed by your stand for the word of God that's the greatest compliment I can bring to you Brothers pastors anybody who would hear about BCF in the stand we do have for this at BCF even in languages that are being translated not English in different languages they get a little bit of Maybe videos coming from this place sermons from this place when they approach you they know you coming from there there is a an atmosphere of love that we would like to have what you have and they are sending greetings to you I might not be able to cover it as we will be going through the the report we are bringing greetings from over 450 or close to 480 pastors of churches representing over 45 000 believers so you can hear the magnitude brother Franco thank you so much for all your work just even to condense the pictures the videos just that I can bring it to share here it's a daunting task itself just to tell you the magnitude I might not be able to tell it all who just want to thank you so much for thanking our pastor and the vision that he has and the church and in your support and the prayers and in all that you have done that I could be sent so because a missionary is someone who is sent if my church my pastor didn't support me in sending me I could not be there so it's you my person you who or the fruit who are the beneficiaries of this report it's not my report it's nobody's report it's your report it's what you believed doing created and I'm just bringing you the feedback of what you did so this is what I'm I'm going to be telling you so if I miss it it's uh it's you it's you who did all this uh this work here so before we we went we go to that there's a little thought that came in I was uh a few years back just reading uh this is the third message that is recorded of the pro of our prophet it recorded 1947. it's one of those uh first messages it's a third message it's uh the angel of God preached in 1947. November 2nd 47. because I believe that even then even before he preached he was still the anointed prophet of the age even before 63 is every move he was ordained to be a prophet of this age his very birth it's already a message to us so in this message he's saying something it's a minor Sims great to you but he had little impact upon me the prophet of God goes and say now notice then at the time of the promised they raised up a pharaoh who did not know Joseph we know the story and they put burdens upon the people and the people were so burdened that they could not make the bricks and things that they were supposed to do and then would you think that God would plag his people in in that manner yes for the word of God is eternally true is that right and he promised he would deliver them in no other way he had to do it but this away now I'm looking at it this way he said so therefore at the time of the persecution of Israel then God had an angel to come down to the Earth that's the first thing but before he had the angel come there is a prerequisite there he saw that the children of Israel were in bondage he wanted to deliver them according to his promise he had a promise given to their grandfather great-grandfather Abraham 400 years ago now he wanted to send them an angel to deliver them but before he could send them an angel he had a little boy born down there by the name of Moses so here's a God the great Jehovah wanting willing because he can only be one with his word his word was already given out he was ready to fulfill his word ready to send the mighty Angel but he needed something on the Earth a baby had to be born there now God could have sent the angel down couldn't he he could have let the angel come himself but instead of that he sent the angel to speak through the voice of a man God always used man for his work is that right he don't use organizations also forth in Mechanical Devices but he uses men the Holy Spirit fell upon man that's God's instrument here on Earth with this just skipping it short with the revelation we have sometimes we wonder how this church how are they going to be growing up I know many times I have spoken to my pastor and in other ministers the conditioners have been traveling to the Congo just helping on the charity of which many God bless you families here that have been supporting in any shape in any way to just help those that are in need physically and mostly the churches as I was going there seeing the churches big and small churches within the message and when you are observing coming closer to the brothers of those places maybe they invited us to go and preach there you're finding that he or holding to the message but the life of the message is not within them and I know I I don't condemn them for that because I I used to be that way too and I something just started pounding Within Me how can these people be helped they are by thousands tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands the Congo if you don't know the um the stats of the message it's the country is I'm gonna show up it has has been the voice of God has uh noted it tactic is the first country that has a great number of message believers and you see those thousands there holding on to the message but the very life the very Spirit the very unction anointing of the message not living in people so it's not daunting on me in a while I read this quote I said I don't have to wait on somebody to do that God I know before you can send your angel you need a little baby Moses to be born there even within his weaknesses you even waited on him to mature you even did what you could to use him you can use anybody God is it any way we can find a way to go and start bringing this message to those that already have the message because it seems that they have it but there's no life inside so that's the burden was getting growing bigger as we were helping the charity with the charity work in the Congo the charity work was mostly among message believers and that's what I did that observation that God is it anything you can do and I know that as I was praying the Lord just seeming to lead me that we have brothers here in this country that are that has already he got matured that could be come sharing the same light to those people in in the messages in many places so last year's yesterday last year to give it a short brother Randy Sayers I will be showing him so I spoke to him um they invited me to go this is brother Nathaniel Sciences Church brother Randy uh is his father he was a pastor for the last 47 years so brother Nathaniel science became the pastor as of January of this year but last year as they invited me I went to share the word of God so after the service we were just fellowshipping and I was just telling him about the burden that was upon me for those thousands of Believers in the Congo and then brother uh Randy is telling me that you know what 40 years ago I have told my wife without knowing that I would be one day in the Congo I said after the service I had an intention and I was asking you if possible that we can go to the Congo but yet he was still the pastor it was last year though so we we just put it under the rug last year and then after January first that he was no longer pastoring the church God touched him that he felt the burden to be on a mission field then he called me up and then we start talking if you know brother Randy signs we can talk on the phone for two hours so we did a lot of talking and then we I agree that we would plan a trip to go to the Congo and I told him okay so I need to let my pastor know so we did I spoke to my pastor was uh something he gave me the green light so we we planned for the trip and this is something so he came to remember that he told his wife not knowing why he would just said 40 years ago that he would be in the Congo so we made all the arrangement to get him the Visa so that's how we ended up going to the Congo uh this uh last month in August and so before I start the slides I just want to say thank you again to my pastor into the church to the brothers sometimes it's easy to forget I know the brothers when I travel to Africa the Congo they give me clothing sisters here I don't want to embarrass you they give me clothing for the Sisters back there they are very appreciated it's we don't have time to say those things up here but you'll find sisters with only one dress maybe two dresses that's what they have a brother that have no shoes maybe you have sandals or something's been using and a little thing you have done one would be give maybe a hundred dollars here and there in churches they have many needs so you'll just go some throw some of them here and I just don't want to forget that I would tell all of you that everything you have done for your brothers and sisters is very much appreciated God richly bless you it's beyond words so brother Franco I'm I want to start I don't know we can go quicker so this is the uh the country Democratic Republic of the Congo we we left no August 9th and we return back September 12th so 31 days as a brother Chad said on the ground in the country and three days flying so over the seas over the Lakes you can can tell it so this is uh the country itself it's uh it's about 112 million it's the 15th most populated country in the world so they have official languages they have French for those that go attend school and they have four national languages four national languages one north east north west north east south west south east and beyond that this is gonna crack you they have 420 dialects meaning when we're moving from one Province to another Province ahead to be the translation from English into French I have one speaking in one language we go in another Province French English French and other language so think that they are places that it's French one language and dialects it's you cannot comprehend it but that's the way it is so 95 are Christians and the capital is inches I would have to go uh quicker so you'll see where we um Africa the country is there so we flew from Cleveland to Chicago Chicago Brussels from Brussels we headed down to Kinshasa so Chicago Brussels almost eight and a half hours or nine and Brussels to Kinshasa had Aiden eight hours and 30 minutes then that's the country it's uh we landed in the south west which is the Kinshasa let's see okay that's we spent there two weeks then we took a flight two and a half hour flight to Goma it's Northeast and then from there we took a ship going down to bokavo the second town there and then a week later we were turned back to Kinshasa from Kinshasa we went to the another Province South in bansango there so that's brother Randy science for those that don't know him I know he's a good friend bro to brother Tom sister Barb and many of us here that's brother Randy there and his wife sister Alice and on the left his uh sitting on his uh suitcase we're at the airport there so I took that shot and said hey my buddy we're gonna have a long flight so we're taking a little selfie there so as 120 years together of selfie two people two people 120 years together so and then so we landed in Kinshasa um that's the family we stayed in that the home of the brother and sister and his daughter in between us for about 24 days so his wife his daughter and his wife they were cooked they were cooking for us because they don't have just microwaves or things in the freezer and put in a microwave they had to go do shoppings and make and make sure they cook good because they wanted to keep us safe from not getting sick so everything cooked and they would wake up four in the morning get our breakfast by seven seven in the morning our breakfast was ready seven seven thirty sometimes breakfast was ready by 5 30 if we have to leave early they were just working tirelessly by noon or one o'clock food because we had ministers that came to visit us every time we had if we didn't have a service in the morning we had a question and answer with the ministers so I've been talking for more than a month because you have to take from Brother Randy to tell those people whatever anybody says the brother Randy I had the translation I've been sometimes I've been closing my minds but speaking and they would feel sorry for me because we have to go to the service that evening so and then so that's them their house so this is the first place we we went for the service we arrived on Thursday a night and then we had to travel to go to a remote area on Friday early morning and that's the place we went I'm showing them the reason I'm showing this is uh because those buildings are in addition to their church and it's a throw our church here contributed to those that have contributed to literal our charity that's the money that built that church to add because people have been just coming to church and the church is uh the people it's growing so they have to do some additions to the church so this is you that's your money what you've been supporting in any shape in any way so this is you doing that so you can see that the roof the addition then all the church was on the left even the chairs it's you guys who have been helping there so this is before we got to that church that's the job we had to do on the road a couple times because you can go with a Jeep you have to stop somewhere there's no roads there may be a little stream of water have to create something so you can you can cross else you can be walking for Miles so brother Randy and I and the brothers we're trying to get some older Metals somewhere hey create a put somewhere to have a little road so the Jeep that's behind there can come it crosses then we can go back in it so that's brother Randy getting acquainted with the people in that little village is saying hi to a sister there quick so we have the service that evening with brother Randy at that church just go quick so that's a little congregation not little congression it has over um in Kinshasa in the Congo yes 350 Believers there so and after the service some ministers and we have some Sunday school there was we're around there um wonderful time so we had the weekend Friday and then Saturday Saturday morning we went visiting some sisters and some brothers little houses though they were sick they were in need and just just being acquainted to one another as we were brothers and so let's talk together and then we this is another a week after the weekend we just passed it so this is a church the reason I'm showing brother Randy myself there's a pastor on my left side and there was a lady there this late the pastor they just bought a new place new location they were building they put a foundation to build the church they didn't tell anybody in the area that we're building a church and then that lady she was a neighbor she's a Seventh Day Adventist she had a dream in her dream so she came to see the pastor that I have a dream that I want to tell you so that's coming back so the dream was that is she said I know that I don't know what you're building but in my dream it showed me that you're Building a Church and before this church could be complete this white men two people one is white and one is black they're coming here to preach at this church and as we will be preaching the power of God will be spreading in the entire neighborhood and it's going to be lingering for a long long time so she told him in February in February brother Randy and I have not even finalized for the trip yet we finalized it in May so that's in February and the brother said I don't see any white men coming in to preach I don't even know how how long the church will be taking to build because I don't even have enough money so he forgot about it and in May there's a brother who was doing um scheduling for us to go to certain churches because there were just so many people on the list and he the brother who was scheduling happened to remember that oh there's a brother he had a she had a church but they are moving to a certain place to build the church I don't know if he would be interested but we can go to his church so he called him up say that hey I have a are you open to receive some ministers he said we we relocated we're trying to build a church we're not even ready yet and the brother said okay I'm going to put your name on the list that they want to be coming to your church he had no idea where were they coming from he said okay just put my name there but it was when we arrived and he was already scheduled that we came to church you know he came to visit us first at the brother's home and then he found out that oh brother Randy was white and I was we're coming from America he said there's something let me go back then he found out there was a dream that has a sister a neighbor told the told him so when we had service he called that neighbor to come and just relate to us what the dream was about so this is the church we we went there we can see it they don't have roof so they need a roof right now uh even the it's a bare floor but they're trying their best people it's a new area the people are just coming to the message so they're flowing in and so it's if it's rain they have to to stop the service so that's what we preached so it's a brother Randy myself there and the Believers there that's the church it was getting darker so we we had to just keep going and after the service we don't probably I don't have those pictures you have to deserves the power of God because when we just to mention that sometimes the music we are just so blessed that it's a revelation he has not hit many churches yet who are sitting there before we can even come to the pulpit to just preach the music was making our bodies vibrating too loud and uh as we knew that most churches will be finding things like that except in a few churches when we would come the first thing we would look at the musicians could you bring down the base you'll stop playing just the piano itself could you bring the music low so we're setting that in almost every Church except in a few and as they would play themselves they have to tell us after the service that we have never had a service like this just melowness just quietness and then the Holy Spirit would start the word of God setting the atmosphere and after the service people were just those that were just getting healed or had many testimonies at people just being touched by the Lord and some just making a commitment most places more than 75 percent before I skipped that of pastors after the service they would come back in the back room the pastor would say could you please pray for me I want to come back to what you brought it's the message I've been preaching for 25 years or plus but I have not this atmosphere in the church I don't have this result I want could you pray for me who said if you that's your desire that's already your prayer so it was um just that and when they had people to be baptized or just tell them please do as you always do take them because we don't want them to think that special people baptize them you just take them after service as you always do just to keep things like that so this is in another church and the reason I'm putting it there is always a little Charity here whatever your support that's the church will give them some means to build up a church so it was still in construction they wanted us to come and preach anyway so brother Randy's and a pastor's office there preparing for the service so dusty but I said hey we're here for the word of God so that's the church so the congregation here you provided the roof there so everything you see there is built with little help here and the pastor in the congregation they are very appreciative of every little thing that we we do for them that's the place and then that's uh brother Randy and I going to the pulpit and the past of that congregation this is a miracle because he came to see us he couldn't preach someone was preaching couple people were preaching there for a couple of weeks he has sciatic nerves he couldn't stand up he came to visit us at the home of the brother as we just prayed together this is the prayer of faith and two days after he called us he said you know what when you will be coming to appreciate my place I'll be walking God has touched me has healed me so he's there testifying and then this little place there have a little video I can go quick I hope this little small church this is before the service after the service it was overflowing outside people were standing some have to get new chairs just to come out there and again this place a little Charity here provided for some chairs provided for the tin roof and whatever they have there so these are places as we go we see the needs of people Desiring to do God's will so we are happy to join in whatever way we can do to to be together so that's the congregation now we passed us another another church so that's the pastor of a church myself brother Randy that's his congregation almost same thing and then here it's uh the brother has a big house and he has it has three level the third level he put it just it's like a church in his home that every time he has visitors he goes up he calls us the upper room so we were receiving in the morning after breakfast receiving ministers and it will have a question and answers uh series or just praying there together sharing something together before we go to another service so after Minister's meeting question and answers we would come down and just get something to eat and then everybody would be talking I'd be exhausted all the time talking back and forth so I was talking twice as much okay this is another congregation we went in uh this is the past congregation very excited by the word that was hearing uh the place and then one day we took off uh brother Randy and I who went in town so we can just get some free free air so that's him and I there in Kinshasa there are some ministers visiting us the one in between brother Randy and I brother Roger has come here twice has visited us so we we had him with us because he was the one who knows the the Easter provinces I never been there so we wanted him to be with us so we got the to go together this is another congregation we who are in um brother Randy and I so you see those similar this is Brother Rogers a little church so has probably over 300 inside there so we went there so people and then that's another church just go quick another church then we traveled from Kinshasa to Goma the pastor closer to me and uh with brother Randy brother Roger and there is a trustee there they came to get us from the airport they took us to the hotel it's a Catholic Hotel this is the the window from the hotel that's the lake there so we were like Moses in the pharaoh's house so who were in the Catholic Hotel said they don't know what we're doing here we're destroying their works yeah and then we had to preach at one Church there let me see I think it's a little video there they put them put together we had we had four meetings this place a weekend and the ministers meeting in every city every Province would have a Minister's meeting so they were coming in by hundreds [Music] so there's a little worship there one of the few the worship could still be regulated by the Holy Spirit [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] very nice brother the pastor there very very humble brother and he said please tell your pastor many of them tell your pastor and ministers they were waiting for you here so so anytime so that's where at his place after the services the weekend services so he's there brother Randy the pastor and myself then we head to the next morning we had to take a ship to travel to bokavu brother Randy and I on the ship with brother Roger on a big lake the lake is between separating the Congo and two more countries so we're on that Lake for uh seven hours therefore we got the bokavo so this is a place we had to preach for another weekend I think we had three-day meeting also a three-day meeting and one Minister's meeting mostly four meetings at that place too that's the little church and we provided also for the windows they didn't have windows they're still building so here and there so this is you'll see your your work there again a little video there very poor area foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is before before the service start started so after the service the people outside they have to take speaker phones outside so because of the Overflow a flow crowd crowd so this is the inside brother Randy and I preaching there and then this is The Minister's meeting they came pastors some of them took boats to come to join us some of them airplanes we've even provided for we helped some to get the tickets to come and join us the world needing wanting so bad to come from other provinces because the Congo has 26 provinces so we only went to four so people from other provinces were hey why don't you come to all places because we haven't seen any ministers from America for a long time and we want to be a part of it so we would we did manage to provide tickets for some other people some were coming by by Ship by by by cars so this after The Minister's meeting questions and answers so it would take probably half a day just to go with the ministers meeting good settings so these are sisters that were taking care of us I took a little snap they were cooking for the brothers they have all those four days three day meeting and we went to another small Church there wasn't that big because you will say that we will go to churches of thousands but there were some Churches maybe 20 people 30. they invited us we had to go do the same thing so just be one with them that's a little congregation somewhere okay you preach there and then we're leaving now bokavu you can see how the it's crowded there we'll get into that big ship ship there and so when we came back to Goma you will see something there the poor Poor's name poor Emmanuel seems like they were respecting me there they baptized support because they know they knew I was coming yeah so and then we a brother we headed to go to another church just in the open so they don't have any roof they're sitting outside yeah they invited us to say hey we're here for the world we don't care about outside so let's just uh so we're there and it's getting darker so somewhere had a little lamps back and then we we came back to Kinshasa this is a Minister's meeting uh this meeting I think we had over 250 ministers they were there and after The Minister's meeting because just telling them how things have they have opened the doors that let the enemy flood in with his music with his uh just anything within the message church and just bring them to the word the word and so the pastors were weeping of the service the atmosphere were singing somewhere just on knees crying and after the service they said you know what we want the Revival to come back in our churches we are guilty these are pastors have been pastoring their churches for years they are coming they were coming just so simply and said we don't want nothing but this word the life to come back in in our churches were guilty because we in another pastors said I inherited this from my past so I just knew that this is this was good to let this kind of music and this kind of thing I never knew any better so those are kind of things you're finding there so this was life because they have some people across Africa even Europe streaming so the ministers meeting or slim the lives you can there and so the next day we had to preach to that church too and that's the inside of the church this is it's outside people or people are it's overflowing so outside people are standing on the hallways and sitting outside so and we had a little video there of the worship after the service this about this church contains about seven thousand believers even with the camera it was difficult to get the size and after the service even the pastor everybody will just come and recognize that you know what please come back again what what you have started and this is it seems like this is the first time that when we went in we were above their doctrines just the word no Doctrine because every time any American Minister would go there he would stay with the people that believes the way he sees things and this time we included everybody even where we know that these are completely in the world we will go there as long they believe the message will go there that you know what we have the right God will come down but we've got to be the Moses that he can send the angel on us let's speak to them so that's how we work and then from there we went to another Province this is the lower church out Church inside the brother or India and some ministers and we had a ministers meeting the following day we had a three-day meetings there with the ministers meetings as well came back again to Kinshasa this is one Church this one this doesn't show it it has it has a large basement that contained over three or four thousand Believers the cry room I showed prank of one of the Kratom they have to cry room one might be just this is a cry room another one so this church should be a crime room so this they had they said on Sunday if it's packed it's 21 000. and they have another building nearby that they would put eight thousand more there so 29 000 but in this church so this is the inside of it but we brought already and I we couldn't speak there because of uh stole the brother chat about it that the ministers so we didn't feel the LED to do that for now so that's the church inside you will see the pictures of the the pastors almost over the place so we we didn't speak there but um it's a brother Randy is standing there and then you will find some small churches and to supporting supporting uh putting the roof there I said hey do what it is in a remote Village so we're helping them to do that and then this is another church brother Diego Richard has come here in 2003 when we're still in all the sanctuary and um invests the church we preached there too that's the worship this is about 11 000 when it's stacked 11 to 12. [Music] [Applause] 00 [Music] oh yeah foreign so those are your brothers then sisters [Music] he has kept the word even the worship even the yours see the life you can fully easily recognize the Believers from this Church any place because of the Stanley stand in the world [Music] it's so beautiful who cannot cover it on the cell phone [Music] and that's the pastor there in between me and brother Randy brother diyoka he has come has come here in 2003 uh preached for us here and then he has a printing facility they do the translation of the message from English into French they have completed from English and to French all the messages they are now printing messages for even other countries with fun message print for Hindu to send to India message to send to Angola message to send to Brazil to to Spain so they in many languages it's huge I I don't know what I probably took is probably maybe one tenth or one fifteenth of the building so just to show a lot of machines a lot of work and he's doing it with just a little money from his church he we we shared together he said sometimes he needs he has message books printed because of proofread and corrected but sometimes it needs a means or bicycles to send to some other areas where there's no trucks or boats or ship could could reach so these are when I show this is this is just the ink room the ink room is almost half of the congregation just for the ink of the uh of the way correctness the ink that's being used to print message books people are working there he has over 70 I think between 50 and 70 people that are full-time sometimes with a little less salary just ensuring that the message has to be printed and shipped out they're translating so that's the when they are proofreading and then we went to another church there and this we were about to come back home on Sunday we forgot that there was a brother who wanted us to preach on his church and it was Sunday we had to go to the airport we already dressed up like like Cowboys or I don't know so he said no you've got to come in you've got to come in you cannot go so we were walking in the church right now so that's Brother Andy and neither of the pulpit on Sunday morning in the congregation just to exhort to speak something that we would encourage them so I said brother we cannot do this look how he said I don't people don't care about how you're dressed up come on here so I did that and then we were happy to get back home oh brother Franco we made it over 80 slice of made it in less than an hour so that's all that we had but overall God bless you overall we we are the one to thank you and to clap hands for God for what uh he's been doing and he's doing it because there's a Moses on Earth here so that angel is walking through you guys to send us on a mission the work is great it's it's a lot so it seems like that as I've been going there with the experience there's a lot to do a lot to do the people that have received this precious word they don't know what it is they don't know what it is somebody has to to translated within their own language to tell them what is inside what is it so they have the message but they just need the people that can bring the anointing of the message to them the very life of the message to them going there I don't want to say this but I'm I'm thinking I said can I sit in the office getting money thousands of dollars with what I've seen there thousand dollars don't make any anything sense to me I would rather have maybe a few pennies but being there to help others because the time is so precious this message this is the only hope this is the only Abiding Place this is the only blood judgment is coming he's on the way and the only way we can save people it's presenting this message in its trueness so it's um it's it's changing your perspective of life what we used to see like great things in life they become completely no reason no value no value at all yeah it's a it's a great but thank you so much for sending us for all you do they are expecting as I said please do not stop this should not be the first please come on come come and visit us anytime bring us encourage us so the only purpose in every congregation we were we just want to encourage them that you are on the right path but you know what let God come in create an atmosphere let your music create an atmosphere that God could come and import life to you guys because he cannot come in shouting you're making noise you're doing everything loud music no create and they saw it as we're coming in every congregation we would just create that atmosphere and they will see they said we have never heard the word just simple word simple message but just the atmosphere was there and God could come stake the same words sentences they have heard many years and be real new to them in life was important to them many details but I don't want to take your time uh I think we have probably 10 minutes there we can if you don't mind we can stand and just read the scripture I don't have anything special just encouraging you with something that God just is burning within me I don't know where I'm going to be going with it but I just want to read it so as a word of God you can turn it into Isaiah chapter 32. and thanks again for your patience it's just a little simple thing it's not something deep I maybe maybe after I talk to my pastor he will show me more or the Lord will reveal more to unto this it's Isaiah 32 it's we can just be reading uh the first of four verses behold the king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment and a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind who heard that who heard that who saw that a man shall be as in a hiding place from the wind in the cover from The Tempest is the rivers of water in a dry place is the shadow of a great rock in a weary land now there are people that saw that and there are people that heard that what just Isaiah under inspiration is saying that a man in a man shall be as in a hiding place verse 3 said in the eyes of them that see they just saw what happened in versa 2. shall not be dim in the ears of them that here shall hearken the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge in the tongue of the stemmerer shall be ready to speak plainly it's bowhead again you can pray precious Lord we just read your word father just something simple it's burning within us as we look in the scripture we can see your your prince everywhere in what you are trying to achieve Lord through these bodies you created you ordain us to be your representative on this Earth we just love you so much as you're revealing Lord what this pride is she's seeing things she's hearing things and she can only speak be with us father bless the reading of the word in Jesus Christ then we pray amen maybe seated again just a few minutes as I was reading this just a little father is a man shall be an hiding place that's strange there because we know that God as we know it God is my Hiding Place even in the psalm uh the book of Psalm 32 verse 7 in David is speaking saying Thou Art my Hiding Place and that's God thou shall preserve me from trouble Thou shalt Compass me about with songs of Deliverance Sila and after he finished that the verse 8 God is answering to David that I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shall go I will guide thee with mine I in the prophet of God in the messenger God's Great presence they are in the message God's eye he said I love that speak I love that David speaking that God is his hiding place how I love to think that we have a hiding place that's God's Great presence can be our hiding place so in this message the prophet of God wants to show us that God great presence is our hiding place this is not only his presence his great presence and the prophet of God is going to be showing us what what is the greatness of God how is it shaped in which form his greatness is manifested he said God's Great presence can be our hiding place where we can hide from the things of the world and World troubles arrived here is our hiding place now how could we fathom the greatness of his presence the prophet of God says that he hides himself in simplicity and reveals himself in the same so meaning he's not leaving that place God is still here hiding himself in that Simplicity and revealing himself in that simplicity so he he dwells there he dwells in that simplicity and the prophet of God tells us says we don't even have time he said that Simplicity it's only the word of God when Adam and and his bride in the in the Garden of Eden God fills all space they think that God was absent when they they fell and then afterwards they heard the voice of God's presence coming them they think oh maybe he was somewhere else he's just coming back to us no it was the word because they stepped out of his word and then they were hiding from him instead of being hid in his word in in the book of Ephesians the Paul said for far above all principalities is talking about Christ that he is above all principality and power and might and Dominion in every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth filth all in all so this great presence God's presence fills all space and all time is the prophet of God says now how we're going to be hiding into this great presence that fills all time that's where the prophet of God says he's so big in the message here him he's so big that he fills the old space and yet will become so small that's where he's turning us his greatness will become so small that he will come to a poor Lost Sinner's heart that's what makes him great so his greatness is not how he can fill the space and time his greatness is not how he can Thunder but his greatness is how he can become so low and make himself so simple and come to the poor through a sinner like me and just Redeem Me the greatness of God is when he was seeing us lost because he was not surprised he always had a button for a way back his Redemption is a button for you and I to come back Israel was not going to the Homeland no they were returning back to the Homeland because they were in Abraham the promise was given so they were in Egypt they were not going to the Homeland they were in Abraham before they left the land they were returning to the Homeland and where we're not going into the Rapture we're not going to God we're returning back to God I let that button there of the resurrection of of everything returning the prophet of God preached the message wave way back so what we are here it's not something new we're just wiping our little eyes oh where am I like a prodigal son let me return back home that's all this message has come just to give us the isaf let's return back home and he is in that greatness in the returning back home where to his simple word I like how the prophet of God said that God saved the World by simplicity what can be simple than faith Faith humanely speaking it's the most ridiculous notion ever ever given to man that you don't do nothing what you have to do just take what I give you I'm the one giving it to you you don't work your way out it's just take it you accept it nothing you have to do and it's so simple and once you accept it it hides you somewhere it hides you the prophet of God says in God hiding himself in Simplicity he said when Elisha was back in that cave the smoke went across blood thunder lightning and all these kinds of Sensations we have had blood in the face and the hands in Sensations and everything they never bothered that prophet he just laid there but he heard a small still voice what was it that was the greatness if the prophet of God says that was the word he hide himself in the Simplicity of his work and he reveals himself in the Simplicity of his word so when you're finding your way back to little word that God has spoken you can anchor your soul there because that's a hiding place I'm just thinking about a little Miriam here's Moses born in their family and his mom hit him for three months in the best place ever Dad Mom brother and sister but after three months they couldn't hide him any longer so what did they have to do put him on the basket there close to the body of water now just with thinking I'm just imagining the drama of a Pharaoh's daughter coming there because she had no child coming there with all the pump with all the bodyguards and people around her they might have been hundreds don't know because she was the daughter of a pharaoh she had had she must have a lot of people following her but among all those people there here's a seven or eight years old that is taking up to speak and what she's speaking out is she didn't even ask a question she just speaking in Pharaoh's daughter right away takes that little word of that little girl there it becomes thus saith the Lord for her said can I get to your mother a Hebrew mother who can come and nurse that baby there was no question who are you why are you telling me that no question he was just little word that God put into that little girl there she never hesitated she did exactly with those hundreds of bodyguards around her she obeyed the word of little girl there and they went to get to fetch a mother's mom Moses's mother mother's mother came home to the the house of pharaoh and now I can imagine Pharaoh himself maybe one morning he is putting a decree there because he already had his degree there to kill all the children of Israel and little Moses was growing up there and Grandpa was picking up Moses little baby how you doing Moses keep quiet and he would call his people did you make sure that you killed all the Hebrew children because he must be among those children you need to eliminate him I don't want to did you do it oh Moses sorry sorry could you keep quiet the very one he's looking for head in the open hid in the word because when Mother's mother was hiding him there was no word he was she was hiding him they were hiding him with the love of a mother of a father of the siblings but there was no word so he was still in the open but when God put little words into that little girl she spoke that was the hiding place for Moses she was in the pharaoh Pharaoh's mentioned being protected by the word of his sister Moses keep quiet God's coming in how many did you kill today at Moses sorry what do you want a candy that's how God the great God works sometimes in a ridiculous way sorry to say those words but it seems like it and that's the way of Faith his hiding place is not in the greatness of him one word you can be hid there when Elisha went to Elijah went to the that widow woman who had no other just the food flour and oil just remaining for one cake that would eat and die when she just took the word of that prophet she was secured hid from the famine the entire time the feminine lasted in Israel she just took the word of the prophet and that become became her hiding place a word of a prophet how much more if you would take the word of God only the word of God it's our hiding place in simplicity and the prophet of God says remember friend don't look for great big you say God he speaks of great big things there will come a time there will be this that or the other great big things I hope you're catching what I'm taking I'm I'm take talking about great big things and oh when this comes to pass it will be great big like this and it will be so humble you'll miss the whole thing and just go right on you'll go back and say well that never did come see pass right over the top and you never even seen it see it's so simple God lives in simplicity and as we travel around I'm seeing that God I had too many things that were still attached to me I need to drop that you have so the value it's when he opens up to you the things the value drop right away said God lives in Simplicity to manifest himself in greatness what makes him great because he can simplify himself and God has looked this is he lived by him lived by himself he has looked his God the most wise God looked for the simplest form he could express himself in and that's one word and that's where his greatness dwells his word is our hiding place as we trample on it we hiding away from him we don't like Adam and Eve they thought they had a great mind they just snipped themselves they walked away from the word so they were uncovered our hiding place is in his simple word in the mystery in the fifth seal the prophet of God says let me review that just for a minute what makes God great so this is just he wants to show us I don't know if I want to finish this but he's showing the greatness of God how is he revealing himself in that greatness in that greatness is not up high it's just low down through the word he's been preaching to you every day in this place he's giving you every single day at this place God has been providing himself so you can be heard if you and I who can be here in him in his simple word said what makes God great is because he can make himself so simple that one makes him great God is great and he can make himself in such a simple form that the wise of this world can't find him they just can't find him because he makes himself too simple now watch in this in itself this simplicity greatness revealed in simplicity this in itself is the mystery of the revelation of Jesus Christ he's hiding himself in the word and other people cannot see him cannot find him because he's in the world the rejecting the word but in the same time because he is in the word the same word he's revealing himself to his bride he said I'm I'm head here to others but to you I'm revealed there can be nothing greater than God and you can't make anything as simple as he makes himself thou what makes him great and he said no God is so great he hide himself in simplicity and then reveals himself in the same thing he hide himself in how he said we know that David said the Lord the the name of the Lord is uh is a mighty tower the righteous run into it they say and and are safe oh glad we are to have his this hiding place at the end time so the name of the Lord becomes the mighty tower it's a refuge we can hide ourselves in but the Revelation in the Revelation tells us what is the the name of the Lord it's his word revelation 19 13 said and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God his greatness is revealed in his simplest what is which is his word as we take hold of of God's word we get we take a hold of his name as we take a hold of his name we take a hold of the mighty tower is also we take a hold of his name we're married to him when once you take his name you're married to him so you are married to him and dwelling in his Tower and you are HID away from the world that's who he is there's a scripture here I don't for the time sake of the time I don't want to go into there but just as we we're winding down two more minutes I don't want to keep you up in the Masterpiece and the prophet uh the identified Masterpiece 1964 the prophet of God said and when he made his first masterpiece he put him behind the word when he made his second masterpiece he was the word so his second masterpiece is the word and he was the word not behind the word but he was the word so the Masterpiece we know that it is a complete it's complete in the Oneness of a male and female does the Masterpiece can only have both male and female and this is the second Masterpiece we're talking about Christ and his bride they are to be the word his bride will be no less than God's word itself and if his bride is the word then we can read Isaiah 32 differently we can read it and a man a woman a son a daughter shall be is in a hiding place for from the wind a cover from The Tempest as the rivers of water in the dry place is the shadow great Rock in the weird land let us stand I I just don't want to drag it but how many would desire more to abide in his hiding place that tells me that you want to take every one of his word you want to live in his word in every word that he has spoken and as you live in it you are as in Hiding Place yourself let's bow our heads again precious Lord just thank you for this little report to you have Lord allowed us to witness Your Love encouraging our precious brothers and sisters and father there's no one who can help himself all it's done by you is even as you use as father with this body of Believers our family here Lord and sending us in those places father we can do nothing what we want is just we want to be standing there when you are doing it in fact that's the greatest privilege you will ever give men that when you are doing it as the prophet said I was just standing by the father who just want to be so Lord so given ourselves to you that this world has no no pull no meaning to us you have showed yourself so mighty in the Simplicity of your word and we cherish it Lord it's more than our lives it's more than anything we would ever dream about Lord our eyes have seen our ears have heard as you would even ask a question that would say in the Book of Revelation he that has ear to it to ears to hear because the spirit was to speak and those ears can only hear what the spirit says and father thank you for giving us those ears thank you for giving us those eyes to see thanks for putting in our heart father to long and desire for you and Lord just lose our lips father to speak Thy Word we believe you we thank you for all that you're doing father for our family here and across the globe I mean this evening again to you that Lord in our little broken way that father would encourage us father encourage one another to know that the time is near Lord the greatest has always been here with us and we want fully dedicated to you in all we do in all we say in our thoughts in our mind father you mean to us more than anything there's just no way to say it bless your children now father as they go home those that came in were retired exhausted sick or reflected father you'll be their hiding place tonight let them refresh within you within your word Lord as father they have Lord again committed themselves to love you to to abide in you to abide in your word Lord give us strength to to do so we cannot do it on our own or we will take you we're coming like a prodigal son father Lord we're not worthy you are worthy and father we we have messed it up Lord many many many many many times but Lord you are so merciful because you still have that button for our way back to you and we do believe Lord that we will be exactly what you ordain and promise us to be thank you love your father bless our pastor here Lord father bless Lord the work that you have ordained in this place the father is we grow that other churches can benefit father from our growth in love in humility and simplicity encouraging them Father we thank you again we love you in Jesus Christ and we pray amen God bless you all am I saying something there is a brother Shadow would come Jesus heals me oh Lord don't refuse me for sure for she there's a work that I can do and even though it's humble help my will to crumble though the costs be great I'll work for you thank you and Jesus Jesus Use Me Oh Lord don't refuse me there's a work that any tumble help my will to crumble though [Music] amen God is so good amen oh I loved what he was saying at the end that that he is our hiding place and he is the word but we're hidden the word but the word is hidden us and if we're hitting the word then the word is hidden us then we also become a hiding place oh while he was speaking I was just thinking of a quote just kept coming into my mind and I don't know that I have it exactly right so forgive me if I don't but it said the word interpreted is a manifestation of the name of God and that name is a strong tower that the righteous run into and are saved and the manifestation the word interpreted and we had the word interpreted in our day it's a manifestation of the name of God it is a strong tower that we run into amen but it's not just the tower we run into because the word interpreted is interpreting a hiding place for Christ in this day and he is hid in the bride amen God God be praised is all I can say if we only knew how safe we were in that word and with that word in Us and how secure we were wrapped up in that and that word wrapped up in US it makes us all one together we thank God for that God is so good man I so appreciated the report and what God is doing I hope you were as blessed as I was to see how God could take a vision if you remember brother Emmanuel spoke a couple years ago at watch tonight and he began to share just how he was touched by a charity work that came to him when he was a boy living in the Congo something was done for him and he saw and it blessed him he said someday I want to do something to help my country remember that and then God gave him the desire of his heart and he started doing just simple charity helping out with the poor helping with schools helping with stuff and by that God began to turn his desire and steer him to where he's at today and he's doing such a work to help the Believers and spread the word it's amazing how God can take a desire from a boy who was affected by something and allow him to have the desire of his heart and then steer it and move it to where it is today I said God be praised don't despise the day of Small Beginnings amen because if God be in it God will take it wherever he wants I'm so thankful for that I'm thankful for brother Manuel's willingness to Just Surrender it's not easy to leave home it's not easy to travel like that those aren't easy trips to make it's hard on the body it's taxing and you know he said he was exhausted interpreting I've been there I've watched it done it's absolutely exhausting the most most tired person of all is the translator he suffers more than the minister he suffers more than anybody else let's say God bless you brother amen may God give you strength amen I've been thinking and meditating for a little bit and I've talked to some of the brothers on the mission board and talked to brother Emmanuel but I'd like to make it one of our objectives at The Retreat coming up next week is to take a collection just for a need for another church it was on my heart because we've been so blessed and we look at if we're just looking at the pictures we realize that we're so blessed in so many ways if in fact if you take every way possible we have that blessing blessed in the word blessed with the facility blessed with Fellowship blessed with brothers and sisters blessed we're so blessed and even that we can go to a retreat what a special privilege that is to go to a place like that and spend time like that together and so I'd like to use that time to do something for another church as well so I'd like to take one night and we'll make it the the Saturday night service at the Saturday night service at Retreat I'd like to take a collection just for another church and you know the church where he told the story where the woman The Seventh-Day Adventist woman had a dream brother Emmanuel was telling me about that church is that they had some funds to build the church but before they could even get started so many people kept flooding in they had to build the church larger than they originally planned so they exhausted their funds and just putting up the wall and couldn't finish the floor or the roof because of the influx of people I'd like to help him get a roof amen and a floor whatever else they could do I just I touched my heart I'd like to do that so when Brother Kyle and I were brother with brother Nester at his last anniversary meetings his annual anniversary meetings he always makes it point to take up a mission collection the Third Church of their anniversary meetings for another mission work and what brother Nestor said touched me so much he says nobody give nothing everybody give something because it becomes a blessing so I think brother nesters learned and I've seen him teach it I've seen him teach it he's taught it in the poorest countries he's taught tithing and offering and giving to missions with people who had nothing because he said I've never seen it fail if people give they're blessed and so I'd like to say this for everybody if you're if you're if you're in your 80s if you're eight years old if you're five bring something even if you bring a quarter bring something and I encourage your children don't go to Dad and get something get something you've got amen give something a quarter a couple nickels a bag of Dimes whatever you got and you want to give let's all give something and see if we can't do something to bless another assembly somewhere if there's money left over that there's always more needs there's needs for printing work there's needs for those who are traveling brother dondon's taking a trip to Cambodia there's always needs in mind and now there's always needs so we'll take and see if we can't meet that need and if we do then we'll move it on to another church how many like to see that church have a roof I'd love to do that I think it'd be so rewarding while we're in the middle of huge blessings at Retreat to do something to bless somebody else not just to be a receiver but to be a giver too amen that would bless me anyway so Saturday night and I'll remind you again Sunday so don't forget kids bring bring something even a quarter and I hope I know how this goes the kids will probably outdo us so that's old folks you better bring more than a quarter amen amen these kids are generous I've watched them in Sunday School amen God bless you so good to be here it was so good to hear what God is doing and see the hunger in people I hope we never lose our appetite for the word I hope we never you know if somebody doesn't have an appetite you can hardly keep them alive you could sit him at a smorgasbord you could surround them with good food but if there's no appetite there's no nourishment I hope God God help us never lose our appetite for the word may we always be hungry for more we've been fed good we've been blessed abundantly but let's never lose our Hunger for More I need more to gain more strength I need more for more nourishment I believe I have more to grow in I want to grow amen and I need good nourishment from the word of God man from our hiding place from the Simplicity of the word may we always feed on him say God bless you let's just bow our heads and thank the Lord dear Lord Jesus we thank you God for your goodness God for your mercy and your grace Lord to us God as we watched Lord our brothers and sisters in another land lord how they're hungering for you how they're Desiring

for you too Lord let us never lose our appetite Lord help us to stay strong and healthy with a strong and healthy appetite we love you we thank you for what you've given us help us to in turn be a

Emmanuel we pray to strengthen him Lord encourage him continue to guide him Lord in the way that you've ordained for him to walk may you give him wisdom and Leadership so he would know what to do next
