[0:00] who asked for the message to come
[0:03] who asked God to send the prophet
[0:06] who asked God to fulfill the prophecy in
[0:09] our day
[0:10] he did it himself
[0:12] who asked God to come down as a son of
[0:14] man as the son of man he did it himself
[0:19] who asked God
[0:21] to make me part of the promise he did it
[0:23] himself
[0:25] who asked God to predestinate me he did
[0:27] it himself it's all his doing amen so he
[0:30] came amen and he gave himself amen that
[0:32] he might sanctify and cleanse his bride
[0:35] with the washing of water of the by the
[0:38] word amen so that he might sanctify and
[0:40] purify and present to himself a bride
[0:43] without spot or wrinkle why because
[0:45] there's a purpose behind it all and the
[0:47] purpose is all the way back in the
[0:48] original purpose that God had given Adam
[0:51] a wife and that was so he could
[0:52] reproduce himself upon the earth and the
[0:54] same thing's taking place in this day
[0:56] God came down amen like he did on the
[0:58] planes of memory he did a mighty work
[1:01] not so you could say he did a mighty
[1:02] work what was he doing he was bringing
[1:05] you a word that would cleanse you and I
[1:07] and bring us back to our virgin
[1:09] condition like we were at the beginning
[1:10] so we can meet him and have a conception
[1:14] to reproduce Christ upon the Earth again
[1:17] that's the point of it all amen and so
[1:20] many times we find we get hung up in
[1:22] certain places we get hung up and God
[1:24] sent a prophet and look at all the
[1:25] Miracles that's beautiful but there's
[1:27] something else behind it there's a
[1:30] mystery in the mystery amen we get
[1:32] excited about the restoration of the
[1:33] gifts we get cited about the Miracles
[1:35] and we get excited about the the truths
[1:37] being connected back together and the
[1:39] correct teaching that is all beautiful
[1:41] we should get excited about all of it
[1:43] but don't stop there don't stop until
[1:46] there's a conception in your soul and
[1:48] Christ Is Made Alive In You and I
[1:51] that's the purpose from the beginning
[1:52] that was thwarted by the devil in every
[1:55] Church age that's what the devil has
[1:57] stopped amen but in this one it's not
[1:59] going to be stopped because God has
[2:00] determined amen that he's going to
[2:02] fulfill his promise in this day this is
[2:05] the time there's a place do you know
[2:08] where the place is can you say by faith
[2:11] this is the place
[2:13] this is where he's going to fulfill his
[2:15] promise this is why because Something's
[2:18] Happened to me that I cannot explain to
[2:20] you but something inside of me says the
[2:22] promise is for me
[2:25] he's changed me deep on the inside
[2:28] outside I still have problems
[2:31] I still have hybrid flash I still make
[2:34] mistakes I still sometimes view things
[2:36] the wrong way misunderstand stuff but
[2:38] the change didn't take place from the
[2:40] outside the change took place in a
[2:42] private meeting deep in my soul and
[2:44] something deep inside is changed
[2:52] brought back
[2:54] to a virgin condition
[2:56] so that this could be the place
[2:59] to fulfill the promise
