[0:56] what is your imagination tell you
[1:00] what if he's here through the preaching
[1:02] of the word presenting himself to you
[1:06] what if he's here using a vessel of clay
[1:09] and and vocal cords of a human being but
[1:12] what if he's present now laying out his
[1:15] plan and his word and his identification

[1:50] presenting himself he's available you
[1:52] can get a hold of him and you can
[1:54] wrestle it out with him and you can
[1:55] start talking to him like Moses did and
[1:57] said God if you don't if your presence
[1:59] doesn't go with me don't live me Live
[2:02] Another Day

[2:05] moving forward don't let me keep acting
[2:07] like a message believer make me a
[2:09] message believe me
[2:12] I don't want to be a church member I
[2:14] don't want to be this I want to be your
[2:16] son I want to be your daughter I want to
[2:18] be your bride I need a name change and I
[2:21] need you to touch something in me
[2:23] that'll cause me to lose confidence in
[2:25] this flesh and change me
[2:27] change the way I walk change the way I
[2:29] talk change the way I think God
[2:33] Jacob could not do it to himself there
[2:35] is no Reformation for Jacob there was
[2:37] only a transformation for Jacob and the
[2:39] transformation come and meeting God face
[2:41] to face
[2:42] his transformation came at penniel
[2:45] when he met God face to face
