Let's b let's bow our heads together. Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, Father, for your tender mercies, your loving care, your great grace in our lives that has brought us back together again. And now, Lord, as we've Lord turned our hearts, Lord, to you through the singing, through the praises, through glorifying your name and lifting our voices and our hearts to you in worship. Now, Lord, we've come to come and place ourselves before you as you come and speak to us, your eternal words. For God, we want another portion of that word, another portion of yourself as you unveil yourself to us, as you teach us and instruct us. Lord, I pray you would do so by your own power, by your own spirit. May you take this vessel under your control. And may I just yield myself to you and may you come and break the bread of life. Lord, we stand here, Lord, wanting more, hungry for more of you. And I pray, Lord, that we come hungering and thirsting, we shall be filled, Lord, for that's your promise. Pray to have your way in this service with every word that's spoken. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you all. Amen. While we're standing this evening, if you could turn to the book of Ephesians, we're going to continue on uh in Ephesians. Amen. Uh I just want to say how much I enjoyed the Sunday service and I thank God for moving amongst us and thanks brother Jim for yielding himself and surrendering to the spirit of God. It was a refreshing time in the Lord. Amen. And also I want to let you know that this Sunday our brother Gabe Smith will be traveling out of town to minister. He'll be going to Dton, Ohio to preach for brother Steven Goulsby. So remember him and his family in prayer as they travel there and back and as he ministers the word there as well. Amen. While we're standing, let's take a look here at at Ephesians chapter 1 and let's just read verse one. says, "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus." So, is this letter written to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you take your seats. Amen. God be praised. If we could pull up the overhead and we're going to start in, I want to go into the to the next step here. as I was studying and looking at this subject, uh, Brother Rem tells us that Ephesians parallels Joshua. And so, I want to take a look at that. So, I I I trust you all enjoyed the Bible study last time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if we if we had a if we had a good Bible study, let's have another good Bible study today. So, I'm going to kind of do the same format. I think we'll see how it goes. But, I enjoy just slowing down and going through the scriptures from time to time and and I I and I hope to do that again. So, just keep your Bibles handy. Remember remember our rule. If you fall asleep, you get to stand and read the scripture. I don't know if I'll ever actually make anybody do that, but I I love saying that. Amen. It makes me feel good. Anyways, amen. So, if we look at this, if we look at this uh quote here from adoption says, "Now, as we study together, I'd like to say this that this book of Ephesians perfectly parallels the Old Testament. Joshua, Ephesians, the book of Ephesians. So I want I want to see what brother Benham says about this and I want to look into this ourselves because as brother Benham says it parallels Joshua. I want to know how. I want to know why. I want to know in what way. And so we're just going to take a look at that Lord willing this evening. Amen. And as we do, I want you to notice that I think most every quote, almost every quote that I'm going to use tonight comes out of brother Bam's adoption series from 1960. So we're going to use quotes from adoption one and two and maybe three or four. I don't remember now, but but it's it's amazing that in adoption, he's telling us Ephesians parallels Joshua, and that's what he's going to get into. It has something to do with adoption. So, I want that in your mind to begin with as we move forward. Let's go a little further in Ephesians and turn to uh let's stay in chapter 1, but let's look at verse 7 together. in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace. wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we shall be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of your inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory. So as we read this, we find out that God did all of this according to his purpose, by his predestinated plan. And his predestinated plan was according to his will and according to his purpose. And according to his will and purpose that he was going to have grace by his grace, he was going to have favor upon us. And he was going to bring us into an inheritance in Christ because he was going to gather everything into Christ, all things which are in heaven and earth in him. And we are included in that. And we're found with an inheritance in that. Amen. Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Why does this matter? Because the book of Joshua is all about their inheritance. Their inheritance. What God had promised to give them when they were as children of Abraham. He promised to give them the land. Amen. And now uh Joshua, the book of Joshua is bringing them across Jordan into the land to possess their inheritance. Amen. In Ephesians parallels Joshua. Amen. Where Paul is bringing the church. Amen. by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into the land into Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost to possess every promise that is ours. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's a parallel that brother Brandham was pointing to. We'll we'll read a few more quotes uh to show this God who's rich in mercies. As I was speaking last Sunday on the Ephesians, how that the book of Joshua was the Ephesians of the Old Testament and how it was a book of redemption and redemption has two different parts. Come out of and entering into first you have to come out. Some people wants to bring the the world in with them. But you got to come out of the world to enter into Christ. You see, they had to come out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then they had to come out of the wilderness. They had to cross Jordan. They had to go all the way into the promise. Amen. And so, you've got to come out of the world to enter into Christ. You have to come out of unbelief to enter into faith. There cannot be one thing in your way to really have genuine faith. You must absolutely leave everything that's contrary to the word of God behind to enter into faith. And that was the book of Ephesians of the Old Testament, Joshua. So he keeps running this parallel uh back again to the adoption uh yeah adoption part one. Did you notice Joshua before they crossed Jordan, Joshua said, "Go through the midst of the camp and clean your clothes and sanctify every one of you and let no man come at his wife for three days. You'll see the glory of God." See, it is a process of getting ready to inherit the promise. So he's showing us there was a process and he's going to type it two ways. One, he says there's three days. Amen. He He says, "Wash your clothes." Amen. Come not at your wives. Amen. Separate yourselves and prepare. You're preparing for what? You're preparing to cross over Jordan. And he says there's a there's a process of getting ready to inherit the promise. Then he's going to type it to three stages of the journey. So now the promise to Israel, God gave Abraham the promise of the land of Palestine and it was to be their possession forever. And they was to always remain in this land. Now they come three stages coming to the promised land. Now watch it's perfectly typed in the New Testament. He goes on and he says there was three stages of the journey and there is three stages of this journey. For we are justified by faith, believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, forsaking the land of Egypt, come out and then are sanctified through the offering of his blood, washed from our sins, and become pilgrims and sojourers, claiming that we are seeking a land, a city that is coming or a promise. So, brother Benam is typing our journey through through justification, sanctification, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, coming out of Egypt. Amen. being separated through the wilderness journey and then a preparation to prepare to go all the way into the promised land. And that's how he's typing it. Amen. Here with Joshua. And so he says, let's go to Ephesians chapter 2. Ephesians chapter 2. Um I think I'm going to read from verse one. Yeah. And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedience, among whom also we all had our conversation in times past, and the lust of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath. Uh yeah, children of wrath, even as others. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ. By grace ye are saved, and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. So when we were dead, when we were in the world, when we were dead to the things of God, and separated and alienated, Amen. God by his grace had already made a provision for us in Christ. And he did it before the foundation of the world. Amen. But now you see Israel down in Egypt. They're dead to the promise. They're separated from everything. They're out of the promised land. They're as a dead nation, bound up in slavery. Amen. But there was a promise already made before. He told Abraham, "Thy children show Jordan in a strange land. But I'll bring them out with a mighty hand." His grace had already provided a deliverance. Amen. By predestination, by grace alone, not by their merit, not by their effort. Because the promise to Abraham was an unconditional promise based on grace, &gt;&gt; based on the will of God. And so they're down in Egypt, dead as a nation, dead to the promise, separated from everything, and no ability to do a thing for themselves, to deliver themselves or bring them into the promise. But God, amen, God by his infinite mercy, God by his fornowledge, God by his grace and his predestinated plan, he would come and raise them from the dead by his own hand. He delivered them with a mighty arm. Amen. What arm? His arm. Amen. He used Moses, but it was the hand of God. And he come and he delivered them himself by his own power. And that's what he did in Jesus Christ. He delivered us himself by his own power. It wasn't anything we did. It wasn't anything we could do. We were just as bound in slavery. We were just as separated from the promise. We were just as dead as the people of God as as they were in Egypt. But God brought us out by a mighty hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Goes on to say, so Ephesians here sets us like Joshua positionally. You notice Joshua after crossing over the land and taking the land. Then he divided the land. Ephraim here, Manasseh here, and this one here, Gad here, Benjamin here. He divided the land. And this is where brother Benhams is breaking down how Ephesians types Joshua. And if you go back to chapter 1, we're going to go back to an important scripture that he's going to reference. Chapter 1 of Ephesians, verse three says, "Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. So here in the first chapter of Ephesians, he's telling us we were predestinated but there was a purpose in predestination. We were predestinated unto adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the predestinated plan of God for all our adoption and we were predestinated unto adoption of the children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. Not even according to our own thinking, our own desire, but the good pleasure of his will. So let's look at that as we continue on it again in adoption two. Your adoption is not your birth. Your adoption is your placing. When you were born again, John 1:17, I believe, when we are born of the spirit of God, we are sons of God. But we were predestined. Now, here's what I'm trying to get to you. For his sons of the last day, you see, see, we were predestinated unto adoption. Now, here we now here we are. Now, this is what hurts Pentecostal a little. They say, "I got born again. Praise the Lord. Got the Holy Ghost." Fine. You're a child of God. That's right. But yet, that ain't the whole talking. That's that ain't what I'm talking about. See, you were predestinated unto adoption. Adoption is placing a son. &gt;&gt; So, we weren't just predestinated to be born again. Amen. We were that was part of the plan of God. But we weren't just predestinated to be born again. Amen. Because then we would be born again and God would let us uh expire and we would go on to the sixth dimension and wait for the next phase. But that's not the purpose. The purpose was we were predestinated unto adoption. Amen. That's why we were born again so that we could grow under the tutor of the Holy Ghost all the way into the adoption to the placing that he wanted for us from before the foundation of the world. Because remember, God's plan foresaw you doing something for the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's adoption. God foresaw you participating. He foresaw you in action. He foresaw you with gifts. He for foresaw you working his plan. He foresaw you as a son or daughter of God. Amen. And that's why we were predestinated unto adoption, not predestinated just to birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They weren't just predestinated to enter into the land. Amen. In Joshua's day, but they had a specific place. They were predestinated to a position. Amen. In that position, Moses already spelled out that position. Jacob already spoke over them when he was dying. And when he drew his before he drew his legs up into his bed to die, he placed his hands on his sons and he positionally placed them in the land and spoke prophecy over each one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then in the journey, Amen. Then in the journey, Brother Brandham says those Hebrew women under labor pains. Amen. They would begin to speak the positional placing of those children as they were being born. And I don't believe they're I don't believe they said by the river Kedron, &gt;&gt; but they were speaking their tribal name. I mean, they were this was a birth of Ephraim. This was a birth unto Judah. This was a birth unto Manasseh. This was a birth unto unto Simeon. And that would place them in a specific place in the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then Moses would come along and Moses would tell them, "There's a place I'm dividing the land. It's going to be these dimensions and this is going to be how it's structured. Amen. But Moses never got Amen. Moses didn't cross Jordan. They went across with Joshua. Moses didn't place them in the land although he spoke it. Amen. The one who placed him was Joshua, a type of the Holy Ghost. Put them in their position. &gt;&gt; Remember this is Ephesians and Joshua parallels Joshua and it has to do with adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. So adoption is the placing of a son says but now to place. How are you're first born into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost. How many knows that? All right. The next you are predestinated unto what? Adoption. What is that? You are predestinated unto placing. Amen. I just want to slow down a minute because I get rolling so fast. I I mean for some people that's not fast. For me that's fast. For some people that's still slow. Amen. But but there's such a sometimes such a striving and such a striving and such a striving. Amen. For the new birth. And there should be because we've got to be born again by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; It's essential. It's the starting place. We've got to be born again by the spirit of God. But then after you see somebody who settles their salvation in their heart, Amen. That's not the end of striving because we be should be striving for placing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't just stop. You know, somebody's born again. That's it. Woo. We made it. We crossed the line. We got in. I'm I'm I I'm secure. Listen, in the mind of God, you were secure before the foundation of the world. But you needed the experience of the new birth. Because you need the life, the power of the Holy Ghost to come in you to shape you for what? For placing. Amen. &gt;&gt; To give you the power to act out the word, to give you the power to live the life that he wants us to live. &gt;&gt; And so it's not, you know, the new birth isn't time to say, "Woo, I crossed the finish line and I'm going to go on vacation." &gt;&gt; We just got started, friends. &gt;&gt; That's just the beginning line. That's just where we begin. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Ephesians chapter 2, back to 2:8. For by grace are you saved through faith and not of yourselves. It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. We for we are his workmanship. That means his creation what he made. We are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. So he we are saved by grace through faith and not of ourselves. It's a gift of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not of works lest any boast. It wasn't anything we did, but he he did it and he did it for a purpose because he does have works for us to do &gt;&gt; because he created us for such. &gt;&gt; He made us to do something. He made us to accomplish something. He made us for a purpose. He called us for a purpose. He saved us for a purpose. He gave us his spirit for a purpose. And that was ordained before the foundation of the world. He says again, now who could doubt that? That's what Paul said. That's Paul's scripture. That's Paul's writing. That's what he taught his church. The church positionally before the foundation of the world when God in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do. He positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife, to be a farmer, to be a preacher, to be a prophet, to be a this or to be a that. He placed you positionally. Then when we have come from the gardic lands of Egypt through sanctification is baptized into the promised land. For the promise of God is the Holy Ghost. Ephesians 4:30. Grieve not the Holy Ghost of God whereby you are sealed into the day of your redemption. I love this quote because I mean this the quotes and other quotes like this to me are such stabilizing quotes &gt;&gt; because he says he positionally placed you into his body when before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; to be a housewife &gt;&gt; to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to be this or to be that. Sometimes when we think of positional placing in the kingdom of God. Amen. Sometimes we think too high. Amen. &gt;&gt; We start thinking of an office or an officer in the church or or something that takes place on the platform on Sunday and Wednesday. But listen, this this isn't the church. This is a building that we've set aside for our gathering together, for the preaching of the word, for the worship that we do communally together. But the church is you. Amen. You're the church. The body of Jesus Christ. Wherever you go is the church. Not just here is church. Church is everywhere the body of Christ is. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when he positionally places us in the church, it wasn't positionally placed during the church service position but in the church body. &gt;&gt; I hope that helps because sometimes we think brother says you know what can I do? He he makes these statements what can I do? I'm just a mechanic. I'm just a this. I'm just a that. He said that's exactly where God wants you to be because that's where he wants his life to emanate from. He's positionally placed you there and there's a sphere of influence that you have and he wants to use you there. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that's the only place that God will use you. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean it's the only thing that you're going to ever do and the only position you ever have, but it's the position you're in. Amen. &gt;&gt; One thing that I've I found in my own self and through others that I talk to many many times is when we look uh when we look really hard and we're striving for position and we get the wrong idea of what that means to strive perfect position. I think sometimes we forget the position we're in. &gt;&gt; Right. You know, even in the in the uh example that brother Benham gives us of a son that's coming to adoption over his father's estate. He's a son, but he's put under tutors. He's learning lessons because he's going to need those lessons later. Listen, I I'm just going to say this and I I hope I hope it comes understandable. But when he's there learning his lessons under the tutor, he's in position, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; That may not be the goal. That may not be the entire destination. That may not be the only thing that he he's destined for more than that. But at that time, that's his position. His position is to learn the lesson. His position is to learn to follow the word of the father. His his position is to learn to listen to the tutor because the tutor knows the mind of God. &gt;&gt; He's learning a lot and he's in position. And if he stays in position, God will keep moving his position. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if he try, brother Bam says we try to climb the ladder too high and we skip the rung and we fall and we break our necks. &gt;&gt; We try to over climb things because we have our own ideas of things instead of just being positioned by God and saying God, amen, teach me everything I need to know today. Amen. Help me to be sensitive to your spirit. Help me to be alert to the thing that you're teaching me. Help me help me to grow. Help me to learn. Help me to manifest you right where I am today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I say this many times, but I believe we should as Christians, we should bloom wherever we're planted. Wherever you're at, every whatever position you're in, if it's in the home or out of the home, if it's in school or if it's in work, wherever God has planted you, we should be blooming out like Mr. Lily. Amen. Coming up through the muck of this world and letting ourselves bloom out. Amen. so that everybody can enjoy the beauty and fragrance of Christ, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ that's living in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's not take positional placing and and and put and defer it too much. &gt;&gt; The father's in control of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, the father's in control of the positional placing of the son. And the father's responsible for the adoption process. &gt;&gt; So, all the son can do is respond to the lessons of the tutor. and the tutor's checking up with the father and the father's moving the program along. Amen. So, so don't worry about what am I supposed to do five years from now. Amen. Let's try to figure out what we're supposed to be doing today. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I promise if we are predestinated unto adoption and we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus and good works which were before ordained that we should walk in them, we're going to get there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just would like to get there easier. with &gt;&gt; yeah with less detours. You know, &gt;&gt; I'm tired of repeating grades. Let's put it that way. &gt;&gt; I may be in the fourth grade, but I'm tired of seeing this fourth grade desk for the third time. I'd like to go to fifth grade. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad you foresaw it all and had a plan because I would have sure messed it up, failed, and &gt;&gt; whatever. probably wouldn't have got out of spiritual kindergarten if it wasn't but by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he goes on, he says, "When did you did you notice Moses, that great miracle performer that brought down Israel down through the land and brought them up to the promised land, but did not place their inheritance to them? He did not give them their inheritance. He led them up to the land, but Joshua divided the land to the people." Is that right? And Christ brought the church up to the place where their possession was made to them was given to them just the Jordan to cross. But the Holy Spirit is the one who sets the church in order. The Joshua of today puts the church in its order, giving to each one gifts, places, positions, and he is the voice of God speaking to the inner man that Christ is saved, the Holy Spirit. Now, do you get that much of it? Now, we're getting over into the book of Ephesians. Now the same way he's positionally placed the church where they belong. Now Joshua placed them in the natural land. Now the Holy Spirit is placing the church positionally in the land in the position that they belong in their inheritance. So is that what God's doing for you and I. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Let's turn to Ephesians chapter 4 now. Ephesians chapter 4 and I'd like to look at verse seven and 8. But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men. Whatever we have in us, whatever's been imparted unto us by the by the mind of God and by the Holy Ghost is grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not us. It's God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. But everyone in his kingdom, in his economy, every one of his children, everyone has been given a grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men. He didn't leave anybody with nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no one with nothing. &gt;&gt; Everybody's been imparted a measure of grace of the gift of Christ. And for that we should glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because of that, God has designed it so that we need each other. And and that is also a wonderful thing. Let's look at further down here in Ephesians chapter 4 and let's go to verse 11. And he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive. But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him and all things which is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. This is positional placing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this is the body of Christ moving into do adoption, moving up into the perfect man. And he starts talking about the ministry gifts that he gives that are the ministry gifts of Jesus Christ. And and as far as apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. Amen. They're given for a purpose. They're given for the building up of the body of Christ. Amen. And as they they build up till we all come in, basically saying till we all come into the stature of a perfect man. Amen. And this is being built up in us, but it's also being built up over seven ages. It's coming through the stature of perfect man, building the church back to that perfect image of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when that body comes together now, when they come when they coalesce and come together, Amen. under this building up of the body under this uh measure of the stature of fullness of Christ, it is so that we're henceforth no more children tossed to and fro and carried about by the slide of men and the cunning crabs whereby they lie and wait and deceive, but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ. Now verse 16. From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by by wi by that which every joint supplieth. Now he started off talking about a five-fold ministry. He talked about a ministry gifts of Christ that came to build up the church. But that wasn't the end of it. &gt;&gt; Because now as the church comes together and is built up, Amen. It's it is it is from from the headship of Christ. The whole body has to be fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supply. Now it's not just what the five-fold ministry does to edify. Now it's compacted together and fit together by what every joint supplies. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the purpose. according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. Making increase of the body, building the body, edifying, building up the body in love. Who's now responsible for building up the body? It's not just a five-fold ministry. It's every joint that supplies. It's the effectual working in the measure of every part that Christ is working through every joint, every part in this body to what? Amen. To increase the body unto the edifying building up of itself in love. So the building up of the body of Christ is not just the work of the five-fold ministry. It's the work of every part as it supplies. Every joint as it supplies every part supplies every part that's in position. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's become super super important. Amen. Brother M said, "Even if it's just a little tip of my pinky, I want it to stay right there. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what the joint is, what the part is." Amen. If we think that we're the lowest of the lowest and I'm the worst of the worst. Listen, I don't care if you consider me the lowest of the lowest and the worst of the worst. As long as I'm part of that body, I can be the most minuscule part joint that there is. the most the most uncumbly part, the thing that nobody sees and never gets noticed and lives all of its life working in the internals and nobody ever knows what the spleen does or what this cell does or whatever this thing inside my body. There's so many things in my body, I don't know what it's doing. &gt;&gt; I don't even know what the name is. I don't even know what the function is. I don't even know how many parts there are. Amen. But but they're all working together to increase me, to edify me, to build me up. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm It doesn't matter what part we are as long as I'm part of that. Amen. What g more glorious position can we have to be part of the body of Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. Amen. And and usually what usually what I find and what I happen what happens to me most of the time when I talk to people, they they they uh undervalue their contribution to the body. Almost everybody you've heard the same thing. I don't really do nothing. I don't And you're looking at them like what do you mean you don't do nothing? Like you you're you do more work than the rest of us. We love everything you do and you do this and you do that. Everybody else can see it, but we ourselves so many times can't. So we undervalue ourselves and we belittle ourselves. But listen, God didn't birth you into his body to do nothing. He didn't he didn't leave you without a measure of grace according to the gift of Christ. He didn't he didn't tag you on as an extra part that doesn't supply anything. We're all here to do something for the kingdom of God. And this has everything to do with positional placing. Has everything to do with the book of Joshua, the book of Ephesians, has everything to do with our whole life and our purpose for being here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So my advice, I've given it before, but I I'll give it again. &gt;&gt; It's free, &gt;&gt; so it might be worth what you paid for it. Don't worry about what you're supposed to do. Just do whatever comes to your hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do what you like. Do what you're inspired to do. Do do what you find yourself doing. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it. God will positionally place everybody. Just do what whatever your hand find it to do. Do it with all your might. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And be happy in doing it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Be happy in doing it. Don't don't don't ever use anything God's given you to do as a stepping stone to something else. &gt;&gt; Because if you use any position or anything, a gift or anything that God has given you to do in the body, if you use it as a stepping stone to something else, I got a feeling you're going to stay on that stepping stone and that stepping stone will become a landing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because that's not the right attitude. right attitude. Whatever God has given me, whatever I can do, I want to do it with my full heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this this next quote, Brother Be says, "But when they are born and positionally born into the kingdom of God, then the Holy Ghost is set in the church, some apostles, some prophets, some teachers, some pastors, some evangelists. Then he's given into theirs speaking with tongues, interpretation of tongues, knowledge, wisdom, gifts of healing, all kinds of miracles. When the church, now this is my purpose of doing this. The church is always trying to take somebody else's corner, but don't do that. You can never raise corn in Ephraim's corner if you're Manasseh. You've got to take your place in Christ. Positionally take it. Oh, it gets deep and rich when we get in here. how that God puts one in the church to speak with tongues another. Now, we have been taught many times we all have to speak with tonesues. That's wrong. We all got to do it. No, we don't. They all didn't do one thing. Each one was the land was provided and divvied up by inspiration. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram goes on to explain this out of the book of Joshua. He says it was given divvied up by inspiration. They didn't all do the same thing. They all lived in different parts of this land. And this land is very diverse. If you look at the nation of Israel, there's mountains and there's plains. There's river sides and there's oceanside. There's the the the coast of the of the uh of the sea of whatever Tiberius, Ganesserat, uh all kinds of names, but anyways, you know what I'm talking about. And where were they positionally placed? It had to do with what occupation they would do, whether they grow wheat, whether they they'd raise goats, whether they'd raise sheep, whatever they would do, whether they'd be fishermen. Amen. So, they were positionally placed in the land. Amen. and they had to do what they were placed to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the benefit of the whole nation. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Bam's referring to. Now, let's go over here to uh if you would with me to First Corinthians. Keep your place in Ephesians. We're going to come back to Ephesians, but let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse 4. 1 Corinthians 12:4. Now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit. There are differences of administration but the same Lord. There are diversities of operations but it is the same God which workketh all in all. I want to just pause for a moment. I don't want to go too fast. There's a diversity of gifts &gt;&gt; but the same spirit. There are difference of administrations but the same Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there are diversity of operations but the same God which workketh all in all. &gt;&gt; So there's many gifts but there's many ways they can be administered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's many ways they can operate. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So they don't all have to look the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. You start running the calculations on a variety of gifts with a variety of administrations with a variety of operations. There's nothing cookie cutter here, friends. &gt;&gt; It's all unique to the way the spirit leads your gift in administration and the way the spirit leads it in operation. &gt;&gt; So, let's not compare ourselves among ourselves. Let's just go the way God leads. Let's just do as God leads us. Amen. Let's continue on. Uh verse 7, but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all. So each one's been given it for everybody else. For to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit, to another faith by the same spirit, to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another diverse kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these workketh that one and self-same spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. &gt;&gt; Who divides it out? &gt;&gt; The spirit. &gt;&gt; Not our will, but his will. &gt;&gt; Now, let's go skip over to verse 27. Says between there, he starts talking about the body and how every joint's not the same and not everything is an eye, not everything's a hand, but everything's needed. Then he goes to verse 27. He says, "Now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular. And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, diversities of tongues." I I love this list. &gt;&gt; Amen. What's interesting about this list when we've been looking at all this when we start when when many times when the gifts of the spirit are preached on only three or four are emphasized &gt;&gt; you know tongues and interpretation and miracles and things like that but but look what he's listing here he's listing wisdom he's listing knowledge discernment of spirit he he he he's listing faith now he comes down here and he's saying some are placed into the church amen uh uh gifts of healing helps Amen. &gt;&gt; Helps. &gt;&gt; Has you ever heard anybody preach a sermon on helps in the church? &gt;&gt; As gifts of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Have you ever heard anybody getting really fired up talking about what we need to gifts of the spirit? We need the gifts operating in the spirit. Why aren't the gifts operating in the spirit? And and nobody says what we need in here are some helps. We don't have enough helps. I got to see helps in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You realize if we want the gifts of the spirit, we want all the gifts of the spirit. We want everything. We don't want anything excluded because we need to we need joints that supply. We need everything working together. We got to have the spirit working in every one of us. Brother Benham said God put the gifts in the spirit. He never took them out. They're supposed to be there operating in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. But don't get discouraged if if your gift isn't one of those that's visible and that manifest in the service. Amen. There's gifts of the spirit that's given for all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it can be helps. Amen. &gt;&gt; Governments, diversities of tongues, are all apostles, are all prophets, are all teachers, are all workers of I get these are hypothetical, right? You understand the answer to all these is no. &gt;&gt; Can you pass the test? &gt;&gt; Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of a miracle? Have all the gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? But covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show unto you a more excellent way. And he's going to show that when he gets down into love in the next chapter, but we're not going there today. Amen. We're moving on. He says, "Ephraim don't want to stay." One of them go over here and we find Manasseh just over here say, "Oh my, the Lord's given me a good corn field." Then here comes over here. Gad said, "Well, now now wait a minute." Said, "I'm supposed to raise oats, but I'm going to get corn, too." Hallelujah. See, you ain't got nothing to do with corn. Get oats. Oats is your part to raise. You ain't supposed to herd sheep when you're supposed to herd cattle. God wants to place the church. But every one of them wants to do the same thing. &gt;&gt; Diversity of gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Diversity administrations. Amen. And operations divided severally as the spirit will. &gt;&gt; I say, God, help me to be whatever you want me to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Where am I? Well, let's just read on. Let's see where we are. He says, "Now, the book of Ephesians, as I was just saying, no, no, no, no, no." Oh, yeah. I know where I'm at. Don't read. I went too far, too fast. I want to turn to the book of Joshua and read something real quick and then come right back to Ephesians 5. So, if there's a way you can save your spot, please do. So, I want to read uh to Joshua. Let's go to Joshua 23 cuz remember we're looking at Ephesians parallels Joshua. And let's go to Joshua 23. I'm going to begin reading at verse two. And Joshua called for all Israel, and for the elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age. And ye have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto all these nations because of you. For the Lord your God is he that hath fought for you. Behold, I have divided unto you uh by lot these nations that remain to be an inheritance for your tribes from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward. And the Lord your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight, and ye shall possess their land, as the Lord your God hath promised unto you. But ye therefore be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that you turn not aside there there from to the right hand or to the left, that you come not among these nations, these that remain among you, neither make mention of the name of their God, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourself unto them. But cleave unto the Lord your God as you have done unto this day. For the Lord hath driven you, driven out from before you great nations and strong. But as for you, no man has been able to stand before you unto this day. One man of you shall chase a thousand for the Lord your God. He it is that fightth for you, as he hath promised you. Take good heed, therefore unto yourselves, that you love the Lord your God. He's about ready to part from them and he's giving them some final instructions here in in chapter 23 and 24. And he's and he's and he's laying out what God has done for you. God has done this for you. God has brought you into this land. God has given it to you. And in verse in chapter 24, he says, "God gave you a land to inhabit that you didn't build. Olive olive vineyards that you didn't plant." Amen. Uh uh uh wine vineyards or grape vineyards that you didn't plant. Houses that you didn't build. God did that for you. That's grace. &gt;&gt; But make sure that you keep going and you stay true to him and stay separated from the world and don't take the gods that are around you and don't go back to the former gods from your father. And he's instructing him all this in chapter 23 and 24. He's telling him, "God did this for you. God brought you out. God brought you in. God gave you the land. God drove out the inhabitants. Now you go possess the rest of the land, and God will drive them out from you. God is the one who fights for you. Not one man shall stand before you. 10 a thousand shall flee before one man. They can't stand before you because God's for you. &gt;&gt; And then he says, "But you better stay with God." &gt;&gt; Don't go back to the old ways. Don't go back to the gods of these other nations. Don't go back to your former gods. Amen. That that they served over the other side of the flood. Talking about Abraham and Tara. Amen. when they were idol worshippers &gt;&gt; said don't do that stay true to God and love God &gt;&gt; man remember Joshua par parallels Ephesians let's go to Ephesians now Ephesians chapter 5 Paul comes to Ephesians 5 you remember the first three chapters is grace the next three chapters is works instructions and he says in chapter 5:1, "Be therefore followers of God as dear children, and walk in love as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice uh to God for a sweet smelling savior." But fornication, and all cleanness, and covetousness, let it not be once named among you, has become a saint. Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient, but rather giving of thanks. For this you know that no whoreonger, no unclean person, no covetous man who is an idoltor have any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. Be na ye therefore partakers with them. For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord. Walk as children of light. For the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth, proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light. For whatsoever doeth make manifest is light. That wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise the dead, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. See then that thou walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. And be not drunk with wine where it is excellence, but be filled with the spirit, speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. You see the parallel between Joshua when they were in the land telling them this is what God did for you. Now do this. &gt;&gt; And he comes and he tells them the same thing through the book of Ephesians. This is what God did for you. You're predestinated this. God did this before the foundation of the world by his grace, by his own purpose. You've been called. Amen. You're saved by grace. You've been called unto good works. All of these things he lays out. He said, "God did all of that. Now you do this." Amen. Keep yourselves separated from the world. Don't partake of all of these things that are around you. Stay consecrated, sanctified, separated for the purpose that God called you for. &gt;&gt; Ephesians parallels Joshua. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we move on, I want to take this last little part here because we know where did they fail? Where did Joshua fail? They were taking the land, but before they could fully possess it, before they had all of the inheritance under their control, they started to slip up by making covenants and agreements and putting nations under tribute. And then their sins, they started getting attracted to. And everything Joshua told them not to do, they started to do. And they fell before they completed their entire purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we know the first church did the same thing. Paul told him, "God has brought you out with a mighty hand. God has delivered you from darkness, from the realm of darkness. God has brought you unto himself. He's birthed you into himself. Amen. By the blood of Jesus Christ, by the spirit of God, he's brought you into your inheritance. He's brought you into all of these places. Now stay here. &gt;&gt; Don't go back to the former lust. Don't go back to the things of the world. Don't go back to the things that religious systems are doing. Don't do that." But the church failed. They went right back to it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we see Ephesians parallels Joshua. But here something Brother BM says that I'd like to conclude on. He says, "Now the book of Ephesians, as I was just saying, to my opinion, is one of the greatest books of the New Testament. It leaves us on where Calvinism runs out on a limb and Armenianism runs out on the other limb, but the book of Ephesians draws it together and positionally places the church." Now, I've typed it with Joshua. If you notice, Israel was brought up out of Egypt. And there's three stages of their journey. One stage was leaving Egypt. The next stage was the wilderness. And the next stage was Canaan. Now, Canaan does not represent the age of the millennium. It only represents the age of the overcomer, the dispensation of overcoming. Because in Canaan, they killed and burnt and took cities. &gt;&gt; This is important because what did he type moving into the promised land for us in Ephesians? Going into the Holy Ghost, baptism. Amen. And so the Holy Ghost baptism isn't yet millennium. Amen. Because he's showing there was still fighting going on. There was still things that were happening. &gt;&gt; He says it again this way. In this promised land, everything belongs to us in the promised land. See, brother Collins, see everything in the promised land. When Israel crossed over this Jordan into the promised land, fought down everything. Now remember, in this promised land, that don't mean that you're immune from sickness. That don't mean that you're immune from troubles. But it does spell this. Oh, let this sink deep. It says this that it's yours. Just rise and take it. &gt;&gt; When they crossed over to their inheritance, it was a promise that was given to them that was given to their father Abraham. They were included in the promise by an unconditional covenant of grace. God says, "I will do this." Amen. And God, according to his covenant of grace, did it. He brought them out with a mighty hand, delivered them from bondage, slavery, darkness, and death, and brought them back to life. and brought them back into the promise that he gave them and get the boundaries, divided them into the land, promised his power, amen, to help them overcome every enemy if they would just keep fighting and stay separated. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the same thing happened, amen, to the church. It's happened to us. Amen. God brought us out with a mighty hand. He delivered us from darkness. He brought us from dead, the deadness of sin and darkness of unbelief and resurrected us to life and brought us in by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into his promise. Amen. But in that promise, there's troubles. There's difficulties all around. You're not immune from sickness. You're not immune from fighting. But it does tell you this. This is your promise. Take it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what he promised to you. his own life to give you the power to conquer every enemy, to overcome every obstacle. No matter what faces you, he's already promised his promise inside of you to help us overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we got to stay separated. We got to stay separated from the world, separated from the religions of the world, stay consecrated to God, stay in love with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. This is where the first church failed, but this one, listen, this bride's not going to fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say it many times, not because she's better, smarter, uh not not because she's better educated, none of that. Because he's predestinated her not to fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. This church by the power of the Holy Ghost is going to stay separated. She's going to stay separate from the world, separate from religion, separate from man ideas. She's going to cling to the Lord. She's going to love him, separate from everything else, and overcome and take all the promises. If it's promised in the word, if it's in the New Testament, it's for you. &gt;&gt; Rise and take it. Possess the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd like to go to one more scripture if you'll go with me to Ephesians chapter 6. Praise the Lord. The blessings of heaven are pouring upon it. &gt;&gt; Amen. We could try to spiritualize it and make something up, &gt;&gt; but praise God. Amen. The blessings of God are falling. Amen. Now, let's look at Ephesians 6:10. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand in the evil day. And having done all, having done all to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girth about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, your feet shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God. Praying always with all supplication and uh with prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints. This is the last instructions that Paul gives to the church in Ephesians. Then he goes on and asks for prayer for him and brings some greetings. But the last instruction that he says is be strong. Be strong in the Lord and the power of his might. &gt;&gt; He gives them instructions. Be strong. And it's almost like when God instructs Joshua, be courageous and be not afraid. And Joshua instructs the people, be courageous, be not afraid. Go take the inheritance. &gt;&gt; And now the last instructions. He's given us what God did for us. We've given us who we are in grace. What we are by predestination as children of God. Predestinated to adoption. Amen. Saved by uh grace through faith. He gives us all of that. Then he gives an instruction for living a separated clean life to be useful for the kingdom of God. And then he finishes with this. Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. Because we're not wrestling with flesh and blood. He's saying, listen, I'm leaving you with this. You're headed for a spiritual battle. You're going to fight every day of your life to inherit the fullness of this promise. doesn't mean you've stepped into the millennium yet. There's still fighting. There's still war going on. There's still things to conquer. There's still places to overcome in our own lives. Amen. There's still promises that we want to see manifest amongst us in our own lives. Amen. But in order to do that, you're going to have to take on the mentality of a warrior and not get lazy because that's what happened to Israel. Israel stopped fighting and started farming. Amen. They stop fighting and move to the pleasures of their inheritance and stop pressing for the fullness of the inheritance. &gt;&gt; So what does it denote? He leaves them with these instructions. Get your armor on. &gt;&gt; Put your shoes on. Strap your belt on. Get your sword in your hand. And be praying all the time. Amen. Because this is not a physical thing. This not a physical inheritance. It's a spiritual inheritance. It's a promise that he's given us. And what is the bride? She's the New Testament. That's all. So, whatever is in this New Testament is for us. Every promise is given to us by the Holy Ghost, by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. His blood purchased for us everything. His his his life returned to us to give us the power to possess all. Amen. Let's keep moving forward. Be a soldier. Don't be lazy. Don't start settling down and establishing ourselves and making wine and having feast. Let's keep moving forward. and let let's move until we get the fullness of the inheritance in our possession. &gt;&gt; And what's the fullness of the inheritance? A new body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be happy till I get a new body. Why? Cuz it's my promise for this age. And I'm not going to stop pressing. I'm not going to start taking my inheritance and living in my inheritance. Amen. and staying separated from the world and staying consecrated to God and loving him above all and keeping my mind and my heart and my body focused on him and keep myself under preparation of battle all the time because this inheritance in order to fully possess it is going to require a fight. &gt;&gt; But praise God, he equipped us for the fight. Remember, Ephesians parallels Joshua. And Joshua says, "Go take the land. You fight. I'll be with you. &gt;&gt; I'll fight for you. I'll drive them out. You go fight." &gt;&gt; It wasn't sitting back on their heels twiddling their thumbs while God drove them out. No. God says, "I'll fight for you when you're fighting. &gt;&gt; I'll drive them out when you're driving them out." Amen. And God will do the same thing for you and I, friends, when we're pushing against the devil. He'll push the devil out of the way. Amen. When we're taking the sword of the spirit with a strong hand of faith and driving through the heart of the enemy, he'll get behind us by the power of the Holy Ghost and push that sword forward. &gt;&gt; But we got to put on the full armor and be a warrior in this battle because Ephesians parallels Joshua. &gt;&gt; Does that is that more clear now &gt;&gt; than it was? I love these Bible studies. My goodness, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham is so wonderful. The gift that God put in him, the word that God brought through him. &gt;&gt; There's little nuggets that were dropped for us, friends, we begin to understand where we are and the picture and what went wrong, but what it takes what it takes in this hour to fully possess the promise. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so excited to know that we've crossed Jordan. We're taking the land. He brought us back to our inheritance &gt;&gt; and it's to be fully possessed &gt;&gt; for all of it. For all of it. Praise God. That's all that I want to share on that subject, but I've got one more small thing that I want to share with you. Uh if you can bear with me for just another moment. I got done early, so I had a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a a little bit of confusion over a sermon that was preached here just a little bit ago and it was when brother Alistister was here and he preached on the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost and it left a question in some people's mind. So I've been fielding a few questions from within the assembly and from outside of the assembly. So I just wanted to take a minute to clear up what I thought was a little bit of a confusing point. And uh it took me a little while to get to this because I wanted to wait till I could talk to brother Alistister before I I I brought this clarification because I wanted him to know first. I didn't want to just get up and say something and him hear about it. Uh so I had to wait till he got home and I've been able to talk to him now twice and we're at we have a very good understanding. we've talked um but actually when I talked to him about uh when he started in the sermon talking about the the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost and he started separating them as two different things representing two different things through the Bible and that the King James translators had a different purpose in using them. I found it for myself a little bit confusing. I was having a hard time. I understood what he was saying but I I had a hard time piecing that together. And then but the rest of the sermon I absolutely loved when he started showing us that the real purpose for what he was ministering was to show us that there's a difference with the Holy Ghost bringing gifts and actions and acting through a people and the person of the Holy Ghost indwelling the soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those were two very different things. He's trying to show that he was trying to show teach the lesson on Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost separating them and the New Testament to show us that point. &gt;&gt; So that point is exactly what brother Brandham taught. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the the way he got there I thought was a little confusing and it's had some confusion uh for the people. And there's a quote where brother Brandham answers this question. So I'm just going to show it to you. He said, you know, brother told us that he went down this study because of a question that somebody asked him about the difference between the Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost. But brother Brandham fielded that same question and he said it this way. He said, here's the question in bold. We know that the blessed holy spirit is not given to vain repetition in laying out the holy scriptures. So please tell me why the word holy spirit is used sometimes and the word holy ghost is used some other times. I know that there is a valid reason for this and I would like to know why. Brother Brenham's answer it is the self-same word. A spirit and a ghost is the very same thing. A ghost or a spirit it doesn't matter. They're just the same. Self-same. So I think this is what was a little bit confusing because this is brother Brandham's answer to that question is that there is no difference between ghost or spirit. They're the self-same. And the question was how they're used in the New Testament. One times it's uh uh holy spirit, the other times holy ghost. And brother Brandham says it's no difference. And so for me I like staying with what the prophet said. I think it's simple uh and not to complicate it. And so that's what I wanted to bring to you because I don't want anybody reading their Bibles and going through and saying,"Well, now is this what did Alistair say? What is this? Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost." I think Brother Brandham just made it super simple. &gt;&gt; Self, same word, a spirit, a ghost is very same thing. Ghost or spirit doesn't matter. They're just the same self. &gt;&gt; Uh the the same same self. So I hope that makes it clear for everybody who might have been a little confused with that. And then also in the Bible, I'm just going to show a couple uh uh uh scriptures in 2 Peter 1:21. I want to show what Brother Benham said. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of men, but by the holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. And so here we have Holy Ghost, which is uh only used in the New Testament, but it's referring back to an act of the spirit of God in the Old Testament. So it's the same spirit that's working. It's just working in different manifestation. And that's really what Alistister was trying to show that the Holy Ghost works in conjunction with man by different manifestations in different ages. &gt;&gt; And I concur with that. I thought the message was sound. &gt;&gt; But this ghost, the word ghost is the Greek word numa. It's translated spirit 111 times and it's translated holy ghost. It's not actually translated holy ghost. It's only translated ghost. Holy is a different word 89 times. So it's translated both spirit and ghost. And this is one of those examples of spirit. He therefore that despiseth despiseth not man but God who hath also given unto us his holy spirit. This word spirit is the same word as ghost. That's what brother bram said. It's the self-same word. There's no difference and it's used interchangeably uh in the bible. I'll show you another place in Acts 2:4. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance. So the question is which spirit gave them utterance? The Holy Ghost that they were just filled with. So here ghost and spirit is the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. And here I'll do one more uh Acts 20 uh 22. And and now behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there, save that the Holy Ghost witnessed in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. So how did the Holy Ghost witness them in every city? Through gifted individuals speaking by the Holy Ghost. And we saw that when he comes and and there's prophecy over him through I think it's Agabus who starts to tell him that he'll be bound when he goes into Jerusalem. So he's telling them that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city saying the bonds and afflictions abide in me. And then in Acts 21 says, "And finding disciples, we tried there seven days who said to Paul, who spoke to Paul? The disciples who said to Paul through the spirit that he should not go up to Jerusalem." So here it was the spirit speaking through these disciples he shouldn't go. But before he said it was the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So you see they're interchangeable. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, in defense of of Brother Alistar, Brother Alistister in his sermon, he said, now Brother Brandham uses them interchangeably. They're interchangeable in the Bible. They are the same word. They're interchangeable. He did say that. So, I want I want to make clear he did say that. But then when he went on into the lengthier description, I was afraid that some of that understanding got lost. So, Brother Alistister, I talked to him and he understands uh where the confusion is. And I told him that I was going to bring some clarity, at least to my understanding. And he wanted me to make sure that I I shared his apology to everybody. He never meant to make anything confusing. He wanted to apologize. And he also said he sure never intended. He he he said, "I do not feel like we need to to nitpick the Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost and pick it apart." That was never his purpose. His purpose was to demonstrate that the Holy Ghost is the spirit of God. The spirit of God is is is God working in and through man. And he's worked in different ways and dispensations over time. But God is showing us in this end time that that there can be a brother Bam showed this in anointing ones at the end time and other places that there can be a Holy Ghost, the true genuine Holy Ghost of God fall on somebody and cause them to do the works of the Holy Ghost. But it's different than the person of the Holy Ghost entering into the soul, the true new birth experience. And that was absolutely spot-on. &gt;&gt; So I en I enjoyed the sermon. By the time it was over, I was right in line with him. I enjoyed what he said. I enjoyed the conclusion. I enjoyed the point. I enjoyed all of that. Brother Alistister's a wonderful brother and his ministry's been a big help to me. &gt;&gt; And we love him and and we we enjoy his ministry. We have confidence in the brother. I just I didn't want that. I didn't want anybody to read what brother Brandham said and get confused. I just wanted to share with you from that perspective the the way that I see it and I think it's clear the way brother Brandham shared it also I told I told brother Alistister I said the title is just a little bit hard you know he says well that wasn't supposed to be my title I said what he says my title was the purposeful life amen he puts his subject before his title amen but brother Franco didn't know that so he took a subject put it up as his title he goes that was never supposed to be my title so Franco changed changed it. He found out so he changed. So it's now it's titled the purposeful life. So anyways, God bless you. Let's all stand together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians, if you want to come and brother John, if you can make your way up. Amen. Let's bow our heads and pray together. Dear heavenly father, we thank you Lord for this wonderful day that you've given to us. We thank you, God, for your word that is so rich and so true. And God, we thank you that you sent a prophet in our day and vindicated that voice &gt;&gt; so we knew who to listen to. Lord, we knew where to go for you to uncover the truths that are laying there for this hour. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're so thankful, God, that you showed us that Joshua and Ephesians type one another. and we can see and learn by the example in Joshua and what happened in the first church age and learn what we're supposed to be doing in this hour. God, I pray that you would help us, Lord, to be grateful for all that you've done for us. That we would look on your amazing grace, your predestinated plan, your purpose for our lives, and we would just rejoice, God, that you did something for us we could never have done for ourselves. And may we in turn, Lord, separate ourselves from every other life and everything else in this world and everything else all around us and dedicate ourselves solely to you. And God, help us to put on the full armor. Help us, God, to fight against, Lord, the ws of the devil, taking on this word and placing it upon ourselves and each in a fashioned place, Lord, for defense. And let us take up the sword and push back and fight against the enemy. Help us, Lord, to take all the land. Lord, where they failed in Joshua's day, where the first church failed, God, you've predestinated this church not to fail, and you sent your power down to make sure it would happen. Help us to live, Lord, in that inheritance. Oh God, we give ourselves to you, Aresh, and pray that your power would come, &gt;&gt; to give us overcoming power. God, as we fight, would you empower our fight? As we press back, would you push with us? Would you give us the power to overcome every obstacle, every challenge to your word that comes in our lives? May we take the word and move forward boldly, God, when everything comes to challenge our walk, to challenge our thinking, to challenge our speech, Lord. May we may we with your spirit move into the inheritance and take all the promise and push through every hindrance and obstacle that the enemy would set in our way. For God, that's what you've called us to. You've called us to adoption. You've called us to our position. You've called us to our place. And this is the hour not just of personal adoption and placing. This is the hour you want to place your bride, Lord, in her full glory, coming to full maturity with the headship, united with the headship of Christ. You want her to come to her position. And Lord, for that to happen, we each one have to stay in ours. Help us, God, to stay in ours. We love you, Lord Jesus. We ask for your blessings upon us. Guide us, Lord, by your word. Direct us, Lord, by your truth. Help us to stay sensitive to your spirit and pliable in your hands that you might use us any way that you wish. We love you and we ask your blessings upon this service, upon our lives. And as we go from here, may you help us, Lord, finish the race that is set before us. We ask for your blessing over all this in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. &gt;&gt; Oh, keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. &gt;&gt; For there's a race that I must run. There are victories to be won. Give me power every hour to be true. Oh, keep me true, Lord. Jesus, keep me true. Oh, keep me true, Lord. Jesus, keep me true. Oh, there's a race that I must run. There are victories to be won. Give me power every hour to be true. Oh, keep me true, Lord. Jesus, keep me true. Oh, keep me true, Lord. Jesus, keep me true. Oh, there's a race that I must run. There are victories to be won. Give me power every hour to be true. I'm standing on the promises of Christ my king. Oh, through eternal ages.
