and done may all that we do be pleasing to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you as you're standing let's take our Bibles and let's go ahead and turn to Matthew 26 and just want to say I appreciated that testimony Brother Kyle shared and it was such a blessing to see God touch people's lives when there's an Awakening that happens and it's like something fresh comes in my heart again and I remember when I heard the truth and what it did to me and it's just so exciting to see that God is still calling his elect and appreciate that and so we pray that the Lord will continue to use Brother Kyle as he goes down there next Sunday so pray for him as you know I'm going to be heading to Oregon I've got weekend meetings this coming weekend over there with brother uh Rich Cobb so we appreciate you praying for me and uh so while I'm gone the brothers here will be ministering brother kywx will be ministering on Wednesday so please pray for him he's got a youth meeting uh today this afternoon he's got Wednesday service and then Sunday service so I'll be praying for you brother amen and then Sunday brother Gabe Smith will be preaching here for us and then the following Wednesday brother Benjamin seabo will be taking the service so if you could just be remembering those Brothers in prayer come expecting pull amen and see what God will do also uh when I get back we'll be just a couple days from going into the uh the look at the stars that we're going to do out of brother Elmer and sister Emily's and I'm so looking forward to that amen it'll be a good time where we just look at the the Bible in the Stars amen that God wrote and and it's just for fun this is not preaching we're not having a service a preaching service we're just going to go and enjoy ourselves and have fellowship and enjoy looking up a little bit amen amen so let's look at Matthew 26 and I'd like to read from verse 6 Matthew 26 and: 6 and when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor when Jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me for you have the poor always with you but me you have not always for in that sheath poured this ointment on my body she did it from my burial verily I say unto you where wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial of her those words still ring true because we're telling of it this morning as a memorial of what she did amen God bless you as you take your seats amen so the disciples uh were watching what this woman was doing and it seemed uh exorbitant it seemed like it was over the top too much it wasn't necessary and and uh and we know brother R speaks much of this and we're going to get into that in a few other scriptures as well but but when they looked at that they had indignation and we know the main culprit here is Judas we'll find that out later that Judas was not liking what he was sing because he had the idea that that this could be taken and sold and given to the poor and that seemed so righteous but we know down deep inside it wasn't righteousness that was moving him or motivating him to say that but uh and we'll get into that in a minute also but we see that what this woman was doing she was doing out of a pure heart she was doing by inspiration she was moved Amen to do something that was unreasonable she moved to do something that was not choreographed she was moved to do something that and and and like we were saying before she was doing something she didn't have to do there was no commandment nobody had come to her no no religious leader showed up to her and say hey you need to do this there was nothing she could uh find written in the Bible that says if you ever come and see the Messiah unwelcomed in a house you should go buy ointment you understand there was something that motivated her something that moved her something from within that was pulsating and she went and did something which to others looked ridiculous ulous amen even in her own mind she she may not have understood exactly what was going on she was just pushed from within amen and she was doing something she had to do there was something driving her and it was also something she wanted to do amen it wasn't something she had to do because it wasn't a commandment it wasn't something she had to do it wasn't like she was going to to fail the Commandment it wasn't she was going to be kicked out of church if she didn't do it it wasn't that kind of action it was an action that was motivated by the spirit of God it was another leading from within there was something motivating or pulsating in her and she didn't not cuz she had to but because she wanted to amen and so we want to look at that and we're very much uh I I want to uh uh Preach Today in the very much in the same lines that we've been ministering the the last few services and and I just pray that God will just take me and take me wherever he wants because uh as it usually goes you know you get so many things and so much inspiration and so many thoughts I have no idea how things are going to go I have no idea we can go two different directions well we're probably more than that in my mind I'm looking at two different directions but there's probably a multitude of directions we can go in but I don't care which direction we go as long as it's Direction he leads amen and so I'm just praying that God will have his way and I'm doing all I know to surrender to that and so brother bandham says in the unwelcomed Christ speaking of this same story says but I see her go up and she looks over over there and she sees him oh she said that can't be surely that must be him well it is him and he's not welcome he's got dirty feet and he's unano and nobody's paying attention to him she said surely somebody's got to do something and I see her pull her little shawl up around her and down the street she goes as hard as she can she goes up in the little old creaky steps in her little room and she goes into a little chest and gets out her little sock or something there with some money in it and she said no no I I can't do this I can't do it and she started weeping she rolled those eyes how he looked over at me and brother brandom starts dramatizing this story about the the the woman uh the Harlot woman The Prostitute and she saw Jesus in Simon's house unwelcome unano and me with unwashed feet and it did something to her and she she couldn't let it stay that way and and and it's amazing how right in the house was Jesus Jesus had come because he was invited but he was unwelcome it's amazing he came because he was invited but when he came he was unwelcome because those who invited him had ulterior motives they had other motives for inviting him so he was invited in but he was invited in for another motive and he was unwelcomed when he came brother BR taught us that Jesus keeps his appointments and he comes where he's invited and it's it's interesting that Jesus could be right in our midst he could come because he keeps his appointment he could come because he's invited he could be right here in in Simon could take some sort of Pride maybe in saying Jesus is in my home the prophet the one the campaigns are all about he's right here but in actuality it wasn't a blessing for Simon that Jesus was there it end up being a condemnation he could be proud about it but there was no reason to boast because Jesus was there yes Jesus was there Jesus came cuz you invited him there but just having Jesus in the house is no reason to boast it could be your condemnation because if he's invited and he comes but he's not welcome amen it's amazing we could take pride in Jesus was at my house but was he welcome was he kissed was he embraced was he anointed were his feet washed so the very presence of Jesus in my house and the way way I treat Jesus in my house may not be my blessing it may be my condemnation amen and so this is where she finds Jesus now and he's in this situation and there's something in her that she she she can't stand to see him unwelcomed she can't stand to see him unano she can't stand to see him unkissed and his feet unwashed and there's something in her if if nobody else will do it I've got to do it but she's having so many second doubts second thoughts and doubts about herself how can I can't I can't go into that place they know what kind of woman I am then she goes and runs upstairs and she goes to get her money but she saids no I I can't do that and then she says but oh how he looked over at me brother says nobody could ever look at Jesus and ever be the same she said that I must be beside myself look I know he's a prophet and he know where I got this money he know how I got it I can't take this to him I just can't do it she puts it back she's weeping said oh think of it nobody wants him I've got to do something about it and she takes her little sock out again her little uh chest and she looks at it and she said oh surely but it's all I got it's all I can do surely he will understand and I see her tuck that little money down in her bosom and throw her Shaw over over her and down the street she goes and she goes into a little jeice store down there where where they're selling some nerd and stuff in a perfume shop and she goes in and some old fell sitting there grouchy counting all his money my it's been a bad day didn't hardly make the rent oh my and the first thing you know this prostitute walks in well look what come in he didn't go out as a polite salesman or a gentleman should be and say what could I do for you he said well what do you want she said sir I want the best Alabaster box you got in the house not just anyone I want the best look she was giving everything she had every penny she had to give the best she could you you and I we just give a little side thing are you giving your best if you're not giving your best don't make fun of her she was giving her best and and her oil she had she said I want the best Alabaster Box you got of ointment well he said let's see how much money you got of course the clinking the money changed his idea he counted out 280 pieces of Roman daer and and just enough he gives her the alabaster box and man I I looked up just to try to find out what sum of money that she paid for this Alabaster Box and I don't know that anybody knows for sure but the estimation that I heard they came up with was about a equivalent of a year's salary so it's it and you know and inflation's going crazy so I don't know when these numbers were posted they number if they were posted 3 years ago you can add maybe 20 25% but it was approximately 54 to 55,000 54 to $55,000 this was special ointment that was imported from India and she didn't get an ounce of it she got the alabaster box will H from whatever quantity that was and so I don't know that that's an accurate number it's just what I found I don't know how they determined that but take it for what it's worth it was it would the Bible says very costly very costly brother bam tells us it was all her living she had earned it in a distasteful way she had earned it but brother B begins to tell us he begins to give us a backstory on this woman that she didn't want to be that way but she was turned out of a child and and this is the only thing that she could do but what she was saving this money for is she was saving it to get herself out of this life she was saving it up to get out of this cycle of prostitution to get out of this work she she didn't like it she didn't want it she didn't want to be there amen and so what she had done is scraped together every penny she could she had even brother bam talked about skipping meals and that's why she was attracted to the fragrance coming from the feast because she was hungry and she was trying her very best to purchase for herself a way out of this lifestyle a freedom from this bondage that she was in so she had labored she had worked and she had she had she had sacrificed and she had scraped together all of this and here in a moment she's willing to give to the last scent yes to Christ something in her this listen she doesn't have to do this but she has to do this oh that's when we get down to the reality of something amen when we don't have to do it but we have to do it I don't have to do it to satisfy anybody else I don't have to do it to satisfy a law I don't have to do it to make it to heaven but inside I have to do this there's something driving me I can't hold back I have to do this it's something pushing me pulling me I'm motivated by something I have to give more I have to give all I have to surrender more that's when we get to reality friends that's what God's looking for he's not looking for her money it wasn't the money amen it was her desire it was what the reality was that was moving her now when we look at this what what possibly is the sum of money that she had spent on this amen and and and and the scripture tells us that she broke the alabaster box listen I don't know about you but if I took got some perfume and I got a box of alabaster box full of perfume however many ounces that would be amen and and I had spent nearly $55,000 on this perfume I'd be careful in the the way I carried it and I would I would be tempted as a human being to open that up and break the seal and maybe just dip my fingers in it and maybe sprinkle a little bit on his feet because you know I I mean it's the same thing right right I'm I'm anointing amen I I I I need to anoint his feet I'm going to anoint his feet that wasn't what was in her heart it wasn't in her heart just to do something halfway and just still preserve herself and preserve her money and say sa something of herself when she got there listen it said she broke the alabaster box amen that's a point of no return that's no going back when she broke it she can't put it back in it's gone 54 $555,000 and that's not just money it's her chance for Freedom it's her hope for an escape out of bondage Breaking Free from a lifestyle she could never get free from she what she poured out on jesus' feet was not a fragrance of an oil she pulled out the fragrance of of a life she gave up her life she gave up her hope she gave up every chance that she had to finally get free she gave it up to pour it out on Jesus's feet and Simon sat there gloating that he was a Pharisee and Jesus was in his house wouldn't welcome him wouldn't anoint him wouldn't serve him cuz he didn't want to lose face with the other Pharisees didn't want to be an extremist didn't want to look like he was part of the group but had him in his house my with all my heart I want to break my box with all my heart I'm tired of Dipping yes tired of tired of taking my life and just trying to pour a little out and preserve a little I'm tired of that all my heart I want God to give me the strength something inside of me pushing me from behind not because I have to with all my heart I want to break that box my hopes my dreams my self-preservation my reputation my everything God helped me to break my body box to shatter my own life and my own hopes and my own dreams and my own everything else everything that's me let it be broken At His Feet let me anoint him not with not with a little bit of change in an offering plate but let me anoint him with my whole life poured out at his feet and that will be a sweet Savor that'll fill the house Jesus goes on in the message Jesus keeps all his appointments says she went and brother Ben's making kissing sounds you can hear in the microphone as he's dramatizing her down there weeping pouring out the water flowing from her eyes in Repentance washing his feet and kissing them kiss his feet and cry and wash and wipe and kiss his feet again you know Jesus if he had moved one foot she'd have jumped up and ran out of there but you know he just sit there and let her do it you know if you want to do something he lets you do it it may be all out of order but he'll let you do it anyhow amen the the disciples didn't understand what was going on Jesus had a greater understanding he knew that he was being anointed for his burial but how was he being Anointed with a life that was being poured out and and another thing that's fascinating is brother Ben said he let her do this amen he knew this and he let he let her give her whole life he let her sacrifice everything he let her give up every penny that she had he let her do that and if you want to pour your life out he'll let you too he'll let us he won't stop us he's not like us where we say now listen sister that's okay just a little bit will do oh she poured it out and nobody instructed her to no nobody made her feel guilty for having the money nobody preached a hard sermon on giving that day nobody made her feel bad that she had a big savings of nobody pushed her persuaded her coerced her right but she was driven by another Force let's turn to Luke chapter 7 and let's read about some of this in Luke chapter 7 Luke chapter 7 and verse 36 if we could turn to 36 and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment I want you to notice in verse 37 there's one important word there Behold a woman in the city which was a sinner she was making a transition right now that was her condition but she's moving from sinner to Saint amen she was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meet in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now when the Pharisees which had bidden him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known unto whom not what man or woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner and Jesus answered and said unto him Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee he said Master say on Jesus now wants to teach a lesson this Pharisee he begins to condemn Jesus for allowing this woman to touch him because in the Pharisees mind she's a sinner in jesus' mind she was a sinner how long does it take to work your way out of Sinner to not sinner doesn't take very long friends right and so he begins to talk to him about a a parable about a credor and who loveth much but I want to move down to verse 44 and he turned to the woman and he said unto Simon seest thou this woman I entered into thine house and thou gavest me no water for my feet but sheath washed me my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou do not anoint but this man hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little was forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven she didn't go to church she didn't go to an altar she didn't put anything the offering plate she didn't make a confession she didn't shake the preacher's hand she didn't decide what church she was going to attend right amen she gave everything to Christ she served him with her whole life he said thy sins are forgiven and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said unto the woman thy faith has saved thee go in peace what she was doing was an expression of an inward faith that she had not a commandment but a faith she was moving by faith she was operating by faith she was led by an inward something telling her this must be done and her faith expressed in the action and it wasn't the action that saved her it was her faith that saved her but her faith produced the action and the action testified to everybody around why she was saved amen but but to her G was saved by faith amen but it was that same faith that moved her to give all to go into complete action brother bam said in the voice of the sign he makes this uh statement which I love he said like the little woman with a pure heart and a defiled body and the Pharisee with a pure body and a defiled heart it condemned one and saved the other one he had Jesus in his house but his heart wasn't right he had a position in the church and he had maybe some of his colleagues there and he had the great Messiah he had him there but his heart wasn't right and when Jesus says her sins which were many are all forgiven and and and he looked at her and says thy sins are forgiven thee and and he says thy faith has saved thee listen it's such a a contrast between the Pharisee and what other religious leaders were there they believed that they were saved they believed their security came because they were in good standing with the church and they had kept certain rules and regulations and they had kept certain orders and and they had certain positions and Prestige and acceptance in a certain category or group of people and they they felt secure in that but here is Jesus amen the very word of God made manifest amen the message of the hour is sitting right there and because he's in the house amen and because of all these other things they feel pretty good about it yeah I want more than having the message in my house I want to give my whole life to anoint it and serve it and worship it bear the reproach and wash and kiss this beautiful Christ that been delivered to us she had a defiled body but a pure heart so I ask you which one worked the pure body or the Pure Heart was the Pure Heart amen amen in John chap 12 if we could just flip quickly flip over there John chapter 12 John 12:4 then said one of his disciples John 12:4 then said one of his disciples judas's scariot Simon's son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 p and given to the poor this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bear what was put therein we we looked at Simon and we looked at this prostitute woman but I want to look a little bit at Judas now the Bible said he was a thief and had the bag and bear what was put therein this is really interesting language because he had the bag and it didn't say that he be the bag he bear what was put there in that means to Bear means to carry or to lift that means that Judas wasn't just carrying the bag he was carrying what was in the bag Judas was a thief he was robbing out of the treasury of Christ Ministry right cu the Bible said he was a thief he was a thief and he had the bag and he bare what was put there in he was skimming off the top we could say yeah yeah Psalms 51:6 said behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom Judas if we look at the life of Judas Judas was chosen by Jesus Christ to be a disciple Judas did not ask can I be your disciple and he didn't send an application in and he didn't show up one day and say I'm your disciple but Jesus said unto them have I not chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil see when did he say this he said it in John chapter 6 and in John chapter 6 Jesus is dealing with the Pharisees and he starts to deal with the Ministerial Association and he the word is coming so hard without explanation people are walking away and walking away and Jesus said in John 664 but there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him listen he's not speaking of just Judas now he's talking of those in the 70 in the Ministerial Association that are going to walk away Jesus knew from the beginning who believe not but he let them be part of the campaign Ministry he even sent them out two by two Amen to go preach the gospel in the cities amen and they went ahead of him preaching the gospel they had part of the ministry they were ministering the word and they came back saying the devils are subject to us yeah right they had healing they had manifestations they were in the ministry of Jesus Christ they were in the campaign they were in what God was doing for their day they weren't Outsiders they were insiders am and it said Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not if Jesus knew from the beginning why did they let them have part of the ministry why did he let them go from Village to Village why did he let them speak on his behalf and go be as a forerunner before he came into those Villages and start to testify of the Gospel the good news and the day and hour they were living in why did he let them do that he already knew furthermore he knew who would betray him he knew Judas was a devil but yet he says have I I chose you [Music] 12 Jesus picked Judas Judas didn't pick Jesus amen when I look at this sometimes I just I just think how how can these things be when when we think about what causes so much strain so much trouble in the church and people's lives you know how many people reference false Ministry I'm all tied up because I saw hypocrisy I saw somebody leave the message I saw false Ministry they preached the word but then they left what about everybody in the village that heard these men preach right what about the people that were healed by Judas laying hands on them and praying for them yeah right you know people would have had confidence in Judas because Judas had gifts yeah right god-given gifts y people would have confidence in Judas because Judas was always sitting at meat with Jesus they would have confidence with him because of his close proximity to Christ yeah and furthermore Jesus chose him to be the treasurer yeah right well if Jesus chose him to be a disciple one of the 12 and Jesus chose him to be a trustee then surely he's God's choice is God's man there's not going to be any problem here but his heart was a thief and Jesus knew it yeah and who did Jesus give the money bag to the thief everybody else would be confused by this but Jesus isn't confused he say why why would God allow that why would God allow false Brethren why would God allow Judas to Fall Away think about the people that were confused by what but Jesus made him a Treasurer and Jesus was always talking to him and Jesus sent him out and when they prayed we were all healed and now they say that this isn't the Messiah and they've run away and now Judas betrayed him and went and hung himself what am I supposed to believe yes what am I supposed to do how can I trust how can I ever trust a minister again how can I ever trust this message how can I trust how can I trust Jesus that's not what people say but that's actually the problem yeah no one's going to say how can I trust Jesus how can how can Jesus allow that man to become pastor of the church when he has that thing hidden in his life and then later it all comes out and WS havoc and it wrecks the whole church how could Jesus let you can't tell me that was God how now how am I supposed to ever trust another Minister how am I supposed to yes and the reality is it's not the minister you're not trusting it's the one who picked the minister right amen it's the one who put him in that position it's the one who let him be your pastor or the Evangelist who led you to the Lord or or the close brother you were associated with that shared the message with you and then later fell in adultery and ran away or denounced the message how could God do a thing like that he's always done a thing like that why because God has got to get to the heart he's got to find out what's inside amen and he gives everybody an opportunity so just because Jesus comes to your house doesn't mean everything's fine and just because you have a Ministry and just because you pray for the sick and they're healed and just because he makes you the treasur sorry brother Dean we love you brother sorry brother we believe in you but we're watching see you understand people ask questions legitimately so they were hurt legitimately so wounded absolutely confused without a doubt amen amen amen but where is that outside the scope of the Bible where is that contrary to the way Jesus acted when he was on earth right it's not ex an excuse to pull away amen from the word that God laid out in our day it's not an excuse to pull away from church it's not an excuse to pull away from fivefold Ministry it's not an excuse to pull away from the Brethren right it's a reality yes it's it's true is it wounding it's hurtful it's all of those things but it's it's not contrary to the Bible and it's not contrary to the nature of Jesus Christ amen so many people I imagine were quite confused by Judas I think the disciples themselves were quite confused with the 70 who walked away yeah probably quite discouraged yeah Jesus goes on to say in John 665 and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then said Jesus unto the twel will you also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God Jesus answered them have not I chosen you 12 and one of you as a devil je Peter says and we believe who was standing there the 12 who is included in we Judas amen and we believe and are sure that thou art the Christ the son of the living God and Jesus answered them not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil what an statement for a loving God to make see God doesn't he's not a man like we are and thinks like we are he thinks different than we do if somebody made a statement like that we would we would absolutely feel so like that was so unjust and so unfair how can you look at 12 who just said that they believe you to be the Christ the son of the Living God that you alone have the words of eternal life and you with no heart no feeling no love turns around and says yeah but one of you is a devil and doesn't explain who it is and leaves all 12 of them to wonder and to pray and to agonize and have self-doubt right Jesus doesn't do that yes he does but he doesn't do it anymore he only did with the disciples see the situations are always going to be such that the elect seed is going to have to pop out and manifest itself has to it has to God knows that there's something planted in the soul of the predestinated that'll you pour concrete on it it'll come around you put it in the middle in the bottom of a bog it'll push its way up like The Lily to the sunlight it's going to go through the mud and the murky water why because there's a life inside that will Express itself and God knows it and he's not afraid that it won't happen he's not afraid to let you go through church splits and heartbreaks and have people lie about you be rejected have your very close Associates and turn their back on the message and condemn you for still believing it amen he he he's not afraid to let all of that happen because he knows there's something in the seed that'll grab that word and will give out their life and pour out that fragrance and not hold back and go all the way and it's got to be made manifest I said before Jesus says this and when you really just stop and think about it Peter just says Thou alone have the words of eternal life Thou Art Christ the son of and thou alone there's no place else for us to go we're trusting you we're loving you you're everything to us and you speak truth he turns around and says yeah but one of you is a devil and I'm not telling you who I don't know about you but if I was standing in the group he said that too I wouldn't have slept that night yeah mhm I may not have slept for a few nights we have to be careful that we don't make the righteousness of God unjust and condemn it and say things about God we ought not to say he knows what he's doing he knew what he was doing here with these disciples he knew what he was doing with the 70 he knew what he was doing in Simon's house and he knew what he was going to do for that prostitute yeah amen she had to have an opportunity to express so that she could have life she had to push her way through muck she had to work her way around the concrete the life had to come out am amen God's going to God may allow a little concrete to get poured over our lives he may allow the seed to drop into muck and M and dirt and dark stagnant water but he knows if he just shines the light the life will come to the life and it'll all be all right in the end friends heartache sure scars absolutely but in the end it'll be all right Jesus in John 7 17 you don't have the term it's going to quote quickly he's praying he says while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of predition that the scripture might be fulfilled so then we find out that not only did Jesus choose Judas Judas was given to Jesus by the father my goodness my goodness let's turn to John chapter 12 I'm sorry John Chapter 13 John Chapter 13 and let's go to verse 26 Jesus answered and he it is to whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped it and when he had dipped the soop he gave it to judas's scari the son of Simon and after the soop Satan entered into him then said Jesus unto him that thou doest do quickly we know that Judas was ordained to a certain position but Judas also was part of the ministry he says uh in the church age book we just went through this this past Thursday at the Bible study so it's really fresh to me in uh the sardan church age brother Brenham says Judas was numbered with the 12 and actually had a part with them in the ministry previous to Pentecost and he he quotes acts uh 1: 16- 17 men and Brethren this scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas which was guide to them that took Jesus for he was numbered with us and had a obtained a part of this ministry the part that Judas obtained this is Brother brandham again the part that Judas obtained amongst the 12 and then lost was neither inferior to the ministry of the other 11 nor was it a devilish foreign Ministry interjected amongst the ministry of others it was part of the ministry of Christ it was a true Ministry with true results because the disciples knew that somebody else must take that Ministry that's where they drew lots and and they chose Mias but that was man's Choice it was actually supposed to go to Paul so it wasn't like the ministry he had was devilish it wasn't false it was true just because he was a devil didn't mean the ministry he took part off was devilish right just because he was an error and would fall away doesn't mean the ministry of Christ that he partook of and had a part of was any less than the other 11 and it doesn't mean the Miracles were less and it doesn't mean the truth was less truth it means he was false he goes on in in Acts 125 the prophet quotes that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place Judas a devil lost a god-given holy ghost Ministry there we go could God do it again I believe he can Judas the devil lost a god-given holy ghost Ministry and killed himself and went to his own place his name was even uh in the book of life but his name was blotted out so we find out now that that Judas of course was ordained to a certain position but he had his name in The Book of Life he had part of the ministry of Jesus Christ you can't get much closer in proximity and in position and even preaching and even manifestation of gifts it doesn't get much if you could say it doesn't get much better it doesn't get much better or closer than Judas but when he comes to verse uh chapter 13 and he said when he dipped the S and he handed it to Judas and the devil entered into Judas and he says what thou doest do quickly listen you can say you know what could Judas do the devil entered into him or the devil just entered into him he went and did what he did but when we go go back and we recognize what was in Judas all along when Judas saw this woman give her whole life and sacrifice everything she had to anoint Jesus Christ he had indignation in his heart and he said why wasn't this this is a waste amen what was he calling a waste a pure worship where somebody gave their whole life to Christ yeah said this is a waste amen why wasn't this sold and given to the poor but he said that because he was a thief and he was dipping out of the bag amen and and listen I don't I I I know Judas was ordained to a certain role but somewhere along the way Judas knew he was wrong Judas knew it wasn't just one day all of a sudden whmo he he he's he's uh incarnated with the Devil the Devil comes and takes him over it didn't happen like that somewhere along the line in Jesus Judas he would have a healing campaign then would go out and he would realize he need a little extra money but they won't miss this little bit off the top and he pulled it out of the bag and he put it in his own pocket amen and he went along or I have a little need or my wife this and and and and it's okay I'll make it up later I I'll I'll I'll I'll return it later I'll do this and and and it maybe it got out of hand and maybe it got worse and maybe it didn't I don't know but at some point he was lusting for more money and the fact that he wished that we could have sold this for 300 p and give to the poor not that he wanted to give to the poor but he wanted part of that money yeah it probably didn't start with outright handfuls of money on it probably started with I need little need I need just a little bit of this and and and I'll make it up or I'll tell him about it later I don't have an opportunity yet and and it goes on somewhere along the line Judas knew he was wrong and he didn't do anything about it he knew he wasn't living true he knew he wasn't being honest he knew he wasn't what that he was projecting to everybody else and guess what he could do steal from Jesus Christ and go heal the sick take money out of the bag and go preach the gospel there's a statement in first Timothy that says they have their conscience seared with a hot iron some point Judas maybe he was under some sort of self-deception that thought well I'm in the ministry and Jesus never said anything to me so I must be okay I haven't been called out during the service nobody's preached against it I was listening to brother Bren on a tape one time or just this week and he was saying some woman came up to brother Brenham and he was really really preaching a hard message in an Evangelistic message and she goes well thank god brother BR you never touched me tonight he said oh good go God bless you Sister and then he asked somebody next to him he says uh who is that that must be a Godly sister and the person next to him said that's the biggest gossip in town brother bman forgot to preach about gossip but she knew what she was and she knew he didn't touch her why did he have to call it out right yeah right there was a woman who come to brother bandam she was going crazy and she kept wanting prayer and want in prayer and he prayed for her one time at a meeting and they prayed at a a Methodist Church in local area and she wasn't getting any better finally she asked one day when you're under the anointing can I come to your house and she stayed in contact with with sister MAA and it worked out she come to the house and she couldn't get free she was nervous and having a nervous breakdown and come to find out that she had failed her husband broke her marriage vow so long ago but never confessed it kept that thing hidden said I confessed it to God and she was a Sunday school teacher teaching Sunday school and her pastor had a good impression of her and she was in church and in service and teaching kids and she was falling apart because somewhere along the line she wasn't honest she wasn't honest she was keeping something hidden Judas was keeping something hidden yes he was he was a thief and he was keeping it hidden brother Braham said the most dangerous the not dangerous he said the fastest place a log rots is when it's in the stream of water talked about going and jumping up on a old beach log it looked like a solid log and he jumped on it was rotten and there had been a little Branch a little bit of water that had been running underneath of it and it was rottening out from inside and and brother Brenham types that to the church you can sit in church and rot faster than anywhere else amen because we're not he says because there was no life in it had fallen and there was no life in it and it had rotten out the woman who washed jesus' feet knew what she was the Pharisee should have been honest in his heart he was critical towards Jesus he was mocking him in his heart and he was had false interior motives for having him there at his house should have been honest this woman was honest but he's in my house but I'm in the church but I'm in the message but I prayed for my wife and she got better I prayed for my husband and he was healed I teach Sunday school I preach I witness to my neighbor and they came to the message but are you a thief are you an adulterer with your eyes looking upon a woman lust after her at some point we got to be honest and not feel like we're okay because I'm in good standing in the church can't keep things hidden all the time and expect that it's going to work out amen I have a problem with tobacco I have a problem with lying I have a problem with stealing but God blesses me and I feel his presence in the church Simon felt his presence in his house his presence was there but it didn't make Simon right no doubt Judas felt something under the anointing of preaching the gospel no doubt he felt something when he laid hands on the sick and they recovered but he was still a thief wasn't just one day a a good boy serving Christ serving the word doing the best he can and all of a sudden WHL he's taken over by the devil doesn't happen like that it happens because something comes in and we don't deal with it we're not honest about it we allow bitterness to grow in our heart and blame everybody else for our bitterness we lie to protect ourselves and we never expose it we do this we do that we do the other but I want to be real from the bottom to the top all I can say is God help us help us Lord this Human Experience is a is is dangerous this Human Experience is horrible amen there's always this self-preservation there's always self- protection there's always want these lust that we're fighting with all the time but God give me more of your spirit to overcome this flesh somewhere along the line Judas conscience was seared with a hot iron yes to where he could see a woman worship Jesus Christ with pure worship with all of her heart with everything she has and he can criticize it because he wanted more money that he was stealing out of the treasury I don't know about you but that's that's a pretty seared conscience right that's a conscience that's really seared and so we find his destination is to be taken over by a devil why it's because he was playing with Devils so he was opening himself to devils and that Spirit he played around with began to sear his conscience to he actually believed everything was going to be okay he got to the point where he believed he could sell out Jesus but Jesus take care of himself and somehow Escape like he's escaped before and I can take the money and move on and everything will be fine sear his conscience that bad that he could believe that he could he could he could do something like that and it would still work out okay our conscience gets seared we don't pay tithe well because we're having a little bit of a hard time at home right now we don't give an offer and we make more excuses more excus and then it's been a year 2 years 3 years we haven't done the most basic and simplest of things but we feel excused about it because by the way I still feel good in service and I still feel the presence of the Lord and when I sing I still God help us not to have a conscience so seared that we can violate the word of God Monday through Saturday and come in in Sunday raise our hands in worship and feel something and think we're okay amen have a heart that criticizes everybody have bitterness in my heart have hate and contempt towards somebody have a lie I told about somebody else have something I'm taking that's not right be corrupt in some way at work be seeing doing talking about things I ought not and come to church and it's okay because I still feel the presence of the Lord listen he comes where he's invited amen I'm sorry that this is heavy I just don't know why I can't help it friends it's not my intention and not what I intended to preach let's go to Second Timothy 4 second Timothy chapter 4 verse 9 2 Timothy 4:9 do thy diligence to come shortly unto me for demoth has forsaken me having loved this present world and has departed into thessalonica Deus has forsaken me having loved this present world brother bam starts to talk about this in present stage of my Ministry and he says see the time comes friend and I want people in the land that tapes to go out to remember that the separating time has to come it must do it I don't know how far I am from the end time my end of the road I don't know that's up to God I don't know what tomorrow is I don't know what it holds but I know who's holding it so that's where my faith is built on now I imagine Deus didn't forsake Him and start off into nightclubs I don't imagine Deus did that cuz Deus was a Spirit-filled man he was a great helper if you ever took the history of deus he was a notable preacher a fine culture man a highly polished educated he was a smart man but why would he forsake Paul that's the thing what made him do it forsake Paul I don't believe he wanted to go to the nightclub or anything but I believe it was God separating Paul further on he says and why would he turn his back on such a person as that and be had been Vindicated that he was a servant of Christ do you notice Paul here loving this present world I don't think Deus backslid further now says Deus loving this present World popularity of men hello Dr Deus further D says Deus said I ain't associating with this guy like that he's a low class of a person I'll go up with the denomination on bre I'll go up where I'll be somebody Deus left Paul because he saw Paul Ministry diminishing he saw it going down and now Paul only had one coat and Paul had left a friend sick in another city and and brother R goes into all of this in present stage of my Ministry and Paul gets chased out of the city by the copper Smith in one place and it looks like Paul's all washed up he's he's a fugitive he's on the Run he doesn't have any more power like he used he used to Smite blind he used to cast out Devils but he left his buddy sick he's only got one code and he he couldn't just stand in the face I was in but he got chased out of the city by the copper Smith and Deus somehow got to the place in his own pride and his own arrogance and his own desire for popularity that Deus would be willing to forsake Paul the messenger of the hour and walk away from Paul and stop helping him and supporting him and turn his back on Paul and feel totally justified because because of course you know Paul's failing now amen and Paul there's something there's something wrong with Paul so I'm turning my back on Paul and the justification is there's something wrong with Paul obviously God's not blessing his ministry like it used to so something's wrong with Paul but the reality is the problem was inside Deus yeah right the promise wasn't inside Paul the problem was inside Deus Deus want to know variety Deus wanted popularity Deus didn't want to go to a nightclub to a bar he didn't want to start drinking he didn't want to start smoking he stayed in church he went to the denominations he wanted to be somebody that was the problem with Deus and he was willing to reject Paul and walk away from Paul because he wasn't being honest with himself said God help me to be honest with myself stop making excuses for myself stop passing over infractions stop saying it's because of this happened or because I have this tendency and I have a temper because my mom you know that may be true you may have you may have inherited a temper from your mom but that's no excuse to let it lay there expose that thing talk about it pray about it push against it fight again don't don't don't just say it's my mom I got this because of my mom right so it's your mom's fault you just to off everybody in the room right it's mom's fault you just spoke that way to your husband or to your children that that was mom's fault no that's your fault sometimes we got to be honest I spoke with a brother one time I was speaking with talking to a ministering brother and he told me when he was a young man he was struggling with lust and he couldn't get over it and and how he had been to the altar he had been to the prayer line he had prayed he had he had read his Bible he had listened to the message he had talked to God he wanted to be free and he couldn't break free and he told me where his freedom came said I was sitting outside a brother's house and I confessed my faults to him I humbled myself and exposed where sin was hiding in my life and he said I had prayed and I went to The Altar and I went to meetings and I went to this but my Deliverance came on a porch when I told my brother what I was going through and he prayed with me and I've been free ever since God or we could say it must be okay cuz he's still blessing me I I I'll get better later I'll just better be careful that we don't leave those things lay yes because Judas left it lay Deus left it lay won leave those things lay but expose those things say listen I I'm ashamed of this but I'm having trouble with this now I don't suggest you write it down for the whole church to read I [Music] mean but don't stuff it don't hide it don't act like it's okay and don't don't know in your heart you're wrong amen and wait for well if if it's wrong the preacher will say something about it you already know it's wrong why do you need the preacher to say something about it you've got a seat of God on the inside and if you've got the Holy Ghost you've got the teacher that'll teach the word to you when that woman said brother brandham you didn't touch me tonight amen where was the holy ghost in her that would take the word and find the application in her life because the teacher should be in you not just in the pull pit that'll say well he didn't say exactly this he do need to say exactly this amen there's a teacher inside of you that'll say I'm guilty he didn't say my name and he didn't say the exact circumstance but all of a sudden I have a witness that I need to make that thing right I need to get rid of this I need to expose this in my life amen man the danger is if we don't and we have another service next week and it's a good service and you're blessed somebody asked you to pray for them and you pray for them and they get healed that's dangerous friends that's scary I don't want to be in that spot say God help me I don't want to be like Demus I don't want to wind up like Demus I don't want to wind up like Judas I want to be like the little woman she knew what she was but she had to give it all to him anyways and he blessed her and changed her life Judas couldn't give up or Deus I'm saying couldn't give up popularity Deus couldn't give up Prestige and and deus's the problem with Deus was was not Paul losing his ministry and not Paul failing in his ministry the problem with Deus is deus's pride he couldn't suffer himself as long as the meetings were good and as long as they were casting out devils and as long as Paul was popular Deus was there so the problem wasn't Paul the problem was with Deus and Deus had to go to preserve deus's reputation so they could Preserve deus's uh promotion but I want to look at the attitude of Paul now if we can go to Acts chapter 21 together Acts chapter 21 Acts 21:10 and as we Terri there many days there come down from Judea a certain Prophet named agabus and when he was come unto us he took Paul's girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said thus sayith the Holy Ghost so shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that onth this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of Gentiles and when we heard these things this is uh Luke is writing the this book of Acts when we heard these things Luke and the other Brethren both we and they of that place sought him not to go up to Jerusalem then Paul answered what mean ye to weep and to break Mine Heart for I'm ready to go I am ready not to be bound only but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus I love this because I to me I see the way God works it it starts to stand out to me that agabus a prophet comes down and he begins to prophesy that there's Terrible Things heading for you uh uh Paul there's some danger coming your way and and and he gives the prophecy of it and then and then now uh everybody that's there everybody that's where they're visiting and everybody that's traveling with Paul all Paul's Close Associates and all the church he's visiting they all agreed together don't go to Jerusalem and just think of the temptation of this it wasn't it wasn't that somebody just said don't go to Jerusalem there was a holy ghost operated gift that come and said if you go to Jerusalem this danger is fallowing you the Holy Ghost spoke through agabus and demonstrated was trouble then all the Holy Ghost filled Brethren are saying now don't go to Jerusalem but there's Paul who's also a holy ghost filled Brethren that say why do you make me weep and why do you break my heart with your weeping I'm ready to give my life I'm ready to die I'm ready to give everything up yeah amen amen let's look at another scripture here um where's this other one uh verse 22 yeah let's go down to verse 22 what is it therefore the multitude must needs come together for they will hear that thou art come do therefore this that well where am I at what in the world am I doing I'm in the wrong chapter chapter 20 verse 22 chapter 20 verse 22 and now behold I go Bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem what was moving Paul it was the spirit of God moving him to Jerusalem he said I go Bound in the spirit he knew what God was leading him to do he knew what God was asking of him I go Bound in the spirit into Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall Beil befall me there save that the Holy Ghost witnessed in every city saying bonds and affliction abide me but none of these things move me neither count I my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the Ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of Jesus read verse uh grace of God verse 25 and now and now behold I know that you all I I know that you all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more this is what he says in chapter 20 chapter 21 agabus comes and confirms everything yet in another city and he says the Holy Ghost spoke in every city that bonds and affliction abide me there and he says but but that doesn't move me none of these things move me none of these things change me CU I'm Bound in spirit amen and and you think this is this is the thing that just amazes me you think God moved an inspiration upon Paul's heart and Paul is now willing to give up everything and go to Jerusalem and he's Bound in the spirit to head to Jerusalem amen but God allows gifts to operate in the church that would begin to tell Paul hey if you go to Jerusalem back bad things are going to happen to you then he goes to another city if you go to Jerusalem bad things are going to happen to you and he's not telling anybody what's in his heart amen God had spoke to him but everywhere he goes the Holy Ghost speaking through the gifts in the church says Paul if you go to Jerusalem bad things are going to happen to you next city Paul if you go to Jerusalem bad things are going to happen to you the next city Paul if you go to Jerusalem bad things are going to happen to you and now they come to this city and agabus stands up takes his girdle binds his hands and said so will it be to the man that owns this girdle amen when he goes to Jerusalem and now all everybody in that church and everybody traveling including Luke amen starts to say don't go Paul don't go I look at this and I say why does God do this what if that was you people under discernment that don't know people begin to prophesy and say if you go amen God loves loves to test his children God knows what he put inside God's willing to pour concrete himself on top of it I don't know about you but if that was me I start thinking well maybe I shouldn't go to Jerusalem I mean maybe God's trying to speak to me and then all the people you trust start to persuade you may Paul don't don't do it Paul Hey listen you got a minist no who knows what kind of uh uh excuses they gave or what kind of persuasion they use Paul listen you still got your ministry that not everybody's heard the gospel yet they're still Gentile remember that invitation from that church surely God doesn't want to take you off the scene now Paul said I already know in my heart I'm Bound in the spirit to Jerusalem in fact none of these things move me cuz I count not my life dear to myself because I broke the alabaster box long ago and I poured it out I'm not here to save myself it was the Holy Ghost that led him to Jerusalem and it was the Holy Ghost that kept warning him about Jerusalem what's God trying to do I think God's allowing the life in Paul to shine forth amen it's amazing how different things are the way we think they should be yeah I wouldn't have done it that way I would have used the Holy Ghost gifts and I would have used the prophet to say this is what's going to happen Paul but that's okay you go on ahead I'm with you but nobody said that right nobody said that they just said you're going to be in trouble and then that's what the spirit said you're going to be in trouble then everybody else tried to persuade him not to go you want to talk about a Temptation what if that was you man is he going to follow the leading of the Lord or is he going but yet what about all the Brethren do they not have the leading of the Lord what about every church that confesses the same thing isn't this the mouth of two or three Witnesses you talking about mind battles friend this is where you get mind battles but we have to serve God from a pure heart Paul if Paul wanted to save himself he had all the justification in the world he needed right there I mean I could imagine if you had a little bit of self-preservation still buried in there and and you had a little bit of Pride that thought you still God couldn't take you because he still needs me to preach God doesn't need us to do nothing God doesn't need me to pastor this church he can get anybody else to do it he doesn't need me to preach the gospel there there's droves of people that can preach the gospel and he can supply a super duper anointing to the smallest of smallest and make him the best preacher in the world he doesn't need me he doesn't need your pretty voice to sing a song understand if Paul start think well he still needs me I can't go yet what do you mean he still needs you right when God was done with Peter Peter died on a cross yeah Peter couldn't say well you still need me I have the keys this is where we get in trouble thinking he still needs me I can do I there's nobody there's nobody that can do this the way I can do it well you know what that's true for Peter nobody could do it like he could do it and for Paul nobody could do it like he could do it and the same thing for brother Bram there ain't a soul who could do it like he could do it but God took him out in a car wreck on his way for Christmas back in Jeffersonville and he wanted to preach a message called trail of certain couldn't wait to get home to preach it and God would take him like that you know how many people thought that because God took him that way that that God was done done with his ministry and it was a Vindication that he was getting off was Peter getting off was Paul getting off if Peter if Paul wanted to save himself the Holy Ghost gave him all the chances he needed so it is God who will give a holy ghost Ministry to false Brethren and let them preach the gospel tell the truth lay hands on the sick have discernment and and and sell out Jesus Christ to the Romans God chose him and he was given to Jesus of the father then the same God who who tells Paul to go to Jerusalem the same God will say we warn him in every city you know if you go to Jerusalem it's going to be bad you know if he's going to go to Jerusalem and then all the Brethren that love him try to get him not to go to Jerusalem I tell you we don't think God will act this way God will act exactly this way because he has no fear about the life that's on the inside of the sea he knows that's his own life and it'll manifest the word amen if it doesn't do it day one it'll do it it's going to manifest the word he also knows that everything's that's not the SE seed has to Fall Away has to let's look at Acts chapter 20 while we're here and I want to look at verse 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock he had just told them that I'm not going to see your face anymore I want you to understand the context of this take heed therefore yourselves into all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers now I stop right there quit reading look he's speaking to his fellow ministers that he's worked with some of them he's ordained no doubt and put them in position as Elders he's traveled from City to City preaching in their churches having meetings Fellowship many of them gathered together at Ephesus to talk to him and and he says you're the ones the Holy Ghost has made overseers of the flock but look what he says next to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them Paul just said to every one of them you're the overseers the Holy Ghost has played over the to feed the flock the Holy Ghost has put each one of you in position but I know that among some of you are going to raise up false Brethren with wrong motives to lead away some of the flock if I had been sitting there that day I don't know what I would have thought have probably been in shock these are Paul's friends the ministers he worked with the ones maybe he put in position or recommended if I were there I'd be like Paul tell me which ones so that I can be careful you know what Paul didn't do he didn't tell them which ones yeah he just told them they were there and it was going to happen y but that can't happen in the message this was the message Paul knew it was going to happen he prophesied it was going to happen Paul knew they were there Paul can't you tell us warn us don't leave us like this Paul how can you leave us like this how can you say something like that and not tell us who how can you say that and walk away and leave us maybe Paul had more faith in God than we do maybe Paul had more faith in the C Gene of God and the power of the word of God to bring the sea to life than many of us do cuz we think we've got to make it easy we don't have to make easy amen we think that we got a baby and pet and we don't God never has right he never did the seed comes through and God knows how to bring the seed through the shepherd wouldn't lead his sheep through danger oh yes he does he just doesn't leave them he leads them right into the valley of The Shadow of death but he doesn't leave them God wouldn't take us through separation he wouldn't take us through that he wouldn't let that happen to my house he wouldn't let that happen to my home he wouldn't let that happen in my church are you sure well it would be obvious he would explain it yeah somewhere among you false brother is going to rise up and by the way I got to go and you're never going to see me again Jesus turns to the 12 and one of you is a devil everything will manifest itself don't have to figure it out you don't have to know ahead of time God knows how to create the circumstance where every seed begins to manifest what's inside that seed let's turn to the book of Jude honestly friends I have no idea why I'm preaching these things but I'm going to keep preaching them Jude chapter 1 Jude 1:3 beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this combination where did they creep in into the church and they were ordained to do so ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ verse eight likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities Yet Michael the Archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses D not bring him bring against him a railing accusation but said the Lord rebuke thee but these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beast and those things they corrupt themselves woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain they ran greedily after the heir of balam for reward and perished in the gain sayings of core these are spots in your Feast of Charity when they Feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water carried about with the winds trees whose fruit withereth without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots Raging Waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the Blackness of Darkness forever when he reads through the description of these brothers they sound horrible do you agree they sound horrible where are these brothers in the church where are they they're in your love Feast they're in your meetings yeah they're taking communion with you y having their conscience seared they can violate the word of God and stand and take communion they can raise their hands and sing songs and and know that that know know absolutely that we weren't taught to do it this way brother B said something different but I've got my own idea about it but I'll stand here and worship and feel good I'll come down and take communion I know I've got a hidden sin in my life that I haven't exposed I just whispered a prayer to God and said God please forgive me of that but I never exposed it to the one I sinned against I never made it right conscience seared yes with a hot iron these things this list when I when I I I've read this so many times I've read this the majority of my life I've known the scripture was here and read through it multiple times in my lifetime but it then began to strike me that he's not talking about horrible people that are attacking the church he's talking about horrible people that are in the church partaking of the events in the church uh worshiping with the church involved in the things of the church surely God would not do that and you realize this is the very justification people have for not going to church there's Hypocrites in the church there's false Believers there's people who do this and they say one thing they do something else and that's their justification for not being in the church I don't see where Paul makes it a justification or Jude in fact the question is should we expect it to go away should we expect it to not be among us should we expect there then be no more false Brethren is that what we should expect well I don't know maybe we should look closer with the scriptures if Jesus had it in his church and Paul had it in his church and brother brandham had it in his church we've come to such a level in our spiritual discernment and our ability to know everything that it's not going to be in our church question is how do I card against it all I know is to be honest not hide I'm not going to hide anything say God help me not to hide help me not to just gloss over help me not to sweep under the rug because I don't want my conscience seared I don't want I don't want backbiting and bitterness and hatred and I don't want these sins the foxes that spoil the vine the things I look at and the places I go the things I do in secret I don't want those things to sear my conscience where I can go on Saturday and do something and come on Sunday and say praise the Lord and feel a presence and feel like I'm okay cuz I felt a presence God help us not to go down that path that's a dangerous path to go down friends but we've got to be real with what's going on inside of our heart and say God I failed you I failed you you got to help me I can't go on I don't want to be like this I'm not going to be a hypocrite amen I may be the biggest fool in the church I may expose myself over and over but I'm not going to be a hypocrite amen I I want to get to the place where I can do all the Christian things but in my heart's in turmoil and every time an evangelist comes over and he starts going down the line and nailing these things and then and these things and when he skips over the thing I'm dealing with all of a sudden I feel a little bit of relief where I was all tensed up amen don't feel relief amen get relief at the altar get relief at exposing your sin get relief not because it wasn't mentioned and it wasn't preached again find relief in Repentance find relief in exposing your sin find relief in opening the door and giving the devil no Hiding Place not being grateful he didn't touch that or he didn't touch this or he didn't get hard on [Music] that God help us to be real genuine help us to tell the truth to God and to ourselves Judas knew knew he stole from Jesus and he kept in the ministry Deus knew he couldn't go along with Paul because it was costing him too much so he made it Paul's fault not the wickedness of his own pride of his heart God help us not to hide sin Jesus says to the Pharisees in Matthew 23 he says woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites if you are like unto Whited sepers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness even so you also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity there's a couple examples and stories that are through the Bible through the message I'm just going to reference them as we wind down in Mark 12 Jesus begins to show his disciples an example and the example is the widow woman who gives two mites into the treasury she's contrasted by the Pharisee who blows a trumpet and draws attention and has pump and ceremony and goes in and he has a lot of money and he and he goes and he takes a lot of money and he and he drops it in the treasury and no doubt you know what he probably doesn't do is he probably doesn't take the bag and set it down in quietly he probably like shakes it so all the coins start rattling so you can hear how much is falling in that man was not giving to God that man was giving to himself to build or preserve his reputation in front of the people he can say well I gave that money to God and technically he gave the money to God cuz it's no longer in his pocket but he gave it in a way that he would get something in return and that was the look good in the eyes of the people but his heart was corrupt it was Pride on the inside that caused him to do it that way then we had a little widow woman who all she had was two mites and she didn't blow a trumpet there was no Fanfare I don't know how many people noticed or didn't notice but she slid in and she dropped those two minds probably silently into the treasury but Jesus noticed and Jesus Drew attention to it and Jesus says this woman gave more than everyone else who put in the offering plate today you know why because she gave all she had it didn't matter the quantity it wasn't the quantity it was the ratio yeah I don't know how much that Pharisee that might have been 10% of his monthly earnings maybe a little more maybe he gave 20 it's probably a large sum of money but in proportion it wasn't a tremendous sacrifice but this little woman when she gave that money she didn't give that money for herself she gave it to God no Fanfare no recognition nobody noticed and she didn't get praise accolades or even respect because of what she did but Jesus noticed so he begins the contrast and show us the contrast between a pure heart and a Pharisees heart the pure heart was willing to give all she had Simon would have Jesus to him house Simon would even feed him good food but it was The Prostitute who gave everything yes Judas would give his time and his money he would give give up whatever it was that he was doing to go into the ministry at the end of the day he wouldn't give all he set kept something back for for himself brother bham says in the message leadership he said but I remember a little story I want you to know one day there was a widow woman she had a bunch of children perhaps them little children's Papa was gone and she only had two pennies and she come down the street and was tithing money just pennies like you all saved and threw it into the treasury of God Jesus was standing there watching her and I wondered what would I have done if I had been standing there I'd probably run up and said no sister no don't do that we don't really we really don't need it you need it for them children now I wouldn't have let her I wouldn't have let her done it but Jesus let her do it see he let her do it why he knows it's more blessed to give than it is to receive he knowed what he would do for her see I wouldn't let people I wouldn't let people get stuck in a church with false Ministry and I wouldn't let them get mistreated by ministers I wouldn't let them get abused by parents I wouldn't let anybody do that I wouldn't let false Brethren take people in the message of wrong I wouldn't do that if I was in charge because I don't want them to suffer I don't want them I don't want him to lose out I don't want him to hurt just like Jesus wouldn't let the little woman give all her money cuz he didn't want those children to suffer he didn't want her to hurt but Jesus let her do it because he knew what he would do for her in return Jesus lets us go through some things some hard things some terrible things but he knows what he's going to do in return he knows what it's going to mean at the end of the road he knows what the reward is and he's looking for the heart that loves him more than anything else brother M said oh we who give one little prayer a day 10 cents oh goodness this is a rare and special occasion when we meet Jesus he just don't want you to be a member of a church he wants the best you got he wants you not lip service not religious Duty he just wants all of you amen he gave us all of him so he can have all of us brother bam starts talking about sister Hatty right and he says what would she have asked what would she asked for the healing of her sister what if she had asked the little girl would have been healed but her two boys lost what if that poor Widow who had just told me that she tried to give to this church $50 on a pledge to help build a new church and brother Roberson wouldn't take it would only let her give 20 of it here's this woman brother man begins to talk talk about she barely made she only made I think a couple hundred dollar a year in income she was a widow she was scratching out a living on an old hillside farm anden she was in poverty and only had a little bit of money and she had made a pledge Amen to brother Roberson in the church that she was going to give $50 to the building of the new church but brother Roberson wouldn't let her do it so he told her only 20 and she had given the 20 and brother brandham had a 20 and he was going to give her $20 back that's what is in his mind and that was what his intention to not let her sacrifice and not let her give because she can't do it others can give but she can't she can't give all she can't she can't suffer we can't let her suffer see that's how we think that's how the prophet was thinking that's not that's not that you know that's not abnormal that's what the prophet was thinking yes but God was thinking different he said then he said I said to myself when she's speaking I will give her back the 20 but God said to me in my heart now not by Vision in my heart when Jesus was standing watching the Widow put the three pennies there there was thousands of dollars laying what would you have done I said well if I'd been standing around I said we don't need it sister we got plenty of money but Jesus never said it he let her go on and do it because he know that was down the road so help me God is my solemn judge God knew that what God knew that was down the road for her what was down the road for Hatty rright the salvation of her two boys God is never unfair unloving unjust in any way whatsoever in human perspective we see the events in people's lives and we see how could God let them lose a child how could God let her be a young Widow how could God we just don't see like God sees how could we take $20 from poor Hatty Wright for the building of the church we got we got plenty of people that'll donate I we can't let this happen God was willing to take it yeah God was happy to take it yeah that's why God doesn't ask me I would never let you be sick if he asked me I would never let your husband or your wife die I would never let your child go go Wayward I would never let any of that happen because I couldn't stand to see you suffer but God's got a broader Vision than we have he sees more than we see and everything he does is perfect perfect perfect perfect he says and I had and after he's thinking this God knew that was down the road for her and I had run my hand in my pocket to get my pocketbook to get her $20 back and say sister Hattie but he said don't do it brother B already had his money on his wallet or his hand on his wallet but he said don't do it then in a few minutes when the question was brought up about Jehovah D she said that's nothing but the truth and it come from a poor widow's heart God knowing she had asked the greatest thing could be done and brother bam said the angel of the Lord said stand to your feet give her whatever she asked for listen you may think you've suffered but your suffering is nothing compared to the Glorious reward that lays ahead you may think it was unfair and not right and shouldn't happened to this church shouldn't happened to the message shouldn't happened in my family amen when you get on that side you're never going to say it shouldn't have happened you'll not one time say it was too much I had to give too much I had to do too much I had to sacrifice too much that'll never be language that comes out of our mouth when we get out of these bodies and out of this Consciousness and we can see clearly from the other side we'll say I didn't give enough I should have given more I'm sorry I complained I I feel bad that I doubted God I'm so ashamed of myself that I didn't understand that he's perfect in every way and all of these things are working together for his glory and my good nobody's going to say Lord it was too much you asked of me Jesus who let the woman put all her living in the treasury is the same Jesus who Let The Prostitute give everything she had saved for to save her life and spill it all on his feet and on the ground in a moment her life was gone Jesus let that happen it was also Jesus who let Judas steal and knew it was going on and didn't say a word about it see he'll let us do what we want to do to show what we are sometimes we deceive ourselves and thinking well if it's wrong then something bad will happen or because we don't say it that way but we we begin to justify our mind because judgment hasn't come and something bad hasn't happened then it must be okay but just because God lets you do what's in your heart doesn't mean that what you're doing is right and just because he doesn't call it out from the pull pit or somebody didn't have a dream or somebody pre doesn't preach on your exact issue doesn't mean that it's okay and just because everything in life goes wrong doesn't mean we're wrong just because God's requiring not even requiring he's giving me the opportunity to give more than anybody else gives doesn't mean it's wrong and others may tell me sister you don't have to give that much brother you don't have to God doesn't expect you you don't have to do that you don't have to go through that you don't have to endure that you don't have to just because everyone around me reassured me that God loves me and he doesn't want me to suffer and I don't have to go through this amen something in my heart says this is what I want to give to him in return for service I want to give my all not just a partial I want to give my all amen oh my goodness remember we talked about Rebecca and watering the camels she didn't have to too but she did and what she did was a Monumental task what she did was above and beyond what she did was more than I would have ever asked a maiden to do for me but remember Eleazar didn't ask her she volunteered she didn't have to Jesus never asked the woman with the alabaster box to spill on his feet she didn't have to Jesus never had asked the woman with two mites to put an offering she didn't have to Jesus never asked had he right to to pledge $50 she wanted to he never asked her to give the 20 she wanted to he'll take it the the the Rebecca who watered the camels she's trip after trip after trip after trip and Eleazar just lets her do it he just lets her do it why because she's expressing what's inside of her when she does another trip she's expressing when she does another trip she's expressing when she bears under the load when she keeps her word when she serves others amen she's expressing what she is and he just sits back and waits to see whether his journey is prosperous or not not saying okay sister that's enough you showed me enough that's okay I can see you're working up a sweat and you're a little bit out of breath I feel bad now no he let her do another 50 trips or however to express what was in her heart and when all the camels had done drinking then he rushed to her and gave her the gifts the the bracelets and the earring she didn't have to she wanted to the effort wasn't small it was great and he let her do it amen we talked about last time the drink of water David longed for and the three Mighty Men Who went and got it they didn't have to nobody asked them to nobody asked them nobody even suggested it they just knew David wanted it and if David their lord wanted it then that was in their heart to go give it and they were willing to sacrifice their lives and when they brought back the cup David said I I read to you out of 2 Samuel but when you read out of Chronicles it's even more striking he said can I drink the cup that is the blood yes of these men what was it what did they give David they gave David their lives they gave David their blood that's what he said you've this cup is their blood I can't drink this it's too sacred it's too holy because they gave their life to give me what I wanted amen showing that there's going to be some Mighty Warriors on this Earth that'll give their life just for what he wants not what I have to do see listen it's no more about getting to Heaven amen if all you want to do is go to heaven that's okay I mean God will take care of that and you could have a reward I want more than to go to heaven I want a love my maker I want to give him all I want to pour out the alabaster box I want to drop my two mites give my $20 water all his camels whatever it is that brings pleasure to him that's what's in my heart that I desperately want to [Music] do it's not about being in the message you can be in the message and go to hell question is whether you are the message you can be a part of anything you want sit in a good church and dress right and have a nice family and and thank God for all the blessings and they true blessings and God blessed you you can feel the Holy Ghost anointing your life and it can be a true Holy Ghost anoint and you can thank God that there's gifts operating in your life and it can all be true but the question is not what has God done for you the question is have I given everything or if I'm still holding secret things in my heart Jesus said in Luke 17:10 so likewise ye when you shall have done all these things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do remember a long time ago brother Bob Brooks pach a message on this and I can never forget it brother Bob when you've done everything that was commanded you to do you're yet an unprofitable servant cuz you only did what you had to do that's what Jesus is saying I don't want to do what I have to do I want to do what he wants remember when the Rich Young Ruler came to Jesus he asks Rabbi what must I do to inherit eternal life and he begins to tell him keep the Commandments and do these things he said I've done it all for my youth I've done what was required of me Jesus said if you want life Everlasting there's one thing you're lacking sell everything you have take up your cross follow me that man went away sad because he had great possessions question is what did he really want most he could make whatever Choice he wanted what he chose is what he wanted the most and that was his possessions he wanted his possessions and eternal life I I pray God helps me not to have my way and eternal life my wants and eternal life I just want eternal life because eternal life is a person it's Jesus Christ I want him Luke 19 let's turn there I'm going to wrap up with this thought Luke 19 Jesus gives the Rich Young Ruler an opportunity and the Rich Young Ruler walks away but then Jesus comes to zaki's house Luke 19 and5 and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zakus make haste and come down for today I must abide at thy house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully when they saw it they all murmured saying what that he was gone to be guessed with a man that is a sinner and zakus stood and said unto the Lord behold Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor if I've taken anything from any man by false accusation I restore him fourfold and Jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house for as much as he also is a son of Abraham zakus didn't become a son of Abraham zakus was a son of Abraham when Jesus Come into his house you know Jesus never said zakus you know you stole from people zakus you haven't be exactly honest zakus you probably should make it right Jesus never said anything about it but when zakus had Jesus in his house it wasn't like when Jesus went to Simon's house because this was a son of Abraham yeah and when Jesus comes to the house of a son of Abraham zakus of his own account with no persuasion with nobody commanding him he stands up and said Lord I've been wrong and I'm going to make it it all right and I'm not just going to give back what I took I'm going to restore it fourfold amen if I've taken any if I've been dishonest I'm going to do all this and Jesus said salvation this come to this house this day not because he gave the money back amen but because he testified of what was inside of him by his willingness to repent with no coion Jesus didn't have to sit and through discernment start exposing the other night you did this and remember that little deal you and remember remember this time and remember that time and I can see the receipt right now in a in a vision zakus did not need that level of discernment for him to discern himself when he got in the presence of the Lord he discerned himself he knew what he was and he was honest about it and he didn't give what he had to give he gave what he wanted to give all of a sudden zachus didn't re make retribution so that he could be a son of Abraham he stood up to make that retribution because he was a son of Abraham am hady Wright never gave 20 bucks to get salvation for her two boys she gave it because she wanted to yeah right my goodness my goodness I want to I want to just as I close I just want to share about the life of Peter the life of Peter is one that really resonates with me because Peter loved Jesus but Peter also loved Peter Peter was conflicted on the inside because Peter I genuinely believe Peter loved the Lord I believe it with all my heart but Peter couldn't get over himself when when Jesus told him that I we have to go to Jerusalem and I've got to be crucified and and mistreated and crucified and he says far be it from thee for a thing like that to happen and Jesus turns around and rebukes him saying get behind me Satan for thou carest about the things that be of man and not the things that be of God and it looked like that that Jesus rebuked Peter that Peter would change his mind the problem is Peter never changed his mind Peter still thought that Jesus doesn't need to be crucified and he manifest that fa Faith because when they come to arrest Jesus amen he takes out a sword and he tries to kill and tries to fight to defend Jesus showing that he never changed his mind about what he confessed long ago and though he rebuked from the Lord he may have went quiet on the surface but in his heart he still didn't believe that Jesus needed to die and because he never exposed that and he never repented and he never made it right when it come down to the end of the road you find him still fighting for what he believes is right even though he was already told he was wrong God help us Peter is one of those who were fussing and arguing about who's going to be the greatest in the Kingdom or who was the greatest among the disciples and and he he's getting caught up in all of this stuff because Peter Peter's in turmoil he loves the Lord but Peter Still Loves self so all of these things happen in Peter's life and he's part of the ministry he loves the Lord but yet he's rebuked by the Lord he he tries to murder a man and cuts his ear off and then he goes to the to the the trial and in the trial he begins to deny that he knows Jesus the one who just boldly proclaimed just a short time before that the th though I'll go to prison I'll go to death but I'll never forsake you now he's asked he's questioned by a maiden are you one of them no I'm not one of them and the final time he begins to swear he begins to curse immediately the crows and he knows what he did and the scripture says Peter went out and wept bitterly wept bitterly you know those circumstances were hard the whole the whole sequence of events was so hard for people Peter to deal with emotionally great campaign Peter drops his Nets and walks away from his business to serve in this ministry he leaves his home and his family for long periods of time to go join this ministry everything's going right and then all of a sudden it begins to go wrong Jesus says some confusing things and people walk away there's now criticism and and now the whole political scene is building there's tension all around and Peter as a human being is stuck in the middle of this he loves the Lord but yet he can't get over himself says the wrong thing rebuked of the lord caught in all kinds of stuff and finally it comes down to where now there's soldiers Marching In in into the in in into the uh garden and they're going to go take Jesus away and he and he can't take it anymore and he reacts and he tries to listen it looks like he's trying to save the Lord but I believe there's a mixture of trying to save the Lord and trying to save himself to save his position to save the ministry to save all the things that he believed he was heading to they were heading to a millennium this is going to be the king we're going to drive out the Romans we're going to set the kingdom of God on Earth he had all this understanding and now he's not fighting because he loves Jesus he's fighting because he loves his own understanding because of what where it places him and Jesus even told his disciples he said if you L me you would be happy because I said I go to my father they were all grieving cuz he said said I had to leave but Jesus said if you actually loved me you would be happy that I'm going away because I go to my father showing that the grieving was for self not for Jesus so Peter goes out and weeps bitterly you know before that Jesus says Peter Satan has asked that I SI that you be sifted like wheat I've said this before but to me it have been an easy answer be like yeah Jesus tell him no he's asking you he's asking permission says Satan has asked to sift you like wheat well tell him no tell reassure me tell me it's not going to happen all Jesus says is but I've prayed for you that your faith fail not amen really Jesus would give the devil permission to sift Peter like wheat but he said I've prayed for you that your faith fail not you know one of the most loving things that Jesus ever did for Peter was make Peter face himself let Peter's thinking lead him astray let his own desires send him down the wrong path until he's willing to kill for what he believes in to where he'll deny the Lord Jesus and run out and weep bitterly you know that weeping bitterly was the best thing that ever happened to Peter we look back sometimes friends and we mourn over our failures where we failed God and it still causes us grief but you know when we have to fail and be honest with ourselves and reckon what we really were without him and what we were going and doing and what we were thinking and where we were and we have to be honest about it and weep bitterly that's the best thing God ever did for us is force us to face ourselves in what's going on inside Peter would have never got there without that trial he'd have never got there without the sifting he would have never got there without the trouble but when he was there oh he was I don't think Peter was happy with himself anymore I don't think Peter thought well of himself I don't think Peter was happy about his choices I don't I think Peter was having a raw moment of reality but we see the graciousness of God because he also is the son of Abraham and he comes to him and gives him opportunity of repentance Jesus comes to him he doesn't wait for Peter to find him he comes to Jesus comes to Peter to bring him repentance because Peter needed to see what Peter was so that Peter can be transformed into what God wants Peter to be he had to face the reality of his own failure amen and then God begins to restore him amen and he he goes up to the upper room and then God comes and fills him with power amen and now he can go off and live a life L like he's lived before but now under the power of God under sacrificing himself and surrender we see a Peter after completely unlike the Peter was before when he was born again by the spirit of God he denied himself he took credit for nothing and even wanted to be crucified upside down because he wasn't even worthy to be crucified in a manner like the Lord when he healed the lame man amen by his prayer he said why look at us as though by our strength this man walth we haven't done anything it was the name of the Lord Jesus that did it Peter was a changed man and Peter ended up giving everything Peter thought he gave everything before because he asked Jesus what about us we've gave up homes and we've gave up land and we've gave up wives and we've gave up children Jesus said don't worry there's a reward but it was after his conversion that Peter really starts to give all he he had to be honest with himself and he had to deal with who he really was am let's turn to Psalms 51 Psalms 51 and verse 6 says behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom where does God want truth in the inward Parts not what we display but what we are inside but I love the next verse Purge me with hisp yes and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow what does God want he desireth truth in the inward part in the hidden part he wants me to know wisdom he wants me to be true on the inside and live truth on the inside but you know what I need I need him to wash me inside and out I need him to deal with the parts of me that are still getting in the way I need to send his spirit so that I can overcome the things that I couldn't overcome before I need the spirit of God to live in me I need to be honest I need to face it I need to be genuine I need to be real I need to expose it I I can't hide it anymore but I need God I need him to come down with hisp and make me clean on the inside can't do it by willpower it's already failed I can't do it by My Own Strength that's already failed but I need to come and recognize that I need to be clean I need God to purify my heart I need God to wash me inside and out to where I'm willing to give him all not because I have to and not to go to heaven and not to be accepted in a church but because I want to please him God let that flow from our lives that's our desire is it not friends that's what we want God you want a Pure Heart Lord here's my heart would you wash me with hisp and make me clean I want to share just this one little story from Brother bham as we close in the message life story brother brandham he's he's talking about his wife when he finds his wife and he she had passed on but he called her back from the dead and he's talking to his first wife hope and she begins to tell him some things and she comes to this part said you remember that time when we was in Louisville and you was going on that hunting trip and you wanted to buy that little 22 rifle I said yes he said you didn't have enough $3 to make the down payment I said yes I'm very fond of rifles and things it's just a sport to me and a recreation I and I should say and she said remember that she said honey I've tried my best to save our nickels and things to get it for you she said after I'm gone you go home and right on top of that that little folding bed where brother Ryan slept she said right up on top of there under the newspaper you'll find the money that I saved she said I've cut out I've cut that out of the allowance for my clothes and things that you let me have she said to save it so I could get enough for a down payment to get you that rifle she says she made him promise promise me you'll take that money and go buy that rifle this is a woman on her deathbed looking at her husband begins to tell him brother R tells us that he goes home and right where she said up under the paper and felt those coins there was dimes and nickels laying there that she had saved over weeks and weeks and weeks by cutting out the allowance he had given her for the household items and her clothing she had been sacrificing and cutting corners and doing what she could because she wanted him to have that 22 rifle and brother bam goes on and says ou'll never know how I felt when I looked in there and seen $2.70 and nickles and dimes to buy the rifle I can't imagine how he felt his wife was dead she died and she was gone you know she didn't have to do this he never asked her to he may not have even wanted her to it wasn't his requirement it wasn't even a need it wasn't like he needed medicine or an operation it wasn't a requirement so that he would still treat her like a wife and love her she had no reason that she had to do this she did this because she wanted to I read this and I began to cry in my office and I said God I want to be that kind of wife to you not because I have to dress a certain way not because I have to pay ties not because I soon as a husband and wife starts to get into argument it starts to slip to some foolishness I've always paid the bills around here I wash your clothes who cares about all that where's the love behind it all where's the self-sacrifice where's not doing what you have to do to be considered a good husband or what you have to do to be considered a wife so that you can make everybody else how about being a real husband and sacrificing a real wife and giving everything how about real genuine love from your heart not because you have to but because you want to I read this and just wheeled around in my chair I was looking outside and just crying and say God I've done so many things to be a good Christian I've done so many things to meet the requirement I said done so many things so if people question me I can give them an answer out of the Bible so that I can prove that I'm still a but that's not the kind of wife I want to be to Christ I want to be the kind that doesn't have to cut nickel and dimes out of my allowance I want to be the one that'll lay aside because there's something I knows that's pleasing to him amen that's the kind of wife that I want to be not because I have to but because I want to I I don't want church I want Christ I'm tired of pleasing others in myself I want to please him I know that's what you want that's why you're here but we got to be honest friends about where we are honest about the things we've said honest about the actions we've taken honest about what the true motive is in our heart at the end of the day we can give a religious answer that's fine you can justify it by a quote or an example you can you can justify it by an action somebody else take and this is my you can do all of that you want and you may convince everybody else in the room and that's fine too but isn't there a greater reality than all of that isn't there a reality of what's in your heart not not the excuse for acting the way I no the reality of what's in your heart isn't there a reality of our love for the Lord isn't there a reality of I must give this guy up so that I can serve him can we have the reality of breaking the alabaster box can we have the reality of bringing the cup back to David and that cup is the blood of those men what I want the cup that I give to Jesus not to be 10% I want the cup that I give to Jesus to be my life I want to give him my life let's all stand together I feel so much like apologizing for preaching a heavy message but I can't apologize for this I cannot say I'm sorry because God God wouldn't say he's sorry he wasn't sorry for allowing Peter to be sifted like weed he wasn't sorry for all the trials he wasn't sorry the Widow gave all and The Prostitute gave all he wasn't sorry you know what he's not sorry that we've suffered cuz he knows what's coming ahead I don't want to be sorry that I suffered I want to be grateful that I had an opportunity to prove my love to him I I want to look at my trials differently I want to look at life differently I want to look at my heart differently and I want to worship God out of a pure heart with a pure motive for the right reasons and more than anything I want to break the alabaster box of my life and I want to let it all go out I don't not tip not dip but shatter I want him to have all of me let's bow our head together Lord Jesus what can we say Lord all I know to say is I Love You Lord when you came to Peter after he realized how he failed you denied you swore ran away he came to him and said Peter does thou love us me more than these he said yay Lord I love you more than these asked him three times Lord and he was so grieved on the inside but Lord you were redeeming him back God I don't know what else to say this morning but to say God I love you you know that I love you I love you more than everything else Lord I've failed you many times I'm disappointed in myself even but I love you Lord thou knowest that I love [Music] you God I need a fresh outpouring of your Holy Ghost I need that perfect love to flow down into My Heart Lord to give life to this love that's in my heart I want to give you my all I want to give you my best I want to surrender all to you I pray God that you would take my life as a sacrifice may it be a sweet Savor unto you Lord Jesus as I've preached the word this morning I've done Lord the best that I know how to do but I know Lord you have a purpose in it all and I pray that you go to hearts and lives Lord if there's anybody been accepting hypocrisy would you help them to root it out now Lord there's anybody that's been pretending or hiding or operating with wrong motives and wrong reasonings or there's anybody that's been resenting Lord their trial been harboring bitterness contempt anger they've been critical Lord I pray you go there right now and pour the bomb of Gilead in and BR healing may they fess up Lord may they be h honest may they be real not to make excuses or put a religious front on Lord maybe may they not search the catalog of their mind to find a quote that excuses the activity but they may just be honest right now Lord raw and real say Lord I know that's just me I'm sorry God would you bring healing Lord like you did to Peter would you restore us Lord we truly love you God I don't want to be the Rich Young Ruler I want to be zakus I don't want to be the Pharisee at the treasury I want to be the Widow with two mites I don't want to be Simon in the house Lord but I want to be the prostitute who pours out her life oh I don't want to be in the company of Mighty Men in David's cave but I want to be of the three Lord that ran to get you a drink but sometimes I don't know how overcome myself but Lord I'm laying myself at the altar and asking that you would help me Lord by the power of your Holy Spirit by a fresh anointing Lord would you come and give me the strength to Rise Above This flesh and give you what's in my heart to give you God help this seed in me to grow around the concrete help it push through the muck Lord help the life that's inside come out for I know it's there Lord I feel it pulsating in my heart I want more than anything to be a genuine real believer that gives you the best help me God I pray Lord help your people Lord God I pray that you would just begin to purge do a work of purging in our hearts in our lives expose Lord the sins Lord maybe a preacher didn't say it maybe it hasn't come out in the service but God you be the teacher that's in the heart and you bring to light those hidden places that are causing us problems I pray you give us a repentant heart a repentant attitude the desire to be real lord we love you I ask for these things Lord your precious Name Lord may you help us watch over us as we go our way in the ministry that's coming next week
