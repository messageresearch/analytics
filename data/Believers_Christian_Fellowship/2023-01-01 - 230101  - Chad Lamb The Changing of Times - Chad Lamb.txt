Acts chapter 15 and we'll read verse 18. I want to take a minute and just wish you a happy New Year amen and pray God's blessings be upon each one of you you know the world is full of uncertainty and there's no sure thing it seems like in the world anymore but we're certain amen we've got we've been established upon the word of God we are on a rock of Revelation and that revelation will not change that word of God will not change well God is determined to do in this coming year he will do amen and he has a plan and we are included in that plan so we're thankful for that I also would like to welcome some visitors we have brother Sergey and sister Julia from Idaho God bless you Sister Julia's brother ilya's sister so it's good to have you and your family here amen it's a good time it's good to see so many of you back I know the crowd was thin a few weeks ago because we had sickness sweeping through every kind of virus and cold and everything was going on at the same time but praise God we're here together amen so it's good to see you all I told I think it was one of the deacons I said when finally everybody's well and back it would be like Revival meetings it'll be like a camp meeting to have everybody back in the building together again amen but let's read this scripture and then we'll move on Acts chapter 15 verse 18. known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world Amen you can have your seats we'll ask the Lord to bless us as we look into his word and and I want to title this if I can the changing of times I mean we know uh brother bam has some things to say about this and we'll look into that but I want to go to Acts chapter 17 together while we have our Bibles open Acts chapter 17. and I'm going to pick up a scripture in verse 22. Acts chapter 17 verse 22 says then Paul stood in the midst of Mars Hill and said you men of Athens I perceived it in all things you are too superstitious first I passed by and beheld your devotions I found an altar with this inscription to the unknown God whom therefore you ignorantly worship Him declare I unto you God that made the world and all things there and seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshiped with men's hands as though he needeth anything seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on the face of the Earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation amen so we see here that God has appointed determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation and Paul is declaring this to the Gentiles he's bringing the message to the Gentiles but he's letting them know this one that you worship is the unknown God he's the one that's appointed your habitation your bounds and your time amen and time is in his hand time is the creation of God God created it he controls it amen he knows when and how he'll do everything he intends to do so the time it was a before appointed of God brother Graham says nothing's out of kilter everything's just ticking right on time with God God hasn't uh forgotten anything he hasn't misplaced anything nothing's happening outside of his ordination of his ordering it so so everything is just as it should be amen so we know who controls the time and the message Shalom from 1964 brother Ben says changing the pages or changing calendars doesn't change time you know for us you know we have that marker you know that every year we've been counting years and uh counting from 2022 to 2023 and and and we do this counting and for us it's a marker of time it's a cycle of time we're moving into another cycle but that's not exactly how God looks at time amen because man's calendars have changed over time we've had the Julian calendar and the Roman Calendar there was a Jewish calendar and Babylonian calendar amen but God is Not determined he's not he's not uh waiting for our calendar to turn he has his own keeping of time he's got his own appointed time so the changing the pages uh the counting doesn't change time so the question is what does change time I mean we look at the changing of times it's not just changing the calendar it's not even marking another Sunrise although that's how we keep time amen but for God he marks times he marks Seasons he's got an appointed time appointed seasons and dispensations and how does God change time it's not the flipping of a calendar so I'll read that again changing the pages or uh uh changing Pages or changing calendars doesn't change time a lot of people say well the old Year's gone throw away the old December calendar now put up the uh the other one a new year and that's what New Year's means to them I thought of this quote as yesterday I took down last year's calendar amen last night I put up the new calendar so in the morning it would read the right time amen for us that's significant but for God there's another turning of pages another changing of times that's more significant than the flipping of a calendar amen and and that's why we we may be able to know what year it is and it's important for us to know uh what what time we're in Naturally Speaking because so many things are based on calendar dates and times and seasons and for our natural life we need to know what year you're in if you're going to fill out a check you got to put the right date we need to know where we're at but spiritually speaking we must know where we're at In God's Time amen so it's important so he says he goes on to say to me I want to see what's promised for the day I want to know what the light of the hour is so I can know how to walk in it I want to know where I'm living what age I'm in how far up the road I am amen and thank God that God has changed times for us and he's given us a way to see his calendar by the grace of God he's let he's let us he's let his bride see his calendar so many people have missed down through time they've missed the changing of God's calendar I'm just saying that you know as a typer I don't know that God went over and flipped the calendar but the changing of times and dispensational times and changing of Ages God brought the change and so many people missed the flip of the calendar and they don't know how to live and they're missing the appointments they're missing the appointed time because they're still looking at an old calendar they're still back in a previous dispensation amen but we need to know where God is in time where we are on God's time amen so that we know how to conduct ourselves because there's certain things that are important appointed for certain seasons there's certain time pieces and markers on God's calendar amen where certain things are to be accomplished in certain seasons and in certain ages and if we don't know where we're at amen we're trying to do God a service in the wrong dispensation and we're not accomplishing what God once accomplished in this day we're doing a work that God wanted in a previous age but he wants us to do something different in this age so it's important to keep up with God's changing calendar let's go to Galatians chapter 4. I'm just gonna take a look through the Bible here at this subject what we're referring to Galatians chapter 4. and verse 3. Paul the Apostle writes in Galatians 4 3 even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law so there was a certain time that Christ would come and when the fullness of time or when the completion of that age when it was time for that age to come in the fullness of time amen he sent forth his son amen he's not saying here that when all time is completely run out no when it comes to the fullness of that age when it's time now for God to turn the calendar amen he sent forth his son so God there's ages and dispensations amen in times and Seasons with God and God knows when they start and God knows when they end and he knows how to turn the calendar to indicate we're moving from one age to the next age amen and when the fullness of time on God's calendar came amen he sent his son but he's gone let's go to Mark chapter one Mark chapter 1 and verse 1. Mark 1 and 1. in the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the son of God as it is written in the prophets behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare the way before Thee the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his path straight John did baptize in the wilderness and preached and preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins and there went out unto him all the land of Judea and day of Jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan confessing their sins and John was closed with camel's hair and with a girdle of skin about his loins and he did eat locusts and wild honey and preached saying there cometh one mightier than I after me the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose I indeed have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost amen so now John comes according to the scriptures because we've come to the fullness of time and it's time for God to flip his calendar it's time to go from one age or one dispensation to another and God has had ages and dispensations all the way down through amen and now it's time but the way that God flips his calendar is he sends somebody who can catch the message for the hour and deliver the message and that's how God transitions from one age to another so when God now is transitioning amen from law to Grace now he brings John the Baptist according to the promise there must be one that comes and prepares the way and so John is here for the flipping of the calendar for the changing of times amen so he he Faithfully declares his message and John now they come and ask him are you the Christ and he denies that and he tells him who he is in the scripture and but John now is not pointing to himself he's here to get them to see what's coming in this age he's saying but there's one coming who's mightier than I amen I'm here to indicate a change in dispensation amen but this change in dispensation is all about the one I'm for running amen amen we know this this is the day that we live and amen we're right here I mean the Bible is repeated in our day we've had a forerunner come to indicate that God is turning the page of his a Bible again he's turning the page of his calendar again amen and catch the changing of dispensation or the changing of age amen when the Forerunner comes on the scene uh John the Baptist even says in one place there's one standing among you now amen and well how did he know there was one standing among them now because he was there Amen to make straight his paths he was there to declare in the changing and dispensation and he told them there's one here now amen the what we're turning to is here amen and though John was there as an indication of the change of time amen so many missed the changing of the calendar they didn't they didn't want amen time to move on I don't mean time is in well we know time they didn't want time to move in God's timepiece amen they were content staying where they were amen there was a whole slew of people that were happy with religion with the religious order and the way things were structured amen they didn't want to change at least they didn't want to change the way God wanted to change they wanted to go to another age but they wanted to go straight to the age where the Victor would come in push out the Romans set up the kingdom and all of that but they didn't understand God's turning of a page amen and didn't want to turn and God's appointed time they wanted to jump to the time they wanted amen and so when God comes to fulfill his word in an unexpected way it was an appointed time nothing was going to change it was going to happen anyways but they didn't want to go from this turning of the calendar to the next they would love to have went from this one to one way off in the future but God had sent he had sent according to his word a forerunner a prophet a man who was there to indicate the changing of time brother Branham says the first time we were called Saints of course when the New Testament terms we'd have to go back to the first of the New Testament John the Baptist stood between law and Grace he was a prophet the Forerunner of Jesus Christ which was the bridge between the law dispensation and the grace dispensation so here John the Baptist is standing there as a bridge Amen to move from one dispensation to another and we we recognize that there was people who were following John the Baptist they were caught a hold of his ministry and understood him to be a prophet amen and and they understood he was a forerunner in the changing of of dispensations and all of that but you realize that there were some of those who never got off the bridge they got on the bridge from one dispensation to another but they never got off the bridge they stayed on the bridge amen because when Paul met them they didn't even know whether their be a holy ghost when they when some of them came to Jesus asking if he were him or should he send another one I mean they were still with John they believed John amen but they didn't catch the it was like the calendar got stuck straight up and it didn't flip all the way over and he was there to bridge from one dispensation into another dispensation so that they would move from one into the other not so that they would stay stuck in a gap it was so that they would Bridge their way over and then the same things happen to us in this day there's been another Bridge that's come in the breach was the breach a gap in the wall who's the man that's going to stand in the Gap to be the Bridge from from one dispensation to another dispensation it'll be another Forerunner amen but he didn't come standing in the Gap so that we would come and stand in the Gap but he came so we can move and transition in God's time from one time to another time from one age to another age you know amen let's go to let's look here again further in Mark chapter one let's go down to verse 45. no I'm sorry I want to go to verse 14. let's go to verse 14. um Mark 1 14 and now after that John was put in prison Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel so after John after John was in prison Here Comes Jesus now preaching saying the time is fulfilled amen the calendar is flipped have you made the transition amen let's look over at Matthew 13 now Matthew 13. and verse 16. Matthew 13 and 16. he says but blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them Jesus is now indicating that you are in the dispensation of seeing and hearing the the time is fulfilled the gospel the kingdom is present you are now in the time of seeing and hearing and many prophets and righteous men of old have longed to see your day but they couldn't because they were in another place in the calendar they were not able to see no matter how much they wanted to see they couldn't see until God flipped the calendar they were looking at these things afar off amen they were seeing them in types and in Shadows and in prophecies and longing to know when and longing to see and they were earnestly Desiring to to know when these things would be but Jesus is now standing to a group of people saying listen now there's there was a whole group of prophets down Through the Ages and righteous men who longed to see what you've seen But blessed are your eyes because you're here in the appointed time you're here when God changed the time amen can you cross over the bridge amen can you see and can you hear what time it is he said they're blessed others wanted to be there but they couldn't get there and it goes to show that you can't you can't surprise supersede God's appointed time you can't get ahead of God's time amen you can't go until God goes you can't open until God opens amen so let's look at Galatians chapter one now Galatians chapter one in verse 13. this Apostle Paul now giving his testimony in verse 13 He says for you have heard of my conversion in time past in the Jews religion have that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and I wasted it and profited in a Jewish religion above many mind equals in my own Nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son and me that I might preach him among the Heathen immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood neither when I up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me but I went to Arabia and returned again unto Damascus so here the Apostle Paul sharing his testimony and he says when it pleased God when it please gone when the time was right and it was God's appointed time the one who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace amen he separated me out into a work when it pleased him amen Paul never called himself God Called Paul God Paul never appointed the time of his birth God appointed the time of his birth and separated him from his mother's womb and watched over his life and knew exactly when he would call him because God has an appointed time for every dispensation in every Age and and Paul was moving along doing his thing the best he knew how to do it but God had an appointed date and a time at the time stamp when he would come to Paul and he would grab a hold of Paul because Paul was going to be another bridge in dispensation to bring from one dispensation to another dispensation Paul was going to be there to transition from Jew to Gentile amen and so Paul never decided on his own it was time he never came to the Lord and said it's time God knew when it was time and he knew when to get a hold of Paul and then he was going to use Paul's Ministry to turn the page of the calendar praise be to God amen let's look at Acts chapter 13. Acts chapter 13. in verse 46. when Paul and Barnabas wax bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles right here is marking a turning amen it's a marking in time and it's a necessary part of the Turning of the calendar that it must first be preached into the Gentiles but because they deem themselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lord we turn to the Gentiles in listen to verse 47 for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation to the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed amen there was some sitting there that were ordained to eternal life but they must see the dispensational change they must see the Forerunner come the one standing in the Gap the bridge between one dispensation and another and it was prophesied hey they knew that this would happen they knew they would turn to the Gentiles because God had already told them you're going to fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah so there's a scripture laying there and it's time now for this for this scripture to go into effect amen so God calls Paul and he connects Paul with with Isaiah and he brings these two things together in an appointed time because he's turning his calendar now he's moving from Jews unto Gentiles he's going to start collecting his Gentile bride and he's going to bring somebody to indicate the changing of time he's bringing a prophet a messenger on the scene and that's the Apostle Paul and when you look at this God is the one who's doing all of it these men are just yielding themselves to God but they couldn't control the changing of time they couldn't control the season that they were in God was in absolute control the prophecies were dictating God's uh God's God's Own desire and own knowledge foreknowledge was indicating when this would happen so Paul was born at the right time called at the right time amen he went unto the uh to the the Jews and the Jews rejected him and he turned to the Gentiles marking a change in dispensation amen and all of this was according to the scripture and it all marked God's time but listen to the response of the the Gentiles he says and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed there were some that were there waiting waiting for this dispensation waiting for this time they were ordained for this hour they were ordained for this season amen they were not to be proselyte Jews but they were to be bribed there were Gentiles with a sieging of Life ordained into eternal life waiting there and what were they waiting for they were waiting for an indication that the calendar is turned amen and when Paul indicated that this is the Turning of the calendar because you reject eternal life Lo we turn to the Gentiles for the scripture says amen and those with eternal life they believed they were glad they rejoiced because now they recognize this is my day this is the age that I was born for amen let's go to Romans chapter 11. and look at another dispensation Romans 11 and 25. this is Paul talking about the blinding of the Jews amen and so that they would reject their Messiah so that he could turn into the Gentiles and he says here in verse 25 for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery unless you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part has happened to Israel until that's another marker of time until the fullness of the Gentiles become in Paul is saying this blindness has come to the Jews for a purpose and it has a designated period of time this is another timepiece with God that blindness has come to the Jews until the fullness of the Gentiles become in but when the fullness of the Gentiles become in God will once again use prophetic Ministry he'll use two witnesses Amen to to Open the Eyes of the Jews so God is the one turning the calendar amen but how is he indicating that the times have changed he's using people he's using prophets he's using his prophecy being fulfilled in men Amen to indicate that we're moving from one dispensation to another dispensation he did this in Noah in Noah's time he was moving he was transitioning in Abraham's time he was transitioning and Moses's time he was transitioning amen he was moving now in Abraham's day amen he was now selecting out a family he was going to follow a family and now in Moses day he's calling on a nation amen now he he moves all the way down through and he's indicating I'm changing my dispensation I'm changing my time and now we're operating now we're going to be operating a little differently than we operated before is that right because when he changed the times amen he changed his mode of operation amen and people had to get with the times to know how to serve God in the age in which they lived praise God let's look at Titus Chapter one I'm just laying all these in as a foundation and then we'll start moving a little faster well maybe I don't know I'm not good at making predictions anymore Titus chapter 1. verse 1. it says Titus 1 1 Paul a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God's elect and the acknowledgment of the truth which is after godliness in Hope of eternal life which God that cannot lie promised before the world began but hath in due times there we go again but hath in due time manifested his word through preaching which is committed unto me according to the Commandment of God our savior look at what Paul is saying he he there's been a hope there's been a a promise of God there's been a mystery of God Amen but half in due times that's God's appointed time when it was ordained and due but half and do times manifest his word through preaching which is committed unto me according to the Commandment of God Paul is actually saying that that my preaching is indicating the due time that in due time when then he would make it known by preaching so in due time he'd make it known by preaching and I'm the one doing the preaching showing that it is now due time what what a statement for a human being to make let's go to Acts chapter 17 now Acts chapter 17 verse 28. acts 17 28. it says for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring for as much then as we are The Offspring of God we ought not to think that the godhead is likened to gold or silver or stone or Graven Graven by the art and man's devices and the times of this ignorance God winked at there's a Time indicator but the times of this ignorance God winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent because he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained wherefore he hath given Assurance unto all men and that he hath raised him from the dead Paul now is coming to the Gentiles this is part of the dialogue on Mars Hill he's standing there and he's talking to Gentiles and explaining to them the unknown God the one that appointed time and all of these things and he's saying this is how you worshiped in the past engraving images made in your own hands and that's not what God wants and in times past God winked at this amen but not anymore there's a change in dispensation and now what what was once acceptable is no longer acceptable anymore that's why amen if we want to serve God we must know the changing of God's time because the changing of God time always indicates how we worship God in this day when it changed when in Moses's day when Moses brought the law of God Amen that was now the proper way to approach unto God in that day but when it changed from law and to Grace amen under the ministry of Paul amen now you needed to know now this is the way to worship God we can't stay stuck back where we were just because it was acceptable before does not mean it's acceptable today so we must catch the changing of time but how do we catch the changing of time we must see the one God sent to indicate the mark the changing of time praise God now brother says in the evening messenger he says each messenger has had his message and the message in the messenger and the message and the messenger of the age it is most remarkable that each messenger we even found in the church ages and tonight we'll go back in the Old Testament and find that it's the same thing that God sends the messenger of that age at the end of the time always at the end never at the beginning at the end I'm going to mark this now as Luther's age faded out then Wesley's came in when Wesley's sanctification faded out Pentecost age came in it's always the messenger opens up the new message at the end of the old it's each age that's been done so is always comes at the end of the previous age Amen to bring what's what's the messenger doing I mean I don't just think of seven Church ages now all the way down through God's been sending us prophets and many times what they're doing is they're marking the end of one dispensation in the opening of another dispensation amen God sent Jeremiah Amen to indicate to them the end of their Sovereign rule in Israel and they were now moving into Babylon and he was there to tell them how to make the transition but they didn't want to believe him that they were transitioning into Babylon so they were rejecting him because they thought it's not possible but if they would have listened to him many lives would have been spared and they would have known how to conduct themselves because he was there bridging a gap between two dispensations amen and he was telling them how to get from one safely into the other and many of them completely missed it because they did not want it to be true the same thing all down through time they didn't want some of these dispensational changes to be true they wanted to stay where they were and be accepted where they were amen but in the dispensational change God may have winked at that for a time but it's not acceptable anymore amen now there's been a change in God's time and in a change in God's time in the new dispensation God has a way to be worshiped amen God has a way to be approached a way he's interacting with his people and in that change is the acceptable way praise God amen so brother banham now is going to begin pointing to the day that he's living in he's bringing it right home to where he's at and he's saying but let me tell you there will rise a messenger at the end of the Pentecostal age and wind up the thing it'll be a man will we know who that messenger is it's no mystery to us he's referring to his own Ministry but you know brother Branham could have no more made that the time then any of us can make any time the time you can't say well this is the time for that no God's the one who says it's time for that random couldn't indicate this is the time God's the one who marked that was the time amen and it was time for a dispensational change amen so God did what he always did when it was time for a change amen he brought a man on the scene that would indicate it's time for a change and and he says in the first seal he says then Along come the Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and they cabbage down on that now they cannot be no more ages that's all of it that's the the or the laodicean age we found in the studying of the scripture that the messenger to the age come right at the end of the age every time so now he's in preaching the seals he's in the first seal to the messenger the age came right at the end of the age every time Paul came at the End of the Age we find out that Arenas came at the End of the Age Martin into the age Luther into the Catholic age and want Wesley at the end of the Luther age and Pentecost at the End of the Age of sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word as God help me tonight to show you through here that to receive a messenger that will take all the Loose Ends out there and reveal the whole Secret Of God for the rapturing of the church what's he doing he's he's here in the first seal and he's telling you that every messenger came at the end of the age and we are supposed to receive at the end of the Pentecostal age a messenger amen someone who will tie together all the Loose Ends amen and reveal the whole Secret Of God for the rapturing of the church he's saying there's going to be another change in God's time and this change in God's time will be indicated by a messenger who will show up at the end of one amen and be a bridge unto the other is going to stand in the breach that's why he preach to breach amen praise God and and now the the question is will we stay on this side of the bridge are on this side of the bridge or are we going to stay somewhere on the bridge amen let's go to Ephesians chapter 3. Ephesians chapter 3. and verse 1. Ephesians 3 and 1. for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which has given me to you word how that by Revelation he may known unto me the mystery as I wrote a four in few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men and it is as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs under the same body and partakers of the promise in Christ by the gospel whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ through the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord Paul is making an outstanding statement here Paul is saying that in the previous dispensations they didn't know these things that there was a truth that was hidden in God a mystery that God knew that that he had kept hidden this is now Paul's preaching now the mystery that God had that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body amen and that mystery was unknown to those in previous ages amen showing that that God works through ages and God dispenses his understanding through ages that age it was withheld but Paul now is saying that in this age now this mystery is not withheld but I'm the one declaring what was in the back part of God's mind what they didn't know what the the part that Moses could not tell you amen the part that Jeremiah could not tell you the part that Isaiah could not say not what was hidden from them they saw it in symbols they saw it in time they saw it foreshadowed amen but now we're standing in the reality and now Paul say I am preaching this mystery to you amen and here he is a humble human being just a man and you can see how people would pass over it and pass over it and pass in his day Paul was a very rejected human being is that right Paul was very rejected rejected by the masses rejected by the Jews amen he even began to be rejected by some of the churches he planted rejected by some of the ministers that he ministered with some of the ministers he brought up amen now we're rejecting him but it didn't change who he was and it didn't change the fact that he was marking a change in dispensation and if you wanted to know what the dispensational change was you needed to listen to what Paul was preaching because Paul was preaching the mystery so there was people who were staying on one side or the other but Paul was the one God was using to bring us across and the first CEO he says all right and a thunder went off John knew it was the voice of God and the Limelight creature said come see what it was and John went forth now with his pen to write what he was going to see now he never seen exactly what it was he never understood it but what he saw was what God was sending to the church for a time now he's talking about in Revelation chapter 6 amen when when John amen he he he he sees the white horse rider go out and he sees it he was given a crown he had a bow and all of these things that's what he's referring to now he says now uh John took his pen and he went forth to write and he says uh he never seen exactly what it was he means the interpretation that he saw a white horse but he didn't see exactly what the White Horse was he didn't know it was the Antichrist spirit he says you never seen exactly what it was he never understood but what he saw was what God was sending to the church for a Time what was it the symbol was what was sent to the church for a Time but after that time something else is going to be given to the church so the symbols the symbols of uh uh the symbol of a white horse the symbol of a red horse the symbol of a black horse it was given for a time but at the end of that time there's going to be something else given and what is going to be given we all know what that is he said this is what he says ascending to the church for a time he will he always does he makes it plain when it's time to make it plain but he didn't he didn't make it plain then why because he was going to keep it a secret until the last days and the sounding of the last Angel's message was to gather up these Mysteries he didn't make it clear but what John saw he just seen a white horse go out with a rider on it so that's what he wrote down that's what he said come see so John when he went to see what he could could see to write to the church and when he did he saw a white horse and him that sat on and had a bow and he went forth conquering and to conquer and there was given to him a crown and now that's all John Saul he wrote it all down now see that's in symbol that's the way the church has received it but the promise that at the last day he'd reveal it show what it is God help us to understand he says for that time which is the church ages they would have the symbol but in God's appointed time he would show what it is it's not a white horse it's an antichrist spirit amen the crown that was given to him was given to him Amen in the third age amen and and all of these things there's a time appointed when he's going to show the church what that is and this is that time it marks a change in time but the change in time means everything to us it's just as significant as the time that was marked in John the Forerunner coming and Jesus coming on the scene it's just significant today as it was back then let's read Colossians chapter one now in verse 25. in Colossians chapter 1 verse 25 Paul says something very similar to what he says in Ephesians says whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory Paul once again is saying there's been a mystery which has been hid from ages and generations but now is made manifest to his Saints there's this mystery of the Seven Seals it was given a symbol form but it was hidden through the seven Church ages but it is going to be revealed and I will say it has been revealed when was it revealed when God turned the calendar when God changed the time I want to I want to move on and look at this brother bam says and the message I have heard but now I see he said now it's begin to pull away the Wheats begin to be seen this is not a Pentecostal age this is the latter day age this is the bride age this is the evening line this is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to follow God's pattern this is Luke 17 30 to be fulfilled and modern events made clear by prophecy he says what time is it that we're living in something like a calendar you look at the calendar to find out what day of the year you're living in and you look at God's Bible to see what age we're living in we're not living in the Methodist days the Baptist age we're living in the bright Age The Calling bringing back to God through a channel that he promised to bring it back in he promised to do it amen we've heard these things so many times but we don't want them to become so common that it's no longer exciting that God has turned the page because we're not in church ages anymore this is the bride age amen he said this is the end I said the messenger must come at the end of the age he comes at the end of the Pentecostal age and brother Branham said the Pentecostal age is the old laodicean churches so at the end he doesn't come at the beginning he comes at the end what's he doing he's marking out a closing of something and Bridging the way through a gap into something else what's he bridging his way into to the bright age amen and the bride age is not another church age think about this it's not another church age amen sometimes people fight the terminology Brides They want to fight that because they say you're adding another church age it's not a church age it's a bride Age The Very term indicates it cannot be an additional Church age because it is a bride age not a church age not an eighth Church age called breath no it's a bride age it's something completely different than the church ages you had Church ages you had first church age second Church age you had uh laodicean Church we're not talking about church ages anymore there's been a breach Amen to get us from here to get to somewhere else and there's somebody standing in the gap of the breach indicating a change in time to take us out of church ages into bright age not an additional age thank you amen because there's there is no argument here there is no eighth messenger eighth there's no eighth Church age amen that brother man said there is no Eighth Day it goes back to the first day amen so what is this addition what what comes at the end of the seven Church ages there is an age opened amen it's not a new age it's actually an old age [Music] it's not a new age amen it's an eternal age amen it's not marked by time it is a position it's what the church was intended to be when it was birthed at Pentecost but it fell into the church ages and now coming out of the church age there's got to be another indication of a change in time and in every Church age God indicated the change in time with a messenger to come move from one to the other but in this layer to cnh he was going to bring one at the end of the Pentecostal age to move us out of the church age into the bride age amen which is going right back to what the bride was intended to be at her very birth at Pentecost so there is there is no fear of an additional Church age there is no additional but everyone said there can be no more ages so we're at the end time the last days the latest interviews there can be no more amen and and believing that we're in a bright age is not denying the fact that the later to see an age is still continuing on because the laodicea and Edge will continue on until it enters into the tribulation period but the laodicean is a church age for the church but this message is a bride call to come out of the church it's a bright Age The Bride is not supposed to continue in the laodicean church age and go into tribulation she's been caught out of that amen so there's a dispensational change in our day there's been somebody to bridge the gap to move from church ages back into the bride age amen and react when did the bride age start oh my goodness it started before the foundation of the world when God's heart desire was to have a bride of his own choosing this opening of the word was opening of The Secret of God's mind his thought which is eternal we haven't moved into we haven't moved into a period of time where we count days and we count years we have moved back into the Eternal desire thought of God what he wanted from the beginning from before the foundation of the world is he wanted a bride of his own choosing amen this bright age is not something physical that's upon the Earth although it takes place in physical people every physical human beings amen are manifesting this it's the brother bam said that great Eternal Church age at the end of the seven Church ages amen it's eternal so there is no there is no basis for an argument that that we're adding an additional Church age there is no the seventh is completion that period of time is finished but God has sent a messenger in our day the same way he sent the Apostle Paul in his day the same way he sent John the Baptist in his day and he's here for a dispensational change for the changing of times and when the times changed it was always imperative to make the change think all the way down through history in any time that God sends a messenger to change his time we recognize that it's a super imperative that we make the change because if you didn't catch the change in Moses day and wanted to stay in Egypt you were lost if you didn't catch the change in Noah's day and wanted to refuse to go into the art you were lost you were doomed in John the Baptist day if you refuse to make the transition to Christ amen you were left behind you were blinded you were separated the same thing with the Apostle Paul if you if you didn't if you didn't receive the Gospel he was bringing which was the mystery for that day amen you were left out the same thing's true for today that's why I think it's I think it's so important for us to recognize this transition wasn't a minor transition and the prophet wasn't here just pointing to something that was going to happen way off decades and decades later but he was on Earth at the time the transition was being made just like with all the other transitional figures so it's important to make the change and it's also when when they moved when the Jews moved from law unto Grace under Christ amen they some of the Jews had a little bit of difficulty with that transition they didn't know exactly how to make it and it was a little bit of a difficult time but brother the Apostle Paul come down and he laid it down and he straightened it out and he said it in order so that they could take what he said and they can make the transition amen and some struggled some stayed behind and all these other things some straddled I seemed like two dispensations they still wanted to bring in circumcision to the Jews the Gentiles and all of these things and Paul was constantly against that he didn't want him straddling two ages he wanted them to move into the dispensation of Grace amen so that's why for us to realize that I'm not a church-aged believer because I will I will identify myself with the church but this is a different time this is where he wants to you to be identified as the bride because in the church ages God was dealing with two Vines if you look at every message the message to the church ages he's he's he's addressing two Vines two groups of people with within the church and he's dealing brother remember said to the churches he's dealing with two groups of people at the same time and within that church is his seed within that church is mingled in two seedlines two Vines two groups of people and he's dealing with them all the way through and and until he gets to the seventh Church age and in the seventh Church age there's a cry that comes out that says come out from among her my people and be ye separate he's no longer dealing with the church and dealing with two groups of people and you can see this in the laodicean church age because when you go to the laodicean church age it reads different than all the previous Church ages if you go to Ephesus and Smyrna and pergamers and all those others you'll see that he has an accommodation something he he he he he he he blesses them for or something he tells them and blesses them for doing something positive and then he has a correction something negative next Church Apes positive negative positive negative positive negative until he comes to the laodicean church and in the laodicean church he has not one positive thing to say about the laodicean church he doesn't have any he doesn't have any accommodation he doesn't have anything to bless them for or anything to commend them for he has nothing good to say about the laodicean church age because in that church age you find Christ on the outside knocking trying to get back in he's not even there amen so so that that tells me that he's changed the order of dealing with two Vines now he addresses the wrong Vine and he preaches the message through the prophet saying come out from among her now you've got to go beyond the camp to be United with the one who is persecuted outside the camp now to see if Jesus was put outside and now to be United with Christ you have to go out of the camp tonight Unite with him to me this is so I don't know it's so vitally important because it'll change the way we think it'll change the way we worship it changes our approach to God because under the church ages God's working with the church right it's individuals in the church but he's working with the ages but when he gets to the bride age he's only after one individual and that's you and he's not he's not um he's not in the face of building his body he's in the face of completing his body like everything's different in this change of time so we don't worship like we did in the church ages we don't think like we did in the church age we don't read the Bible like we did in the church ages for us amen making the change when the Apostle Paul amen got the message from Christ in Arabia for three and a half years his Bible became a new book because now the Apostle Paul comes out and he starts preaching Christ through all the old prophecies and go read the book of Hebrews and he's pulling out the shadows and types of the Tabernacle on the high priest and he's pulling out prophecies and he's connecting all of these prophecies why because Paul was reading the Bible and reading the Bible and reading the Bible but he was doing it under a previous dispensation is that right he was a Jew he was a Pharisee among Pharisees he was zealous he was schooled under the school of Gamaliel he he had all of this in this previous dispensation but he had to count it as if it was done that he might win Christ and he had to re-learn amen everything that he thought he knew he knew it through the wrong set of glasses he was viewing it through the wrong perspective amen but when the change of time comes then the change of perspective comes and under this change of perspective then all of a sudden you can see and you can see what that prophecy means and he can see this is for this day and this is for this day and then Paul could say it's all for this day the Tabernacle the high priest the sacrifices he could see it over and so in the day that we live in we must make the transition from church ages and to Bright age to understand what the prophet came to do he came to bridge he came to indicate a changing of the calendar and it will actually change the way we think it'll change the way we read the Bible so many things in the Book of Revelation if we haven't made the change in the Book of Revelation we keep we keep looking at future future you read this prophecy future this prophecy future this prophecy future but when you've made the transition all of a sudden you say that's past that's past that's past that's right now that's happening right that's happening in me amen when you've made the transition you go to Revelation chapter 10 you read 8 to 11 verses 8 to 11 and you say that's going on right now these are future events amen these are things that have happened amen you go and you read through the first three chapters and you're all sudden you're like that's history this is not future this is history amen then you start reading the rest and say that's happened that's happened that's happened that's happened it's all happened or happening and you say it changes everything about Who We Are brother ma'am is is preaching and what is the attraction on the mountain he says and about that time the prophet turned and said behold here comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world now watch the attraction it changed from the prophet to his prophecy he's talking about John the Baptist and John the Baptist made the statement he he he was preaching he says there's one standing among you and he's saying I'm Forerunner I'm I'm not him but I'm preparing the way making the past great so he indicates all of this but when Jesus comes he said Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world and brother bear speaking what is the attraction on the mountain he says what what is that attraction what was the attraction it changed from the prophet to his prophecy there was a dispensational change no longer was he just for running now the thing that he forerun was there it was it wasn't just for running anymore now he had four run is coming and now he was present that was the attraction and listen what brother Baron's preaching he's preaching what is the attraction on the mountain and he's going to Zachariah Amen in the and he's talking about the scripture Zechariah where Jesus comes riding down on a donkey and he's fulfilling the scriptures and the people are shouting and then the Pharisees are wondering what is all the shouting about why are the people so excited and they had no idea that the very prophecy that they had quoted over and over was alive right in front of them and that was the attraction on the mountain that day the the what was the attraction prophecy brother when I said prophecy being fulfilled what was the attraction in John the Baptist day oh in his day he was a forerunner he was a prophet he was preparing the way but when Christ came to him Amen to be baptized and he declared him the Lamb of God and then all of a sudden it changed from his Prophet Prophecy from the prophet to the prophecy now what day the transition had been made now what he prophesied the prophecy of all the prophets was there he was present and those who recognize that their lives were forever changed the ones who John and Andrew and Peter and those who saw it who who made the transition their lives were never the same they may not have understood it all as it was happening they may have still had some wrong understanding about times and Seasons but they caught that this was the fulfilling of the prophecy they caught who this was amen and and what did it do it changed their entire life the same thing's true for you and I listen to what brother bam says in spoken word is the Original Seed he says actually before we do that let's all stand up some of you rung in the new year and I can tell Happy New Year we're doing the rest of this Thursday no I'm just kidding I'm just helping you just a little bit spoken word is the Original Seed people as Elijah was the first uh was first time to ahab's time it will happen here in this country he's talking about Elijah and Ahab he's going all the way back to the Old Testament showing Elijah was there at the time of Ahab he said so will it happen in this country I want you to stand to hear this because you need to hear this these things are familiar this is not new but it's so rich amen is it as this country is a type of Israel and then he says read or hear Jezebel religion he wants them to go listen to the message he preached as this country our forefathers for worship the way they want to come to this country and pushed out the natives and took over so did Israel take over when they come out of Egypt we had Godly men like Washington Lincoln they had great godly men as David and so forth then they got an Ahab on the throne with a jezebel behind him to direct him so have we he's going right to the right to the presidency of John F Kennedy amen and he and he shows that he's Catholic that's the woman that's behind him but also shows his wife as a type of that he says she's the one that turns the head so he says they got an Ahab on the throne with a jezebel behind him to direct him so have we now listen to the next statement so it's at this time in this country that that person will appear thank you yes he made it so obvious he says what they had there when Elijah was on the scene is what they have here now it's at this time and in this country this person will appear no future time it's right now amen and and that's fine but what does it mean that this person's on the scene what is the consequences of having that person on the scene it's not just neat saying Oh Brother Branham he was the Fulfillment of Malachi 4. amen we saw Luke 17 30 in his ministry we know it was the forerunning and all of these things but what is the significance of having him here it shows a changing of time a changing of dispensation amen and it's happening right in the time of that man's Ministry and it's not saying oh we saw what he did oh praise God someday will happen no you missed it it happened while he was here because that's what he was here for so it's at this time in this country that this person will appear first in the scripture and it's thus saith the Lord then in the latter rain there will come forth a Mount Carmel a showdown Bible fulfilled to the letter John the Baptist his messenger before his face in Malachi 3 planted a form of rain and was rejected by the churches the denominations the Pharisees and the Sadducees in his day Jesus came and had the mount Transfiguration Showdown this Forerunner of the last days will sow for the former Reign Jesus will be the showdown between denominations and creeds what's The Showdown Jesus will be who's Jesus the word will be the showdown between the nominations and Creeds so what's The Showdown it's the word and it's the denomination in Creed I wonder who's going to win that Showdown [Music] Jesus will be the showdown between the nominations and Creeds which is the word then when he comes a showdown the Rapture of his bride the first was Mount Carmel the second was Mount Transfiguration the third will be Mount Zion Glory all right you can have your seats if you need more help I'll help you again we're going to work together we're laboring together for the word amen amen don't forget that brother Venom said it's to pull on the gift he said the congregation is 50 percent so when I start feeling like I'm running through knee-deep water I'm saying God what's going on we had too much party last night amen so so now there's a Mount Zion Showdown which is the rapture of his bride amen we know that the Rapture is going on now he's he's calling us he's resurrecting us out of dead denominationalism he's bringing us to life brother Branham said that your soul raptured amen it was a quickening it was an Awakening it was a drawing us up out of laodicea and quickening us into the to the union with Christ and we know that it'll culminate with the change in our atoms with the change of our bodies will be the completion of the finishing of the Rapture but don't wait for the Rapture get in the rapture because the Lord himself will descend with a shout where the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God what is that it's the coming of the Lord and what is the shout it's the message to gather the bride together so so don't keep putting things off in the future saying someday there'll be a Rapture someday there'll be a Rapture no there's a Rapture going on right now when you heard the eagle scream when you heard the word you raptured up quickly to meet it amen amen so the Rapture is going on and will culminate in a body change amen but we must be in the cycle we must make the transition amen or else we're going to be sitting stuck in a laodicean age with laodicean thinking with church age mentality hoping that someday someday something's going to happen and someday I'll be changed when brother Branham said the quickening power has come amen at the rising of the Sun the quickening power came what was the rising of the sun it's when Christ Jesus the full word the headship returned back to the church it was the evening lights come at the at the sounding of the seven Thunders the evening light returned it was the rising of the sun it's the setting of the Sun for the world they grow in Gross Darkness but arise and shine for thy light has come the world's in darkness you're in light amen it's the setting of the Sun for them it's the rising of the Sun for you and the rising of the sun brought the quickening power and what was the quickening power it came to Quicken the word to life what word the word that's laying in your soul the portion of God that he wants to be expressed in this day that thought he had of you before the foundation of the world the seed of himself that he planted in you to be expressed in this day the quickening power is here to Quicken that seed to life to do what to live the life of Jesus Christ [Music] in what form in Bride form so the quickening power is here what quickening power the same quickening power that'll change your atom is the quickening power that's already changing you from a church member to a bride the same exact quickening power that changed you from church and listen uh the young people that are here I'm not talking about you have to leave a certain Church you have to leave a denomination no I'm telling you you're raised up with a natural sort of thinking a carnality that you have to be quickened out of Amen in this this Revelation has to be made alive inside of you amen it has to become yours you have to go you need the quickening power too to Quicken that seed to life amen the quickening power is here so that we're no longer amen trying to do things in an order in a form or in a group but now all of a sudden the quickening power has come to make the word live in me make it what alive where it is alive and the church know it's alive in me [Music] where is the message is it in a building is it on the thumb drive and your computer know the message is in me it's living it's breathing it's manifesting by what the quickening power but events that it quickened you it quickened you from a church member it quickened you amen and he starts to talk about that he said how do I know brother Branham he says you used to smoke you used to drink and you changed what did that he said quickening power did that so praise be to God we're not in the age where we're saying oh something's coming something's coming something's coming no we're in the age we say something has come and that's something that has come is the very thing that is transitioning me amen into the next phase so if we're constantly looking for something to come if we constantly need something to come then then we set ourselves up in danger for needing more than what we have now I'm not saying that what we have won't become more clear I'm not saying that the Revelation that's in the Revelation then the message is still opening to me it may be done opening to you but it's still opening to me I'm still seeing it in ways I've never seen it before things are still opening up on a on a daily basis and and it's becoming fresh and Alive over and over again so I'm not talking about that when I mean new things are becoming new to me but they were already in the message they were already I didn't have to get new books they were already in my Bible they were already on those tapes I didn't have to change them out and exchange them for different ones amen but the problem is if we if we constantly need something well something will happen and then something will happen and then I mean we're we're actually delaying our own growth and refusing the very thing that's taking us to where we're going amen the very power amen that's carrying us is this word quickening power is here the headship is here the Life of Christ is here not in measure like to the churches but in fullness no longer is it time for a dip in the spirit but now it's to be completely uh submerged completely filled completely whatever with the spirit of God so brother van was telling us that he's giving a marker indicator that now the United States is sitting in the same place Israel was when Elijah came and now with an Ahab on the throne and a jezebel system to back him up and direct him he said at this time and in this guy boy I love that at this time and in this country that person will appear I remember years ago when I first first heard the message and was listening to it somebody would say you know brother Branham never he never said he was the Fulfillment of an archive four he never said he was Elijah and I said oh really he didn't and I go looking through and sure enough you can't see quotes where he says I am Elijah I am Malachi 4. but then I just kept reading the message and I said he most certainly did he said it every which way you can say it but for those with eyes to see and ears to hear it's as plain as the nose on her own faces it's right here it's at this time and in this country that this person will appear so if if it wasn't him who wasn't because it had to do it in the days of of the Ahab that was on the throne in the days of of the presidency of John F Kennedy so who was it praise God again in spoken words the original City says as the end time prophecies will repeat as the end time prophecies will repeat I believe as the first Forerunner came from the Wilderness and cried Behold the Lamb of God the second Forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word-born bride I love this quote if we just read it and take it the way he says it it opens so much understanding John the Baptist was there to indicate the arrival of the Lamb of God he was the Forerunner making the way straight and then when he forerun appeared on the scene he declared what it was Behold the Lamb of God that take away the sin of the world and he says that will repeat he said that will probably repeat I said the second form will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word-born bride so how is he going to declare the coming of the Lord how will he declare the Fulfillment of his prophecy he come to forerun something how will he declare what he forerun by first pointing to a word-born bride because if you can see the word born bride you can see where Christ is because he came to unite with his bride the headship came to connect with the body so if what so why does he point to a word born bride because that's where the headship came to that's where Christ came in this day now he's to be made manifest in the form of the Bride that's why that's why it's so it's so um difficult for people to receive that so difficult to believe it because it's just like it always was it's just like the baby in the manger it's like the Shepherds with the message who would believe a shepherd who would believe in illiterate young Shepherd amen who's who spends his time in the field with the Sheep No Education no schooling no theological background I mean I don't even know what his church attendance was like probably couldn't quote the scriptures verbatim probably couldn't read the scriptures for himself but they had the message and they said Hey listen he said the king is born amen the king of the Jews is here Christ Jesus amen the Messiah is on Earth and if he were like boy what are you talking about Jesus is here Christ we saw him the Messiah is here whoa yeah yeah hey say where is he he's over in that Barn over there look at a manger and he's wrapped up in some cloth off a yoke of an oxen and it's that little baby laying there and the people will say that that can't be it you see Jesus you know on the street walking playing I don't know what he did whatever he did as a boy as a 10 year old boy you say messiah's here the king of the Jews is here where is he is that boy over there that one you know the one that's walking looking down dragging his feet that can't be him but it was he was the one who was rejected he was the one who was mocked he was the one that was him they couldn't believe it because it was just in human form they couldn't believe because it was it's appeared so common and it was in human form and it was so beyond reason that they just couldn't accept it but the question is could it be the same way today could it be just difficult for the human mind to perceive that Christ would actually come he would return to the Earth that he would be present now Among Us and you say where would he be well that Prophet would point to a word born bride listen yeah they're nice people and all but that can't be it that can't be it so I will look for something else because that can't be it I will wait and watch for something else because when it happens it'll be obvious it can't be that humble it can't be that simple it can't it can't be those people maybe it can't but maybe it can the second Forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word-born bride the bride of Christ will be pointed to the skies at the peering of Jesus so the it didn't say the bride will be pointing to the skies she will be pointed to the skies that means somebody else is directing her attention the bride of Christ will be pointed to the skies at the appearing of Jesus screaming Behold the Lamb of God will come forth from his lips God help us to be ready for this near event he preached this in in March of 1962 one year before he preached the seals God help us for this near event amen I want to ask you did this Forerunner point to a word born bride and did he direct her attention to the skies and tell us who that cloud was who that was up there that's our Lord up there God help us for this near event near event it's a past event now it's come it's happened he's here the headship is here United to the body if you want to find him find where he is he is what he is the word may manifest for this day what is the word for this day the word is Jesus Christ in Bride form brother ma'am he relates the same thing he's he's speaking here in spoken word is the original seat about a part where he was told to pick up his pen and write and the angel directed him to write what he writes and when he was done writing he had to go back and read it he didn't even know what he was writing and he and he mentions it again or he records it again in the church age book and this is that same section he says the last day Messenger will appear in God's appointed time praise God how many are you of you are so thankful that it's been God's appointed time I'm so thankful that I can say that that messenger came at God's appointed time he appeared at God's appointed time it is the end time now as all know for Israel is in the Homeland anytime now he will come according to Malachi when we see him he will be dedicated to the word he will be indicated pointed out in the word revelation 10 7. and God will vindicate his ministry he will preach the truth as did Elijah and be ready for the Mount Zion Showdown many will misunderstand him because they have been taught scripture in a certain way which they consider truth that's the denominational understanding of the Bible so that's why they misunderstood him that's why we've misunderstood him listen if you believe this message for any period of time there's been a time you misunderstood him is that right I hope I'm not the only one but there's been times where I've been misunderstanding what the prophet's saying but all of a sudden God will bring a revelation he say oh that's what he means that's what that scripture is he's preaching exactly this scripture but my understanding of that scripture was putting it somewhere else I wouldn't allow that scripture to be applied to this prophet in this time and I hope we can all be honest enough to say we all did that we all had a certain understanding and we would not allow that scripture to mean what the prophet was using it to mean but all of a sudden when the Revelation clicks you say it he means exactly what he's saying he knows exactly the scripture he's using and it's the truth so he says so many will misunderstand him because they've been taught scripture in a certain way which they consider truth when he comes against that they will not believe even some true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called God's truth by deceivers what causes even true ministers to misunderstand denominational teaching of the scriptures amen that's why I've said for years I wish I had a delete button in my mind where I could delete everything I ever understood I could download a fresh copy of the Bible and download the message to shine the light and illuminate the Bible so that I would get the correct interpretation of the word because so much of the problems that I've had have been problems between my ears says now but this Prophet will come and is the Forerunner to the first came cried Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world even so will he no doubt cry out Behold the Lamb of God coming in glory he will do this for even as John was the messenger of Truth to the elect so is this one the messenger to the elect and word-born Prime let's go to Revelation chapter 10. Revelation chapter 10. and verse 1 Revelation 10 and 1. and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud on a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet is pillars of Fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea in his left foot upon the Earth now let's go down to verse 7. but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets now we know these scriptures and but brother Branham in the message he gives us the translation interpretation of these scriptures Revelation 10 7 is the Angel to the seventh seventh Church age he's a seventh Church age Angel which he says is a man so Revelation 10 7 is an angel an angel's a messenger it's the seventh Messenger to the seventh Church age amen the seven Church age messenger which is William Branham he's been clearly identified that's who he is Revelations 10 1 is a mighty Angel and brother Branham says only Christ it could be he said it's the angel of the Covenant it's Christ so he says this Angel is Christ this angel in seven is the seventh Church age Messenger right and then he says this Angel the seventh Church eighth Messenger will be on Earth at the time of this coming who's coming the mighty angel the word the word who did he say it was he said only Christ it could be what was it it was the coming of Christ it was the coming of the Lord when when that angel amen that Malachi 4 Elijah that that fulfillment of Luke 17 30. that all those scriptures combined had to come when there was an Ahab on the throne with a jezebel system behind it yeah and John F Kennedy's Administration that's when Elijah had to be on the scene at that time and at that time Revelation 10 is fulfilled he is on Earth at the time of this coming he doesn't say at the time of this Revelation at the time of this knowing he says at the time of this coming praise God I don't know about you but I want to get all the way over the bridge into this new dispensation I don't want to stay in the church ages I don't want to stay on the bridge say someday we'll get over there someday we'll get over there God's already changed the times God has already flipped the calendar now it's up to us whether we have faith enough to move with the calendar because there's appointments in this new calendar but you're not going to make those appointments if you're still in the old calendar another man in the visible Union of the Bride he says the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day no sir that was for Pentecostals this is for the bride going home of the Bride what is the word that we received come to do it's come to take us home this is for the going home of the Bride that's why we can't wait we must receive amen we got something different the Pentecost represented that again we're in the bright age no more than the word of no it will work in the days of Moses no more Moses law would have worked in the time of Paul he tried to tell them you are dead to that and you cannot have that amen what was Paul saying you're dead to that you can't go back to that and now we cannot go back to the Pentecostal age we cannot go back to the church ages amen we have to be dead to that this is a bride age this is for the bride for the going home of the Bride in the first seal Prophet says now notice but it's to be revealed when the lamb leaves his intercessory place from the father now that's Revelation 5 now he takes the book of seals the book of seals or a book sealed with seals breaks them and shows them at the End of the Age now after the intercessory is over the church ages has done finished up so when does he break the seals at the at the End of the Age when does the messenger come at the End of the Age when does he break the seals when the church ages has done finished up we've mentioned before done finished up it doesn't mean laodicea is not going on it's not doesn't mean that the world's not in laodicea it doesn't mean that laodicea is not still marching to tribulation but that age is finished up for his bride the Pentecostal age bride is sealed now he's calling out of that age to seal a bride for the bride age God did what he was going to do in the laodicean church age with the Pentecostal bride he sealed them he called them they were genuine they were legitimate they were the Bride of the age but at some point he ended that dispensation and was no longer sealing a bride there but now he was calling her out there was a transition when when the church agents has done finished up brother Adam says if you would only know what they were living in there wouldn't be so much confusion about this message and about the scriptures that we're trying to bring to the people if the people only understood that we're at the end time brother said if you only knew where we were there wouldn't be all this confusion what made everybody confused is they didn't know where we were on the calendar we're confused about the message I'll tell you all the confusion I've had about the message through the years is because I didn't realize where we were on God's calendar when brother Benham says he says it may be later than you think I found out that was true I found that right clear that that was absolutely true it was later than I was thinking so if we only knew where we were at in God's calendar the message wouldn't be confusing if we think that we're part of the laodicean church and part of the laosian church age and then we're confused about things in the message but when we realized there's been a dispensational change there's been a door open in heaven and there's been a bridge that gapped the Gap to bring us into the bright age then all of a sudden the message becomes clear I want to read two scriptures now let's go to Daniel chapter 12. Daniel chapter 12. verse 8. Daniel chapter eight I'm sorry Daniel chapter 12 verse 8. he says and I heard but I understood not then said I oh my Lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end Daniel wanted to know what the interpretation of some of these things were the events that he had seen he didn't understand he said I understood not and he was seeking understanding but he was told to go his way that the words are closed up and sealed to the time of the end so there's certain prophecies certain events certain things that were sealed until the time of the end so only in the end will they be open okay that's important that's an indicator of where we are in time let's go all the way over to revelation 22. actually before we get to revelation 22. let's go back to revelation 10. and go back to verse three Revelation 10 3 will pick up where we stopped reading and cried with the loud voices when the line roared and when he had cried seven Thunders out of their voices and when the seven Thunders uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things with the seven Thunders uttered and write them not so here we have another ceiling up we know this really well we've been through it John was told everything you see write in a book and and so John is recording everything that he sees and hears and and when when we seize the symbol of the seals going out he sees a white horse and and a crown was given he writes it down when he sees a red horse and a sword he writes it down he writes it all down now when he comes and hears the seven Thunders he hears something that's understandable because he was going to write what he heard so there was something that was spoken something that you could understand something that you could write a description of but he was told to seal him up and write them not so now he's he's told not to write let's go to revelation 22. revelation 22 and 6. and he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and the Lord God of the Holy prophets sent his Angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book and I John saw these things and heard them and then I and when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things then saith in to me see thou do it not for I am thy servant and of thy brother and the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God so at this time in revelation 22 amen John is a type of the Bride there's an angel messenger who is taking him through and showing him all these Revelations which is a type of brother Branham and now this he said after I seen all of these things I fell down to worship at the feet of the Angel and the angel says don't do it but I'm of thy fellow servant of thy Brethren of the prophets so now he declares at the end he declares who he is I'm a prophet showing that this is the prophet brother Branham so at this time when this is understood then he says verse 10 and he said unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand seal not sealed in Daniel's day to the end sealed in the seven Thunders when they uttered in Revelation 10 seal it don't write it but when we come all the way to the end the last chapter of the Bible when John realizes who this was that given these Revelations when when he comes and then he tells him he says seal not the sayings the prophecies book for the time is at hand what time the end time the end time when this Prophet this Angel is showing these things to the bride then the time is at hand now it's time for whatever was sealed to be unsealed and for it not to be sealed anymore that's the day we live in brother Branham said in leadership now you see it's weak time now it's getting Harvest Time this is not Luther's age this is not Pentecost age this is the bride age as Moses called a nation out of a Nation Christ today is calling a church out of a church you see and the same thing is type taking them to the Glory's Eternal Promised Land now to refuse that person that's doing the calling Christ no matter if you're Pentecostal Methodist Luther whatever you are you got to this age nothing against them not at all but in this age now you've got to accept like they did in that age the person of Christ which is the word then he quotes John 1 1. in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh into one Among Us the same yesterday today forever Hebrews 13 8. see you must accept that person of eternal life he says he's showing just like Moses called a nation out of a Nation now he's calling a church out of a church all right brother bam comes in the first seal and he says I'm going to call you bride so that you'll understand trying to show this is not Church systems Church ages church dispensations this is different and he says now just like Moses was called a nation of a Nation Christ today is calling church out of a church so who's doing the calling it's Christ how's he calling by revealing his word how is he calling his bride by revealing his word by opening his word by revealing the mystery of the seven Thunders by by tying all the loose ends together what's he doing he's calling his church why because he is the word he's calling them by the word because they also are the word and the word hears the word so it's the word Christ in our day that's calling the bride see we we get um we get so mixed up in our mind because we want to see a person in physical form but brother Adam said God is the word he said the word is God he says it over and over and over again he said Christ is the word Christ is the holy spirit Christ is God God is the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is God God is the word the word and the spirit are the same thing there's any old statements that he made we want to see a physical form but he's here he's calling how he is the word that's been restored he is the headship to the bride he is the person of the word he is here he's not limited he's not held in by by chains and barriers of denomination he's not held by chains of false understanding and false document he's been loosed he's here [Music] and he's calling by revealing the Mysteries now listen now to refuse that person that's doing the calling Christ no matter if your Pentecostal method is Luther whatever you are nothing against them not at all but in this age now you've got to accept the person of Christ which is the word that's why it's so important to catch the changing of time because now when you catch the changing of time now I can't believe like I did in the church ages I can't act like I did in the church ages I can't conduct myself I I there's been a change and this change brings a whole change in the order just like the change in Moses day change in Paul's day all these changes brought a whole new order this change brought a whole new order and now I'm not I'm not worshiping by my church's Creed I'm not worshiping with a group mentality I'm not worshiping with old denominational understanding but now everything has changed to where now it's not my brothers not my sister it's not the ones around me but now I've been changed into a different there's a different time change now and now in this dispensation it's just me and him it's just bride and bridegroom to be in the bright age you yourself as an individual must be United to the bridegroom not a group uniting not a group Mary this isn't a group marriage it's an individual uniting with Christ in order to be in the bride age we as individuals must be United with the bridegroom we can't depend on what everybody else around us is doing it must be us and if we Unite with him then we take the headship of our bridegroom which is the headship of the word and now we don't make statements like my church teaches or my church believes or we all think amen now you lose all of that because you're under the headship of Christ because he is your husband and the headship of Christ is the word and now when somebody asks you why you do what you do you say because the word says yeah why did you make that decision not because our church teaches why did you make that decision because the word says this is a different age this is not this is not the church age this is a bride age and we must talk different act different react different worship different I mean in in the bright age we don't just worship on Sundays and Wednesdays because it's not the church it's the bride now we worship when we lay down we worship when we rise up amen now we talk to him all day we tell him we love him I don't just tell him I love him when a song comes up that says oh I love you amen I tell him I love him all day long because there's a union now between me and he it's so far beyond the church age it's so God wants us to be deliberated completely liberated from any chain that will bind us he wants us to be completely free to be his and his alone that's the age that we live in brother Venom said in Shalom he said this is a new day what does that mean there's been a turning of the calendar there's been a rising of the Sun he said there was one long day in the church ages one long day amen it was a dismal day neither light or dark is that what he said one long day in the church ages but now he comes to Shalom and he says but this is a new day this is not the church ages day not the obscurity of clouds of doctrines of men but this is the rising of the Sun this is a new day Hallelujah this is a day that we should rise and shine in the power of Jesus Christ gross Darkness settling upon the Earth they should be a new day for us indeed doing it just the way he does it but turn to his word and see the Promise that's promised for this day and you'll know whether you're living in daylight or not changing the calendar doesn't change the time it only changes the calendar this is for us 2023. right for us it's January 1st 2023. that's for us for God he already turned the calendar it's the same it is the rising of the Sun it is the new day it is beyond the darkness of denominations it is the newness of life it is the resurrection of the Bright Tree the restoration of the Bright Tree it is all of those things to God he's already turned the calendar and we need to live in that time not keep flipping calendars saying one day someday maybe so many times we hear things like maybe in 2023 maybe in 2024 Maybe why don't we just walk in the day only we just walk in the light why don't we just accept the new day amen whatever I don't care what time it is on our calendar it's the same time on God's calendar and if there's a time that the atoms will change it's an appointed time amen so it's not going to matter where I flip the calendar or what I think 2023 maybe 2024. all we're doing is we're building an anticipation for a future event which is going to be wonderful but I don't want to be sitting on my haunches all the time anticipating a future event I want to be walking in the light of a new day I want to be experiencing the change in time the dispensation that I'm in I want to be in the bride age connected to the bridegroom enjoying my freedom and relationship not constantly deferring deferring deferring because all it does is build disappointment after disappointment after disappointment say I thought something would happen in 2022 nothing happened I thought something would happen listen the greatest thing that could ever happen to you has happened and what has happened is going to take us to the next happening amen he's here amen the bridegroom is here amen the the what the church is along for what what prophets have longed to see for thousands of years is what we see amen what they've longed to know is what we know the confusion of the church ages where they cannot see the light of the hour we've been given eyes to see and an eyes have to clear our eyes to where now we see the day that we're living in and what's going on and we're not making silly comments like amen someday amen someday he'll come and take me away he's here taking me away he's I'm walking with him he's walking me out of here amen Revelation by Revelation Truth by truth he's changing me into his very likeness amen I'm becoming more like him every day and he it's he who's carrying me out of here he has come to take me home so what's he doing he's taking me home amen I want to enjoy the day that I'm living in and I want to get the full benefit from the day that I'm living in and say God help me brother Benham said he made the statement I'm going to refer to this because I've heard it a few times here recently and and brother Brandon made the statement that laodicean church age would be a short age it'd be a short quick work and I haven't went back to look at all the quotes I've just heard people say it and say it was the shortest age of all it'll be a short age and we know that so far Ephesus has been the shortest stage is that right 117 years well if we make it past the first week of April this year we will have crossed 117 years is that right and the question is what will happen to multitudes of people if we get through 2023 and what they're looking forward to happening doesn't happen [Music] brother Branham said laodicea would be a short quick work would be the shortest age but brother Branham said the prophet would come at the End of the Age right not in the middle of the age does that make sense because if we take the ministry of 1963 and you start 1906 and you go to 2022 he would have come in the middle of the age but brother rest says over and over and over he comes at the end of the age to open up a new day open up a new age open up a new way so is laodicean continuing on yes for the church not for the bride for the bride it was the shortest age for the elect it was the shortest age for the elect it is over I hope that nobody crosses that threshold and said oh it's been 117 years now we've crossed that oh my maybe the prophet was wrong maybe he had a wrong prediction my goodness let the word open our understanding give us I Salve to see what day we're in he's already turned that calendar Fred I'm not waiting for him to turn that counter he's already turned that calendar I have already by his grace escaped the laodicean church age and been brought in by him to the age of Grace to the bright age through a marriage through a union with the headship of Christ don't let any of those things bother you even a tiny bit God is on and frankly I don't know what God will do we may take a translation before I think it's April 6th or April 9th we may take a translation before that I'd be happy with that but I wouldn't be surprised if God lets it go on beyond that just to wake people up to where we are where are we if he said that and we're here what does it mean amen it begs the question it's a question that God needs to answer and I say thank God for me he's answered it by revelation praise be to God and I may be a little wrong in the dates I didn't go back and look it up I've just heard it I haven't even went back to look at the quotes I just know these things you've heard them for years but don't let them bother you friends in fact if that date whatever it is comes and goes and we sail on by and and now from 1906 to whatever date we're in ends up being beyond the time that was allocated to Ephesus you can smile and whistle and walk down the road and say I'm in a new day amen that day already happened for me amen it happened when I realized that I am not allowed to sin amen I'm not in the Pentecostal age but I'm his bride been raptured into his bride age [Music] then there's no trouble that will enter your mind for God has been so good to lay his Secrets out but do it in a way only the elect will catch brother man says in God's word calls for total separation from unbelief says as I preached to you Sunday the great Symphony of God's word being beat out the changes injunctions is only God Changing Times like the director in the symphony when we see these changes of Ages and changes of times look down on the sheet here and you'll find out where we're supposed to be here you look at the Bible to find out where we're supposed to be if we read our Bible and we match it with brother branham's Ministry in the end time events you recognize that we've come through the first three chapters we've come through chapter 4 chapter 5 chapter 6 chapter 10. you start to look at this and you can say well where am I well I can find myself in Revelation 10 8 to 11. I can find myself over in revelation 22 17 in the spirit and the bride say come I can find myself there and when the prophet says she'll be the final voice to the final age what the spirit and the message and the bride will all be saying the same thing what they'll be saying has already been said in the word come out from among her and be ye separate where do I find that I find that in Revelation 10 17 and 18 I find it in Revelations 22 17. one is when the messenger declares it in the 18th chapter of Revelations and in the 22nd chapter of Revelations is when the bride declares it so where are we at the end of the book where in the end of the book chapter 22 the very last chapter of the book where are we bride at the end what are we doing we're calling for those to come out come out from among her and be separate it's the bride call ing the bride out of systems out of man's doctrines out of denomination out of church ages to be United with Christ the spirit and the bride are calling come where do we find ourselves Beyond so many things that people are looking for to happen they're happening now in the bride and people walk by you at work and don't have a clue what's going on in that stable I have no idea who that boy is walking down the road Jesus was walking maybe I don't know what he was doing maybe carrying a book maybe going to school maybe going to fetch something for Joseph maybe he was going down and he had to go get something and he gets it and he's thinking all the way there thinking all the way back and he's walking past tons of people who have no idea who he is he's the revelation of the mystery that's been in God's mind since before the foundations were and they don't know who he is but just the same you walk down the road and people don't know who you are or what's going on inside of you what is it it's a dispensational change where did it change in you where is it going on in you and I that's the same place where the kingdom of God is in you people walk by and where's the kingdom of God where's the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is here it's in you but it's it's the presence of God unrecognized but everyone says and God's only provide a place of worship he says now think these men why was they called and was put in the in this condition these Pharisees by Jesus in vain you worship me worship Him genuine worship true worship from their hearts in vain you worship me why teaching for doctrine of traditions and Men therefore you make the Commandments of God of no effect to the people if I taught you Methodist message it would take no effect on you this is bride time if Moses taught the message of Noah it would take no effect if Jesus taught Moses message it would take no effect because the predestinated seed or laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that's given for that seed it won't grow any other condition it must be the condition that grows it Pentecostal Doctrine will not grow the seed Lutheran Doctrine Methodist Doctrine it will not grow the seed Episcopalian Doctrine Catholic that will not grow that seed there's only one thing and that's the word for this day because this is pride time what time is it on God's calendar I can tell you it's bride time what time is the day bride time which is what it's synonymous with Rapture time synonymous within time it's all of that goes together synonymous with the coming of the Lord bride time coming of the lord The Rapture the end time it all goes together and that's this time and I thank God that I can be alive in this time so we turn the calendar that might mean something for doctor's appointments and for graduations and for years spent in school and years of employment but for me the calendar's already turned and I'm in the new day I'm still in the new day and I will be in this new day for eternity the only thing that's going to change is my atoms and I'll take a translation but I have United with Christ by his grace he has presented himself and unveiled himself to me and put inside of me a heart that says you're the one I want and I surrender to you 've come into that Union by his grace and for me this is the day this is the only day this is the great church Age The Eternal Church age at the end of the seven Church ages and by Grace the door in Heaven's been opened he's drawn me to him God bless you let's all stand we just thank God musicians if you'll come brother Blake if you'll come once you see the difference between the church age and the bride age the question is who in the world wants to be in the church age when you see the when you see in Revelation chapter 3 what he says about the latest in church age who in the world wants to be in the late Asian Church when you see all that the prophet says about it who wants to be there let's just cross that bridge to a new day a door's been opened a calendar page has been turned and for us it's the greatest thing that has happened in our lives the greatest privilege is to be alive in this time many prophets and righteous men have longed to see your day and have not seen it but blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for you here you saw the type of Ahab and Jezebel you saw Elijah you saw how did you see it by the grace of God you saw it multitudes can't see it multitudes can't see Ahab and Jezebel system backing up and Elijah the prophet and the sin at the same time but for you it is obvious as obvious can be why because it's given to you to see I'm so thankful we think about all the times of pastimes and all the great events that have taken place and but but brother Venom said the greatest time is this time this is the greatest time and this is the time that he's allowed you and I to live and I I want to say this is the day that the Lord has made and I will rejoice and be glad do we want to take a translation yes of course we do I mean we want to get out of these Fallen bodies absolutely we do but I am so thankful for the new light of the new day I'm so grateful I'm not trapped in denominationalism I'm so thankful I'm not bound in the chains of false understanding I am so grateful to be here I want to worship him in the light of a new day with all of my heart I want to dedicate it to him and give him my whole life because he's worth his power heads Lord Jesus we thank you for this God it is it is remarkable to us what you've done in our day it's overwhelming sometimes when we think about the consequences of what it is you've done what it means what does it mean when Paul says lo we turn to the Gentiles what did that mean it meant everything it was a change Lord that that that brought a change to thousands hundreds of thousands millions of individuals when Paul said Lord turned to the Gentiles something that seems so simple in human mind a a short conversation in a one city one event but oh God it was you Changing Times and God there's things that happen in this day to multitudes they don't recognize it it seems small and insignificant but for us it's everything Lord you've changed the times again the dispensations have changed the church age dispensation for your bride is over the door to Heaven has been opened the the bride age is accessible now again God I pray you'd help us Lord to move from the carnal and to the spiritual Lord help us to be liberated from the carnal from carnal understanding and carnal life help us to be liberated into a spiritual life Lord into a union with you Lord I pray you'd bring your children to yourself in this hour God give I saav for those who have not yet seen that they might see and give us greater ice staff those who have seen we want to see more clearly Lord wash away all of the wrong understanding wash away all of the hang on Lord move it away from us that we might see this day in the full light that is available in this day keep revealing and unveiling yourself to us for we love it Lord and God as we walk in this new day let us be bright and Shining lights in this world that we won't be so consumed with ourselves and our own thoughts and our own desires that will miss Lord that you are here shining through your bride and that we might be vessels that you can light the world through you can show yourself through us may we never hold that back from the world and never hold that back from the people but maybe Let It Shine Lord well we love you we thank you for what you've done I pray you to help us Lord to remain solidly in the bright age to leave the church age and move Lord across the bridge into the changing of dispensation and help us to remain there Lord and get all the benefits there help us to worship you correctly in that place for that's where your name is now we love you God we ask for your blessings over all we do bless us in this new year I know for you Lord you don't count time the same way do we do but for us it's a significant transition in time it's a Time Lord where we think about the last year and projecting to the Future year but God we know that our times are in your hands and you've ordained the steps that will take the works that we'll do you've ordained the weeks months years that will remain on this Earth so we want to start this year off by saying We Trust You Lord first of all we love you and we thank you for where you've placed us we're so grateful Lord and whatever comes next I Trust You Lord for you have prepared Us in the opening of your word for everything that we will face Lord May every obstacle become a chance to shine may all trials and tribulations be overcome by your word and faith in your word may you shine yourself Lord present in your bride through every obstacle that shall meet for God we're trusting in you we're staying our hand keeping it in yours trusting as we walk forward to what is to us is unknown but to you is clearly known so we put our hand in yours and with joy in our heart we walk as a child walking with his father knowing that you know the way help us Lord bless us in this coming year may we do more for you than we've ever done before we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen the Sun is up up now I can go
