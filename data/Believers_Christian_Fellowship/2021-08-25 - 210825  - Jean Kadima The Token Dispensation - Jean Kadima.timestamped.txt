[7:46] to you
[7:47] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[7:50] pray
[7:51] amen
[7:53] thank you musicians
[7:55] uh we're going to go straight to the
[7:57] world i think
[8:01] don't you just love the lord
[8:04] amen amen
[8:08] so
[8:10] we're going to
[8:13] to the book
[8:14] of
[8:15] exodus
[8:16] chapter 3.
[8:18] we can have our
[8:23] projector
[8:29] exodus chapter
[8:31] 3 verse 7
[8:39] and the lord said
[8:42] i have surely seen the affliction of my
[8:45] people which are in egypt
[8:48] and
[8:49] i've heard the cry by reason of their
[8:52] task masters
[8:54] for i know their sorrows
[8:57] and i'm come down to deliver them out of
[9:00] the hand of the egyptians and to bring
[9:03] them up
[9:04] out of the land and to a good land and a
[9:07] large onto a land flowing with milk and
[9:11] honey
[9:12] onto the place of the canaanites the
[9:14] high tides
[9:15] amorites and parasites and hervites
[9:20] and the jebusites
[9:22] verse 9
[9:24] now
[9:25] therefore behold the cry of the children
[9:28] of israel is come unto me
[9:31] i have also seen the oppression where
[9:34] with the egyptians
[9:36] oppress them
[9:38] come now
[9:40] therefore and i will send thee
[9:42] unto pharaoh that that might
[9:45] bring forth my people
[9:48] the
[9:48] the children of israel out of egypt may
[9:52] god add his blessing to the reading of
[9:54] the word you may take your seats
[10:00] tonight i have a
[10:02] small thought
[10:05] when he was given to me
[10:08] by the lord
[10:10] it was powerful
[10:12] but now the challenge is to translate it
[10:15] to transmit it to you
[10:20] i thought that god send to preachers the
[10:24] message for themself a first
[10:27] so that
[10:28] they can digest it
[10:31] and then if god opens weight and they
[10:33] can share with other people
[10:38] but
[10:39] tonight i have the message that i will
[10:41] call
[10:43] the token dispensation
[10:48] the token dispensation you know what is
[10:50] the token
[10:52] brother branham say he was one of the
[10:54] highlights of his ministry
[10:57] so in the message the token is saying
[11:00] this um
[11:02] today it's not the chemical
[11:05] blood of the lord jesus our our land but
[11:09] it's the life that was in the blood
[11:12] which is the holy ghost
[11:14] it comes back and is the token that we
[11:17] have accepted and did exactly what god
[11:20] told us to do
[11:23] and then by having the token we are
[11:26] identified with our sacrifice perfectly
[11:30] i don't see how anything more could be
[11:32] any plainer see
[11:35] so
[11:36] this is just a little introduction
[11:39] so
[11:40] to remind you that
[11:44] in the old testament
[11:49] people used to give a sacrifice of
[11:51] animals
[11:53] but the prophets say that the sacrifice
[11:56] of animal became just a routine
[11:59] and people were used to it
[12:03] and
[12:04] the life that was in the animal will not
[12:08] come back to the human being
[12:12] because the blood is not the chemical
[12:14] product
[12:16] the blood is actually
[12:20] the life
[12:21] that is in the blood that comes back to
[12:24] the human being
[12:27] are you with me
[12:30] so
[12:31] just that is simple uh introduction to
[12:34] this and let's see how the lord is lead
[12:38] will lead us tonight
[12:41] so
[12:42] i just want to take that
[12:46] subject of the token not the subject of
[12:49] the token but
[12:51] looking at that period of time and call
[12:54] it a a token
[12:56] dispensation
[12:58] meaning things that happening during
[13:01] that uh
[13:02] season of time
[13:04] so i'm drawing
[13:06] a parallel
[13:08] i'm drawing a parallel between moses
[13:11] time
[13:12] and this time you and i are living in
[13:16] amen
[13:17] so
[13:18] the blood at the door posts
[13:22] uh the door
[13:24] post should have a blood apply on them
[13:30] and
[13:31] this is what they
[13:33] uh
[13:35] this is what the uh the
[13:38] the message ex
[13:40] exodus 37 says
[13:49] exodus 3 7 and the lord said i have
[13:53] surely
[13:55] seen the affliction of my people which
[13:59] are in egypt and have heard the cry by
[14:03] reason of their task masters
[14:06] for i know their sorrows
[14:08] and i am calm down to deliver them out
[14:11] of the hand
[14:13] of the egyptians and to bring them up
[14:16] out of that land onto a good land
[14:19] and the large
[14:22] am i there yeah thank you brother
[14:26] and i come down to deliver them out of
[14:29] the hand of egyptian to bring them out
[14:32] the land onto a good land in the lodge
[14:35] onto a land flowing with milk and honey
[14:38] unto the place of the canaanite
[14:41] so there was a time where
[14:46] the task masters
[14:50] were
[14:51] making
[14:52] the children of israel suffer
[14:55] and they cry out to the lord
[14:59] they cry out to
[15:01] to him
[15:02] to deliver them
[15:05] but there was always the there was
[15:07] before that there was a time of
[15:10] silence the time of talents
[15:15] until god say
[15:17] i know
[15:19] what they're going through
[15:23] i know their sorrows i know their pain
[15:27] i have come down
[15:29] to deliver them
[15:31] and moses
[15:33] go now
[15:38] when we see a prophet coming on earth
[15:45] it means just god has come down
[15:49] amen
[15:52] when
[15:53] a the word is made flesh
[15:58] and come on earth it means god
[16:01] has
[16:02] come
[16:04] are you with me
[16:06] and when god comes
[16:10] he has a representative on earth
[16:15] and moses was that representative on
[16:19] earth
[16:21] and god when he sent a representative on
[16:24] earth god actually has come
[16:30] and your mission at that point is to go
[16:34] and preach the word
[16:38] are you with me
[16:41] so
[16:43] when we see a prophet
[16:47] on earth it means god has come down
[16:53] but the prophet is the word in the flesh
[16:56] is that right
[16:58] therefore if we see also the word
[17:04] made flesh small world here made flesh
[17:08] it means also god has come down
[17:17] during 400 years
[17:21] maybe 400 or more or less
[17:28] there was a silence
[17:31] israel was suffering
[17:35] they were going through a different
[17:38] situations and
[17:41] things were not really good
[17:46] then
[17:48] at some point god says uh i'm going to
[17:52] send you moses
[17:55] but before that there was complete
[17:58] silence let me just say to you that
[18:03] this silence
[18:05] is almost a requirement
[18:09] are you with me
[18:13] the silence that
[18:15] when you are in a great need and you
[18:19] don't hear about the lord
[18:21] that silence is like a requirement for
[18:25] god
[18:26] is like something that has to take place
[18:30] so god can
[18:31] test our faith is that right
[18:35] and that silence is not
[18:37] uh for
[18:39] uh for you only
[18:42] but it's also for me
[18:44] is for the preacher
[18:46] is for the pastor
[18:48] is even for the prophet himself
[18:53] therefore brother burnham says that
[18:55] don't think
[18:58] don't think that
[19:00] i get it easy
[19:03] he say actually
[19:05] for me
[19:06] is really hard
[19:09] he said i will pray for you but when it
[19:12] comes to my case
[19:17] i actually sweat
[19:21] i actually suffered to get somewhere
[19:25] let me illustrate that to some with
[19:27] something
[19:30] one day they
[19:32] brother branham was with his son
[19:36] in a hunting trip
[19:39] and as it was in the hunting trip his
[19:41] son
[19:43] had a fever
[19:46] and headaches maybe
[19:49] and brother branham remove his hat
[19:54] and
[19:55] pray silently for his son
[19:58] and instantly i will say
[20:02] billy paul get healed
[20:05] brother branham say that
[20:08] billy paul
[20:09] you were sick i just pray for you
[20:13] and
[20:13] look
[20:15] you are healed
[20:16] but look at my
[20:18] foot
[20:19] he showed billy for his foot it was
[20:22] swelling
[20:24] and he said to him
[20:26] that
[20:27] the gift
[20:28] is not just for me it's not for me the
[20:32] gift is for the people
[20:38] so
[20:39] so it doesn't matter
[20:41] if he's a preacher
[20:43] or is a prophet
[20:45] uh
[20:47] we all go through a time
[20:50] where god says that uh
[20:52] um there must be a silence
[20:56] but a silence doesn't mean
[20:59] that god
[21:02] it does not know
[21:04] because you can see here
[21:08] in
[21:10] in the message
[21:21] the bridge between the seven church ages
[21:24] and the seals
[21:26] that the way in prayer for the sick
[21:29] until you can find the cause
[21:32] you say i know the cure but i have got
[21:35] to find the code
[21:38] that's why
[21:40] the
[21:41] visions are so needed and prominent
[21:44] it reveals the secret of the heart
[21:47] tells the person where you made your
[21:49] mistake and what to do
[21:52] see no matter how much medicine you take
[21:55] and how much oil you put on their head
[21:58] and how loud anything would
[22:02] stream
[22:04] over you
[22:05] if there is something wrong he will lay
[22:08] right here
[22:10] i say he
[22:11] that satan
[22:14] so
[22:18] even when there is a silence from the
[22:21] lord
[22:23] there is still be is an answer from him
[22:29] and that answer from him can be
[22:33] i know what you're going through
[22:35] i know where the masters
[22:39] the task masters are doing to you
[22:43] i know what you're going through
[22:46] but
[22:57] my goodness
[23:01] well
[23:03] let's pray
[23:07] precious heavenly father
[23:12] i don't know what the enemy want to do
[23:14] right now
[23:16] it has been very very hard
[23:19] today
[23:20] to get here
[23:22] and he has messed up everything and
[23:28] i just ask you to come down in your
[23:31] power of resurrection
[23:33] and just
[23:35] be with me at this moment take control
[23:38] of all the situation as i commit myself
[23:41] to you in jesus christ's name amen
[23:54] where i'm going is uh i wanted to
[23:57] introduce
[24:00] this subject
[24:02] of
[24:09] the exodus
[24:11] where
[24:21] the children of god
[24:23] in egypt
[24:26] they were
[24:27] in
[24:28] such a pain
[24:30] and god sent a prophet
[24:33] and say
[24:34] i have heard the cries
[24:37] i seen the situation they are going
[24:39] through
[24:40] and i have come down moses i'm sending
[24:44] you
[24:45] go
[24:59] um this morning when i went to i came to
[25:03] i was home
[25:05] there was so many things that were
[25:07] happening
[25:09] my house floated
[25:12] my
[25:17] people the plumber could not come and
[25:20] everything and i just knew that okay
[25:23] this is a battle
[25:25] that i need to just keep going and i
[25:29] abandon everything i just came
[25:31] to
[25:32] the church
[25:33] but now
[25:34] when my notes get lost and then i become
[25:37] just so uh confused
[25:40] but
[25:41] bear with me
[25:44] okay now
[25:45] um
[25:47] i'm making a parallel i'm drawing
[25:50] parallel between
[25:53] the time of moses and the time that
[25:56] we're living in
[26:00] mo and i'm going to use the actors
[26:04] uh
[26:05] interchangeably
[26:07] i'm going to use
[26:09] moses in the same time that will use
[26:12] brother branham
[26:13] i can use moses like i can use you
[26:17] the word
[26:18] made flesh in this time
[26:22] so uh
[26:25] moses was
[26:27] fearful when god called him
[26:30] so he was fearful
[26:33] because moses did not understand
[26:37] why
[26:38] a man like him can go after a great
[26:42] denomination called egypt
[26:48] so
[26:50] he
[26:51] say to the lord you know i cannot talk
[26:54] and you know my limitations how can i go
[26:58] and take on
[27:00] the uh this great system this great
[27:04] denomination called egypt
[27:09] so between
[27:11] 1946
[27:13] to 1940 54
[27:17] moses
[27:18] started preaching
[27:21] the mess a small message because he was
[27:24] fearful
[27:27] of the system
[27:30] therefore he started preaching about
[27:32] salvation faith and divine healing
[27:38] those
[27:39] subjects
[27:41] people
[27:43] agree a little bit on them so it was
[27:46] easy for him
[27:48] to go to egypt the big system and speak
[27:53] to them because moses was
[27:56] fearful to take on the system
[28:00] but you know taking on the system is not
[28:04] easy
[28:06] when are you taking you take on the
[28:10] system
[28:11] they will come out after you
[28:15] therefore moses was saying i'm just a
[28:17] simple man how can i take this system
[28:22] but god said to him
[28:24] go with the first pole and the second
[28:27] pole
[28:29] demonstrate the healing
[28:32] demonstrate the uh the discernment
[28:37] but it will be abate
[28:41] so moses goes with the demonstration
[28:46] of that gift
[28:49] and
[28:51] the people received the nomination
[28:54] received it but that was not the calling
[28:58] for moses
[29:02] moses
[29:04] decided that
[29:06] between 1946 to 1954
[29:10] that this is how is going to handle it
[29:15] because
[29:16] egypt
[29:18] is so powerful
[29:20] but moses has to
[29:23] actually tell
[29:25] the this system that let my people go
[29:31] are you with me
[29:34] moses takes on the system
[29:37] between 1954
[29:40] and 1962
[29:43] where he say
[29:44] let my people come out of these systems
[29:50] well it's not easy when you go after the
[29:53] system they go after you
[29:56] they destroy your reputation
[30:01] they go seriously after you
[30:06] but
[30:07] moses has decided by the branham
[30:10] in 1954
[30:13] that
[30:14] is not good enough
[30:17] to just
[30:18] have this uh
[30:20] uh
[30:21] this uh
[30:23] this
[30:24] uh
[30:25] messages
[30:27] and uh this salvation healing
[30:31] the time
[30:32] has to come so that i can preach
[30:36] actually the message that will free
[30:39] people from the system
[30:42] and you can this
[30:44] so you will see the prophet will say for
[30:47] example
[30:48] that i have a friend in all the
[30:51] nominations
[30:54] is that right
[30:57] they're all good men
[31:01] but it's the system that binds them
[31:09] so i will say to brother brandon and
[31:10] brother branham
[31:13] if the system is what is wrong but the
[31:17] people are good
[31:19] let them change the system
[31:24] uh let uh
[31:25] let's change the system let's make the
[31:27] system
[31:29] what let's reform the system
[31:33] no
[31:34] the system is not just an abstract
[31:38] object
[31:39] that you can change
[31:42] this system is a spirit
[31:46] and that spirit
[31:49] if you want to trace it you got to go
[31:52] back to the beginning
[31:54] then you will find a system because
[31:57] everything that started to begin in
[32:00] genesis
[32:01] so it's not something that you can say
[32:05] oh listen
[32:06] uh
[32:07] this is
[32:08] you know let's just change them
[32:11] no
[32:12] you
[32:12] you have to deal with a system therefore
[32:17] moses work was not to reform the system
[32:21] was actually his
[32:24] work
[32:25] was actually to free people from this
[32:29] this system
[32:31] take them out and call the people out of
[32:34] the systems
[32:36] but when you do that
[32:38] you will have the system coming after
[32:42] you
[32:44] they will not just take it back that way
[32:47] they will come after you
[32:52] and they will do what is called in
[32:55] then a smart people will call it a
[32:57] projection
[33:00] so
[33:01] uh
[33:02] in the message three witness 1951
[33:07] but i'm saying that you know the first
[33:09] thing is the word of god
[33:11] that first
[33:13] that's where everything uh
[33:16] should be reverent when the word is
[33:18] going forth and then
[33:21] he ran to the platform he say um
[33:25] so
[33:25] this is this is brother brandon i'm
[33:27] talking about the oregon man
[33:30] the maniac of oregon
[33:33] who uh
[33:34] who attacked brother branham as he was
[33:37] preaching
[33:39] so this man comes to brother branham
[33:42] is attacking him but is not the man is
[33:46] the spirit
[33:48] why does he attack him it's because
[33:51] brother branham wants to get people out
[33:54] of the system and the system is the
[33:56] spirit
[34:00] and then
[34:01] the man goes and runs at the the
[34:04] platform and
[34:07] this is what how it calls brother
[34:09] brenner it calls him
[34:12] hypocrite
[34:15] who is hypocrite brother branham or this
[34:18] man
[34:20] the spirit in the man but look what he's
[34:23] doing is projecting what is in him into
[34:27] brother branham
[34:29] and today it could be the same thing
[34:32] for you and i
[34:34] if we stand for the word
[34:37] we carry in the word
[34:39] then the system can attack us
[34:45] is that right
[34:46] and they can project the very thing that
[34:49] they do
[34:50] to us
[34:53] and he will say you hypocrite
[34:56] you snake in the grace who was the snake
[34:59] was it brother branham or was the spirit
[35:02] that was in this man
[35:06] are you with me
[35:07] he said i will show you how much of a
[35:10] man of god you are
[35:12] i will show you are not even a man of
[35:14] god
[35:16] is projecting projecting the thing that
[35:21] he is
[35:23] into the other person
[35:25] he said i will break every bone in your
[35:29] body
[35:31] who does not have bones in his body
[35:36] is the snake
[35:38] is the serpent
[35:39] but yet is saying that
[35:42] brother branham i will break all your
[35:44] bones you will not have any bone
[35:48] the serpent is calling brother branham
[35:50] serpent
[35:52] are you with me
[35:54] so
[35:55] and that's what's gonna happen
[35:58] if you go after the system
[36:02] the system is not a church the system is
[36:06] a spirit
[36:08] and that spirit will attack anyone who's
[36:12] carrying the world
[36:14] just like an air ball
[36:17] was attacked
[36:19] because it was carrying the world
[36:22] when you cannot
[36:26] attack the word you attack the person
[36:29] that carries that word
[36:34] is that right
[36:36] that's right
[36:38] then
[36:39] i just assure you that
[36:41] um brother branham for eight years
[36:46] it does not want to touch
[36:48] this uh
[36:50] system
[36:53] it's fearful
[36:55] but
[36:58] on one day
[36:59] uh eight years after that
[37:02] he said
[37:03] something is not working
[37:06] i need to start preaching the word
[37:10] so we don't have any record
[37:13] that he had a vision
[37:16] we don't have any record
[37:18] that god spoke to him
[37:21] that go after the system
[37:24] but when god called a prophet on earth
[37:28] when the world is manifested on earth
[37:33] the world will go
[37:36] the word will go because when god called
[37:40] the word
[37:41] it is to go and prophesy
[37:44] because
[37:45] when
[37:46] god speaks
[37:48] who
[37:49] but prof will prophesy
[37:53] and
[37:54] that's what we see
[37:56] that brother branham after being
[37:58] reluctant for eight years he finally
[38:02] decided that i'm going after the system
[38:09] now
[38:11] the system doesn't let him
[38:13] but
[38:14] he will
[38:16] because his mission is not to reform the
[38:19] system but his mission is to get the
[38:23] children of is israel
[38:25] out of egypt
[38:27] out of the system
[38:30] because he will never reform
[38:34] cain will never
[38:36] repent and change
[38:43] now in the message the reproach for the
[38:44] cause of the word
[38:49] and sometime in the night i dreamed a
[38:51] dream
[38:53] and in this dream i seen some someone
[38:56] that was supposed to be my father
[38:59] a great and
[39:01] huge man just representing
[39:04] figuratively speaking my father
[39:07] i seen a woman did not know like my
[39:10] mother but yet she was supposed to be my
[39:13] mother and this man that was supposed to
[39:16] be like the father the husband of this
[39:19] woman was clearly
[39:21] mistreating her in so much that he had a
[39:25] great chunk of hood
[39:28] now
[39:29] eight years after brother branham
[39:33] start preaching the word
[39:37] god was silent
[39:40] but
[39:41] eight years after
[39:43] he sees a dream
[39:45] a man
[39:47] who's supposed to be his father
[39:50] is hitting a woman that is supposed to
[39:53] be his mother
[39:54] but is not
[39:56] and
[39:58] he would hold her up like this and
[40:01] strike her with the chunk of hood and
[40:04] she will fall out and go down
[40:07] then
[40:08] after a while she would get up again and
[40:12] he would walk around take a notion to
[40:15] strike her again he would strike her
[40:18] again and i was standing off at a
[40:21] distance watching it finally
[40:24] i just get
[40:26] get fed up on it
[40:28] and i was away smaller than this man was
[40:31] supposed to be like my father
[40:34] you know the story
[40:36] this man that looked like brother
[40:38] branham father is the nomination
[40:42] it's the system
[40:44] and this woman that looks like
[40:47] his mother
[40:49] is the church
[40:52] and brother branham look how this man
[40:55] was mistreating this woman
[40:59] he got fed up
[41:01] he started by being fearful
[41:04] now he saying that's too much
[41:07] now
[41:08] he says so i walked up uh to him
[41:12] and put my finger in his face
[41:15] i said
[41:16] don't strike her again see and when i
[41:19] did something begin to happen my arms
[41:23] begin to pulsate and i got great big
[41:27] brawny muscles i never seen such muscle
[41:31] i just took the man by the caller and i
[41:34] say don't strike her again
[41:37] i if you do you will have to deal with
[41:40] me if you strike her again
[41:43] and the man got scared of me and left
[41:46] her alone and i woke up
[41:50] i want to just
[41:51] make a small comment on this that
[41:55] brother branham taking on the system was
[41:58] not
[41:59] easy but his muscles become stronger and
[42:03] then he went after them anyway but all
[42:07] this is not god telling him go do this
[42:11] but it was just a burden in him that i
[42:14] gotta take this system there is
[42:17] something
[42:18] wrong here
[42:20] i need to preach to bring the gospel to
[42:23] them
[42:24] but now
[42:26] you see god did not say a word for eight
[42:30] years
[42:32] it didn't say anything
[42:34] as it is laboring for eight years god
[42:37] did not say anything
[42:39] but and then at the end of the eight
[42:42] years then god said to him
[42:46] and give him the dream and say you went
[42:49] after the system
[42:52] and god
[42:55] by showing is the dream
[42:58] it was actually showing him that
[43:00] i like what you did
[43:02] i liked the fight you took on
[43:05] but it was not an instant
[43:08] gratification
[43:09] is that right and sometimes when we work
[43:13] when we
[43:14] do some work for the lord
[43:17] we expect him to
[43:19] to to give us
[43:21] our
[43:23] you know reward right there but this one
[43:26] took eight years
[43:30] without god said a word
[43:33] but it doesn't mean all the labor that
[43:35] you labor god does not see it
[43:39] god sees everything that we do for for
[43:42] his glory
[43:44] yeah
[43:46] so
[43:47] what happened is a life
[43:51] this is this is
[43:53] what happened is
[43:55] life
[43:57] that just
[44:00] when the prophet goes now
[44:03] to egypt
[44:05] to claim
[44:07] it goes to egypt to attack the system
[44:11] is taking the life out of the system
[44:16] meaning that
[44:17] uh
[44:18] egypt
[44:20] when egypt used to have life
[44:24] you know
[44:27] he used to have life
[44:29] now god takes his people
[44:31] outside of egypt
[44:34] this system that is pentecostal whatever
[44:38] system
[44:39] they used to have life
[44:42] judas
[44:43] one day
[44:45] judas
[44:46] edified me
[44:49] one day
[44:50] judas
[44:51] ah
[44:52] say something that was good but why did
[44:55] he
[44:56] stop
[44:58] right
[45:02] life just left the
[45:04] system
[45:06] in 1963
[45:09] moses
[45:10] indicts
[45:12] indicts the denomination and turns
[45:16] his attention
[45:18] to the bride
[45:21] darkness falls on egypt
[45:25] is that right
[45:28] darkness falls on egypt and
[45:31] the laodicea age
[45:33] is over
[45:35] darkness falls on egypt
[45:40] because
[45:42] there was a time where
[45:44] moses was going back and forth
[45:49] to see the pharaoh
[45:51] and come back
[45:53] to see the pharaoh and come back there
[45:56] was a back and forth but then one day in
[46:00] 1963
[46:02] he injects the nomination
[46:06] and say to them i indict you for
[46:08] crucified jesus christ for the second
[46:11] time
[46:12] and then it turned his attention
[46:16] to the bride
[46:21] then the darkness falls into egypt
[46:26] and
[46:27] laodicea is over
[46:31] now
[46:32] all this i was trying to
[46:36] to show you
[46:38] that
[46:44] when they did
[46:51] when moses was going to the system to
[46:54] speak to them to
[46:57] to uh
[46:59] to speak to them to demonstrate the
[47:02] power of god
[47:06] there was a back and forth between moses
[47:10] and
[47:11] and
[47:12] and
[47:13] and pharaoh
[47:17] grace was still there
[47:20] are you with me
[47:24] there was still grace because
[47:27] moses was going to speak to pharaoh and
[47:31] come back and pharaoh will will
[47:34] never like what moses is saying and
[47:38] moses will go back and forth and one day
[47:43] darkness falls on egypt
[47:47] and it is
[47:50] over are you with me
[47:58] now
[48:01] technically
[48:06] when we look at egypt we will say that
[48:09] egypt is total in total darkness is that
[48:12] right
[48:16] and this
[48:18] love this age is over is that right
[48:26] but
[48:30] i want to show that this is a
[48:33] overlapping
[48:36] time
[48:38] i want to show you that
[48:40] the darkness fall in egypt
[48:44] if the darkness fall in
[48:46] egypt it means that the laodicea age is
[48:51] over
[48:54] it means that the darkness is covering
[48:56] egypt
[48:59] if darkness is covering egypt therefore
[49:02] allow this age is over
[49:05] but in reality
[49:07] technically only the laodicea age is
[49:10] over
[49:12] because the goshen
[49:15] is technically
[49:17] in
[49:18] egypt
[49:21] are you with me church
[49:39] let's just read it
[49:41] a god hiding in simplicity
[49:48] you say the graves will open
[49:51] the dead shall walk out
[49:54] that may be true but not open the way
[49:58] you say the open that's right
[50:00] it won't be like that
[50:03] okay it will be a secret because he said
[50:06] it will come like a thief in the night
[50:09] he has already told us the rapture then
[50:13] judgment will strike
[50:14] sin flags and sin sickness and
[50:17] everything
[50:19] and people will cry for death to take
[50:21] them
[50:22] when the judgment lord
[50:25] why is this judgment upon us when you
[50:28] say that
[50:29] there will be a rapture first it will
[50:31] say i already come and you did not know
[50:34] see god hiding himself in simplicity oh
[50:38] my all right that's all
[50:41] already happened
[50:42] you knew it not why don't
[50:45] believers believe the simple sign of is
[50:49] coming
[50:52] so
[50:58] i was trying to draw a parallel between
[51:02] what is happening in egypt
[51:05] and what is happening in our time
[51:08] in egypt
[51:12] the
[51:13] judgment strikes egypt
[51:17] as the judgment strike egypt
[51:20] it looks like there is no more time no
[51:23] no more grace time is that right
[51:26] and there is no
[51:29] so there is a judgment
[51:31] and the whole
[51:33] uh the world is now on the judgment but
[51:37] where is uh
[51:39] where is the bride
[51:41] right now where is the bride
[51:43] and we it turns out that the bride is in
[51:46] negotiation
[51:48] all right
[51:49] so
[51:50] and i'm putting a parallel with what
[51:55] is going on
[51:56] on this side of
[51:59] the world
[52:04] when the prophet spoke to the
[52:06] denomination
[52:09] and indect them
[52:11] and with a judgment
[52:16] at that point god turned
[52:18] and went to the bride
[52:22] and
[52:23] we can see
[52:26] that uh
[52:28] we can see that at that
[52:30] point the
[52:33] uh the the the seals get open
[52:38] and
[52:39] when the seals get broken
[52:42] the the lamp comes down
[52:45] with the book in his hands
[52:48] and the fact that the book is in the end
[52:52] of the lamb
[52:54] it means that the throne
[52:57] is full with smoke
[53:03] are you with me
[53:05] bear with me
[53:06] i i don't know why
[53:08] i'm struggling
[53:10] so
[53:13] the
[53:15] if the throne if the lamb takes the book
[53:19] it means that the throne of mercy is now
[53:23] full with smoke
[53:25] is that
[53:26] right and if the smoke is in that the
[53:31] throne
[53:32] it means that there is no grace anywhere
[53:39] now that's where people get really
[53:42] scared
[53:44] because how can
[53:46] be that be
[53:48] that the throne
[53:50] is open
[53:52] and
[53:53] i mean
[53:54] how can that be that god has uh
[53:58] uh
[53:59] take the book and if he takes the book
[54:01] it means
[54:03] there is no
[54:04] salvation anymore
[54:06] that's why people
[54:08] thinking but that's not the truth
[54:12] it doesn't mean
[54:14] the throne when it is uh
[54:17] is
[54:18] open
[54:20] the it say it doesn't mean
[54:24] there is no salvation anymore
[54:31] it doesn't mean there is no salvation
[54:34] but it just doesn't mean
[54:37] oh my goodness
[54:58] let me go back again
[55:00] what i'm trying to to to show is that
[55:08] there is an overlap
[55:10] between what is happening in egypt
[55:15] there is an overlap between what is
[55:18] happening in egypt
[55:21] the the entire egypt is under the
[55:25] darkness
[55:27] it's under the judgment
[55:30] but in reality a
[55:33] small portion of egypt
[55:37] is not in the darkness
[55:40] and that is goshen
[55:42] the confusion that people
[55:45] usually have
[55:47] that when you start talking about
[55:50] the lamp text the book
[55:54] they feel like you have started new
[55:56] doctrines
[55:58] and that new doctrine
[56:00] is to say that there is no more grace
[56:04] in this time
[56:07] but the reality is the grace is still
[56:11] applied in the goshen
[56:13] [Music]
[56:14] the rest of the world is in a darkness
[56:18] but it doesn't mean there is no
[56:21] grace
[56:22] it doesn't mean there is no blood
[56:26] so the blood is still in goshen because
[56:30] the people have
[56:33] put the blood on the post of the doors
[56:38] for the
[56:39] grace is still in
[56:42] goshen in the same time grace is not so
[56:46] basically grace is not in egypt
[56:50] grace is
[56:52] is not in egypt
[56:54] all right
[56:56] but the grace is in egypt
[57:01] are you with me
[57:06] grace is not in egypt but is in egypt
[57:11] because
[57:14] goshen belongs to egypt anyway
[57:21] so
[57:23] and that's the biggest point i'm trying
[57:26] to make here
[57:29] i'm trying to say this
[57:33] ah
[57:40] so
[57:41] is it the time of grace we're living in
[57:43] yes is the time of grace
[57:46] is it the time of judgment we're living
[57:48] in
[57:49] yes it's a time of judgment
[57:52] is this the time of judgment
[57:55] and time of grace
[57:58] overlapping
[58:03] grace is there
[58:06] but judgment is there too
[58:11] amen
[58:24] overlapping
[58:28] goshen is in egypt technically
[58:32] goshen
[58:33] is in laodicea
[58:36] technically goshen
[58:39] is in egypt
[58:41] therefore when we say that
[58:45] we are
[58:46] not in laodicea
[58:49] we are in laodicea or we are not in
[58:52] laodicea
[58:56] are we or are we not
[59:00] we are
[59:02] in uh
[59:05] in egypt technically
[59:08] therefore the bride is technically in
[59:10] laodicea
[59:13] the bride is not in laodicea because
[59:16] she's in the goshen
[59:18] and goshen is a position in christ
[59:23] goshen is not a location
[59:26] but goshen is a position
[59:31] both coexist
[59:33] we are in lao this year
[59:36] and we are not in love odyssey
[59:40] it depends on what
[59:43] where you placing everything is that
[59:46] right
[59:50] and that goes with everything that i'm
[59:53] talking about
[59:55] same thing with the blood
[59:57] when moses got the children of israel
[1:00:01] from egypt
[1:00:02] there was no blood in egypt
[1:00:06] well there was blood in egypt
[1:00:09] because there was blood in goshen
[1:00:13] grace and judgment
[1:00:16] coexist
[1:00:18] it's now depend on what side are you in
[1:00:24] what side
[1:00:25] are you in
[1:00:27] because the grace and judgment both
[1:00:31] exist
[1:00:35] and this is what happened in the token
[1:00:39] dispensation
[1:00:43] are we
[1:00:44] in a time of judgment
[1:00:50] yes we are in the time of judgment
[1:00:52] because the lion
[1:00:54] of the tribe of judah
[1:00:57] has shown up up there
[1:01:00] is that right
[1:01:02] no
[1:01:03] we can say we are not in the time of
[1:01:06] judgment
[1:01:09] because we still have access to the
[1:01:12] blood
[1:01:14] so the blood is still with us
[1:01:18] but it is in goshen
[1:01:22] with the bride
[1:01:25] is that right
[1:01:26] so the blood is with
[1:01:28] the bride
[1:01:31] and his negotiation
[1:01:33] so if you want the blood
[1:01:35] you can say
[1:01:37] are we in a time of judgment i would say
[1:01:40] yes
[1:01:41] because the darkness is everywhere in
[1:01:44] egypt
[1:01:46] the darkness is is now laodicea
[1:01:50] it's a total chaos
[1:01:54] but yet there is a group of people
[1:01:58] that still have access to that blood
[1:02:01] they still have access to the light
[1:02:06] so therefore the two are
[1:02:09] co-existing
[1:02:11] is that right
[1:02:21] hi god hiding in simplicity
[1:02:24] you say the graves will open
[1:02:28] the dead shall walk out
[1:02:32] that may be true but open
[1:02:36] the way
[1:02:37] but not open the way you say open see
[1:02:40] that's right see
[1:02:41] it won't be like that
[1:02:43] it's a secret because it say it will
[1:02:46] come like a chief in the night it has
[1:02:49] already told us this the rapture then
[1:02:52] judgment will strike and sins and
[1:02:54] plagues and
[1:02:56] sickness and everything
[1:02:58] what is happening here is
[1:03:04] what is happening here is
[1:03:08] brother branham after preaching on the
[1:03:10] seals
[1:03:13] what he's saying here is like
[1:03:16] when you hear that the graves will open
[1:03:20] and the dead will walk out
[1:03:24] it's not actually the way
[1:03:27] you think about it
[1:03:29] because god does not need to open grief
[1:03:33] he can just speak
[1:03:36] the your body is made of some element
[1:03:40] and god can just
[1:03:43] gather all these elements together
[1:03:46] and you will live again
[1:03:49] now
[1:03:51] but what he is is showing here is that
[1:03:58] coming out the graves
[1:04:02] it's a secret
[1:04:04] what are the graves
[1:04:09] it's the systems
[1:04:12] the systems
[1:04:13] bury people they are cemeteries
[1:04:17] therefore before this body change
[1:04:21] god has also to
[1:04:24] uh
[1:04:27] take us
[1:04:29] from the graves of the system
[1:04:32] therefore the
[1:04:33] doors of the graves will have to open
[1:04:39] and you will have to go out
[1:04:43] before the the physical change in the
[1:04:46] body
[1:04:48] there is a spiritual
[1:04:52] a spiritual coming out
[1:04:56] of the graves
[1:04:59] so these things are
[1:05:01] that
[1:05:02] sometimes they get people confused
[1:05:05] and it makes us look like
[1:05:09] we bring out some doctrine somewhere
[1:05:14] but in reality
[1:05:16] the graves opening
[1:05:19] is us coming out of that system
[1:05:24] that binds people
[1:05:28] is a system of denomination
[1:05:31] it is not an organization an abstract
[1:05:36] organization
[1:05:38] but is actually
[1:05:40] a spirit
[1:05:42] and god
[1:05:44] through the secret of gathering us
[1:05:48] together he sent a prophet and the
[1:05:51] mission of that prophet was to get us
[1:05:53] out of the system
[1:05:56] that's what moses did he was to get us
[1:06:00] out of that system of egypt
[1:06:04] and once we they were out of
[1:06:07] the system
[1:06:09] death
[1:06:10] was in egypt
[1:06:11] in other words
[1:06:13] egypt was a cemetery
[1:06:17] and we
[1:06:20] have come out of the system
[1:06:23] the system now are dead
[1:06:25] therefore we can be disappointed
[1:06:29] and say this brother
[1:06:31] edified me
[1:06:33] sometime in the past
[1:06:36] this brother was great
[1:06:39] but
[1:06:40] the thing is where is he now
[1:06:44] so you've got to continue with the light
[1:06:49] if you don't continue with the light
[1:06:52] then
[1:06:54] you become a borderline christian
[1:06:58] then you may have edified me in the past
[1:07:02] but i cannot be looking in the past
[1:07:04] because looking in the past
[1:07:06] is a frog spirit
[1:07:15] right
[1:07:17] and the one of the greatest
[1:07:20] mystery that the prophet
[1:07:23] revealed to us in this time
[1:07:25] is the
[1:07:26] borderline christianity
[1:07:30] and it's all happening during the
[1:07:33] dispensation of the token the token
[1:07:35] dispensation
[1:07:37] this still token dispensation is a
[1:07:39] dispensation where
[1:07:42] life is being displayed
[1:07:46] but life has to be inside
[1:07:49] so that life can be displayed
[1:07:53] okay
[1:07:56] but the life comes only
[1:07:59] through the world
[1:08:00] is that right
[1:08:02] but if you stop getting the word where
[1:08:05] will the life come from come from
[1:08:18] and people we continue reading
[1:08:21] and people cry for death to take them
[1:08:24] when the judgment load why is this
[1:08:27] judgment upon us when you say that there
[1:08:30] will be a rapture first it would say
[1:08:34] it's already come you did not know it
[1:08:37] see god hiding
[1:08:40] himself in simplicity oh my all right
[1:08:43] that's all that's already happened
[1:08:46] you knew it not
[1:08:48] why don't believers believe the simple
[1:08:51] signs of his coming
[1:08:54] that's what sometimes we dealing with
[1:08:58] it's uh
[1:09:00] believers don't believe that he is here
[1:09:05] when you see the world in the flesh
[1:09:09] you know that god is here
[1:09:12] when you see a prophet like moses you
[1:09:15] know that god is here
[1:09:18] but people cannot get
[1:09:21] receive this simple
[1:09:24] signs of is coming or is
[1:09:28] presence
[1:09:30] how can they expect coming out of the
[1:09:33] graves
[1:09:36] because the purpose is you come out of
[1:09:39] the graves and then you got a body
[1:09:42] change and you go home
[1:09:45] but if you have not see is coming how
[1:09:49] can you expect
[1:09:53] how can you expect a body change
[1:09:58] are you with me
[1:10:02] amen
[1:10:05] now
[1:10:08] it will start making sense
[1:10:11] the devil
[1:10:13] is defeated
[1:10:14] anyhow
[1:10:18] okay i'm going to this is my note when i
[1:10:22] say don't do the following
[1:10:26] we will see the following
[1:10:30] because why don't you do it because god
[1:10:33] hates it
[1:10:34] that's it very simple
[1:10:36] don't do this because god hates it
[1:10:41] and don't do what
[1:10:43] christ is the reveal revealed in his
[1:10:46] word on word 1965
[1:10:50] now
[1:10:52] you must not
[1:10:54] misinterpret
[1:10:56] interpret the word
[1:11:02] you say well i believe it means this
[1:11:05] it means just what it says
[1:11:09] it needs no
[1:11:10] interpreter
[1:11:12] and you must not misplace the word
[1:11:16] and you must not dislocate the word
[1:11:20] and if we will do either of these
[1:11:24] it throws the whole bible in confusion
[1:11:26] and in a chaos
[1:11:30] are you with me
[1:11:32] now the thing is when god
[1:11:35] when the prophet say don't do this
[1:11:41] it means god hates it
[1:11:44] that's why you don't do it
[1:11:47] god does not like it
[1:11:50] and when god hates
[1:11:52] something it means
[1:11:56] you got to trace it back to the
[1:11:59] beginning
[1:12:05] mo
[1:12:06] most
[1:12:07] more
[1:12:08] most likely
[1:12:10] whatever god hates
[1:12:13] can be traced back to
[1:12:15] genesis
[1:12:17] are you with me
[1:12:21] let me show you something that god hates
[1:12:26] because he hates
[1:12:28] misinterpretation of his word
[1:12:30] he hates when he's been misplaced
[1:12:35] any hate when is dislocated
[1:12:39] and there is when god say that i hate
[1:12:42] these things
[1:12:43] you can trace it back to genesis
[1:12:47] to the beginning proverbs 6
[1:12:50] 16
[1:12:51] say this
[1:12:52] this sixth thing that the lord hate
[1:12:56] yeah
[1:12:57] seven are in
[1:12:59] an abomination unto him
[1:13:03] god hates a proud look
[1:13:07] a lying tongue
[1:13:10] hands that shed
[1:13:12] innocent blood
[1:13:13] and heart that devises
[1:13:16] wicked imaginations
[1:13:19] fit that be swift in running to mischief
[1:13:22] a false witness that speaketh lie
[1:13:26] and he thus soweth discord among
[1:13:29] brethren
[1:13:31] god hate it will always hate it
[1:13:35] but if you want to trace it back go to
[1:13:38] the beginning
[1:13:40] are you with me
[1:13:42] now let's go one by one
[1:13:47] god
[1:13:48] hate a proud look
[1:13:53] the proud look
[1:13:55] lucifer did not
[1:13:57] know humility
[1:14:00] and god hate it
[1:14:02] it will not like he did not like it then
[1:14:05] he doesn't like it now
[1:14:09] lucifer did not know what is humility he
[1:14:12] could ask you what are you talking about
[1:14:18] because in his mind is
[1:14:20] i will ascend
[1:14:23] i will
[1:14:24] be worshipped by the sons of god
[1:14:27] i will
[1:14:28] i will
[1:14:32] it does not know humility
[1:14:34] but you ever ask yourself
[1:14:38] few the future was not in his hands
[1:14:42] why did he always say i will ascend
[1:14:47] i will do this
[1:14:49] i will do that
[1:14:51] when the future is not in his end
[1:14:54] you can see the same thing in his
[1:14:56] daughter
[1:14:58] jezebel
[1:14:59] she will say
[1:15:01] i will give you the nabbert vignette
[1:15:06] i will kill
[1:15:09] elijah
[1:15:11] let the god treat me
[1:15:13] severely if i don't destroy elijah
[1:15:18] i will but i will doesn't belong to you
[1:15:22] it is in god's hands how can you say i
[1:15:25] will
[1:15:29] are you with me
[1:15:30] if lucifer i don't want to sound
[1:15:33] sacrilegious
[1:15:35] but let me just say if he
[1:15:37] had
[1:15:38] say one small word that we will say
[1:15:44] god will
[1:15:46] god willing
[1:15:48] i will ascend
[1:15:50] it will just change everything
[1:15:53] because you cannot say
[1:15:56] god willing
[1:15:58] i will destroy your life
[1:16:06] i say i could sound sacrilegious right
[1:16:09] but it's true if you say god willing i
[1:16:12] will destroy your
[1:16:14] no
[1:16:17] but he cannot say
[1:16:19] i
[1:16:20] cannot say that
[1:16:24] it will say
[1:16:26] um
[1:16:27] i'm going to take
[1:16:28] nabbit
[1:16:30] field and give it to you i will ascend
[1:16:34] i will destroy elijah and
[1:16:38] the toxicality
[1:16:40] she was so toxic that even a prophet a
[1:16:44] minister
[1:16:46] was depressed that he wanted to commit
[1:16:48] suicide
[1:16:50] oh you say brother he want to commit
[1:16:53] suicide yes
[1:16:54] he said to god take me
[1:16:57] the attack the environment was so toxic
[1:17:01] that he just said god i want to die
[1:17:06] you see the power that this uh the
[1:17:09] spirit had
[1:17:11] and god said i don't like the proud look
[1:17:14] i don't like lying tongues remember
[1:17:18] lying tongues
[1:17:20] the tail of lies
[1:17:22] that start up there
[1:17:26] with the angels
[1:17:29] and that same tale came down
[1:17:32] and told the eve
[1:17:35] are you with me
[1:17:36] and lied to her
[1:17:38] introducing light death in this world
[1:17:42] god say this there are six things
[1:17:47] seven things that i hate in all seven
[1:17:51] ages
[1:17:53] shedding
[1:17:54] uh a lime tongue
[1:17:57] shed innocent blood
[1:18:01] kill the man
[1:18:03] who has the word
[1:18:06] that's what he did
[1:18:08] he shed the blood he killed a cain
[1:18:12] he was bearing the word he killed the
[1:18:16] word
[1:18:17] in the flesh
[1:18:20] the heart that the device wicked
[1:18:23] imaginations like i say wicked
[1:18:26] imagination i will ascend i will do this
[1:18:30] basically i'm tracing back
[1:18:35] i'm tracing back
[1:18:39] the thing that god hates
[1:18:42] in the beginning
[1:18:43] in genesis you can find them
[1:18:47] when god say i hate something he didn't
[1:18:49] start hating it now he hated it
[1:18:52] long time ago he hated at the beginning
[1:18:56] the feet that be swift in running to
[1:18:59] mischief
[1:19:01] the feet that be swift in running to
[1:19:04] mischief
[1:19:06] mischief is the iniquity god said to the
[1:19:10] cain
[1:19:11] you like your brother but what did he do
[1:19:14] it is the country of what god asked him
[1:19:18] knowing what to do did not do it god
[1:19:22] hated
[1:19:24] during all the seven ages
[1:19:27] false witness that speaketh life
[1:19:30] lies
[1:19:32] false witness that speaketh lies
[1:19:36] you see
[1:19:38] false witness that will speak lies
[1:19:41] against those who carrying the word of
[1:19:44] god
[1:19:46] destroying the word in the flesh
[1:19:51] the last one is
[1:19:53] sold
[1:19:55] they so discord
[1:19:59] seed of discrepancy
[1:20:02] that cause divisions
[1:20:05] you see divisions will come anyhow
[1:20:08] but the division is not always because
[1:20:12] something happened here and there
[1:20:15] but it's happening because the fourth
[1:20:18] seed is planted
[1:20:20] and you and i cannot take it
[1:20:24] and then that cause division no matter
[1:20:28] how people want to be together
[1:20:31] if the seed the word of god is not
[1:20:34] what is being planted
[1:20:37] therefore what's going to happen
[1:20:39] is there will be divisions
[1:20:42] amen no now now let's go back
[1:20:45] to
[1:20:48] christ is revealed in his own word
[1:20:54] now you must not misinterpret the word
[1:20:59] you say well i believe it means this
[1:21:05] it means just what it means it says
[1:21:08] it needs no interpreter
[1:21:10] and you must not misplace the word
[1:21:13] and you must not dislocate the word
[1:21:16] and if you would do either of this
[1:21:19] it throws the whole bible in confusion
[1:21:22] and in chaos
[1:21:25] now
[1:21:26] in terms of
[1:21:28] in term of
[1:21:30] misinterpret the word
[1:21:34] the prophet is showing us here
[1:21:38] that
[1:21:41] i will just read the highlight
[1:21:44] the prophet indicted this age because
[1:21:48] they crucified the very word
[1:21:51] and says it's for another age
[1:21:56] that's a problem no now let me say this
[1:22:01] don't miss
[1:22:02] misinterpret the word
[1:22:06] don't
[1:22:08] uh displace it
[1:22:12] and don't
[1:22:14] dislocate it
[1:22:16] it's not like
[1:22:18] we
[1:22:19] everything that we say
[1:22:22] everything that we preach
[1:22:26] must be
[1:22:27] exact exactly
[1:22:30] to our knowledge
[1:22:32] it can be like that
[1:22:34] but that's not really what this means
[1:22:38] to me this means
[1:22:41] that the
[1:22:42] uh
[1:22:43] the inspiration
[1:22:48] behind the word
[1:22:50] the inspiration that
[1:22:53] misinterpret the word
[1:22:57] that inspiration
[1:22:59] is false
[1:23:02] and if the inspiration is false
[1:23:05] it's because
[1:23:08] he wants to plant a seed
[1:23:13] and that seed is a seed of discrepancy
[1:23:18] so that's why when god say i hate
[1:23:22] misinterpret my word
[1:23:25] it doesn't just mean
[1:23:27] a honest mistake
[1:23:29] but it means there is an inspiration
[1:23:33] behind that interpretation
[1:23:36] take a man like brother banana was
[1:23:38] saying a man say
[1:23:40] from now on
[1:23:42] he was a preacher
[1:23:44] a bishop
[1:23:46] we're going to be getting in a church
[1:23:48] with a rhythm of rock and roll as we're
[1:23:51] getting in the church
[1:23:53] we go in the rhythm of rock and roll
[1:23:56] it's
[1:23:57] and this this will maybe this will
[1:23:59] please god this man is not just a
[1:24:02] misinterpret the word
[1:24:06] he is inspired to
[1:24:09] plant a seed
[1:24:12] so it's not just a honest mistake is a
[1:24:15] seed that is going to plant and he knows
[1:24:19] the result the devil knows the result
[1:24:21] will be devastating
[1:24:25] in the same way
[1:24:27] if somebody does not understand the word
[1:24:30] and says
[1:24:32] that
[1:24:33] this
[1:24:34] word
[1:24:36] must happen after the rapture
[1:24:39] they say it because they don't
[1:24:41] understand
[1:24:44] it's okay
[1:24:45] somehow god will correct it
[1:24:48] but if they deny and close their eyes
[1:24:52] and say there is no sun let me go into
[1:24:55] the basement and hide myself because
[1:24:57] there is no sun out there
[1:25:00] and they say that um
[1:25:03] well well well um the lamb will take the
[1:25:07] book after the rapture
[1:25:10] after the reject reject everything
[1:25:12] because it comes from you
[1:25:15] then they say the lamb will take the
[1:25:17] book after the rapture
[1:25:22] they are planting some seed that is a
[1:25:25] discrepancy
[1:25:27] and god hated
[1:25:29] because you take the word of today you
[1:25:32] placing it tomorrow if the lamp takes
[1:25:35] the book and the redemption takes place
[1:25:38] after the rapture
[1:25:41] when will the sons and
[1:25:44] endurers of god manifested
[1:25:48] when will be
[1:25:50] you know
[1:25:51] the opening of the world and the the
[1:25:56] third pool manifestation where god
[1:26:00] life the token life the talk the
[1:26:04] dispensation
[1:26:06] age will be manifested if you say
[1:26:09] that the lamp does not take the book
[1:26:11] because if it takes the book then the
[1:26:13] throne will be full with smokes
[1:26:17] but
[1:26:18] because you afraid
[1:26:21] that if
[1:26:23] the throne has smoked
[1:26:25] therefore it means there is no more
[1:26:28] salvation there is no more grace that's
[1:26:31] an interpretation
[1:26:35] that's not what the word says
[1:26:39] because actually the word says that
[1:26:42] christ
[1:26:44] remain
[1:26:45] uh
[1:26:46] interceding
[1:26:49] because of the ignorance of the people
[1:26:55] okay christ remain at the throne
[1:26:58] interceding for the ignorance of the
[1:27:01] time of luther the top of john wesley
[1:27:06] christ has to remain there intercede
[1:27:10] because of the time of ignorance
[1:27:14] then we come at the end of the time
[1:27:17] where the mysteries are open there is no
[1:27:20] more ignorance
[1:27:23] are you even there is no more ignorance
[1:27:26] christ takes the book okay
[1:27:28] now there is a smoke in uh on the throne
[1:27:31] well let it be
[1:27:34] or do you mean there is no more grace
[1:27:36] yes there is grace
[1:27:38] i'm here
[1:27:43] are you with me
[1:27:45] so they say oh there is no more grace if
[1:27:48] you say that you mean that uh well there
[1:27:51] is no blood and on the throne
[1:27:53] the judgment is here so you mean that
[1:27:56] nobody can be saved i didn't say that i
[1:28:00] just say what he said
[1:28:03] if my notes were in the right order i
[1:28:05] would have read him
[1:28:08] i just say what he said
[1:28:12] so do you mean that
[1:28:17] since there is no blood so grace is over
[1:28:21] well for some
[1:28:24] uh for others
[1:28:25] grace is still there
[1:28:28] are you with me there is gaussian
[1:28:32] a technically gaussian is in egypt
[1:28:36] so both grace in
[1:28:38] goshen
[1:28:39] and judgment in egypt they coexist
[1:28:46] is that right
[1:28:50] yeah
[1:28:51] so god hate i'm so sorry to take your
[1:28:54] time
[1:28:55] but you saw how it's a struggle
[1:29:05] i'm gonna just
[1:29:09] now
[1:29:13] whatever is saying this
[1:29:17] he's saying
[1:29:19] ah
[1:29:20] let me see
[1:29:21] okay
[1:29:23] god be blessed in endactment god be
[1:29:26] blessed for saying this wonderful
[1:29:28] heavenly light in this last day
[1:29:30] because the church is god doing the same
[1:29:33] thing today until the hour that
[1:29:36] organization
[1:29:37] religion is condemned and proved to be
[1:29:40] sacrificing
[1:29:42] christ's word
[1:29:43] from then on comes the word and the word
[1:29:47] only
[1:29:49] from the all the pascal
[1:29:52] lamb passed away and christ became our
[1:29:55] lamb at the day of the crucifixion and
[1:29:59] the day that the denomination crucified
[1:30:02] the word of god and accepted a creed in
[1:30:06] instead of the word that the day the
[1:30:08] world come into full effect that just
[1:30:12] recently
[1:30:15] just recently
[1:30:17] when the system
[1:30:19] reject the word
[1:30:21] then the word has and they accept a
[1:30:24] creed
[1:30:26] instead of the word that the day the
[1:30:29] word came into full effect
[1:30:32] that happened at the opening of the
[1:30:36] seals
[1:30:37] recently
[1:30:39] accepting a creed
[1:30:42] instead of the word
[1:30:44] is called
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:46] it is a uh
[1:30:49] misplacing the word
[1:30:53] you must not misplace the word don't put
[1:30:56] it you know misplacing the word is uh
[1:30:59] putting it in the wrong spot
[1:31:04] the wrong
[1:31:05] age the wrong time
[1:31:08] now
[1:31:12] christ is revealed
[1:31:15] in his own word now you must not
[1:31:17] misinterpret the word
[1:31:20] and then he goes and show that dislocate
[1:31:24] the word
[1:31:25] i put it in the blue here
[1:31:28] three things that god doesn't want us to
[1:31:31] do
[1:31:32] dislocate means
[1:31:34] it has something to do with the body
[1:31:39] dislocate your shoulder
[1:31:42] is that right
[1:31:44] dislocate a portion of your body
[1:31:48] that dislocating
[1:31:51] and dislocate
[1:31:53] is
[1:31:55] when
[1:31:56] a person says that
[1:31:59] this portion of the body does not apply
[1:32:02] for example
[1:32:03] the head has not come
[1:32:09] if the head has not come when will the
[1:32:12] head come well after the rapture then
[1:32:14] christ will come in the rapture when the
[1:32:18] body is changed
[1:32:19] well you mean the the head is not here
[1:32:24] you mean the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:32:27] that we saw in the cloud
[1:32:30] is nowhere to be found
[1:32:32] so if you say that you just dislocate
[1:32:37] the
[1:32:38] body
[1:32:39] so it means the body is a monster
[1:32:44] is all right
[1:32:45] the body is a monster without the head
[1:32:49] but you never
[1:32:51] do such a thing
[1:32:56] and god
[1:32:58] hates it
[1:33:00] because the body is here the problem
[1:33:02] with us is we don't want to
[1:33:05] to let the world
[1:33:07] speak
[1:33:08] itself
[1:33:10] we
[1:33:11] we see the consequence
[1:33:14] of
[1:33:15] letting the word say what he said
[1:33:18] rather than going to the lord and say
[1:33:21] i don't understand it
[1:33:24] so what should i do
[1:33:26] what we do is actually
[1:33:29] we
[1:33:30] fight it
[1:33:32] because
[1:33:34] if i accept it
[1:33:36] the consequence is like if i say the
[1:33:40] the head has come
[1:33:42] the lion has come
[1:33:44] it means we're living in a judgment
[1:33:48] so well where is the throne of grace
[1:33:52] well what is the throne of grace if this
[1:33:56] was your chest i will say this is your
[1:33:59] throne of grace
[1:34:01] here
[1:34:03] are you with me
[1:34:05] the throne of grace has moved
[1:34:09] from
[1:34:11] christ
[1:34:13] to
[1:34:14] the human heart
[1:34:17] brother that
[1:34:19] um
[1:34:21] a metaphor or
[1:34:24] is not literal
[1:34:26] well it's not literal
[1:34:28] where did the prophet say it's not
[1:34:30] literal
[1:34:31] that
[1:34:32] the the throne of mercy is in the heart
[1:34:36] of human being where did he say
[1:34:39] is not literal
[1:34:41] because if
[1:34:42] god is in the flesh
[1:34:47] god is in the flesh here here here here
[1:34:49] and there and each heart has the throne
[1:34:52] of mercy think about
[1:34:55] all of us
[1:34:58] having the throne of mercy that's a big
[1:35:01] throne of mercy
[1:35:04] we should live things the way god say
[1:35:07] that
[1:35:09] we should not try to because as we're
[1:35:11] doing that we will dislocate this
[1:35:14] dislocate that me place this on the
[1:35:17] other a age if you are an accountant
[1:35:20] don't misplace a comma
[1:35:25] well if you do do it in my favor
[1:35:35] now church
[1:35:36] i say all this
[1:35:38] to come to this
[1:35:40] balance between standing in the truth
[1:35:43] and being condescending
[1:35:47] we must stay
[1:35:49] in truth
[1:35:50] with the truth
[1:35:52] not just be with it but
[1:35:55] live it because that's the token
[1:35:57] dispensation
[1:36:00] but we have to hit the right balance
[1:36:04] by standing in the truth and being
[1:36:07] condescending
[1:36:10] so
[1:36:11] in other words
[1:36:13] you can't help it
[1:36:15] to upset someone if you stand in the
[1:36:18] truth
[1:36:21] i remember my daughter saying that one
[1:36:23] day she went doing her
[1:36:26] internship
[1:36:28] you know
[1:36:29] internship
[1:36:32] in nursing
[1:36:34] and as she dresses the way she dress
[1:36:37] every time
[1:36:38] a woman look at her and say
[1:36:44] you're judging me right
[1:36:48] how
[1:36:50] you're judging me right
[1:36:54] well
[1:36:55] she was wearing maybe those calling or
[1:36:58] calling to whatever
[1:37:00] those those things you know they were
[1:37:02] today they kind of naked
[1:37:05] but
[1:37:07] she's saying
[1:37:10] you are judging me even though my
[1:37:12] daughter did not say a word
[1:37:14] did not
[1:37:16] do any gesture
[1:37:19] do not say anything he said you're
[1:37:21] judging me
[1:37:22] [Music]
[1:37:26] but it's true
[1:37:28] is not
[1:37:29] her judging
[1:37:31] but it's the word inside
[1:37:35] that's judging the the other woman
[1:37:41] is that right
[1:37:42] but
[1:37:43] it should not come from us they
[1:37:46] when
[1:37:49] you wear the right clothes
[1:37:52] you know
[1:37:54] you
[1:37:55] have no makeup on you
[1:37:58] you keep your hair
[1:38:01] you don't have those high heels
[1:38:05] well if somebody
[1:38:08] who believe or doesn't believe the
[1:38:10] message
[1:38:13] think that you are judging her
[1:38:17] it's okay
[1:38:19] because that's what it is it's the word
[1:38:22] in you judging the other person
[1:38:26] but what we want to avoid because the
[1:38:30] token dispensation is display christ's
[1:38:33] life
[1:38:35] that's what it is
[1:38:37] is you displaying
[1:38:39] christ's life in a dying world
[1:38:44] therefore
[1:38:46] we need to have a good influence
[1:38:49] that we will not be accused of arrogancy
[1:38:53] because christ is not arrogant
[1:38:57] the seed of arrogancy is the uh cancer
[1:39:03] we display the token
[1:39:05] is the life of christ that we have
[1:39:08] received through the word
[1:39:10] the bloody world has a life
[1:39:13] and we display that life
[1:39:15] therefore let us
[1:39:17] influence with anybody denomination
[1:39:21] anybody that we know
[1:39:23] let's be
[1:39:25] humble enough that we can speak to these
[1:39:28] people with uh
[1:39:31] humility
[1:39:33] absolutely anybody with immunity that's
[1:39:37] the token that we display in this time
[1:39:41] if it is up to us
[1:39:43] let's do that
[1:39:45] are you with me can you give me a few
[1:39:47] minutes
[1:39:48] you all live in lima here right i'm the
[1:39:51] only one in cleveland right okay
[1:39:56] they
[1:39:57] this is what the prophet said in the
[1:39:58] seventh field the unbelievers can't
[1:40:00] believe it
[1:40:02] so now if anybody wants to argue about
[1:40:05] the serpent seed and things
[1:40:08] you try to show them they won't listen
[1:40:11] to it just walk away just leave them
[1:40:13] alone see don't god don't argue neither
[1:40:17] does is children
[1:40:21] it's very important because
[1:40:24] you know
[1:40:25] you
[1:40:26] that's not god brother branham approach
[1:40:30] whatever if he's find somebody who does
[1:40:32] not know the word
[1:40:34] what he does is is a finding a common
[1:40:37] ground
[1:40:39] something they can talk about
[1:40:41] and agree
[1:40:44] then
[1:40:45] if he sees an opening he can speak to
[1:40:47] that person
[1:40:49] is that right
[1:40:51] and let also find as god leads you
[1:40:55] find a common ground
[1:40:59] where you
[1:41:01] you talk to somebody who believes a
[1:41:03] portion of the word
[1:41:06] you agree with him in that portion
[1:41:11] make him at ease and don't
[1:41:14] try to show that i am up there
[1:41:17] you are down here
[1:41:19] it doesn't work and that's not the
[1:41:22] display of the token
[1:41:25] but don't you
[1:41:28] uh give in in
[1:41:30] that person belief
[1:41:35] this is a simple message right
[1:41:37] yeah
[1:41:38] but find the common ground and say yeah
[1:41:41] i agree with you on this i agree with
[1:41:43] you yeah yeah but god
[1:41:45] oh god has been wonderful with me to me
[1:41:49] i i get more from this
[1:41:52] there is more to it
[1:41:55] and i did not know there was more to
[1:41:58] this
[1:41:59] then i read i i heard by the man i'm
[1:42:02] talking about it there's more to it
[1:42:05] if the person is receptive that you are
[1:42:09] you own your brother sister
[1:42:12] but if they can see
[1:42:15] uh
[1:42:16] something that is not
[1:42:19] um you know something that is a little
[1:42:22] arrogant or whatever
[1:42:24] and
[1:42:25] uh
[1:42:27] it will not help
[1:42:29] and again i'm just saying that is a
[1:42:31] balance that you're trying to strike
[1:42:34] i'm not saying that you will
[1:42:37] necessarily succeed with everybody
[1:42:40] but again
[1:42:42] don't be accused of it because
[1:42:45] you are displaying life to the dying
[1:42:49] world
[1:42:50] therefore you don't display arrogancy to
[1:42:54] the dying world
[1:42:56] a way you can
[1:42:58] show that
[1:42:59] i am just like you my brother but i feel
[1:43:02] like god gave me something do you want
[1:43:04] to share
[1:43:05] and argument
[1:43:07] doesn't bring us anywhere because when
[1:43:11] we have argument i want to
[1:43:14] i want to stick with my position no
[1:43:16] matter what
[1:43:17] because the devil is already
[1:43:20] inside this
[1:43:22] now it's like them against us
[1:43:26] and it won't help anybody
[1:43:30] therefore
[1:43:31] it's better to find to see if the person
[1:43:34] is receptive or not
[1:43:37] but not go into the argument or the
[1:43:41] condescending
[1:43:44] no
[1:43:47] but remember
[1:43:49] the word
[1:43:51] came to you
[1:43:53] all right
[1:43:54] the word came to moses god sent him
[1:43:59] god
[1:44:00] is that right
[1:44:02] the word came to brother brennan
[1:44:05] god sending him after the this system
[1:44:09] that system
[1:44:11] is not just in group
[1:44:14] it's a spirit
[1:44:16] it's a spirit that is everywhere
[1:44:20] that's why you can see brother preaching
[1:44:23] the way of a true prophet in 1962
[1:44:27] you will see him blasting
[1:44:31] everything
[1:44:32] and everyone
[1:44:35] if you look with our natural eyes you
[1:44:37] will think it's blasting everything and
[1:44:41] everyone
[1:44:42] he goes to denomination and blasto
[1:44:45] he goes to
[1:44:47] the world they blast them the way people
[1:44:49] would rest today
[1:44:51] it goes everywhere but if you check well
[1:44:55] you will see that at one point it goes
[1:44:58] and blast himself
[1:45:02] he said god said to me you are not
[1:45:04] sincere
[1:45:07] therefore he was not blasting people
[1:45:10] he was not blasting
[1:45:12] himself it was blessing sins
[1:45:16] he was a blasting blessing unbelief
[1:45:23] are you with me
[1:45:24] and that's our work
[1:45:27] as our calling because the bride has
[1:45:31] received a uh
[1:45:34] a ministry her ministry is in revelation
[1:45:37] chapter 10
[1:45:39] verse 8 and 11.
[1:45:41] she has received the word she ate the
[1:45:44] word
[1:45:46] therefore to whom the word has come
[1:45:51] has become a small god
[1:45:54] to whom the word has come
[1:45:57] if the word comes to you it means god
[1:45:59] has come down
[1:46:01] and now i'm sending you to egypt i'm
[1:46:04] sending you to attack all this system
[1:46:07] that is contrary to the word of god
[1:46:11] every spirit
[1:46:12] in your house
[1:46:14] everywhere i'm sending you to destroy
[1:46:17] them
[1:46:19] go with it
[1:46:21] fearlessly
[1:46:23] don't have any fear to attack the system
[1:46:27] amen
[1:46:28] but
[1:46:30] don't be afraid to attack the system
[1:46:34] but the reality is when god sends you he
[1:46:38] say go and prophesy
[1:46:41] and what is a prophesy
[1:46:44] prophesy means preach
[1:46:48] amen
[1:46:49] now we have men and women i'm saying
[1:46:52] that
[1:46:54] if the word comes to you is for you to
[1:46:57] go and prophesy again
[1:47:00] and you say
[1:47:02] all of us yes prophets have been
[1:47:05] preached
[1:47:06] preached
[1:47:08] the life of christ
[1:47:10] meaning display
[1:47:13] the life of christ
[1:47:15] that's what it is it is a talking
[1:47:19] dispensation where everything
[1:47:22] overlap
[1:47:24] is everything seems to be overlapping
[1:47:28] grace and judgment
[1:47:30] blood
[1:47:31] and smoke and thunder
[1:47:34] they
[1:47:36] salvation
[1:47:38] and destruction here
[1:47:41] okay
[1:47:44] the lion
[1:47:45] the judge
[1:47:47] is here
[1:47:50] but yet
[1:47:52] we still claiming we are in a lower this
[1:47:54] year
[1:47:57] god count one to seven
[1:48:00] is that right
[1:48:02] and say the time will end at seven
[1:48:06] and god said time shall be no more
[1:48:10] it means seven
[1:48:13] shall be no more
[1:48:15] if seven shall be no more it means eight
[1:48:20] we're getting in eight
[1:48:22] a seven and eight
[1:48:24] i exist
[1:48:29] overlap
[1:48:29] [Applause]
[1:48:30] that's the only way i can see maybe
[1:48:32] better child would bring up
[1:48:34] another uh
[1:48:36] you know
[1:48:37] car uh light on it
[1:48:40] it's it's there
[1:48:42] because
[1:48:44] it's the end of the struggling world
[1:48:47] it's the end of the seven
[1:48:50] church ages
[1:48:51] it is the ushering into the eight days
[1:48:54] and ushering means you're getting
[1:48:57] introduced into it
[1:49:01] that's what it is
[1:49:02] and sometimes those things
[1:49:05] they get us a little uh
[1:49:08] afraid
[1:49:11] but
[1:49:12] it's just repeating it
[1:49:14] god will start opening as we're praying
[1:49:17] or we're looking at it god we start just
[1:49:20] opening the little by little uh all
[1:49:23] these things for us as we taking the
[1:49:27] word in
[1:49:30] the word
[1:49:32] start
[1:49:33] acting in us
[1:49:36] i remember one time
[1:49:39] many
[1:49:40] i would say many years ago
[1:49:43] praying
[1:49:44] and listening to the word maybe uh
[1:49:46] that's what i do as a routine
[1:49:50] presently
[1:49:53] and i was talking to god about things
[1:49:56] if i could remember he's like god i
[1:49:59] don't ask you about money
[1:50:02] i don't talk to you about
[1:50:04] jobs and money or
[1:50:06] things like that
[1:50:08] but i'm going through
[1:50:10] difficult times and things like that i'm
[1:50:12] praying i'm
[1:50:14] maybe i'm listening to the word and
[1:50:17] walking maybe distance and coming back
[1:50:21] i just realized that after that
[1:50:26] after that period
[1:50:28] i realizing i realized looking back
[1:50:32] there was something in my life that god
[1:50:34] did not like
[1:50:37] i don't know about you and that's not my
[1:50:39] subject actually but i want to just show
[1:50:41] you that when god
[1:50:43] comes down and give you the word
[1:50:47] is for you to be a preacher
[1:50:51] a preacher by living
[1:50:55] to display that token
[1:50:57] and here i am
[1:51:00] i am praying i'm maybe listening to the
[1:51:03] word and
[1:51:05] when i look back god has just taken
[1:51:08] something
[1:51:09] from me that i did not ask
[1:51:13] this is what the word does
[1:51:15] when it comes it comes with a power of
[1:51:18] transformation
[1:51:21] it comes
[1:51:22] and starts displaying something that you
[1:51:25] did not even know that you need
[1:51:29] and i did not know that god was not
[1:51:32] pleased by the time we spend with movies
[1:51:38] and sometimes it was oh
[1:51:41] this in true story movie
[1:51:45] i love those ones
[1:51:47] i i'm not talking about you and i don't
[1:51:50] know brother chad
[1:51:52] maybe he has not spoken about it and i
[1:51:54] just spent three years here so that's
[1:51:57] not my point my point is god did not
[1:51:59] like that from me okay and then
[1:52:04] i
[1:52:04] did not ask about it i didn't say god
[1:52:07] i'm suffering i
[1:52:10] i need to stop watching these things no
[1:52:14] it's
[1:52:15] i was praying for other things maybe
[1:52:18] spiritual maybe
[1:52:20] situation that
[1:52:22] i i was going through
[1:52:24] then suddenly god took the desire of
[1:52:27] those movies away from me
[1:52:30] right there
[1:52:32] it's gone
[1:52:33] i look back it's gone i don't watch them
[1:52:37] and i went to my family and apologized
[1:52:41] because i am the one who introduced that
[1:52:44] spirit in my house
[1:52:46] and it was like christmas get those
[1:52:49] movies
[1:52:51] yeah christmas time is the time we watch
[1:52:54] movies after movies
[1:52:59] that's that
[1:53:01] today what do we do
[1:53:03] in time like that we talk to each other
[1:53:06] hey
[1:53:07] what an innovation
[1:53:12] did he do
[1:53:14] it took it because the word reached the
[1:53:17] region where it was supposed to reach
[1:53:21] and that's how i can explain it the word
[1:53:24] comes you hear it every day it's the
[1:53:27] same word the same prince the same
[1:53:29] preacher and and but the word is doing
[1:53:32] something
[1:53:34] and
[1:53:34] this is a great experience because i did
[1:53:37] not ask about it i did not speak to the
[1:53:40] lord about it i just saw that it took it
[1:53:44] it was gone
[1:53:46] of course i'm in a flesh if i'd make
[1:53:48] another effort to go back my condition
[1:53:51] will be worse
[1:53:54] and this is the time we're talking about
[1:53:58] it's not the time
[1:54:01] for
[1:54:02] argument or something like that
[1:54:06] it's a time where we just
[1:54:09] get that life
[1:54:11] apply that token
[1:54:14] how apply it just receive the word of
[1:54:17] god and obey it
[1:54:20] and just obey and pray
[1:54:23] and
[1:54:24] listen
[1:54:26] read
[1:54:28] listen
[1:54:29] read your bible
[1:54:31] and
[1:54:32] see the life
[1:54:34] being displayed because there's so many
[1:54:36] things that
[1:54:37] is happening in this time and
[1:54:41] i don't understand everything
[1:54:44] but when the prophets say that the
[1:54:46] throne of mercy
[1:54:48] is in my heart
[1:54:49] why should i say no
[1:54:53] oh well if you say that
[1:54:55] if you say that it means okay if you say
[1:54:58] we are not in laodicea age it means
[1:55:02] um it means then
[1:55:05] then the bride
[1:55:08] there was no pride in our this year age
[1:55:12] who say that
[1:55:15] all right
[1:55:16] the bride is
[1:55:18] of the lao this year
[1:55:21] but god has called her higher
[1:55:24] okay hi where where
[1:55:27] there is only uh the seven ages where
[1:55:30] you to put her uh
[1:55:32] well
[1:55:34] higher
[1:55:36] what about goshen what about goshen
[1:55:39] it was egypt
[1:55:40] well goshen now is a position in christ
[1:55:44] goshen is not a physical location it's a
[1:55:48] position in christ
[1:55:53] now am i in love this year ah i am not
[1:55:57] you can stay there
[1:55:59] i can decide where i live
[1:56:05] are you with me church
[1:56:09] yes if god opened somebody open
[1:56:13] somebody to
[1:56:15] uh
[1:56:16] to receive it let them receive it if
[1:56:19] people don't receive it let us be
[1:56:22] fearless
[1:56:24] because when god called a prophet
[1:56:26] with the spirit of elijah is fearless
[1:56:32] are you with me we fearless and we have
[1:56:35] a mission with god comes in the flesh
[1:56:39] when the world is made flesh the word is
[1:56:42] sent to display
[1:56:45] god
[1:56:47] will
[1:56:48] in that time we are i call it a token
[1:56:53] a token
[1:56:55] dispensation because the token
[1:56:58] dispensation when i look at egypt there
[1:57:01] is such a a parallel
[1:57:05] between uh in between the age we're
[1:57:08] living in
[1:57:09] and egypt
[1:57:10] because it's the coexistence of it do
[1:57:13] you do you understand it or it's just me
[1:57:17] you understand it it's just everything
[1:57:19] is just
[1:57:20] together
[1:57:22] everything everything is together where
[1:57:25] is it life in
[1:57:26] egypt
[1:57:27] uh no because death is in egypt
[1:57:31] well life is in egypt too
[1:57:34] oh well in the ocean
[1:57:38] is it grace in egypt
[1:57:40] no grace is not egypt because it's all
[1:57:44] death
[1:57:45] no grace is in egypt because of goshen
[1:57:51] are you with me
[1:57:53] well are we in the seven church ages or
[1:57:56] we are already in eight
[1:57:59] well there is no eight but we are called
[1:58:01] higher higher yeah are you in love this
[1:58:04] tell me are you in love this year or not
[1:58:09] choose whatever you want
[1:58:11] me ah seven and eight they they just
[1:58:15] i don't know where i am i am a a uh
[1:58:19] what is that i am a person of uh
[1:58:24] i am a person that is in
[1:58:28] not in time
[1:58:33] but living in time
[1:58:36] i am a person of eternity but living in
[1:58:39] a time i am a person of eight but living
[1:58:41] in seven
[1:58:44] are you with me now
[1:58:47] seven is changing in eight if i was a
[1:58:50] teacher
[1:58:53] in your
[1:58:55] school here or for the kids
[1:58:58] i would give them a high time
[1:59:01] i will tell them transform seven into
[1:59:04] eight
[1:59:04] i wanna see
[1:59:07] oh i will tell them don't
[1:59:09] misplace the word i want you to draw me
[1:59:13] a cow
[1:59:15] on a tree
[1:59:18] that is eating what
[1:59:20] grass
[1:59:22] make that picture
[1:59:24] for me
[1:59:25] kids will find me weird
[1:59:32] church
[1:59:34] i appreciate you
[1:59:35] uh
[1:59:36] i mean
[1:59:37] i thank you for
[1:59:41] you see i wasted all my time the devil
[1:59:44] has attacked me a lot
[1:59:46] but
[1:59:48] god is so good
[1:59:50] it's just so wonderful
[1:59:54] oh my it's just so good the
[1:59:58] things like when you just listen to the
[2:00:01] prophet things start now taking a little
[2:00:04] shape because he will say to you uh the
[2:00:07] messenger of the age comes at the end of
[2:00:10] the age well that's mathematic to me
[2:00:15] the messenger of the laodicea age comes
[2:00:19] at the end of laodicea age to speak to
[2:00:22] whom
[2:00:24] so it comes at the end of seven before
[2:00:28] the eighth
[2:00:29] which is eternity
[2:00:31] so what is what is that
[2:00:33] it is overlapping
[2:00:37] well why is it difficult why makes
[2:00:40] people grinch
[2:00:44] all right
[2:00:45] don't mislocate it this word has the
[2:00:48] power of transformation let me
[2:00:51] end with this as the musicians are
[2:00:53] coming
[2:00:55] we can all stand up if we want
[2:01:03] the messenger comes at the end of the
[2:01:06] church age
[2:01:11] the prophet is in the seventh age
[2:01:16] but he has to introduce the eighth age
[2:01:20] there is no age age
[2:01:23] it is eternity
[2:01:26] but it just has introduced it
[2:01:31] it's overlapping things
[2:01:38] we just need to ask him
[2:01:41] and stay with the world
[2:01:44] and the world will start itself
[2:01:50] open up
[2:01:52] are you with me
[2:01:54] over there
[2:01:59] seven
[2:02:02] is the time
[2:02:05] when god counts time
[2:02:08] he ends at seven
[2:02:15] eight is eternity
[2:02:18] and god overlapped these things
[2:02:24] amen
[2:02:25] oh my
[2:02:32] is so
[2:02:33] just
[2:02:34] so wonderful
[2:02:53] hey
[2:02:56] i'm reading something here
[2:03:03] in the end
[2:03:08] oh revelation chapter 22
[2:03:12] 10
[2:03:14] you can take
[2:03:17] i'm not displaying anything right now
[2:03:22] he say this
[2:03:23] in revelation 10 22
[2:03:27] 10 the bible says and he
[2:03:30] say
[2:03:31] he saith unto me
[2:03:33] still not this the sayings of the
[2:03:36] prophecy of this book
[2:03:37] for the time is
[2:03:39] at
[2:03:40] hand he that is in just let him be in
[2:03:44] just still
[2:03:46] and he which is filthy let him be filthy
[2:03:49] still
[2:03:51] and he is that is righteous let him be
[2:03:53] righteous still
[2:03:55] and he that is holy let him be holy
[2:03:59] still
[2:04:01] what is this
[2:04:03] overlapping
[2:04:07] what makes you righteous
[2:04:10] the right
[2:04:12] righteousness is imputed
[2:04:15] to abraham
[2:04:17] because he accept a belief god
[2:04:21] god made him righteous
[2:04:24] unjust
[2:04:27] is imputed to those
[2:04:30] who refuse the word of god
[2:04:33] but both
[2:04:36] are together
[2:04:39] let the unjust
[2:04:42] remain unjust
[2:04:45] we don't we don't wish that
[2:04:48] but they will do
[2:04:49] is that right
[2:04:51] that's what we are to be we have to be
[2:04:54] interceding
[2:04:56] that's the work that we need to do
[2:04:58] because the bride
[2:05:02] has this the heart of god
[2:05:06] they don't want anybody to be left
[2:05:08] behind
[2:05:10] but it's a time where filthy remain
[2:05:12] filthy
[2:05:14] righteous
[2:05:16] are righteous
[2:05:19] why god does that
[2:05:21] it does it it does not ask anybody his
[2:05:24] advice
[2:05:26] it's the grace of god
[2:05:32] seven is changing into eight
[2:05:36] we're going home
[2:05:39] but we cannot go
[2:05:41] home until this the spiritual catch up
[2:05:46] before the natural
[2:05:48] takes place
[2:05:50] this spiritual
[2:05:52] has to take place
[2:05:54] and that's where people get so
[2:05:56] confused
[2:05:58] it's just because
[2:06:01] you know
[2:06:03] how can you find yourself
[2:06:06] in the banquet
[2:06:09] after you go through the door
[2:06:12] uh to the through the window
[2:06:14] but abraham speaks about it
[2:06:17] they ask him brother branham what is
[2:06:19] that person who got into the banquet
[2:06:23] through the window
[2:06:25] and the brotherhood doesn't say that a
[2:06:28] person will be able to get into the
[2:06:30] banquet
[2:06:32] through the window
[2:06:34] but that's what they're trying to do
[2:06:38] and it won't work because it's a system
[2:06:41] and god does not honor the system
[2:06:50] god honors his word
[2:06:54] amen
[2:06:55] they find fault with the men
[2:06:58] who was the word
[2:07:01] what i'm saying in indictment
[2:07:04] now they find fought with the word
[2:07:07] working
[2:07:08] through men
[2:07:10] through the man they find foot
[2:07:15] through the word the man who was the
[2:07:18] word jesus christ now they find fault in
[2:07:22] with the word working through
[2:07:25] the man
[2:07:27] that you and i
[2:07:29] and our duty is not to try
[2:07:33] to defend
[2:07:36] is not to argue
[2:07:39] but
[2:07:40] to love everyone
[2:07:43] and if god opened
[2:07:45] to humble ourself that we can reach out
[2:07:48] to someone
[2:07:50] because there is no more time
[2:07:53] is a token message remember the token
[2:07:56] message is not in a good time
[2:08:00] let me end up with that
[2:08:01] the token
[2:08:04] the token dispensation is the time where
[2:08:08] the angel of death is outside
[2:08:13] and
[2:08:13] there is a death in the camp
[2:08:18] and some of them
[2:08:21] are hiding in the house with the blood
[2:08:25] in their doors
[2:08:28] and that you and i
[2:08:30] displaying the token message
[2:08:35] amen
[2:08:37] and that's the duty that we have
[2:08:40] god help me
[2:08:42] to live that life
[2:08:44] amen god let the world
[2:08:48] be
[2:08:48] displayed
[2:08:50] god let me live that christian life
[2:08:54] god help me like you did
[2:08:56] i didn't even ask for you to uh
[2:09:01] free me from those movies
[2:09:04] but the word that i was getting inside
[2:09:07] me
[2:09:11] they just
[2:09:12] get rid of it
[2:09:15] and then now i don't i he took it
[2:09:21] what about things in your life that the
[2:09:23] world has to take
[2:09:25] but don't misplace the word
[2:09:30] don't
[2:09:31] refuse what the word says
[2:09:34] because the word has a power
[2:09:38] just the way it is said we come to
[2:09:41] church the pastor preaches
[2:09:44] wednesday preaches
[2:09:46] sunday he preaches
[2:09:48] that word
[2:09:50] will start
[2:09:51] to do something in us if we receive it
[2:09:56] it doesn't have to be new
[2:09:59] it doesn't have to be
[2:10:01] special it has just to be
[2:10:04] the word
[2:10:05] the word
[2:10:07] only
[2:10:11] and that word is the third paul
[2:10:14] it is a
[2:10:16] private
[2:10:18] is not public
[2:10:20] and that's the problem
[2:10:23] moses went
[2:10:25] and made a public display
[2:10:31] even indeed a public display
[2:10:34] but
[2:10:38] brother branham
[2:10:39] display
[2:10:41] the sign is in his hand
[2:10:44] the sign
[2:10:46] the discernment
[2:10:49] but the purpose
[2:10:51] it was just a bait
[2:10:54] so we can get the word
[2:10:57] in the word there is everything
[2:11:00] in the third pool there is everything
[2:11:02] but is not a public display
[2:11:06] god bless you
[2:11:08] oh my
[2:11:10] this will be historic that we
[2:11:13] finished this service
