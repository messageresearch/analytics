[0:00] what it is is coming to the reality of
[0:02] who you really are and recognizing that
[0:05] everything about my flesh is wrong amen
[0:07] I think wrong I feel wrong I do wrong
[0:10] and I have no power to change myself I
[0:13] there has to be another Power that'll
[0:14] change me and I've got to take this
[0:17] vessel and crawl up and lay it across
[0:19] God's Altar and say God I'm tired of
[0:22] trying to patch it up work with it make
[0:24] it work I need you to send the Holy
[0:26] Ghost fire to burn it amen to absolutely
[0:28] Purge all the wickedness out of my life
[0:31] purge amen Purge me until you wash me
[0:34] clean amen and I believe with all my
[0:36] heart there's something tugging on the
[0:38] inside there must be a life down in
[0:40] there there must be a seed but it's
[0:42] shrouded over with perversion it's
[0:43] covered with all the things of a
[0:45] perverted world I can't I can't I can't
[0:48] make it work I'm crawling up and I'm
[0:51] laying down and I'm opening myself and
[0:53] I'm saying God send the fire upon me
[0:56] burn out all that's unlike you and bring
[0:59] life to this that's inside of me that
[1:01] wants more of you that wants to live for
[1:03] you I want to be right I want to know
[1:05] you I want to be a dwelling place for
[1:07] you but I can't seem to do it on my
[1:13] own praise
[1:15] God I think sometimes the thing we
[1:19] avoid is our own
[1:22] judgment our own
[1:26] destruction think we sometimes try to
[1:28] bypass or even have our children Bypass
[1:31] or other people bypass the absolute
[1:34] realization of our depravity the
[1:36] realization that I am no good and I can
[1:38] never be good
[1:42] amen and listen young people you've been
[1:44] raising the message you've been raised
[1:45] in Godly Parents who've kept you in a
[1:47] certain boundary in a certain line amen
[1:49] and you're good-hearted with good
[1:51] intentions and and and you you don't
[1:53] have a desire for evil you don't have a
[1:54] desire to go wrong I know that I watch
[1:56] your lives amen but but listen as soon
[1:59] as you get get old enough to move out
[2:01] from some of those constraints if you
[2:02] have not had a new birth amen that old
[2:05] nature is going to take you amen when
[2:07] you don't have the walls when you don't
[2:08] have the boundary all around you amen
[2:10] there's going to be something that'll
[2:12] take you and grip you and you're going
[2:13] to be surprised amen like Peter was
[2:16] surprised I thought I would never fall I
[2:18] thought I would always stick up for
[2:19] Christ and then when he got away from
[2:21] Christ and he got out on his own he
[2:23] realized he had no power to withstand he
[2:25] had no strength all of his pride came
[2:27] crumbling down and I'm telling you amen
[2:29] in this environment you can walk but
[2:31] where are you going to go when you go to
[2:33] university or when you move out when
[2:35] you're in a workplace amen you've got to
[2:37] have more than just going along with the
[2:39] flow being caught in the current and
[2:40] carried away you've got to be born again
[2:44] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's
[2:46] got to be a life on the inside that is
[2:49] no longer the old man but is the new
[2:55] man amen we can't be afraid of the
[2:59] reality of needing a
[3:02] burning
