[0:00] When he says, "I'm called to be a light
[0:03] unto the Gentiles."
[0:05] &gt;&gt; Man, that really sounds like you really
[0:08] think a lot of yourself, Paul.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; BUT PAUL PAUL'S not the one who came up
[0:13] with that plan.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; Paul's not the one who decided that.
[0:16] When David said, "God's anointed me to
[0:18] be a king." And you look at him, you
[0:19] little shrimp, you're a king. Haha.
[0:21] Listen, it wasn't David's idea. David
[0:24] wasn't doing anything wrong. For David
[0:25] to say, "God's anointed me to be a
[0:27] king," is speaking the word of God.
[0:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; FOR FOR THE APOSTLE PAUL TO SAY, "GOD
[0:33] WILL JUDGE THE WORLD BY MY GOSPEL. I'M A
[0:35] LIGHT UNTO THE GENTILES." GOD HAS CALLED
[0:38] ME, AMEN, TO TAKE THE GOSPEL to the
[0:40] Gentiles. HE'S NOT BRAGGING. HE'S NOT
[0:42] LIFTING HIMSELF UP. HE'S just telling
[0:44] the truth.
[0:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:46] &gt;&gt; AND GOD LET HIM FAIL SO MISERABLY AND SO
[0:48] BAD THAT WHEN IT COME TIME TO DECLARE
[0:50] he's apostle, an apostle of God, HE
[0:52] SAYS, "HEY, LISTEN. I'm not even worthy
[0:53] to be an apostle, but by the grace of
[0:55] God, I am what I am.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[0:57] &gt;&gt; When Moses says, "I've come down to
[0:59] deliver you out of Egypt. I'VE COME DOWN
[1:01] AND GOD HAS CALLED ME TO TAKE YOU BACK."
[1:03] AMEN. AND GOD IS GOING TO DO MIRACLES
[1:05] through me. Listen. Listen. He wasn't
[1:07] bragging. He was only telling THE TRUTH.
[1:08] AND FOR US TO SAY, "I BELIEVE BY FAITH
[1:11] AND BY GRACE. I'M PART OF THE BRIDE OF
[1:13] JESUS CHRIST." THAT'S NOTHING BUT
[1:14] DECLARING THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And we DON'T DO SO WITH PRIDE or
[1:19] arrogancy, but in humility, saying, "I
[1:22] MESSED MY LIFE UP. EVEN AFTER BELIEVING,
[1:24] I'VE MESSED EVERYTHING UP. I'VE MESSED
[1:26] EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE MESSED UP HAS
[1:27] BEEN MESSED UP BY ME.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; But I still believe."
[1:32] &gt;&gt; I believe what he said about me. I
[1:34] believe what that prophet said about me.
[1:36] I believe the word. And why do I
[1:38] believe? Because I can't help but
[1:41] believe.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; I didn't believe because I CHOSE TO
[1:44] BELIEVE. I JUST BELIEVED. AMEN.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; I KNOW THAT SOUNDS ODD, BUT IT'S THE
[1:51] TRUTH.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE. IT WASN'T
[1:53] THAT YOU CALCULATED EVERYTHING OUT AND
[1:55] LAID IT ALL OUT and says, "hm, you know,
[1:57] the Baptists say this and the
[1:59] Pentecostals and but I've been reading
[2:01] my Bible and I talked to a few
[2:02] theologians and listen, I put together a
[2:04] flowchart
[2:07] &gt;&gt; and THE MOST REASONABLE EXPLANATION FOR
[2:09] THE GOSPEL IS BROTHER BEN. SO, I DECIDED
[2:11] TO BELIEVE THE MESSAGE." THAT IS NOT HOW
[2:13] WE COME TO THE MESSAGE. WE COME TO THE
[2:15] MESSAGE BEFORE WE UNDERSTOOD IT. WE
[2:16] STILL HAD A MILLION QUESTIONS. PEOPLE
[2:18] WOULD ASK US, "WELL, WHAT ABOUT THAT?"
[2:19] YOU SAY, "WELL, I DON'T KNOW." WELL,
[2:20] WHAT ABOUT this scripture? I don't know.
[2:22] Well, this scripture proves Trinity. How
[2:24] do YOU DO? I DON'T KNOW. UH, BUT I STILL
[2:26] BELIEVE.
[2:28] &gt;&gt; We didn't come when WE FIGURED IT OUT.
[2:30] WE DIDN'T START PROCLAIMING IT BECAUSE
[2:32] WE had all the answers. something down
[2:34] inside of us, a seed gene OF GOD BY
[2:37] PREDESTINATION WAS ALREADY
[2:38] pre-programmed that when they heard the
[2:41] word like they did in the book of Acts
[2:42] WHEN PAUL AND BARNABAS CAME, those that
[2:44] were ordained to eternal life, they
[2:46] believed. And you were chosen to believe
[2:49] this message.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; You didn't believe it because you
[2:53] decided to.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; If you decided to believe it, you'll be
[2:57] one of those who will leave it one day.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; I promise you that.
[3:02] But if against your will and beyond YOUR
[3:04] BETTER JUDGMENT AND AGAINST ALL AGAINST
[3:07] ALL OF YOUR RESISTANCE and
[3:09] intellectualism and ALL OF YOUR UH
[3:11] PUSHING AGAINST IT, YOU STILL BELIEVE.
[3:15] AMEN.
