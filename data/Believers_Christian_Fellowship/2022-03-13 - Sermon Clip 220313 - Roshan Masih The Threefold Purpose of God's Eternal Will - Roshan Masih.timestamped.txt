[0:00] paul
[0:03] god revealed to him
[0:04] that i
[0:06] and my people are one
[0:08] i am one with the believer
[0:11] believers and i
[0:14] are one
[0:16] amen
[0:18] that's
[0:19] what
[0:21] be revealed
[0:23] to paul
[0:25] he called the visa
[0:27] he received
[0:29] something
[0:30] amen and jesus is saying
[0:33] that if you persuade the believer you
[0:35] persecute me
[0:38] and
[0:39] the poor paul who was a great religious
[0:43] person who was filled
[0:45] filled with all the doctrines
[0:49] all the
[0:51] righteousness whatever because he said i
[0:53] am percy sopherson
[0:56] he was a sincere person
[1:00] he was following
[1:03] something which was ordained by god
[1:07] but still that was not god's eternal
[1:11] purpose
[1:13] so god intervened
[1:15] many times
[1:16] sometimes we are gathered around some
[1:19] doctrine
[1:21] and we preach those things
[1:24] and we love to talk
[1:26] all those things which are good
[1:29] nothing should say against them
[1:32] but christ is not a doctrine
[1:36] trash is a
[1:38] transition life
[1:41] what is this message
[1:44] which is given to us
[1:46] he said christ is revealed in his whole
[1:48] world
[1:50] what are those seals
[1:52] what is open christ
[1:54] revealed himself
[1:59] so this message we have received
[2:02] is not a bunch of doctrine
[2:05] this is not easy
[2:06] that's why when he's preaching on the
[2:08] seventh hill he said don't make any ism
[2:12] leave it as it is
[2:14] because the seventh silly jesus christ
[2:17] himself
[2:18] coming down in us
[2:21] that we may
[2:22] many self himself into us in his own
[2:27] way
[2:29] he is the life
