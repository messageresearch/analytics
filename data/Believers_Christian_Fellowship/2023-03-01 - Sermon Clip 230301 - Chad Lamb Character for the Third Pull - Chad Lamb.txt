TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we've heard talking about the spoken word the manifestation but I think brother Benham declared it for us and he showed us temporarily what we'll see in fullness of power what it will look like I don't know how it will happen I don't know will it be everybody will it be a few well I have no idea it may be completely different than what I'm even thinking but the point is it'll be there according to the prophecy and it'll be according to God's design and will and his timing through whomsoever he chooses but the vessel he chooses will have the character to handle that power he will see to it so if we ever want to be part of that manifestation then what do we do today I say never forget your ABCs never forget your ABCs we have people who want to show Dynamic gifts and dynamic powers and they want to speak things and they want to do great things and really when it comes down to it they want to be somebody you can see through it but but they want to speak things but I say if you want to speak something into existence and if you want the power of the spoken word then start by speaking the word to this earth here and getting this to obey the word well I speak to a storm if you can't even keep from lying why speak to a storm if you can't even keep your home in order why speak to a storm if you can't keep this body this Earth why speak to the Earth if you can't speak to this earth and make it match the scriptures if you can't conduct yourself in your home as a Son of God and a daughter of God if you're fighting and fussing all the time if the children are disorderly then why why even think about speaking something into existence until we first come back to the ABCs and let God train us where we're at and repent and recognize I need something more I need a greater character just to handle today amen we want to speak a world to existence and go live a private life on it but we can't pay our tithes on a regular basis or show up to church according to the word and forsake the assembling together of ourselves you realize that no matter how far you go in math you still need ABCs to go to algebra and trigonometry and all that and no matter how advanced you get in literature all literature is still made of the ABCs at least English literature you can never get away from the ABCs you can never become so advanced in the kingdom of God that you don't need to pay your tithes pray and read your Bible every day that you don't need to come to Fellowship you're never getting so Advanced that you don't need fellowship with the Believers you never got so Advanced that you don't need to sin under the live preaching of the word through the faithful Ministry you've never you've never got that advanced yet we can never we can never listen these things are foundational they're ABCs their basics in the scripture they're basic the rudimental parts of Christian Life through the foundation but remember the rest of the house is built on the foundation so you can never start building off the foundation and leave the foundation your building will collapse everything must stay upon this Foundation all the way up so we want to go high but forsake the foundation don't forsake the foundation we want to we want Power the bride's going to this and the bride's going to do that why doesn't the bride just keep her home in order well the bride will do this and the bride will do that why won't the bride just clean up her language clean up her lifestyle why won't the bride just as a husband loved his wife as Christ loved the church well why won't the wife reverence her husband you see what I'm saying if we ever want to get to the top of the ladder we've got to hit every rung on the ladder why to build character to learn obedience stay in line with the word we're never going to have power of spoken word if we can't keep the word
