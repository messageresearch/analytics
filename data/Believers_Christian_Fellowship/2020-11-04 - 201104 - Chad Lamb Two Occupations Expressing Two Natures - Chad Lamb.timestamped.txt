[6:45] and while you're standing let's take our
[6:46] bibles and turn to genesis
[6:49] chapter four i'd like to begin reading
[6:52] in genesis chapter four
[6:53] and then we'll let you be seated and say
[6:55] god bless you sister jackie mae i
[6:57] appreciated that special
[6:59] appreciate her driving all the way over
[7:00] from indiana just to sing it
[7:02] and share it with us and praise god and
[7:04] thank god for that
[7:05] may the lord give you a safe trip home
[7:07] tonight as well
[7:09] amen isn't it amazing the world's in
[7:11] chaos
[7:13] country's in chaos there's turmoil
[7:15] everywhere but there's peace in our
[7:17] hearts
[7:19] to worship the lord and know all is
[7:21] under control there's nothing
[7:23] the clock is ticking right on time
[7:25] there's nothing out of kilter
[7:26] all these things has to be this way god
[7:29] raises kings and he lowers kings he
[7:31] raises nations and he lowers nations god
[7:33] does
[7:34] whatsoever god wants to do and nothing's
[7:36] going to happen
[7:37] outside of his plan and so turmoil and
[7:41] stress
[7:41] and but praise god we're happy people
[7:45] we can smile and sing as praises because
[7:47] we're free
[7:48] we're free from the need for politic
[7:50] politics to fix anything for us
[7:53] brother rem said all politics are of the
[7:54] devil it's not going to fix anything for
[7:56] us
[7:57] but there's a promise that's given to us
[7:59] and that's what we set our heights above
[8:01] and more than anything the chaos all the
[8:04] chaos does
[8:05] is give me just a greater desire to look
[8:07] above
[8:08] to keep looking up because there's
[8:10] nothing here to hope for friends
[8:12] there's nothing to hope for there's no
[8:15] help on earth there's
[8:16] there's no fixing this it won't get
[8:19] fixed it'll get worse
[8:20] and worse and worse until it goes into
[8:23] absolute ruin and destruction
[8:25] but we're going higher and higher and
[8:28] higher in christ
[8:30] let's look at genesis chapter four verse
[8:33] one
[8:36] and adam knew eva's wife and she
[8:37] conceived and bear cain and said i have
[8:39] gotten
[8:40] a man from the lord and she again bears
[8:42] brother abel and abel was a keeper of
[8:44] sheep but cain
[8:45] was a tiller of the ground let's bow our
[8:49] heads and pray
[8:51] lord jesus we thank you father for your
[8:53] goodness to us
[8:54] for your mercy and your grace lord for
[8:56] the peace that's in our heart and the
[8:58] joy that we have within
[8:59] us for we've heard the good report and
[9:02] we believe it lord
[9:03] and it means everything to us and lord
[9:06] as we look into your word tonight
[9:08] we just pray father that you would just
[9:09] open it to us that you give us
[9:11] understanding lord and read by
[9:13] revelation that we might know
[9:14] what it is you're trying to speak to us
[9:16] in this hour and lord may we gain
[9:18] strength from this for this life that
[9:20] you've called us to live may word by
[9:22] word you have greater preeminence in
[9:24] your bride and
[9:25] may we walk according to your will and
[9:27] your word in jesus name we pray
[9:29] amen you can all be seated
[9:33] keep your bibles open we're going to
[9:35] look at this scripture but
[9:38] i want to refer back to sunday just for
[9:41] a minute i'm not going to preach on that
[9:42] i've got another subject but but just
[9:45] the three things that i sealed the notes
[9:47] because i didn't wrap that up at the end
[9:48] just so you would have it
[9:50] three things that have sealed the notes
[9:51] ownership
[9:53] security and a finished work so the
[9:56] greatest thing
[9:57] ever was that there was a sealed book in
[9:59] heaven
[10:01] because that sealed book in heaven means
[10:03] that the contents of that book
[10:05] were declared that there was an owner of
[10:07] the content of the book because it's the
[10:08] lamb's book of life
[10:10] amen that the the contents are secure to
[10:13] the destination
[10:15] and that it's a finished work it was
[10:18] finished before the seals were put on
[10:20] and so we we we thank god for that and
[10:23] you know we
[10:25] talked quite a bit about seals and and
[10:27] the breaking of seals and opening of
[10:29] seals
[10:30] and you realize many many times things
[10:32] are sealed in the scriptures and open in
[10:33] the scriptures and
[10:34] sealed to one group and opened to
[10:36] another jesus spoke in parables
[10:38] amen so that seeing they wouldn't see
[10:40] because the the revelation of the
[10:42] parable was still sealed to them
[10:43] but to the disciples it was unsealed
[10:47] so the same thing it's when we talk
[10:49] about the ceiling and the seals
[10:51] it's not always the physical uh physical
[10:54] clay it's not always the physical
[10:56] impression that we're talking about
[10:57] amen god can hide and god can reveal god
[11:00] can seal and god can open
[11:02] god can have it open and sealed at the
[11:03] same time
[11:05] so we've got to move away from the
[11:06] physical understanding only
[11:08] amen and when i say that i don't in any
[11:10] way try to get away from the fact that
[11:12] there may be a physical representation
[11:15] there may be a physical because you know
[11:17] when the when the judgments are said and
[11:18] the books are open i'm not taking away
[11:20] from the fact that god may have in
[11:21] heaven a physical representation
[11:24] but if that's all we can see we limit
[11:27] ourselves in the revelation of the word
[11:29] for instance when when man fell and he
[11:32] was cast out of the garden and now
[11:34] there was cherubim with a flaming sword
[11:36] put to turn every which way
[11:37] that keep the way of the tree of life it
[11:40] was a sealing of the way of the tree of
[11:42] life
[11:43] it was now sealed amen there was going
[11:45] to come a time that that way would be
[11:47] unsealed and those cherubim were there
[11:49] to keep or guard or preserve
[11:51] the way to the tree of life so man was
[11:53] sealed out
[11:54] of the tree of life but the way to the
[11:56] tree of life was under the seal
[12:00] and so that seal it wasn't a physical
[12:03] a stamp or a piece of clay with an
[12:06] impression
[12:06] i mean it was a cherubim with a flaming
[12:08] sword amen to keep them to drive them
[12:10] back
[12:11] amen from the tree of life amen but once
[12:13] that that
[12:14] that blade had been covered in blood and
[12:17] then it was sheathed
[12:18] and now the seal was open to go back to
[12:21] the tree of life
[12:22] and now the cherubim job that was
[12:24] keeping the way of the tree of life was
[12:26] to ensure
[12:27] that the seed of god made it back to the
[12:29] tree of life
[12:30] so the very ones that were responsible
[12:32] for the seal with the flaming sword
[12:34] amen were the now the the requirement
[12:37] was
[12:37] satisfied with the blood of the lamb the
[12:39] sword was put away
[12:41] and now it was unsealed or opened and
[12:44] now through a process of the cherubim
[12:46] the four-faced cherubim amen that
[12:48] cherubim who was sealing the way
[12:50] keeping the way now the way is open and
[12:52] he's going to make sure that the
[12:54] children of god
[12:55] get back to the tree of life and they'll
[12:57] do it first by a lion anointing
[13:00] remember four faces to the cherubim four
[13:02] living creatures around the
[13:03] throne first he'll begin to usher them
[13:06] back to the tree of life through the
[13:07] lion anointing
[13:08] then through the ox anointing then
[13:10] through the man anointing
[13:11] and finally the fourth face of the
[13:13] cherubim where the fourth beast was the
[13:14] flying eagle
[13:15] and the eagle anointing will make sure
[13:17] the last stage of the journey is secure
[13:20] under the eagle anointing to get man
[13:22] back to the tree of life
[13:26] amen so when i preach on these things i
[13:29] don't ever want to
[13:30] take away from the fact or maybe literal
[13:32] representation we may
[13:34] see something over there i don't know
[13:35] but but we don't want to lock ourselves
[13:37] into physical furniture and physical
[13:39] placements and physical seals
[13:41] only because we're going to miss
[13:43] everything else he's been trying to tell
[13:44] us
[13:46] god works through symbology and and in
[13:49] symbols and he's trying to relay
[13:51] a revelation because the great mystery
[13:54] the great mystery of god had been sealed
[13:56] up
[13:56] in god for all this time and now he's
[13:59] letting it out
[14:02] i mean let's turn our attention now if
[14:04] we can to
[14:05] genesis chapter four and i want to move
[14:07] on with another thought
[14:09] i had while i was on vacation with the
[14:12] family i'd covered this topic in a
[14:15] in a uh devotion with the family and i
[14:18] just thought it was this cute little
[14:19] thought a little devotion
[14:20] and all of a sudden it just began to
[14:22] blossom you know it's one of those
[14:23] things that began to open up
[14:25] and i thought the kids would enjoy it
[14:26] and relate to it and all of a sudden i
[14:27] began to enjoy it and relate to it
[14:30] and so i want to i want to open this up
[14:31] if we could pull up the powerpoint
[14:34] and we want to look at this i want to
[14:36] discuss two occupations expressing two
[14:39] natures
[14:40] two occupations expressing two natures
[14:43] i think you'll see quite quickly what
[14:45] we're talking about nothing here is
[14:47] complicated
[14:48] but oh is it really wonderful brother
[14:51] benham told us
[14:52] he said if you don't see christ in every
[14:54] verse and every line of the bible go
[14:55] back and read it again for you missed
[14:57] something
[14:58] and once you've once we've been given
[15:01] the
[15:02] eagle vision of the word i mean we've
[15:04] been able under an eagle anointing to
[15:06] fly
[15:07] up high enough above creeds and
[15:09] denominations and doctrines and
[15:11] and time restrictions and time elements
[15:13] and get up high enough to where you can
[15:15] see genesis the revelation to see
[15:17] what the hearts cry hearts desire that
[15:19] god was all along and
[15:20] now begin to see the fulfillment of that
[15:23] when you see that you see that this is
[15:24] one story this is one purpose
[15:26] and one desire that god had in the back
[15:29] part of his mind
[15:30] and he's been slowly letting it out amen
[15:32] and and this is the one achievement that
[15:34] he wanted to achieve
[15:35] and when you see that now you can go see
[15:38] christ in every line
[15:40] without that revelation i don't know how
[15:42] you can see christ in every line
[15:44] but once you see i would say once you
[15:46] get the big picture
[15:48] now every picture has to match the big
[15:51] picture
[15:52] every story matches the main story every
[15:56] every happening every every character
[15:58] has to portray
[15:59] that character amen and so now we begin
[16:02] to look at the bible this way and it
[16:04] begins to open up to us a deeper
[16:06] understanding
[16:08] let's read again the the uh chapter four
[16:10] verse one and we'll read a little
[16:12] further
[16:13] and adam knew his wife he adam knew eve
[16:16] his wife
[16:17] and she conceived and bear cain and said
[16:19] i have gotten a man from the lord
[16:22] and she again bears brother abel and
[16:23] abel was a keeper of the sheep but cain
[16:26] was a tiller of the ground there's your
[16:28] two occupations
[16:30] one was the keeper of sheep and one was
[16:31] a tiller of the ground and we want to
[16:33] show that there's two occupations that
[16:35] show two natures
[16:36] we want to get into this deeper amen and
[16:39] she again
[16:40] bear his brother uh abel and abel was a
[16:44] keeper of the sheep but cain was a
[16:45] tiller of the ground
[16:47] and there's nothing in the bible by
[16:49] accident
[16:51] it wasn't that you know moses one day
[16:53] said there's two sons and
[16:55] oh god showed me that there's two twins
[16:56] and one's got to do one job one's got to
[16:58] do the other so we'll make one a
[17:00] shepherd and we'll make one a tiller of
[17:01] the ground
[17:02] no but these words are ordained by god
[17:04] and placed here to tell the great story
[17:09] so abel was a keeper of sheep but cain
[17:11] was a tiller of the ground
[17:12] and in the process of time it came to
[17:14] pass that cain brought of the fruit of
[17:16] the ground an
[17:16] offering unto the lord in abel he also
[17:20] brought of the first things of the flock
[17:21] and of the fat thereof and the lord had
[17:24] respect and to able and his offering but
[17:26] unto cain
[17:27] and his offering he had not respect and
[17:29] cain was very roth and his countenance
[17:31] fell
[17:32] and the lord said unto cain why art thou
[17:34] wroth and why is thou countenance fallen
[17:36] if thou does well shalt thou not be
[17:39] accepted and thou doest not well send
[17:41] life at the door
[17:42] and unto thee shall be his desire and
[17:44] thou shalt rule over him
[17:46] and cain talked with abel his brother
[17:48] and it came to pass
[17:50] when they were in the field that cain
[17:51] rose up against abel his brother
[17:54] and slew him what an amazing story
[17:59] that everything written has purpose and
[18:01] in such in so
[18:02] few lines in just a few lines
[18:05] amen the stage is set for the rest of
[18:08] the bible
[18:10] what happened here will continue to
[18:12] happen story after
[18:14] story generation after generation age
[18:16] after
[18:17] age and so what started in genesis goes
[18:20] all the way to revelation
[18:23] brother branham says in in the message i
[18:26] will restore unto you saith the lord
[18:29] now then in order to get the basis of
[18:30] this for a few minutes i believe that
[18:33] everything that is now began in genesis
[18:36] the word genesis is the beginning and
[18:37] every cult that we have on the face of
[18:39] the earth today begin in genesis
[18:41] everything that we have today started in
[18:43] genesis it's the beginning
[18:44] or otherwise known as the seed chapter
[18:46] of the bible where the beginning
[18:48] originated and we know that
[18:54] we know that the scripture says that
[18:59] he's declared the end from the beginning
[19:02] so in genesis he's already declared the
[19:04] end but he's declared it in mystery form
[19:07] but when you see the picture and you get
[19:09] to the end then you can go back and you
[19:10] can find the end in the beginning
[19:13] and so we we find it all the way back in
[19:15] the story of adam and eve you know wife
[19:17] separated out united back together the
[19:19] crowning act
[19:20] crowning achievement crowning act of all
[19:21] of creation he's declared the end from
[19:23] the beginning
[19:24] but you don't know that it's the end
[19:26] when you read the beginning
[19:28] until a prophet comes on the scene and
[19:30] tells you what the great mystery of god
[19:32] what's been hidden in god all along and
[19:34] is now being revealed
[19:35] and then you can go back and begin to
[19:36] see the end in the beginning
[19:38] it's there and it's there and it's there
[19:40] and it's there
[19:42] now there's several there's several
[19:44] scriptures we're going to go through i
[19:45] did a powerpoint today just so we could
[19:47] all stay on track
[19:48] i don't typically like hemming myself
[19:50] into a powerpoint
[19:52] but it's so you can jot things down a
[19:54] lot of definitions of words and
[19:56] scriptures i want to go through so bear
[19:57] with me
[19:58] brother venom also says the true vine
[20:00] and in the message the truth and the
[20:01] false vine
[20:02] now all things originated in genesis
[20:04] you'd like to study genesis
[20:06] brother and your ministers oh i think
[20:08] it's the greatest book of the bible one
[20:09] of them
[20:10] everything you find today originated in
[20:13] genesis
[20:14] genesis means the beginning every cult
[20:16] that you find on earth today started in
[20:18] genesis every real true church on
[20:20] the earth today started in genesis
[20:23] all right if there's a true church on
[20:25] earth today it started in genesis
[20:27] there's a cult on earth today it started
[20:29] in genesis
[20:31] everything that we see even all the
[20:33] science started
[20:34] in genesis and another message brother
[20:38] ben says then salvation
[20:40] begins in genesis
[20:44] salvation begins in genesis because the
[20:47] path to salvation is the word
[20:50] amen when they begin to accept the word
[20:52] they're on the path to salvation
[20:54] amen in righteousness is imputed unto
[20:56] them because
[20:57] of their faith because of receiving the
[20:59] word then salvation begins in genesis
[21:02] impersonation begins in genesis
[21:04] formality begins in genesis
[21:07] everything began at genesis like a vine
[21:10] so when brother of heaven is now showing
[21:12] everything began in genesis but it
[21:13] didn't stop in genesis
[21:15] everything began in genesis but nothing
[21:17] stopped in genesis
[21:18] and what began in genesis like a vine
[21:20] amen is creeping and growing its way
[21:22] through the whole bible
[21:25] and it's two vines so let's
[21:28] let's look at this a little more closely
[21:30] here
[21:33] we look at the name cain i want to just
[21:35] look at the name cain for a minute and
[21:37] we do this in the form of a bible study
[21:39] so don't wait for me to get real fired
[21:40] up to start saying amen because we're
[21:42] going to do a bible study
[21:44] and we love the bible so we say amen
[21:47] when we read the bible
[21:48] help me out amen so
[21:52] the name cain when we go to the
[21:54] concordance
[21:55] it means possession or a choir i put
[21:58] that in parentheses because it doesn't
[22:00] come out of strong's accordance it comes
[22:01] out of another concordance that i have
[22:03] a possession or a choir amen because
[22:07] the the eve says i have gotten or
[22:10] acquired a man from the lord
[22:12] but it means possession or a choir and
[22:14] it doesn't just refer
[22:16] to the fact that eve was given a
[22:18] man-child but it also
[22:20] starts to declare the nature of cain
[22:23] because
[22:23] cain has a desire to possess and acquire
[22:27] that's the desire the nature of cain
[22:30] amen we're going to find out that's the
[22:31] very reason he was a tiller of the soil
[22:34] because he had a nature to possess he
[22:36] had a nature to acquire
[22:38] because that's the nature his father had
[22:40] his father the devil
[22:42] amen wasn't satisfied with the portion
[22:44] he was given he wanted to possess
[22:46] another portion a greater portion he
[22:49] wanted
[22:50] he wanted to exalt himself above the
[22:52] stars of heaven the stars of god he
[22:54] wanted
[22:54] to sit on the sides of the north over
[22:56] the congregation
[22:58] exactly where god said he would put his
[23:00] throne on the sides of the north so he
[23:02] wouldn't to possess or acquire
[23:04] more than what god gave him and he was
[23:07] willing amen to manipulate truth
[23:11] to possess or acquire
[23:15] so you see in the name we're beginning
[23:17] to see the very nature of cain
[23:19] to possess or acquire
[23:23] if we look
[23:28] in the concordance after his name it
[23:30] says the same as
[23:32] 70 13. 70 13 if you look
[23:35] this in his name cain is 70 14 in the
[23:38] in the hebrew section of the concordance
[23:41] amen the the word above it
[23:42] is the same meaning in the same name
[23:45] one's used for cain's name
[23:46] one's another word that's used and that
[23:48] word means a spear
[23:51] so we're beginning to see the nature of
[23:52] cain amen
[23:54] he he he's a possessor i mean he wants
[23:57] to possess
[23:58] he wants to acquire but his name also
[24:01] means the same thing as a spear
[24:04] so how is he going to possess
[24:07] an acquire
[24:11] amen now
[24:14] when we go to the greek when we look
[24:17] into the new testament
[24:18] the new testament is the greek and in
[24:20] first john 3
[24:21] 12 it says not as cain who was of the
[24:23] wicked one and slew his brother
[24:24] and wherefore slew he him because his
[24:26] own works were evil and his brother's
[24:28] righteous
[24:29] i want you to think about this word now
[24:31] we're going to look at this definition
[24:33] here
[24:33] in the greek because it's amazing how
[24:36] they define the word cain here because
[24:38] this is a
[24:39] translation of the hebrew into greek but
[24:41] the meaning is super interesting
[24:43] but he says he slew his brother and
[24:45] wherefore slew he him
[24:47] because his works were his own works
[24:49] were evil
[24:50] and his brother's righteous and you have
[24:52] to think what were cain's works amen
[24:54] what were cain's works that was so evil
[24:57] and cables was righteous
[24:59] and if you go back to looking at the
[25:00] works amen they both brought an offering
[25:03] to god
[25:04] they both amen the the one built an
[25:07] altar
[25:07] cain spent some time the way brother
[25:09] brown describes it spill some time
[25:11] erecting and fabricating and fashioning
[25:13] an altar for god
[25:14] he spent time working and laboring and
[25:17] toiling so that he would have something
[25:19] that he produced
[25:20] that he acquired that he possessed that
[25:22] he grew
[25:23] amen that he made come to life and he
[25:25] was going to offer that back to god amen
[25:28] and
[25:28] abel also amen was waiting for something
[25:31] to give to god and he waited for a
[25:33] revelation from god
[25:34] and by revelation on the word because
[25:36] you can only have revelation on the word
[25:40] my revelation of the word he offered the
[25:42] correct sacrifice which god accepted
[25:45] and he rejected cain's amen and why slew
[25:48] he
[25:49] his brother because his works were evil
[25:51] amen when cain's
[25:52] was righteous and you have to think i
[25:56] mean what did he do that was so bad
[25:58] amen he offered an offering he
[25:59] worshipped god brother banham said both
[26:01] these boys
[26:02] loved god and had a desire to worship
[26:05] god
[26:05] amen cain was very religious
[26:09] and had a love for god and a desire to
[26:11] worship god
[26:13] amen but he worshipped god according to
[26:15] the lust of his
[26:16] own idea his own desire his own way
[26:20] and his works were evil and they were
[26:22] rejected cain never
[26:24] offered a worship that was of or abel
[26:27] abel didn't offer a worship that was of
[26:29] his own desire he offered a worship that
[26:31] was
[26:32] god's desire and when he offered
[26:34] according to god's way
[26:36] god's will god's desire amen it showed
[26:39] that he was righteous
[26:41] amen because he was able to receive the
[26:43] word and obey the word
[26:46] when he's able to receive the word amen
[26:48] like
[26:49] abraham was able to receive the word and
[26:51] believe the word and act on the word it
[26:53] was imputed unto him for righteousness
[26:55] and abel is declared righteous because
[26:58] he has the capacity to receive the word
[27:00] but not just to hear it but to receive
[27:02] it by revelation
[27:04] and then to go to acting on it to
[27:06] vindicate his faith
[27:09] and god will know he's righteous amen
[27:11] but cain is evil
[27:12] but when you just look amen with her
[27:14] humanistic ideas
[27:16] at the efforts these men put into their
[27:18] sacrifice
[27:19] their desire to worship god amen the
[27:21] conversations they may have had
[27:23] leading up to the day of sacrifice how
[27:25] pious and holy
[27:27] how reverent cain was
[27:30] how desiring he was to give god the best
[27:34] how much he wanted to do for the lord
[27:36] how much he wanted to show his love to
[27:38] god
[27:38] how much effort he wanted to put into it
[27:41] amen when you watch this
[27:42] how could you declare that evil
[27:49] but then god he respects
[27:52] abel's offering and and declares abel
[27:55] righteous
[27:57] cain now is rejected his offering is
[27:59] rejected
[28:00] amen and he's downcast and god comes to
[28:02] him and begins to speak to him why
[28:04] why are you so downcast just do
[28:08] as your brother abel has done and it'll
[28:10] be well with thee
[28:12] god comes and gives him the word
[28:15] i'll tell you this he gives him a chance
[28:19] in mercy i mean
[28:22] is god obligated to give him more
[28:24] information i mean
[28:26] cain wasn't seeking like abel was
[28:28] seeking amen cain
[28:29] amen didn't didn't pray the way
[28:31] obviously the way abel was praying
[28:34] and waiting for what abel was waiting
[28:36] for amen so
[28:37] so now amen god comes in mercy
[28:41] and he gives cain an opportunity amen
[28:44] and cain
[28:44] doesn't want that opportunity he doesn't
[28:47] take that opportunity
[28:48] he rejects the opportunity because to
[28:51] take that
[28:52] opportunity he would have to humble
[28:54] himself
[28:55] and it's not in the nature of his father
[28:57] to humble himself
[28:59] and he will not humble himself just to
[29:01] repeat what his brother did
[29:04] and if he would have just repeated what
[29:05] his brother did it would have been well
[29:07] with him
[29:09] but there's no humility in cain
[29:14] and then cain has a discussion with his
[29:17] brother abel
[29:20] now remember everything starts in
[29:21] genesis this isn't a story about genesis
[29:24] this is a story about today
[29:26] what started there is here the vines
[29:28] that started growing i've come to fruit
[29:30] here
[29:32] so don't don't make this a story about
[29:34] cain and abel make this a story that's
[29:35] all around us today
[29:37] this is what we're living in so now
[29:41] uh he goes to talk to abel
[29:44] and has a discussion with abel and the
[29:46] bible doesn't tell us what's said
[29:48] i don't believe brother branham anywhere
[29:49] then i know it tells us what's said
[29:51] but the result of the conversation ended
[29:54] in
[29:55] cain murdering abel
[30:00] why because the devil is
[30:03] always if he can't stop the word he
[30:06] tries to destroy the vessel that's
[30:08] bringing the word
[30:10] that's what the prophet of god told us
[30:11] and abel had the correct revelation
[30:14] he had the correct understanding he knew
[30:16] what was the correct sacrifice and why
[30:18] it was the correct sacrifice
[30:20] brother rem tells us so and during this
[30:23] conversation
[30:24] whatever transpired and whatever was
[30:26] said we know that
[30:27] abel had the word and the true
[30:29] revelation of the word cain did not have
[30:31] the true revelation of the word
[30:33] but he was granted mercy and opportunity
[30:35] just to repeat what abel did
[30:37] and he wouldn't take it because it would
[30:39] require humility so he goes to talk to
[30:41] his brother
[30:42] abel maybe to find out what this great
[30:44] mystery is what's so
[30:45] what's the big deal why did you do what
[30:47] you did amen somehow during the
[30:49] conversation
[30:50] something was said that infuriated cain
[30:53] to the point
[30:54] he had to kill his brother
[30:59] that's not the past that's the present
[31:04] they can't kill you they'll try to kill
[31:06] your influence
[31:08] brother mim says so the killing is still
[31:11] going on
[31:13] they did it to brother branham to do it
[31:15] to the bride it's not going to stop
[31:17] right
[31:18] so so let's just move on a little
[31:21] further
[31:22] now we're in to first john we're in the
[31:25] new testament
[31:26] and now the the greeks are going to
[31:28] translate this hebrew word cain
[31:30] into a greek word and then if you look
[31:31] at the translation it means
[31:33] maker fabricator literally a smith
[31:39] now now cain
[31:43] we're looking at two occupations and
[31:45] bringing forth declaring two natures
[31:49] now his occupation when we look at the
[31:52] tiller of the ground
[31:53] we need to move away from just the idea
[31:57] of all he's doing is turning over the
[31:59] earth and planting seeds
[32:01] there's more that's going in there
[32:03] because his name also means spear
[32:05] and his name also means a maker
[32:07] fabricator
[32:08] amen a smith literally a smith
[32:12] amen and i want to ask you a question
[32:14] where does a smith
[32:15] that works in metallurgy where does he
[32:17] get his material from
[32:19] amen tilling in the soil pulling out
[32:23] materials
[32:24] that he can fabricate in fashion and
[32:26] become a smith
[32:28] so when cain was digging around in the
[32:30] earth amen
[32:31] it wasn't a little it wasn't a little
[32:36] sweet farm setting where he had a few
[32:38] vegetables and all of that
[32:40] amen cain was trying to possess
[32:43] cain was trying to acquire amen cain was
[32:46] making for himself
[32:50] everything started in genesis he takes
[32:53] the nature of his father
[32:55] the devil amen and now what is he doing
[32:58] i'm going to get way ahead of myself but
[33:00] if we you just love me anyways amen
[33:02] if we jump around cain now amen he's
[33:06] working with the spoken word of god
[33:08] because the earth and all creation is a
[33:10] spoken word of god
[33:12] and now cain is willing to manipulate
[33:14] the spoken word of god for his own gain
[33:18] cain is willing amen digging in their
[33:21] seemingly righteous sin
[33:22] but what's he trying to do he's trying
[33:24] to acquire he's trying to possess
[33:26] he's trying to fashion he's trying to
[33:28] make for his own purposes
[33:30] his offering was for his own desire not
[33:33] for god because when god come and told
[33:34] him what to do he wouldn't even have
[33:36] respect enough for god showing that he
[33:38] never offered for god he offered for
[33:40] cain
[33:42] because there's billions of people on
[33:44] this earth that make offerings to god
[33:46] and prayers and
[33:47] sacrifices and religious services and
[33:48] they never do it for god once
[33:50] they only do it for themselves because
[33:52] of their of their father
[33:54] cain nothing's changed
[33:58] everything started in genesis
[34:03] so he's a maker a fabricator a smith
[34:06] a spear a possessor
[34:15] and she says i've gotten a man from the
[34:16] lord and she again bears brother
[34:18] abel and abel was a keeper of sheep
[34:22] cain was the tiller of the ground abel
[34:25] means breath
[34:27] or life able means breath
[34:30] or life when god breathed in the
[34:33] nostrils
[34:34] of of adam he became a living soul
[34:37] and then the breath of god brings life
[34:40] so his name
[34:40] his name means breath
[34:44] and it says here
[34:48] abel was the keeper of the sheep but
[34:50] cain was a tiller of the ground
[34:52] and this word tiller means to work or to
[34:55] serve
[34:56] to labor to work to do work to work for
[35:00] another serve another by labor to serve
[35:02] as subjects oh my goodness
[35:06] cain in trying to acquire cain and
[35:10] trying to have amen cain and trying to
[35:13] have a better offering to have a better
[35:14] church to have a better sacrifice
[35:17] and we'll find out as we follow cain's
[35:19] life down he was always trying to
[35:20] do better have more win more
[35:25] and so in in trying to do this he
[35:28] becomes
[35:28] a subject or a servant to the earth
[35:35] this is important he becomes a subject
[35:38] or a servant to the earth
[35:39] or i would say to worldliness
[35:44] to the earth and let's just keep going
[35:47] and let's look at this
[35:51] because he says in genesis 3 17 and unto
[35:53] adam he said
[35:54] because thou hast hearken unto the voice
[35:56] of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of
[35:57] which i commanded thee saying
[35:59] thou shall not eat of it cursed is the
[36:01] ground for thy sake
[36:03] and sorrow shalt thou eat it all the
[36:05] days of thy life so
[36:07] what is cain attracted to cain is
[36:10] attracted to the very thing that was
[36:12] cursed and he's working
[36:15] and toiling and laboring and serving
[36:18] the curse
[36:18] [Music]
[36:21] just like all cain's children are
[36:23] serving the curse
[36:25] just like we came to this earth and we
[36:27] were no different we were serving the
[36:29] curse until we were liberated by grace
[36:33] we were toiling amen we were laboring we
[36:36] were serving the curse
[36:38] and now the ground is cursed amen in the
[36:41] very place
[36:42] that cain goes to make his occupation is
[36:45] right to the place that god has cursed
[36:49] nothing's changed friends everything's
[36:53] the same
[36:54] what's the attraction amen why is he
[36:56] there amen and
[36:57] he begins to work in that curse and in
[36:59] that cursive place and the ground that
[37:01] had been cursed for adam's sake
[37:03] and he begins to find in their materials
[37:05] that will advance his own desire
[37:08] he begins to find the materials the
[37:10] things that he needs
[37:12] amen to accomplish his own purpose
[37:16] but not so with abel genesis 3
[37:19] 21 unto adam also and to his wife did
[37:22] the lord god make
[37:23] coats of skins and clothe them
[37:27] where did the coats of skins come from
[37:30] from a lamb prophet of god told us
[37:33] he slew a lamb he clothed them in a lamb
[37:36] why was abel attracted to the sheep
[37:42] why was abel a keeper of the flocks
[37:47] why cain was a tiller of the soil it had
[37:50] been cursed
[37:51] amen but but as the ground was cursed
[37:54] amen and men fall into ruin
[37:55] god was going to offer a substitute
[37:57] sacrifice to cover their sins
[37:59] to cover their neckiness and he would
[38:01] take a lamb and he would slay an
[38:03] innocent lamb and he would take the skin
[38:05] of the lamb and he would clothe
[38:06] his son and his son's wife in the lamb
[38:09] so that he could cover their sins so he
[38:11] wouldn't have to destroy them
[38:13] and he was taking a substitute sacrifice
[38:15] and he was sending them out
[38:17] now clothed with a bloody lamb and they
[38:19] were going out clothed with the blood of
[38:22] the lamb
[38:22] and when these boys decided to pick
[38:24] their occupations
[38:26] one went to the cursed ground to dig for
[38:28] possession and gain
[38:30] to fabricate in the way and one would
[38:32] not manipulate god's creation
[38:35] all he did was take care of it
[38:38] he took care of it he looked after it he
[38:41] fed it
[38:42] he wasn't manipulating it he wasn't
[38:44] changing it he wasn't changing the way
[38:46] it was fashioned he wasn't
[38:47] digging around in it and reconstructing
[38:49] it for his own good
[38:51] he wasn't pulling out elements that
[38:52] would satisfy his desire
[38:54] all he was doing was taking amen that
[38:56] manifestation of the word of a
[38:58] substitute lamb
[38:59] and he became a shepherd to look after
[39:02] that word
[39:06] to look after it to care for it amen to
[39:09] be a guide and a
[39:10] a worker for it to sustain it to feed it
[39:13] to
[39:14] nurture it and abel now is attracted to
[39:17] the sheep
[39:18] amen and you see that god had made
[39:20] garments for his children
[39:22] but you think about the boys as they
[39:23] come out amen they become
[39:25] infants and and now amen we know that
[39:28] clothing had originated and they start
[39:30] to wear clothes and
[39:31] and they start to grow up and now you
[39:34] wonder
[39:34] uh cane what what would adam
[39:38] and eve have made their garments out of
[39:41] they
[39:42] already tried the vegetation and that
[39:44] was cursed that didn't work
[39:46] so so this is just brother chad but i
[39:49] would think that they would repeat what
[39:51] god did
[39:52] [Applause]
[39:53] and adam knew what the covering was and
[39:56] he would cover his boys
[40:00] one was his one was just living in the
[40:03] house
[40:04] and so abel abel year after year he was
[40:08] experiencing this covering amen and mom
[40:12] and dad have to be covered
[40:13] and all of a sudden it's important that
[40:15] we're covered and it's necessary
[40:17] that a lamb is covering us and and all
[40:19] of a sudden
[40:20] abel i mean there's something attractive
[40:23] in this to
[40:23] able and abel's attracted to the sheep
[40:26] he's not attracted to the cursed ground
[40:28] he's not looking to build a bigger
[40:30] kingdom he's not looking to gain or
[40:32] possess
[40:33] he's not all he's doing is taking care
[40:35] of what god has provided for his
[40:37] covering
[40:38] he may not understand it all yet but
[40:40] he's experiencing it
[40:41] he's covered in it it's covering for him
[40:44] amen as his
[40:45] dad sees that it's important that you're
[40:47] covered in this lamb
[40:48] and now he's going to take care of the
[40:50] thing that's covering him
[40:52] the thing he's interested is the thing
[40:54] that's covering him because we're
[40:56] clothed in the word amen
[40:57] the spotless word and the righteous word
[40:59] of god and now the able
[41:01] nature amen is a shepherd nature who's
[41:04] caring for the very
[41:06] thing that's covering him
[41:09] the the the thing that covers him was
[41:11] the lamb so now he's going to take care
[41:13] of the lamb
[41:15] because the thing that covers us and
[41:17] washes us and purifies us
[41:19] and removes sin from us is the blood of
[41:21] the lamb it's the lamb it's the life of
[41:23] the lamb it's the word of the lamb
[41:25] the lamb is the word and now
[41:28] we become shepherds of the word
[41:31] we love the word amen not the cursed
[41:34] world not the curse of earth but we love
[41:36] this thing that's covering us
[41:38] we love this thing that is a substitute
[41:40] for me the thing that covered for me
[41:42] paid my price covered my sin is the
[41:45] thing that i'm going to give all my life
[41:47] to
[41:47] and i'm not going to change it
[41:48] manipulate it force it all i'm going to
[41:50] do is care for it
[41:52] [Music]
[41:52] [Applause]
[41:54] because the life of a shepherd amen is
[41:56] different amen
[41:57] than that of a cattle herder he's not
[42:00] driving he's leading he's caring for
[42:03] amen there's a relationship between the
[42:05] shepherd and the sheep where the sheep
[42:07] trust the shepherd and the shepherd
[42:08] cares for the sheep
[42:09] and he earns the trust by loving tender
[42:11] care
[42:14] so abel is not a manipulator
[42:19] he's not a rearranger he takes what god
[42:23] provided
[42:24] and he leaves it the way god provided it
[42:27] he doesn't try to cross-feed the sheep
[42:29] with the donkey
[42:32] you get what i'm saying no manipulation
[42:36] but cain is not satisfied with the way
[42:39] things are
[42:40] the spoken word spoke to earth into
[42:42] existence
[42:44] amen but he's not satisfied with it the
[42:47] way it is
[42:48] there's things that he wants out of it
[42:52] so he'll get his theological degree
[42:56] in metallurgy so that he can
[42:59] dig around in that spoken word of god
[43:05] he can move it around and turn it here
[43:08] and
[43:08] set it aside here so they can pull out
[43:11] what
[43:12] he wants to serve his own purpose
[43:15] for his own plans i just explained every
[43:19] denomination that's ever been formed
[43:22] everything started in genesis
[43:28] praise god now you know why my little
[43:31] bible study got really fun
[43:36] and cain went out from the presence of
[43:38] the lord and
[43:40] dwelt in the land of nod on the east of
[43:42] eden
[43:43] he was cursed he said my curse is too
[43:44] great for me and the lord put a seal on
[43:47] mark
[43:47] the mark of the beast and he went out
[43:51] from the presence of the lord from the
[43:52] face of the lord
[43:53] he left the presence of the lord amen
[43:56] because
[43:56] i mean cain may have felt mistreated he
[43:59] may
[44:00] misjudged but he had an opportunity to
[44:03] stay and he did not want to take his
[44:04] opportunity
[44:06] god was not unjust god was not
[44:08] unrighteous god was not
[44:10] he lacked no mercy but cain didn't want
[44:13] the word
[44:15] cain did not want the word of god he
[44:18] could not line up with the word of god
[44:20] he did not want to obey the word of god
[44:22] he did not want to humble himself to the
[44:24] word of god
[44:25] so he was cast out and went out of the
[44:27] presence of god
[44:30] now listen listen close he went out from
[44:34] the presence of god he was no longer in
[44:36] the praise of
[44:37] presence of god no longer before the
[44:39] face of god
[44:40] but he never stopped his religious
[44:43] worship
[44:46] his religious worship didn't diminish
[44:48] one
[44:49] drop it continued on as before because
[44:52] he was satisfied with his way of worship
[44:57] even though it was rejected by god even
[44:59] though god brought a correction upon it
[45:01] now he's not even before the face of god
[45:03] not even in the presence of god he's
[45:05] gone out from the presence of god
[45:06] but he continues his religious worship
[45:09] proving that religion is not for god
[45:12] religion is for man
[45:15] i can say that across the board religion
[45:18] is to serve
[45:20] man's own desire
[45:23] because cain was ultra religious and his
[45:26] descendants were ultra-religious
[45:28] so he never stopped worship he never
[45:31] stopped religion
[45:32] he only left the presence of the lord
[45:34] because cain's form of religion doesn't
[45:36] require the word or the presence of god
[45:43] that's why when the presence of god left
[45:45] every revival they continued on with
[45:47] religion
[45:51] because their man's religion doesn't
[45:53] need the presence of god
[45:55] to continue on or to satisfy
[45:58] the cravings of man
[46:02] think think about it it won't satisfy
[46:04] the cravings of a seed no way
[46:07] but the cravings of a man can be
[46:09] satisfied by man's religion
[46:15] that's a mouthful friends there's a
[46:17] little bible study about cain and abel
[46:19] but this is deep
[46:21] this is deep because this is everything
[46:23] started in genesis the problem now
[46:25] started in genesis what started in
[46:26] genesis continues the day
[46:28] those two vines go out we're still
[46:30] dealing with the same spirits the same
[46:32] attitude the same natures
[46:36] so he went to the land of nod
[46:39] on the east of eden and nod means
[46:43] wondering he has no direction
[46:46] no foundation no word he's not placed
[46:49] he's not positioned he's not elected
[46:51] he's not called he's not chosen he's now
[46:54] wandering
[46:55] and in his wandering he's wandering
[46:58] to make his own way now he's wondering
[47:01] without the word of god
[47:03] without the word of god when you've left
[47:04] the presence of god and without the word
[47:06] of god you're wondering
[47:09] and now he begins to make his own way
[47:14] chapter 4 verse 16 and cain went out
[47:16] from the presence of the lord and
[47:17] dwelt in the land of nod on the east of
[47:18] eden and cain knew his wife and she
[47:21] conceived and bear enoch
[47:22] and he builded a city and called the
[47:25] name of the city after the name of his
[47:27] son
[47:27] enoch
[47:30] i'll ask you a question it may have come
[47:33] obvious by now
[47:35] where did he get the materials to build
[47:37] a city
[47:40] where did they come from
[47:43] the earth when he was digging around
[47:49] when he was fabricating and fashioning
[47:51] and making and serving the world amen
[47:54] when he's down there toiling for his own
[47:55] gain
[47:56] he come across materials amen and as he
[47:59] went on
[48:00] he went out of the presence of the lord
[48:02] to wander amen but he doesn't want to
[48:04] wander he wants to establish something
[48:07] you don't build a city to wander you
[48:09] build a city to establish yourself
[48:12] so he was sent out to the land of
[48:14] wandering but in the land of wandering
[48:16] he's digging around
[48:17] amen and that spoken word of god amen
[48:20] that
[48:20] now he's dealing now with the
[48:22] worldliness that's been cursed
[48:24] and now he's manipulating and changing
[48:26] and twisting and as he's digging around
[48:28] he's
[48:28] finding elements and pieces that he'll
[48:31] build his own city with
[48:34] because man in his religion will dig
[48:36] around in the word of god
[48:38] and he'll find something and twist it
[48:39] and refashion it so he can build his own
[48:41] denominational walls
[48:44] so he can build his own religion so he
[48:45] can build his own church so he can have
[48:47] his own city because he doesn't want to
[48:49] be a wanderer he wants to be established
[48:51] and in order to get established he's got
[48:53] to be digging down
[48:54] amen in the earth and finding what he
[48:57] wants to serve his own purpose
[48:58] because they don't take all the word
[49:00] they only take those portions that they
[49:02] want to serve their own purpose
[49:05] and then they'll smith it they'll
[49:08] fabricate it they'll smith it
[49:10] amen they'll heat it and they'll twist
[49:13] it and they'll beat it and
[49:14] they'll they'll hammer it and they'll
[49:15] stretch it and they'll carve bricks and
[49:17] they'll bake bricks and make
[49:19] all the things that they need to make to
[49:21] take out of the earth
[49:23] what was originally god's spoken word
[49:25] amen now fallen under a curse because
[49:27] man lost his right to the word
[49:31] now digging out of there
[49:35] to find elements to satisfy his own
[49:38] purpose
[49:39] and to establish his own city
[49:43] oh the bible's good amen
[49:47] deception is leaving the bride the
[49:49] bible's been opened up
[49:50] now we can see christ are you seeing
[49:52] christ in every line
[49:54] [Music]
[49:56] amen so it's not to be deceived again
[50:02] now abel he's been
[50:06] killed he's off the scene
[50:11] i'll say it this way
[50:14] he was the righteous seed he was the
[50:18] lineage of adam the son of god
[50:21] he could receive the revelation of the
[50:24] word and he could act upon it he could
[50:25] believe
[50:26] it he was righteous because of that
[50:34] but he was killed because
[50:38] cain and cain's descendants the serpent
[50:41] seed always destroys the righteous seed
[50:44] the tares always persecute the wheat
[50:47] they always try to stop the voice
[50:49] so that they can be the only voice
[50:52] the voice of the city the voice of the
[50:54] great walled city
[50:59] but abel is cut off i'll say it this way
[51:03] let me just say it this way who shall
[51:06] declare his generation for he was cut
[51:08] off from the land of the living
[51:11] does that sound familiar cain the
[51:14] serpent seed
[51:15] the hybrid the false he killed the
[51:18] shepherd of the flock
[51:21] before the shepherd of the flock could
[51:23] marry
[51:24] and bring forth seed it says who shall
[51:27] declare his generation for he was cut
[51:29] off from the land of the living
[51:30] now will god let it go this way will it
[51:32] stop the rights of the firstborn have
[51:34] stopped with abel abel's been cut off
[51:36] from the land of the living
[51:37] jesus christ came as the great shepherd
[51:39] of the flock amen and he was cut off
[51:41] from the land of the living
[51:43] before he could marry before he could
[51:44] bring forth seed
[51:50] keep reading let's keep going with with
[51:52] with
[51:53] kane's line and unto enoch was born arad
[51:57] and arad begat
[51:59] mahujao and mahuja begotten methuselah
[52:01] methuselah
[52:02] begot lamech and lamech took unto him
[52:05] two wives
[52:06] the name of the one was ada the name of
[52:08] the other zela
[52:09] so now through this false line comes
[52:13] comes a man who takes two wives
[52:18] does it come from it comes right here
[52:21] because once you start manipulating the
[52:23] word and going your own way there's no
[52:25] end to it
[52:29] so now in ada bear jabul he was the
[52:32] father of such as dwell in tents and
[52:33] such as have cattle
[52:35] and his brother's name was jubal he was
[52:37] the father of all such as handle the
[52:38] harp in oregon
[52:40] and zela she also bear tubal kane an
[52:42] instructor of
[52:43] every artificer and brass and iron and
[52:46] the sister tubal cane
[52:47] was nehemiah so now we're following
[52:50] canes lying down
[52:51] and as cane lines go down they all keep
[52:54] digging in the dirt not to plant a cute
[52:58] little vegetable garden and a few little
[53:00] flowers they're digging around there to
[53:02] make their instruments for music
[53:04] to make their instruments for war
[53:06] [Music]
[53:10] and so now there's three brothers born
[53:12] there's two wives
[53:13] there's the the the two sons are jabal
[53:17] jubal jabel jubal and tubal
[53:20] cain does that sound familiar is there a
[53:24] ring to that
[53:25] jabel jubal
[53:29] the reason it has that ring is they all
[53:31] come from the same root word
[53:34] and that root word means like like jabel
[53:37] and jubal have the same meaning for the
[53:39] name it means a stream
[53:41] or a river
[53:45] and now jabel and jubal and tubal
[53:49] came they they all have the same root
[53:51] murder means
[53:52] to to usher forth or to move along
[53:56] and now the seed and nature of cain
[54:00] the civilization of cain the progress of
[54:03] cain the science of cain
[54:05] through these three boys you can see in
[54:07] their name is now
[54:08] ushering along or moving along
[54:13] and they they are the ones that raise
[54:15] cattle
[54:17] ones that handle the harp and the organ
[54:20] see scientific achievement they're
[54:23] beginning to grow
[54:24] and increase and they're beginning to
[54:26] farm amen not just
[54:28] substance living but they're beginning
[54:29] to farm they're beginning to have music
[54:32] play the harp and play the organ and
[54:34] tubal kane
[54:35] becomes an instructor or this means a
[54:38] hammer or or a smelter of every
[54:41] artificer
[54:42] metalwork and brass and iron and the
[54:45] sister tubal kane was nama
[54:47] so now you can see what cain started his
[54:50] lineage continues to do
[54:53] because you'll always be like your
[54:55] father
[54:56] spiritually speaking that's why your
[55:00] father better be god
[55:02] and if your father is god you'll be like
[55:05] god
[55:07] so there's two vines moving down now
[55:10] abel's is cut off
[55:11] nothing's happening there amen but now
[55:14] this there's a propagation of cain's
[55:16] line
[55:16] he's already built one city after his
[55:19] first son was born and he named the city
[55:21] after the first son
[55:22] but now under that city under that
[55:25] building of structures and walls and
[55:27] cities and religion and worship
[55:28] and all science and all the achievement
[55:30] now they're achieving where they can
[55:32] make
[55:32] instruments and they make organs and
[55:34] play music and listen friends
[55:36] this means that there's a society a
[55:39] culture that's already building
[55:41] amen because if you have to go hunt your
[55:43] rabbit eat your rabbit go the next day
[55:45] hunt your rabbit eat your rabbit
[55:47] you don't have time to learn how to
[55:48] build instruments and learn how to play
[55:50] instruments
[55:51] amen and learn how to work in brass and
[55:53] work work in metal
[55:55] this shows the fact that they had time
[55:58] amen to
[55:59] dedicate themselves to make musical
[56:01] instruments and learn to play the
[56:02] musical instruments amen and grow their
[56:04] herds and flocks
[56:05] and build and dig out the materials to
[56:08] make brass
[56:09] dig out iron to to melt it down to smelt
[56:12] it to fashion it to make the tools to
[56:14] work with
[56:14] hey listen this this somebody somebody
[56:17] was supporting this work
[56:20] so we come to a place there's already a
[56:22] civilization established
[56:24] there's already cities we know at least
[56:26] one city upon the earth there's already
[56:28] wisdom there's already knowledge there's
[56:30] there's a lot of digging there's a lot
[56:32] of tilling in the earth that's going on
[56:34] friends
[56:36] and they're all earthly minded
[56:39] the whole line is carnal
[56:42] earthly worldly minded
[56:47] i i wanna i wanna say something
[56:53] it's not bad to have a garden
[57:00] i don't want to be a tiller of the soil
[57:03] i'm going to stop gardening and buy a
[57:04] sheep
[57:07] this tilling in the soil is not like you
[57:09] planting your vegetable garden
[57:12] this is totally different i hope you can
[57:15] see there's one line
[57:17] that's willing to manipulate twist
[57:19] refashion
[57:21] separate remake for their own gain
[57:26] and abel's line abel he was just
[57:30] willing to take it the way god gave it
[57:32] and just care for it
[57:35] accept it the way it was and care for it
[57:38] do you see the two lines
[57:44] and lamech said unto his wives aydah and
[57:46] zila
[57:48] hear my voice you wives are lamech
[57:50] hearken into my speech for i have slain
[57:52] a man
[57:52] to my wounding
[57:56] a young man to my hurt if cain shall be
[57:59] avenged sevenfold truly lamech 70
[58:02] and sevenfold who told him that
[58:06] was that the word of the lord did god
[58:08] tell him that or did he just take it
[58:10] upon himself
[58:11] to take amen a blessing or a protection
[58:15] and just put it upon himself
[58:18] didn't wait for the lord didn't hear
[58:20] from the lord just said well if he does
[58:22] it for cain
[58:22] surely if it's going to be that way then
[58:24] surely for me to be this way
[58:26] but if you look now cain was a murderer
[58:29] from the beginning and now in his
[58:30] lineage there's more killing
[58:34] and what do you think they're doing with
[58:35] all that iron and brass
[58:39] what do you think they're doing with all
[58:40] that iron breath you'll find out as you
[58:42] move down through
[58:42] that this lineage moves all the way to
[58:44] cush amen from ham to cush
[58:46] all the way to nimrod and nimrod becomes
[58:48] a mighty hunter before the lord and then
[58:50] he becomes great and strong on the earth
[58:52] and he begins to he begins to work all
[58:54] of these
[58:55] instruments amen into warfare and he
[58:57] begins to conquer and destroy
[58:59] and gather a one-world religion and a
[59:01] one-world government
[59:03] you think you think it's just a modern
[59:05] day idea
[59:06] to bring all the nations and all the
[59:08] religion together it was done in genesis
[59:10] if it wasn't done in genesis it couldn't
[59:11] be done today
[59:12] but it's being done today because it
[59:14] started in genesis
[59:18] under nimrod and he used tools of war
[59:20] and he uses scientific achievement and
[59:22] he uses music
[59:23] and religion and warfare and economics
[59:28] because that all comes with civilization
[59:30] amen and he's using
[59:32] economics he's using he's using his
[59:34] might and his power
[59:35] he's using warfare he's using science
[59:38] he's using music he's using religion
[59:40] and he's pulling all the world together
[59:43] this is the lineage that comes from cain
[59:45] when cain started digging around
[59:48] in the earth
[59:52] but what about abel abel was cut off
[59:56] from the land of the living
[59:58] who shall declare his generation he's
[1:00:00] the type of jesus christ
[1:00:03] the shepherd of the flock who died upon
[1:00:05] his own altar
[1:00:07] brother said died with his sacrifice
[1:00:11] genesis 4 25 and adam knew his wife
[1:00:14] again and she bear a son and called his
[1:00:15] name
[1:00:16] seth for god said she hath appointed me
[1:00:19] another seed instead of
[1:00:20] abel whom cain slew so now
[1:00:24] now there's coming forth another one out
[1:00:26] of
[1:00:27] out of adam another son seth is coming
[1:00:30] forth and
[1:00:31] she appointed me she says he appointed
[1:00:33] me another seed instead of abel
[1:00:36] and the name seth from the concordance
[1:00:38] means compensation
[1:00:40] compensation but it's from the word if
[1:00:43] you look there in yellow from the word
[1:00:45] 78
[1:00:46] 78 96 so that's the root word it's
[1:00:49] coming out of that means to set to
[1:00:52] station to a point to fix
[1:00:54] to set mine to so
[1:00:57] god is going to place a seed
[1:01:02] a point position of seed it's not just
[1:01:05] a happen chance it's not just a hope so
[1:01:08] it's not going to
[1:01:09] be the efforts of adam and his wife but
[1:01:12] god
[1:01:13] is going to a point he's going to
[1:01:14] compensate amen he's going to compensate
[1:01:17] for the loss of abel because abel was
[1:01:19] cut off
[1:01:19] now he's going to bring seth and he's
[1:01:21] going to place and position
[1:01:23] and put seth in place because the seed
[1:01:25] is always placed
[1:01:27] we've been placed because we're the seed
[1:01:31] and then she says go to the point of me
[1:01:33] another seed
[1:01:34] it's important that she says that
[1:01:36] because brother branham picks up on
[1:01:37] these words another seed
[1:01:38] and the definition of compensation and
[1:01:41] appointment
[1:01:42] and and fixing and he begins to the talk
[1:01:45] about this
[1:01:46] now he says in the message mark of the
[1:01:49] beast and the seal of god
[1:01:50] but however we find that cain then went
[1:01:53] away from god
[1:01:55] and took himself a wife out of another
[1:01:56] group in the land of god and that
[1:01:58] exactly what the man does that will not
[1:02:00] come up and worship god in spirit and
[1:02:02] truth
[1:02:03] he goes off and gets him a church that
[1:02:05] will satisfy him
[1:02:08] you thought cain just found a wife
[1:02:12] he went and got a church that would
[1:02:14] satisfy him he wasn't satisfied with
[1:02:16] god's form of worship
[1:02:19] goes off but remember seth was a type
[1:02:22] abel being the one that was killed
[1:02:24] seth took his place was a sign of the
[1:02:26] death burial
[1:02:27] resurrection of the lord placed back
[1:02:30] again
[1:02:32] god was not going to let it fall and
[1:02:34] ruin he was typing out the very life of
[1:02:36] jesus christ in the story of redemption
[1:02:39] amen and cain slew abel but god was not
[1:02:42] going to let that lineage stay cut off
[1:02:44] amen but he was going to bring a type of
[1:02:46] resurrection amen he was going to
[1:02:48] appoint
[1:02:49] another seed amen a compensation a
[1:02:52] replacement
[1:02:52] to come back a resurrection brother
[1:02:55] brenham said a return to the righteous
[1:02:57] seed
[1:02:57] and if seth comes back amen and he's a
[1:03:00] resurrection
[1:03:01] if he's a restoration amen he's going to
[1:03:04] have to have the very
[1:03:05] same nature that abel had
[1:03:08] and if abel was a shepherd what do you
[1:03:11] think seth is going to be
[1:03:13] he's going to be a shepherd if abel was
[1:03:15] interested in keeping the sheep
[1:03:17] seth is going to be interested in
[1:03:18] keeping the sheep because now
[1:03:20] this is a resurrection of the seed
[1:03:24] this is going to mean a lot in a few
[1:03:26] minutes
[1:03:28] hopefully brother venom says and
[1:03:32] i got a quote here i'll read on my notes
[1:03:35] and questions and answers
[1:03:36] from 64. now we'll notice in the third
[1:03:39] chapter of luke we get the same thing
[1:03:40] which sons
[1:03:42] and so forth and noah noah which were
[1:03:44] laymaking
[1:03:45] which also sons of methuselah which also
[1:03:47] the son of enoch which was the son of
[1:03:49] jared which was the son of
[1:03:51] leo which was the son of canaan which
[1:03:53] was the son of enos which was the son of
[1:03:54] seth
[1:03:55] which was the son of adam which was the
[1:03:57] son of god where did cain come in
[1:03:59] where's cain at the firstborn the birth
[1:04:01] writes to him where'd he come from
[1:04:03] he was satan's seed and not gods wasn't
[1:04:06] adam's
[1:04:06] either because adam's son was was seth
[1:04:10] cain the serpent seed slew his first son
[1:04:12] which was a type and shadow of the
[1:04:14] serpent
[1:04:14] also slaying his other son jesus and
[1:04:17] seth took his place in the genealogies
[1:04:20] which meant the resurrection that the
[1:04:22] genealogies of god
[1:04:23] would completely be carried on
[1:04:28] amen the genealogies of god
[1:04:31] will completely be carried on now let's
[1:04:34] go back to that scripture
[1:04:35] in isaiah 53 he says he was cut off who
[1:04:38] shall declare his generation for he was
[1:04:40] cut off from the land of the living
[1:04:42] let's turn to matthew don't lose your
[1:04:44] place in genesis we'll come back
[1:04:45] let's go to matthew chapter one
[1:04:54] in matthew chapter 1 it begins going
[1:04:56] through the genealogies
[1:04:58] starting over with abraham and moving us
[1:05:01] down through but we go to verse 17
[1:05:04] matthew 1 and 17 says so all the
[1:05:06] generations from abraham to david
[1:05:08] are 14 generations
[1:05:12] amen and from david until the carrying
[1:05:14] away into babylon are 14 generations
[1:05:16] from the caring way into babylon unto
[1:05:18] christ are 14
[1:05:20] generations but you see friends when you
[1:05:24] sit down and
[1:05:25] count that last one is only
[1:05:28] 13 generations because he was cut off
[1:05:32] from the land of the living
[1:05:33] who shall declare his generation it's
[1:05:36] the key is in the resurrection
[1:05:39] because in the resurrection abel went
[1:05:42] down
[1:05:42] one form but in the resurrection abel
[1:05:44] came up another form
[1:05:48] same seed appointed seed brother graham
[1:05:50] calls it a type of the resurrection of
[1:05:52] jesus christ he comes back in another
[1:05:53] form
[1:05:54] amen and he comes back on the day of
[1:05:56] pentecost as the holy ghost to live
[1:05:57] inside a people amen and they're going
[1:05:59] to declare his generation but they never
[1:06:02] finished that purpose amen they went
[1:06:03] into ruin because there's going to be a
[1:06:05] seed at the last time
[1:06:06] there's going to be a resurrection of
[1:06:08] the word there's going to be a
[1:06:09] restoration of the bride
[1:06:10] and she's going to come back and she is
[1:06:12] going to unite with christ
[1:06:14] and bring forth the promised side and be
[1:06:15] a declaration of the missing generation
[1:06:18] of christ
[1:06:19] because christ is male and female when
[1:06:21] they come together they'll reproduce the
[1:06:23] son of man
[1:06:24] [Music]
[1:06:25] we saw in the prophet we saw that
[1:06:28] missing generation coming forth in that
[1:06:30] prophet
[1:06:32] praise be the god that's what
[1:06:35] abel being killed and seth coming back
[1:06:37] in the resurrection all notes
[1:06:39] and it all has something to do with you
[1:06:40] and i uniting with christ
[1:06:42] amen and bringing forth the the promised
[1:06:44] son which is the word in full measure in
[1:06:46] this day
[1:06:48] who will declare his generation for
[1:06:50] who's cut off from the land of the
[1:06:51] living
[1:06:51] i'll say by god's grace i'll declare his
[1:06:53] generation if he can unite with me and
[1:06:56] bring his word through me
[1:06:57] and the son can be on display through me
[1:06:59] amen the promised sign on display in my
[1:07:01] life with my actions and my conduct and
[1:07:04] my words
[1:07:04] i'll declare his generation i'll
[1:07:06] volunteer for the job
[1:07:08] let it be me and let me come back in the
[1:07:10] resurrection with the same nature
[1:07:12] safe seth picked up right where abel
[1:07:14] left off abel was a keeper of the sheep
[1:07:16] seth was a keeper of the sheep
[1:07:19] seth wasn't tilling around in the ground
[1:07:21] he wasn't manipulating the word he
[1:07:23] wasn't building
[1:07:24] cities amen he was just a humble simple
[1:07:27] farmer and herdsmen is what brother
[1:07:29] branham said
[1:07:31] he says it this way mark of the beast
[1:07:34] and the seal of god part two but
[1:07:36] however we find that cain then went away
[1:07:38] from god and took himself a wife oh i
[1:07:40] already read that sorry
[1:07:41] in the ephesian church age night from
[1:07:44] when he preached it not from the church
[1:07:45] age book when he preached in 1960
[1:07:47] says she brought forth her first son
[1:07:49] which was cain is that right
[1:07:51] the son of satan son of satan if they
[1:07:53] didn't where'd that evil come from
[1:07:55] out of adam which was the son of god
[1:07:57] come from the devil his father
[1:07:59] and he murdered first murderer was the
[1:08:01] devil the devil's son
[1:08:02] watch what happened after that watch the
[1:08:04] lineage of cain on down through the
[1:08:06] generation that followed after cain was
[1:08:08] every one
[1:08:09] and great men read the bible they built
[1:08:11] houses they worked with metal they were
[1:08:13] scientists
[1:08:15] but every one that come from seth which
[1:08:17] abel died
[1:08:18] a type of jesus died and abel died and
[1:08:20] seth took his place
[1:08:22] death burial and resurrection from his
[1:08:24] come
[1:08:25] humble peasant sheep herders come down
[1:08:28] through that
[1:08:29] so what kind of nature should you have
[1:08:32] if you're declaring that generation
[1:08:34] amen what kind of you should have the
[1:08:36] same nature
[1:08:37] that the first shepherd had amen and
[1:08:39] what did he do he took care of the word
[1:08:41] he didn't manipulate it he didn't twist
[1:08:43] it he didn't change it
[1:08:44] he just took care of it and we're here
[1:08:48] to take care
[1:08:49] of the very thing that's covering us
[1:08:51] amen remember rebecca when eleazar come
[1:08:53] to rebecca
[1:08:54] amen he said he said the one that waters
[1:08:56] the camels amen the one that waters the
[1:08:59] camels that'll be the one who is that
[1:09:00] the one that takes care of the beast
[1:09:02] that will take her to isaac
[1:09:04] the one that cares for the word the
[1:09:06] anointing that's going to take us all
[1:09:07] the way to isaac
[1:09:08] that one that cares not just for me but
[1:09:11] also cares for the very mechanism that
[1:09:14] will take them back to the promised son
[1:09:16] that's the one that i'm looking for
[1:09:20] what was the big deal with camels amen
[1:09:22] amen it showed amen that she was going
[1:09:24] to water
[1:09:25] the very power amen that was going to
[1:09:27] get her back into her position
[1:09:30] and this bride today she's going to care
[1:09:32] for the word she's not going to
[1:09:33] manipulate the word
[1:09:34] twist the word fashion it to her own
[1:09:36] liking change it for her own purposes
[1:09:39] she's just going to take care of it
[1:09:41] watch after it
[1:09:42] nurture it love it care for it
[1:09:49] brother brahm said in the god of this
[1:09:51] evil age
[1:09:54] he said it's noteworthy watch seth's
[1:09:56] children never went the scientific route
[1:09:59] they were humble herdsmen farmers and so
[1:10:01] forth
[1:10:03] now listen brother brandon's not saying
[1:10:05] it's wrong to learn anything he has
[1:10:07] children in school they learn science
[1:10:09] that's not what he's saying he's he's
[1:10:10] actually typing this with intellectual
[1:10:13] religion
[1:10:15] so like if you do work with science
[1:10:19] that doesn't put you in the wrong seat
[1:10:22] some of you are engineers i mean we'd be
[1:10:25] in bad shape friends
[1:10:28] but brother venomous actually when he
[1:10:29] starts showing science he's what he's
[1:10:31] doing when brother
[1:10:32] was talking about sciences of the devil
[1:10:34] amen brother brahma says god's god of
[1:10:36] science
[1:10:38] but when he says sciences of the devil
[1:10:40] he's showing
[1:10:41] man's desire to manipulate what god made
[1:10:44] for his own purposes of the devil
[1:10:48] man's desire to understand knowledge
[1:10:51] outside of god's word
[1:10:52] is of the devil that's what brother
[1:10:56] branham is talking about
[1:10:58] so you can teach your kids science it's
[1:11:00] okay
[1:11:05] they were humble herdsmen farmers and so
[1:11:07] forth but cain's children did why
[1:11:08] inspired by their daddy the devil cain
[1:11:11] inspired by his daddy the devil
[1:11:12] he's inspired by the seed coming down
[1:11:16] watch the seed of god coming down
[1:11:18] through every age watch where it's
[1:11:19] heading
[1:11:20] up today christians genuine christians
[1:11:22] are not all about scientific research
[1:11:24] and stuff no
[1:11:25] just a minute we'll get into that but
[1:11:27] cain did after the nature of their
[1:11:29] father the devil full of worldly
[1:11:31] knowledge beauty science so forth
[1:11:33] cain's children was scientific they were
[1:11:35] educated
[1:11:36] they was the players of music
[1:11:38] instruments modern elvis presley
[1:11:40] some of the stuff that they the school
[1:11:42] board lets happen up there in the lane
[1:11:43] every saturday night builders of city
[1:11:45] beautifying of women for personal lusts
[1:11:49] as the devil giving women paint and
[1:11:51] bobbing their hair and putting them in
[1:11:53] shorts and things like that
[1:11:54] it's it's for his own dirty lusts
[1:11:58] that's pretty flat but i don't know any
[1:12:00] other way to say it
[1:12:02] that's coming from a simple herdsman
[1:12:06] the message time of decision the prophet
[1:12:08] of god says watch them house cain's
[1:12:10] people and them cess people death of
[1:12:12] abel
[1:12:12] and the coming of seth was the death and
[1:12:15] resurrection of christ
[1:12:16] watch how them two lineages run them two
[1:12:18] streams of blood
[1:12:20] the sight of cain became smart men
[1:12:22] scientists educated scholars
[1:12:23] the other side were humble peasants they
[1:12:26] tempered iron
[1:12:27] and made metal and great builders a
[1:12:30] great builder science
[1:12:31] very very religious
[1:12:35] still running the same way see how it
[1:12:37] how it is no wonder jesus said it would
[1:12:39] deceive the very elect if possible
[1:12:41] watch them true trees coming up through
[1:12:43] eden
[1:12:45] what's he saying watch them two trees
[1:12:48] coming up to eden
[1:12:52] so we find out
[1:12:56] that abel went down and seth came back
[1:13:01] and he came back with the very same
[1:13:02] nature
[1:13:04] he didn't come to build himself cities
[1:13:08] he didn't come to build instruments of
[1:13:09] warfare for scientific achievement
[1:13:13] he came back and he was a shepherd
[1:13:16] what abel was he was well christ is we
[1:13:20] are
[1:13:23] when christ came back in the
[1:13:24] resurrection he came back with the same
[1:13:25] nature he went down
[1:13:31] let's look at ii peter together i just
[1:13:33] want to read a couple scriptures we'll
[1:13:34] go through these quickly as we wind down
[1:13:37] ii peter 1.
[1:13:44] ii peter 1 1-4
[1:13:52] second peter chapter one verse one simon
[1:13:54] peter a servant and an apostle of jesus
[1:13:56] christ to them that have obtained like
[1:13:58] precious faith with us
[1:13:59] through the righteousness of god and our
[1:14:01] savior jesus christ
[1:14:03] grace and peace be multiplied into you
[1:14:04] through the knowledge of god and of
[1:14:06] jesus our lord
[1:14:08] according as his divine power hath given
[1:14:10] unto us all things
[1:14:12] that pertain unto life and godliness
[1:14:15] through the knowledge of him that hath
[1:14:17] called us to glory
[1:14:19] and virtue i want to reread that and i
[1:14:21] want you to think about it according to
[1:14:22] his divine power
[1:14:24] hath given unto us all things that
[1:14:25] pertain unto life and godliness
[1:14:27] through the knowledge of him that hath
[1:14:29] called us to glory
[1:14:30] and virtue whereby we are given unto
[1:14:34] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:14:36] great and precious promises
[1:14:39] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:14:42] the divine nature
[1:14:44] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:14:46] the world through
[1:14:47] lust
[1:14:50] where did the corruption that's in the
[1:14:52] world come from
[1:14:54] lust why was cain digging in the ground
[1:14:59] lust abel wasn't lusting
[1:15:04] over the sheep wasn't lusting for power
[1:15:07] wasn't lusting for prestige was it
[1:15:08] lusting for knowledge was it lusting for
[1:15:11] wealth was it lusting for
[1:15:13] control he's keeping the sheep but the
[1:15:16] corruption that came in the world came
[1:15:17] in through
[1:15:18] lust lust is just
[1:15:21] a desire a desire
[1:15:25] that word is not always evil
[1:15:31] right before we go any further i want to
[1:15:34] look at two scriptures together if you
[1:15:35] can turn to matthew
[1:15:38] matthew chapter 13.
[1:15:45] i want to lay this in and then back up
[1:15:48] matthew 13
[1:15:51] and 16
[1:15:58] jesus says but blessed are your eyes for
[1:16:01] they see in your ears for they hear
[1:16:03] for verily i say unto you that many
[1:16:04] prophets and righteous men have desired
[1:16:07] hold that word desired that word is
[1:16:09] translated lust
[1:16:10] almost everywhere else but is it
[1:16:14] negative here or is it positive
[1:16:17] they have desired you could say lusted
[1:16:21] all right when we say lost as such a
[1:16:24] negative connotation so many times in
[1:16:25] scripture
[1:16:26] it's associated with negative but it's
[1:16:27] the same word
[1:16:30] desire lust in the new testament
[1:16:33] have desired to see those things which
[1:16:36] you see
[1:16:36] and not seen them and to hear those
[1:16:38] things which you hear
[1:16:39] and have not heard them let's go to luke
[1:16:42] 22
[1:16:43] just quickly
[1:16:49] i want to understand this as we move
[1:16:51] forward luke 22
[1:16:53] and verse 15.
[1:16:58] so when they had dined jesus saith unto
[1:17:00] simon simon son of jonas lowest
[1:17:02] no no no no no i'm in 21.
[1:17:06] oh i'm in john god help me
[1:17:10] 22 15.
[1:17:14] and he said unto them with desire i have
[1:17:17] desired to eat this passover with you
[1:17:19] before i suffer
[1:17:21] same word that's lust that we just read
[1:17:24] in the other scripture
[1:17:25] is with with desire i have desired to
[1:17:28] eat this passover
[1:17:31] so it's not wrong to have this desire
[1:17:35] as long as this desire is for the word
[1:17:38] of god
[1:17:40] but when this desire is for anything of
[1:17:43] self it is the thing that corrupted the
[1:17:45] world
[1:17:47] any time this kind of desire this
[1:17:49] longing
[1:17:50] this coveting this desire and this
[1:17:52] wanting any time
[1:17:54] that that kind of longing and wanting
[1:17:56] and desire
[1:17:57] comes from a self-desire a selfish from
[1:18:00] within yourself for yourself
[1:18:01] it is the very thing that's corrupted
[1:18:04] this whole world
[1:18:05] amen but when that strong desire that
[1:18:07] desire that jesus desired to eat this
[1:18:10] passover the desire the prophets had to
[1:18:12] see one of your days
[1:18:13] that's not a wrong desire that desire
[1:18:16] comes from the very heart of god
[1:18:17] and is lined right up with the word amen
[1:18:20] and that is the desire
[1:18:21] amen that abel had when he kept sheep
[1:18:23] that's the desire that seth had when he
[1:18:25] was a herdsman
[1:18:27] he had a desire to the word he had a
[1:18:29] desire to the fulfillment of the word he
[1:18:30] had a desire to care for the thing that
[1:18:32] was covering him
[1:18:35] it wasn't a selfish lust it wasn't a
[1:18:37] desire for self
[1:18:38] it wasn't a desire for gain it was a
[1:18:41] desire for god
[1:18:43] and a desire for god is godly
[1:18:49] so we have been given exceeding precious
[1:18:52] promises that by these we might partake
[1:18:54] of the divine nature
[1:18:56] the divine nature doesn't manipulate the
[1:19:00] word for self-gain
[1:19:02] the divine nature doesn't
[1:19:06] manipulate and twist the word for self
[1:19:11] the divine nature doesn't try to become
[1:19:14] bigger
[1:19:14] and better have a better denomination a
[1:19:17] better church a better city a better
[1:19:20] is not proud it's not arrogant it's not
[1:19:22] self-serving
[1:19:24] it's not manipulating it's not into
[1:19:26] warfare
[1:19:30] but it's the divine nature having
[1:19:33] escaped the corruption is in the world
[1:19:36] through lust all the way back in genesis
[1:19:40] 3
[1:19:41] and when the women saw that the tree was
[1:19:43] good for food
[1:19:46] and then it was pleasant to the eyes
[1:19:49] and a tree to be desired
[1:19:54] same meaning friends this word desired
[1:19:59] in the hebrew it means to desire
[1:20:02] covet take pleasure in or delight in
[1:20:07] when when she
[1:20:12] saw that the tree was good for food
[1:20:15] and it was pleasant to the eyes and a
[1:20:18] tree to be desired
[1:20:20] to make one wise she took her the fruit
[1:20:22] thereof and did eat
[1:20:24] and gave also into her husband with her
[1:20:26] and he did eat
[1:20:28] the corruption that came into the world
[1:20:29] came in through lust
[1:20:31] because all of this appealed to her
[1:20:36] it appealed to her desire it appealed to
[1:20:38] her sight
[1:20:39] it appealed to her taste it appealed to
[1:20:41] her craving brother brandon said
[1:20:43] she wanted to know she was craving for
[1:20:45] knowledge she was lusting for knowledge
[1:20:47] she wanted to know
[1:20:51] and so it was the she was being seduced
[1:20:53] by the serpent
[1:20:54] amen to take the nature of the devil
[1:20:57] amen to have lust
[1:20:58] selfish desire over the word of god and
[1:21:01] that is the very thing that brought
[1:21:03] corruption
[1:21:04] and it is still the thing that brings
[1:21:05] corruption friends it's the thing that
[1:21:07] brings corruption to churches it's a
[1:21:08] thing that brings corruption to
[1:21:10] individuals to households to families to
[1:21:12] marriages
[1:21:12] to places of business this is still the
[1:21:15] very thing that brings corruption
[1:21:17] is a selfish desire to have what you
[1:21:19] want to have
[1:21:21] to do things the way you want to do it
[1:21:22] to exalt yourself over the word of god
[1:21:25] is the very thing that causes corruption
[1:21:30] and first john i want to go through just
[1:21:32] a series of scriptures real quick
[1:21:35] and then one we want to read together
[1:21:37] love not the world neither the things
[1:21:39] that are in the world
[1:21:40] if any man love the world the love of
[1:21:42] the father is not in him for all that is
[1:21:44] in the world
[1:21:45] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[1:21:47] eyes the pride of life
[1:21:50] same thing that eve was tried by and
[1:21:53] fell by for her own selfish lusts
[1:21:56] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[1:21:58] life is not of the father
[1:22:00] but is of the world and the world passes
[1:22:04] away
[1:22:05] and the lust thereof but he that doeth
[1:22:08] the will of god
[1:22:09] abideth forever
[1:22:12] james 1 13 let no man say when he is
[1:22:14] tempted i am tempted of god for god
[1:22:16] cannot be tempted with evil
[1:22:17] neither tempteth he any man but every
[1:22:19] man is tempted when he is drawn away of
[1:22:22] his
[1:22:22] own desire
[1:22:26] lust i mean when we use this word lust
[1:22:27] so many times you may go to like a
[1:22:29] sexual lust this is not just a sexual
[1:22:32] lust
[1:22:32] it's any desire that's your own desire
[1:22:35] not god's desire
[1:22:39] amen he's drawn away of his own
[1:22:43] lust and enticed
[1:22:46] amen see what what satan had to do when
[1:22:49] he began to eat he had to tap into her
[1:22:52] own lusts he tapped into her
[1:22:55] own lust and when he tapped into her own
[1:22:57] lust amen she was corrupted by her
[1:23:00] own lusts and whenever we are corrupted
[1:23:03] amen for failing on the word of god it's
[1:23:05] by
[1:23:06] our own lusts
[1:23:09] when he is drawn away of his own lust
[1:23:11] and entities then when lust hath
[1:23:13] conceived it bringeth forth sin
[1:23:15] and sin when it is finished bringeth
[1:23:17] forth death
[1:23:18] that's exactly what happened in the
[1:23:20] beginning in genesis this
[1:23:22] this what we're reading in the new
[1:23:23] testament started in genesis
[1:23:26] romans 13 14 but put you on the lord
[1:23:29] jesus christ and make not provision for
[1:23:31] the flesh
[1:23:32] to fulfill the lust thereof
[1:23:35] let's read this one together galatians
[1:23:37] 5.
[1:23:40] and then we just got a couple more and
[1:23:41] we'll wrap it up for tonight
[1:23:43] galatians chapter 5.
[1:23:49] verse 16
[1:23:57] galatians 5 and 16 this i say then walk
[1:24:00] in the spirit you shall not fulfill the
[1:24:02] lust of the flesh
[1:24:05] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[1:24:08] and the spirit against the flesh these
[1:24:10] are contrary to one to the other so that
[1:24:12] you cannot do the things that you would
[1:24:14] but if you be led of the spirit you are
[1:24:16] not under the law now the works of the
[1:24:18] flesh
[1:24:18] are manifest which are these adultery
[1:24:20] fornication uncleanness
[1:24:22] lasciviousness adultery witchcraft
[1:24:24] hatred variants emulations wrath
[1:24:27] strife seditions heresies envyings
[1:24:29] murders
[1:24:30] drunkenness revelings and such like of
[1:24:33] the which i tell you before as i have
[1:24:34] also told you in the time past
[1:24:36] that they which do these things shall
[1:24:38] not inherit the kingdom of god
[1:24:40] but the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[1:24:42] peace long-suffering gentleness goodness
[1:24:44] faith meekness temperance against such
[1:24:47] there is no law
[1:24:49] and they that are christ have crucified
[1:24:51] the flesh with the affections
[1:24:52] and lusts and if we live in the spirit
[1:24:56] let us also walk in the spirit
[1:25:00] we are told to crucify our own
[1:25:03] desire amen crucify our own desire for
[1:25:08] anything that's not the word of god for
[1:25:11] anything that's contrary to word of god
[1:25:13] is there anything that's contrary to the
[1:25:14] divine nature we are to crucify the
[1:25:17] flesh with the affections and lust
[1:25:18] thereof
[1:25:20] and take the word
[1:25:23] ephesians 2 15.
[1:25:27] i'm going to finish with this musicians
[1:25:28] if you'd like to come
[1:25:31] blake if you'd like to come ephesians 2
[1:25:35] 1. and you hath the quickened who were
[1:25:38] dead in trespasses and sins
[1:25:40] where in time past you walked according
[1:25:42] to the course of this world according to
[1:25:44] the prince
[1:25:44] of power of the air the spirit that now
[1:25:47] worketh in the children of disobedience
[1:25:49] among whom also we all had our
[1:25:51] conversation in times past
[1:25:53] in the lust of our flesh this is the way
[1:25:56] we all walked
[1:25:58] you know you never have to teach a baby
[1:26:01] to steal
[1:26:02] to take what's not his every baby i've
[1:26:05] ever seen will take what's not theirs
[1:26:07] and then they will slap punch bite pull
[1:26:10] hair
[1:26:11] kick to keep it
[1:26:14] that's their own lusts we were all
[1:26:18] born that way we were all born in that
[1:26:20] amen but we've crucified
[1:26:22] the flesh we've been born again by the
[1:26:23] spirit and now we let the spirit work
[1:26:25] through us which brings the divine
[1:26:26] nature
[1:26:27] amen which will which will suck we will
[1:26:29] sacrifice ourselves for the word of god
[1:26:34] we all had our conversation in times
[1:26:36] past in the lust of our flesh
[1:26:37] fulfilling the desire of the flesh and
[1:26:39] of the mind and we're by nature the
[1:26:41] children of the wrath
[1:26:42] even as others but god who is rich in
[1:26:45] mercy for his great love wherewith he
[1:26:46] loved us that's grace friends
[1:26:49] even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:26:51] quickened us together with christ
[1:26:52] by grace are you saved
[1:26:56] let's all stand
[1:27:02] the nature of cain
[1:27:05] was a manipulator a digger around
[1:27:10] in the word to manipulate it for his own
[1:27:12] purpose to build
[1:27:14] to fabricate the war have war to have
[1:27:16] science to have his own achievements
[1:27:19] but little label was just the keeper of
[1:27:22] the sheep
[1:27:23] two occupations two natures two vines
[1:27:28] what nature do you want tonight do you
[1:27:32] want the nature of the simple shepherd
[1:27:34] the humble farmer says lord all i want
[1:27:37] to do is take care of the very thing
[1:27:38] that's covering me
[1:27:40] the thing that my substitute that's
[1:27:42] pardoning me that's covering my
[1:27:44] nakedness
[1:27:45] that's clothing me in righteousness
[1:27:47] that's the thing that i just want to
[1:27:48] take care of i don't want personal gain
[1:27:50] amen i don't want accomplishment amen i
[1:27:52] don't want any of that
[1:27:53] i just want if you'll just allow me to
[1:27:56] take care of the sheep
[1:27:58] allow me to care for the lamb amen allow
[1:28:01] me
[1:28:01] amen allow me to give my life amen
[1:28:04] not to manipulate it not to twist it not
[1:28:07] to serve my own purposes with it but
[1:28:08] just to care for the lamb
[1:28:11] amen abel went down
[1:28:16] slain who will declare his generation
[1:28:19] there's a resurrection and saith
[1:28:21] and when seth comes up he's got the same
[1:28:23] nature abel had
[1:28:25] and there's got to be somebody on the
[1:28:27] earth that'll take the same nature
[1:28:30] in the resurrection that he had
[1:28:35] everything starts in genesis
[1:28:39] i hope you're seeing like i am
[1:28:43] that's christ every line
[1:28:46] every story we take a few sentences
[1:28:50] about cain and abel and all of a sudden
[1:28:51] it blows open the whole bible and
[1:28:53] everything we're experiencing now
[1:28:55] why because the big picture is the
[1:28:58] shining light that illuminates
[1:29:00] every other picture in the bible the
[1:29:03] revelation has been given through a
[1:29:05] prophet in this day
[1:29:06] and that revelation is the bright
[1:29:08] shining light that illuminates every
[1:29:09] corner of the bible every story every
[1:29:11] time
[1:29:11] every shadow amen every happening amen
[1:29:14] is illuminated by this one
[1:29:16] great revelation the mystery of god
[1:29:18] that's been revealed in our day
[1:29:20] and that mystery of god is christ and if
[1:29:22] you can't find him in
[1:29:23] every line and every and every jot and
[1:29:26] every tittle of the bible go back and
[1:29:27] read it again you've missed something
[1:29:30] and i'll say we've been missing
[1:29:31] something all along but by his grace
[1:29:33] he's continuing to brighten the light
[1:29:35] and brighten the light go back and read
[1:29:37] it again brother ben said didn't give up
[1:29:39] on being a christian or consider
[1:29:40] yourself not a seed of god
[1:29:41] he said go back and read it again you've
[1:29:43] missed something
[1:29:45] and i think we can all say we've been
[1:29:46] missing something for years we've been
[1:29:48] missing something but by god's grace he
[1:29:50] doesn't want us to miss it anymore and
[1:29:52] he's saying
[1:29:53] read it again read it again read it
[1:29:56] again
[1:29:57] read it again amen it's getting brighter
[1:30:00] and brighter
[1:30:01] and brighter oh what a glorious
[1:30:05] love affair he has with us what a
[1:30:08] wonderful thing to hold that secret
[1:30:11] sealed in god he's been letting it out
[1:30:15] little by little but never fully
[1:30:17] disclosing it
[1:30:18] till the end time and then you disclose
[1:30:22] it he declares it through a prophet
[1:30:24] and leaves it sealed to the wicked
[1:30:28] but the wise will understand
[1:30:32] let's bow our heads and pray dear
[1:30:35] heavenly father we love you lord
[1:30:38] we love you because you gave us your
[1:30:39] word lord
[1:30:41] you gave it to us lord and it's been
[1:30:43] laying there for thousands of years lord

[1:31:00] you scribed it you penned it you told it
[1:31:03] lord and preserved it lord
[1:31:05] so that we would have your word today so
[1:31:07] that under a messenger a prophet in our
[1:31:10] day you can bring a revelation yourself
[1:31:13] to us of what this whole bible is all
[1:31:15] about
[1:31:17] and by that revelation we can go back
[1:31:19] and read it again
[1:31:21] read what our forefathers have read read
[1:31:23] what the patriarchs
[1:31:25] of the new testament have read the
[1:31:26] apostles and prophets
[1:31:28] we can go back and read what they wrote
[1:31:30] we could go back and read what
[1:31:31] through the church ages the ministers
[1:31:34] and
[1:31:35] and the messengers have been reading
[1:31:36] lord
[1:31:38] but god in this day you've illuminated

[1:31:58] mystery lord
[1:32:00] god i pray that you'd help us to be

[1:32:53] will begin to strike deeper and deeper
[1:32:54] and deeper
[1:32:55] and let it unlock the faith that is
[1:32:57] laying in our souls lord
