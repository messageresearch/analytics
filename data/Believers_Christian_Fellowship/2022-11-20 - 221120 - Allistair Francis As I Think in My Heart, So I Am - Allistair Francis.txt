with us now we depend upon you in all things in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen let's turn in our Bibles I'm going to go to Genesis 25 22-34 . Genesis 25 22-34 we'll just take our scripture reading then you can take your seats if you're there the word of God reads like this and the children struggle together within her and she said if it be so why am I thus and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the Elder Shall Serve the younger and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold they were twins in her womb and the first came out red all over like in Harry garment and they called his name Esau and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on Esau's heel and his name was called Jacob and Esau was and Isaac was three score years old when she beared them and the boys grew and ESO was a cunning Hunter a man in the field and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents and Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison but Rebecca loved Jacob and Jacob sawed pottage and Esau came from the field and he was faint and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee with that same red pottage for I am faint therefore was his name called Edom and Jacob said sell me this uh this day thy Birthright and Esau said behold I am at the point to die and what prophet shall this Birthright do to me and Jacob said swear to me this day and he swear unto him and he sold his Birthright unto Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink and Rose up and went his way thus Esau despised his Birthright the Lord had a blessing to his word you may be seated glory to God greet you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the highest greeting of all amen the Lord bless you this morning it's been a privilege to be here it's been a privilege uh to share the pulpit with my brother brother Daniel you appreciate again brother Chad for allowing us this opportunity to share what God has laid on our hearts and I must say this uh I've never been a fanatical person or person who just looks on signs and things like this you know it's just I've tried to stay just stay with the word as much as I can and as simple as possible but these meetings have been uh unusually like brother Chad said lead just things and and I I I've never met brother Daniel I've never heard him preach I don't get on the internet much and I I don't know anything and here we are we come to this place we're speaking and he starts on things and I don't know what he's going to preach I don't know what the theme of this weekend is going to be when I prepare to go out I got like 11 to 20 sermons that God has on my heart and I've got this whole selection in I feel like I want to get into something and and I had all these things and then but the ones that started standing out as we came closer to these meetings just started impressing in my heart and then he starts with this here I am and this particular one this morning I want to title it as I think in my heart so I am and you know from the scripture as I um and that's from the scripture so as I think in my heart so I am so I also want to thank brother Franco he's been wonderful such a fine spirit I think I've given him a lot of trouble because I didn't come here with a PowerPoint but he's done uh it for me I hope I remember to keep switching this but uh wonderful saints of God we just appreciate you the hospitality the fellowship has just been Rich so we trust that the Lord will bless you so uh this morning I was I was highly strong listening to brother Chad saying I must relax and shoulders were bunched because I was really toiling on whether to speak this message because you know it's so easy to speak a message and preachers like that we like to preach things that make the people happy but we get the most amens it's easy to do that there's so much to preach but this message is um I and and I felt led because it's I mean it's a closing day of special meetings you know I should leave here with something so inspirational you all feel so great we walk out there and hopefully you know go home on lunches and smiles on our faces but this is going to make us uh convicted and do a little introspection not just about ourselves but everything that's happening in the message and once again it's the types and I don't know how it just blended into who I am here I am amen so let's get into this message and uh maybe once I get in I'll get rid of all this tightness and you can keep praying for me amen so God bless you so you all know the story of um Jacob and Esau and as we've read in the scripture it's clear that ESO being the firstborn and I think we spoke in this on on Thursday night being the firstborn he had the right to the birthright which means he had the right to all his father's inheritance and Jacob would have not received anything uh because uh he may have been given something by his brother but his duty would have been to help his brother in his father's business that's how it would have went but ESO he kind of was so confident in himself he took it for granted and then when the time came it showed that and the Bible is saying he despised his Birthright and I'm sure he didn't actively despise it standing there thinking you know I hate this Birthright that's not what it means it means he didn't consider it the highest thing as Jacob did and Jacob was the one who was clearly born second and wasn't even supposed to get it but he he saw it as the greatest thing ever greater than himself amen so and I'll you know the scripture speaks of things like it says you know Jacob was a plain man those are those are mild words and because it doesn't really explain how plain he actually was and and Esau is this very religious man now remember we we typing so we got to put this into our lives into the Realms of the message into the church in every realm like our brother was speaking you've got to put it in so so ESO was a a religious man his father who is the type of the ministry respected him and loved him more than Jacob what does that tell you right he was handsome he was tall he was a brilliant Hunter which means he had gifts right uh and and Isaac loved him and he was a man of good stature he was a muscular broad-shouldered and very hairy he looked like the perfect son the perfect message believer right and he took care of his father his father loved venison I love venison um we get lots of good venison in South Africa uh but his father loved to eat that and yet Joseph was the uh Jacob was the one who stayed home and he was Mommy's boy right so Isaac the ministry of that day was being taken care of by Esau yet he despised the birthright Romans 9 10. see if I remember to go there Romans 9 verse 10 to 14. not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid right so bear all these things in mind so you don't have you're not forced to follow in in the Bible you can just follow on the screen unless you can't read that but so because we're going to get through a lot and some quotes right so Jacob on the other hand was this plain man I tell you if the Bible's language says he was plain I mean he was dead boring right that's what it's saying there was nothing to him there was nothing to enjoy about him he had no gifts he was at home cooking he sought pottage while his brother had gifts he was attractive he was taking care of the ministry he was involved in the father's business this man was Jacob was around his mother right and his mother loved him but his mother knew something amen so he was loved by Rebecca and yet being a person with no outstanding gifts no outstanding abilities he loved the birthright more than anything it must have been every day thinking about it wheeling and dealing how do I get it what do we do waiting for the moment right and but clearly there was something in him longing before he was even conscious of the birthright because the Bible said he struggled in the womb and grabbed on his brother's heel and and the the what do they call him um the ones who would help bring forth the babies it's just the midwives The Midwives so when when the babies were born The Midwives saw the character and watched and they would tell the mothers this is what's happened and then they would give them a name like that that's why they chose Esau because it means red and then Jacob means supplanted because he grabbed his brother's heel he's trying to steal his position so that's how they named them it's a planter deceiver right and this showed there was more to him even before he knew what the birthright was he was they were struggling in the womb and and Rebecca's testimony was how can this be I was Barren I was waiting so long for a baby and here now I get these two and they're just fighting each other in the womb and she's struggling right Jacob loved both his father and mother the ministry of that day Esau wasn't too concerned with his mother but he wanted more Jacob wanted more than what was allotted to him right so I want to get through the story as quick as we can and then we'll get to the typing let's go to um Genesis 27 skipping forward to verse 18 to 29. now this is where it gets interesting because and ties in with what our brother Daniel was preaching Genesis 27 verse 18. now he's he's already bought the birthright from Esau now he feels he has to convince his father so he can get the blessing officially so he has to go to the ministry and get the approval and he came unto his father and said my father and watch Isaac and he said here am I who are thou my son the ministry is identified here am I now you identify yourself now watch this one with the birthright Jacob said unto his father I am Esau thy firstborn this man knows who he is but he's pretending to be somebody else in the message he's pretending to be the firstborn he's unconscious of God's prophecy that the birthright is actually his because God when he spoke to Rebecca he said the Elder Shall Serve the younger one people will be a stronger right so here he is in the message he's trying to be the older brother I am Esau thy firstborn he is deceiving the ministry I have done according to uh according arise I pray thee certain eat of my venison that thy soul may bless me he's even brought meat that is goat meat and lying that it's venison but his mother is so good at preparing the goat to taste like the venison and there even use the hair of the goat to disguise himself right and Isaac said unto his son how is it that thou has found it so quickly my son it's amazing you get this Revelation so fast I pray thee sit and eat of my venison my that thy soul may be blessed how is it that that was founded so quickly my son and he said because the Lord thy God brought it to me I mean how many lies can you tell in one time right and Isaac said unto Jacob come near I pray so Isaac smells a rat right come near I pray thee that I may feel thee my son whether thou be my very son ESO or not so again in the type we're seeing that the ministry actually prefers Esau and not Jacob the ministry in the message at the end time actually prefers the oldest son we've got to identify what that character is and that's amazing this is why they'll be so few in the end times staying true to the word because the ministry which is waxing old and getting blind is preferring the one that supports them according to what they need verse 22 and Jacob went near unto Isaac his father and he felt him and said the voices Jacob but the hands of the hands of Esau because he's feeling that you know when I look at this something but he's blind but how could he not feel this stuff strapped to him it should have known right but clearly the ministry was was getting so old the senses the the ability to discern was disappearing verse 23 and he discerned him see I didn't I didn't make that up he discerned him not because his hands were hairy so hands represent the things that you do the works The Works look like the firstborn so he discerned him not and he said art thou my very son Esau and so you can see the Ministries there's something off they just can't tell what it is right he said bring it near uh utter my very son ESO and look I am this I am is a wrong identification he's using the right words but he's he's getting the wrong identification The Chosen vessel the chosen one is identifying himself wrongly that's why I said it introspection and he said verse 25 bring it near to me and he said and I will eat of my son's venison that my soul may bless thee and he brought it near to him and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank and his father Isaac said unto him still not fully convinced come near Naomi my son and kiss me kiss means Embrace hug right and he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him so the smell even the anointing smell is anointing right remember the perfume of the Apothecary placed in the coals smell perfume it means anointing which means Jacob was even putting on an anointing and blessed him so he that anointing said all right this is him the smell is there see the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord had blessed therefore God give thee of the Dew of Heaven and the fatness of the earth and the plenty of corn and wine the blessing is is being given to Jacob though it's under false pretenses verse 29 let people serve thee and Nations bow down to thee be Lord over thy brethren and so the ministry the old and going blind is still preaching the blessing proclaiming the Liberty proclaiming The Blessing by prophecy according to what God Said to Rebecca Isaac is now echoing that right and left thy mother's sons bow down to thee curse should be everyone that cursed thee and blessed be he that blesseth thee which is why Esau eventually ends up cursed because Esau cursed him and vowed to kill him glory to God so here at first Jacob had to deny who he was to receive the blessing right this is this is the problem we've been hearing this weekend here am I the right place the positioning identify our brother said God is Desiring that you have a revelation of yourself now he has a revelation of himself but he's pretending to be somebody else right and he he had to First Act Like someone else to get the birthright oh that's what he thought he had to do if you have to think of it why couldn't he come in and say my father it is me Jacob this is what has happened between my brother and I he doesn't want the birthright he's legally sold it to me now I'm asking you to bless me and give it to me because I have rightfully inherited it from him and he has relinquished it that would have been honest right he if you think today but clearly at that time he thought it wouldn't work he thought the ministry is definitely not going to respect me it's not going to recognize me uh and I and they're going to ostracize me they're going to put me out and that's exactly how you and I think you'd rather go with the crowd and he thought if he did not it would look like he would not be recognized so he had to behave like somebody else whom he judged and everyone else did was better than him by all standards everybody felt including Jacob that his brother's mannerisms his brother's gift his brother's smell was better than his and more favorable verse 23 Isaac did not discern so we know even the ministry likes everything about Esau more than Jacob right so it looks like he is the you know um on the one hand looks so admirable of Jacob to want the birthright we've heard that being preached he loved it so much and and to us now it looks like he is the real message believer because he loved the birthright more than anything else and this is true he is the real message believer but this is only the beginning of his story and the beginning of his problems he used his Fallen nature Jacob to start with his name was wrong and I think when I think about it that's the problem when I come into the message I'm still holding the wrong name which they named me at my my conception my birth and that's the reason why I'm not identifying myself properly at first because I need to meet the angel and get the name changed and then I'm going to identify myself properly so I'm not really comfortable with my initial identity I come into the message with somehow or not I'm so uneasy I'm I'm I'm feeling better being ESO he could not see that God was willing to look Beyond his own natural laws God was willing to look Beyond his laws on the birthright and the firstborn which God was so strict on but it was God was willing and and Jacob couldn't see that because of everything presented to him in the natural amen God was willing to look Beyond his laws to give Jacob the birthright and The Inheritance because Jacob loved the birthright with all his heart and with all his soul Jacob also didn't know that he was the predestinated one to the birthright right that's why he was behaving like this being trapped Naturally by being born second I mean from the very beginning being born second you're already past passed up right he lived his life not knowing that he was the true heir of all things after his deception of his father and Esau he still doesn't see his worth he he flees I mean he's got the blessing he's he's got the birthright and the blessing he can actually take his place and and even though his father found out eventually he could stay and say listen it's done it's too late I can take my place now there's nothing you or anyone can do about it instead you still can't deal with it he flees from his family and his mother actually helps him he lived his life on the Run constantly trying to be somebody else but deep inside him there was a desire to put his Birthright to use also deep inside that Fallen nature was leading him into situations that would give him more of a bad time right like cheating his father-in-law of the cattle in the livestock right but what he didn't know uh that because of the predestinated seed in his heart his Fallen nature was only playing a part to drive him back to his inheritance and to take what was rightfully his but he needed to change his thinking in his heart because as you think in your heart so you are and so I preached this under a series called getting a higher level of thinking which is what we need to do in this time the the revelation of the word must not just come into our soul it must filter out into our spirit into our mind and literally change our thinking it must transform our reasoning we can't be cowards anymore amen we've got to realize I'm the chosen one I've got the message I don't have to cower from others who are putting me down let's go to Genesis 28 12-16 right this is the beginning the coming of the Lord to Jacob as we spoke yesterday and he dreamed and beholden let us set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending please don't mind if I read quickly I know my my mother's not going to enjoy that she always tells me you read too fast and she's listening somewhere behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land we are on thou lies to thee will I give it thee and to thy seed so look in this first coming of the Lord to him God himself is revealing to Jacob now I'm giving it to you I am for you you know you're sitting in charge you're getting that Revelation and you you're feeling that Vindication inside you are the chosen one you're receiving the Revelation you may not be like Esau you may not have that anointing you may not have all the abilities but you are the chosen one and God is confirming it inside verse 14 and I see it shall be as the dust of the earth look at the blessings and to the um to the west of the East and to the north and to the South Indian inaisy shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places with our goals and will bring thee again into this land the promise the prophecy that you will come back to this land you will be here even after that why not turn around and say okay let's go back now God has confirmed it nope still running for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of if God speaks that way it's going to be done verse 16 and Jacob awaked out of his sleep and said surely the Lord in this place is in this place and I knew it not right amen so God confirms his Covenant with Jacob shows him that all that he did in his life was because the predestinated seed was driving him to do it and to do it to bring him to his purpose to he's full he's calling right let's go to chapter 32 verse 24 to 31 and this is that second coming you spoke of yesterday Jacob was left alone there Wrestled a man with him until the break of day when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the angel saw that the angel was not prevailing against Jacob right clearly he had some Talent some ability to Prevail against the angel that the angel had to cheat crippling I mean that's cheating in wrestling for making him lame right and the hollow of Jacob's style was out of joint that's not fair right and he wrestled with him and said let me go still with with this crippling he still doesn't want to let him go he'd show the character in him no matter what trial there is no matter how you've broken down that predestinated seat is not going to let go of that Birthright glory to God he said let me go come on it was the whole night surely you should be tired it's the breaking of the day let me go said I will not let thee go until you bless me verse 27. said unto him what is Thy Name there it is brother this is the first time he said Jacob every time else he was pretending to be Esau it's like the break of day Lord I'm Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel it's at this point he goes back home as a as a prince thou has power with God and with men and has prevailed amen and Jacob called the name of the place oh and Jacob said unto him tell me I pray thee thy name so there's another thing he's not interested in just his name he's interested in divine nature okay I'm okay with my new heart of Flesh thank you for that but I want some divine nature what is your name and he says um wherefore is it that thou Dost ask after my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of the place pineal for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved and he passed over penual the son Rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh so from there on even his character change he even had less ability now he's crippled now he's got a limp this man does not look like an heir he does can you imagine now limping going toward Esau and say well I'm the one with the bus right now you have to relinquish everything you've been living here in my land for so long now here I am I'm I'm come to reclaim it he went fine he went away fine he comes back with the limp given to him by God who promised him everything when the seventh seal opened from his life when it broke away he recognized the coming of the Lord for the first time he can be honest who are you what is your name what is your character he lied to the ministry he lied he cheated he did everything he possibly could he lied he he created ability put on Harry he he he brought in gold for venison he was doing what the church said we must do then he even put on a false anointing to smell like Esau the firstborn and it's still he wasn't comfortable with it but he had to do it he failed to get the bus right and this is the first time I am Jacob he answers strong and honestly openly admitting his Fallen nature the acts of his past there's no reason to be deceitful in the presence of the Lord then the word gives him a new name a new fleshly nature this is the turning point in the life of a Believer this is when the word starts opening up to you and you realize I don't need to pretend anymore amen but he is not just after a new fleshly nature he is interested in the hidden word what is thy name glory to God he's after that divine nature not just interested in inheritance of this Earth of Church of the message I mean I'm interested in Divine inheritance I'm interested in Eternal inheritance it's almost like the birthright on Earth is not enough for him that's his main character and his only positive thing about him he is so interested in the inheritance of God he wants to inherit all things that's a real Heir he wants it all amen Heaven and Earth for this he was blessed abundantly given strength to go on overcome the Esau of his day he would he could go back to his inheritance put everything under his objection and that nature that he once pretended to be he now has a new nature a prince with God he knows to start living up to that can you imagine going back to Esurance and and ESO comes to him and says Jacob I'm so happy to see you hold on it's Israel amen as a man thinketh in his heart so is he Proverbs 23 7. exactly who you think you are is exactly who you will be God needs to change our thinking the word that you receive needs to change your thinking we cannot be imitating the Esau's neither can we be remaining Jacobs we need to become Israel glory to God Matthew 15 7-9 you Hypocrites welded Isaiah the prophet prophesy of you saying uh verse 8 this people draw an eye onto me with their mouths and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men that is Esau Behavior and that is Jacob imitating Esau Behavior right that's now we've got to be honest with ourselves right okay this was one of the themes of the Lord's message do you know in the first coming Christ's message was all about what's in your heart right in Matthew Chapter 5 when he when he was preaching The Sermon on the Mount and he started saying thou Moses said thou shall not kill but I say unto you if you're angry with your brother without a cause he was going straight to what's in the heart says Moses said You shall you can marry again for this and that and he said but I say unto you if you look upon a woman to lust after you've committed adultery and and so on he Christ was going to the heart right that was his ministry let's look at it Matthew 5 28 but I say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart Mark 11 23 for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he shall we say it shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith in his heart he's not interested in the Esau Behavior that what's in your heart needs to be seen Matthew 13 19 when anyone Hearth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one capture the way that which was sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the wayside Christ's Ministry was directed at in the heart as you think in your heart so are you Matthew 24 48 but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my Lord delaying his coming see why because God knows Christ knows people on the outside are going to say oh yeah you know I believe he's here but inside that's who you really are if that's your thinking on the inside you're not living true to yourself you're being an Esau amen that's the problem here that's why I say this is introspection so the prophet brings this concept in from a cigarette box a thinking man's filter right let's look at it I want to get through it quickly too uh let's go to the last paragraph there of paragraph 38 right at the last three lines I looked at that thing I I'm just flying because I know you know the story right I look at that thing and I thought a thinking man's filter I thought if the man could think at all he wouldn't smoke at all how could it be a thinking man's filter a thinking man wouldn't smoke at all right so what he's showing is that this advertisement is a deception right he uncovers this deception that the enemy puts before a man he says that a real thinking man would not smoke in the first place right the advertisement was propagating a healthier cigarette healthier cigarette I was trying to say that it was a better filter for a thinking man than other cigarettes than an intelligent man would choose this cigarette because it's a better filter and still gives the desired taste brother Ram said it's lies because the filter actually removed the deadly stuff you couldn't even get the smoke if he said if the filter removed all the deadly stuff you wouldn't get the smoke so the filter is just a bluff amen and that's the problem with the church he said the same deceit is in the church let's read and I stood there looking at it and I think of how deceitful it was the question came to me and I stoop back look at the back again as it just seemed like some something said to me but the slogan is all right a thinking man's filter a smoking man's taste it came to me that that deceitfulness also in the realm day in tobacco is something on order of the churches of today see a deceitfulness paragraph 58 and 59 uh like the tobacco companies I want to get to the yes the underlying portion each denomination has their own filter and they filter out all the true Christians that would say Amen when he was preaching and bring in all the bobbed hair and painted Jezebels and so on particle 59 the people they know what they want so if they have to get what they want they'll have a certain kind of a filter and enough of the world speak through to satisfy their worldly taste now he's talking about denomination we feel comfortable hey we dressed right we behave right we've got the standards right we're doing everything right let me tell you something in the message there are message filters he's speaking here to the laodicean church he says they want to be religious because they have a soul but they still want to have their Taste Of Life what is it that the message people want what is it that the message ministers want eventually because we know there are twins and every Revival produces twins the first brother is always going to be the favored one but he's not the one who's going to receive the open book in the end each denomination claims to have the best filter but the stuff that brings out spiritual cancer it's a lie because you can see where it heads up they just go into immorality Hollywood is now on the Pentecostal churches the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a mockery it's cancer and you can see how fast it is today especially with the internet which metastasizes the cancer right it starts there before you know it if you start here in America it's in Africa in five minutes right and even Australia that is further it's still in the same time that's how fast it metastasizes anything that happens in your chart if it's if it happens in TD Jake's church it's happening in South Africa in five minutes they're like they're like tapped in that's how fast it is and that's happening now in the message because you can you can see people Gathering who which ministers associate together which where we're more comfortable that's showing a filter if the people didn't get what they want they want out of their religion then they just take a different one but how this has changed in the message is what we need to see today we have perfected our Esau our upward attractive message Natures we have driven out all the tastes of the world The Taste for the world and we look like we are perfect and better than denominations but each message church has its own filter for the revelation of the word now look at our filters I'll just give you a few don't worry about the Deep things just get the ABCs right who told you that where did you get that from just because you're afraid to get into the word to put your foot in Jordan you think you're safe just keeping the ABCs let me tell you something that's a lie whoever thinks he can keep the ABCs and keep standards of the message you're lying to yourself because nobody can do it nobody can do it perfectly look at the filters as long as you live the life you have the evidence of the Resurrection another lie what is living the life according to the type Jacob was living life as long as you apply the token over your household you'll make it so what is applying the token they thought oh Lord Jesus I apply the token over my house Lord may they receive the Holy Ghost blessed be your name that's it my family's safe how about this filter as long as you have the emotions the Holy Ghost and the gifts in operation you have the right way because that must vindicate the word that's coming you must have all the prophecies I I heard one one Minister speaking there in Africa who said a pasta must have a supernatural Vindication with him the power of fire something he must have he must have prophecy or something where'd he get there from but it's a filter and because it works for them to get more Esau's they're going to keep at it because Esau is going to keep giving back venison and ability and taking care of the ministry while the ministry is losing discernment unable to see who is the one that God is predestinated to get the birthright the ministry is going blind the ministry can still smell can see the anointing can feel the works but losing the discernment to see who are the chosen ones you know the prophet said there's going to be a lot of people there that you didn't expect to be there you know that right so there's nothing wrong with applying the token I think a lot of people don't know what the token is if you know the life is in the blood and where is the blood of God the prophet said the blood of God went back to being the word so where's the token it's in the word because the blood of God is in the word applying the token is not a feeling it's not an emotion it's not a type of behavior it's not just speaking the words Holy Ghost Holy Ghost it's not signs and wonders it's not gifts of the Spirit we know those things were not even that which is perfect how can that be the token the token is the person of the Holy Ghost right you know how trained we are to be Esau's because as your child is growing you even think the solution to your child becoming the most spiritual thinking person is to get the Holy Ghost and the wrong impression of the Holy Ghost because because you're catering to what you see so you assume the Holy Ghost is them standing in front raising their hands singing louder uh behaving emotional crying with tears doing all now I'm not saying that's not good because any person who has the real word inside is going to have some kind of emotion but putting on a show behaving like an Esau when you know you are a Jacob that's a problem and you expecting your child to behave like an Esau when really his desires when that word gets hooked in him that's what it's going to take that's where his his Revival is going to be but you're forcing him to be an Esau more abilities more anointing we know where that is that's the firstborn right the one who is preferred even by Isaac so here's what's happening in these last days men have advertised the message life with filters upon the revealed word there's nothing wrong with the ABCs but are you just being a Jacob trapped as an Esau to conform to something when you know there is so much more to you and that you are trapped by your natural circumstances right so in these days living the life filters people feel like and this is what happens in the church people feel like they are getting what they want I'm happy with my church it's so comfortable secure lifestyle secure marriages wives and children are under control pastors will help you make all your decisions for you security of making it in the Rapture books and messages of the Prophet a wonderful church with people who love each other stand up for one another provide Marriage Partners for the other for our children to allow our lifestyles to continue and you start ending up with a whole bunch of actors what do we do as a church we assume as the church we must control the dressing we must control the behavior of our men and women thinking if you control the dressing and and the behavior of our men and women we Bluff ourselves it's a filter if we do that there won't be any lust come on go ask the Muslims you can be covered head to toe and filled with lust all right yeah and you make it about that that's not where it's going to go if your son does not have an experience with a revealed word in this day his heart is going to be overtaken by the Beast nature he it's natural to feel attraction to the opposite sex but you need the revelation of God to be able to control that right Faking It is not going to control it dressing different is not going to control it but Esau's are comfortable with that but if that was the correct thing then why then we wouldn't see such a breakdown of marriages all over the message children backsliding breakdown of Brotherhood in the church dictatorship of pastors and Ministry slowly we can see with the with the observant eye that we had a filter a cover for what was really inside of people even to the point of ministers fall into adultery immorality is rising in the church ministers fall into a filthy Luca love for money love for popularity what's happening we're realizing we're surrounded by more Esau's and it shocks us when we hear things we think how could it be really respected that man you're standing there you're thinking I really wanted to be like him it's the greatest deception among our people but whatever is in your heart in your soul is what will affect your body and show its true nature your soul is the nature of who you are it is the answer to the question who are you it is she but the soul draws its resources from the body and the spirit amen it draws its resource it can the Soul can only manifest its nature through the body and the spirit right because Adam became a living Soul when he received a body was he a dead soul in Genesis 1 26 27 . he had a soul there in theophany right all it means is that when the fleshly body was broadened he was now able to manifest the nature publicly that's how he became a living Soul right so no matter how you anoint the body in the spirit if your soul does not consist of the word you just have a religious filter with a worldly man's taste that's the hypocrisy of sin let's read I think your man's filter pack of 108 notice the word cannot deny itself then it is satisfied or is the desire it's a desire of what what made you desire it in the first place because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life always laying in there always washing them all that the father has given me will come to me there isn't any of them going to be lost a thinking man's taste when a thinking man hears the word of God my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow for down in there is life and life connects with life sin connects with sin and sin is so hypocritical until it thinks that it's saved when it isn't saved it's the very depths of hypocrisy so you see in the message we got so used to sin being like the denominations sin thinks it's saved this is amazing you see there's a problem with the man he wants to live in this world and still believe that he's safe with God right that's the problem we have today so he does what he wants to and uses religion as a filter they they say I can do what I want but as long as I be religious I can filter out sin but religion is created around worldliness so how can it be a true filter religion is the white horse rider it's it's the Imposter the first seal the first uh problem for the church was the white horse rider so here's what he means by sin connecting with sin if you really have the seed in you and you have the right filter you won't connect with the attributes of sin does this so in other words you don't need to act if you have the word the right seed inside you won't connect with sin and even if you fall you'll put yourself right you'll come back in because you get the right seed inside right so do we need a filter yes we do this the first two dimensions of us these these uh body and spirit is seriously messed up because we came through our parents Gene we do need a filter what is the filter the correct filter is the revealed word of the hour the open book before that Jacob was Jacob and Esau but when the coming of the Lord when the promise is open when he has a name change then he becomes Israel from there on he can take his position prior to that you're just active thinking man's filter again paragraph 95 oh yes the word of God is a thinking man's filter anyone knows that that's what your soul is filtered through the word of God it makes you no no no young people say oh there it goes again the word of God everything is the word the word the word that's the solution that's what we're going to do that's what we're going to read that's what we're going to be word word word word sorry to disappoint Noah's date would have been Ark Ark Ark Ark whether it was boring or not that's all you had when a thinking man comes to God's fault it gives him a holy man's taste that's right when you come through God's filter then your taste is a holy man's taste it makes a righteous man taste the slogan certainly is okay brother agreed with the slogan on a cigarette box but made better I want to draw on that point you cannot do this by your work Saints God has to First change your thinking you have to come to that point where you admit Lord I'm just a Jacob and wrestle it out sweat it out amen praise be to God he has to change your thinking if you think you are supposed to be an Esau you will constantly be drawing on a weak filter it's not going to bring you to your position in Christ you'll be running away all your life young man when you get this revelation of the message you'll you'll become a preacher you'll become a real Witness you know we go to to youth camps and we ask young people you know what do you want to be how many of you want to be accountants oh hands go up how many of you want to study this let's go up how many of you want to be a doctor hands go up how many of you want to be a pastor that's what happens everyone starts laughing at them with one one boy's hand goes up and everyone everyone looks at him ah hey not you and then how many of you want to be a Deacon's wife and and like eight girls you know and everyone looks them laughing at them because it's almost like you shouldn't desire that no one laughed when someone put up their hands to be a doctor an accountant lawyer or work or something and then you feel your children like uh and so like what brother Daniel was saying these are important things why shouldn't the children desire to be a pastor one day desire to be a Deacon's wife one day because it's in you to support the church to be a part of the purpose to perpetuate the message to look care to take care of the Next Generation why shouldn't you growing up think I need to keep myself keep my virginity because I'm going to be a pastor's wife one day I'm going to be a pastor one day I'm going to be a deacon one day I'm gonna be a song leader one day why can't I have that ambition there's no shaming that you get a hold of the word and you're going to feel God's purpose resting on you and you're going to know this is good as long as I live whoever I'm going to marry is going to be part of that Commission because I know I'm being I'm being prepared for something but if you don't have that you're just going with the flow being an Esau waiting for something to happen people ask you I lied or no listen I was a Jacob I know that I felt the call inside my heart and I denied it all the way up until God took the rug out from under me so at to the point where you just flop down I literally flopped down and had a brother brother Nelson guy pray over me and just that was it from then but prior to that I said no no no never going to happen career and everything I wanted trying to get away from it as far as possible uh brother Steve would ask me to preach I denied it right to the very end just wouldn't do it but yet inside I'm burning I'm seeing the revelation of the word I'm discussing the Ministries are coming ministering brothers are coming in I'm toe-to-toe with them on the word my brother Adam says this we're talking about this and these ministers looking at me and thinking do you preach in the church are you going to preach are you called eventually some of them got fed up with me and said you are called to preach and then I'd shrink away oh no you know and and change the subject I've been that and I know the pain that goes with it we have a personal chat I can tell you the pain that goes with from denying who you are oh yes I literally had my tendons taken out from me now that's that's the truth uh injured both tendons in both ankles because I felt I was going to have a life in sport someday there was my test if you consult if you constantly draw your life through the revealed word you will love the birthright like Jacob you'll wrestle with the coming of the Lord till your old nature is gone till there is nothing left in you but the Holy Ghost only the Holy Ghost can filter through the word all sin will be blocked out from entering your soul you won't compromise with unbelief it will show you naturally that you have a holy man's taste for life you need the quickening spirit to bring life to pass amen so that means you have to recognize the word for your day and that your and that your place is in the word amen it's your Birthright any inheritance that you long for thank you man's filter Park of 163 if you won't cope with the word of God and your soul don't do it then there's something wrong if it shows up you have taste the life the kind of life is in you if it's a holy discreet honorable it'll come out that way the last part shows you are a part of the word of that word that the word is in you drawing from that word amen Park of 164 what's it drawing it's drawing through the word there's the filter because you are a part of the body of Christ of this age and if that word is in you it can only draw through the word that spirit that quickens the word that's in you just the word alone won't live that's the reason all the father has given me will come to me if I be lifted up I'll draw a meant the Father the part of the body of Christ that's in the world predestinated put into your heart see how it works if you can't handle the revealed word you'll never be able to use the spoken word as a proper filter you always get it wrong you know what we're saying Saints I don't want you to be confused if you don't get the open book you won't be able to properly use the written word for your life you'll always use it as an Esau you as a pretending issue you always you you know okay let's let's speak plainly the reason why you use standards and laws of the message because you're afraid that's that's the reason and when when you get to a church where it's so strict you it's because the pastor is afraid he doesn't want the stigma of what's going to happen if someone Falls the church is a sanctuary for wounded we're not meant to have upstanding members that don't fall that don't make mistakes how do they learn how will they grow you only you only excommunicate a person if they are unrepentant you know excommunication is an act of love it's not just correction because someone did something wrong you can't excommunicate someone who has confessed to their wrong if they're not confessing they're unrepentant it means they're against the word and that's what separates you is when you're against the word right so when you get to play and those of you sitting here who are thinking like Esau's when something goes wrong you form the pasta you see somebody is doing something wrong what are you doing about it what will you do about it I've I've been in the message since I'm four or five years old I've seen it all pastors will go correct correct correct everyone correct when it's their own children they say well you know what my child hasn't had the Holy Ghost yet I've literally heard that so we can kind of move around it you know we're just waiting for him to have the Holy Ghost what about the other person's children that you kicked out that you ostracized that you got rid of that you spoke about that the other cliques spoke about stop doing that you're teaching your children to be Esau's the more pressure you apply like that the more you want to make them fake it they want to fake it but inside their heart they just can't wait to get away from you that's what we've been doing I've heard things some pastors say I will pull you into heaven if I have to what is that where did you get that from see if you're going to make those standards those rules so high and and there it is in the Bible the prophet said uh Christ said to the Pharisees you place a burden on the people too hard for them to bear and you yourself won't move a finger to bear that burden so what are we saying must we just be a liberal Church no preach the word the word will change them the word will do it and the reason why they need rules in the church is because they're not preaching the word the word is supposed to be transforming amen we don't want to conform to the message wait we started off like that we had to and we came out of denominations and come into this oh wow these people all dressed different You Came From Another conservative denomination here all these people are clapping and you you can barely get your hands together but eventually you assimilate you get used to it you fall in line you first start off like a Jacob imitating an ESO you look around you see them you're quiet everyone's hands are raised one brother is worshiping glory to God praise the Lord you said this in page 28 of Christ the ministry of God revealed and you oh I need to read Christ the ministry of God reveal I want to do that too right that brother has a wrong idea of Prayer by the way God doesn't need you to quote message back to him in prayer if you're asked to pray for the need of the people come and pray for the need of the people Don't Preach a sermon you know right so there's no need to do that if you're starting to behave and create anointing listen you're trying to put on a goat smell you're trying to put on hair on your hands you're trying to show work speak from your heart be because who you are in your heart is who you are stop trying to be an Esau there's some brothers who are just anointed they just got this mellow voice they've got the Charisma it's who they are I'm not going to try to be that you ever seen someone with a bass voice trying to sing soprano that's kind of like what it is the revealed word will act as your filter you will receive the spoken word it'll be quickened to you by the quickening of the spirit of the coming of the Lord if you receive more quick and spoken word your filter of the revealed word becomes stronger and stronger it will block more you young man young woman you won't need anyone to watch you if your word the word is in you you'll protect yourself even in if you're engaged to someone you'll protect yourself if you're espoused to someone you'll protect yourself you don't need laws you don't need anyone to to to give you the laws you'll have it for yourself you'll have the strength to keep your character that's where we should be leading our people to thank you preach the word don't police the people policing the people comes with judgment because if you need police you need a Judicial System problem is the judicial system is always corrupt the prosecutors are very good and the judicial you know what judging is all about it's about this this is what people don't know about judging judging is deciding on how much Mercy to give because a prosecutor brings the accusation judging is about deciding how much Mercy to give when it is proven that he is guilty you know if you've ever been a part or seen a a Judicial statement being read they'll be like you've defied this this this this according to the law they'll give you all the laws you broke and because of this and what will he do they'll judge your age they'll judge your your situation where you come from uh maybe you have a health problem and they look at all these things and decide how bad and how much Mercy to give but it seems like in the message it's the highest penalty for everything no one thinks about how much Mercy to give to someone who's actually guilty until it's you sitting in the defendant's seat who am I then I am a real thinking man my thinking has been changed by the coming of the Lord since the opening of the seventh seal I no longer need to conform to an Esau religion I am up to my neck with it it's nauseating I cannot take it anymore cannot take fake worship fake prayer fake Behavior we're up to here with him we need to see people who want the word who love the word who love to desire to Fellowship I am no longer a Jacob who thinks he's less than the others I have no use for a religious message filters I've recognized it as hypocrisy I will say it openly the only photo that satisfies me is perfect perfectly is the revealed word of the hour I seek the spoken word that can be quickened by the same quickening spirit that revealed his coming I recognize that I'm called to be the person of Jesus Christ made flesh and no Esau religion can produce that that is my thinking if I draw my life through the word then I am the word because as I think in my heart so am I glory to God let's go to the next scripture Genesis 27 and this is the second part of this mystery do you love him Saints we still got time all right Genesis 27 30-41 I'm trying to see how many Jacobs there are and it came to pass as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob and Jacob was yet scarce going out of the presence of Isaac his father and Esau his brother came in with his hunting that's how it always is you just show yourself and the older brother is there to show you up right verse 31 and he also had made Savory meat so you can see his bringing worship right and brought it into his father and said unto his father let my father arise in eat of his sons Venison and thy soul may bless thee now you're actually seeing in type what happens when Esau recognizes the favor on Jacob that's what's happening right now when those who have esor Natures are seeing what is happening with those who are receiving the open book there's the attitude you're going to see it what's happening verse 32 and Isaac his father said unto him who art thou and he said I am thy son thy first born isil he answers correctly he knows who is right and Isaac trembled very exceedingly the ministry has a problem because the two are so close trembled exceeding very exceedingly and said who where is he that had taken the Venison and brought it to me I have eaten of all before thou came as and have blessed him and he shall be blessed when Esau heard the words of his father he cried with a great exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father bless me even me also my father amen and he said thy brother came with satility and have taken away thy blessing and he said is not he rightly named Jacob for he had supplanted me these two times so the older brother actually knows who the other one isn't even rightly named that amen God help us for it supplanted me these two times he took away my Birthright and behold now he taken away my blessing he said hast thou not resolved a blessing for me Isn't there something for me Lord look at where it's coming to the end they've got a desire to have something more powerful than the one who actually has the birthright and Isaac answered and said unto Esau behold I've made him thy Lord and all his Brethren have I given him for thou for uh for servants you're a servant you're going to serve him everything you're going to do from here on is going to bless him no matter how you try and he said um for servants and with corn and wine there it is the written word the Revelation is going to bless him I've sustained him and what shall I do now unto thee my son what can I do for you that he's basically saying I cannot do anything for you right and Esau said unto his father has thou but one blessing my father bless me even also my father it's almost pitiful and Esau lifted up his voice and wept I don't reveal in this I don't feel fantastic about it it's not it's not a good feeling to have we're not rejoicing over this that's why I said this is a this is a solemn thing right but it's a reality of what is happening in this day and you can't deny it even if you don't like it to happen the way it is it's happening there's going to be a great Falling Away and it's already begun all of these and I don't want to say this hurtfully but I don't know what else what other word the only one come to me right now is defective those who are leaving the message this happened because of Esau religion that's why it happened because the people were guilty of being ESO going after that being brenamide focusing on the first obsessing over things that were not the revealed word and now the truth is all those with on the internet whichever they are and they and now say to them respectfully I'm not a brand Amite I and now and the prophet would never want me to admit that to admit that I'm a brand Amite because if you read Blasphemous names and have a real revelation of that you'll be afraid to call yourself by any label would never I'm devoted to the prophet and his word 100 but I do not wake up every morning obsessing over him wondering about what testimony I must fill my head with next of what happened in his life I'm not going to go to to Eagle Rock and Sabino Canyon and rate the place of every stone that is there I don't have a hank ring to go sit in his den room and put his hat on and feel like I need anointing or hold a gun no it's the word it's always been that I don't have to that my Revival is not there but because people did that for 40 years is why you have this falling away and defecting from the message they're right they are right but they just didn't see us that's the problem and maybe we were behaving like the Esau's we didn't even see us and even when it happened we took it personally how could they do this to the cloud to the prophet it's hurtful but we just afraid to show ourselves right rather not say anything about it rather just stay away from the fights just stay calm just ignore it what's going to reach a place where you can't ignore it anymore I'm not saying you want to go out and do something now and fight back but it's going to hit you in the face and you're going to have to stand up and say I am Israel glory to God amen verse 41 and Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing where will these father bless him that's where it's going to come to and Esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father are at hand then will I slay my brother you'll never see us going on the internet cutting up our brothers mentioning names you'll never see Jacob doing that you'll never see Israel that nature being on is but you'll see it on the other side getting on the Internet knocking Brothers down speaking against one another tearing a Brother's testimony down you're going to see that because they have purposed it in their heart to slay us this is the second part of the mystery since we are talking about the life we want to see this type to see how it directly speaks to us on the conditions we live under in this generation amen we identified Esau the firstborn right as the first nature we were born with so now we're going to get closer and I'll bring it in to me I was born with an Esau and a Jacob every Revival produces twins I was catering to the other side all my life right I was a pretender I was living the message I was pretending I was doing what my parents were telling I was living without a revelation every time they asked me I behaved like I was that Esau comes in from the field he and Isaac realized that Jacob has deceived Isaac and supplanted Esau ESO pleads for a blessing for himself this is vital Isaac tells Esau I'm sorry the blessing belongs to Jacob then Isaac prophesied something strange he says that towards the end Esau would grow to be more in numbers and dominion and will break the Yoke of Jacob from off of himself they'll separate eventually Israel Edom separated from Israel he didn't want to so if this is how it works if the brother has the birthright and the blessing the other brother is supposed to help him help build him up help strengthen him help threaten the cause help with the ministry to because they have the same father they have the same uh calling this is our should but Edom separated from Israel and Eden became a curse to Israel as long as they lived right and Isaac prophesies he says Edom will grow in numbers and will break the Yoke of Jacob from off himself means towards the end Esau will eventually become independent that's what we're going to see it's not a comfortable thing to realize right if the prophet said when I preached this I'm going to lose a lot of friends I guarantee you we are losing friends it's starting to feel really lonely because even though we have the right Desire with preaching what God shows us we accept what they preach when when God reveals something to them even if there's things we don't exactly see the same we say thank you brother the message was wonderful we go on we don't cut them down we don't blacken their names but they don't hesitate to slay us it's heading there it's a disturbing thought we thought that we'll actually get complete control over the first nature now look at yourself you when you consider yourself you look in the mirror your Easter nature is going to slay you every time you do something wrong you come in here what happens how do you feel when you have to take communion you're the biggest judge of yourself you'll come in here Palm sweaty nervous you know and here's the thing I did it see if you come in here and you know you're not worthy you're gonna take the communion anyway because you're Jacob and you're acting like Esau you listen the communion is not even about uh what you did wrong or whether you because you failed so many times some of us as families uh you fail on the way to communion and and what is putting it right oh I'm sorry honey I'm sorry does sorry put it right you said sorry just because you want to take communion and you come in here Esau convince himself I did it here's my venison I Jacob's very happy behaving like an Esau communion is about the Brotherhood of the church that's what it's really about it's about sitting at the same table and dipping in the SOP it's about the unity of the Brotherhood it's more about what you've done wrong to each other than all your regular failings in life it's about unbelief it's about because it's about Discerning the Lord's body you need to think about that and don't let Esau slay you for that come before the Lord it's not just an apology it's not just Lord I'm sorry the real apology is inside and the prophet says God already knows you repented of and again people repentance is a change of mind not an apology right and here's the other thing we forget because we're so good at being esos if your brother comes to to say I'm sorry brother please forgive me we've gotten used to our Western culture where we say it's okay brother you know what forgiveness is forgiveness is actually helping your brother to restore himself it's not word that says it's okay what do I do to help him regain his confidence that's the way it's going to work so there's a lot of people do not understand what Discerning the Lord's body is offending one another in word and deed but that's a different subject what are the Lord's Parables of the seed supports this type in the end the weeds will have to be gathered and burned while the wheat is harvested in the bond the battle between these brothers extends beyond what we have first thought I want to show you this in case you thought I made all this up you always get accused for making things up let's go to uh having a hearing recognizing acting on the word this is shocking it it's because it's in the message right a paragraph nine now we're fully acquainted with people who search the scriptures day and night read our papers and hear the news commentators that this world is now standing in the group of two spiritual forces and they are both religious forces and I believe that these great forces are soon coming to a head and both of these great forces were represented in two sons of Isaac how did God did you think of that both of these forces are represented in the two sons how that God is infinite wisdom had foreshadowed all things to us that we might be these things no of a certainty what lays before us made it so praying that God in his word the nature and his universe is so perfectly arranged together The Sinner can see something fixing to take place God has arranged it no one is without excuse the prophet said there are two great forces in the world and they are symbolized by these two sons of Isaac so we're not wrong when we say those two Natures inside uh uh Jacob and Esau two in the church two in the world right he says they're coming to a head in these last times right to the the prophecy of the type is coming to fulfillment let's go to the next one paragraph 10. now we see in these two sons that one day before they were born they were at war with one another even though the virgin mother she was a virgin a beautiful Rebecca that married the righteous seed of God promised Isaac they were two consecrated so we're not just talking about the world now too consecrated the world is not consecrated right right but we can still apply it there but we're talking about the church too consecrated Spirit-filled Believers of God foreordained to the very marriage they unite together by God foreknew it how could such a thing come through that one mother by one father one a very evil person another very good person and here's what I want to bring to you how did the good person look to be evil and the evil look to be the good let that soak in the evil looked to be the good and the good look to be the evil and isn't that how I felt isn't that how you felt always lesser than someone else they've got more of the ability more of the gift I'm Just a Nobody I just can't get this right no matter how much I try I still get picked on no matter how much I try I'm still lesser as someone else always seems better always seems to have more Revelation than me their their churches are producing more they seem to have more blessings at the advertising prophecies and miracles and all of that and we're just so simple and barely anything happens and it looks like they always have ammunition to prove us wrong to say something against us and we just stand there with our mouth shut accepting whatever they say one looks good but is actually evil and the other looks evil but he's actually good this is fascinating because it shows that things were completely opposite to the thinking of man without the right thinking it speaks the thing we TR we struggle with and I always look at everything personally I look at Lord what am I projecting if I'm projecting something but in the meantime I've got a hidden agenda I'm projecting something good in the meantime my agenda is evil yeah and you know Paul Paul said when I want to do good evil is present who can save me from the body of this death I find in me two laws uh you know what laws are right you know the prophet said there is a law in a bird there's a law in a fish the bird's law is it doesn't have to have a quote to say I should fly it just acts it doesn't need a way a law a standard to say well let's let's run along the road and pick up speed 30 miles an hour that might be a bit too fast but in kilometers it sounds better and then pick up my wings and start it doesn't need to work up because the law exists the law means the nature there's a law and a fish you try it fish can just blow out the air from inside and sink to the bottom it cells are so perfect it will never explode it it has such a tiny brain anyway nothing's going to happen to it you and I try that just try sinking to the bottom of the ocean your wonderful skull will explode because the skin cells and bone cells are not pressurized for that that law does not exist in you see but so there are two laws in every human born in this earth and when he wants to do good evil is present and he finds in himself that when he goes to do the good he gets to do the evil instead always right two laws so a human is supposed to have a simple law just like a fish just like a bird the law of man and because the Beast nature was injected in that's how the two laws came in so everything we look at has a has is is contaminated with desire even when it's logical we'll still go with desire and so when we consider the word we see what the word says even when God has perfected it even in our reasoning we'll go with desire that's how it works we're constantly giving glory to Esau even in ourselves we feel I should be more like this I should be more like this and you find even when you are doing it be honest you're not feeling comfortable with it you're wishing you could just be yourself that's what I like about the open book it makes you really look at yourself in the mirror it makes you stop being a hypocrite paragraph 17 hearing recognizing acting in the word of God these two boys if you notice their nature thank you brother Frank keep forgetting one of them was a spiritual man that was Jacob and the carnal man was Esau but they were both religious and the same things took place all down through the age the carnal and the spiritual ESO represented the man of Earth natural religious incline so look at the man the natural the part of that was influenced by the Beast nature religious inclined but never able never able to do what get the promise it wasn't in him to do it he couldn't do it he never was in him to be able to climb a past the things of the world the carnal things but Jacob it was just so easy for him to do it see one purpose Jacob had that was that he longed for the birthright no matter how he got it just so he got it how did we get into the open book how did we see what we what we did how did we how did the seven seal open to us how is it look that it's so plain to us we're asking ourselves it's so plain how can they not see it how is it it's because there's something in the predestinated seed that allows us to do that and as that grows you will suppress the eso nature that's my purpose my personal Purpose with myself that's that's what I'm looking at I'm not looking to control my other brother I'm not looking to try and control him I want to be the best person I can be to be an example to him but I'm not even going to try to tell him to be more like me because that's going to make him an ESO he's gonna know who he is because as he is in his heart so he will be glory to God Prophet is talking about being true to the word paragraph 20. and that spirit that one birth this is beautiful one birth right produce twins so same message same Prophet for these twins that Spirit of that one birth is still represented in the world today it's coming to a head now the spiritual believer in the carnal man the carnal believer no one could say there wasn't both religious they were they didn't say that one served an idol and the other one God no they were both Servants of God problem 25 the carnal believer today or as long as I go to church and do what's right what difference does it make that's Esau's group bro see I didn't make it up right he still makes fun and despises the birthright he doesn't care for it but Jacob loved it same thing with Israel and Jacob Esau seemed like a better man he settled down and done charitable things he took care of all his old blind Daddy got him venison taken you can apply it spiritually we did already and was a good boy there's many things that carnal believers do in the line of religion helping societies paying off hospital bills for people and religious things that's not what I'm talking about let me tell you something I had to study this and actually go and prove to people there isn't a single uh religious organization on Earth that does more for the poor than the Catholics for all their failures let me ask you whenever there's a flood disaster where are the message charges the Catholics and the Muslims flying with Aid blankets food they're mobilized we don't even have that structure we gotten so satisfied with helping ourselves enriching ourselves in the message we got tucked away with this thing that you know we're going in the Rapture why should we care about the world we pale in comparison to them how many of the young people in the message go to the nearest orphanage and help feed the babies barely any how many of you would young people would go and and paint the fence the broken down fence and fix it off the widow woman in the street that you live you barely notice it we're pale in comparison to those that actually help the world and yet you don't have to go preach Doctrine to them you just go to fix that old lady's fence paint it up for her and she'll ask you boy where are you from you don't have to go there with quotes you know that's all it's going to take you just have to interact with them but those are the the things that our message churches fail to do you do you're meant to be not just pasta here but Pastor the community not just church here but Church of the community which means helping now I'm not saying create programs and have this that ends up being denominational you don't need the opposite to mobilize you but you also don't need to just go home after the word sit down have a fat lunch and then prepare for work on Monday and forget about your neighbors forget about the people in the street help pick up the milk bottles for the old lady and take it to a door and say hope you have a great day ma'am that's all it takes just one week of doing that she's going to ask you where are you from why are you so nice what do you believe why you dressed differently so tell you you know in our days this is how respectful we were what's happened in the message we're hiding away you know why we're hiding away we were we were following Esau religion Jacob has always been afraid to show himself but look what happens to one worldly person when they when they touch Jacob's essence for the first time it's unmistakable there's something about you they come up to you and say something about you there's something different about you now I know even the Esau say well that happens to us too of course everyone can see there's something about you but when they say there's something about me when I know who I am that's surprising because I'm not like you and no one's ever ever told me that before but suddenly starting to show out see that's that's where we're failing that's where our purpose we've stopped we thought our purpose is at church and it ends here but that's because we were primed by a whole bunch of results so I'm not encouraging you to start forming Church movements please far be it from that but I'm trying to tell you when but the prophet is saying they pay off hospital bills for people they do things that are religious they help societies I cannot explain to you I I actually took it down on paper to show how many hospitals they own how much of medications they have they have helped fund to help sick people how many things how many in in each City the Catholic church has done the Protestants cannot say anything they've just got a few programs here and there the the Catholics and the Muslims no matter what you say about them they will help the world in every disaster and we stand back and say oh my that that disaster is terrible look at those people how they're suffering in the rain thank God the Believers are safe God has answered our prayer that's our life here it's a disgrace of course I know in the in the places where there are believers I know the Believers if there's a they're in the disaster they will help them but it's amazing with all that we have all the resources we have we haven't even mobilized to do this and yet they have satisfied themselves in that they are helping the world They will receive a blessing from God that's for sure let me tell you that are there have been some of those people who have helped Believers in distress in flood disasters and so on it's been those people that open up their churches and clothe them with blankets and let them sleep and all that those denominational churches that did that God will bless them for it there will be them but they can never be a Jacob do you see how much there is to get over the spiritual loves the word Jacob loved it may get so many things wrong in life but will overcome at the end love for the birthright counts much more than carnally following and not loving it the thing is it's either in you or it's not you cannot make it up amen Prophet spoke out against Esau in his day do we know what the Jacob and Esau is in our day that's what we have to we we have been identifying him every Revival brings twins right do you know what twins are Prophet says it's a mixed multitude and we see that mixed multitude two sons of Isaac and Rebecca represents the world over every time there is Revival there's twins born every time we have a Revival twins are born ESO and Jacob were twins Esau has just good a man as Jacob and so on go right down to the bottom as Esau was loved a man of the world natural never cared nothing about the birthright turning northward uh but to Jacob it didn't make any difference how he got it there it was only one thing he had in his mind that was the birthright anything else how he got it that's the way it is with spiritual born churches watch this when the Catholic church had a Revival when Luther had a Revival when Wesley had a Revival are you seeing these churches actually had revivals but the prophet said the Catholic church had a Revival right and all down Through the Ages It produced Twins and when Pentecost had a Revival It produced twins when Moses had a Revival down in Egypt It produced twins a mixed multitude that's another word for twins a mixed multitude one word so let's let's zero it down into us today just a few more minutes in the early stages of brother Martin's Ministry when he preached from this thought this thought he explained how the Pentecostal age was a Revival and that it would produce twins in the church one he said would organize the gifts of the Holy Ghost into a denomination the other would remain true to the word under the ministry of the first and second poor today he taught that the difference between the twins in the in the seven Church age was the life they were leading right and one twin would be wild proud and have Liberties in the church against the word but not the other twin the other would remain humble and stick as close to the word as possible glory to God you believe that one twin would be wild and proud the other would remain humble the devil's lie is getting message people to preach the same thing the prophet was preaching back there right because it's it's easier to preach that what happened in the church age instead of talking about what's happening among us today message people still want to show that today it's about how messy one gets at the altar how emotional how spiritual it gets at the altar here God had that experience brother see how quiet he got because you're so used to hearing that so watch The Experience some of you parents in the message don't know this I was never in Egypt I was in this message from from the beginning my parents grew me up not doing anything wrong I dressed right from the very beginning I spoke right I never spoke slang never swore never drank never never smoked never had any girlfriends never straight I grew up perfect according to message standards so reached the point where they wanted me to have an experience with God and I had a Frank talk with my father and said tell me what to repent of I don't know because you want me to have that experience and my father and I had a had a relationship where we could talk this way and it was the first time he looked at me with a realization that there was no way I was going to have that experience being in the message all my life and being brought up not doing anything wrong so I was so specific with him I said so must I must I Repent of that one time I lied to Mom is that going to be it or when I fought with my brother does that make me a sinner I'm a Believer I believe the word ha you came from the denominations the some of the deacons the brothers they drank smoke they saw a change they could cry about wrong things they did and how unworthy they were and the message saved them I can't do that you brought me up but now when I see all the people come to the front and they're just crying and they're remembering what happened in their life before and so on they having this experience I don't have that and I can't fake it what do I do it's the first time he looked at me and he said Son there's only one thing the word has to be revealed to you personally when that happens you're going to know what to repent of and it happened and you'll never believe well you will now you'll never believe what it was I realized I had to repent of everything in my message life was self-righteousness I had to repent of self-righteousness which my parents never needed to repent of and repent means to change your thinking I realized when I came to the word and saw my place in the logos and it was revealed to me and I and I thought Lord I've been faking all this time I've been an Esau I need to repent of that thinking I know who I am now from that day changed I I don't stop crying glory to God amen so I just want to give you hope young people don't think you need to fake it parents encourage them into getting into the word family altars should be about the love of discussing and fellowship that's what it ought to be about it's correction correction correction correction you're going to get Esau's that's what's going to happen the prophet said the Revival has died in the shamed of him I just want to skip to paragraph 43 the Revival itself amongst the churches can you see that oh my so small uh it's it's paragraph 43 towards the middle he says he's been a nervous he says the Revival itself has died among the churches had died the end of paragraph 43 he says it seems to be a dead thump everywhere amen and notice this date is 1965. he spoke of himself after 63 of trying now if you if you read the messages from 63 he says he wants us start a Revival right you're trying to restart a Revival he was feeling the church needs another Revival and like he used to have and he felt that the church needs one desperately but it just never worked go read the messages we need a Revival we need a Revival he just could not get the first and second polls back like he used to in fact the the Lord told him why are you doing this here are you in the third pool why are you trying to bring back the second remember that and God began to show him his heart was not in the Revival mode anymore his heart was taken he couldn't help himself start to preach he wants to get the revival going and he goes to the cloud and 63 and what was preached in the seals he couldn't get out of that until he realized there was his Revival in the opening of the seal he was trying to get the church and and everything everybody knows the churches were were rejecting the cloud rejecting the seals rejecting the seventh seal it they just were not having a Revival with that but his Revival was there and no matter how we try to get away from it through 63 64.65 he couldn't help it kept going back kept going back to that amen anointed ones at the end time we're almost done I just want to show you this uh to the towards the bottom uh and then it happened can you see that right here come Wesley along with the new Revival the tassel that looks a little more like the wheat than what happened that organized and dried up and died the life went right into a shark and the shark come forth almost perfectly like the wheat but finally its Folly was made manifest in the last eight or ten years especially in the last three years now what does it do pull away from the wheat Watch What Happens he shows how every day every age brought a Revival then it died out then God showed him especially in the last three years after the seals got it right in the last three years of his ministry since the opening of the seventh seal that the Esau of the church was pulling away from him that was the death of the church ESO getting Dominion that's in the church ages how about now you're going to see it pulling away from us amen anointed ones of the Anton Park of 165 says now why hasn't there been an organization startup in these last 20 years of this great Revival they cannot organize around the open book no matter how you try they will always organize on everything else on message religion randomism every they will be able to organize your one Minister who gets the open book you can never have organized religion why because if you're preaching it your people become free they'll never expect they'll never accept organized religion they'll never accept the mark of the beast they'll be they'll be maturing in the rising of the sun they're maturing in that sunlight they cannot accept it they'll be become independent strong in their prayer strong in their relationship confident in their worship they'll be realizing who they are you can't organize somebody who knows who he is glory to God Amen says there isn't nothing Beyond The Grain it's back without an organization oh my a blind man could see that it cannot organize it so firmly against it it's the grain of wheat itself the son of man will be manifest the grain of weed will come back to itself the son of man in the last days what's happening the son of man coming here in the last days you cannot organize him just when you think he comes out and he breaks every law plucks corn on the Sabbath day and says this crazy thing I'm the lord of the Sabbath then he's on the tribe of Judah he knows no tribe of Judah Gad enough to like can touch the Scrolls only Levi can he walks into the synagogue he doesn't just touch it he opens it he reads it and then interprets it and says this day is the scripture fulfilled well they had a coronary you can imagine what the uprising booted out of the synagogue because firstly who is he of the tribe of Judah to touch the Scrolls meant for Levi only and then he starts teaching things that we've never kept before right he says well if your cow or your donkey Falls in a ditch on the Sabbath day he's interpreting the quotes don't you think you should save it you're just trying to keep a standard because you're afraid of what people will say so in other words you're what you're saying is you let your cow die that's crazy and to us it seems like well that's the correct thing to do to them no no no no that's not according to Cod that's not according to what's written that's not according and what happens things are just going to die he came out doing everything against what they thought defying what they thought you cannot organize the son of man he's going to defy all your expectations that's what happens when a Son of God grabs hold of the open book I'll ask you this question that Paul said are you apprehended by that which you have apprehended you know Paul says that I have been apprehended by that which I have apprehended you grabbed her into the word it's grabbed on to you glory to God so the condition of twins will with regards to the church is over they have never had a Revival in the world they've never had a Revival since Billy Graham and Oral Roberts they've tried everything ends in Failure I don't want to mention names but you know every single move the Pentecostal church has tried just plummets it reaches its peak and then down it goes scandal after scandal it can't hold everything else has been carnality false pretenses Ministries trying to copy the these three all ends in Perdition money woman popularity God's focus is moved and your Revival begins elsewhere God began to show the prophet after the seals that that would have to be new different Revival to birth the bride for the rapture once again a Revival takes place there's another Revival invisible Union of the bride of Christ uh paragraph 49 there says watch from the spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival amen when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God watch then again you see how the scriptures at that time there'll be a message sweep out to cast their blood cast that woman the elect here she is amen see this new Revival was a birth people were called out spiritual call and so on we've seen this happen in the message right God began to show how there'll be a message bring forth the bride it'll bring a Revival paragraph 182 of the third seal now that's the reason that the revivals we're supposed to have we have having denominational revivals but in 63 he's saying but we haven't had a real stirring this is during the third seal this is the prophet saying we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere no the bride hasn't had a Revival yet see I mean he went through first Paul second Paul he had campaigns he had healing campaigns and he's this and he still feels he hasn't had a Revival how can that be I mean you just you just go to message churches here and see something with discernment or something we had a Revival brother it's on the internet it'll be advertised we're having a Revival the gifts are uh uh exploding things are exploding in our churches and a prophet even with the first and second Paul said the bride hasn't had a Revival yet there's something wrong if they're trying to imitate Pentecost today he said there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again that's it that's the only Revival that's going to happen for you in the meantime all they'll do is keep up Esau religion seven Thunders is the bright Revival every Revival produces Twins and the Seven Thunders is the bride's Revival which means when the seven Thunders reveal themselves there'll be another set of twins and we've seen it listen it's no I'm sorry to be saying this we've seen when people came out with seven Thunder Seven Virtues seven Thunders is the seventh under the seven voices we've seen all that we've seen where it went to right we've seen them try to revive the gifts they said that the seven Thunders produced that what happened churches plummeted immorality teenage pregnancies adultery at the very top fraud financial fraud Non-Stop what happened to the Holy Ghost what happened to the boasting now it's like no no no we distance ourselves that thing was wrong they never apologized for having done the damage they've done but they've distanced themselves and say no we we didn't really believe that but we're not with them anymore that's it that's what we get so to think we've already seen that effect whatever and of course you know what happens with both sides you'll get the one side that goes into the emotions the other side says no no no that's so wrong and this other side becomes cold and formal we must study it's quote this and quote that and this Doctrine and that Doctrine until the doctrines become so complicated nobody can believe it nobody can understand it that's where we went to both sides right consequences and now it's amazing they're trying to revive the same things again when we've literally witnessed its failure so Saints in closing in this message we will have to see a carnal believer and a spiritual believer the problem is that the carnal believer is going to look a whole lot more like the real deal he's the one who looked like the good one say what the tape says literally preach God sent a prophet be a William Branham fanatic prayer Warrior inspired by first and second polls keep all the standards of the message religiously loved by everyone respected by everyone preach awarded our ministry that that satisfies everyone will deceive the even the ministry of the day Isaac because you'll never be able to know whether the person actually knows the message or not the problem is that they don't realize in their hearts the birthright was never Theirs to begin with they don't really love the word as much as they love the fame of the word the fame of the message the name of the message all you have to do I tell you what for a lot of ministers it's just a job it's an occupation you're getting some income we're taking care of our family and that's what it is sadly that's where it's become and if members don't and it's going to happen members dwindle then we've got to produce programs to get more members if you're preaching the word you don't have to worry about members because you'll be as Christ all that the father has given will come amen yeah I don't have to sweat it out or work like they used to preach the revealed word and the true seed will come I'm not interested in three kinds of Believers in my church the other two have to get out amen that was for another time not interested in anymore if they're not handling the heat they have to move all you have to do is talk to them about the coming of the Lord and the Seven seal and watch them close up but the life but this but that right and talk about the seven Thunders and what it is and you see their react it's their Birthright they're the ones who have the greatest respect among Believers but they'll split on what you say they despise the birthright and they don't even know it it's the very thing they were birthed into and they don't realize that very Revival and enjoyed for so long was in fact the result of the seven Thunders and the opening of the seventh seal how much have messaged people benefited from the message of their humble prophet we've we've benefited financially we've benefited family wise we've we have better relationships with our wives and our husbands we have more respectful children how much have we benefited we've had friends we've traveled the world had it not been for the message some of us would still be stuck in a small little Hometown we were born in but we travel the world we've seen the world we've preached we've visited people we've had people from uh from other parts of the world come to see us we've benefited so much from this move of the message from this humble Prophet who had barely any education didn't take any money from it didn't take any claim for it and was rejected right to the very end and we built Empires for ourselves on the back of that humble prophet it's ridiculous the ones who are not recognized the ones who didn't enjoy all the fame the great experience of the message all the Acclaim all the great food suppers are the ones with the birth who the birth part actually belongs to the predestinated ones who will not falter as time goes by the Esau group are the ones who will fall away with internet proofs against brother maram message and they will fall with it there's a lot of people a lot of them are fighting now on the internet against those who are against the prophet eventually they'll get taken that's what that's what will happen because if they don't have the the opening of the word they don't have the book they are going to fall with it and it won't be long you'll start hearing the Bible is false because that move is already taking place in our children's schools it's already taking place the Bible is being proved to be false they're coming up with archaeological findings your your educated children are going to look at archaeological findings that come to your dad they actually said Noah was just a story the ark never happened there was never ever a great flood what are you going to say then if they give up on the prophet they're going to give up on the Bible yeah he the Jacob the Jacobs will come in from behind and sweep it away from the esos he will recognize the coming of the Lord at Bethel he will have a personal experience of the angels of the Lord ascending and descending upon the son of man he will meet the coming of the Lord himself he will wrestle with the word until his name is revealed and he receives the revelation of who he really is to the individual follow the type you will realize it when the message come to you it was because of the opening of the seventh seal and it's something caught your attention though you didn't know what it was the one in you who received the message is the firstborn of the twins your first nature your intellect your very sincere religious side you admired all the lovely people in the message you saw all around you you wished you could be like them how many of you some of you Old-Timers think oh if only it could be like it was in the beginning come on right remember that where everyone loved each other we're in each other's homes now it's like you can barely visit anyone you have to film before you arrive right and you can only eat if they tell you you can eat before you can just pitch up and open the pot this looks great right now you can't now it's like cold you know sorry brother we're not available right now we have a thing I know the old times because I was there I wake up one morning and I'm sleeping under the dining room table and there's 15 people in my house and my bed has four people in it I don't even know who moved me and there's other children next to me and we were hey hi God bless you we're from Durban I'm not kidding that's the way life was people two in the morning Brothers say come to Brother Steve my car is stuck in Ladysmith two o'clock in the morning freezing cold my father is getting up go find a mechanic in the message wake him up and drive to Ladysmith and fix the car through the night get back in the morning feed the whole family get them on their way pay for the parts put them on the road bye there you go yes that's how it was nowadays it's very different brother do you have insurance amen I'm not saying it's going to go back to but you you remember those days when things felt friendlier and and you feel like if only it could go back to that it's not because it's pulling away time it's the time where the wheat is separating it's time for individual growth you can't depend on your brother's strength anymore you're not everything is going to break the way it is revealed is even your family might break the closest ones to you and you will have to stand every time you try to say something the other Esau shut you up and told you you had no right to ask such questions or say such things anyway what what did you know you just came in recently right that's how you were made to feel but something inside you was stirring and wanted to be free you love this message from the word go and you felt you could die for it just realize that struggle you're going through in your life as these two forces in you at War trust what your heart says it's who you really are your head is going to try a whole of things but that seventh seal is open the book is in your heart trust what your heart says when you reach it you will stand before God and say I am Jacob change me Lord amen trust what your heart said as you think in your heart so you are as I think in my heart so I am may the Lord bless you Saints brother Chad you can come up the musicians we can stand together Saints you love the Lord amen I didn't mean to offend anyone just got to say what God has put in our hearts and we've got to understand really understand what is happening around us today this isn't just some Revival we're having with the word where it sounds so good it sounds great we come to church we dress up nicely we're rejoicing no there's a battle happening and even though we're having good times here in Fellowship everything we've said here in this place is going to go out and they are going to slay us it's going to happen and if you are associated with it they're going to slay you young people you're going to have troubles at youth camps you can have troubles at meetings because you're going to have to stand for what you believe or assimilate you're gonna you're gonna go to youth meetings where you're going to see others behave in a certain way you're going to feel like I need to be an easel and and what do I do right or you or the other arm it may be about emotions or you'll be meeting with some user they'll be like brother random said this and this and that and that and this and that brother Daniel said something beautiful you don't need to preach the seventh seal by mentioning the seventh seal you can preach the seventh seal in the open book without even mentioning it and this has to be so that even a 90 year old person a 12 year old person can grab a hold of the open book and start to live according to how they are amen that's how it is what do we do with the theory we just preach and you catch it supernaturally you don't have to have the ability to intellectually explain everything neither does it have to produce some great signs and wonders and emotions and uh crying screaming slain in the spirit falling down twitching all of that no it doesn't have to do that it can happen to some it may not happen to someone else I'm not one of those people I couldn't dance to save my life if I had to and I often tell people when they when they speak about music and dancing it's wonderful it's scriptural it's there but and they tell you well we dance like David danced no you didn't because dancing is not choreographed dancing David danced like a madman whooped off his clothes and jumped around in circles because he was rejoicing at the word don't tell him you dance like David danced because that's how he danced he must have looked ridiculous so that his wife scorned him don't follow emotions after what the denominational systems have put out there's no choreographed sexy dancing that fits with the worship of God there's no sensual kind of behavior and you know let me tell you this is how easy it is when you preach the word all you got to do is let this glory to God the Lord is wonderful isn't he doesn't he touch your heart you already feel the emotion start Rising because a man can use Charisma to bring out the emotions in you that's an Esau right there you should be able to feel that pull if you're just hearing the word as if Christ was saying blessed are the meek not even needing song service or hype not even needing anything just reading the word preaching the word praying just you should feel the pull and in there you feel God coming down touching you without the addition of any humanism you don't need to fake it the experience you need is the word opening up to you personally that's what it's all about brother Chad and I were talking not about this but just a simple thing like people tell you you need to find a balance who has a balance how do you find a balance the prophet the word says an unjust weight is an Abomination to God you know what you know those scales with the two balances it's like you're in the marketplace and you're selling rice for one pound but your weight is actually 750 grams or something but it's written on there one pound that's a false weight it's an Abomination imagine the Lord saying that's an abomination and this is what we do with each other in the message who has the balance and who's the standard some person claiming to have the balance has a false weight because he feels in his life he's balancing off emotions versus intellectualism so he feels secure I've got it because the way I have it works for me that's not the same with someone else and you've got to realize that do not judge yourself with someone else do not try one church is emotional so we must be flat yes we all need to change some of us need to become more emotional some of us I used to be sitting there on that side of the church the word burning inside me and I want to say amen and I used to look like this but in my heart I wanted to scream I felt it and I was like yes yes amen until I just can't help it anymore and wasn't even preaching that helped me I had to come out of my own skin and some of us you just sit there and you just weep you don't even have to stand shout the tears just flow or inside some some people don't even react but inside their heart they leave the church and go fix something right away that's all it takes nobody's going to see that balance but they've got it amen just be who God has made you to be in your heart do not judge yourself by anybody live free bride of Christ it is who you are the Lord bless you brother chair willing [Music] glorified we glorified [Music] Lord be glorified in my heart in my heart Lord be glorified be glorified him [Music] My Heart Lord be glorified today in my life in my life Lord be glorified [Music] feel your refining bye foreign [Music] my what a Capstone [Music] a Capstone that takes us deep inside he said this would be a message that was introspective I found it to be so for me I don't know about you but I think I found a bit of myself in every part he talked about but I know I know beyond the shadow of a doubt who I am because the word identified me may have been confused in the outer realm for years and may have tried this and tried that but the word gave me my true identification and if the word can give me a true identification then the word can bring me into the full manifestation of that that identification not what I think I ought to be but what he's determined I am to be is what I want to be for years we've thought we should be like this and we should be like that and I should be more like this and I should be more like that and I don't know about you but I spend a lot of effort going down the wrong road because I can never be what I thought I was supposed to be but God planted a seed in his children and that seed is one of his attributes and that attribute has a certain expression and that's what he wants that's what Daniel was telling us to be who you are in your office is Christ in you in your office the Capstone was telling us don't imitate don't don't be false in any way don't pretend amen just seek Him and heed that word the water the life the spirit it'll all bring that seed to full manifestation and that seed will bear fruit in our lives and that's the only fruit that will be pleasing to God is the fruit that comes from the seed that he planted amen that's all I want that's what I want in my life and I'm sorry for all the other things that I've done I'm sorry for all the other efforts that I put forth all the other failures and all the other wanderings about I'm sorry for all of that but on I want more than anything is to stay where the water is flowing and where the sunshine is shining and to become all that God wants to become in this Tabernacle oh my I think we all could spend some time meditating on what we've heard this weekend and I thank God for it you know it's easy to come to meetings and it's it's very easy to preach in a way that stirs people up and gets them really excited and gets a lot of emotion going to mess everybody walk out the door feeling like wasn't that great meetings but what our brothers did through laboring in the word and yielding themselves to God was to come down and not try to make themselves the great preacher and us really excited and say we had great meetings but to come down and bring something that will bring a change in our lives that'll permanently affect us and change the way we think the way we act what we do tomorrow and get us com to identify who Christ said we are and give us the faith to just be that and if that can be accomplished and all that'll be the greatest success that we have ever experienced is just to accept what God said we were just to say you know when the Virgin Mary she didn't know she was the Virgin Mary her parents didn't call her Virgin Mary she wasn't raised being told she was the Virgin Mary she was just a woman from an obscure place from a mean city of Nazareth with with no with nothing special about her she was a teenage girl espouse to an older man amen and she was just in the routine of life and an angel messenger come down and says you're highly favored and she was the most unlikely person to be highly favored by God but he says you're highly favored of God and then he begins to tell her you are the reality of Isaiah's prophecy 700 years ago when Isaiah spoke he was talking about you when you were in synagogue and they picked up the scroll and opened Isaiah and went to the seventh chapter and said a virgin count conceived at that moment Isaiah prophesied God knew it was you you're the one and you know that woman when she said be it unto me according to your word she was making an impossible Claim by an impossible Faith to say I believe what you say about me that I am actually literally the word of God made flesh but it was her accepting what he said that made it possible you know we've had an angel messenger in this day tell us who we are but we need to have a revelation strike our hearts to say that ain't nothing but the truth I didn't earn it I haven't earned it I can't earn it I'm not worthy of it I'm not acceptable but it doesn't matter it's still the truth and now there's no other identification I want now God be it unto me according to your word oh May May the things we've heard Not Fade Away may they become living realities in our life May each one of us find our identification in Christ may he reveal to us who we are and help us to surrender to that and allow him to bring all the potential out of the seed not through effort but through surrender amen God bless you all I've so enjoyed the services I so enjoyed the fellowship enjoyed the fellowship together around the world enjoyed our brothers and the gift that God's placed in them and say God bless you God bless you all this is bow our hearts together and thank the Lord dear Lord Jesus I thank you so much [Music] that you care enough about us Lord that you'll expose us to us God that you love us so much you expose our wrong ideas and our wrong thinking not because you wish to condemn us mock us but because you want us to be free you expose the times that we act like Esau trying to gain acceptance when we played the part of the hypocrite religiously you've exposed it to us Lord not to shame us but you've exposed us so we could be free so that we could realize I don't have to pretend I don't have to try or put on an act I don't have to gain acceptance from another person for God you have ordained that I will be part of this bride in this end time it's your word your plan your thought your predestination it's your word it's your spirit it's your life it's all you God help us to be really real God help each one of us help me Lord to be really real to be genuine Lord and what I say and what I do and how I act and God made the reality come as you reveal yourself to me and as you reveal me to me Lord May there come a reality a reaction of that Revelation and may the reaction become the the real life that you always wanted to display in this vessel while we love you we pray that you would bless each each member of the body that's here that you would bring us into the potential you placed in us when you had thoughts of us before the foundation of the world may we move into that grow into that very expression God move away all of these all from our lives move away the old Jacob nature Lord and help us to be Israel help us to be bride help us to be Mrs Jesus Christ Lord I pray to bless our brothers Lord that you would just restore to them all that they poured out bless them give them fresh inspiration may they go home carrying a tremendous testimony and may they go back lord and bless their churches at home Lord I pray you bless the family that's traveled here with brother Daniel Lord just bless them abundantly for they've blessed us with their presence and each of us Lord as we walk out of these doors in a few moments May the impact of what's taken place what's been spoken the word that's been given to us these last few days may not leave as we leave the sanctuary but may that word be a seed that's planted deep and good ground and the ground of our souls Lord it may bring forth a Bountiful Harvest For Your Glory oh Lord that's what we desire Lord I love you I thank you for your goodness to us thank you for the word that you've given and God that word will not return unto you void but you spoke it for a purpose and I believe with all my heart it is it will continue to fulfill that purpose we love you father we thank you Lord Jesus we ask your blessings over all we do and may you have a greater preeminence in us than you've ever had before in Jesus name we pray amen may God bless you all I so love you so thankful for you for your lives you live for the testimonies that
