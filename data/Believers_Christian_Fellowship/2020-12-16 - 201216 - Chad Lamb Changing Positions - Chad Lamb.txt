our bibles and turn to ezekiel we're going to continue on with the same line of thinking we've been on and asked the lord to continue to unfold his word to us amen but we're going to look at ezekiel 28 and verse 12. and as you're turning there i had a couple people ask me about the watch night service and the curfew that the governor has extended till january second but there's an exemption in the curfew for religious observances so we are under an exemption so we are not the curfew does not apply to us for our watch night service so in case you were wondering now everybody knows amen i also want to remind you if you want to sing a special for that to please get with brother mike that'll be thursday december 31st at 8 30. so we're looking forward to that let's look at ezekiel chapter 28 and verse 12. son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and send him thus saith the lord god thou seallest up to some full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou has been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sardis topaz the diamond the barrel the onyx the jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tabrts and of thy pipes was prepared in thee and the day that thou was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so thou wast upon the holy mountain of god thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee and let's bow our heads and ask the lord to bless the reading of his word dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for your word we ask lord that you would just come now break the bread of life with your own hands lord and feed it to us your sheep i pray you would take over this vessel lord as i yield it to you and that you administer through a gift you've placed in this vessel of clay by the power of your holy ghost may you bring us your word lord may we see lord with clearer vision than we've ever seen before may you lift us up on high lord and may we be all that you've called us to be in this hour we ask you to preeminence among us and take your liberty here tonight in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can have your seats we want to continue on uh the way we've been discussing and talking about this great battle and these forces and these armies and our position and i titled this tonight changing positions and as we go i hope you understand this i think a year or a little more over a year ago i ministered in this line of thinking and i was breaking down this subject but i want to address it again with what we've been talking about let's turn quickly over to isaiah 14 and catch another scripture here in isaiah isaiah chapter 14 and verse 12. isaiah 14 and 12 how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations brother branham begins to talk about this in the message greatest battle ever fought he said the great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven i mean that's so important to recognize amen that's why heaven has to be reconciled heaven and earth and so we go on it says and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles and satan came to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself he had satan came down to just come down to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and begin in us and it has been raging ever since so we want to recognize that this is the same war like we've been talking about this is not a new war this is a continuation of the heavenly war and i would say it's still a heavenly war but it's taking place in us amen and that's why you know brother branham told us he says you're going to find out someday that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere far away heaven's right here just moving at a faster speed it's another dimension so we say it's a heavenly war we're not talking about here we're here on earth and way way way up there is heaven somewhere no heaven is here it's another dimension amen it's moving faster but it's having influence over what's happening here amen and so there's still this battle is still taking place in the heavenlies we know that by the scripture because we wore not against flesh and blood but against principalities powers and and high places and and now high places is in heavenly places so we know that the battle was still going on the heavenlies amen but it's taking place in us and it's the heavenly realms and influences that are working in us so i'd say that we are the battleground amen and instrumental in what's taking place is taking place in us amen let's turn to revelation chapter 12. so i hope that we realize as we talk about this that we don't start looking back at what happened and forward at what will happen but we are always tuned and recognizing what is going on right now it's not like we can say well there was a battle in heaven and there will be another battle a great battle at the end of all things but you have to realize that that battle is going on now and if we don't realize that we start looking back and looking forward and we start getting lazy and we start missing the whole and we miss the whole point we miss what's going on all around us and in us and through us and all about us amen and what the struggles are in life and what they're all about so we've got to stay tuned in revelation chapter 12 verse 7 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength in the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused him before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death so now we when we look back at ezekiel and ezekiel 28 in ezekiel 28 lucifer had a title and that title was the anointed cherub and the cherub that covereth so he was the anointed covering cherub over the mercy seat so he had a title and he had a position but we know when the war broke out in heaven that he lost that position he was cast out and he was cast down he went from being the mighty angel he was cast down he was cut down but then we find him over here in revelations chapter 12 and he has a new title and over here he's not called the anointed cherub that covereth but over here he's called the accuser of the brethren so we look he's he's changed position he's no longer the anointed chair of that covered but now we find him back in heaven he's been cut down and cast out but now he's back there as the accuser of the brethren and we know that he's not going to stay there there's going to come a time that he'll be cast out of that position and that has everything to do with you and i and that's what we want to talk about tonight that that next casting down but before that i want to turn to job if we can go all the way back to job again job chapter 1. job chapter 1 and verse 6. in job chapter 6 it says now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them now this is after the war in heaven when he was cut down and he and brother baby tells us he was cast out and we'll read those quotes in just a second he was cast out and cast into earth and then the war broke out in eden and he came into the to the serpent to deceive the woman in eden and now after that this is after that in the book of job now that there's a day when the sons of god come to present themselves before the lord and satan come also among them and we know what is satan's title in revelation chapter 12 his title is the accuser of the brethren amen and so don't forget that we're going to hold on to that and talk about that more let's let's read a few more verses here and the lord said unto satan when's cometh down then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the lord said unto satan hastil considered my servant job now now this is interesting we've talked about this a lot and brother bannon speaks a lot about job but now the the devil has been roaming to and fro up and down in the earth and now there's a day that the sons of god present themselves and satan comes among them also and god asks satan what have you been doing well i've been going to and fro and i've been looking and inspecting and god says have you considered job i want you to look at job amen why what is the devil's title he is satan is no longer he's no longer lucifer he's lost that position now he's got a title of devil or satan and he's the accuser of the brethren and god is saying hey you accuser of the brethren check out job let's what have you considered job amen what about job and here's what he goes on to say he says and lord said unto satan has thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth god and askew with evil then satan answered the lord and said does joe fear god for naught has not thou made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substances increased in the land but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face and the lord said unto satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so satan went forth from the presence of the lord and we know what happens in the book of job he goes down and he smites him with boils he takes first he takes away all of his goods and all of his children and then he comes the second time before the lord and the lord says have you considered job amen so so the satan is still he's right here the accuser of the brother he's there he's presenting himself he has access to the throne of god he's back in heaven and he's there as accuser of the brethren and god is now saying what about job go look at job and he accuses job he says is job serve you for not amen you've got a hedge of protection you've blessed his way that's why he serves you if you take away his blessings he'll stop serving you because this is who he is he's the accuser of the brethren and god takes up the challenge amen because he knows what's in job because job is representing you and i job is representing the believer that'll go through trials it'll be tested we'll go through hardship but will not sin against god with their mouth will not disbelieve so we have this whole scenario that takes place and we can see what satan is now doing amen in his new position as accuser of the brethren brother brahm said in the first seal now notice at the end time at the end of the church ages now he is called he and his children are called the antichrist because anything that's against christ is antichrist and anything that's against the word is against christ because christ is the word now he's antichrist then in revelation 12 7 and 9 when satan has cast out the accuser i want to put that down because i want to read it when we we haven't got time now because it's 25 till 10 or 15 till 10 but in revelation 12 7 and 9 satan the spirit the devil which is up there now accuser of the brethren all right the church is taken up and satan is cast out when the church goes up satan comes down then satan incarnates himself in the antichrist and is called the beast so let's let's keep that in your mind when the church goes up satan comes down so i think it's important that the church goes up and then the church is being called up higher and keeps going up because when when the church goes up satan comes down because satan is the accuser of the brethren and when did he become the accuser of the brethren when he deceived eve and when adam and eve fell now he had an accusation against the children of god and that accusation against the children of god somehow gave him access to heaven as an accuser there's something going on and i'm not going to claim to know it i can't put terms to it i don't i don't say i can comprehend all of this but he's got access in the heaven he's returned back into the heavenlies and he's there when the sons of god present themselves to god and he's there as an accuser of the brethren amen and god and job is showing this whole relationship in job as the accuser of the brethren but we find he couldn't accuse job because job believed god amen now let's turn to john chapter 8 i'm still trying to lay foundational pieces here and well hopefully by the grace of god tie them together john chapter 8 and verse 46. john chapter 8 and verse 46 which of you convinces me of sin and if i say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of god heareth god's word you therefore heareth them not because you are not of god and jesus is looking at them he says who of you convinces me of sin this word convinced means to reprove rebuke to convict to tell one's fault amen to to find fault with or correct and jesus says who can who which one of you can accuse me of sin because the pharisees were on earth they were playing the part of the accuser accusing jesus but jesus says you can't accuse me of sin because jesus knows what sin is the brother of him tells us sin the only sin is unbelief amen all the actions that we call sin are attributes of unbelief but the real sin is unbelief and jesus knew where he stood on the word and he said which one of you can accuse me of sin and brother brahman says this in in the message identification he says he was god's word expressed and properly vindicated identified when he stood here on earth he said if i do not the works of my father then don't believe me and he said which one of you can accuse me of sin i would like to open that just a little bit for you if it be permissible you see sin is unbelief there's only two things two channels that you can live by one of them is faith and the other is unbelief he that believeth not is condemned already smoking drinking committing adultery lying stealing carnal impersonations those things are attributes of unbelief if you was a believer you wouldn't do those things no you do that because you're not a believer and we we all of us we all realize that that our flesh is not yet a believer and the human spirit is not yet a believer but we've been born again the life on the inside has been quickened to life and it becomes the control tower that control the outer man and the outer man will still crave things that are wrong amen but there's something on the inside that won't let it continue on amen we'll say no we won't go that far what is that that's the believer on the inside and the believer on the inside says no we're not going to be an unbeliever we're not going to have attributes of unbelief and it doesn't mean we won't fail it doesn't mean we won't fall it doesn't mean the outer man won't be tempted to do wrong but there's a believer on the inside that says we're not going to do that amen we're not going to lie we're not going to steal we're not going to cheat we're not going to lust we're not going to do those things and why don't we do that because we're believers because we believe god and the believer is on the inside and the message go wake jesus he says oh we need deepness of sincerity we need something back we don't need so much showmanship we need the holy spirit living among us to where men can say who can accuse me of sin sin is unbelief this brother bam says we need the holy ghost amen where men can say who could accuse me of sin amen that's a bold statement when you can come to the place where you can say who can accuse me of sin because you can follow somebody around with a tape recorder or video them all day and you can probably find infractions in their character let's just say if i followed you all day i get a week and i got you on camera all day for a week and i say i'm going to check every infraction and everything that is against the nature of christ or contrary to the word i want to ask you would i have something to report if you followed me i would you would have something to report i'll just tell you that way but that's not what we're looking at we're that's not what god is looking at god is looking at the faith on the inside there's something in you that was before the foundation of the world that could believe the word amen the way he's given the word in this age amen not to have to change it or manipulate but to receive it the way he's given it through a prophetic message through the messenger and now there's only one sin that's unbelief and when we can get to this place where he can say who can accuse me of sin you can accuse me the outer man of failing you can accuse me of saying something harsh or maybe having a a wrong attitude or saying something wrong or doing something wrong but you can't accuse me of disbelieving this word because there's something in me that's the believer amen it's not my intellect amen it's not the outer man it has nothing to do with the outer man there's a believer in me that's been born again by the spirit of god that always believes the word that cannot disbelieve this word despite what goes out in the honor man the inner man is a believer and who can accuse me because this outer man is going to change this isn't me amen i'm not identifying with this anymore this isn't me that's why when brother branham says you know you've really never seen me i can shout hallelujah because you've really never seen me and i say who can accuse me of sin i'm not talking about this tent that i'm living in i'm talking about the genuine me on the inside so as we as we look deep into the word we have to start we have to start separating the flesh and go a little deeper by the word and separate the the spirit and the soul like the bone and the morrow and not identify with the outer man now that doesn't give us any license because there's nothing in us that wants to do wrong there's nothing deep inside of us that wants to sin or displease god amen the unbelievers on the outside so if we if we want to if we take that as a license to do what we want then we haven't been born again that's what the prophet tells us so he goes on and says there's only one sin that's unbelief that's faith or unbelief he that believeth not is condemned already you can smoke drink and do those things because you don't believe but if you do believe you'll do otherwise it's because either faith or unbelief is in you now i'm laying all this down as a foundation because i want to tie some things together in the seventh seal in the seventh seal brother graham says it's an old battle that started way back beyond time it's amazing how much brother ram talks about this that there is only one war that's taking place and the war is over god's word and it's an old battle that started way back beyond time and then there was satan and his angels was kicked out and then they come to earth and the battle set it again because eve broke down the barrier from where she was isolated behind the word of god and from the very hours satan won the battle over god's word because one of his subjects the weaker let down the bar listen to this sentence and that's exactly how he's won the battle every time has been because one of his subjects let down the bar from the word that's what the devil wants he wants one subject to let down the bar on the word because that's how he's had victory from the very beginning when one subject let down the bar on the word when eve disbelieved the word and was seduced by the devil and left the word and took the lie amen he got victory there and that's how he's had victory every time and that's why this bride must be a word bride and she must stand on the word and the word only that's why god's given us such a word in this day because that's exactly how he's won the battle every time has been when because one of his subjects has let down the bar from the word now let's go to romans i want to read several scriptures in a row here romans chapter 4. romans chapter 4 and verse 9. come this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he receiveth the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised so he's telling us is he's the father by faith and faith was righteousness was imputed to him by faith amen it's faith in the word of god that wins the day and it's considered righteousness and our justification and i want to read that in several places so that we can move forward romans chapter 5 let's go over here to rome chapter 5 verse 1 therefore being justified by faith being justified by it didn't say justified by actions it said justified by faith therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith unto his grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god galatians chapter three let's jump over the galatians and read two scriptures there and then we're going to come back to romans for one more galatians chapter 3 and 11. but that no man is justified by the law on the side of god it is evident for the just shall live by faith so how do we live we live by faith how do the just live by faith now verse 24 wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith now let's go back to romans chapter 8. and verse 31. romans 8 31 what what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died ye rather that has risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us i want to i want to focus on that verse 33 who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect what is the devil's what is satan's title in heaven the accuser of the brethren who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect why because he justified by faith and by faith amen he can only accuse us for unbelief but there's no unbelief in the bride i'm not talking about what we look at on the outside but i'm talking about that predestination see that's on the inside that was predestinated to come forth in this day amen it's not to come forth in unbelief it's not to come forth in a denominational age where the truth has not been restored amen it's not come and limited in growth because there's there's only so much light there's only so much of a portion but we've come to the hour of unlimited growth we've come into the hour of unlimited maturity we've come into the hour of unlimited light an unlimited word we've come to the full measure of the full word with the full revelation of christ the mystery of god revealed in this day under the seventh angels ministry so there's no more limiting factor on faith there's no more limiting factor on obedience through the word there's no more limiting factor on this bride to hold her back from being all that she's predestinated to be amen there's no more deception to keep her from coming to the full truth so there's going to be if there's there's a bride in this day that can accept the word of this age and as he reveals that word she keeps stepping forward in that word amen who can accuse her of sin who can lay anything to the charge of god's elect in this hour that'll take the full word of this hour and the full measure the word was delivered and say i believe it in the name of jesus christ i believe it who can lay anything to her charge amen who could accuse her of sin amen you may follow her around and say you know what the other day she said something against her husband and she got a little cross with her children and praise god amen you're not justified by works amen works are an expression of your faith but it's not your justification because it works for your justification amen then we would have to go back to the wesleyan day and work and work and work and be justified but we're justified by faith god first comes to us and say you're mine your mind your record's clear i've chosen you amen you are justified just as if you've never done it before and after he's called you and told you who you are you're my bride i'm uniting with you then he says now listen there's some things that i want to explain to you amen this is what i like and you say yes lord that's what i want to do this is what i like this is what i prefer this is the way i want you to to act and to dress and behave and you say absolutely lord not because i had to do that first but because first he told me who i was told me i'm justified by faith amen you're free from your sin you've been delivered from your sin and now you say oh god i love you take me i'm yours and then he says and sweetheart i like this and i prefer it this way and you say that's what i want to do that's the way i want to do it amen who can accuse her of sin she's been justified by faith but she's justified in this day she's justified by faith and wants she's justified by faith in the full word of god the seals have been taken off the book the whole bible has been opened up the whole book of redemption is in plain view amen god the mighty god has been unveiled amen it's not what it was in previous days this is a different day and it's going to bring different results brother bam says in the token i think it's important to note that brother branham preached the token after the seals and he said he couldn't preach it he said i've waited a long time to preach this message because when he's preaching token he's beginning to explain to us amen that there's been a transition that there's been something changed and and i'll just read this and pray god can help me share what's on my in the token he says what the life watch the life is took for the blood the life itself is took see the life it took for the blood see the blood was applied and the life could not come on the believer then for the life of the animal he's talking all the way back in the sacrifice and the passover amen there was a lamb that was slain and innocent one as a substitute and the chemistry of the blood was put over the lentil on the doorpost so that the death angel would know that there has been a lamb slain here amen but and then all the sacrifices were showing that the same thing that there was a substitutionary bloodshed for you for the sins of the people but now brother man when he comes to preach the token he's he's laboring on this fact that the life now is the token it's the life what life the same life that was in jesus christ come back into his bride and that is the token amen that is the evidence that the blood has been shed that is the evidence that the blood has been applied [Music] so he's preaching this after the seals because that's where he has to preach this see but see instead of a human being he's talking about jesus christ it was a super super superhuman being and that makes the human being now not only a human being but he's a son and daughter of god of the super super super super life that was in him come back upon you and changes you from a center and the things of the world a church member and a denominational goer to a born-again christian filled with the spirit the life of god just flowing through you like sparks from an anvil as you walk full of virtue and love and gentleness and as the holy spirit moving speaking oh my there you are and with that and with the what hearing the message watching the pillar of fire and the blessed assurance i passed from death in the life no therefore no condemnation at all this is what he's saying with the token amen and he would say he says in this same message he said it was the lamb and luther's day it was the lamb in wesley's day but now it's token time you say what is he talking about it's always been the baptism of the holy ghost it's always been the holy ghost and the believers but yes but it's always been portion portion of word portion of word portion of word and we know that the holy ghost has been bound bound and changed bound in these denominational rivers for nearly 2 000 years amen but it's going to be loosed at the end time the holy spirit back upon the people what was loose the word was loosed and the word and the spirit are the same thing don't separate these things and separate them and divide them and say well i've got the word the the true word and the true spirit are one and the same and so when that word came back amen it was the it was the token it was the life now now that wasn't partial anymore he said it was the lamb in luther's day it was the lamb in wesley's day but now it's token time amen because there was a limitation in luther's day because the word was bound the word was limited there was a limitation in wesley's day amen it was the lamb amen and that's why there had to be a mediator back there on the throne to cover the sins of ignorance and then because the word wasn't opened yet but now he's saying there's a transition now it's token time now it's that life amen that life has come back on full display and now the life is for the token now it's the life that's on display so it's not it's not looking back there's no previous age involved amen this is a different time amen this is token time this is the time that the full life amen the the blood that was shed there was a price of redemption paid the blood has to be applied to you but the evidence of that blood being applied is that full life that was released at the opening of the seals as coming down upon the believer and it's not a partial understanding with a partial life it's a full understanding that brings the full life praise god therefore therefore no condemnation at all no condemnation at all you can't condemn what god has sealed and god has sealed those who believe because when when abraham received the seal of circumcision he sealed it because he believed god and god gave him a sign a token of his faith which was circumcision and now the token time the baptism of holy ghost is the seal or the evidence that you believe you believe god and he sealed you with his seal of promise you believed god and received the baptism the holy ghost because you believed so now no condemnation at all branham says in the invisible union of the bride of christ now your old book is gone with your old union now your name and your old has been transferred now do you do you mean to tell me that my old book god put it in the sea of forgetfulness you stand perfectly before god i want you to catch what the prophet saying he's talking in the invisible union of the bride of christ because we've come to the invisible union amen we've come to the headship uniting with the body like i said it's not like any other age this is the most threatening age to the devil that has ever been this is you are a bigger threat amen you are the biggest threat that is on earth at this time you are dangerous to his kingdom and that's why this word is coming this hour to bring a people to bring the elect in this hour to a position that's different than any other position because never before has he gone back and showed the whole plan of redemption it was being measured out it was being displayed through the bible through every character through every type through every shadow he was showing this plan but now in the end time he takes the cover off he peels the seals away and he goes back and he shows you exactly what he's been doing through the whole bible and even goes beyond that and shows you what's been in the mind of god before he even put a bible in print and before there was even a bible character on this earth amen this message has taken us back to the mind of god amen why so that there can be a people that will believe the full word of god [Applause] because it's essential for satan losing his position it's essential that there's a people who believes the full word and that he no longer can accuse the elect now he goes on to say an invisible union now your name is on the new book not the book of life but the lamb's book of life what the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural union but your new bride hallelujah your new life is in the lamb's book of life your marriage certificate hallelujah is the book of life your marriage certificate was your name written there before the foundation of the world then what do you have to be worried about amen what what is all the struggle what is all the condemnation what is all about throw the condemnation away he chose you before the foundation of the world he has washed you in his own blood he has sealed you with his own life this is a day like no other day before there's no condemnation to the bride it doesn't mean that she won't fail it doesn't mean just like we watched with the wave sheep brother brennam's life he failed he he he had his wife lied to the lawyer he got a wrong spirit in the pulpit and said something harsh about a brother god corrected him right in the pool but he said i shouldn't have said that it's not that the outer man won't make a mistake but the life on the inside will take control hallelujah sometimes we won't even accept what the prophet says about the bride until we've come to a perfect life and never making a mistake and i tell you friends if you try to get to that place before you accept what's been told you will never get there and you will never be able to you'll never be able to circumvent condemnation in your life amen feeling like i never measure up and i'm never good enough because you're trying to attain amen to something in the flesh that's going to require the change in your flesh [Music] and we're going to try amen trying to be perfect and once somehow uh we don't say this out loud this is not in our main conscience but subconsciously we're saying when i can be perfect amen when there's no longer a fault in me amen then maybe i can say what the prophet said about me but i'm telling you if you believe you're the bride of jesus christ you can say what the prophet said about you this is the word of god this is the promise that's in the scripture amen there is now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus [Applause] no condemnation then why do i feel so condemned because you're letting the devil play in your mind amen you're letting him lie to you and you're not taking the word of god and driving back the enemy you know you did that yesterday you say the flesh that i live in did that yesterday because listen let's listen to what the prophet says let's just take what he says your marriage certificate hallelujah where your true listen oh my goodness i can't hardly read it the old book of your natural union but your new bride hallelujah your new life is in the lamb's book of life your marriage certificate hallelujah where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold what you were meant to be from the beginning the real you the genuine you the portion of god that god has portioned out of himself that he's going to call son or daughter that's the genuine you that's the portion that was put in the lamb's book of life that's the portion that was put in the marriage certificate that's the portion that's never sinned that's the portion that can't sin [Music] oh if we could just identify with that friends we'd have so much overcoming power in our lives if we could just take what the word says take what the prophet says and forget everything else that floods through our mind and just stand upon the word where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold now you're not only forgiven but you're justified glory justified romans 5 1 said romans 5 therefore being justified by faith look up the word the word don't mean forgiven the word means justified it don't mean you're forgiven for instance you heard i got drunk and done some evil thing and everything then you come around say to me you found out i didn't do them then you come around you say brother branham i forgive you forgive me i didn't do it at the first place i'll say it this way your outer man needs forgiven your inner man never sinned in the first place praise god he said forgive me i didn't do it in the first place see now if i did do it i'm guilty but you could forgive me and i wouldn't be guilty but yet i'm not justified because i actually done it but the word justified is though you never done it amen when did he justify you before the foundation of the world the same time you were glorified i love the word of god but the word justified as though you've never done it it's not even regarded at all how is it done in god's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book and marriage is divorced and dead it's not even in the memories of god amen you're justified therefore being justified it was accused you was accused you never done it in the first place you was accused of it you was accused of all kinds of things by the accuser of the brethren but in reality the germ of life that was to be you from the beginning never did it in the first place that's why you have to become a new creation that's why that germ of life under the baptism the holy ghost must spring to life and be a new creation because that new creation never did it in the first place not the old one made over not the old one amen patched up but a new life a new creation by the baptism of the holy ghost it never did it in the first place that seed comes to life now i'm going to go further in the invisible union he says the apostles them who set forth the bible here come luther out in reformation his words that his church won't his words his church won't work today wesley's won't pentecostals won't it worked in their day but it's another day this is the opening of the seven seals i know it sounds strange to you but god has vindicated it so perfectly there's no question in it just perfectly i ain't scattering that to the local assembly here i'm speaking to the people out across the nation see do what you wish to now notice the anointed word of this day of which you are apart by predestination you immediately like knew when you heard that you knew right quick that you was an eagle you also realized that you wasn't a denominational chicken to begin with you know there is something wrong there there is something wrong that's right for you know that you were trapped into it at the beginning he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of water of the word and the blood of life that's what the bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which foreign you has washed you by the washing of the water by the church no that don't sound right does it you might find that in the almanac but not in god's bible by the washing of the water by the word in the word see you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning let's turn to ephesians chapter 5 for just a minute i'm going to look at this in the scriptures ephesians chapter 5 and verse 25 ephesians 5 and 25 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word why what for that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish whose goal was it to have a perfect church the church or christ whose plan was it yours or his whose accomplishment is it yours or his is it your accomplishment or his accomplishment if we're still trying to make it spotless and blameless amen and wrinkle free on our accomplishment we will fail all the time but if we let it be his accomplishment his goal his victory she is his victory and the purpose of his death but if we let it be his victory and then he brings the word amen by the washing of the water by the word he brings the word amen to bring the blood life to wash to wash everything away to wash all of the filthiness away all of the denominationalism away all of the unbelief away why because he wants to present to himself a spotless bride wrinkle free and blameless before him in love i tell you friends we have to keep that revelation constantly before us amen so that we don't get tripped up and trapped up in the identifying with the wrong identity now let's keep reading here you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now as we go off the air just in a minute you are standing if you're standing on god's word and with god's word every amen every jot every tittle where are you standing i'm trying to tell you pull away from them shucks and get out here in the wheat where you can get right before the sun i hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place hallelujah you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and washed in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect no listen it's hard for us sometimes to say i am perfect it's hard for us to say i'm justified never did it in the first place i am perfect but listen to the criteria amen if you're born of the spirit of god amen you believe you're born of the spirit of god washed in the blood of jesus christ and believe every word of god amen can you say i believe the word of god i believe every word of god he showed me everything he's revealed i believe every word of god amen i have been washed by the blood of jesus christ and i've been baptized by his spirit if that's you you're perfect if that's you you're as though you never did it in the first place so it's hard for us to say i'm perfect amen there's no sin in me amen because we realize that in our flesh in our former life amen in our old union we had all kinds of unbelief we had all kinds of that stuff but he came to wash us from that and divorce us from that and put in the season's forgetfulness to bring out the true you the eternal germ that was from the inside to spring that to life so that so that you could be washed so you could be sanctified that you could be wrinkle free so you could be blameless before him in love now this is important because we have an accuser of the brethren and he's accusing them day and night amen he's the accuser of the brethren but that accuser of the brethren will be cast down but when will that accuser of the brother be cast down when the bride goes up when the bride goes up amen when when when you let this word carry you up when you let this word carry you up amen amen it stops the mouth of the accuser when you let the word by revelation lift you up to where you can see the plan of redemption with the ego's eyes you can begin to see i mean from before the beginning to the end and then you can realize i come from god i go to god amen god has washed me god has purified me god has quickened me to life amen then then he's put the old life in the sea of forgetfulness he separated me from my old husband i'm united now with christ washed and wrinkle free and blameless before him in love amen devil you can't accuse me anymore this is not a denominational age this is not a church age amen this is the bride age and i'm part of the bride and been baptized by the spirit of god believing the word of god for my day you have nothing to accuse me of because i believe and that life that's in me will lead me into all truth amen and if i act in a wrong way it's the thing that corrects me it's the thing that brings me back in line to the word it's the thing that snaps me back in place it's the control tower on the inside oh yeah you may may be able to tell me where i failed yesterday you may be able to tell me where i felt today but you can't call me an unbeliever amen you can't call me an unbeliever because i believe amen you can't tell me i don't believe this message because from the core of me i believe amen i believed the message before i understood it i believed it when i heard it amen something in me believed it something in me always believes it amen no matter how confused my mind gets no matter how troubled i get my spirit realm i'm still a believer on the inside and your devil can't call me an unbeliever amen you may be able to call me a bad believer call me a bad believer but i'm a believer you may say you're not a real good son that's okay i'm still a son [Music] the bride has to know her position and then she's changing positions from a church member she's changing positions from a denominational she's changing from a center to a saint she's changing amen but her understanding of who she is is changing and to her true identity her true eternal germ life from the beginning and that is the overcomer brother brenham said in the message recognizing your day and its message like israel back in her promised land she don't know how she got back there she was just automatically put back there why national forest put her in her place now i'm going to say something national forest put israel in her homeland national forest will put the church in the world council of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride listen what he says the power of god will put the people in the bride the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god so don't just think i just said that the spirit of god which is the word of god my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place amen what's putting the bride in her place the spirit of god what is it it's the revealed word of this hour is putting the bride in her place putting her in her position amen what is she amen she she she is bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life spirit of his spirit who can lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justified tell the accuser that he's coming down tell him that you found your position by the grace of god and by the word of this hour and as we find our position he loses his why do you think the devil fights you so hard why in your mind why with so much troubles why because he's losing his position friends and when he loses this position he'll never go back he's cast down amen from there he goes into a pit and chains amen for a thousand year reign amen then and then after that amen he's resurrected to bring back a final battle and he's completely completely completely completely annihilated he's holding on to the last threads of his position amen trying to keep the bride out of his her position but there's going to be an exchange of position and the exchange of position is already taking place the bride is going up word by word amen amen as this one catches it and this one catches it and this one catches it they're being lifted up out of the natural being lifted up out of the kernel and into the reality of who they really are and the accuser of the brethren is losing his right to accuse he's got maybe just a fingertip hold left on his position i'm telling you friends as we spread this word and find that last predestinated seed and they come to the realization of who they really are there is no accusation against the elect of god they've been washed by the water of the word amen they've been washed they've been sanctified they've been justified they've already been glorified and they're coming into the realization of it now so that they can't get pushed around by fear tossed around by all kinds of misconceptions you know one of the things that one of the things that the devil used to the denominational ages to try to trap the people in the denominations was fear fear of being wrong fear of not getting it right fear of well if you don't believe this way amen you won't be right and this church is right and you believe what just church believes amen that was a trap of the devil using fear so you could you needed you needed a church you needed a right teaching you needed a right minister in order to be right but in this last day he's taken that fear away he's brought a prophet in this day to tell you who you are and as an individual he reveals to you who you are you don't need a church to be right you don't need other people to be right you need a revelation of who you really are and god has brought a word amen to lift the bride out of spiritual amnesia to take all the deception away so she can see who she really is so the devil doesn't push her anymore by fear if you do that you're not a believer what do you mean if i do that i'm not a believer i'm a believer before i do that [Applause] come on devil i'm not falling for it i come from god i go back to god i'll never be lost amen and god is the one i love amen this word is the thing that i have a passion for amen and i will always submit myself to it he's used he's used fear fear of being wrong fear uh not uh being in deception fear but the bride can't be deceived the prophet said she can't be let the realization of who you really are transcend all fear don't let the devil motivate you and jump you through hoops and make you do all kinds of silly stuff and have all kinds of fear amen just just rest in the fact that he has called me how do you know because i believe it's not hard for me to believe i just believe i believe the word he's changed my life i mean i've received the baptism of holy ghost i believe the word i've been washed in the blood of jesus christ therefore according to the prophet of god and according to the word of god i am justified i am perfect amen i i never did it in the first place the spirit of god which is the word of god the word and spirit is life will put the bride in her place and as that word puts the bride in her place the devil loses his place he says we'll put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in christ we'll put her in her place no national force will do it but the national force did drive israel to the homeland the national force of the council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of god will raise the bride into glory out of it let the power of god let the spirit of god the word of god put you in your position and when you get in your position the devil's losing his don't think don't think he'll let it go without a fight but fight back with the word don't fight back with more reasoning don't fight back with more thinking don't fight back with more willful effort just fight back with the word let's read ephesians chapter one together ephesians 1 and 3. ephesians chapter 1 verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together and won all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will when i read through that scripture what i read is he did it he wanted it he did it for his purpose for his will and you're just the recipient of it you didn't have to earn it you didn't have to work for it he did it he did it of his own will he predestinated before you got to choose he did it for you he wanted it for you he wanted it for himself and we're the recipients of that and i say let the word of god put us in our position brother brown's going to go through some of these same scriptures here so you can keep your bible open and follow he's going to do it and christ is the mystery of god revealed and i want to see what he says here now we see his mystery he had in his mind before the foundation of the world now would you just like to read a little of this let's just read it have you got plenty of time now let's just all turn just for one reading anyway the book of ephesians chapter one amen in this threefold in this threefold manifestation of christ let's read paul an apostle jesus christ by the will of god now watch it's not addressed to the world but to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus how do you get into christ jesus by joining church by birth by one spirit first corinthians 12 we are all baptized into one body see all right that's the ones he's talking to that this ain't addressed to the outside world we can't talk to the center on this because he knows nothing about it paul didn't address this to no sinners he said this is that that group here that's in christ jesus grace unto you in peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings whereabouts in heavenly places in christ heavenly places oh how i wish i had time here i've got it marked right here in my bible about heavenly places what is heavenly places heavenly places just for a moment is the believer's position in christ are you in heavenly places i'm in heavenly places right now not just because i'm excited about the word i have a position in christ and that position is eternal that position is predestinated that position has been realized by the baptism of the holy ghost i have a position in christ and when i don't feel like i'm in heavenly places i'm in heavenly places in christ the believer's position in christ see where the believer stands in christ in heavenly places according as he has chosen us listen close chosen us in him before the foundation of the world when did he choose us before the foundation of the world when his great hidden mystery is great secret he chose us in christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him and what love having won predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will predestinated there's the mystery he before christ or anything else was ever on earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride knowing eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestined to stand there the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand see he chose listen he chose you amen don't make this bride don't make this church make this personal he chose you before the foundation world knowing that eve would fall knowing that she would fall he had to choose one that wouldn't fall and you're part of that choice you've had opportunity to fall how many has that opportunity to fall how many has had opportunity disbelief how many had opportunity to walk away from the message but why couldn't you why couldn't you and others left why couldn't you when doubts came into your mind why couldn't you when hurtful things took place all around you why couldn't you leave amen because he predestinated you not to fall he predestinated you not to walk away from the word he predestinated you to make this glory stand in this day it's not your merit it's not your effort it's not your intelligence it's not your holiness amen it's not your ability to keep the word it's his choice before he knew there would be a day when the word would be restored he knew this is the day for satan to lose his position so he had to predestinate a portion of himself to act out the part in this day and that portion is the portion that's in you amen that is that was predestined to be you and that portion is predestinated not to fall not to fail amen it doesn't matter how many people walk away it doesn't matter how many people say what this that and the other how many hurtful things take place to you i mean how many members of your family and members of the church how many pastors or preachers hurt you it doesn't matter you've been predestinated not to fall you've been predestinated not to disbelieve you've been predestinated not to walk away why are you still here some of you have had ample opportunities ample opportunities but he's he had to predestinate one that would not fall because satan has got to come down he's got to be cast out of heaven amen and he's there as long as there's unbelief he's an accuser of their brethren but god predestinated some that would believe and they're having a change of position she goes up he comes down i'm going to keep reading the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand now you see his secret this is the secret and the secret is you the secret is in you this great mystery that he had before the foundation of the world because he knew that eve would fall but he knew there would be one that was restored so he predestinated the restoring now you see a secret what too to restore fallen eve as she was a prefigure of the church and now notice as god opened up the sight of adam and took out eve by his own flesh and blood and divided his spirit from masking the feminist to finish and put it in feminist and put it in eve took the rib from under his side and made eve out of it so god did the same thing taking out of the side of christ the blood and the water and christ is the word and taking the word and making up his church eve see back to himself again what's he taking he's taking the word and he's putting eve back to himself again by what by the word christ is the word and taking the word and making up his church evec back to himself again redeemed by the blood that was come from his body you see it now god's great masterpiece now being unfolded that's been hid since the foundation of the world but prefigured it all the way down through in order for god to restore fallen eve eve fell what did he fall from she fell from disbelieving the word she fell from the word so what did she fall from she fell from the word so in order to make sure there was an eve restored first he had to restore the word because he couldn't receive restore eve until he restored the word because she fell from the word then the word went into obscurity amen and become lost because of because of nicolaitanism and because of man's ideas and because of all of man's concepts amen but now god in the end time had to bring back the word when he brings back the word now he can restore the woman amen because she's restored by the word and she's restored by believing by accepting what eve turned down what did eve turn down the word amen and he comes back who comes back the word and he comes back and we accept it amen we believe it and we say i want it and i don't want to leave it and i don't want any other means to bring about anything else i just want this word eve was deceived amen she was deceived but she left the word she was beguiled but she left an unbelief so god now has restored the word and after he restored the word see restoring the word didn't finish the work because his goal was to restore eve he always wanted a bride of his own choosing that was his work from the beginning that was his desire from the beginning he knew that he would fall because it played out a drama that would show all his attributes of savior amen and father and redeemer and healer amen so we could learn who god really is but his plan from the beginning was to have a bride that would be just like him that would believe his word so he knew from the foundation of the world that he was going to restore the word but when he restored the word he wasn't done yet because he had the lifted the word up so that he could draw the bride to the head and unite the head and the body together as one to restore fallen ever now we're being united to the word and what eve turned down he came back amen who's he the word jesus christ our husband our bridegroom and we accept it and when we keep preaching the word and drawing the seed she keeps getting lifted up and put back in position by the word no national force no other force no church pressure no denominational force we're put in position but the spirit of god which is the word of god will put her back in a position simply believing what he said about her puts her back in position simply just accepting what he said who he said who he said you really are what your true identity is the condition he's put you in by the washing of the water of the word what he's called you he's called you justified he's called you sinless he's called you virtuous he's called you flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones how do you get in position let the word put you in position you we're not climbing a ladder friends we're not climbing a ladder of works we're not climbing a ladder of degrees amen measured out degrees by somehow accomplishment to get there just let the word put you in position and the word says you are justified amen the word says you never did it in the first place the word says you are the sinless spotless virtuous bride of the lord jesus christ the word says you never did it in the first place just take him at his word let the word put you in position and the devil will lose his i want to end by reading colossians 1 26 we've read it several times even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now was made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory this is the mystery this is the mystery this is the finishing of the mystery this is the completion of the work this is him putting his bride in position the one he fell but this is the one that's designated not to fall this is the one that's predestinated not to fall and what's putting in her position the word not i tried and i'm trying and i just keep trying you're just going to get really tired but just by saying something in me says that's the truth i don't deserve it i haven't earned it i can't accomplish it my merit my merit won't get it there but i know that that's the truth amen and i know that prophet is vindicated and i know that that's the scripture and something in me says that's thus saith the lord and if he said that about me i'm going to say amen and let the word put me in position and the devil no matter what he accuses and no matter how much he's accusing he can't lay anything to the charge of god's life it is god that justified why did he justify me with faith by faith i believed it was wrecking unto me and puted unto me for righteousness abraham didn't always get it right but he believed right he believed god whatever god said he believed it amen and god had the ability to steer him god had the ability to put him in position god had ability to raise him up and i say god we may not always get it right but by your grace we believe right we can't help it we just believe your word we accept it for what you said and if you say that about me i'm not foolish enough to disagree with you amen but i'll say amen if you say i'm virtuous and sinless and spotless why i'll say amen i'm not going by what my eyes see i'm not going by what my mind understands my my reasoning my memory my consciousness but i'm basing it purely on faith in your word that you have the right to say whatever you want about me and if that's what you say i say amen and i say take that devil next time you come along and with your accusations i'll just point you back to the word being justified freely i've been justified why because he's given me the ability to believe the word he sealed me by his own life and his own spirit i believe the word of god i've been called by a prophet in this day perfect just as if i've never done it amen there's nothing on your record book it's been wiped off my marriage certificate was sealed before the foundation of the world and that marriage certificate has been opened to me so that i could read my name in the book and when i read that my name was on the marriage certificate i wasn't worried anymore i realized i'd already made it in the mind of god i'd already made it let's all stand there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus don't don't get out of position friends the only way for this bride to get out of position is to disbelieve the word you know it i've said it before but i just want to labor on it for just a minute because i know this is a temptation it's a trial maybe not for everybody but for some this is a hard trial but we have to believe the word this this bride has to believe all the word and if the devil can start to make you doubt what god says about you you're disbelieving the word if the devil can throw circumstances and and start to show you your failures in the flesh and your outer realm of faults and failures and genetic things that were left over from mom or dad and he begins to show you all of these things and it causes you to doubt your position in christ when he has already revealed to you who you are he has already told you through a prophet who you are and then you realize that is unbelief and so we've got to come to a place where it says even if i don't feel like it amen by the revelation he's given me of who i am i will say what the word says about me that i am justified amen i have been sanctified i have been washed by that water amen i've been cleansed by the blood i've been sealed by his own life amen and now there is no fault there's nothing nobody can lay any charge to god's leg i'm guiltless i'm justified not by my merit not by the actions but by my faith in the word i will believe what he said and i will no longer allow the accuser of the brethren the devil to get me to say something different than what the word says do you understand this is important this isn't just well this isn't just a pep talk friend this isn't just a rally to try to get you excited and do better or feel better about yourself this is a living reality that some people struggle with on a daily basis but we've got to be able to say i don't care how i feel i don't care how many doubts are in my mind there's something deeper than my mind that says it's true it's true it was always true it will always be true that i am because as long as the devil can get you to confess the wrong thing his position is clear but the word is putting you in your position let the word put you in your position not your own thoughts not the lies of the enemy but let the word put you in position and as you get in position the accuser of the brethren has nothing to accuse you of because you believe the word and when the bride goes up he comes down i say lord let me keep climbing higher in revelation let my revelation climb so high until this flesh can no longer keep up and my very atoms change amen we take a dimensional shift just keep climbing keep confessing keep believing don't let the devil lie anymore when you say but you know i tried and i failed and i tried just quit trying and start believing start confessing and let the word put you in position maybe the reason you're failing so much is because you're trying too much you say i tried and i failed and i tried for the channel i failed and i tried again and i failed well of course because you tried aren't i supposed to try oh there's nothing wrong with with with wanting to serve god and obey the word of god but once you start believing once you start confessing once you start saying what the word says and let the word put you in position and let the word wash you let the word sanctify you let the word convince you let the word amen be your whole life let the word put you in position not your trying if trying hard got things right then when you got tired of trying hard you're going to get it wrong so just believe say god if you said i'm perfect i'll say amen if and why because that's what he wanted he wanted a spotless bride wrinkle free and blameless before him in love he wanted to present that to himself see so many times the devil will trip us up with religion and will say things like i just want to serve god so bad i'm trying so hard somehow the devil has tricked you to get yourself in the middle somehow the devil has tricked you to think that somehow you can do something like or you like you even ought to be able to do something that's deception friends you're getting yourself in front of the word of god and you're putting your desire to want to serve god above his desire to want you to present you to himself so quit quit saying religious things like i just want so bad to serve god i just want no matter how bad you wanted it he had to want it worse and he had to want it first and if he didn't want it it doesn't matter how bad you want it this is religious talk just drop the religious talk and says there's not a thing in this world i can do if he doesn't do it for me i will fail utterly fail i will be absolutely ruined but i believe that he did it before i believe it was on the book and i believe that that word is true and that word's going to put me in position so i'm going to say what the word says praise god i could go on all night but you get the point say what the word says and let the devil lose his position let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus i thank you god for this word lord there's not a thing in this world we could do to save ourselves there's no way lord in this hybrid condition that come from a fall in the garden could we ever wrap this man into obedience to your word could we ever through willpower or sheer determination ever be good enough [Music] but god you didn't expect us to be able to in our own efforts that's why you sent your word in this day to tell us who we really are to take us back before our existence in the flesh to explain to us lord how we got this condition and why it will never work and why it must be changed lord you come to bring us so much understanding so that we wouldn't rely upon self but we would learn to rely upon your word god forgive us for our religious talk forgive us for our foolish foolish talking and thinking lord help us to lay all that aside now and help us to learn to stand only on your word if your word says i am free i'm free if your word says i'm healed i'm healed if your word says i'm your bride i'm your bride lord i pray god that that word would put your seed into position as you promised it would strip away the devil's lies lord he's an accuser but he's got nothing to accuse the bride of because she believes god i ask that you would just strip away all of self that we'd quit looking at self relying on self letting self trip us up and then we just surrender ourselves and die and let you live have your way in us lord we pray bless us as we go from here lord the roads may have snow or ice on them and i just pray that you would protect each one lord we've come here lord in obedience to your word we've come here to hear from you because we love you we're asking lord that you would protect us and watch over us on the way home that you would let us be bright in shining lights in this dark world god bless us now we pray in jesus christ's name amen the blessing says it's already done [Music] it's already done the battle is over the victory is already done it's already mine it's already [Music] the battle is over the victory is one it's already mine i'm already his yes i'm already here [Music] the victory is one i'm already his it's already done oh it's already done it's already the victory is one it's already done it's already mine yes it's already [Music] [Music] is over the victory is one it's already you know this message tonight may have been for one person in here maybe two three i don't know it doesn't matter [Music] but if you're that one person you know who you are and if that's you i say put this issue to rest tonight because it's keeping you from the greater works it's keeping you from fulfilling your purpose it's keeping you from the commission the very reason you were predestinated and it was not so that you could struggle all your life with whether and you're not whether you're good enough whether you're one of his or not amen but let him answer that question for you so that you can get on to the work amen so that you can be about the father's business amen and quit sitting here all the time wringing our hands wondering is it me could i be i'm not good enough i failed today but put this issue to bed and say god i'm not going to deal with this anymore i'm going to take you out your word so that i can do what you put me on this earth to do you didn't send me here to sit in the chair and wring my hands and wonder if i'd ever be good enough amen but there's a work for me to do there's a commission and a calling in my life amen and i want to put this issue to bed now so that i can do what you've called me to do [Music] take courage friends take courage if there's something stirring in your heart that says i know that's true take courage to let it come out of your mouth they say i am perfect by the grace of god amen by the blood of jesus christ i am perfect he sees me as perfect i've repented i've given him my life amen i'm his but he told me that i'm flesh of his flesh life of his life bone of his bone that he loves me that he's washed me by the word that he's not depending on me to make it but he said he would make it through me i say make this the night where you say i'm not going to let the devil whip me around anymore i'm going to believe what god has said i'm going to believe it and when the devil comes in again i'm going to i'm going to resist him in the name of jesus christ with the word and send him running because if i resist the devil he will flee [Music] the devil will lie to you listen i know i know without a shadow of a doubt this is for somebody because god won't let me stop the devil will lie to you and tell you that somehow it's pious to keep wondering keep searching keep asking yourself am i right am i not somehow that's pious that's religious that's showing a sincerity no it's not it's showing a lack of faith it's letting the devil steal and rob you from everything that god has given you take your joy take your peace take your ability to be a real threat to his kingdom amen but don't let him do that anymore it's not pious it's not religious it's not proof that you're a saint it doesn't show that you have a greater desire than somebody else to serve god because i want to i want to make sure i want to make sure just make sure this word is true and if you're sure this word is true say what the word says it's not a greater religious piety amen it's a handicap it's the devil holding you back if i were you i'd get upset [Music] about the devil trying to change my identity from what the prophet gave me by the devil trying to take me out of my position when the word has already put me in position i would resist that devil if i were you and if you resist the devil he will flee it's not a higher order of religious religion it's not a higher order of sincerity it's a lack of faith say god i'm not i'm not going to do this anymore i'm accepting what you said about me i'm believing what you revealed to me and i'm moving forward and i will not ask the same questions over and over again i'm going to take you at your word and i'm going to believe you [Music] now god use me usually praise god we're going to let you be dismissed but don't if this is for you don't leave here without in your heart saying god i hear confessing that i believe that word is true it's true about me i'm going to confess it man i want you to be praying for brother emmanuel too he's leaving to do some charity work in africa
