========================================

amen do you have that witness in your heart you're going all the way not because of anything we've done but what he's done and what he's doing he's given us witness he's testified he showed us and we know that by his grace we're going all the way god bless you it's certainly good to be with you this morning let's take our bibles while we're standing and let's turn to revelation chapter four i say i very much appreciated the special this morning that was that was a special special amen i love to see what god is doing when when the young people can get inspired about the word of god and things of god it's exciting to me you know they're just responding something within them is responding to an atmosphere and brother branham told us he says you can hatch a chicken egg under a pup it's the atmosphere and we believe that as as as adults as elders in the church if we can create an atmosphere of expectation of holiness an atmosphere of godliness then these then these little seeds of god can spring to life in this atmosphere and that's what the young people are responding to an atmosphere that's created by the holy ghost-filled believers and i say we got to come expecting there's still people being birthed into the kingdom we've got to come create an atmosphere come early be in prayer pull worship create an atmosphere because we're seeing the fruits of it and i like the fruits let's keep pressing on god bless you brother kyle it's good to see you here we didn't think you and your family are going to make it but this is a this is a treat he's been going a long time and so we're going to have brother kyle minister for us on wednesday so that'll be wonderful hopefully he can share a little bit about what he's been doing on the other side of the continent and we enjoy that lord bless you let's let's take a look at revelation chapter four in verse 2 and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one side on the throne and he that sat was to look upon like jasper and sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like an emerald and round about the throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god and before the throne there was a sea of glass like under crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle now if you notice that wasn't a perched eagle it was like a flying eagle because that's the differentiation between the eagle and the other three beasts is that it can fly and it's a flying eagle amen verse eight and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou hast created all things for thy pleasure they are and were created this is bower heads our heavenly father we thank you lord that we can come again to you lord lord jesus we thank you that you made your presence known among us by keeping your promise lord and god i pray now that as we take these pages of this physical book and open it and read it lord that you would do something supernatural that you would reveal to us your word lord and that you would show us lord yourself in the pages of your word and lord as we share what's on our heart i pray that you'd move the man to the side and that you would speak yourself lord through these lips and that we could receive from you and that that we have need of this morning we love you we give you preeminence in this place in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated praise the lord if we bring the powerpoint up we're going to continue on in the fourth seal and eventually we're just going to have to stop preaching the fourth seal because i came to a realization while i was studying i realized that the fourth seal was the message of the hour and so we could preach on that from now until we receive a body change and go meet him in the air because brother branham told us in the beginning he said now this is this is the most important message to us at this time because the four seal is the message it's the finishing up of everything it's the wrap up of the gentile dispensation the wrap of the church the rapture of the church and the explanation of all of that but i want to take a look at one thing that we have going on here and and i want to it'll be just a little bit of review but there's one certain angle that i want to focus on and pay attention to and i want to look at guarding the mercy seat because we find out that wherever god's throne was we see these four living creatures and brother brenham tells us very specifically that these four living creatures that we see depicted here as the lion the calf the man and the eagle he said these are always around the mercy seat amen and we see it in the wilderness journey we see it in ezekiel we see it all over in the bible but wherever we have the mercy seat or the throne of god because the throne of god is the mercy seat wherever we have that we have these four living creatures and they're to guard the mercy seat and we take this all the way back to genesis chapter 3 verse 24 it says so he drove out the man this is after man had fallen and disobeyed the commandments of god and he was driven out of the garden of eden and he drove out the man and placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims now see that's plural not a cherubim cherubims brother venom said these were the the four living creatures amen and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life now keep that in your mind that their job the job of these living creatures the job of these guards around the mercy seat are to keep the way of the tree of life amen sometimes they keep away from the tree of life and sometimes they drive you into the tree of life but their job is to keep or guard the word keep means to guard like a keep would be uh like a prison cell and a castle would be the keep or a place of safety that you run into in a time of uh war would be a keep it's a it's a guarded place and so they keep the way of the tree of life amen they don't keep you away from the tree of life necessary they keep the way of the tree of life so there's a path to the tree of life and these living creatures are the guard that keep that way amen they guard it they watch over and make sure that anybody coming the right way has free access to the tree of life but they're also there to make sure there's nothing to pollute the way amen that you can only come if you come the right way so we see that these living creatures are always around the throne of god the prophet says in the fifth seal now one of these creatures we find out in studying the revelation in the churches one of them was the lion and the other one was an ox and the other one was a man and the other one was an eagle we found out in the church ages that these four beasts meaning four powers was gathered around the acts of the apostles just the way the tabernacle in the wilderness so he's drawing a parallel between the tabernacle and the wilderness and then what takes place in the book of acts so i want to pay close attention to this and see all that we can glean out of this for us you know the everything that happened in the old testament was a shadow of things to come in in the the building of the tabernacle and the exodus journey and all of that was a shadow of other things and and paul the apostle tells us in the in hebrews that these these are for our examples all right so we want to pay close attention to these things he says you understand it so let's read this bold print again we find out the church ages that these four beasts meaning four powers was gathered around the acts of the apostles just the way the tabernacle in the wilderness you understand it because i won't take time to go in into it now we drawed it out here and showed it just exactly they were watching over this the lamb and the word to perform the word just as they did the ark of the covenant in the holy place in the wilderness so here they are guarding the ark of the covenant in the holy place and they're there to perform the word and to watch over the lamb same thing in our day there to perform the word and watch over the lamb so we know we've been through this this is review we know that in the wilderness when they set up camp around the tabernacle that moses was instructed to build and he fashioned it after pattern he's seen in heaven and when he set up the tribes he set up the tribes in a very specific order and he wanted this tribe camped here and this tribe camped here and when you look at the banners of the of the tribes that are placed around the this uh this tabernacle you find the banner of the lion the ox the man and the eagle all right you have judah and judah and reuben and ephraim and dan and you have that east to west to south to north and so we see the the the camp would be set up and the israelites would go in all directions around around this throne they were guarding or keeping the way of the tree of life because the shekinah glory of god which is life was going to come into this tabernacle and the approach was going to be by bringing blood through the right process through the right order and when an israelite would come the right way to approach unto god that blood was going to make its way to an altar amen and beyond that was going to be a shekinah glory and this was the only approach to the tree of life and third day this was the approach to the tree of life so he set them in camp around this showing these same four living creatures around the throne that's on earth so wherever you have wherever you have the mercy seat you have these four living creatures praise god brother graham said just exactly the tribes of israel camped around guarding their earthly guards of the right to the ark they're earthly guards of the right to the ark because there were certain people that had a right to approach unto god there was a certain nation and there's a certain way they had a right unto that ark they had a right unto the presence of god but there was only a certain people and only a certain way to take their rights and these guards were there guarding the right to the ark hallelujah don't you see it hear mercy mercy seat nothing could come anywhere around it without crossing those tribes crossing what the lion crossing the man the intelligence of man crossing the workhorse as an ox or crossing the eagle the swiftness of it the heaven the earth in between and all around you see there were guards and above it was the pillar of fire brother nothing touched that mercy seat without the approach and the only thing that could approach it was through the blood now these things are examples for us so in revelation chapter 4 god has a mercy seat today to be guarded you believe that where's the mercy seat found in the heart of man where did it come in the heart of man at the day of pentecost when the holy ghost which is god came into the heart of man amen when when god told him to set up this tabernacle when the shekinah glory the presence of god came upon the throne god was right there in his midst and that was the mercy seat of god upon the earth but there was a shift that took place in the mercy seat on the day of pentecost when now god could purge and cleanse a people and sanctify a people by his own blood so now he doesn't have to dwell in a tabernacle made with hands now he can come and dwell in the tabernacle of human flesh because his blood has paid the price to cleanse it to sanctify because nothing is clean without the sprinkling of blood every vessel everything in this tabernacle when before the glory of god would come in before the presence of god would come although it was done exactly what the way moses said it was built and fashioned the way he said all the implements were there but until they took the ashes of a red heifer and took the blood and until they went and sprinkled that blood and they sanctified that place then there was nothing the presence of god was not going to come in but now god was was he was he was killed without the camp and the red heifer was killed the red heifer that was the blood of sanctification to sanctify the dwelling place of god that died outside the camp not not on the holy mountain not in the camp but outside the camp and jesus died outside the camp amen and he became his blood became the waters of separation and the purification and now he can purify another dwelling place for the shekinah glory of god to come and jesus by his death amen by the purging of the blood of jesus christ he could cleanse another tabernacle so that the glory of god could come down into another dwelling place and that makes the mercy seat the heart of man when did he become the heart of man at pentecost amen he come into the human heart and so if there's always throne guards mercy seat guards there's there's always four creatures that have to guard the approach to the mercy seat they have to keep the way of the tree of life amen so now over the over the seven church ages god has had temple guards throne guards i mean he's had mercy seat guards they're watching over keeping the way to the tree of life and these were the four anointings of these four beasts in each in each of the church ages coming down through what were they doing they were keeping the way to the tree of life amen because you had to come the right way you had to come by the word they were keeping the way they were keeping the right to the ark because the elected of god had a right to the tree of life and these anointings were here making sure that they were guarding away or keeping away so that the elect could get to the tree of life amen how could you come to life in luther's day you had to come through luther's message amen because remember it was the word that bled for you it was the word i mean god god was made flesh amen and in the flesh the word was made flesh and that word had blood when it was made flesh and when that blood was shed the word was bleeding for you and now the path back is through the word and whenever god would send the word you had to walk in that path of the word and that would lead you back to the tree of life if you would reject this word amen you would be veered off from the tree of life but you had to come with the word for your day as it's restored that's the path and who's keeping that it's these anointings amen it's these throne guards that are anointing the people to keep the way of the tree of life amen it was a it was a lion anointing and an ox anointing and a man anointing what were they doing the anointing was going over the elective that day and the anointing was calling out a luther calling out a wesley anointing them to see the word for their day and what were they doing they were keeping the way to the tree of life keeping the way to the right of the ark brother ram said these four anointings keep the way of the book of acts and he calls it matthew mark luke and john and matthew mark luke and john are there guarding the book of acts this gets interesting for me this is wonderful because what are the book of acts what is the book of acts what are the garden guarding and why are the four gospels guarding the book of acts you know what about the rest of the bible i mean what about all the epistles of paul and what about the book of revelation and all that brother brennam's trying to show us something here this in the book of acts is where the mercy seat had moved into the heart of man and and now what was guarding that is the four gospels how were the four gospels guarding that the four gospels are talking about the ministry of jesus christ we receive that the life of jesus the works of jesus the death of jesus the resurrection of jesus it's all there in those four gospels and what are those four gospels doing they're guarding the book of acts because now when the dwelling place would move from one man jesus christ he was the mercy seat amen he was the tabernacle of god he was the place of the shekinah glory but it was going to move from the one man jesus christ into a many-membered body on the day of pentecost and what was the proof what was the evidence the vindication was the manifestation of the life and the 120 that poured out of the upper room speaking in tongues and and and deciphering the word and laying out prophecies what was that it was a proof that the same life that was in the man that was in matthew mark luke and john that same life is now in the people of the book of acts and the mercy seat has transferred hallelujah you cannot recognize the mercy seat unless you find where these throne guards are because they're the ones keeping the way to the tree of life you can't come through there's no way to get to the ark unless you pass through these anointings amen and we live in a day where you can't pass through just the lion anointing or just the ox anointing there's a path for you to walk and it's through the eagle anointing hallelujah so the battle plan what's been happening now is there's a fight breaking out and there's a war but this war very much is over the path to the tree of life the warfare is very much satan is trying to keep the people of god from the word of god trying to keep them from the manifestation of the life he doesn't want the people to manifest the word for their day he doesn't want the life of jesus christ to be on display so he's here doing everything he can to plug up to pervert to pollute the way of the tree of life that's why every time they'd bring true doctrine he'd come along with false doctrine what's he trying to do he's trying to corrupt the way to the tree of life because there's only one way and you've got to come through these anointings to walk that way and they're keeping it and it's a word way because you can only come by the blood amen in the blood amen is the word amen the shedding of the blood was the sacrifice of the word and now to be part of that blood atonement you have to be part of the word you can't walk any other way and these four anointings are keeping the way of the word laying down more word word for this day the approach the right to the ark the path to the tree of life so what are they trying to do they're trying to come in this antichrist spirit he's death his name is death he's been death since the beginning he's named at the end but it's been the same writer he's always been death what's he doing if he can keep you from the path the word path to the tree of life you're in death that's why he's death because anything that's not life is death and so he's trying there's a war here but god saw fit that he would have the throne the mercy seat guards they're always there in every age keeping the way to the tree of life keeping the way and only those who come the blood way can go to the tree of life that's why the the devil will always try to create substitutes for the way there's many ways many paths but there's that's not true there's only one so we want to focus on this fourth anointing brother branham tells a story in the fourth seal he starts talking about a meeting he had in chicago he said i said there in chicago the other day for more ministers than there are people sitting here and there they had me pinned off about the doctrine of serpent seed and all this other thing i said someday i said somebody get your bible and come here and stand by me then nobody said nothing now don't read any further i want to explain this story to you that brother branham is is going down in 1961 in the early part of 1961. i think it was april 1961. you can hear the message uh the explanation of the godhead and before he gets to the meeting a couple days before he gets to the meeting god shows him a vision and he tells him to go stand by this third door by the window there and he stands there and he begins to see and he says see they're not going to get the place they've rented god's going to move it to another place this place will be a room that's brown or whatever and he showed him everywhere they were sitting he says they've got a trap set for you amen they're going to disagree with you on your doctrine and brother branham says he tells this story several places but he said your doctrine of serpent seed and water baptism in jesus name in godhead and so now the the he said there was over 300 i believe is what he said there was or about 300 and it was the greater minister of the ministerial association of greater chicago so these are ministers from all kinds of denominations they're gathered together and they've agreed that they're going to challenge brother branham on his doctrine and god showed him a few days before amen this is good this is real good friends amen brother benham says in the third seal he tells it like this he says now i don't believe in fussing with people but when it comes to a spot where they try to drag you into it and i wouldn't have went but the holy spirit told me said go on over there i'll stand by you amen and so he he sat down with uh i think it was carl williams and tommy hicks and he began to explain to him you're not going to get that room and the man said we're going to get it we've already paid the down payment it's been reserved he said you're not going to get it that room looks like this you're going to have a room that looks like this and this brother will be sitting here and that brother will be sitting there and begins to describe it to him and sure enough on the day of the event they found out that it was double booked they couldn't have the place they had to scramble and find another place and and and they tell him brother bam is exactly like you said well he wasn't doubting it he wasn't surprised it was going to be exactly what he said amen he said they've got a trap set for you they're going to ask you to speak at the ministerial association of the greater chicago they've got a trap set for you on your teaching of my word amen then brother bam says later in the quote in the third seal he says well i thought i'd better not go over there then lord if they're going to do that i don't want to hurt their feelings or do anything wrong he said go i'll stand by you so brother venom knows in him as a human being he doesn't want to go down there and fuss he doesn't want to fight and if people are going to disagree with him he's fine just letting them disagree but god had another purpose here and the holy spirit said you go i'll stand by you you're not going alone amen you're going with an eagle anointing for this age you're not going by yourself but you're going for a very specific purpose to this meeting hallelujah in the in the fourth seal i'll just finish this quote and then we'll we'll move on it says there was about 50 or 75 said i'm coming down there to be re-baptized did they come not one of them why he give them space to repent he will cast their children to death spiritual death there is something very significant taking place at that meeting then brother branham could go and he could take and he begins to lay out his doctrine and he begins to talk about how he came to this understanding and begin to reveal the scriptures and talk about uh the understanding of god the one the godhead versus trinity and he lays it all out and then he says about 70 some of them decide they're going to come down and be baptized brother bram tells us many many times he says but here he is in the fourth seal and we realize when we get to the fourth seal we're at the wrap up of the church amen we're at the pending judgment we're at the time for the rapture of the church and brother branham's standing here and he's saying now see he give them space to repent brother branham is tying this right back to thyatira take your bibles and turn to revelation chapter 2 revelations chapter 2 verse 18 and unto the angel the church and thyatira right these things saith the son of god who hath his eyes like unto the flame of fire and his feet are like the fine brass and i know thy works and i charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last being more than the first notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou suffers that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed into idols and i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold i will cast her into a bed and they that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repented their deeds and i will kill her children with death so brother branham is now taking this statement he says he give them space to repent he will cast their children to death spiritual death he's taking this right out of the thyatira church age and what he's showing is the catholic church moved through these stages through the first four church ages but when they get to thyatira now jezebel is ruling amen now the catholic church is in full domination she's in full power amen she calls herself a prophetess but she's not amen in the in the people have committed fornication with her and she's going to be thrown into a bed and those that commit fornication with her into the into great tribulation amen he's showing the oncoming judgment and he says and i will kill her children which is the protestant churches that's the children there's the and the harlots and we find it over here in thyatira because now we see that this is the judgment of the amen and thyatira because she's come to full power after this the catholic church diminished in power and the protestant church began but the protestant church has followed the exact same pattern of the catholic church and now they get down here to this point and the fourth seal where brother branham is talking about being in chicago and being challenged on teaching of the godhead and water baptism in jesus name and serpent seed and now he lays it out and he and he lays out the doctrine and here he is the eagle anointing and a prophet and the eagle anointing is laying out what's he laying out the path to the tree of life what's he guarding he's guarding the path to the tree of life and he's laying out before the greater chicago ministerial association they re represent all the churches in chicago or the majority of the church in chicago they're represented here and and basically there's a cross section of the world represented right here in chicago or at least the united states then and he lays out this doctrine and then some of them testify that that's right i'm coming down they get to get prayed for even tommy hicks says i've never seen it like that i want 300 copies of that message to give to my my ministers and brother ben said did any of them come he said not one of them come he give her space to repent he will cast their children to death spiritual death because the protestants now have come the same way the catholics and now they've been given the same opportunity space to repent and they rejected it just like the catholic church and now he's going to kill the children with death just like the it's amazing how brother branham picks these words right out of thyatira because what is thyatire the fourth stage or the fourth age of the catholic church and now we're in the fourth seal amen now we're in the fourth stage now we're at the end of the protestant church and it looks exactly like the catholic church looked hallelujah now listen to this revelation chapter five brother ben says that morning same story he had told billy paul what lord showed him he said my son said to me hey daddy are you going over there in them fuss and i said i ain't going over the fuss i'm going over anointed with the holy spirit with the word of god that'll guard the mercy seed long as he's there brother man said i'm going anointed with the eagle anointing of the holy ghost i'm going over there amen as a representative of the throne guard with a word of god because the word is the sword amen with the word of god that will guard that mercy seat as long as he's there as long as he's where as long as he's on that mercy seat what mercy seat the one that began at pentecost as long as he's there there's a word that is going to guard that mercy seat and here we have the fourth beast anointing on a prophet amen and the prophet is always an eagle so we have an evil anointing on an eagle anointed of the holy ghost with the word of god that'll guard that mercy seat as long as he's there do you believe he's still on the mercy seat then that mercy seat is guarded what's it guarded with by the word of god under an eagle prophetic eye anointing amen that could stand there in front of 300 or so ministers that were disagreeing with him and he could take his bible and he could challenge them what was the sword that he used it was the word and he says i took my bible and i said if you can disagree me bring your bible and stand alongside me what's he defending it with with the sword of the spirit which is the word of god keeping what the way of the tree of life you can't come to the tree of life any other way when brother branham come down and he laid out serpent seed water baptism in jesus name the doctrine of the godhead when he laid that down when those 300 men when they refused to come down he says they've been given space to repent and he will kill their children with spiritual death he's making a declaration as in thyatira that if they do not come this path they are dead what was the path the path was the true word that had been restored in this day hallelujah which is why we don't play around with the word friends that's why when a eagle anointing on our eagle prophet when it restored to us the full word that full word is the path to the tree of life it is the way of the tree of life and that is the only way that you can come to the tree of life he says further down he says the holy spirit begin to take the word of god and reveal it and interpret it down like that when all those bunch of trinitarian ministers sitting there reaching under the table and shaking hands with one another and tears running down their cheeks and i understand that 72 of them is coming down here this tabernacle for me to baptize them in the name of jesus christ the mercy seat is guarded see the holy spirit guarding the mercy seat what was happening in chicago the holy spirit was guarding the mercy seat is there still a mercy seat if there's still a mercy seal on earth is there still a throne guard guarding the mercy seat hallelujah remember now we're in the fourth seal we're in the wrap-up of the church the easter seal in 1965 brother baby said we were for ordained of god for this hour are you for ordained of god for this hour not for a previous hour your four ordained of god for this hour the word of god manifests itself right through us and we live in the presence of god by the word promised of god ain't a devil in hell can keep me from raising ain't a door he could shut my face at that morning the seals has been broken hallelujah so now brother branham is going to attach he's attaching the resurrection to the opening of the seal amen and i don't just mean the resurrection that's coming when we have a change of the body he's attaching the resurrection to the opening of the seals listen when he says now i'm free i'm a i'm an eagle i'm no longer in a cage but i'm free i've raised from the dead unto the new life of jesus christ not only me but every man woman boy or girl sitting here that's been filled with the spirit of god is a new creature in christ you are a eagle amen so he starts to starts to say we're foreign of god for this hour what is this hour it's an eagle hour you're for ordained of god for this hour amen you the the that we have the presence of god nothing can shut my door on the resurrection to shut the door in my face no demon from hell can keep me from raising amen why because the seal's been broken and now i'm free i'm an eagle and i'm no longer in a cage what was in the cage false doctrine and false understanding and misunderstanding of god in his word that was a cage that caves the eagles but at the opening of the seven seals there is no more cage for the eagles you can come out of the cage and be free raised from the dead now right now raised from the dead into the new life of jesus christ hallelujah now we find out that they were the guards to the mercy seat they watched the mercy seat nothing came to it or crossed over the tribes first before it could get to the mercy seat every man willing to give his life every israelite and camp would die before anything can enter into that camp over there and take that mercy seat you see in the example that brother branham is giving us he's showing us that when when the the camp was set up in israel in the days of moses and and he put the tribes in order he said now it wasn't just the standard of the eagle of dan that kept away the enemies and kept the path clear for those who had a right to the ark but it was the individuals within that camp themselves it was the people in that tribe they were responsible in their position in their positional place they had to be in their place because you know not everybody can just decide to move about in the camp they can't just decide to camp anywhere they want and decide well i mean the sun's kind of hot here in the morning but there's a rock over here i want to camp and put my tent over here you can't do that because they were set in order for a purpose and the order they were set in was for the purpose of keeping the way to the mercy seat every way had to be blocked north south east and west it had to be set up and you had to be in your position so that you could keep the way so that you could guard the path to the mercy seat amen god put us in this age for a reason he didn't put all of his elect in luther's age he didn't put them all in wesley's age but he divided them out because there's a certain camp that we need to be in because there was already somebody that guarded the way from the east and already somebody that guarded the way from the west and the way from the south has already been guarded but today is the day of guarding the path from the north amen and we've been placed here in this age in every israelite every man was willing to give his life are you willing to give your life to keep the way of the tree of life because the only way that you could effectively keep this way is if you give up your life you have to come to absolute death to self you have to come to a full surrender and be born again by the life of jesus christ to even keep this way you have to be anointed by the eagle anointing positionally placed in your inheritance so that you can keep the way hallelujah every man was willing to give his life hallelujah revelation 3 20 behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me the only way in the last church age the only way that you can open the door and have jesus come in and sup with you is if you hear his voice no man ever shot god at any time when adam fell he didn't run to god amen adam went ran and hid he made himself a false religion of fig leaves hiding out from god amen we recognize now that it was god who came looking for man and it was god who came and knocked on your door with his voice and the only way that you can commune with god is not when you go hunting him up not when you imagine a fairy tale god and go seeking after him but the only way that you can ever commune with god is when you hear his voice knocking at your heart and then you through free will open the door and invite him in and then he's promised he would come in and sup with you so we live in the last age this is the laodicean church age when he says this he says behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice amen what is that voice it's the same voice that was speaking in the prophet brother branham it's the same voice it's the voice of god revelation 6 7 and when he opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see it didn't say he heard the fourth beast he heard the voice of the fourth beast amen because when brother branham was here he was an eagle and when he was here on earth it was the voice of the fourth beast speaking through the prophet messenger it was the voice of god it was the voice of the son of man amen speaking through a son of man it was the great prophet speaking through a prophet it was the great eagle speaking through an eagle but what we heard was the voice of the fourth beast we didn't hear the voice of william branham we heard the voice of the fourth beast and we heard the voice of him knocking at your door amen you can open the door praise god i like what comes next church age book laodicean church age a moment remember we're in the same church ages and behold i stand at the door and knock the same church age as the fourth seal the voice of the fourth beast we've got that now he's talking laodicean church agent of the church age book a momentary consideration of the church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day what was wesley the voice with the word in his day amen now remember luther and wesley are under the same anointing of man so the man anointing doesn't have to speak through one voice luther was the voice and wesley was the voice both of the man age anointing we got that it doesn't have to be bound all up in one man amen let's read that again but the the lutheran spoke for god at one time but they organized and again the pure word was lost skipping down they could no longer speak for god then god how come they can no longer speak for god because they didn't have his word when they had his revealed word they could speak for god but when they got off the word they couldn't speak for god so god raised up another one and gave her revelation then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles read and known of all men for their generation so the ones who took the word from wesley became the living word amen living epistles read and known of all men and now those who would take the voice was coming through wesley they would take the voice they themselves became a voice because they became a written epistle that everybody could read their lives what were they living they were living the word that came through the voice that came through wesley and now when they would live it everybody could read their lives and they were hearing the voice hallelujah became the living epistles reading known of all men for their generation when the method has failed god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in the last day there was again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it's its own mouthpiece why because they're speaking their own word if you don't speak the word of god you can't be the mouthpiece of god it's his own mouth be so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her is the mercy seat guarded today there a voice still knocking on the door today where is that voice that voice is in her is the voice knocking at the door of hearts it's the voice of the fourth beast amen it's it's the same voice as the voice of the eagle anointing in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from god as at pentecost now you got that friends once more the world will hear direct from god this is pretty important because this is guarding the mercy seat this voice in the bride she can only be the voice if she's speaking the pure word if she's not speaking the pure word she cannot be the voice of god she cannot be god's mouthpiece but if she'll say what the prophet says and say what the tapes say and then she'll stay true to the word then she is the voice of god in this age amen and she is keeping the way to the tree of life do you realize that if your voices are stopped today then there's nobody else going to find their way to the tree of life there's nobody else can find their way to the mercy seat because there's got to be a people amen of the eagle tribe of the tribe of dan that's in position in the last day that everyone would give their lives to keep the way of the tree of life pure the lord the apostle paul says in second corinthians 5 verse 17 therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god who has reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation now i want you to watch the pattern carefully first you have to be a new creature in christ step one you must become a new creature in christ and in all things are become new and all things are of god who is reconciled to us reconciled us to himself by jesus christ so the first step amen is you have to be reconciled back to god by jesus christ and when you're reconciled back to god then he gives you the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we our ambassadors for christ what does an ambassador do in another country an ambassador becomes the voice of his country an ambassador becomes the voice of his president he's following out the president's policy the pr the policy of the country and an ambassador in a foreign land becomes the representation of the other land he's from and he becomes a voice he can speak for the whole country and we are ambassadors we have been made why by being reconciled back to god through christ by becoming a new creature through the new birth we become ambassadors amen for christ as though god did beseech you by us so he now paul's breaking this down don't lose this because of the terminology he says now we've become christ god was in christ reconciling the world to himself so the world's been reconciled back we've been reconciled back and now we are the ambassadors now we're the ones given the ministry of reconciliation why because jesus christ is not here in his fleshly body amen he is here in bride form and now when we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us god is beseeching you by us we pray you in christ's dead be ye reconciled to god basically what he's saying is i'm imploring you i'm asking you in the place of christ if christ were here he would say what i'm saying if christ were here he would do what i'm doing but i'm an ambassador of christ i've been reconciled back i'm a new creature i'm from the other land and now i've been given i'm an ambassador and i've been given the ministry of reconciliation and now i implore you i pray you in the place of christ be reconciled back to god do you realize friends if if paul the apostle is not here going to the gentiles the gentiles never would have been reconciled back to god because he's the one called to do he's the voice for that age he's coming out under under an anointing of a lion anointing and he becomes the voice for that age and if he's not there as an ambassador of christ who's getting reconciled because jesus christ had already come and reconciled and left and given a ministry of reconciliation to the church and now the church in christ is praying or imploring or encouraging people to be reconciled to god now do you see your job now you in christ's dead are imploring people or praying people to be reconciled to god who is it giving an invitation in this day who is it who who knows the path the way to the tree of life who is it that is guarding and keeping the doctrine amen what is guarding the path brother branham demonstrated what it what a guarding the mercy seat was it was when he was standing there in chicago in front of 300 ministers that disagreed with his doctrine he was standing there guarding the mercy seat so that you and i could find our way to the tree of life amen if he hadn't guarded it where would we go which one of these 300 ministers were right man it's all an antichrist system to bring confusion and plug up and stop up the way to the tree of life to make it a maze of confusion so nobody would find their way to the tree of life but there is a man with a voice of the fourth beast standing there in front of 300 ministers keeping the way to the tree of life and not only that but by being reconciled back to the great eagle you've become eagles in the eagle age and the ministry of reconciliation has been given to you now the voice of the fourth beast is where the voice of the fourth beast is in her she is the mouthpiece of god she is the one knocking on the door she is the one imploring praying that you be reconciled back to god nobody else on earth has this ministry of reconciliation nobody else on earth is under the eagle anointing nobody nowhere else is the voice of god speaking but through the bride who's been reconciled back to god in every israelite every man would give his life to keep the way to the tree of life brother branham gave his life to keep the way to the tree of life the question is will you give your life to keep the way of the tree of life we saw what it looked like when a man would keep give his life in his positional placement to keep the path open to guard the path back to the tree of life we saw what it looked like we saw the suffering we saw the rejection we saw the heartache we saw the highs and we saw the lows and we saw a man completely surrendered to the holy spirit totally sold out to god with zero compromise in his life any time he made a mistake quickly come to repentance what was he doing he was keeping the way to the tree of life now the question is not what did he do because the mercy seat has to be guarded today there has to be a path kept open to the mercy seat today for your neighbor for your son for your daughter for your friend and there's got to be a way kept amen and there's got to be a people on earth that would sell out their lives to keep this way pure and what is keeping the way pure keeping the doctrine keeping the word pure keeping it without compromise keeping it out without man's ideas keeping the word is keeping the way keeping the word is guarding the mercy seat that's why the devil always comes in as a white horse to bring compromise because that's when he starts to pollute the way the question i ask is who can find their way to the mercy seat through the path that you live this is a question for all of us we take this home can somebody watch my life and find their way to the mercy seat can somebody hear the voice of my life thundering out or is my life just as confusing confusion as 300 ministers and their different ideas do i have my own idea on what the prophet said do i play around with his opinions and write stuff off and begin to accept my own way am i making the path obscure or am i keeping it clear because the prophet showed us how to keep the path amen and you know what the israelites they would they would sell out their lives amen to keep this bath clear they would die so that their children and their neighbors and their friends would have a path back to the tree of life are you willing to die so that your children and your neighbor and your friends have a path back to the tree of life are you willing to give up everything that you think is right and take god's way are you willing to take the prophet for what he is an example to the world amen brother branham said that a prophet becomes he literally becomes the word for his age he said his life his life becomes the word for this age god would take his prophets and do strange things with them because their life was an actual sign and an example to the people and he says their life became a prophet's life became the word to the age that's why you're on dangerous ground when you start talking about brother branham's opinion how do you know it's his opinion how do you know the lord didn't show him that how do you know it's not revealed to him amen his life becomes the word to the age so that you can watch his life and that becomes the word to the age do we understand what i'm saying we have an obligation in this age under the eagle anointing to keep that path to guard that path back to the tree of life oh it's easy to talk we can talk and talk and talk and talk but people don't care what you say they care about what you do the demonstration of your life is leaving a path for somebody to follow you can witness to somebody all you want but if your life is in chaos and your family is in a total wreck and everything in your life is upside down they're not going to pay a bit of attention to you amen if at work you live a different life than you live at home in a home you live a live different life than you live at church who in the world is going to follow the path that you're leaving it can't be a path laid down in hypocrisy it's got to be absolutely sold out where every man in this tribe of dan under the eagle anointing would give his life to keep that way to the mercy seat brother branham said in this message and then jesus came you know friends jesus never said go into all the world and build churches that they're all right never said go build schools they're all right but where we failed he said preach the gospel the gospel isn't building churches or schools through the though they're fine but the gospel come not in word only but through power and demonstration of the holy ghost you got that the gospel came he said preach the gospel but the gospel came by power and demonstration of the holy spirit and if you can't preach a gospel with power and demonstration of the holy of the holy spirit then you're not preaching the gospel this is what he said but through the power and demonstration of the holy spirit is the gospel it's a living gospel not enchanting words i'm going to take my code off for that one it's a living gospel friends living in your flesh not enchanting words amen people talk big all the time and they get in the right crowd and i just turned my microphone off they get in the right crowd and all of a sudden they're godly and they're living for god and they talk about scriptures and talk about how good the message is and you just put them into another crowd then all of a sudden you would never know they're a message believer you ever just talk about whatever's going on that crowd and drink a little bit and hang out in places they shouldn't hang out and talk about foolish things what's going on that's absolutely nothing but an antichrist spirit to plug up the way to the tree of life and god came with the power of the holy ghost to purge us from those things to bring us back and open up a way so that we can be a final voice to the final age that his voice will be in her and it will be the same voice that knocked on your heart is the same voice that'll be knocking on somebody else's heart hallelujah it's a living gospel not enchanting words but a living faith in the lord who is alive forever or ever more among us now if he's alive as the bible says he is and he made a promise that he was the same yesterday today and forever the things that he did we would do also hallelujah you believe that friends that's the true gospel brother paul the apostle says first the lessons first thessalonians 1 5 for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sakes now the question is is our gospel in word only but do we preach the same gospel paul preached brother branham could come and he could say i preached the same gospel paul preached because it had the same demonstration and power of the holy ghost it had the same power to absolutely renovate somebody's life it had the same power to take away addiction it had the same power to turn somebody's life upside down and change them from a sinner to a saint what was it the word that he preached the word that he preached carried with it life and when it was received and the baptism the holy ghost came it absolutely produced its own life and it came with power paul says in first corinthians two verse four and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god hallelujah i got invited by saint ritas to come to a opiate addiction program and they invited every pastor in the area it's going to be the end of october and i'm very likely to go and they want to talk about the opium and heroin addiction crisis and there's a medical doctor from the pain management clinic who's going to be speaking to all of these ministers and i'm reading this letter thinking what in the world can a pain doctor tell all of these preachers about how to help people with opiate and heroin addiction is this a holy ghost-filled doctor with an anointing that can lay hands on the sick and they recover is he going to tell him that there's a power in the word of god to deliver from opiate addiction is he going to tell him that there's a demonstration and power of the holy ghost that if you'll come the word way to the mercy seat and find mercy from god you can be completely renovated and change and your addiction can go away by the power of the holy ghost is that what that doctor is going to tell them preachers because the preacher should be teaching the doctor how to deal with opiate addiction not the doctor teaching the preachers and if i get a chance to tell them i'm going to let them know in a nice way why would a bunch of preachers go find out how to handle opiate addiction from a pain management doctor all he's going to do is prescribe something else more pills with more demon powers to offset another demon power and create more problems than he's going to fix the power is in the power of the holy ghost which is the true gospel and the true gospel has to have a power that backs it up or it's not the gospel it's got to be believed by faith brothers and sisters we don't talk about it we don't we don't just imitate it but we believe it and we hold fast to it and we expect it to bring results amen if you're struggling with compromise in your life it's the power of the holy ghost that'll burn that out not a 12-step system not getting better now you fixing yourself it is the power of the holy ghost that comes when you fully surrender to the full word of god and if you hear the prophet of god say you say i believe it i want to do it god you've got to help me because i'm without power he never said you had to have the power he said the power was in the holy ghost we've got to keep the path straight to the mercy seat we've got to preach the gospel the same way paul preached it the same way brother branham preached it without compromise without compromising our life without compromising with worldly ideas but keep it straight friends hallelujah brother branham said in christ is the mystery of god revealed now listen he's talking about christ the mystery of god revealed but he's going to spend most of his time talking about you because you are part of christ the mystery of god revealed christ is the mystery of god revealed his presence in the individual with a personal vindication of himself expressing himself the living word that's promised for the day so what's the living word that's promised for the day well the living word is promised for the day is revelation 10 7 and malachi 4. no he's after that now and he's preaching christ as the mystery of god revealed and he's preaching the one mystery of god that's in revelation 10 7 that will be finished and that mystery is christ the mystery of god revealed so let's get this again so we don't get lost he's not talking about malachi 4 5. he's not talking about revelation 10 7. amen he's talking about something beyond that he said his presence in the individual with a personal vindication of himself expressing himself the living word that's promised for the day expressing itself through you the living word that's promised for this day is not what was expressed through william branham but it's what's expressed through you expressing itself through a vindication of the great revelation of god what is the great revelation of god christ the mystery of god revealed what's the vindication of it his life living through you is a vindication of the great revelation in this day if what brother branham taught us is true then that life of jesus christ has got to be on display in the believers look only in an individual never a group an individual not in a group his identification is with an individual you get that not with the mess that is not what the baptist not with the presbyterian not the lutheran not the pentecostal but as an individual i'll take one and i'll leave one i'll separate them that's right there'll be two in the field i'll take one and leave one there'll be two in bed and i'll take one and leave one it's not a group it's a personal vindication of a pregnant child of god if you're pregnant it won't take very long for that to be vindicated you can't say i'm pregnant and six months later i'm pregnant and then eight months later i'm pregnant and there's no vindication of you being pregnant people would have a right to question your pregnancy but if you're truly pregnated it won't take long for people will begin to notice there's something different about you i can't put my finger on it but there's something a little different about you and you give it a little more time and all of a sudden they catch a revelation oh you're expecting because when you become pregnant it'll vindicate itself because when you become pregnant the natural types of spiritual when you become pregnant it actually changes your life it changes the way you look it changes the way you think it changes the way you feel it changes the way you eat when you become pregnant it changes your life you don't change your life the pregnancy changes your life can you imagine a poor woman trying to imitate that she's pregnant and having false cravings and and all of a sudden oh my back hurts and i can't sleep on my side she's not pregnant at all that's just a put on that's just a bunch of hypocrisy you don't have to put anything on when you're a child of god pregnant by the word of god when you do the pregnation takes over your life then everything that's supposed to come comes you don't have to say oh i should be growing a little larger don't worry you're going to get larger i i should i've heard about different cravings i i should don't worry it'll come people told me about pain in my back or not being able to take a full breath or not being able to lay on this side or that side or i can't lay on my stomach hey don't worry when you just keep living in the pregnancy and it'll all manifest itself you don't have to put anything on you don't have to make believe but there's a vindication of a pregnancy in this day that there is a bride who's been impregnated with the word of god and it's showing it better be showing if it's not showing you've got to go back and get pregnant and then you don't have to do anything just keep feeding the life is going to take over it's not a group it's a personal vindication of a pregnant child of god filled with the holy ghost so surrendered to god that you don't care about anything else and the holy spirit living its life pulsating through him showing the personal vindication of the word itself not you it not you proving it it's proving itself you don't have to prove anything all you have to do is surrender and it's not a life that you live of your own but it's a life that he comes and lives through you it's a life that he will live if you just surrender personal vindication of the word itself expressing itself to the people and to the world now listen friends it doesn't do any good if we just express christ to each other you know i love seeing the expression of christ in you it does mean a load of good but god doesn't want jews just express his life back and forth to each other when jesus christ came on the earth he came and demonstrated the life of god to the world man you've got to be a believer in the world not just when you're with believers you got to be a believer at work and you got to be a believer at school and you got to be a believer with friends and family you got to be a believer everywhere you're to express to the world the life of jesus christ not just to other believers man people try such foolish things and they'll do they'll act one way and behave one way and a bunch of people at church but when they get somewhere else they'll act somewhere totally different that's not pregnation friends that's hypocrisy but pregnation it doesn't matter where you go you're pregnant and it's showing it doesn't matter where you go or what you do you're not going to hide your life because you've been made pregnant by the life of jesus christ and you can't hide it wherever you go amen when you go here and you go there it doesn't matter it's showing praise god what are we talking about keeping the way to the tree of life remember the voice is in her and if we give an uncertain sound if our lives speak uncertainty to the word of god and compromise and laodicea how will people find the path to the tree of life if we're not guarding it we have to be guarding it continuing on in christ is the mystery of god revealed it goes right by them and they don't recognize it until it's gone it only picks up the predestinated seed that god predestinated before the foundation of the earth the same thing came through in the days of noah same thing came through in the days of moses days of elijah days of the prophets days of jesus on down through into this very hour the pregnant person with the seed of god the word in there manifesting itself so surrendered to the will of god that the word and the word alone manifests itself in this person the prisoner to an individual it's the word and the word alone manifesting itself in this person we can have a lot of different things manifesting itself in a person i can come to church and raise my hands and sing and i can manifest one thing but i can go to another venue with a different crowd of people and i can manifest something totally different that shows that there's no pregnation amen you got to become pregnant by the word of god by receiving your husband the manifest word of this age the message of the hour amen you receive that you die out to yourself you make a full surrender and that pregnation will come and then you don't have to worry about it you just keep feeding and keep surrendering and it'll take completely over your life and the message go away jesus the problem says and christian is a christian because christ lives in that person that's pretty easy definition what makes you a christian a christian is a christian because christ lives in that person how many christians we got here today amen not because not because you signed papers or because you came to church today but the only way you can be a christian is if christ lives in you christ means christ-like not a membership but a vindication get that not a membership not part of a club but a vindication it's got to be vindicated that means it's got to be proved it's got to be manifest it's got to be on display not a membership but a vindication god producing through you just what a christian is it's you getting out of the way and letting god come in you taking no thoughts let the mind that was in christ be in you there you are that's the real christian on my search the scripture he said they are they that testify of me now that's a big statement and we're going to labor on that for a minute jesus come and they asked him who are you and you're this and you're that he said search the scriptures they are they that testify of me can we say the same thing search the scriptures what does it say about women how should they dress how should they act towards their husbands how should men treat their wives amen how should we dedicate ourselves to the life of god what did paul say for men to do what did paul say for women to do how did paul say we should walk in this world hey search the scriptures they're the vindication of who i am amen you want to know who i am search the scriptures and find where my life doesn't match the gospel that was laid down by the apostle paul in jesus christ now we know that we're all still growing we all have these things that we're surrendering to the lord that's not what i'm talking about those things god is washing out all the time how many is growing in the lord constantly how many things is god washing out of you things that you can never get rid of on your own have been been disappearing from your life what is the washing of the water by the word amen things you can't do god just does you just keep surrendering you keep hating it you keep giving it to him and you keep feeding on the word and he's going to wash it away and wash it away and wash it away this is not about having a growing process we're all growing it's not about living absolutely perfect with no faults that's not what we're talking about but we're talking about a life that's not your life it's his life and it's a vindication of who you are your life is a vindication of who you are and you can say search the scriptures for they are they that testify of me friends it's not your confession jesus says out of the mouth the two are witnesses they may let everything be established right he says you can't just take my word for it jesus himself came to them and said you can't just take my word for it he said but my father also testifies even greater than that search the scriptures for they are they that testify of me i've got witnesses you've got witnesses one of the witnesses the scriptures themselves are testifying who you are either that or the scriptures themselves are exposing your condition but let the word either expose you or prove you amen not your own thinking and not what you feel about it and not the stroke of some kind mother or a gentle dad will say oh you'll be all right you come back to the word and if your life doesn't tote with the scriptures and you don't have a desire to match every word then you need something that'll burn your desire out and give you a desire that matches this word to where you actually want what the word says even if you're struggling with something and trying to get over it but all you want is this word to be manifest hey that's a good sign that's coming friends you keep laying there and you keep washing out by the word and god will take it away search the scriptures they are they that testify of me praise god message things that are to be now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband amen therefore we must be that word bride and what is the word bride oh what a question what is the word i heard where bride and word what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour friends the manifestation of this hour brother banners in 65 he's come past i mean he has actually stepped past revelations 10 7. he has actually stepped past malachi 4. he has come because he says it's those seven thunders that'll literally turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers and he's already preached the seven thunders so he's actually come past this and he's saying the manifestation of the hour he does not point to revelation 10 7 he does not point to malachi 4 he says the what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour search the scriptures they testify of who i am there will be a bride on this earth that'll be the manifestation amen of the bride of jesus christ the true church living the full word of god hallelujah the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god friends it's got to be living brother man said we don't come together to talk about the message we we don't come together to talk about the token we come together to apply the token the bride not a creator or denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living is there any question what the manifestation for today is supposed to be it's displaying to the other believers displaying to your church friends displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour now that we're now living friends the manifestation for this hour is a word bride but not so the word bride can keep looking at herself in the mirror i'm a word bride supposed to be manifesting to the world the very living word the attributes of god on display in the formation of the bride in the many membered bride that is the form of what the body of jesus christ supposed to be living the literal life of jesus christ on this earth not a substitute life not a half-life not a pretend life but the life the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living praise god one more slide question and answer 64. after the bride is raptured will any of the foolish virgin be saved or will they be lost no see everything will be finished for the gentile church when the bride is taken from the earth the spirit of god leaves the earth he that's filthy is filthy still he that's righteous is righteous still he that's holy is holy still where is the spirit of god when the bride leaves the spirit leaves where is the voice the voice is in her when the bride leaves as far as the gentiles go the voice leaves how many will give their lives to keep the way of the tree of life to keep it for an associate work to see to keep it for a lost family member to see to keep it for your own children to see to keep it for your own spouse your own friends how many is willing to be in position amen and stand there with the sword of the word of god and willing to give your whole life to stay in your position to keep the way of the tree of life that's the greatest privilege i've ever had in my life now when we realize what our purpose is on this earth we're actually here amen we're actually here stopping the devil from stopping up this path to the tree of life from making it confusing we make it simple by what by absolutely living the word you make it simple to see where the word is and it's a privilege to give my life to keep this path and i'm here with the word to cut out anything that would be confusing anything that would pollute the way somebody would throw sticks and boulders in the way i'm here with the word to keep the antichrist spirit from coming in and plugging up the way to the tree of life but i'm also here fanning the elect of god go go this is the way this is the way if you go this way you'll find eternal life you'll find what you've been looking for deliverance for your addictions amen overcoming power healing for your body amen oneness with god it's all right here the path is open come i'm showing you the way i'm a signpost i'm guiding you along and there'll be many believers that guide you all the way to the tree of life it's the greatest privilege in this hour friends is to keep the way to the tree of life there's nobody gonna find it without you god has done a wonderful thing in our day and god is doing a wonderful thing in our day we have to stop looking back at what's been done and start looking at what he's doing and who he's going to do it with and who he's going to do it through we're not waiting for the prophet to come back and do some wonderful things if there's any wonderful things going to happen it's going to be right here you and i we're the vessels yielded to him we're the tools in his hand where the stones in his slang we're the only thing he's got on this earth is the bride of jesus christ we're the only thing that he's got to work with and we've got to keep it pure keep it clean amen keep the path be path open you know every time god's had a voice he's had to vindicate that voice is that right he's had to show the world this is my voice and if they heard the voice they were saved if they rejected the voice they were lost noah had was the voice in his day how was noah vindicated but like ginormous structure behind him by doing what god told him to do by building what god told him the building keeping it word for word he was displaying to the whole world the vindication that he was the voice moses was the voice and god gave him signs amen elijah was the voice in his day god vindicated it when jesus christ came he was the voice on earth in his day and god vindicated it we believe that you know jesus prayed for multitudes of people that never believed he was the messiah it would be funny it'd be it'd be odd sometimes to have that number to count how many people did jesus pray for and how many were healed that never received him as the messiah ended up rejecting him and being lost i would say the number would probably be staggering but the point of the manifestation was not to convert them the point of their healing the point of the water and the wine the point of none of that was was was to convert them it was all to draw attention to the vessel that god was using so that the elect would listen to the word and be changed by the word not by the miracle but by the word paul the apostle came absolutely same thing god vindicated everywhere he went in every city he would come to god would vindicate that this is my voice and that vindication wasn't to convert people right it was never to convert them it was always to draw attention to the voice so that the elect could hear the voice see that god backed it up listen to the voice and find the path to eternal life when brother branham came he had healing campaigns like has never been recorded in the history of the world and thousands and thousands and tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of people were healed and never believed he was a prophet never accepted him as malachi 4 revelation 10 7. but the point was not to convert them to believe the point was to draw attention to the voice if we're the voice if we're the final voice in the final age then what has god got to do he's got to vindicate the vessel he's using as his voice he's got to show that this is my voice how's he going to do it look at this giant arc behind me look at my life look at search the scriptures don't they tell you of who i am listen to the testimonies come and experience for yourself come and taste and see that the lord is good hey friends you shouldn't be afraid amen and you shouldn't be afraid to lay your hands on somebody and pray for them because you're a son of god if they have faith in what you're telling them but you know brother branham was told if you can get the people to believe you he was not told if you can get the people to believe the message he wasn't told he said if you can get the people to believe you then nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer friends what will happen if you can get the people to believe you that you're the bride of jesus christ you're a redeemed son or daughter of god with the rights to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover hey hey their faith and that scripture can heal them they don't have to believe in malachi 4. they don't have to really believe in revelation 10 7 their faith in that word that if they those that believe if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover i'm expecting god to fully vindicate his voice in this day i'm taking god at his word and i'm watching the pattern and god has always vindicated that voice and i'm expecting him to vindicate that voice in our day i'm not afraid to pray for anybody that will believe me and what i say about who i am and what the word says about me i'm not afraid to lay hands and pray for any of them if they can believe what i'm telling them they'll be healed will they all be converted some might some won't but it doesn't matter because god is proving his word once again friends [Music] you know the vindication is to the world when god heals us that's the children's portion that's just the children's bread that's what we expect when god heals us it's not as though you know when dave wood comes to the prayer line and also he's got a mass amen and then he goes they go back for the surgery and there's no mass anymore it's not like dave all the sudden says oh now i know god's real he already knew god was real not now i know i'm a son of god he already knew he was the son of god or i know he loves me he already knew he loved him he was expecting for god to keep his word healing is no vindication to the bride that's the children's portion it's not as though god heals your body oh now i know he's god now i know he's my father and i know he loves me you should have known that before he healed you that's just the children's bread i said the other night at youth meeting my children when i when my wife goes and buys groceries and i give her money and she brings them home we have a meal and then they don't all of a sudden sit down and eat the meal go now i know daddy loves me and i know that i'm his and i know he cares about me they should have already known that before they ate the meal that's just their portion that's their right because they belong to me that's my duty to take care of them that's all healing is for us it's not a vindication to us but it is a vindication to the world and i fully expect with all of my heart that god if we can have faith like this that god will prove his word once again and god will vindicate the vessel if you can get people to believe you nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer that's the pattern friends and this word is to be vindicated to the world do you believe it are we ready to give our lives for it you're the ones in the tribe of dan on the sides of the north in the final church age just beyond laodicea you're the one keeping the way to the tree of life cutting out anything that's not godly keeping it open and waving in those that are coming the right way the blood way the elect of god fanning them in i can't think of anything else i'd rather be doing in this life than that that's your eternal purpose on this planet no matter what your position is in the church or what your job or occupation man or woman boy or girl that's your position in the tribe of dan under the banner of eagle standing there keeping the way to the tree of life and i say god thank you for putting me here in this day and i fully expect that you'll do everything that you said you would do and i believe it lord let's all stand musicians if you could come please amen that's bower heads if you're here this morning and during the preaching you realize i love the lord with all of my heart and i want that vindication of a life from the scriptures but i have not completely sold out i'm still playing with things that get my affection i'm still toying with things that i like and i'm still living with one foot in one foot out i'm here to tell you do not have to live that way you may have tried in the past and failed you may have wanted to do right and fail but what you need is a death what you need is a full surrender and a death and you need to be burnt out by the baptism of the holy ghost and you need to be made a new creature and i'd invite you in your seat right now if that's your condition just slip your hand up to god and say god you know my heart and i've failed but i don't want to fail again i don't have the power but you've promised that there'll be a power that'll come to make me a new creature in christ jesus and i invite you just to sell everything out and quit playing and quit holding on this world is soon going to burn and everything is going to burn in it everything that catches your attention everything that divides your affection it's all going to die it's all going to burn it's all going to become rubbish but there's only one thing that matters and that's that life that we live for jesus christ lord i pray that you see the hands lord and that you would burn out burn out those old natures lord destroy the old man and bring a new creature lord lord we ask for your blessing lord to be upon this congregation lord as we heard your word lord it's our heart what was priests is exactly what we want lord oh we just ask that you come with a greater manifestation lord anywhere we're wrong correct us lord we give you that right we give you that privilege because we want nothing more than to be your mouthpiece on this earth lord we want to keep the way to the tree of life we want to guard that mercy seat with all of our lives lord i just pray that you'd come and sweep through this congregation lord and you would bring us to a higher level of faith than we've ever known before lord an act of faith activated by your holy ghost living in the realms of your word lord help us climb higher than we've ever been in jesus christ's name take our lives lord let our lives be testified to by your scriptures that the world will have to take notice that the world will have to know that there's something different here than in any other church in the world there's something different in those people than any other people i've ever met that they'll have to take notice so the elect can see and hear we love you lord we thank you for the privilege of being here in this day we thank you for the privilege of being put in our position and i pray to strengthen us to keep it keep revealing your word to us keep washing us by the water of your word we love you god we give you first place preeminence in our lives and ask that you would mold us into the very image of jesus christ we're asking in jesus christ's name amen friends i just want to remind you of what the prophet said when he went down to chicago to the ministerial association in front of 300 ministers laid out the word to the scriptures he was giving them space to repent he had demonstrated time and time again the manifestation of god in his life he had been thoroughly vindicated before their eyes they knew that there was something different in this man than any other man they knew that god was with him they knew that there was a power working in his life that nobody else had they knew it friends there was no question in their minds they had seen it demonstrated they knew it they just disagreed with his doctrine here he stands explaining to them the word which is the path to the mercy seat here he is a man anointed by the holy ghost with the word keeping the way guarding the mercy seat and they're given an opportunity to come to the mercy seat in 70 some say we're going to come down and be baptized in jesus christ's name and not one of them shows up and in the fourth seal he says they've been given space to repent and he'll kill her children with spiritual death see god is fair god is just god he never brings man to judgment without first warning him brother random crossed across the globe giving a warning of judgment demonstrating the life of god demonstrating the word sharing the truth [Music] but friends this day is no different god doesn't call me into judgment without first giving him warning your life has to be a testimony of the same thing his life was a testimony we're coming now we're 52 years after the death of our prophet 52 years beyond that and we're getting ready to step into a worldwide tribulation but god is just and god is fair and i fully expect that this bride be put on manifestation and vindicated in the world given space to repent because she's slipping into the worst time that this world has ever seen the worst judgments being poured out upon the planet that this world has ever sent that that has ever been upon the face of the planet will be in that tribulation period but there's a final voice to the final age and i thoroughly expect god to vindicate that voice and give a last time of repentance before they slip off in the tribulation who's willing to surrender your life to be part of that who's willing to lay down hobbies to be part of that not all hobbies are wrong but if they get in the way lay them down how many is willing to lay down their own personal likes to be part of that your own ideas to be part of that how many is willing to take what the prophet says in the demonstration of his life and make it your own to be part of that how many is willing to sell out their lives to keep the way to the tree of life oh let's just worship him saints i'm so happy to be standing in a group of people that i know that i know without a doubt have sold out their lives and will continue to sell out their lives and when a greater price is required they'll give a greater price i'm so glad to be standing in the middle of a group of people that have already proved it and will prove it again and keep proving it so that there's some way for the last elect to find their way to the mercy seat because when the last one comes in we go and i want to be part of that you have a song brother that's wonderful let's sing that [Music] we are the generation we are the cold nation the
