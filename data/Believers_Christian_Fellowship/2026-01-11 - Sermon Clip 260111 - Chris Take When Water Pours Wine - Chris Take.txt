TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Prepare for rain. Prepare your family for rain. Prepare your marriage for rain because God is coming by your way. &gt;&gt; You say, "All I have is rain. It's just water. I just got water and I got lots of water. When I drink water, you know, just it's just water. There's no there's no stimulation." You see, you don't get stimulation by water. &gt;&gt; You get stimulation by wine. &gt;&gt; New wine. wine types, a revelation of Jesus Christ, a revelation of the word. That's what stimulates you. That's what makes you grow. That itself has a life of its own. Water does not have a life of its own. But the wine has the life of its own. But you need to fill your pots and you need to fill your pots with water. He said, "Brother Chris, I have." Okay. Now, the master's coming your way. Amen. &gt;&gt; The master wants to come to the marriage because saints of God, it is the invisible union of the bride of Jesus Christ. You wonder where your stimulation is. You wonder why there's no stimulation. YOU GOT A POT OF WATER and the GO THE THE BRIDEGROOM OF THE FEAST HAS NOT YET ENJOYED the new wine, the best for last. &gt;&gt; You have a potential for a marriage, but no marriage. &gt;&gt; You know that there's a marriage. You know that there's a third pole. You know that there's an opening of the word, but it's just water in your pot, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you want to know what is it? You know that brother over there, he talks about the third pole, but his life is no good. There's no fruits of the word in his life. So what's true? Is the third pull true or is it not? I have heard this stuff. You know, I I've talked to people said, I've heard this. I know exactly what you're talking about. BUT THEIR LIFE HOLDS NOTHING. &gt;&gt; There's no victory in their life because it's JUST WATER. BUT YOU NEED JESUS CHRIST TO COME QUICKEN THAT WATER to turn that water into wine. And you have to be willing to BE A VESSEL POURED OUT. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE to be willing to say, "LORD, POUR ME OUT." &gt;&gt; IT'S OKAY, LORD. I SURRENDER. POUR me out. And if there's nothing left when you're done, that's okay. Though he SLAY ME, YET WILL I trust him. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT ALMIGHTY GOD IS IN COMPLETE and total control of YOUR LIFE. YOU HAVE TO TRUST HIM. YOU HAVE to surrender to him. You have to know that the giants of Anoch do not DRAW THEIR SWORDS WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION. &gt;&gt; And you have to know everything that has happened in your life sitting here today HAS BEEN ORDAINED OF JESUS CHRIST. IT HAS BEEN ORDAINED FOR THE BRIDEGROOM because he WANTS TO TURN YOUR WATER INTO WINE. HE WANTS TO MAKE YOU LIVE AND BREATHE THE WORD OF GOD ITSELF &gt;&gt; more than you want it. &gt;&gt; Then you wonder what's wrong. You need the quickening. You need God to come by your way. You need him to come. You need the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Amen.
