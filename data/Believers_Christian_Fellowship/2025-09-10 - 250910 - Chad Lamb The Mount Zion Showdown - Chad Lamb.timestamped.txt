[0:00] I stand amazed in the presence
[0:05] of Jesus the Nazer.
[0:11] And I wonder how could he love me, a
[0:17] sinner, condemned unclean.
[0:21] But how
[0:23] marvelous, how wonderful, and my song
[0:29] shall ever be.
[0:32] How marvelous, how wonderful is my
[0:39] Savior's love for me.
[0:43] For me it was in the garden.
[0:48] He prayed not my will but thine.
[0:53] He had no tears for his own reap but
[0:59] sweat drops of blood for mine.
[1:03] Oh how marvelous, how wonderful and my
[1:10] song shall ever be. How marvelous, how
[1:18] wonderful is my Savior's love for me.
[1:25] In pity, the angels beheld
[1:29] him and came from the world of light
[1:34] to comfort him in the sorrow
[1:39] he bore for my soul that night.
[1:44] Oh, how marvelous, how wonderful, and my
[1:51] song shall ever be. How marvelous, how
[1:58] wonderful is my Savior's love for me.
[2:05] He took my sins and my sorrows
[2:10] and made them his very own.
[2:14] He bore the burden to Calary.
[2:19] He suffered and died alone.
[2:23] Oh, how marvelous, how wonderful, and my
[2:30] soul shall ever be. How marvelous, how
[2:37] wonderful is my Savior's love for me.
[2:44] When with the ransom in glory,
[2:48] his face at last I see
[2:53] will be my joy through the ages
[2:58] to sing of his love for me.
[3:02] Oh, how
[3:05] how wonderful
[3:08] my song shall ever be. How marvelous,
[3:15] how wonderful is my Savior's love for
[3:21] me. Oh, how marvelous, how marvelous,
[3:26] how wonderful, and my song shall ever
[3:31] be. How marvelous, how wonderful is my
[3:38] Savior's love for me.
[3:43] They that wait upon the Lord
[3:48] shall renew
[3:51] their strength.
[3:53] They will mount up with wings as an
[3:59] eagle.
[4:02] They will run and not be weery. They
[4:07] will walk and not faint.
[4:11] Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord
[4:15] to wait.
[4:19] Oh teach me Lord
[4:22] to wait.
[4:24] Down on my knees
[4:28] till your own good time. You'll answer
[4:35] my please. Teach me not to rely
[4:41] on what others do, but to wait in prayer
[4:48] for an answer from you. Oh, they that
[4:54] wait upon the Lord shall renew
[4:59] their strength.
[5:01] They will mount up with wings as an
[5:06] eagle.
[5:10] They will run and not be weery. They
[5:14] will walk and not faint. Oh, teach me
[5:19] Lord. Teach me Lord
[5:23] to wait.
[5:27] Teach me Lord
[5:29] to wait.
[5:31] While hearts are a flame, help me humble
[5:38] my pride
[5:40] and call on your name. Keep my faith
[5:46] renewed
[5:48] in my eyes on thee.
[5:52] Help me be on this earth what you want
[5:57] me to be. And they that wait
[6:02] [Music]
[6:04] shall renew
[6:06] their strength. They will mount up with
[6:11] wings as an eagle.
[6:17] They will run and not be weery. They
[6:21] will walk and not faint. Oh, teach me
[6:26] Lord. Teach me Lord
[6:29] to wait.
[6:32] Teach me Lord.
[6:34] Teach me Lord
[6:37] to wait.
[6:40] Oh Lord, I want to love you more
[6:47] than I ever have before.
[6:53] For you're so easy to adore.
[7:00] Lord, I want to love you more.
[7:04] I want to praise you. Lord, I want to
[7:08] praise you more
[7:10] [Music]
[7:12] than I ever have before.
[7:18] Oh, you're so worthy to be praised.
[7:24] Lord, I want to praise you more.
[7:30] Oh Lord, I want to give you more
[7:34] [Music]
[7:37] than I ever have before.
[7:41] [Music]
[7:42] You're the one I'm living for.
[7:48] Lord, I want to give you. Oh, let's
[7:51] stand together as we sing this. And
[7:54] Lord, I want to praise you more
[8:00] than I ever have before.
[8:06] For you're so worthy to be praised.
[8:11] [Music]
[8:12] Lord, I want to praise you. I want to
[8:16] give you more.
[8:18] And Lord, I want to give you more
[8:22] [Music]
[8:24] than I ever have before.
[8:30] You're the one I'm living for.
[8:36] Lord, I want to give you more.
[8:41] Amen. As brother Chad comes, Lord,
[8:44] prepare
[8:45] me.
[8:48] to be a sanuary.
[8:54] Oh, pure and holy,
[9:01] tried and true.
[9:06] And with thanksgiving
[9:12] I'll be a living
[9:18] sanuary
[9:21] [Music]
[9:24] for
[9:26] you. Oh once more.
[9:29] Oh Lord, prepare
[9:33] me
[9:35] to be a sanuary,
[9:38] [Applause]
[9:39] [Music]
[9:41] pure and holy,
[9:44] [Music]
[9:47] tried and true.
[9:53] And with thanksgiving
[9:58] I'll be a living
[10:05] sanuary
[10:10] for you.
[10:15] Amen. God bless you. It's certainly good
[10:17] to be here with you tonight. Amen.
[10:20] Before we go to prayer, I just want to
[10:21] give you an update on um brother
[10:23] Emanuel. I just spoke with him this
[10:25] morning. Uh he met with the surgeon and
[10:27] they've scheduled his surgery for
[10:29] Thursday for tomorrow. So we want to
[10:31] remember him in prayer. He said the
[10:33] surgery is Thursday tomorrow and they
[10:35] expect a six-w week recovery. And so we
[10:38] just want to pray that God will
[10:40] undertake for our brother and deliver
[10:42] him from this. And so let's just bow our
[10:44] heads together and pray.
[10:47] Dear heavenly father, we thank you Lord
[10:49] Jesus for the privilege of being here
[10:51] and God for us it's may it never become
[10:54] a tradition Lord God in the human side
[10:58] we get into routines we get into
[11:00] patterns Lord we're routine creatures
[11:02] but when we come here Lord may we come
[11:04] here deliberately intentional with
[11:06] gratitude in our hearts and may we
[11:08] remind ourselves of how privileged we
[11:10] are to be here Lord what a special time
[11:13] what a special place to be able to
[11:14] gather with your children to hear your
[11:16] word preached and God may may you come
[11:19] on the scene Lord as you promised to do
[11:22] through the preaching of the word
[11:23] wherever two or three are gathered would
[11:25] you be in our midst Lord and would you
[11:27] break the bread of life for us tonight
[11:30] God I pray that as we're gathered Lord
[11:32] we want to lift to you our brother
[11:34] Emanuel Sabasu Lord he's in such a
[11:37] difficult situation with his back and
[11:40] with a degenerative disc Lord that's
[11:42] herniated and a pinched nerve and severe
[11:45] pain
[11:46] and and Lord, the doctors only know to
[11:48] operate, Lord, and they're going forward
[11:49] the best they know how. But God, we're
[11:52] praying that you would intervene for our
[11:54] brother, that you would deliver him,
[11:55] Lord. God, we know your prophet told us
[11:58] that you have many ways of healing,
[11:59] through surgery, through medicine,
[12:00] through music, Lord, through the power
[12:02] of you coming on the scene and
[12:04] supernaturally delivering. Lord, we're
[12:06] not dictating to you how you deliver our
[12:08] brother, but we are asking that by your
[12:10] stripes, Brother Emanuel was already
[12:12] healed. And we pray that it would come
[12:13] into manifestation for our brother,
[12:15] Lord, that you would deliver him, Lord.
[12:17] That you would, Lord, we know that he
[12:19] could he could wake up in the morning
[12:21] and not need the surgery, Lord. We would
[12:23] rejoice in that. But if you choose to
[12:25] move forward and use the hands of a
[12:27] doctor, I pray you would anoint those
[12:28] hands. Lord, may it be supernatural what
[12:31] takes place in the operating room. And
[12:33] Lord, however, but I pray for a complete
[12:35] total victory and deliverance for our
[12:37] brother. May he be freed from this
[12:39] problem in his back. And may this be a
[12:41] permanent solution, a permanent healing
[12:44] for our brother. I pray that you would
[12:46] diminish his pain, Lord. That you would
[12:48] help the recovery process that would go
[12:49] much faster than expected. And may you
[12:52] just supernaturally show yourself from
[12:54] beginning to end on behalf of our
[12:56] brother. May the testimony come back of
[12:58] wonderful things that you have done.
[13:00] pray you be with sister Mimi and the
[13:02] rest of the family and Lord may you just
[13:05] undertake for them all and God for us
[13:07] tonight that are here Lord to hear from
[13:09] you God what we need more than anything
[13:12] in this life is revelation on your word
[13:15] your prophet told us that Lord and
[13:17] you've provided the Isab in this hour
[13:19] Lord the message of the hour the
[13:21] revealing of the word and God may you
[13:23] come and apply that in our eyes and open
[13:25] our eyes open the eyes of our
[13:27] understanding that we might have the
[13:29] spirit of revelation and understanding
[13:31] to see what it is you're trying to show
[13:34] us, Lord. What you want us to see in
[13:35] this hour. And Lord, I pray you'd take
[13:38] these lips of mine under your control
[13:39] and speak your words. Stop me from
[13:42] saying the wrong thing. Help me, Lord,
[13:44] to release myself to your spirit that
[13:46] you might use me to speak the right
[13:48] things, Lord. For we surrender to your
[13:50] way. And we come to worship you. And we
[13:52] want you to have preeminence among us.
[13:55] Bless us now, we pray, God, as we look
[13:57] into your word. in Jesus Christ's name
[13:59] we pray. Amen.
[14:02] God bless you. We're going to let you
[14:03] have your seats for just a minute.
[14:05] Amen.
[14:07] I just wanted to u uh remind you, thank
[14:10] you, musicians. God bless you. Uh just
[14:13] wanted to remind you that we are two
[14:16] weeks from tomorrow from retreat. I
[14:19] don't know if that shocks you, but it
[14:20] shocks me. Brother Jonathan Bumgardner
[14:22] said it to me out in the forer and I'm
[14:24] thinking, "Oh, we're three or four weeks
[14:25] away." He says, "No, we're two weeks
[14:26] from tomorrow, 15 days." I said, "Oh,
[14:29] God." Praise God. Amen. I'm looking
[14:31] forward to it. I'm excited. There was an
[14:33] information packet that went out today.
[14:35] So, we just want to remind you that 2
[14:37] weeks from tomorrow, uh we'll meet over
[14:39] there. 5:00 p.m. is when we are allowed
[14:42] to get in uh to the the accommodations
[14:45] and the orientation service will start
[14:46] at 7 over there. Want to remind you also
[14:48] that there won't be any ser uh any
[14:50] supper served over there. So, please eat
[14:53] before you get there. Also, there's new
[14:55] information and the registration
[14:57] information, a new map and all the menus
[14:59] and everything that you need. Also, we
[15:01] already sent it out today, but there
[15:03] needs to be a correction because there
[15:04] was a uh there was a conflict between
[15:07] some of the breakout sessions. So, that
[15:08] will change. We're going to flop the two
[15:10] for Friday and Saturday meetings will
[15:12] reverse. But when you get the update,
[15:13] you'll see that. Also, there's some
[15:15] signup sheets out in the foyer on the
[15:17] welcome desk for those who want to
[15:18] participate in some of the activities.
[15:20] uh just uh ask that you be signed up by
[15:23] the 13th. So we are very much looking
[15:26] forward to that. Again, we will have
[15:27] brother Daniel White with us. His wife
[15:29] will be here and also his mother's
[15:31] coming along with him. So it'll be nice
[15:33] to meet her as well. So we're looking
[15:35] forward to having a good time together.
[15:38] Also appreciate brother Denny Delmundo
[15:40] for being here on Sunday. Had a good
[15:42] service. I got to listen to it. It was
[15:44] it was nice. I'm glad I wasn't here
[15:46] while he said all those things. It was
[15:47] much easier to listen while driving, but
[15:49] we appreciate brother Danny and we're so
[15:51] thankful that he could relax and the
[15:53] atmosphere was good and we could tell
[15:55] that he was relaxed. So, we appreciate
[15:56] all of you pulling on the gift and we
[15:58] had a wonderful time up in Connecticut
[16:00] to see Brother Wesley and Sister Anne
[16:03] Godfrey. They're now both official have
[16:05] the same last name. They had a really
[16:07] nice wedding. I got a couple pictures if
[16:09] we bring them up on the overhead. I just
[16:11] wanted to share a couple pictures with
[16:12] you. They had a really nice wedding and
[16:15] here's the happy couple. We'll see him
[16:16] here in a little over a week and then
[16:19] we'll have the reception here on the
[16:21] 20th for them. So, we're looking forward
[16:23] to that. So, uh yeah, like I said, it
[16:26] was a privilege to be there and and uh
[16:28] we couldn't fly back in time for the
[16:30] services and Sunday wasn't going to
[16:32] work, so my wife and I decided to stay
[16:34] over and visit Brother Craig Brewer's
[16:36] church. And so, Brother Craig and Sister
[16:37] Anna were there. So, we got to talk to
[16:39] them and we were really excited to to
[16:42] see them and connect again after so many
[16:44] years. Uh, and so we had a wonderful
[16:46] fellowship. But then I asked brother
[16:47] Craig, I said, 'Are you preaching in the
[16:48] morning? Because I was excited to sit
[16:50] and hear him preach again. He said, 'N
[16:51] no, brother Roshan Massie is preaching.
[16:54] And I one of my one of my good friends,
[16:56] brother Rashan. So that was an extra
[16:58] treat. So here's a picture of the three
[17:00] of us and the four of the church
[17:01] afterwards. So I was a total surprise.
[17:04] And brother Rashan had let me know he's
[17:05] in the States and wanted to come by. But
[17:07] the only time he could come by here was
[17:09] the time my family and I were on
[17:11] vacation. And I told him, "We're just
[17:12] going to have to miss you this year."
[17:14] But God was good to us. Amen. And he
[17:17] preached a wonderful message. Amen. It
[17:19] was quite a blessing. And so, we had a
[17:21] really good time with them. And Brother
[17:23] Craig and Sister Anna send their
[17:24] greetings to everyone. They wanted us to
[17:26] tell everybody hello and they love you
[17:27] and think of you all. And so, we had a
[17:29] we had a great time. Amen. So, thank you
[17:32] for praying for us. Amen. Let's all
[17:34] stand together.
[17:36] We got to see Josiah and Samuel and
[17:38] Aaliyah, and they're all growing up.
[17:40] Brother Josiah was the song leader. I
[17:42] thought, "There's no way. You're just a
[17:44] little bitty boy, but he's taller than
[17:46] his dad now. He's 17 years old. He's
[17:48] helping there." And guess what? Samuel's
[17:51] taller than his mom now. He's shooting
[17:54] up like a like a weed and he believes
[17:56] he's going to overtake his brother. So,
[17:58] uh, it was good to see them. And what
[18:01] was really nice too is they usually have
[18:02] two services on Sunday, but they
[18:06] cancelled the second service because the
[18:07] brother Rashan was there and they had a
[18:09] fellowship dinner and their fellowship
[18:10] hall and so we got to stay and visit
[18:12] with everybody and get to meet their
[18:14] congregation. So that was really a
[18:16] wonderful time. So we felt like God
[18:18] really blessed us with that. That was
[18:20] good. Amen. Let's get into our subject
[18:23] for tonight, the Mount Zion showdown.
[18:26] Amen. And if you'll turn with your
[18:27] Bibles to Psalms 125.
[18:30] Let's turn to Psalms 125. And just want
[18:32] to say God bless you to the Quinlands.
[18:34] It's good to have brother Michael and
[18:35] Sister Marian here again with us. We
[18:38] appreciate seeing you again. Amen. It's
[18:41] always a privilege.
[18:43] Let's look at Psalms 125.
[18:46] We're going to read verse one and verse
[18:48] two.
[18:51] They that trust in the Lord shall be as
[18:53] mount Zion,
[18:55] which cannot be removed, but abideth
[18:58] forever. I love that. Not because we're
[19:01] strong, not because we're powerful, not
[19:03] but because we trust in the Lord. And
[19:06] the Lord won't fail.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; They that trust in the Lord shall be as
[19:10] Mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but
[19:12] abideth forever. As the mountains are
[19:14] round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is
[19:16] round about his people from henceforth,
[19:19] even forever. Amen. God bless you as you
[19:21] take your seats.
[19:25] Amen. God is certainly good. Uh as you
[19:29] can tell from the title, we're
[19:30] continuing on from this message from
[19:32] Pick Up Your Pen and Write. Uh the the
[19:35] booklet that we passed out. We're going
[19:37] to take a couple excerpts from that, but
[19:38] I have them on the overhead. And so I I
[19:41] I've been enjoying this study. I've been
[19:43] enjoying looking into this message and
[19:45] it's hard to get away from it. There's
[19:47] so much there. There's so much that God
[19:49] was trying to get through to the church
[19:51] that he wanted us to understand in this
[19:54] transition time that the prophet found
[19:56] himself in coming out of the church ages
[19:58] between the former reign and the latter
[20:01] reign and all of these things now that
[20:02] we understand better than we did before.
[20:04] And we see this transition, this message
[20:06] that God was trying to get over to the
[20:08] church. And so, it's been fun to look at
[20:10] it. But in here he mentions the Mount
[20:12] Zion showdown. But before that I want to
[20:15] just in review read this little portion
[20:16] here. Says now I want you to be very
[20:19] careful here and see this. God has
[20:22] promised that at the end time Malachi 4
[20:24] is going to be fulfilled. It has to be
[20:27] for it is a spiritquickened word of God
[20:29] spoken by the prophet Malachi. Jesus
[20:32] referred to it. It is just before Christ
[20:34] comes the second time. By the time Jesus
[20:37] comes all scripture must be fulfilled.
[20:38] The gentile dispensation will be in its
[20:40] last church age. When that messenger of
[20:42] Mal Malachi comes, he will be right with
[20:45] the word. He will take the whole Bible
[20:47] from Genesis to Revelation. He will
[20:50] start at the serpent seat and carry on
[20:52] to the messenger and the latter reign.
[20:54] Amen. So, we had so much fun with this
[20:56] statement last Wednesday when we talked
[20:58] about the former and latter rain and
[21:00] realized that that the latter rain was a
[21:03] revival. And during the first revival,
[21:04] he was sewing the seeds, amen, of all
[21:07] the truths that was lost through the
[21:08] church ages. But but there was going to
[21:10] come another rain, another revival that
[21:12] was going to be the harvest rain. Amen.
[21:14] And brother Brandham told us that we're
[21:16] waiting what we're waiting for is the
[21:18] latter rain. And he says, "We've sewed."
[21:20] Amen. There's been enough moisture to
[21:21] get it to come, but we swed the seed.
[21:23] Watch what comes. He said, "There's been
[21:24] denominational seed sown and Pentecostal
[21:27] seed swing." He said, "But the word's
[21:28] been sown." He said, "And watch what
[21:30] comes forth now. And now there's going
[21:32] to come a latter rain. And he called it
[21:34] the harvest rain. And it's the final
[21:36] rain, the final revival, the final uh
[21:39] spiritual falling. Amen. That's going to
[21:41] bring the the the final bit to bring
[21:44] that plant, the final harvest maturity.
[21:47] And it's going to be the initiation of
[21:48] the harvest cycle or the harvest season
[21:51] or the harvest time. Brother Bam uses
[21:53] all these terms but but there's a place
[21:55] in the message where he called the
[21:57] harvest the harvest rain rapturing
[22:00] faith.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; So the latter rain is the harvest rain
[22:04] and the harvest rain is rapturing faith
[22:06] and rapturing faith amen comes amen at
[22:09] the opening of the seals at the
[22:11] revelation of the seven thunders.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; So we know that he swed hey listen he he
[22:16] took the Bible he he he took the whole
[22:18] Bible from Genesis to Revelations. Amen.
[22:21] Yeah.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; And he started at the serpent seed and
[22:24] carried on to the messenger in the
[22:25] latter rain. Did he? Amen. Because he
[22:28] preached the seven seals, the
[22:29] revelations. Amen. The seven thunders,
[22:31] which are the revelations contained in
[22:32] the seven seals, which brings rapturing
[22:35] faith, which brings the harvest rain,
[22:37] which brings the latter rain.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we just just wanted to bring
[22:41] us up to speed from what we talked about
[22:43] last time. Now, let's get into the Mount
[22:46] Zion showdown.
[22:48] back in spoken word is the original
[22:50] seed. He says, "See now why I have been
[22:52] so zealous of the kind of seed that I
[22:54] planted for the body." The rain is going
[22:56] to fall pretty soon now. I mean, the
[22:58] real rain. And that rain, he means
[23:00] revival. And it's got to have seed to
[23:02] follow. And I hope I live to see it. Do
[23:04] you understand now? It will be the
[23:06] living word as it was at the beginning.
[23:08] The spoken word of God have his power
[23:11] for it is in him, in his own body,
[23:14] working his own way. look to the
[23:16] promises that God gave his body. Now,
[23:19] we're coming to something. We're coming
[23:21] to Mount Zion. Now, so as he talking
[23:24] about this is this is in spoken word as
[23:26] the original seed. He's talking about
[23:28] this coming to the body. And I just want
[23:30] to highlight a couple things for you if
[23:31] I can. He says it'll be the living word
[23:35] as it was in the beginning, the spoken
[23:37] word of God. Remember his title is the
[23:39] spoken word is the original seed. And
[23:41] he's saying if you go back to the
[23:42] original seed, it'll bring forth the
[23:44] right product. Amen.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; But he says now the spoken word as it
[23:48] was at the beginning, the spoken word of
[23:50] God have his power for it is in him in
[23:53] his own body.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; So now he's going to what? Now what he's
[23:58] going to start talking about. Amen. This
[24:00] living word that's coming forth has to
[24:02] do with his body. Amen. So he's going to
[24:04] be talking about his body in the end
[24:06] time.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; Working his own way. Look to the
[24:09] promises that God gave his body. God
[24:12] gave promises to his body. Amen. What
[24:14] body is he talking about? He's talking
[24:17] about the body of believers, the bride.
[24:19] Amen. His body on earth, the church.
[24:22] Now, we're coming to something. We're
[24:23] coming to Mount Zion. So, it has to do
[24:25] with all of this.
[24:27] Back in the Peramian church age, he said
[24:29] he has to be for that is history
[24:32] repeating itself from the time of Ahab.
[24:34] Israel's history under Ahab is happening
[24:36] right here in America where the prophet
[24:38] of Malachi appears. As Israel left Egypt
[24:41] to worship in freedom, pushed out the
[24:42] natives or raised up a nation with great
[24:44] leaders like David, etc., then put an
[24:47] Ahab on the throne with a Jezebel behind
[24:49] him to direct him. So have we done the
[24:51] very same in America. Our forefathers
[24:54] left for this land to worship and live
[24:56] in freedom. They pushed back the natives
[24:58] and took over the land. Mighty men like
[25:01] Washington and Lincoln were raised up.
[25:02] But after a while, other men of such
[25:04] poor caliber succeeded these worthy men
[25:07] that soon Ahab was set in the
[25:09] presidential chair with a Jezebel behind
[25:11] him to direct him. It is at such a time
[25:14] as this that the messenger of Malachi
[25:16] must come. Then in the latter rain will
[25:19] come a Mount Carmel showdown. Watch this
[25:22] carefully now to see it in the word.
[25:24] John was the forerunner of Malachi 3. He
[25:26] planted the former rain and was rejected
[25:29] by the organizations of his day. Jesus
[25:31] came and had a mount transfiguration
[25:33] showdown. The second forerunner of
[25:36] Christ will sew for the latter reign.
[25:38] Jesus will be the showdown between the
[25:40] denominations and creeds. So we want to
[25:42] look at this showdown. What is the
[25:44] showdown? It's between Jesus and the
[25:47] denominations and creeds.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So brother Brandham's going to
[25:51] start telling us about this Jesus that's
[25:54] that that is the the the showdown
[25:56] between the denominations and creeds. He
[25:58] says, "For he will come. He will come to
[26:02] back up his word and to take his bride
[26:05] in the rapture.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. This gets exciting for
[26:10] me. And as it builds, it just keeps
[26:12] building. So, he said the first showdown
[26:14] was Mount Carmel. The second was Mount
[26:17] Transfiguration and the third will be
[26:19] Mount Zion. So, Brother Benham is
[26:21] showing us in time there's been there's
[26:23] three great showdowns. Mount Carmel,
[26:25] Mount Transfiguration, and Mount Zion.
[26:28] And in order to understand Mount Zion, I
[26:29] want to look at these other two and see
[26:31] if there's a comparable uh uh uh thing
[26:33] that be be compared between all of them.
[26:36] But I want to show that it this is going
[26:38] to be between Jesus. I'm just going to
[26:41] Can I just give you uh jump to the chase
[26:43] cliff notes,
[26:45] &gt;&gt; give you the answer to the test? Amen.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; It'll be between Jesus,
[26:51] the manifested
[26:55] &gt;&gt; word,
[26:57] &gt;&gt; for
[26:59] &gt;&gt; the hour.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Brother's going to go clearly through
[27:03] this and begin to show us, amen, who
[27:06] Jesus is. Because Jesus was the word
[27:09] made flesh. He was the fullness of the
[27:10] word manifest for that hour. But at the
[27:13] end time, the showdown is going to once
[27:14] again be become between Jesus and the
[27:17] denomination and creeds. And in his day,
[27:19] it was between him and and the Pharisees
[27:22] and the Sadducees and the religious
[27:23] system of the day who had taken the word
[27:25] and done what they want with it. But he
[27:27] was the word now standing in flesh, the
[27:30] fullness of Godhead bodily. And now the
[27:32] showdown of Mount Transfiguration was
[27:35] it's all in him.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Nowhere else. Amen.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now there's going to be a
[27:40] showdown again in the end time of Jesus
[27:43] and the denominations and creeds.
[27:46] Amen.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; Let's keep walking. The last day
[27:50] messenger will appear in God's appointed
[27:51] time. It is the end time now as all know
[27:54] for Israel's in the homeland. Any time
[27:56] now he will come. Oh my goodness. We're
[28:00] reading this. Brother Brandham is
[28:01] standing there reading this. We read
[28:02] this any time now. For us it's not any
[28:05] time now. This has already happened.
[28:07] Amen.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; We're beyond this. Amen. Anytime now he
[28:10] will come. According to Malachi, when we
[28:12] see him, he will be he will be dedicated
[28:14] to the word. He was. He will be
[28:15] indicated pointed out in the word.
[28:17] Revelation 10:7. He was. And God will
[28:19] vindicate his ministry. He did.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; He will preach the truth as did Elijah
[28:24] and be ready for the Mount Zion
[28:26] showdown.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; He was
[28:29] in future home. Brother Beam says makes
[28:32] this statement. He he's reading here out
[28:35] of Isaiah. Uh chapter 4:4 says, "It
[28:38] shall come to pass that he that is left
[28:40] in Zion, and he that is a remnant in
[28:42] Jerusalem, in Jerusalem shall be called
[28:45] holy, even everyone that is written
[28:46] among the living in Jerusalem." See,
[28:48] wherein the Lord shall have washed away
[28:50] the filth of the daughter of Zion.
[28:51] Remember that's always the bride.
[28:53] Brother Brandham is typing Zion with the
[28:55] bride. And shall have purified the blood
[28:57] of Jerusalem. That's the remnant of the
[28:59] Jews plus the bride. And in the midst
[29:01] thereof with the spirit of judgment,
[29:03] fire. So he's teaching us a principle
[29:05] here that in the Bible Zion and prophecy
[29:08] is a type of the bride and he's typing
[29:11] Jerusalem with the remnant of the Jews.
[29:14] Now let's go back to Joel 2 because this
[29:16] is quoted on the uh uh on the day of
[29:18] Pentecost in the book of Acts. Acts
[29:20] chapter 2 says, "And it shall come to
[29:22] pass afterward that I will pour out my
[29:24] spirit upon all flesh and your sons and
[29:26] your daughters shall prophesy. Your old
[29:28] men shall dream dreams. Your young men
[29:30] shall see visions and also upon the
[29:32] servants and upon the handmmaids. In
[29:34] those days will I pour out my spirit.
[29:37] And I will show wonders in the heavens
[29:39] and in the earth, blood and fire and
[29:41] pillars of smoke. The sun shall be
[29:43] turned into darkness and the moon into
[29:44] blood before the great and terrible day
[29:46] of the Lord of the Lord come. And it
[29:48] shall come to pass that whosoever shall
[29:50] call on the name of the Lord shall be
[29:51] delivered. That's as much as Peter re
[29:54] rehearsed. But if we keep going through
[29:55] the rest of the verse, it says, "For in
[29:57] Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be
[30:00] deliverance, as the Lord has said, and
[30:02] the remnant whom the Lord shall call."
[30:04] So there's going to be a re a
[30:06] deliverance for Mount Zion. Amen.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; And the choosing of the bride, brother
[30:12] says, I believe it was Elijah one time
[30:14] up on Mount Carmel after the showdown in
[30:17] a great hour of the crisis that we're
[30:19] just about to come to right now.
[30:22] Perhaps it may be to you or I tonight
[30:24] that we make this choice like the Mount
[30:26] Carmel experience. Frankly, I think it's
[30:29] going on worldwide now, but there will
[30:31] soon be a time where that you have to
[30:33] make a choice. So, Brother Benham is
[30:35] talking about this Mount Carmel showdown
[30:37] and he's typing it with a choice that
[30:39] has to be made. And he said, frankly, he
[30:41] thought it was going on worldwide then.
[30:43] And so, let's go and look at Mount
[30:44] Carmel. Let's turn together the first
[30:46] Kings 18 and start looking at this
[30:49] scripture together.
[31:01] First Kings chapter 18 verse 17.
[31:06] First Kings 18 and 17.
[31:10] And it came to pass when Ahab saw Elij
[31:12] saw Elijah that Ahab said unto him, "Art
[31:15] thou he that troubleth Israel?" And he
[31:17] answered,"I have not troubled Israel,
[31:20] but thou in thy father's house, and that
[31:22] you have forsaken the commandments of
[31:24] the Lord, and thou hast followed Balum.
[31:27] Now therefore, send and gather to me all
[31:30] Israel unto Mount Carmel, and the
[31:32] prophets of Baal 450, and the prophets
[31:35] of the gross 400 which eat at Jezebel's
[31:37] table." So Ahab sent unto all the
[31:40] children of Israel, and gathered the
[31:41] prophets together unto Mount Carmel.
[31:45] Amen. I thought this was interesting.
[31:47] There's going to be, Brother Bam talks
[31:48] about the Mount Carmel showdown. This is
[31:50] the Mount Carmel showdown that we're
[31:52] coming to. And when he comes to this
[31:53] time, God sends him now to address the
[31:56] nation. And and they're in a time of
[31:58] famine. They're in a dry time. And God
[32:01] sends him because it's time now for
[32:02] rain. So he sends him to the Mount
[32:04] Carmel showdown because it's time now
[32:06] for rain. So when he comes to the Mount
[32:08] Carmel showdown, he he says, "Gather
[32:11] together the prophets of Baal." And he
[32:13] says, "Are you the one that troubled
[32:14] Israel?" because they thought all the
[32:16] troubles came because this prophet was
[32:18] criticizing them so much and speaking
[32:20] contrary to everybody else. But he says,
[32:21] "No, you've troubled Israel because you
[32:23] left the commandments of the Lord."
[32:25] That's where the trouble came in in the
[32:27] church ages. That's where all the
[32:28] trouble was always coming by leaving the
[32:30] word.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "Gather them together unto
[32:34] Carmel." So, I just clicked on Carmel to
[32:36] see what it meant because I mean there's
[32:38] everything has significance in the
[32:39] Bible. And Carmel means garden land.
[32:43] Gather to Mount Carmel. There's going to
[32:45] be a showdown in garden land. Amen. Why?
[32:48] Because everything has to do with what
[32:50] happened in the garden of God. And
[32:52] everything is a restoration back to the
[32:54] garden. Now, they're going to have a
[32:55] showdown on the top of Mount Carmel in
[32:57] garden land. I just I love it. Sometimes
[33:01] we don't even know what the full
[33:02] significance is, but you just tap into
[33:03] something. Let me say there's something
[33:04] there. Praise God.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; May he reveal more and more of it as we
[33:08] go. So let's let's look back at the
[33:11] Bible again here. Verse 21.
[33:13] And Elijah came unto all the people and
[33:15] said, "How long halt you between two
[33:18] opinions.
[33:20] If the Lord be God, follow him. But if
[33:22] Baal, then follow him." And the people
[33:24] answered him not a word. So when he
[33:26] comes to the Mount Carmel showdown, he's
[33:29] telling them, why are you halting
[33:31] between two opinions? You're not
[33:34] following wholly after the Lord, but
[33:36] you've you you've mixed this. Why? If
[33:38] Baal's God, follow him. If the Lord's
[33:40] God, follow him. But stop blending this
[33:43] religion because at the end time, it's
[33:45] all blended religion through
[33:46] denominations.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. In verse 22, he says,
[33:50] 'Then said Elijah unto the people, I
[33:53] even I only remain a prophet of the
[33:56] Lord, but Baal's prophets are 450 men.
[34:00] I'm going to read the scripture again.
[34:02] Then said Elijah and to the people, I
[34:04] even I only remain a prophet of the
[34:06] Lord.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; We're looking at the Mount Carmel
[34:10] showdown. And the Mount Carmel showdown
[34:11] comes to Elijah versus everybody else.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Right? I even I only remain a prophet of
[34:20] the Lord. But Baal's prophets are 450
[34:23] men. Let them therefore give us two
[34:26] bullocks, and let them choose one
[34:27] bullock for themselves, and cut it in
[34:29] pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no
[34:31] fire under, and I will dress the other
[34:33] bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no
[34:35] fire under. And call ye on the name of
[34:38] your gods, and I will call on the name
[34:39] of the Lord. And the God thatth by fire,
[34:42] let him be God. And all the people
[34:44] answered and said, "It is well spoken."
[34:47] So we know the prophets of Baal, they
[34:49] try, they they cry out, they lance
[34:51] themselves, they shout, and nothing
[34:54] happens. Then after all that, we come to
[34:56] verse 30. It says, "And Elijah said unto
[34:59] all the people, come near unto me." And
[35:01] all the people came near unto him, and
[35:03] he repaired the altar of the Lord that
[35:05] was broken down. Amen. He wasn't
[35:07] bringing a new religion. He was bringing
[35:09] them back to what they left. Yeah. Amen.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; And he repaired the altar that was broke
[35:14] down. And Elijah took 12 stones
[35:16] according to the number of the tribes of
[35:18] the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of
[35:20] the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be
[35:22] thy name. And with the stones he built
[35:24] an altar in the name of the Lord. And he
[35:26] made a trench about the altar as great
[35:28] as would contain two measures of seed.
[35:30] And he put the wood in order and cut the
[35:32] bulllock in pieces and laid them on the
[35:34] wood and said, "Fill four full four
[35:36] barrels with water and pour it on the
[35:38] burnt sacrifice and on the wood." He
[35:40] said, "Do it a second time." And they
[35:42] did it the second time. And he said, "Do
[35:43] it the third time." And they did it the
[35:45] third time. And the water ran around
[35:47] about the altar and filled the trench
[35:49] also with water. And it came to pass at
[35:52] the time of the offering of the evening
[35:54] sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came
[35:57] near and said,"Lord God of Abraham,
[35:59] Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known
[36:01] this day that thou art God in Israel and
[36:03] that I am thy servant and that I have
[36:05] done all these things at thy word."
[36:08] What's he asking for? He's saying,
[36:09] "Vindicate that I'm speaking for you.
[36:13] Amen.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; I did all this at the word and prove and
[36:16] vindicate that I am your prophet and I'm
[36:18] speaking for you. Hear me, oh Lord. Hear
[36:21] me that this people may know that thou
[36:24] art the Lord God and that thou hast
[36:26] turned their heart back again. Then the
[36:29] fire of the Lord fell and consumed and
[36:31] burnt sacrifi the the burnt the
[36:33] sacrifice and the wood and the stones
[36:35] and the dust and licked up the water
[36:37] that was in the trench. And when all the
[36:39] people saw it, they fell on their faces,
[36:40] and they said, "The Lord, he is the God.
[36:43] The Lord, he is the God." And Elijah
[36:46] said unto them, "Take the prophets of
[36:47] Baal. Let not one of them escape." And
[36:49] they took them. And Elijah brought them
[36:51] down to the brook Keon, and slew them
[36:53] there. And Elijah said unto Hab, "Get
[36:56] thee up, eat, and drink, for there is a
[36:58] sound of abundance of rain." So this is
[37:01] the Mount Carmel showdown. And we come
[37:03] to Mount Carmel showdown. There's an
[37:05] Elijah ministry. And Elijah has the word
[37:08] of the Lord. God has spoke to him and
[37:09] given him the word of the Lord. And that
[37:11] word is to restore back Israel to their
[37:14] proper worship. Amen. To repair their
[37:16] altar, to turn their hearts back again.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; And when he comes to the comes to the
[37:21] showdown, Amen. The showdown now becomes
[37:24] between one prophet and all the other
[37:26] prophets,
[37:29] &gt;&gt; all the other voices, all the other
[37:31] denominations, all the other whatever
[37:33] you want to call it. It's a showdown.
[37:35] where God now is going to vindicate that
[37:38] this is my voice and he's one. Amen.
[37:40] Only one voice and that voice has the
[37:42] correct word that is to turn the hearts
[37:44] of the children back to restore the
[37:46] altar to do what I commanded him to do
[37:48] and to bring the rain.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; And that's the Mount Carmel showdown
[37:54] between Elijah and the prophets of Baal.
[37:57] I just want you I just want to make note
[37:59] the reason I read that we've been
[38:00] through this before, but I want to
[38:02] emphasize the fact that the Mount Carmel
[38:04] showdown was between one voice and all
[38:07] the other voices
[38:09] &gt;&gt; and God vindicated which was his voice
[38:12] by a supernatural sign. Amen. And then
[38:14] they all they all their hearts were
[38:16] turned all of Israel their hearts were
[38:18] turned back to God. Amen. So let's
[38:21] continue on now.
[38:23] In Christ, the mystery of God revealed.
[38:26] He says, "The Holy Ghost alone shows you
[38:28] who he is, no prophets or his kings."
[38:32] And here, God is manifested in flesh.
[38:35] Here is the fullness. He's speaking of
[38:37] Jesus Christ. Now, I I'm going to go
[38:39] back. I don't have the quote uh uh on
[38:42] the overhead, but a couple paragraphs
[38:44] earlier in Christ is the mystery of God
[38:46] revealed, he says this. Now notice, not
[38:48] prophets, not kings, not nothing else,
[38:51] but here for the first time, God was
[38:54] revealed in Christ and the fullness of
[38:56] the Godhead bodily in human flesh.
[38:59] That's the revelation. Remember the
[39:02] title is Christ is the mystery of God
[39:04] revealed. And now he's saying now it's
[39:07] not in prophets. Now it's not in kings.
[39:09] Amen. Nothing else. But for the first
[39:12] time, God is revealed in Christ in the
[39:15] fullness of the Godhead bodily and
[39:16] flesh. This is the first time he's done
[39:18] that. It was partial in the prophets and
[39:21] in the kings. In David, it was a it was
[39:23] a reflection of Christ. It was a
[39:24] foreshadow of Christ. It was Christ in
[39:26] measure in Moses. It was Christ in
[39:28] measure in Jeremiah. But now, for the
[39:30] first time, it's God in the fullness, in
[39:34] flesh. That's the revelation.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; And then we come to this quote. Now he
[39:39] says, "The Holy Ghost alone shows you
[39:41] who he is. No prophets or kings. And
[39:43] here God is manifest in the flesh. Here
[39:45] is the fullness. He is completely
[39:47] revealed and made known to the world. Oh
[39:49] my. Look on Mount Transfiguration when
[39:52] the testimony of God himself. This is my
[39:55] beloved son. Hear ye him. There stood
[39:57] Moses representing the law. There stood
[39:59] Elijah representing the prophets. But
[40:02] they passed away and he said this is my
[40:04] beloved son. Hear him. There was three
[40:07] represented there. The law, the prophets
[40:09] and Christ. And he said, "This is him,
[40:12] God fully. Not manifested in prophets,
[40:14] not manifested by the law, but
[40:16] manifested in Christ." He is. Let's go
[40:19] look at this in Matthew 17 together.
[40:23] We saw the Mount Carmel showdown. Now
[40:25] we're coming to Mount Transfiguration
[40:27] Showdown.
[40:30] Matthew chapter 17.
[40:44] Matthew 17
[40:46] verse one. And after six days Jesus
[40:49] taketh Peter and James and John his
[40:51] brother and bringeth him up into a high
[40:53] mountain apart and was transfigured
[40:56] before them. This is where we get the
[40:57] term mount transfiguration. That wasn't
[40:59] actually the name of the mountain. He
[41:00] took him to a mountain and was
[41:01] transfigured. So it became Mount
[41:03] Transfiguration.
[41:05] And he was transfigured before them, and
[41:07] his face did shine as the sun, and his
[41:09] raignment was white as the light. And
[41:11] behold, there appeared unto them Moses
[41:14] and Elias talking with him. Then
[41:17] answered Peter, and said unto Jesus,
[41:19] Lord, it is good for us to be here. If
[41:21] thou wilt, let us make here three
[41:23] tabernacles, one for thee, one for
[41:26] Moses, and one for Elias. And while he
[41:29] yet spake, behold, a bright cloud
[41:30] overshadowed them. And behold, a voice
[41:32] out of the cloud which said, "This is my
[41:35] beloved son in whom I am well pleased.
[41:38] Hear ye him."
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is gets so good, friends. I I
[41:43] just pray that God will help me just to
[41:44] get out of myself and jump out of my
[41:46] skin and let God take over because
[41:48] there's something so rich and so good
[41:50] here that I want to bring. Amen. Amen.
[41:53] They they they they have these two
[41:54] witnesses that appear with Jesus as he's
[41:56] transfigured and he's shown in his all
[41:58] of his glory and he's glorifi he's in a
[42:01] glorified condition and his face did
[42:02] shine and his reignment was white as
[42:04] snow and and appearing with them and
[42:07] unto them. Amen. Where Moses and Elijah
[42:09] and it looked to Peter like this is
[42:11] great. You're one of the three. Now look
[42:14] at these three witnesses. Let's build
[42:16] three tabernacles. that God did not
[42:18] bring Moses and Elijah for that purpose
[42:20] because Moses represents the law. Elijah
[42:23] represents the prophet and the law and
[42:25] the prophets were the entire word to
[42:27] that point.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; They were the entire Old Testament. The
[42:29] New Testament wasn't written yet. Jesus
[42:31] came as a as as the as the key, amen,
[42:34] between the two. And now the whole word
[42:37] is here testifying by the mouth of two
[42:39] witnesses that this is the fulfillment
[42:42] of everything Moses wrote and all that
[42:44] the prophets had declared. Here he is.
[42:46] and that God brought two witnesses to
[42:47] witness to this transfiguration. And and
[42:50] and Peter misunderstood the role of the
[42:53] witnesses. But God thundered out with a
[42:56] voice. He said, "This is my son. This is
[42:59] my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased.
[43:02] Hear ye him."
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; No other voice, no other prophets,
[43:07] brother. No other kings. But now
[43:09] everything, the fullness of the word was
[43:11] wrapped up in him. And he was saying now
[43:14] it's in him. hear him.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; That's what he did to Elijah in Mount
[43:22] Carmel with the vindication in Carmel.
[43:24] He said, "He has the voice. He did this
[43:27] at my word. Hear him."
[43:31] &gt;&gt; And now in Mount Transfiguration, he
[43:33] brings Jesus into a glorified condition.
[43:35] Amen. And he shows that the law and the
[43:37] prophets are in him. They're testifying
[43:39] it's in him. Now I'm in him. Now
[43:41] everything's in him. This is the
[43:43] fullness made flesh. Hear him.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; It was the showdown between Jesus Christ
[43:50] and every other voice.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said in blasphe blasphemous
[43:57] names. While he was yet speaking, God
[43:59] shut him up. He said, "This is my
[44:01] beloved son in whom I'm well pleased.
[44:03] Hear him." See, God put himself in the
[44:06] background.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; This is amazing. And said, "This is my
[44:10] son. This is now who I am. This is now
[44:12] where I am. This is now where I'm
[44:14] dwelling.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Listen, this is Mount Transfiguration
[44:21] Showdown. In the showdown, there wasn't
[44:24] a thousand prophets of Baal. There
[44:26] wasn't all the Pharisees and Sadducees.
[44:28] Amen. There was the law and the prophets
[44:31] witnessing that, hey, we're turning it
[44:33] all over to him. Amen. It's all him.
[44:35] Everything we talked about in him.
[44:37] Everything we pointed to is in him.
[44:39] Everything we demonstrated, it's in him.
[44:41] Now it's all in him. It's him. He's all
[44:43] of it. And everything else subsides
[44:46] because it's him.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; And then in desperations he says God did
[44:57] the same thing by his son on Mount
[44:59] Transfiguration. He was overshadowed by
[45:02] a cloud and was transfigured and his
[45:04] raignment shine like the sun and a voice
[45:05] said this is my beloved son in whom I'm
[45:08] well pleased. Moses and the law had
[45:10] failed. And this is him. Hear ye him. He
[45:16] was placed.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; This was adoption.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Now he'd come to Now he'd been proven.
[45:22] Now he'd been tested to be proved a
[45:24] perfect son. Now he is being placed as
[45:26] what? He He is all of it. It's all in
[45:29] him. Everything's in him. Hear him.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Mount Transfiguration Showdown.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:38] him against who? Him against any other
[45:41] voice.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; It's only in him. I'm in him. The word
[45:46] is in him. All my thought is in him. The
[45:49] fullness of the word is in him. It's all
[45:50] in him.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now, let's go to the rest of
[45:56] the scripture. Pick it up. Matthew 17:6.
[45:59] And when the disciples heard it, they
[46:01] fell on their faces and were sore
[46:02] afraid. And Jesus came and touched him
[46:05] and said, "Arise and be not afraid." And
[46:07] when they had lifted up their eyes, they
[46:09] saw no man. No man saved Jesus only.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. This was the Mount Transfiguration
[46:17] Showdown. This is nobody else. No other
[46:19] voice. Nothing else. It's all I put my
[46:22] voice in him. I put my word in him. I
[46:24] put myself in him. It's all in him. Hear
[46:27] him.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[46:33] Amen. Mount Carmel.
[46:37] No other prophet, nobody else had the
[46:40] word for restoration. It was all in
[46:42] Elijah. It was in him. He said, "I alone
[46:44] remain a prophet of the Lord. I by
[46:47] myself." And God vindicated that he was
[46:49] the voice. It was him. Not the 450, not
[46:52] the other 400. Amen. It was him.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; And God come in mount transfiguration.
[46:57] He said, "No other voice. Nobody else
[47:00] speaks. No, it's all in him."
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:06] Brother says it was something as I said
[47:08] this morning like the people or like
[47:10] Peter said in St. Matthew 17:4 to8 where
[47:13] he said it's good to be here. Let's
[47:16] build three tabernacles. But the spirit
[47:18] bade them not to do it. He said this is
[47:19] my beloved son. Hear ye him and he is
[47:22] the word. That's who we're to look to
[47:25] the word not our enthusiasm or something
[47:28] else. He is my word. Hear ye him. And
[47:31] what did they see after this voice spoke
[47:33] to them? Even Moses and Elijah wasn't
[47:36] present. Neither was there a creed.
[47:38] What? Neither was there a creed.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Neither was there anything left but
[47:42] Jesus only and he is the word.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; That's all they seen.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to go back to pick up
[47:49] your pen and write. And he says the
[47:51] showdown be will be between Jesus and
[47:54] the denominations and creed. And what is
[47:56] Jesus? He is the word. Who is our
[47:58] bridegroom? The word made manifest for
[48:00] the day. Amen. Jesus is the word.
[48:03] Whenever the anointed word comes on the
[48:05] scene, that's Christ. That's Jesus.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; That's all they seen. What was all they
[48:15] seen? The word.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; He was the word.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; He was the fullness of the word bodily.
[48:23] He was glorified, showing who he really
[48:26] was.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; In the Easter Seal, he says, "No wonder
[48:29] Jesus said, "Fear not. I'm he that was
[48:31] dead, but I'm alive forever more. For
[48:35] now we are redeemed by him and are risen
[48:37] with him and are now not will be sitting
[48:40] in heavenly places in him. Now when when
[48:44] we have this spirit in us, the abstract
[48:46] shows that all of the doubts has been
[48:48] stricken off. Why? Christ lives, not I
[48:50] live. Oh, I want you to focus on this
[48:52] right here. Not I live, not me, but
[48:57] Christ lives in me. Amen.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Not you live but Christ lives in you
[49:02] because his living word lives in you
[49:04] showing that all the accounts of all
[49:06] your Methodism, baptism, Pentecost
[49:07] ideas, everything else was stricken off
[49:10] uh everything on else was stricken off.
[49:13] And Jesus Christ like on Mount
[49:16] Transfiguration, all the prophets and
[49:18] everything else is finished. All the
[49:20] days of Luther and Methodist and
[49:22] Presbyterian, they're all right. But
[49:24] this is my beloved son. Hear ye him. Who
[49:27] is he? The word of this hour, the hour
[49:29] of the seals. Hear ye him, the fullness
[49:32] of the word, brought back to the church.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; When all the mysteries back yonder
[49:37] that's been hid all these years, them is
[49:39] that great pyramid of time was stricken
[49:41] off the headstone. Make it honed down so
[49:44] that the star of David was settled into
[49:46] its place and the great church of the
[49:48] living God will be raised like the wings
[49:49] of an eagle packed out yonder to glory.
[49:52] Yes, this is my beloved son. Hear ye
[49:55] him. the word of this hour, the hour of
[49:58] the seals
[50:00] &gt;&gt; in the restoration of the bride tree. He
[50:02] says, "But what?" He was God's perfect
[50:06] prophet tree, the example tree, the
[50:08] bridegroom tree. Amen. Glory. Going to
[50:11] say something directly. He is the
[50:13] bridegroom tree. Do you believe it? From
[50:15] the Garden of Eden. Then the bridegroom
[50:17] tree without the female don't bear
[50:19] fruit. He's got to have a bride tree.
[50:22] She has got to be born of the same
[50:24] materials, the word made flesh in the
[50:27] tree.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Hope you get it. It's the same life in
[50:31] this female tree, the bridegroom, as it
[50:33] is in the bride. The works that I do
[50:35] shall you do also. Is that right?
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Now, he's saying, Brother Bam's coming
[50:39] and telling us, Amen, that the
[50:40] bridegroom tree, Amen, he can't bear
[50:43] fruit without a bride tree. He needs a
[50:44] bride tree. Why? He's pointing all the
[50:46] way back to the masterpiece in the
[50:48] Garden of Eden when Adam was alone. God
[50:50] said, "It's not good that man shall
[50:52] dwell alone. I shall make a help meat
[50:54] for him." And out of Adam, he brought
[50:56] the perfect help meat, which was his
[50:58] wife, which was a part of Adam, Adam's
[51:00] spirit, Adam's flesh, made into a
[51:02] manifestation. And God united them back
[51:05] to two. And brother Brenham said that
[51:07] was his great work, the two becoming
[51:08] one,
[51:10] &gt;&gt; the masterpiece family. And he's
[51:12] pointing back to that when he speaks to
[51:13] this. Now, he's the bridegroom tree from
[51:16] the Garden of Eden, the tree of life.
[51:18] But that tree without the female tree
[51:20] because that picture has to be perfect.
[51:22] That's a perfect picture. And what God's
[51:25] working with is what he foreshadowed in
[51:27] the Garden of Eden. And now he needs a
[51:28] bride tree. But what will the bride tree
[51:31] be? She'll be the word made flesh in
[51:33] this tree.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Cuz he was the word made flesh in him.
[51:37] Now it's got to be the word made flesh
[51:39] in his bride.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; The same life in this female tree. Now
[51:45] you see why? Listen. I don't know how to
[51:48] say these things. You see how that can't
[51:50] be you. That can't be you. The one born
[51:53] of your mom and dad. That can't be you.
[51:55] The one who grew up a boy. That can't be
[51:57] you. That has to be Christ in you.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; It's got to be something more than than
[52:02] you. This flesh you that you see in the
[52:04] mirror. That you is hybrid. That you is
[52:07] wrong. But there's another you on the
[52:09] inside. That's an attribute of almighty
[52:11] God. A sea gene of God. Amen. That's
[52:13] part of this life. And that has to come
[52:16] to life by his life, by his word to
[52:18] bring forth his life again.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; So it's not Listen, we can we can say we
[52:28] can say I'm bride. I'm bride. I'm bride
[52:30] all I want. Amen. But saying it doesn't
[52:32] make it so. Amen. But those who his life
[52:35] comes to live in those who his word
[52:37] abides in those who become the very
[52:39] manifestation of the hour. Amen. in the
[52:41] manifestation of Jesus Christ's life in
[52:44] a many membered body. That is the bride.
[52:46] That is the restoration of the bride
[52:48] tree.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; That is where his life is. That is where
[52:51] his word is made flesh.
[52:53] Man, we believe by faith that we're part
[52:55] of that. But whether we're part of that
[52:57] or not, it doesn't stop. It's still
[52:58] going to be on earth and it's still
[53:00] going to be in flesh and it's still
[53:01] going to be his life in a many membered
[53:03] body.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. And God's provided
[53:09] place of worship. He said there's only
[53:10] one meeting place
[53:12] &gt;&gt; that's in Christ Jesus. Oh, today how
[53:14] how today that I would that everybody
[53:17] would see that see how to get in being
[53:20] baptized. The bride is part of her
[53:22] husband. The church is part of the word
[53:25] the manifestation.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we want to be.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Back in Ephesians 5, he says, "So ought
[53:34] men to love their wives as their own
[53:36] bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth
[53:39] himself. For no man ever yet hated his
[53:41] own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth
[53:43] it, even as the Lord the church. For we
[53:46] are members of his body, of his flesh,
[53:48] and of his bones. For this cause shall a
[53:51] man leave his father and mother, and
[53:53] shall be joined unto his wife, and they
[53:55] too shall be one flesh.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; This is a great mystery, but I speak
[54:02] concerning Christ in the church.
[54:05] The great mystery is that Christ and his
[54:08] church will be one flesh.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; That's the great mystery.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Things that are to be says now if we are
[54:18] those attributes of God, we cannot live
[54:20] by creits. We cannot live by
[54:23] denominationalism.
[54:25] We must live by the word. That's why the
[54:28] word has been restored in this day
[54:30] because the bride is part of the
[54:32] bridegroom like any wife is part of her
[54:34] husband. Therefore, we must be that word
[54:37] bride. And what is the word bride? The
[54:41] manifestation of this hour, the bride,
[54:45] not the creed or the denominations, but
[54:48] a living oracle of God, a living
[54:50] attribute of God, displaying to the
[54:51] world the attributes of God in the
[54:53] formation of the bride. That's to be
[54:55] expressed in this hour that we're now
[54:57] living.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; What is the word bride? Listen, this is
[55:01] why to be bride, you have to be a word
[55:03] bride.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; You can't be a You can't You and I
[55:07] cannot be bride by our declaration
[55:09] through our mouth alone. Because this
[55:11] must be a word bride. What is a word
[55:13] bride? The word bride is a one who
[55:15] submitted to surrendered to the headship
[55:16] of the word totally given over so that
[55:19] he can take preeminence and then that
[55:20] word can live out in the flesh that he's
[55:23] abiding in. That's what it takes to be a
[55:25] word bride. Not coming to a certain
[55:27] church, not agreeing with a certain
[55:29] standard. Amen. Not saying I'm a so and
[55:31] so. But what makes a word bride is a
[55:34] body, a people who surrendered to the
[55:36] word for their hour, who's come in
[55:38] contact with a living Jesus Christ in
[55:40] their hour and died to everything else
[55:42] but this message and this headship and
[55:44] now letting the headship come to the
[55:46] body and work through the body.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; That's what it takes to be a word bride.
[55:51] And I want to be a word bride. And in
[55:53] order to be a word bride, I've got to
[55:54] lay down my life every day. I got to die
[55:56] more than I died the day before. And if
[55:59] I've got one thought contrary to this
[56:00] message, I got to die to that thought.
[56:02] And if I got anything in my life that's
[56:04] contrary, I need the spirit of God to
[56:06] come and burn that thing out of me.
[56:08] Because to be a word bride, I've got to
[56:10] be manifesting the word.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; You can't get it by attendance.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; It's not where you go to church. It's
[56:20] not even what you agree with. Amen. It's
[56:23] not just that alone. Amen. It's an
[56:25] absolute surrender to the message of
[56:27] this hour. And this message is Christ.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; It's a restoration of the truth that
[56:32] have been lost down through time. God,
[56:34] what? And then brought to the the the
[56:36] mystery of what was in the back part of
[56:38] God's mind. Amen. And that has been
[56:40] whispered as love secrets
[56:43] &gt;&gt; into the ear of his bride.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; And she surrenders herself to it.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:49] So he must be the word bride.
[56:53] And what is the word bride?
[56:56] The manifestation
[56:58] of this hour.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Not a creed or denomination.
[57:05] Remember what the showdown is in Mount
[57:06] Zion.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; It's a showdown between Jesus and the
[57:09] denominations and creeds.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[57:16] Christ is the mystery. He says, "Now
[57:18] he's sanctified with his spirit and
[57:20] blood a church that he might make every
[57:22] promise in this last day be revealed."
[57:25] Now, see, he could go back and pick up
[57:27] what these other fellas has left off
[57:28] here in the last days and by his holy
[57:31] spirit reveal all the mysteries of the
[57:32] seven seals. See, he he is expressing
[57:36] himself.
[57:38] I I want to circle this
[57:42] because I like circling stuff,
[57:45] but I want to highlight this because so
[57:46] many times we read stuff and we've read
[57:48] it before and we know it. But but
[57:51] listen, by his Holy Spirit, he revealed
[57:53] all the mystery of the seven seals
[57:56] &gt;&gt; so that you would know what a red horse
[57:57] is and a white. No, he's trying to
[58:00] reveal himself. Yeah,
[58:02] &gt;&gt; he's trying by the opening of the seals,
[58:04] the revealing of the of the seven
[58:06] thunders, he's trying to reveal himself.
[58:08] He's trying to show you who's present,
[58:10] where we are in time, what he's trying
[58:12] to accomplish in this hour. He's
[58:14] attempting through the opening of the
[58:16] word to reveal himself. That's right.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; That's his purpose.
[58:21] That's why he died. That's the second
[58:24] fold of his three-fold manifestation.
[58:26] First, to express himself in Christ. He
[58:29] did that in Jesus Christ. Then express
[58:32] himself through the church. And the same
[58:35] thing, Christ was the word. And the
[58:37] church becomes the word when it lets the
[58:40] word go through them.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; I don't become the word by saying I'm
[58:45] becoming the word. I become the word by
[58:47] surrendering to the word and letting the
[58:49] life of the word, which is the spirit of
[58:51] God, the spirit of Christ, come and flow
[58:53] through me. So now it's not a life I
[58:55] live myself, but it's a life he comes
[58:57] and lives through me. It's a surrender
[58:59] as a wife. It's it's a connection to the
[59:01] headship and to the power of this word
[59:03] that's been released.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Christ was the word and the church
[59:08] becomes the word when it lets the word
[59:10] go through them.
[59:13] Amen.
[59:15] I want to turn, can you turn with me to
[59:17] John 14,
[59:20] the Gospel of John?
[59:26] John 14
[59:36] and verse 23.
[59:43] Actually,
[59:45] uh,
[59:49] let's go to verse 18. No, no, I'm sorry.
[59:53] 16. Is it okay if we back up and read
[59:56] plenty?
[59:57] &gt;&gt; We got a little bit of time.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Verse 16. And I will pray the father and
[1:00:02] he will give you another comforter that
[1:00:04] he may abide with you forever. Even the
[1:00:07] spirit of truth. We know this by the
[1:00:09] rest of the scripture. This is the Holy
[1:00:10] Spirit. This is the Holy Ghost. Even the
[1:00:13] spirit of truth whom the world cannot
[1:00:14] receive because it seeth him not.
[1:00:16] Neither knoweth him. But you know him
[1:00:18] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[1:00:20] you. I will not leave you comfortless. I
[1:00:24] will come to you
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; yet a little while and the world seeth
[1:00:28] me no more but ye see me because I live
[1:00:31] ye shall live also at that day brother
[1:00:34] said that's this day
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; at that day you shall know that I am in
[1:00:37] my father ye in me and I in you
[1:00:42] in my father and ye in me and I in you.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; So where'd the father go?
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Verse 21. He that hath my commandments
[1:00:51] and keepeth them, he it is that loveth
[1:00:53] me. And he that loveth me, what is his
[1:00:56] commandments? That's his word.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Think of the word. Don't think of rules
[1:01:00] and regulations and all. Just think of
[1:01:02] the word. He that hath my commandments,
[1:01:04] my word, and keepeth them, he it is that
[1:01:06] loveth me. And he that loveth me shall
[1:01:08] be loved to my father, and I will love
[1:01:10] him and will manifest myself to him.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Verse 22. Judas saith unto him, not a
[1:01:16] scariat, Lord, how is it that thou wilt
[1:01:19] manifest thyself unto us and not unto
[1:01:22] the world? Now, manifest means reveal.
[1:01:25] I'll come and unveil or reveal myself to
[1:01:27] them. He said, how will you come and
[1:01:29] show yourself to us and not to the whole
[1:01:31] world? If you come, won't they see you?
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; If you come back to us, won't they see
[1:01:38] you? So, how will you come back to us
[1:01:40] and reveal yourself to us, but not
[1:01:42] reveal yourself to the whole world?
[1:01:45] Because he says, "I won't leave you
[1:01:46] comfortless. I will come to you." He's
[1:01:47] speaking the same person. It's not
[1:01:49] another person. It's the same person.
[1:01:51] But how is the same person going to come
[1:01:53] and reveal himself to disciples and not
[1:01:55] the rest of the world see them because
[1:01:57] all they understand is what they're
[1:01:59] seeing before their eyes, the word made
[1:02:01] flesh in Jesus Christ. And they said,
[1:02:03] "If you come, yeah, not just us will see
[1:02:06] you. Everyone will see you." But they
[1:02:08] don't understand what this coming is
[1:02:09] going to be like. It's the same person
[1:02:11] in another form.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, how is the will thyself
[1:02:17] unto us? How wilt thou manifest thyself
[1:02:19] unto us and not into the world?" Jesus
[1:02:21] answered and said unto him, "If a man
[1:02:24] love me, he will keep my words."
[1:02:28] It comes back to the word, friends. It
[1:02:30] always comes back to the word. If a man
[1:02:33] love me, he will keep my words. And my
[1:02:35] father will love him. And we
[1:02:39] say we
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; and we will come unto him and make our
[1:02:44] abode with him.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; We
[1:02:50] how are you going to come? The question
[1:02:52] is how are you going to manifest
[1:02:54] yourself unto us and not to the world?
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Here's his answer. If any man keep my
[1:03:01] words.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see why there had to be a
[1:03:06] restoration of the word at the end time
[1:03:08] so we could come back to that in that
[1:03:10] day you will know I am in the father ye
[1:03:12] and me and I brother Bam said in that
[1:03:14] day is this day because in order to keep
[1:03:16] the word there had to be a restoration
[1:03:18] of the word in the hour of the
[1:03:20] restoration of the word how Lord Jesus
[1:03:22] will you come and reveal yourself to us
[1:03:24] and the whole world won't see you when
[1:03:26] you come back to your church I'll tell
[1:03:28] you how because if you keep my word
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; if you love me you will keep my words
[1:03:33] and my father will love him and we will
[1:03:36] come unto him and make our abode with
[1:03:37] him. We two, there's not two, there's
[1:03:40] only one, but these are two offices. The
[1:03:42] office of the father and the office of
[1:03:44] the son. And how will they come? Through
[1:03:46] the office of the holy ghost. So all
[1:03:49] three are coming into the church.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; That's how he manifest himself into them
[1:03:56] and not to the world. If a man loves me,
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; he'll keep my words and my father will
[1:04:03] love him.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; And we
[1:04:08] don't believe in trinitarianism. We
[1:04:10] don't believe in two persons or three
[1:04:12] persons in the Godhead. What he saying?
[1:04:14] All that God was, he poured into Christ.
[1:04:16] All that Christ was, he poured into the
[1:04:18] church. And so now, what's coming into
[1:04:20] the church? Amen. If you keep my word,
[1:04:23] if you love me and keep my word, in the
[1:04:25] hour that you have my word,
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Then you'll have the father and you have
[1:04:32] the son by the office of the holy ghost,
[1:04:35] you get fullness again.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Praise be unto our god. Friends,
[1:04:43] let's move on.
[1:04:45] Now Christ is the mystery regard. He
[1:04:46] says that's it. Christ the word. He was
[1:04:49] the word. He is the word and the church
[1:04:52] becomes the word by him making her a
[1:04:55] part of him. And that's the word again.
[1:04:59] What is it? The marriage, the invisible
[1:05:01] union. Amen. The headship coming to the
[1:05:03] body, the word coming down to have an
[1:05:06] abiding place, abiding in the hearts of
[1:05:08] his people. And when that invisible
[1:05:10] union takes place, he said the church
[1:05:12] becomes the word by him making her a
[1:05:15] part of him. And that's the word again,
[1:05:18] personally identified by him. His
[1:05:21] property alone, his property alone. She
[1:05:24] is redeemed by him, through him, for
[1:05:27] him, and for him alone. That's right.
[1:05:30] Then what is the devil howling about
[1:05:32] that? It's being revealed.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:36] In Ephesians 1, he says, "And hath put
[1:05:38] all things under his feet, and gave him
[1:05:41] the head to be the gave him to be the
[1:05:44] head over all things to the church,
[1:05:46] which is his body, the fullness of him
[1:05:49] that fleth all in all."
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; He gave him to be head
[1:05:54] over all things to the church,
[1:05:58] which is his body.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; What is his body?
[1:06:06] What is Oh my goodness, I did it again.
[1:06:11] What is his body?
[1:06:13] The church.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; And what is his body? The fullness
[1:06:21] of him that filth all in all.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; What does God want to become in the end
[1:06:26] time? He wants to come into his church.
[1:06:30] He himself and her until she will be
[1:06:34] him.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; The two will be one flesh.
[1:06:40] This is the great mystery that I speak
[1:06:43] of concerning Christ in the church that
[1:06:46] the two will be one flesh.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fullness of him that fillth
[1:06:51] all in all. That's the expression that
[1:06:54] he's looking for.
[1:06:56] Now in Christ is the mystery of God
[1:06:58] revealed.
[1:06:59] says, "Identified all the devil is
[1:07:01] howling about this, the manifested truth
[1:07:04] of the promise of the word
[1:07:07] in her alone."
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; What is the devil howling about?
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; What is he so angry about? What's
[1:07:18] causing all the fuss? What's causing all
[1:07:20] the disagreement? What's all the fuss
[1:07:22] about? The manifested truth of the
[1:07:24] promise of the word in her alone.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. They don't have the answer. When
[1:07:30] Jesus come, why didn't those Pharisees,
[1:07:32] he said, if I cast out the devil by the
[1:07:34] finger of God, who do you cast him out
[1:07:36] by? He stood alone and his church stands
[1:07:40] alone.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Are we seeing this?
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; She is not hooked with nothing, but he
[1:07:46] was identified by God being the body
[1:07:48] that God dwelt in. And the church is
[1:07:50] identified by his body doing the same
[1:07:53] thing. What's the same thing? Being the
[1:07:55] body that he dwells in.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. She is his body. The manifested
[1:08:00] truth of his promised word for the last
[1:08:02] days. She is his body, which is what?
[1:08:06] The manifested truth of the promised
[1:08:08] word for the last days. And she and she
[1:08:10] alone stands by it.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Nobody else believes this.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; She's the only one who stands with the
[1:08:17] true revelation of the true word. And
[1:08:19] it's in her only. It's nowhere else. You
[1:08:22] don't find this revelation anywhere
[1:08:23] else. This manifestation. Because if you
[1:08:26] love me, you keep my words and you keep
[1:08:27] my words. What words? All of my word.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Then my father will love you and we will
[1:08:34] come into you and make our abode with
[1:08:35] you in that day. That's this day,
[1:08:37] friends.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; And she alone stands by it. That's why
[1:08:42] the devil is howling. And these great
[1:08:43] organizations set up try to set up
[1:08:46] something to close her up. They'll never
[1:08:48] do it. She'll be taken up, not closed
[1:08:50] up. She is now. Oh my goodness. She is
[1:08:53] now risen. And by the power of the
[1:08:55] vindicated word promised to her, she is
[1:08:58] risen. Risen from what? Risen from dead
[1:09:00] denominationalism. Risen from the
[1:09:02] darkness of obscurity of the word. But
[1:09:04] she's risen back to what? She's been
[1:09:06] awakened by the latter rain. Amen.
[1:09:08] There's been nothing to stir the bride
[1:09:10] yet. Amen. But now they're crying for
[1:09:12] revivals. Revival. Revival. Why? Because
[1:09:14] they they know something's got to
[1:09:16] happen, but they haven't recognized the
[1:09:18] awakening of the bride. She is risen by
[1:09:21] the power of the vindicated word
[1:09:23] promised to her. Amen.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; She's now been raised up like Ezekiel's
[1:09:27] dry bones. She's now come back to what
[1:09:29] she was supposed to be. And now he's
[1:09:32] pouring his full word into her.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; And the devil's howling
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; about this manifestation of the truth of
[1:09:40] the promised word in her alone.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; What is the Mount Zion showdown?
[1:09:49] What was the Mount Carmel showdown?
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah. one prophet.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; The voice of God.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; The vindicated voice of God against
[1:10:00] every other voice.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; What was Mount Transfiguration?
[1:10:06] Hear ye him. One man, the fullness of
[1:10:08] the word, and every other voice
[1:10:10] silenced.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; What is the Mount Zion showdown? Him and
[1:10:16] her, the word and her alone. And she's
[1:10:18] the only one that stands by it. And
[1:10:21] every other voice is silent, no
[1:10:23] denomination, no creed, no other
[1:10:25] teaching. This is the truth of Jesus
[1:10:27] Christ. This is the revelation of Jesus
[1:10:29] Christ. This is the mystery of God
[1:10:31] revealed.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; That's what they're howling about the
[1:10:37] revelation
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; in her
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; alone.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:45] It's the legacy in church age out of the
[1:10:47] church age book. He says the church is
[1:10:50] no longer the mouthpiece of God is it it
[1:10:54] is its own mouthpiece. So God is turning
[1:10:57] on her. He will confound her through the
[1:10:58] prophet and the bride. For the voice of
[1:11:01] God will be where
[1:11:04] in hermen.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Where where else?
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Nowhere else. Amen.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; The Mount Zion showdown will be between
[1:11:14] Jesus the word and the denominations and
[1:11:17] creeds. Where will Jesus the word be? He
[1:11:20] will be in bride form.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; It's not you and I, friends. We don't
[1:11:24] have the mental ability. We don't have
[1:11:26] the power and the strength. It's what
[1:11:27] it's not what we are. It's what we
[1:11:29] surrender to. It's what what we are by
[1:11:31] predestination. Not what we are by
[1:11:33] natural birth. what we are by
[1:11:34] predestinated by by predestinated order
[1:11:37] of God brought to life by the new birth.
[1:11:39] This is why we had to come to the new
[1:11:41] birth. Amen. Because the old birth we
[1:11:43] were born wrong.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; So we had to be born by the spirit so
[1:11:46] that we can move into this position.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; It says yes it is. So the voice of God
[1:11:52] will be in her. Yes it is. For it says
[1:11:55] in the last chapter of Revelation verse
[1:11:57] 17 the spirit and the bride say come.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Once more, the world will hear
[1:12:02] direct from God as at Pentecost. But of
[1:12:05] course, the word bride will be
[1:12:07] repudiated as in the first age. What
[1:12:10] does that mean? No one else will believe
[1:12:12] it.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't change the truth of it.
[1:12:19] Again, in the Leodysian church age, oh,
[1:12:21] God still has a voice for the people of
[1:12:23] the world. He does. Who was the voice in
[1:12:26] Mount Carmel showdown? Elijah. Who is
[1:12:29] the voice at man's transfiguration
[1:12:31] showdown? Hear ye him, Jesus Christ, the
[1:12:33] word made flesh.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; But where is the voice in the end time?
[1:12:38] He has given a voice to the bride. And
[1:12:40] that voice is in the bride.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; And we will talk more about that later.
[1:12:48] I want to read this scripture.
[1:12:50] Revelation 10 verse 10. And I took the
[1:12:54] little book out of the angel's hand and
[1:12:56] ate it up. And it was in my mouth sweet
[1:12:58] as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it,
[1:13:00] my belly was bitter. And he said unto
[1:13:02] me, "Thou must prophesy again before
[1:13:05] many peoples and nations and tongues and
[1:13:08] kings."
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Who is this referring to? This was John.
[1:13:12] John was a type of the bride. What's the
[1:13:14] bride got to do? She's got to take this
[1:13:15] open book and eat it. And then she's got
[1:13:17] to prophesy again.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; There's a voice again. The voice of God
[1:13:23] again is in a people. What people? Amen.
[1:13:25] He's It's in his bride.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; What bride? The word bride.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to be part of that word
[1:13:32] bride.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; I want to be surrendered to every word.
[1:13:35] I I want to I want to love him and keep
[1:13:39] his words.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; And I want I want him and the father and
[1:13:43] the holy ghost and all of God to pour
[1:13:44] into me.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I want to read one quote to
[1:13:50] you. I don't have it on here, but you
[1:13:53] know it really, really well. But I'm
[1:13:55] just going to go to it quickly.
[1:14:00] Says
[1:14:03] this is in Revelation chapter 4 when he
[1:14:07] preached it there in 1962.
[1:14:15] He says
[1:14:17] or 1961, I'm sorry. said, "All right."
[1:14:20] Here was voices.
[1:14:22] Oh, how we need in Jeffersonville.
[1:14:25] Thousands of lived voices.
[1:14:27] The thunder of God thundering out in
[1:14:29] sweetness and holiness, purity,
[1:14:31] undefiled lives walking around in the
[1:14:34] earth today without a blemish. Yes, sir.
[1:14:36] Real Christians, that's thunder against
[1:14:38] the enemy. The devil don't care how loud
[1:14:41] you can holler. The devil don't care how
[1:14:43] much you can jump or how much you can do
[1:14:45] this or shout. But what hurts the devil
[1:14:47] is to see that sanctified holy life
[1:14:49] consecrated to God. Say anything to him,
[1:14:51] call him anything just as sweet as it
[1:14:53] can be and move right on. Oh my, that
[1:14:56] throws him away. That's the thunder that
[1:14:58] shakes the devil.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a voice of God in the
[1:15:02] last days. And yes, the bride is
[1:15:03] proclaiming the true word of God. But
[1:15:05] she's doing more than speaking it. Amen.
[1:15:07] It's becoming life. It's becoming a
[1:15:09] manifestation because this word has to
[1:15:11] be a living word. It has to be the life
[1:15:14] of Christ on display. It's got to live
[1:15:16] in a many membered body. So, it's got to
[1:15:18] live in you and it's got to live in me.
[1:15:20] And I've got to let it go through me so
[1:15:22] that it can live through me.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; You may not be the one who stands up.
[1:15:28] You may not be the one who declares it
[1:15:29] over a PA system somewhere, but every
[1:15:31] time you walk down the road in obedience
[1:15:33] to the headship of the word, you're
[1:15:35] speaking. Amen. It's a voice of God that
[1:15:38] thunders against the devil because this
[1:15:40] revelation is in her alone.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; She's living the word. She's manifesting
[1:15:47] the word. She knows the word and she
[1:15:49] knows what he wants done with it. And
[1:15:52] there's
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; there's no other voice.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; We've come to the hour
[1:16:00] where the voice is in the bride.
[1:16:03] those who surrender to the word, those
[1:16:05] who have predestinated that position and
[1:16:08] who've come to a full surrender. That's
[1:16:11] where his voice is.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; And I want his voice to ring clear
[1:16:15] through me.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; If there's going to be one voice and
[1:16:19] Elijah was one voice and Jesus was one
[1:16:21] voice and this bride will be one voice,
[1:16:24] I want that voice to give a clear tone.
[1:16:26] I want it to ring out the life of Christ
[1:16:28] only. The word and the word only. I
[1:16:31] don't want it to ring out the word mixed
[1:16:32] with some other things. I don't want it
[1:16:34] to be mixed with my temper, mixed with
[1:16:36] my pride and mixed with my prejudice. I
[1:16:38] want it to be the word and the word only
[1:16:40] because it's coming down to where that's
[1:16:42] the only place that the word abides and
[1:16:44] that's the only place the voice remains.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; That's the mount to me friends that's
[1:16:51] the Mount Zion showdown.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; It's between Jesus Christ and the
[1:16:55] denominations and creeds. Everyone
[1:16:58] claims to be a church and claims to be a
[1:16:59] bride and claims to be a woman. But
[1:17:01] there's one that's been united through
[1:17:03] an invisible union
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; with Jesus Christ and his life in her.
[1:17:08] And she has the voice. She has the word.
[1:17:10] And I want that word to live in me.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand together. We're
[1:17:16] going to stop there for today and not go
[1:17:18] any further.
[1:17:22] Oh friends, we can we can say a lot of
[1:17:25] things and we can speak a lot of things
[1:17:27] and we can claim a lot of things, but I
[1:17:30] don't want to be in the business of
[1:17:31] claiming. I don't want to be in the
[1:17:32] business of speaking. I want to be in
[1:17:34] the business of manifesting.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Talk is cheap. Amen. Anybody can say
[1:17:39] anything and anybody can repeat like a
[1:17:41] parrot and anybody can read stuff or
[1:17:43] hear stuff preach and go off and say all
[1:17:44] kinds of stuff. I don't want to be in
[1:17:46] that business. I don't want to be a
[1:17:48] self-proclaiming bride member. that the
[1:17:50] only time somebody knows that I'm part
[1:17:51] of the bride is when I say I'm part of
[1:17:53] the bride. But I want them to know by
[1:17:55] the life that I live. I want it to be
[1:17:57] demonstrated by the word of God that
[1:17:58] I've surrendered to living through me
[1:18:00] that I'm subject to the headship and
[1:18:03] only the headship of Christ. And that
[1:18:05] word is the only thing that's going to
[1:18:06] have preeminence in my life.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; That's what I want. I want the life to
[1:18:12] go. Somebody may not be able to put the
[1:18:14] right terms to it or understand how to
[1:18:15] say it, but I want the life of Christ to
[1:18:17] live through me. There is somebody says
[1:18:19] there's something different about that
[1:18:21] person right there. What they got is
[1:18:22] real. They might not even be able to say
[1:18:24] that's the voice of God. That's Jesus
[1:18:26] Christ and that person. But they'll say
[1:18:28] that's godly. That's Christ. That's
[1:18:30] real. That's true. That's right. That's
[1:18:33] the word.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; That's the life I want to live, friends.
[1:18:37] And I say, "God, help me. I need your
[1:18:39] help every day, every hour of every
[1:18:41] day." But oh friends, we've been given a
[1:18:43] message. The seals have been loosed.
[1:18:44] Christ has been unlocked. Amen. He's
[1:18:46] come back, amen, to abide in a people.
[1:18:49] He He wants to rest in you.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; And I want him to rest in me.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And I want the showdown to go right
[1:18:58] here.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Not my brain, not my strength, not my
[1:19:02] not my works, but I want it to be the
[1:19:04] showdown between Jesus Christ and the
[1:19:06] denomination. But you can use this
[1:19:09] figure right here for the showdown.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Your life on display in me. your word
[1:19:15] manifest in me.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; I don't want the showdown to be Chad
[1:19:19] Lamb versus the Baptist.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Listen, forget it, friends.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be on my understanding
[1:19:26] versus your understanding. That's not
[1:19:28] the showdown we're looking for. We're
[1:19:29] not looking for debate. We're not
[1:19:30] looking for doctrinal Amen. doctrinal
[1:19:33] clarity in a debate field. We're not
[1:19:35] looking for that kind of showdown. The
[1:19:37] showdown is there's one place that
[1:19:39] Christ is abiding and his word has come
[1:19:41] back to unite with the people and he's
[1:19:43] in his body and the headship's in the
[1:19:45] body and it's manifesting his life
[1:19:47] through her.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; That's got to be for real.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; That's what I want with all my heart.
[1:19:57] That's what I believe I'm predestinated
[1:19:59] to.
[1:20:00] I can say like we've heard said so many
[1:20:03] times,
[1:20:04] I'm not what I want to be.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not even what I ought to be. But I
[1:20:10] thank God I'm not what I used to be.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; As God continually reminds us of the
[1:20:15] word and keeps rubbing the eyes out in
[1:20:17] our eyes and we see his plan more
[1:20:19] clearly all the time. It becomes the
[1:20:21] only thing that matters in our lives.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; The only thing that be I mean there's
[1:20:27] still life to live. There's still
[1:20:28] family. There's still children. There's
[1:20:30] still things that we have to accomplish.
[1:20:31] That's part of what God wants to do. He
[1:20:33] wants to live in you and I wherever we
[1:20:35] work, wherever we abide because part of
[1:20:37] our duty is to manifest Christ to this
[1:20:39] neighborhood in this place where we work
[1:20:40] and where we live.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; But listen friends, I don't want to be
[1:20:43] distracted by where he wants me to live
[1:20:45] and what he wants me to do. I want to
[1:20:47] keep my eyes fixed on the purpose. And
[1:20:48] his purpose is to express himself
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; to have preeminence in a people. And I
[1:20:54] want him to have preeminence in this
[1:20:55] person right here.
[1:20:57] I can't force it on anybody else. I
[1:20:59] can't make him have preeminence there
[1:21:01] and there, and I can't make anybody else
[1:21:02] surrender. I've got a full-time job
[1:21:05] keeping this flesh of mine under wraps.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; But oh, God,
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; I don't want to walk around with with
[1:21:13] with a bride label and somebody say,
[1:21:16] "Oh, you're part." No, I want the the
[1:21:17] bride label to be my life, my words that
[1:21:20] are seasoned by Christ, my actions that
[1:21:22] manifest his word.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Let that be my declaration. Let be my
[1:21:27] label. Let that be the thunder that
[1:21:29] shakes the devil. Let that be the
[1:21:31] showdown between Jesus Christ and the
[1:21:33] denominations.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; God, manifest yourself in us.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Help us to not just talk about this
[1:21:43] message. Help us to be the message
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; to live the life to manifest the life to
[1:21:50] to obey every word out of a loving heart
[1:21:55] out of love for Christ to surrender
[1:21:57] ourselves more and more to love to to do
[1:22:00] all that he did. Let let it be done in
[1:22:04] us. You feel the same way.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; You want it to be in you. I I look in
[1:22:10] the mirror the same way you look in the
[1:22:11] mirror and I see faults the same way you
[1:22:13] see faults and I know my mistakes the
[1:22:15] same way you know your mistakes and we
[1:22:17] look and we say like like if that's the
[1:22:20] if that's the showdown if that's where
[1:22:21] it at listen I'm falling short but you I
[1:22:24] and everybody else is falling short but
[1:22:26] this prophecy will never fall short
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; stop looking at hybridization and look
[1:22:31] at the promise stop looking at how far
[1:22:33] away you are and start looking how close
[1:22:35] you are closer than you've ever been
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; with a greater revelation than you've
[1:22:39] ever had with a desire in your heart
[1:22:40] that's bubbling over to serve him and
[1:22:42] him alone more than it ever has before.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; We're closer than we've ever been.
[1:22:47] Friends, keep pressing. Amen. Keep
[1:22:49] surrendering. Keep loving.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Keep opening our heart to him.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; And let him
[1:22:57] let let it be the showdown between Jesus
[1:23:01] Christ and the denominations.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; But where will the showdown take place?
[1:23:06] On Mount Zion. Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Through the bride.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together.
[1:23:12] Musicians, if you'd please come. Dear
[1:23:15] Lord Jesus, we thank you for this word.
[1:23:18] God, sometimes I know that we can't
[1:23:21] fully grasp with a mind, with a mental
[1:23:25] capacity what it is you're actually
[1:23:27] trying to do through each one of us.
[1:23:30] And God, I just pray Lord that you would
[1:23:32] drop it into our souls. That you would
[1:23:35] water it with your spirit. That you
[1:23:37] would bring it to a greater
[1:23:38] manifestation. Help that seed word grow
[1:23:42] in the good ground that you've prepared
[1:23:44] before the foundation of the world. God,
[1:23:47] prune off anything that's unlike you,
[1:23:49] Lord. Cut it away from us. Give us the
[1:23:52] strength by the indwelling of your
[1:23:54] spirit to live this word.
[1:23:57] for God. It's all come back to your
[1:23:59] word. Your word has to be manifest in
[1:24:02] flesh in the end time. And you've
[1:24:06] predestinated a body, your bride body.
[1:24:11] You've predestinated the members. You've
[1:24:12] chosen them in you before the foundation
[1:24:14] of the world. And you know who they are
[1:24:17] and where they'll stand. And you know
[1:24:18] that she's predestinated to this
[1:24:20] glorious stand. So God, by faith, we
[1:24:23] believe ourselves included in this. But
[1:24:26] oh, how we need you more than we ever
[1:24:28] needed you before.
[1:24:31] God, as we surrender ourselves aresh to
[1:24:33] you. Would you take us, Lord, and would
[1:24:35] you just burn out the dross once again?
[1:24:38] Would you clean out this house, Lord,
[1:24:40] and fill us aresh with the anointing of
[1:24:43] your spirit? May this word have room to
[1:24:46] live and flow through us because we
[1:24:49] heard your prophet say, we become the
[1:24:50] word by letting the word flow through
[1:24:52] us. God, that means we have to have a
[1:24:55] surrender. There has to be an act of our
[1:24:57] will. There has to be a desire to see
[1:25:00] you have preeminence.
[1:25:02] God, look into our hearts. Fill us
[1:25:05] aresh, Lord. Use us. Anoint us for this
[1:25:08] work.
[1:25:10] And God, God, in this in the showdown,
[1:25:14] God, may there be those who hear your
[1:25:16] voice,
[1:25:18] when they see the life manifest and hear
[1:25:20] the truth of the word, may your seed
[1:25:23] come to you, Lord.
[1:25:25] God, may our lives make a difference in
[1:25:28] this end time, man. In the showdown,
[1:25:30] just like it was on Mount Carmel, there
[1:25:32] was those who came back to you, Lord.
[1:25:35] And God, as you show yourself in this
[1:25:37] showdown, in the Mount Zion showdown,
[1:25:39] may you draw all your elect seed to
[1:25:41] yourself, Lord.
[1:25:43] Oh, we love you. We trust in you, Lord,
[1:25:46] to accomplish what you promised to
[1:25:47] accomplish in this day. May you do it in
[1:25:51] each one of us, Lord. We love you. We
[1:25:54] ask for your blessings over all that's
[1:25:56] said and done. And may it not be a
[1:25:58] sermon, but may it become a reality.
[1:26:01] May it not be words, but may it
[1:26:02] translate into manifestation because the
[1:26:05] spoken word must come into
[1:26:07] manifestation.
[1:26:09] And God, when you spoke your word, in
[1:26:10] the beginning, you said, "Let there be
[1:26:12] light." But there come a time the light
[1:26:14] had to shine.
[1:26:16] And God, you spoke through your prophet
[1:26:18] and you're speaking through your
[1:26:19] five-fold ministry that this light has
[1:26:22] to shine in bride form. But God, it's
[1:26:25] got to be more than just the word. There
[1:26:26] has to come a time then that word comes
[1:26:28] into a manifestation and the light has
[1:26:31] to shine in her.
[1:26:33] God, let that be happening now under the
[1:26:36] sounding of my voice. Let the power of
[1:26:38] this word that's been released in this
[1:26:40] hour bring the manifestation to pass.
[1:26:43] God, it's got to be you. It's got to be
[1:26:45] all you and only you as we surrender.
[1:26:50] We love you, God. We surrender to you.
[1:26:52] Do your work in us. We pray in Jesus
[1:26:55] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:27:00] Amen. God bless you all. Brother John.
[1:27:03] We're living in the evening time. The
[1:27:07] race is almost through.
[1:27:11] But God has chosen you and me. There's
[1:27:16] still a job to do.
[1:27:20] The word that's been revealed to us must
[1:27:24] be prophesied again.
[1:27:28] And the message must reach everywhere
[1:27:32] till the last soul has come in.
[1:27:41] We are the generation.
[1:27:46] We are the culmination.
[1:27:49] Final voice that the world will hear.
[1:27:54] Coming of the Lord is here.
[1:27:58] Living out the revelation.
[1:28:02] Overcoming sins temptation.
[1:28:06] Truth will go to every side and nation.
[1:28:14] We are the chosen generation,
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:22] committed to the calling.
[1:28:26] Together we stand strong.
[1:28:30] Lifting up our voices one, we sing the
[1:28:35] final song.
[1:28:38] Oh, God has chosen us to conquer in
[1:28:43] every test we face.
[1:28:47] And he has seen us through this far and
[1:28:51] will finish
[1:28:53] by his grace.
[1:29:00] We are the generation.
[1:29:04] We are the culmination.
[1:29:07] The final voice that the world will
[1:29:11] hear. The coming of the Lord is near.
[1:29:16] Living out with revelation.
[1:29:19] [Music]
[1:29:21] Overcoming sins temptation. Truth will
[1:29:25] go to every tongue and nation.
[1:29:31] [Music]
[1:29:32] We are the chosen generation.
[1:29:39] Amen.
[1:29:41] I was thinking about
[1:29:44] what we've been predestinated to.
[1:29:46] Friends,
[1:29:47] not because we willed it, not because we
[1:29:50] ourselves determined it, but because God
[1:29:52] before the foundation of the world
[1:29:54] determined it.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; And he will have it. Amen.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; That's why he's done all that he's done
[1:29:59] so far. That's why he vindicated his
[1:30:01] prophet. That's why he vindicated his
[1:30:03] word. That's why he's brought it to us
[1:30:05] the way he has.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; But I thought of brother Brandham and
[1:30:09] when I think of myself trying to imagine
[1:30:12] myself being part of this Mount Zion
[1:30:14] showdown, I I I can't imagine me in my
[1:30:17] flesh. I have to go deeper than that.
[1:30:19] Amen.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; And when I think of brother Brandham
[1:30:22] being the prophet of the age,
[1:30:24] the the seventh angel, Revelation 10:7,
[1:30:30] the place where Malachi uh 4 is going to
[1:30:32] be revealed in that vessel. When I think
[1:30:35] of him doing all of that, listen, there
[1:30:37] was no way he could do it. His pro his
[1:30:40] pastor told him, "How are you going to
[1:30:42] pray for kings and pop days to travel
[1:30:44] around the world? You with a seventh
[1:30:45] grade education." And he said, "I don't
[1:30:47] know how, but he said it." Amen.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam didn't know how he was going
[1:30:52] to do any of these things. And as things
[1:30:54] started unfolding in his life, and his
[1:30:56] own position in the scriptures became
[1:30:58] more clear to him, he had no more
[1:31:00] ability to accomplish anything than you
[1:31:03] and I do. All that he had was a
[1:31:05] predestinated seed inside and a gift and
[1:31:08] a and the Holy Ghost anointing to bring
[1:31:10] it to pass. Amen. But what he did was he
[1:31:12] kept walking in the word as God revealed
[1:31:14] it to him. And that word brought itself
[1:31:18] to pass in his life.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Don't look at yourself and don't look at
[1:31:23] what you can and can't do. Listen, none
[1:31:25] of us can do what we've been
[1:31:27] predestinated to do. Amen. But the word
[1:31:29] in us can make a way for itself.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; What do we need to do? Receive the word.
[1:31:36] Believe the word. Confess the word. Walk
[1:31:39] in the word. And the word has its own
[1:31:42] life. And the word will make a way.
[1:31:44] Amen. to manifest itself.
[1:31:47] Don't look at yourself. Look at the
[1:31:49] word. Don't look at what you can or
[1:31:51] can't. Look at him. He's the promised
[1:31:53] word of the hour. He is the bridegroom.
[1:31:56] He is the one come back to take you by
[1:31:58] the hand and lead you all the way home.
[1:32:01] Keep looking at him.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; He can do it.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; How will I this? I don't know how you
[1:32:07] will. How will I I don't know how I
[1:32:08] will. All I know is he said it and I'm
[1:32:10] going to put my hand in his and I'm
[1:32:12] going to keep walking just like that
[1:32:13] prophet did. And any obstacle that gets
[1:32:16] in the way of this word, he's going to
[1:32:18] have to somehow remove it. Give me power
[1:32:21] to overcome it. Speak through my lips to
[1:32:23] remove it. I don't know what he's going
[1:32:24] to do, but he's got to make a way for
[1:32:26] himself. Cuz this isn't me. This is him
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; in me.
[1:32:32] Oh, we've got to come to a place where
[1:32:34] our confidence in the word goes higher
[1:32:37] than our confidence in our flesh. and
[1:32:40] where we just walk by the word and let
[1:32:42] the word bring itself to pass and bring
[1:32:46] the manifestation. He'll do it, friends.
[1:32:49] He promised he would. He's not going to
[1:32:51] fail. Amen. God bless you all. Amen.
[1:32:55] Thank you for being patient with me.
[1:32:57] It's good to be back home.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; I love to be here. I love to see your
[1:33:01] faces. And I love I love the atmosphere
[1:33:04] where God is opening his word and
[1:33:06] somebody's hungry to receive it.
[1:33:09] I'm hungry for it.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; I don't want to ever lose my appetite.
[1:33:12] This is a God-given appetite. Don't take
[1:33:14] it for granted. Not everybody wants to
[1:33:16] eat this food,
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; but we want it. And I want more of it.
[1:33:20] And that's a God-given appetite. And I
[1:33:22] thank God for it.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; And I thank God for you. And I thank
[1:33:25] thank God for a place to come preach the
[1:33:27] word. Amen. And the fullness of the
[1:33:29] revelation that he's given to me and a
[1:33:31] people who want it all. All that they
[1:33:33] can get.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; And say, "God, help us with more." Amen.
[1:33:38] God bless you all as you're dismissed.
[1:33:40] Brother John, if we could sing.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; It's Jesus
[1:33:45] I really want to see.
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:33:53] Oh, it is Jesus
[1:33:56] [Music]
[1:33:57] I really
[1:34:00] want to see.
[1:34:06] And the more I see of this old world,
[1:34:13] the less it means to me.
[1:34:18] Oh, it's Jesus
[1:34:22] I really want to see.
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:29] Oh yes, it's Jesus
[1:34:33] that I really want to see.
[1:34:41] Oh yes, it's Jesus
[1:34:46] I really want to see.
[1:34:51] [Music]
[1:34:53] And the more I see of this world, the
[1:35:01] less it means to me.
[1:35:05] Oh, it's Jesus.
[1:35:09] I really
[1:35:11] want to see.
[1:35:15] And he who began a good work in you,
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:25] oh he
[1:35:30] began a good work in you.
[1:35:37] He'll be faithful to complete it.
[1:35:43] He'll be faithful to complete it.
[1:35:49] He who started the work will be faithful
[1:35:54] to complete it in you.
[1:35:59] And he
[1:36:02] who
[1:36:04] began a good work in me.
[1:36:11] Oh, he
[1:36:15] began a good work in me.
[1:36:22] He'll be faithful to complete it.
[1:36:28] He'll be faithful to complete it.
[1:36:33] He who started the work will be faithful
[1:36:38] to complete it in me.
[1:36:43] Oh, and he who began a good work in me.
[1:36:52] [Music]
[1:36:54] Oh, he who began a good work in me.
[1:37:05] He'll be faithful to complete it.
[1:37:11] He'll be faithful to complete it.
[1:37:16] He who started the work will be faithful
[1:37:21] to complete it in me.
[1:37:26] And I was born
[1:37:29] to be
[1:37:32] a dwelling
[1:37:35] place,
[1:37:38] a home for the presence
[1:37:43] of the Lord.
[1:37:49] Let my life
[1:37:52] now be
[1:37:55] separated
[1:37:57] unto thee
[1:38:00] that I might be
[1:38:03] what I was born
[1:38:07] to be.
[1:38:11] For I was born
[1:38:15] to be
[1:38:18] a dwelling
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:21] place,
[1:38:23] a home for the presence
[1:38:28] of the Lord.
[1:38:34] Let my life
[1:38:37] now be
[1:38:40] separated
[1:38:42] unto thee
[1:38:46] that I might be
[1:38:48] what I was born
[1:38:52] to be.
[1:38:56] and I will serve thee
[1:39:02] because I love thee.
[1:39:07] For you have given
[1:39:12] life to me
[1:39:18] and I was not
[1:39:23] before you found me.
[1:39:28] For you have given
[1:39:32] life to me.
[1:39:38] Oh, there was heartache
[1:39:43] and broken pieces.
[1:39:48] This ruined life.
[1:39:52] It's why you died on Calary.
[1:40:00] But your touch
[1:40:03] is what I long for.
[1:40:08] Oh, you have given
[1:40:12] given life to me. Oh, I will serve thee.
[1:40:19] I will serve thee
[1:40:24] because I love thee.
[1:40:28] For you have given
[1:40:33] life to me
[1:40:38] and I was nothing
[1:40:41] [Music]
[1:40:44] before you found me.
[1:40:49] But you have given
[1:40:53] life to me.
[1:40:59] Oh, it was heartache
[1:41:03] and broken pieces
[1:41:06] [Music]
[1:41:09] through life.
[1:41:12] Oh, one
[1:41:15] died on Calary.
[1:41:19] Your God
[1:41:22] is what I long for. Oh,
[1:41:28] you have given
[1:41:31] life to me.
