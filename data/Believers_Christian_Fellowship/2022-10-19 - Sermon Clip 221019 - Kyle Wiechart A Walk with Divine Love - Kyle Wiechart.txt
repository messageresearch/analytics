========================================

and if I am Cast Away at that day I cannot see where I would be but if I knew that I was wrong and God had chose me to be wrong I would not I would want to stay wrong and because that I want to do his will it's it's I love him till I want his will to be done now that's a big statement but I hope you get it in the way and in the spirit in which it said see I want to do his will I ask him sometimes for things and he shakes his head no I just Rejoice just as much about that as when he says yes because we always ought to ask thy will be done his nose are just as good that's his will that's right it's a whole lot better than this yes is if it's not that's when you really love him whoa when his nose are as good as his yes it's because you know you're in his will even if he desires me to be a vessel of Destruction I won't change my position I want his will this to me is a different kind of a love that's a different kind of a love this is a love that is not serving God for any reward or any satisfaction it is a love that truly just wants whatever he wants this is a love that I believe we are coming to I honestly believe with all my heart I look where I've come from and I'm still not where I'm not there yet and I'm not I I want to be there see he knows the desire in my heart I want to get to the point where I can say Lord if it's a yes wonderful if it's a no wonderful Lord it does not matter anymore at all whatever you want Lord I'm ready to do it that's where we want to be that's that's I think a bride that finds her identity only in her husband only in her mate his will is my desire that's it and so that's a big statement but you know when brother Branham said about Moses he said it always stumbled me Moses how he could say Lord blot my name out of your book but don't forsake your people for they'll say of you you could bring them out but not take them in he said for your for your sake for your namesake don't do it he said I always wondered how could he say that he said it was Christ in Moses saying that and then you get to looking at brother Brandon and say how can a man say that but then you realize it's Christ in brother Branham saying that and then you wonder I say and this flesh I can't say that but Christ in me can say that I this flesh can't do it but he and me can do it because that's his will and I want his will so God get me there just keep breaking me down keep cutting me to shreds keep cutting away everything that's not like that until it comes into view
