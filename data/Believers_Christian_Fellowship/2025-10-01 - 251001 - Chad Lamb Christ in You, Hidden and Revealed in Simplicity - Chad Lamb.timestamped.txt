[0:00] There is within my heart a meloy
[0:05] that Jesus whispers sweet and low.
[0:11] Oh, fear not. I am with thee. Please

[0:42] Oh, all my life was wrecked by sin and
[0:46] strife. and discord filled my heart with
[0:50] pain.
[0:53] But Jesus swept across those broken
[0:57] strings and stirred the slumbering cords
[1:00] again.
[1:03] Oh Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
[1:08] sweetest name I know.
[1:13] He fills my every calling.
[1:18] Oh, keeps me singing as I go.
[1:23] And I'm feasting on the riches of his
[1:27] grace. Resting the sheltering wing.
[1:34] Oh, always looking on his smiling face.
[1:39] Oh, that is why I shout and sing.
[1:44] It's Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[1:49] Sweetest name I know.
[1:53] [Music]

[1:59] and keeps me singing as I go.
[2:04] And though sometimes he leads through
[2:07] waters deep, trials all across the way.

[2:18] and steep. See his footprints all the
[2:22] way.
[2:24] It's Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.

[4:36] camp. There's a river that is flowing.
[4:39] Amen. Don't want you to forget it too
[4:41] soon, so we got to sing it a few times
[4:42] so you remember it. There is a river
[4:46] that is flowing.
[4:50] proceeding out of the throne of God.
[4:56] With plenty water to drink, plenty water
[5:00] to swim, there is a river that is
[5:03] flowing.
[5:06] And when you're planted by the river,
[5:12] then your leaves will not wither.

[5:21] Lord day and night. There is a river
[5:24] that is flowing.

[5:38] With plenty water to drink, plenty water
[5:42] to swim. There is a river that is
[5:45] flowing.
[5:48] And if you thirst or you hunger,
[5:54] then won't you come to this river?
[5:59] There is an endless supply of the water
[6:03] of life. There is a river that is
[6:06] flowing.
[6:09] There is a river that is flowing.
[6:14] proceeding out of the throne of God
[6:19] with plenty water to drink, plenty water
[6:24] to swim. There is a river that is
[6:27] flowing.
[6:30] Amen. I know some of you looked at me
[6:32] like I was funny, like we sang that at
[6:34] camp. That just tells us you weren't
[6:35] there at the first service.
[6:38] Praise the Lord. I am blessed. I am
[6:41] blessed.
[6:43] I am blessed.
[6:46] Oh, every day that I live, I am blessed.

[7:13] When I wake up in the morning, till I
[7:17] lay my head to rest, I am blessed.
[7:21] Oh, I am blessed.
[7:24] And through the sunshine and rain, even
[7:27] sorrow and pain, Jesus still is my
[7:31] comfort and guide.
[7:34] His love it comforts me and his grace
[7:38] sets me free. And someday I shall stand
[7:42] by his side.
[7:45] Oh, I am blessed.

[8:20] the light, arise,

[8:26] grace. It's by grace. It's by grace.
[8:30] And if you're struggling in confusion,
[8:33] wondering why heart seems low, take your
[8:37] hands off this old world, let it go.
[8:41] Oh, let it go. Let it be. It's not
[8:45] reality,
[8:47] but a shadow of a shadow of a shadow.

[8:55] father living here below. for you're not
[8:59] this old world. So let it go.

[9:16] way that you may rest and know that
[9:19] you're not of this old world. Let it go.
[9:24] Oh, let it go. Let it be.
[9:27] It's not reality,
[9:29] but a shadow of a shadow of a shadow.
[9:35] Walk like sons and daughters of your
[9:37] father living here below. For you're not
[9:41] this old world. So let it go.
[9:45] Oh, let it go. Let it be. It's not
[9:49] reality,
[9:50] but a shadow of a shadow of a shadow.
[9:56] Walk like sons and daughters out of your
[9:58] father living here below. For you're not
[10:02] this old world. So let it go.
[10:06] Amen. You can be seated if you'd like.
[10:08] Take my life and let it be
[10:15] consecrated

[16:20] you all this evening. It's good to be

[16:25] bow our heads together.
[16:27] Dear heavenly father, we thank you, Lord
[16:29] Jesus, for this privilege of gathering
[16:31] together again. And God, we thank you
[16:34] for all that you've done for us over the
[16:35] weekend and for the blessings that you
[16:38] provided. And Lord, we're so thankful to
[16:40] be back together again in this place
[16:42] that's been given to us so graciously by
[16:45] your love, by your mercy. And that we've
[16:48] consecrated and set aside, Lord, for
[16:51] this purpose to gather together, to
[16:53] fellowship together around your word, to
[16:55] sing your praises, to bring glory to
[16:57] your name. And God, we just pray that
[17:00] you would come now, Lord, and break the
[17:01] bread of life with your own hands. May
[17:04] you use this vessel for that purpose
[17:05] that I'm yielding to you now. May you
[17:08] give us all ears to hear and eyes to see
[17:10] and a heart to perceive all that you
[17:12] have for us. And Lord, we ask that you
[17:14] would take your place, Lord, as the
[17:16] preeminent one among us this evening,
[17:18] and that you would share more of
[17:19] yourself with us as we feast on you. We
[17:22] ask for these things in Jesus Christ's
[17:24] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. We're
[17:28] going to let you have your seats for
[17:29] just a moment. Thank you, musicians. God
[17:31] bless you.
[17:33] Amen. I've got an announcement.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if somebody could bring up the
[17:38] PowerPoint for me. Amen. Brother Adam
[17:41] and Sister Alana had their little baby,
[17:43] little Andrew James Preston. So, while
[17:45] we were finishing up camp and heading
[17:47] home, they were having a baby. Amen. So,
[17:50] he was born just before 6:00 p.m. He was
[17:52] a goodsized boy. Amen. And so, we're so
[17:55] happy for them. And we just want to give
[17:57] God praise and we just want to thank God
[17:59] for them.
[18:02] Amen.
[18:04] And you know, she was in labor a long
[18:05] time. They asked for prayer and they end
[18:07] up having to take the baby by ceerian,
[18:09] but the baby mom and baby are doing
[18:11] really well and they're already back
[18:13] home. So, they're very grateful for
[18:14] everybody's prayers and they just
[18:16] appreciate so much what God has given to
[18:19] them and they're tired. So, just pray
[18:21] for them that God will give them their
[18:23] strength back. Amen.
[18:26] Amen. I just wanted to show a couple
[18:27] pictures to you. Amen. I I I gathered a
[18:30] few pictures and just wanted to recap
[18:32] camp. I I hate to leave retreat and
[18:34] leave it behind so fast. You know, I
[18:37] feel like we gained so many things. We
[18:38] had such a blessed time. I just want to
[18:40] share a couple pictures and share those
[18:42] with some of you who weren't able to be
[18:43] there. Amen. But we had uh Brother
[18:46] Daniel and Sister Cheryl White and the
[18:48] cardboard family that the Brooks family
[18:50] helped put together for us. So, they got
[18:52] a photo together. Amen. They all look
[18:54] good together. Amen. So, they just left
[18:56] this afternoon. We we drove them down to
[18:59] um uh Columbus. They flew out this
[19:02] evening. They're on the plane now
[19:03] heading to San Francisco from San
[19:05] Francisco to to uh Australia. So, just
[19:08] keep them in prayer. Amen. As they'll
[19:10] land tomorrow, you know, because they're
[19:12] crossing the the international date and
[19:14] timeline, they jump forward 12 hours
[19:17] right there in the middle of the
[19:18] Pacific. So, they leave Wednesday and
[19:20] they get home Friday. And so, that's a
[19:22] pretty long journey. Amen. So just pray
[19:24] for them. We were so grateful to have
[19:26] him. It was such a blessing to have them
[19:28] with us. And the things that the Lord
[19:30] ministered through our brother was so
[19:32] precious and such a blessing to us.
[19:35] Amen. We had some of the kids
[19:37] activities. I didn't get around to see
[19:38] it. So I very much appreciated seeing
[19:40] these pictures and and it looked like
[19:42] the kids had a wonderful time and I
[19:44] heard from them and they all confirmed
[19:46] that to me they had a wonderful time and
[19:48] we had a wonderful skit and we
[19:49] appreciate the youth who jumped in to
[19:51] help that. And look at these attentive
[19:54] kids. They They liked it. Amen.
[19:57] And here's the staff. They They all look
[20:00] good. There's something about this
[20:02] picture that just brings joy to my
[20:04] heart. When I see how much fathers love
[20:07] their children, it just does something
[20:08] for me. So, God bless you, dads. Amen.
[20:12] Just a few more pictures from around and
[20:14] about. It's just so nice. We had such
[20:16] beautiful weather, such beautiful
[20:17] grounds, such good time together. We had
[20:21] these times of the sessions and the the
[20:24] beautiful grounds.
[20:26] This is something I did not participate
[20:28] in, but God bless the guys who did. And
[20:32] brother Tom
[20:34] and this and and and all of everybody
[20:36] gathered around watching pickle ball.
[20:37] This is one that I loved. Everybody sat
[20:39] around and just fellowshipped together
[20:41] and sat in the shade trees or in the
[20:43] sun. If you wanted shade or sun, you can
[20:45] move to shade or sun, but it was so
[20:47] nice. And then this is the capping off
[20:49] picture. It was just beautiful to end
[20:51] every day together around the bonfire
[20:54] worshiping the Lord together, hearing
[20:56] some good testimonies and and so I just
[20:58] wanted to show just a couple of pictures
[21:00] and say God's been good to us.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Been so thankful that we were able to go
[21:06] that we have a place to go to like that.
[21:08] That God allows us the time that we
[21:10] could set aside and go draw closer to
[21:13] one another, draw closer to the Lord and
[21:15] learn some things together. And I, you
[21:17] know, if my body would hold up, I would
[21:19] just live there. You know, I would just
[21:20] do that day and night. But we need a
[21:23] little bit of rest. Amen. But I we're
[21:25] still feeling it. But I don't know if
[21:27] you're still feeling it, but I'm still
[21:28] feeling it a little bit. But I'm just
[21:30] thankful to God. Amen. Let's all stand
[21:32] together.
[21:35] Amen. Just wanted to remind you that the
[21:37] wedding's coming up this Saturday. So,
[21:39] we have backtoback weekends that are
[21:41] going to be full and fun. So, Brother
[21:43] Sam Bartum and Sister Emily's wedding
[21:45] will be this Saturday. So, we'll see
[21:46] many of you back over in Indiana for
[21:48] that. And so, that that'll be really
[21:50] nice. So, just keep them in prayer. They
[21:52] got a last a lot of last minute things
[21:54] to put together to make that happen.
[21:56] But, we're very much looking forward to
[21:57] seeing those two married. And also want
[22:00] to welcome the Abbotts. God bless you.
[22:02] We welcome them over at retreat. They
[22:03] popped in for Sunday, but it's good to
[22:05] have them here. So, they'll be here for
[22:06] a couple weeks yet. So, we'll get a
[22:08] chance to visit with them. Also, I
[22:11] wanted to let you know that next week,
[22:13] I'll be going to Edmonton for uh some
[22:16] meetings Brother Eugene Brown's putting
[22:18] on. So, I'll actually be leaving
[22:20] Wednesday morning, next Wednesday, the
[22:22] 8th, and going up and I'll be taking a
[22:24] Wednesday evening service for brother Ed
[22:26] Hammermeister. So, I'll take that
[22:28] service for him. And then I'll be
[22:30] staying for the weekend, Friday,
[22:32] Saturday, and Sunday with brother
[22:34] Eugene. He's having special meetings.
[22:36] So, I really would appreciate you
[22:37] praying for me for that trip. And I have
[22:40] talked my son David into going with me.
[22:42] So I wanted to take him on a trip. He he
[22:44] graduates school here in November and
[22:47] before he gets too tied up with a
[22:48] career. I wanted him to go somewhere
[22:50] with me. And he refused to go to a third
[22:52] world country.
[22:55] I I told him all the life experiences he
[22:57] can have and the things he can gain and
[23:00] he said no way. But then this trip
[23:03] popped up and I asked him and and he
[23:05] agreed. So just just pray that the the
[23:07] overseas trip is not too hard for him in
[23:11] Canada. And so
[23:13] so I mean he actually had to get a
[23:15] passport. So I guess this is a big deal.
[23:18] So but I'm glad to get to spend the time
[23:20] with him and that he can take a trip
[23:22] with me before he moves on into a career
[23:24] and other things in life. So just pray
[23:26] for us. While I'm away, Brother Simon
[23:28] Abbott's agreed to take that first
[23:30] Wednesday. So we're glad he popped in
[23:31] and can take that Wednesday. and brother
[23:33] Gabe Smith is going to preach the Sunday
[23:35] service and then we'll be back here on
[23:38] Tuesday and I plan to take the Wednesday
[23:39] service. So if you could just keep us in
[23:41] prayer, we would greatly appreciate it
[23:43] and just ask that God would have his way
[23:46] in those meetings. So I I always get to
[23:50] this place where I come to a spot like
[23:52] this where we just come off a weekend
[23:55] retreat, work together, and we're going
[23:58] into another meeting next week and I
[24:00] say, "Why did I say yes to this?
[24:03] It seems like too much, but I believe
[24:05] the footsteps of the righteous are order
[24:06] of the Lord, and I've never seen God
[24:08] fail to do something. So, I'm just going
[24:10] forward trusting that God will move. So,
[24:13] God bless you all. Does it feel good to
[24:15] be home
[24:17] &gt;&gt; back in the sanctuary? We've got so many
[24:19] wonderful memories in here and so many
[24:20] things God's done for us and it just
[24:22] feels good to be together. Amen. While
[24:25] you're standing, if we could just take
[24:26] our Bibles and turn to Colossians,
[24:29] Colossians chapter 1.
[24:34] I want to read from two scriptures while
[24:35] we're standing. Colossians chapter 1
[24:43] and verse 26.
[24:48] Colossians 1 and 26 says, "Even the
[24:52] mystery which has been hid from ages and
[24:54] from generations, but now is made
[24:56] manifest to his saints, to whom God
[24:59] would make known what is the riches of
[25:00] the glory of this mystery among the
[25:02] Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the
[25:05] hope of glory." Now, if we could go from
[25:07] there to Matthew chapter 11,
[25:16] Matthew chap 11
[25:21] and verse 25. Matthew 11
[25:25] and verse 25.
[25:29] At that time Jesus answered and said,"I
[25:32] thank thee, oh Father, Lord of heaven
[25:33] and earth, because thou hast hid these
[25:36] things from the wise and prudent, and
[25:38] has revealed them unto babes. Even so,
[25:41] Father, for so it seemed good in thy
[25:44] sight." Amen. God bless you as you have
[25:46] your seats. Amen. And we just ask the
[25:49] Lord to bless us as we look into his
[25:50] word and give us the spirit of
[25:53] understanding and the spirit of
[25:54] revelation and knowledge in these
[25:56] things. Amen. I I wanted to uh take this
[26:00] service and as we moved into this
[26:02] service after the retreat coming back
[26:04] together again, there was so many things
[26:07] that that uh opened up to me on a whole
[26:10] another level during the during the the
[26:12] preaching of the services, the time that
[26:14] we had together and uh uh through
[26:17] brother Daniel's ministry that I I don't
[26:19] want to just brush past that. I want to
[26:21] I want to uh gather it together and talk
[26:24] about it some more. And so I'm going to
[26:26] do that to today. uh there's no way we
[26:28] can repreach everything, you know,
[26:30] there's no way you can go over. There
[26:31] was so much gain, but there was so many
[26:34] so many things that just became more
[26:36] alive. Amen. And they weren't brand new
[26:38] things. We understand a lot of those
[26:39] things. Some things were open up in a
[26:41] brand new way to me. But I wanted to go
[26:43] back and and keep gleaning off what God
[26:46] has given to us because that was a
[26:47] special time. And that special time
[26:49] brings a special purpose. And when the
[26:51] word opens to another level, I want to I
[26:54] want to I want to take advantage of it
[26:55] and I want to feed on it. So, if we
[26:58] could bring up the PowerPoint,
[27:00] uh I want to talk about Christ in you
[27:03] hidden and revealed in simplicity. So,
[27:06] I'm going to take these two subjects and
[27:07] and and put them together. Christ in you
[27:10] hidden and revealed in simplicity. When
[27:13] brother Benham comes to preach um uh God
[27:16] in simplicity before the seals, he
[27:18] comes, this is one of his opening
[27:20] scriptures here in Matthew that I thank
[27:22] thee f uh oh father lord of heaven and
[27:25] earth because thou has hid these things
[27:27] from the wise and prudent and has
[27:28] revealed them unto babes. Amen. So he's
[27:32] saying the wise and the prudent didn't
[27:35] catch these things but it was going to
[27:36] take revelation and the revelation came
[27:39] to babes. And this is one of the
[27:40] scriptures he's referring to and God
[27:43] hiding himself in simplicity and
[27:44] revealing himself in the same. And so we
[27:48] know one of the great the one of the
[27:50] great themes of this end time is Christ
[27:52] in you. But is Christ in you hidden and
[27:55] revealed in simplicity? So we want to
[27:58] look at this together as we move
[28:00] forward.
[28:03] Let's look at this quote together.
[28:06] This is this is the message we've been
[28:08] referring to. Now, from this text or
[28:10] from this scripture reading, I draw this
[28:12] text, God hiding himself in simplicity,
[28:14] then revealing himself in the same. Now,
[28:17] for the tapes, I keep repeating it uh
[28:20] because they're taping. God hiding
[28:22] himself in simplicity, then revealing
[28:24] himself in the same. So, not only does
[28:27] God hide himself in simplicity, he
[28:29] reveals himself in simplicity.
[28:32] It's strange to think how that God does
[28:34] such a thing as that. God will hide
[28:36] himself in something so simple that'll
[28:39] cause the wise to miss it a million
[28:41] miles and then turn right back around in
[28:43] that some simple thing in the in the
[28:47] simplicity of his way of working and
[28:48] reveal himself right out again.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; Says I thought it made a text that might
[28:54] that we might study this before we go
[28:56] into the great teachings of the seven
[28:58] seals. Now, black screen.
[29:02] Brother Bram said, "I'm teaching this
[29:04] before we go into the great teaching of
[29:05] the seven seals." And and he teaches on
[29:08] on this subject. Then when he gets to
[29:10] the seventh seal and he's starting to to
[29:13] get excited about the seventh seal and
[29:14] he goes to so far and then he goes to
[29:17] shut it down, then he says, "How did I
[29:19] know a week ago Sunday?" What's he
[29:22] talking about? God hiding himself in
[29:23] simplicity. How did I know when I said
[29:25] be simple? It'll be so simple. Be real
[29:27] simple. How did I know it'd be a thing
[29:29] like that? So, Brother Brandham now, you
[29:31] know, he's just walking as the Lord
[29:33] leads. He doesn't know uh what's going
[29:35] to happen uh uh uh you know, 10 services
[29:38] later, uh 8 days later when he gets to
[29:41] that next Sunday, he doesn't know what's
[29:42] going to happen. He's just moving as God
[29:44] leads. And he's coming with the subject
[29:46] of God hiding himself in simplicity and
[29:48] revealing himself in the same before the
[29:51] seals. And then at the opening of the
[29:52] seals, he comes to the seventh seal and
[29:54] he says, "I didn't even know what I was
[29:56] talking about back then, but that's it.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; That's the thing. It was simple. It's
[30:01] hidden in simplicity. It's revealed in
[30:03] simplicity."
[30:05] And he says, "Many miss him by the way
[30:07] he reveals himself." Now, man has their
[30:10] own ideas of what God ought to be and
[30:12] what God is going to do. And as I have
[30:15] made the old statement many times that
[30:17] man still remains man. Man is always
[30:19] giving God praise for what he did did do
[30:23] and always looking forward to what he
[30:24] will do and ignoring what he's doing.
[30:28] That's the way they miss it. They look
[30:30] back and see what a great thing he done,
[30:32] but they fail to see what a simple thing
[30:34] he used to do it with. So they look back
[30:37] and they see tremendous moves of God and
[30:41] supernatural things that God did and
[30:43] they they see the the manifestation of
[30:46] supernatural but they forget what simple
[30:49] things he used for that manifestation.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; He just used men. He just used common
[30:54] men. He used Amos. Amos says, "I'm not a
[30:57] prophet or the son of the prophet, but
[30:59] when the lion is rewarded, who can keep
[31:00] silent?" And God brought him out as a
[31:02] herdsman and sent him out with a
[31:04] message. And he was as simple as simple
[31:06] can be. But he but but he had a mighty
[31:08] message.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; And so man is looking back and they see
[31:11] what great things God done. And when
[31:13] they see great big things that God done,
[31:16] when they look forward and they see that
[31:17] God's going to do amazing things and
[31:19] they think they're looking for something
[31:21] great to to accomplish the great, but
[31:23] God doesn't use great to accomplish the
[31:25] great. God uses the simple to accomplish
[31:28] the great.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; And that's always been the challenge.
[31:33] Amen.
[31:35] Uh let's look here at John 10. He says,
[31:38] "The Jews answered him, saying, for a
[31:40] good work we stone thee not, but for
[31:43] blasphemy and because that thou being a
[31:45] man makest thyself God." Well, he was
[31:48] asking, "Why are you going to stone me?
[31:50] I mean, what evil works have I done?"
[31:53] And they said, "For a good work we stone
[31:55] thee not, but because you being a man
[31:59] maketh yourself God."
[32:02] that all they could see was a man.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; They couldn't see God
[32:07] &gt;&gt; because God was using something that was
[32:09] so simple to them. Because you you if we
[32:12] could just if we could just teleport
[32:14] ourselves back, Amen. go back 2,000
[32:18] years and we could be standing on the
[32:20] streets of Judea and there and we could
[32:22] have people passing back and forth and
[32:24] you could go not to when Jesus was in
[32:26] his ministry and doing healing, but go
[32:28] back to when Jesus was a 10-year-old boy
[32:30] running up and down the street. Amen.
[32:33] You he would have passed by you and you
[32:35] would not have known that that was the
[32:36] son of God.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; He would have been boy like any other
[32:40] boy. He had dust on his feet and his
[32:42] clothes might have been a bit dirty.
[32:44] Amen. You know, Jesus, he he didn't
[32:47] hover around over the ground all of his
[32:49] life as an angelic being. He lived a
[32:51] human life. He got hungry. He ate. He
[32:54] got tired. He slept. He took baths. He
[32:56] got dirty. He
[32:58] &gt;&gt; And you wouldn't have known. And he
[33:00] would have been he would have been the
[33:02] he would have been I hate to say this
[33:04] about the Lord, but it's true. He would
[33:06] have been just as simple as any other
[33:07] 10year-old boy.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Then he was growing into manhood. And
[33:11] this is why when they saw him looking
[33:14] like everybody else, he didn't have a
[33:16] constant glow about his face. He didn't
[33:18] have a halo that followed him around. He
[33:20] looked like every other man. He wore
[33:22] common clothes like everybody else wore.
[33:24] He was about the stature of everybody
[33:26] else, about the size and shape. He was
[33:28] just an average person,
[33:32] &gt;&gt; but he wasn't an average person.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; BUT TO THE SIGHT, IT WAS SO SIMPLE. They
[33:37] couldn't believe that this was God.
[33:40] Amen.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; They just couldn't believe that this was
[33:42] God. And so when he says, "My father and
[33:45] I are one." Amen. They took up stones to
[33:48] stone him because now you're you being a
[33:50] man, make yourself God. And they
[33:52] couldn't understand the simplicity, the
[33:55] simple thing that God was the great
[33:57] thing that God was doing in a simple
[34:00] way.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; And it didn't make sense to them. And
[34:04] there's the question I have. If if they
[34:07] could misunderstand
[34:09] God in flesh and perfect virgin born
[34:13] flesh in that day, could they
[34:15] misunderstand God in flesh in this day?
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Better yet, could we misunderstand
[34:23] God in flesh
[34:25] &gt;&gt; in this day? Because it's so simple, we
[34:29] don't understand what a great thing God
[34:31] is doing in simplicity.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:36] I think if I could say this, I think
[34:39] sometimes we're all holding our breath
[34:43] waiting for God to do something great
[34:45] with us.
[34:48] And maybe every day he's doing something
[34:50] great with us.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; And we're waiting for God to do
[34:54] something great with us. But God's doing
[34:57] the thing he's wanting to do with us
[34:59] right now.
[35:02] hidden and revealed in simplicity.
[35:06] And the message is a super sign. He
[35:08] says, you see, in God's laws of
[35:09] redemption,
[35:11] as it was with Boaz and Naomi, it had to
[35:13] be a near kinsman. And the only way that
[35:15] man could be redeemed, God had to become
[35:18] a kinsman near. I want you to see it. He
[35:20] never became kinfolks altogether to the
[35:22] rich, to the mighty. But he was born in
[35:25] a stable wrapped in swaddling cloth. Not
[35:27] to the adult, but to the child. He was
[35:30] God over the creation.
[35:32] He chose to do it. Not come a full
[35:35] matured man. He come that he might
[35:37] suffer the feelings of the little
[35:38] babies. He come that he might go through
[35:40] the teenage temptations. Might go that
[35:43] he could toil the toils and the snares
[35:45] of the devil as a man and make a way for
[35:47] people of all ages and of all ages and
[35:49] of all classes. The poor, the rich, the
[35:51] all. He became poor that through his
[35:54] poverty we might become rich and hes
[35:56] with him in the kingdom. A sign would be
[35:58] given, crossing himself, making himself
[36:00] something different than what he was.
[36:02] Now a super sign, crying as a baby,
[36:05] playing as a boy, toiling as a man. But
[36:08] it was God living in all stages of life
[36:11] like we do
[36:13] &gt;&gt; in simplicity. What was the simplicity?
[36:15] He was living a human life. Amen. That
[36:18] reflected mirrored all the other human
[36:21] lives all around him. Only there was
[36:23] something behind the veil.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:29] Now in this message why it had to be
[36:31] shepherd. He says now let's close our
[36:33] eyes. Think of Jehovah. No one was
[36:35] worthy. No one could do it but him. And
[36:37] he came down. He became a little baby.
[36:40] He come a teenager. He become a
[36:42] carpenter, a working man. He become a
[36:45] lamb. He become a sacrifice. He raised
[36:47] triumphantly Jehovah.
[36:51] I think it's so amazing. God could have
[36:52] come any way he wanted. He could have
[36:54] come in any fashion and any style. Amen.
[36:57] But he come Amen. He come as a man. He
[36:59] come as a human being. And he come in
[37:02] the in the in the fullness of humanity.
[37:04] Brother Beam said he was completely man
[37:06] and completely God. And as completely
[37:09] man, he had to live as a man. And we've
[37:11] already discussed that he had to to he,
[37:14] you know, he he lived a human life and
[37:17] it became so simple. People just walked
[37:19] right past him all the time and had no
[37:21] idea this was God in flesh.
[37:24] Praise God.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Luke 3. Let's turn there together. Luke
[37:30] chapter 3.
[37:43] Luke chapter 3
[37:47] verse 10. This is John the Baptist. And
[37:51] now the people are asking him uh let's
[37:54] start at verse 9. And now also the axe
[37:57] is laid into the root of the trees.
[37:58] Every tree therefore which bringeth not
[38:00] forth good fruit is heuned down and cast
[38:02] into the fire. And the people asked him
[38:04] saying, "What shall we do then?" And
[38:07] this is John coming. He's preparing the
[38:09] way for the Lord. And he's preparing a
[38:11] people for the Lord. And and they're
[38:13] saying, you know, John, what are we
[38:15] supposed to do? So he's going to tell
[38:17] him. And he answered and said unto them,
[38:19] he that hath two coats, let him in part
[38:21] to him that hath none, and he that hath
[38:23] meat, let him do likewise. Then came
[38:25] also the publicans to be baptized, and
[38:27] said unto him, Master, what shall we do?
[38:30] And he said unto them, Exact no more
[38:32] than that which is appointed you. Verse
[38:35] 14, and the soldiers likewise demanded
[38:38] of him, saying, And what shall we do?
[38:40] And he said unto them, Do violence to no
[38:42] man, neither accuse any falsely, and be
[38:44] content with your wages. This is an
[38:47] interesting scripture and I'll tell you
[38:49] why it struck me as interesting. They
[38:50] come to John the Baptist who's preparing
[38:52] the like I said he's preparing the way
[38:54] for the Lord, making straight his path
[38:55] and he's preparing a people for the
[38:57] Lord. And in preparation they said what
[39:00] should we do? And he says be a good
[39:02] neighbor.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Be a good publican.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Be a good soldier.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; What?
[39:13] Just do what you're doing and do it
[39:16] well.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Don't stop what you're doing. Amen. Just
[39:20] if you're a soldier, be this kind of
[39:22] soldier. If you're a publican, become
[39:24] this kind of publican. Amen. If you have
[39:26] more than you need and you see someone
[39:27] without, share with them. Be a good
[39:29] neighbor. Be a good publican. Be a good,
[39:31] you know, tax collector. Be a good
[39:33] soldier. Be a good whatever you whatever
[39:36] they were in that day. Be a good
[39:37] fisherman. Be a good this. Be a good
[39:39] that. And you think the preparation
[39:40] would be no, we've got to become, you
[39:42] know, we got to become ultra super
[39:44] something. So let's all stop, join a
[39:46] commune, and become super spiritual for
[39:48] the coming of the Lord. No, just go on.
[39:51] Keep doing what you're doing. Just just
[39:53] do it righteously. Just give unto the
[39:55] Lord. Amen. Just do it well.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; That struck me as so odd when I read
[40:00] that uh yesterday. I've been reading for
[40:03] a couple days. Then I thought, my
[40:05] goodness, isn't that amazing? Let's go
[40:07] to Ephesians chapter 6.
[40:10] Can you imagine knowing that a great
[40:12] prophet is on the scene and this great
[40:15] prophet as he comes he's he's preparing
[40:17] a people for the Lord and he's telling
[40:19] you that Messiah is coming the kingdom
[40:21] is coming and they come to him and says
[40:23] what do I have to do to be prepared for
[40:25] this great Messiah for this great king
[40:27] and he says well if you're a publican
[40:28] just make sure you're honest in your
[40:29] business
[40:34] &gt;&gt; it might have been a letown for some of
[40:35] them
[40:36] &gt;&gt; I thought I would get some great other
[40:38] kind of instruction. Amen. Ephesians
[40:41] chapter 6. Now
[40:44] verse one,
[40:48] children, obey your parents in the Lord,
[40:50] for this is right. Honor thy father and
[40:53] mother, which is the first commandment
[40:54] with promise, that it may be well with
[40:56] thee, and thou mayest live long on the
[40:58] earth. And you fathers, provoke not your
[40:59] children to wrath, but bring them up in
[41:01] the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
[41:03] Servants, be obedient to them that are
[41:05] your masters according to the flesh,
[41:07] with fear and trembling, and singleness
[41:08] of heart as unto Christ. Not with eye
[41:11] service as men pleasers, but as the
[41:13] servants of Christ, doing the will of
[41:14] God from the heart, with with good will,
[41:18] doing service as to the Lord, and not to
[41:20] men, knowing that whatsoever good thing
[41:23] any man doeth, the same shall be
[41:24] received of the Lord, whether he be bond
[41:27] or free. and ye masters do the same
[41:29] things unto them forebearing threatening
[41:31] knowing that your master also is in
[41:33] heaven neither is their respect of
[41:36] persons with him. This is in the book of
[41:39] Ephesians. Paul is now giving
[41:40] instruction to the Ephesian church and
[41:43] his instruction is for them how to live
[41:46] the life on this earth and he's telling
[41:48] them be a good child, be a good father,
[41:53] &gt;&gt; be a good servant, be a good master.
[41:58] It's it's to me it's striking friends
[42:02] and I hope that as we move on that you
[42:04] can it can be imparted unto you the
[42:07] thing that's become striking unto me
[42:10] that God wants to be manifest in
[42:12] simplicity
[42:14] &gt;&gt; and the simplicity of our lives
[42:18] every day every day life. Let's turn to
[42:22] the book of Titus together.
[42:36] Titus chapter 2.
[42:41] Let's start at verse one. Titus chapter
[42:42] 2 verse one. But speak thou the things
[42:46] which become sound doctrine, that the
[42:48] aged men be sober, grave, temperate,
[42:51] sound in faith, in charity, in patience.
[42:54] The aged women likewise, that they be in
[42:57] behaviors becometh holiness, not false
[42:59] accusers, not given to much wine,
[43:01] teachers of good things, that they may
[43:04] teach the young women to be sober, to
[43:06] love their husbands, to love their
[43:08] children, to be discreet, chasteed,
[43:11] keepers at home, good, obedient to their
[43:14] own husbands, that the word of God be
[43:16] not blasphemed.
[43:20] What is the what is an important lesson
[43:22] for the younger women to learn to be in
[43:25] their spiritual position?
[43:29] Remember when brother Daniel was talking
[43:31] about the family and he had the I should
[43:32] have brought the cardboard family out.
[43:35] This would have been a great time to use
[43:36] it. I missed my chance.
[43:39] But he said, "How will the Holy Ghost
[43:42] work in the Father?" You remember this.
[43:46] The Holy Ghost will work in the father
[43:48] through the office of father.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; And the holy ghost will work in the
[43:53] mother through the office of mother. But
[43:55] the holy ghost in the mother won't take
[43:58] the office of father. And the holy ghost
[44:00] of father won't take the office of
[44:02] mother. And then the holy ghost of
[44:03] children amen won't take the headship of
[44:06] the family. The they'll the holy ghost
[44:08] in the children will administer the
[44:10] office of children in subjection to
[44:12] father.
[44:14] Got it? This is simplicity, friends.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; This is what Paul's saying. This is my
[44:20] instruction t to Titus. Titus, you're a
[44:23] leader in the church. And now, as you go
[44:25] and give instructions to the church,
[44:26] let's teach them how to live the life of
[44:29] Christ on the earth. So, as we teach
[44:30] them how to live the life of Christ on
[44:32] the earth, listen, what he was teaching
[44:34] them was so common and routine and to
[44:37] everyday life that the aged women, they
[44:40] should teach the younger women what?
[44:42] Let's go back and look. Let's go back
[44:44] and look at it again. Uh verse four.
[44:48] That they may teach the young women to
[44:49] be sober, to love their husbands, to
[44:53] love their children, to be discreet,
[44:55] chasteed, keepers at home, good obedient
[44:59] to their own husbands, that the word of
[45:01] God be not blasphemed.
[45:03] So what were they teaching them? How to
[45:06] live in their office.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Because that's what God wanted them to
[45:10] do. That was what the instructions from
[45:13] Paul through Titus to teach in the
[45:15] church is this is what I want you to
[45:17] teach. Teach them how to do how teach
[45:20] them how to do the simple things.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:24] And you think, yeah, I mean when when I
[45:27] look at it, it's almost funny when you
[45:30] when you think about it that this is
[45:32] this is actually what God wants us to
[45:34] do. He wants us to display Christ as
[45:36] fathers, as mothers, as men, as women,
[45:39] as older, as younger, as children. Amen.
[45:42] So that Christ can live in a many
[45:43] membered body.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; And sometimes I I can imagine we're
[45:48] going to John the Baptist saying, "Okay,
[45:50] Messiah's coming. The kingdom setting
[45:52] in. What do I need to do? Go back to
[45:55] work
[45:57] &gt;&gt; and put in a good day's work and be
[45:59] honest and don't defraud anybody."
[46:03] BUT YOU SAID MESSIAH'S COMING AND THE
[46:05] KINGDOM'S coming and we're supposed TO
[46:07] GET READY. WHAT DO I DO, JOHN?
[46:10] &gt;&gt; If you're a soldier, just make sure you
[46:11] do violence to no man and you don't
[46:13] defraud anybody. And
[46:17] &gt;&gt; this is preparation for Messiah, for the
[46:19] kingdom coming.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; It's too simple.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; It's much too simple. But when when when
[46:26] when brother Daniel was ministering and
[46:28] going through the the offices, all of a
[46:30] sudden it began to click inside of me
[46:32] that what God what God wants is he wants
[46:35] me to live this word where I am and who
[46:39] I am and as I am and stop looking for a
[46:43] great super duper thing to happen in the
[46:45] future that God's wanting to work right
[46:47] now, but he wants to work exactly in us
[46:50] where he's placed us. And we're always
[46:52] looking for another placing. So if I get
[46:55] to another place, I can serve God. Amen.
[46:57] And it's not about waiting for another
[46:59] place to serve God. It's about serving
[47:01] God in our place.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; And we think serving God in our place.
[47:06] Amen. It it might be, okay, if I'm a
[47:09] housewife, all right, Brother Brenham
[47:11] said, I can witness to to the to the
[47:13] milkman. Now listen, you you kids have
[47:16] no clue what witnessing to the milkman's
[47:18] all about because who's the milkman and
[47:20] how do you find the milkman? But back
[47:22] where brother M was talking, the milkman
[47:23] brought milk to your house.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Man, that would be nice. Well, I guess
[47:28] we do have a milkman now. It's Walmart
[47:30] delivery.
[47:32] We've gone full circle.
[47:36] So, if I'm going to do the work of God,
[47:38] it'll be if I testify to the milkman
[47:40] gives his heart to the Lord, that's the
[47:41] work of God. That's not the only work of
[47:43] God in your position. But to be
[47:45] discreet, to be chased, to be sober, to
[47:47] love your husband, TO LOVE YOUR
[47:48] CHILDREN, THAT'S THE WORK OF GOD. AMEN.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That we can do the work of God.
[47:56] Amen. We can do what we're instructed to
[47:58] do. WHY IS PAUL spending so much time
[48:00] and giving this instruction to Titus and
[48:02] telling Titus to give this instruction
[48:04] to the church? Is because this is
[48:05] important.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is God hiding in simplicity.
[48:11] Verse six, let's go back to Titus 2:6.
[48:16] Young men, likewise exhort to be sober
[48:18] minded in all things, showing thyself a
[48:20] pattern of good works in doctrine,
[48:22] showing unccorruptness, gravity,
[48:25] sincerity, sound speech, that cannot be
[48:28] condemned, that he that is of the
[48:30] contrary part may be ashamed, having no
[48:32] evil thing to say of you. Exhort
[48:34] servants to be obedient to their own
[48:36] masters and to please them well in all
[48:38] things, not answering again,
[48:41] not perorning, but showing all good
[48:44] fidelity that they may be that they may
[48:46] adorn the doctrine of God our savior in
[48:49] all things.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; How do I manifest the doctrine of our
[48:53] savior? By being a good employee.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 11, for the grace of God
[49:02] that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
[49:04] all men, teaching us that denying
[49:07] ungodliness and worldly lust, we should
[49:09] live soberly, righteously, and godly in
[49:11] this present world, looking for that
[49:13] blessed hope and that glorious appearing
[49:15] of that great God and our Savior Jesus
[49:17] Christ, who gave himself for us that he
[49:19] might redeem us from all iniquity and
[49:22] purify unto himself a peculiar people
[49:25] zealous of good works. Amen. This
[49:28] becomes so interesting to me as I
[49:30] watched and I meditated on what was
[49:32] preached over the weekend and found out
[49:35] that that God wants to live in us in
[49:38] whatever office he placed us. And he
[49:40] begins talking about offices as in
[49:43] father and mother and son and widow and
[49:46] single adult and and and teenager and
[49:48] whatever office and and and because God
[49:51] manifest himself in Jesus Christ in some
[49:53] of those roles as child as teenager.
[49:57] Amen. A as brother. He was he was
[50:00] manifested as a young man and he was
[50:02] manifest as a middle-aged man and he was
[50:04] manifest as a son because God was his
[50:07] father. And and he began to manifest
[50:09] some of those roles. And it was God
[50:11] living a human life as a son. God living
[50:15] a human life as a teenager. God living a
[50:18] human life. Brother said as a baby cuz
[50:20] he wanted to experience baby.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Bam says. That's
[50:24] what he tells us. And so I don't think
[50:27] every day of our life is just biting
[50:29] time waiting for something to happen. I
[50:32] think every day of our life is what he's
[50:34] wanting to have happen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; That we live according to the word. We
[50:38] live honestly. We live righteously.
[50:40] Amen. We live in obedience to God. We
[50:43] live surrendered to him. We live led by
[50:45] his spirit in everything that we do.
[50:48] Amen. Here here the Apostle Paul tells
[50:50] Titus to tell the church this. Uh uh
[50:53] let's go back and look at um verse nine.
[50:57] Exhort servants to be obedient unto
[50:59] their own masters and to please them
[51:00] well in all things, not answering again.
[51:04] He's telling the employees, don't answer
[51:06] back.
[51:08] Don't be a smart alec to your boss.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I should have read that a long
[51:14] time ago.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; It's too simple.
[51:21] It's so simple that we're we have a hard
[51:24] time getting excited about this
[51:26] preaching.
[51:28] We have a hard time clapping our hands
[51:29] and waving our arms about this. But this
[51:32] is what we need to master, friends. This
[51:35] is where we're at. This is where we've
[51:37] got to bring this flesh subject to the
[51:40] will of God every day of our lives. It's
[51:42] not It's not okay. Amen. It's not okay
[51:46] anymore to come to church and manifest
[51:48] Christ and go to work and not manifest
[51:50] Christ. That's not working. Amen. And
[51:53] now we're at work waiting to manifest
[51:54] Christ when when when somebody says
[51:56] something about a Bible verse and I can
[51:58] fix them.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; But every day in my attitude and my
[52:02] approach, I can manifest Christ.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Christ worked in a
[52:07] carpenter shop.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said he came as a working
[52:12] man.
[52:13] Praise be to God.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; In the message, Jehovah Gy said, "See,
[52:18] we have to do what we uh we have to be
[52:21] what we are. Gifts and callings are
[52:23] without repentance. When you were born
[52:24] in this world before the world ever
[52:26] began, God knew you positionally placed
[52:29] you." If that isn't so, then the Bible
[52:31] isn't so. That's exactly God put our
[52:34] names on the Lamb's Book of Life, not
[52:35] when you come to the altar, but before
[52:37] the foundation of the world. That's
[52:39] right. So, I just want to highlight this
[52:43] that God knew you when before the world
[52:46] ever began and he positionally placed
[52:48] you. So, wherever you are right now,
[52:51] you're not out of position.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Unless you're just flat refusing what
[52:55] God's led you to do. Amen. You're you're
[52:57] in a position. Who decided you would
[52:58] come male? Who decided you would come
[53:00] female? Who decided what family you
[53:02] would come in and what region of the
[53:04] world you would be placed? Who chose all
[53:06] those things? You didn't pick that. God
[53:08] picked that. And God placed you. Amen.
[53:10] And God placed you where you want
[53:12] because he wants to manifest through you
[53:13] and I wherever he's placed us
[53:17] &gt;&gt; and things that are said just like your
[53:19] birth here. I said you was prepared. God
[53:21] knew you would be here.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; This this is one of the scriptures that
[53:26] uh brother Daniel read. He just read the
[53:28] bottom half. But I'm going to go back a
[53:30] little bit further and read in Psalms
[53:32] 139:13. For thou hast possessed my
[53:34] reigns. Thou has covered me in my
[53:36] mother's womb. I I will praise thee, for
[53:38] I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[53:41] Marvelous are the works that my soul
[53:43] knoweth right well. My substance was not
[53:46] hid from thee when I was made in secret
[53:48] and curiously wrought in the lowest
[53:49] parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see
[53:52] my substance yet being unperfect, and in
[53:54] thy book all my members were written,
[53:56] when in continuence were fashioned, when
[53:59] as yet there was none of them. How
[54:01] precious are thy thoughts unto me, oh
[54:03] God. How great is the sum of them.
[54:07] God God knew where we would be and when
[54:11] we would be and how we would be.
[54:14] Remember, Brother Bam taught us clearly
[54:16] that God had a breeding program
[54:19] &gt;&gt; like a farmer.
[54:21] And God had a breeding program to get
[54:23] certain characteristics in you through
[54:25] genetics. And he saw to it that this one
[54:27] married this one and this one got to
[54:29] this one to get you just the way you
[54:31] were. And you remember he types it out
[54:32] with a a bell maker making chime. So
[54:34] much tin, so much lead, so much this.
[54:36] And it has a certain tinge. And then
[54:38] when Daniel when brother Daniel said,
[54:40] "Stop being a victim of your own
[54:42] makeup."
[54:44] &gt;&gt; We got to stop hating the way we are. I
[54:46] mean, there's and there's things about
[54:48] all of us that need to change. There's
[54:50] things about all of us, amen, that that
[54:52] we need to surrender to the Lord. But
[54:53] there's things about all of us that God
[54:56] put there.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; There's there's ingredients that God
[54:59] made sure come together, but because of
[55:01] hybridization, we picked up a few extra
[55:03] along the way. But let's let the word of
[55:05] God start cutting some of that off. And
[55:07] the spirit of God convict us on that.
[55:09] But stop being a victim of our own
[55:11] makeup because our own makeup had a lot
[55:13] to do with God's fornowledge.
[55:16] [Music]
[55:17] &gt;&gt; And God got this one with this one and
[55:19] this one with this one so that you and I
[55:21] would ting a certain way. And we got to
[55:23] stop hating the way we ting and loving
[55:25] the way everybody else tings and try to
[55:27] pretend we ting like they ting
[55:32] &gt;&gt; because no matter how much we pretend we
[55:34] ting like they ting, every time we ting,
[55:36] it's not like they ting.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; And we're only frustrating ourselves and
[55:40] everybody around us, we got to get
[55:42] comfortable with the fact that God knew
[55:43] what he was doing when he placed me in
[55:45] this age, in this body, from this
[55:47] household, and all the ingredients that
[55:49] come together, the good and the bad and
[55:50] everything together. God has me here
[55:53] because God wants to manifest himself in
[55:55] me every day of my life and I want to
[55:58] surrender who I am to him so that he can
[56:00] live through me.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; In the invisible union he says whatever
[56:08] you are you are servants of God.
[56:10] Whatever God wants you to do where your
[56:12] place is God God placed in the church
[56:15] some apostles, prophets, teachers,
[56:17] pastors. He placed that by virtue of his
[56:20] own predestination. And you were that to
[56:23] begin with. I've read this quote for
[56:25] many, many years. And as I read it, I I
[56:28] always thought, you know, whatever you
[56:29] are, you're servants of God. Whatever
[56:32] God wants you to do, where your place
[56:33] is. And then he only mentions five.
[56:37] Well, no. Here he mentions four.
[56:39] Apostles, prophets, teachers, pastors.
[56:41] He leaves out the evangelist. Poor
[56:43] evangelist.
[56:46] No, he left out a lot,
[56:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Because he's talking about whatever you
[56:52] are,
[56:53] &gt;&gt; your servants of God. Not everybody in
[56:54] the church fits into one of these
[56:56] ministry roles, and there's only four
[56:57] mentioned. But what he's showing is he's
[57:00] just quoting part of a a a a scripture
[57:04] to show us God placed in the church.
[57:08] He's not emphasizing, let let me show
[57:10] you here.
[57:13] He's not emphasizing this part.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; That's not his emphasis when he reads
[57:18] this. He's emphasizing this part.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; And that's why he's using that
[57:23] scripture. He's using the scripture not
[57:25] to tell you that the only ones that are
[57:27] placed in the church are apostles,
[57:29] prophets, teachers, pastors. He's
[57:31] telling you that God has placed you in
[57:33] the church. That God has put you where
[57:35] you are. That God is the one who's
[57:37] determined all of this.
[57:40] So let's read it again and not get
[57:42] caught up in the fact that he didn't he
[57:44] didn't mention whatever I am.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Whatever you are, you are servants of
[57:50] God. Whatever God wants you to do, where
[57:52] your place is, God placed in the church.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; God placed it. And he's using the
[57:58] scripture to justify what he's saying,
[58:00] but not to limit what he's saying to
[58:02] just these four words.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; He placed that by virtue of his own
[58:07] predestination. And you were that to
[58:09] begin with. So whatever God has placed
[58:12] you to do, like for me, I I fill several
[58:15] offices. I fill an office of father, an
[58:18] office of husband, an office of son, an
[58:20] office of male, of a man, an office of
[58:23] pastor. I fill all of these offices. And
[58:25] God wants to live through all of these
[58:27] offices. Amen. And he he wants to be a
[58:29] father through me to my children. He
[58:32] wants to be a son through me to my
[58:34] mother. He wants to be a pastor through
[58:36] me to to to the assembly here. God wants
[58:38] to use me for those offices. And I have
[58:41] to believe that God placed me there.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; That before the foundation of the world,
[58:45] he knew that I would be a father and he
[58:48] knew that I would have children. And he
[58:49] knew I would be a pastor. And wherever
[58:51] you are, he would knew he knew you would
[58:53] be where you are. He knew where you
[58:55] would wind up in every stage of life.
[58:57] When you were young, where you would be.
[58:58] when you're middleaged, when you're
[59:00] older, whether you'd be single, whether
[59:02] you'd be married, whether you'd be male,
[59:03] whether you'd be female, amen, whatever
[59:05] it is, he put the ingredients into you.
[59:08] And you were designed, amen, for a
[59:10] purpose and for a position and for a
[59:12] placing.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; AND IF THAT BE SO, AMEN. THEN GOD WANTS
[59:16] TO manifest in that place.
[59:20] SO, WE'RE NOT ALL JUST MOTHERS AND
[59:22] fathers and and men and women and and
[59:24] employees and employers and and students
[59:27] and and and whatever. We are retirees.
[59:29] We're not all that just sitting around
[59:31] waiting for something and then we're
[59:32] going to manifest Christ one day. Amen.
[59:35] And when I say that, I don't mean
[59:36] there's not other manifestations coming.
[59:38] There may very well be, but I can't keep
[59:40] looking off into the future waiting for
[59:42] something to happen when something's
[59:44] happening all around us every day. when
[59:46] Christ in you, the hope of glory, wants
[59:49] to manifest.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; He wants to manifest wherever we are. So
[59:54] that means there's a couple things that
[59:55] that means to me. That means that God
[59:58] knew I would be here and God put in me.
[1:00:00] Amen. What he wanted to put in me so he
[1:00:03] can manifest a certain way so that I
[1:00:05] won't become a victim of my own
[1:00:08] self.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; But I could be something that he can
[1:00:12] use.
[1:00:14] And two, God has already designed me,
[1:00:17] equipped me, and filled me with his
[1:00:19] spirit so that I could meet the
[1:00:21] challenges that I face in my office.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; If you're a student and God placed you
[1:00:30] there and you feel that God's led you to
[1:00:32] university or study somewhere and you
[1:00:34] believe this is God's plan for you and
[1:00:36] led you, you have what it takes to meet
[1:00:38] the challenge of your position.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're a mother, if you're a
[1:00:43] father, if you if you believe God gave
[1:00:45] me this job, then God wants to manifest
[1:00:47] through that job.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; How can you say, "God gave me this job."
[1:00:51] Amen. And then but but but there's no
[1:00:53] purpose in it spiritually. How could
[1:00:55] there be no purpose for our lives
[1:00:57] spiritually in anything that we do?
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; So that means God knew where we would be
[1:01:03] and God designed us to meet the
[1:01:05] challenge wherever we are. Amen. If
[1:01:07] you're a single young man, Amen. and
[1:01:09] you've got challenges as a single young
[1:01:11] man, God has designed you. You're
[1:01:14] equipped. You have what it takes to meet
[1:01:16] the challenge of being a single young
[1:01:18] man or a single young woman or or if
[1:01:21] you're older or if you're younger. It
[1:01:23] doesn't matter where you are. You place
[1:01:24] yourself in the picture. But God never
[1:01:26] left you destitute and all alone. But
[1:01:29] God himself was to come manifest in you.
[1:01:34] and his life in you with the way he made
[1:01:36] you will meet every challenge
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; because he's given us his word and he's
[1:01:43] equipped us with that word and with his
[1:01:45] spirit to meet the challenge for our
[1:01:47] position. But sometimes we don't realize
[1:01:49] we're being challenged.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; We just think we're having a hard time.
[1:01:55] We just think we're having a bad day.
[1:01:57] Has manybody ever thought you just had a
[1:01:59] bad day and don't realize that it's the
[1:02:02] bad day that brings out attributes of
[1:02:05] Christ and something in you can overcome
[1:02:08] every situation. And in overcoming the
[1:02:10] situation will be manifesting Christ.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Manifesting Christ in every office.
[1:02:21] And and I don't want to wait to do that.
[1:02:25] I want to do that every day of my life.
[1:02:27] Amen.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Things that are to be says now the only
[1:02:31] way that you can be a son or daughter of
[1:02:32] God because you have to be have to have
[1:02:35] eternal life. And there's only one form
[1:02:37] of eternal life and that's God's life.
[1:02:39] Only one form of eternal life that was
[1:02:41] God. There to be a son of God, you had
[1:02:43] to be in him always. The gene of your
[1:02:45] life, spiritual life tonight was in God
[1:02:48] the father before there was even a
[1:02:50] molecule. And you are nothing but the
[1:02:52] manifestation of the gene of life that
[1:02:54] was in God as a son of God. And now
[1:02:57] you're expressed after his word has come
[1:03:00] in you to light up this age. You are
[1:03:02] expressing God's life in you because you
[1:03:05] are a son or daughter of God. Do we
[1:03:07] believe this?
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Now you're expressed after his word has
[1:03:10] come in you to do something in the
[1:03:13] future down the road someday.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; No. After his word has come in you to
[1:03:18] light up this age, you are expressing
[1:03:21] God's life in you because you are a son
[1:03:23] or daughter of God.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Let's continue on. Therefore, you get
[1:03:27] what I mean? You're you are now made
[1:03:30] you're sitting in this church tonight
[1:03:31] because your duty is to express God to
[1:03:33] this nation and this people and this
[1:03:36] neighborhood where you associate
[1:03:37] wherever you are. God knew that you
[1:03:39] would be here because you you have to be
[1:03:41] one of his genes or his attributes. You
[1:03:44] had to be. So wherever you are in
[1:03:47] whatever position you hold in whatever
[1:03:49] office you administer, you've got to be
[1:03:51] one of God's genes down there quickened
[1:03:53] to life by the word. Amen. To be made
[1:03:55] light in whatever position that you're
[1:03:57] in.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; And then all of a sudden I began to
[1:04:02] think as I've been meditating on this.
[1:04:07] Let's say for instance, you have a
[1:04:09] mother and a mother's really struggling
[1:04:11] with a child going through a stage of
[1:04:13] development in life. It could be going
[1:04:15] through toddler years. It can go through
[1:04:17] teenage years. Whatever it is, and
[1:04:19] there's a struggle that all of a sudden
[1:04:22] mom and this child is struggling
[1:04:24] together. Amen. And you and you you say,
[1:04:26] "Why is this happening to me?" And why?
[1:04:28] But you don't realize that there's
[1:04:30] something in you that wants to overcome
[1:04:32] the struggle. And you need the struggle
[1:04:35] to manifest Christ as a mom.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Same thing for a dad or a man or a woman
[1:04:42] or a single or or or a widow or a
[1:04:44] widower or we because remember we're
[1:04:47] we're challenged constantly. Is there
[1:04:49] anybody's been on vacation from
[1:04:50] challenges lately? You can say I've had
[1:04:53] a reprieve for 6 months, brother. It has
[1:04:55] been great. I don't know what's wrong
[1:04:56] with you, but it seems like we talk
[1:04:58] about this all the time at home. It it's
[1:05:01] a fun discussion.
[1:05:03] It used to be I can't wait till this is
[1:05:05] over. It'll be easier after this.
[1:05:09] Has anybody else said that?
[1:05:14] Oh, if we could just get through this
[1:05:15] trial, then it'll be smooth sailing.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; So, our language has changed.
[1:05:22] I have no idea what's coming next. This
[1:05:24] is familiar. I'll just stay in this
[1:05:26] trial a little longer.
[1:05:28] [Applause]
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. At least I know what I'm
[1:05:33] dealing with. I mean, I'm not ready to
[1:05:35] step off into the abyss into the next
[1:05:37] one. And that's not exactly the right
[1:05:40] idea either, but But you start to think
[1:05:42] this way. It's like it's never ending.
[1:05:44] It never stops. It's you're being
[1:05:46] buffeted one after the other after the
[1:05:48] other after the other. And what did we
[1:05:50] think we came to this life for? Why do
[1:05:51] we think we're here? What do we think
[1:05:53] life's all about? Amen. This is about
[1:05:55] training for reigning and character
[1:05:57] building and manifesting the life of
[1:05:59] Christ. And how was Christ manifest? He
[1:06:01] wasn't manifest in a bubble of
[1:06:03] perfection with nothing happening. He
[1:06:05] was pressed against. He was he was
[1:06:07] doubted. He was he he was he was uh
[1:06:09] criticized. Amen. He was tormented. He
[1:06:12] was he was rebuked. He was accused of
[1:06:14] being uh be elabub. All of these
[1:06:16] challenges in his life and he began to
[1:06:18] overcome all these challenges and
[1:06:20] manifest God in flesh.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; And now there's there's things that have
[1:06:26] to happen to us. Now all of a sudden if
[1:06:28] I'm a dad and as a dad I start to have a
[1:06:31] challenge in my house in my household in
[1:06:34] my family. How many how many of you have
[1:06:36] dad? Don't please don't raise your hand
[1:06:37] to this.
[1:06:40] You leave work a hero and you come home
[1:06:42] a zero and you didn't do anything.
[1:06:46] Everything was fine. Everybody was
[1:06:48] happy. And when I come home, you can
[1:06:50] feel the tension when you walk in the
[1:06:52] door and you know
[1:06:55] everything's about to pop. I have no
[1:06:56] idea. And I'm afraid to say anything to
[1:06:59] anybody.
[1:07:03] And you can just want to go turn around
[1:07:04] and go right back to work.
[1:07:07] If you don't realize that God placed me
[1:07:09] here to meet this challenge,
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; that there's something in me that can
[1:07:13] overcome this challenge. Amen. And I can
[1:07:16] manifest Christ into my family. And then
[1:07:19] you can stop for a minute before you
[1:07:21] before you make big mistakes and step on
[1:07:23] landmines and say, "God, you got to help
[1:07:26] me, Lord. If I surrender, will you come
[1:07:27] and work through me now?"
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Same thing for grandparents and and same
[1:07:32] thing for churches and same thing for
[1:07:34] businesses and places of work. it it's
[1:07:36] all the same. There's got to be a
[1:07:38] challenge because the challenge is
[1:07:40] drawing character and virtue out of us.
[1:07:42] Amen. God doesn't want us to live in a
[1:07:44] perfect bubble and say, "Yeah, well
[1:07:46] done. You you you gained character. You
[1:07:48] learned how to rule and reign and you
[1:07:50] manifest my life." No. So now, instead
[1:07:53] of being afraid of the challenges, we
[1:07:56] need to step into the challenge and step
[1:07:58] up to the challenge. And it's not that
[1:08:01] we can do it in our flesh. And it's not
[1:08:02] like I've it's not like stand back
[1:08:04] everybody. I've got this. I mean, that's
[1:08:06] the wrong attitude.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; But for me, it's like God knew before
[1:08:10] the foundation of the world.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; God's ordained every trial, and he knew
[1:08:15] where I'd be. And God put me in this
[1:08:17] position. And he didn't put me here to
[1:08:21] fail.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; He put me here to manifest him.
[1:08:26] Sometimes we got to get stop just hit
[1:08:28] the pause button for a second and step
[1:08:30] back and reorder our thinking back to
[1:08:32] God's thinking because we we sometimes
[1:08:34] forget the big picture and we get stuck
[1:08:36] in the forest with the trees and we
[1:08:38] start reacting to what's going on around
[1:08:40] us and we forget that no trial comes
[1:08:42] unless it's first signed off by God and
[1:08:45] it's all for a purpose and that God
[1:08:47] picked me to be here and he picked this
[1:08:49] trial for me and there's something good
[1:08:51] going to come from it and I'm not
[1:08:53] running away from it but I'm going to
[1:08:54] stand here and I'm going to say, "God,
[1:08:56] give me the sensitivity to move forward
[1:08:58] the way you want me to move forward.
[1:09:00] Help me to say what needs said, do what
[1:09:01] needs done." Amen. To move forward and
[1:09:03] manifest you.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to live as a coward.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; But I don't want to miss God in
[1:09:11] simplicity.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; The simplicity of a problem at work, the
[1:09:17] simplicity of a problem at home, the
[1:09:19] simplicity of a problem amongst loved
[1:09:22] ones.
[1:09:24] That simplicity could be God hiding
[1:09:27] himself and then revealing himself in
[1:09:30] simplicity.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus says to his disciples, "You have
[1:09:37] not chosen me, but I've chosen you and
[1:09:41] ordained you that you should go and
[1:09:43] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[1:09:45] should remain that whatsoever you shall
[1:09:47] ask of the Father in my name, he may
[1:09:50] give it you."
[1:09:52] Can we believe this?
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; This would helps us so much. If I
[1:09:57] believe God chose me
[1:10:01] and ordained me,
[1:10:04] brother says, see now this is that is my
[1:10:07] part. Now, brother or Roberts, God gave
[1:10:10] him something else to do. And brother A.
[1:10:11] Allen and many of these other brethren
[1:10:13] who has great radio broadcast and
[1:10:15] things, they've got to have money and
[1:10:17] help support themselves. See, I do all
[1:10:19] that I can because I realize that's my
[1:10:21] brother. Or brother said, I helped
[1:10:23] support them myself. I do all that I can
[1:10:25] because I realize that's my brother. I
[1:10:27] couldn't fill his place. I'm kind of
[1:10:29] glad that I don't have to. See, because
[1:10:31] I haven't got the mental powers to work
[1:10:34] those things out. And so I just stay the
[1:10:36] way that I am. As Cong Congressman
[1:10:38] Upshaw used to say, you can't be nothing
[1:10:41] that you hate. So that's right. And the
[1:10:43] quicker we realize that, the better off
[1:10:45] we'll be. you just be what you are. God
[1:10:49] wants you the way he made you and just
[1:10:52] keep that in mind and be just what if
[1:10:54] it's a doormat, be a doormat. I want to
[1:10:57] be the desk best doormat he ever had. If
[1:11:00] I have to be a doormat or whatever it is
[1:11:02] in the house of God, let me serve my
[1:11:04] office the best I can for him.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; I just want to highlight a couple
[1:11:08] things.
[1:11:10] Just be what you are. God wants you the
[1:11:14] way he made you.
[1:11:16] It helps so much to believe this.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; To believe it and then serve my office
[1:11:25] the best that I can for him. God made me
[1:11:29] this way and he placed me this way and
[1:11:31] I'm going to do the best I can for him
[1:11:33] and ask for his help along the way. He
[1:11:36] says you can't make yourself something
[1:11:38] you're not. Oh, can we just highlight
[1:11:41] that? That makes me feel so good.
[1:11:44] I don't know about you, but I've spent a
[1:11:46] lot of years wishing I was different
[1:11:47] than I am.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; I I I've I've personality made messes
[1:11:53] and made things difficult and and done
[1:11:56] things and said things and I I you know,
[1:11:58] sometimes you you just leave a situation
[1:12:01] and you reflect back on life, you said,
[1:12:03] "I just hate the way that I'm made." Has
[1:12:04] anybody ever said that?
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's not a good thing to say.
[1:12:08] Right?
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Because who was it that brought this one
[1:12:11] to this one and this one to this one?
[1:12:13] And
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; there's a purpose in it, friends.
[1:12:17] You can't make yourself something you're
[1:12:19] not. I wanted to be 6' tall and weigh
[1:12:22] 190 lbs. It didn't do me any good. What
[1:12:26] didn't do me good to want it? He said,
[1:12:29] who who taking thought can add one cubit
[1:12:31] to his stature? You are what you are by
[1:12:33] the grace of God. You can't add nothing.
[1:12:36] You can't take nothing. If God wanted
[1:12:38] you to be a minister, he'd ordained you
[1:12:40] to be a minister before the world ever
[1:12:41] began. You believe that? It's what the
[1:12:43] Bible teaches.
[1:12:46] Amen. It's not I I I'd serve God better
[1:12:49] in this position or if I could be that
[1:12:51] or if I had a job to do or if I had a
[1:12:54] position in the church. No, it's not
[1:12:56] like that. It's wherever God's placed
[1:12:59] me, I can serve God. and whatever
[1:13:02] position I am every day, I can serve God
[1:13:04] and let the light shine wherever I am.
[1:13:07] Not not listen kids, not when I grow up.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Not when I grow up. An eight-year-old
[1:13:13] can be in their position and shine forth
[1:13:15] the glory of the word.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; When they stay in honor and subjection
[1:13:19] to mom and dad and love the things of
[1:13:21] God and open their heart to the Lord and
[1:13:24] just live whatever they can, the best
[1:13:26] they can as a son or daughter, the best
[1:13:28] they can in their family, as a brother
[1:13:30] or sister. Listen, you don't have to
[1:13:31] wait till you grow up. Wherever you are,
[1:13:33] whatever you're doing, Amen. You can
[1:13:35] surrender to God and you can manifest
[1:13:37] something for the kingdom of God.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:43] And questions and answers on the seals,
[1:13:45] this question, we've been through it
[1:13:46] here recently. He said, "Should
[1:13:48] evangelism continue on the field in this
[1:13:51] hour?" Of course, what they mean
[1:13:53] certainly, by all means, don't change a
[1:13:56] thing. If Jesus is coming in the
[1:13:57] morning, preach today like it was going
[1:13:59] to be 10 years from today, but live like
[1:14:01] it's going to be at this hour. Don't get
[1:14:04] scrupled up now. This is what I want to
[1:14:07] pay attention to. That's what I'm trying
[1:14:09] to warn you about. See, don't be odd,
[1:14:12] peculiar. Don't change nothing. If
[1:14:14] you're doing something wrong or doing
[1:14:15] evil, repent. Come back to God.
[1:14:18] Brother Bamman preaching the seals, he
[1:14:21] wasn't telling us at the opening of the
[1:14:23] seventh seal, now everybody run off and
[1:14:25] and we're going to we're going to make a
[1:14:27] commune. And you know, people were
[1:14:29] telling him, amen, now that the
[1:14:31] millenniums get ready set in, I've sold
[1:14:32] my farm. Won't need it anymore. Amen.
[1:14:34] All these things that people were
[1:14:35] telling brother Brandham, and he's
[1:14:36] telling them, don't do that. Don't do
[1:14:39] that. That's not what God wants. Amen.
[1:14:41] Whenever God wants to bring a change in
[1:14:42] our life, he'll bring a change in our
[1:14:44] life.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; How many has ever had an office change?
[1:14:49] from boy and girl to husband and wife.
[1:14:52] You ever had an office change
[1:14:54] or to father and mother or to you know
[1:14:57] to to teacher or to whatever God you
[1:15:01] you've had office changes or God has
[1:15:03] added offices to you. Amen. That's God's
[1:15:05] doing.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; The best thing for us to do is give him
[1:15:09] our whole life and just live our life
[1:15:10] and God will take us wherever he wants
[1:15:12] to take us.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. In this message, he says, "Now,
[1:15:18] because we have a responsibility that
[1:15:21] we've got to answer to God someday for
[1:15:24] every man that come on the face of the
[1:15:26] earth has to answer to God for a
[1:15:27] responsibility." And to many of us, a
[1:15:30] stewardship we have to answer for. This
[1:15:33] responsibility is a stewardship that's
[1:15:35] been committed to us by God. I don't
[1:15:37] care what it is. As I said a few moments
[1:15:39] ago, a housewife, then be a genuine
[1:15:41] housewife. That's right. If it's to be a
[1:15:43] farmer, be a genuine farmer. Whatever it
[1:15:46] is that God has put you to do, you've
[1:15:48] got a stewardship to that. You've got to
[1:15:51] answer to God for it because it takes
[1:15:53] all these things to do it.
[1:15:57] It's amazing.
[1:16:00] If I understand what I believe, I
[1:16:02] understand the prophet saying,
[1:16:05] "If God's called me to be a farmer, I
[1:16:08] have a responsibility to be a farmer.
[1:16:11] And I'll answer to God on how I was a
[1:16:13] farmer,
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; right? Is that what you think he's
[1:16:16] saying?
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Are we reading the same thing?
[1:16:20] I never realized that I was going to
[1:16:23] answer to God for the way I ministered
[1:16:26] my occupation.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; But if God gave us to do it, how should
[1:16:33] we do it?
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; As unto the Lord.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what Paul teaches us?
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Paul tells us, Amen. the the servants to
[1:16:42] serve and to do their work as unto the
[1:16:44] Lord. And all of a sudden, you say,
[1:16:45] "What what instruction is Paul giving?"
[1:16:47] He's placing the church in order here in
[1:16:49] the book of Ephesus. He come along,
[1:16:51] amen, to establish the message of grace
[1:16:54] and to order the church and order
[1:16:55] people. And what's he telling them to
[1:16:57] do? He's telling them to be a good
[1:16:59] employee.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; And and you know, that wasn't the
[1:17:05] exciting part of the sermon,
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:11] Amen.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Like I I I wasn't expecting standing and
[1:17:17] shouting tonight
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; or flooding to the altar.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; But what I was expecting is say, you
[1:17:24] know what, it's the little foxes that
[1:17:27] spoil the vine.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Wanting to be spiritual and not natural.
[1:17:32] We haven't realized that God wants to be
[1:17:34] spiritual while we're being natural.
[1:17:36] Amen.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; That God wanted to live natural in flesh
[1:17:41] and he did so in Jesus Christ. And
[1:17:43] through that natural life and natural
[1:17:44] flesh, he demonstrated the spiritual,
[1:17:47] the supernatural. And he wants to do the
[1:17:49] same thing in our lives. Amen. Live a
[1:17:51] natural life with us
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; so he can manifest himself.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to finish with this just a
[1:18:01] just a two more. Ecclesiastes,
[1:18:04] "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do
[1:18:06] it with thy might. For there is no work,
[1:18:09] nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in
[1:18:11] the grave, whether thou goest."
[1:18:15] Can you imagine living all your life and
[1:18:18] saying, "Really, I was just a housewife
[1:18:21] and just a mother, and I didn't do
[1:18:22] anything other than that."
[1:18:25] and and and getting to heaven. If we go
[1:18:28] to heaven this way and have a
[1:18:29] conversation with God and God says,
[1:18:31] "That's exactly what I wanted you to do.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; I didn't do anything spiritual. Didn't
[1:18:36] do anything spiritual. That was the
[1:18:38] thing that I needed you to do more than
[1:18:40] anything else is I needed you to raise
[1:18:41] those children in fear and admonition of
[1:18:43] the Lord."
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; You know, or neglect to do that because
[1:18:48] we want to go do something spiritual.
[1:18:49] So, we don't raise our children. We
[1:18:51] don't stay at home. We we're not a
[1:18:53] keeper at home. We're not uh nurturing
[1:18:55] and loving and doing the things God
[1:18:56] wants us to do as a mother to express
[1:18:59] the El Shadi, the breasted God, the
[1:19:01] nature of God in female form, but we run
[1:19:03] off to do spiritual things
[1:19:06] and leave our children with no mother.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Which is more spiritual?
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Which is more spiritual? Hey, listen.
[1:19:15] Tell me anytime
[1:19:18] keeping the scripture is not spiritual.
[1:19:22] Right.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; And how can you be spiritual and break
[1:19:27] the scriptures?
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; I mean, you can be spiritual, but I mean
[1:19:33] truly the right kind of spirit. The Holy
[1:19:35] Ghost doesn't break the scriptures.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; But to be truly spiritual, to be truly
[1:19:43] spiritual, I will also be scriptural. So
[1:19:45] to be truly spiritual, I won't talk back
[1:19:48] to my boss.
[1:19:50] Because Paul says, "Teach the servants
[1:19:52] not to answer again.
[1:19:54] I'll do my work as unto the Lord." Why?
[1:19:57] Because what am I doing at work? Amen.
[1:19:59] Brother Bam even gives the example. If I
[1:20:01] was called to work, Amen. I wouldn't
[1:20:03] stop 15 minutes early. But if I was paid
[1:20:05] to work to a certain time, I would do my
[1:20:06] work all the way till the buzzer rang.
[1:20:08] And if everybody else is standing around
[1:20:10] the time card waiting to check out, but
[1:20:12] because of the instructions of a prophet
[1:20:14] and the instructions of the Apostle
[1:20:15] Paul, I sit there and shovel my coal
[1:20:18] until the buzzer rings. What am I doing?
[1:20:20] I'm being spiritual.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Why am I being spiritual? Because the
[1:20:26] spirit of God will stick with the word.
[1:20:28] And if the word says the to do my work
[1:20:30] as unto the Lord, then I'm going to do
[1:20:32] my work as unto the Lord. If the if the
[1:20:34] word says women, obey your husbands as
[1:20:38] the Lord, as Sarah did, calling him
[1:20:40] Lord. Amen. Then I'm going to be in
[1:20:41] subjection to my husband. Amen.
[1:20:43] Regardless of of of what I think about
[1:20:46] him, I'm going to do it according to the
[1:20:47] word. And what is she doing? That
[1:20:49] woman's being spiritual.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; She's what's she doing? She's living the
[1:20:55] word.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Rim said, "We live in
[1:20:58] the day, Amen, where the the the Christ
[1:21:01] was the word, the bride will be the
[1:21:02] word." We're living in the day where the
[1:21:04] word is becoming flesh and the flesh is
[1:21:06] becoming the word. You know what's
[1:21:08] happening? Amen. When you take the
[1:21:10] simple things that we read in Titus and
[1:21:12] we do exactly what Titus told us to do
[1:21:14] as employees or as workers or all these
[1:21:16] things. Amen. WE ARE FLESHING OUT THE
[1:21:19] word
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; in the simple things. We're fleshing out
[1:21:23] the word. WE WANT TO FLESH out the word
[1:21:25] because we want to walk on water or part
[1:21:27] the sea or or speak to the sun to stand
[1:21:30] still. We want to be spiritual that way,
[1:21:32] but we don't want to be spiritual and
[1:21:34] not talking back to the boss and working
[1:21:35] at our work is unto the Lord.
[1:21:38] And as children obeying their parents
[1:21:40] and
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; you know children when when as a
[1:21:45] teenager when you subject yourself to to
[1:21:47] the headship of mom and dad and you
[1:21:49] don't necessarily agree with their
[1:21:50] decision and you voiced your
[1:21:51] disagreement but they say this is what I
[1:21:53] believe and you subject yourself to that
[1:21:55] you know what you're doing you're
[1:21:56] fleshing out the word the word is
[1:21:58] becoming flesh in you
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; you're being spiritual
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; hey listen this is if you want to talk
[1:22:07] about rubber meets the road. Here's
[1:22:09] rubber meets the road, friends.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Wherever God has placed me, that's where
[1:22:14] he wants me to be. Whatever position I
[1:22:16] hold is what God wants from me. And what
[1:22:18] he wants me to do in that position is
[1:22:20] what he's asked me to do in that
[1:22:22] position. And when I do that, amen, I
[1:22:24] can live a life pleasing to the Lord and
[1:22:27] live a spiritual life
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; and manifest the word
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; and bring glory to God. It's not it's
[1:22:36] not for me to worry about
[1:22:39] what other things I should do.
[1:22:42] Should we be doing this work or should I
[1:22:45] be doing this kind of work? Brother
[1:22:47] Brandham even said when it comes to
[1:22:48] gifts, he said don't chase after any
[1:22:51] gift.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; He goes, then you could leave the giver
[1:22:54] behind.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; He said you just fall in love with God
[1:22:57] and give your heart to God and fall in
[1:22:59] love with him and he'll supply the gifts
[1:23:01] he wants you to have. Amen.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; It's not about figuring out how I'm
[1:23:06] going to uh, you know, I'm going to
[1:23:08] speak the manifestation of the spoken
[1:23:10] word. Listen, brother Brandham never
[1:23:13] even figured out how to speak the
[1:23:14] manifestation of the spoken word. God
[1:23:15] come to him and told him when it was
[1:23:17] time.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; So, if there's a time for us to manifest
[1:23:20] something else, God will come to us and
[1:23:22] tell us when it's time. But he'll do it
[1:23:23] when we're doing what we're supposed to
[1:23:25] be doing every day of our lives. Because
[1:23:27] when it happened to brother, I mean,
[1:23:29] what was he doing when the first time?
[1:23:31] Amen. He manifest the power of the
[1:23:32] spoken word in the woods. He was
[1:23:34] squirrel hunting.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; What's spiritual about squirrel hunting?
[1:23:43] He wasn't in church.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; He wasn't he was squirrel hunting.
[1:23:49] But God come and brought a manifestation
[1:23:51] squirrel hunting.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; When it come to talk to Hattie writes
[1:23:55] boys and mean give Hattie, he was
[1:23:57] telling a story
[1:23:59] around a table. people that ate a meal,
[1:24:01] pushed back their tables, was telling a
[1:24:02] story. They were in fellowship in the
[1:24:04] house.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Living life. You know, I think sometimes
[1:24:10] we overlook some of the things that are
[1:24:12] important to God.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; We don't see them as important, but God
[1:24:16] sees them as important. God wants to
[1:24:18] live in a many membered body. And that
[1:24:20] many membered body, he's placed as
[1:24:23] postmen and nurses and and doctors and
[1:24:26] whatever job and engineers and all these
[1:24:28] other jobs that we have. and housewives
[1:24:30] and and all these things that God placed
[1:24:32] us in. And he wants to live in a body of
[1:24:35] flesh as a many membered body. And that
[1:24:38] body is going to go to work.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; That body is going to clean the house.
[1:24:44] That body is going to cook supper. That
[1:24:47] body is going to rock a baby. That body
[1:24:49] is going to comfort a friend. That body
[1:24:51] is going to do whatever he calls us to
[1:24:54] do. Right.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; So, let's not miss let's not let's not,
[1:25:01] like I said, climb the ladder, the
[1:25:02] spiritual ladder so high that we miss
[1:25:05] some of the things that God is wanting
[1:25:06] to do in our lives. And let's come back
[1:25:09] down to the simplicity of this is where
[1:25:12] I am. This is who I am. This is where
[1:25:14] God made me. And this is where he put
[1:25:15] me. And I'm going to live all that I can
[1:25:18] every day of my life right here. Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; And every step he leads me to do, I'll
[1:25:23] give him the same thing. All that I am,
[1:25:25] all that I can here.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; If he moves me here, same he's going to
[1:25:30] get the same thing out of me no matter
[1:25:31] where he moves me.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; I'm going to do the best I can in
[1:25:35] whatever position he put me in. And I'm
[1:25:37] going to trust him to do the things that
[1:25:40] I can't do.
[1:25:42] I want to read this last quote and then
[1:25:44] we're going to close.
[1:25:46] Yet men and women live a good life and
[1:25:49] love God by a mental conception. But the
[1:25:51] real hiding place is in the heart hid
[1:25:53] with Christ. And when Christ, the Holy
[1:25:55] Spirit comes into your heart. He is in
[1:25:58] you with your temperament. And he's
[1:26:01] living his own life through his own will
[1:26:03] through you. Hallelujah. I know it
[1:26:05] sounds awful, but it's right. Christ so
[1:26:07] yielded you are that Christ speaks the
[1:26:09] kind of words he'd speak. He thinks the
[1:26:11] kind of words he would think through
[1:26:13] you. He does the kind of works he would
[1:26:15] do through you. You are yielded and
[1:26:18] resting.
[1:26:20] What a beautiful picture of a
[1:26:22] consecrated Christian yielded. Christ
[1:26:25] working through.
[1:26:27] You are yielded and resting.
[1:26:31] Resting in what? Resting in my position
[1:26:34] where he put me and yielding completely
[1:26:37] to him to where I'm so yielded and
[1:26:40] surrendered to him. I think the thoughts
[1:26:42] he would think and I say the words he
[1:26:44] would say.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:46] And and if I could just share with you a
[1:26:48] testimony of myself, there's so many
[1:26:52] times that I'll get in a conversation
[1:26:54] with somebody in fellowship and I'll
[1:26:56] just be talking just talking and and
[1:27:00] it'll be somebody at church or or or a
[1:27:02] friend or somebody and just in chatting
[1:27:05] and I'll start saying things and
[1:27:07] starting giving examples of brother
[1:27:09] Benham or talk about a Bible verse and
[1:27:10] just fellowship. We'll talk about the
[1:27:12] day. We'll talk about the kids. We'll
[1:27:13] talk about something.
[1:27:16] And later someone will tell me that
[1:27:19] thing you said when we were talking, I
[1:27:21] had a question in my heart. And when you
[1:27:24] said that, what you told me, brother,
[1:27:25] that answered my question.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Listen, I wasn't being spiritual. And I
[1:27:31] didn't know I was saying the things
[1:27:33] Christ would say.
[1:27:35] I was saying the things that were on my
[1:27:38] heart and I thought it was just me
[1:27:40] saying it. I didn't know that the things
[1:27:42] on my heart could be Christ speaking out
[1:27:45] of my mouth the things he wanted to say.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Just because we don't have a sensation
[1:27:52] doesn't mean Christ isn't speaking. And
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; just because we don't have a vision or a
[1:27:57] dream or an audible voice doesn't mean
[1:27:59] it's not Christ's mind that's
[1:28:01] influencing us to action,
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; giving us his thoughts. If we can just
[1:28:06] consecrate ourselves to him and be true
[1:28:08] to the position he put us in and be
[1:28:10] yielded to him, it can be his thoughts
[1:28:13] that are directing us and his words that
[1:28:15] are speaking through our lips. And we
[1:28:17] may not have a sensation when we think
[1:28:19] it or speak it and may not know that
[1:28:21] it's spiritual direction, but it's
[1:28:23] spiritual direction, friends.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he has no hands but our
[1:28:28] hands, no mouth but our mouth, no eyes
[1:28:30] but our eyes, no feet but our feet. If
[1:28:32] he's going to do a work, where is he
[1:28:34] going to do it? He's going to do it with
[1:28:35] you. Where is he going to do it with
[1:28:36] you? He's going to do it with you in
[1:28:38] your position.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Wherever he puts you doing whatever he
[1:28:44] called you to do. And it's his mind is
[1:28:46] going to flow through you. His words are
[1:28:48] going to come out of your lips. It's
[1:28:50] going to be him using you. And you may
[1:28:52] not even be conscious he's using you.
[1:28:55] You may find out months later, years
[1:28:57] later, and you may never find out
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; that it was God using you. I say, let's
[1:29:05] be conscious of our office and let's
[1:29:08] give him preeminence in our office. And
[1:29:12] don't think because we don't feel
[1:29:14] something, nothing's happening. And
[1:29:16] don't think because we we we we can't
[1:29:19] see something that nothing's happening.
[1:29:21] But we have to believe that God put me
[1:29:23] here and God made me this way and God
[1:29:25] placed me and something's happening
[1:29:27] every day. And if it's not happening out
[1:29:30] there, something's happening in here as
[1:29:32] I'm challenged and I meet the challenge
[1:29:34] and I find strength in the word of God
[1:29:36] and and I take and apply the word even
[1:29:38] when I don't feel like applying the
[1:29:40] word. When I submit when I don't feel
[1:29:42] like submitting, when I when I when I do
[1:29:44] when I don't feel like doing, and when I
[1:29:46] do all of that, I realize I'm living the
[1:29:49] word and God is having his way with me.
[1:29:54] Amen. Let's all stand together.
[1:29:59] Question is, how is God going to work
[1:30:02] through you?
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Remember how Dan, brother Daniel kept
[1:30:08] saying, what does this look like today?
[1:30:11] I mean, what a good question. Not even a
[1:30:13] question I could answer all the time.
[1:30:15] You see so many things. How does this
[1:30:17] look today? And you have to just think
[1:30:18] about I I don't always know, but it's
[1:30:20] Jesus Christ the same today, yesterday,
[1:30:23] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; What does it look like today? I may not
[1:30:28] always understand what it looks like,
[1:30:30] but it's going, we know it's going to
[1:30:32] take place in a many membered body.
[1:30:35] Amen.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, forever
[1:30:38] in bride form. And that means he's in
[1:30:42] you.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Christ in you,
[1:30:46] hidden and revealed in simplicity.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; But I'm so simple and I'm nobody. And
[1:30:54] I'm just a
[1:30:57] You can fill in the blank. I'm just a
[1:31:00] teenage guy. I'm just a young woman. I'm
[1:31:04] just whatever you want to say. You can
[1:31:07] be just that. But I'll ask you, can God
[1:31:11] work in just that?
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Can he hide himself and reveal himself
[1:31:17] through that simplicity?
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; I believe that's exactly what he's doing
[1:31:21] in this hour. Exactly what he's doing.
[1:31:26] I want him to do it.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians, if you could come on up
[1:31:30] and Brother John, let's just bow our
[1:31:32] heads together.
[1:31:34] Dear Lord Jesus, we thank you, Father,
[1:31:36] for the things that you have taught us,
[1:31:38] God. These are lessons, Lord, that are
[1:31:41] so profound in such simplicity.
[1:31:44] They're utterly simple, Lord. And I just
[1:31:47] when I look at what Paul taught Titus
[1:31:51] and Timothy and through the book of
[1:31:53] Ephesians and what you said, Lord,
[1:31:57] I'm a marvel.
[1:32:00] You taught about giving to Caesar what
[1:32:02] Caesars's.
[1:32:03] You taught about going an extra mile
[1:32:06] when somebody asks to go a mile.
[1:32:09] Lord, you taught through John the
[1:32:12] preparation for the Messiah coming to be
[1:32:16] a good publican and a good soldier. When
[1:32:19] we look at this part of the word, Lord,
[1:32:20] it seems so simple. so simple it's
[1:32:24] almost like it's not necessary
[1:32:26] like it's somehow not fitting to a super
[1:32:29] race to a super people
[1:32:32] but Lord Jesus when you were here you
[1:32:36] submitted to parents
[1:32:38] you obeyed your father you paid taxes
[1:32:43] you did good works you were a good
[1:32:46] friend
[1:32:48] Lord Jesus if you did that in that form
[1:32:52] form. You can do it in my form.
[1:32:56] God, I pray that you would help me not
[1:32:57] to overlook the simple things. Not to
[1:33:01] overlook the simplicity of daily life.
[1:33:04] For God, when when is it you will start
[1:33:07] manifesting yourself in your bride. At
[1:33:10] what point down the road? I don't
[1:33:13] believe it's a point down the road. I
[1:33:14] believe it's now. And God, I want you to
[1:33:17] have your way in me and manifest
[1:33:19] yourself in me. Help me, God, to live,
[1:33:22] Lord, in the place you've placed me and
[1:33:24] to manifest in the position that I'm in.
[1:33:27] And Lord, bless your children that are
[1:33:29] here, everyone in every position that
[1:33:31] they hold, and every office that you
[1:33:33] placed them in, and the bodies that they
[1:33:35] dwell in, with the temperament that they
[1:33:37] have. God, may they give you room to
[1:33:40] work in that place. and help us to stop
[1:33:43] deferring to another time and to other
[1:33:45] events, but help us Lord to let you work
[1:33:48] in us every moment of every day. As a
[1:33:53] mom making breakfast for her little
[1:33:55] tots, may that be you providing for
[1:33:58] children and a father, Lord, who gathers
[1:34:01] his home and settles dispute. May that
[1:34:04] be you on display
[1:34:06] in every life and every individual,
[1:34:08] Lord. May we surrender to you and not
[1:34:11] miss the simplicity that you're
[1:34:13] revealing yourself in. May we not
[1:34:16] overlook, Lord, you you've hid it from
[1:34:19] the wise and prudent, but you've
[1:34:21] revealed it unto babes.
[1:34:23] God, the wise and prudent will never
[1:34:25] understand this, Lord. But the babes can
[1:34:27] only catch it by revelation.
[1:34:30] Then babes are your children. And Lord
[1:34:32] God, open our eyes to this revelation.
[1:34:34] And may we catch, amen, the deepness of
[1:34:36] this simple revelation
[1:34:39] that the simple things matter and every
[1:34:42] day is life and the word needs to be
[1:34:44] fleshed out. And may we flesh it out. We
[1:34:48] love you, God. I pray that you give us
[1:34:50] encouragement to move forward and face
[1:34:52] the challenges we face in everyday life
[1:34:55] with with a new vision, Lord, with a
[1:34:57] different perspective. May we give you
[1:35:00] an opportunity to work through us. We
[1:35:02] love you. We thank you, God, for these
[1:35:04] things and pray that you'd help us to
[1:35:05] continue to grow in your very likeness.
[1:35:09] We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
