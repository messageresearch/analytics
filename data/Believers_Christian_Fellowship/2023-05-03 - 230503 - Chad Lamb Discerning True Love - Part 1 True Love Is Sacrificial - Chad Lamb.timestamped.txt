[19:04] Among Us in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[19:07] amen
[19:09] and while you're standing let's take our
[19:10] Bibles and turn to First John chapter 4.
[19:14] are you doing that I'd like to welcome
[19:16] my friend brother Jiva rotner Marla Puti
[19:18] from India he's sitting right down here
[19:20] he came in for a few days to visit he
[19:22] should come in Monday and he's leaving
[19:24] unfortunately he's leaving tomorrow
[19:26] morning but we've had a good time of
[19:28] fellowship at the end of the service I'm
[19:30] going to ask him to come up and close an
[19:31] award of prayer just so he can greet you
[19:33] and then pray and pray at the dismissal
[19:37] and also want to remind you that this
[19:38] weekend will be the meetings with
[19:40] brother Abraham Myra Saturday and Sunday
[19:44] also there'll be a communion service
[19:45] with a fellowship dinner in between I
[19:47] just want to remind you of that I'm
[19:48] looking forward to that please remember
[19:50] to be praying for that amen and come
[19:52] with expectation amen
[19:55] well we're standing let's look at first
[19:56] John 4
[19:58] verse 7.
[20:02] first John 4 and 7. beloved let us love
[20:05] one another for love is of God and
[20:08] everyone that loveth is born of God and
[20:11] knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth
[20:14] not God for God is love amen God bless
[20:18] you as you have your seeds I mean this
[20:20] is quite a scripture
[20:23] so it says
[20:25] beloved let's love one another for love
[20:28] is of God and then he ends up by saying
[20:30] God is love so God and love are one and
[20:33] the same
[20:34] everyone that loveth is born of God Amen
[20:37] so if you're able to love the way God
[20:39] loves then you're born of God Amen
[20:42] uh
[20:45] everyone that loveth is born of God and
[20:47] knoweth God
[20:49] so you're born of God and know God if
[20:51] you love like God he that loveth not
[20:54] knoweth not God for God is love so that
[20:56] really that really says a lot just in
[20:58] that one verse let's read Romans 5 5
[21:00] together
[21:02] and then I'll start sharing with you my
[21:04] thought here uh Romans 5 chapter 5
[21:08] chapter 5 verse 5.
[21:13] he says and hope maketh not a shame
[21:15] because the love of God is shed abroad
[21:17] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[21:19] given unto us
[21:21] so he says if you're able to love then
[21:23] you're born of God and we know that this
[21:25] this love of God is shed abroad in our
[21:27] hearts by the Holy Ghost so the new
[21:29] birth brings us the love of God
[21:32] and God is love amen so so to to love
[21:37] like God is to be like God Amen and we
[21:39] know in this day in the stature of a
[21:41] perfect man that God has been building
[21:42] his church and bringing this church unto
[21:45] adoption into the statue of a perfect
[21:47] man and the capping off of that is
[21:49] charity is love amen is perfect love
[21:51] amen because God is love so what is God
[21:54] doing by showing the building of a
[21:56] statue of a perfect man and heading it
[21:58] up in love that is God himself amen
[22:01] bringing the church into the very
[22:03] likeness and image of God
[22:05] yeah to where when it's sealed and
[22:07] capped off and in full display amen
[22:09] it'll be displaying the very attributes
[22:12] in life of God
[22:13] that's why love is at the top
[22:16] amen and and for a title I'd like to
[22:19] title this Discerning true love
[22:21] Discerning true love
[22:24] and for a subtitle I like to put true
[22:27] love is sacrificial
[22:29] I don't know how far we'll we'll get
[22:31] into this as I started looking into this
[22:33] and meditating on it I've been
[22:34] meditating on it for several weeks now
[22:35] amen it just keeps blossoming so we
[22:38] might preach on this a little while but
[22:40] Discerning true love so we want to be
[22:42] able to serve true love we want to be
[22:44] able to discern it in ourselves and in
[22:45] others Discerning true love true love is
[22:48] sacrificial
[22:50] so it's the first part we want to look
[22:51] at and the message adore to the heart
[22:54] brother bear says what is God God is
[22:56] love he that loveth is of God now that
[23:00] isn't what we call free love that's
[23:02] agape love there's two different kinds
[23:05] of love one of them is the Greek word
[23:06] filio filio means friendship the kind
[23:09] you have for your wife love that kind of
[23:11] love that kind of love is not a true
[23:14] love
[23:15] oh boy that's amazing isn't it that kind
[23:18] of love is not a true love brother but
[23:20] I'm saying the kind of love that you
[23:22] have amen the emotional passionate kind
[23:25] of love is not a true love
[23:27] it's a human love it's an emotional love
[23:29] the kind that you have for your wife
[23:31] amen it that's that kind of love is not
[23:34] a true love oh I know you little
[23:36] teenagers want to believe that but it's
[23:38] wrong
[23:39] remember how many I I don't know how
[23:42] many of you experienced it but little
[23:43] teenage love and crushes and oh my
[23:45] goodness this person's the greatest this
[23:47] girl is it this guy is it amen and after
[23:50] a while you don't even like him anymore
[23:53] that wasn't love amen that was a feeling
[23:55] amen and the feeling faded
[23:58] but true love is not a feeling it's not
[24:00] based upon emotion it's something
[24:02] greater than that
[24:04] amen so that kind of love is not a true
[24:06] love
[24:06] the kind of that kind of love will make
[24:09] you jealous of your wife you'll take a
[24:11] pistol and blow a man's brains out
[24:12] because of her that ain't real love
[24:15] that's filio love but agape love will
[24:18] make you get down and pray for that
[24:20] man's lost soul that's agapio love
[24:23] that's the kind of love that the church
[24:25] needs what we all need is that kind of
[24:28] love God give me that love I'd rather
[24:31] have that experience of love than have
[24:33] all the gifts that God's got in his
[24:35] heaven
[24:36] because if you've got that kind of love
[24:38] you've got God because God Is This Love
[24:41] they're equal they're one and the same
[24:44] and so we want to talk about uh
[24:46] Discerning true love versus this false
[24:49] love or this that what brother said is
[24:51] not a true love
[24:53] and when we look up these two words
[24:55] there's a word study I've read this
[24:57] before to you several times out of uh
[25:00] the the concordance out of the Scofield
[25:02] uh not Schofield Strong's Concordance
[25:05] and there's a little write-up when you
[25:07] compare these two words and it's and
[25:08] it's a write-up from a German scholar a
[25:11] named Richard Linsky and he's in this is
[25:14] a statement I pulled out of that said
[25:16] the verb agapan that's where we get
[25:19] Agape or agapeon Love Is the Love of
[25:22] intelligence reason and comprehension
[25:24] coupled with the corresponding purpose
[25:27] in its content it is vastly outranks the
[25:30] other type of love
[25:32] and Fillion expresses the love of mere
[25:35] personal affection or liking including
[25:37] even the passions where the context
[25:39] requires and no intelligence or high
[25:42] purposes involved this is exactly what
[25:44] brother Ben is telling us in all in so
[25:46] many quotes he's telling us the
[25:48] difference between these two loves
[25:50] but it's articulated really well here he
[25:53] said he says so this filial love
[25:57] is mere personal affection or liking
[26:00] including even the passions where the
[26:03] context requires with no intelligence or
[26:06] high purpose involved it's just merely a
[26:08] reaction amen it's an emotional love
[26:12] and it goes on to say
[26:14] this content places the verb on a low
[26:17] level it could never be said of God that
[26:19] he Philly I the sinful word as far as
[26:22] Fillion is concerned he could only
[26:24] abominate the foul world
[26:26] Jesus never asked us to love our enemies
[26:28] in this sense of feeling he never asked
[26:30] us to love our enemies with a passionate
[26:32] loving feeling love for our enemies
[26:34] that wasn't the kind of love he wanted
[26:37] us to have a higher love to love the way
[26:38] he loves
[26:40] that's beyond emotion because my emotion
[26:42] can be all troubled about an enemy amen
[26:45] but there's a greater love than emotion
[26:46] that's higher than emotion that has
[26:49] intellect understanding that understands
[26:51] the plan of God that's the kind of love
[26:54] where Jesus could look nailed to a cross
[26:55] Upon A people who were wagging their
[26:57] heads and mocking him and saying father
[26:59] forgive them they don't know what
[27:00] they're doing that's true love
[27:06] so God never said he loved the world
[27:08] with a with a great emotional feeling he
[27:11] loved the world with a higher love than
[27:12] that
[27:13] he didn't ask us to love our enemies
[27:15] with that kind of weak love
[27:18] but with God's love
[27:21] then it goes on to say
[27:25] yes
[27:27] with this love did God love the world
[27:29] and we can love our enemies
[27:31] comprehending all that is wrong
[27:33] sanctifying the world converting our
[27:35] enemies compare John 3 16 and every
[27:37] other passage in which either of the
[27:39] verbs is used in the gospel only in a
[27:41] few cases where either type of Love
[27:43] would apply either verb might be used
[27:45] but even then the great distinction
[27:47] would remain the two are never equal
[27:50] this is what brother Brown tells us over
[27:52] and over and over when he begins to
[27:53] explain amen how your your filio love
[27:56] your emotional love your human love for
[27:59] a spouse will create a jealousy that
[28:01] would make you angry at a man who desire
[28:03] to kill them or harm them and or I mean
[28:06] if if there's anybody you want to hit
[28:08] strike speak evil again then then that's
[28:11] not the love of God
[28:15] but then brother van said but this kind
[28:17] of love God's love the agape love will
[28:20] cause you to pray for that man's soul
[28:22] that he'll be converted
[28:24] forgiven
[28:26] so now we want to discern true love
[28:29] and we want to look that the subtitle
[28:32] true love is sacrificial this is how
[28:35] we'll begin to discern true love
[28:37] because true love is sacrificial
[28:41] in Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[28:43] brother Ben says now God's secret
[28:45] mystery he had before the world began
[28:47] now back in the back part of God's mind
[28:49] there was something that he was trying
[28:51] and was going to achieve and he had a
[28:53] motive in doing it in order to let
[28:55] himself be expressed and Brethren him in
[28:58] this message and in others he's telling
[29:00] us that God Amen knew there would be a
[29:02] fall amen and in knowing there would be
[29:04] a fall amen there was attributes within
[29:07] God that God wanted to express and he
[29:09] could only express a Healer if somebody
[29:11] was sick he could only express a savior
[29:13] if somebody was lost amen so God Amen he
[29:17] allowed this this plan he allowed the
[29:19] fall to take place amen because it would
[29:22] set the backdrop that he needed to
[29:24] display his fullness
[29:27] amen
[29:28] so the backdrop of the Fall the fall
[29:32] provides the backdrop for God to display
[29:35] What Love Is
[29:37] because of the Fall we can understand
[29:40] love
[29:43] men because of the Fall we can
[29:45] understand salvation because of the Fall
[29:46] we can understand Redemption because of
[29:48] the Fall we can understand Deliverance
[29:50] because of the Fall we can understand
[29:51] healing
[29:53] but because of the Fall we can
[29:55] understand love
[29:57] it's a it's the backdrop for God's Great
[30:00] art for the display of God's attributes
[30:03] amen is this fall
[30:05] so then we look at John 3 16.
[30:08] John 3 16 said for God so loved the
[30:11] world that he gave his only begotten son
[30:13] that whosoever believeth in him should
[30:15] not perish but have everlasting life so
[30:18] God when God loves he gives
[30:22] God's love was a sacrificial love
[30:25] when God loved he gave his only begotten
[30:28] son and we know that only begotten son
[30:30] was God himself dwelling in a body of
[30:33] Flesh to pay the price of redemption
[30:35] himself
[30:37] so God's love God the the the the the
[30:40] the
[30:41] true love
[30:42] was a sacrificial love of the one who
[30:46] was doing the loving
[30:49] who was sacrificed to love her
[30:52] in Galatians 2 20.
[30:55] he says I am crucified with Christ
[30:58] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[31:00] liveth in me and the life which I now
[31:02] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[31:04] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[31:07] himself for me
[31:09] how do you know he loved you because he
[31:10] gave himself for you that that's the
[31:13] evidence of his love
[31:15] amen because we're going to start seeing
[31:17] true love I mean how do we discern true
[31:20] love amen there's so many things people
[31:22] say they love you and they love this and
[31:24] they love that and they love all
[31:25] everything how are we going to discern
[31:26] what's true love how are we going to
[31:28] even judge ourselves what we're really
[31:29] loving remember the first step is true
[31:32] love is sacrificial
[31:38] let's look at Second Corinthians 8
[31:40] together let's go there together I got
[31:42] several scriptures I want to turn to and
[31:44] there is so there's hundreds literally
[31:46] hundreds of scriptures we could read on
[31:47] this but I just pulled one here and
[31:49] there just to paint a picture
[31:52] and maybe we'll grab more of them as we
[31:53] go on and preaching this but for tonight
[31:55] we're just going to grab a few
[31:59] in second Corinthians chapter 8 verse 9.
[32:06] in verse 9 he says for you know the
[32:08] grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that
[32:09] though he was rich yet for your sakes he
[32:12] became poor
[32:13] that he through his poverty might be
[32:16] rich
[32:17] This Is Love
[32:19] This Is Love
[32:21] that he came down so you could go up
[32:25] that he but he he he gave up richness
[32:29] for poverty so that you could have
[32:31] richness
[32:33] he gave up life he sacrificed his life
[32:36] to take death to taste death so that you
[32:39] don't have to live and under the curse
[32:41] of death so that you can taste life
[32:45] his love is sacrificial
[32:48] and and here we can begin to see the
[32:52] difference between the love true love
[32:54] versus false love true love is
[32:57] sacrificial false love is self-love
[33:02] false love always holds self at the
[33:05] center of love
[33:07] and even if there's an object of love
[33:10] I hope I can explain this
[33:13] true love versus this not true love
[33:17] I want to call it a false love but only
[33:19] the eyes of God's a false love it's a
[33:21] true human love
[33:22] to genuine emotional human love but it's
[33:25] not the true love of God
[33:28] amen but this this this human love
[33:31] always holds self at the center of love
[33:36] because even if there's an object that
[33:39] this love is directed towards that
[33:42] object that this love is being showered
[33:44] on it only is receiving the love because
[33:47] of the benefit to the lover
[33:49] yes yes
[33:51] because of a way that makes the lover
[33:54] feel the way that it makes the lover the
[33:56] enthusiasm the excitement the passion
[33:59] amen whatever amen whatever this love is
[34:02] directed towards it's directed that way
[34:04] because amen of a self-love
[34:08] so it looks like love is given amen but
[34:10] really amen it's a self-love
[34:14] but not so with true love with true love
[34:17] amen the the love is directed to the
[34:20] recipient of love amen and that's who
[34:22] the love is for
[34:25] amen
[34:27] brother Brown says in the thyatarian
[34:29] church age in the church age book he
[34:31] said I want to give a warning right here
[34:33] it says concerning the last day that
[34:35] because of the of abounding iniquity the
[34:38] love of many will wax cold in the
[34:40] laodice in her last age self-love
[34:43] and love for material things will take
[34:45] the place of the true love of God
[34:48] so what will take the place of the true
[34:49] love of God self-love this is the false
[34:52] love and the love of material things
[34:55] amen so God is setting for us an example
[35:00] and in this example now he because of
[35:04] the Fall it gives God the opportunity to
[35:07] come and demonstrate true love so that
[35:10] we now know what love is and now amen
[35:14] now we can go and repeat that and
[35:16] replicate love now we know how to act in
[35:19] love because this is how love Acts
[35:22] let's go to Ephesians chapter 5.
[35:30] Ephesians 5 and 25.
[35:37] Ephesians 5 25 says husbands love your
[35:41] wives even as Christ also love the
[35:42] church and gave himself for it
[35:46] so now he's telling husbands now you
[35:48] replicate This Love
[35:50] now you repeat now you love your wives
[35:53] now he's saying love your wife not just
[35:56] with merely a passion and an emotion and
[35:58] a feeling but you love your life the way
[36:01] Christ loved the church and gave himself
[36:03] forward the evidence of a true love for
[36:05] wife is a self-sacrificing love where
[36:08] the husband sacrifices himself for her
[36:12] that's love
[36:15] that's genuine true love
[36:18] amen
[36:20] that's why selfishness in marriage is a
[36:23] curse amen it's the destruction of
[36:25] marriage when you find divorce in
[36:27] marriage if you trace it back you will
[36:29] always find selfishness
[36:32] because true love is sacrificial and you
[36:34] have two people sacrificing for one
[36:36] another and preferring one another over
[36:37] themselves you're not going to have a
[36:40] broken home or a broken marriage if
[36:41] you're struggling in marriage somebody's
[36:44] being selfish
[36:47] amen
[36:49] so so it's the wrong kind of love
[36:52] now brother Franco if you could pull up
[36:53] the white board I want to write
[36:55] something down quickly before we move on
[36:58] because I want to write down two little
[37:00] phrases and I want to hold it on the
[37:01] Whiteboard and hold it in our minds and
[37:03] hopefully you'll be able to read my
[37:04] writing but I'll read to you what I
[37:05] write so that you know what I wrote and
[37:08] hopefully you get time to write it down
[37:09] yourselves
[37:10] so first I want to I want to contrast
[37:13] True Love with a perverted love
[37:16] now we know Humanity has been perverted
[37:18] the spirit we have is a carnal Spirit
[37:20] our flesh is hybrid amen our human love
[37:23] is a perverted love
[37:25] but God's love is a true love
[37:27] so I want to say like this
[37:36] true love
[38:12] hope I got this right
[38:15] true love will sacrifice the lover for
[38:18] the benefit of the loved
[38:20] amen that's genuine true Godly love
[38:23] that's the love that God demonstrated
[38:25] for us
[38:27] true love will sacrifice the lover the
[38:30] one who's giving the love
[38:32] will sacrifice the lover for the benefit
[38:34] of the loved
[38:36] so you can probably already guess what
[38:38] perverted love is
[38:43] perverted love
[38:52] will sacrifice
[38:54] who
[38:57] it'll sacrifice the loved
[39:01] for
[39:06] the benefit
[39:09] of
[39:11] the lover
[39:14] this is a perverted love
[39:17] this is the kind of love most of the
[39:19] world has
[39:22] a perverted love will sacrifice
[39:25] the loved the one I'm directing my love
[39:28] to
[39:29] for the benefit of the one who's giving
[39:30] life
[39:32] that's a perverted love
[39:34] but the world is full of this love
[39:38] and the genuine love of God is very rare
[39:43] amen which is a sacrificial love
[39:46] amen I want to look at just a couple
[39:48] examples in the Bible just I want to
[39:50] contrast this and then go forward let's
[39:53] go to second Samuel together there is
[39:56] example after example after example in
[39:58] the Bible but I just want to grab these
[40:00] two really quickly
[40:03] second Samuel
[40:06] chapter 13.
[40:17] second Samuel chapter 13 verse 1.
[40:27] it came to pass after this
[40:29] that Absalom the son of David had a fair
[40:31] sister whose name was Tamar and amnon
[40:34] the son of David loved her so amnon and
[40:37] Absalom have different mothers
[40:39] but same Father David
[40:41] amnon is in love with Tamar
[40:45] all right in verse two and amnon was
[40:48] very vexed that fell sick for his sister
[40:50] Tamar for she was a virgin and amnon
[40:53] thought it hard for him to do anything
[40:55] to her Ben amnon had a friend whose name
[40:57] was Jonah dab the son of shimmyi David's
[41:01] brother and Jonah dad was a very subtle
[41:03] man and he said unto him why art thou
[41:06] being the King's son lean from day to
[41:07] day wilt thou not tell me and amnon said
[41:11] unto him I love Tamar my brother
[41:13] absalom's sister
[41:15] and Jonah dab said unto him lay thee
[41:17] down on the bed and make thyself sick
[41:19] and when thy father cometh to see thee
[41:21] saying to him I pray that he let my
[41:22] sister Tamar come and give me Meep and
[41:24] dress the meat in my sight and I may see
[41:26] it and eat it at her hand so now this
[41:29] subtle friend amen who he comes up with
[41:32] a plan where he can lure Tamar into his
[41:36] into his Abode into his home and into
[41:38] his bed chamber amen because he says I
[41:41] love Tamar
[41:43] so he loves Tamar but we're going to
[41:45] find out whether he was a genuine true
[41:47] love or a false love
[41:49] but he claims that he loves her let's go
[41:52] over to verse 11.
[41:54] it says and when she had brought them
[41:55] into him to eat brought some cake she
[41:57] had baked into him to eat he took hold
[41:59] of her and said unto her come lie with
[42:01] me my sister
[42:02] and she answered him name my brother do
[42:04] not force me for no such thing ought to
[42:06] be done in Israel do not thou this Folly
[42:09] and I wither shall I cause my shame to
[42:12] go how will the shame go away from me
[42:15] and as for thee Thou shalt be as one of
[42:17] the fools in Israel now therefore I pray
[42:19] thee speak unto the king for he will not
[42:21] withhold me from thee albeit he would
[42:24] not hearken under her voice but being
[42:26] stronger than she forced her and lay
[42:28] with her
[42:29] then amnon hated her exceedingly
[42:33] he just said he loved her
[42:36] now he got what he he got what he loved
[42:39] he said he loved her
[42:41] but who did he really love
[42:43] himself
[42:45] and as soon as himself got what he loved
[42:48] now he hated her
[42:50] so he never loved her he only loved
[42:54] himself
[42:55] now this is what he says that what goes
[42:57] on then amnon hated her exceedingly so
[43:01] that the hatred wherewith he hated her
[43:02] was greater than the love wherewith he
[43:04] had loved her and amnon said unto her
[43:07] arise and be gone and she said unto him
[43:09] there is no cause this evil in sending
[43:12] me away is greater than the other that
[43:13] thou did to me but he would not hearken
[43:16] unto her then he called his servant that
[43:18] ministered to him and said put now this
[43:20] woman out for me and Bolt the door after
[43:23] her
[43:24] this man never had one drop of true love
[43:28] for her
[43:29] he had a passionate lustful desire and
[43:32] he called it love
[43:34] and that's what the world operates on
[43:38] it amen am I not just sexual but lustful
[43:42] in all kinds of lustful ways amen lust
[43:44] for advancement lust for money Lust For
[43:46] popularity Lust For Whatever amen and
[43:49] and it's driving love but it's the false
[43:52] kind of love and this love doesn't love
[43:54] the recipient this love though it
[43:57] showered upon somebody this love is only
[44:00] for the lover
[44:01] not for the recipient
[44:04] and amnon he did something so wicked and
[44:07] so evil and and and Tamar said don't do
[44:10] this thing she begins to implore him and
[44:13] says speak to the king he will not
[44:15] withhold thee from me amen there was
[44:17] there's even a proper way to go about
[44:19] this but he didn't want it he was so
[44:20] impassioned
[44:23] that he forced his sister and
[44:25] immediately he now hated her
[44:28] and she she said don't send me away for
[44:32] that would be worse than what you did
[44:34] before
[44:37] but he wouldn't hear her because he
[44:38] didn't love her
[44:41] now this is a perfect example of what we
[44:43] wrote down here true love will sacrifice
[44:44] the lover for the benefit of the love
[44:48] but a perverted love will sacrifice the
[44:50] love for the benefit of the lover
[44:54] does this make sense
[44:56] so now we see this happens all the time
[44:59] amen young women fall prey to this over
[45:02] and over and over and over because a man
[45:04] will shower affection say he loves you
[45:06] write poetry about you and all of this
[45:08] amen and really what he loves is himself
[45:11] but what he wants is he wants to touch
[45:12] you he wants the feeling that he feels
[45:15] around you he's excited amen and any man
[45:18] any man who will take away your
[45:20] virginity loves himself more than he
[45:22] loves you
[45:24] because if he loved you with the true
[45:27] Godly love amen he would sacrifice his
[45:30] passions for you amen amen but when he
[45:33] sacrifices you for his passions it shows
[45:36] he's not come to the right level of love
[45:39] right and so we say God help us die to
[45:43] the false perverted love and have the
[45:45] true love this is God
[45:47] this comes from the Devil
[45:50] amen
[45:52] so we see this story
[45:54] in Tamar
[45:56] so this is I mean this plays out over
[46:00] and over and over and over again in the
[46:04] day and age we live in I'm not just
[46:05] talking sexual dishes plays out all the
[46:07] time
[46:09] amen
[46:11] you know how many times you you is
[46:16] anybody ever don't raise your hands but
[46:18] this is just is anybody here ever been
[46:20] manipulated by somebody yes
[46:23] and they'll act like your friend
[46:25] I guess you oh yes you don't have to
[46:27] raise your hand
[46:29] still follows instructions
[46:34] somebody will feign to be a friend and
[46:37] to love you
[46:39] because they want some information
[46:42] it's funny how often when a when a young
[46:45] girl or a young boy is interested in
[46:46] another one all of a sudden they become
[46:48] good friends with their brother or
[46:50] sister of the one they're interested in
[46:55] and also their best buds
[46:58] and then it all comes out you really
[47:00] like my sister you really like my
[47:02] brother
[47:03] and then we'll find out whether it's a
[47:05] true lover or not if it continues on
[47:06] after you get the brother after you get
[47:08] the sister
[47:09] I mean that's childish teenage things
[47:11] that happen but it happens to adults too
[47:14] where somebody will feign to love you
[47:16] Fame to be a friend and what they want
[47:18] is a piece of information or they want a
[47:20] position or they want to get closer to
[47:22] something or learn something or obtain
[47:24] something and then after a while when it
[47:27] works out or does it work out then they
[47:29] abandon the friendship and all the love
[47:31] and all the text and all the phone calls
[47:33] and all the attention that you got you
[47:35] don't get anymore because this person
[47:37] never really had a genuine love for you
[47:39] they had a perverted love because there
[47:41] was something they were looking to gain
[47:43] out of the relationship
[47:45] and when they gained it or failed to
[47:47] gain it they dumped the relationship
[47:50] because they never really loved you
[47:55] right so we have lived through this
[47:57] all of us have lived through this
[47:59] because we live in a fallen world
[48:01] but this is how we discern life no
[48:04] matter how often somebody says I love
[48:05] you I love you I love you amen if they
[48:07] never sacrifice for you they don't love
[48:10] you
[48:12] if there's no sacrifice for the object
[48:15] of their love it's not a true love amen
[48:17] if all they ever do is say I love you I
[48:19] love you I love you and they they
[48:21] sacrifice the one they're loving and
[48:24] continually Rob from them for themselves
[48:26] that is a perverted love and not God's
[48:29] love and you can discern it right off
[48:31] the bat
[48:32] but it's so confusing in the emotional
[48:34] Realms and you get so entangled
[48:36] emotionally into things amen when we
[48:39] just look at God's love and back up a
[48:40] little bit and say is this how God loves
[48:43] or is this how the devil manipulates
[48:44] people with emotion
[48:48] amen then we can begin to discern love
[48:52] let's look at First Kings
[48:54] chapter 3.
[48:57] we know the story well we're not going
[48:58] to read the whole thing we're just going
[48:59] to read a few verses here
[49:02] First Kings chapter 3.
[49:17] that's why I say
[49:18] I'm on timeout I'm not reading this yet
[49:20] don't read ahead please you'll you'll
[49:22] hurt my feelings all kinds of ways
[49:26] but young sisters if that young brother
[49:29] wants to court she wants to talk to you
[49:31] and he is constantly pushing the
[49:34] boundaries Beyond where you're
[49:35] comfortable and violating the
[49:36] Commandment of your father
[49:38] I would question whether he loves you or
[49:40] not
[49:43] because if he's got a Godly love for you
[49:46] he will be able to sacrifice himself
[49:48] regardless of how impassioned he is
[49:52] he will sacrifice himself for you if
[49:55] he's got a Godly love for you
[49:58] all right
[49:59] and so I would let that be a judge I
[50:02] mean I if if somebody's trying to
[50:04] constantly circumvent the boundary and
[50:06] constantly push the lines and and wants
[50:09] to touch you and you don't want to be
[50:10] touched and wants to have a private
[50:11] conversation when you're not ready to
[50:12] have a private conversation or whatever
[50:14] is happening amen and you ask him not to
[50:16] and they continue to do it or your
[50:18] father told them not that they continue
[50:19] to do it I would I would look at that
[50:22] and say this person says they love me
[50:24] they write nice poems about me they sung
[50:26] me a beautiful song but they don't love
[50:27] me
[50:29] and I'm telling you if they if they do
[50:31] that to you in courtship your marriage
[50:33] is not going to be pleasant
[50:35] because you're going to enter into a
[50:37] marriage with somebody that loves
[50:39] themselves more than they love you and
[50:41] you're going to have a horrible marriage
[50:44] amen amen
[50:47] so so we need to discern love
[50:51] we need to discern love
[50:55] so now we're in the First Kings chapter
[50:57] 3 verse 16.
[51:06] all right
[51:07] King Solomon the wisest King that Israel
[51:10] knew until Christ Jesus
[51:13] he says and then came there are two
[51:14] women that were harlots into the king
[51:16] and stood before him and the one woman
[51:18] said oh my Lord I and this woman dwell
[51:20] in one house and I was delivered of a
[51:22] child with her in the house and it came
[51:24] to pass the third day after I was
[51:25] delivered that this woman was delivered
[51:27] also we were together there was no
[51:30] stranger with us in the house save me we
[51:32] too in the house and This Woman's child
[51:34] died in the night because she overlaid
[51:36] it and she arose at midnight and took my
[51:38] son from beside me while thy handmaid
[51:40] slept and laid it in the bosom and later
[51:42] dead child in my bosom then in front of
[51:45] Sodom and he began to argue back and
[51:46] forth no it's my child no it's my child
[51:48] I know it's my child so Solomon with
[51:50] discernment
[51:52] he comes down here we'll drop down to
[51:55] verse 24. and the King said bring me a
[51:58] sword and they brought a sword before
[52:00] the king and the King said divide the
[52:02] living child in two and give half to the
[52:04] one and half to the other then speak the
[52:06] woman who the living child was and to
[52:08] the king for her bows yearned upon her
[52:11] son and she said oh my Lord give her the
[52:13] living child and in no I slay it but the
[52:16] other said Let It Be neither mine nor
[52:18] thine but divide it then the king
[52:21] answered and said give her the living
[52:22] child and know why slay it she is the
[52:25] mother thereof
[52:26] this this wise Solomon with discernment
[52:29] he recognized right off the one that was
[52:32] willing to sacrifice herself for the
[52:35] object of love was the True Mother
[52:38] had the natural affection the other
[52:40] didn't have the natural affection she
[52:42] says divide it let it be neither mind
[52:43] nor her amen so so so even in the
[52:47] natural realm Solomon was able to
[52:48] discern the natural affection of a
[52:51] mother amen because she was able to
[52:53] sacrifice
[52:55] amen I say God help us to have God's
[53:00] love
[53:01] and let it be demonstrated in my life
[53:03] that I have a love that will sacrifice
[53:06] that will well I will sacrifice myself
[53:09] for the object of my love
[53:11] amen
[53:14] that's why
[53:16] children get so messed up
[53:19] when they're not loved in this kind of
[53:21] love
[53:23] when they're constantly manipulated
[53:25] when they're constantly pressured to
[53:28] perform when a mother or a father amen
[53:32] when a mother or a father is pushing
[53:34] their child to make some sort of
[53:36] achievement
[53:37] or goal because the parents are now
[53:41] proud
[53:43] of my son's academic scholarship or
[53:46] prowess on the football field or they
[53:49] can hit a ball and we push them Beyond
[53:51] where they want to be push them I've
[53:53] seen kids pushed until because I grew up
[53:55] in Little League Men playing little
[53:56] league ball parents yelling at their
[53:58] kids at the car why didn't you get that
[54:00] why didn't you make that play we
[54:01] practiced that before and putting a ton
[54:03] of pressure on this kid you think why
[54:05] it's little league baseball
[54:08] because the Dad loved himself more than
[54:11] he loved this boy
[54:13] because the dad when the boy hit the
[54:15] Home Run That's my boy I taught him hey
[54:17] Manny
[54:19] chip off the old block just like his dad
[54:21] and now dad is living through the Sun
[54:23] and gaining some sort of notoriety some
[54:25] sort of something amen the dad amen has
[54:29] not sacrificed himself for the love of
[54:31] that boy he's sacrificing the object of
[54:33] his love for himself
[54:35] mom will do it too by dressing up her
[54:37] girl and making her the prettiest and
[54:39] posting stuff on social media amen why
[54:41] because Mom's living through the girl
[54:46] amen
[54:47] it sounds like it's far away but it
[54:49] creeps in pretty close amen I want the
[54:51] spirit of discernment to say that's not
[54:53] right amen that's not what I want amen I
[54:56] want to take all the hits for my kids I
[54:58] want to stand in the front and absorb it
[54:59] all and let them go
[55:02] like that's all right son you'll get
[55:03] them next time
[55:06] because I don't want to sacrifice the
[55:08] ones I love
[55:11] amen I want to sacrifice myself for the
[55:14] ones I love
[55:15] right
[55:17] so when kids grow up they're not able to
[55:20] put their finger on what the problem is
[55:23] that the children and spouses and the
[55:25] individuals and organizations and groups
[55:28] of people they're not able to discern
[55:30] it's so confusing because of the words
[55:32] and the emotions and it gets all tangled
[55:34] up amen they're not able to what is this
[55:36] that makes me feel so filthy when I'm
[55:39] when I'm encountered this person why do
[55:41] I feel so terrible after this they say
[55:43] they love me but I feel horrible
[55:46] when a when a mother or father gets up
[55:48] in age and they keep putting pressure on
[55:50] their kids you never call me you never
[55:52] come and see me you never you never you
[55:54] never Hey listen it's a that's a form of
[55:57] manipulation trying to get your kids to
[55:59] make you feel good about yourself
[56:03] and the kids want to stay away and don't
[56:05] know why because Mom's saying I love you
[56:07] so much and I miss you so bad and then
[56:08] laying guilt trips on you
[56:12] that's not true love
[56:15] true love gives
[56:17] first gives most gives when nothing's in
[56:20] return
[56:23] that's God's love God gave when when
[56:26] when when when nobody had to give back
[56:30] God gave when nobody can match what he
[56:33] gave he gave the most he gave the best
[56:35] he gave first and he gave without a
[56:38] guarantee of return
[56:40] that's true love
[56:43] anything else amen begins to manipulate
[56:46] is a perverted love and holds the lover
[56:49] as the center of their love
[56:53] so now we can begin to discern ourselves
[56:55] yes and discern the people around us
[56:58] and discern why they say they love me
[57:00] but I don't feel it
[57:02] all the words are good but the actions
[57:05] don't match the words
[57:07] and now we've suffered and struggled
[57:09] under these things for years and it gets
[57:12] all twisted up and then you've got a
[57:13] manipulated manipulative family member
[57:16] you know what it's like to be all
[57:17] twisted up emotionally and not able to
[57:20] discern what is this that's so ah I want
[57:23] to get away from them but I love them
[57:25] and they love me but I can't stand to be
[57:27] around them and every time they call I
[57:29] don't want to answer the call
[57:31] [Music]
[57:34] if we want
[57:36] people to love us
[57:38] then we need the love of God should have
[57:40] brought in our hearts
[57:41] and we need to give love
[57:43] when there's not a promise of it
[57:45] returning amen
[57:46] we need to give more
[57:48] than they're able to give back we need
[57:50] to give because when God gave that way
[57:52] what did God get God got a love slave
[57:55] and Paul Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[57:58] Bound by chains of love not by laws not
[58:01] by rules but but Paul by love because
[58:04] God loved him first God loved him most
[58:07] God loved him when he was unlovable now
[58:09] Paul loved God back
[58:12] and what God got from Paul was a
[58:15] devotion was was his whole life his
[58:17] whole heart he got what did God get God
[58:20] got back what he gave
[58:22] and if we want people to love us our
[58:24] children and other ones we have to give
[58:26] this kind of love
[58:28] then when we give that love amen it
[58:30] unlocks something in the recipient so
[58:33] that they can give that kind of Love
[58:34] Back God unlocked love for you and I
[58:39] so that we could receive his spirit and
[58:41] we could love him back the right way
[58:44] there's also an emotional kind of love
[58:46] for God where people say I love God I
[58:48] love God I love God Amen but they won't
[58:50] do the simple things that God said do
[58:53] and it shows that there's no love
[58:55] because although you say you love God
[58:57] Amen you love The God Who heals you you
[59:01] love The God Who blesses you you love
[59:03] The God Who Died For You amen that's a
[59:06] self-centered love
[59:08] and all of those things are true he
[59:10] loved me he died for me amen I love him
[59:13] so much but if I love him so much and I
[59:16] won't do what he asked me to do it shows
[59:18] that I am not offering to him a
[59:21] sacrificial love
[59:23] because my love to God must also be a
[59:25] sacrificial love
[59:27] not just asking God to sacrifice you die
[59:29] for me you deliver me you heal me you
[59:32] heal me but when God says do this and
[59:34] don't do that now I'm willing to die to
[59:37] myself because my love for him that I
[59:39] will sacrifice me for the object of my
[59:42] love
[59:43] I will sacrifice my idea my want my
[59:46] desire My Passion I'll lay it on the
[59:48] altar because I love him
[59:51] see it goes both ways
[59:53] people claim they love God write songs
[59:56] about love and God sing about loving God
[59:57] but their actions prove they love
[59:59] themselves
[1:00:04] let's go to first John 4 17.
[1:00:24] first John 4 17.
[1:00:32] verse 19.
[1:00:34] we love him because he first loved us
[1:00:39] If any man say I love God and hateth his
[1:00:41] brother he is a liar
[1:00:45] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[1:00:47] he has seen how can he love God whom he
[1:00:49] hath not seen
[1:00:51] and this commandment have we from him
[1:00:53] that he who loveth God
[1:00:55] love with his brother
[1:00:57] also
[1:00:59] so we see that
[1:01:00] we love God we love him because he first
[1:01:03] love up loved us let's back up to verse
[1:01:05] 17 and catch some of this ahead of this
[1:01:07] herein is our love made perfect that we
[1:01:09] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:01:11] because as he is so are we in the world
[1:01:15] amen there is no fear in love but
[1:01:18] perfect love cast out fear because fear
[1:01:20] hath torment he that feareth is not made
[1:01:22] perfect in love so perfect love takes
[1:01:26] away fear
[1:01:27] when God demonstrated this kind of love
[1:01:30] amen he gave us the ability to break
[1:01:32] free from Fear because God demonstrated
[1:01:35] his love while we were yet unlovable and
[1:01:38] then you see yourself as the objects of
[1:01:40] God's love and you see God he never
[1:01:43] asked you to sacrifice for his love he
[1:01:47] said because I love you I will sacrifice
[1:01:49] myself for for because I love you
[1:01:54] amen God's not saying I love you
[1:01:57] see if you can do it better
[1:02:00] I love you
[1:02:01] come and get my love
[1:02:04] I love you
[1:02:06] see if you can get up here and be worthy
[1:02:09] of my love
[1:02:11] that's not love
[1:02:14] but he proved that he loved us
[1:02:16] when he made himself a sacrifice
[1:02:19] to take our sin on him and all of our
[1:02:22] iniquities and sin and shame was placed
[1:02:24] on him and he became his own sacrifice
[1:02:27] and he sacrificed for his love
[1:02:32] all right so that we could go free
[1:02:35] so now what kind of love do I give him
[1:02:38] if I'm going to give him a true genuine
[1:02:40] love it must also be sacrificial love
[1:02:43] amen praise God
[1:02:45] not just asking God to sacrifice for me
[1:02:47] but me willing to sacrifice for him John
[1:02:51] 14 15 Jesus said if you love me keep my
[1:02:54] Commandments
[1:02:56] Jesus is not saying if you keep my
[1:02:57] Commandments I'll love you
[1:02:59] Jesus already said he loved them
[1:03:02] he already proved that he loved them and
[1:03:04] God's love now is not in question God's
[1:03:06] just now showing you a discernment for
[1:03:08] your love if you love me keep my
[1:03:10] Commandments
[1:03:12] because why if you keep your
[1:03:14] Commandments it requires death to self
[1:03:16] if you live in the flesh
[1:03:18] and sacrificing yourself shows that you
[1:03:21] really do love God
[1:03:24] this is what this is what Saul could not
[1:03:27] do Saul was anointed to be king amen but
[1:03:31] Saul could not sacrifice himself to keep
[1:03:34] the Commandments he kept failing in the
[1:03:36] Commandments amen and there was a time
[1:03:38] that Samuel was going to come to him to
[1:03:39] offer a sacrifice and after seven days
[1:03:41] Samuel didn't show up amen and
[1:03:43] he had him bring a sacrifice and he
[1:03:46] slayed the sacrifice himself and
[1:03:48] immediately when he's done Samuel shows
[1:03:49] up and this is in the book of First
[1:03:51] Samuel 13. and he says what have you
[1:03:53] done he says I saw that you delayed in
[1:03:56] coming I saw that the people were far
[1:03:58] from me and I was afraid that the
[1:04:00] Philistines would come and listen all of
[1:04:03] that has to do with Saul
[1:04:05] the people were far from me I wanted to
[1:04:07] draw the people to me Philistines were
[1:04:09] coming after me I was afraid to lose the
[1:04:10] battle you hadn't come to me me me me me
[1:04:13] me me so I was forced to do this
[1:04:16] contrary to the Commandment to preserve
[1:04:18] myself
[1:04:23] that's when that's when Samuel said the
[1:04:26] kingdom will be rent from you given to a
[1:04:28] better
[1:04:29] God will choose a man after his own
[1:04:32] heart
[1:04:34] which is David what made David after his
[1:04:36] own heart it wasn't that David would
[1:04:38] never fail because David's failures
[1:04:40] would be equal sometimes to the failures
[1:04:42] of Saul
[1:04:44] terrible failures
[1:04:46] but there was a difference between David
[1:04:48] and Saul if you contrast these two Saul
[1:04:51] loved himself more than he loved God
[1:04:53] David loved God more than he loved
[1:04:55] himself and even in David's failures
[1:04:58] when when when the prophet would come
[1:04:59] and call him out he would say I sinned
[1:05:02] amen he would repent he would lay on his
[1:05:04] face amen he he would deny himself for
[1:05:07] the word of God and when he failed to
[1:05:09] deny himself he would repent
[1:05:12] Saul never really repented he was just
[1:05:15] sorry for the consequences
[1:05:19] so uh
[1:05:23] I want to look at this in in first
[1:05:25] Samuel 15 let's turn together and just
[1:05:27] look at this for just a second
[1:05:32] remember we're Discerning true love
[1:05:35] and we want the word to discern us and
[1:05:37] discern the situations around us
[1:05:40] brother Branham says in the message
[1:05:41] Christ is revealed on his own word but
[1:05:43] the Christian the church what I'm
[1:05:45] talking to this morning the law of God
[1:05:47] is in your heart you have no desire to
[1:05:49] do it inside here you want to keep God's
[1:05:52] law so perfect no matter what it is you
[1:05:54] want to be just what if God needs a
[1:05:56] doormat at the door he wants you to be
[1:05:58] that doorman Norman you're so happy to
[1:06:01] be that
[1:06:02] he's talking about genuine love the love
[1:06:05] of God in your heart if God wants you to
[1:06:07] be a doormat you're not going to ask him
[1:06:08] to make you a singer or make you a
[1:06:10] songwriter or make you a deacon or a
[1:06:11] preacher if God says I want you to be a
[1:06:13] doormat that's what you want to be
[1:06:14] that's true love
[1:06:19] he said whatever God wants you to do
[1:06:21] that's what you want to do because it's
[1:06:23] God now that's where you really find
[1:06:25] your real genuine true love for God
[1:06:30] now let's look at first Samuel 15 24.
[1:06:41] and Saul said unto Samuel I have sinned
[1:06:43] for I have transgressed the Commandment
[1:06:44] of the Lord and thy words because I
[1:06:47] feared the people and obeyed their voice
[1:06:49] this looks like a repentance but it's
[1:06:51] not a repentance
[1:06:55] now therefore I pray thee pardon my sin
[1:06:57] and turn again with me that I may
[1:06:58] Worship the Lord and Samuel said unto
[1:07:00] Saul I will not return with thee for
[1:07:02] thou has rejected the word of the Lord
[1:07:03] and the lord of the rejected thee from
[1:07:05] being King over Israel let's go down to
[1:07:07] verse 30. then he said I have sinned yet
[1:07:10] honor me now I pray thee before the
[1:07:12] Elders of my people and before Israel
[1:07:14] and turn again with me that I may
[1:07:16] Worship the Lord thy God
[1:07:18] this is no genuine love of God and true
[1:07:21] repentance amen this is a man who wants
[1:07:24] to save face in front of the elders amen
[1:07:26] and still wants to look good and hold
[1:07:27] his position says Saul loves himself
[1:07:34] but David has a different nature
[1:07:37] this reminds me in Matthew 23 verse 5
[1:07:41] Jesus is speaking now the Pharisees he
[1:07:44] says but all their Works they do for to
[1:07:45] be seen of men
[1:07:47] they make broader phylacteries they
[1:07:49] enlarge the borders of their garments
[1:07:51] they love the uppermost rooms that feast
[1:07:53] in the chief seats and the synagogues
[1:07:54] and greetings in the markets and to be
[1:07:56] called meant by of men Rabbi Rabbi these
[1:07:59] men look like they love God but they
[1:08:01] really love themselves and they go
[1:08:03] through all of these uh rituals and all
[1:08:06] of these laws and all of this stuff so
[1:08:08] that they can prove to the people that
[1:08:10] they love God but really Jesus is
[1:08:12] Discerning their love they don't love
[1:08:15] God they love themselves they love the
[1:08:18] position it puts them in the esteem that
[1:08:20] they get from people in the respect
[1:08:21] that's what they're loving and
[1:08:23] unfortunately and sadly this is what
[1:08:26] religion is really like
[1:08:29] people are religious for all kinds of
[1:08:31] reasons amen but the number one reason
[1:08:34] for religion is that people love
[1:08:36] themselves because it serves them
[1:08:38] somehow
[1:08:39] their religion is serving them somehow
[1:08:42] and whatever they get out of it amen
[1:08:44] either clear from a guilty conscience or
[1:08:46] respect from somebody or love from a
[1:08:49] family member whatever reason they'll
[1:08:51] dive into religion Amen in this religion
[1:08:54] amen looks like they love God but really
[1:08:57] they love themselves
[1:08:59] true yeah
[1:09:02] this is why no matter how much you show
[1:09:04] the truth of the word to people they
[1:09:06] won't leave their religion
[1:09:08] because the relief the religion would
[1:09:10] cause a personal sacrifice
[1:09:11] they would have to sacrifice themselves
[1:09:14] to leave their tradition
[1:09:16] and in leaving the tradition they would
[1:09:17] lose Association
[1:09:19] they would lose respect they would look
[1:09:21] bad in the eyes of people they would
[1:09:22] look like a heretic or you're following
[1:09:24] a false prophet or or you're mixed up
[1:09:26] with a cult you're you're this you're
[1:09:28] that you're the other and people won't
[1:09:30] leave the religion because the religion
[1:09:33] is serving self
[1:09:35] no matter how much you show baptism in
[1:09:38] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right
[1:09:39] out of the word no matter how much you
[1:09:41] show them amen that the trinitarian idea
[1:09:44] is wrong no matter how much you show by
[1:09:46] the word they can see it amen they will
[1:09:49] agree with you and then when they go to
[1:09:51] their Pastor or go to their church and
[1:09:52] they're going to be rejected for that
[1:09:54] word they reject the word and stay with
[1:09:57] the religion
[1:10:04] perverted love
[1:10:06] and God was a perverted love
[1:10:10] but a pure love would say if that's the
[1:10:13] truth
[1:10:14] if that's the truth if that's what God
[1:10:16] Said Amen if that's what God wants and
[1:10:19] that's what God requires where can I get
[1:10:21] baptized
[1:10:24] amen all friends forsake you your church
[1:10:27] think you've gone off the deep end they
[1:10:28] no longer consider you a Christian they
[1:10:30] are no longer consider you in the way of
[1:10:32] Truth they've lost respect for
[1:10:34] co-workers lose respect but it doesn't
[1:10:36] matter because the recipient of my love
[1:10:38] is worth my personal sacrifice it's
[1:10:41] worth me losing my reputation losing my
[1:10:43] Association losing everything because
[1:10:45] the recipient of my love is worth My
[1:10:48] Sacrifice
[1:10:51] but if we're not willing to become the
[1:10:53] sacrifice then we don't love the object
[1:10:55] of our love we love ourselves
[1:10:58] it's Boomerang love
[1:11:01] I only give love because I want love
[1:11:08] praise God Amen
[1:11:11] so we see David had a different nature
[1:11:13] because of first Samuel 24 I just want
[1:11:16] to look at this quickly very briefly
[1:11:18] just pull out one nugget here
[1:11:20] first Samuel 24 and to set the stage
[1:11:23] David is running from place to place
[1:11:25] from stronghold to stronghold and hide
[1:11:26] out The Hideout because Saul is chasing
[1:11:28] after him to kill him because he knows
[1:11:30] God is with him David has done nothing
[1:11:32] against Saul but Saul hates David
[1:11:34] because Saul loves himself and David is
[1:11:37] a threat to himself
[1:11:39] and because he loves himself more than
[1:11:40] anybody in the world when David now is a
[1:11:43] threat to him he has to kill David
[1:11:46] to preserve his self-love
[1:11:48] Saul has no sacrificial love
[1:11:51] now David's in a cave
[1:11:54] Saul comes in lays himself down all of
[1:11:56] all of David's buddies are saying get
[1:11:58] him get him the Lord has delivered him
[1:12:00] into your hands but in first Samuel 24
[1:12:03] verse 4 here's what it says and the men
[1:12:05] of David said unto him behold the day
[1:12:07] which the Lord said unto thee behold I
[1:12:09] will deliver thine enemy unto thine hand
[1:12:11] that thou mayest due to him as it shall
[1:12:14] seem good unto thee then David arose and
[1:12:16] cut off the skirt of Saul's robe
[1:12:18] privately and Saul was asleep he just
[1:12:20] went over there and he cut around the
[1:12:22] Hem of a skirt just a piece
[1:12:27] and it came to pass afterward that
[1:12:29] David's heart smote him because he had
[1:12:32] cut off Saul skirt
[1:12:34] and he said unto his men the Lord forbid
[1:12:37] that I should do this thing unto my
[1:12:38] master the Lord's anointed to stretch
[1:12:41] forth mine hand against him seeing he is
[1:12:43] Anointed of the Lord
[1:12:46] this man Saul was wrong
[1:12:49] he was wrong in every way
[1:12:52] he was trying to kill David David had
[1:12:54] done nothing wrong he had deceived David
[1:12:56] he had manipulated David he had tried to
[1:12:58] trick David he had done all kinds of
[1:13:00] things he was wrong in every way but but
[1:13:03] but David was not looking to the right
[1:13:05] and wrong of Saul he was looking above
[1:13:07] Saul to the god that had placed Saul
[1:13:09] there and that the anointing oil had
[1:13:12] poured over him and he said if God wants
[1:13:13] him there what right do I have to remove
[1:13:16] him
[1:13:17] right well right this should put fear in
[1:13:20] the hearts of people who want to split
[1:13:22] churches amen because if God will let it
[1:13:25] stand let it stand
[1:13:26] if God will let that Ministry stand no
[1:13:29] matter how wrong it is if God lets us
[1:13:30] stand let it stand don't go in there and
[1:13:32] break the thing up and split it up
[1:13:34] because if God's place it there to serve
[1:13:36] whatever purpose don't be found fighting
[1:13:38] against God no matter how wrong it is
[1:13:41] do you have to leave leave but don't
[1:13:43] break the thing up
[1:13:45] let God do it
[1:13:47] amen amen and this is what David David
[1:13:50] wasn't looking Saul hated him Saul
[1:13:52] became his enemy David had done nothing
[1:13:54] wrong to Saul when he when he cut the
[1:13:57] Hem of a skirt amen all of a sudden his
[1:13:59] heart smote him
[1:14:02] not because Saul was so sweet and loving
[1:14:04] and kind and he felt bad no he said how
[1:14:06] dare I touch the Lord's anointed amen
[1:14:09] this is what God has done now I'll be
[1:14:11] find myself against God
[1:14:13] and though he was mistreated he
[1:14:16] subjected himself
[1:14:18] to God's way
[1:14:22] when it came time for a change God made
[1:14:24] the change
[1:14:26] but David wasn't going to do it to save
[1:14:28] himself
[1:14:30] if he would have saw his life it
[1:14:33] seemingly would have been easier
[1:14:35] his troubles would have went away he was
[1:14:37] supposed to be King Saul was wrong he
[1:14:40] was right but he wouldn't go against God
[1:14:47] see that shows David had a another heart
[1:14:50] he was after God's Own Heart
[1:14:53] amen
[1:14:57] you know even
[1:14:58] listen even Michael
[1:15:01] when they were disputing over the body
[1:15:03] of Moses
[1:15:05] even the Archangel he told Satan he told
[1:15:09] Lucifer Satan he says he says the Lord
[1:15:12] deal with Thee
[1:15:13] he wouldn't even bring a railing
[1:15:15] accusation if God allowed this being to
[1:15:17] continue on not even Michael was going
[1:15:19] to make her bring a railing accusation
[1:15:23] it's amazing to me
[1:15:26] David's heart towards God
[1:15:31] and so so now
[1:15:33] the ability to sacrifice ourselves
[1:15:37] to the desire of God proves our love to
[1:15:39] God
[1:15:40] not not just works not legalism
[1:15:44] it's not just Pharisees they had that
[1:15:47] down and Jesus saw right through it
[1:15:50] all the works all the all the works all
[1:15:53] the great things they did they did it
[1:15:54] for show they did it to be seen they did
[1:15:56] it for some selfish reason some
[1:15:58] self-love reason and Jesus saw right
[1:16:00] through it not legalism but a real love
[1:16:03] of God that says if that's what God
[1:16:05] likes that's what I'll do
[1:16:08] brother Graham says in the thy entire
[1:16:10] church age I know your love service
[1:16:13] faith and patience
[1:16:15] you will note that their love is placed
[1:16:17] between works and service and that is
[1:16:19] the right place for it because without
[1:16:21] love our works are not accepted before
[1:16:24] God and neither is our service
[1:16:26] The Works are not accepted Without Love
[1:16:29] if we if we do the works with the wrong
[1:16:31] motive it's not accepted because we do
[1:16:33] it for ourselves
[1:16:35] to be seen of men or whatever reason
[1:16:37] amen but with love with genuine Godly
[1:16:40] love amen we serve God and sacrifice
[1:16:42] ourselves then our works are accepted
[1:16:45] so without love our works are not
[1:16:47] accepted before God and neither is our
[1:16:48] service Paul's speaking to Corinthians
[1:16:50] said with without love I am nothing and
[1:16:52] whatever I do is without profit unless
[1:16:55] it is done in love now you can see right
[1:16:57] here that these Believers weren't in
[1:16:59] that nicolaitan class that did works as
[1:17:01] a means of Salvation or to be admired by
[1:17:03] men they did their works out of the love
[1:17:06] of God that was shed abroad in their
[1:17:07] hearts by the Holy Ghost
[1:17:09] that love in their hearts was God's love
[1:17:11] for his own Jesus said by this shall all
[1:17:14] men know that you are my disciples that
[1:17:15] you have loved one for another the
[1:17:18] pagans who saw the lives of the early
[1:17:19] Christians says behold how they love
[1:17:21] each other
[1:17:23] listen the love that they had for each
[1:17:25] other was their love for God and it was
[1:17:27] God's love for his own it was the love
[1:17:28] of God she had abroad in their hearts
[1:17:30] this wasn't a human filial love
[1:17:34] the love of the Brethren isn't an
[1:17:36] emotional love it's got to go beyond an
[1:17:38] emotional love because your brother may
[1:17:40] not always be lovable
[1:17:44] it's got to be the love of God shed
[1:17:46] abroad in our hearts extended to our
[1:17:48] Brethren yes
[1:17:51] let's look at first John chapter 3
[1:17:52] together
[1:17:59] first John chapter 3 verse 14.
[1:18:04] if I can find it
[1:18:07] first John chapter 3.
[1:18:10] verse 14.
[1:18:12] we know that we have passed from death
[1:18:14] into life because we love the brethren
[1:18:17] look at this
[1:18:18] we know that we have passed from Death
[1:18:20] unto life because we love the brethren
[1:18:24] not Ophelia love
[1:18:26] but a true love
[1:18:28] we know that we have passed from Death
[1:18:30] in life because we love the Brethren
[1:18:31] this is why when you get mad at
[1:18:33] everybody around you and refuse to talk
[1:18:34] to all the Brethren and pull yourself
[1:18:36] away and
[1:18:39] I wonder what kind of love that is
[1:18:41] what made you mad
[1:18:43] you know your feelings hurt
[1:18:45] is that the love of God that's self-love
[1:18:49] I mean it's raw this is raw but it's
[1:18:51] right down to where we live amen they
[1:18:54] hurt my feelings they mistreated me they
[1:18:56] spoke about me I can't even go to that
[1:18:57] church I pull myself away I'm all by
[1:18:59] myself that's not the love of God
[1:19:02] the love of God will sacrifice self for
[1:19:05] others
[1:19:06] amen so the love of the Brethren is the
[1:19:08] love of God shed abroad in our hearts
[1:19:10] amen all right
[1:19:12] let's keep reading verse 14 we know that
[1:19:15] we have passed from death into life
[1:19:16] because we love the Brethren he that
[1:19:18] loveth not his brother abideth and death
[1:19:20] whosoever hate is his brother is a
[1:19:22] murderer and ye know that no murderer
[1:19:25] hath in eternal life abiding in him
[1:19:28] hereby perceive we the love of God
[1:19:30] because he laid down his life for us and
[1:19:34] we ought to lay down our lives for the
[1:19:36] brethren
[1:19:37] lay down our lives lay down hurt
[1:19:40] feelings
[1:19:42] misunderstandings
[1:19:46] this is the Bible
[1:19:48] straightforward raw hitting us all
[1:19:50] between the eyes
[1:19:52] this is life this is the love of God
[1:19:56] brother Branham says and dear God I've
[1:19:58] just tried to speak of love that you
[1:20:00] gave to your church it seems like that
[1:20:02] they've got caught up in the Miracles of
[1:20:03] the Bible they've caught up in the
[1:20:04] membership and the evangelism and the
[1:20:06] missionaries but Lord let them catch up
[1:20:08] with love now
[1:20:10] that'll set the church a fire with a
[1:20:12] real Agape of love with a real sacred
[1:20:14] love that could turn the cheek or the
[1:20:17] one that would be willing to lay down
[1:20:18] his life it would if it would mean to
[1:20:21] save others God give us that love in our
[1:20:23] hearts as we wait on me
[1:20:25] the Apostle Paul says he says my heart
[1:20:28] Bears witness that I have a great
[1:20:29] yearning in my heart that I would be
[1:20:32] accursed from Christ for the sake of my
[1:20:34] brother and the Jews
[1:20:37] that was the love of God in the Apostle
[1:20:39] Paul that wasn't human
[1:20:41] that was gone
[1:20:44] um
[1:20:45] amen let's look at John the Gospel of
[1:20:48] John John chapter 15. he's got a couple
[1:20:50] more scriptures I want to lay in and
[1:20:52] then we'll leave this subject for
[1:20:54] tonight
[1:20:56] John 15 verse 12.
[1:21:02] he said
[1:21:03] John 15 12. this is my commandment that
[1:21:06] you love one another as I have loved you
[1:21:08] how did Jesus love them was it an
[1:21:11] emotional love or agape love
[1:21:14] was it a love of personal sacrifice was
[1:21:17] it a love he endured a lot of things
[1:21:20] Jesus had to put up with a lot of
[1:21:23] immaturity in his disciples
[1:21:25] but he loved them because he had a
[1:21:27] higher life
[1:21:29] all right let's keep reading
[1:21:31] where am I John 15 12.
[1:21:34] this is my commandment that you love one
[1:21:36] another as I have loved you greater love
[1:21:39] hath no man than this than a man laid
[1:21:41] down his life for his friends
[1:21:45] Year my friends if you do whatsoever I
[1:21:47] command you
[1:21:50] amen no greater love has any man than
[1:21:53] this that he laid down his life for his
[1:21:56] friends why that's genuine love
[1:22:00] a sacrificial love
[1:22:04] Jesus said to the to the Pharisees in
[1:22:07] Luke 11 46 he says and he said woe unto
[1:22:10] you also you lawyers for you laid men
[1:22:12] with burdens Grievous to be born and ye
[1:22:15] yourselves touch not the burns with one
[1:22:17] of your fingers
[1:22:19] he says woe unto you you you you pack on
[1:22:22] extra traditions and extra rules and all
[1:22:24] of these things but you don't do
[1:22:26] anything to help your brethren amen that
[1:22:28] was the opposite of the Apostle Paul the
[1:22:30] Apostle Paul says I become all things to
[1:22:32] all that I might win some to the weak I
[1:22:34] become weak to the Jew I become Jew to
[1:22:36] the Gentile amen Paul was willing to
[1:22:39] lower himself not to add Burns he was
[1:22:42] willing to bear under their burdens
[1:22:45] because he had genuine love amen though
[1:22:47] the law though the the word gave him a
[1:22:50] right to collect tithe he would forego
[1:22:52] that in a new place so that he would not
[1:22:54] disrupt their faith and he would work
[1:22:56] with his own hands to support himself he
[1:22:58] had a right to the tithe but he didn't
[1:23:00] exercise his right because he loved them
[1:23:05] that was genuine love he wasn't making
[1:23:07] the object of his love serve him he was
[1:23:09] sacrificing himself to serve the object
[1:23:11] of his love
[1:23:12] man
[1:23:13] and you know what happened
[1:23:15] those that he loved and Macedonia
[1:23:19] they would cover
[1:23:21] because he loved them with a sacrificial
[1:23:23] love they were now returning his love
[1:23:25] with a sacrificial love and he never
[1:23:27] demanded it they gave it willingly
[1:23:30] amen love genuine love reciprocates we
[1:23:34] love him because he first loved us and
[1:23:37] when he loved us with a pure love he
[1:23:39] unlocked something in Us by the new
[1:23:42] birth that we can love him back amen
[1:23:44] with the pure love and when we love our
[1:23:46] brother and they can love us back amen
[1:23:48] when we sacrifice ourselves they can
[1:23:51] sacrifice themselves and this comes all
[1:23:53] the way down to their home when Mom and
[1:23:55] Dad can sacrifice themselves for their
[1:23:57] children you can find children who can
[1:23:59] sacrifice themselves for Mommy
[1:24:03] praise God when Mom and Dad are always
[1:24:07] sacrificing their children for
[1:24:08] themselves
[1:24:13] always putting the children out putting
[1:24:16] the children last making the children
[1:24:17] away doing for themselves and not for
[1:24:19] others being inconsiderate
[1:24:21] when you have parents who don't
[1:24:22] sacrifice themselves for their kids
[1:24:26] later in life you'll have kids who won't
[1:24:28] sacrifice themselves for their parents
[1:24:31] and these are the people who die alone
[1:24:33] in nursing homes
[1:24:39] but if we will pour ourselves out
[1:24:42] God will see to it that somebody else
[1:24:44] will pour themselves
[1:24:47] you don't get by demand you get by love
[1:24:51] you don't receive by manipulation
[1:24:53] that'll never work you may threaten you
[1:24:56] may deceive it may work in a while but
[1:24:58] there's no genuine love there there's
[1:24:59] guilt there's shame and mixed in there's
[1:25:02] frustration and anger and bitterness
[1:25:05] who wants a family like that
[1:25:07] who wants a church like that who wants a
[1:25:09] marriage like that nobody amen so how do
[1:25:12] we beat that I die
[1:25:14] and the ones that I love receive a
[1:25:16] sacrificial love
[1:25:18] amen and maybe I can unlock something in
[1:25:20] them that they can love me back
[1:25:23] when when when what Mom and Dad want
[1:25:26] always
[1:25:28] take take away what the kids want
[1:25:31] when they see no sacrifice when they see
[1:25:33] no love when they see no
[1:25:37] that's why Mom will call up later and
[1:25:40] say you never see me you never call me
[1:25:42] you never
[1:25:43] she's still demanding that the one she
[1:25:46] loves serve her
[1:25:50] say God give us a genuine sacrificial
[1:25:53] love
[1:25:55] that will unlock love and the people
[1:25:57] around us
[1:26:00] the world needs this kind of love
[1:26:03] they've not they so seldom seen him
[1:26:07] Paul the Apostle Paul said for we are
[1:26:10] glad it's a second II Corinthians 13 9
[1:26:12] we are glad when we are weak and you are
[1:26:16] strong
[1:26:18] in this also we wish even your
[1:26:20] perfection
[1:26:21] Paul says I'm glad when I'm weak and
[1:26:23] you're strong
[1:26:25] he was willing to sacrifice himself for
[1:26:27] them
[1:26:30] brother Ben said this isn't the message
[1:26:33] of man running from the presence of the
[1:26:34] Lord he said when John the Apostle John
[1:26:37] he got so old up into his 90s he was too
[1:26:39] old to preach anymore
[1:26:41] he begins to tell us I love this he says
[1:26:43] as John of old when he got too old to
[1:26:45] preach he would just sit and scream they
[1:26:47] tell me with all of his my little
[1:26:49] children love one another love one
[1:26:52] another don't let nothing come among you
[1:26:55] see
[1:26:56] what was John's last message the last of
[1:26:58] the apostles who had seen the Revelation
[1:27:01] he had seen amen the heavens opened he
[1:27:03] had went into the other dimension he had
[1:27:05] seen all the way through to the new
[1:27:07] heavens and new earth he'd seen the
[1:27:09] culmination of redemption amen and when
[1:27:11] he gets down there's only one message
[1:27:13] he's got left little children love one
[1:27:15] another brother bam said nothing will
[1:27:17] enter in there but pure love divine love
[1:27:21] because God is
[1:27:26] first John 4 20 says if any man says I
[1:27:28] love God and hated the brother he's a
[1:27:31] liar
[1:27:33] we have to
[1:27:35] if you love God we love our brothers
[1:27:38] but I want to finish with this verse
[1:27:39] Matthew chapter 5.
[1:27:48] Matthew chapter 5 verse 43.
[1:28:02] Matthew chapter 5 verse 43 you have
[1:28:05] heard that it has been said Thou shalt
[1:28:07] love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy
[1:28:09] but I say unto you love your enemies
[1:28:12] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:28:13] them that hate you and pray for them
[1:28:16] which despitefully use you and persecute
[1:28:18] you
[1:28:19] that you may be the children of your
[1:28:21] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:28:24] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[1:28:26] good and sendeth Reign on the just and
[1:28:27] on the unjust
[1:28:29] for if you love them which love you what
[1:28:31] reward have you
[1:28:32] do not even the publicans do the same if
[1:28:35] you salute your brethren only what do
[1:28:36] you more than others do not even the
[1:28:38] public and so
[1:28:40] be therefore perfect even as your father
[1:28:43] which is in heaven is perfect
[1:28:46] not just the brethren
[1:28:50] but to do good to love why I I want to
[1:28:54] read this one part of this verse again
[1:28:55] as we finish
[1:28:58] let's start back in verse 44.
[1:29:01] saying you love your enemies bless them
[1:29:03] that curse you do good to them that hate
[1:29:05] you and pray for them which despitefully
[1:29:07] use you and persecute you that ye may be
[1:29:10] the children of your father which is in
[1:29:12] heaven why because this is how he loves
[1:29:16] this is how he loves and this is how he
[1:29:20] wants us to love
[1:29:22] and the love of God
[1:29:24] is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[1:29:27] Ghost I say God shed it more in my heart
[1:29:30] and More in my heart and let every other
[1:29:33] kind of love die inside of me so that
[1:29:35] this genuine sacrificial love will live
[1:29:40] there was a story I heard several years
[1:29:42] ago
[1:29:43] of a woman
[1:29:45] and this woman
[1:29:47] was
[1:29:49] had a little boy and this little boy was
[1:29:53] very very sick and the doctors could
[1:29:54] never find out what was wrong with it
[1:29:56] and the mother was posting on Facebook
[1:29:58] and posting on other social media forums
[1:30:00] and she was getting a lot of attention
[1:30:02] and a lot of people were posting back
[1:30:04] and giving support and she started a
[1:30:06] Blog and the blog was in the name of her
[1:30:08] son's journey so-and-so's journey and
[1:30:10] she was blogging this and doing videos
[1:30:12] and updates and and she was going around
[1:30:14] and and over the course of this child's
[1:30:16] life in the first five years she had
[1:30:18] taken it to 20 over 20 different medical
[1:30:20] facilities
[1:30:22] and finally the child died at five and
[1:30:25] they found out that this woman had been
[1:30:27] slowly poisoning her child to keep him
[1:30:29] sick
[1:30:30] because she loved the attention from his
[1:30:34] illness
[1:30:35] because she loved the feedback on social
[1:30:38] media she felt good when people cared it
[1:30:42] made her feel good when somebody
[1:30:43] responded when so many people watched
[1:30:46] her blog when they did this when they
[1:30:47] cared when they came to her
[1:30:50] that is a perverted love
[1:30:53] that's an extreme but we see mild forms
[1:30:56] of this all the time
[1:30:59] mild forms of that same extreme we see
[1:31:03] it all the time
[1:31:05] we see it in the Bible in Saul when Saul
[1:31:07] wanted a victory over the Philistines
[1:31:08] and when when the Philistines were
[1:31:11] routed because of the work that Jonathan
[1:31:12] and armored Bearer had done amen he then
[1:31:15] makes a decree he says nobody will touch
[1:31:17] food today we will fast because he was
[1:31:19] trying to ensure a victory
[1:31:22] and in doing though he troubled all of
[1:31:24] Israel because the soldiers were asked
[1:31:25] to go out and fight with no food they
[1:31:27] couldn't go up on the spoil they
[1:31:29] couldn't put anything to their mouth
[1:31:30] remember even Jonathan touched the end
[1:31:32] of his staff and honey and put it to his
[1:31:33] mouth because he didn't hear
[1:31:35] and they told him what happened he said
[1:31:37] my father has troubled all of Israel see
[1:31:39] how my eyes are lying if Saul would have
[1:31:42] loved the people more than he loved
[1:31:43] himself he would let the people eat but
[1:31:45] he wanted to ensure that God had to give
[1:31:47] him a victory and he would trouble all
[1:31:48] of the people for himself
[1:31:51] when fathers do that it's evil when
[1:31:53] ministers do that it's evil amen When
[1:31:55] anybody else when parents do that it's
[1:31:57] evil
[1:31:59] troubling people putting burdens on
[1:32:01] making requirements amen so that they
[1:32:03] can ensure for themselves victories or
[1:32:04] to look good or somehow have a status
[1:32:08] that's wickedness
[1:32:10] as perverted love
[1:32:12] but genuine love amen goes to the front
[1:32:15] of the battle and says amen what was it
[1:32:18] uh Van Winkle read amen there and
[1:32:20] Switzerland amen when he had all of his
[1:32:22] home and all of his family and
[1:32:24] everything that he loved behind him and
[1:32:26] there was an Army here that couldn't
[1:32:27] possibly be defeat he said he would
[1:32:29] become an example to encourage everybody
[1:32:31] and he said follow me boys and he ran
[1:32:33] into the thickest of the Spears and
[1:32:35] grabbed his many in his arms as he can
[1:32:36] and thrust him through him side and it
[1:32:39] so shocked the army of it is active
[1:32:41] sacrificial love so inspired amen all of
[1:32:44] his countrymen that they thwarted that
[1:32:46] army that day
[1:32:47] that's love
[1:32:52] but to sit at home smoke a cigar and
[1:32:55] send your 18 year old off the war
[1:32:58] that's not love
[1:33:01] it happens all around us all the time
[1:33:05] what's called love Isn't Love
[1:33:08] but what is true love
[1:33:10] sacrificial love
[1:33:13] that's true
[1:33:14] let's all stand
[1:33:22] it's not putting The Birds musicians
[1:33:24] please come it's not perting the burdens
[1:33:26] on others
[1:33:27] to make ourselves look good
[1:33:30] it's taking the burdens upon ourselves
[1:33:32] to ease the burden of another so that
[1:33:34] they can go free
[1:33:36] it's bearing their shame
[1:33:38] it's walking alongside them it's maybe
[1:33:40] even getting a little dirty with them to
[1:33:43] draw them out
[1:33:44] it's not calling them out of the pit
[1:33:46] it's going in the pit and pulling them
[1:33:47] out
[1:33:48] that's true sacrificial love
[1:33:51] not heaping demands but easing burdens
[1:33:55] not making more requirements but but
[1:33:58] coming alongside and helping you bear
[1:34:00] your burden that's genuine love
[1:34:04] I say God in this world that is so
[1:34:07] fallen and twisted give us genuine Godly
[1:34:09] love
[1:34:11] shed it abroad in our hearts by your
[1:34:12] Holy Ghost and let every other kind of
[1:34:14] love die and let this one live in me
[1:34:18] amen do you have a song brother
[1:34:21] looks like they're working on one right
[1:34:23] now
[1:34:24] sing this song and then we'll ask our
[1:34:25] brother jivaratnam to come and close us
[1:34:27] in a word of Prayer

[1:35:30] what a great message
[1:35:34] I truly believe the whole Bible teaches
[1:35:39] the love of God
[1:35:41] the love means
[1:35:43] sacrificial
[1:35:47] prophet of God
[1:35:49] said
[1:35:51] that day on calorie
[1:35:55] he kept nothing for himself
[1:36:00] he gave everything for us
[1:36:04] that the sacrificial love
[1:36:09] and he's preaching
[1:36:11] tears coming to from my eyes
[1:36:16] it's not easy to sacrifice but
[1:36:21] it's possible
[1:36:23] only by the holy spirit amen
[1:36:27] who cannot Act
[1:36:29] but
[1:36:30] by the Holy Spirit who can
[1:36:33] action
[1:36:36] thank God for his word
[1:36:40] [Music]

[1:36:48] true Christians never live for
[1:36:51] themselves but they live for others
