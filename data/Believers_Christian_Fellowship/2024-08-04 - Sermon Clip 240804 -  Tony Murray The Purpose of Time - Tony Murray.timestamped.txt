[0:00] you know when when uh when job was
[0:03] here God actually set up that trial for
[0:06] job it was not it was not Satan that did
[0:08] that that was God that did that he's
[0:10] going Satan have you considered my
[0:12] servant
[0:15] job you
[0:16] know we be thinking the Lord should be
[0:19] protecting him keeping Satan away and
[0:22] that's what Satan said you are keeping
[0:24] me away he said no no no come and have a
[0:26] look there's no one like him in the land
[0:28] god starts bragging
[0:30] on job he he starts he starts needling
[0:34] the devil about job he's such a great
[0:37] man there's no one in the earth like him
[0:40] so Satan he says you can Satan says well
[0:42] I can't get to him God says you can but
[0:44] don't take his life but God sets it up
[0:46] this way because as job was a great man
[0:49] and God was impressed with job but God
[0:51] said I can make him
[0:53] greater I can make him twice what he
[0:57] is by by giving him a trial that he
[1:00] becomes an overcomer and job was twice
[1:03] the man that he was at the beginning and
[1:04] right now the Lord is bragging on his
[1:08] bride he is behind the scenes he and
[1:11] Satan are having a
[1:13] conversation he's bragging on
[1:16] you sometimes that causes our
[1:19] trials he's making something beautiful
[1:21] out of your life yeah that's true and I
[1:26] heard somebody say this too and I I can
[1:28] identify with it being true
[1:30] if you had a choice of all the different
[1:32] trials that that are
[1:36] available which ones would you pick
[1:39] would you pick brother so and so's
[1:40] trials brother sister so and so's trials
[1:43] all you'd pick your own
[1:46] trials so
[1:48] leukemia would you choose that well I'm
[1:51] on the other side of that
[1:53] now so you say praise the Lord I'm glad
[1:56] that I've been through that experience
[1:58] and he delivered me I'm glad to have
[2:00] that on my record he's the delivering
[2:02] God you know when I was I was lying in
[2:04] hospital and only certain simple
[2:07] scriptures could come to me I couldn't
[2:09] think too well or pumping me full of
[2:10] drugs and things but Romans 8:28 just
[2:13] stood out all things work together for
[2:15] the
[2:16] good all things and I thought that all
[2:19] things that means right now all things
[2:23] and I got myself up out of the bed I was
[2:25] there by myself in the isolated room for
[2:28] 7 weeks and I stood up I said Thank You
[2:32] Lord all things it means that right now
[2:34] this is for my good tears running down
[2:37] my face and the presence of the Lord
[2:38] just came down in the room and when my
[2:40] wife came back in I said I'm going to be
[2:42] well presence of the Lord's been here
[2:44] all things are working together for good
[2:46] he wants to hear his bride quoting his
[2:49] word amen that's just that's what it's
[2:53] all about
