[16:04] christ's name we pray
[16:06] amen
[16:08] man god bless you while you're standing
[16:10] let's take our bibles and go to psalms
[16:12] 46.
[16:15] and then
[16:16] i just want to mention that we had the
[16:18] funeral service here yesterday for
[16:20] sister lou mcnulty and it was a nice
[16:22] service and appreciate all those who
[16:23] were able to come out and it went really
[16:26] well
[16:28] also i want to remind you that this
[16:29] afternoon we have the communion service
[16:31] and feet washing here so i'll announce
[16:33] that again at the end of service
[16:36] amen
[16:38] let's look at psalms 46
[16:42] and verse 1.
[16:46] god is our refuge and strength
[16:48] a very present help and trouble
[16:51] i want you to pay close attention to
[16:53] psalms 46 because it's really
[16:55] interesting as we read this but it this
[16:58] this scripture has become to mean a lot
[17:00] to me over the last couple of days have
[17:02] i studied this god is our refuge and our
[17:04] strength and a very present help and a
[17:06] very present help in trouble
[17:08] therefore will i not will not we fear
[17:12] though the earth be removed and though
[17:15] the mountains be carried into the midst
[17:16] of the sea
[17:18] talk about fearful things
[17:20] these are fearful things
[17:22] but because god is our refuge and
[17:24] strength and very present help and
[17:26] trouble
[17:26] therefore
[17:28] will not we fear
[17:30] though the earth be removed though the
[17:32] mountains be carried into the midst of
[17:34] the sea
[17:35] though the waters thereof roar and be
[17:37] troubled though the mountains shake with
[17:39] the swelling thereof selah
[17:42] there is a river the streams whereof
[17:44] shall make glad the city of god
[17:47] what is the city of god the new
[17:49] jerusalem the bride
[17:52] so read this with that understanding
[17:53] there is a river the streams whereof
[17:55] shall make glad the city of god the holy
[17:58] place of the tabernacle of the most high
[18:01] god is in the midst of her
[18:03] she shall not be moved god shall help
[18:06] her in that right early
[18:09] amen god bless you as you take your
[18:11] seats
[18:12] amen
[18:14] i want to
[18:15] take from there a subject
[18:18] of a present help
[18:20] in the time of trouble
[18:22] a present help in the time of trouble
[18:25] amen and to see that
[18:27] that god is in the midst of her
[18:30] this city this tabernacle of the most
[18:32] high this dwelling place of god god is
[18:35] in the midst of her
[18:36] and she shall not be moved
[18:40] god shall help her in that right early
[18:44] because of this though the though the
[18:46] earth be removed though the mountains be
[18:48] cast into the sea that the waters roar
[18:51] we shall not fear
[18:53] i mean that's the thing that is is just
[18:55] heavy in my heart that god is training
[18:58] us god is teaching us in this age that
[19:01] he is in absolute complete control of
[19:04] all things and that there will be a
[19:05] bride on this earth who is not driven by
[19:08] fear manipulated by fear moved around
[19:11] running around all these things by fear
[19:13] but there will be a bride who will be
[19:15] planted upon a rock amen
[19:17] and she will know that she is planted
[19:19] upon the rock and though the waves v
[19:21] bietmanly against this vehemently
[19:23] against this house amen the house will
[19:25] not be moved because we are not on the
[19:27] shifting sands of man's ideology amen of
[19:30] doctrines of man and denominational
[19:32] understanding but we are on the solid
[19:34] rock of jesus christ the revelation of
[19:36] the entire bible has been unfolded in
[19:39] this day and his bride is planted on
[19:42] that rock amen and no matter what
[19:44] happens with the storms it's amazing
[19:46] that when jesus uses this parable of
[19:49] typing two houses built on two surfaces
[19:52] one on the sand and one upon the rock
[19:54] amen they both received the same storm
[19:59] and this is something that i just i want
[20:01] to take note of amen the the man who who
[20:04] did not heed the words of the lord and
[20:06] build his house upon the sand amen he
[20:09] had the same waves the same storm the
[20:13] same waters that beat against his house
[20:15] and beat it down amen the one who who
[20:18] heeded the words of christ and obeyed
[20:20] them amen he built his house upon the
[20:23] rock and received the same storm as the
[20:25] other man did
[20:27] so it's not as though we can say i'm the
[20:29] bride of jesus christ i have
[20:30] supernatural protection that is true but
[20:33] it doesn't mean the wave will not beat
[20:35] against your house amen it doesn't mean
[20:37] the storm will not come and the wave
[20:39] will not beat against your house but
[20:41] you've been planted upon the rock of
[20:43] christ jesus amen and your house will
[20:45] not be moved the other house will be
[20:46] moved so we we can no longer amen
[20:50] live in a fairy tale and pretend that
[20:52] i'm the bride of jesus christ no trouble
[20:54] will come trouble will come
[20:58] storms will come
[21:00] waves will beat vehemently against your
[21:03] house amen beat vehemently
[21:06] that's serious against your house but it
[21:09] won't move
[21:10] not because of you but because of the
[21:12] rock you're on
[21:16] so we it to me it's so helpful sometimes
[21:19] to to keep things in perspective amen
[21:22] and and that we don't uh we don't allow
[21:25] some of the the things that we
[21:27] understand to be true that we don't take
[21:29] it in carnal ways and go into the wrong
[21:31] direction with with our own carnal
[21:33] understanding and interpretation of
[21:35] things and think that because we're the
[21:37] bride of jesus christ no trouble will
[21:39] come no
[21:41] sometimes because you're the bride of
[21:42] jesus christ trouble will come
[21:46] and that that there'll be no suffering
[21:48] because that's not the scriptures the
[21:50] scripture says that you'll reign with
[21:51] him if you suffer with him
[21:54] so there's no way of escaping those
[21:56] things but the scripture says
[21:59] he is a present help in the time of
[22:01] trouble
[22:04] and i just begin to look at this
[22:06] differently
[22:08] he's a present help in the time of
[22:10] trouble
[22:12] and then psalms 46 that we just read
[22:15] verse 1 said
[22:16] a very present help
[22:18] in trouble
[22:20] and how much we long for the presence of
[22:23] the lord
[22:24] to be present with us
[22:26] and to make himself known
[22:30] but the scriptures promised that that'll
[22:31] happen in a time of trouble
[22:34] but we never want to have trouble but we
[22:37] want the presence of god and for him to
[22:39] show himself mighty but we never want
[22:41] trouble but the scripture's promised
[22:42] that in trouble he'll be present and
[22:44] show himself mighty
[22:46] so do we want him to be present show
[22:47] himself mighty
[22:49] but we spend all of our time especially
[22:51] as americans we spend all of our time
[22:52] guarding ourselves against trouble
[22:55] no trouble no problems we want to be
[22:58] financially secure we want insurance for
[23:00] everything we want a backup plan we want
[23:02] electric off the grid and a backup
[23:04] generator and a kerosene heater and a
[23:07] bunch of canned goods in the basement
[23:08] we're always trying to take care of
[23:10] ourselves amen but god has promised that
[23:12] when the trouble comes amen i'll be a
[23:15] very present help
[23:18] let's turn to uh psalms 34 and read
[23:20] another scripture here
[23:23] we've been talking about
[23:25] the testimony last sunday we were
[23:27] talking about the testimony that that
[23:31] out of revelation chapter 12 verse 11
[23:33] when it says that they overcame him by
[23:35] the blood of the lamb and the word of
[23:37] their testimony that these individuals
[23:39] that have overcome the devil have a
[23:41] testimony amen and and they overcame by
[23:44] the blood of the lamb and the word of
[23:46] their testimony and we talked about that
[23:48] word testimony is the same word as
[23:49] witness they're giving witness and their
[23:51] witness is part of the condemnation of
[23:53] the devil amen that because of their
[23:55] testimony because of their witness they
[23:57] have overcome him
[23:59] so it's not just something that happens
[24:01] afar off and it's already done for us
[24:03] but no we overcome him by the blood of
[24:05] the lamb and the word of our testimony
[24:08] so we must have a testimony to overcome
[24:10] the devil with
[24:12] we must be able to testify witness that
[24:15] this word works amen and how do we
[24:17] witness that this word works when we get
[24:19] in all kinds of situations and
[24:21] difficulties and trials and tribulations
[24:24] and the word overcomes every single one
[24:27] of them sickness comes the word
[24:28] overcomes amen troubles come the word
[24:30] overcomes amen all kinds of afflictions
[24:33] come and the word overcomes and when the
[24:35] word overcomes in our life we have a
[24:37] testimony we now can witness i can stand
[24:40] and say i have seen the word overcome
[24:43] that situation in my life
[24:45] i have seen this word amen that you're
[24:48] that you are doubting this word that the
[24:50] devil is trying to to condemn god on not
[24:53] keeping his word he's kept it in my life
[24:55] that word works
[24:58] the next time there's a there's a
[24:59] conflict over the word somebody else can
[25:01] stand and i want to be a witness that
[25:03] word works because i was in this
[25:05] situation but you have to understand in
[25:07] order to be the witness you've got to be
[25:09] willing to go through the trouble amen
[25:11] that first the problem has to come so
[25:13] that the word can rise up and conquer
[25:15] that problem so that you can overcome by
[25:18] the word or the word can overcome
[25:20] through you so that you can stand on
[25:21] that day and says the word works
[25:24] it'll overcome depression it'll overcome
[25:26] the anxiety it overcomes amen the
[25:29] problems from my past the neglects and
[25:31] abuses that carried through with me
[25:32] through life the word overcame that
[25:35] sickness was overcome by the word
[25:39] i had a financial need amen and the word
[25:41] says amen that god will provide all of
[25:43] my needs in the word works
[25:47] but you see
[25:48] what was the condition
[25:50] leading to the testimony
[25:54] a lot of trouble
[25:58] psalms 34
[26:00] 17.
[26:03] psalms 34
[26:06] and 17
[26:08] the righteous cry and the lord heareth
[26:11] and delivereth them
[26:13] out of all their troubles
[26:15] the lord is nigh unto them that are of a
[26:17] broken heart and save us such as be of a
[26:20] contrite spirit
[26:22] many are the afflictions of the
[26:24] righteous but the lord delivereth them
[26:26] out of them all
[26:28] now do we believe this scripture
[26:32] then we shouldn't get so confused over
[26:34] our many afflictions
[26:36] when one problem comes and we get over
[26:38] that and another problem comes and when
[26:40] the devil comes and whispers in ear and
[26:42] it tries to bring confusion because the
[26:44] amount of opposition and difficulty in
[26:46] our lives is how can you be the bride of
[26:48] christ and have so much trouble but the
[26:51] is telling us that this is the condition
[26:53] of the righteous
[26:55] many are the afflictions of the
[26:56] righteous
[26:59] but the lord delivereth him out of them
[27:01] all
[27:02] so
[27:03] the scripture in verse 18 i want to
[27:05] spend a moment on is the lord is nine to
[27:07] them that are of a broken heart and save
[27:09] us such as be of a contrite spirit this
[27:11] word contrite is is literally means dust
[27:15] in the scripture and it has a sister
[27:16] word that's spelled the same pronounced
[27:18] different that means to be broken or to
[27:21] be shattered amen so this word dust is
[27:23] really broken down to dust amen when
[27:26] you're broken down with your of a
[27:28] contrite spirit your spirit is broken
[27:30] down to dust
[27:33] and so god
[27:35] it says the lord is nine to them that
[27:37] are of a broken heart and save us such
[27:39] as be of a contrite spirit
[27:42] and
[27:43] and i would venture to say i'm not the
[27:45] only person in here that works overtime
[27:50] not to be broken
[27:53] and broken into dust
[27:58] i mean that's not i don't try to put
[27:59] myself in that position to be broken
[28:02] to bits to be broken-hearted and to have
[28:05] my spirit
[28:06] broken into dust i don't intentionally
[28:09] wake up in the morning and try to go
[28:11] find some difficulty to put myself into
[28:13] so i'll be broken but the scripture says
[28:16] that he draws nigh to them that are
[28:18] broken-hearted
[28:20] and i'm always asking god to draw nigh
[28:22] unto me
[28:25] but he's promised that when i'm
[28:26] brokenhearted he draws nigh unto me
[28:29] and so we always want we
[28:32] our desire as human beings our makeup is
[28:35] always to avoid the very thing that
[28:37] brings his presence so close and the
[28:40] very thing that brings the manifestation
[28:42] of his word so evident in our lives amen
[28:45] god has become so real to me and i've
[28:47] seen god move in supernatural ways how
[28:50] many of you have had a supernatural move
[28:52] of god that you know god came on the
[28:53] scene and if it wasn't for god you
[28:55] wouldn't have got out of it
[28:57] okay i want to ask you was that movement
[28:59] of god that testimony you have was that
[29:01] coming at a time of peace and
[29:03] tranquility and blessing or was it
[29:05] coming at a time of trouble and
[29:07] tribulation
[29:08] difficulty amen impossible circumstances
[29:11] it's not you know it's not as though
[29:14] when all is well and we're skipping down
[29:16] the road amen that we're watching the
[29:18] magnificent mighty things have gone but
[29:20] it's when troubles come amen that
[29:22] there's a word to counter that trouble
[29:24] amen when difficulties come there's a
[29:26] promise to overcome that difficulty and
[29:29] so god is manifesting himself in our
[29:31] lives amen one trouble after another and
[29:34] he's promised to draw nigh unto them
[29:36] that are brokenhearted
[29:39] and so
[29:41] we we avoid the very thing
[29:44] that when we look back on are the
[29:47] highlights
[29:48] of our walk with the lord
[29:51] when we read through the bible and we
[29:54] have all of these stories all of these
[29:56] heroes of faith and all of these great
[29:58] accomplishments that were done for the
[30:00] glory of god and for the kingdom of god
[30:03] when you go back and you read the lives
[30:05] of all of these men through the bible
[30:07] and what we would call testimonies
[30:09] through the bible or miraculous works of
[30:12] god and i would ask you how many of
[30:15] those came in the face of adversity and
[30:17] trial and difficulty
[30:20] i think almost all
[30:23] i don't want to say all but i would say
[30:25] almost all when when we talk about amen
[30:28] uh the overcoming of samson well i mean
[30:31] it was difficult friends that was not an
[30:33] easy situation that samson was in he was
[30:35] captive his eyes were plucked out he was
[30:37] grinding in the mill he had to repent
[30:40] and be broken-hearted and contrite amen
[30:42] and in his broken heartedness and his
[30:43] contriteness over his sin god brings the
[30:46] greatest victory in his entire life
[30:49] and we look back at the look at that as
[30:51] samson he killed more in his death than
[30:53] he killed in his life but we don't
[30:55] realize that it was at contrition it was
[30:58] brokenheartedness it means through
[31:00] difficulty imprisonment he was cast
[31:02] completely and utterly down that god
[31:04] came in such a supernatural way
[31:07] we can go story after story after story
[31:11] through the bible and in our lives we
[31:13] could go around the room in story after
[31:15] story after story after story
[31:20] but i hope that we begin to realize
[31:23] that he's a present help in the time of
[31:25] trouble
[31:29] jesus told his disciples in john 16 he
[31:31] said these things i have spoken unto you
[31:34] that in me you might have peace
[31:37] in the world you shall have
[31:39] tribulation
[31:43] jesus said it
[31:45] in the world you shall have tribulation
[31:48] that's a sure word from the lord
[31:53] but he says but be of good cheer
[31:55] i have overcome the world
[31:58] this word tribulation
[32:00] is translated tribulation or affliction
[32:04] most of the time it's also translated
[32:06] translated trouble or anguish or
[32:08] persecution or burden
[32:11] in the description it means oppressing
[32:14] a pressing together a pressure an
[32:16] oppression affliction tribulation
[32:19] distress or straights
[32:22] that's what jesus was saying to his
[32:23] disciples you will have in this world
[32:26] you will have pressures
[32:28] you will have pressings you will have
[32:30] affliction tribulation distresses you
[32:33] will have straights but be of good cheer
[32:35] cheer i have overcome the world
[32:38] there's a problem coming but i've
[32:41] already provided the solution to the
[32:42] problem don't worry problems are coming
[32:44] but there's already a solution to the
[32:46] problem
[32:47] and i can stand here today and i can i
[32:49] can i can faithfully say that that
[32:52] troubles are coming
[32:54] they've been they're happening they will
[32:57] be but be of good cheer the solution has
[33:00] already went forth he has overcome the
[33:02] world
[33:05] let's turn together to isaiah
[33:09] 57.
[33:22] i feel like i'm preaching backwards i
[33:24] preached on your testimony now i'm
[33:25] talking about how you make a testimony
[33:29] i thought maybe i should have handled
[33:30] this first but maybe not maybe in the in
[33:32] the lord's wisdom he knew we needed to
[33:34] be excited about being a witness
[33:36] i want to be a witness i want to stand
[33:38] on that day and you know last sunday i
[33:40] said
[33:40] brother bam said now i could like to
[33:42] call i got time for one more witness if
[33:44] it's all right i'd like to take the
[33:45] stand i said who else would like to take
[33:47] and you all raised your hand so now
[33:49] we're talking about how you get to the
[33:50] place where you can take the stand
[33:53] so since we've already volunteered this
[33:55] is the perfect message now
[33:58] but be of good cheer
[34:00] i've overcome the world
[34:02] there is nothing for us to be afraid of
[34:05] i say that over and over but i have to
[34:07] say it to encourage myself because i
[34:09] find that all when troubles come and
[34:11] uncertainties arise i fear that all fear
[34:13] come back to me
[34:15] so i have to say it over and over not
[34:16] for you i have to say it over and over
[34:18] for me there's nothing to be afraid of
[34:20] [Music]
[34:21] there's if god is still on the throne
[34:23] amen if i'm still in the palm of his
[34:25] hand there is nothing to be afraid of
[34:29] fearful things happen but there's
[34:31] nothing for me to be afraid
[34:32] of isaiah 57 15
[34:38] isaiah 57 15
[34:40] for thus saith the high and lofty one
[34:42] that inhabiteth eternity whose name is
[34:45] holy i dwell in the high and holy place
[34:48] now don't read any further please
[34:50] this is the high and lofty one
[34:53] who dwells in the high and holy place
[34:57] okay we're going to see an absolute
[34:59] contradictory statement but it's not
[35:01] going to change god's dwelling place he
[35:04] dwells high and lifted up in the holy
[35:06] place now let's continue reading
[35:08] together
[35:09] i dwell in the high and holy place with
[35:13] him also that is of a contrite and
[35:16] humble spirit
[35:20] the high and holy one lives in the holy
[35:22] place
[35:24] with those that are humble
[35:27] and
[35:28] broken the high
[35:31] and the low
[35:32] come together
[35:34] in the humble in contrite
[35:37] i dwell in the high and holy place with
[35:39] him that is of a contrite and humble
[35:41] spirit to revive the spirit of the
[35:44] humble and to revive the heart of the
[35:47] contrite ones
[35:49] praise god
[35:52] brother branham in the message of the
[35:54] rapture
[35:55] he begins with the scripture out of
[35:57] psalms 27 we know it quite well and
[35:58] we're going to read it we can go ahead
[36:00] and turn there to psalms 27
[36:02] but it's interesting what brother ben
[36:04] says in the beginning of the rapture
[36:06] when he's coming to this he wants to
[36:08] preach on the rapture
[36:10] and he starts with an unlikely scripture
[36:13] in most of our thinking at the time
[36:16] and and here's what he says about that
[36:18] he says i want to speak on the subject
[36:20] of the rapture this is right in the
[36:21] beginning of the message now we believe
[36:23] that there will be a rapture all
[36:24] christians believe that that's bible
[36:26] readers believes that there will be a
[36:27] rapture
[36:28] and now to read for some background
[36:31] so brother branham's going to read this
[36:33] is what he's going to read out of psalms
[36:34] 27 is the background
[36:37] to the rapture
[36:39] so now i want to read for some
[36:40] background
[36:42] we read the 27th psalm
[36:44] uh one to five one to five verse so now
[36:47] when brother branham is going to preach
[36:49] on the uh on the rapture he wants to lay
[36:50] this scripture as a background or the
[36:52] setting or the background
[36:54] around the rapture so we want to catch
[36:57] what he's what he's thinking and what
[36:58] his purpose is in reading this and he
[37:00] reads the first five verses but i'd like
[37:02] to read the whole chapter
[37:04] psalms 27 verse 1
[37:06] the lord is my light and my salvation
[37:08] whom shall i fear
[37:10] the lord is the strength of my life of
[37:12] whom shall i be afraid this is the
[37:14] background to the rapture message
[37:17] he's trying to get the church to realize
[37:20] what our position and condition is and
[37:22] what our attitude should be the lord is
[37:24] my light and my salvation of whom shall
[37:26] i be afraid amen listen
[37:28] it was not this is he's not giving us
[37:30] this scripture
[37:32] amen to tell us everything is going to
[37:34] be so good in the background of this
[37:36] rapture amen that you have no reason to
[37:39] fear he's telling you there's everything
[37:41] around you will cause you to fear but
[37:43] you're not to be afraid
[37:46] he's not bringing this because there's
[37:48] no reason to be afraid amen nothing's
[37:50] happening everything's going fine i mean
[37:52] hunky dory everything's good amen the
[37:55] bride has come to the place where she's
[37:57] coasting
[37:59] do you believe the bride's gonna come to
[38:00] the place where she's just coasting
[38:04] but he says this is the background the
[38:07] lord is my light and my salvation whom
[38:08] shall i fear
[38:10] uh the lord of the lord is the strength
[38:12] of my life of whom shall i be afraid
[38:15] when the wicked even my enemies my foes
[38:17] come upon me to eat up my flesh they
[38:20] stumbled and fell
[38:22] though a whole should encamp against me
[38:25] my heart shall not fear
[38:27] the war should rise against me and this
[38:30] will i be confident one thing have i
[38:33] desired of the lord that will i seek
[38:35] after that i may dwell in the house of
[38:37] the lord all the days of my life to
[38:39] behold the beauty of the lord and to
[38:41] inquire in his temple
[38:43] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[38:46] me in his pavilion
[38:48] and the secret of his tabernacle shall
[38:50] he hide in me he shall set me up
[38:53] upon a rock
[38:57] brother branham reads these first five
[38:58] verses and he says i want to read on i
[39:00] want to preach on the rapture and i want
[39:02] to read this as a background
[39:05] all my enemies are gathered around me
[39:07] but i'll not be afraid
[39:09] though the foes want to eat up my flesh
[39:11] listen those are times that bring human
[39:14] beings fear
[39:16] those are troubling times those are
[39:18] difficult times those are circumstances
[39:21] that create anxiety and create fear and
[39:24] create all kinds of uncertainty amen but
[39:27] we see a contrast here in david and the
[39:29] most uncertain time and the greatest
[39:32] anxiety and fear he has the greatest
[39:34] peace and he says one thing will i seek
[39:37] after i'm not worried about how to get
[39:38] rid of these enemies i'm not worried
[39:40] about how to save myself i'm not worried
[39:42] about my escape route there's only one
[39:44] thing i want when all the foes gather
[39:46] about me and they want to eat up my
[39:48] flesh and everything's come against me
[39:50] to destroy me only one thing i'm
[39:52] interested and that's the dwell in the
[39:53] house of the lord all my life he took
[39:56] his focus off of the enemies his focus
[39:59] off of the troubles all around him and
[40:01] has put his focus on one thing i want to
[40:03] be where you are i want to dwell in your
[40:05] house i want to be in the secret of your
[40:07] pavilion and the hidden place in the
[40:09] inner chamber of your tabernacle i want
[40:11] to be with you you and me alone in the
[40:14] secret place in the little tabernacle
[40:19] david amen what a lesson for all of us
[40:22] in the troubling times amen that he
[40:24] didn't say oh god how will i get through
[40:27] here should i use this passage how will
[40:29] i overcome he in in this scenario in
[40:33] this situation he only wanted one thing
[40:37] let's read it again
[40:39] verse 3 again
[40:41] though a host shouldn't camp against me
[40:43] my heart shall not fear the war should
[40:45] rise against me and this will i be
[40:46] confident one thing have i desired of
[40:48] the lord that will i seek after that i
[40:51] may dwell in the house of the lord all
[40:52] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[40:55] of the lord and to inquire in his temple
[40:59] make that our primary focus
[41:02] let us all make that our primary focus
[41:05] and our primary goal and not worried so
[41:08] much about all the things going on
[41:10] around us but let's focus on this
[41:13] and i believe it'll bring peace to our
[41:15] hearts
[41:16] i'm going to continue reading for in the
[41:18] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[41:20] pavilion
[41:21] and the secret of his tabernacle shall
[41:23] he hide me he shall set me up upon a
[41:25] rock
[41:26] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[41:28] my enemies round about me therefore will
[41:31] i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of
[41:33] joy i will sing yeah i will sing praises
[41:36] unto the lord
[41:38] oh i love this scripture friends
[41:41] he's saying one thing i've inquired amen
[41:43] that's
[41:44] that's the dwell in the house of the
[41:46] lord and inquire in his temple and now
[41:48] he's lifted my head above my enemies
[41:50] that's he's brought me to a greater
[41:52] understanding to a greater revelation
[41:54] than all my enemies and when i come in a
[41:57] greater revelation and he lifts my head
[42:00] above the head of all of my enemies amen
[42:02] this is not just an elevated place amen
[42:05] he's bringing him to a greater level of
[42:07] understanding a greater level of
[42:08] revelation and with that greater level
[42:11] of revelation he says i will sing i will
[42:13] bring sacrifices of joy i will sing
[42:16] praises to the lord
[42:18] his enemies haven't gone anywhere and
[42:20] their desire to destroy him hasn't
[42:21] changed his circumstance hasn't changed
[42:24] but his understanding what's changed
[42:26] david's changed amen
[42:28] he was his head was lifted up above his
[42:31] enemies and when his head was lifted up
[42:32] above his enemies he realized amen the
[42:35] devil can do nothing to me unless it
[42:37] first crosses god's desk and god signs
[42:39] off on it that nothing's out of kilter
[42:41] everything's ticking just right on time
[42:43] what is that that's david having his
[42:45] head lifted above his enemies that is
[42:47] you and i in the time of trouble having
[42:49] our head lifted above our enemies that
[42:52] we know that god has appointed the day
[42:54] of my birth god has appointed the day of
[42:55] my death that god has a purpose in my
[42:57] life and nothing shall take my life
[42:59] until that purpose is finished
[43:02] and what is that that is god lifting
[43:04] your head above your enemies
[43:07] and then you can say
[43:09] this too shall work to the glory of god
[43:12] whatever my situation or whatever my
[43:14] trouble
[43:18] let's keep reading
[43:20] verse 7 hear o lord when i cry with my
[43:22] voice have mercy also upon me and answer
[43:24] me
[43:25] when thou says seek ye my face my heart
[43:27] said unto thee thy face lord will i seek
[43:31] i not thy face far from me but put not
[43:34] thy servant away in anger
[43:36] thou has been my help leave me not
[43:38] neither forsake me oh god of my
[43:39] salvation when my father and my mother
[43:42] forsake me then the lord will take me up
[43:44] teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a
[43:47] plain path because of mine enemies
[43:50] deliver me not over unto the will of
[43:51] mine enemies for false witnesses are
[43:53] risen up against me and such as breathe
[43:55] out cruelty
[43:57] i had fainted unless i had believed to
[44:00] see the goodness of the lord in the land
[44:01] of the living
[44:03] wait on the lord be of good courage and
[44:06] he shall strengthen thine heart
[44:08] wait i say
[44:10] on the lord
[44:12] god comes to those he draws nigh to them
[44:14] that are a broken heart
[44:16] and and and david says wait on the lord
[44:18] be of courage and he shall strengthen
[44:20] thy heart so when your heart is broken
[44:22] wait on the lord and he shall strengthen
[44:24] your heart
[44:26] those are the ones he comes to you
[44:28] in and i love in verse 13 when he says i
[44:31] had fainted and lest i had believed
[44:35] we have to believe that we will see the
[44:37] goodness of the lord in the land of the
[44:39] men
[44:40] that this too shall work together for
[44:42] good that god has a plan for my life and
[44:45] nothing coming against me amen can work
[44:47] outside of god's plan in my life amen
[44:50] and i we have to believe that that will
[44:52] see the goodness of the lord in the land
[44:54] of the living
[44:56] brotherhood says in the message i have
[44:58] heard but now i see from 1965
[45:02] he
[45:02] said now sometimes these great
[45:06] pulsations of faith come right in the
[45:08] time of crisis
[45:10] it's usually crisis that drives us into
[45:12] this it was a crisis that drove job into
[45:15] it why he was at the end of his life his
[45:17] children was dead his camels and all of
[45:18] his goods he was gone and destroyed in
[45:21] his own life he was broke out from the
[45:23] crown of his head to the soles of his
[45:25] feet with boils it was a crisis that he
[45:27] that he pressed himself there's where
[45:30] the inspiration struck him
[45:32] amen how many of you can say in your
[45:34] lives it was times of crisis that have
[45:36] become your testimonies
[45:38] times of crisis have become my
[45:40] testimonies i can stand on that day as a
[45:43] witness and my witness will overcome the
[45:45] devil because at a time of crisis the
[45:47] word worked amen god came on the scene
[45:49] he kept his word and the word worked i
[45:51] am a witness today because of a crisis
[45:54] i'm a witness
[45:56] because of difficulties i'm a witness
[45:58] because of pain and suffering i stand
[46:00] today as a witness
[46:02] let's go to genesis chapter 32.
[46:20] so we know no trial no test
[46:23] no trial and no test equals no testimony
[46:27] so how can you overcome
[46:29] with no testimony
[46:32] so we have to have a testimony and you
[46:35] know what
[46:36] we
[46:37] not collectively
[46:40] individually have to have a testimony
[46:44] that's one of my questions last week is
[46:46] the same question what is your testimony
[46:49] not the prophet's testimony not the
[46:52] preacher's testimony not my dad or my
[46:54] mom or are the great saints that were
[46:56] before us amen we we are following in
[46:59] the trail of many who have blazed the
[47:01] blazed away and they seem supernatural
[47:04] absolutely supernatural things have gone
[47:06] and i enjoy hearing all their
[47:07] testimonies but their testimony is not
[47:10] my overcoming
[47:12] i overcome him by the blood of the lamb
[47:14] and the word of my testimony that i
[47:16] individually must have a testimony amen
[47:19] i have to have a time when the word
[47:22] worked in my life when
[47:23] when the word worked when god overcome
[47:26] in my life that i have something that i
[47:28] can stand i can't stand as an eyewitness
[47:31] and give other people's accounts i was
[47:32] not an eyewitness
[47:35] so i can't give second-hand information
[47:39] amen in a legal proceeding in accord i
[47:42] can't say well my neighbor i mean it
[47:44] happened to them and so i believe my
[47:46] neighbor
[47:48] no they bring a witness that has
[47:50] first-hand account amen an eyewitness
[47:52] who knows what they're talking about
[47:54] amen an eyewitness that experienced that
[47:56] that that can give a testimony in court
[47:58] amen and i don't want to stand amen in
[48:00] the in the great courts of god to
[48:02] condemn the devil and try to keep
[48:03] talking about what everybody else did
[48:06] and what happened in the prophet's life
[48:07] then what happened in the great saints
[48:09] that went before i said no but i want to
[48:11] give a testimony of my own amen i want
[48:14] to stand and say i this happened in my
[48:16] life and god came down and did this and
[48:18] i was in this situation and this came
[48:20] against me and god came down and do this
[48:22] and i want to stand and testify that the
[48:24] word is true that god keeps his word and
[48:27] the devil is a liar
[48:29] but we each have to have our own
[48:31] testimony
[48:33] amen so
[48:34] no test no trial no testimony
[48:39] i i hope that we can get to the place i
[48:41] don't know that i'm there
[48:43] but i hope that we can get to the place
[48:45] where we learn to embrace what god is
[48:47] sending our way for our benefit and for
[48:49] the glory of god
[48:52] that i want to get to the place just me
[48:54] personally i want to get to the place
[48:56] where i stop panicking
[48:59] when i see something beginning to happen
[49:01] when i go to enter into a trial and all
[49:03] the circumstances are stacked i want to
[49:05] get to the place where my initial
[49:06] reaction is not panic and fear i want to
[49:09] be able to stop and say all things are
[49:12] in god's control and i'm in the palm of
[49:14] his hand and not his mind about me has
[49:16] not changed and none of his word has
[49:18] changed just because these new
[49:19] circumstances
[49:21] i want to get to the place where i can
[49:23] just hesitate for a moment and say this
[49:25] is for my good and for the glory of god
[49:30] the devil will be defeated god will be
[49:32] magnified the word will work in this
[49:35] situation like every other one that i
[49:37] faced
[49:39] i don't know why it is that i have not
[49:40] got to that level of maturity yet but i
[49:43] get to the place where when we see
[49:44] something happening all of a sudden you
[49:46] know the blood pressure goes up heart
[49:48] starts beating fast you get this anxiety
[49:50] can't sleep at night you know the big
[49:52] storm's brewing and something really
[49:54] bad's happening if god isn't going to
[49:55] come on the scene it's all going to fall
[49:57] apart and and and we know god's going to
[50:00] come on the scene we can look back over
[50:01] our whole life amen and god's going to
[50:03] come and say we can read the whole bible
[50:05] god's going to take care of us amen i
[50:07] want to get to the place where i do not
[50:09] let this flesh dominate me amen but the
[50:11] inner man begins to dominate this flesh
[50:15] say hold on a minute nothing's out of
[50:17] control here everything's all right
[50:21] let's look at genesis 32 verse 9.
[50:26] this is jacob when he's returning back
[50:28] to the land he's leaving laban he has
[50:29] his wives and his children and his
[50:31] cattle and his servants and he's heading
[50:32] back and he says and jacob said oh god
[50:35] of my father abraham and god of my
[50:37] father isaac the lord which says unto me
[50:40] return unto thy country into thy kindred
[50:43] and i will deal well with thee
[50:45] i am not worthy of the least of all thy
[50:47] the mercies and of all the truth which
[50:49] thou has shown unto thy servant for with
[50:52] my staff i passed over this jordan now i
[50:54] am become two bands
[50:57] deliver me i pray thee from the hand of
[50:59] my brother from the hand of esau for i
[51:01] fear him lest he will come and smite me
[51:04] and and the mother and the children and
[51:06] thou says i will surely do the good and
[51:08] make thy seed as the sand of the sea
[51:11] which cannot be numbered for multitude
[51:14] so now
[51:16] jacob is coming back but he gets word
[51:18] that his brother's coming to meet him
[51:19] with 400 servants and he fears for his
[51:22] life because he cheated his brother
[51:25] he got him got the birthright from him
[51:27] and he stole the blessing and so
[51:30] he's done wrong to his brother now his
[51:32] brother's coming back and he's fearful
[51:34] and he's in a straight he's in a press
[51:36] he's in a trial he's in a difficult
[51:38] situation and he cries out to god and
[51:40] when he cries out to god he starts to
[51:42] remind god of the promises that god made
[51:45] him
[51:46] that you told me out of my seed there
[51:48] shall be the seed as the sands and you
[51:51] told me and the promises to me and he's
[51:53] reminding god of the word that god
[51:55] promised to him and he's telling god i'm
[51:57] fearful god help me and deliver me from
[52:00] my brother but when the deliverance
[52:02] comes it's not exactly maybe what jacob
[52:05] expected
[52:06] and let's look at verse 24
[52:10] and jacob was left alone
[52:12] and there wrestled a man with him until
[52:14] the breaking of the day
[52:16] and when he saw that he prevailed not
[52:18] against him he touched the hollow of his
[52:20] thigh and the hollow of jacob's thigh
[52:22] was out of joint as he wrestled with him
[52:24] and he said let me go for the day
[52:26] breaketh and he said i will not let thee
[52:28] go except thou bless me
[52:31] and he said unto him what is thy name
[52:33] and he said jacob and he said thy name
[52:35] shall be called no more jacob but israel
[52:37] for as a prince has thou power with god
[52:40] and with men and has prevailed
[52:42] and jacob asked him and said tell me i
[52:44] pray thee thy name and he said wherefore
[52:46] is it that thou dost ask for my name and
[52:49] he blessed him there and jacob called
[52:51] the name of the place pineal for i have
[52:53] seen god face to face and my life is
[52:56] preserved and as he passed over
[52:58] epinewell the sun rose upon him and he
[53:01] halted upon his thigh
[53:03] therefore the children of israel eat not
[53:05] of the sinew which shrank which is upon
[53:07] the hollow of the thigh and to this day
[53:10] because he touched the hollow of jacob's
[53:11] thigh and the sin knew that shrank
[53:15] jacob is in a straight he's in a
[53:16] difficult situation he's fearing for his
[53:19] life and he cries out to god and reminds
[53:21] god of the promise and god's answer to
[53:24] his promise was to deliver him but god's
[53:26] answer to jacob's problem was also to
[53:29] change jacob
[53:31] and we realized that god has made
[53:33] promises to us that he will deliver us
[53:35] and there's no testimony without a test
[53:37] the trial produces the the opportunity
[53:40] to witness of god's goodness but god is
[53:42] always accomplishing multiple things in
[53:44] every trial and in every situation and
[53:47] here jacob amen he's of a certain nature
[53:50] he's got the birthright he's got the
[53:52] promise he's went and he's cheated his
[53:54] brother and then he gets cheated by
[53:56] laban but he also kind of works his own
[53:58] deal there and he comes back into the
[54:01] land amen and and his brother he's
[54:03] fearful his brother's going to come kill
[54:05] him that god now has jacob right where
[54:07] he wants jacob amen
[54:09] you realize that god could have come to
[54:11] him in the form of an angelic being a
[54:13] man and wrestled with him any time he
[54:15] wanted
[54:17] god could have done it amen when he was
[54:19] in bethel amen sleeping with his head
[54:21] upon a rock amen and he saw the ladder
[54:23] of god and the angels coming up and down
[54:24] he could have done it when he was in
[54:26] laban's house he could god could have
[54:28] come to him any time to touch him amen
[54:30] but god waited till jacob got pressed
[54:33] into a corner that jacob got down into
[54:36] desperation to jacob got to where he
[54:38] really needed god amen and none of his
[54:40] little shenanigans were going to work
[54:42] this time
[54:44] that he couldn't use a credit card he
[54:46] couldn't borrow from grandma anymore he
[54:48] couldn't go get another job
[54:52] oh we think times are different times
[54:54] are the same
[54:57] he couldn't he couldn't work it out on
[55:00] his own anymore he couldn't put himself
[55:02] on top anymore he couldn't work another
[55:04] deal amen all of his deal making was
[55:07] done all of us taking advantage was done
[55:09] he got into a situation where he was
[55:11] pressed and now he became desperate now
[55:13] he had to have god and he had to have
[55:15] god keep his word and there was nothing
[55:17] that jacob could do about it and when
[55:19] jacob got into that condition god come
[55:21] on the scene because god wanted not just
[55:24] to deliver jacob god wanted to change
[55:26] jacob
[55:29] and in this situation god could like i
[55:31] said god could have come to him any time
[55:33] he wanted to
[55:34] but god comes at this time
[55:37] amen there's so many things that happen
[55:40] to us friends that shape us that make us
[55:42] to mold us and some of some of our
[55:44] greatest shaping times come in the worst
[55:46] times of our life
[55:49] at times of great loss or great
[55:51] separation or or times that our heart is
[55:54] absolutely broken god could come to us
[55:56] at any time any time god could come and
[55:59] we pray all the time god changed me god
[56:01] mold me god make me more like you uh we
[56:03] pray that all the time and that's our
[56:05] harsh desire to be molded but sometimes
[56:07] the molding has to take place under
[56:09] intense pressure amen and when we come
[56:11] under intense pressure god is going to
[56:13] come on the scene because he wants to
[56:15] shape us in a certain way and we got to
[56:17] get to a place where now we're crying
[56:18] out and now nothing else will work
[56:20] you're the only option that i've got
[56:22] plan b is fail plan c is fail plan a has
[56:25] failed you're the only option i've got
[56:27] gone
[56:29] and god is working more than just
[56:30] keeping his word for jacob he is molding
[56:33] jacob to have the character that he
[56:35] needs to have to be one of the
[56:37] patriarchs of the nation
[56:40] so god comes down and presents himself
[56:43] to
[56:44] jacob but he doesn't make it easy on
[56:46] jacob jacob has to wrestle with him and
[56:48] he says let me go i'll not let you go
[56:50] and we've preached on all this we know
[56:52] the the whole situation but it wasn't a
[56:54] hand me it wasn't a give me it wasn't
[56:56] that god came down and god stood there
[56:58] and said here's your present with a
[57:00] pretty bow open it up this is your
[57:02] deliverance
[57:04] but jacob had to sweat it out jacob had
[57:06] to wrestle it out why because god was
[57:09] trying to get something out of jacob
[57:10] because jacob was intended to go back
[57:12] into the land he the blessing was with
[57:14] him the promise was with him amen he had
[57:17] the birthright the nation was coming
[57:19] through him but he had to be changed in
[57:21] order to fulfill god's purpose in his
[57:23] life and god used the press of the
[57:25] situation to bring about the
[57:27] circumstances for his change
[57:31] and when he got desperate
[57:34] then he became broken
[57:37] and in the wrestling with god when he
[57:40] was wrestling with god
[57:43] god
[57:44] broke him
[57:50] jacob wasn't wrestling with this man and
[57:51] fell over and hid his leg on a rock
[57:54] the angel touched his leg
[57:57] and broke him
[58:02] would god do that
[58:05] he still does
[58:10] he still does
[58:12] and from that day on
[58:14] jacob never walked the same way again
[58:19] i tell you friends i've had times in my
[58:21] life where god broke me
[58:24] broke me
[58:26] and i've not been the same since
[58:29] i'm not the same person that i used to
[58:30] be
[58:32] and it wasn't all the it wasn't all the
[58:35] joyous happy times and the birthday
[58:37] parties and the ice cream and cake that
[58:39] changed me
[58:42] it was sweating it out with god it was
[58:44] it was praying in agony for god to
[58:46] change the situation it was really
[58:48] wrestling around saying god i'm in a
[58:50] great need now and things would happen
[58:52] that would just absolutely break me but
[58:55] they broke me in a good way
[58:58] it broke my pride and broke my
[59:00] self-reliance and broke my arrogance and
[59:03] broken broken broke amen and i don't
[59:05] walk the same way that i used to walk in
[59:07] this world i'm much different than i
[59:09] used to be but god himself broke me and
[59:12] he may look to others like maybe i limp
[59:14] a little bit amen maybe emotionally i'm
[59:16] not as strong and i'm not as confident
[59:19] as i used to be and i and i'm not as
[59:21] bold amen there may be a little bit of
[59:23] an emotional limp there but i tell you
[59:25] it's the best thing that has ever
[59:26] happened in my life because now when you
[59:28] see me walk and i'm a little slow to
[59:31] judge and a little hesitant they meant
[59:33] to say something and and i'm a little
[59:35] bit softer than i used to be not as bold
[59:37] and not as brash and i got just a little
[59:39] bit i meant
[59:41] of a slow step i say thank god amen that
[59:44] he knew how to break me amen to make me
[59:47] what he wanted me to be
[59:53] it comes at great
[59:56] testing times great pressures
[59:59] god is not destroying us he's molding us
[1:00:03] the next time you get into a great trial
[1:00:05] a tribulation
[1:00:07] and somebody feels sorry for you
[1:00:09] sometimes they don't feel sorry for me
[1:00:10] god's perfecting me
[1:00:13] if we could just change our attitude if
[1:00:16] we could just look at circumstances oh
[1:00:18] what i pray for all the time is i quit
[1:00:20] looking at things through carnal eyes
[1:00:22] and i start flying like an eagle and
[1:00:24] looking at the perspective from above
[1:00:27] and from above the whole situation looks
[1:00:29] different
[1:00:32] when you get above you realize i've been
[1:00:34] putting my confidence in the wrong thing
[1:00:38] i've been hoping for the wrong thing i
[1:00:39] i've been i've been trusting in the
[1:00:42] wrong thing when you get a little bit
[1:00:43] higher you realize none of those things
[1:00:44] will work amen god is working something
[1:00:46] out of me and when when i come through
[1:00:49] this like job said amen though he tried
[1:00:52] me yet shall i come forth like gold
[1:00:55] because god's going to accomplish
[1:00:56] something in my life
[1:01:00] uh brother branham said in the message
[1:01:01] desperations 1963 he said now jacob knew
[1:01:06] that his life was close at the end
[1:01:09] he had a messenger come
[1:01:11] and told him that his brother with 400
[1:01:13] armed men was coming to meet him
[1:01:16] note he he was on his road fear took a
[1:01:18] hold of him he sent man ahead with an ox
[1:01:21] and cattle and sheep to make a peace
[1:01:22] offering with esau then after that he
[1:01:25] started with another group with another
[1:01:26] load of stuff then he started another
[1:01:28] group with another load of stuff trying
[1:01:30] to meet him first to try to turn his
[1:01:32] wrath then he got to thinking that won't
[1:01:34] stop him because he's probably richer
[1:01:36] than i am he doesn't need it then he
[1:01:39] took his wives and his little children
[1:01:41] and set them across that esau would see
[1:01:43] the little children and his wives and
[1:01:44] surely on his own little nieces and
[1:01:46] nephews he would not slay them
[1:01:48] then he still he couldn't do it
[1:01:51] god knows how to get a man
[1:01:54] listen to that statement god knows how
[1:01:56] to get a man
[1:01:58] jacob crossed the brook
[1:02:00] i want to
[1:02:02] i just say it this way
[1:02:04] was esau
[1:02:06] coming for jacob or was god coming for
[1:02:09] jacob
[1:02:12] god knows how to get a man
[1:02:14] remember these pieces are just pawns on
[1:02:17] god's chessboard
[1:02:19] he's moving us into position he's
[1:02:21] molding us into character he's shaping
[1:02:23] us he's he's moving us around the board
[1:02:26] with these circumstances
[1:02:30] and it wasn't esau coming to get jacob
[1:02:32] god was just using esau as a pawn he
[1:02:35] would now move him to this spot and then
[1:02:37] and jacob would move men this way and
[1:02:40] men this way and get and he would bring
[1:02:41] esau a little closer and then finally
[1:02:44] jacob couldn't take it no more so he
[1:02:45] jumped across the brook and got off by
[1:02:47] himself and god said that's what i was
[1:02:49] waiting for that last move worked amen
[1:02:52] that last move got him just where i
[1:02:54] wanted him out away from all of his
[1:02:56] confidence away from everybody else all
[1:02:58] by himself and now i'm going to come and
[1:03:00] i'm going to touch him
[1:03:02] you're a song that song he touched me
[1:03:05] when jacob sang it he sang it different
[1:03:06] than you sing it
[1:03:10] he touched me
[1:03:12] and changed me
[1:03:14] he touched me and broke me
[1:03:16] amen and i'm different than what i was
[1:03:20] god knows how to get a man
[1:03:22] jacob crossed a brook there he got down
[1:03:24] on his knees you know he had kind of
[1:03:26] been a little shyster before that excuse
[1:03:28] the expression but kind of he was a
[1:03:30] jacob means a deceiver and that's what
[1:03:32] he was but there's something had to
[1:03:34] happen to him there in desperation there
[1:03:37] when death laid before him there may be
[1:03:40] men and women sitting here tonight that
[1:03:41] death lays right before you and the only
[1:03:43] way that you'll ever be able to achieve
[1:03:45] the thing that you're waiting wanting is
[1:03:47] to desperately come
[1:03:49] i must have it tonight i get it now or
[1:03:51] i'm finished tomorrow is too late i must
[1:03:53] have it now when you pray for the
[1:03:55] baptism of the holy spirit the token
[1:03:57] don't say well now i'll go up and try
[1:03:59] lord i'm a little tired oh have mercy
[1:04:02] stay in your seat
[1:04:04] don't even don't even make an attempt if
[1:04:06] you come say i'll pass through the
[1:04:07] prayer line put the oil on my head i'll
[1:04:09] see if it does mean any good might as
[1:04:11] well sit where you're at until you get
[1:04:13] to a place until the whole church gets
[1:04:15] to a place that is between death and
[1:04:17] life you've got to have it now or perish
[1:04:19] then god will move on the scene it takes
[1:04:22] desperation to bring god on the scene
[1:04:26] and god knows how to get a man
[1:04:30] you know we pray we pray every day
[1:04:32] because we're christians
[1:04:34] but god knows how to get us to pray
[1:04:40] god knows how to move us into a position
[1:04:43] in the circumstances
[1:04:44] where we really get down and seek god
[1:04:49] where we cry out in desperation where we
[1:04:51] need him and nothing else will work god
[1:04:53] knows how to get us to pray
[1:04:56] amen
[1:04:57] let's look at psalms 37.
[1:05:12] psalms 37
[1:05:17] and 39.
[1:05:23] psalms 37 and 39
[1:05:27] but the salvation of the righteous is of
[1:05:29] the lord
[1:05:30] he is their strength in time of trouble
[1:05:33] and the lord shall help them and deliver
[1:05:35] them he shall deliver them from the
[1:05:36] wicked and save them because they trust
[1:05:39] in him
[1:05:41] he is your strength
[1:05:43] in time of trouble
[1:05:46] don't be afraid of the time of trouble
[1:05:50] let's let's resolve in our hearts today
[1:05:52] with god's help to no longer fear the
[1:05:55] time of trouble
[1:05:56] because he is my strength
[1:05:58] in the time of trouble
[1:06:00] so i need a time of trouble to display
[1:06:03] his strength
[1:06:05] it's all god
[1:06:07] showing himself let's go to hebrews 11.
[1:06:20] i referred to this but i'd like to read
[1:06:22] it together
[1:06:23] hebrews chapter 11
[1:06:26] is many times called the the chapter of
[1:06:28] the heroes of faith
[1:06:30] and it's a record of many of the old
[1:06:32] testament saints and what they've done
[1:06:34] but i'm just going to take a quick
[1:06:35] snippet from the end of this and
[1:06:38] verse 32 hebrews chapter 11 verse 32
[1:06:42] says what shall i more say for the time
[1:06:45] would fail me to tell of gideon and of
[1:06:46] barack and of samson and the jephthah of
[1:06:49] david also and samuel and of the
[1:06:51] prophets who through faiths of new
[1:06:53] kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained
[1:06:55] promises stopped the mouths of lions
[1:06:58] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[1:07:00] the edge of the sword out of weakness
[1:07:02] were made strong waxed valiant and fight
[1:07:05] turned to flight the armies of the
[1:07:06] aliens
[1:07:08] women received their dead raised to life
[1:07:10] again and others were tortured not
[1:07:11] accepting deliverance that they might
[1:07:13] obtain a better resurrection
[1:07:15] and others had trial of cruel mockings
[1:07:17] and scourgings
[1:07:19] yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment
[1:07:21] they were stoned they were sown asunder
[1:07:23] were tempted were slain with the sword
[1:07:25] they wondered about in sheepskin and
[1:07:27] ghostkins being destitute afflicted
[1:07:29] tormented of whom the world was not
[1:07:31] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[1:07:33] mountains and indents the caves of the
[1:07:35] earth and these all having obtained a
[1:07:37] good report through faith receive not
[1:07:40] the promise god having provided some
[1:07:42] better thing for us that they without us
[1:07:45] should not be made perfect
[1:07:48] these are the heroes of the faith
[1:07:51] the heroes of the faith had to have
[1:07:53] faith to overcome their circumstances
[1:07:57] that's what made them heroes of the
[1:07:59] faith
[1:08:00] because it was the faith in god in his
[1:08:02] word that brought them through a
[1:08:03] multitude of circumstances we just read
[1:08:06] those this this wasn't
[1:08:08] these men and women didn't have
[1:08:11] easy life and it wasn't the easy part of
[1:08:13] life that has them put in hebrews 11.
[1:08:17] it wasn't the easy part you know not
[1:08:19] every day is terrible
[1:08:23] we have some good days
[1:08:25] we have some blessed days we have some
[1:08:27] days where we take where we take a walk
[1:08:29] and we see the the creation that god has
[1:08:31] made is still even in its fallen
[1:08:33] condition still has god's fingerprint in
[1:08:35] it
[1:08:36] you see a mountain range and a sunset
[1:08:38] and and and you know
[1:08:40] different things like that brother
[1:08:41] branham said he heard a wolf howl and he
[1:08:44] heard an elk bugle and he said that just
[1:08:46] does something to me
[1:08:48] and there's days that there's a
[1:08:50] blessings of the lord and there's days
[1:08:51] that
[1:08:52] that good things are are happening to
[1:08:55] you but many times it's those good and
[1:08:57] wonderful things are not the anchor
[1:09:00] points in your life or not the things
[1:09:02] that you have a testimony about and
[1:09:03] certainly not what put these individuals
[1:09:06] in hebrews 11 you have to say how did
[1:09:08] they get into hebrews chapter 11. they
[1:09:10] got into hebrews chapter 11 by believing
[1:09:13] in the face
[1:09:14] of all kinds of trials and tribulations
[1:09:17] by believing in the faith face
[1:09:19] of terrible circumstances having faith
[1:09:22] believing god standing upon his word
[1:09:24] when all the cards were stacked against
[1:09:26] them when all the circumstances amen
[1:09:28] were up against them that's what got
[1:09:30] them in the hebrews chapter 11. and if
[1:09:32] i'm ever going to be in a record like
[1:09:33] hebrews chapter 11 it's not going to be
[1:09:36] the blue bird sky days amen when the
[1:09:38] warm sunshine's on my face and
[1:09:39] everything's well with me that gets me
[1:09:41] to hebrews 11 amen
[1:09:43] those are blessings of god and we
[1:09:45] cherish each one of those they
[1:09:46] strengthen us amen but but the real the
[1:09:48] real pressing the real trial brings the
[1:09:51] character of god out and brings the word
[1:09:53] of god to pass in my life and if i'll
[1:09:55] ever get into a record like hebrews 11
[1:09:57] somewhere in the records of heaven i'll
[1:09:59] be there because of difficult days
[1:10:02] terrible circumstances trials and
[1:10:04] tribulations
[1:10:09] praise be to god
[1:10:13] in isaiah 40 i'll just read it to you in
[1:10:15] isaiah chapter 40 verse 29 he says he
[1:10:17] giveth power to the faint
[1:10:19] and to them that have no might he
[1:10:22] increases strength
[1:10:25] even the you shall faint and be weary
[1:10:27] and the young men shall utterly fall but
[1:10:29] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[1:10:31] their strength they shall mount up with
[1:10:33] wings as eagles they shall run and not
[1:10:36] be weary they shall walk and not faint
[1:10:40] he giveth power to who the faint
[1:10:44] and to them that have no might he
[1:10:46] increases strength
[1:10:48] i think this is why jesus when he was
[1:10:51] talking with his disciples and they were
[1:10:52] asking who was greatest in the kingdom
[1:10:54] of god he took a little child and he
[1:10:56] said it in their midst he said unless
[1:10:58] you become like this little child
[1:11:02] why because god wants to show himself
[1:11:05] mighty he does not want to show how
[1:11:07] mighty you are
[1:11:09] so he takes the weak things of the world
[1:11:12] he takes the things that are not he
[1:11:14] thinks the things that are outcast and
[1:11:16] set aside and weak and unable he takes
[1:11:18] those things the child the children of
[1:11:21] the world and he does mighty things so
[1:11:24] that everybody will know it's not that
[1:11:26] child it's god
[1:11:28] there was a boy who had a few loaves and
[1:11:31] a few fishes amen and those loaves and
[1:11:33] fishes fed 5 000 it wasn't the boy
[1:11:37] it was god who took what he had and
[1:11:39] multiplied it
[1:11:41] and god will take things in
[1:11:43] circumstances like that over and over
[1:11:45] that's why when god was choosing his
[1:11:47] disciples amen he chose wisely
[1:11:50] he chose illiterate
[1:11:53] chose fishermen
[1:11:54] chose people with no ability no ability
[1:11:57] to start a church no ability to convince
[1:12:00] other people to believe in a set of
[1:12:01] doctrine they ran illiterate fishermen i
[1:12:04] bought a fish off of him in the market
[1:12:06] yesterday amen and a week later or
[1:12:09] months later or years later he's the one
[1:12:11] preaching the the present tense truth of
[1:12:14] god and the only way that i will get to
[1:12:17] god because that man has the key is the
[1:12:19] same one who smelled like fish two years
[1:12:21] ago
[1:12:26] that's why brother brown said the way up
[1:12:27] is down the way up is down is not
[1:12:28] brother ben's statement the way up is
[1:12:30] down is the whole bible
[1:12:34] and so god
[1:12:35] he's not
[1:12:36] you know
[1:12:38] uh
[1:12:40] i think sometimes we get the wrong idea
[1:12:42] that if i'm going to be the bride of
[1:12:44] jesus christ and christ is going to be
[1:12:46] manifest in my flesh that i've got to be
[1:12:48] strong and i've got to be power and show
[1:12:51] his might
[1:12:54] but don't forget that he's describing
[1:12:56] you in the feminine
[1:12:59] you're a woman
[1:13:01] you're not supposed to be the one with
[1:13:04] all the power and the might and the
[1:13:05] strength you're supposed to be relying
[1:13:07] on your husband to do all of that
[1:13:09] you're supposed to be confident in him
[1:13:12] you're supposed to have faith in him
[1:13:14] you're supposed to be even bold in your
[1:13:16] declaration because it's him
[1:13:19] don't forget that god describes you in
[1:13:21] the feminine
[1:13:22] and he also describes you as sheep
[1:13:26] and tells you that you have to be like a
[1:13:27] child
[1:13:29] so you have to be a sheep a woman and a
[1:13:32] child to be great in the kingdom of god
[1:13:36] amen amen
[1:13:38] so i think many times we've tried to
[1:13:41] prove how that we're the bride by
[1:13:44] whatever
[1:13:46] antics and
[1:13:48] testimonies and being loud and forceful
[1:13:50] and and and yelling and saying
[1:13:54] boastful things i don't know
[1:13:56] but i think he's looking for the humble
[1:14:00] the contrite
[1:14:02] the one who doesn't have it figured out
[1:14:04] and the one who doesn't have all the
[1:14:05] answers and the one who can just be like
[1:14:07] a child and say i don't know but my
[1:14:10] father knows
[1:14:12] a child who can say i i don't know i'm
[1:14:15] not strong enough to move that boulder
[1:14:17] but i'll go get my dad and my dad can
[1:14:19] move it
[1:14:24] or you know when the devil's pushing you
[1:14:26] around and you say i
[1:14:28] if you keep pushing me i'm going to call
[1:14:29] my dad
[1:14:34] so that it never becomes
[1:14:36] i'm the bride and i'm strong it becomes
[1:14:38] i'm the bride and i'm connected to the
[1:14:40] strengths
[1:14:43] i'm married to the mighty one i i am i
[1:14:46] am a prized possession of the one who
[1:14:50] who created the heavens and the earth
[1:14:51] i'm the prized possession of the one
[1:14:53] amen who can count who can cast out the
[1:14:56] devil with his finger
[1:14:59] it's not so much my power it's his power
[1:15:02] in me it's not my might his might and me
[1:15:05] but his strength comes to those who are
[1:15:08] faint
[1:15:09] his strength doesn't come to those who
[1:15:11] are strong the bible doesn't say i come
[1:15:14] to strengthen the strong
[1:15:17] i come to make mighty the mighty i come
[1:15:19] to those who are brokenhearted i draw
[1:15:21] nine of them that are brokenhearted i
[1:15:23] save those out of a contrite spirit amen
[1:15:26] i i i become strength for those that are
[1:15:29] faint
[1:15:32] so when we face obstacles that we don't
[1:15:34] have answers for we don't have to get
[1:15:36] afraid
[1:15:38] and we don't have to start
[1:15:40] yelling threats and start you know i
[1:15:44] mean we don't have to act like we're
[1:15:45] strong
[1:15:47] all we have to do is say i don't have
[1:15:49] the answer to this but my husband does
[1:15:52] i don't know what's happening
[1:15:54] job got to a place he says i look to the
[1:15:56] left and i can't find him i look to the
[1:15:58] right and i see him not forwarded he's
[1:16:01] not there backwards and i cannot discern
[1:16:03] him he's saying i have no idea where
[1:16:05] god's at and i have no idea what god's
[1:16:06] doing job had nothing figured out
[1:16:10] but after he said that he said but this
[1:16:12] i know that when i am tried i shall come
[1:16:14] forth as gold
[1:16:16] i don't have it figured out i don't know
[1:16:18] the answers i don't know why this is
[1:16:20] happening to me but i know who i am and
[1:16:22] i know who he is amen and i know that
[1:16:24] i'm connected by my a supernatural line
[1:16:28] to the mighty one amen to the conqueror
[1:16:30] to the undefeatable god of heavens and
[1:16:32] earth i'm connected amen eternally to
[1:16:35] him i was in his thoughts before i'm
[1:16:38] here for his purpose so i don't have to
[1:16:40] worry about it as long as i know that
[1:16:42] i'm here serving his purpose he is going
[1:16:45] to come on the scene and deliver me and
[1:16:47] he will keep his word
[1:16:49] [Music]
[1:16:50] that i can be confident
[1:16:56] amen
[1:17:01] let's turn to john chapter 9.
[1:17:05] i want to look at two reasons
[1:17:08] that trials come our way and there's
[1:17:11] more than two reasons
[1:17:12] there's multitudes of things that god
[1:17:14] does with every trial every circumstance
[1:17:16] in our life is multifaceted it's
[1:17:18] accomplishing several things
[1:17:21] in the kingdom of god everything is so
[1:17:23] intertwined and interlaced i don't think
[1:17:25] we'll ever figure out all that's god
[1:17:26] doing in every circumstance
[1:17:28] but there's two things that i want to
[1:17:30] look at
[1:17:31] the first is
[1:17:32] god is displaying his attributes
[1:17:36] in our trials and our tribulations god
[1:17:38] is going to come on the scene and he's
[1:17:39] going to prove his word he's going to
[1:17:41] display his attributes
[1:17:43] so our trials is all about him showing
[1:17:46] himself
[1:17:48] and let's look at this in john chapter 9
[1:17:50] verse 1
[1:17:52] and as jesus passed by he saw a man
[1:17:54] which was blind from his birth
[1:17:57] and his disciples asked him saying
[1:17:58] master who did sin this man or his
[1:18:00] parents that he was born blind
[1:18:03] jesus answered neither hath this man
[1:18:05] sinned nor his parents but that the
[1:18:07] works of god should be made manifest in
[1:18:10] him why is he blind
[1:18:13] because god wants to show his attributes
[1:18:17] why was he born blind because god wants
[1:18:20] to manifest himself
[1:18:22] so let's read it again
[1:18:24] he says neither hath this man sin nor
[1:18:27] his parents the question is why was he
[1:18:29] born blind who sinned he said nobody
[1:18:31] sinned that's not the reason he was born
[1:18:33] blind the reason he was born blind is
[1:18:35] that the works of god should be made
[1:18:37] manifest in him
[1:18:40] there's a lot of things that happen to
[1:18:42] us that we ask why
[1:18:44] why was i born this way why did i have
[1:18:47] these parents why did i come through
[1:18:48] these circumstances why did i have this
[1:18:50] trial why why why why
[1:18:54] and many times the question could be
[1:18:56] because god wants to manifest himself
[1:19:00] why was i born and neglected why was i
[1:19:03] my parents didn't love me why was it
[1:19:05] that i was abused as a child why do i
[1:19:07] have these scars from the past maybe so
[1:19:10] god can have a witness on that day that
[1:19:12] can stand up when somebody says i can
[1:19:14] never serve god because my dad abused me
[1:19:16] and abandoned me you could stand up and
[1:19:18] say but my dad abused and abandoned
[1:19:20] me but god was mighty on my behalf and
[1:19:23] the word worked
[1:19:26] one could stand up and say i couldn't
[1:19:28] serve god because you know i had a
[1:19:30] spouse and they wouldn't serve god and
[1:19:32] any time i tried to go to church any
[1:19:34] time i tried to believe the message or
[1:19:35] listen to it they were always against me
[1:19:37] and always and somebody else will be
[1:19:38] able to stand up and say i had a spouse
[1:19:40] who didn't believe
[1:19:42] and they were cantankerous and they were
[1:19:44] hateful but i found that there's a
[1:19:45] friend that sticketh closer than the
[1:19:47] brother that god would come to me and
[1:19:48] comfort me and encourage me and god gave
[1:19:51] me the ability to overcome that trial
[1:19:54] why are you in the situation here why
[1:19:56] were you born the way you were born why
[1:19:58] do you start with what you struggle with
[1:20:00] why amen maybe it's so god can show
[1:20:03] himself mighty
[1:20:04] on your behalf so that god can display
[1:20:07] his attributes
[1:20:09] brother branham said in the message why
[1:20:11] we are not a denomination from 1958
[1:20:14] why which was first a savior or a sinner
[1:20:17] which was first a savior
[1:20:19] which was first a healer or a sick
[1:20:21] person
[1:20:22] why was there permitted to be a sinner
[1:20:24] because the attributes of him is a
[1:20:26] savior if there had never been a sinner
[1:20:28] he had never been known as a savior
[1:20:29] hallelujah
[1:20:31] he can make all things wind around to
[1:20:33] his glory can the potter say or can the
[1:20:35] pot say to the potter you made me thus
[1:20:38] who's on the wheel who's got the clay
[1:20:40] whose hands is in it paul said oh
[1:20:42] foolish man didn't he say he'd raise
[1:20:44] pharaoh up for this very purpose
[1:20:46] certainly he knew it before there was a
[1:20:48] world he knowed who would be what and he
[1:20:51] let there be sin that he might be a
[1:20:53] savior
[1:20:55] why
[1:20:56] why did god let me amen go so far in sin
[1:21:02] why didn't he you know we we think these
[1:21:05] things all the time you know why do i
[1:21:07] have so many scars from living in sin
[1:21:09] why did i do so much why did i go so far
[1:21:11] well god could have stopped me anytime
[1:21:14] why didn't he stop me before
[1:21:18] maybe god wanted to show how deep he
[1:21:20] could pull a center out of sin
[1:21:23] maybe you're just displaying how his
[1:21:26] ability to save is stronger than anybody
[1:21:28] can imagine
[1:21:30] that god is a deliverer of every
[1:21:32] circumstance
[1:21:34] why did he let me go this way why did i
[1:21:36] have to go that far why did why didn't
[1:21:38] he stop me when this happened why did he
[1:21:40] stop me when that happened amen maybe
[1:21:42] god amen is just showing how mighty he
[1:21:45] is and how able he is to deliver and how
[1:21:48] able he is to save
[1:21:53] he so he says
[1:21:56] he let there be sin that he might be a
[1:21:58] savior he let there be sickness that he
[1:22:00] might be a healer he let there be hate
[1:22:02] that he might be love sure he did he's
[1:22:05] god and that's his attributes and he has
[1:22:07] to have something to display his
[1:22:09] attributes
[1:22:11] how would you ever know there was a
[1:22:13] night how would you ever know there was
[1:22:15] any if it was all daylight how would you
[1:22:17] ever know there was a night there's a
[1:22:19] night so it could prove daylight sure
[1:22:21] there is
[1:22:22] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:22:24] revealed he goes on and he says now he
[1:22:26] could do that in adam and eve but sin
[1:22:28] separated them so now there had to be
[1:22:30] some way to get it back again oh my this
[1:22:33] is rich to me just even think of it see
[1:22:36] god had see what god's purpose was now
[1:22:40] why didn't he just keep adam and eve
[1:22:41] like that then he would never been able
[1:22:44] to express his fullness his full
[1:22:46] attribute
[1:22:48] because he could have been a father
[1:22:49] there that is true but also he's a
[1:22:51] savior
[1:22:53] how do you know he is he is because i've
[1:22:55] had the experience see he is a savior
[1:22:58] and he had to express that
[1:23:01] my question is is he still a healer
[1:23:04] does he still need to express it
[1:23:07] it's still a testimony to the devil that
[1:23:09] amended there's got to be sickness to
[1:23:11] prove that he's a healer
[1:23:13] is he still a deliverer amen
[1:23:16] is there still many are there still many
[1:23:18] afflictions for the righteous but
[1:23:19] there's still a god to deliver them out
[1:23:21] of them all
[1:23:22] that there must still be many
[1:23:24] afflictions so that he can prove he can
[1:23:25] deliver from them all
[1:23:28] not just some but all
[1:23:31] amen and how is god going to prove that
[1:23:34] who's he going to use
[1:23:36] if god still wants to prove his world to
[1:23:38] this word his word to this unbelieving
[1:23:40] world and he still wants to defeat dev
[1:23:43] the devil in every one of his uh
[1:23:45] every one of his lies he's going to have
[1:23:47] to lift his word up and prove his word
[1:23:50] where is he going to do that through
[1:23:51] what kind of flesh through which
[1:23:53] individuals will god prove that he's a
[1:23:55] deliverer that he's a healer amen that
[1:23:57] he's a savior where will god prove that
[1:23:59] amen he'll prove it and you and i
[1:24:04] so let's not allow the devil to bring
[1:24:06] confusion when troubles happen amen but
[1:24:09] let's allow amen the eagle anointing in
[1:24:12] this day to lift us above the carnal to
[1:24:14] get where the prophet of god has
[1:24:16] explained these things to us so that we
[1:24:18] can have proper understanding and say
[1:24:20] god has not forgotten me amen god has
[1:24:22] not forsaken me but god is perfecting me
[1:24:25] he's showing himself he is defeating the
[1:24:27] devil right now
[1:24:32] that's why when sickness comes if we
[1:24:35] could just have the right approach this
[1:24:36] is why i'm saying i'm not preaching to
[1:24:38] you listen i'm sitting in the seat next
[1:24:40] to you
[1:24:43] this is the spirit of god preaching the
[1:24:44] man chad is saying oh i need that so bad
[1:24:48] god help me
[1:24:51] help me to every sickness comes or or
[1:24:53] you get a letter in the mail you know
[1:24:55] you owe a hundred thousand dollars in
[1:24:57] back taxes you didn't know anything
[1:24:58] about
[1:24:59] to where we could look at that and say
[1:25:01] oh devil
[1:25:03] you just created another testimony
[1:25:07] i'm not exactly there yet but i'm
[1:25:08] working on it friends
[1:25:11] god is taking us from one trial to the
[1:25:13] next and he's proving himself
[1:25:15] then something else that means he's
[1:25:17] proving himself and something else that
[1:25:18] means he's proving himself god has
[1:25:20] proven and proven and proven and proven
[1:25:22] until we can get to the point where we
[1:25:24] can say he has so proven himself to me
[1:25:26] that it doesn't matter what the
[1:25:27] circumstances look like all is well
[1:25:33] that's why when the shunammite woman
[1:25:35] runs up to elijah amen and she's got a
[1:25:37] dead child laying back in elijah's bed
[1:25:40] chamber and he says it's all well he
[1:25:41] says she says all is well
[1:25:44] why because god's in control this is
[1:25:47] going to work to the glory of god god
[1:25:49] will have his way
[1:25:52] well the doctors say xyz there's no
[1:25:55] chance for survival you say praise god
[1:25:59] when
[1:26:00] when i don't see how i could lose
[1:26:04] god takes me home
[1:26:06] i win
[1:26:08] god raises me up i win
[1:26:12] i can't lose
[1:26:15] see how when your head is lifted up
[1:26:17] above your enemies the perspective
[1:26:19] changes
[1:26:21] when the perspective changes
[1:26:24] then you can begin to give a sacrifice
[1:26:26] of joy and you can sing praises into the
[1:26:28] lord
[1:26:29] when your head is lifted up above your
[1:26:31] enemies
[1:26:34] brother bam says in the message
[1:26:35] redemption
[1:26:36] incompleteness and joy
[1:26:38] redemption and completeness and joy i
[1:26:40] love that title
[1:26:42] 1954
[1:26:43] that's the way god does things
[1:26:46] let you come right down to the last
[1:26:48] minute and then shows you what he can do
[1:26:50] about it
[1:26:52] listen
[1:26:54] how many can say that is the truth
[1:26:58] it comes right down to the last minute
[1:27:00] and and then when god moves on the scene
[1:27:02] the next thing that happens is you you
[1:27:04] go when god after you're rejoicing in
[1:27:06] your deliverance and your healing and
[1:27:08] whatever god did then you go back and
[1:27:09] say god i'm sorry for all those things i
[1:27:11] said
[1:27:13] all those doubts and questions and god
[1:27:16] i'm sorry for all the because then you
[1:27:18] look back and you see how silly you were
[1:27:19] to worry that god wasn't going to
[1:27:21] deliver you that his power was still not
[1:27:23] able to heal that his arm had gotten
[1:27:24] short somehow and then you look back and
[1:27:26] you say god i'm sorry for saying that
[1:27:28] i'm sorry for doubting this and i'm
[1:27:29] sorry for questioning that i'm sorry for
[1:27:32] going to so-and-so and so and so and so
[1:27:34] and so i'm trying to fix my i'm sorry
[1:27:36] god and and when god comes on the scene
[1:27:38] in the last minute and brings a
[1:27:40] supernatural deliverance you look back
[1:27:41] and see how childish and foolish you
[1:27:43] were
[1:27:46] amen
[1:27:49] that's right he loves to do that
[1:27:52] this is what a prophet of god who knows
[1:27:54] the nature of god who knows the author
[1:27:56] real well that's what he said he loves
[1:27:58] to do that
[1:28:00] now listen we on our end we don't so
[1:28:02] much enjoy it
[1:28:04] but god loves to do that
[1:28:07] he loves he loves to surprise his people
[1:28:10] [Laughter]
[1:28:12] i don't know that my ticker can take too
[1:28:13] many more surprises
[1:28:16] he loves to surprise his people
[1:28:18] you men like to do your wife like that
[1:28:20] wait till her birthday just keep her
[1:28:22] under suspense because you love her
[1:28:24] that's the reason god lets us come to
[1:28:26] the end of our road sometimes
[1:28:29] because he loves us and wants to prove
[1:28:31] his supernaturalness of his power
[1:28:34] sometimes god doesn't want to give a
[1:28:37] little deliverance to you because god
[1:28:38] wants to show you how much he loves you
[1:28:40] and how big his strength and how much
[1:28:42] power and supernatural he has so he lets
[1:28:45] it get impossible amen what's he doing
[1:28:48] he's showing you how much he loves you
[1:28:49] and how perfect he is able to take care
[1:28:52] of you and i
[1:28:54] he didn't stop it when it was five mile
[1:28:56] an hour he let it go to 50.
[1:28:59] he didn't stop it when it was a minor
[1:29:00] problem he let it go till it was major
[1:29:03] amen why because god brother said he
[1:29:05] loves to surprise his people he loves to
[1:29:07] surprise his pride
[1:29:09] he loves to show you how big he is how
[1:29:11] powerful he is
[1:29:13] and this is what brother brandon said
[1:29:15] to prove his supernaturalness of his
[1:29:17] power
[1:29:18] because he loves us that's the reason he
[1:29:20] does it
[1:29:21] he he just lets us get right down to the
[1:29:24] place where we're just about ready to
[1:29:25] make the last step then he steps on the
[1:29:27] scene
[1:29:29] he let the hebrew children walk right in
[1:29:30] the fiery furnace but there was a fourth
[1:29:32] man standing there with a fan
[1:29:34] keeping it off of them see he always
[1:29:36] there he never leaves he's always near
[1:29:40] the angel of the lord and campeth about
[1:29:41] those that fear him
[1:29:44] i was thinking of some stories in the
[1:29:46] bible and when i was reading this quote
[1:29:48] and reading these things we already
[1:29:49] talked about daniel daniel when when god
[1:29:53] never delivered daniel until daniel was
[1:29:56] in the lion's den
[1:29:58] he didn't stop i mean he didn't stop uh
[1:30:02] darius you know he could have given
[1:30:04] darius a dream like he gave abimelech a
[1:30:06] dream
[1:30:08] darius was being tricked you know by by
[1:30:10] certain officers of the corps and they
[1:30:12] were trying to lay a trap for daniel
[1:30:13] darius loved daniel he would have never
[1:30:15] done this if he would have known daniel
[1:30:16] would have wound up and the lion's den
[1:30:18] but god never exposed their plan to
[1:30:21] darius although he could have
[1:30:24] but if god had exposed their plan to
[1:30:26] darius we would never have the story of
[1:30:27] daniel in the lion's den
[1:30:31] and daniel was then taken and darius
[1:30:34] tried prayed sought all night to wait to
[1:30:37] get daniel out of this and he couldn't
[1:30:38] do it he was so bound by the law and god
[1:30:41] wanted him to be bound
[1:30:43] god did not want him to find a way to
[1:30:46] let daniel go
[1:30:47] because god wanted to be magnified in
[1:30:49] this trial
[1:30:51] and daniel trusted in the lord all the
[1:30:54] way amen and and and they threw him into
[1:30:57] the lions and when they threw him into
[1:30:58] the lions then he
[1:31:00] he he testified that the angel of the
[1:31:03] lord came and shut the mouths of the
[1:31:05] lions
[1:31:06] when did the angel lord shut up show up
[1:31:08] daniel didn't see the angel lord when he
[1:31:10] was praying that final prayer before
[1:31:12] they arrested him he he didn't see the
[1:31:14] end of the lord when they were walking
[1:31:15] him up to the entrance of the caves of
[1:31:18] the lions then he didn't see the angel
[1:31:20] lord till he was in the lion's den and
[1:31:22] in the lions then he saw the angel of
[1:31:24] the lord shut the mouth
[1:31:26] of the lions
[1:31:29] and so then we know how the story
[1:31:31] progresses but they they draw daniel out
[1:31:33] darius runs the next day and he says
[1:31:36] daniel has your god saved you and says
[1:31:38] don't fear my god has saved me
[1:31:42] and darius starts to proclaim that
[1:31:44] daniel's god is the only god
[1:31:48] amen that declaration may not have come
[1:31:50] out if god had you know just given
[1:31:53] darius a little uh a funny feeling that
[1:31:55] these uh court officials weren't up to
[1:31:58] something he checked into it and say ah
[1:32:00] they're just trying to do something that
[1:32:01] would have magnified and glorified gone
[1:32:03] but after it happened the way it
[1:32:05] happened amendarius says there's only
[1:32:07] one god and daniel's gone
[1:32:10] then they took all of those men that
[1:32:12] were daniel's problem
[1:32:15] causing problems and they threw them
[1:32:17] into the lion's den and it says the
[1:32:19] lions before they hit the bottom break
[1:32:21] all of their bones
[1:32:24] that's how hungry those lions were
[1:32:26] that's how supernatural this deliverance
[1:32:29] was
[1:32:30] and gone through this circumstance that
[1:32:32] was a horrible circumstance got a king
[1:32:34] to declare that daniel's god was the
[1:32:36] true god
[1:32:38] and got rid of all daniel's problems all
[1:32:40] at once
[1:32:43] and all along we would have said
[1:32:44] couldn't you have just told darius and
[1:32:47] just got me out of this trouble
[1:32:50] but it was the whole process that solved
[1:32:52] so many problems
[1:32:56] i tell you friends
[1:32:58] there's trouble and press
[1:33:01] upon the bride
[1:33:03] and i don't expect it to get any easier
[1:33:06] but there are certain troubles that come
[1:33:08] that are going to fix all the troubles
[1:33:12] and show how mighty god is
[1:33:14] and free us from our enemy
[1:33:18] and it may not be easy
[1:33:20] but it will certainly be worth it
[1:33:23] so one reason that god will allow trials
[1:33:25] to come is so that he can display his
[1:33:27] attributes that he can show himself
[1:33:30] another reason that i'd like to discuss
[1:33:31] for a little bit
[1:33:33] is to build our character
[1:33:35] so god in in our trials he is showing
[1:33:38] his might his power his glory he's
[1:33:40] showing his attributes
[1:33:43] but he's also building our character
[1:33:46] let's look at ecclesiastes
[1:33:48] chapter 7 together
[1:33:51] this is another verse that i just begin
[1:33:53] to look at
[1:33:56] and oddly enough to enjoy
[1:33:58] and you'll understand when i read why i
[1:34:00] say oddly enough
[1:34:04] ecclesiastes 7
[1:34:08] and verse 3.
[1:34:11] sorrow is better than laughter
[1:34:14] for by the sound sadness of the
[1:34:16] countenance the heart is made better
[1:34:22] listen to that again sorrow is better
[1:34:24] than laughter
[1:34:25] for by the sadness of the countenance
[1:34:27] the heart is made
[1:34:30] better
[1:34:32] sometimes these circumstances that come
[1:34:35] is not god destroying us but god
[1:34:37] perfecting us
[1:34:39] sometimes these things that break us and
[1:34:41] calls us it it's doing our heart good
[1:34:44] it's making us better
[1:34:47] brother branham says in the laodicean
[1:34:49] church age
[1:34:51] he says there is the gold of first peter
[1:34:53] 1 7 the trial of your faith being much
[1:34:55] more precious than of gold that
[1:34:56] perisheth
[1:34:57] the gold of god is a christ-like
[1:34:59] character produced in the fiery furnace
[1:35:01] of affliction that is the right kind of
[1:35:04] gold
[1:35:05] i want you to catch what he said
[1:35:07] christ-like character produced
[1:35:10] in the fiery furnace of affliction
[1:35:13] he goes on to say you and this is still
[1:35:15] in the laodicean church age you had
[1:35:17] better come before it's too late saith
[1:35:19] the lord and buy of me gold tried in the
[1:35:21] fire and then you will be truly rich are
[1:35:23] you getting it listen to me
[1:35:25] naked physically we came into this world
[1:35:27] but naked spiritually we will not leave
[1:35:30] oh no we are going to take something
[1:35:32] with us what what that something is is
[1:35:35] all we can take with us nothing less and
[1:35:38] nothing more
[1:35:39] so we'd better be real careful now to
[1:35:41] see that we take something that will
[1:35:42] make us right before god so then what
[1:35:45] will we take with us we will take our
[1:35:47] character
[1:35:48] brother that is what we will take with
[1:35:50] us now what kind of character will you
[1:35:52] take with you will it be like his whose
[1:35:55] character was molded by suffering and
[1:35:57] the fiery furnace of affliction or will
[1:35:59] be the softness of this characterless
[1:36:01] laodicean people it is up to each one of
[1:36:04] us for in that day every man will bear
[1:36:07] his own burden
[1:36:09] so to have christ-like character he says
[1:36:11] is developed in the fiery furnace of
[1:36:13] affliction amen if we want to reign with
[1:36:16] him we must suffer with him also but
[1:36:18] what is suffering producing it's
[1:36:20] producing a christ-like character and
[1:36:23] brother branham was saying here in the
[1:36:24] laodicean church age that we will take
[1:36:26] something with us when we go and there's
[1:36:28] only one thing that we can take with us
[1:36:30] when we go and that's the character that
[1:36:32] we gained in this journey
[1:36:35] so god has us in this life for a purpose
[1:36:38] we're here to serve his purpose and to
[1:36:40] magnify his name we're here for many
[1:36:42] reasons but one of those many reasons is
[1:36:45] to gain character and how do we gain
[1:36:47] character we gain character by the
[1:36:49] things we suffer
[1:36:53] let's look at psalms 119.
[1:37:04] psalms 119
[1:37:08] and verse 71
[1:37:15] it says it is good for me
[1:37:17] that i have been afflicted
[1:37:19] that i might learn my statutes
[1:37:23] it is good for me
[1:37:25] that i
[1:37:26] have been afflicted
[1:37:28] that i might learn the statutes
[1:37:31] there's things about god's nature that
[1:37:33] we could only understand by coming
[1:37:35] through this life
[1:37:37] the whiteness and purity and
[1:37:38] righteousness of god can only be
[1:37:40] understood in the backdrop of this evil
[1:37:43] age and the evil that we were born into
[1:37:46] so god allowed certain things to come in
[1:37:49] certain conditions to come so that he
[1:37:51] could bring us through this life so that
[1:37:52] we could understand his character so
[1:37:54] that we could gain in his character so
[1:37:56] that we would know him and he uses the
[1:37:58] fiery uh fiery furnace of affliction to
[1:38:02] build in us christ-like character so in
[1:38:04] every trial everything that is going on
[1:38:07] and happening to us it is accomplishing
[1:38:09] something for the kingdom of god but
[1:38:11] it's also building in us a character to
[1:38:13] reign with christ amen a character
[1:38:16] that'll make us more like him if these
[1:38:18] these trials are not without benefit to
[1:38:21] us and not without displaying god's
[1:38:23] attribute you know we would be willing
[1:38:25] to go through them just so god could be
[1:38:27] magnified but god is so good to us that
[1:38:29] is not just so that he can be magnified
[1:38:31] but so also we can gain christ-like
[1:38:33] character
[1:38:35] and we're becoming more like him
[1:38:37] through the things we suffered hebrews 5
[1:38:39] 8 tells us that though he were a son
[1:38:42] speaking of jesus christ yet learned he
[1:38:44] obedience by the things which he's
[1:38:46] suffering
[1:38:48] if christ had to learn obedience by the
[1:38:50] things he suffered
[1:38:51] how do we have to learn
[1:38:54] my no suffering
[1:38:56] that applies to this scripture it was
[1:38:57] good for me that i've been afflicted
[1:38:59] that i might learn by statutes
[1:39:03] paul says
[1:39:04] i had not known sin without the law
[1:39:07] like i didn't there's things i couldn't
[1:39:09] realize without you know i couldn't
[1:39:11] realize how perfect the law was the law
[1:39:13] come to show how imperfect i was and how
[1:39:16] imperfect i was come to show how perfect
[1:39:18] the law was the contrast was displaying
[1:39:20] how holy god was and how impossible it
[1:39:22] was for men to be holy so the law
[1:39:24] accomplished its purpose the paul says
[1:39:27] the law was perfect
[1:39:29] it wasn't amen it wasn't done away with
[1:39:32] and that it wasn't perfect it was
[1:39:33] fulfilled that christ was able to
[1:39:35] fulfill all the law for us amen so that
[1:39:38] we can now receive grace
[1:39:41] but it wasn't that the law was bad the
[1:39:43] law was there to show how bad amen we
[1:39:46] were and what we were born into and what
[1:39:49] we were born into showed how perfect the
[1:39:51] law was
[1:39:52] so they needed one another the sin that
[1:39:55] was born inside of me needed a law to
[1:39:57] expose sin but the sin exposed the law
[1:40:03] so god has allowed these circumstances
[1:40:05] to do two things
[1:40:07] one to show himself and one to perfect
[1:40:09] us
[1:40:11] to show amen how helpless we are but how
[1:40:14] perfect he is
[1:40:16] how the nature we're born with is so
[1:40:18] wrong it's so selfish it's so
[1:40:19] self-centered amen it's so
[1:40:21] self-gratifying the nature we're born
[1:40:23] into i mean you you take a little baby
[1:40:26] and a little baby never has to be taught
[1:40:28] to lie
[1:40:29] comes by nature they never have to be
[1:40:31] taught to steal
[1:40:32] right it comes by nature they don't have
[1:40:34] to be taught to abuse
[1:40:38] you know
[1:40:39] i've said this before but mothers you
[1:40:41] know they have their little baby and so
[1:40:43] sweet and they smell so good with the
[1:40:45] baby lotion after a bath and their
[1:40:47] little heads are so soft and they're so
[1:40:49] perfect
[1:40:51] and that little baby will lie to you
[1:40:55] when it learns how to talk
[1:40:57] you say it's perfect it's not perfect
[1:40:59] it's fallen
[1:41:01] it's innocent yet because it hasn't made
[1:41:03] a choice yet
[1:41:05] but when that baby learns to talk that
[1:41:06] baby will lie to you
[1:41:09] when you take away that baby's toy
[1:41:13] because it snatched it from another
[1:41:15] toddler and you take that toy and you
[1:41:16] give it back that baby will smack you in
[1:41:19] the face
[1:41:21] and pull your hair
[1:41:23] and bite you
[1:41:27] that's the nature we were born with
[1:41:30] that has to get out of us
[1:41:33] that is not the nature of christ
[1:41:35] what is it selfishness self-centeredness
[1:41:38] that's how we were born into this world
[1:41:40] lovers of self more than lovers of god
[1:41:43] and god is breaking that out of us
[1:41:45] friends
[1:41:46] to where i don't want my will i don't
[1:41:48] want my way i don't want anything of
[1:41:50] myself i just want it to be him i'm so
[1:41:53] tired of my way i went his way
[1:41:55] and every child is bringing reinforcing
[1:41:57] that i don't want my way i went his way
[1:41:59] i want to surrender i want to yield i
[1:42:01] want to be humble amen i want to subject
[1:42:04] myself to the word of god i want the
[1:42:06] word of god to rule every part of my
[1:42:07] life i'm so tired of my nature i want
[1:42:09] the nature of christ
[1:42:10] and christ was the perfect son perfect
[1:42:12] on obedience selfless sacrificing he was
[1:42:15] all of those things to the father and
[1:42:16] what he was i want to be and god is
[1:42:19] allowing all of these trials to mold
[1:42:21] into us that character by breaking off
[1:42:23] the wrong and we see it for what it is
[1:42:25] and we don't want it and moving towards
[1:42:27] the right
[1:42:29] though i don't want to take care of
[1:42:30] myself i don't want to be proud and
[1:42:32] arrogant i don't want none of those
[1:42:34] things anymore what i want more than
[1:42:36] anything is i want god to have his way
[1:42:37] with me and i want to surrender to him
[1:42:39] i'm so tired of my way i hate my way i
[1:42:41] went his way
[1:42:45] these trials are producing character
[1:42:56] go into this quote
[1:42:59] i want to wrap up with this quote
[1:43:02] out of the message i know
[1:43:03] i've quoted a portion of this to many of
[1:43:05] you and i've quoted from the pulpit many
[1:43:06] times and i've i've referred to this as
[1:43:08] my favorite quote and i believe it still
[1:43:10] probably is
[1:43:12] one of my favorites is not my most
[1:43:14] favorite
[1:43:15] but it's out of the message i know
[1:43:18] from 1960
[1:43:19] it says and why does god let troubles
[1:43:21] come
[1:43:22] god harnesses trouble
[1:43:24] puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey
[1:43:27] him
[1:43:28] who's in control of your trouble the
[1:43:30] devil or god
[1:43:33] listen to the next statement
[1:43:35] and those troubles
[1:43:37] bring us into a closer fellowship with
[1:43:39] god
[1:43:41] how many of us want a closer fellowship
[1:43:43] with god be careful
[1:43:45] be careful how high you put your hand
[1:43:49] but god has a mechanism and that
[1:43:51] mechanism is this world our fallen
[1:43:53] nature in this sin cursed world and god
[1:43:56] is using both of those
[1:43:58] in contrast to the perfectness of his
[1:44:00] character and of his word
[1:44:02] to break us and to mold us and to bring
[1:44:04] us into a closer fellowship with him
[1:44:08] there are times in our lives and i know
[1:44:10] i'm not the only one i know i'm just one
[1:44:11] of many
[1:44:13] but the times that i felt closest to god
[1:44:15] and i felt the presence of god the
[1:44:17] nearest and i've seen god's hand the
[1:44:19] mightiest and were the most difficult
[1:44:21] times in my life
[1:44:23] the hardest trials the deepest trials
[1:44:25] the most confusing time the times that
[1:44:28] hurt
[1:44:28] my heart was crushed i was inside a mess
[1:44:31] the times that i was the lowest is when
[1:44:33] i felt him the nearest
[1:44:36] and these trials bring us into a closer
[1:44:38] fellowship
[1:44:40] there have been times where i've
[1:44:41] literally
[1:44:43] prayed all through the night with no
[1:44:44] sleep at all
[1:44:46] but i have never once done that when
[1:44:48] times were good
[1:44:52] i wish i had a different testimony i
[1:44:53] wish i could say i pray through the
[1:44:55] night once a week
[1:44:57] but it was the press of the trial that
[1:44:59] created a need in me that needed me only
[1:45:01] had one solution and that one solution
[1:45:03] was gone and i cried out and cried out
[1:45:05] and cried out until he come on the scene
[1:45:07] to deliver me and and there's times like
[1:45:10] that that i could feel his presence
[1:45:12] drawing so near and he moved in
[1:45:13] supernatural ways to deliver and the
[1:45:16] times i have felt the closest to god
[1:45:18] have been the worst times in my life
[1:45:22] and so
[1:45:23] we can testify that what the prophet of
[1:45:24] god says is true
[1:45:26] god harnesses trouble
[1:45:28] he puts bits in his mouth and makes it
[1:45:31] obey him
[1:45:32] and those troubles bring us into a
[1:45:35] closer fellowship
[1:45:36] with god
[1:45:39] there had been no rainbow until the
[1:45:41] flood come
[1:45:43] but after noah was pressed into that
[1:45:44] condition that he was in to float 40
[1:45:46] days and nights in the storm the little
[1:45:48] ark pitching up and down in the water it
[1:45:50] was after the flood was over that he saw
[1:45:52] the rainbow for its first time the coat
[1:45:55] of hope the covenant of promise after he
[1:45:57] went through the tribulation then he saw
[1:45:59] the promise
[1:46:00] that's the way you see the promise after
[1:46:02] you've gone through the tribulation
[1:46:05] when do you see the promise after you've
[1:46:07] gone through the tribulation i want to
[1:46:08] see the promise prepare to go through
[1:46:10] the tribulation
[1:46:13] he's not talking about the great
[1:46:13] tribulation talking about the
[1:46:14] tribulation of trials and tribulations
[1:46:17] after you've gone to the trial after
[1:46:19] you've gone through the tribulation
[1:46:20] that's when you see the promise
[1:46:23] i want to see the promise i want to see
[1:46:24] the mighty hand of god i want to have a
[1:46:26] testimony go through the trial and
[1:46:28] you'll see the promise
[1:46:32] you know there's i was thinking in
[1:46:34] matthew when jesus was
[1:46:36] he was
[1:46:38] led of the spirit into the wilderness to
[1:46:39] be tempted of the devil and for 40 days
[1:46:41] he fasted and afterward we were hungry
[1:46:43] and we went through the temptation of
[1:46:45] christ a couple weeks ago and talked
[1:46:46] about all of that but but during all of
[1:46:49] that he is battling it out with the
[1:46:51] devil he's being tempted he's standing
[1:46:53] on the word he's fasted 40 days he's
[1:46:55] hungry he's weak he's all of these
[1:46:57] things but when it was over after the
[1:47:00] devil left him
[1:47:02] said angels came and ministered unto him
[1:47:05] you realize the angels could have come
[1:47:07] and ministered to him anytime
[1:47:10] but he had to go through the trial first
[1:47:13] because that was part of the plan of god
[1:47:14] and after the trial angels came and
[1:47:17] ministered unto him
[1:47:19] and we want angels to come and minister
[1:47:21] unto us but when you watch the pattern
[1:47:23] in the scripture the pattern in the
[1:47:25] scripture is clear
[1:47:27] that god there's many trials many
[1:47:30] troubles but he delivers from them all
[1:47:32] and he pours out blessing and he pours
[1:47:34] out comfort and peace and he comforts us
[1:47:37] and he sends angels to minister to us
[1:47:39] but many times it's like it was for
[1:47:40] jesus after the trial after the trial is
[1:47:43] over when we've overcome by the word
[1:47:45] then god pours in the spirit and begins
[1:47:48] the mend and begins to heal
[1:47:52] don't forget god loves to test his
[1:47:54] children
[1:47:55] to prove what's inside
[1:47:57] he said i
[1:47:58] i'll read that sentence again that's the
[1:48:00] way you see the promise after you've
[1:48:01] gone through the tribulation i've liked
[1:48:03] that poem or psalm must i be carried
[1:48:06] home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease
[1:48:08] while others fought to win the prize and
[1:48:10] sailed through bloody seas we asked for
[1:48:12] comfort and peace this is my favorite
[1:48:14] quote right here
[1:48:16] we ask for comfort and peace and god
[1:48:18] gives us the best he could give us
[1:48:20] trials and tribulations
[1:48:22] that's better than comfort and peace
[1:48:25] our comforts is just beyond the river
[1:48:28] i think it's interesting how life is set
[1:48:30] up and there's a certain amount of the
[1:48:33] wisdom of god in it all
[1:48:36] because when you're at the maximum of
[1:48:38] your strength
[1:48:40] when you're at the peak of your life
[1:48:43] you have no life experience and you have
[1:48:45] no money
[1:48:49] when you are the strongest and the most
[1:48:52] capable when your mind is the sharpest
[1:48:54] and your body can go work 24 hours a day
[1:48:57] you have no life experience nobody
[1:48:59] trusts you with anything banks won't
[1:49:01] loan you money and you have no money and
[1:49:03] you can't do anything you just have to
[1:49:04] get down and work really hard
[1:49:07] and piece together what you can try to
[1:49:09] have a home and try to get a car and
[1:49:10] just make it make it make it and then
[1:49:12] because of those experiences you learn
[1:49:14] how to save a little money because you
[1:49:15] never had any money you save a little
[1:49:17] money you might invest a little bit of
[1:49:19] money you work so many years in some
[1:49:20] place and then you get up to the age of
[1:49:22] retirement and when you get up to the
[1:49:23] age of retirement now you got a little
[1:49:25] bit of money you gotta you got a home
[1:49:27] you got a little bit of wisdom people
[1:49:29] trust you banks will loan you money but
[1:49:30] you've learned i don't want their money
[1:49:32] because there's interest
[1:49:34] credit cards will send you all the
[1:49:35] credit cards you want but you learned
[1:49:36] something when you were young and now
[1:49:38] you don't want them
[1:49:40] but you retire and you've got a little
[1:49:42] bit of something and and you're a little
[1:49:44] bit uh able financially but your body's
[1:49:46] starting to deteriorate
[1:49:49] you can't do what you used to do you
[1:49:50] can't hear like you heard you can't see
[1:49:51] like you say you used to see and you
[1:49:53] don't enjoy the things that you thought
[1:49:54] you were going to enjoy
[1:49:56] he said when i retire i'm going to get a
[1:49:57] bass boat and then you retire and you're
[1:49:59] like man that's a lot of maintenance and
[1:50:03] you got to change the oil in them and
[1:50:04] buy insurance and
[1:50:09] when i retire i want to get a camper and
[1:50:10] tour of the world but oh man i'm so
[1:50:12] tired of driving
[1:50:14] i don't want to drive from place to
[1:50:15] place like that then you got to set the
[1:50:17] camper up and then you got to tear it
[1:50:19] down
[1:50:21] is that
[1:50:22] right
[1:50:24] god has a way of keeping things in
[1:50:26] equity
[1:50:30] in the end of your life when you have
[1:50:32] means
[1:50:33] your body's failing
[1:50:35] you can't even use those means like you
[1:50:37] thought you were when you started saving
[1:50:38] when you were 25
[1:50:41] but god has a way of keeping us all in
[1:50:43] need
[1:50:45] keeping us all
[1:50:47] in need of him and he always has a way
[1:50:51] you know it's amazing somebody can be
[1:50:53] wealthy or financially independent but
[1:50:55] that never stops their troubles from
[1:50:56] coming
[1:50:59] it doesn't stop sickness from coming it
[1:51:01] doesn't stop hospital visits from coming
[1:51:03] or family dying or loved ones leaving
[1:51:06] the truth
[1:51:08] doesn't matter how secure homes paid off
[1:51:10] and have a nest egg it doesn't stop
[1:51:12] troubles
[1:51:15] there's always something that god is
[1:51:18] going to use to mold our character to
[1:51:20] prove that his word still works in our
[1:51:22] lives that we can trust in him and have
[1:51:24] confidence we're still going to be
[1:51:26] leaning on him we're never going to be
[1:51:27] leaning on ourselves
[1:51:30] so
[1:51:32] i want to learn to me i want to learn
[1:51:34] that now
[1:51:36] you know how many times in your life
[1:51:38] have you built a little bit of security
[1:51:40] a little bit of something you know
[1:51:42] you're starting to feel good about a
[1:51:43] little bit of savings a little bit of
[1:51:44] that and all of a sudden god allows a
[1:51:45] wind to come and blow it all away
[1:51:48] it's just
[1:51:51] the bible says riches have wings like an
[1:51:53] eagle and they fly away
[1:51:55] i can say they got big wings
[1:51:57] they can fly fast and they can fly far
[1:52:00] because he wants to be your security
[1:52:04] that doesn't mean we live foolishly we
[1:52:06] don't save and we don't put money aside
[1:52:07] for needs in the future that's wisdom
[1:52:09] that's right but god has a way if we're
[1:52:11] having some confidence in that god has a
[1:52:13] way of letting it just
[1:52:15] go like this
[1:52:17] and you go well
[1:52:18] i never had it to start with anyway so
[1:52:21] praise god
[1:52:23] praise god anyways god wants to be our
[1:52:26] security he wants to be our support he
[1:52:28] wants his word his character to be all
[1:52:31] that we're focused on that i have a
[1:52:33] heavenly father i've got a husband who
[1:52:35] takes care of me i don't have to take
[1:52:37] care of myself i'm not depending on
[1:52:39] myself i do what's right i do what's
[1:52:41] wise i do what the scripture says but
[1:52:43] i'm not depending on any of that my
[1:52:45] confidence is in him everything else
[1:52:47] will fade away but he will never fade
[1:52:49] away
[1:52:52] we ask for comfort and peace
[1:52:55] and god gives us the best he could give
[1:52:56] us trials and tribulations that's better
[1:53:00] than comfort and peace
[1:53:02] our comforts is just beyond the river
[1:53:05] don't you say brother chad i've got
[1:53:07] nothing but trouble praise god that's
[1:53:09] better than comfort and peace
[1:53:12] if you sat down in my office and began
[1:53:14] to go through your troubles and i pulled
[1:53:15] that one out you would just
[1:53:19] but that's what the prophet of god said
[1:53:21] god knows what he's doing in our lives
[1:53:23] and he knows why he's doing it
[1:53:25] and i want to get to the place where i
[1:53:27] can start to embrace it i we pray for
[1:53:29] comfort and peace i'm always i tell you
[1:53:31] i'm always going to pray for comfort and
[1:53:33] peace i can't bring myself to pray for
[1:53:35] trials and tribulations
[1:53:37] i just can't honestly do it
[1:53:40] but i know that no matter what i pray
[1:53:42] he's going to give me what's best for me
[1:53:44] and what his purpose for my life is and
[1:53:46] that's good enough for me that's what i
[1:53:48] really want and god knows my heart
[1:53:50] anyways i'm not asking for an easy life
[1:53:52] so that i never display his word i just
[1:53:54] want to be what he wants me to be
[1:53:56] and i want to do what he wants me to do
[1:53:58] and i want to come through this life
[1:54:00] getting all the character that i can all
[1:54:01] the christ-like character that i can so
[1:54:03] that i can rule and reign with him and
[1:54:05] when god puts you or me or somebody to
[1:54:07] rule over a city or cities we rule it
[1:54:10] exactly the way christ would because we
[1:54:11] gained the character here
[1:54:18] he goes on in this quote he says it
[1:54:19] wasn't until the hebrew children was
[1:54:21] forced into the fiery furnace on one of
[1:54:23] their most outstanding trials that they
[1:54:25] seen one like the son of god standing
[1:54:27] there their troubles produced
[1:54:30] oh
[1:54:31] this quote
[1:54:32] their troubles produced the son of god
[1:54:35] standing among them
[1:54:38] amen
[1:54:41] their troubles how many have you ever
[1:54:43] been in real trouble
[1:54:46] and you know god came on the scene
[1:54:49] you know he showed up
[1:54:53] what produced that your troubles
[1:54:55] produced god and brought him on the
[1:54:57] scene
[1:54:59] their troubles produced the son of god
[1:55:01] standing among them in the breezes to
[1:55:03] wave away the heat wave
[1:55:05] but not until they went into the fire
[1:55:08] did that comforter appear
[1:55:11] it was daniel who had purposed in his
[1:55:12] heart that he not defiled himself with
[1:55:14] the things of the world and was forced
[1:55:16] through a trial whether he'd pray to god
[1:55:18] or go to a lion's den but it was after
[1:55:20] the heat was put on and he was thrown
[1:55:22] into a lion's den that after that he saw
[1:55:25] the angel of the lord standing in the
[1:55:27] midst of him keeping away the great
[1:55:29] pillar of fire standing between him and
[1:55:31] the lions and the lions could not get
[1:55:33] him because he went through the trials
[1:55:34] and temptations and troubles he knew
[1:55:37] that his god was able to deliver him
[1:55:38] from them
[1:55:40] it was abraham after he'd seen the
[1:55:42] ground get barred and the drought come
[1:55:44] and lot separate himself and go down to
[1:55:46] live deliciously into the world it was
[1:55:48] after he had heard the wines and cries
[1:55:50] of his herdsmen with no grass for his
[1:55:52] cattle but he maintained in the land
[1:55:54] that god gave him and told him to
[1:55:56] sojourn in
[1:55:57] and as on that day after he had been
[1:55:59] tried till his patience was at the end
[1:56:02] it was on that day then when after the
[1:56:04] trial was over he spoke face to face
[1:56:07] with elohim under the oak that day
[1:56:09] that's a perspective that we didn't
[1:56:11] always get
[1:56:13] that was after abraham when went through
[1:56:14] the trials and he says when when his
[1:56:16] patience was at the end
[1:56:19] it was on that day
[1:56:21] so what day did elohim show up to speak
[1:56:24] to abraham when abraham was at the end
[1:56:27] of his patience he had stayed where god
[1:56:30] told him to stay he wasn't leaving the
[1:56:31] land this time but all the conditions
[1:56:33] were getting worse and
[1:56:35] and lot was down there living
[1:56:36] deliciously in the land that he chosen
[1:56:38] and abraham stayed up here and it was
[1:56:40] getting worse and worse and worse and
[1:56:42] when he was at the end of his patience
[1:56:43] but he was staying where god told him to
[1:56:45] stay
[1:56:47] it was then that he met elohim face to
[1:56:49] face under the oak that day
[1:56:53] it was after he'd suffered his trials
[1:56:55] after he went through the troubles that
[1:56:57] he'd been through that god appeared to
[1:56:59] him in the form of a man and sat there
[1:57:01] and told him he was married and his
[1:57:02] wife's name was sarah and said she
[1:57:05] laughed at him in the tent behind it was
[1:57:07] there that abraham called him elohim it
[1:57:09] was after the trial and tribulation
[1:57:16] brother goes on to say
[1:57:19] in the message desperations
[1:57:21] so now we're talking on desperation for
[1:57:23] a few minutes now usually it takes a
[1:57:25] state of emergency
[1:57:26] to throw us into desperation it's too
[1:57:29] bad it has to be that but human beings
[1:57:31] are so slothful in their mind that it
[1:57:33] takes an emergency
[1:57:36] maybe sometimes the emergency is god's
[1:57:38] grace
[1:57:40] because humans are too slothful in their
[1:57:42] mind
[1:57:43] we think it's punishment we think it's
[1:57:45] terrible it's a horrible thing maybe
[1:57:47] that emergency is god's grace and the
[1:57:49] best thing that's ever happened to us
[1:57:53] something arises and when they do it
[1:57:55] throws us into that desperation and
[1:57:57] really in doing that in desperation it
[1:57:59] brings out that real thing that you are
[1:58:02] it shows what you're made out of and the
[1:58:04] time of desperation it usually pulls out
[1:58:06] all the good things that's in you
[1:58:10] we think that these fire trials are here
[1:58:12] to destroy us they're not here to
[1:58:13] destroy us
[1:58:15] they're here to make us
[1:58:17] they're here to perfect us
[1:58:18] these things that happen will continue
[1:58:20] to happen
[1:58:22] they're here to draw something out of us
[1:58:24] that's down inside
[1:58:25] something that we may not even realize i
[1:58:27] mean we may not realize we have the
[1:58:29] strength you know so many people say oh
[1:58:31] i don't know what i would ever do if a
[1:58:33] certain loved one passed away i don't
[1:58:34] know how i would deal with it you don't
[1:58:35] know that the strength to overcome that
[1:58:37] lays in you
[1:58:39] i don't know what i would do if this
[1:58:40] happened i don't know what i would do if
[1:58:41] that happened i don't know what i would
[1:58:43] do and you don't know that the strength
[1:58:45] already lays inside of you by the spirit
[1:58:47] of god dwelling in you that there's a
[1:58:49] seed of god there and the word of god to
[1:58:51] overcome every obstacle and sometimes
[1:58:54] god allows these things to come to draw
[1:58:55] all of those good things out of us and
[1:58:57] we find out that his word is enough amen
[1:59:01] his spirit can take me through
[1:59:03] and we wouldn't have known it
[1:59:05] if we hadn't had to face it
[1:59:08] but when we face it then we know it
[1:59:12] brother brahm says in the message
[1:59:13] jehovah jireh
[1:59:15] now god loves to test his people
[1:59:19] every child that comes to god must be
[1:59:21] tested child trained no exceptions
[1:59:23] everyone
[1:59:24] and maybe tonight that you're sick just
[1:59:26] to have a little child training just a
[1:59:28] little testing
[1:59:30] don't be discouraged
[1:59:32] god is on the throne he knows all things
[1:59:35] if we're truly born of the spirit of god
[1:59:37] everything's working together for our
[1:59:39] good he's going to make everything right
[1:59:41] he promised he would he swore he would
[1:59:44] and he's got to keep that word he's kept
[1:59:47] it now for thousands of years to every
[1:59:49] believer would you be an exception
[1:59:52] and the answer is
[1:59:53] no
[1:59:55] i'm not an exception
[1:59:56] has god forgot you
[1:59:58] no
[1:59:59] is your trial too hard no is it outside
[2:00:02] the word no is the word quit working no
[2:00:06] god is still showing himself mighty
[2:00:10] on our behalf
[2:00:11] he's still a healer he's still a
[2:00:14] deliverer he's still a savior he's still
[2:00:17] all of those things
[2:00:20] and you and i are going to be a witness
[2:00:23] and we are going to have something to
[2:00:25] testify about
[2:00:27] and you think about
[2:00:29] uh we talked about daniel and the lion's
[2:00:31] den and the three hebrew men when they
[2:00:33] went into the fiery furnace brother bam
[2:00:35] said it was there that the comforter
[2:00:37] showed up in the fiery furnace not along
[2:00:39] the way when they got in
[2:00:41] but their troubles produced the son of
[2:00:43] god
[2:00:45] i mean you think about
[2:00:47] when when paul was on that ship for 14
[2:00:50] days they never saw nor moon or star
[2:00:52] they all was lost i thrown out the
[2:00:54] tackle the ship was the rigging was
[2:00:56] thrown out everything was broke down
[2:00:58] there was certain death coming it was
[2:00:59] then that he met an angel that told him
[2:01:01] all would be well
[2:01:03] it was when peter was in prison chained
[2:01:05] between two guards then an angel showed
[2:01:07] up to him and let him out of prison
[2:01:09] when when he was in prison chained
[2:01:10] between two guards
[2:01:12] talking about impossible circumstances
[2:01:14] if you ever find yourself in prison
[2:01:15] chained between two guards amen you have
[2:01:17] an example to look to it was peter
[2:01:22] it was when when it was when the
[2:01:24] disciples had gone into the boat and
[2:01:26] pushed off into the sea of galilee and
[2:01:29] the storm came and the devil was trying
[2:01:31] to swamp the ship and kill them all and
[2:01:33] they all given up on life it was then
[2:01:35] jesus came walking on the water
[2:01:38] it was in that trial that peter found
[2:01:41] out he could walk on water by faith too
[2:01:44] amen do you realize that the situation
[2:01:48] that produced that a man a sin born man
[2:01:51] walking on water was one of the most
[2:01:53] horrible situations that those fishermen
[2:01:55] had ever faced
[2:01:57] they were going to die they knew they
[2:01:58] were going to die they had given up all
[2:02:00] hope they would no way they could direct
[2:02:02] the ship they had been on sea all of
[2:02:03] their life and they had given up all
[2:02:05] hope it was the worst storm of their
[2:02:06] lives the worst condition the closest
[2:02:08] they were to death
[2:02:11] and in that trial peter figured out
[2:02:13] that a human being by faith can walk on
[2:02:15] water
[2:02:18] amen
[2:02:19] what have we figured out in trials
[2:02:22] you know we figured out that blind eyes
[2:02:24] could open be open is that what we saw
[2:02:27] in the ministry in the last day
[2:02:29] that means somebody had to be blind so
[2:02:32] that blind eyes could be open
[2:02:34] you know we learned that god can raise
[2:02:36] the dead
[2:02:38] can god raise the dead
[2:02:40] somebody's got to die so god can raise
[2:02:42] the dead
[2:02:43] mary and martha suffered so god could
[2:02:46] raise lazarus
[2:02:48] you see god is always doing something we
[2:02:52] have to just trust him and let him do
[2:02:53] what he's doing and stop letting the
[2:02:56] devil say
[2:02:57] you're this and you're that and you're
[2:02:58] not this and
[2:03:01] say devil you don't know nothing really
[2:03:03] you don't know what's going to happen
[2:03:05] you don't know what god's plan is but
[2:03:06] one thing i know is god has me in the
[2:03:09] palm of his hand and i am one that the
[2:03:11] father has given them and he will not
[2:03:12] lose me
[2:03:14] he cannot lose me he's already given me
[2:03:17] a promise i have a witness in my heart
[2:03:19] he cannot lose me
[2:03:22] i don't know what will happen i don't
[2:03:23] know what god's plan is i'm not going to
[2:03:25] pretend to know what's planned but i
[2:03:26] know his word works and he's working in
[2:03:28] me something for his glory and for my
[2:03:32] good
[2:03:34] i say
[2:03:35] trials and tribulations are here to stay
[2:03:39] the opening of the seals didn't take him
[2:03:40] away
[2:03:44] the revelation of the word didn't take
[2:03:46] away our troubles
[2:03:48] but let the revelation the word lift
[2:03:49] your head above those of your enemies
[2:03:53] so that you can offer in the midst of
[2:03:55] trouble a sacrifice of joy
[2:03:58] that we can sing praises to the lord let
[2:04:00] the revelation
[2:04:02] give us a better understanding
[2:04:04] not a false belief that because of i'm
[2:04:07] the bride and because i've been lifted
[2:04:09] up out of laodicea now all the troubles
[2:04:12] have vanished they haven't vanished
[2:04:13] friends
[2:04:15] but our head has been lifted up above
[2:04:17] our enemies
[2:04:19] we've been taken up on eagle's wings and
[2:04:21] flown over the situation and now the
[2:04:24] earthly is becoming more understandable
[2:04:27] by the heavenly perspective
[2:04:29] now all of this
[2:04:31] is in the hand of god
[2:04:33] and i'm in the hand of god and these
[2:04:35] trials were never sent to harm us they
[2:04:38] were sent to perfect us
[2:04:40] and to glorify god
[2:04:42] amen god bless you let's all stand
[2:04:45] musicians if you come
[2:04:57] the apostle paul
[2:05:00] has a testimony
[2:05:04] and that testimony was god could
[2:05:05] preserve him
[2:05:07] through shipwreck
[2:05:09] through beatings
[2:05:10] through persecutions
[2:05:12] stonings and all of the above his
[2:05:15] testimony was god could keep him
[2:05:17] but look at what he had to go through to
[2:05:19] get that testimony
[2:05:20] peter had a great testimony john has a
[2:05:23] great testimony the three hebrew boys
[2:05:25] they have a great testimony daniel has a
[2:05:28] great testimony moses had a great
[2:05:30] testimony amen they all have a great
[2:05:31] testimony but what made their testimony
[2:05:34] was their test
[2:05:37] and i say god
[2:05:38] thank you
[2:05:40] for your great love
[2:05:42] and for teaching us through this
[2:05:43] ministry through the prophet of god to
[2:05:46] teach us to give us understanding that
[2:05:48] we don't have foolish ideas and foolish
[2:05:50] notions but that our head can be lifted
[2:05:52] above our enemies and we can understand
[2:05:54] what's going on all around us so the
[2:05:55] next time all the forces of hell gather
[2:05:58] against us and all the trouble on this
[2:06:00] earth starts to come our way we can say
[2:06:03] though he try me yet i shall come forth
[2:06:05] as golem
[2:06:06] this won't harm me
[2:06:08] man let's bow our heads
[2:06:10] let's pray
[2:06:13] lord jesus we thank you for the
[2:06:14] privilege lord
[2:06:16] that you have given us in this day by
[2:06:18] sending a prophet
[2:06:20] and sharing your mind with us

[2:06:40] financial need you provided lord when
[2:06:42] there was no way you've made a way lord
[2:06:45] and we have great testimonies we could
[2:06:47] go around the room lord and testify for
[2:06:49] hours of what you've done
[2:06:52] god we thank you for that
[2:06:54] god i just pray lord that you would take
[2:06:56] away all fear that we wouldn't fear that
[2:06:59] we wouldn't that we wouldn't have
[2:07:00] anxiety lord but we would learn to rest
[2:07:03] knowing that all is well
[2:07:05] may you plant that revelation deep in
[2:07:07] our hearts and take all the poison of
[2:07:10] the devil of those lies away from us
[2:07:13] so that we would know no matter what the
[2:07:15] circumstances
[2:07:16] you're still the captain of the ship
[2:07:19] no matter what's happening and what it
[2:07:20] looks like

[2:07:24] the world and you're only working your
[2:07:25] plan
[2:07:26] to magnify yourself
[2:07:28] and to build us up

[2:07:32] your faithfulness for what you've done
[2:07:34] and what you're doing
[2:07:36] i pray to take us all lord and mold that
[2:07:39] beautiful character in each one of us
[2:07:41] and help us lord to have a testimony
[2:07:44] that will defeat the devil
