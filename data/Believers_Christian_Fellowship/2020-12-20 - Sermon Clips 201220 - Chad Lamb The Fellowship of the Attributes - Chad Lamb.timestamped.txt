[0:00] what changed you is you realize that
[0:02] this revelation coming to you was
[0:04] calling your name
[0:04] that you believed it and he was saying
[0:06] you're part of this you're the name that
[0:08] was there
[0:09] all of these things i'm showing you what
[0:11] i've done how i've redeemed my whole
[0:13] plan because now i've come to the end of
[0:15] that plan
[0:16] and i'm showing you what the plan was so
[0:18] that i can open the book and show you
[0:20] your name is on this book
[0:21] that's what thrilled our hearts at the
[0:23] opening of the seals
[0:27] don't let anything change how can you
[0:29] change that you can't change what's in
[0:31] that book
[0:36] so
[0:40] just stick with the word just believe
[0:43] what he said
[0:45] say what the tapes say say it
[0:48] i mean if they hook you to a lie
[0:50] detector and the lie detector goes off
[0:51] red red red red red he's lying i'd say
[0:54] it anyways
[0:58] because i believe that word before i
[1:00] believe my own thoughts and my own flesh
[1:02] body
[1:02] and my own ability to perspirate and get
[1:04] nervous when i begin to say things
[1:06] the word is still true regardless of my
[1:08] reaction regardless of my thoughts
[1:10] regardless of my mind
[1:11] the word is true always true always will
[1:14] be true
[1:14] i want to say what the tapes say i want
[1:16] to say what the scriptures say
[1:17] and not say what i'm feeling right now
[1:22] because if you wait 15 minutes your
[1:24] feelings will change amen but this word
[1:25] will never change
[1:27] god's feeling for you won't change his
[1:29] love for you won't change
[1:31] your position in him won't change but
[1:32] your feelings will change your thoughts
[1:34] will change
[1:35] your understanding will change
[1:39] so stick with the word
[1:44] praise god we're still reading in sirs
[1:46] we would see jesus from 1964.
[1:49] i said this is review there's a lot of
[1:51] review but this is so important friends
[1:53] this is a revelation this is something
[1:55] we've heard and heard and heard
[1:57] but the implication has got to change
[1:59] our lives
[2:00] the implication has got to be manifest
[2:03] in the way we speak and the way we act
[2:05] and the way we view things around us
[2:06] this this is statements with
[2:08] implications the implications have to
[2:10] become tangible
[2:12] it's gotta it's gotta stop being
[2:14] conceptual it's gonna stop
[2:15] being an idea that's exciting it's gonna
[2:18] stop being something brother branham
[2:19] said that i can say amen to
[2:20] or the preacher gets everybody riled up
[2:22] by saying these things it's got to move
[2:23] from conceptual a thrilling concept
[2:26] it's got to be tangible in our lives
[2:27] where i say that's me
[2:29] that's the truth that's the reality and
[2:31] everything else is a lie
[2:33] so we'll repeat it and we'll repeat it
[2:35] and we'll repeat it
[2:36] and we'll repeat it till something
[2:38] inside clicks and say that's not a neat
[2:40] idea
[2:41] that's who i am
