========================================
everything all around us can be falling apart and be shaken like there can be you know atmospheres of uncertainty and that uncertainty can get closer and closer to us amen there can be still more fallout from the pandemics and other things and other tensions that are going on there can be many more things that take place and a lot more repercussions and more uncertainty either in this wave or another wave or another thing that strikes there whatever it is and that uncertainty can get closer and closer to home it can affect our employment our jobs and it can affect all kinds of things but but we are secure in a kingdom that cannot be shaken so everything all around us become start falling apart we've got to realize that it has to fall apart it's got to fall apart the world is falling apart brother brenham said let it fall apart and we work so hard sometimes to hold things together what we need to do is resolve ourselves to the fact that it's going to crumble it's going to burn everything on this earth that is not redeemed as cannon fodder will be burnt over to create a bright new millennium for the bridegroom and the bride to step out on it's part of god's plan it's part of god's program god foresaw and god knew and this is the way things have to be and we don't want to fret too much about the way things are going because it's the way things need to be you know you can get discouraged when we see news and things changing and and the culture changing and the laws changing and the politics changing you can become discouraged but but don't let that discouragement stay look back to the word and realize these things must be this way i'm encouraged amen i told somebody the other day you know you know what the discussion was of gun control and and you know my i think my boys were asking me because they were a little bit nervous about losing their hunting guns and we love to hunt you know something as a family that we enjoy to do and to do that we enjoy our guns but i was talking to a brother and i said when they when they knock on my door and they change the laws and we're no longer allowed to have a gun and it's forbidden you know what i'm not going to be burying them in my backyard i'm not going to be storing up ammunition i'm not going to start a fight with the government because these things have to go that way i will take my gun in my hand i will forfeit it with a smile on my face because my days on earth are almost done i'm part of a kingdom that can't be shaking if you take this from me you'll never take the millennium from me you'll never take my position in security in christ you'll never take the peace that i have in my heart you can take privileges you can take rights amen you can take anything you want but you're not going to take the kingdom away the kingdom is here on earth it's in the heart of his bride
