TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and i heard about a mansion he had built for me in glory and i heard about the streets of old beyond the crystal sea about the angels singing and the old redemption story and some sweet day i'll sing up there the song of victory oh victory in jesus my savior forever he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood he loved the air i [Music] he plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing victory in jesus my savior forever [Music] his redeeming blood he loved the air i knew him and all my love is to him he plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood amen victory in jesus fill my god [Music] my soul [Music] feed me [Music] is [Music] the hearts for the water [Music] my soul is thirsting for the lord my heart cries out for the life [Music] [Music] amen god bless you this evening amen let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for the privilege of gathering again god each time is a special time lord may we just focus our attention on you lord no matter what we've been through today and this week and what's going on god may we be able to divert ourselves from the distractions that are in the world and focus our time and attention and our minds on you lord god may you just peel back the pages of your word and reveal yourself to us give us that fresh portion of manna for today may it sustain us lord maybe grow thereby may we be encouraged and edified lord may you set us on our right path lord we pray you take preeminence all that's said are done for we thank you lord for this opportunity that we have to commune with you prayed you would bless it now in jesus christ's name amen and god bless you while we're standing let's take our bibles and you will turn with me to john chapter six i'll let you know that i spoke with brother jim rast today just a little bit ago and he's back home the doctor said the surgery went well and he's got to start therapy and rehab and all of that so pray for him that it'll all go quickly and go smoothly for him he's in quite a bit of pain but just pray for him but the gym is super tough and so he'll be all right but just pray that it all goes quickly and smoothly for him also i want to let you know that i talked with brother levi yoder and he wanted to share a testimony he had a driver driving here um some time ago i don't know i don't remember when several months ago somebody they hired to drive him here for service and that driver sat through service but that driver had gotten the complications with his wife and his name's mr jacobs and they were heading for divorce and and if you remember levi i put in a request one time for him to pray for him and his wife and he wanted to give a testimony back to the church and thank the church for praying that god canceled their divorce and they're working things out and so i thought that was encouraging how many times have the lord done that for us you know for a neighbor or a co-worker or somebody who's helped us out and they ask us to pray and we pray and god moves we don't always hear the outcome but this was encouraging to hear and then god is good and say welcome to our visitors i believe we have a family visiting from montana god bless you it's good to have you here man you're very welcome amen is everybody happy today happy to hear the word of god billions of people are on this planet but god allows us to hear the true word what a privilege that is we should never take it lightly and i'm afraid sometimes we do and i'm guilty of that myself but i want to remind myself this is a privilege amen we're a privileged people let's look at john chapter 6 verse 63 together scripture says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life amen you can have your seats we ask the lord to bless us as we look into his word amen let's turn over to john chapter 12. just a few chapters over john chapter 12 and we'll begin at verse 44. and from this scripture i've drawn my text and i'll give you the title after i read this in john chapter 12 verse 44 jesus cried and said he that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me i am come a light unto the world that whosoever believeth on me should not should not abide in darkness and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not for i come not to judge the world but to save the world he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he gave me commandment what i should say and what i should speak and i know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoever i speak therefore even as the father said unto me so i speak so i want to look at these last two verses again but i drew out of there a text for tonight the word in season is life everlasting so think about that the word in season is life everlasting and so look at verse 49 again with this and thought this thought this title in our minds for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he gave me commandment so this is the commandment what i should say and what i should speak so jesus said i'm speaking what the father has commanded me i'm speaking the words that i'm giving you are directed from the father the father is giving the right word for the right season for the right time amen and it's coming forth according to god's purpose and god's decree so that's the commandment that he would only speak what the father spoke he says and i know that this commandment is life everlasting what is life everlasting amen to speak what the father said speak amen that's why i said the word in season is life everlasting because jesus was bringing the word in season amen that's why they rejected him they didn't reject him for the miracles they rejected him for the word and season amen when he says i am the son of god the father and i are one amen they begin to reject him when he began to try to turn them away from their traditional understanding and bring them to present truth they began to reject him they did not reject him for the miracles they did not reject him for reading moses amen they rejected him for the god giving him a commandment to only speak present tense truth and when he spoke by commandment of god he said this commandment is life everlasting amen so the word in season is life everlasting when the god commissions and commands a word to be spoken and that vessel he commissions and commands to speak that word and that word is the father's word for the the season and the time that commandment is life everlasting brother branham says in the message future home said what if moses would have come with noah's message and noah was part of it but it wouldn't have worked if jesus would have come with moses message it wouldn't have worked if jesus had come with the signs and the miracles and moses's message they would have never rejected him but they rejected him because of the message he brought not because of the miracles he worked if jesus would have come with moses message it wouldn't have worked it was a different age it was a different prophecy a different part of the word had to be fulfilled there they was in another day of the week not tuesday's work can't be done on wednesday and wednesday has got to be done on wednesday see saturday has to be saturday's work see and they was they was recognized oh moses we have moses he said if you'd have known moses you would have known me for he was the one that spoke of me the lord your god shall raise a prophet like an unto me get the idea oh my then jesus said in john 14 when he the holy ghost is come he will bring these things to your memory see show you what day you're living in what is the holy ghost going to do show you what day you're living in amen that that's what that's what brother ben is telling us here when the holy ghost come he will bring these things to your memory see show you what day you're living in and then another thing you'll know him by he'll show you things to come see right back to the prophetic again when he's come so the holy ghost will show you what day you're living in the holy ghost won't point you backwards but it'll show you where you're at and what's coming amen and the invisible union says the word that fell on the day of pentecost will not work this day no sir that was for pentecost this is for the bride going home of the bride we got something different the pentecostals represented that again we're in the bright age no more than the word of noah would work in the days of moses no more than moses law would have worked in the time of paul here so brother venom is making it very clear that the the age we're in is the bride age and it takes the word for the bride age amen that's the only word that will work and that is what the father has commanded to be spoken in the end time and he used the prophet at the end time to bring the father's word amen brother branham didn't conjure up the message he didn't invent the message he didn't he didn't speak of his own idea god supernaturally called him called him out amen he was born under a sign born under a special birth amen there was an angel that appeared at his birth as a dove all of these things came together amen to signify that this is a chosen vessel he did not choose himself god chose him and god commissioned him and commanded him what to speak amen and he spoke the message of the hour which was the word in season amen and that season that he was to bring the bride to was the bride age so he brought a bright age message for a bright age season and that word that commanded by the father to speak is life everlasting amen let's look at john chapter 6 again go back with me to john chapter 6. we'll pick this up in verse 67 just a little further down from where we were reading john 6 67 then said jesus unto the twelve will you also go away then simon peter answered him then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art the christ the son of the living god so peter looks at jesus and jesus you know there's a there's a great falling away jesus is saying things that they don't understand they're rejecting and falling away he turns to the disciples he said well you go also and he said to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life peter is looking at a man that's standing before him and that man is the chosen vessel of god the son of god with the word that god commanded him to speak for that season and he says thou hast the words of eternal life when he sees that statement you have to ask yourself well what about moses what about isaiah what about the torah what about all the scrolls see peter wasn't denying moses he wasn't denying isaiah he wasn't denying anything that happened before all of that was building to this amen moses was speaking of this day isaiah was speaking of this day it was all speaking of the day and the hour that we were in but peter had a capacity something down on the inside could look at this man this physical man standing before him and say thou hast the words of eternal life you know can you imagine a pharisee standing beside him and saying ah you didn't even read that out of the torah you were you weren't saying moses you weren't saying isaiah you weren't saying you were looking at this vessel and you were saying thou hast the words of eternal life but it was every bit the truth and to reject what what jesus christ was speaking in that day was to reject eternal life so in no way was peter diminishing moses's ministry moses played his part to bring him to the day where christ would appear in flesh everything was building upon another upon another upon another building through the old testament building through the patriarchs and through the prophets and the psalms building all the way up until the capping off the culmination of it all was jesus christ the son of god made in the flesh standing there before them and he was given the message he was given the commandment of the father what he should speak and when he spoke that he knows that that commandment is life everlasting and peter was picking up on it and says thou hast the words you you have the words of eternal life and so there was no diminishing of a previous prophet the previous prophet was pointing to this dispensation that's why when we come to the end time there's no diminishing of any church age there's no diminishing of any previous messenger because they were all building to this they were all building back to a bride that would reflect perfectly reflect the word that would be married to jesus christ perfectly reflecting the nature the character the word to be manifested in flesh and a body of believers that was to be the completed body of jesus christ paul was pointing to this paul was saying you know my little children who might travail and birth again until christ be formed in you his desire was christ was reformed in you he was saying i have espoused you to one even to christ amen so now when brother branham comes and you can look at that vessel that prophet and say he has the words of eternal life not because he invented the words of eternal life but because god told him what to speak and what the message was for the hour but it was certainly no diminishing of paul it was the capping off of a foundation that paul had laid and that men had built upon so it was no change it was nothing different it was it was the culmination of the fulfillment so to give respect unto the vessel that god chose and to recognize your message and its day is in no way disrespect to any previous age it is the greatest respect you can pay to every previous age it is no disrespect to to paul or anybody else that's gone before it is the greatest respect that we can pay is to believe that all of that as it culminates and all the truth that build up builds all the way up to the message that god has given us and to receive that is to receive the truth that they were preaching as well but we know that the words that the father has commanded to be spoken is life everlasting let's look at acts chapter 13. acts chapter 13 and verse 46. all right acts 13 and 46 when paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you now i want you to remember paul is a chosen vessel the lord told ananias when ananias was sent to pray for paul he said he is a chosen vessel unto me he was prophesied of in the old testament as one that would and be a light unto the gentiles he was uh he was so he was prophesied to come amen god told ananias that that he's going he's a chosen vessel for me he'll suffer for my name's sake and he was to to bear the message the message of christ he was to take the gospel to the gentiles he was commanded the lord he was given instruction of christ himself and he was taken to the gentiles so when he says that the word of god should first have been spoken unto you paul is a chosen vessel called by god not called by paul and he was commanded he was given the revelation of the message he was told what to speak and when he was speaking that was the commandment of god now he says it was necessary that the word of god should have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles for so hat the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou should just be for salvation to the ends of the earth and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed amen who believed the ones that were ordained to eternal life what did they believe the message that paul and barnabas was carrying to them because paul was a chosen vessel to bring the word as commanded by the father amen and when he brought that word when that word was rejected he's saying seeing that you that you you count yourselves unworthy of everlasting life paul was equating his message to everlasting life what what a statement to make when paul comes and he begins to preach now listen he's preaching in a synagogue in this synagogue they've had the readings of moses and the reasonings isaiah and ezekiel and jeremiah they've been going through the psalms all of their lives they've been hearing this preach and here comes a man preaching something they've never heard before and preaching in a way they've never heard before in taking their bible and doing things with the scripture that they have never seen done with the scriptures before we have to put ourselves in that day paul comes as a chosen vessel commanded to the lord what to say he's got the message of the hour the present tense truth amen and he was sent for salvation to the ends of the world he was sent for salvation he had the message of salvation amen and when that message that he preached amen listen we say how could they deny paul amen in paul's day it was easy to deny paul the only reason that it's that we would say that is because paul has become accepted amen as a as the writer of the new testament the main writer of the new testament and all christendom has accepted this so paul is revered and put on a pedestal in paul's day it wasn't that way in paul's day he was feared and despised by the early christian church because of his persecution of the church and he was loved by his countrymen then when god converted him he was turned amen unto the gentiles and turned to the christians and they didn't all receive him and accept him immediately they still were suspicious of him and all his countrymen now hated him amen and he wasn't accepted by all the believers he wasn't accepted by all those who had joined the faith in fact after several years of ministry there were those that were going down going around and and contesting paul's teaching and contesting his authority as an apostle so here he comes preaching something they've never heard in a way they've never heard and doing things with scriptures they've never seen another man do with the scriptures and you could see our jew would be easy to question what paul was saying it would be easy to reject all your life you've been the chosen the chosen ones the chosen people of god this is all the word of god and now he's coming and yes he's using scriptures but he's doing it in such an odd way but when they begin to reject paul they stayed with their torah when they rejected paul they didn't tear up the writings of moses and throw them on the ground they still had their same scrolls they came to church with that day and they carried them back home and still read them that night for devotions but paul had the truth of what was buried in those scrolls had been revealed to him by the lord and now he was bringing the truth the illumination on those scrolls he had the light of that day that would illuminate the word that they had been reading for generations to show them the true meaning of that scripture but they wanted to stay with the old understanding of that scripture they rejected paul and paul says when you did that amen you have you have deemed yourself unworthy of everlasting life that's why i i use this title i that the title that i used the word in season is life everlasting see we have to understand this message that we have friends it is not a better idea on the word or the correct teaching on the word amen this is life everlasting this is christ himself amen this is the word the message of the hour the word that is in season the very life of christ amen manifested in the present day truth amen it is not just another idea that you can take or not take not a better way but your way still okay but this is a little better way friends this is the way for this day this is the message of everlasting life amen and to reject this amen is to reject life everlasting amen just because it's been hundreds or thousands of years since these things took place in the bible doesn't mean anything's different it's all the same in the message god's only provided place of worship brother bam says the name is in the word we've talked about this before but just pay close attention for a few minutes the name is in the word he's talking about the name of the lord the name is in the word and see we live in a society where the name of jesus is thrown out all the time by multitudes of people and it's referred to i mean they got the name right jesus christ they got the title right lord jesus christ amen brother branham said you can't just have his name by having a pronunciation of words you can't have a correct spelling and a correct pronunciate pronunciation that's not having his name and because he said his name is in the word and the name is in the word because he is the word what is he then the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god and what we have is the word interpreted so we have his name amen so so there's there's the name of jesus is being thrown out all the time it's being thrown out by cr uh those who claim to be christians like i said billions the world over amen but it doesn't mean that they really have his name they have words that they string together and pronounce but that doesn't mean they have his name and just because they say those words god is not obligated to them because they can make a sound over their vocal cords and they can say a name that they recognize to be biblical that is god is not obligated to that but god has attached himself to his word god has obligated himself to his word amen the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god no wonder flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you who i am who is he the word interpreted who is he the word interpreted but i thought he was jesus christ yes jesus christ is the word interpreted because jesus christ is the word amen that's all the way back to john 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god amen and later the word was made flesh and dwelt among us jesus christ is the word amen and the word interpreted is a manifestation of the name and flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you who i am and upon this rock i'll build my place of worship and the gates of hell can't shake it down amen old loving a living church of god stand firm firm foundation on jesus christ alone you can sing the song but if you're not on christ the word you're on teetering faltering sand but upon this rock christ the word that's what the church is built upon upon the revelation of jesus christ and the pergamy in church he says now jesus knew that there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word in the pergamian age which was as yet 200 years off from the patmos vision he knew that drift would cause him to go into the dark ages he knew that the he knew that the way man originally got away from god was by first leaving the word if you leave that word you have left god and you can say any name you want but if you leave the word you've left god that's why amen to have god you must receive his word amen and to leave the word you leave god to reject the word you reject god that's what jesus was saying if you reject me you reject him that sent me so he says if you leave that word you have left god thus he is presenting himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all churches of all ages i am the word if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word oh this is so simple this is so basic but we can never get away from this friend if you want deity in your midst amen then you welcome you can we can want an outpouring of the spirit we can want the life of god the life of jesus christ to be with us so much we can try all kinds of activities and all kinds of prayer meetings and all kinds of super duper this but if you want deity in your midst stay with the word receive the word accept the word the present tense word that has been revealed and brought to us in this day not the previous age word but this age word receive that to have deity in your midst if you he said i am the word if you want deity in your midst and welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word this which i am giving you the word is a revelation of myself i am the word remember that amen and then listen to what the prophet of god says next he says i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst that's one thing that's one statement i want to be a take away statement from today if we can have one i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst amen what was restored to us the word amen what was taken from the church the word what was restored to the church the word amen with the word comes the life with the life comes the power everything we need amen everything that we're meant to have comes by the word god created everything by the word everything for god came by the word everything that come into manifestation from his thought come by the word everything amen that he desired to manifest his thinking came by the word and is an expression of the word so everything is based off the word and the word comes from the thought and the thought is the essence character nature person of god so you can see why to reject the word is to reject god because the word is an outcropping of god because it's the the word is the thought expressed and the thought is the very person of god it is his essence it is who he is and so to reject the word is to reject him but what does it mean then to receive the word we receive him now go back to the statement and continue on he says i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst i don't think we can ever be sufficiently impressed enough so let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in jesus name don't we he's going to give us a super interesting thought here he says now how do we pray we pray in jesus name and so we've done this since we were little kids if we were raised as christians and lord bless my food in jesus name lord do this in jesus name and if we're not careful amen it becomes uh i don't want to say anything wrong but it becomes a formula almost like a a just a statement at the end of a sentence just to finish it up but but this isn't what he's going to say how do we pray we pray in jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer yet in first john 5 14 we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petition that we desire of him now we ask what is the will of god there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of god so we ask according to his will we've asked according to the word and we've asked in his name it's not just the period at the end of the prayer in jesus name it's not just a statement we learn to make as a child but when we pray according to his will we've prayed according to the revelation of his word when we prayed according to the revelation of his word we have prayed in his name that's why we can ask for all kinds of prayers but those prayers are not according to his word and they're not in line with the revelation of his word and we can end them within jesus name in jesus name in jesus name but we're not praying in his name because we're not praying according to the revelation of the word so you say i asked for that in jesus name you didn't ask for it in jesus name you made a statement a traditional statement at the end of your request but your request wasn't in his name because your request wasn't according to his word amen i hope that makes sense so that's why i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst amen we can pray in his name because he has given his will to us in the message we know amen we know what he once done with his word we know his word the word has been restored to us all that's been lost amen down to the church ages has been restored we have the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication the word has been given back to us when the word came back he came back his presence came back his name is attached to his word we have his name we have his presence we have his mind we have his will and when we pray according to the revelation of this that this message has restored then we bask in his name and he does it according to his will so don't you're not wrong with ending your prayer in the name of jesus there's nothing wrong with that we do everything in his name brother branham prayed that way but we have to make sure that we're praying according to his word if we're going to invoke his name so let's continue on with this quote in the pergament church age what is the will of god there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of god lamentation 337 says who is he that saith it who who is he that sayeth and it cometh to pass when the lord commandeth it not there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name there it is again jesus the name is the word the will you can't separate god in his word they are one so how can you ask for something in jesus name that's not according to his will and his will is his word and his word has been restored i hope that helps you understand what i'm trying to say is we're not getting anywhere without the revelation of this hour no matter what we say or what we think without this restored word we're not getting anywhere this word that has been restored through a vessel it is life everlasting in the fourth seal brother ben is going to reference revelation 19 if we could turn there together revelation 19. in verse 1. i'm sorry verse 11 revelation 19 and 11 and i saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he the judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he should rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of almighty god and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords so here in revelation 19 brother brahman the fourth seal is contrasting christ on the white horse versus the pale horse rider and the fourth seal amen and the pale horse rider we know is is named death and it's riding on a mixed colored horse of creeds and denominations and doctrines and all of that from the previous uh four seals or previous three seals and he's death but now he's contrasting it with christ coming on the white horse and his name is called the word of god but i want to read how brother branham describes this now in revelation 19 not only is he getting ready but christ is getting ready to meet him the battle is going to be hot and heavy christ in revelation 19 christ is gathering his not from the four corners of the earth because there's going to be a little bitty remnant what's he doing he's gathering them from the four corners of heaven we'll get them souls under the altar tomorrow night and you'll see whether it's right or not four corners of heaven on a snow white horse he is also has a name not death but the word of god life now brother brahm's doing something now you know the scripture says his name is called the the word of god and brother branham now is equating that to life his name his name is not death but the word of god life he's contrasting him with the horse rider of death on the pale horse now here comes the word of god amen his name is called the word of god riding on a white horse and he's going to call him life because the word of god is life you said the word that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life amen the commandment is the commandment of everlasting life what was the commandment to speak what the father said speak now he's contrasting the word of god life with death god he's got it wrote right on his thigh there the word of god that's the only life because god is the only source of eternal life there is zoe is that right and he's got wrote life now brother brown says he's got wrote life the bible says he's called the word of god but god's brother bam saying he's life that's his title life amen he's got wrote life riding on a white horse and here's a man with three different powers mixed up called death gathering his earthbound delegates and christ is gathering his heaven-born subjects that's me a heaven-born subject amen are you being gathered amen he's got death wrote on him christ got life wrote on him those with him are on white horses also and they are called the chosen before the foundation of the world amen they are faithful to the word amen he goes woo i like that one called chosen before the foundation of the world and then faithful to the word by their choosing all stimulated with new wine and oil just riding right along coming down to meet him they know the thunders will issue the thing course pretty soon see watch how does he do so if he is the word and his name is the word then the word is life amen it's so easy how a prophet just he just begins to draw equal signs here and makes it so easy if he is the word and his name is the word then the word is life amen so how could you take his name and separate it from the word his name is in the word the manifestation of his name the manifestation of the word is the revealing of his name so if he is the word and his name is the word then the word is life and the antichrist anything anti is against so anti is against christ the word so it's got to be a creed or denomination which is against the word so now he's saying this antichrist is is death and it's anything against the word so the word is life anything against the word is death amen it's that easy let's go to first john first john chapter 5. first john chapter 5 verse 10 he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in himself he that believeth not god hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record that god gave of his son listen to that statement he that believeth not god has made him a liar god himself has sent us a prophet in this day god himself sent a prophet and god himself restored the word and if you don't believe that you make him a liar he that believeth on the son of god had this witness in himself that he believeth but he that believeth not god hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record that god gave of his son we've had a restoration of the son of man ministry in our day and god sent it and god did it and god confirmed his word and to reject that is to reject god and this is the record that god has given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life how do you get the son without the word brother man says in the message there is a man here that can turn on the line life is only by the word of god made manifest it's another fantastic statement from december 1963 so hang on to this life is only by the word of god made manifest so and he repeats it again life comes only by the word of god made manifest we can look back what was done but if that doesn't bring it up to date and we don't receive the word today amen life life comes only by the word of god made manifest those disciples could not come to life until they received the word made manifest amen and paul the apostle was trying to bring light and life amen to the to the church he brought them to the synagogue amen there was greeks mixed in there and gentiles and there was jews and he was trying to bring them life but when they rejected the word that he was bringing they rejected the message that he had the gospel he was preaching he says you count yourself unworthy of everlasting life so life comes only by the word of god made manifest amen so nobody nobody could tell those jews in that synagogue that day that had the scrolls tucked under their arm nobody can say you don't have the word of god it's like if somebody's carrying around their bible and they got that bible tucked under their arm amen you're not going to be able to look at them and say you don't have the word of god because we know this is the word of god in print form brother brennan made it so he told i mean he told us it was so you can't look at them jews and say you don't have the word of god but you can say you don't have the word of god made manifest amen you don't have the present tense word you don't have the revelation of the word for today amen and they had the scrolls under their arm amen but they didn't have the word of god made manifest that's what paul was bringing to them and when they rejected that really rejected eternal life and and paul was clear i mean paul didn't he didn't tiptoe around the subject paul was clear so life comes only by the word of god made and manifest as long as it is just in the book like this it still can be questioned but when it's made manifest and you see the product of what it spoke of being manifested then that is light on the word catch what he's teaching us here that is light on the word that's what brings the word said so and then when it comes to past that is life in light light bringing life light brings life amen so when the word is made manifest that becomes the light amen the light of god the light of the hour the word the spoken word amen that's prophesied but when it comes into manifestation that manifested word becomes light amen and that light is the life of men is that right back to john 1 that light is the life of men and so now let's keep reading that that is the life and light light brings life light brings life plant the wheat out there and put it in the basement cover it all over and it'll never bring forth anything because it can't there's no light there but as soon as that light strikes it then it'll bring forth life if it's germatized seed that's the same thing it is with the word see the word is god and when the life strikes it it brings the light strikes it it brings the word to life again every age has always been that oh how we appreciate these great things how the word being vindicated is the light of the spoken word and it is the light that brings life to the seed amen you and i if we're children of god and believers amen if we're the seed of god we had a man a seed of life a portion of god down on the inside and there had to be a light so our that wheat seed in us was in the basement no light was shining on it it wasn't springing to life amen but it had to come in contact with light but what light would make this word live amen i i don't know about you but i was raised in the denominational systems and i had a desire for god i had an emotional attraction to god i wanted to serve god i wanted to be a good boy i wanted to go to heaven i wanted all of those things but there was no quickening power in any of it until i come to this message and this message quickened the seed inside of me what was it about this message amen that the pentecostal church couldn't do for me the pentecostal church could stir my emotions amen because there was a seed there amen there was some response brother brown talks about this he said he said you you some of you can agree with me on these things when you were a boy you know how certain things would move you and you would hear certain things and it'll be that little time he said that was that seed down inside there but it could never bring the seed to life even though there's things i would hear there could be a stimulation and maybe a response but there had to be light to bring this seed to life and that light this seed is word the only thing that will bring the word to life is the word but what kind of word amen i could lay this word on top of me and sleep all night long and it wouldn't bring it to life but it had to be the word manifest which was light amen and that light over this seed would bring it to life i could lay on the bible i could lay under the bible see what i'm saying but the light that brings life is the word made manifest that word made manifest friends is now in you and i god wants his word to live he wants his word to be alive he wants to be manifested and on display the prophet of god says and god is not going to inquire of you how much schooling you got when you were here on earth how much knowledge you accumulated whether you got your bachelor of art or whatever degree you might have been even as a minister it's not going to be required of you but it's going to be required of you what you did about the understanding of god's word that's where the requirement comes my word is life and to know it is life and he said know him he is the word so you can only know him by the word for he is the word that's the only way you'll know him is by the word so to know him as life but the only way you can know him is by the word brother brim says many times he quotes this in a different way many places in the message he says it's not to know the word but to know him as life and here he gives you more information so brother over and over says it's not to know the word but to know him what brother branham is doing he's contesting with theologians who intellectually know the written word they're saying it's not to know the word that's life everywhere else brother i'm saying the word is life the word is life the word is life you have to understand what he's saying when he says it's not to know the word he said not to know just the written word is life but to know him the person of the word is life but how can you know the person of the word outside the revelation of the word for he is the revelation of the word so here he brings some clarity to those statements he says uh uh but the the word of god is life my word is life and to know it is life so it sounds backwards with what he's always been saying and he said know him he is the word so you can only know him by the word for he is the word that's the only way you'll know him is by the word so you must know the person of the word not just written word but living word let's go back to first john first john chapter 5. we'll look at this again first john chapter 5 verse 20. and we know that the son of god has come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son jesus christ this is the true god and eternal life praise god brother ben says in invisible union there is there is your name on the book of life the book of life is the word of god because the word of god because the word is god and god is the only thing that is life so your name was represented in the bible before the bible became onward and if you're here to do that won't it vindicate that word so brother brahm says here is your name on the book of life the book of life is the word of god because the word is god and god is the only thing that is life so your name was represented in the bible before the bible came on word or came on print that means there's something in you that predates the written word that's why you can never deny this word that's why there's an attraction to the word amen because inside is life amen and the revealed word is life and life comes to life light comes the light word comes to word and so that part of us that was in god before the foundation of the world amen that was that that was attracted to the word it was an attraction put in it from before the foundation of the world that the right light the right life would come and spring this to life but there's only one life and that's god let's go look back at chapter one first john chapter one and verse 1 chapter 1 and verse 1. that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that's why to have the son is to have eternal life what is the son it's the word jesus christ is the word he was the logos that came out of the father it was the word coming forth he is the word he is the word has the life is the life of god and and we have that eternal life and paul now john is sitting there saying john is telling us that we have handled the word of life we have touched the word of life amen it wasn't a scroll amen it was manifest in a human being it was jesus christ it was the word made flesh we have handled with our hands of the word of life we have seen with our eyes we have looked upon our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto the that eternal life which was with the father and was manifest unto us and that which came out of the father was the word and the word amen is the son of god and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and they said we touched the word of life amen but when when that body died and raised again life still continued on christ is still living the word is still being made manifest and the word made manifest still has life it is still life and in the message god's power to transform he says and he had spoke the word and his great creating power had formed these things that came up and even the man and the woman they were the head because they were they were super to all other races and he put them also under the care of the same thing that he put trees animals and so forth his word they must never by no means break that word they must stay there don't never take anything from it or add anything to it you must live by this word so he's referring to adam and his wife in the garden of eden when they were in the garden of eden they had life they had life that was never ending the their life was not in danger of ending amen but that life brother ben was telling us is because they were under the word amen they were living in the manifested word of god the the message of their day and they had a word to keep they had a message adam was given a message and that message was don't take of this tree amen and when they left the word death set in so life was staying with the word death was to leave the word so life has always been with the word friends it's always from the very beginning from the earliest story that we have in the bible god is showing us that life is with the word and anything outside the word is death as soon as she left one word death set in so where was her life her life was in the word where did she lose her life outside the word so life is in the word what word the present word she was under present word and when she left that present word death set in that's what the prophet of god is teaching us life is by the word and anointed once at the end time he says now run the scriptures jesus is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh and one among us in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was made flesh and who lived dwelled among us and man shall not live by bread alone for the physical but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god then you see we live by the word and that is god and the third seal he says god promised the spiritual eve as same as he did the natural eve that again the word would be restored to her remember eve had the word do you believe she had the word she had the full word of god for her day and as long as she stayed with that word she had life everlasting so that commandment was life everlasting do we agree when she left that word she lost life but god has promised that he's going to bring the spiritual leave he's going to bring the word back so if he brings the word back what's he bringing back he's bringing back life amen and to stay in that word is life eternal and to leave that word is death see the bible is one story not a bunch of books one story amen and what happened in the beginning god has been working all these years to rectify and bring us back to this place at the beginning and he promised he would bring the word back to eve amen back to spiritual eve which is the bride at the end time and there's been a promise for the word to come back when the word would come back everlasting life would come back and to stay in that word is to have life eternal to leave that word is to leave life to reject that word is to reject life so what god has given us in our day friends this was not another reformer this wasn't another step amen this was the capping off this was the full measure of the word bringing the full life this is everlasting life i just say it this way this message is life everlasting not a better idea a better way to live amen more truth than somebody else this is life everlasting what you carry around inside of you is everlasting life this message this revelation that you have is life everlasting the revelation that you can give to your neighbor to a co-worker to a loved one is everlasting life friends the same way paul was carrying everlasting life you're carrying everlasting life he promised spiritual eve the same as he did natural leave that again the word would be restored to her how did he promise natural eve the word to be restored to her because along with the curse came a promise thy seed shall bruise his head that prophecy was in the natural line and there was a natural woman who conceived amen by the holy ghost and brought forth amen the christ child and she was fulfilling what was it what did mary bring forth the word made flesh what what was restored to the woman natural the word now spiritual leave has been promised what did spiritual eve lose in the 19 council she lost the word amen but what if she promised would be restored to her spiritually she would be restored back to the word now this bride has been impregnated with the word she has life amen she has received life she is carrying life so he goes on to say i want to finish this quote the natural eve that the word would be restored to her in the last days he would restore to the church to the original word again has he done it he's done it in the message things that are to be he says now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word why we are bringing being brought back to eden friends and in order to bring the woman back to eden he has to first bring back the word and she must be tested by that word she cannot leave that word if she leaves the word she leaves life so god has brought back life this word that has been restored is everlasting life and it's bringing us into an eden condition we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour what manifestation the manifestation of the word for this hour that's the word interpreted that's where his name is that's where his presence is that's where life is you and i we're not just people but we're vessels that god has chosen you didn't choose you god chose you you didn't decide god decided you didn't put a seed of a predestination inside of you god put a seed of predestination inside of you you didn't look for light light came to you and when light struck you you came to life amen you weren't in control of it god was in control of it and god has a vessel here that is carrying the word the restored word of the hour amen in that restored word of the hour is being made manifest and a body of believers that are making up the literal body of jesus christ upon the earth and that is where his name is that is where his word is that is where his presence is that is where life is what we have is what paul had in his day and paul was eager that somebody else could have it too and i want to be just as eager what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god and the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living don't forget my title and i don't remember it myself lord have mercy the word in season is life everlasting what season did the prophet tell us we're in we're in the bright age the manifestation of the bride the body of christ on display the word in season is life everlasting he goes on to say the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're not living martin luther could not express the attributes that we express because that was in the beginning the resurrection like the corner wheat that went into the earth you see the whole program the whole church is built upon divine revelation jesus said in matthew the 16th chapter flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you what was it a revelation of who he was and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it see the revelation of jesus christ in this hour not what he was in another hour what he is now the bible expresses it's growing in the bride to the full stature therefore if the corn of wheat of christ had to fall on the ground so did the the bride have to fall on the ground through the dark ages any grain that goes in the ground must die or it can't produce itself reproduce itself and the great church that he established on the day of pentecost by the sending of the holy ghost had to suffer martyrdom and go into the dirt and to the earth into the dark age to bring forth again in the age of luther and come on out to the full stature of the bride of jesus christ for this last day and that is the manifestation of the word for this day it's not trivial friends it's everlasting life brother bram says in the identified masterpiece of god you've got to stay with that word to be the bride if you're in the bride you're in the word and the word is in you what is the word life who is the word christ if you're in the bride you're in the word you're in him and the word is in you you're in him and he's in you if you're in the bride you're in the word and the word is in you and the word that reflected god through christ reflects the same god through you amen amen made so be it so be it i believe it to be the truth you have to be identified with him what is it friends the word in season is everlasting life what we have is what we have is everything not because of us but because of him what paul had was everything they needed in his day amen but they rejected it because it came in a way they didn't expect and it wasn't palatable it was different and god sent a prophet in our day and it came different to the denomination different than anyone expected he spoke different he used the scriptures in a different way because he had the revelation for his hour and he was rejected amen but to reject that ministry to reject that word was to reject jesus christ because the message is christ but the message didn't stop there the messenger came to point us to the message to bring the message and the message was christ is returning but how is returning he's returning as the word and where will the word be the word will be manifested in a people upon the earth which is his bride his body he has a physical body on this earth and that is his bride and that is the message it's christ in the formation of the bride that's to be the manifested word in this day that's where his name is that's why to fight that to deny that to reject that it doesn't matter what else you say amen doesn't matter what words you use amen you're not praying in his name you're outside of his name we've got to come to where god is and where god is working and recognize how powerful it is amen it is life it is the place of life it is where he's dwelling and we have to recognize that it is what the world needs they need this message but they need it more than just in print form they need it in a living form they need to rub shoulders with the word made manifest they need to see the word made manifest at work and in a family and an extended family and in this situation in that situation they need to see the word made manifest because that's where life is they need to come in contact with life that's why communal living will never work the world is falling apart we talked about this sunday who wants to fly away and run away and go live off-grid somewhere in the mountains but you take life when you pull back into the mountains you pull life back into the mountains when you keep away from everybody keep your head down talk to nobody refute you pull life back from the world god did not tell his disciples i'll pray to get you out of the world but i'll pray that god will keep you from the evil in the world we have to be here to shine light amen she will be the final voice to the final age it's not trivial it's not light it's powerful it is life amen we're carrying life we're bearing life we're presenting life we're sharing life it's everlasting life it isn't the message as a form of church and a form of teaching and a form of adherence to codes that's not it friends it's you and christ as persons together sharing life demonstrating life being life man it's not it's not time to settle down into a church and and i'm in the message that term can mean anything it has become it has turned into anything anything you want to be the message has been the message and it's it's a loosely attached to brother branham in one way or another loosely or firmly however you do that if there's an attachment to the messenger saying we believe the message amen but i want to do more than believe the message because the devil believes the message i want to be the message amen i want to be the manifestation of the word for this day and i could only do it if he chose me before the foundation of the world amen if it's his choosing not mine i can't make myself that but if he made me before the foundation of the world then that's my place and i want to be that so how do you be that brother chad you yield yourself to this word and then stop resisting it stop explaining it away stop trying to form it into our own understanding or package it into the package we're most comfortable with but come back to the message and say if that's the way god presented it that's the way i believe it if that's the way the prophet thought it that's the way i believe it if that's the way god wanted me to receive his word and god instructed me then that is the way that i believe it and that's the way i receive it if you're called chosen predestinated then he is needing preeminence and preeminence is not taken by force he takes preeminence as we give him preeminence and i want to live this message because i want to i want to be a vessel carrying eternal life that somebody else can get a hold of i hope i know and trust that you're the same way friends we cannot reject one iota of this message cannot play with this message tamper with it adjust it make it flexible we cannot do leave the message pure like god gave it leave it the way it was presented leave it the way the prophet taught it leave the message alone and just bend yourself and break yourself to it don't bend it to you i don't want to be found rejecting god's word because i didn't understand his ways but i want to yield to that so that the word can be on display in my life a true word a perfect word that carries with it eternal life god bless you let's all stand amen i love the word i love the lord for his goodness to us he's taken away our guessing he's taken away our wondering he's given himself to us and he's given himself and we may ask you know why are there so many ideas about the message and so many concepts listen it's beautiful friends that's why for me i have no desire whatsoever to fight anybody else's concept to what the message is god allowed it if god allowed it leave it alone because god will present himself through the message and somebody else will take that and present it another way and adapt it another way and another way and another way and god will see which one is bride by what she chooses what what way do you want the message packaged do you want it packaged this way do you want it more convenient do you want it a little more strict right if god allows it leave it alone don't fight it but say god reveal to me the truth i want all of you i don't want it perverted i don't want it tainted i don't want to adapt it in some way i want it straight the way you give it amen give me the true message give me yourself in truth and god will allow all kinds of variations and they will stay there you think why won't god destroy those who pervert his word he will after he's accomplished his purpose with them and god is saying which one wants me and which one wants me packaged to suit them i said god help me to only want you and if my ideas have to crumble around my feet let them crumble around my feet but i want you in the genuine truth in which you presented yourself in this age i want the full word i don't even want my idea to mix it up i want to die to my own concept to have the truth because this word given to us in this day is everlasting life let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word we thank you for the beauty of your word for the way that you work lord we love you for that we can see you all down through the ages working the same way god i i praise you lord i thank you god that you've given us ears to hear you've given us eyes to see in our heart to perceive god we could have never given that to ourselves it's a gift you've given us and i'm so thankful for it lord and i'm asking now with all the saints that are present lord would you just break us lord break us and bend us lord that that we wouldn't be rigid lord but we would be flexible to your word that we would break under your word and it would be formed into the perfect image of you lord god break our ideas our concepts our desires our wishes break it all lord on your word that we would fit your mold and we wouldn't make you fit ours lord i love you and i thank you for your goodness to us i pray lord that you keep each one of us lord in the perfect path of light that we might manifest this perfect word god we give ourselves afresh to you you god i pray that you'd shine your light through each individual vessel that we might shine a light in a dark place and another seed might spring to life may we carry your word lord not carry wrong attitudes and wrong thoughts but may we just carry your word through life and may that word have an effect on others around us may you use these vessels to root out that last predestinated seed and bring them to life by the illumination of the word all we thank you for the light that you shined over us to bring us to life now may you do it for others god i pray you have your way with us individually as individuals we yield ourselves to you and collectively lord would you guide us as a body of believers may we stay true to your word in every way and god may we never get in the way or hinder your work but may you move freely through us we love your father and ask that you would have your way in each of us in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] us [Music] such a beauty [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] shine all around us [Music] a vessel of honor [Music] a vessel of honor
