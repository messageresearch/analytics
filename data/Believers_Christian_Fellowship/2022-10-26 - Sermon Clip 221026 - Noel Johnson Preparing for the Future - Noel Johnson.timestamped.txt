[0:00] you do take a five-year-old kid he looks
[0:02] at his father
[0:04] my father is invincible
[0:06] my father is Almighty my father has the
[0:09] brains of the world my dad can do
[0:10] anything because he's my father
[0:14] well my father As I Grew Older I found
[0:16] out actually my dad was limited a little
[0:18] bit here and there okay
[0:21] but my real father God
[0:23] he has no limitations
[0:27] saying bothering me hey Dad
[0:30] can you do something with this guy I'm
[0:32] getting tired of him bothering me all
[0:33] the time
[0:34] he just gave me a Thousand Angels to do
[0:37] just come on you know just give me those
[0:38] and we'll take care of this
[0:41] I'm making it funny but I'm using it to
[0:43] make a point we have access to
[0:45] everything God is we have brother
[0:48] Branham said that God will God will
[0:50] bankrupt Heaven before he'll let one of
[0:52] his promises fall
[0:54] so why don't we access him why don't we
[0:58] treat him like he is our father why
[1:00] don't we love him the way that he
[1:01] desires for us to love him when somebody
[1:04] ask Jesus Christ is what's the greatest
[1:06] of The Commandments
[1:07] is to love God with everything that's
[1:09] within you
[1:11] and then love your neighbor the same way
[1:13] you love yourself
[1:14] and these two Commandments the rest all
[1:16] of us all the laws and all the prophets
[1:19] and if we can begin to hon if we could
[1:21] begin to believe in that God
[1:24] you know God came down on Mount Sinai
[1:27] lightning thundering earthquakes
[1:30] Moses told the people God delivered you
[1:32] from Egypt because he loves you
[1:35] but they suck back in fear
[1:38] oh wow they look at this thing what are
[1:41] we going to do now if I walk in there
[1:42] God's going to smite me or I'll just be
[1:44] his greasy spot
[1:45] when really if they realize that God
[1:47] loved them enough to deliver them from
[1:49] Egypt that God is the one that's applied
[1:52] all their needs as they wander through
[1:53] their Wilderness that God promised to
[1:55] give you the promised land that God has
[1:57] promised to deliver you and take care of
[1:59] you and supply all of your needs that
[2:01] God has promised to heal you
[2:03] who can stand before that
[2:06] that's my God
[2:09] okay
[2:11] manifest yourself a little bit more
[2:13] let's take care of this mess out here
[2:15] because he's my father
[2:17] if all of a sudden somebody was beating
[2:19] if somebody was bothering me my dad
[2:21] would come to my rescue
[2:23] if somebody was messing with my wife I
[2:25] would die trying to take you know making
[2:27] sure that Sushi stayed safe
[2:29] well I'm his bride
[2:31] he loves me I don't know why but he does
[2:35] but here again what's he going to do
[2:37] he's going to protect me he's going to
[2:38] supply for me he's going to watch over
[2:40] me he's going to make sure that
[2:41] everything goes as good as it possibly
[2:43] can
[2:45] because he not only is my father he's
[2:47] also my the bridegroom
