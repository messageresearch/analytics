said if they don't cry out the rocks will cry out somebody's got to glorify his name amen may it never be that a rock will do it but may it be that his children will call out and cry out his glory and

thankful Amen brother Brandon would say you know the the Pentecostals they got the spirit and fundamentalists they got the truth but they can't put it together but in this day the former and latter Reigns falling at the same time and God has put it together so that we can worship the Father the way he wants to be worship amen I hope he doesn't have to look too hard amen hope he can find worshippers that will worship Him spirit and Truth amen we're certainly excited to be together this morning and thank God for the privilege as always and so thankful to have our brother Danny dundo with us from the Philippines been a longtime friend of mine and real help to me we're going to ask him to come and share what's on his heart in just a moment before that we want to say it's been quite a privilege to have brother Paul and sister Nore Harland with us and we know they'll be traveling back tomorrow so God bless you and give you a safe trip and You' certainly blessed us with your presence amen you made an impact on us and we've been blessed also sister zabil and sister tabia they'll be traveling back to Germany so God bless you all with a safe trip and you've blessed us amen so these partings are sorrowful amen but oh it just gives us that much more desire to come to the time where there'll be no more partings no more separations amen but we thank God for the privilege you know brother Danny dundo has been a friend of mine for a long long time amen back long before I was a pastor when I was first ministering I would go out on missions trips and one of the first Brothers to take me under wi was brother Danny and he took me to Indonesia he took me to Myanmar he took me all around the Philippines and I learned a lot from this brother he really influenced me in a very positive way and so I really appreciate amen the impact he's had on the bride all around the world he's been a pastor for 27 years amen and God's used him they started churches started work spread the message and so I counted a privilege to have brother Danny as a friend and it's a privilege to have him Minister for us once again it's been almost 5 years since he was here it's hard to believe amen I know some of you have joined us since that time and maybe haven't got to know brother Danny or heard his ministry but uh I call him Dynamite Danny amen it's always Dynamic and it's always the word of the lord it's always an encouragement in the blessing to me amen so we want him just to relax amen we want him to know he's amongst brothers and sisters amongst family just to relax amen so that God said the key to operating a gift is to relax amen so we want him to relax and then we don't want to relax we want a pull am amen so let's just welcome him now Holy Spirit Thou Art welome here this place Holy Spirit thou are well in this father of mercy and Grace thou art this more Hallelujah let's himly Spirit th this Holy Spirit th welome in this place on father of mercy and gra th in this amen hallelujah I believe he's very much welcome not just in the place in this sanctuary of course he is here but in this place amen not here but here amen amen so we certainly appreciate his presence and uh uh but first of all I would like to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's been quite a while uh since I last came here amen but it's the same brother Danny amen amen uh amen still catching up with this Pulpit amen so nothing else changed uh except this white hair gray hair amen we were uh uh on our way back here uh from the airport brother Chad asks how long have you been pastoring brother Danny and I started counting I said it's over 20 years amen so he said uh no wonder your your hair is white now amen but how long you've been pastoring brother the chat I don't know what happened amen so just uh let my nervous fly out amen so my family my congregation are streaming right now so uh they're praying for me of course praying for each and every one of you and I need your prayer so without further Ado we would like to uh go straight to the reading of the word amen let's read from the book of Matthew uh in chapter 21 we will start from verses verse verse one up to verse 10 uh it says here in verse one and when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem and were come to be unto the Mount of Olives then sent Jesus to disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway you shall find an ass tied and a cult with her loose them and bring them unto me and if anyone say unto you ye shall say the Lord had need of them and straightway he will send them all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughter of Zion Behold thy King cometh unto thee Meek and sitting upon an ass and they called the F of an ass and the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the cult and put on them their clothes and they set him thereon and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and stro them in the way and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying hosana to the son of David blessed is he that come in the name of the Lord hosana in the highest and when he was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this amen let's B our heads in prayer dear heavenly father we thank you for your mercy your grace your presence Lord and your word that is being revealed to us and we have come here under expectation not from a man but from the son of man so we thank you once again as we commit this service into your Mighty hands in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you you may now be seated amen so uh it's good to be back and we I always feel that warmth welcome amen so we're just so happy uh I'm just so happy to be here uh I miss my wife to be with me uh but somehow uh if the Lord ties probably amen uh so I would like to give a title on this simple sermon this morning uh and we want to get that from verse two and this title is being loosed for the Master's use amen being used for the Master's use so we see that uh everything uh said nothing happens by accident everything just happened right on the dot and specifically to the Sons and Daughters of God Amen uh we're fulfilling scriptures amen we're fulfilling prophecies and Jesus Christ in his Earthly Journey he fulfilled every bit of Prophecy that was spoken for him he never deviated from uh uh from any Scripture written of him and I believe while he is the main character there are other character surrounding him amen and everything has to be fulfilled everything has to be in place and I'm just thinking in in verse 8 it it says here in verse 8 a very great great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and throw them in the way so everything or everybody is responding as the Fulfillment is being unfolded amen there has to be a a uh an act amen towards the word when it is being fulfilled so uh that's why in in verse 8 we see here that very great multitude spread their garments meaning their overgarments they wanted to uh to throw it on the the the streets and lay it down amen so the uh the ass that that that the Lord Jesus Christ was writing will step into it to it it's like a carpet amen they don't want to let the the the the food of of the ass to uh to touch the ground they throw the their garments and those who who who didn't have overgarments in them amen they others they cut branches from the trees amen so uh and throw them in the way so that means they didn't have to go home because they will miss the opportunity amen so it's the same thing with us amen when we hear God's word when we hear his voice we just don't have to let it pass on us we want to do something we want to drop whatever we can and we're not looking for something that is not within our reach amen we serve the Lord on whatever we have amen whatever is available we're not looking for something you know uh uh uh uh uh young people you know uh uh we're we're praying for something we have ambition we're planning and we want to serve the Lord we want to to do our best in the future amen no we're not expecting any any other day any other future because we have to do what we can in this day and age that we are living in we have to respond on the word today right now not later not tomorrow right now amen so that's why you see they they they they took every opportunity uh those multitude so uh so all these things because you see the uh four the verse four or the fourth verse speaks of uh the Fulfillment of the words of Zariah now in Zariah 9:9 it says Rejoice greatly oh Daughter of Zion shout oh daughter of Jerusalem Behold thy King cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a cult the fall of an ass so this is the the the Fulfillment uh or or this was a prophecy and later on being fulfilled in verse 4 of Matthew chapter 21 uh so uh the Lord never deviated from anything that is written of him now let me put a quote on this brother bam said God then what was he doing what is that attraction up there on the hill he said it's god making history and God fulfilling prophecy and that always causes an attraction so every time if prophecy is being fulfilled it creates an attraction amen it uh uh and because uh uh there is an attraction it creates reaction so that's why uh in in in in verse 10 he said and when he was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved meaning everybody did their part that's right amen everybody did their part because all amen all who have witnessed his coming all the city was moved saying who is this amen some were uh uh wondering who is this is but there were people who really knew who he was am he knew they knew what was taking place and they could identify that in the scripture amen and that's the very purpose we are here the brother of God said we need to see our place in the scripture sir we need to recognize our day and the time that we are living in and and what is the message of the hour in the day that we're living in because we're not living in yesterday's light we're living in today's light we need to walk in the light because he is in the light not he will be in the light he is in the light amen so now they they they responded so others Wonder but others they were specifically uh aware of what's uh uh what's taking place and then in paragraph 57 he said brother bam said now when God fulfills his word it always causes an attractions always does causes an attraction for it is unusual so unusual when he fulfills his word to the Modern Trend of the day cuz the Modern Trend of the day don't believe in it they have their own way amen because it happens because sometimes people get used to something that is already happening and they get used to it and it becomes their safety zone amen right but God never runs out of an attraction and his attraction is always on the Fulfillment of the word amen and so when that word is being fulfilled it creates an attraction and people react because they're being moved so the people who are being moved they did what they can they they laid everything what they have amen so whatever was available in their hand they responded but people you know sometimes when something is taking place they do not want to go out of their safety zone fear is coming yeah amen because they're afraid to go out of their safety zone amen but God always tears amen his nest yeah amen because uh uh God doesn't want us to to of course we want to be relaxed we're resting in the hand of the Lord but sometimes we get too much uh rest and become so confident amen and and remember in the time of Peace amen unexpected time comes and then suddenly work just like what's happening in Israel right now amen but God knows what he is doing amen so everything so uh everything that Jesus did in his Earthly Journey as I said was a fulfillment of a prophecy but uh we don't have to push the prophecy to be fulfilled amen because prophecies will happen no matter what that's because what's the what's the point of knowing the prophecy and yet and yet you cannot adapt yourself your life does not match the time the the prophecies are being fulfilled amen we should be we should be aware of how we should live rather than just watching what's taking place around us amen uh because habak said the bishop is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t God always fulfills his word it will come to pass it will not t it will happen right on the dot right on the very specific time God knows it amen amen so you know sometimes it's good to talk about prophecies prophecies fulfilling fulfill something like that amen just like you know uh uh in the Philippines perhaps in other countries as well you know uh years back I remember uh some preachers uh when Obama was the was the Pres he became the president and he said oh amen his presidency will no long will no longer be finished the Lord will come Rapture will take place amen because they quoted the scripture and say uh Obama is like uh the king or the Pharaoh that did not know Joseph oh they can fit in a scripture with something and then uh but Obama's term completed [Laughter] and you know after Obama uh he said they were waiting for uh a woman president because we know it's part of the scripture and then we're we're just happy watching things coming to pass you know but they so Focus so much on this thing and then so it it didn't happen now here comes so this is the woman president this is the woman president all those things we're expecting for that to happen Amen in fact we know part of that have happened already but suddenly it wasn't Hillary Clinton who came out so they changed again change again the prophecy oh it's not the woman president it will be the last Trump so there will be no next president for the United States this will be the last Trump amen and remember prior to Obama amen it was you know uh it was uh George Bush and uh uh the 911 uh happened you know and they say now uh uh uh George Bush uh declared war in Afghanistan amen so this is the burning bush so they don't run out of prophecies just to be different just to stay their you know deep and you know they can they can see times you know but what is there if it's if it will happen it will happen it will come to pass but the thing is how do we place ourselves our lives in the scripture are we on the right spot then when the Lord comes amen amen that when the Lord comes we're going to meet him up there in the air Hallelujah so you see they don't run out so here comes now the this the last TR and then Here Comes amen and and and and Donald Trump uh did not win because they say Amen the White House is is not for Trump again it's forbidden Biden we don't have to pour the prophecies to be fulfilled because amen we ourselves are fulfilling the scriptures amen so that's why when we say Amen judgment begins in the house of God Amen we're not just thinking of the temple the sanctuary the church judgment begins in the house of God if you are the house of God then you can find yourself in the scripture amen and then find out and judge it whether your life right now pitch the scripture that when he comes right now that when he picks us when he picks the bride we will be part of we are part of it amen so prophecies amen those are things everything is properly in place and so now the in in this uh when when God fulfills his prophecy amen it must be complete amen uh uh with with with a very simple example we uh I remember when uh brother bam they were in a hunting trip uh brother adisal you know he was still young at that time and in the vision that brother brandham saw amen there were Beast there were uh grizzly bear and uh uh all this and all the characters and then he was as he was waiting he was asking was looking for the uh people around him but no one wearing a checkered shirt amen and brother bam was waiting and you know the brother who was with him they want to do something but brother bam was waiting amen because in the vision it was so clear and so God is the one that do and fulfill his word amen he will make it happen to prove and vindicate his word and you never nobody expected that even even brother Ed did not expect that and then he tumbled and he his shirt got wet and without you know he he was just moved amen he just reacted on what had happened and he had to change and when he had to change he opened his his back and there is the checkered shirt amen his wife never knew that he never knew it no but no one knew it but brother bham being the prophet was waiting because prophets amen they're always obedient to the heavenly vision amen so we are being moved amen uh uh with all and we are being attracted amen when things go on and now all the city were moved but others say who is this what's going on what is this message of all about and the people people's reaction on the word or on the Fulfillment of the word is based on the seed that is in them I like this portion when uh uh uh when brother Brenham made mention that there are there are there are people amen that are predestinated to see the word in their day and I'm glad are you glad this morning that you are part of those who are fulfilling this thing amen so you see now uh uh in in in the same message what is the attraction on the mountain he said he had made up his little group out of a bunch of poor people fishermen tax gather is uneducated the Bible said some of them were were even ignorant unlearn some could not even sign their name he never went to the churches to get his people and he never agreed with any of the church leaders and besides he followed the very trend of a prophet he condemned everything that they done as the ones before him had because they were a portion of the word and he was the word in its fullness amen so you might be occupying a seat there but you are let me tell you this that you are fulfilling a portion you are a portion of the word amen amen you are part of the prophecy being fulfilled in in this day you are doing what you have to do and you cannot go away from it because you are you have a nature in you you are HH you have a seed in you and you are predestinated to fulfill your portion in this generation Hallelujah and when you realize that amen you you there is no fear there is no insecurities amen there's no jealousy whatsoever because you know no matter what you are fulfilling a portion of the word allotted for you nobody can do what you can do because you are predestinated to that we cannot be somebody I cannot be brother Chad he cannot be brother Dany amen we he cannot we we cannot be anybody else except me except him amen because we are just fulfilling the very portion amen and sometimes you know uh uh uh uh uh something happens when somebody wants to put fulfill something that is not predestinated for him to do so that's why we need to realize who we are and what we are fulfilling in this generation amen so we are he said they were a portion of that word now there are many people who said they were uh the ones who ought to have loved him he said he came to his own and his own received him now amen so he said now the ones who ought to have loved him the ones who ought to have been for him where his bitter B enemies amen and then the next paragraph you said but in the midst of all of it through every age and every Prophet that had been or would be there is going to be a certain amount of people that's predestinated to hear that message and they will follow it I'm glad amen I'm glad I'm predestinated amen so I don't whether whether sometimes you present this message it is so clear it's so simple others don't understand it yeah amen but people unlearned uneducated but the moment they hear it they receive the message amen I remember uh uh I I remember one family in in our church and uh uh you know my my my father in-law uh was among the uh early ministers in the message in the Philippines and then we we went to the province and then uh by God's grace we were able to uh to start a small uh group there it's the province of Isabella my wife was born there that's why he she was named after that Province amen so that's why when we enter into that Province there is a mountain there and they cut the mountain and so there is you're entering amen and it's it's a big name there Isabella amen so so my wife owns that mountain Isabella amen so uh I remember brother Chas my brother-in-law brother cha we we we had a simple Bible study and the first Bible study that we had they belong to uh UPC group at that time and I shared about the original Scene It was among the first Bible studies that we did uh in that place it's uh 10 hours from Manila so you know I we have to travel 10 hours just to uh you know so I decided to share that amen and some might have been thinking it's too early to share that original Scene It Might stumble them so but I felt led to share it amen but the Father the father of uh uh of brother Chiba amen he was seriously hearing what every bit of detail I was sharing and through the scripture and immediately after that he said I have been I have been believing it was really not an apple amen amen but now it is scripturally cleared amen and the whole family accepted the message amen the the father brother Chiba died his his mother remains faithful in the message and then brother Chiba married my my my youngest uh sister-in-law and now we have another church brother Chiba is pastoring another church amen the the the Church of my former uh uh uh uh Pastor uh uh remains intact until now amen so why but people amen could think oh you're you're all Fanatics and everything amen but you come to think of that there are people who are really predestinated because they could the the seed in them could recognize the word amen hallelujah so that's why in Revelation chapter 3:14 I believe he said uh write these things sayth the amen amen write these things sayth the amen so our amen is not just our expression because we get excited or the the man the woman beside us say amen and we say Amen too amen but actually the amen is a person in Revelation 3:14 amen he said uh uh write this things sayth the amen so the amen is a person amen that that that will recognize himself that will recognize the word amen so that amening in you is the part of him the part of the word recognizing the word amen write this thing sayth the amen so your amen is the person of himself in you recognizing the word in your day Hallelujah write this thing sayth the amen who is the amen the beginning of the creation of God the faithful and through witness he was just he's there he knew everything amen so he knows that that Amen in you amen is the same person the same God the same word that's why he recognized [Applause] himself so remember that when you say Amen it's not you when you're the one aiming to the word it's you you're just excited but when he the person in you amen urge you say amen amen so he said now amen and so the whole family and now the two uh the two Elder brothers so brother chib they're prayerfully serving the lord both of the ministers elders of the church amen just for a single Bible study yes sir God it produce one church because they recognize their portion in the word amen so many will reject many will turn their backs against this word but there are people like you and me who are predestinated to see amen hallelujah that's the way the Lord trust us amen so now you see now in Matthew verse 21:6 he said now uh they were entering into the city Jesus could have entered he had the power he had power they were entering it was time for him to enter Jerusalem but he was watching he could have entered Jerusalem but he needs to see the complete sin of the prophecy amen so Zechariah 9:9 he knew he was the one riding on an ass but where is the ass so Jesus knew where that ass was amen and so now the the the disciples with him were part of the prophecy Jesus knew the ass where it is being tied he could have gone their straight but the disciples were part of the prophecy amen so he said the disciples went he said he command and did as Jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the cult and put them on their clothes and they set him him thereon amen so now what are we doing now what is brother Danny doing what is brother Jad doing what the Bible Ministry doing we're just under the instruction of the master amen it's not our own conviction but it it is under the instruction of him who saw us in the vision yeah who so as part of the Fulfillment of this great prophecy in the last day that's right amen and so when when you when when you uh uh when you move when you act on something and you know you are fulfilling the scripture you have confidence amen amen uh uh I preached uh in the Church of brother Steven Shambo the the right side of the ship and I said the right side of the ship is not just the opposite of the left or maybe opposite of wrong because it's the right side of the ship amen because uh when they throw the when they threw the net it was the same side the same ship the same net and the same fishermen amen but what makes the difference is that they're going to throw the net under the instruction amen yeah they threw the whole night the same net because they were doing it on their own but after his resurrection amen they were instructed Amen to throw the net again amen and said they got they got fish amen amen and they got great fish probably you know not many fish but great fish and you know it's a different net it's the the the same Bible but it's now a different Bible because we have different spiritual perspective because of the message of the hour amen so there were many great fish and the good thing there the net was not broken we are being caught by this message net and no matter how many people how many distraction how many would like to discredit the prophet and this message of the hour the net will not be broken amen it can it keep will keep on getting great fish amen for his glory so now you see now they were under the instruction they went there and to give them confidence if somebody stop you just speak the word and say the master needs them amen so when they went there and the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the cult and put on them their clothes and they set them set him there on Amen now now cat on this thing he said he put on them their clothes so this might be something not normal but every natural thing types is spiritual amen so the uh uh if we if we see if we see that in a symbolic form what the uh uh the disciples wore amen they put it on the Beast amen and on top of that the master the king the Lord Jesus Christ sat on that so remember that the Beast is power yeah amen amen uh so for many years we don't know how long uh the ass and the cult were there yeah loose uh uh tied amen but when the time came that they will be loosed amen for the Master's use sometimes we're being tied to something we don't know how long sometimes we're being tied to our job to our work amen to any circumstance we bring tith for everything but when your time comes amen and under the instruction of the master somebody shares you the word somebody calls you and something happens you know you got loose amen you got loose we're being free we're being released out of all these things and now we are for the Master's use Hallelujah I have been uh uh my my my friends brother Chad knew our story amen you know uh uh at the younger age you have dreams you you have Ambitions amen we're so tied with all these things amen and uh uh it was I have many dreams but I never dreamed to be a pastor amen because I was tied with every bit of ambition before amen amen and but God knows what to do he will place Us in some situations amen that our bonds our chains will be cut and I thank God now amen I committed myself I recognize that I am loose for the Master's use not for anyone else amen so now you see that's the same thing that that we're doing in and uh brother Franco entered into the office this morning and we're just a quick and we're we're we're we're doing uh uh we were able to have uh testimony and you know during the pandemic uh we we were instructed to stay home we cannot go outside we cannot cross borders because there are many checkpoints amen but uh by God's grace we were blessed and uh in the Philippines being a minister we are considered frontliners and uh we have uh uh we have this we just have to have our IDs and everything amen but uh the Lord knows what he is doing and I I know I have sent few reports on that and uh we have we have brothers working with us in the province of NOA we have uh people working with us of course you know brother Val amen you know uh these brothers brother dondon brother brother Nan brother Elvin you know and then uh they're younger than us amen and we now recognize that amen so and after the immediately after the pandemic there is one good story I want to tell uh there is a brother uh he messaged me and said pastor we were blessed you know it's just good that I have I have three sons who know things and uh when we were going to Myanmar to Indonesia we're doing all these gadgets that we have for the translation and because they were so old you know we just uh uh because we stopped going to Myanmar because of the military control right now and so we pick these are all things all gadgets that we had before and the the very first day the very first day I I we just traveled from Japan at that time and 3 days after we came back everything shut down so if we extended 4 days in Japan we were in Japan during that time and we could not go home I don't know but 3 days prior amen was the shutdown and I said I when when when we were on the table as a family I talked to my to my son and said I cannot just you know let this thing we people cannot go to church and uh I cannot just sit down without doing anything and so I I said let us look for all all those old gadgets and you just check and you know if we can if you can make it work and we were able to make it work and then those little cameras that we have and so we set we set a table in in our home amen and it it become a uh a a simple studio and for a period of 1 month month straight amen the first month of uh uh of the the the shutdown every day brother John amen we uh uh we did uh Bible study and everything and it benefited a lot of families and they kept on you know and I was inspired to do it so it's St and then later on sometimes it got loose amen so we did it in the duration of the uh uh pandemic and but in the church we never miss a single service because uh our church is a compound uh so we are in in a corner you know that brother the Chad we're we're in s in a corner but the other side is another community so this side is another community so we have Gates here we have gate on this side amen and so in the corner we have the the policemen there so what we do amen we provide food for the once in a while we provide food for the policemen and so people can come in on this side or from the other community some of them the head of the families could enter the church and then so to cut the story short we were not a we we we we did not miss any single service so we were able uh to to stream service and then uh the people outside and this young brother he said uh Pastor Dan he said can we download your message and I would like to share this to my family amen later on uh he shared it to the family and then to the neighbors and uh eventually because people could not do anything and in the province it's it's not that straight so under the the shades of the tree there is a monitor in front and they put up chairs and they were watching our service and there's no signal there so the brother will download the will download the uh the service and they will they will stream up uh watch that the following week so they are delayed a week amen but they were rejoicing and eventually it appeared to be a church and immediately after the after the uh pandemic we went there it's probably 12 or 14 hours from our place and it's a good place it's a coastal area in we and we baptized 25 souls for God's glory many were got loosed and now they are in the master sh and that brother amen keep on going and now we are building a church amen his name is brother rang was you you met him when you were there and so we we just do what we weekend and upon checking after that uh pandemic thing amen we are free to go out we go to the mountains as long as it's just Isabel that is uh riding with me I can have one company and then my father-in-law died and uh it was at the peak of uh uh of the uh shutdown and so we had to go there in the province and so at that time for the funeral a minister is allowed to travel and the immediate family member and our government because probably uh the situation of our church the the the government issued a certification for me and in that certification they indicated Bishop Dan delmundo [Laughter] we have no Bishop in the message we understand that amen but that's how they see it and so uh now we are allowed in one one vle so if the minister amen he can bring a driver with him so that means I can bring JoJo with me my brother-in-law is is the driver so I'm the I'm the the I'm the bishop and then it's also allowed to have Amen in the funeral immediate family members so I was able to bring my wife because she is a daughter so po Bas him and you know before we reach amen the place we passed through over 30 checkpoints and every time where are you going I will say I will show my ID oh Bishop okay go go go go I got the idea now brother John amen so when we came back now we can travel we went from one Community to another amen you know uh uh uh in one in one location uh uh brother Bal went with me and we baptized 19 Souls we baptized 25 Souls we baptized and I counted them after the pandemic in the pandemic we were able to baptize close to 200 Souls combined how many Souls have been Loos amen how many Souls have been loose and now they're in the master shoes Hallelujah and so now we have you know I said H my my my my youngest daughter Fai asked me Papa amen when are we going to go out to go for a holiday without having church because everywhere we go amen it's you tell me it's a vacation but yet there is when are we going to have our family holiday without having church and I said well I said this is our life amen but deep inside I felt guilty amen so so I said U maybe you know I am I'm 60 years old amen and in the Philippines when you're 60 years old you get your dual citizenship you are a Filipino Citizen and a senior citizen so I said I'm going to slow down and uh you know uh but you don't have control of your life that's right when you're when you are being loosed for the Master's use you don't pick you don't choose amen because we are here for the Master's use and we realize that and we have to do what we have to do and my family loves it my church my congregation understands it and we're we're so blessed amen uh uh uh for that so you know you see now all these things it's because it's just because we have a message to preach amen and so we are just fulfilling because when we are directed where when we are moving under the instruction of the lord we have great confidence that when we share this gospel amen two weeks prior to my trip to the us we went to the mountainous region of Abra banget amen and it was for the very first time we went there and and the place was so virgin there's no message Church there amen uh uh uh we travel good Highway 7 hours and we traveled another more than 4 hours of rough roads amen but when you when we get there I got excited I just I just felt something within my Within Myself and there was a woman amen uh uh that was sick amen that was sick in uh uh probably over a month amen and he had uh she had a a uh oxygen T at the corner of her bed and and she said uh the the the the the brother told me she's requesting a prayer and so we we we okay let's go there and we pray and before I prayed amen I just opened my Bible and I said Can can is it okay to just share you just 30 minutes of exhortation amen and so we uh I shared and before I ended up my exhortation amen the woman the woman testified and she and she said Thank You Lord I have been praying for two weeks now I have been praying for a minister to come in our village to pray for me and you sent Pastor Dany Amen to pray for me I have not even prayed for her I have not touched her yet I was about to give conclusion to my to my exhortation and just before that amen she pushed herself and sat down at the edge of the bed and requested a chair and I have the picture she sit down at my side while I I I was giving a conclusion I have not prayed yet I just shared Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever by his stripes we were healed and she claimed it without even laying my hands on it not even praying but her F through the word she was Loos Hallelujah he was loose out of that sickness out of that sick bed amen and and her granddaughters amen sit down at the bed and listen to the word amen and by just first visit to that Village we baptized five souls for God's glory amen and so now another thing we just held the meeting in the house we just made the uh held the meeting in the house and then when the people heard now they say why don't we why don't we why don't we do it uh in the community uh uh in the health centers that they say we want to do it in the community can we uh can we invite you and so they did it uh to uh in the community we we uh we had an open service and while we were doing that it just reminded me of the old times because it was in in in the innermost part of the mountains it just reminded me during the old times when you can just stand on one corner and sing songs and people will stop and listen now during that evening amen uh the people one family after the other they're coming out Amen to to hear the word amen and I just felt something is going to take place in that Province amen there many tied ass and calls in that Village that needs to be that need to be loosed amen for God's glory amen and thank you we we we will appreciate all your prayers amen for all these things to happen so now come to think of that so you see let me just check this for a while so now after that they they they committed and the in that same evening I got loosed and my wife wife was in front sitting and I was not looking at her because I felt I I I I I I I discerned what he what she was trying to say she was trying to tell me it's time it's evening already everybody sleeping early in the village amen but I got loose brother I just preached my heart out and just you know never mind the time you know but you know uh the following day I thought the the chief of the village will get mad but the chief of the village said amen next time you do we do that amen you come over you're always welcome and you can we can do that in the in the in in the covered court and we can invite more people amen hallelujah so many potential uh uh uh uh Beast that are willing to to serve are waiting for us brothers and sisters we just have to let them lose for the Master's use amen hallelujah wait something happened here hallelujah so Satan is mad to us amen so now again let's go back to that point so you see brother brandham made mention a lot of things in this generation and we have to realize that uh being part of the body the mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ each one of us has a portion to do we just have to realize what we have to do for God's glory amen so now when they entered into that City remember when they entered into that City Jesus knew what was coming remember you come here this morning you prayed and uh uh you have come here you we want to be blessed as much as possible I want to be blessing to be a blessing amen probably not much but something that would help that's a a password between B Chad and myself amen so you see now we have come here we we sing songs we're prepared right because we want to be a blessing for God's glory amen all the way from your home coming here we're under expectation but think of this when Jesus was entering the city brother bham said he knew it was his last visit amen amen he knew the sufferings that he had to undergo he knew everything all the bad things that will happen to him but he was full fulfilling a scripture and he cannot do away with it Hallelujah so he will suffer amen and and and and everything all those things he had to suffer he knew from his mind that's the difference when we come here amen but you know Jesus Christ amen never never turned his back that's right because he wanted to fulfill what is written of him all right amen so when they entered there and now so the the the the the Beast you know Beast means power and those ask the old and the young and I like this portion because in this portion you see the the the old and the young they were both tied they they were they were there and so they were being released and then the disciples put their clothes on top of the Beast and the Lord sat down there now let me quote he said brother bam said the pipul ministry they were asked you know have you he was being asked is there anything that the PIP that the that the bride uh should the bride have a Ministry before the rapture you know brother bram's answer right and brother brandham said well he said yes the bride has a Ministry and it's going to be it's going to be a humble Ministry amen and he said it is the fivefold ministry he made mention the fivefold ministry that they will fulfill and they're fulfilling scriptures the fivefold ministry and I like that portion that brother bam said that the the the PIP Ministry are God's dress wear they're God's dress we amen so if they're God's dress we they were in spiritual condition they know how to dress themselves on the natural aspect and now just like they were God's dress wear now they are dressing the bride with what they have so we see here a transition amen that because when they entered they they dressed the they dressed the the uh uh the Beast and then the Beast carried the burden amen he he they uh uh he he brought the the Lord into the city of Jerusalem to fulfill the word but what I am so excited about is to see because all the all all all these years I've been you know my my focus was just on the ass that the Lord wrote amen but he was not the only one being tight right but Jesus said lose them not just the one he's going to use at that time yeah amen Jesus Christ said lose them not just her amen lose them amen and if somebody stop you amen tell them amen that they're going to be used by the master hallelujah amen and they will not stop you amen okay now I do not want to miss this portion so I have to repeat now he said would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture and said sure that's what's going on right now certainly it is the message of the hour the bride of Christ is consist of Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry great ministry it's the ministry of the hour in it will be so humble amen amen now it will be so humble why is so humble because you know when the ass entered into the City and everybody was throwing their garments throwing leaves and branches the the ass said in himself oh thank you thank you and she he the ass appreciate all those uh uh carpet like garments and branches you know he's rece because he felt he's receiving all the credits thank you thank you but those branches and those garments were not for him right amen but he was into it because the master was on top of him amen hallelujah oh the Lord may the Lord help us ministers amen that when the Lord use us amen when the master use us we don't deserve the credit amen because the glory belongs only to him amen so we we we yeah we we we we want to be appreciated sometimes amen but let us be like amen we Minister should be like amen David that when David received that water and those three great warriors amen they jerise their lives amen David did not drink the water that he wanted to because because of the sacrifices of his Warriors he poured the water to the ground amen and said Lord I don't deserve this thing because these kind of sacrifices only belong to you our God Amen may the Lord help us amen that the ministry the piple ministry will remain in humility that whenever we being used by God we are just being used we're just vessels of God Amen but the glory belongs only to him and we're just privilege to be part of this calling hallelujah we're just part of this calling amen and so now he said now God in the message putting on the whole armor of God now God fortified this Army what with himself amen amen he covered him himself not anyone else amen he fortified this Army what with himself in the form of prophets Apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was going what was God doing listen did you ever think of what the offices of the church is it is God's dress inside dress an apostle or Prophet is for see before Satan ever gets to it amen done told it amen God dress up in his church these offices is God's dress where amen so how can we make it to the Rapture how can we obtain God's righteousness without enjoying the benefits of the pipel ministry Hallelujah we cannot go to the Rapture without a pastor so thank God that we have a pastor thank God that we benefit from teachers missionaries amen a prophet and everything so we should benefit from because this is God's dress wear amen they are being instructed by the Lord this offic is not the men but the offices were under the inspiration the anointing of God the master of all Hallelujah but this is what we're praying for amen that no matter how great the Lord used the ministry may we stay in that office in that anointing of humility amen amen that we stay humble in the presence of the Lord amen uh prayerful and humble in everything I'm praying for that I said you know I said in myself you know I'm old I'm not young anymore amen these These are proof we have nothing to prove amen because it's only God who can vindicate you know we cannot even defend we cannot even protect our own Ministry it must be God am amen it must be God and and uh I thank God that we're being identified with uh with such a Ministry amen that we fully although the prophet of God you know the pastor is humble but not too humble he said amen of course we know where we are standing so in in the Old Testament we have morai amen and I look look at this scripture in the in in verse chapter 2: 11 and morai walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how Esther did and what should become of her amen so Mori types the prophet and he gave message to Esther not only doctrines not just the Deep teachings of the message that we found here but the purpose is what should become of her the message is deep no doubt about that amen amen but the real depth of the message is that it can produce the character of Christ in the bright amen so this line tells a lot and he said so morai every day he's checking you know he's checking and and and and and uh asking about uh about Esther uh because his message was to produce a queen amen what should become of her amen so the bride uh uh uh uh uh when the Lord Jesus Christ comes back he's not going to take just any church but he's going back for his bride so this message gives us the details of what should become of us like the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen now so you see uh in in that portion where where I said I see you know both both of them were being loosed in in uh in verses 1 to3 let's read in verse two now ye shall find an ass tied and cult with her loose them and bring them unto me and if any man say o unto you he shall say the Lord that need of them and straight way he will send them amen so both of them were released now imagine that 2,000 years ago both of them were loosed but Jesus Took only one Beast to ride on but the young amen because the poanas is a younger Beast a younger one and this younger was just watching amen watching so when when when he we was they were they they entered into the city but the young Beast was already there because both of them were being loosed now what I'm trying to show this brothers and sisters that at that time there were already two generations of ministry inspiration amen the the the the the ass where Jesus rode and the younger one who was just following wherever it went and I believe it's the same thing today we don't have any other message this is the message where we are being brought back to the original faith of the Apostles now what I'm saying this morning that 2,000 years ago the ministry the portion of that Beast that Jesus rode has been done already amen but there is one following and that young ass 2,000 years ago is no longer young today it's here the anointing the inspiration the ministry and that is what the Lord Jesus Christ amen will take and write this Trail again amen hallelujah not brother randam rising from the dead amen I'm sorry amen but it must be amen the beast in the right that the Lord Jesus Christ is riding once again in this generation that we're living in it's no longer young this time is fully matured it has passed through various experiences that it is ready to Bear the burden amen and and and the Beast is a that that that ass is a burden Bearer that's why we are bearing the burden amen of this message to bring it to the life last lap of this journey brothers and sisters so we need to take our position amen so every time there is a transition that we see we saw that in uh we saw that in Elijah amen and we saw that in Elisha all right so there are two generation we saw that in Moses and we saw we saw that in in Joshua am mean so it's the same thing today so we see this two generations amen and now today is the Fulfillment and remember this in the simple EX in the simple illustration brother bam said watch what we doen because there are always eyes watching amen because we create an influence that's why our faith in in in the message the ministry of Malachi 4 is to restore our faith back amen because we have to watch Elisha asked something from Elijah when when when Elijah said what do you want and he said I want want a double portion of what you have Elijah said you're asking for something that is too much too much for me but he said you keep an eye amen don't lose your sight because he said but when I'm said amen uh uh uh elishah had to see Elijah all the time until amen he saw him leave the sin right you ask for something that is hard but he said if thou see me go amen you shall have what you're asking for and I believe that's that's something that other people are failing to see they have seen the coming of the Prophet but they have not seen him go we're not saying brother brandham is no longer part of this ministry he is because we believe the message of God that passes through him but we believe in the changing of the dispensation the changing of times that even during the time of brother Branham he show us a perfect example amen remember the time when Haiti right approached brother Brenham and brother Brenham heard a message from the from the Lord amen that that the Lord was so pleased with that woman and he said whatever that woman say it will come to pass amen so you see uh that was just an actual situation but we see spiritual connotation on that that that that the prophet that that in that event in that significant moment there was something a change from the prophet to the bride amen uh brother said the Lord spoke Amen in the same voice that the same voice that spoke those squirrels amen that H uh the same voice that yeah that brought back the life of that little fish was the same voice who spoke to brother branam and he knew the Lord will do something amen and he he spoke to the bride and he said sister hat right amen representing the bride amen he said the Lord spoke and and he said whatever you say whatever you speak amen not just the prophet possessing the third pool Ministry the third pool manifestation but he was showing to us amen that at a certain level a certain condition of Faith a certain attitude character just like the character amen the desires the will of that mother amen and he said and and and and and sister was so innocent he said brother bam I don't know I don't know how how can you say it for me amen and but said no but the voice said whatever you say not whatever I say whatever you say so brother is placing the woman just like the bride placing in a position amen that not only HH H uh we know so much but the character amen and and and see this this woman said I don't know brother brandham can you say can you speak for me but brother BR said it's not what it says it's not the voice is not the vision amen but you say whatever you say and the prophet gave her a multiple choice you choose you're so poor you can ask for money and I was he was expecting bundles of dollars probably if she would have spoken that and you have a sick loved one right you may ask and right at that very moment they will see that loved one jump healed amen amen but the condition of that woman's heart is not for temporary amen manifestation he want something that is eternal amen hallelujah I believe we can see there amen that we we can speak the right thing if we have the right attitude the right character amen not what we know but what the Lord wants or desire amen and he she asked for something that is eternal I I want the salvation of my two sons and the lord gave it because that's what the the brides say oh I could imagine amen the position of the Bride today if we can only be in that position that the Lord is expecting us amen things will will will will will uh uh uh will come to pass right in our midst amen and we don't have to force everything amen sometimes we force you know people how can the bride is so the the bride is so disunified today many many Circles of Fellowship many uh comes circles so forth and so on we're not looking for a physical manifestation of unity amen God sees the invisible Union amen and so you come to think of that amen so now just we what we are seeing here what's happening in Israel right now amen before I flew to the uh to the states amen I have seen in the news amen how Israel was so disunified right amen people coming out on the streets amen complaining against uh uh their prime minister their government they were so divided if we look at it but something happened amen something happened amen an attack took place and now we have not seen Israel as un as unified as what we are seeing today even the opposition leader amen appealed the ruling party that they that they were willing to join Force amen and uh h h uh uh come up with something to represent only one nation Israel I believe the same thing amen the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ will come to that spot we're not going to force it we have to do what little portion we have and we will come to that spot without even realizing it hallelujah amen so uh brother bham said you know amen uh we we we we we we Brams we fight he amen we fight in the backyard amen but when somebody throws Stone Amen on a on a roof you will see how the Brams react we are one and it's the same thing with the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen just do what you have to do let them do what they have to do amen but when the time comes amen when the pressure comes the true and genuine Unity will come into our existence Hallelujah and it's not one organization not one person ality not one particular Doctrine but it is God's love unifying the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so now it's the so you see so that's why we have to Be watchful of what we are doing anden brother Bram you know in this age brother brandham said you know that's why we have problem today many times you say we have he said he he he spoke about the children this delinquency he said it's not actually child delinquency amen but he said what what we need it's not juvenile delinquency it's parent delinquency it's because that the parents has neglected and a whole lot of us is the way the church will never preached what's the matter Brethren get back to the gospel preach all time Holiness and get into the church again we must have a standard amen amen he said we must have a standard amen we're not groping in darkness here in the message we have a standard we have a word to preach we have a message to live by amen and and and and so now and and you see not only parents delinquency but brother bham said there's also Pulpit delinquency sir amen you know this message pure message is our weapon Amen to be used for the enemy amen amen right we don't use our canons and shoot any other church right and we're not expecting other Church to shoot us amen message church I believe but it must start from the pulpit we need to strike the Devil head on Amen because brother Brenham said you know if we amen uh uh uh if we will fight you know the devil will not accept any effort anymore he will just sit down and rejoy and just watch amen but thank God I believe the Bride of today is advancing to the point amen that that that the word of the Lord is what is being delivered behind the pulpit amen it's not one Church against another church amen but this message amen you know sometimes people you know they know how to qu how to quote scriptures they know how to quote statements of the Prophet amen but you see when you you hear somebody uh uh you know uh quoting the scripture quoting the statement of the Prophet you know the pastor cannot cannot uh uh save you the church cannot save you amen we believe what brother Brandon where where he is coming from right but when you hear a person quoting that scripture and he is not going to church you know where he is coming from and you know where he is going to amen is misplaced amen but we should not miscot the the the scripture uh uh the statement of the Prophet we should take it as it is amen and we should take it amen for our benefit amen and for the benefit of the Brethren Hallelujah so now so as we are that's why you know when when uh when people I like this portion I remember the time you remember uh Elisha you know he went out in the he went out and those young children mocked him and said you baldheaded why didn't you go with the prophet ahead of you Elijah and I was reading this portion and let me read it he said now if any of them kids would said now if their father and mother had said now look children they say that Elijah was taken up now we don't know about that I don't know whether it's so or not but I tell you the best thing to do is just don't say nothing about it just go ahead when he passes we hear he's coming down through the city today going to have a street meeting up there if he does if you children on the road to school today meet him just say how do you do Reverend how do do you do sir or something like that but instead of that no doubt they'd been told at home or they heard Papa and Mama sat at the table and laughing one another saying what do you know they said that old Holy Roller was taken up did you ever believe anything like that and they said this little old baldheaded fellow just as baldheaded as a pumpkin up there he ain't over about 35 years old and here he's coming down through there and said he's going to hold the street meeting expect us amen believe such nonsense as that why he's not nothing but a little mockery that's all his cuz he won't come to our churches just like Elijah was probably some kind of a witchcraft amen hoax like Elijah they didn't believe him so the little children was taught that at home amen so those children marked and insulted the prophet as baldheaded and they disrespect not just the man but the office the anointing that was upon him and the prophet of God said they did that they were innocent but they did that because their parents probably during their breakfast table they talk about the pastor if they cannot talk about the pastor they talk about the wife of the pastor the children of the pastor the deacons right I'm not saying that's happening here amen but I'm saying people disrespect the office the children do not respect the office it didn't come from them amen so the reason brother bam say these things amen that we have uh Rebel Spirits there Rebel children there they don't respect the pulpit they don't respect the offices the PIP Ministry because there are disrespectful parents at home yeah and these children were watching hearing what they're saying amen and so this kids are just right there and they suffer amen being being uh uh what did and he turned and and and they say the there were two sheep Bears out of the wood and there 4 and2 children 42 children being torn down by the bear yeah amen and if we if we if we say if we uh compare those Bears into the demonic spirits of today amen so respect starts in the home amen you know when these children see that if they parents uh have some kind of disagreement they don't go to church that is reflected to their children amen so they won't go to church if there are some issues Hallelujah where did they learn it they will not learn it from the church they learn it from home home amen so we need that's why brother bam said we need to make our home nice an atmosphere where the Holy Spirit can come and visit because of the sweetness of the spirit hallelujah amen so but thank God we respect the offices amen we love the Lord we love the fold Ministry amen and uh uh and so that's why now amen when this in this last two generations that we are watching we're we're we're we're we're fuling fulfilling the last part right and when the losing Ministry the ministry that have loosed us now remember uh brother bam said in the message the piece of the the piece of the trumpet he said for many years the Holy Spirit has been bound by this denominational Rivers for almost 2,000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time amen by the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said he promised it Hallelujah that's why there are many Souls that are being released amen the things that we're doing uh uh uh uh uh doing some Exposition in the denomination and we have we have witnessed a lot of uh ministers somebody's calling uh uh uh messaging brother Chad uh this morning and you know he's been in the denomination before amen but when he heard the message he got loose amen amen and and and then we just pray that he will uh uh be he will keep on going and uh uh will be for the the Master's use now the word that we have is what brought the genuine Revival in the bright amen amen amen so Amen brother Chad quoted that you know the Pentecostals have so much to Rejoice the evangelicals on the other side you know they don't know what they have but putting this together the truth and the spirit of the Lord it will bring more results and it will produce a genuine Revival because we see genine Revival is sin when the word is being fulfilled in our midst I said one time you know the first Revival happened before Pentecost amen don't get me wrong but the first Revival happened in hell that's right don't get mad at me amen and I want to read a portion of the scripture uh State the preaching of brother bran I'm closing in a few minutes amen so we have come to this time amen now let let us read it you see uh uh in the message the in tubement during Easter he said now the seed was promised in the Garden of Eden the devil has constantly tried to destroy that seed and the death of Abel and the coming of Seth was just a death burial and resurrection of Christ that seed must continue and he tried to destroy it it is always the desire of the devil to destroy the seed amen want to put a stop on that now during that time I can hear him say Satan come here his boss now over grabs the key of death and Hell of his side hang it on his own side I want to serve notice unto you you've been a Blu long enough I am the Virgin born son of the Living God my blood is still wet on the cross and the pool that is paid you have no rights no more you are stri give me those keys turns around and gives him a good healthy cake and slams the door together and say stay in there I'm boss from now on Amen healthy kick it was not a simple kick I could imagine like a a rhouse a turnaround cake you know it was a healthy cake amen so Satan felt that amen uh and said now here is starts up getting Easter time passing fast but there's another group listen where is job where Abraham where are they at where those fellows that trust this God's word has he forgotten them did that annihilate them was that all of it never never God has to keep his word I can see him let's take the little peep into paradise and look over and I see Sarah and Abraham walking around there and after a while amen something on the door Abraham goes and opens the door say honey come here look here look here that's the very same one that stood with me under the oak that day amen hallelujah so he went down amen the Lord Jesus Christ came down after his death in amen uh he he came down he who ascended up is the same down the same that came down when he came down now there was a beginning of something yes right there in hell right there in Paradise amen he said now just that over Abraham just then I see Daniel look over his shoulder and say that's the rock that was shed out of the mountain just a certain as I am standing here I see job that's my redeemer and I said I knew that live and someday stand upon the Earth my body may not be but a little Spoonful Of Ashes but in 15 minutes from now amen I'll be in it again Ezekiel looks over the top and said I seen that same person as a whe in the middle of the wheel turning way up up in the middle of the air oh my then up comes Enoch Enoch said I saw him coming with 10,000 of his Saints to execute judgment there was the Old Testament Saints waiting amen sure they were under the atonement of blood they could not go in the presence of God of Heaven because goat and sheep blood could not take away sin but he said my brethren I am the one that you think I am I am the seed of the woman I am the son of David I am the Son of God I am the Virgin born one BL my blood has atoned for it you waited under the blood of sheep and goats but now amen he said but now my blood atones amen and you're free amen hallelujah so he he lose the natural eyes amen make use of them amen but these people who stood even under the the the the the shed blood of animals and the Old Testament that they were waiting for the Fulfillment of the prophecy they died believing the message in their day Hallelujah many have went ahead of us but they died believing the message of the hour with the same expectation amen so when he came down he said you are free yes sir amen and so because they are free there was a Revival in hell they were rejoicing and because of that presence because of that rejoicing hell death could not hold him that's why in Matthew chapter 27 after his resurrection many graves were opened Hallelujah many graves were opened because the souls that were been held in the Old Testament now we being loosed amen hallelujah and they were moved into another uh another place Hallelujah so how much more today that we have heard the liberating message of the hour amen thank you Lord because we have heard the liberating message of the hour and you know Amen in in in in John chapter 8:36 if the sun therefore shall make you free ye shall be free in death amen let me close with this amen if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed amen hallelujah I thank God I am free I thank God I am free as we call on our musicians amen this afternoon amen now that us was for a long time they were been tied in this illustration I I remember one illustration you know there is a an ass that's being tied for a long time and his owner just gave him probably 3 m away from the post and he was tied there almost all his life and so he just walked and he cannot go farther than 3 m and he will go around that post and then later tie himself his neck is on the post and then he will go another Direction but he can go as far as 3 m only and then he go back almost all his life he spend being tied in that post but one day a concerned individual amen Cut the Rope he's free he didn't realize it immediately amen but because he's been tied for so long a time in that post 3 MERS away from the post it was cut but he was just run running 3 m but he had marked a circle 3 m away and then suddenly he stepped out of that and he realized he can go further amen he can go further and then he he he he moved further and he realized he's really free and he's totally free and he could go further amen that's the same thing with us Satan try to convince us that we are being bound we are under his control and that's why we cannot be fully used because we are being tied with something we're being tied with our past experiences we we've been being tied with our old life we feel you know we condemn ourselves because of our past sometimes we have our own prejudices and biases we're being tied to that amen people could not move on because they have feed themselves with lots of bitterness and negative things amen but let me tell you today our savior the Lord Jesus Christ the son of man has cut us people could not go amen uh uh uh uh just one day it happened to us you know because of this message of the hour we rejoice when we when we were being loosed when we are being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ repentance is a part of it amen so when we repented amen so we we are being released by our all sins amen but as we keep on moving we go further from that post where we being tied almost our life amen so we got we got extended more later on we saw it's not just baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we've seen more amen we've seen what have happened in the Old Testament we've seen what happened in the Garden of Eden Hallelujah and we got loose and later on the book amen the the the the seven gold candlesticks amen all these symbols in the Bible we're being we are being tied tied with all these symbols but now it's being open to us hallelujah more Revelation is coming up and it's releasing more releasing more Hallelujah and the more we we hear more of this message we got loose amen the word has restored us back to the fate of our fathers amen amen we we we went further amen hallelujah amen we went back to the fate of our fathers the original teachings the basic teachings of the Apostles but when we realize as we enjoy more freedom amen amen our Revelation did not stop in the time of the Apostles it went back to the Garden of Eden in Genesis Hallelujah where the abstract deed amen was loosed by Adam and now it's being restored and we can live we can enjoy with such a blessing Hallelujah and even go beyond that yes not just restored back to the faith of the Apostles not just restored back amen our position just like our you know in in the Garden of Eden but we went further than that we were back into the mind and we can enjoy more I'm loose I'm free Hallelujah as I go on by the chat to finish this amen so God bless you Hallelujah I'm sorry for being loosed hallelujah amen thank you Lord Free Yourself Amen Let Us serve the Lord you are free you're loose for Master's use God bless you amen I was hanging back hoping he'd keep going if I didn't move forward let's all stand amen has the message loosed you amen are we free oh I want to live like I'm free I don't want to be bound in my mind I don't want my memory I don't want my reasoning I don't want to be bound by all those things I want to keep moving further away from the post like like Enoch kept moving further away from the post amen till he realized I'm so far down the road why don't I just go on home I want to get that far away from the post amen amen I was so blessed and encouraged by the word challenged amen let's just sing brother let's sing I am free I am free my new day has come now I can be who I truly am I am free covered by his blood all things are possible With God all things are possible with god oh I'm resting on the finished word Jesus Christ today all circumstances will be gone the word of God will still remain no sickness fear no guilt or sin can have control and worry me the keys of Faith are in my hands and I am Bound for victory I am free my new day has come now I can be who I truly am I am free covered by his blood all things are possible With God all things are possible with god oh a Great Commission from my Lord I have now rece see the prince of power of the air will never have a part in me as amure Creator I can change the atmosphere around I use the chain of circumstance for any Spirit to be bound I am free my new day has come now I can be who I to the end I am free covered by his blood all things are possible With God all things are possible to God I know that Jesus the I am is the same today the prophet came to show the light the briide must have it on display the hour has come for Christ in us to be completely glorified I want the spirit to be free to do the Greater Works in me I am free my new day has come now I can be who I truly am I am free covered by his love all things are possible With God all things are possible with god oh is it our new day are we free man I was just thinking of Lazarus when Lazarus died and they put him in a tomb and they rolled a big Rock Amen over it and they they had him sealed away in death amen but Jesus knew he just slept he knew he wasn't dead because Saints can't die so he comes to the gravide and and he tells him to roll the stone away whatever false understanding whatever false Doctrine has sealed Us in to the to the tomb of denominationalism and man's idea roll that away and then the voice of God is going to call our name amen how does he how does he call our name as he reveals the book He's Calling our name name and he's calling for us to come forth amen so this is the day we live in amen the stone has been rolled away amen we've come out of the deadness and the deadness of denominationalism why cuz he called our name but there was another step amen he said loose him from the bed clothes amen why because they wrapped him for death they didn't wrap him for life they wrapped him in man's ideas they wrapped him in all kinds of History they wrapped him to be dead they bound him for death and put him in the tomb but now the word has opened the tomb the voice of the Lord has called our name amen but there's another step oh we got to be loose from the old thinking we've got to be loosed from the old teaching loose us and let us go so that we can be a testimony of the resurrection of Jesus Christ the resurrection power that's in this word amen loose us oh God I need loose from my old thinking I need loose from my own Traditions I need loose from my past I need loose from my mist Stakes I need loose from everything that they wound around me for death amen because Lazarus became such a testimony of the resurrection power of Jesus Christ now not only did they want to kill Jesus they had to kill Lazarus cuz his life testified of the power of the word I want to have that kind of loosing so that my life is such a testimony of the resurrection power of Jesus Christ amen that I don't have just a problem with the word I got a problem with this one that was [Music] resurrected we've been loosed in this generation and you know I don't know about you but I don't want to be a Lazarus who's walking around still dragging an old piece of death cloth I want it all off I want it all off of me I want to I want to be you know when he says he ride this Trail again [Music] you know brother brandham said while the while the Antichrist is riding his mixed color horse of mixed demon powers and political powers and that Pale Horse he's riding them all into death he said Christ is riding his church all the way in the glory oh humble little beast amen nothing worthy nothing special amen but but it's not we're not special in ourselves that ass and that fo was not special amen but it had somebody special on it amen it was being used it was in the master service and it wasn't special because it was special it was special because the master was using it R we're nothing special the only thing special about us is who is using us cuz we've been loosed for the Master's use oh there was so many golden nuggets given today feel like I just want to I feel like I want to just stop go get something eat and play the service back again so like in all those good nuggets all those good things Lord's certainly been good to us today I think it's amazing the one thing that really stood out to me is when he was talking about Elisha and the she Bears and the parents in the house and the negative speech and we want to be careful friends amen and I mean more careful than just us as dad and moms in our homes but even as a church me as a pastor and all of us that we don't seow negative seeds about other Ministries and other churches I took
